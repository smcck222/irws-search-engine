GEORGE BANNING, 94; GRANDSON OF THE DEVELOPER OF CATALINA ISLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Hugh Banning, the last surviving grandchild of Gen. Phineas Banning, who 
developed Santa Catalina Island, Los Angeles Harbor and much of what is now 
Wilmington, died Sunday in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
The journalist, author and former postmaster of South Pasadena was 94. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Los Angeles, George Banning as a youth shipped out to sea, and he later 
wrote books and articles for pulp magazines on his maritime adventures. 
</P>
<P>
He also wrote a best-selling book of the 1920s, "Six Horses," about early 
California stagecoaches. 
</P>
<P>
His grandfather had established a wharf and shipping business in Wilmington and 
eventually built the Los Angeles &amp; Wilmington Railroad, a link between the 
water and Los Angeles. Southern Pacific later purchased it. 
</P>
<P>
Phineas Banning and George Banning's brother, Hancock, who died in 1982, also 
formed the Santa Catalina Island Co. after purchasing much of the island from 
George R. Shatto, founder of Avalon. 
</P>
<P>
The Banning family home in Wilmington is now a city museum. 
</P>
<P>
George Banning is survived by his wife, Ruth; a son, Douglas;, a daughter, 
Marianne; a stepdaughter, Susan Crutchfield, and five grandchildren.

<P>
A new "rap" music video featuring television teen heartthrob Richard Grieco 
asks young motorists to drive safely around California Department of 
Transportation highway workers. 
</P>
<P>
"Caltrans workers lay their lives on the line every day just so you can cruise 
through life in the fast lane," says Grieco, star of "Booker" and "21 Jump 
Street" and celebrity spokesman for Caltrans' "Give 'em a Brake" campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Copies of the 4 1/2-minute video, with rap music by "New Choice," a female trio 
from Sacramento which recently signed a recording contract with Warner 
Brothers, were sent to 1,700 California high schools last August for use in 
driver's education classes, Caltrans spokeswoman Tracey Weatherby said. 
</P>
<P>
The video will get its Sacramento premiere Monday night at a comedy club. 
</P>
<P>
Radio and television advertisements based on the video are being produced and 
will be shipped to broadcasters over the next several weeks, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to speak to the students in their own language about the dangers of 
highway work," Weatherby said. "Our main message is to respect and protect our 
highway workers and themselves as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Our intention was to speak to them, instead of talking down to them or 
preaching to them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The "Give 'em a Brake" program was started in 1982 after 19 Caltrans highway 
workers had been killed in 10 years by errant drivers who strayed into the work 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
Since the program's inception seven years ago, five Caltrans workers have been 
killed by motorists. 
</P>
<P>
Weatherby said the new video, developed with the aid of the California Assn. 
for Safety Educators, will help teach a new generation of drivers to look out 
for highway workers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a captive audience there (in school). They are learning the proper 
procedures of driving. If we can teach them, then we'll have a whole new 
generation of drivers who will respect the people trying to improve the 
conditions of the highway," Weatherby said.

<P>
FESTIVAL AIMS TO DO A CRACK JOB ON EGG SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Hause is director of security for the Cleveland Museum of Art, which 
owns several Faberge eggs. Hause said a big part of his job is worrying about 
the eggs, making sure no one cracks them, breaks them or steals them. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Hause has been thinking a lot about San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Several of Cleveland's eggs are in town, awaiting display as part of the San 
Diego Arts Festival: Treasures of the Soviet Union. Eight of the visiting 
Faberge eggs come from the Kremlin, 19 from private collectors. 
</P>
<P>
All 27 constitute, in the words of one festival official, a "security 
headache," so much so that almost no one is willing to discuss how, or by whom, 
the eggs will be guarded. 
</P>
<P>
For that matter, security for the entire festival is, for the most part, a 
well-kept secret. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important part of any security initiative is not to talk about it 
with anyone who doesn't need to know about it," said Bruce Herring, executive 
director of San Diego Festivals. "It would be stupid to talk about it. Our 
tactics, as it were, are closely guarded. Let's just say we've taken more than 
adequate measures to make sure that all objects, and all individuals, are fully 
protected for the 3 1/2 weeks of the festival." 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot talk a lot about security, and that's all there is to it," said 
Mardi Snow, a spokeswoman for the San Diego Museum of Art, where the eggs go on 
display for the first time Thursday night before being shown to the public 
beginning Sunday. "Obviously, that would threaten the security of the eggs. We 
can tell you that we'll have plenty of extra security on board." 
</P>
<P>
Extra security, in this case, is provided by the local branch of a national 
firm, Wells Fargo Guard &amp; Investigative Services. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the value of the eggs, Hansel (Skip) Crawford, a spokesman for 
Wells Fargo, said, with awe-struck reverence: "We're not talking tens of 
millions of dollars here. We're talking hundreds of millions of dollars. So, 
yes, our responsibility is huge." 
</P>
<P>
Crawford said his company beat out 169 others in bidding for the right to guard 
the eggs. He said bids were considered more for "thoroughness of protection" 
rather than cost-effectiveness. He said Wells Fargo's work in securing the 1984 
Los Angeles Olympics was a "big factor" in its being chosen to guard the coop. 
</P>
<P>
Hause, of the Cleveland Museum of Art, said San Diego itself underwent 
"intensive screening" by everyone willing to offer up an egg, and that, "on all 
counts, they came up solid." 
</P>
<P>
Like everyone interviewed for the article, Hause declined to discuss details 
about the exhibit but did offer insight into what his museum does. 
</P>
<P>
"This is pretty common knowledge, so I don't think I'm giving away too much," 
he said. "We have in our place motion alarms, movement alarms. . . . If you 
subtly shake the display without touching it, an alarm will go off. We have 
alarms attached to screws. Try to unscrew something, and a whole set of alarms 
go off. We have fire alarms. We have armed-response within seconds. I assume 
San Diego has all of the same, and maybe more. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of loaning these (eggs) to the festival, I supervised every aspect of 
storage, transport and display and was satisfied all the way." 
</P>
<P>
Then, having said that, Hause stopped short of endorsing the Wells Fargo crew. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the biggest firm of their kind in the country," he said, "and 
generally, they have a good reputation. But I've worked with some good Wells 
Fargo guards, and I've worked with some pretty bad ones." 
</P>
<P>
Hause said Faberge eggs pose a problem in meeting three criteria of what art 
executives call a worst-case scenario: 
</P>
<P>
"You consider their value, their size and their notoriety," he said, "and that 
makes them the highest risk possible. You might have a Van Gogh or a Rembrandt 
stolen, but, because of their size, they're not the easiest items to take." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the eggs on display in San Diego come from the private collection of 
Malcolm Forbes, two are from Queen Elizabeth and one -- the so-called pine cone 
egg -- belongs to Padres owner Joan Kroc. The others come from museums in New 
Orleans and, of course, Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
"You can bet none of those people would be willing to part with those eggs 
without complete assurances that they would be fully protected at all times," 
Hause said. "We checked out San Diego's electronic surveillance, their 
closed-circuit technology, their sprinkler systems, their fire prevention. . . 
. There was an unending checklist, and they came up near the top on every one." 
</P>
<P>
Hause said he worried more about earthquake damage than any other factor. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you guard against that?" he said. "The possibility of an earthquake in 
California is very real, so we tried to take precautions in the actual display 
to guard against damage. But, with quakes, especially big ones, you just don't 
know." 
</P>
<P>
Hause declined to say how many guards will be on hand in San Diego, but he 
offered a "museum rule of thumb: In some places, you have as few as six guards, 
as many as 700. Generally, you have two guards for every three galleries, 24 
hours a day, and that includes exhibits like this." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent DiGiorgio, director of security for the New Orleans Museum of Art, from 
which several eggs came, said he accompanied his curator's collection to San 
Diego and was "most satisfied with all the arrangements." 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I liked the best about them," he said, "is that they promised to 
keep everything very tight-lipped. And they have." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Kimpton, director of security for the San Diego Museum of Art, did not 
return phone calls. A spokeswoman said he would have "no comment." 
</P>
<P>
Don Garson, a spokesman for Forbes Inc., said by telephone from New York that 
his boss -- industrialist Malcolm Forbes -- owns a dozen Faberge eggs, the 
least expensive of which costs "slightly under $2 million." 
</P>
<P>
Garson said that a security staff, headed by a former FBI agent, guards the 
eggs "around the clock" in the Forbes building. He said Forbes' security chief 
went to San Diego to inspect arrangements and was "completely satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
He said San Diego is providing "ample" insurance coverage through a number of 
carriers, although he conceded that insurance, in case of theft, "only lessens 
the pain, because such items are priceless." He, like everyone else, declined 
to name specific carriers or give a dollar amount. 
</P>
<P>
Herring, the executive director of the festival, said the festival-wide 
liability policy is worth $10 million with premiums that cost organizers about 
$41,000. 
</P>
<P>
He said the total budget for the festival is $6 million, half of which comes 
from the city's hotel room tax. He declined to say how much of the $6 million 
is allocated for security. 
</P>
<P>
But $663,000 of the budget is earmarked for the art museum alone. Herring said 
individual institutions are responsible for the security of all individuals and 
objects housed in their quarters during the festival. He acknowledged that, 
more than anything, it's the eggs that have people nervous. 
</P>
<P>
At least one man in San Diego is skeptical about security for the Faberge 
exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen L. Gardella, who formerly worked with the San Diego Police Department 
and as chief of security for Pacific Southwest Airlines, said he was 
interviewed by the art museum but not hired as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm talking like an armchair quarterback, but I think they're doing a 
lot of things wrong," Gardella said. "They should be using metal detectors (to 
screen guests entering the exhibit). As far as I know, they're not doing that. 
They should be using X-ray equipment, and they're not doing that." 
</P>
<P>
Art museum spokeswoman Snow refused to confirm or deny details, but did say the 
egg exhibit will have its own entrance, apart from the museum in general, and 
that "all packages will be checked thoroughly." 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. Keith Enerson of the San Diego Police Department said his staff is 
"working closely" with everyone at the art museum and with organizers in 
general. He said, however, that none of his officers will be involved in 
"hands-on" duty during the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
"And now I can't say any more," Enerson said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is most concerned with Super Powers Sunday, which kicks off the 
festival in Balboa Park this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know whether to expect 10,000 people or 50,000," Enerson said. "So 
it's something that we'll have to play totally by ear." 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Piersol, registrar at the New Orleans Museum of Art, who guards his 
Faberge eggs like a mother hen, said that, as a big exhibit draws near, 
"controversy flies" and everyone worries about security. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is often asked if the "headache" is worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"It can be terribly nerve-wracking the closer it gets," Piersol said. "Your 
nerves are taut. You sleep less. But we expect to sleep well because of all 
that San Diego has done, and believe me, it's a lot."

FIRED HENDERSON EMPLOYEE SAYS AIDE CAMPAIGNED ON CITY TIME; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: EX-STAFFER CLAIMS HER FIRING WAS DUE IN PART TO HER AWARENESS OF TOP 
ASSISTANT'S ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A staff member recently fired by Councilman Bruce Henderson accused Henderson's 
top aide Tuesday of engaging in political campaigning on city time, in 
violation of a City Charter prohibition against such activity by city employees 
during working hours. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Ybarra claimed that she was fired from her position as a council 
representative Friday in part because she became aware that Jim Sills, 
Henderson's top assistant, was conducting strategy sessions on the telephone 
with political consultants for candidate Bob Trettin. 
</P>
<P>
Trettin is attempting to unseat 1st district Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer in 
council elections Nov. 7. Henderson, whose enmity for Wolfsheimer is well 
known, has publicly endorsed Trettin. Ybarra said she had no knowledge of any 
impropriety by Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
But she said that Sills' "head started clicking and maybe (he thought) 'she 
knows too much, and we ought to get rid of her,' " Ybarra said. 
</P>
<P>
Sills and the two political consultants identified by Ybarra -- Jean Andrews 
and Jack Orr -- denied Ybarra's charges. Sills said his political activity on 
Trettin's behalf takes place on nights and weekends, outside City Hall. Orr and 
Andrews concurred, but said some telephone conversations have taken place on 
Sills' lunch hours. 
</P>
<P>
Trettin could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Sills said he is scrupulous about separating political and city activities, 
insisting that Orr, Andrews, Trettin and others discuss political matters with 
him outside City Hall or on his home telephone. He said he has instructed the 
consultants to send politically related mail to his home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scheduling Appearances 
</P>
<P>
He said his only politics-related discussions in City Hall concerned scheduling 
appearances for Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
"Jean Andrews calls this office, and probably all (council) offices a lot," 
Sills said. "She has a lot of clients, and Bob Trettin is one of them." Andrews 
currently is fund raising for Trettin. 
</P>
<P>
Orr said that "Jim is the only guy I know who, if I want to talk to him, I have 
to meet him out in the street. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't been on the 10th floor of City Hall in at least three years," Orr 
added. "I haven't ever been in Bruce Henderson's office." 
</P>
<P>
In a 1985 memorandum, Chief Deputy City Atty. Jack Katz said no city employee 
may campaign during regular city working hours and should not even give the 
appearance of doing so. Even on personal time, Katz said, the employee should 
not use city facilities, equipment or supplies for political activity. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Cristie McGuire, who oversees election matters, said she 
could not comment on Ybarra's claims without more specific information. 
</P>
<P>
Ybarra's accusations came against a backdrop of personal and job-related strife 
with Sills. Ybarra said, and Sills acknowledged that she was fired Friday by 
Henderson, who gave her two weeks to find another position. 
</P>
<P>
Ybarra, a single mother with a 3-year-old son, has been employed primarily to 
answer telephones and open mail since Henderson became a councilman in 
December, 1987. Her current gross salary is $647 every two weeks, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sills said that Ybarra was fired because Henderson wanted "a different person 
with different skills" in her position. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Owes Sills $630 
</P>
<P>
Ybarra acknowledges that she has had battles with Sills over his treatment of 
her in the council office. She also said she owes Sills about $630 that he has 
personally lent her at various times. 
</P>
<P>
She offered as proof of her allegations against Sills a letter written by Orr 
and received in Henderson's office Thursday. The letter, dated Sept. 29, 
carries Henderson's name and asks recipients for contributions to Trettin's 
campaign. In a handwritten note, it asks Sills to call Orr at Orr's office. 
</P>
<P>
Sills said he cannot be held responsible for receiving the letter in 
Henderson's council office and said he admonished Orr to send political 
material to Sills' home. 
</P>
<P>
Orr, who described the letter as "not one of my brighter" actions, said the 
letter went out to Henderson's political contributors this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it was particularly wrong (to send it to Sills' office). But I 
wish I hadn't done it," he said.

QUAYLE MAKES DETOUR AFTER DAY OF SPEECHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle, in San Diego Tuesday night to address a gathering of 
the Big Brothers of America, ended up detouring unexpectedly to the San 
Francisco Bay Area to inspect earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
After his speech at the Town &amp; Country Hotel in Mission Valley, the vice 
president's aides said he would be leaving from North Island Naval Air Station 
for San Francisco at the urging of President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
At the Marriott Hotel in Mission Valley, he addressed a Republican fund-raiser 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Big Brothers speech at the Town &amp; Country, the vice president 
updated the crowd on the earthquake, drawing audible gasps from those in 
attendance when he mentioned that it had registered 6.9 on the Richter scale. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not know what the total damage will be, the loss of life," Quayle said. 
"I know that you, like me and everyone else, will pray for the families and the 
casualties of this disaster that has struck the state of California." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle's seven-hour visit to San Diego included two fund-raisers -- one for 
Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Coronado), the other for the Republican Party, and a 
30-minute interview with KNSD-TV (Channel 39). 
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Quayle touched on a number of issues, ranging from abortion 
and a proposed constitutional amendment to outlaw flag burning to drugs and his 
"growing confidence . . . and satisfaction" with the vice presidency itself. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to define his vision of his job, Quayle said: "My No. 1 responsibility is 
totally loyalty to the President. That is going to remain, no matter what 
happens . . . it's the way that he was with President Reagan, and it's going to 
be that way in the Quayle vice presidency." 
</P>
<P>
The vice president and his entourage left Washington early Monday, raised money 
for Oregon Republicans there, then traveled to San Francisco where he raised 
more money and rallied businessmen to support Sen. Pete Wilson, who is running 
for governor. After speaking to the Town Hall of California at the Century 
Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles, he visited former President Reagan, then flew to 
San Diego for the next speech. Private fund-raising meetings were held along 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
Aides said there was no way to calculate how much Quayle raised on this trip, 
one of several he has made to Los Angeles since his inauguration nine months 
ago. But figures gathered before this swing showed that Quayle has thus far 
raised almost $9 million, three times the amount raised by Bush during his 
first year as vice president, an aide said. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan stop reunited two men who are more ideological soul mates than 
either is with Bush, and Quayle appeared clearly at ease with Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
In brief comments after the meeting, Quayle described the session as "very 
good." 
</P>
<P>
"We talked a lot about his upcoming trip to Japan," said Quayle. "I was just 
there, and we talked about some of the people he was going to be meeting . . . 
. Most of the conversation was focused on Japan and just some general social 
conversation." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, who leaves Thursday for a speaking tour of Japan, did not attend 
Quayle's Los Angeles Town Hall address, which took place next door to the 
former President's office. But he would not have been displeased by the 
speech's content. 
</P>
<P>
The vice president praised the protests of East Germans who have taken to the 
streets to seek more democratic government. 
</P>
<P>
"Last night, 120,000 people demonstrated for freedom in Leipzig, East Germany," 
he said. "Their call for freedom is eloquent, and it deserves our strong 
support. . . . We must remember, however, that freedom's success is never 
assured. Poland is one road, the hopeful road for others to follow. Tian An Men 
Square is another road." 
</P>
<P>
As he has repeatedly, the vice president cautioned Americans not to make too 
much of recent liberal moves by the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"Although this is a time of hope, it is no time for complacency," said Quayle, 
who defended the U.S. military presence in several parts of the world, 
including the Philippines and Korea. 
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, this is a time to recognize that the world remains a very 
dangerous place." Quayle's travels and the continual speech making have left 
him more relaxed on the political stump than he was at this time last year, 
when reporters hung on his every gaffe. 
</P>
<P>
Only one was readily apparent Tuesday -- when he greeted the crowd of 
"distinguished ladies and gentlemens" -- and the vice president even inspired a 
little laughter, if not much applause. Asked, for example, whether the U.S. 
should pressure the Japanese to increase their defense spending, Quayle offered 
a droll remark: 
</P>
<P>
"Before we get carried away and encourage Japan to rearm -- let's stop and 
think about it," he said. The audience, clearly thinking about Pearl Harbor, 
laughed.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN PASQUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Caltrans workers discovered a 63-year-old Escondido man who spent more than 24 
hours at the foot of a 100-foot embankment after his vehicle swerved off 
California 78 in the San Pasqual Valley on Monday, a San Diego police spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Edgar Prado was found at 9:45 a.m. Tuesday and taken to Palomar Hospital 
complaining of chest and back pains, according to spokesman David Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
Prado's vehicle reportedly swerved from the westbound lanes of California 78 
near the 30.5-mile marker to avoid an animal and plunged down a 100-foot 
embankment at 7 a.m., Cohen said. The vehicle did not overturn and came to rest 
against some rocks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the discovery of Prado was a fluke because Caltrans workers were not 
scheduled to work in the area until Sunday.

An ugly chapter in history is continuing to unfold in our country. Our 
congressional "leaders" jumped again onto the greed bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
In acceding again to special interests they decided to give big tax breaks to 
the mainly wealthy and to put more of our elderly into financial and emotional 
turmoil by cutting back catastrophic care benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Albeit our senators appear to be less inclined to jump on the greed wagon, they 
are certainly pushing it firmly. Leadership is failing our country as 
politicians continually bend to dollar-dictated ideas rather than humanistic 
ideals.

BAKER LOOKS AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III has offered the most comprehensive and 
optimistic view of Soviet-American relations to come from the Bush 
Administration so far. To paraphrase, he peered into the Soviet future and 
decided it may work. He also declared that this country's best interests lie in 
helping make it work, where help is feasible without interfering in Soviet 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics about both the intentions and the chances for survival of Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his reform movement will quarrel with much 
of what Baker said to the Foreign Policy Association in New York Monday. But as 
a whole, his view is balanced and reasonable, a sturdy foundation on which to 
build American policies for dealing with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"We now have an historic opportunity with the Soviet Union," Baker said in one 
passage. "We have the chance to leave behind the ups and downs of the Cold War. 
We can move beyond containment to make the change toward better superpower 
relations more secure and less reversible." 
</P>
<P>
Baker's speech was both an analysis of change in the Soviet Union and Eastern 
Europe and a report on impressions formed since last summer, particularly 
during his long series of meetings with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze. To the extent that it was intended also to rebut claims, chiefly 
from Democrats, that the Bush Administration is only vaguely aware of the scope 
and magnitude of the changes and too timid to do much about them, it was a 
success. 
</P>
<P>
The analysis was not all sweetness and light. Baker criticized the Soviet Union 
for stalling on total withdrawal from regional trouble spots in which the 
superpowers are on opposing sides. Arms shipments to Afghanistan and Ethiopia 
are increasing, he said, and shipments to Cambodia have doubled during the past 
year. And while Gorbachev speaks of cutting the Soviet defense budget, he said, 
and of turning swords into plowshares, Washington still sees no concrete 
results. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Baker speech went farther than the Administration had gone before in 
linking Soviet domestic reforms with changes in its foreign policy that are 
"more advantageous to our interests." One task of American foreign policy, he 
said, is to search out converging interests and do what it can to help domestic 
Soviet reforms along. ". . . We want perestroika, including the restructuring 
of Soviet-American relations, to succeed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said expanded trade will take time because it must be strictly 
cash-and-carry. Most-favored-nation status must wait, he said, until the 
Soviets codify their emigration policies. 
</P>
<P>
But Baker said the United States could start at once to help the Soviets 
through the "uncharted waters" of market incentives, competition and pricing by 
helping them build a statistical base, create a consumer price index and advise 
them on other economic reforms, as requested. That may not sound momentous, but 
at a minimum it would spare Soviet visitors the embarrassment of having to base 
discussions of their economy on Central Intelligence Agency figures. It is an 
offer to help, and with the Cold War still so vivid a memory, the thought alone 
counts for something.

A GAP THAT, SADLY, MUST BE FILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been 25 years since construction of Interstate 710, the Long Beach 
Freeway, was halted due to opposition in South Pasadena. The result is a 
six-mile gap in a heavily-traveled corridor that other cities in the San 
Gabriel Valley want eliminated. Completing the freeway will have a sadly 
disruptive effect on South Pasadena, but it must be finished. 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Transporation is currently preparing the latest 
version of an environmental impact report that it must provide to the Federal 
Highway Administration in order to get money to complete the freeway. Currently 
the freeway ends at the San Bernardino Freeway and Valley Boulevard, on the Los 
Angeles-Alhambra border. If completed, it will reach the interchange of 
Interstate 210 and State Highway 134 in Pasadena. The cost of closing this 
freeway gap is estimated at between $500 million and $1 billion, depending on 
whether one talks to its proponents or critics. 
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth environmental report that Caltrans has prepared on the 
freeway gap. Among other issues, it deals with the objections of 
preservationists who oppose the freeway because it will eliminate historic 
districts. The original route would have destroyed more than 100 historic 
homes. Caltrans has realigned the freeway to eliminate only 52 such homes, a 
more manageable number should their owners decide to move them. 
</P>
<P>
One benefit to the long delay in completing the freeway is that engineers have 
learned more about how to mitigate the effects of highway projects in the 
meantime. In planning to complete the freeway, Caltrans has tried to take into 
account the fears of South Pasadena residents, who worry about losing the 
small-town ambience of their city. So the roadway will be submerged below 
ground-level, and a tunnel will be bored at one point to avoid disrupting 
activities at South Pasadena High School. Automobiles will be alloted only 
three lanes in each direction, with one of the three reserved for vans and 
carpools. The remainder of the roadway will be devoted to mass transit, 
including a busway to link up with the existing busway on the San Bernardino 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents claim that closing the freeway gap may actually exacerbate traffic 
problems by generating new traffic, but they are not persuasive. New highways 
may generate more traffic in still-developing areas, but there is not much room 
for new growth around the freeway gap. In fact, an analysis by the Southern 
California Assn. of Governments suggests that closing the gap will simply 
relieve congestion that already exists, primarily on the surface streets where 
traffic from the unfinished freeway currently winds up. And cars moving along a 
highway generate less air pollution than they do in stop-and-go traffic. 
Closing the freeway gap could also reduce some truck traffic on Interstate 5, 
and relieve congestion on freeways as far away as Glendale and Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly the heady era of unhindered freeway construction is over, and this 
region must look to other solutions for its transportation problems, 
particularly mass transit. But even mass transit must follow the configuration 
of existing highways, because they determine where people live and work. The 
inclusion of mass transit in plans for the Long Beach Freeway gap is evidence 
that the highway's final leg is not just a convenience for a few drivers, but 
part of a regional transportation system that extends far beyond South 
Pasadena. If that system is to operate at peak efficiency, the gap must be 
closed.

PRO-CHOICE IS WINNING POLITICAL WAR; 
</P>
<P>
ABORTION: VICTORIES IN CONGRESS, FLORIDA AND PUBLIC OPINION ADD TO THE TALLY. 
AND CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS ARE LISTENING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY B. FRIEDMAN, Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Sherman Oaks) is 
chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means subcommittee on health. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How quickly the abortion winds have shifted. Last July, the U.S. Supreme Court 
approved state restrictions on abortion in a decision that left the landmark 
Roe vs. Wade decision in tatters. Three months later, the pro-choice movement 
achieved its most sweeping political victories in decades by defeating abortion 
restrictions in Florida and reversing longstanding, rigid congressional limits 
on publicly funded abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the White House has said that President Bush will veto the bill to 
relax restrictions on funding abortions for poor women, its proponents were 
heartened by the fact that that they had 50 more votes than last year. 
</P>
<P>
In California, the same powerful forces are at work. When the Legislature 
reconvenes in January, pro-choice legislators will likely defeat every bill to 
restrict abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence of a massive political shift favoring abortion rights in California is 
overwhelming. In a September special Assembly election, voters in conservative 
San Diego and Riverside counties replaced the deceased author of California's 
parental consent abortion law with a pro-choice Republican. At the same time, 
Orange County's conservative Sen. John Seymour, who is seeking the Republican 
nomination for lieutenant governor, switched his position on abortion to 
pro-choice. So did Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia). 
</P>
<P>
With these new votes, pro-choice is the majority view in both the Assembly and 
state Senate. This means that next year, for the first time, our Legislature 
will probably vote to fully fund abortions for poor women. Already this year, 
the Assembly approved Medi-Cal funded abortions by a 39-32 vote; though the 
Senate voted 21 to 19 against funding, the result will be reversed next year 
when Seymour and Davis cast their ballots. 
</P>
<P>
This dramatic political change is due in part to the awakening of the 
pro-choice movement, which in the past took for granted the right to abortion 
established in Roe vs. Wade. More significant, though, is that Americans do not 
like government telling them what to do with their private lives. 
</P>
<P>
Most people recognize that the decision whether to have a child is personal. It 
ought to be a family decision; it is often a medical decision, and for most it 
is a religious or moral decision -- but it is not a government decision. By 
successfully and properly framing the debate as a question of a woman's choice, 
abortion rights advocates have found a way to appeal to moderates and 
conservatives who are uncomfortable with pro-abortion rhetoric. One need not be 
pro-abortion to be pro-choice. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this, California legislators opposed to abortion are certain to test 
the post-Webster waters by introducing a variety of bills aimed at establishing 
a waiting period before an abortion can be performed; requiring fetal viability 
tests and imposing rigid standards on abortion clinics. If abortion opponents 
do pursue such a strategy, however, they risk the same devastating defeat 
suffered last week by their allies in Florida, where Gov. Bob Martinez, who 
proposed similar abortion restrictions, has been so weakened that he could be 
voted out of office next year. 
</P>
<P>
The votes in Congress and the Florida Legislature mostly reflect the careful 
reading by elected representatives of this shifting popular opinion. To some, 
it might seem like opportunism. In reality, it is democracy in action. Of 
course, many California legislators will cast their abortion votes, pro or con, 
for moral reasons, regardless of their constituents' views. But a decisive 
number will vote purely as representatives of the people who elected them. 
</P>
<P>
One other factor favors the pro-choice position. In the past, some legislators 
voted against state-funded abortions for the poor in the belief that the courts 
would strike down such restrictions. They calculated that they could please the 
anti-abortionists without having to live with the prospect of back-alley 
illegal abortions for the poor. They can no longer absolutely count on the 
courts to bail them out, though it is still unlikely that the California 
Supreme Court will reverse its decisions establishing a right to abortion here. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court decision against womens' right to choose abortion may 
end up strengthening abortion rights. Undoubtedly in many states the Webster 
decision will have its intended effect. But in California, as last week in 
Florida and in Congress, pro-choice advocates have never been stronger.

TOO MUCH BORROWED IS MAKING US BLUE; 
</P>
<P>
WALL STREET: THE DICE ARE NO LONGER HOT AND THE AWFUL TRUTHS ARE BECOMING 
APPARENT TO A NO-LONGER-COMPETITIVE AMERICA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN M. WEBBER, Alan M. Webber is managing editor of the Harvard Business 
Review. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the stock market plunges 190 points in one day -- and 154 points in the 
span of 65 minutes -- on news of a bad deal gone awry, then something more than 
just that one deal is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
And when, after a weekend of international telephone calls and global 
handholding, the market rallies by 88 points, with blue chips climbing, more 
stocks losing than gaining overall and troubled junk bonds sinking -- then that 
same something is still wrong. 
</P>
<P>
What's wrong is no secret: We are living on borrowed time. These are days of 
phony, soap-bubble prosperity. Wall Street is America's Potemkin village. A 
paper-thin veneer of economic well-being covers over the deep structural 
problems of an economy burdened by too little real productivity and too much 
assumed debt. 
</P>
<P>
The gyrations of the stock market only serve to remind us of what we already 
know. That's why the slightest whiff of smoke can so easily spook the crowd to 
rush for the exits. 
</P>
<P>
As in any gambling casino, as long as the dice are hot, no one wants to be the 
first one out. And once they go cold, no one wants to be the last one in. Call 
Americans greedy if you will, but they are not stupid. And in our hearts and 
stomachs, we know the hard, uneasy truth: Our companies are not meeting the 
test of global competitiveness; our prosperity is borrowed, not earned. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows this better than American managers. According to the results of a 
survey of Harvard Business Review readers, which will appear in the 
November-December issue, top managers think that they are the cause of 
America's serious, and worsening, competitiveness problem. A full 96% say that 
the United States is falling behind our Asian rivals; of that number, 85% say 
the problem is getting worse, not better. Sixty-two percent say that their own 
industries have a competitiveness problem; of those, 90% say it is getting 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
One solution, endorsed by 74% of those readers surveyed, is a sliding scale on 
capital gains, with a rate as high as 50% on short-term investments and as low 
as zero on investments held for 10 years or more. 
</P>
<P>
The message is clear: We need to begin to remedy this out-of-whack market, 
fueled by takeover excesses, that both terrorizes companies and mortgages the 
country's economic future. 
</P>

It's a message that needs to extend beyond the borders of Wall Street. Before 
there even was a United States, there was a saying: "He that goes a-borrowing 
goes a-sorrowing." On the same day that the stock market rebounded enough for 
Americans to breathe a collective sigh of relief, the federal government missed 
the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings target for reducing the grotesquely bloated federal 
budget deficit, triggering an automatic across-the-board cut. The United States 
remains the world's largest debtor, depending on Japan, our arch-competitor, 
for 30% of our debt financing. The trade deficit with Japan defies the 
devaluation of the dollar against the yen -- while invisibly reducing 
American's standard of living. And as individuals the American people remain at 
the bottom of the list of savers among the industrialized nations of the world. 
</P>
<P>
We are consuming, borrowing and leveraging ourselves into competitive decline. 
The question is, if we all know what the problem is, when will we get to work 
on the remedy? Only after the Wall Street bubble finally bursts?

Advanced Marketing Services The San Diego-based supplier of books to the 
discount warehouse industry, including Price Clubs, reported a second-quarter 
profit of $639,000, down 8% from the $693,000 profit the previous year. For the 
six months ended Sept. 30, profit was $827,000, down 32% from the $1.2 million 
net income over the same six months last year. Profits were hurt by lower 
margins and higher administrative expenses, the company said.

Southwestern Bell Corp.: The St. Louis-based telecommunications company's 
third-quarter net income fell 9% from a year ago to $295.3 million. Revenue 
totaled $2.2 billion, down slightly from last year. The results were attributed 
to a franchise tax refund Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. received last year; 
the shift in production of several Yellow Pages directories from the third to 
the fourth quarters; a one-time adjustment to the telephone company's revenue, 
and a rate refund for Missouri customers as part of an agreement between state 
regulators and the telephone company. The factors came despite growth in the 
telephone company's customer access lines.

GTE Corp.: The Stamford, Conn., telecommunications company said third-quarter 
profit was up 18% to an all-time high. Earnings totaled $368 million on revenue 
of $4.4 billion, compared to $313 million on revenue of $4 billion in the same 
period last year. The company said the rise was due to increased use of its 
local telephone networks and strong growth in cellular telephone operations.

Coca-Cola Enterprises: The Atlanta bottler said third-quarter profit fell 68.2% 
due to increased marketing costs, reduced sales volume and the repurchase of 
stock. Earnings totaled $12.7 million on revenue of $1.022 billion, compared to 
$39.9 million on revenue of $1.025 billion in the same period a year ago. The 
bottling company, which was spun off from Coca-Cola Co. in 1986, said volume 
fell about 3%, reflecting the sale of the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of 
Mid-America. The firm also repurchased about 1.2 million shares of common stock 
during the quarter.

Manufacturers Hanover Corp.: The New York bank reported a third-quarter loss of 
$789 million, the result of its previously announced decision to add $950 
million to its loan-loss reserves. This contrasts with net income of $198 
million in last year's third quarter. The firm said its 1989 third-quarter net 
income would have totaled $91 million without the one-time writedown.

record $1.11 billion, a gain of 7%. The results were attributed to higher 
worldwide sales of the company's pharmaceuticals, increased sales of

cough tablets, Rolaids antacid, Lubriderm skin lotion and Efferdent denture 
cleaner and added sales of confectionary products led by Trident sugarless gum.

Wells Fargo &amp; Co.: The San Francisco banking company's third-quarter 
earnings advanced 17% from a year ago to $153.7 million. The provision for loan 
losses was $82 million, up 9%. The results were attributed in part to the solid 
performance of the state's economy and its move to bolster its presence in 
Southern California. During the period, the firm signed definitive agreements 
to buy Valley National Bank of Glendale, Central Pacific Corp. of Bakersfield 
and Torrey Pines Group of Solana Beach.

The Show: RollerGames (11 a.m. Saturday, KTLA) 
</P>
<P>
The Setup: Saturday-morning action that's a hybrid of roller derby and MTV. 
Every week, two of the total six skating teams battle for points. They're 
toughies, with team names that sound like heavy metal bands: The Maniacs, Bad 
Attitude, the Violators, Hot Flash, the T-Birds, the Rockers. There are men's 
as well as a women's squads. If one team can't conquer the other, there's a 
wrestle with real alligators to determine the winner. Half-time entertainment 
is provided by the likes of Debbie Harry, Warrant, Expose and Kool Moe Dee. 
</P>
<P>
The Look: Spandex on skates. Three of the teams (the Violators, Bad Attitude 
and the Maniacs) wear bad-guy basic black with studs, jagged edges or 
disco-queen silver. The other three are the obvious good guys. The T-Birds pose 
as Olympic hopefuls in red, white and blue; the Rockers wear terribly trendy 
animal prints, and Hot Flash goes for hot pink and white. It may sound as if 
they all look different, but the fact is they all look the same -- as if one 
unimaginative aerobics instructor designed six sets of outfits for Monday 
through Saturday. Undoubtedly, costume designer Rob Saduski has quite a range. 
He dressed Madonna, Divine and rockers for music videos before getting into 
this game. Part heavy metal, part mall wear, RollerGames fashions consist of 
bicycle shorts, crop tops and leggings most likely to appeal to those not yet 
old enough for car dates. Slightly more mature home viewers may find sartorial 
inspiration in the bevy of cheerleaders prancing and dancing on the sidelines, 
dressed in what looks like Calvin Klein underwear. 
</P>
<P>
The Labels: All of the competition wear is custom made by Saduski and therefore 
not available in stores. 
</P>
<P>
The Adaptation: The wardrobe components are fairly simple to imitate -- with 
protective knee and elbow pads as optional details. To really pull off the look 
requires more than a few pieces of Spandex. A close personal affiliation, real 
or imagined, with super-heroes or mega-menaces would also help. As would a 
moniker, the kind that seems to be popular with underworld figures and heavy 
weight wrestlers. "Shifty" Condejas, "Deadly Debbie" Van Doren, "Bamm-Bamm" 
May, Paula "The Flea" and "Nasty Nancy" Wilkinson are not available. They've 
already been taken by RollerGames teams. 
</P>
<P>
The Payoff: Sidewalks in Venice and Santa Monica may become more populated with 
rolling trash as a result of RollerGames wannabes. If they go the whole nine 
yards, look out. They'll be dressed to kill. GAILE ROBINSON

OPENING OF PHILHARMONIC CHAMBER SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the less bruited aspects of Andre Previn's tenure as music director of 
the Los Angeles Philharmonic was the development of the Philharmonic Chamber 
Music Society. Previn himself frequently performed on the concerts as pianist, 
making chamber music an important if not often acknowledged part of his 
presence in the community. 
</P>
<P>
Monday the fall series of Philharmonic Chamber Music Society concerts began at 
Gindi Auditorium of the University of Judaism, and there was Previn. There were 
not a lot of musicians on the stage, or a lot of pieces on the program, but it 
proved a surprisingly well-chosen offering. 
</P>
<P>
The music of Brahms is probably not generally considered a Previn specialty, 
although if the matter be considered, a number a strong Previn-led Brahms 
performances come quickly to mind. On this occasion, Previn, violinists Camille 
Avellano and Elizabeth Baker, and cellist Gloria Lum, turned to the First 
Violin Sonata and First Piano Trio. 
</P>
<P>
In the "Regenlied" Sonata, Avellano displayed a technical security and warmth 
of sound that contradicted her generally cautious interpretation. There was 
much simplicity and sincerity in her playing, but not the emotional blossom the 
piece requires for maximum effect. 
</P>
<P>
Avellano and Previn collaborated easily, in a reading of straightforward 
phrasing. Previn's supportive efforts were compromised by a Bosendorfer that 
sounded overly bright and twangy in the lively Gindi acoustic. That was most 
unflatteringly apparent in the heavily buzzing bass at the beginning of the 
Adagio, the movement that had the most obvious mechanical lapses but also the 
least inhibited music making. 
</P>
<P>
The Opus 8 Trio -- even in Brahms' late, compacted revision -- is a work of 
symphonic scope, expansively built and heroic to perform. Baker, Lum and Previn 
approached it with a firm sense of overall direction which did not preclude, 
but rather capitalized on, attention to detail. 
</P>
<P>
The outer movements became serious compilations of collective and individual 
bravado, initiated by Lum's fervent, big-boned opening solo. At first, Baker's 
smooth playing threatened to become lost in the sonic heat -- the Bosendorfer 
lid was fully raised for the Trio, as it was not for the Sonata -- but balances 
were eventually righted. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the Adagio though, that the three musicians found the expressive core 
of the work. The nuance of articulation and varieties of timbre and color 
seemed almost limitless, but there was nothing self-indulgent about their 
application. The playing was finely meshed, in transparent textures. 
</P>
<P>
The Finale ended unfortunately, with a technically stammered passage from 
Baker. It did nothing to undermine the nobility of the achievement, however.

Paul Newman has filed a $5.45-million suit against Home Box Office Inc., 
claiming the cable television giant undersold "Fort Apache, the Bronx" -- the 
New York police drama that Newman made for HBO subsidiary Time-Life Productions 
in 1980 -- so that it could rent out other HBO features. Ronald Rosen, Newman's 
attorney, said HBO charged a rental fee of only $1 million for "Fort Apache" in 
a deal with Procter &amp; Gamble Co. that included 192 other films. Newman 
maintains that the film's true value through licensing was $4 million. The suit 
filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles alleges breach of contract 
and antitrust violations and seeks $5 million in punitive damages, plus 
$450,000 that the actor claims he lost in fees. STEVE WEINSTEIN

Mikis Theodorakis, a former Communist member of the Greek Parliament and the 
composer of the music for the movie "Zorba the Greek," says he's going to run 
for Parliament again, this time on a conservative party ticket. Theodorakis 
resigned his seat in 1986 after 4 1/2 years in office, complaining that his 
presence there had become pointless. He said the turnabout was prompted by the 
slaying of Pavlos Bakoyannis, the spokesman for the New Democracy Party, by the 
extreme left-wing November 17 guerrilla organization.STEVE WEINSTEIN

More changing times: Television cameras recorded the proceedings in Britain's 
House of Commons for the first time Tuesday as legislators returned to work 
from their summer break. But the taping by the eight remote-controlled cameras 
was a dress rehearsal that will be seen only by legislators and TV program 
planners. Regular TV viewers won't get to see the lawmakers in action until the 
Nov. 21 opening of a new session of Parliament. The House of Lords, the 
unelected chamber of Parliament, has permitted the televising of its 
proceedings since January, 1985, and viewers have occasionally glimpsed a lord 
or two soundly asleep in his chair. The often rowdy Commons had until now 
always refused to admit TV cameras. If there is a noisy disruption in the 
Commons either among legislators on the floor of the House or among 
demonstrators in the public gallery, the camera operators have strict orders to 
ignore it and focus only on Speaker Bernard Weatherill. STEVE WEINSTEIN

WOMEN IN FILM FESTIVAL DRAWS INNOVATIVE EUROPEAN ENTRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's never easy to tell the overall impact of a film festival when only a 
handful of entries are around at press-screening time. But, from the relatively 
small sampling available of the 1989 Women in Film Festival, the differences in 
vision between European and American film makers have never seemed as clear-cut 
as they are here. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, European film makers have found ways to get non-mainstream visions 
onto their screens, intact. Allowed the room to experiment, they play with 
magic, with the surreal, with personal "crazy" visions, and their cinema is 
richer for it. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of these notions work; one of the most magic-filled, poetic works in 
the program, the beautiful looking Hungarian film "My 20th Century," is also 
one of its most boggy and impenetrable. Yet, in contrast, almost all the 
American films previewed seem to be strapped into the formula straitjacket, 
overwrought melodramas that yearn for homes on television the way lemmings seek 
the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, the festival's most inventive work is the personal vision 
personified; it's "Joan of Arc of Mongolia," a wickedly delightful look at the 
headlong collision of two cultures by writer-director-producer Ulrike Ottinger 
of West Germany. Using the worldly-wonderful Delphine Seyrig as her compleat 
voyager, widely traveled in every civilized sense of the word, Ottinger 
imagines a mixed group of passengers on the present-day trans-Siberian railway 
who are kidnaped by a young and commanding Mongol princess. Every sort of 
tension exists, sexual, cultural, generational and stylistic. Three of the 
kidnapees are members of the splendid Kalinka Sisters band, a '50s-style 
singing group (fiddle, piano, ukulele/guitar) whose musicianship is as 
formidable as their costuming. Another is the blue-jeaned Giovanna, a beautiful 
young student, who becomes something of a prize between the princess and 
Seyrig. Who could have believed that life in a yurt could hold this many 
temptations? 
</P>
<P>
Sophisticated, mysterious and deliriously beautiful, "Joan of Arc," at 165 
minutes, may be one of those orchids that blooms only at festivals and for far 
too small an audience. If so, this is the time to take a chance on its utter 
unpredictability. If you happen to be especially attuned to costumes or 
jewelry, you could go for those alone, for the princess's attendants in 
scarlet, acid green, pink and turquoise satin, riding camel-back or trotting on 
those short-legged, short-tempered ponies. (One warning: Among these Mongolian 
ceremonial events there is a prolonged ritual sheep-killing that is really 
unbearable to watch. Get a stainless-steel someone to tell you when it's safe 
to look again.) 
</P>
<P>
Best to see veteran Czech film maker Vera Chytilova's "Snowball Reaction" 
without consulting the program notes. Although she seems happy to reveal her 
film's tragic element in advance, no one really should. This crucial story peg 
doesn't emerge until the film's fourth act, but if you expect it, you almost 
want to fast-forward the rest of the film to that moment, thus missing the 
texture of this "La Ronde"-like series of interlocking love affairs by a group 
of playful Czech careerists. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of "Snowball Reaction" depends on the improvisational skill of its young 
ensemble; they are, fortunately, first-rate, but you may (or may not) feel that 
the subject deserves even greater depth. 
</P>
<P>
From Austria comes "Scorpion Woman" by writer-director Susanne Zanke, as 
interesting for the inner workings of the Austrian judicial system as for its 
story, in which a trial being conducted before a striking 44-year-old judge 
(Angelica Domrose) becomes a parallel for her tumultuous personal life. As a 
playfully begun love affair with her 23-year-old law clerk takes a deeper turn, 
the judge begins to empathize with the prisoner, a working-class woman accused 
of partially blinding her young lover. "Scorpion Woman's" conclusion heightens 
its melodrama, making it too neat by far, but it's intriguingly acted 
melodrama. 
</P>
<P>
Lena Wertmuller returns with a story by novelist Giovanni Guareschi, "To Save 
Nine," about a widowed peasant woman with nine children 11 and younger who 
hides their very existence when she rents a garret flat in Bologna from elegant 
landowner Dominique Sanda. Whether this one flies will depend entirely upon the 
character of the indomitable mama who, as played by Piera Degli Esposti, makes 
Giuletta Masina's waif in "La Strada" seem cheerless and cynical. You may 
disbelieve and wish to throttle Esposti, or you may dissolve in tears. In 
either case, Sanda's last seconds are surprisingly affecting. 
</P>
<P>
Next come productions so measured, so numbing in their pacing that nothing the 
well-meaning actors do can save them. Into that category you must put 
"Romelia's Secret," a feature from Mexico by Busi Cortes, which also seems 
badly served by its subtitles, and two American entries, "The Kill-Off," 
adapted from a Jim Thompson story by director-writer Maggie Greenwald, and 
"Face of the Enemy," by director Hassan Ildari, about an ex-Iran hostage who 
stumbles onto and then kidnaps his torturer. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwald's skill would definitely seem to be with actors, not dialogue; her 
twisted noir-style plot comes apart at its seams and sags when it should cut 
like dry ice. There's a kernel of an idea to Ildari's contrived plot: how 
governments use and then abandon their point men and women, but he goes about 
telling it with a leaden hand, a horrific use of flashbacks and the most 
irritating musical score within recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
There is also Lucy Phillips' "Stealing America," a woolly-minded exercise in 
attitude and chic, without heart, point, wit or substance. Somehow, possibly 
because it's in black and white and has three young visiting Europeans as its 
central characters, its brash charmlessness has been compared to the control 
and the rigorous point of view of Jim Jarmusch. Big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Can these be the best that American feature films touched by women have to 
offer? That's simply not possible. Perhaps good things lurk unpreviewed. Let us 
hope so, or either the selection process or the guidelines for submissions need 
drastic overhauling. 
</P>
<P>
The festival will open Thursday night with a tribute to Lee Grant and with her 
dramatic feature "Staying Together," in which she gets a glowing central 
performance from Melinda Dillon and a preciseness of observation about the real 
stuff within families that seems much too rare on the large screen today.

L.A. PANEL OKS $2.1 MILLION TO PAY ALTERNATIVE LANDFILL FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles City Council committee Tuesday approved paying $2.1 million to 
dump debris from city streets and parks in private and public landfills around 
the county for the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
The action by the Budget and Finance Committee was in response to a state order 
issued this summer to reduce to 400 the number of trucks dumping daily at the 
city-operated Lopez Canyon Landfill, in the northeast San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's action must be approved by the full City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city challenged the California Waste Management Board order in 
Superior Court and won a temporary restraining order, city Bureau of Sanitation 
officials said Tuesday that the city attorney recommended that they voluntarily 
comply with the truck limit, which could be used to demonstrate good faith in 
future state and court hearings on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The city is not voluntarily complying with the other limits set down in the 
state order -- including a reduction in the dump's height. On Oct. 27, the City 
Council is scheduled to consider voluntarily complying with all the limits. 
</P>
<P>
The $2.1 million would cover dumping fees for smaller trucks from the Bureau of 
Street Maintenance and the Department of Recreation and Parks, reserving Lopez 
Canyon for larger, fully loaded trucks. The city plans to prepare a new area of 
Lopez Canyon for dumping and will attempt to persuade the state to increase the 
400-truck limit later this year.

AROUND THE VALLEY: 'TONIGHT WE'RE DISCUSSING THE SUBJECT OF UFOS AND THE 
BIBLE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Frank E. Stranges has a unique ministry. His flock is devout, sincere, 
faithful and, some would say, heretical. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight," Stranges solemnly told his congregation one evening, "we're 
discussing the subject of UFOs and the Bible." 
</P>
<P>
And so began the monthly meeting of the National Investigations Committee on 
Unidentified Flying Objects, an organization based in Van Nuys that mixes New 
Age science with Old Testament prophecy. 
</P>
<P>
As Stranges tells it, some UFOs are gifts from God, angelic visitations sent to 
improve the lot of humankind. On this night, Stranges and 25 listeners -- most 
of them older men and women with gray hair and glasses -- talked of God's love 
and aliens in a rented meeting room at a motel in Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see why I'm not invited to the Baptist Convention to talk about this 
thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stranges is president of International Evangelism Crusades, which he described 
as a worldwide ministerial association. A portly man in a silver suit that 
matched his gray hair and beard, he bears a vague resemblance to actor Peter 
Ustinov. 
</P>
<P>
He smiled often, cracked jokes and charmed his audience. Reporters at the 
Soviet news agency Tass, which recently reported that 12-foot-tall aliens 
strolled about a park in Voronezh, would love to interview him. Appropriately, 
he spoke in the rising and falling cadences of a minister, clearly inspiring 
his listeners. 
</P>
<P>
The Bible, he said, records many UFOs -- if one is willing to interpret the 
Scriptures correctly. "You've got to read the Bible with a spiritual mind," he 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
In the Book of Ezekiel the prophet described a flying disc that came from the 
north ("a wheel in the middle of a wheel") and hovered over the land. The color 
was metallic, he said. And although some translations of the Bible describe the 
"eyes" of the apparition, a correct interpretation shows that Ezekiel likened 
these openings to "windows." This "wheel" was no mere vision, Stranges said. It 
was real. It was God's work. It was a spaceship. "Ezekiel saw something," he 
said. "The children of Israel saw something." 
</P>
<P>
When the Jews fleeing Egypt roamed the desert for 40 years, a UFO described as 
a pillar of fire warmed the multitudes at night with its glow. "Above them was 
this giant pillar of fire," Stranges said. "This was not a natural phenomenon, 
this huge spaceship God provided in the wilderness." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout Stranges' monologue the 25 listeners sat quietly, some occasionally 
nodding their heads in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
But although some UFOs are agents of good, Stranges went on, others are agents 
of evil. He posed an ominous question: If you saw a UFO and space creatures 
asked you to come aboard, would you go? 
</P>
<P>
Only a few hands nervously rose. One woman, a practical type, said, "I'd have 
some questions." 
</P>
<P>
Then other hands began to rise, the thought of space travel intoxicating the 
room. Then a few more. Stranges suddenly cut them off. "Careful now!" he 
warned. 
</P>
<P>
"Stand in the light!" a man in the back shouted. "If you stand in the light, 
they leave." 
</P>
<P>
Stranges smiled like a teacher whose pupil took the top prize at the science 
fair. The man in the back understood. Some UFOs are not sent by God, Stranges 
said. Then his jovial mood turned dark. "If they're not of God," he asked, "who 
are they?" 
</P>
<P>
"The devil," someone whispered. 
</P>
<P>
"Satan," Stranges said. 
</P>
<P>
The room was uneasily silent for a moment. But the message from the man in the 
back was reassuring. To defeat darkness one must, metaphorically speaking, 
stand in the light of God, he said. So it is with any evil, be it the evil of 
man or of extraterrestrial. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, it was time for a short break. It was Stranges' birthday, and a cake, 
cookies and punch covered a table at the back. "Happy birthday to you," the 
crowd sang. Stranges smiled modestly. 
</P>
<P>
As quick as he is to declare UFOs real, Stranges will also denounce and expose 
what he says are fakes. Some UFO sightings were not really alien spacecraft, 
for example, but disc-shaped vehicles built by Nazi scientists who fled to 
Patagonia in the waning days of World War II, he says. Stranges says he saw one 
of the Nazi flying machines once in Reno, Nev., and recounts the story in his 
book "Nazi UFO Secrets and Bases Exposed." 
</P>
<P>
The book on Nazi saucers was for sale that night along with paperback books by 
Stranges, including "The UFO Conspiracy" and "Saucerama." The latter, the 
yellow cover noted, was the "revised enlarged fifth edition" of a work 
copyrighted in 1959. A few people browsed among the books as they ate Stranges' 
birthday cake. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Stranges displayed slides and told of unusual events recorded around the 
world. There was the time aliens landed in Finland and, in fluent Finnish, 
asked five boys to bring them water from a lake. As they departed the aliens 
said, "God bless you." Then, Stranges said, their spacecraft turned bright red 
and headed for Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
Don't be fooled by bogus sightings of UFOs, Stranges warned his listeners. 
Study the Bible and you will know the truth. "Ye shall know the truth," he 
said, "and the truth shall set you . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"Free!" the congregation chorused. 
</P>
<P>
Some would call this crowd wacko. Space cadets all. But it was clear that 
Stranges' listeners, who barely spoke all night, were looking for something to 
fill their lives and souls. They did not desert their church in their search, 
but expanded the scope. Now they looked to the stars. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd stood as Stranges led a prayer, their arms raised in praise, their 
voices echoing his words. As the prayer drew to a close he said, "Help me to be 
of service to You . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Help me to be of service to You. 
</P>
<P>
 "...and to my fellow man." 
</P>
<P>
 And to my fellow man. 
</P>
<P>
 "God bless you all."

TEEN-AGERS' ATTACKER FOUND GUILTY OF ATTEMPTED MANSLAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Granada Hills mental patient was found guilty of two counts of attempted 
voluntary manslaughter Tuesday for bludgeoning two teen-agers with a hammer as 
they sat on a curb near his house on a summer night. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel M. Greller argued that Rudolfo Aguero, 34, should be 
convicted of attempted murder for hitting Kelly McClure, 19, and Jackson P. 
Utley, 18, on the head several times with a hammer in July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But San Fernando Superior Court Judge John P. Farrell decided that the crime 
occurred in the "heat of passion," as a result of Aguero's schizophrenia. The 
judge ruled that Aguero did not fully understand what he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
"I find he manifested an intent to kill, but it was a sudden intent to kill at 
the time of his swinging," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
In his confession, Aguero said a voice had told him that young people were 
laughing at him, so he got a hammer and went outside, Los Angeles Police 
Detective George Daley testified during the three-week non-jury trial. 
</P>
<P>
When he saw McClure and Utley, he struck them repeatedly with the hammer 
because he thought that they were laughing at him, Daley said. 
</P>
<P>
Public Defender Nelda K. Barrett said Aguero should have been convicted of 
assault with a deadly weapon because he did not say in his confession that he 
wanted to kill the teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Aguero faces a maximum sentence of 11 1/2 years in prison for voluntary 
manslaughter. Had he been convicted of attempted murder, he could have been 
sentenced to life in prison. Sentencing is scheduled Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
"Considering that Jack and I are going to have to deal with what happened to us 
for the rest of our lives, 11 1/2 years doesn't seem very substantial," McClure 
said. 
</P>
<P>
McClure said she cannot stand on her feet for long periods of time and must 
walk with braces because of her injuries from the attack. Utley said he has 
lost much of his memory and has limited feeling in his hands and right leg. 
</P>
<P>
The two teen-agers, who are sweethearts, attended the trial every day with 
their parents.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOULD-BE RAPIST FLEES AFTER VICTIM BITES HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who broke into a Burbank house and attempted to rape a woman inside fled 
after the woman bit his hand, the Burbank Police Department reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old woman was awakened about 5:30 a.m. Sunday by a man who sat on 
top of her in her bed and held his left hand over her mouth while brandishing 
an 8-inch kitchen knife in his right hand, Sgt. Don Goldberg said. The man 
brought the knife close to her neck and told her "Don't do anything," Goldberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The man fled through the front door of the house and drove off in a silver-gray 
Ford Bronco after the woman bit his left hand, kicked him and screamed for 
help, Goldberg said. He had entered the house in the 1300 block of West Alameda 
Avenue through an unlocked kitchen window, police said. 
</P>
<P>
During the struggle, the woman suffered a cut to her lower lip, but she 
declined medical treatment, Goldberg said. The woman told police that her bite 
broke the skin on the man's hand, but he did not appear to be seriously 
injured. "By her actions, she probably prevented herself from being raped or 
possibly killed," Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
The man is described as being in his mid-30s, about 6 feet tall, weighing 165 
to 180 pounds with thick, curly, collar-length hair. The woman told police he 
spoke with an accent and appeared to be Middle Eastern or Asian.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LEASE OF 6-ACRE SITE AT VAN NUYS AIRPORT OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A development company's plan to lease nearly six acres at Van Nuys Airport was 
approved Tuesday by the Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
On an 11-0 vote, the council agreed to allow Retlaw Development to use the land 
for an airport plaza that is to include corporate headquarters, a hangar for 
corporate aircraft, a parking lot, a restaurant and an aviation support 
services office. 
</P>
<P>
Minimum rent on the land was set at $305,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Board of Airport Commissioners deleted restrictions on the number 
and type of aircraft allowed on the new airport plaza, despite complaints by 
nearby residents about the potential for increased noise. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the board asked city staff to submit recommendations of ways to 
regulate aircraft and minimize noise at all of the city's airports.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUPERVISORS OK $1.5-MILLION EXPANSION OF JUVENILE 
HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County supervisors approved a $1.5-million expansion Tuesday at the 
overcrowded San Fernando Juvenile Hall in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
The dormitories have a present population of 560 in an area meant for 393. The 
county Probation Department accommodates the overflow by placing mattresses on 
the floor of recreation areas. 
</P>
<P>
The project will add two prefabricated portable buildings, each with space for 
30 minors 14 to 16 years old awaiting a court date or placement elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Up to six additional staff members will also be added. 
</P>
<P>
The new dormitories of 3,440 square feet each will be placed in the southwest 
corner of the parking lot. Officials in the Probation Department hope to have 
the new units open by February. 
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to return to the board later this month so supervisors 
can approve a contract with the building manufacturer.

CLU GIVES WESTMONT A SCARE, 3-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a typical freshman mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently Alberto Gutierrez didn't realize that when the Cal Lutheran soccer 
team fell two goals behind the top-ranked team in the nation late in the second 
half it was time to go into the tank. 
</P>
<P>
No, with typical freshman vigor, he leaped high for a Larry Gidley pass near 
the goal and headed it in to pull Cal Lutheran (7-5-1) within a goal of 
visiting Westmont College (12-1-3) with five minutes remaining in Tuesday's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez's goal made the final score 3-2, but CLU managed to throw a scare 
into Westmont, tied for first in the National Assn. of Intercollegiate 
Athletics soccer poll with Rockhurst College of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably safe to say they play us as tough as anybody has played us all 
year," Westmont Coach Bob Fortosis said. "It's obvious we played pretty flat, 
but I don't know if it was because of their effort or because we came in 
cocky." 
</P>
<P>
Westmont jumped to a 1-0 lead and controlled the ball throughout the first 
half, but Cal Lutheran managed to scratch out a 1-1 first-half tie. Dave 
Rinehart kicked the ball into the right corner where Gidley tracked it down and 
crossed it to Casey Pirih, who drilled a line drive past diving goalie David 
Buehring for Cal Lutheran's goal. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the second half, Westmont's Justin Wall scored his second goal of the 
game when he hit the right post, rebounded his own shot and buried it in the 
net. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Avery scored minutes later to give Westmont a 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But Cal Lutheran refused to quit. 
</P>
<P>
"You expect that of them," Coach George Kuntz said. "Playing the No. 1 team in 
the nation, the players responded well." 
</P>
<P>
With only two more District 3 matches left, CLU needed a victory to improve its 
playoff hopes. Now, the Kingsmen (3-3-1 in district play) will have to beat Cal 
Baptist and Fresno Pacific to assure themselves of one of the five playoff 
berths.

HOW BROKERAGES MAY FARE AS ERA OF TAKEOVERS ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The worst didn't happen. The demons of Friday the 13th didn't consume Wall 
Street. As the market further stabilized Tuesday, many traders concluded, along 
with New York Stock Exchange Chairman John J. Phelan, that last week's plunge 
in stock prices was no more than a market "squall." 
</P>
<P>
But if the investment world has avoided calamity, last week's drop and the 
turmoil in the takeover game that brought it on have left Wall Street facing a 
far different -- and probably more difficult -- situation. 
</P>
<P>
The fast-money takeover game that uncapped a gusher of fees and other earnings 
for Wall Street this decade seems to be on the wane. The shock of a 190-point 
drop in the Dow Jones industrial index dealt a new blow to the confidence of 
the average American investor. And not a few market gurus have forecast that 
the plunge will bring an end, at long last, to the seven-year bull market. 
</P>
<P>
The upshot: Wall Street's big investment banks and retail brokerages, which 
have already shrunk their staffs by 12% since the crash of 1987, may face new 
rounds of job cutbacks and consolidations in the months ahead. And the 
investment world is likely to face a change in tone as a decade dominated by 
the colorful personalities of the highly leveraged takeover game gives way to a 
new era. 
</P>
<P>
"The great and glorious days of the '80s may not be over," says Robert Kavesh, 
finance and economics professor at New York University. "But we seem close to a 
turning point." 
</P>
<P>
James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer and a critic of heavy 
borrowing, put it more forcefully. "An era is ending; another is beginning," he 
said. "Those in the highest esteem will be toppled, and the most humble will 
rise again." 
</P>
<P>
The development of the highly leveraged takeovers reshaped Wall Street in the 
'80s. With heavy borrowing, deal makers could arrange takeovers that in earlier 
years wouldn't have been viable, and that created jobs for scores of investment 
bankers, stock speculators, takeover lawyers, proxy solicitors, public 
relations firms and more. 
</P>
<P>
The recent turmoil in the junk bond market, however, is expected to mean fewer 
takeovers overall and more deals of the kind that are less profitable for the 
investment banks. The deals will be done as swaps of both companies' stock, or 
with more cash and less debt. 
</P>
<P>
This change would cut into the profits of the big investment banks in several 
ways. The firms receive fees for the deals they arrange and for underwriting 
the junk bonds that are key to financing them. 
</P>
<P>
In the past four years, too, the investment banks have profited handsomely by 
putting up their own money for the deals. And the firms have arbitrage 
departments that speculate in the takeover stocks that have been so important 
in driving the market. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the largest investment banks derive about 50% of their profits from 
merger-related activities; several derive 20% of their pretax profits from the 
takeovers called leveraged buyouts alone. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything that jeopardizes that business would have a very material impact on 
their bottom line," says Samuel L. Hayes III, a Harvard University professor of 
investment banking. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the investment banks may also be at risk in some of the takeover deals 
they have already financed with "bridge" loans. These are short-term loans made 
to clients until they can arrange longer-term financing by, for example, 
issuing junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
But questions about the wisdom of some of these loans have emerged since 
September, when Campeau Corp. ran into trouble paying off bridge loans for its 
purchase of Federated Department Stores. Investment banks including First 
Boston, Paine Webber and Dillon, Read &amp; Co. have $400 million invested in 
the Campeau bridge loan. 
</P>
<P>
James E. Cayne, president of the Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. investment bank, 
predicts that "an awful lot of firms are going to see reduced revenues" from 
the investment of their own money in takeover deals and are going to pull back 
from such deals in the future. 
</P>
<P>
As for the possibility of losses, "the jury's still out," says Cayne, whose 
firm has avoided such deals as too risky. "They could be substantial." 
</P>
<P>
A managing director of one Wall Street firm predicted that investment banks 
will be forced to make painful cuts in their mergers and acquisitions staff 
because of the expected slowdown in takeover activity. The last big contraction 
for merger professionals came in the early 1970s, he said, when a typical 
investment bank had about 2,000 employees, including several dozen in the 
mergers and acquisition department. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, the big firms employ 8,000 to 10,000, including merger teams that 
run to 400 professionals. "Nobody's had any experience in how you shrink these 
operations," he said, adding that it would be a "shock" for many employees to 
see how sharply compensation will be reduced if the takeover market doesn't 
revive. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer takeover deals would likely also sharpen competition among investment 
banks for the deals that remain. In turn, that is expected to cut many fees. 
</P>
<P>
Dwindling takeover activity would most affect the dozen or so largest 
investment firms and would have much less of an effect on the smaller and 
regional stock brokerages that make up the rest of the investment industry. 
</P>
<P>
But all firms that make money from selling stock to individuals are likely to 
feel the impact on confidence of last Friday's market spill. Though the worst 
did not take place, the recurrence of such huge drops has persuaded many lay 
investors that there is no logic or safety in the crap shoot of the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"More individual investors will come to believe that direct participation is 
something they should avoid, and that if they're going to buy stock they should 
do it through mutual funds," says Perrin Long, who analyzes Wall Street firms 
for Lipper Analytical Services. 
</P>
<P>
One signal of tough times facing Wall Street is in the continuing fall of the 
prices of seats on the New York Stock Exchange. On Tuesday a seat sold for 
$436,000, the lowest price since one sold for $425,000 in 1985. Because of 
generally low trading volume and scarcer commission dollars, exchange seats 
have lost more than half their value after peaking at $1.15 million on Sept. 
21, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The investment industry, as represented by members of the NYSE, have cut their 
employment by 31,700 since the strike, or about 12%. Some analysts believe that 
cuts of another 10% to 15% could be ahead if a bear stock market combines with 
a sharp reduction in takeover activity. 
</P>
<P>
Even the gloomiest observers expect to see new financial trends soon supplant 
the fading fads of the '80s on Wall Street. But the leaders of the new age are 
not likely to be the leveraged buyout specialists, takeover lawyers and 
corporate raiders who have shone so brightly in the popular imagination in this 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
"Soon people won't even remember those guys' names," says Sharon J. Kalin, 
president of the Athene-Coronado Management arbitrage firm. "The fact is, 
they've already been deposed."

BUSH TO RELAX ANTITRUST LAW, SOURCES CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL BLUSTEIN and EVELYN RICHARDS, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Top Bush Administration officials plan to propose a significant relaxation of 
antitrust law that would make it easier for rival U.S. companies to manufacture 
products jointly, according to Administration sources. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is based on the theory -- disputed by some experts -- that by 
operating factories jointly, American companies would perform better against 
foreign competition, especially in capital-intensive, high-technology 
industries such as robotics, semiconductors and high-definition TV. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Commerce and Justice departments are spearheading the 
proposal, and only a few details remain to be debated by senior policy-makers, 
the sources said. "There is a consensus" on the approach, one official said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal's backers hope that it will strongly encourage American companies 
to band together in manufacturing consortia similar to U.S. Memories, the 
fledgling association of companies that is being formed to jointly produce the 
computer-memory chips known as DRAMs. Proponents contend that if high-tech 
companies are allowed to pool resources, they will be able to share the high 
start-up costs and the risk of questionable returns that are more easily 
absorbed by larger competitors overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would fall far short of an open invitation for companies to join 
forces in violation of current antitrust laws, which are aimed at preventing 
competing firms from monopolizing markets and rigging prices. Companies seeking 
to form manufacturing consortia would be required to notify the Justice 
Department, which could block corporate alliances that it believed to be 
harmful to competition -- just as it does now. 
</P>
<P>
But one of the key provisions in the proposal would ease the fears that many 
executives reportedly have about joining consortia. The provision would 
eliminate the chances that a consortium's member firms could face civil suits 
for treble damages under the antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
At least five bills to encourage manufacturing consortia already have been 
introduced in Congress, and the Administration proposal is motivated partly by 
a desire to spur passage of such a law and to shape its final form. Atty. Gen. 
Dick Thornburgh has long indicated that he favors permitting joint 
manufacturing agreements, but it has not been clear up to now if and how the 
Administration would want the law to be changed. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is expected to be greeted warmly on Capitol Hill, where fears are 
widespread that U.S. industry is falling behind that in Japan and other 
industrial countries. It is also likely to win support from industry; last 
month eight trade associations, including the National Assn. of Manufacturers, 
formed a coalition to support joint manufacturing initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
But the idea has its critics. Opponents contend that U.S. companies perform 
best when they are on their own and that creating consortia could make American 
industry stodgy. 
</P>
<P>
"Decreasing competition (in the United States) will not create strong 
international businesses," said Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.) a member of the House 
Judiciary Committee. "There is no evidence that the alleged decline in the 
competitiveness of American business can be traced to the antitrust laws." 
</P>
<P>
Others voice concern that the creation of big consortia could make life 
extremely difficult for small, innovative firms in the same industries that are 
not consortium members. "Why would any venture capitalist want to put his money 
behind a start-up in any technology" in which a consortium was a major player?, 
asked David Coelho, founder of two Silicon Valley companies, in recent 
congressional testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Officials cautioned that their decision is not final. "There is no 
Administration position yet on the legislation," said James F. Rill, assistant 
attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division. 
</P>
<P>
But other officials said that after much informal discussion, senior 
policy-makers have reached agreement on the thrust of the proposal. Among them 
are Thornburgh; Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic 
Advisers, and Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher. The proposal has been 
delayed only because of a bureaucratic turf battle over how the interagency 
process should advance the proposal, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The consensus proposal is more modest than one that had been backed by some 
Commerce officials, who favored a process in which the Commerce and Justice 
departments would grant certifications to consortia making them virtually 
exempt from antitrust penalties. Opponents within the Administration objected 
that the certification process could be a first step toward a federal 
"industrial policy".

Tighter Inspection of Seafood Sought: House Agriculture Committee members 
accused the Food and Drug Administration of understating the health threat of 
seafood-borne illness and called for a system of mandatory federal inspections 
to replace the current voluntary system. White House officials acknowledged 
during a hearing that more stringent inspection might be in order, but said the 
Bush Administration had not yet decided whether to support any congressional 
bill. Agriculture Department Assistant Secretary Jo Ann Smith told the 
committee one alternative being considered was to create a mandatory program 
funded through fees on the seafood industry.

Ford Buys Jaguar Shares: Ford Motor Co. said it snapped up millions of 
bargain-value shares in Britain's luxury car firm Jaguar as stock prices 
tumbled worldwide. Ford, which is vying for the prestigious Jaguar name with 
rival General Motors, said it had doubled its share holding to 10.4%. Ford said 
it had bought or agreed to buy 19.04 million Jaguar shares by the end of 
trading Monday. Ford, the world's No. 2 car maker, has said it aims to boost 
its stake in Jaguar to 15%, the maximum allowed by Britain's Conservative 
government when it privatized the firm in 1984.

MOST FOREIGN MARKETS REGAIN GROUND

<P>
Most of stock markets partly recovered Tuesday in a seesaw session, but the key 
London market fell and nervousness about Wall Street's behavior persisted. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo stock market, the world's biggest, soared from the opening bell to 
close sharply higher, erasing nearly all of Monday's selloff. 
</P>
<P>
The 225-share Nikkei index closed up 527.39 points, or 1.53%, at 34,996.08. It 
had plunged 647.33 points Monday following Wall Street's 190-point fall on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The market in Frankfurt, West Germany, which suffered a record drop Monday, saw 
big gains in urgent buying. Market indexes also finished higher in Paris, 
Amsterdam, Milan, Zurich, Madrid, Athens, Vienna, Stockholm and Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
New Zealand, Australia, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong also staged rousing 
recoveries after the previous day's losses by both Asian and European markets. 
</P>
<P>
The upward and downward moves were much less dramatic than Monday's gyrations, 
which followed Wall Street's Friday the 13th slump. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the Financial Times 100-share index fell 27.9 points, or 1.3%, to 
close at 2,135.5. 
</P>
<P>
The London session was jittery with the key index swinging 61.5 points from a 
session high of 2,182.3 in the first 15 minutes of official dealings to a low 
of 2,120.8 in the last 40 minutes of trading. 
</P>
<P>
But that was less dramatic than Monday, when the London index fell more than 
200 points and then mostly recovered to finish with a 70.5-point decline. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers said London was buffeted throughout the session by crosscurrents from 
Wall Street and fears about the U.S. trade figures. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index was down 27.87 points, or 1%, at 2,629.51 at 
about the time London closed. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is still very nervous about the down side," said a dealer with the 
London investment firm UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. "Also, buyers who passed up 
bargains Monday decided to hold off today to see if they'd come back later in 
the week." 
</P>
<P>
Trading disruptions continued in Europe on Tuesday. The Brussels exchange had 
computer problems for a second day, preventing significant trading since 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning, European stock prices followed Tokyo's climb on relief over New 
York's relatively strong finish Monday, which suggested that an all-out crash 
appeared to have been averted. 
</P>
<P>
But European share prices fell in the afternoon on worse-than-expected U.S. 
trade figures and on a subsequent weak opening on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade deficit increased to $10.77 billion, compared to market 
expectations of around $9.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The German stock index (DAX), which had plunged 12.8% in its worst one-day drop 
ever Monday, soared 89.72 points, or 6.4%, to 1,475.44. 
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt's trading volume even surpassed Monday's frenzied pace as small 
retail investors rushed to buy back some of the stocks they had dumped, and 
institutional funds exploited lower prices to boost their holdings. 
</P>
<P>
But the early enthusiasm soon gave way to a more sober assessment and profit 
taking late in the session, which was extended by one hour to process all the 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
The Madrid stock market's general index rose 5.96 points, or 2%, to a close at 
311.18. The index fell 6.5% on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In Zurich, the Swiss market index rose 82.3 points, or 5.1%, to 1,705.2. It 
declined 10.5% in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The Athens stock exchange general index rose 42.65 points, or 9.4%, to 497.79. 
It dropped 10.05% on Monday.

MEDIA GENERAL PUTS 31 WEEKLIES ON THE BLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirty-one weekly newspapers in Orange County and the San Gabriel Valley were 
put up for sale Tuesday by Media General Inc., the Richmond, Va.-based media 
conglomerate that last year fended off a bitter hostile takeover attempt by 
Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman. 
</P>
<P>
Media General said it was selling the community newspapers because they were 
geographically too far from the company's base in the Southeast and 
strategically too far from the firm's focus on daily newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
The papers put on the block include nine titles published by South Orange 
County News in Mission Viejo, and 22 titles run by Highlander Publications of 
the City of Industry. Together, the two groups constitute Golden West 
Publishing Inc., which will be sold as unit rather than in pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Redfern, chief executive of Golden West, said the 31 papers, all but one of 
which are distributed free of charge to community residents, had a combined 
circulation of 487,000 and gross revenues of about $15 million. While he would 
not disclose the price Media General is asking, he said that weekly newspapers 
normally sell for one to two times gross. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Dirks &amp; Associates, a newspaper broker based in Birmingham, Mich., has 
been retained to handle the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Media General said in a statement that "management demands for the West Coast 
operations are no longer prudent," and that "we prefer to concentrate our 
efforts on daily newspaper operations." The company's major properties include 
daily newspapers in Richmond and Tampa, Fla., and television and cable systems 
in the Southeast, and paper interests. 
</P>
<P>
Media General's only other West Coast operation, a paper mill in Pomona, was 
sold to Sugarman last year after his bid to take over the entire company 
failed. The exceptionally bitter takeover fight attracted wide attention as a 
test case of the legality of some types of Class B stock, which can confer 
extra voting rights and are used by many family-owned media companies to thwart 
unwanted suitors. But Sugarman dropped his challenge of the stock structure 
when he abandoned his takeover attempt. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden West Publishing group was put together by Media General in 1980 and 
1981 with the purchase of several small weekly newspaper chains. Redfern said 
the company initially had planned to convert one or more of the papers to 
dailies, but ultimately chose not to take the risks and make the huge 
investments that would have been required. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West employs about 350 people, Redfern said, and operations will 
continue as normal pending the sale. He said a number of companies had 
expressed interest in buying Golden West, but he declined to identify them. 
</P>
<P>
Community weeklies have been a strong growth niche in the newspaper business 
over the last several years, industry analysts say, although they rarely rival 
dailies in financial resources or editorial clout. 
</P>
<P>
Redfern said the strength of the different Golden West weeklies closely tracked 
the local economies, with strong growth for papers such as the Laguna Niguel 
News in booming areas of South County and flatter performance at the San 
Gabriel Valley titles.

SOCAL GAS WILL CURTAIL SUPPLY TO UTILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California Gas Co. will cut natural gas deliveries by more than 
two-thirds to electrical utilities starting Nov. 1 to save enough gas to cover 
demand from homes and small businesses during cold-weather months, gas company 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The gas company will cut deliveries to Southern California Edison Co., the 
Department of Water and Power, the Imperial Irrigation District and the cities 
of Pasadena, Burbank and Glendale, said gas company spokesman Ralph A. Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
"With very high continuing demand from the utility electrical generation 
customers, we just can't meet our storage goal of 67.5 billion cubic feet by 
Dec. 1," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
The curtailment of cleaner-burning gas -- only the most recent of several over 
the past two years -- could force the electrical utilities to burn dirtier oil 
to generate power. 
</P>
<P>
But Edison, the gas company's largest customer, has saved 4.8 billion cubic 
feet of natural gas under a new storage program and could use it in part to 
offset the curtailment, said Edison spokesman Lewis M. Phelps. 
</P>
<P>
Edison officials were to meet with gas company officials on Friday to decide 
how to meet the shortfall, Phelps said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the gas company had promised 100% delivery of natural gas during 
smog episode days in November.

INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT DIPS 0.1%, THE FIRST DECLINE IN 6 MONTHS

<P>
Industrial production dipped 0.1% in September, the first drop in six months, 
the Federal Reserve said Tuesday in a report that reflected continued weakness 
in the manufacturing sector of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
But Michael Evans of Evans Economics Inc., a Washington forecasting firm, said 
that "while the economy is not strong, there's no sign of a downturn." 
</P>
<P>
The Fed said last month's decline in output was the first since a 0.2% drop 
last February. It followed a revised gain of 0.3% in August and an unchanged 
rate in July. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Latta, an economist at the DRI/McGraw-Hill forecasting firm in 
Lexington, Mass., said industrial production has been cut in half this year, 
compared to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"This confirms that demand is slowing," she said. "When you get a slowdown in 
the economy, it tends to show up first in the goods sector." 
</P>
<P>
In another report, the Fed said the operating rate of the nation's factories, 
mines and utilities also fell in September, by 0.2 percentage point to 83.6%. 
This also reflected the decline in the production rate.

UAL EMPLOYEE GROUPS CALL FOR CHIEF, BOARD TO QUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what was viewed as an effort to torpedo the takeover of UAL Corp., two 
United Airlines employee groups Tuesday demanded the resignation of United's 
top officers, including Chief Executive Stephen M. Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
The demand came as Wolf and his advisers tried to revise a failed $6.75-billion 
offer for the airline from United's top managers and its pilots. The initial 
$300-a-share offer collapsed last Friday after nervous lenders rejected the 
deal as too risky. 
</P>
<P>
Calling Wolf's actions "greedy and irresponsible," John F. Peterpaul, general 
vice president of the International Assn. of Machinists, called for Wolf to 
step down, along with UAL's board. Peterpaul also asked that the Securities and 
Exchange Commission look into events surrounding the proposed takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in an interview, Peterpaul reiterated his union's position that the 
takeover would place too much debt on United and serve to enrich the airline's 
top executives. Wolf stands to make almost $76 million from his stock and 
options in a $300-a-share buyout. "The whole program is bad," Peterpaul said. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, a group that claims to represent United's 40,000 non-union 
employees called upon Wolf to quit. William Palmer, an organizer of a group 
called Coalition Acting for the Rights of Employees, or CARE, said the proposed 
buyout would have forced a 10% wage cut on non-union employees. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer said he hoped CARE's action would discourage lenders from financing a 
UAL takeover. "Any banker that doesn't consider the negative attitudes of 
employees would be derelict in his duty," he said in an interview. Palmer and 
Peterpaul said the similar actions by their groups Tuesday was coincidental. 
</P>
<P>
United's machinists and nonunion workers are at odds with the airline's pilots, 
who have joined Wolf in an effort to buy the airline, with help from British 
Airways. The proposal would have given an 85% ownership stake to United's 
employees and managers and a 15% stake to British Air. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders of United's pilots union met with their advisers Tuesday outside 
Chicago in an attempt to devise a new buyout proposal. The meeting is expected 
to last until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
UAL released a statement from Wolf on Tuesday, calling Peterpaul's comments 
"divisive and uncalled for." He said a resignation of UAL's board would not be 
in the company's best interest. 
</P>
<P>
On Wall Street, professional stock speculators said Peterpaul's remarks also 
seemed designed to help his union gain leverage in contract talks with the 
company, which opened Tuesday. "I think he's just trying to make Wolf angry and 
scare the U.S. and Japanese banks," one trader said. "But I don't take him too 
seriously." 
</P>
<P>
One executive with a large foreign bank said Tuesday that Peterpaul's remarks 
were of concern to overseas lenders. "There is too much uncertainty about the 
deal," said the executive, whose bank has helped finance other airline 
acquisitions, including the recent $4.05-billion buyout of Northwest Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The bank executive said foreign lenders would feel more comfortable if the 
machinists union, which represents 23,000 United workers, joined the deal, a 
prospect that seems unlikely. Peterpaul said in the interview that an employee 
stock ownership plan, or an ESOP, is not part of the contract talks. He said 
UAL executives in previous meetings had refused to discuss with him what he 
considers to be key aspects of an ESOP plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked them to describe how it would be governed and their business plan, 
and they would not give us that information," Peterpaul said. 
</P>
<P>
The foreign banker, who asked that his name and the name of his institution not 
be used, said UAL's plummeting stock price was also causing lenders to 
hesitate. UAL shares fell $25.625 to close at $197.25 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. On Wall Street, traders said UAL shares could drop as low as $140 
before they hit bottom. 
</P>
<P>
The drop Tuesday was blamed on a statement by Citibank, one of two lead banks 
for the buyout group, that it had received "expressions of interest" from some 
banks willing to finance a UAL buyout but did not have an agreement from banks 
or from the buyout group on a revised offer. 
</P>
<P>
Citibank had asked 20 leading banks in Europe, Japan and the United States, 
whether they would finance a transaction at $250 a share. The Citibank proposal 
included more generous fees for banks than the financing plan rejected by the 
banks last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese trade journal Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported in its Wednesday 
editions that of the large Japanese banks, only Mitsubishi Trust &amp; Banking 
was ready to finance the UAL deal. The newspaper said Sumitomo Bank had decided 
not to participate and that other important institutions, including Sanwa Bank 
and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, seemed reluctant to finance a takeover.

<P>
In every contract for every concert, there's an issue of utmost importance to 
the performers: food and drink. That's where Sue Walls comes in. 
</P>
<P>
In the 10 years she's been catering backstage at San Diego concerts, Walls has 
learned a lot about the eating and drinking habits of the stars, such as 
Pretenders singer Chrissie Hynde's disdain for meat dishes of any kind, The 
Cure's craving for pickled lime rinds and French wine, and Bob Dylan's penchant 
for Kentucky bourbon. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever they want, we give them," she said, "no matter how odd or unusual 
their requests might be." 
</P>
<P>
In the fall of 1979, Walls, now 30, was an undergraduate art student at UC San 
Diego when her friend and fellow student Bill Silva began promoting campus 
concerts with the school's University Events office. 
</P>
<P>
"One day Bill just asked me to do his catering," Walls recalled. "I had no 
formal training, but he knew my mother was a home economics teacher and our 
whole family was totally into cooking." 
</P>
<P>
The next March, Silva set out on his own, and Walls continued to cater 
backstage at concerts that Silva promoted at the Roxy Theater in Pacific Beach 
and, later, at other venues around town such as the California Theatre, Golden 
Hall, the Civic Theatre and the San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
She also continued her studies at the University of California, Irvine, and 
subsequently moonlighted for several years as a mechanical-design engineer with 
an Orange County engineering firm. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, in 1986, I quit my engineering job and went into the catering 
business full time," Walls said. "It had gotten to the point where I had way 
too much work, and I had to make up my mind to do one thing or the other." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Walls and her cohort, Denise Allen, have been catering an average 
of 70 San Diego concerts a year, satisfying the backstage palates of crews and 
performers alike, working for Silva and other promoters, including Avalon 
Attractions and Mel Simas, who produces the annual Del Mar Fair grandstand 
concert series. 
</P>
<P>
The crews are easiest to please, Walls said. 
</P>
<P>
"We serve them three square meals: lunch, dinner and again around 2 a.m., after 
load-out," she said. "And they pretty much get the same kind of food -- 
easy-to-do grilled things like steaks, chicken and fish." 
</P>
<P>
The performers are a lot more picky, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"They eat only once -- either three or four hours before the show or right 
after the show. And their tastes are really varied. The only constants seem to 
be a lot of alcohol and a fruit bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Here, then, is a selective sampling of menu requests Walls has had to fill in 
recent months: 
</P>
<P>
* Rod Stewart, San Diego Sports Arena: a case each of sake, Mateus rose wine 
and Evian mineral water, and a fruit bowl. 
</P>
<P>
* The Who, San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium: five cases of beer, including one of 
Corona and another of Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale; a case of Moet Chandon 
champagne; a platter each of cold seafood, smoked fish and grilled chicken; two 
pints of Haagen Dazs vanilla ice cream (on stage, for Roger Daltrey), and a 
fruit bowl. 
</P>
<P>
* The Cure, San Diego Sports Arena: four cases of beer; eight bottles of French 
wine; six packs of Wrigley's spearmint gum; a jar of pickled lime rinds; a 
platter each of sliced roast beef, tuna and smoked salmon, and a fruit bowl. 
</P>
<P>
* Bob Dylan, Starlight Bowl: a fifth of Courvoisier VSOP Cognac, two pints of 
Kentucky bourbon, and a fruit bowl. 
</P>
<P>
* Cinderella, San Diego Sports Arena: one bottle of Black Tower white wine and 
another of Absolut vodka, two cases of Budweiser beer and one of Heineken, a 
case of red Gatorade and another of green Gatorade, three packs of Pop's Secret 
Microwave Popcorn, and a "large assortment" of Tastee-Kakes. 
</P>
<P>
But for once, no fruit bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"Just two bananas and two apples," Walls said with a laugh. "That's all they 
wanted." 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: In last Thursday's Reader is a full-page Budweiser ad for the 
Rolling Stones that proclaims, "For San Diego Stones fans . . . This tour's for 
you!" It would be a whole lot more believable if the Stones were actually 
playing San Diego this week, instead of snubbing our fair burg in favor of 
doing four shows at the Los Angeles Coliseum. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night, the Zendik Farm Arts Cooperative, a latter-day hippie commune in 
rural Boulevard, will throw the eighth in a series of benefit concerts for its 
ZAP political party. Performing at the Normal Heights Community Center will be 
the commune's own Zendik Farm Tribe Band and another local group, Fishwife. 
Hopefully, the event will be a little better organized than the pre-show 
publicity campaign: The press release announcing the concert arrived in my 
mailbox addressed to the Events Editor (!) of the Reader (!!), with the 
postscript, "I realize this . . . is a bit late, but I would greatly appreciate 
it if this could be announced by one of your DJs (!!!)" . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tickets go on sale at 3 p.m. Friday for The Alarm's Nov. 17 appearance at the 
UC San Diego gym, and at 3 p.m. Nov. 3 for Squeeze's Dec. 12 concert at 
Symphony Hall downtown. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best concert bets for the coming week: O.J. Ekemode, tonight at the Belly Up 
Tavern in Solana Beach; Curtis Mayfield and Phil Upchurch, Thursday at the 
Belly Up Tavern; The Dickies, The Dum Dum Boys and Meat Wagon, Friday at 
Iguanas in Tijuana; R.E.O. Speedwagon, Saturday at the Bacchanal in Kearny 
Mesa; Gladys Knight and David Peaston, Sunday at Symphony Hall, and Arlo 
Guthrie, Oct. 24 at the Bacchanal.

San Diego Symphony officials announced Tuesday that orchestra management and 
players have a new two-year contract to replace the contract that expired on 
Sept. 30. The symphony's executive board approved the new contract Monday 
night, after a positive vote by the players last Thursday. The contract 
provides for modest increases in the players' weekly base salary and adds one 
more week of performance in the contract's second year. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Pallazola, president of the American Federation of Musicians, Local 325, 
stated that the union was satisfied with the new contract, although a typical 
agreement is a three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
"We settled for a two-year contract in the hope that in three years, management 
will be in a better position to begin to compete with the major orchestras," 
Pallazola said. 
</P>
<P>
The first year of the new contract provides a weekly base salary of $660, which 
will increase to $700 per week the second year.KENNETH HERMAN

<P>
A massive earthquake struck south of San Francisco Bay on Tuesday, killing at 
least six, injuring hundreds more, damaging thousands of buildings and 
collapsing a portion of the roadway decking on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay 
Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
The quake, which hit at 5:04 p.m. and lasted about 15 seconds, measured at 
magnitude 6.9, four times stronger than the powerful Sylmar quake that rocked 
the northern San Fernando Valley Feb. 9, 1971, killing 58 and causing more than 
$1 billion damage. 
</P>
<P>
An apartment building covering an entire city block caught fire in San 
Francisco's Marina District. The flames spread unchecked, enveloping the entire 
structure, which eventually collapsed in embers. Several nearby buildings 
appeared threatened. 
</P>
<P>
At the recently renovated San Francisco International Airport, ceilings 
collapsed and tumbled into crowded passengers areas. 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake, which was felt as far as 300 miles away, knocked out electrical 
power, television broadcasts and telephone communications across hundreds of 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
The quake struck as thousands of fans were crowding into San Francisco's 
Candlestick Park for the third game of the 1989 World Series. The game was 
canceled and players reportedly left the stadium in their uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
Network broadcasters monitoring the pregame activities from other cities saw 
the game go off the air and spread word of the disaster to the millions across 
the nation preparing to watch at the game on television. 
</P>
<P>
Several spectators at Candlestick Park were injured by falling debris. 
Officials ordered the stadium evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
Several motorists were tossed from the Bay Bridge into the water, more than 100 
feet blow, when the temblor collapsed a 50-foot section of the roadway. The 
extent of their injuries was not immediately determined. 
</P>
<P>
Several other major roadways suffered heavy damage. A section of U.S. 101, one 
of the main arteries to the south, buckled in several places near San Francisco 
Airport. A double-decked portion of Interstate 880 in the East Bay appeared to 
have collapsed. It is a main commuter freeway connecting East Oakland with the 
Oakland-San Francisco Bay Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Ambulances, their sirens screaming, attempted to race through gridlocked 
streets toward downtown San Francisco, where several major buildings collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Evening rush-hour traffic came to a halt, with traffic signals knocked out 
throughout much of the area. Many commuters left their cars in parking lots and 
tried to go home by foot. Market Street was filled with people as aftershocks 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco City Hall and the state building housing the state Supreme Court 
were evacuated. Both buildings had severe damage inside. 
</P>
<P>
Close to the Civic Center, a large section of a four-story building came down, 
and eyewitnesses said the bodies of at least two women were removed. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole topside, I saw the building coming down, and I just went forward, 
trying to get out of there," said Cliff Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Fire Capt. John Traversaro said that "four or five people, it 
could be considerably more" were killed in this building alone. 
</P>
<P>
At the nearby federal building, Marcus Williams said, "I didn't want to be 
buried alive. As I ran down the stairs, people were screaming. This was the 
worst one I ever felt." 
</P>
<P>
At the state Supreme Court, Justice David M. Eagleson said, "There were 
pictures knocked off the walls, books on the floor and cracked plaster. We were 
really hit. Things are really a mess." 
</P>
<P>
Justice Allen E. Broussard said he was completing a meeting with staff 
attorneys when the temblor hit. "There was so much dust in the air you could 
hardly see what happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was horrible on the Muni Metro," said Kim Gordon, an insurance company 
employee who was riding San Francisco's subway system. "We were underground and 
it was shaking real bad. We all thought we were going to die." 
</P>
<P>
She said that when her train arrived at the next station, the passengers were 
let out but had to grope their way to the surface in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
Seismologists at UC Berkeley and Caltech put the epicenter on the San Andreas 
Fault, 10 miles north of Santa Cruz in the same vicinity of a 5.4 quake that 
struck in August. 
</P>
<P>
Damage and injuries in the communities surrounding the epicenter were said to 
be extensive, with people trapped in damaged buildings in San Jose and further 
south in Hollister. 
</P>
<P>
A Hayward couple, Steve and Christie Stevenson, said they tried to run out of 
their front door, but "it was impossible to run." Steve Stevenson said they 
"held onto a tree in the front yard and watched the water in the swimming poor 
come out in three-foot waves." 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, Gov. George Deukmejian's press secretary, Kevin Brett, said the 
governor had been awakened in Frankfurt, West Germany, where he had gone on a 
trade mission, at about 1:15 a.m. Frankfurt time. 
</P>
<P>
Brett said it had not yet been decided whether the governor would cancel the 
rest of his trip and return to the state. 
</P>
<P>
The historic San Francisco earthquake of 1906 was estimated later by 
seismologists to have reached a magnitude of 8.3. By that scale, each number 
represents a 10-fold increase in magnitude -- meaning that the earlier quake 
was considerably more than 10 times stronger than Tuesday's. 
</P>
<P>
The 1906 quake devastated the city. In the three days that followed that quake, 
fires destroyed 490 blocks within a four-square-mile area near the financial 
district. Five hundred were killed, thousands were injured and more than 28,000 
buildings ultimately were lost. In 1906 dollars, damage was estimated at $400 
million.

STOCK MARKET STEADIES AFTER A JITTERY START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After worse-than-expected U.S. trade deficit figures set the stock market off 
to a jittery start Tuesday, stock prices firmed in relatively quiet trading, 
raising hopes that the markets are beginning to stabilize in the aftermath of 
Friday's 190-point drop. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day down 18.65 points at 2,638.73, 
following an 88-point rise on Monday. The Dow index briefly dropped more than 
60 points early Tuesday after the Commerce Department disclosed that the U.S. 
merchandise trade deficit had widened sharply to $10.77 billion in August, over 
$1 billion more than many economists had predicted. 
</P>
<P>
But with the sometimes erratic help of computer-driven program trading, the 
market recovered much of the lost ground and traded in a relatively narrow 
range throughout the afternoon in New York. Volume on the New York Stock 
Exchange was 224.07 million shares, slightly more than half the extraordinarily 
heavy 416.29 million shares that changed hands Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I do think things are calming down," said Jack Conlon, who is in charge of 
U.S. stock trading for Nikko Securities International in New York. Referring to 
Tuesday's 18.65-point decline, he said that "after the rally that we had 
Monday, you were bound to get some kind of correction." 
</P>
<P>
Technical analysts and investment strategists cautioned, however, that despite 
the ebbing fears of a crash, the markets remain fairly volatile. "This was 
still an emotional day, with plenty of ups and downs," said John Connolly, 
chief investment strategist for the brokerage firm Dean Witter Reynolds. "You 
can't really say we're stable yet." 
</P>
<P>
Many predicted that in the coming weeks the Dow index will drop to or below its 
low of 2,569 on Friday before resuming any sustained rise. "We had a big down 
and a big up," said Brad Weeks, a senior vice president in the stock trading 
department of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities. "Now we have to go 
back down and test to see if the lows of the market (on Friday) are really the 
floor." 
</P>
<P>
Traders predicted that one longer-term consequence of Friday's panicky drop 
will be to keep individual investors away from the stock market. They said it 
has reinforced small investors' fears of devastating price swings that began 
with the 508-point crash on Oct. 19, 1987. And they predicted that once the 
dust settles from the events of the last few days, stock market volume will 
drop back to the low levels of recent months that have made trading barely 
profitable for many brokerage firms. 
</P>
<P>
A seat on the New York Stock Exchange was sold Tuesday for $436,000, the lowest 
price in four years. The price is considered an indication of profit 
expectations in the brokerage business. 
</P>
<P>
In the shorter term, blue-chip stocks are expected to outperform more thinly 
traded issues as small investors stay on the sidelines and institutions 
concentrate on "quality" stocks. "Until the volatility subsides, trading is 
going to be dominated by institutions, and therefore blue chips will dominate 
the trading," said Eugene Peroni, a technical analyst at Janney Montgomery 
Scott in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's trading, the steep drop in NYSE stock prices early in the day was 
led by airline shares, which have been hit hard since Friday's news that an 
investor group that made a $6.75-billion bid to take over UAL Corp., parent 
company of United Airlines, had failed to obtain financing. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 20 transportation stocks closed the day down 49.96 
points, at 1,254.27, following a 102-point loss on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
News reports early Tuesday that bankers weren't coming to terms on loans to 
back a revised offer for UAL led to a trading halt in the stock because of an 
"order imbalance" -- far more sellers than buyers. UAL's stock later resumed 
trading and ended the day at $198, down $24.875. The stock had dropped $56 on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The UAL deal has been viewed by takeover speculators as an indicator of whether 
takeover deals in general are in trouble because of growing reluctance by banks 
and buyers of high-yield junk bonds to provide financing. 
</P>
<P>
The stock of AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, continued to suffer 
from Monday's announcement that real estate developer Donald J. Trump had 
withdrawn a $120-a-share offer for the company. The stock slid $3.75 a share on 
Tuesday to close at $73.25 after a fall of $22.125 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said continued action by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday to assure 
liquidity in the nation's financial system helped to steady investors' nerves. 
The Fed pumped $1.5 billion into the banking system to boost commercial banks' 
cash reserves and demonstrate the Fed's resolve to make sure that banks have 
enough cash on hand to meet the borrowing needs of Wall Street firms. The Fed 
on Monday had added $2 billion to the banks' reserves. Market analysts said 
investors also were acting on the belief that the Fed may move soon to lower 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
On the NYSE, declining stocks outnumbered rising issues by about 7 to 5, with 
931 down and 658 up. The NYSE's composite index of all stocks listed on the 
exchange dropped 0.87 to 188.89. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at several large mutual fund concerns said Tuesday that the level of 
customer calls was gradually returning to normal. Tracy Gordon, a spokeswoman 
for Fidelity Investments in Boston, the nation's largest mutual fund group, 
said the volume of calls from customers declined by about one-third from 
Monday's level, adding that there were signs of increased interest by investors 
in stock funds. 
</P>
<P>
Investment strategists and market analysts were divided Tuesday on the 
longer-term outlook for the market. Many noted an apparent slowdown in the 
economy and said the market may remain relatively depressed for the rest of the 
year, in part because many companies are now expected to report relatively weak 
third-quarter earnings. Others, however, said a softening economy in turn would 
lead to a significant lowering of interest rates by the Fed, which in turn 
could drive stock prices significantly higher.

BAY AREA QUAKE; 
</P>
<P>
L.A. RESIDENTS FEEL THE SHAKING AND SHOW CONCERN FOR VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Los Angeles residents, some saying they actually felt the Bay Area earthquake 
in swaying high-rise buildings here, responded to news of the Northern 
California disaster with an outpouring of concern, offers of help and 
determined efforts to contact relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Worried family members encountered jammed telephone lines, and air travelers 
bound for the Bay Area were left stranded at Southern California airports. 
</P>
<P>
In Whittier, which suffered a 5.9 magnitude earthquake on Oct. 1, 1987, the 
City Council planned Tuesday night to send building and safety department 
members to the Bay Area to help with applying for disaster recovery loans, 
spotting fraudulent contractors and dealing with details that come with 
rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
They also decided to donate $20,000 to $30,000 to the San Francisco-Oakland 
area, saying they wanted to repay the favors of cash and assistance the 
Whittier-Narrows quake generated from other cities. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to help as much as we can," said Mayor Victor Lopez. "This is 
terrible, terrible. You have to go through it to really know what it feels 
like." 
</P>
<P>
Two local American Red Cross catering trucks left Los Angeles for the Bay Area 
shortly after the quake occurred. Volunteers were to arrive by morning and 
hoped to help feed breakfast to victims, fire fighters and police officers, 
said Barbara Wilks, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles chapter. 
</P>
<P>
At the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, officials said they offered 
to assist Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and the state Office of Emergency 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, flights heading for the Bay Area were diverted to airports in 
Sacramento, Reno, Los Angeles, Burbank and Ontario, said FAA spokeswoman 
Barbara Abels. Abels said she did not know how many flights or passengers were 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
At Burbank Airport, a stunned shock settled over those who saw the first 
televised reports of the damage after hearing their flights to the Bay Area 
were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
"When they saw the destruction, they understood," said Bob Benson, manager of 
Burbank operations for U.S. Air, which canceled five flights. 
</P>
<P>
Shirlee Berman, of Belmont, south of San Francisco, headed straight for a 
Burbank Airport pay phone to try to find out about her two sons. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably tried 30 times and I keep getting a recording saying all circuits 
are busy," Berman said. "I'm terrified." 
</P>
<P>
Telephone company officials were urging people to refrain from calling the Bay 
Area, said Lissa Zanville, a Pacific Bell spokeswoman. She said lines might be 
open today. 
</P>
<P>
Later this week, the Red Cross will establish a phone line for Los Angeles 
residents to trace their relatives in the Bay Area, Wilks said. 
</P>
<P>
Some people were not content to wait for phone lines to clear. They rented cars 
to drive to San Francisco, and some who arrived in the Los Angeles area from 
the Bay Area rented cars to drive right back, said Rick Espinoza, manager of 
the Hertz counter at Burbank Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"We could have had more but we ran out of cars," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bay Area temblor was felt as far south as the high-rises in the Los Angeles 
area, although police said they received only a handful of calls from people 
locally. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt something strange. I heard a lot of creaking noises and it felt like 
the building was swaying back and forth," said attorney Douglas E. Klein, who 
was in his office on the seventh floor of a Century City high-rise. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney John Dewell said he felt a rolling motion in his office on the 30th 
floor of the 40-story AT&amp;T Center at 6th and Hope streets downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"We definitely felt it," he said. "The building was just shifting and rolling 
and creaking." 
</P>
<P>
At Northridge Hospital Medical Center in the San Fernando Valley, "The IV 
bottles were swaying," nursing supervisor Anne Lipman said. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco quake also heightened awareness in Los Angeles of the 
importance of being prepared for a similar disaster here. "We've been getting 
calls . . . suddenly, everyone wants to plan ahead" for the much-predicted "Big 
One," said Alan Barrios, a Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Barrios said people should contact the public safety division of the department 
during business hours at 213-485-PREP.

SCIENTISTS LAST YEAR HAD PINPOINTED TUESDAY'S SITE AS LIKELY TO BE JOLTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tuesday's earthquake, the strongest on the San Andreas fault since the San 
Francisco quake on April 18, 1906, came in a place that had been identified by 
scientists just last year as the most likely spot for a major jolt in Northern 
California within the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the temblor, eight miles east-northeast of the city of Santa 
Cruz in the Santa Cruz Mountains, was at virtually the same spot as earthquakes 
in the 5-magnitude range that occurred on June 27, 1988, and Aug. 8, 1989. A 
6.5-magnitude quake was centered there in 1865. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Geological Survey, in a 1988 report on regions of high earthquake 
probability in California, said there was a 30% chance of another 6.5-magnitude 
earthquake in the immediate vicinity by the year 2018. 
</P>
<P>
The report cited even higher probabilities for major temblors on the San 
Andreas near Parkfield in central California and Coachella in Southern 
California in the same period, but it pinpointed the Santa Cruz mountains as 
the most vulnerable spot in Northern California, in part because the area 
marked the southernmost point of maximum ground slippage during the 1906 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
A period of 83 years is short as far as earthquake intervals go, and during 
this time, scientists said Tuesday night, pressure was probably building up in 
the southern neighboring segment of the San Andreas, which had not slipped as 
much. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Heaton, the Geological Survey scientist in charge of the agency's 
Pasadena field office, said that the 1987 and 1988 earthquakes now must be seen 
as "preshocks" of the Tuesday's 6.9 temblor. He said "foreshocks" would not be 
the proper term, since months had elapsed before the more powerful earthquake 
struck. 
</P>
<P>
Heaton said that a still larger shock is unlikely. But he joined Caltech 
scientists in saying that aftershocks as strong as 5.9 magnitude should be 
expected, and that the pattern of aftershocks could last for months. A 5.9 
aftershock would be as strong as the 1987 Whittier quake in the Los Angeles 
area. 
</P>
<P>
After both the 1987 and the 1988 earthquakes in the Santa Cruz mountains, the 
state Office of Emergency Services and the U.S. Geological Survey issued 
warnings of increased risk of sizable shakes, ranging up to 6.5 magnitude, 
within the next few days in the vicinity. 
</P>
<P>
But these warnings said that if nothing happened, then the chances of a major 
earthquake would recede to normal for the vicinity. The trouble was, the area 
was more prone to quakes at this time than any other place in the Bay Area on 
the San Andreas Fault. Only the nearby Hayward fault may harbor as great a 
danger of a catastrophic earthquake in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
The San Andreas, the longest and best-known earthquake fault in California, 
extends from Point Arena in Mendocino County to the Salton Sea. It has been the 
site of the deadliest and most destructive earthquakes in the state's recorded 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Although Tuesday's quake was powerful, Waverly Person, chief of the National 
Earthquake Information Service in Golden, Colo., cautioned that at 6.9 
magnitude, it should be considered only a "strong" shock, not a "major" one, as 
a quake in the 7.0 to 7.9 range would be classified, or a "great" one, as a 
quake of 8.0 or above would be. 
</P>
<P>
Person and others in the Geological Survey warned Tuesday night that the 
probability is 40% that a temblor more powerful than Tuesday's will strike in 
Southern California sometime in the next three decades. 
</P>
<P>
But, as it was, Tuesday's quake was about four times stronger than the 
devastating Sylmar-San Fernando earthquake of 1971 and 10 times stronger than 
the 1987 Whittier quake. Each point of magnitude represents a 10-fold increase 
in the power of an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Person said that, like most San Andreas earthquakes, this was most likely to be 
a strike-slip quake, with one side of the fault grinding horizontally past 
another. But he said a final evaluation would have to await on-scene inspection 
teams that will be sent into the epicenter area today by the Geological 
Survey's Menlo Park office. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Dewey, a research geophysicist at the National Earthquake Center, said 
preliminary evaluations indicated that the fracture was about 10 miles deep, 
and that the quake rupture extended about 30 miles south down the fault from 
the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
Person said that the area of strongest shaking was around Santa Cruz, although 
this evaluation too will have to await field evaluations, as will a final 
confirmation of the magnitude of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The nearest metropolitan area to Tuesday's earthquake, San Jose, has seen 
nearly a dozen earthquakes of 5 magnitude or greater in the last 10 years, but 
several of them have been on the Calaveras fault, which generally runs just 
east of San Jose, more than 10 miles east of San Andreas at this point. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists do not yet understand whether the quakes on the Calaveras fault may 
have been a precursor, or somehow added pressure, on the San Andreas. But when 
a 5.1 earthquake did strike on the Calaveras in 1988, some earthquake 
scientists expressed concern that this could be the case. 
</P>
<P>
Between the late 1950s and 1979, there were no quakes of magnitude 5 or larger 
near the Bay Area. But in August, 1979, a 6.4-magnitude quake struck under 
Coyote Lake east of Gilroy and south of San Jose, and since then there have 
been a number of quakes. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Geological Survey scientists had expressed concern at the step-up in 
5-magnitude quakes south of the Bay Area. They noted that a similar series of 
moderately strong quakes had preceded the San Francisco quake of 1906. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a New Mexico scientist who studies tidal forces, supported by two 
eyewitnesses, said Tuesday night that at a private lecture in San Francisco on 
Oct. 10, he had stated that a strong quake in the vicinity was probable on or 
about Oct. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Iben Browning, of Sandia Park, N. M., said he had based his prediction on an 
assessment of tidal forces caused by the moon's relationship with the Earth. He 
said he had decided to keep the assessment private because he feared that 
publicity about it would cause people to panic.

It began with a rash of "heart attack calls" to the Oakland Police Department. 
Then people began arriving on foot at hospital emergency rooms throughout the 
Bay Area. Then came calls from cities and towns to state emergency services 
officials for fire engines and helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
The National Guard mobilized its emergency operations within 20 minutes of the 
first earthquake rumblings. Twenty-seven-thousand National Guardsmen were 
placed on alert. Hundreds of off-duty doctors and nurses poured into Bay Area 
emergency rooms. 
</P>
<P>
By 10 p.m., emergency service officials from Oakland to Sacramento were saying 
tentatively that their medical and emergency services response was proceeding 
smoothly and as planned. If anything, they said, the volume of calls for help 
seemed ominously low. 
</P>
<P>
Into the night, they waited anxiously for the anticipated onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
"We were lucky," ventured Dr. Michael Callaham, director of the emergency 
department at UC San Francisco's Moffitt-Long Hospital, in a telephone 
interview. "But I think what's happening is there are people pinned in rubble 
who won't be extricated for hours. Or, they may be dead." 
</P>
<P>
The full effects of the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway were just beginning to 
be felt in Oakland-area hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Many hospitals lost power. One had no water. Structural damage forced several 
small facilities to evacuate. But on the whole, officials reported that their 
emergency rooms were functioning well and that so far, serious injuries had 
been surprisingly few. 
</P>
<P>
Ambulances in San Francisco made what Mayor Art Agnos described as an almost 
record number of runs, despite jammed traffic, rubble and impassable streets. 
Some ambulances could not reach the city's designated trauma centers so they 
headed simply for the closest hospital. 
</P>
<P>
On a statewide level, the Office of Emergency Services had received calls for 
help from just three municipalities: The cities of Oakland and San Jose called 
in early for 25 additional fire engines; the town of Felton in the Santa Cruz 
Mountains requested 40. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of officials gathered at the state Office of Emergency Services 
headquarters in Sacramento, including representatives of the Red Cross, state 
police and Emergency Medical Services Authority. There they waited to dispatch 
help upon request. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not been overwhelmed with reports (of casualties)," said William 
Metegavich, director of emergency services for the state. He described the 
radio circuits as "very active" -- a good sign that the dearth of calls was not 
the result of system breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
In Oakland, officials at Merritt-Peralta Medical Center, one of the city's 
largest hospitals, were forced to evacuate an outpatient facility that was 
damaged in the quake. But hospital officials said the emergency room remained 
surprisingly quiet well into the night. 
</P>
<P>
About 35 people were admitted to the emergency room during the first three 
hours, according to Gerrie Shields, a Merritt-Peralta spokeswoman. Most of the 
injuries consisted of broken bones and bruises. Ten were admitted and two 
underwent surgery. 
</P>
<P>
At nearby Providence Hospital, however, ambulances had to be diverted after the 
emergency room became overloaded, Shields said. Shortly before 10 p.m., Shields 
said, "We are just now trying to figure out if we can anticipate having more 
come in." 
</P>
<P>
Across the bay at UC San Francisco's Moffitt-Long Hospital, Callaham said there 
had been "a small number of very seriously injured people." Callaham said 150 
doctors and as many nurses had poured in to help out with what had begun to 
look like "really low volume." 
</P>
<P>
Power had gone out, leaving the hospital dependent upon its emergency 
generator. Some elevators were immobilized. Callaham suggested the real test of 
the hospital's preparedness would come later when the more seriously injured 
were dug out and brought in. 
</P>
<P>
At San Francisco General Hospital, about two dozen injured people had been 
brought in to the emergency room by late Tuesday night. Most had bruises, cuts 
and broken bones. Hospital workers said only three cases appeared to be 
serious, including one person with a head injury from falling off a ladder. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, two hospitals in San Jose were reported to be without power. A San 
Mateo hospital reported serious damage. Kaiser Permanente evacuated two floors 
of a facility in Santa Clara after gas began leaking as a result of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, the Office of Emergency Services stood by to dispatch fleets of 
fire trucks used usually by the state forestry department. Caltrans officials 
said they had gotten maintenance crews on the scene "almost immediately" to 
begin examining bridges and overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Ronald Bright of the state's military department said his agency's 
emergency response was running smoothly: 400 National Guardsmen, mostly in 
helicopter units, were assembling at military bases around the state to be 
ready to fly in if needed. 
</P>
<P>
Among the military facilities put on alert were a helicopter air ambulance unit 
at Mather and a large cargo helicopter unit at Stockton. Bright said the 143rd 
Combat Support Field Hospital Unit based at Los Alamitos Reserve Center in 
Orange County was also put on notice in case a field hospital was needed. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, it's been chaotic but smooth," said Sgt. Ray Miller of the Oakland 
Police Department, expressing an opinion shared by others. Asked to elaborate, 
Miller said: "We're really busy. But it's being handled."

FIRE SWEEPS LUXURY FLATS IN POSH MARINA DISTRICT

<P>
A fire spawned by Tuesday's killer earthquake blow-torched through at least two 
luxury apartment buildings in San Francisco's stylish Marina District, raging 
out of control for nearly four hours and prompting fears of many deaths amid 
the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
At least three people were cofirmed dead, including one in a nearby building. 
The unidentified man was pinned in debris and died while firefighters tried 
frantically to cut him free with a chain saw, according to San Francisco 
paramedic David Drabble. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether more people might have died, paramedic Pete Howes said: "Perhaps. 
We have to go rooting in there to find out how many. Perhaps they are still 
alive." 
</P>
<P>
The Marina inferno was among the more visible signs of calamity that emerged in 
the immediate aftermath of the mammoth temblor, which struck a wide swath of 
the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
The smoke and flames from the fire were seen for miles, and thousands of 
passers-by stopped on nearby streets to watch the buildings burn. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very toxic fire, please move away!" yelled one man who said he was 
an official of the U.S. Interior Department. "This is very, very toxic." 
</P>
<P>
With power outages throughout the city, the fire cast an eerie glow over 
Divisadero and Beach streets, an upscale area located about a mile west of 
famous Fisherman's Wharf and only a few blocks from some other tourist meccas 
as the Presidio, Aquatic Park and the Palace of Fine Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake caused three buildings on two blocks of the Marina District to 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Two apartment buildings on the northwest corner of Divisadero and Beach became 
engulfed in flames about 20 minutes after the earthquake struck, nearby 
residents said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the buildings "pancaked," said Lee Phillips, an architect who works in 
her home, up the street from the fire scene. Phillips said that 20 minutes 
after the quake she heard sirens from ambulances racing to the scene, then she 
noticed smoke begin to spill out of the windows of the collapsed building, and 
then flames erupted. 
</P>
<P>
About one-third of the block was destroyed by the fire. 
</P>
<P>
When the earthquake occurred, Phillips said, she had trouble just scrambling 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't walk down the hallway," she said. "I fell down five times." The 
brick facade of her building fell into the street. 
</P>
<P>
An elderly woman who lives five doors down from the burning buildings said, "It 
collapsed -- totally collapsed." The woman, who asked not to be identified, 
added: "I was in such a state of shock. It's incredible. It was a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Although the exact cause of the fire was not immediately known, the smell of 
natural gas wafted through the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Directly across the street from the fire, another four-story apartment building 
tumbled into the middle of the street -- the top floor suddenly becoming the 
ground floor. The wood and stucco building was tilted at an angle and there was 
no telling whether anyone was left alive inside. 
</P>
<P>
About a block east of the fire, at North Point and Scott streets, the 
earthquake instantly transformed yet another four-story apartment building into 
a one-story structure. 
</P>
<P>
William Dempsey, who lives nearby, said he was in his apartment relaxing in 
front of his television, watching the World Series game and having a beer when 
the temblor hit. 
</P>
<P>
After the shaking subsided, Dempsey said he rushed into the street, as did his 
neighbors. He said he tried to break the fire alarm box but it didn't work, so 
they went up the street and broke another fire box -- and it didn't work 
either. 
</P>
<P>
Dempsey said the neighbors ran to the building that had collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't hear any sounds coming out," Dempsey recalled as he stood across the 
street, viewing the destruction. He said one of his neighbors managed to climb 
into the top floor, which was now near street level, but he found no one there. 
</P>
<P>
A police officer who stood guard outside the collapsed building said that there 
were no confirmed fatalities there, but that authorities would not search the 
apartments until the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the Marina District, the brick facades of fashionable buildings were 
scattered on streets. Several building sported large cracks -- some 6 inches in 
width. Sidewalks were buckled, resembling miniature mountain ranges. 
</P>
<P>
"My apartment is a disaster," said David Doiron, who said he was asleep on his 
couch when the quake struck. "I'm not going back in until we get someone to 
check the building" and make sure it's structurally sound. Everything is down. 
Plaster is off the walls. Things are off the shelves." 
</P>
<P>
As he made his comments, Doiron was holding a cat. The cat's head was buried 
deep into Doiron's lap. 
</P>
<P>
Morain reported from San Francisco; Welkos reported from Los Angeles.

WORRISOME BRICK BUILDINGS APPEAR TO SURVIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH and PAUL LIEBERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since the 1930s, engineers have believed that certain homes, apartment houses 
and office buildings in San Francisco would be extraordinarily vulnerable to a 
major earthquake. The aging, unreinforced brick buildings would have almost no 
chance of surviving the severe side-to-side shaking that an earthquake would 
bring. Or so the experts predicted. 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday night, city inspectors began a building-by-building check in San 
Francisco, and initial reports indicated that the city's shakiest structures -- 
most of them in Chinatown and the Tenderloin district -- had largely survived 
intact. Witnesses reported that those neighborhoods were quiet and buildings 
were standing with little damage apparent from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, engineer John Kariotis, one of the nation's leading experts on 
earthquake damage, estimated that the old unreinforced masonry buildings will 
"contribute to more than 50% of the damage" in San Francisco when all is said 
and done. 
</P>
<P>
Kariotis, head of a South Pasadena structural engineering firm, said the first 
pictures broadcast from San Francisco show "the same kind of thing" experienced 
in the Los Angeles area after the Whittier quake in 1987 -- "a series of 
building fronts that fell off. 
</P>
<P>
"But a lot of other things are going to be problems as well," Kariotis said. He 
said he expected to see heavy damage to concrete buildings constructed in the 
1950s and '60s, which are especially common in the San Jose area. 
</P>
<P>
"In '87, after the Whittier quake, we had a great degree of damage to 'tilt-up 
buildings,' the typical manufacturing building -- long, very large low 
buildings with concrete walls," he said. "San Jose is full of them -- Silicon 
Valley." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Kariotis said, "It looks like they probably had a great deal of 
damage with . . . soil sliding caused by the earth shaking." 
</P>
<P>
Soil sliding appeared to be problem in the Marina area of San Francisco, where 
wooden houses are built on hillsides, he said. Soil sliding causes structural 
damage to homes and can cause gas mains to break, leading to fires. Indeed, 
fires plagued the Bay Area Tuesday night, and there were widespread reports of 
gas leaks. 
</P>
<P>
Kariotis, who did an analysis of Candlestick Park years ago, said problems in 
the stadium probably will stem from the fact that it is a steel-framed 
structure topped with concrete slabs that form the seating rows. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a suspicion that with the flexibility of the steel structure . . . the 
concrete is brittle . . . the brittle concrete has a tendency to break at the 
corners," he said. "It's a common kind of thing to happen." 
</P>
<P>
He said damage to such a structure can be evaluated in as little as four to six 
hours, and that "they'll probably be able to open some parts of Candlestick" 
soon after. But because of the threat of aftershocks, "authorities are probably 
going to be a little bit wary about allowing it to reopen for several days." 
</P>
<P>
Kariotis and Nels Reselund, an associate in his structural engineering firm, 
had been working with counterparts in San Francisco recently to develop an 
"earthquake hazard reduction ordinance" for that city. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the state mandated that every community with unreinforced masonry 
buildings survey such structures and develop plans by 1990 to improve them. But 
measures mandating improvements to old buildings invariably draw opposition 
from property owners worried about the expense. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco's unreinforced brick structures have gone without upgrading 
because the city's seismic building codes still apply only to buildings erected 
after 1948. There are no laws requiring owners to update buildings that went up 
before that. Most of the city's unreinforced brick structures are in that 
category. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco officials, however, were concerned enough about the potential for 
disaster that they set about identifying the unsafe structures four years ago. 
They found a troubling 2,100 still in use, mostly in the Chinatown and 
low-income Tenderloin districts of the inner city. The structures included some 
25,000 residential units housing more than 40,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the finding and dire warnings from disaster preparedness officials, 
most or all of the buildings remained standing and occupied Tuesday when the 
earthquake hit. 
</P>
<P>
Existence of the unreinforced buildings has been a touchy issue for 
politicians, who fear the controversy that is sure to erupt if mandated repairs 
lead to rent hikes or demolitions force low-income residents onto the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"If a disaster strikes, we'll say it's terrible, why didn't we do something?" 
San Francisco city supervisor Tom Hseih said a few months ago. "Until you see 
the blood, I guess nothing's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
The aging structures have almost no elasticity and are frequently held together 
with deteriorating mortar that disintegrates under pressure, Frank Lew, manager 
of San Francisco's seismic safety program, said in an a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
"Once that happens, you've lost the bearing and support and the walls come 
tumbling down on your head." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles enacted legislation in 1981 requiring landlords to make their 
buildings structurally sound by 1992.

VISITING S.F. BALLET CARRIES ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 65-member San Francisco Ballet was preparing for opening night Tuesday at 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa when the dancers heard 
of the Bay Area earthquake shortly after 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Less than three hours later, the troupe was dancing the scheduled program. 
</P>
<P>
"We're freaked," said Lawrence Pech, one of the company's lead dancers, shortly 
after he learned of the earthquake. "I know my mind will be somewhere else 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Another dancer worried aloud about her husband, who had tickets for Game 3 of 
the World Series at Candlestick Park in San Francisco. Like many of the 
company's members, she tried in vain to reach her husband or Bay Area friends. 
She got nothing but busy signals and a recording about service interruptions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be so much fun trying to perform tonight," she said as she 
wandered off.

THE BAY BRIDGE: THE BACKBONE OF S.F. IS BROKEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
More so than the celebrated Golden Gate, the Bay Bridge is the workaday 
backbone of the huge Bay-Area metropolis. Close to half a million people cross 
it every day, and more than a few probably think about earthquakes as they do 
it. 
</P>
<P>
For several hundred, the seldom-spoken fear struck close during Tuesday evening 
rush hour when a piece of the upper deck -- five lanes of roadway carrying 
commuters into San Francisco -- swayed and collapsed in front of motorists 
bound the other way on the lower deck. 
</P>
<P>
No cars pitched over into the dark waters of San Francisco Bay, but at least 
one motorist was killed in a car trapped by the falling debris. Fate seemed to 
spare many others, since the usual 5 p.m. rush-hour traffic was remarkably thin 
for a Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is the "other" bridge soaring out of San 
Francisco, but it is actually visible to more of the Bay Area than the Golden 
Gate. In recent years, the Bay Bridge spans have been brightly lit at night, 
although Tuesday the bridge was eerily dark except for the flashing orange 
lights of emergency trucks inching across the two decks. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists who were on the bridge when the quake hit reported confusion in the 
aftermath. Debbie and Thomas Kelly were on the upper deck, trying to return to 
San Francisco, when they shot videotape of a car falling through the crevice in 
the roadway. They said the car had been directed back toward safety, but had 
inadvertently turned the wrong way and pitched into the hole. The Kellys said 
as many as 100 cars had driven toward the collapsed section of the road rather 
than back to safety in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"It was sort of mass confusion," Thomas Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
There also were unconfirmed reports from witnesses on the bridge that some 
terrified motorists jumped into the water, but the Coast Guard could find no 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Other Bay Area bridges weathered the quake better. The Golden Gate remained 
open, and the San Mateo Bridge -- which was closed as a precaution -- is 
expected to reopen today. However, transportation officials advised residents 
to stay home if at all possible today to avoid gridlock on the roads. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the Bay Bridge that will signal the Bay Area's return to normalcy. 
Caltrans announced late Tuesday night that the Bay Bridge will be closed at 
least two days, maybe longer if inspectors find major structural problems. If 
no serious fissures are found, the lower deck of the bridge will be opened with 
three lanes going in either direction, allowing at least limited traffic to 
cross. 
</P>
<P>
However, the roadbed leading onto the bridge from the Oakland side was buckled 
and torn up, with parts of it under water, witnesses said Tuesday night. One 
crack in the pavement near the Oakland toll booth was about 100 yards long and 
a foot wide. 
</P>
<P>
State emergency officials in Sacramento said they will install temporary Bailey 
bridges to span the collapsed section of the upper deck, and will try to 
operate ferries between the west and east sides of the bay. 
</P>
<P>
The gray Bay Bridge is squatter and less grand than the brightly painted Golden 
Gate. But the Bay Bridge is longer by at least double, and is a fitting symbol 
for the World Series between the Bay Area's baseball teams. 
</P>
<P>
The Bay Bridge carries twice as much traffic as the Golden Gate, and its 
opening presaged tremendous growth in the East Bay. Oakland is the best-known 
community on the east side of the bay, but the bridge is the conduit that 
allows commuters to live in distant suburbs of Contra Costa County and drive to 
jobs in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Some engineers also believe that it is the more notable marvel. The American 
Society of Civil Engineers named it one of the nation's seven landmark 
structures, an honor never bestowed on the Golden Gate. 
</P>
<P>
The Bay Bridge and Golden Gate, longtime dreams of the Bay Area's more 
grandiose thinkers, were both built during the Great Depression, beginning in 
1933. The Bay Bridge was finished first, opening in a grand celebration Nov. 
12, 1936. 
</P>
<P>
From Oakland, the bridge is cantilevered over the bay as far as Yerba Buena 
Island, where the world's largest bore tunnel was driven through hills. Then 
two suspension spans are attached to moorings in the Embarcadero area of 
downtown San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Rocks and dirt from the tunneling were dumped in the bay to create Treasure 
Island, site of a 1939-40 World's Fair and now a Navy base. 
</P>
<P>
A national survey in 1986, when the Bay Bridge quietly celebrated its 50th 
anniversary, found that less than 1% of people asked to name a San Francisco 
landmark listed the Bay Bridge, while nearly half mentioned the Golden Gate. 
</P>
<P>
The Bay Bridge's obscurity outside the Bay Area extends to suicide attempts as 
well. More than 800 people have died after jumping from the Golden Gate, 
slightly more than 100 from the Bay Bridge, though the roadways are both 250 
feet above the water. Some who jumped from the Bay Bridge even left notes 
indicating that they believed it was the Golden Gate.

<P>
The East German reform movement remains without strong leaders or goals, even 
though mass demonstrations in Leipzig and elsewhere show that opposition to the 
Communist regime is mounting, diplomatic analysts agreed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The signs of fervent dissent are obvious: 100,000 people turning out for a 
weekly Monday night assembly in Leipzig; continuing candlelight vigils in East 
Berlin; 25,000 signatures in support of an amorphous opposition organization 
called New Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The question, however, is whether the demonstrators can keep up their momentum 
and force the recalcitrant Politburo to introduce political and economic 
reforms it does not want. 
</P>
<P>
A Western diplomat based in East Berlin noted skeptically: "The number of 
people coming out on the streets is remarkable. One wouldn't have believed this 
just a few months ago. But can they form an effective opposition, as in 
Poland?" 
</P>
<P>
So far, another diplomatic observer added, "There is no Lech Walesa (leader of 
Poland's trade union movement), no leader with any national charisma, no tough 
organization like Solidarity, no one to articulate their aims. And the aims 
themselves are rather vague -- perhaps purposely so." 
</P>
<P>
And Johannes Richter, a Leipzig minister who has been active in the reform 
movement, warned that "it would be a mistake to underestimate the forces of 
inertia and resistance to change in the East German leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, many observers believe that an unparalleled opportunity exists to 
bring change to East Germany, as the demonstrations continue to grow and the 
number of East Germans fleeing to the West shows no signs of ceasing. 
</P>
<P>
"The root cause of the situation is that these people don't want to live in 
East Germany," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said in Washington. 
"If you're going to have a way of resolving the situation in the long run, 
there are going to have to be political and economic reforms in East Germany 
that will make it a more livable place for people." 
</P>
<P>
Charles William Maynes, editor of Foreign Policy magazine, agreed, saying: "One 
of the things that is happening in Eastern Europe is that there used to be some 
significant support for all of those regimes. Now I don't think there is any. 
</P>
<P>
"The prewar regimes had been so bankrupt and had led the countries into such 
disasters that there was a willingness on the part of a significant portion of 
the population to acquiesce in this new system. I think that has all been 
burned out. . . . East Germany does not exist except through its ideology. If 
the ideology collapses, the state collapses." 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, however, it has been the strategy of New Forum to couch its call for 
reform in general terms in order to enlist the broadest possible following. Its 
leadership similarly lacks specificity: Several founding members speak for the 
group, but there is no clearly defined hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
For the past two weeks, the focal point of New Forum activity in East Berlin 
has been the book-filled apartment of painter Baerbel Bohley, on a leafy street 
in the Prinzlauer Berg district. 
</P>
<P>
Bohley is a wispy woman in her 40s who, in the eyes of many, exudes not 
charisma but a sort of helpless charm as she deals with phone calls and 
visitors and tosses out ideas about what she would like to see the government 
do. 
</P>
<P>
She talks of engaging the state in a dialogue with the people but offers no 
suggestions on just how to bring this about. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, she insists that New Forum wants to reform the country from 
within, by peaceful means, although this could be a difficult task in a 
Communist state with a tough, well-trained police force, a secret security 
apparatus and a large army. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the problems of developing a hard resistance," one observer said, "is 
that few people here, unlike Poland, have served prison sentences. In the past, 
the regime has exiled the resistance leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a popular joke has it that East German dissidents "live in Stuttgart, 
drive Mercedeses and take their girlfriends to Spain on vacation." 
</P>
<P>
Dissidents have come to not fear being imprisoned, but they dread being dumped 
across the Berlin Wall and having their names inscribed on the immigration 
blacklist. And they have become more muted in their criticism of the regime 
than were the members of Solidarity, which recently formed the first 
non-Communist government in the East Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Senior members of Protestant church groups have been careful about going too 
far in speaking out against the regime, instead working out a modus vivendi 
that has allowed some dissent -- but not too much. 
</P>
<P>
"Churches in East Germany are much less well organized politically than in 
Hungary and Poland," said Helmut Sonnenfeldt, a former State Department and 
National Security Council expert who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings 
Institution in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt that the church will become a focus of opposition to the present 
regime to the extent that it has in countries where the majority of the 
population is Roman Catholic. There is no good precedent for evangelical 
churches to engage in politics as much as the Roman Catholic Church," 
Sonnenfeldt said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, said one West Berliner who crosses to the East, "I have the 
feeling that had they maintained the pressure of those big East Berlin 
demonstrations the regime would have had to give in." 
</P>
<P>
He referred to the marches that erupted in East Berlin just before the arrival 
earlier this month of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who was in East 
Berlin for celebrations marking East Germany's 40th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev reportedly warned East German leader Erich Honecker against the use 
of excessive force in breaking up the demonstrations, because the use of such 
force might galvanize the resistance in a way that peaceful marches could not. 
</P>
<P>
The reformers, meanwhile, are divided by sharp differences, with church groups 
and organizations like New Forum, Democratic Awakening and the Initiative for 
Peace and Human Rights all holding different views on how far they should go. 
</P>
<P>
Werner Fischer, one of the Initiative's organizers, pointed out that many 
dissidents are atheists and not comfortable under the church umbrella. His 
group, he says, has a tougher platform than the church groups -- one that calls 
for specific changes. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the reformers are not seeking a system of free enterprise, 
as are the protesters in Poland and Hungary. They are content with state 
socialism but want more dialogue, unrestricted travel and a free press. 
</P>
<P>
Nor are they in favor of a united Germany. A member of New Forum in Dresden 
told an interviewer recently: "We have enough work to do to reform our society 
without that. Talk of reunification simply slows down what we are struggling 
for." 
</P>
<P>
The reformers also are not happy with the Communist regime's acceptance of 
several billion dollars a year in what amounts to West German subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be good to stop that," New Forum's Bohley said, "so that we can try 
to stand on our own two feet." 
</P>
<P>
If there is an advantage to having no national opposition leadership, observers 
say, it is that the authorities have no one to send into exile. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a Western analyst in East Berlin said, "there may be strong leaders 
available -- they may be waiting to see whether the horse is allowed to run 
before leaping into the saddle." 
</P>
<P>
And, a New Forum member in East Berlin concluded, "It would be pity to let all 
that energy and potential be dissipated. I hope the movement we are seeing 
doesn't just run down. We have to keep pushing, or nothing will happen."

The Soviet Union's attitude toward human rights has improved dramatically, and 
most political prisoners have been freed, although abuses persist and the 
picture is "deeply confusing," Amnesty International says. 
</P>
<P>
In a report published today, the worldwide human rights movement says its list 
of Soviet citizens imprisoned for nonviolent exercise of their human rights 
shrank from 600 three years ago to about 90 in July, and would have been lower 
but for further arrests. 
</P>
<P>
An Amnesty International delegation, allowed into the Soviet Union for the 
first time last March, found that "the Soviet perspective on human rights has 
shifted dramatically since 1986," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"The most promising prospect for long-term reform is a major review of law . . 
. apparently aimed at bringing Soviet law into line with international 
standards," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, human rights issues are being freely discussed and 
acknowledged by the authorities to be an international issue, not an internal 
matter immune from outside scrutiny, it said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union hopes to hold the Helsinki Review Conference on Human Rights 
in Moscow in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Amnesty International said that of the 600 prisoners, 337 were released early, 
and another 79 were freed from psychiatric hospitals where some had spent 15 
years or more against their will. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these 416 people were prosecuted for expressing nonconformist 
opinions, or for their religious activities. Some had been arrested for trying 
to leave the U.S.S.R.," it said. 
</P>
<P>
"They make up the largest single group of prisoners of conscience to have been 
freed since the 1950s. Political arrests have also fallen noticeably since 
1986," it said.

WORLD PSYCHIATRIC ASSN. VOTES TO CONDITIONALLY READMIT SOVIETS

<P>
The World Psychiatric Assn. voted early today to readmit the Soviet Union after 
a six-year absence, subject to suspension if the Soviets have not ended the 
misuse of psychiatry against dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
A motion for conditional readmission of the official Soviet All-Union Society 
of Psychiatrists and Narcologists passed 291 votes to 45, with 19 abstentions. 
The United States voted in favor. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union left the association in 1983 to avoid expulsion because of 
allegations that dissidents were being certified as insane. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the approved motion, a delegation of the World Psychiatric Assn. 
would visit the Soviet Union within a year to determine whether the political 
use of psychiatry had ended. 
</P>
<P>
If the answer is no, a special general assembly will be called to consider 
suspending the Soviet membership. 
</P>
<P>
"I think . . . the conditions will allow us to assess whether or not there has 
been an amelioration in the political use of psychiatry in the Soviet Union," 
said Dr. Melvin Sabshin, medical director of the American Psychiatric Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The move to admit the Soviet Union came after Peter Morozov, the Soviet 
representative and chief of international relations of the group, acknowledged 
the existence of the political use of psychiatry in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Soviet All-Union Society) publicly acknowledges that previous political 
conditions created an environment in which psychiatric abuse occurred, 
including political," Morozov told the general assembly before his delegation 
left the hall for the vote. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the Soviet Union publicly admitted the political abuse of 
psychiatry. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet group agreed to submit to the on-site review by the World 
Psychiatric Assn., underlining that it supports changes in Soviet law aimed to 
define professional abuse and give patients more rights. 
</P>
<P>
An official U.S. delegation of psychiatrists led by a State Department official 
visited the Soviet Union in February to investigate claims that psychiatry was 
no longer being abused, in particular on Soviet dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
The group noted in a report that despite some progress, more legal safeguards 
were needed.

SENATE OKS FUNDS FOR NICARAGUAN OPPOSITION; 
</P>
<P>
CENTRAL AMERICA: PRESIDENT BUSH DOES A SELLING JOB ON CONSERVATIVE SENATORS 
WORRIED THAT A VOTE FOR THE MEASURE COULD BE USED AGAINST THEM IN CAMPAIGN 
COMMERCIALS.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate on Tuesday approved $9 million to help the Nicaraguan opposition in 
that country's elections, but only after President Bush persuaded conservative 
senators to put aside fears that the vote could be used against them in 
negative campaign commercials. 
</P>
<P>
The senators' anxiety was laced with irony: several of them, including North 
Carolina Republican Jesse Helms, were among the earliest and most unrestrained 
users of the 30-second political rabbit punches they now fear. 
</P>
<P>
The conservatives favor helping Nicaragua's anti-Communist opposition, but 
under Nicaraguan law the U.S. government must pay a $2-million tax to 
Nicaragua's Sandinista government to give money to the opposition. 
Conservatives fretted all day that the vote could be used by future challengers 
in Senate races to accuse them of voting to aid the leftist Sandinista regime. 
</P>
<P>
And Democratic liberals who oppose the aid plan did their best to heighten that 
anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm staggered at the number of people willing to face those 30-second spots," 
Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.) said during the debate. 
</P>
<P>
For years, conservatives have called Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega "an avowed 
Communist tyrant." Now, Bumpers asked conservative colleagues, how will they 
explain that they "gave that scoundrel $2 million of taxpayers' money?" 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, Bush tried to reassure the conservatives, telling a group 
of seven Republican Senate leaders at a morning Oval Office meeting that 
"senators don't want to give aid to the Sandinistas and neither do we, but we 
have no choice," spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, which passed the Senate 64 to 35, already has passed the House. Bush 
is expected to sign it quickly in an effort to get the first money to Nicaragua 
before Sunday -- the deadline for voter registration efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The handling of the bill, several senators said, was a dramatic illustration of 
how negative campaign blitzes based on controversial votes have altered the 
legislative process. 
</P>
<P>
Bumpers, in an interview, laughed as he called the conservative discomfort 
"poetic justice" -- a payback for the many times conservative Republicans in 
the Senate have put liberals on the spot with roll-call votes that opponents 
later featured in negative advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
Others found the day's events more troubling. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the way that campaigns have evolved," said Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum 
(R-Kan.). "It becomes very difficult to get the public to see the full scope of 
the debate. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a responsibility to lay that to rest," she said, then quickly added, 
"but I'm from Kansas," where a relatively small population has limited somewhat 
the role of television ads in political campaigns. "It's not a state like 
California." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.), the Republicans' deputy leader, was more blunt. 
"There's a lot of duplicity here," he said. "There's not a thing you do here 
that can't be turned into a 30-second ad." 
</P>
<P>
The bill approved by the Senate would provide $5 million to a variety of 
Nicaraguan groups to use for nonpartisan election assistance -- training for 
poll watchers, for example. Another $2 million would go to the main Nicaraguan 
opposition coalition to directly support the election of its candidate, Violeta 
de Barrios Chamorro, the editor of the La Prensa newspaper, in her race against 
Ortega to be president of Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
But under Nicaraguan law, any candidate or party receiving money from a 
non-Nicaraguan source must pay a tax equal to the amount of the outside 
contribution. The tax goes to the government's Electoral Tribunal, which has 
been designated to run the election. By comparison, U.S. law flatly forbids any 
candidate for federal office from receiving campaign contributions from 
foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has made the aid a centerpiece of its current Central 
American strategy, which seeks to overturn Sandinista power through elections 
rather than through the armed conflict that the Reagan Administration had 
fostered. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the plan have argued that the money is excessive, an effort to 
"buy the election." 
</P>
<P>
"This is too much money; it's flooding dollars into Nicaragua," said Sen. Tom 
Harkin (D-Iowa), who noted that the money that will go to Chamorro's campaign 
will amount to more than $5 for every registered voter in Nicaragua, one of the 
world's poorest countries. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents also denounced sending more money to Nicaragua at a time when the 
federal government is cutting domestic spending programs to ease the budget 
deficit. Led by Harkin, they proposed an amendment forbidding any U.S. money 
from going to pay the Nicaraguan tax, which would effectively have killed the 
aid package. The amendment put the Administration in the position of asking its 
supporters to go on record as voting to give money to Ortega's government. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got this strange coalition of far right and far left" opposing the 
Administration, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said before the Senate vote. "When 
you get close to entering an election year, people get nervous." Thirty-seven 
Senate seats are up for election next year. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the aid sought to reassure nervous senators with a letter from 
Bush calling the aid "the only means we have to help ensure that democracy 
asserts itself peacefully through a free and fair election" and a letter from 
Chamorro saying that the "election represents a historical opportunity for 
Nicaragua." 
</P>
<P>
After a day full of squirming and maneuvering, the Senate defeated Harkin's 
motion, 59 to 40.

Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) said he wants a new Energy Department safety oversight 
board to review the possibility that tanks holding radioactive and chemical 
waste at the Hanford nuclear reservation could explode. A 1984 report concluded 
the tanks at the reservation in south-central Washington state could explode 
and scatter radioactivity. A follow-up report, however, essentially dismissed 
the danger of explosion, according to the lab that prepared both reports.

The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, meeting in 
Lausanne, Switzerland, approved a formal ban on trading in ivory. The action 
followed a resolution to the same effect the day before. Several southern 
African nations that contend they protect their elephants and need ivory 
revenue hinted that they may bypass the ban. There are about 600,000 elephants 
left in Africa, only about half the total of 10 years ago.

Egypt and Libya ended 12 years of tension and at times hostility by agreeing to 
exchange diplomatic missions in what could mean restoration of full diplomatic 
ties. The announcement followed two days of reconciliation talks between 
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Libyan leader Col. Moammar Kadafi, first 
in the Egyptian resort of Matruh and then in Libya's Tobruk. "We have no

President Mikhail S. Gorbachev reportedly stunned reformers by harshly 
criticizing historian Yuri N. Afanasyev, a key leader of radical forces, at a 
closed meeting with top editors last week. Gorbachev also attacked a poll that 
ranked physicist Andrei D. Sakharov as the most popular member of the new 
Congress of People's Deputies, Soviet journalists with knowledge of the meeting 
said. Gorbachev called Afanasyev's recent speeches incompatible with his party 
membership, suggesting that he should quit or be expelled, they said. And he 
told Vladislav A. Starkov, the editor the country's most popular periodical, 
that as a result of publication of the Sakharov poll, he should considering 
resigning, they said.

A judge barred the National Transportation Safety Board from further testing of 
an engine on the United Airlines DC-10 that crashed July 19 in Sioux City, 
Iowa. Associate Cook County Circuit Judge Joseph Casciato in Chicago said an 
independent tester should be used to check the engine. Attorney William J. 
Harte asked that the NTSB testing be stopped because General Electric, which 
made the engine and is one of three defendants in three class-action lawsuits 
stemming from the fatal crash, was involved in the testing. The NTSB vowed to 
appeal.

A national abortion rights group Tuesday removed Connecticut Gov. William A. 
O'Neill from a list of top political targets, reversing a stand the group took 
just three days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The reversal by the National Abortion Rights Action League took O'Neill off a 
list that includes Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), Florida Gov. Bob Martinez and six 
other elected officials as political targets because of their anti-abortion 
views. 
</P>
<P>
"I have spoken with Gov. O'Neill's office and I have received assurances that 
the governor is not planning any anti-choice initiatives," NARAL leader Kate 
Michelman said. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor has stated that regardless of his own personal views he believes 
individuals have a right to make their own decisions. As a result, NARAL is 
removing him from its list of elected officials targeted for defeat in 1990." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill said he did not know how he got on the list in the first place, "but 
how I got off there became self-evident because the local people in the state 
of Connecticut knew I shouldn't have been on there to begin with." 
</P>
<P>
Michelman added that her group will be watching all of the candidates in the 
1990 race for Connecticut governor and may "consider involvement" as the 
campaign develops. O'Neill, a Democrat, has said he plans to seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Organization for Women launched a tour this week in 
Virginia to encourage women to vote for Democrat Douglas Wilder for governor 
because of the anti-abortion views of his Republican opponent.

Coleman on Nov. 7.

Democratic state Sen. Gene Taylor won a lopsided victory over Republican Tom 
Anderson, a veteran Washington aide, in a special election in the 5th 
Congressional District in Mississippi. With 94% of 372 precincts reporting, 
Taylor had 65% of the vote to Anderson's 35% in the race to succeed Republican 
Larkin I. Smith, who was killed in a plane crash in August. The victory means 
that the Democrats hold all five of the state's House seats for the first time 
in 17 years. The GOP holds both of Mississippi's U.S. Senate seats.

Observing that "marijuana is an illegal drug. It gets people stupid," William 
J. Bennett, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, 
said he believes marijuana is as bad as any of the other illegal drugs in use 
and the crackdown should be just as tough. "We know that 75% or 80% of the 
people who use a lot of marijuana move on down the line (to harder drugs)," 
Bennett said at a news conference following an address to the 96th annual 
conference of the International Assn. of Chiefs of Police in Louisville, Ky. 
"We are not going to win the war on drugs unless we do certain things, like 
make users accountable, work to see the drug user is fined, his assets are 
seized, or some other penalty," Bennett said.

A state Court of Appeal, sharply criticizing Fish and Game officials, refused 
to lift a 17-year ban in California on the killing of mountain lions for sport. 
The three-member panel upheld an order by a San Francisco Superior Court judge 
blocking the proposed hunt until the state Fish and Game Commission more fully 
analyzes the environmental impact of the plan and gives the public more 
information on its consequences. The panel said the commission's environmental 
analysis was "woefully inadequate." State officials, the court said, "chose to 
circulate a document that simply swept the serious criticisms of this project 
under the rug." Spokesmen for the commission and the state attorney general's 
office declined comment, pending study of the panel's opinion, but said an 
appeal to the state Supreme Court will be considered.

Sonoma County has come up with a plan to make casting an absentee ballot as 
easy as buying a fast-food burger. Election officials are opening a window 
where motorists can pull up, sign their names and drop off their marked 
ballots. The window will shorten the often long lines of early absentee voters 
filing into the elections office, Deputy Registrar of Voters Janice Atkinson 
said. Her idea was approved easily at a recent meeting of the Sonoma County 
Board of Supervisors, despite some doubters. The plan is expected to take 
effect after the first of the year, when the registrar's office moves to a new 
building in the county government complex in Santa Rosa. The new system, 
including the "teller's" window and drive-up ramp, is expected to cost $9,100.

State Farm, the largest seller of auto insurance in California, has notified 
its 3 million customers that it is suspending the sending out of semiannual 
bills pending the expected adoption by Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie 
of new regulations for pricing auto coverage mandated by Proposition 103. In a 
letter to all State Farm policyholders, the company said, "If your renewal 
premium is due Nov. 8, 1989, or later, your bill may not arrive on time. Your 
insurance coverage will not be affected by this delay and will remain in force 
if you do send payment of your premium when your bill does come." Gillespie has 
said she hopes to promulgate the new regulations, making a driver's safety 
record a more important factor in pricing than where a driver lives, about the 
end of November.

STRONGER MORTGAGE BROKER CODE OF ETHICS CALLED FOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California's real estate commissioner Tuesday urged passage of a strengthened 
code of ethics for mortgage loan brokers as a way to protect the public from 
unscrupulous operators and "enhance the professionalism" of the state's real 
estate industry. 
</P>
<P>
In a public hearing at the State Building, Commissioner James A. Edmonds Jr. 
took testimony from industry representatives on a series of proposed changes in 
regulations governing the real estate and mortgage loan businesses. 
</P>
<P>
While a code of ethics already exists, the changes would outline more 
specifically what constitutes illegal and unethical business practices, 
especially in mortgage loan brokerage, analysts for the state Department of 
Real Estate said. 
</P>
<P>
"The industry has been under fire," said Robert McCabe, the department's 
northern regulatory manager. "The regulations are action being taken to 
strengthen how you do business out there in a more professional, legal, ethical 
manner." 
</P>
<P>
Edmonds cited a recent article by The Times that recounted numerous criminal 
and civil cases involving alleged equity-lending fraud as evidence of the need 
for better regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The new code of ethics spells out several "acts and omissions" that would be 
considered to be "fraud" or "dishonest dealing" and could be grounds for losing 
a real estate broker's license. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
* Misrepresenting to a borrower that there is an existing lender when there is 
not one. 
</P>
<P>
* Misleading the purchaser of a loan about the borrower's ability to pay it 
back. 
</P>
<P>
* Knowingly underestimating closing costs. 
</P>
<P>
* Offering "free" services in a loan transaction when there is in fact a hidden 
fee. 
</P>
<P>
* Failing to account to a borrower how any advance fees are spent. 
</P>
<P>
* Lying about terms and conditions of a loan that uses real property as 
collateral. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction from industry representatives, including the 100-member California 
Independent Mortgage Brokers Assn., was mixed. 
</P>
<P>
They voiced general support for the measures but objected to labeling all bad 
practices as "fraud or dishonest dealings" because such language might make it 
easier for borrowers and others to sue brokers.

STUDY OF RATS LINKS DISEASE TO DEFECT IN BRAIN'S STRESS RESPONSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Individuals who are calm and easygoing, unflappable in the face of a crisis, 
may be more susceptible to arthritis than those who are more excitable, 
according to a new study by researchers at the National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers have traced arthritis susceptibility in rats to a defect in the 
brain's regulation of the stress response, the first time the crippling disease 
has been linked to temperament or behavior. 
</P>
<P>
If their discovery, recently reported in the prestigious Proceedings of the 
National Academy of Sciences, is confirmed in human studies that are now 
beginning, it may lead to new ways to screen for arthritis susceptibility and 
to new treatments directed at stress-sensitive brain circuits. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery is "a very significant observation" that may also have widespread 
application in the study of other "autoimmune" diseases such as diabetes and 
multiple sclerosis in which the immune system attacks its host, said 
endocrinologist Allan Munck of Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
Arthritis, which is characterized by swelling or deterioration of the joints, 
aches, stiffness and fatigue, is the nation's primary crippler. More than 1 
million Americans develop arthritis each year and an estimated 35 million -- 
one in every seven Americans -- suffer its symptoms. It is two to three times 
as common among women as among men. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the various forms of arthritis account for 27 million lost workdays 
annually and cost the U.S. economy an estimated $8.6 billion per year, 
including $4.4 billion in hospital and nursing home services, according to the 
Arthritis Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have long known that certain genes associated with the immune system 
create a predisposition to arthritis, in which white blood cells severely 
damage the protective membranes surrounding the joints. Environmental insults 
to the body -- the pounding on the joints caused by jogging, for instance -- 
also trigger arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
Some people with genetic susceptibility do not develop the disease, however, 
and researchers have long believed that some other factor must be involved. The 
NIH researchers now believe that they have identified that factor. 
</P>
<P>
Rhematologists Esther M. Sternberg of the National Institute of Mental Health 
and Ronald L. Wilder of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal 
and Skin Diseases in Bethesda, Md., have been working with two strains of rats, 
one of which is highly susceptible to arthritis and one that isn't. 
</P>
<P>
When cell walls of streptococcus bacteria are injected into the joints of the 
one strain of rats, called the Lewis strain, white blood cells from the immune 
system attack the joints as well as the injected cellular material. They 
produce swelling and inflammation leading to an arthritis that is "remarkably 
similar to the human disease," Wilder said. 
</P>
<P>
But when the same bacterial material is injected into another strain, called 
the Fischer strain, little or no inflammation occurs and the rats remain 
healthy. Wilder and others have been searching for many years for the 
biochemical difference between these two strains of rats in the belief that the 
knowledge could hold a clue to understanding human arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
Sternberg, in contrast, has been examining ways in which the brain might be 
involved in arthritis. One way is in the production of hormones called 
corticosteroids, which are the most potent naturally occurring suppressors of 
inflammation. The synthetic corticosteroid cortisone, for example, has been 
used to treat arthritis since the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Corticosteroids are produced by the adrenal glands, walnut-sized organs that 
sit atop the kidneys, in response to a chemical signal secreted by the part of 
the brain known as the hypothalamus. That signal is a hormone called CRH. 
</P>
<P>
Sternberg's contribution was the recognition that this process of controlling 
the immune response is stimulated by production of CRH in response to a 
chemical released by the white blood cells at the site of the inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
To test the theory, Sternberg and Wilder gave the rats a chemical that blocked 
CRH production at the same time that they injected the rats with bacterial 
cells. Within hours after the injection, the arthritis-resistant Lewis rats 
began getting developing arthritis. By stopping CRH production, the researchers 
had removed normal restraints on the rats' immune systems, and they were 
ravaged by their own runaway immune responses. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequent research showed that the arthritis-prone Fischer rats had a similar, 
naturally occurring block in CRH production that caused arthritis. "Although 
the disease is in the joints, the defect is in the brains," Wilder said. 
</P>
<P>
The defect lies in the region of the brain that controls the animals' response 
to stress. The researchers do not yet know if the defect causes any behavioral 
abnormalities in the Fischer rats because no one had thought to look for such 
abnormalities before. But Wilder is looking now. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the researchers are designing studies to determine if the same type 
of defect -- where there is an inadequate response to stress -- is present in 
the brains of humans who develop or are susceptible to arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
"You run into people who panic under trivial conditions," Wilder said. "Others, 
nothing seems to upset them." Those differences in response might be linked to 
the same type of defect observed in the mice. 
</P>
<P>
The brain defect may also play a role in other autoimmune diseases, such as 
multiple sclerosis. The arthritis-prone Fischer rats can develop a disease very 
much like MS if they are injected with ground-up nerve tissue. And British 
researchers have recently shown that naturally occurring corticosteroids can 
induce a spontaneous remission from the experimentally induced disease, 
indicating a link between the brain and immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
Wilder and Sternberg are encouraged about the possibility that a brain defect 
will be found in humans because NIH researchers have recently shown that 
defects in CRH production can cause depression, and persistent depression has 
long been associated with arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
"A number of drugs that they use to correct depression . . . really do reset 
the immune response," Wilder said. The new results, he added, "give us new 
impetus to look at a large variety of drugs, some in use and some sitting on 
the shelves of research labs at pharmaceutical companies. This gives us a whole 
new way of attempting to correct arthritis susceptibility." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clue to Arthritis' Cause 
</P>
<P>
Researchers create arthritis in susceptible rats by injecting them with 
bacterial cell walls. The rats have a brain defect that prevents the synthesis 
of a hormone called CRH, and white blood cells proliferate freely, damaging the 
joint. In healthy rats, the process works this way: 
</P>
<P>
1. When researchers inject cell walls into rat joints, white blood cells attack 
the foregin invader. They also release interleukin-1, which travels to the 
brain. 
</P>
<P>
2. Interleukin-1 stimulates the brain to secrets CRH. 
</P>
<P>
3. CRH stimulates the adrenal gland to secrete steroids, such as cortisone, 
that suppress white blood cell activity in the joint. The cell walls are 
destroyed, but no joint damage occurs.

An ambitious, long-term plan to develop high-speed train routes linking major 
Southwest cities -- including Los Angeles, Anaheim, San Diego, San Francisco, 
Phoenix and Las Vegas -- will be considered by a special two-state commission 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
"We envision an eventual network of trains operating up to 300 (m.p.h.) among 
the major centers of the Pacific Southwest region," California Assemblyman 
Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) told a U.S. Senate subcommittee Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Katz, chairman of the California-Nevada Super Speed Train Commission, said the 
agency was created by the legislatures of the two states "to oversee the 
privately financed introduction of modern intercity ground transportation." 
</P>
<P>
Its efforts reflect increasing interest across the country to build such 
systems after two decades in which the West Germans, French and Japanese have 
moved ahead in a technology that was introduced by two American scientists in 
1971. 
</P>
<P>
Katz appeared before the surface transportation subcommittee of the Senate 
Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. The panel was soliciting 
testimony on the role the federal government should play to encourage 
construction of high-speed trains through research and development, tax 
incentives and enforcement of safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates, including Gilbert E. Carmichael, administrator of the Federal 
Railroad Administration, touted the potential of advanced rail technologies to 
ease overcrowded freeways and airports, reduce pollution and transport riders 
between congested urban centers. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the proposed California-Nevada system, other high-speed rail projects 
are in progress in Florida, Ohio and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Private investors could begin construction in Florida next year of a 
$600-million, 17-mile West German magnetic levitation rail link between Orlando 
Airport and Walt Disney World, Carmichael told the subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Katz predicted that construction on the California-to-Las Vegas line will begin 
in 1993 and be completed in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
The $4-billion "gambler's special" will connect Las Vegas to a Southern 
California terminus -- either Anaheim in Orange County or Sylmar or Mission 
Hills in the northeast San Fernando Valley. The Valley route would include 
Palmdale Air Terminal in the Antelope Valley; the Anaheim route could also 
include separate commuter service through San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-member commission is expected to announce its decision on a route on 
Oct. 27. A consultant's report released last week gave Anaheim a strong 
advantage based on projected ridership. 
</P>
<P>
At the same session, the commission will be presented with the non-binding 
proposal to develop additional high-speed lines linking 10 population centers 
throughout California with Las Vegas, Reno and Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
The system plan, as well as each leg of the proposed rail lines, would have to 
be approved by the state legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a concept that the bistate commission is considering adopting as its 
long-range goal," said commission Executive Director Paul Taylor, who drew up 
the proposal. "It always helps to know where you're headed when you start 
something." 
</P>
<P>
The commission decided to take the step even though its mandate is limited to 
attracting a private entity to develop a high-speed train between the Las Vegas 
area and Southern California, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission will be dissolved at the end of 1991 unless the two state 
legislatures extend it. The long-range plan could take as long as 50 years to 
implement, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's adoption of the broader plan might be intended to blunt the 
dismay of municipalities excluded from the first leg. The long-term plan 
includes stations in Los Angeles and the Antelope Valley as well as Orange 
County and the Inland Empire. 
</P>
<P>
The cities of Anaheim, Los Angeles and Palmdale have tried to persuade the 
commission to locate the terminal in their back yards. The California and 
Nevada legislatures will have to approve the decision because the train line 
will be built on the Interstate 15 right-of-way most of the way to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said the long-range plan was not an attempt to enhance the credibility 
of the original train route, which was the brainchild of Las Vegas gambling 
interests seeking to bring in larger numbers of patrons. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt that's what the commission had in mind," Taylor said. "Actually, the 
forecast for increased earnings in the two economies is greater for California 
than for Nevada."

GAME 3 POSTPONED BECAUSE OF EARTHQUAKE

The World Series was postponed Tuesday night when an earthquake shook northern 
California shortly before game time, damaging and forcing evacuation of crowded 
Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
A decision on when and where Game 3, between the Oakland Athletics and San 
Francisco Giants, will be played will not be made until today. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball commissioner Fay Vincent said there were cracks in the stadium and the 
extent of damage would not be known until later in the night. No major injuries 
were reported. 
</P>
<P>
One possibility was that the Series would be moved back to Oakland, where the 
A's won the first two games Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
A section in the upper stands in right field separated by about six inches, and 
several cracks ran down the concrete aisle and broke off. Fans were carrying 
them home as souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
"The people two to three rows in front of me had big pieces of metal several 
inches, fall on their heads," said David Guzzetti, a city council member from 
Chico, Calif. "The light towers were just rocking back and forth. I couldn't 
believe it." 
</P>
<P>
The quake registered 6.5 to 7.0 on the Richter scale 10 miles north of Santa 
Cruz. It shook buildings in Sacramento, 95 miles to the northeast, and was felt 
as far away as Reno, Nev., 225 miles to the east. 
</P>
<P>
Aftershocks continued at least 45 minutes after the quake struck at 5:05 p.m. 
Players stayed on the field for 30 minutes before the game was postponed. Many 
of them left with their families. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sitting on the bench and at first I thought it was the fans stamping 
(their feet)," Oakland Manager Tony La Russa said. "Then right away I realized 
what was happening." 
</P>
<P>
Said A's outfielder Dave Henderson: "You can't stop concrete. Forget the World 
Series." 
</P>
<P>
Eric Gregg, a 6-foot-3 umpire, admitted his fear. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to be a big tough guy," he said, "but I was scared senseless. I couldn't 
fit under the table and finally I went to stand under some arches." 
</P>
<P>
Oakland right fielder Jose Canseco was standing with his wife when the tremor 
hit. He said he looked up at fans yelling at him and thought, "Geez, look at 
that. They still want us to play." 
</P>
<P>
An hour after the earthquake was felt, about two-thirds to three-fourths of the 
sellout crowd of 60,000 were still in their seats, but police began evacuating 
the upper deck about 5:40 p.m., 10 minutes after the game was scheduled to 
start and moments after a second aftershock was felt at the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
The power in the stadium was knocked out and some phone lines were affected. 
</P>
<P>
The first-aid station at Candlestick reported a few people were hit by falling 
debris and were being treated. None of the injuries was said to be serious.

Welcome to Georgetown basketball 1989, when Sam Jefferson and Anthony Allen 
(combined scoring average of 1.3 points in 1988) could turn out to be just as 
important as Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo, who will both start this 
season, John Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
This is a team whose overall success may best be measured by a pinch of this 
and a dash of that, just like in the cakes that Anna Thompson used to make for 
her son John. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Mourning, a sophomore, and Mutombo, entering his junior season, 
will be in the forefront for the Hoyas. Mourning averaged 13.2 points and 7.3 
rebounds with 169 blocked shots in establishing himself as one of the most 
dominant players in the country during his first collegiate season. Mutombo, a 
native of Zaire, was a relative basketball novice last year but still proved to 
be a ready reserve, blocking 75 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps anticipating the havoc the duo could create on defense, or maybe 
thinking ahead about countering a Syracuse front line of LeRon Ellis, Derrick 
Coleman and Billy Owens, Thompson said he will put them on the court at the 
same time. 
</P>
<P>
"Dikembe has to play a more significant role for us this year; he will be a 
significant part of the program," Thompson said this week during the team's 
media day. "I think they both have to become more comfortable with playing 
together and if they can it will give us some advantages. I would suspect there 
would be some disadvantages too -- we wouldn't be able to apply as much 
pressure and we'd have to play more zone defense -- but we'll have to wait 
until we get out on the floor and see." 
</P>
<P>
Mutombo, who averaged just over 11 minutes per game last season, said he's 
looking forward to the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll have much fun; the blocked shots will go high this year," he 
said. "I'm feeling more comfortable. Last year I had to learn the American 
game, the language -- the basketball language too. I didn't feel sad that I 
didn't play that much, but now I'm ready." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem is finding someone to replace departed seniors Charles 
Smith and Jaren Jackson. They totaled nearly 40 percent of the team's points a 
year ago, Smith, the former Olympian averaging 18.7 points, with Jackson 12.3. 
Perhaps more importantly, they were the glue for a team that went 29-5 and came 
within one game of the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
"I've told the kids time and time again that someone is going to have to step 
up, that they are going to have to show more responsibility," Thompson said. 
"That has happened every year -- who would have predicted that Smitty would 
turn out to be Smitty." 
</P>
<P>
That's where seniors Jefferson and Allen come into play, as far as Thompson is 
concerned. Jefferson had seven points and eight rebounds in an 85-77 loss to 
Duke in the final of the East regionals last season; if the Hoyas could get 
that kind of regular production from one or both men this year, Thompson would 
be elated. 
</P>
<P>
What he is expecting is leadership. Conversely, the other two seniors on the 
team, Mark Tillmon and Dwayne Bryant, will be counted on to both score and 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
With Mourning and Mutombo playing together, Georgetown can expect to see a 
steady diet of collapsing zones.

Forget about baseball. People are dying. 
</P>
<P>
Who cares when they continue the World Series? Who cares if they continue it? 
Don't worry about a Godforsaken World Series when bridges are collapsing, when 
buildings are on fire, when bodies are being dragged into trauma centers and 
morgues. San Francisco and Oakland are not fighting for a trophy. They are 
fighting for their lives. 
</P>
<P>
When President Kennedy was assassinated, they went ahead and played 
professional football, because they said the he would have wanted it that way. 
When young Israelis were slaughtered at Munich, they went ahead with the 
Olympic Games. When President Reagan was shot in the street, they went ahead 
with the college basketball championship game, because they said he would want 
it that way. 
</P>
<P>
Well, stop wanting it that way. Stop wondering how this earthquake is going to 
affect San Francisco's pitching rotation. Quit talking about life going on, 
about business as usual, about what a terrible thing this is that just as the 
Giants and Athletics finally get to meet in a Bay Bridge World Series, the 
bridge splits in two. This isn't about the World Series going on. This is the 
world going on. 
</P>
<P>
Have some respect. Have some compassion. Stop being a sports fan, for once in 
your life. Be a human being. 
</P>
<P>
In 1942, the Rose Bowl was moved from Southern California to North Carolina 
because of fears of a World War II invasion on the West Coast, after Pearl 
Harbor. What does it take for people to come to their senses -- another World 
War? Northern California will be digging out from under this for weeks, for 
months, for years. Families are being devastated, children turned into orphans, 
businesses burned to the ground. And you want to play baseball today? You want 
to play bloody baseball? 
</P>
<P>
We do not even so much mind whether the World Series resumes as we do where it 
resumes. Move it to Los Angeles, to San Diego, to Seattle. Anybody on the 
Giants who complains about losing home-field advantage, take them outside and 
slap them twice across the face. Ask them if they think the mourners of the 
earthquake's dead give a damn whether they play the Athletics at Dodger Stadium 
instead of Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
Think. Think hard. Think about it happening to you. Think about some nearby 
college happily playing a football game while a hurricane has leveled your home 
and frightened your children and left your neighbors without electricity and 
windows. That's what happened last month to people in South Carolina. They 
turned on their television sets and saw local college kids playing football, 
spectators laughing. 
</P>
<P>
This is a living nightmare, this earthquake. This isn't some bothersome 
inconvenience. We do not care one tiny bit whether building inspectors declare 
Candlestick Park structurally sound after examining the cracks in the cement. 
We couldn't care less whether the light fixtures escaped damage or whether no 
aftershocks are expected. Have some respect. 
</P>
<P>
You say other public companies open for business the next day even during 
catastrophic conditions? Listen, not many businesses invite ticket-buyers to 
weave through the rubble of people's lives so they can cheer at the top of 
their lungs and guzzle beer and make comic faces at television cameras. To go 
ahead with a World Series baseball game today in San Francisco would be 
grotesque beyond belief. 
</P>
<P>
This is no time for entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
There are few silver linings to be found at a time when a sporting event is 
interrupted by a natural disaster, except to thank God that 63,000 people from 
all walks of life, crammed into a stadium, were not more grimly affected 
Tuesday than they were. 
</P>
<P>
Why the gods chose to strike down San Francisco with another quake at the exact 
time the World Series returned to that great city, we can only shake our heads 
and wonder. Ours is not to reason why. 
</P>
<P>
But, we can reason now. We can reason that there is restoration to do, 
rebuilding, regrouping, recovery -- that this is no time to be talking about 
pitching, but to be talking about pitching in. Some of the Giants and A's 
couldn't resist making jokes about the earthquake being an omen, about being a 
message from above that their team is going to shake things up. Black humor 
abounds at times such as these. 
</P>
<P>
There are times, however, to have a little good taste and common sense, and 
most of all there are times to have a heart. The World Series can wait a few 
days, at the very least. It should be taken elsewhere, out of the line of fire. 
Nobody should dare equate this measly thing with "bad luck," as if baseball 
related to the quality of human life. San Francisco has already lost. So has 
Oakland, San Jose, Santa Cruz. To hell with baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Once in a while, we are called upon to act responsibly. If the people who run 
baseball decide to go ahead and play baseball, then shame on them, shame on 
them forever. It would not be the first time. It had better be the last.

DODGER, ANGEL FACILITIES COULD PRESENT OPTIONS

The tragic earthquake that jolted the Bay Area Tuesday has left the World 
Series in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
Could it be resumed? Should it be resumed? Where? 
</P>
<P>
Will structural damage rule out further play in Candlestick Park or the Oakland 
Coliseum? 
</P>
<P>
Does anybody have the stomach to play games while dead are being buried, 
injured treated and homeless cared for? 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, Tuesday was not the time for decisions to be made, but one 
possibility would be to move the Series out of the area. The most logical spot 
would be the Southland, where there are two big ballparks -- Dodger Stadium and 
Anaheim Stadium -- and the facilities to house the large group involved. 
</P>
<P>
"All I could say is purely speculative," said Angel public relations director 
Tim Mead. "Local (Bay area) officials, including the mayor, are supposed to 
meet (today) to assess the damage. The Oakland Coliseum will have to be looked 
at as well and then take the next step from there. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, at this point, baseball is secondary. The World Series is so 
important for baseball, but, for now, its secondary. I don't even know what the 
mood will be for several days. I'm sure the Dodgers and Angels will be ready to 
do whatever baseball requires. But again, it's so speculative. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, there is nothing in the textbook to tell you how to handle a 
situation like this. (General Manager) Mike Port is there in San Francisco. So 
is Kevin Uhlich, the stadium operations director. From reports I saw on 
television, I would say the chance of moving the Series is doubtful." 
</P>
<P>
Contacted at home, Dodger Vice President Fred Claire, when asked about the 
possibility of staging games at Dodger Stadium, said: "I have no idea. That 
would have to come from the commissioner. There is too much there for me to 
even speculate until we receive word from the commissioner's office." 
</P>
<P>
The logistics of making such a move would be staggering. The Anaheim Stadium 
infield has already been covered for football. The Rams play host to the New 
Orleans Saints Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
How long would the Series be postponed? How soon could tickets be printed? Who 
would get them? 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, nobody was interested in addressing such questions. 
</P>
<P>
Two neighboring cities that had shared the thrill of battling each other on the 
baseball field had suddenly been united in tragedy. Canseco and McGwire, Clark 
and Mitchell were on the same side. They were among the survivors. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing else mattered. Certainly not a baseball championship.

WORDS IGNITE USC-NOTRE DAME RIVALRY

<P>
It's been more than 60 years since Knute Rockne supposedly implored his 
Fighting Irish to win one for the Gipper. 
</P>
<P>
Both George Gipp and the Rock are long-since gone, but the practice of firing 
up the troops not only is alive and well at South Bend, Ind., but is being 
employed for Saturday's Notre Dame-USC showdown. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz is imploring his Fighting Irish to win 
one against the Ripper. 
</P>
<P>
That would be USC Coach Larry Smith, who is said to have ripped Notre Dame in a 
Times story, written last spring, that has found its way onto the Notre Dame 
bulletin board. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking during spring practice of last year's Irish victory over USC, Smith 
said: "People say we were out-coached and not physical enough against Notre 
Dame. That's not true. We out-coached them, out-blocked them and out-tackled 
them. We made about seven critical mistakes, and Notre Dame, being a good, 
sound football team, took advantage and turned them into points." 
</P>
<P>
Those words didn't create much of a stir at the time, but they were quickly 
brought up by Notre Dame linebacker Ned Bolcar Tuesday in a national conference 
call with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like the losing team doesn't want to give us much credit," he said. 
"It gets kind of discouraging after a while. You play well for 12 games. You go 
out to the West Coast and beat a team and their coach says, they out-hit, 
out-coached and out-hustled us. If he says so, that's his business. He saw the 
film. But after we play them again Saturday, maybe he'll have a different 
opinion this time." 
</P>
<P>
When Bolcar's words were relayed to Smith, the USC coach replied, "Was he at my 
(press) conference? No? Then I guess it's something his coach told him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what we're getting involved in here is a blackboard war. To me, it has 
no bearing on this week. We have great respect for them and all that kind of 
thing. If they want to play that game in the newspaper, fine. I think the game 
will be played on the field." 
</P>
<P>
But the mind games have been going on all week. 
</P>
<P>
With the final whistle still echoing in his ear Saturday after USC's 31-15 
victory over California at Berkeley, Smith started talking about Notre Dame, 
equating the Irish talent with that of the Rams and the San Francisco 49ers, 
saying that if the Trojans continued to rack up the penalties as they did 
against the Bears, Notre Dame would beat them, 90-0. 
</P>
<P>
"They may be the best team in 20 years," Smith said. "If we play the way we did 
(against Cal), we'll go up there and get killed." 
</P>
<P>
Holtz was quick to answer with a self-inflicted shot of his own. He chose to 
denigrate his secondary. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the performance of his defensive backs against Air Force 
quarterback Dee Dowis last Saturday, Holtz said, "If he had thrown a hand 
grenade in there, the only one who would have been injured would have been the 
receiver." 
</P>
<P>
But beyond all the golly-gee-they're-such-a-great-team-and 
we'll-just-hope-to-show-up-and- not-embarrass-ourselves hype, there is no 
denying that Saturday's game at South Bend matches two powerhouses. Notre Dame 
is the defending national champion, still No. 1 in the nation and has won 18 in 
a row. USC, expected to contend for the national title, has won five straight 
since a season-opening loss to Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
There's another streak, however, that sticks in USC's craw. The Trojans have 
lost six in a row to Notre Dame, having scored their last win over the Irish in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
"They're on a mission," Holtz said. "We're on a mission, too, but we just don't 
necessarily know what it is. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that we've won six in a row against them, some people might say the 
odds are against us. That's nonsense. What happens this year has nothing to do 
with the last six. Or the last 50. This is a new game." 
</P>
<P>
It's a game Smith is calling "the biggest challenge of my career -- as far as 
psychologically, X's and O's, blocking and tackling, you name it." 
</P>
<P>
It certainly shapes up as the biggest challenge of USC quarterback Todd 
Marinovich's young career. The redshirt freshman has played in only six games, 
but he has known about the importance of USC-Notre Dame all his life. 
</P>
<P>
How could he escape it? 
</P>
<P>
His father, Marv, was a linemen for the Trojans and co-captain of the 1962 
national championship squad. 
</P>
<P>
And his uncle, former USC quarterback Craig Fertig, led one of the great Trojan 
comebacks against the Irish. 
</P>
<P>
The year was 1964. Notre Dame was top-ranked, unbeaten, and, seemingly, 
unaffected by anything the Trojans could throw at them, leading USC, 17-0, at 
the half. But the Trojans came back and won, 20-17, scoring the final points on 
a 15-yard touchdown pass from Fertig to Rod Sherman with 1 minute 33 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich says that when he goes to his uncle's home, Fertig often finds an 
excuse to pull out the tape of that game. 
</P>
<P>
"I see it almost yearly," Marinovich said. 
</P>
<P>
How does he feel about stepping into the midst of this storied rivalry on the 
road with just half a season's experience? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'll be spooked going in," he said. "I don't know how spooky 
that field is. It's the same size field, I think, 120 yards long. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to try to get the crowd out of the way right away by making some 
big plays. Good players play best in big games and that's what I'm going to try 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
As well as trying to keep his mind away from the mind games. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Trojan flanker John Jackson sprained an ankle last Saturday against Cal, but 
practiced Tuesday and is expected to play against the Irish. So will defensive 
back Ernest Spears, who also sprained an ankle Saturday. The news is not so 
good for running backs Aaron Emanuel and Scott Lockwood. Emanuel, who suffered 
a shoulder injury against Washington and hasn't played since, remains 
questionable for the Notre Dame game. Lockwood, who has been sidelined since 
dislocating a thumb opening night, is highly doubtful for Saturday. Defensive 
lineman Randy Hord is questionable with an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
Although Larry Smith has lost both games he has coached against Notre Dame 
while at USC, he split two games against the Irish while at Arizona, beating 
Notre Dame in South Bend in 1982, 16-13. . . . The South Bend Tribune-Irish 
Fall Classic, a two-game baseball series between USC and Notre Dame, will be 
held Thursday and Friday at South Bend's Stanley Coveleski Regional Stadium. 
Former Irish coach Ara Parseghian, former USC quarterback Pat Haden and Kansas 
City Royal infielder George Brett will throw out the ceremonial first pitches.

MORNING BRIEFING: DODGER FUTURE HOLDS PROMISE IF THIS TRIO KEEPS ON TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARR KLUENDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Do Dodger fans have cause for hope? Claire Smith of the Hartford Courant thinks 
so. Smith writes: "In June, the Dodgers plucked three prospects, using their 
choice as well as the New York Yankees' first-round choice and a pick between 
the first and second rounds as compensation for losing free agent Steve Sax to 
New York last winter. 
</P>
<P>
"Those three choices were pitchers Kiki Jones and Jamie McAndrew and outfielder 
Tom Goodwin. 
</P>
<P>
"Jones and McAndrew were a combined 19-0 with a 1.62 ERA for the Dodgers' 
short-season Class A Pioneer League in Great Falls (Mont.). Goodwin hit .308 
with 60 stolen bases in 63 games for Great Falls. 
</P>
<P>
"Those numbers have to be comforting to a team that went from the World Series 
championship to the slag heap in the last year." 
</P>
<P>
Add Dodgers: "Eddie Murray, who averaged 28 homers, 99 runs batted in and a 
.295 average in his dozen years in Baltimore, was unhappy and unproductive in 
his first season with the Dodgers, hitting only .247 with 20 home runs and 88 
RBIs. Now there are hints that the unhappy camper wants to go back to the 
Orioles. The enigmatic Murray probably can't, however, until he gets past that 
little problem he has with Frank Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems Murray has carried on a lopsided feud with Robinson because Robinson 
did not give Murray's brother a chance when Robinson was the San Francisco 
Giants' manager and Murray's brother was in the Giants' minor league system. So 
Murray's No. 1 ground rule when it came to Robinson was not to speak to the 
Hall of Famer. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though Murray supposedly has had a change of heart, some believe it would 
take nothing less than a head transplant for the Orioles to ever consider 
letting Murray back in." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: When Cub General Manager Jim Frey was a coach for the Baltimore 
Orioles under Manager Earl Weaver, what five other future managers were Oriole 
coaches? 
</P>
<P>
Something fishy: San Francisco 49er Coach George Seifert, on having his team 
kick an extra point before the instant replay official could nullify a 
touchdown by Jerry Rice, who dropped the ball before he got in the end zone: 
</P>
<P>
"It's in the books. It's a touchdown. Often when I go fishing, I'll catch a 
fish, and I get it right up to the boat and about that time the hook will come 
out of its mouth and the net will go under the fish and it'll be in the box. I 
guess you could debate whether, in fact, I actually caught the fish or not, but 
it was in the box. And I ate it." 
</P>
<P>
Dollar defense: How to stop the University of Houston's passing attack? Simple. 
Expect a Hail Mary pass on every play and use only one down lineman on defense. 
Said Texas A &amp; M defensive coordinator Bob Davie after the Aggies beat the 
Cougars, 17-13, Saturday: "Every play we treated like the last play of the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Bill Hunter, George Bamberger, Frank Robinson, Ray Miller and 
Cal Ripken. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: The Oakland Athletics' Dave Parker on his leisurely home run trot: 
"I've hit over 300 of these. I deserve the opportunity to run them out any way 
I want to." GARR KLUENDER

CHARGERS TRADE BANKS, GET NELSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chargers traded linebacker Chip Banks Tuesday and added a running back in 
separate deals that beat the National Football League's trade deadline by less 
than half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers sent Banks, who has a history of drug problems, to the 
Indianapolis Colts in a conditional deal that will bring them at least one 1990 
draft pick and maybe more, depending on how well the former USC linebacker 
performs in Indianapolis and whether he remains drug-free. 
</P>
<P>
Banks, 30, recently completed a 90-day drug-treatment program in the San Diego 
area after having been arrested five times in the last 18 months on 
drug-related charges. 
</P>
<P>
Charger owner Alex Spanos had agonized for weeks over whether to give Banks 
another chance with his team after he had publicly said that the five-time Pro 
Bowl player would never play for the Chargers again. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had this kind of pressure put on me," Spanos said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Spanos finally said that he would allow Banks to return to the Chargers next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
That apparently was not good enough for Banks, who informed the Chargers he 
wanted to play in 1989. They accommodated him by making the trade. 
</P>
<P>
In the other deal, the Chargers acquired veteran Viking running back Darrin 
Nelson from Dallas for a fifth-round pick that the Cowboys immediately shipped 
to the Vikings as a condition of the multi-player deal that sent running back 
Herschel Walker to the Vikings last week. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, 30, refused to report to Dallas last week after the Walker trade and 
threatened to retire. But he told his agent, Tony Agnone, that there were 
certain teams he would play for if a trade could be arranged. The Chargers were 
one of those teams. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Cowboys also traded holdout quarterback Steve Pelluer to the 
Kansas City Chiefs for a high draft choice in 1990 and 1991. The Cowboys also 
acquired running back Paul Palmer from the Detroit Lions for a 10th-round draft 
choce.

BENJAMIN HAS LEFT L.A.; CLIPPERS WILL FEEL EFFECTS OF DEPARTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
Out of sight, out of mind? 
</P>
<P>
Not at about $20,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
That's how much the Clippers will still be paying Benoit Benjamin in deferred 
compensation from his original contract four years ago, even as Benjamin begins 
a separate one-year deal with Philips Milano in Italy. Payments to the 
fifth-year center will run the length of the National Basketball Assn. season. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers' most recent offer to their former team captain also included 
deferred payments, which didn't seem to bother him nearly as much as the 
proposed incentive payments to keep his weight under control. The complete 
package, including bonuses, could have been worth more than $3 million for two 
years, the Clippers holding the option on the second season. 
</P>
<P>
"We made it clear we were willing to pay based on performance and not 
potential," said Clipper General Counsel Alan Rothenberg, who handled the 
negotiations. "We were not interested in paying Ben millions of dollars and 
then watching him struggle to get through practices. He didn't want any part of 
the weight clause, which made us believe that he wasn't ready to put forth the 
right effort." 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin, typically soft-spoken around strangers, arrived in Milan Tuesday 
night and talked to about 20 reporters as if he were back at the news 
conference in the Inglewood YMCA. He said he's in good shape, ready to play and 
looking forward to Italian basketball. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of Benjamin leaves the Clippers with no center capable of the same 
impact as the league's sixth-best shot blocker. Coach Don Casey, who stays out 
of contract negotiations, knows only that he needs bodies. 
</P>
<P>
They do seem to be in short supply for the Clippers, who since July 1 have 
lost: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Quintin Dailey, who for all his problems (see: Lakers, 1989 training camp), 
did average 16.1 points a game last season before the Clippers decided not to 
pick up the option on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Danny Ferry, who also signed to play in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the Clippers' starting center, starting shooting guard and their No. 1 
draft choice are gone, with nothing to show in return. 
</P>
<P>
The only additions to a team that went 21-61 and finished last in the Pacific 
Division for the third consecutive season are a pair of second-round choices, 
Jeff Martin and Jay Edwards, although a couple of the free agents figure to 
stick, too. 
</P>
<P>
Partly because of bad luck, partly because of bad decisions, the draft in 
recent years hasn't yielded much more than a quiet breeze to the 1989-90 
Clippers, at least with the No. 1 picks. Among them are: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1989, Ferry, arrivederci. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1988, Danny Manning, who will not be back until December at the earliest 
after suffering a knee injury last season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1987, Reggie Williams, the current starting shooting guard. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1986, Dwayne Polee, gone. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1985, Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1984, Lancaster Gordon, gone. 
</P>
<P>
The three years before that yielded starters, who became stars, but with other 
teams -- Byron Scott, with the Lakers; Terry Cummings, with the Milwaukee 
Bucks, and Tom Chambers, with the Seattle SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the Clippers have been left empty-handed before. But Benjamin's 
departure apparently marked an end of innocence. They became so fed up with 
paying someone who had been so roundly criticized around the league that they 
stood their ground. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks earlier, management, pleased with the progress of guard Gary Grant, 
tore up his three-year contract and rewarded him with a new four-year deal. A 
similar deal was also completed Tuesday with Ken Norman, who was beginning the 
final season of a three-year contract that would have paid him $450,000 for 
1989-90. The new package is four years at $4.4 million. Money was not the main 
issue with Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike a year ago, when the salary cap was a major concern with Manning coming 
in, there are no such worries this time. Raises are being handed out; 
Benjamin's $1-million price tag for 1988-89 will remain on the payroll as the 
Clippers retain his NBA rights as a restricted free agent, and there's still 
room to spare if a trade opportunity comes along. 
</P>
<P>
They barely went over the limit last season, and the cap increased from $7.232 
million to $9.802 for 1989-90, without the Clippers having to sign a 
high-priced first-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
Or a high-priced center. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Don Casey, who spent a brief time as coach of Club Scalavini in Italy, on 
Benoit Benjamin's decision: "I think he was very anxious and would have liked 
to get (his contract) resolved. But I don't think this was a good basketball 
decision for him."

Losing State University (1-4) remained locked in misstep. 
</P>
<P>
But the shocker was UCLA's 35-point loss to . . . Nebraska? Oklahoma? No, 
Arizona. The explanation? The Mildcats switched to the I formation, which a few 
hundred other schools have used over the years. Although Arizona still fielded 
the usual 11 players on offense, the Bruins were so befuddled that they came 
away with Comedown of the Week honors. 
</P>
<P>
No. 2 UCLA fell into a tie with Southeastern Massachusetts, which helped 
Fitchburg (Mass.) State end the nation's longest losing streak (34 games). 
Fitchburg Coach Dave Secino, who runs a tailoring business on the side, 
obviously made some alterations for the game. 
</P>
<P>
So you figured that because winless Ohio U. was playing winless Miami (Ohio) 
that someone would come away with a victory, right? Final score: 22-22. At 
least, they won't be tie-less this year.

The Packers just couldn't do anything right. First, there was Green Bay, 
reviving memories of great Bays of old by tumbling to the Minnesota Herschels, 
14-26. 
</P>
<P>
Then, there was the investigation by a Colorado forensic scientist that 
reaffirmed a jury's verdict of more than a century ago -- that mountain man 
Alferd Packer did, indeed, kill and eat five fellow miners on an expedition 
near Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay, always hungry for victories, had Alferd in mind when it adopted 
"Packers" as a nickname. 
</P>
<P>
After the examination of Packer's victims, they were re-buried in the 
Meadowlands in an unused portion of the Giants Stadium end zone.

RAMS STIR UP SECOND-GUESSERS WITH PREVENT DEFENSE STRATEGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bar-stool critics rise again, questioning the Rams for playing prevent 
defense in Buffalo's last-minute, game-winning drive at Rich Stadium Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Prevent what? The Bills, under the direction of quarterback Frank Reich, drove 
64 yards on seven consecutive completions against the Rams' safety zone, 
scoring the winning touchdown with 16 seconds left on an eight-yard scoring 
pass from Reich to Andre Reed. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, the Rams never let a Bill receiver behind them, yet lost, 
23-20. 
</P>
<P>
The prevent debate rages every time the situation arises, as it did Monday 
night just moments after the Rams seemed to pull off their own miracle finish 
on Flipper Anderson's 78-yard scoring reception from Jim Everett with 1:22 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Why didn't the Rams come after the quarterback, especially Reich, a first-time 
starter with only minimal National Football League experience? Why let him sit 
in the pocket, with no pass rush, and dump the ball off to Thurman Thomas time 
after time? 
</P>
<P>
"It's an interesting question," Ram Coach John Robinson said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
On a wet and slippery night, Robinson opted to stay back and prevent the big 
play, rushing only four defenders, then three, on the drive. 
</P>
<P>
What scared him? 
</P>
<P>
"It's the one on one," he said. "It's you and me, and if I slip on the wet turf 
and you catch it, it's over." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Rams allowed the Bills the short reception but slipped while 
trying to cover those plays, too. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a dilemma," Robinson said. "I'm not saying one's right and one's wrong. 
The guy that's frustrated says, 'Why did they play prevent?' has to turn around 
and say, 'Why did Buffalo let Willie Anderson run all the way for a touchdown.' 
You've got to answer that if you want to debate it." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's strategy was to make Reich throw seven or eight passes on the drive 
in the hope that he would either mess up or the Rams would make a few plays. 
Neither happened. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play it well," he said. "I'm not defending the playing of it, 
because they moved the ball down there and scored. But if we'd have tackled him 
twice, then the game would have been over. Just two tackles." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson reminds all that it's the same bend-don't-break defense his team used 
to beat the Super Bowl champions a few weeks back. 
</P>
<P>
"San Francisco tried it on us and couldn't score (a touchdown)," Robinson said. 
"And San Francisco is the big-play team of all time. And we took those away 
from them." 
</P>
<P>
If Joe Montana can't score on it, who can? Frank Reich, as it turned out. 
</P>
<P>
The morning after: Robinson's challenge this week is keeping his team's 
emotions in check after losing a game the Rams seemingly stole after Anderson's 
improbable scoring reception. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to tell them, 'So what, you lost,' " Robinson said. " 'Now you've got 
10 more; how many of those can you win?' The question never was: Can you go 
16-0? Are you some sort of a Cinderella? We never believed it was. That's the 
way it is. It'll either be toughening for us and make us more aggressive, and 
mean, or it could have an effect. I doubt it will have a negative effect. I 
think it will make us stronger." 
</P>
<P>
So you thought the Rams were going to win every game? 
</P>
<P>
"I think you have to keep the whole thing in perspective," Robinson said. "The 
Super Bowl champions last year lost six games. Atlanta kicked the . . . out of 
them. We beat the . . . out of them. That's what the season is." 
</P>
<P>
How many chances did the Rams have to win before Reich's miracle last-minute 
touchdown drive? Let us count the ways. 
</P>
<P>
Here are three crucial second-half plays that could have kept the Rams 
undefeated: 
</P>
<P>
 -- With the Rams leading, 10-6, the Bills faced second and 10 at their own 49. 
Reich's pass intended for Andre Reed on the right sideline passed right through 
cornerback Jerry Gray's arms and deflected to Reed for a nine-yard gain. Had 
Gray made the catch, he might have scored, putting the Rams up, 17-6. Instead, 
the drive was kept alive and ended in a Buffalo field goal, cutting the Ram 
lead to 10-9. 
</P>
<P>
 -- With 8:50 left and the Rams leading, 13-9, Reich lofted a long pass toward 
Reed down the right sideline. The pass was well short of its target, but Gray 
mistimed his leap, and the ball sailed over his head to Reed for a 47-yard 
reception, leading to Buffalo's go-ahead touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the same drive, the Bills faced third and eight at the Ram 37 when Reich 
was sacked by Brett Faryniarz and Bill Hawkins, taking Buffalo out of 
field-goal range. But safety Anthony Newman was called for holding on the play, 
giving the Bills a first down at the 32. A few minutes later, Reich hit Thomas 
on a one-yard scoring pass to put Buffalo up, 16-13. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Greg Bell gained all 44 of his yards Monday night in the first half, in 14 
carries. In the second half, he carried seven times for no yards. In fact, the 
Bills held the Rams to zero net yards rushing in the second half and only 59 
for the game. Why? Coach John Robinson said the Bills threw eight-man fronts at 
the Rams in the second half and dared them to pass in the sloppy weather. . . . 
Flipper Anderson's league-leading yards-per-catch average of 30.9 improved to 
32.8 after two catches for 87 yards against Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams must activate linebacker Mark Jerue today by 1 p.m. or waive him. With 
Fred Strickland hobbling on a badly sprained left ankle, it appears that the 
team could use Jerue, who had a 109-tackle season in 1986. Jerue started 12 
games last season at inside linebacker before his knees gave out, requiring 
more off-season arthroscopic surgery. Because of injuries, the Rams have yet to 
field their starting inside linebacker team of Strickland and Larry Kelm. . . . 
Of Strickland, Robinson said: "I can't imagine him playing this week." 
</P>
<P>
As the trading deadline passed Tuesday, rumors of a Gaston Green deal were 
greatly exaggerated. Ram sources confirmed that Green was never close to being 
shipped to Phoenix, which was one rumor circulating. Of course, there is always 
going to be speculation concerning Green, the team's first draft choice in 
1988, because he has yet to produce. . . . Neither Green nor this year's 
first-round pick, Cleveland Gary, played a down Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' game against the 49ers at Anaheim Stadium Dec. 11 is officially a 
sellout. . . . Kicker Mike Lansford has made 12 of 14 field-goal attempts this 
season, his misses coming from 43 and 50 yards. . . .

<P>
The Dallas Cowboys continued their trading spree and the San Diego Chargers 
made a couple of deals before Tuesday's National Football League trading 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys, who last week traded running back Herschel Walker to Minnesota in 
a 12-for-1 swap, traded holdout quarterback Steve Pelluer to the Kansas City 
Chiefs for a high draft choice in 1990 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas also obtained and traded a running back, with the Cowboys getting Paul 
Palmer from the Detroit Lions for a 10th-round draft choice and then dealt 
running back Darrin Nelson, obtained in the Walker trade, to San Diego for a 
middle-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers' other deal involved drug-troubled linebacker Chip Banks, who was 
traded to the Indianapolis Colts for unspecified conditional draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
Banks, who recently completed a 90-day drug rehabilitation program, played for 
San Diego in 1987 after being acquired in a draft-day deal that year from the 
Cleveland Browns, with whom he was an all-pro in four of five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
He sat out the 1988 season after rejecting a five-year, $4.7-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
Between February 1988 and June of this year, he was arrested four times in his 
native Atlanta on cocaine and marijuana possession charges. He also was 
arrested on a sexual abuse allegation but charges were never brought in that 
case. 
</P>
<P>
According to Steve Ortmayer, director of football operations for the Chargers, 
the team felt it was in Banks' best interest to continue his after-care 
recovery program in San Diego and sit out the remainder of this season. 
Ortmayer said that Spanos offered to pay for Banks after-care and then allow 
him to return to the team in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave Chip every chance and every consideration to be a Charger in the 
future, starting next year," Ortmayer said. "We did not think it was in his 
best interest to play in 1989. There were some questions we had in our mind 
relative to jumping back into the midst of a season in a stressful situation. 
He wanted to play very badly in 1989 and that opportunity will come to him from 
the Indianapolis Colts." 
</P>
<P>
Banks signed a one-year contract with the Chargers before the trade could be 
made. Terms of the contract were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson had refused to report to the Cowboys. Ortmayer said he spoke with 
Nelson's representatives and received assurances Nelson would come to San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect him to be in the lineup Sunday," Ortmayer said.

LEMIEUX SCORES THREE GOALS IN 7-5 WIN 
</P>

<P>
After five National Hockey League games last season, Mario Lemieux was already 
being called the new Great One, better than Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
He had nine goals and in one game he scored eight points. He went on to win the 
scoring title and help the Pittsburgh Penguins finally reach the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
In his first five games this season the big, powerful center had only one goal 
and nine points. Lemieux said he was a step behind a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Lemieux of last season showed up Tuesday night at Pittsburgh, scoring three 
goals and assisting on another to lead the Penguins to a 7-5 victory over the 
weak Toronto Maple Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's coming slowly," Lemieux said after getting his 22nd hat trick. "I still 
have a ways to go." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Gene Ubriaco, who seemed to be the only one not concerned about Lemieux's 
slow start, said: "The big guy has been right at the doorstep of doing this. 
He's ready now." 
</P>
<P>
Calgary 8, Quebec 8 -- In the wildest finish of the early season, the defending 
champion Flames tied a league record by scoring short-handed goals four seconds 
apart at Quebec to tie the Nordiques. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames trailed, 8-6, when Gary Roberts was penalized for roughing with just 
19 seconds left in regulation. The Flames pulled their goalie. At 19:45, Doug 
Gilmour scored with a quick shot from the left faceoff circle. Then at 19:49, 
Gilmour fed Paul Ranheim off the ensuing faceoff for the tying goal. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the final period the Flames pulled into contention by scoring three 
goals in 27 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 6, New York Islanders 3 -- Former King defenseman Larry Murphy 
assisted on five goals at Uniondale, N.Y., as the surprising North Stars 
remained the only unbeaten team in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota, which won only 27 of 80 games last season, are 5-0-1. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 3, New York Rangers 3 -- Greg Gilbert's wrist shot off a pass from Troy 
Murray with 3:21 left in regulation play at New York gave the Blackhawks a tie.

BUFFALO'S LAST STAND DROPS RAMS FROM RANKS OF UNBEATEN 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the game secured, intended messages sent, Greg Bell's clock rung, Frank 
Reich discovered, the unbeatens beaten and 1:33 remaining, a football game 
unraveled at the seams and unfolded into Monday night history. 
</P>
<P>
The Buffalo Bills defeated the Rams, 23-20, before 76,231 at Rich Stadium on an 
eight-yard scoring pass from Reich to Andre Reed with 16 seconds remaining. But 
one play doesn't begin to tell the story of the Bills, who in a span of 1 
minute 17 seconds, won a game, lost a game and snatched a game back, using a 
near-impossible scenario that included a quarterback making his first National 
Football League start. 
</P>
<P>
It started routinely with Bill tailback Thurman Thomas, who was running out the 
clock on a presumed 16-13 victory, the Rams helpless after failing on fourth 
down at their own 22. Thomas headed into the line and was stripped of the ball 
by linebacker Mel Owens. Michael Stewart recovered at the 22 with 1:33 left and 
one last breath to be breathed. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jim Everett heaved a pass down the middle to Flipper Anderson, who 
somehow eluded defenders Kirby Jackson and Leonard Smith on a 78-yard touchdown 
play with 1:22 left, deadening a sellout crowd and sending the Rams into 
gyrations of elation on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills were left with three timeouts and 64 yards to cover in just over a 
minute behind Reich, Jim Kelly's replacement and a man who once went three 
years without throwing a pass in this league. 
</P>
<P>
It was thought that Reich had worked his one miracle for the evening, leading 
the Bills on a fourth-quarter drive that ended with a one-yard scoring pass -- 
the presumed game-winner -- to Thomas with 2:23 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Reich is a boot salesman by trade, a quarterback by perseverance. In his first 
four years in the league, Reich threw a total of 20 passes. On the game-ending 
drive, he tossed seven -- all completions. 
</P>
<P>
When he took control behind center at his own 36 with 1:17 remaining, the 
Anderson catch firmly embedded, there seemed little chance. But the Rams were 
laying back, and Reich chopped them to pieces, the first deep cut coming on an 
18-yard pass to Thomas to the Ram 43. With 26 seconds left, Reich dumped a pass 
to Thomas for 15 yards to the Ram 22. 
</P>
<P>
"We were trying to keep the big play from happening," Coach John Robinson 
explained later. "Whatever it was, it didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
Then came a swing pass to Ronnie Harmon, who moved passed safety Vince Newsome 
for 14 yards to the Ram eight. Twenty seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
What could Reich have up his sleeve? Who before Monday night could have cared? 
</P>
<P>
Reich's final strike to Reed, running a post pattern, was brilliant. Reed lined 
up left and cut to the middle in front of cornerback LeRoy Irvin. 
</P>
<P>
All night, the naive Reich stared in the eyes of Ram defenders, tipping his 
hand on many occasions. But on the game-winner he checked-off to the right, 
where Keith McKellar was in motion, but then fired back to Reed. 
</P>
<P>
Reed crossed the goal's plane with 16 seconds left, briefly stopping Ram hearts 
while sending Reich into the night a hero. 
</P>
<P>
"This was really a great thrill for me," Reich said. "I waited a long time for 
this opportunity and I'm just overjoyed for this team." 
</P>
<P>
In three weeks or so, when Kelly's separated shoulder is healed, Reich returns 
to the bench, maybe for three weeks, maybe three years. With this memory, you 
guess it won't matter. For most of the game, Reich played the part of 
journeyman, but he made sure his flaws would be well-buried in the story. 
</P>
<P>
It was a game in which the final two minutes outshone the first 58 by light 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously," Robinson surmised later, "it was one of the more dramatic finishes 
you could imagine. It was going to be a miracle finish, but it just did not 
turn out that way." 
</P>
<P>
It was not a miracle beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Sutton, the ex-Ram cornerback who keeps following his former teammates 
around the league -- he's already faced the Rams as a Green Bay Packer this 
season -- set up the Rams' first score when he fumbled a wind-blown punt at his 
16 with 7:08 left in the quarter. On third and eight at the 14, Everett dumped 
a pass over the middle to Buford McGee to get the Rams a first down at the 
four. One play later, Everett found McGee again on a three-yard scoring pass. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Bills' defense, inspired by Bruce Smith and Cornelius Bennett, and no 
doubt the running mouth of Greg Bell, refused let the Rams pull away. 
</P>
<P>
With 6:13 left in the half, the Bills, with great pleasure, forced Bell to 
fumble for the first time in 112 carries this season. Jeff Wright recovered at 
the Ram 20, and although the drive stalled there, Buffalo made it 7-3 on Scott 
Norwood's 38-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills shut down the Ram offense again on the ensuing possession, and got 
the ball back with 2:16 left at the Ram 49. 
</P>
<P>
Reich hit Reed on passes of nine and five yards to help get Buffalo close 
enough for Norwood. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the Bills barely managed. Norwood's 47-yard field goal with 
56 seconds left grazed the crossbar on its way over, cutting the lead to 7-6 at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, who made no secret this week his disdain for Buffalo, was generally 
crushed at every turn. He gained 44 yards in 21 attempts but vowed to move on. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the media tried to hype this game," Bell said. "I just tried to go out 
and play the best football that I was capable of playing. Tomorrow morning we 
will wake up and this game will be history. We are going home 5-1 instead of 
being 6-0." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams had so many chances to prevent a miracle finish it bares inspection. 
On the first play of the second half, Thomas, who gained 105 yards in 24 
carries, fumbled at his 33. But the Rams were knocked out of field goal range 
when Smith sacked Everett for a five-yard loss to the 37. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the third quarter, with the Bills driving in Ram territory, Reich's 
pass went through cornerback Jerry Gray's hands and bounced into Reed's for a 
nine-yard gain. Had Gray held on, he might have scored. Instead, the Bills 
drove on and cut the lead to 10-9 on a 40-yard field goal by Norwood with 14:09 
left. The Rams drove 60 yards on their next possession, but again had to settle 
for three -- on Lanford's 36-yarder -- instead of seven.

FAN REACTION: MOST SAY THEY WERE SCARED FROM THE JOLT JUST BEFORE GAME 3 WAS 
SUPPOSED TO START. AT FIRST, SOME WERE NOT SURE WHAT HIT THEM.

<P>
The banner's message, an innocent taunt on Tuesday afternoon, became ominous 
after the fans had scattered and left the large bedsheet hanging alone in the 
right-field upper deck, Section 31. 
</P>
<P>
"I am the the Giant," read the banner draped on Candlestick Park's back wall. 
"I will be heard." 
</P>
<P>
And so it was heard before Tuesday's scheduled Game 3 of the World Series 
between the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics. The quaint, 29-year-old 
stadium viciously shook 63,000 fans and players into their worst nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
Some, like the loony fans who inhabit the third deck, actually came out of it 
laughing. Others came out of it praying. But most came out of it as did umpire 
Al Clark, who dashed from the locker room and ran onto the field in his 
underwear, swearing. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared, I was absolutely scared," Clark said after the earthquake. "This 
is not in our manual." 
</P>
<P>
The full impact of the quake did not seem to hit people until 30 minutes later. 
By then, police cars were circling the stadium while officers inside announced 
on bullhorns that the game had been postponed. Players and their families, whom 
they had ushered out of the stands immediately after the quake, headed to the 
parking lot, most of them arm in arm. 
</P>
<P>
And the general feeling seemed to be: Just how important is the World Series 
anyway? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even want to think about the Series now," said A's third baseman 
Carney Lansford. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball means nothing," said Giants' hitting coach Dusty Baker. "Baseball is 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Baker was one of the few still in the clubhouse when the quake hit. Most 
players and coaches were on the field, awaiting introductions. When the 
rumbling started, Baker was one of the first to shout, "Earthquake!" Baker said 
he was only thinking of his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"She's always told me, 'Daddy, in case of an earthquake, stand under a 
doorway,' " he said. "So I found a doorway and stood there. Then I remembered 
how I always taught her not to panic. So I told myself not to panic. 
</P>
<P>
"If everyone had panicked, it would have been like an English soccer match out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Yet inside, several players said they did panic. 
</P>
<P>
Marty DeMerritt, the Giants' pitching coach, said:" It felt like I had 
swallowed my chewing tobacco. I saw the earth move. I saw the outfield grass 
just roll." 
</P>
<P>
Said Giant catcher Terry Kennedy, who was in the clubhouse at the time: "I 
heard somebody yell, 'Earthquake!' I got the hell out of there. I saw (Greg) 
Litton and (Pat) Sheridan and it looked like their knees were about to 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"And we're down 0-2 in the Series? Check your priorities, man." 
</P>
<P>
Outwardly, however, both players and fans remained cool. For the fans in the 
third and highest deck, incredibly cool. 
</P>
<P>
As the rumbling started, fans in that deck began cheering, their voices growing 
by the second. When the rumbling finally stopped they erupted in a standing 
ovation. Few of them wanted to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"(The Giants) haven't played a World Series game since I've been alive," said 
Tom Rainey of San Francisco. "I thought maybe they still won't but I ain't 
leaving." 
</P>
<P>
Added Heinz Ludke, of Sacramento: "I've been coming to Candlestick for 25 years 
and this is the most exciting event I've been to." 
</P>
<P>
One upper deck fan who didn't find it so funny was Robert Urban of San 
Francisco. His seats were in Section 5, Row 23, the very top row. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a diving board up there," he said as he headed for the exits, 
which were soon jammed with people after the quake. "You could see spaces 
opening in the top of the stadium." 
</P>
<P>
Tony Varnhagen of San Francisco said the noise was one of the scariest sounds 
he had ever heard. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard the scoreboard rattling," he said. "I saw people rocking and rolling." 
</P>
<P>
As Steve Heath of Redwood City ushered his young son, Steve Jr., from their 
second-level seats down an exit ramp, he said: "At first we thought it was a 
bunch of people stomping on us from the upper deck. Then we started bouncing. 
Even if they play this game, we aren't staying." 
</P>
<P>
Warned Stan Baron of Mountain View: "I don't think they'll ever play a game in 
Candlestick again. We're all standing around here on cracks." 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Mike Krukow of the Giants, who said he saw the backstop move 15 feet, 
said: "All I could think of was, this could be an incredible disaster. 
Something like this puts baseball way down on your priority list."

ROZELLE KNOWS HOW TOUGH WORLD SERIES DECISION IS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The postponement of Game 3 of the World Series after a devastating earthquake 
hit the San Francisco Bay Area is the first time a major sports event has been 
delayed because of a natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
However, it is not the first time a postponement of a major sports event has 
been considered. National Football League Commissioner Pete Rozelle was widely 
criticized in 1963 for allowing NFL games to continue the weekend after the 
assassination of President John F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
It was a decision Rozelle has long regretted. 
</P>
<P>
"As I've said before, I wouldn't have played those games if I could make the 
judgment again," Rozelle said Tuesday night from New York. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tragedy and a President was involved (making it even larger in 
magnitude)." 
</P>
<P>
Rozelle also said that the earthquake may cause Sunday's New England 
Patriots-San Francisco 49ers game to be moved from Candlestick Park to Foxboro, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking into the possibility of transferring the game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rozelle sympathized with the difficult decisions that await baseball 
Commissioner Fay Vincent. 
</P>
<P>
"In circumstances like this, you don't make a decision until you have to. In 
this particular situation, you wouldn't decide at least until overnight. Then 
I'd make a decision based on the circumstances."

EXPERIENCE AT CANDLESTICK IS ONE REPORTER WILL NOT SOON FORGET

There are events one never forgets. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who was alive in 1963 remembers where he was when President Kennedy was 
assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
And anyone who was at Candlestick Park Tuesday night for Game 3 of the World 
Series will never forget. 
</P>
<P>
I was in a trailer just outside the stadium, about to watch the telecast when 
the earthquake hit. It was shortly after the network went on the air. 
</P>
<P>
My immediate reaction was that a jet was flying very low overhead, but soon I 
knew what was happening. 
</P>
<P>
To me, the earthquake was not as bad as the Whittier quake in October, 1987, 
mainly because I was awake this time. 
</P>
<P>
I opened the door to the trailer and looked out. The stadium was shaking and 
the special concrete joint -- one of several strategically spaced around the 
top of the stadium to prevent earthquake damage -- was doing was it was 
designed to do. It was opening and closing as if the place was made of 
cardboard instead of concrete. 
</P>
<P>
A few people were running out of the stadium, but there did not seem to be 
great alarm, because the quake did not last long. 
</P>
<P>
I walked into the stadium to interview fans. And again, I sensed little panic. 
</P>
<P>
Most people stayed in their seats, waiting to hear whether the game would be 
postponed. 
</P>
<P>
And later, when fans started leaving en masse, the reaction of those I talked 
to varied. Those who were sitting in the upper deck seemed considerably more 
shaken than those in the lower levels. LARRY STEWART

NEWSWIRE: SURGERY TO SIDELINE WOOLRIDGE AT LEAST 3 WEEKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forward Orlando Woolridge will be out of action a minimum of three weeks after 
bone chips were removed from his right knee during arthroscopic surgery Tuesday 
at Centinela Hospital Medical Center in Inglewood, the Lakers announced. 
</P>
<P>
Woolridge, James Worthy's backup at small forward, will likely miss at least 
the first week of the National Basketball Assn. season, which starts Nov. 3. 
However, the Lakers said they do not expect Woolridge to miss a significant 
portion of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Laker General Manager Jerry West said he was relieved at the result of what 
Laker physician Stephen Lombardo termed diagnostic arthroscopy. The Lakers had 
feared that Woolridge might have suffered cartilage damage.

STATWATCH: WELL-ROUNDED BLACKWELL LIFTS HART'S OFFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hart High's Howard Blackwell does not have overwhelming statistics in any 
offensive category, but the senior tailback remains the only area player among 
the top 10 in rushing yardage, receptions and scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Blackwell (5-foot-10, 175 pounds) scored four touchdowns for the second 
consecutive game in Hart's 47-11 rout of Burroughs on Friday. Blackwell's 14 
touchdowns give him 84 points, third among Valley scoring leaders. 
</P>
<P>
He has rushed for 519 yards (ninth) and nine touchdowns in 85 carries (a 
6.1-yard average). He also has caught 21 passes (eighth) for 425 yards and five 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's the best back in the Valley," Hart Coach Mike Herrington said. 
"It's just that we're a throwing team and he's not going to get a lot of 
rushing yards." 
</P>
<P>
Defense: Nick Ochoa, a 5-11, 215-pound defensive end at Thousand Oaks, has a 
team-high 14 sacks -- 11 in the past two weeks. Ochoa had seven against Simi 
Valley and added four in a 21-0 win over Camarillo last week. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon defensive back Joe McKeon, in his first varsity start, tied a school 
record with three interceptions against Ridgecrest Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
Offense: Canyon quarterback Tim Beidle tied a school record with five touchdown 
passes against Ridgecrest Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley, which has been outscored, 170-63, this season, has not scored 
in 14 of the past 16 quarters and has been shut out in two of its past three 
games. 
</P>

Including Friday's shutout, Camarillo has been blanked by Thousand Oaks three 
times in the past five years, scoring only nine points in five games. 
</P>
<P>
Scoring: Monroe kicker Rachel Gagliano, who became the first girl to score a 
point in a City Section varsity football game when she made a conversion kick 
last week, can become the state record-holder among girls if she scores 11 more 
points. Mia Labowitz of San Diego High kicked eight PATs and a 32-yard field 
goal in 1987.

TEMBLOR SPURS REVIEWS OF ORANGE COUNTY'S PLANNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Top Orange County officials vowed Tuesday night to immediately begin reviewing 
the county's earthquake preparedness plan, acknowledging that the county is not 
ready for a disaster such as the one that hit the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
"If that quake had struck Orange County, we'd have similar problems," said 
Christine Boyd, manager of the county's disaster planning agency. "We've taken 
some steps to get ready, but we've got a ways to go. This serves as a good 
lesson, and hopefully it will push to get us going." 
</P>
<P>
County Administrative Officer Larry A. Parrish said he told key members of his 
staff by telephone late Tuesday to review the county's preparedness plans. But 
Parrish would not predict whether the 6.9-magnitude quake in the Bay Area will 
mean more local money for countywide emergency preparedness. He would say only 
that the disaster may have a "very sobering effect on our financial 
priorities." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, a sweeping plan designed specifically to help the county prepare for 
such a calamity was created. Known as the Southern California Emergency 
Preparedness Project, the plan covers everything from educating the public on 
how to prepare for a major quake to deployment of equipment, medical supplies 
and volunteers during such a catastrophe. But so far, the county has spent less 
than $300,000 on the plan, which Parrish said would cost about $12 million to 
implement fully. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point," Parrish said, "it's not within our capacity. . . . The 
temptation there is to say whatever it takes, we'll spend it. But perspective 
is critical. I just think we need a little time to assess what's worked and 
what hasn't." 
</P>
<P>
Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, while supporting Parrish's 
review of the county's response plans, said that paying for such preparations 
is difficult in light of the county's fiscal condition and pressing needs. 
</P>
<P>
"The amounts of money you're talking about make it very difficult to finance," 
Riley said. "You got jails. You've also got the homeless. You've got 
innumerable projects that are crying out (for county money). These have greater 
appeal to all of us. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess most of us think it can't happen to us. You just hope it doesn't 
happen here," he added. 
</P>
<P>
But Boyd, manager of the county's Emergency Management Division, said the Bay 
Area quake serves as a graphic lesson that she hopes will stir commitment to 
local preparedness efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that if anything constructive can come out of this tragedy, it's that 
people must prepare," Boyd said. "The San Andreas Fault is not exclusive to the 
Bay Area. It can happen here, and we've got to redouble our efforts to get 
ready." 
</P>
<P>
The San Andreas passes about 30 miles northeast of the Los Angeles Basin. But 
many earthquake experts say Orange County residents face an even greater threat 
from the Newport-Inglewood Fault, which travels along the county coast from 
Newport Beach to Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
A cadre of county emergency officials, from utility managers to physicians, 
were preparing Tuesday night to lend assistance to the quake-relief effort in 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
The National Guard's 40th Division, based in Los Alamitos, has been placed on 
alert, but no troops or equipment have yet been dispatched to aid in quake 
relief, a National Guard spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd's agency sent one of its senior coordinators to the Bay Area to observe 
recovery operations. County fire officials were on alert, prepared to send 
medical and fire equipment as well as volunteers to quake-stricken areas. 
</P>
<P>
The local Red Cross chapter opened its emergency disaster center in Santa Ana 
to answer calls from county residents concerned about friends and relatives in 
the Bay Area. Red Cross Director George Brown said about a dozen volunteers 
answered calls from anxious county residents, many of them wondering how to 
safeguard their homes in event of a similar quake. The Red Cross information 
line is (714) 835-5381. 
</P>
<P>
"It always happens, but it takes pictures of a major disaster on TV to get them 
concerned about their preparedness," Brown said. "In a way, maybe that's good, 
but I just hope people get the message." 
</P>
<P>
County residents were also urged Tuesday night not to phone the Bay Area. 
Pacific Bell spokeswoman Linda Bonnekson said the few phone lines still working 
in the Bay Area are overloaded with calls, complicating and slowing relief 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Because phone service is so critical, Bonnekson said that Pacific Bell conducts 
quarterly drills with dozens of employees at its large Tustin operational 
center. The facility employs more than 1,000 workers, including several shifts 
of operators. 
</P>
<P>
"With roads knocked out, the phone becomes a key tool in coping with an 
emergency of this type," Bonnekson said. "We try to train our people how to 
deal with the disaster and keep working at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
For Robert Bade, a county emergency medical physician, the Bay Area quake 
underscored the need to develop a network of private doctors ready to roll 
should a quake strike. Bade has been pushing for six years to establish a team 
of "quake-ready" doctors, a program that has received nearly $25,000 in seed 
money from county officials. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, Bade spoke Tuesday to two civic groups in Tustin and Dana Point 
on this very subject. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to the kind of topic that would put a luncheon group to sleep," Bade 
said. "Now, after seeing those remarkable and sad pictures on TV, maybe people 
will start to take this seriously. I think they are."

SUPERVISORS OK FUNDS FOR ANTI-CRIME DNA TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The Orange County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to make the county 
Sheriff's Department the first law enforcement agency in California and only 
the third in the nation to have a genetic testing laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors voted 4 to 0 to spend $200,000 for equipment and technicians and 
construction of the facilities in the county morgue building in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The laboratory will make possible DNA -- or deoxyribonucleic acid -- profiles 
of unique genetic codes in everything from hair and skin samples to blood and 
other body fluids, helping prosecutors tie evidence to a crime suspect. 
</P>
<P>
The lab will be in operation by late December and two chemists should be ready 
to take their first case by January, 1990, coroner's office spokesman Larry 
Ragle said. The lab will include $80,000 in special equipment, the most 
expensive being a video-imaging system, an environmental incubator, a genetic 
evaluation system, scales and a chromatography refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that this DNA lab will make a wonderful present for the people of 
Orange County to have under their Christmas trees for 1989," Supervisor Don R. 
Roth said. "And let the word go out into the criminal world that Orange County 
will have the most modern crime-fighting tools in our arsenal -- a DNA lab," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The county also will include a genetic testing laboratory as part of the 
county's planned new forensics building that will be built in two years. 
Because the Sheriff's Department has been training the two employees in genetic 
research, Orange County is perhaps more than a year ahead of Los Angeles or the 
state in operating a genetic testing laboratory, Ragle said. The state plans to 
build its main DNA lab at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Some staff members said they could not remember when an issue was dealt with so 
quickly by Orange County supervisors. Questions on financing the lab surfaced a 
little more than two weeks ago, and since then, county administrators prepared 
a lengthy report on the feasibility of such a laboratory. That report was 
approved Tuesday by the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The latest push for the DNA lab followed the recent rape of a 12-year-old girl 
in a gated community in Huntington Beach. It was learned that the suspect 
arrested in that case earlier had been acquitted of a rape charge after 
prosecutors were late in receiving DNA evidence from an outside lab. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who stirred some hard feelings when she said at 
the earlier board meeting that she identified more with rape victims than the 
four male supervisors, was absent for the vote Tuesday because she was in 
Washington on county business. But in a prepared statement, Wieder said the lab 
approval "will go a long way toward ensuring that residents of Orange County 
receive the best law enforcement services available." 
</P>
<P>
Roth, who called for the study on how to fund the DNA lab without using general 
fund money, praised the district attorney's office, the county counsel's office 
and the Sheriff's Department for completing the report in "record time." The 
report said the lab could be self-sufficient in the future, especially if it is 
designated a regional facility by the state. 
</P>
<P>
None of the start-up funds will come from the county's general fund. About 
$120,000 of the needed amount will come from Neighborhood Development and 
Preservation funds, raised from county property taxes and designated for 
redevelopment projects, along with $80,000 raised by the Sheriff's Advisory 
Council from private sources in the county. The county counsel has determined 
that use of redevelopment funds for the lab is legal. 
</P>
<P>
There remains some uncertainty, however, about the admissibility of such 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
According to Orange County's lawyers, the highest appeals court in Virginia has 
ruled that DNA evidence is admissible, and DNA evidence has been admitted in 
trial courts in 32 states, including a case in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp approved use of so-called 
"genetic fingerprinting" evidence in criminal cases. But there have not yet 
been any California appellate cases or any California statute on the 
admissibility of DNA testing evidence in California Courts, said Barbara L. 
Stocker, deputy county counsel.

TRAIN KILLS WOMAN WHOSE CAR IS TRAPPED IN TRAFFIC; 
</P>

ACCIDENT: SURROUNDING CARS TRIED IN VAIN TO MAKE ROOM FOR HER MERCEDES-BENZ AT 
A CROSSING WHERE THE CITY OF IRVINE HOPES SOMEDAY TO BUILD AN OVERPASS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman whose car became stuck on railroad tracks in heavy commuter traffic 
screamed and honked her horn in vain before a speeding Amtrak train barreled 
into her vehicle, killing her. Seconds before the train struck, Mary A. Shaw, 
47, of Irvine, nudged her car hard against the back bumper of the car in front 
of her in a panicky attempt to save her own life, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
As the train neared, she stopped screaming and looked straight down the track 
as if in quiet resignation, said a motorist stuck in traffic directly ahead of 
Shaw's car along Culver Drive. 
</P>
<P>
"She kind of looked at the train and watched it come," said witness Becky 
Bennett of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The train struck the rear of Shaw's car at an estimated 70 m.p.h., twisting it 
into a block of flaming wrecked steel and throwing her to her death a few feet 
away. No one aboard the San Diego-to-Los Angeles train was injured. 
</P>
<P>
A friend of Shaw, Eddie Heimstra, said Shaw so disliked driving that she logged 
only about 3,000 miles a year and avoided freeways. He said Shaw was a 
well-liked, outgoing woman who had just dropped her two teen-aged children off 
at school and was driving to the Irvine design agency where she worked as a 
purchasing agent. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at one of the two intersections where city officials have 
sought for years to build an overpass above the train tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Rush-hour traffic and fog were thick when the accident occurred. Police, 
however, were hesitant to point to either as a direct contributor to the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw was headed south on Culver shortly after 8 a.m. when she reached the 
railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"The lights started flashing and the arm started coming down," said Kelly 
Albright of El Toro, who witnessed the accident from another lane. "She had 
already started through (and) the front of her car was underneath the bar. So 
she thought she could make it through." 
</P>
<P>
She drove as far forward as she could, but about a foot of her 1972 
Mercedes-Benz remained in the path of the train. Other drivers, alerted by her 
screams and honks of the horn, tried as best they could to make room. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Bos, directly behind the woman's car, said he backed up to give Shaw 
enough space to clear the tracks. "I saw her panicking right in front of me and 
I was waiting for her to open her safety belt and run," Bos said. 
</P>
<P>
Becky Bennett, whose car was in front of Shaw's, tried to make room for Shaw by 
moving her own vehicle forward until she pushed into the bumper of the car 
ahead of her. Bennett, too, was screaming and honking to encourage other 
motorists to help as well. 
</P>
<P>
The train was traveling so fast that it could not come to a halt for nearly 
three-quarters of a mile, according to an Amtrak official at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Sue Martin, an Amtrak spokeswoman in Washington, said buses arrived to take 
passengers to their destinations about two hours after the accident. But since 
the train was cleared to proceed to Los Angeles Union Station about that time, 
some passengers elected to stay aboard. The accident delayed other Amtrak 
trains on the Los Angeles-San Diego line for as much as two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Public Works Director Harry Ehrlich said plans for overpasses at that 
crossing at Culver Drive, as well as at a second one over Jeffrey Road, have 
stalled amid costs estimated at $23 million and opposition from neighboring 
residents about the proposed height of the structures. 
</P>
<P>
The Culver intersection is one of 44 crossings in Orange County where cars must 
avoid the 14 to 16 trains, both passenger and freight, that run along the Santa 
Fe Railroad tracks daily, according to authorities. Another 27 crossings are 
separated from the tracks by overpasses or underpasses. 
</P>
<P>
But Irvine officials said accidents are rare. The need to improve traffic flow, 
rather than safety considerations, was the primary force behind the proposal 
for overpasses at Culver and Jeffrey. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw's death came as a major blow to her co-workers at Beckham-Eisenman in 
Irvine, a commercial design and furniture company. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a total loss to all our employees. We had to allow most of our 40 
employees to go home because they were so upset," Stephen Eisenman said. He 
called his purchasing agent of the last four years "a super dedicated person." 
</P>
<P>

DIANNE KLEIN: COURAGE AND DIGNITY WON'T GIVE IN TO AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dianne Klein 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first time I saw Vince Chalk was two years ago, in the library of Irvine's 
University High School. There were lots of cameras around, network television 
crews and reporters with notebooks at the ready. 
</P>
<P>
We were all staring at Vince Chalk. We all wanted to know how he felt. 
</P>
<P>
On that day, good was how Vince felt, almost buoyant. He'd just won a landmark 
case in federal appeals court that gave him the right to return to his job 
counseling deaf students. 
</P>
<P>
This was a right that the court had to hand back to Vince Chalk, as it might a 
criminal seeking redemption, because he has AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
People are afraid of AIDS. They have reason. No one has more reason to fear 
AIDS than Vince Chalk does. 
</P>
<P>
It is killing him, cruelly. 
</P>
<P>
I went to see Vince last week, not in a hospital -- where he has spent a lot of 
his time -- but on the job in his small, cluttered office at the high school. 
Three days a week, work is his therapy. 
</P>
<P>
"I love to work," he told me. "It's real depressing to me not to have this. If 
I can't work, then I've lost my quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
But on some days, Vince expends nearly all his energy on the drive to school 
from his home in Long Beach. Then he doesn't have the strength to drive home. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to be real honest with myself about how I feel," he says. "It's 
taken me a long time to admit that I don't feel well, that I shouldn't always 
come in." 
</P>
<P>
Over the months, I've been calling Vince on the phone, asking him how he has 
been feeling. I consider him a friend. 
</P>
<P>
Bad, mostly, is how he has been feeling. Usually we'd set a time to see each 
other, but at the last minute, he would cancel. He wanted to feel good, he 
said. He wanted to be up. He wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Chalk will be 45 years old on Sunday. He tested positive for the HIV 
virus four years ago, but a year before that he was hospitalized with a form of 
pneumonia common among AIDS patients. He believes he's been ill with AIDS for 
at least five years. 
</P>
<P>
It's getting harder to remember how good once felt. 
</P>
<P>
"In my mind, all my plans are tentative," he says. "I'd like to be positive. 
I'd like to plan to go to the 'Phantom of the Opera.' But I can't." 
</P>
<P>
But today in Irvine is not an especially bad day, not for Vince. He is down to 
140 pounds, 25 less than what he likes, but three weeks ago, he weighed in at 
135. Our conversation is interrupted by his coughs and later by the beeper that 
commands him to take his pills. 
</P>
<P>
This time there are five. 
</P>
<P>
The drugs aim to treat what the medical specialists call the "opportunistic 
infections" that prey on people carrying the HIV virus. These predators have 
names that Vince Chalk had never even heard of a few years back. Now he 
pronounces them with the sad authority of someone who knows them too well. 
</P>
<P>
There's the cypomegalovirus, for one, usually treated by medication injected 
directly into the veins. But that interferes with the AZT, which he has been 
taking for 2 1/2 years, so that means he takes still more pills. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had friends who have had it," he says of this latest virus. "Most of them 
are dead." 
</P>
<P>
Vince pauses after that, then a humorless laugh slips through his lips. "Not a 
very comforting thought," he says. 
</P>
<P>
One of Vince's goals these days is to avoid discomforting thoughts. He doesn't 
always succeed. 
</P>
<P>
His intellect tells him he is deluding himself, that he will soon die. Then his 
emotions allow him to hope. He believes in the power of positive thinking. 
Maybe, he says, his mother is right. That miracle drug will save him yet. 
</P>
<P>
Then he will have a bad day, or week, or month. 
</P>
<P>
"There are times, if I've been feeling bad, if I can't leave the house, when I 
don't know if I want to put out the effort," he says. "I feel like maybe I 
should just throw in the towel." 
</P>
<P>
Others have suggested as much to Vince Chalk. Just before school started last 
month, he told his doctor that he wanted to feel well enough to return to work. 
The doctor suggested that he take a disability leave and spend his time at 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
"What he was saying was: 'You're dying. Why don't you use your last few days 
doing something else?' " Vince says. "That kind of attitude I don't need from a 
doctor." 
</P>
<P>
Vince has since changed physicians. Now he talks about developing his immune 
system, getting more exercise. He calls other AIDS patients to offer them some 
hope. It is in such short supply. 
</P>
<P>
Just thinking about Vince Chalk makes me very emotional. I wish I could will 
him to health. When I hear about the discrimination that he still suffers, 
court victory or no, I nearly shake with anger. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers tell queer jokes, high school boys call him a fag. 
</P>
<P>
"They do this because they don't know me," Vince says. "They don't give 
themselves a chance to find out who I am." 
</P>
<P>
AIDS, he tells me, is not like cancer. Nobody implies that cancer patients 
deserve to die. 
</P>
<P>
When I left Vince Chalk, he gave me a firm handshake and a smile. He said he 
wouldn't have done anything differently, even though fighting for his rights, 
and those that go after him, has certainly taken its toll. 
</P>
<P>
I have my own selfish reasons to be glad for that. If Vince Chalk were not a 
fighter, I would have never met him.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TRABUCO CANYON; 
</P>
<P>
PLANNERS TURN DOWN ROSE CANYON ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN R. CHURM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The county Planning Commission on Tuesday upheld an earlier recommendation 
against building a two-lane road in Trabuco Canyon that critics have warned 
would open hundreds of acres of rugged backcountry to intense development and 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The commission voted 3 to 2 to recommend that Rose Canyon Road -- a 
three-mile-long proposed road through Trabuco Canyon on the edge of the 
Cleveland National Forest -- be eliminated from a land-use plan now under 
consideration for a 6,300-acre swath of canyon country. The commission also 
voted to support "spot improvements" along two-lane Live Oak Canyon Road, which 
links El Toro Road with Trabuco Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Improvements would include widening each lane from 10 to 12 feet and adding a 
four-foot-wide shoulder to each side of the road. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners Stephen A. Nordeck, Thomas Moody and Roger Slates voted to 
recommend deleting Rose Canyon Road from the Foothill-Trabuco Specific Plan, a 
sweeping proposal to establish building limits for an area best known for its 
stands of ancient oak trees and scenic ridgelines. 
</P>
<P>
Commission Chairman Earl Wooden and Commissioner C. Douglas Leavenworth opposed 
Tuesday's action. 
</P>
<P>
A month ago, a commission majority not only opposed Rose Canyon Road but 
recommended that it be eliminated from the county's master plan of highways. 
</P>
<P>
The county Board of Supervisors will make a final decision sometime early next 
year on the road, as well as the growth blueprint for the sparsely populated 
region. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's debate focused on whether existing roads in the area, primarily Live 
Oak Canyon and Trabuco Canyon roads, can safely handle the increase in traffic 
generated from new development that is expected once the Foothill-Trabuco plan 
is adopted. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still not convinced that we can live without Rose Canyon Road," 
Leavenworth said. "I don't think we've been offered a viable alternative to 
allow a reasonable amount of development." 
</P>
<P>
But Nordeck, whose district includes Trabuco Canyon, said that Rose Canyon Road 
would largely serve commuters from Rancho Santa Margarita, not the needs of 
local residents. Nordeck, who supports a network of local roads, was sharply 
critical of the way county planners and traffic engineers gathered their data 
to support inclusion of Rose Canyon Road in the area's specific plan. 
</P>
<P>
The commission delayed any decision on placing a cap on the number of new homes 
that can be built in Trabuco Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Without Rose Canyon Road, county planners say, only 400 to 550 new homes can be 
built. Less than 300 now exist in the area. STEVEN R. CHURM

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; 
</P>
<P>
COUNCIL GIVES 1ST OK ON ELECTIONS CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNON SANDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a 3-2 vote, the City Council took the first step toward moving its next 
election from November, 1990, to next April. 
</P>
<P>
The council is scheduled to give final approval to the change at its Nov. 6 
meeting, and the Board of Supervisors probably will consider the issue in late 
November. 
</P>
<P>
If the supervisors approve the change, Tustin would be the first city in the 
county to move its election from November to April rather than vice versa. Most 
cities have consolidated local elections with general elections to save money 
and increase voter turnout. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Tustin held city elections in April was in 1986 when 20% of the 
registered voters went to the polls. When the elections were moved to November, 
74% of the registered voters cast ballots in that general election. 
</P>
<P>
The registrar of voters office estimates that holding a special city election 
will cost the city an additional $13,000 to $16,000, but Councilman Richard B. 
Edgar, who proposed the change, said he believes that the extra money will be 
worth it. 
</P>
<P>
He said separate city elections attract voters who are more concerned and 
informed about local issues. Out of 15,900 Tustin voters who went to the polls 
in November, 1988, about 4,000 did not vote for council members, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's let the people who care about city government elect the council," Edgar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Edgar also argued that it costs more to campaign for local campaigns in 
November than in April. Council candidates must spend more in November because 
city issues get lost in the shuffle of national and state campaigns and higher 
costs make it prohibitive for average citizens to run for office, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Kasalek, chairman of Citizens for a Responsible Tustin Council, also 
supported the change. "I personally believe in quality, not quantity voters," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilmen John Kelly and Earl J. Prescott, who cast the two dissenting 
votes Monday night, said it is elitist to say voters in April elections are 
more informed than those in November elections. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an insult to the majority of voters in Tustin to change because you'll 
get a more informed voter," Kelly said. "It should be our focus to encourage 
the people of Tustin, all the people of Tustin to vote." SHANNON SANDS

TAX RATE INCREASE TO FINANCE SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. JEANETTE AVENT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A tax to help pay for new schools in the Aliso Viejo community and a portion of 
Mission Viejo will be included in property tax bills for the area starting next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The tax rate, set by the trustees of the Capistrano Unified School District 
this week, will range from $241 for a single-family, detached home less than 
1,700 square feet, to $483 for a home between 2,400 and 3,499 square feet. 
Apartment owners will pay $145 per unit, and owners of commercial and 
industrial property will pay $1,725 per net acre. 
</P>
<P>
The tax rate will be re-evaluated by school trustees on July 1 of each year and 
may be raised a maximum of 2% per year. The special tax district was 
established two years ago in an agreement between the school district and the 
Mission Viejo Co., said Dave Doomey, a school district administrator. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement allows the district to sell $120 million in school bonds to help 
pay for a high school, an intermediate school and four elementary schools in 
Aliso Viejo. A fifth elementary site will be purchased in Mission Viejo near 
Felipe Road and Barbadanes. 
</P>
<P>
The first bond will be sold for $45 million and paid off by residents over 25 
years. Additional 25-year bonds will be sold as the additional schools are 
needed, Doomey said. 
</P>
<P>
During the first tax year, 3,349 residential units and 165 parcels of 
commercial acreage will be assessed the school tax, according to Doomey. G.

BASKETS DISTRIBUTED FOR RECYCLING EFFORT

<P>
In preparation for a citywide recycling program to begin at the end of the 
month, city officials are distributing more than 7,300 multicolored recycling 
containers to residents. 
</P>
<P>
The baskets, which come in three colors and are similar to milk crates, are 
being passed out to homeowners at the rate of 500 to 900 a day, city spokesman 
Mark Klosterman said. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 30, homeowners participating in the volunteer program will sort 
recyclables in their homes and leave the baskets curbside for pickup. Aluminum 
and plastic containers will be sorted into light blue baskets, glass will be 
sorted into dark blue baskets and newspapers will be sorted into white baskets, 
Klosterman said. 
</P>
<P>
"The city of Laguna Beach is very conservation oriented and we hope to be one 
of the top in the country," Klosterman said. "We're shooting for a minimum of 
70% participation." 
</P>
<P>
City staff members have been promoting the new program through mailers, and 
have made presentations to schools, community service groups and homeowners 
associations, Klosterman said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, advertisements will be run for the rest of the month in local 
newspapers and promotional materials, such as bumper stickers, will be 
distributed. LESLIE HERZOG

MUSTANG CLUB JURY SEES RE-ENACTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE GEWERTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a chilling re-enactment of a mob-style crime, the financial backer of the 
notorious Mustang Club bar clambered into a tiny Honda Tuesday and froze in the 
exact position he was in two years ago when three bullets were pumped into his 
head and he was left for dead. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Angelo Grosso is on trial for the attack. He and Michael Rizzitello, 
allegedly a highly placed member of the Los Angeles Mafia, both are accused in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
With jurors watching in a secured area of the courthouse parking garage in 
Santa Ana, C. William Carroll, 57, blinded in the shooting, climbed into the 
passenger seat of the 1981 two-door Honda Civic. One investigator from the 
district attorney's office got into the back seat of the car, assuming the 
position prosecutors say Rizzitello was in just after midnight on May 1, 1987. 
He is accused of wrapping his arm around Carroll's neck and firing three shots 
into the victim's skull. Another took the driver's seat, which prosecutors say 
was occupied on that night by Carroll's driver, Grosso. 
</P>
<P>
The eerie scene was staged for jurors who will be asked to decide whether 
Grosso, 46, accused of pinning Carroll in place during the shooting, is guilty 
of attempted murder and conspiracy. Prosecutors contend that Rizzitello, 62, 
wanted control of the Mustang Club, a now-defunct topless tavern, and 
eliminated Carroll because he stood in Rizzitello's way. Rizzitello, a 
convicted racketeer who met Carroll when they were both in state prison at 
Chino in 1970, faces a separate trial next month. 
</P>
<P>
Security had already been stepped up for Grosso's trial, but on Tuesday, 
secrecy also was imposed. Lawyers and courtroom bailiffs said they were under 
orders from Superior Court Judge John L. Flynn Jr. not to discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
After The Times reported Tuesday that the re-enactment was scheduled to take 
place on the loading dock of the courthouse, the event was abruptly moved to a 
secured area of the parking garage and reporters were barred. But details were 
obtained from attorneys who described the re-enactment in open court. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll described the last moments before the shooting in a Costa Mesa parking 
garage, where he testified that he went with Rizzitello and Grosso after dinner 
at an Italian restaurant in Santa Ana. They had asked for a ride to their car, 
and Carroll let Grosso drive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"As I turned my head to the left, with Mr. Grosso in the driver's seat, to say, 
'Where's your car?' Mr. Rizzitello's arm come around my neck," Carroll 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
During hours of cross-examination, Grosso's attorney, WilliamYacobozzi, 
hammered away at Carroll, seeking testimony that would cast doubt on Grosso's 
role in the shooting. Carroll acknowledged that the last moment he saw Grosso's 
face, Grosso was staring straight ahead, and he admitted that he did not see 
Grosso put his hands on Carroll's left leg. But he testified that Grosso had 
held him down. 
</P>
<P>
Yacobozzi contends that Carroll is pointing the finger at Grosso to get back at 
him for providing incriminating information to the FBI on his other criminal 
activities.CATHERINE GEWERTZ

Beneath the Disneyland Monorail they stood Tuesday, listening respectfully to 
the same Apache blessing that their warrior ancestors, Geronimo and Cochise, 
had heard before going into battle against the U.S. cavalry a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
Facing heavenward with closed eyes, medicine man Reppert Cassadore -- 
great-great grandson of "the Apache Kid," a 19th-Century warrior -- beseeched 
the good will of Indian spirits for the 60 Apaches who gathered around him. 
</P>
<P>
When the prayer was over, the Indians, many of them elderly people off their 
San Carlos Reservation in Arizona for the first time, blinked in wonder at the 
strange new sights. They were with 78 other Apaches from the White Mountain 
Reservation in Arizona for a long-anticipated day at Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
"To them, it's a thing they will always remember -- that they can tell their 
grandchildren that Disneyland is real," said Reno Johnson, chairman of the 
White Mountain Apache Nation. 
</P>
<P>
The Apaches arrived in Anaheim on Monday night, journeying 13 hours in a bus 
across the Southwestern deserts that their forefathers used to travel bareback. 
The itinerary for their four-day stay in Orange County also included a 
first-ever visit to the beach and a day at Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
Although there were many children on the two reservations who wanted to go 
along, Elizabeth Classay, a San Carlos reservation Apache who organized the 
trip, said this was intended only for the elderly Indians because most had 
never ventured beyond the reservations. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought I would be here," 95-year-old Mae Dewey marveled as Mickey 
Mouse sidled up and planted a kiss on her weathered cheek. 
</P>
<P>
Classay added: "They are getting too old. This is the first -- and maybe their 
last -- trip (to the outside world)." 
</P>
<P>
The two reservations, which sprawl over more than 2 million acres of alpine 
forests and high desert plateau, were established by the U.S. government during 
the Apache Wars of the 1870s and 1880s. Many of the older residents said they 
are descendants of Geronimo, whose band of warriors staged raids on 
stagecoaches and wagon trains out of the San Carlos Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
The Apache Wars ended Sept. 4, 1886, when Geronimo surrendered himself and 16 
warriors to Brig. Gen. Nelson A. Miles in Skeleton Canyon, near the Mexican 
border. Geronimo and 394 of his tribesmen were subsequently sent into exile in 
Florida and, for more than 20 years, were kept in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
The modern-day Apaches make a living off the land, raising cattle and hunting 
the deer, elk and bear that inhabit the higher mountain ranges of the 
reservations, Cassadore said. But he added that the reservations, like many 
others in the United States, are also plagued by high unemployment and 
alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, the visiting Apaches left all of those worries at home. Each had paid 
$290 to go on this week's trip. The money was raised by the San Carlos and 
White Mountain Apache tribes selling native-made cradle boards, jewelry and 
burden baskets, Classay said. 
</P>
<P>
The Apaches stepped off two charter buses from their nearby high-rise hotel and 
into a land of fantasy. Disneyland characters, including Mickey Mouse, Minnie 
Mouse and Winnie the Pooh, greeted them. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing colorful native dress that drew stares from camera-toting tourists, 
they were then loaded aboard a convoy of antique model trucks so they could 
participate in the Main Street Parade. 
</P>
<P>
After enduring a seemingly endless photo session in front of the Sleeping 
Beauty Castle, they got around to the really important business: going on the 
rides. 
</P>
<P>
Ranging in age from early 50s to 95, the Indians mostly steered clear of 
high-adventure rides such as Splash Mountain. However, 74-year-old Alice Wesley 
didn't realize until after she had already been fastened in that the Matterhorn 
Bobsled ride was not exactly suited for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"Ohhh, it almost gave me a heart attack," she wailed afterward. 
</P>
<P>
The attraction called It's A Small World was a little less intimidating. Old, 
lined faces lit up as the ride carried them past colorful, dancing Disney 
puppets all singing "It's a Small World." 
</P>
<P>
"Ohhhh. Look!" Arlene Holmes, a recreation director for the San Carlos 
Reservation, said with laughter as a puppet Indian chief in full headdress came 
into view. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the older Indians could not speak much English. But their enthusiasm 
was marked by their repeated use of the word kayah, which Classay said is 
Apache for golly. 
</P>
<P>
Mae Dewey, who is the oldest person on either reservation, felt quite 
comfortable easing out of her wheelchair and getting on an artificial steed on 
the Disneyland merry-go-round. 
</P>
<P>
"It brings back the memories of when I was a little girl and I used to gather 
acorns in the mountains," Dewey said later. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing Dewey and her companions in their red, pink, blue and yellow native 
dress, a vacationing couple from England introduced themselves and then 
attempted to present their little daughter. Dewey, eyes twinkling in delight, 
reached out to shake the shy girl's hand -- and then suddenly pulled her close. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't be afraid," Dewey said with a laugh as the girl stared in fright. "I'm 
tame now."

<P>
In their first major face-off Tuesday, proponents and critics of a Nov. 7 
Orange County ballot measure to raise money for traffic improvements blamed 
each other for failing to adequately respond to the county's current 
transportation crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"If Measure M fails, Orange County is in deep trouble," Board of Supervisors 
Chairman Thomas F. Riley warned about the proposal to increase the sales tax 
from 6 to 6 1/2 cents to raise $3.1 billion for transportation projects over 
the next 20 years. "The life style in Orange County is second to none. To 
(maintain) that, Measure M must pass." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hoax on the public," countered Lester P. Berriman of Drivers for 
Highway Safety, a group contending that Measure M allocates too much money for 
new car-pool lanes on freeways instead of regular, mixed-flow lanes. "It (also) 
gives us transit (buses, trains) . . . Its cost-benefit is just non-existent." 
</P>
<P>
The rare debate, which included several speakers both for and against Measure 
M, was part of a public television program videotaped at KOCE-TV, Channel 50, 
in Huntington Beach Tuesday. The program is scheduled for broadcast at 8 p.m. 
Nov. 1 and again at 9 p.m. Nov. 6. The program, "Taxes Vs. Gridlock? Orange 
County Transportation Plan," is underwritten by The Times Orange County 
Edition. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, proponents of Measure M, who have raised more than $800,000 to date, 
have tried to deny their under-funded critics a free platform by showing up 
only for forums to which the opposition has not been invited. Measure M critics 
took advantage of their turn at bat Tuesday, quickly alleging that the projects 
to be funded with proceeds from the sales tax increase will not solve the 
county's traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Costa Mesa City Councilwoman Sandra L. Genis, who works as a city 
planner for Newport Beach, said that even if Measure M passes, key interchanges 
such as the intersection of the San Diego and Santa Ana freeways in Irvine (the 
"El Toro Y") will be jammed even after millions of dollars are spent to improve 
them. 
</P>
<P>
And slow-growth advocate Russ Burkett of San Juan Capistrano, who helped defeat 
a 1-cent sales tax hike for traffic projects in 1984, said Measure M should 
have focused on one major project, such as the planned widening of the Santa 
Ana Freeway, and should have been written as a five-year plan instead of a 
20-year program. 
</P>
<P>
But Riley, former Supervisor Bruce Nestande and slow-growth advocate Tom Rogers 
pointed out that the sales tax proposal was written to meet the political 
requirements of the day, with city councils, developers and environmentalists 
finally agreeing on a document that each could live with. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be disastrous to have a single (freeway project)," said Nestande, a 
member of the state Transportation Commission and chairman of Citizens for Yes 
on Measure M. Without improvements on congested streets, he said, there would 
be no way to get drivers to the improved freeway project. 
</P>
<P>
Nestande argued that Measure M provides money to improve major roads feeding 
into county freeways, and additional transit, so that commuters can more easily 
reach freeways that also would be widened. 
</P>
<P>
Nestande further argued that without a half-cent sales tax for transportation 
projects, Orange County would have to forgo millions of dollars in state and 
federal matching funds that will be awarded to counties with such sales taxes, 
such as San Diego and Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers, who has split with slow-growth advocates Burkett and Genis over Measure 
M, pointed out that the Orange County ballot measure requires cities to adopt 
growth-management plans and establishes a residents' oversight committee to 
monitor compliance. The proposed state gasoline tax hike that will be on the 
June, 1990, statewide ballot does not, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers said these were key reasons for his support of Measure M. In contrast, 
Rogers opposed a 1984 1-cent sales tax increase for transportation, which was 
overwhelmingly defeated by 70% to 30%. 
</P>
<P>
Measure M supporters, however, agreed that the sales tax increase for 
transportation expressly prohibits the oversight committee from deciding the 
adequacy of growth-management plans, and calls instead for citizens' lawsuits. 
They said that was necessary to ensure that the growth-management regulations 
are enforced by elected, rather than appointed, officials. 
</P>
<P>
But, Genis replied: "The (sales tax) plan is growth-inducing," benefitting some 
developers, such as the Irvine Co., because it includes a Riverside-to-Irvine 
rail link that will promote an increase in jobs in the Irvine Spectrum business 
complex and the surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
People in Riverside would prefer to work in Riverside, not in Irvine, Genis 
argued. 
</P>
<P>
Measure M's proponents countered that until more jobs are available in 
Riverside, commuters from the Inland Empire will continue to clog freeways 
leading into Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"You can tear apart any plan," said Nestande, who is vice president of Costa 
Mesa-based Arnel Development Co. 
</P>
<P>
"But to not go out and offer the citizens a balanced transportation network in 
the long-term future in my mind would be irresponsible . . . There is not a 
single issue that is more important."

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
TRAGEDY SHOWS GAP IN GUN LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a quiet residential street in Westminster last Thursday, 21-year-old Thomas 
White gave the state Legislature a tragic example of why the lawmakers should 
have extended the two-week waiting period on handguns to all firearms when they 
had the chance last month. 
</P>
<P>
Despondent, White killed his former girlfriend and then himself with a shotgun 
he had purchased only hours before. 
</P>
<P>
At about the time in September that the legislators were considering extending 
the waiting period to enable the Department of Justice to determine whether a 
prospective purchaser was eligible for gun ownership, White was checking 
himself into a Long Beach psychiatric hospital. He had been despondent for some 
time over the breaking off of a romance by Krisden Yoshiko Tanabe, 18, a 
popular high school basketball star from Huntington Beach, who was then in her 
freshman year at Golden West College. 
</P>
<P>
According to reports, White, back in the community only two days after his 
release from the mental hospital, approached Tanabe in front of a friend's 
home. He was carrying the shotgun. Tanabe turned to run. White gunned her down. 
Then he turned the shotgun on himself. They both died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives and friends are left wondering why it all happened. And others are 
left rightfullypondering why it is that just about anyone can walk into a gun 
shop and walk out with a rifle or shotgun. And they also wonder how many more 
must die before the law is changed. 
</P>
<P>
The state Senate last month rejected a bill by Assemblyman Lloyd G. Connelly 
(D-Sacramento) that would have extended to rifles and shotguns the present 
15-day waiting period between the purchase and delivery of a handgun. The 
legislators were more concerned about the wishes of the National Rifle Assn. 
than the safety of their constituents. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster Mayor Charles V. Smith is not happy about the ability of people to 
buy long guns at will. "As far as I'm concerned, this thing would not have 
happened if we had a law requiring a cooling-off period for a few days . . . 
and that wouldn't hurt the sportsman at all," Smith said. Lisa Barros, Tanabe's 
aunt, was more upset. "He (White) just got out of a mental hospital and he was 
able to walk in and buy a firearm. That, to me, seems criminal," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Surveys have shown that most people agree with Smith and Barros and support a 
waiting period for all gun purchases. Most people, that is, except the members 
of the California Senate, who still shamefully put accommodating the NRA ahead 
of public safety in their political priorities.

GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI: FLAWED SECONDARY LEAVES RAMS LESS THAN PERFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Like giddy school children, they embraced, celebrating the most unlikely of Ram 
comebacks, basking in its total improbability. 
</P>
<P>
It was a sight to see: Ram executive vice president John Shaw -- a man not 
given to these sorts of public outbursts -- and team counsel Jay Zygmunt 
dancing an impromptu victory jig in the glass-encased visiting owners' box at 
Rich Stadium in Orchard Park, N.Y., in the wee hours of Tuesday. They laughed. 
They hugged. They let the joy of a 6-0 record wash over them. 
</P>
<P>
Flipper Anderson had just plucked a wobbly Jim Everett pass out of the foggy 
air, slipped through two would-be Buffalo Bill tacklers and then raced 78 yards 
for a miracle touchdown and a seemingly insurmountable 20-16 lead with only 
1:22 remaining in the game. Everett raised his arms in triumph. Ram teammates 
began their 82-second countdown. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-two seconds. Is that all it took for Buffalo quarterback Frank Reich, 
who had never started a National Football League game, to dissect the Ram 
nickel defense like a science-class frog? Can it be that simple to complete 
seven consecutive passes (nine, if you count two in a row from the previous 
Buffalo scoring drive) and travel 64 yards against the league's only undefeated 
team? 
</P>
<P>
Ask Shaw and Zygmunt, who must have felt a little silly as they watched Reich 
zip a pass to an open Andre Reed in the end zone as the clock clicked down to 
16 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Ask cornerback LeRoy Irvin, who was reduced to offering gracious postgame 
compliments of Reich, the same quarterback who had completed five of 15 
first-half passes for a scant 33 yards and an interception. 
</P>
<P>
And ask the Bills, who probably still can't believe their good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
This was a Ram loss that could have been, should have been, a Ram victory. 
Somehow, though, it slipped away and the Rams now find themselves, much like 
everyone else, less than perfect. It is a sobering thought, what with the 
apparently rejuvenated New Orleans Saints on their way, followed by Ram trips 
to Chicago and Minnesota and then an Anaheim appointment with the New York 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, you wonder, as must Coach John Robinson, how it all happened. How 
do you explain a defeat against a team that was missing one of its Pro Bowl 
linebackers (Shane Conlan), its Pro Bowl quarterback (Jim Kelly) and one of its 
starting cornerbacks (Derrick Burroughs)? And since when do championship teams, 
such as the Rams aspire to be, blow leads in what amounted to 66 seconds? 
</P>
<P>
It was simple, actually. 
</P>
<P>
First, you ask Ram running back Greg Bell about his return to Buffalo, the 
organization that happily included him in the Eric Dickerson deal two years 
ago. Bell, as is his custom, offered his frank and unedited version of the 
Bills. Kudos, they weren't. 
</P>
<P>
The quotes, as they always do, somehow found their way to the Bills' locker 
room. In the cloistered world that is pro football, mild words became insults, 
insults became motivational tools. Thus, when the Bills' defense arrived at 
Rich Stadium Monday evening, they did so with Bell in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Result: 44 yards in 21 carries (zero yards in the second half). And no matter 
how hard Bell tried to downplay his pregame remarks, they had an effect. He 
might not have incited a riot, but he helped give the Bills a common purpose, 
which was to shut Bell up and shut him out. They managed to do both. 
</P>
<P>
"He helped a little bit," nose tackle Fred Smerlas said, trying to suppress a 
grin. "We realized we weren't playing together." 
</P>
<P>
Next, the Rams squandered at least three opportunities to take advantage of 
wonderful field position, a valuable commodity in a game controlled partly by 
the whims of the weather. The Rams began drives on the Buffalo 46- and 33-yard 
lines, as well as their own 48 . . . and came away with nothing. In addition, 
Ram defensive backs let several likely interceptions slip through their hands. 
</P>
<P>
This was the kind of game Robinson feared the most: His famed Ram running 
attack was rendered ineffective, as evidenced by the time of possession (13 of 
their 16 offensive series lasted less than three minutes); the Ram passing 
attack was hindered by a cold October rain, and the Ram pass defense, ranked 
28th in the league, proved perhaps that statistics don't lie. 
</P>
<P>
Ram followers will point to a pair of questionable non-pass interference calls 
in the Bills' end zone late in the third quarter. Replays seemed to show that 
receiver Henry Ellard had been tugged and turned by defenders on two successive 
pass attempts by Everett. A penalty would have placed the ball on the one-yard 
line and almost ensured a Ram touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
And how fortunate, they might add, that two of Scott Norwood's three field 
goals barely squeezed inside the uprights or edged over the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
None of this matters now, except that maybe a lesson has been learned by the 
Rams. It is: Victory dances mean nothing without a win as a partner.

Choc Full Of Zure broke a four-race winless streak Tuesday night by winning a 
$7,000 allowance race at Los Alamitos Race Course. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-year-old gelding defeated six other horses in the 870-yard race in 46.48 
seconds for its second victory in eight starts this season. Because of fog 
covering much of the track, the horses could not be seen by many spectators 
until they reached the top of the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Choc Full Of Zure was coupled with Rebs Limit, who was second, and paid $4.80, 
$4.20 and $2.80. Especially Brewed was third and paid $7.80. Choc Full Of Zure 
is trained by H.J. Visscher and was ridden by leading jockey Kip Didericksen.

PROFIT DECLINES IN SECURITIES BRING PREDICTIONS OF LAYOFFS

Wall Street is heading into the last quarter of the year suffering continuing 
declines in some of its most profitable business lines such as advising on 
mergers, according to statistics compiled by IDD Information Services, a New 
York research firm. Analysts predict a new round of layoffs for the securities 
industry if business does not improve. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that in the first nine months of this year, as compared to 
the first nine months of 1988, the dollar volume of fee income has declined," 
said Perrin Long, an analyst for Lipper Analytical Securities Corp. "The 
profits from these investment-banking businesses had been a major factor in 
covering up the sins and the lack of profits in other areas," such as bond and 
stock trading and sales. 
</P>
<P>
Long added that if the decline in business continues through the end of the 
year, Wall Street firms probably will launch another round of layoffs after 
Christmas. Long estimated that as of June, about 292,000 people worked for New 
York Stock Exchange member firms throughout the world. He predicted that as 
many as 5,000 of these could be cut if business does not improve. 
</P>
<P>
Brokerage executives were reluctant to talk about their individual firms' 
performance until after they release third-quarter earnings information later 
this month. Some officials said privately, however, that a sudden, general 
slowdown in business in September, following a better-than-usual summer, 
clouded their earlier hopes for healthy third-quarter figures. 
</P>
<P>
"On Sept. 4, the phones just went silent," said one retail brokerage executive. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the summer spurt, retail brokerage has been slow since the stock market 
crash in October, 1987. Many firms had recorded earnings increases on the 
strength of the merger boom. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street firms disclosed that they had earned more than $1 billion in fees 
from advising on merger deals in 1988, according to IDD. The actual earnings 
most likely were higher, after figuring in fees from private deals. 
</P>
<P>
Although comparable fee figures for 1989 are not yet available, the number of 
new merger deals completed in the first three quarters of this year dropped 12% 
from last year's pace, IDD figures show. "The domestic merger business is not 
as intense as it once was," said Joseph Perella, chairman of Wasserstein, 
Perella &amp; Co., the top merger advisory firm, according to IDD's ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Other high-margin investment-banking services also have tapered off -- and the 
profit margins have shrunk. Common stock issues, for example, fell 
precipitously from 1988's already low levels, according to IDD. At this point 
in 1988, U.S. companies sold $23.8 billion in stock to the public, with Wall 
Street pocketing an average fee of $4.9 million a deal. IDD's comparable 
figures so far this year are $15.1 billion of new offerings and $2.9 million in 
average fees.

FRENCH WATCHDOG UNIT POLICES STOCK MARKET

<P>
Stung by insider traders and others slipping through its grasp, France will 
bring in a tough new law this month that gives its stock watchdog agency 
sweeping new powers to police the markets. 
</P>
<P>
The Commission des Operations de Bourse will be able to raid offices, freeze 
assets, question suspects and impose fines -- on paper making it one of the 
most powerful securities regulators in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Some legal experts fear excessive power will be concentrated in the COB's hands 
because it will be able to rule on cases investigated by its own inspectors. 
The COB replies that critics cannot judge until they see how the law will work. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole problem is going to be to define, in fact, what actions and behavior 
will be punished by the COB," said the watchdog agency's chief inspector, 
Jean-Pierre Michau. 
</P>
<P>
The government decided to tighten lax laws after a series of recent scandals 
highlighted France's poor record on convicting offenders in financial cases, 
notably insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
"The COB has existed for 22 years and passed to prosecutors less than 30 
insider cases," said Pierre Bezard, the public prosecutor who investigates such 
cases for the courts. "For anyone who knows French financial markets, that's a 
low figure." 
</P>
<P>
He attributed this failure to a traditionally lenient French attitude toward 
financial scandal, poor COB funding and courts being reluctant to press charges 
in minor cases when major offenders were avoiding detection by trading abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"Courts couldn't make the Swiss banks talk," Bezard noted. But international 
cooperation among regulators is increasing as world opinion swings against 
market corruption. 
</P>
<P>
The new French legislation takes effect when an enlarged nine-man COB ruling 
"college" is set up, which Michau expects by the end of September. 
</P>
<P>
With a legal framework designed to make it independent of government, the group 
can impose fines of up to 10 million francs ($1.5 million) or 10 times the 
profit made on an illegal deal on French stock, bond or futures markets. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very powerful organization," said a legal official, who declined to be 
identified. "It's up to the courts to be extremely attentive about how these 
(COB) rules will be applied." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like a policeman imposing an on-the-spot parking fine," added 
Jean-Francois Prat, a top corporate lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't like administrative authorities having direct powers of sanction -- 
even if you can immediately appeal -- especially on a law that requires as much 
interpretation as market regulations." 
</P>
<P>
No members of the new ruling college have yet been named, but Finance Minister 
Pierre Beregovoy said current COB head Jean Farge would step down. 
</P>
<P>
Financial sources said Jean Saint-Geours, a former government adviser and 
banker, looked best placed to take over. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers said an early test of how the college sees the COB's new role will be 
the question of rules on insider trading, the illegal practice of profiting 
from privileged information. 
</P>
<P>
After a six-month inquiry into the latest market scandal during last year's 
raid on privatized bank Societe Generale, the COB declared in July that the 
insider trading law is too vague. 
</P>
<P>
"The present drafting doesn't, in our view, allow us to draw with certainty a 
precise line between the legal and illegal," it concluded in a report. 
</P>
<P>
Even for Farge, that line is extremely fine. 
</P>
<P>
"By definition, financial markets are markets of insider traders," he said, 
noting the constant flow of price-sensitive data in the stock exchange. 
"Insider trading isn't a question of essence but of degree." 
</P>
<P>
French insider trading rules were first written in 1967, but unsuccessful court 
cases exposed holes in the definitions. The new law, revising the rules for the 
seventh time, covers professionals who give price-sensitive data to third 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
Some lawyers are angered about the prospect of yet another bid to rewrite the 
rules. "You can't change the law each time there is a political scandal in 
France," lawyer Jean-Michel Darrois said.

Because of a disagreement with directors over the planned growth of US 
Facilities Corp., Robert J. Percival has stepped down as vice chairman and 
chief operating officer of the Costa Mesa insurance holding company. 
</P>
<P>
Percival will remain on the board as a director and, under his employment 
contract, will act as a consultant for the next two years, said Rosemary 
Mulligan, a company spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
George Kadonada, US Facilities chairman and president, will assume Percival's 
duties while the company looks for a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan said the board was dissatisfied with the company's lackluster 
performance and wants to improve the firm's growth. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the company bought 112,000 shares -- about 3% -- of its common stock 
from a shareholder and retired the shares. Mulligan said the price paid for the 
shares earlier this month was attractive to the company, but she refused to 
reveal any other details. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the stock purchase was unrelated to recent turmoil in the 
stock market. 
</P>
<P>
The company operates USF RE Insurance Co., a property and casualty reinsurance 
company, and US Benefits Inc., an underwriting manager for excess group medical 
stop-loss coverage.

SHAREHOLDERS SUE IRVINE'S MEDSTONE INC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Medstone Inc., an Irvine manufacturer of machines that destroy kidney stones, 
has been hit by a shareholder lawsuit alleging the company concealed adverse 
information about its prospects. 
</P>
<P>
Also named as defendants in a federal class-action suit alleging violation of 
securities laws are Freeman Rose, the company chairman, chief executive officer 
and acting president; Richard Penfil, former president and director; Errol 
Payne, former chairman and chief executive officer and now a director, and 
David Radlinski, the executive vice president and chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit contends that the company and its officers "concealed adverse facts 
concerning the company's operations and prospects so that they could inflate 
the price of the company's common stock" to their own advantage. Among other 
things, the suit alleges that some company officers sold shares of their 
personal Medstone stock holdings at inflated prices. 
</P>
<P>
Medstone's stock sold for $13 a share when the company went public in June, 
1988. The stock soared to a high of $42 a share in August of that year and then 
dropped back to about the $13 range. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts blame the roller-coaster ride on lower than expected sales 
due to difficulties in obtaining approval from the Food and Drug Administration 
to market the Medstone technology for treatment of gallstones. The technology 
is approved only for the non-surgical treatment of kidney stones. 
</P>
<P>
Medstone attorney R.C. Shepard said the company believes the lawsuit is 
"without merit."

INVESTOR SUES IRVINE-BASED NEC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A New York investor has filed a class-action lawsuit against National Education 
Corp. of Irvine and its top executives, charging them with promulgating false 
and misleading information about the NEC's financial condition between July 20 
and Oct. 6, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
NEC, a one-time high-flier in the vocational training and education business, 
has been reeling since last spring from problems at its Applied Learning 
subsidiary. On Oct. 5, the company announced that it expected a $6-million loss 
for the third quarter and that was having trouble with financing. The company's 
stock lost more than 30% of its value the next day. 
</P>
<P>
The suit charges that NEC concealed the problems at Applied Learning and made 
false, optimistic statements about the company's financial condition in order 
to inflate the stock price. NEC was the target of a similar shareholder lawsuit 
filed in June after the company said it would have flat or declining earnings 
for the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
An NEC attorney said the company would vigorously defend itself against the 
allegations.

AIRPORT HEARINGS POSTPONED AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing a mass of new information from the airline industry that must be 
studied, John Wayne Airport officials have again postponed public hearings on 
the proposed airline flight allocation plan. 
</P>
<P>
The initial hearing before the County Airport Commission, previously scheduled 
for tonight, now is set for Nov. 5, said Jan Mittermeier, assistant airport 
manager. She said county supervisors probably won't hold their public hearing 
and final vote on the plan until mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the airport access plan -- which includes jet flight allocations at 
the tightly regulated airport -- was to have been approved in April. 
</P>
<P>
An unexpectedly slow review of the plan by the Federal Aviation Administration 
and opposition by two of the nation's major cargo carriers, Federal Express and 
United Parcel Service, upset that timetable, however. County airport officials 
met with the FAA on Monday and Tuesday to discuss the cargo carriers' concerns.

MORRIS THE CAT'S SECOND OF NINE PAMPERED LIVES;

<P>
The indifferent attitude of the big red cat called Morris is a tender trap of 
interest for most. 
</P>
<P>
He professes to be a finicky eater. But the girth of this 9-lives spokescat 
does not indicate that he had turned down much din-din or super-supper. He is, 
however, a beautiful 14-pound example of a well-cared-for and healthy cat. 
</P>
<P>
His veterinarian, Dr. Laura Pasten, and handler Bob Martwick, who are traveling 
around the United States with Morris to promote National Cat Health Month, 
can't help but chuckle when they look at the huge red tabby who accepts their 
attention with a stifled yawn. 
</P>
<P>
Without any trepidations that he might not like the environment outside of his 
large crate, Martwick takes Morris out and sits him on top. There he sits 
unflinching, eyeing a horde of writers who crowd around to admire him, say 
hello over and over and all but look foolish trying to impress this absolutely 
haughty and royally indifferent star. 
</P>
<P>
Martwick, who found Morris in a shelter in New England, is an animal talent 
scout and handler who has selected the two Morris cats who have represented 
9-lives. Both have lived with him as house pets in his home just outside of 
Chicago. The first Morris became popular in 1969 and he died at age 19 in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Martwick says it took one year to find the present Morris, who began his career 
in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The talent scout won't divulge completely his secret of how to choose a laid 
back and totally flexible cat who can ignore the most unusual situations, but 
he does. And a comfortably adjusted cat won't stay that way unless he is loved, 
fed and handled properly. Martwick modestly denies his talent-scouting and 
cat-care ability, saying that "Morris is relaxed because I feed him constant 
praise and balanced cat food." 
</P>
<P>
Pasten says that there "are an estimated 57.5 million pet cats and 49.9 million 
pet dogs in the United States today and in the four consecutive years that 
9-Lives cat food and the American Veterinary Medical Assn. have sponsored the 
Cat Health campaign to alert cat owners to the importance of medical care and 
nutrition, a study commissioned by Charles, Charles &amp; Associates revealed 
that the number of people who take their cats to veterinarians has increased by 
16%." 
</P>
<P>
She advises that cats, more than dogs, will tend to hide their illnesses. 
Purring and appearing healthy, a cat could be suffering from a serious disease 
such as leukemia, a virus that attacks the immune system which is preventable 
by proper vaccinations," she says. Pasten cites the three most important 
vaccines as leukemia, rabies and distemper. 
</P>
<P>
Nutrition is equally important. A cat must have a balanced diet, she says, 
warning that feeding a cat dog food is absolutely wrong. "A cat needs four 
times more protein than dogs do and they would be deprived on dog food. A cat 
particularly needs a meat-derived amino acid called taurine. It is necessary 
for feline vision and without it, a progressive retinal degeneration of the 
eyes will occur," she says. 
</P>
<P>
A wise cat owner is one who feeds the balanced foods of major cat food 
manufacturers who research nutrition for cats. 
</P>
<P>
Prepared cat food that is balanced is more important today than in the past. A 
cat cannot today safely roam free to obtain necessary nutrients of greens and 
meats from the wild. And most owners find it too difficult to prepare balanced 
foods at home. This makes the commercial foods the answer. Pasten, of course, 
recommends 9-Lives. 
</P>
<P>
A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Stanford University, Pasten received her degree in 
veterinary medicine from UC Davis and was the first woman to be selected to 
internship in the feline health program at Cornell University. She owns and 
operates her own veterinary hospital in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Pasten has written a booklet entitled "Rx: The Morris Prescription," free upon 
request from: 9-Lives Booklet, P.O. Box 599012, Chicago, Ill. 60659. 
</P>
<P>
Pasten, Martwick and Morris travel for two campaigns each year, the other being 
the annual Adopt-a-Cat month of June sponsored by 9-Lives and the American 
Humane Assn. "with studies revealing that approximately 70,000 kittens are 
adopted from shelters each year because of this program," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Martwick won't tell anyone which shelter Morris was adopted from because of an 
experience with the first Morris. "After he became famous and I had made no 
secret of the shelter he came from, I received an incredible number of calls 
and even registered letters from people telling me that this cat I had rescued 
belonged to them. Most often the letters would note something like, 'I had a 
cat named Lucky and he is now Morris,' " he said.

MUSIC AND DANCE: IT'S HOMECOMING TIME FOR 2 RISING STARS; 
</P>
<P>
BALLET: SAN FRANCISCO BALLET'S APPEARANCE IN COSTA MESA THIS WEEK SERVES TO 
BRING TWO ORANGE COUNTY DANCERS BACK TO THEIR ROOTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Among the dancers appearing with San Francisco Ballet this week at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center are two who are making homecomings. 
</P>
<P>
SFB principal dancer Evelyn Cisneros grew up in Huntington Beach and guest 
danseur Gregory Osborne moved to Corona del Mar when he was a sophomore in high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Though both are considered young, rising stars in their profession, neither 
began studying ballet out of their own desire. 
</P>
<P>
Cisneros was pushed into ballet lessons by her mother because she "was very 
shy." 
</P>
<P>
"My mother felt that ballet would bring me out of that shyness, and it really 
helped," she said in a phone interview from San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Osborne, speaking from Copenhagen where he was guesting with the Royal Danish 
Ballet, said other people "made the decisions" when he was a kid. It wasn't 
until an injury forced him to stop dancing while he was in high school that he 
"learned that ballet was what I wanted to do, not what everyone else wanted me 
to do, which was important." 
</P>
<P>
Cisneros, who is dancing the principal role in all performances this week of 
Balanchine's "Theme and Variations," will be partnered by Osborne in that work 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Hedging on revealing her age ("I can't tell you that"), Cisneros said she was 
born in Long Beach "sometime between 1958 and 1962." The family moved to 
Huntington Beach when she was 3, and she began studying ballet at 8. But it 
wasn't until junior high school that she decided to forgo softball, volleyball 
and track teams in order "to spend that time on my ballet," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her life then became one of dedication and sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
"I would start school at 7:30 in the morning, have six (classes), no lunch," 
she said. "From there, I'd go to the studio and teach two or three classes . . 
. then take my class, which went to 6:30, have dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we'd drive to Los Angeles and rehearse there for about two hours, (until) 
10 or 11 p.m. Then we'd drive home. I'd do my homework in the car. 
</P>
<P>
"I did that five days a week, and on the weekend there were also four or five 
hours of rehearsal. It was hard. Most of my friendships went by the wayside. 
All my spare time was put into my art. Looking back on it, I don't know how I 
managed." 
</P>
<P>
One big factor was the support from her family. 
</P>
<P>
"My father worked two jobs," Cisneros said. "My mother would work at the ballet 
school, at the desk, to raise money to provide shoes and leotards. I would help 
teach at the school. I would student-teach three classes (to pay) for one of my 
own. It was a sacrifice all the way around. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, I have an extended, very close family, who helped diversify my 
life. We're very Mexican and traditional. We would always know how important it 
was for everyone to eat as a family unit. We would wait until after class to 
eat together." 
</P>
<P>
The payoffs began in 1973 when she was awarded a scholarship for summer study 
at the San Francisco Ballet. A year later, she received another scholarship 
from SFB and one from the School of American Ballet, the school affiliated with 
the New York City Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
She decided to try New York because "we all felt that it would be a different 
learning experience for me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It was different. It was a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I was held back," she said. "They put me in a low-level (section). I 
was not allowed to do the things I could do well. I was supposed to concentrate 
on things I was not very good at. That might have been good for me, but I felt 
very discouraged." 
</P>
<P>
So she called San Francisco Ballet ("for me not to be totally discouraged and 
give up"), which accepted her for the remainder of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"(That) was wonderful. It gave me back my self-confidence. After that summer, 
they asked me to stay as an apprentice." 
</P>
<P>
When she joined the company in 1977, she remembers encountering some prejudice 
at SFB because of her Mexican heritage. 
</P>
<P>
"A certain ballet master here wasn't very gracious that I was darker than other 
people and looked different," she said. "Having grown up in Huntington Beach, 
which at that time was almost purely white, I had feelings of that already when 
I was a young girl. I already had to deal with that on a small level." 
</P>
<P>
But then-co-artistic director Michael Smuin "would take that ethnic background 
and be inspired by it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Smuin first put her into "A Song for Dead Warriors" (a ballet he created in 
1977 about an American Indian), and later created dramatic roles for her in 
ballets such as "The Tempest," "Brahms-Haydn Variations" and "Hearts." 
</P>
<P>
"I like story ballets because they give you opportunity to express your inner 
feelings, to develop a characterization and carry it through its full spectrum 
of development," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Now living in Diamond Heights in San Francisco with Robert Sund, her husband of 
three years, Cisneros maintains ties to her ethnic roots. Frequently, she 
speaks to Mexican and Hispanic youth conferences and community groups. 
</P>
<P>
"I just feel that the Hispanic community doesn't have a lot of role models," 
she said. "I can approach them and say, 'Look, I was born up in a small town, 
grew up in a middle-class family, they weren't wealthy. But if you have the 
talent and desire, you can make anything happen.' " 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Osborne will be featured in the Saturday evening performance of 
Tomasson's new "Handel -- A Celebration." 
</P>
<P>
A guest with San Francisco Ballet, Osborne, like Cisneros, didn't start 
studying ballet on his own. "Basically, everyone around me sort of made a 
decision for me," Osborne said. 
</P>
<P>
"There were seemingly more possibilities for a boy in classical ballet because 
not many boys at that time were interested in it. " 
</P>
<P>
Born in Louisville, Ky., Osborne moved to Orange County with his family in 1968 
and began studying with Lila Zali, founder of Ballet Pacifica, when he was a 
sophomore at Corona del Mar High School. 
</P>
<P>
"She was the best in the area and also had a little company," he said. "The 
amazing thing is that Lila had a very small studio and yet . . . she taught me 
to use space and how to move in a large way." 
</P>
<P>
Osborne, who also declined to give his age, attended Texas Christian University 
("mainly because my parents wanted me to have a degree"), rushing through to 
complete his B.A. degree in fine arts in three years. He was anxious to take on 
the great dance world in New York, where he arrived at age 19. 
</P>
<P>
But when he auditioned for American Ballet Theatre, he was steered into the 
second, junior company. "I thought I had failed, I was second-rate, I had 
failed my goal," he said. "I was quite depressed. I didn't realize that . . . 
no contracts were available. I was very green. Actually, I was moving very 
quickly and didn't know it." 
</P>
<P>
Within a matter of months in 1975, however, he and Victor Barbee, a roommate at 
North Carolina School of the Arts, were asked to joined ABT. But as he started 
working his way up the ranks, he found the company's emphasis shifting after 
Mikhail Baryshnikov entered as artistic director in 1980. (He resigned this 
summer.) 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, Misha was more interested in contemporary, modern repertoire than 
in classical," Osborne said. "Right at the time he came in, I was starting to 
be geared for roles as a prince. I would have done an Albrecht (in "Giselle") 
or Siegfried (in "Swan Lake") down the line. But classical repertoire was 
diminished and the principal dancers started hoarding their rep. Young dancers 
didn't have the opportunity to do those roles." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Osborne was getting opportunities, but only "when someone would get 
injured and I would take over the part. . . . At the last minute, I would go 
on, more or less unprepared." 
</P>
<P>
That state of things began to drive him crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed more information and more time for those roles," he said. "They were 
too important to me to just throw them on stage. . . . I had a good (audience) 
following, a good critical following, and I could blow it all in one work." 
</P>
<P>
So he took a guest stint with the London Festival Ballet, which gave him his 
first opportunity to dance Siegfried in "Swan Lake" in 1982. Strengthened by 
this exposure in the classical repertory, he returned to ABT, only to feel that 
his progress was thwarted. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that, at ABT, I was twiddling my thumbs. I didn't have the roles to 
challenge me," he said. " 'This is ridiculous,' I thought. 'I don't have this 
time to waste.' " 
</P>
<P>
After Erik Bruhn cast Osborne as Gurn and then James in a new production of 
Bournonville's "La Sylphide" for ABT in 1983, he followed Bruhn when he became 
artistic director of the National Ballet of Canada later that year. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided to work with him for a year or two, then go back to ABT," Osborne 
said. "But I never went back. Things were going too well working with Erik. The 
world was opening up to me. It didn't seem right to go back and I didn't see 
the rep I wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
When Bruhn died in 1986, Osborne felt "I lost one of my greatest mentors and 
probably one of my greatest friends . . . it was like falling down a well -- 
because I fell very long, until finally I felt that I touched base, very solid. 
It was my own foundation which I had built, unbeknownst to me. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"He guided me, he made me do my homework, so to speak. He also gave me the 
(princely) roles and performances. He said if I didn't start doing those roles 
soon, it would be too late, I would have missed the opportunities. He gave me 
every opportunity. Fortunately, it seems to have paid off." 
</P>
<P>
Osborne was a member of the National Ballet of Canada for five years. He was 
seen locally as Lensky in John Cranko's "Onegin" and in Balanchine's "The Four 
Temperaments" when National Ballet of Canada appeared at the Performing Arts 
Center in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Then, like many native Canadians, Osborne eventually decided that it was time 
to test himself in a larger arena. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I'm doing what I'm doing today -- guesting -- having flown the nest 
from Canada," he said. "It's all very fine and well to be (appreciated) in 
Toronto. . . . But I also wanted to test what I had learned with other 
audiences, people that knew me from before, people who had a longer history 
with the ballets, i.e., Europe and London. 
</P>
<P>
"It was time to throw myself to the wolves, to see if I could hold my own amid 
those dancers who had done all those ballets and my peers. So that's why I'm 
guesting. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, when you throw yourself into the abyss, you jump off the cliff and 
hope you're going to fly. But every time I do that, I find out how far I've 
come and how much further I need to go. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot further to go. I don't think it ever ends. As soon as you stop 
learning, that's when you die as an artist or a dancer. . . . The more you 
learn, all it teaches you is how (far) you've come and how much you don't 
know." 
</P>
<P>

TOO RELAXED 'TOWN' HAS ITS MOMENTS

The Brea Theatre League's "Wonderful Town" is often too leisurely for its own 
good, belying the near-feverish, cosmopolitan energy of New York City that the 
1953 musical is meant to evoke. But it does have enough of a screwball sway and 
a punchy performance by Carole Ball in the key role of Ruth to be diverting. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the popular 1940 stage laugher, "My Sister Eileen," the Leonard 
Bernstein/Adolph Green/Betty Comden show doesn't try for much more than setting 
up the gag that two sisters can get into lots of trouble and meet lots of 
peculiar people in the big city. The songs are wrapped around this premise not 
like a fur coat, but like a good wool jacket -- functional but not exceptional. 
</P>
<P>
The kicks come not so much from the score but from watching Ruth and Eileen 
(Christine Martin) move from one scrape to another, whining about going back 
home to Ohio but (of course) being thrilled by the jaw-dropping charm of 
Manhattan, especially Christopher Street, where artists, beatniks and other 
eccentrics gather like strange fauna. 
</P>
<P>
Director Kent Johnson goes at all this with a relaxed gait, never quite pumping 
up the action to reflect the chaos the girls encounter. Roberta Kay's 
choreography is reasonably imaginative and generally well-performed, but it too 
has a processional pace to it. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Johnson does manage to locate the daffiness of "Wonderful Town" even 
though it's a blurred sort of daffiness. His best moments come when Ruth, a 
writer with a Hemingway bent, is asked to act out some of her stories and when 
Ruth, again, gets entangled in a Conga line with a gang of amorous Portuguese 
sailors. Did I mention that this is a very silly musical? 
</P>
<P>
Ball gets much of the credit for making these scenes work. Her voice doesn't 
soar, but she does understand what acting in a musical is all about. It's a 
fully inflated but entertaining turn. 
</P>
<P>
As the prettier, more naive Eileen, Martin has a difficult time keeping up with 
Ball, but she doesn't really have to. Everyone here is suppose to support Ruth, 
and Martin keeps up her end, especially by bringing the best voice to the 
production. 
</P>
<P>
There are dozens of wacky characters scattered through "Wonderful Town," the 
most interesting being the dim ex-jock Wreck (Gary Gibson), magazine editor Bob 
Baker (Steve Williams), newspaper hack Chick (McCullon Smith), painter 
Appoplous (Fred Valencia) and ever-ready hooker Violet (Laura Sellers). 
</P>
<P>

BOHANON LEADS GROUP AT WEBSTER'S

George Bohanon, a spirited and inventive trombonist, is leading the regular 
Thursday night group at Webster's, a restaurant at Grand Avenue and 9th Street 
that is becoming known as a new gathering place for jazz aficionados. The room 
offers jazz from 6 to 9 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays as well as Sunday sessions 
from 5 to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Bohanon was supported last week by Bennie Maupin, a powerful tenor saxophonist 
known for his work with McCoy Tyner and Herbie Hancock. Together they formed an 
impelling front line on such familiar standards as "Walkin'," "Blue Bossa" and 
that seemingly ubiquitous jam session standard, "Softly As in a Morning 
Sunrise." 
</P>
<P>
Impressive though the two were with their hard-bop excursions, and despite 
admirable support by Richard Reid on bass and Harold Mason on drums, the 
scene-stealer was Eric Reed, an amazing pianist who recently graduated from Cal 
State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen-year-old Reed not only has formidable techniques but also the 
knowledge and bop-rooted sensitivity to back it up. At times he almost 
suggested a reincarnation of Bud Powell, the seminal bopper who died four years 
before Reed was born. At other points his two-fisted chordal approach indicated 
a personality that transcends imitation. 
</P>
<P>
Reed will be back at Webster's Sunday leading his own quartet, under the aegis 
of the International Assn. of Jazz Appreciation. His is a name that is bound to 
reach prominence very early in the 1990s. LEONARD FEATHER

FEW IN CLASSES ON 2ND DAY OF SCHOOL STRIKE;

<P>
BEVERLY HILLS: MANY STUDENTS RALLY IN SUPPORT OF TEACHERS IN THEIR WALKOUT OVER 
PAY AND BENEFITS.

Both sides in the Beverly Hills teachers strike said late Tuesday night that 
they will resume talks today, although the district and the union disagreed on 
whether the new round of negotiations might produce a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Gordon, chief negotiator for the teachers, said that if the district is 
willing to alter its latest offer, the labor dispute might be settled as early 
as today. 
</P>
<P>
"When this is settled it's going to be at the bargaining table, not the picket 
line," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
But Dana Tomarken, president of the Beverly Hills Board of Education, was less 
sanguine, saying that the district's most recent offer to teachers was still 
"the last, best and final" one. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased that there is some talking going on but I don't know what will 
come out of it," Tomarken said. 
</P>
<P>
Contract negotiations, which had been taking place for several months, broke 
off last Thursday and nearly all the district's 300 teachers, nurses and 
counselors walked out Monday morning. Talks are set to resume at 10 a.m. at 
district headquarters, with a state mediator in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
The district's latest offer is for a teacher pay raise of 11% over two years. 
The teachers' union, Beverly Hills Education Assn., is demanding 18% over two 
years, or 10.5% for the current school year. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, attendance plummeted at Beverly Hills schools as the first-ever 
strike in the district weathered its second day. 
</P>
<P>
Students gathered for a brief morning rally outside Beverly Hills High School, 
shouting "Scabs go home!" and "We want our teachers!" One student held up a 
sign that said "Students Can't Achieve With Bums." 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills police officers were evident at the rally but there were no 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Robert French, superintendent of the Beverly Hills Unified School District, 
estimated that 125 students walked out of class, but students and others 
observers said the number was closer to 200. Only a small number of students 
appeared to return to classes. 
</P>
<P>
French said attendance districtwide had dropped from 80% Monday to 53% Tuesday. 
Only 42% of Beverly Hills High's normal enrollment of about 2,000 students came 
to class Tuesday -- the lowest attendance rate of the city's five schools -- 
while 62% of elementary students showed up. 
</P>
<P>
The district has a total of 4,700 students. 
</P>
<P>
At a morning press conference at district headquarters, French said that all 
classrooms were being staffed by credentialed instructors. 
</P>
<P>
Reports from the high school suggested otherwise, however. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Pakizegi, 15, said he waited for about 40 minutes outside his classroom 
Tuesday morning, but no instructor appeared. "That's why I'm out here today," 
he said, surrounded by a group of friends on the sidewalk outside the school. 
</P>
<P>
Rady Rahban, 16, said his substitute teacher brought a VCR and television to 
class and showed a program called "Basketball Bloopers." 
</P>
<P>
Doron Barness, 15, who joined teachers on the picket line Tuesday, said many of 
his classmates decided to go to Disneyland. "I wanted to go, but I decided to 
support my teachers instead." 
</P>
<P>
Doron said he conducted a quick survey of about 15 classrooms and saw an 
average of seven students in each room. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the first bell rang at the high school, about a dozen teachers 
were huddled around a walkie-talkie, held by another striking instructor, that 
was tuned to the channel used by the school's administrators and security 
officers. Voices overheard on the walkie-talkie asked what to do about "kids 
just milling about on campus" or "occupying themselves on the stairway." At 
other times, school personnel were heard reporting the rooms that needed to be 
unlocked. 
</P>
<P>
When a male voice was heard saying, "We need a teacher (in) room 524," the 
strikers cheered. 
</P>
<P>
Of about 200 substitutes hired, about 10 chose not to return Tuesday, and five 
or six had been deemed unqualified and were not rehired, French said. 
</P>
<P>
Several Beverly Hills High students said their substitutes told them they work 
in the Los Angeles Unified School District, where teachers waged a nine-day 
strike in May for higher pay and more authority. 
</P>
<P>
One Beverly Hills High substitute, who would not give her name, said she 
teaches English at an adult school in the Los Angeles district, but is not a 
member of the local union. She said she decided to sign up for substitute duty 
in Beverly Hills purely for financial reasons. A single mother with two 
children, she said, "I need a way to cover the rent." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of United Teachers-Los Angeles have said that no union members are 
among the substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills is offering substitutes $185 a day -- compared to the $137 a day 
Los Angeles offered in the May walkout. 
</P>
<P>
The teacher also said that school officials asked her to teach a German class 
even though she is not qualified in the subject. 
</P>
<P>
"The substitutes just don't cut it," said Jenny Brandt, an eighth-grader at 
Beverly Vista Elementary School. She said her substitute teacher gave the class 
an assignment to write a 250-word essay on "Would we rather be a tree or a 
wave?" 
</P>
<P>
Another student, seventh-grader Andrew Kline, said his substitute asked 
students to write about "what our favorite movies were." 
</P>
<P>
One Beverly Vista parent, however, said he was satisfied that the school was 
trying hard to maintain normal routines. "From what I've heard, they (students) 
are doing a lot of work," said Tom Guterres. "Not like at Beverly Hills High." 
</P>
<P>
At El Rodeo Elementary School, three fifth-graders had set up a lemonade stand 
across from the campus to supply striking teachers with refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not learning anything," said Jessica Lee, 10, explaining why she was not 
in school. 
</P>
<P>
Many parents came to pick up their children early Tuesday because they felt 
they were receiving little more than baby-sitting. One mother, who said she 
came to campus to observe the conditions, said many children are confused and 
troubled by the strike. "They want to come to learn," she said, "but they don't 
want to cross their teacher by crossing the (picket) line." 
</P>
<P>
Panos Nicolaou, a film and television producer who has two children in Beverly 
Hills schools, said he canceled a meeting at Warner Bros. studios in order to 
walk the picket line with the high school teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very concerned with what's going on," Nicolaou said. "It's not just a 
question of teachers wanting more money. It's a question of priorities. 
Education should be No. 1."

HAMMER ART MUSEUM FACES SHARP PENCIL; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGETS: COST OVERRUNS MAY FORCE OCCIDENTAL TO SCALE BACK OR DEFER THREE MAJOR 
COMPONENTS OF THE CULTURAL CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center under construction in 
Westwood has encountered significant cost overruns and may be forced to scale 
back or defer completion of three of its major components, according to sources 
close to the project. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is being financed by Occidental Petroleum Corp. Meetings have been 
under way at Occidental this week to determine what sources called the museum's 
"guaranteed maximum cost" -- a term commonly used to indicate the price at 
which a contractor guarantees to finish a building. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said the projected total had ballooned to as much as $80 million 
before Occidental officials ordered a comprehensive review. They said the 
internal inquiry was focusing on elimination of lavish features in the design 
-- particularly millions of dollars worth of electronic gear and expensive 
finish materials in the auditorium -- that could potentially reduce the total 
cost to about $58 million. The museum was originally estimated to cost about 
$50 million. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is being built to house the art collection amassed by Occidental 
Chairman Armand Hammer, who turns 92 next May. Hammer's collection was bought 
partly with Occidental funds. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, crews of dozens of construction workers have been working 
overtime to complete the museum's seismically reinforced outer shell and steel 
skeleton. 
</P>
<P>
"The museum construction is proceeding on schedule," said Occidental spokesman 
Frank Ashley. "It is expected to open about this time next year. Beyond that, I 
wouldn't elaborate." 
</P>
<P>
Other Occidental or construction officials contacted by The Times would not 
discuss the project, and the office of Alla Hall, the museum's director, 
referred calls to Ashley. Hammer did not return calls seeking his comment. 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the project and a lawyer representing Occidental said the 
museum may be forced to leave vacant the space reserved for a restaurant, 
auditorium and library. It also might have to cut back drastically on other 
museum features. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all money-related stuff," said one source closely familiar with the 
project. He said the issue is one "of too much building and too few dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Kauffman, a Philadelphia attorney who represents Occidental in a pending 
shareholder suit challenging the oil company's commitment to the museum 
project, said he was aware of deliberations over the last several weeks that 
focused on construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
Kauffman said he knew of at least one discussion, to which he was not a party, 
in which scaling back or eliminating the auditorium and restaurant had been 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental is required under terms of a pending court order to limit cost 
overruns to $10 million. Previously sealed court documents, made public as a 
result of a court petition by The Times and the Wall Street Journal, also 
indicate that Hammer ordered in a memo that the museum construction be held 
within the original $50-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
A series of factors -- ranging from the discovery of an underground stream 
during excavation to cost underestimates of expensive marble veneers -- have 
apparently driven up the price beyond even the highest initial estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the problems were alluded to by Hammer in a deposition taken earlier 
this year in one of the pending shareholder lawsuits. Hammer said the 
subterranean stream and the discovery of a foundation of a former building on 
the site added $3 million to the museum price tag alone. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is being constructed behind the existing Occidental Petroleum 
headquarters building on a site bounded by Wilshire Boulevard, Glendon Avenue, 
Westwood Boulevard and Lindbrook Drive. Original estimates were that a parking 
garage below the museum would cost $23 million and the museum space itself, 
another $27 million. The garage is the structural support for the museum, which 
is to be connected to the first four floors of the oil company building. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to committing as much as $60 million in museum construction costs, 
Occidental has agreed to purchase a $36-million annuity to subsidize the museum 
in its first five years of operation. 
</P>
<P>
Kauffman had estimated that Occidental's total potential financial exposure 
could be as high as $160 million. But in a telephone interview earlier this 
week, Kauffman said the $160 million figure "has absolutely no meaning" and was 
derived from estimates at the start of the museum project when "all kinds of 
figures were being thrown around." 
</P>
<P>
Hammer announced plans to build the museum in late 1987 after he abruptly 
withdrew from a previous commitment to donate his art collection to the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art. The agreement was canceled after the museum 
balked at a series of demands by Hammer, including that names of other donors 
who gave money for galleries where his paintings would be displayed be stripped 
from the spaces and that life-sized portraits of Hammer and his wife be 
permanently displayed with his art collection. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer also demanded that the county museum hire a curator for his collection 
who would not be answerable to the county museum director, and that the museum 
pledge never to exhibit works along with Hammer's collection other than those 
he donated. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in an another development, Occidental has failed to meet an Oct. 6 
deadline to respond to a set of written questions in a pending shareholder 
lawsuit demanding to know the source of funds used to purchase virtually every 
work in Hammer's art collection, the value of which has been estimated at as 
much as $450 million. 
</P>
<P>
The filing of the questions in early September followed the disclosure by 
Hammer earlier this year that Occidental was the source of funds used to 
purchase a collection of Leonardo da Vinci drawings subsequently renamed the 
"Codex Hammer." 
</P>
<P>
Kauffman said Occidental refused to answer the questions because they were 
filed late and because Occidental has moved to dismiss the shareholder suit. 
Attorneys for New York investor Alan Kahn, the plaintiff in the lawsuit, said 
they would seek a court order compelling Occidental to reply. 
</P>
<P>
The $5.8-million purchase of the "Codex Hammer" in 1980 was announced at the 
time as an undertaking of the Armand Hammer Foundation. Court documents made 
public several weeks ago revealed, however, that Occidental Petroleum provided 
the money in the form of a gift to the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure prompted more court action last month. The California Public 
Employees Retirement System, the state's largest pension plan and owner of 2.4 
million shares of Occidental stock, filed court papers demanding that any part 
of Hammer's art collection purchased with Occidental funds be returned to the 
oil company and that the museum building itself be sold.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WATER DISTRICT VOTES TO BAN LANDFILL 
EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing an eventual danger to San Gabriel Valley underground water supplies, the 
Metropolitan Water District voted unanimously on Tuesday to join in a legal 
action to stop the expansion of a landfill in Azusa. 
</P>
<P>
Browning-Ferris Industries, a Houston-based company chaired by former U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency head William D. Ruchleshaus, wants to expand 
the landfill to accommodate 36 million more tons of trash. The company promised 
to insert high-density plastic liners to separate the landfill from the water 
table and, to sweeten the deal, to set up a $20-million fund to clean up 
already polluted water in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is suggesting that the impact (on ground water) will be immediate," 
said Metropolitan Water District spokesman Jay Malinowski. "But from our point 
of view, there's no reason to believe that liner won't leak eventually." 
</P>
<P>
The water district will join the Main San Gabriel Valley Water Basin, which 
oversees water rights in the region, in seeking to overturn a decision by the 
State Water Resources Control Board allowing Browning-Ferris to proceed with 
its plan. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Houston company said that officials would continue to seek 
an amicable settlement that would permit expansion of the landfill.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: INTERNATIONAL KIDNAPING TRIAL OF COVINA MAN 
OPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A well-to-do Covina chiropractor was described by a prosecutor at his 
international kidnaping trial as a man with a violent temper who threatened to 
kill a former girlfriend and her daughter to recover more than $100,000 in 
money and property he said he was owed. 
</P>
<P>
Rolando Peralta, 51, is on trial in Los Angeles federal court, accused of 
masterminding the kidnaping for ransom last June of a dental student in Mexico 
City in order to force her mother, Indiana Robleto, to pay Peralta the money he 
said he was owed. 
</P>
<P>
Peralta, his secretary, Socorro Contreras, and her boyfriend, Rigoberto 
Herrera, are charged with international hostage taking, conspiracy and 
extortion in the abduction of Maria Robleto, 22, who was released after a 
$40,000 ransom was paid. Robleto, a Maywood dentist, paid the ransom but it was 
unclear where the funds came from. 
</P>
<P>
Although the abduction occurred in Mexico, the case is being tried in federal 
court here because U.S. laws take precedence and because Peralta was arrested 
here. 
</P>
<P>
In opening statements to the jury, Assistant U.S. Atty. Carol Gillam said 
Peralta was a "vile-tempered" man who threatened to kill Indiana Robleto in 
telephone conversations with her that were secretly recorded by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorney Anthony Brooklier told jurors that Peralta was "set up" by 
Robleto because she hated him because of their failed love affair. He also 
argued that the abduction never took place, contending that Maria Robleto 
cooperated with her alleged kidnapers.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FATHER, SON TO BE TRIED IN RECORD COCAINE 
BUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A father and son team who allegedly oversaw the Mexican leg of a major 
Colombian smuggling ring were ordered Tuesday to stand trial in Los Angeles in 
connection with a record cocaine seizure at a Sylmar warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
After a preliminary hearing, federal Magistrate Lawrence Leavitt found probable 
cause to order Carlos Tapia Ponce, 68, and his son, Hector Tapia Anchondo, 38, 
held for trial in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The two Mexican nationals were arrested Sept. 29 at the Flamingo Hilton Hotel 
in Las Vegas, one day after Drug Enforcement Administration agents raided the 
Sylmar warehouse and seized 21.4 tons of cocaine, the largest such seizure in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Four men are being held in Los Angeles in the case. 
</P>
<P>
No date was set Tuesday for Tapia Ponce and Tapia Anchondo to appear on the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
The government's sole witness at the preliminary hearing was DEA agent William 
Sherman, who testified that Tapia Ponce and Tapia Anchondo were identified as 
two key players in the massive drug smuggling operation. 
</P>
<P>
The identification was made by another man who was arrested in the case, James 
McTague, 41, who is married to Tapia Anchondo's sister. McTague, who was 
arrested along with three others on Sept. 28, has been identified as the 
manager of the Sylmar warehouse, where authorities found the cache of cocaine 
and $12.2 million in cash.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OUSTED HOSPITAL CHIEF PRAISED BY SUPERVISORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William Delgardo, ousted last month as chief of the Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew 
Medical Center, was praised by members of the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors Tuesday for his years of service at the embattled hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Delgardo, who has been reassigned to a county health department administrative 
job, praised the staff at King and thanked community members and Supervisor 
Kenneth Hahn, who arranged the ceremony, for their support. He was lauded in a 
commemorative resolution presented by Hahn and supervisors Ed Edelman and Deane 
Dana. 
</P>
<P>
Delgardo later defended the 430-bed hospital that he called "my home," and said 
state inspectors and reports unfairly singled out King over problems attributed 
to a shortage of staff and funding -- both things he said were beyond his 
control. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the controversy that cost him his post, Delgardo said he hoped 
that King would finally receive the resources he said he had been seeking in 
vain. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel I need vindication," he said, adding that he would be willing to 
return to the hospital. "Certainly. That's my home. I was there 14 years, but 
(returning) is not to be." 
</P>
<P>
Delgardo and two top assistants were replaced Sept. 26. The moves came shortly 
after the federal government threatened to cut off $60 million in Medicare and 
Medi-Cal funds to the hospital if problems there were not corrected by Dec. 21.

MCMARTIN DEFENSE URGES JURY TO END YEARS OF 'VILE ALLEGATIONS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
McMartin defense attorney Dean Gits asked jurors Tuesday for a quick verdict to 
end "six years of people making vile allegations" against his client, Peggy 
McMartin Buckey, and urged them to apply common sense and the concept of 
reasonable doubt to acquit her. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey, 62, is charged with 12 counts of molestation involving four children 
who attended her family-owned Manhattan Beach nursery school, and a single 
count of conspiracy shared with her son, Ray Buckey, who is charged with 
molesting 11 youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
In a daylong rebuttal of the prosecution's final arguments, Gits blamed "the 
insanity" that became the McMartin Pre-School molestation case on inept 
investigators, unscientific physicians, gullible parents, suggestible children 
and a firestorm of rumor that swept through the seaside community in late 1983 
and early 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the things that got in the way of the truth," he said, adding: "I'm 
not sure you'll ever know (what happened). That's the horror of this situation. 
</P>
<P>
"Children can be led to believe they were molested," he said, then asked: "Then 
why can't we be led to believe they were molested?" 
</P>
<P>
Alluding to his opening statement more than two years ago in which he promised 
to reveal "the enemy," Gits said, "So now you know the enemy. It's us -- our 
inability to accept that our environment can control major aspects of our 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Pacing back and forth in front of the jury, sometimes lowering his voice to a 
whisper, and coughing and popping throat lozenges as the day wore on, Gits said 
many of the allegations "defy logic," while others have innocent explanations. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he cited one child who accused both Buckeys of molesting him at a 
time when Ray Buckey was not present at the school, and who testified that he 
played naked games in a non-existent "secret room," watched a horse being 
hacked with a machete and drank rabbit blood during a satanic ritual at a local 
church. 
</P>
<P>
"This child really believes that this happened. The games were all played in a 
secret room. But there is no possible doubt that that secret room never 
existed. It defies logic. But he believes that it exists. Somebody taught him 
about it or he created it in his head. . . . He never even knew there was a Ray 
Buckey," Gits said, because, according to payroll records, his attendance 
preceded the male teacher's arrival on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can't believe him, why can you believe anybody else (making 
allegations)? If he is wrong, this case should be over," Gits added. 
</P>
<P>
He juxtaposed photographs of the nine children who testified against one or 
both of the Buckeys with those of 38 teachers and others who were present at 
the school and testified that they saw nothing suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
He did not answer several questions raised by the prosecution -- such as what 
is contained on a missing half-page carefully snipped from family matriarch 
Virginia McMartin's 1983 diary. The missing portion was for Aug. 11, the last 
day of school attendance by the child whose allegations triggered the massive 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
But he posed some questions himself that he said the prosecution had failed to 
answer, such as how could a conspiracy of silence be maintained for so long? 
Would every child react to molestation in the same way? Why did no one else see 
the alleged molestations? Where are the pornographic photographs that were 
supposedly taken? And where are the dead animals the children talked about? 
</P>
<P>
And, perhaps most important, if the more bizarre allegations cannot be 
believed, why should any of the accusations stand? 
</P>
<P>
Gits said the prosecution's case is too full of holes and inconsistencies to 
persuade the jury "beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty." He said 
it has not proved that some of the alleged acts took place within the six-year 
statute of limitations. And he suggested that "a two-second touch on the penis 
or a pat on the outside of the vagina are things that do not seem to have any 
sexual purpose," as the charges require. 
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, as Gits sat drained with his hands folded at the counsel table, 
Peggy McMartin Buckey left the courtroom, effusive in her praise for her 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was great," she said of his argument. "I couldn't have asked for 
anything more. He told the truth." 
</P>
<P>
She said she and her husband, Charles, who was present in the courtroom, 
planned to celebrate their 36th wedding anniversary Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Her son's lawyer, Danny Davis, now has 5 1/2 days for his rebuttal arguments, 
after which the prosecution will have 3 1/2 days for the last word before the 
case goes to the jury. 
</P>
<P>
Although Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders has curtailed the 
final days of the trial -- the longest and costliest criminal proceeding in 
world history -- he predicted Tuesday that the jury's deliberation process 
"could well take several months" given the amount of testimony and exhibits it 
may have to review. 
</P>
<P>
Pounders warned that the coming weeks are "a very dangerous time" since the 
jury will not be sequestered but needs to be protected from outside pressures.

QUAYLE CALLS ON A SOUL MATE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: VICE PRESIDENT QUAYLE STOPS IN L.A. ON A SWING TO RAISE CASH AND 
INTEREST IN GOP CANDIDATES, DROPPING IN ON A POLITICAL BROTHER, FORMER 
PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Vice presidents are supposed to make money, not news. Thus did Dan Quayle 
perform Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
He dallied in Los Angeles midway through a West Coast fund-raising swing, just 
after San Francisco, just before San Diego. He offered his now-routine 
cautionary criticisms of the Soviet Union. He praised the efforts of 
democracy-hungry East Europeans. He backed up his boss, President Bush, on the 
politically itchy subject of abortion. 
</P>
<P>
And, in a visit meant to set astir the hearts of conservatives, he sidled up to 
President Reagan's Century City office, where the once and future hopes of the 
Republican right chatted about communists and -- almost more threatening, by 
American standards now -- those drastically successful Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Theirs was small talk writ large. Consider the exchange about the view from the 
demilitarized border between North and South Korea, which Quayle visited last 
month and Reagan observed in trips during his presidency. There, the seemingly 
prosperous village of Paek Chon Ni stands. It is generally deserted and, 
intelligence officials say, is simply the North Korean version of a movie set. 
</P>
<P>
"You walk out there and see the propaganda village," Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
"And they're all just fronts!" burst in the former President, his shoulders 
shaking in glee. 
</P>
<P>
So successful was Quayle in his continuing effort to quell controversy that 
when a reporter interrupted the picture-taking to ask a question, the question 
-- about the capital gains tax -- went to Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
But if Quayle had little of great importance to divulge Tuesday, his trip did 
manage to succeed in its primary objective -- to raise cash and interest in 
Republican candidates, and to do a few favors that he might one day be able to 
call in. 
</P>
<P>
The vice president and his entourage left Washington early Monday, raised money 
for Oregon Republicans there, then traveled to San Francisco where he raised 
more money and rallied businessmen to support Sen. Pete Wilson, who is now 
running for governor. After speaking to the Town Hall of California at the 
Century Plaza Hotel here, he visited Reagan and then flew to San Diego for 
another speech. Private fund-raising meetings were held along the way. 
</P>
<P>
After addressing a Big Brothers gathering in San Diego, Quayle cut his visit 
there short and headed back to the Bay Area to inspect the quake damage. Aides 
said that there was no way to calculate how much Quayle raised on this trip, 
one of several he has made to Los Angeles since his inauguration nine months 
ago. But figures gathered before this swing showed that Quayle has thus far 
raised almost $9 million, three times the amount raised by Bush during his 
first year as vice president, an aide said. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan stop reunited two men who are more ideological soul mates with each 
other than either is with Bush, and Quayle appeared clearly at ease with 
Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
In brief comments after the meeting, Quayle described the session as "very 
good." 
</P>
<P>
"We talked a lot about his upcoming trip to Japan," said Quayle. "I was just 
there and we talked about some of the people he was going to be meeting. . . . 
Most of the conversation was focused on Japan and just some general social 
conversation." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, who leaves Thursday for a speaking tour of Japan, did not attend 
Quayle's Town Hall address, which took place next door to the former 
President's office. But he would not have been displeased by the speech's 
content. 
</P>
<P>
The vice president praised the protests of East Germans who have taken to the 
streets to seek more democratic government. 
</P>
<P>
"Last night, 120,000 people demonstrated for freedom in Leipzig, East Germany," 
he said. "Their call for freedom is eloquent and it deserves our strong 
support. . . . We must remember, however, that freedom's success is never 
assured. Poland is one road, the hopeful road for others to follow. Tian An Men 
Square is another road." 
</P>
<P>
As he has repeatedly, the vice president cautioned Americans not to make too 
much of recent liberal moves by the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"Although this is a time of hope, it is no time for complacency," said Quayle, 
who defended the U.S. military presence in several parts of the world, 
including the Philippines and Korea. 
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, this is a time to recognize that the world remains a very 
dangerous place." Quayle's travels and the sheer repetition of speech making 
have left him more relaxed on the political stump than he was at this time last 
year, when reporters hung on his every gaffe. 
</P>
<P>
Only one was readily apparent Tuesday -- when he greeted the crowd of 
"distinguished ladies and gentlemens" -- and the vice president even inspired a 
little laughter, if not much applause. Asked, for example, whether the U.S. 
should pressure the Japanese to increase their defense spending, Quayle offered 
a droll remark: 
</P>
<P>
"Before we get carried away and encourage Japan to rearm -- let's stop and 
think about it," he said. The audience, clearly thinking about Pearl Harbor, 
laughed.

BULLDOZER PARADE; 
</P>
<P>
CONVENTION CENTER EXPANSION GETS ROARING SEND-OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A parade of giant bulldozers carrying hard-hat-clad dignitaries, including Los 
Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, made for a roaring ground-breaking Monday as the Los 
Angeles Convention Center began undergoing a $390-million expansion that will 
make it one of the largest such facilities in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"A few shovels of dirt didn't seem right," said Dick Walsh, general manager of 
the downtown center after a bulldozer scooped up a huge bite of earth. 
</P>
<P>
The long-planned expansion of the city-owned and -operated facility is the 
second-largest redevelopment project ever undertaken by the Community 
Redevelopment Agency, ranking behind only the downtown Bunker Hill Urban 
Renewal Project of the 1960s, CRA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The project will nearly double the size of the center from 1.5 million to 2.5 
million square feet over 35 acres of land bounded by Pico Boulevard, Figueroa 
Street, Venice Boulevard and the Santa Monica and Harbor freeways. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion has involved the relocation of 408 families and the demolition of 
an entire neighborhood of mainly run-down apartments and commercial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
A five-acre open plaza, a two-story conference center spanning a block of Pico 
Boulevard, and two 150-foot glass pavilions reinforced with structural steel 
tubes will be included in the expanded center. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see this tremendous facility in the heart of downtown L.A. you will 
stick your chest out with pride," Bradley said after climbing down from the 
seat of a huge earthmover loaded on an 18-wheel flatbed truck. 
</P>
<P>
For more than five years, the city has lost tens of millions of dollars in 
convention and trade show business because the downtown center is not big 
enough or modern enough to compete with new facilities in other major cities, 
including Dallas, New York, Chicago, Las Vegas and New Orleans, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
These cities compete for large conventions because they attract visitors who 
spend dizzying amounts of money that fuel local economies and make the national 
trade show business a $12-billion-a-year industry, said Darlene Gudea, editor 
and publisher of Tradeshow Week, a convention and exhibitors trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
"The expansion is critical for Los Angeles because the city has been losing a 
number of huge shows simply because it does not have the space," Gudea said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles recently lost a men's apparel convention that moved to Las Vegas, 
taking with it 48,000 participants who spent about $14 million over four days 
at hotels, restaurants and shops, she said. 
</P>
<P>
When the Los Angeles expansion is completed in late 1992, the center will be 
the ninth largest in the country, and it is expected to generate $504 million 
annually for the local economy by 1994, officials said. The center will also 
bring 3,000 additional jobs to downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council approved the sale of $390 million in tax-exempt revenue bonds 
to finance the expansion four years ago. In addition, the CRA spent $126 
million, which was revenue generated through bond sales and property taxes on 
new downtown developments. 
</P>
<P>
The agency bought the 35 acres and relocated 1,500 people and 68 businesses 
that occupied the aging apartments and other buildings at the site. Families 
who once lived in substandard conditions were given the opportunity to move to 
newer and cheaper housing. 
</P>
<P>
Tough state relocation laws that protect tenants and the intervention of 
public-interest attorneys who negotiated on tenants' behalf made for a 
surprisingly smooth transition that ended in late 1988, officials said at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision to go ahead with this was a bold one," said CRA Chairman James M. 
Wood. "But the economic impact of this center will be enormous. And we had to 
do this if we wanted to compete with other cities." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the 2.5-million-square-foot expansion of the Los Angeles 
Convention Center will begin in February, 1990. The massive project will 
include the construction of two 150-foot-high glass pavilions. Upon completion 
in late 1992 the center will be the ninth largest facility in the nation.

30-CAR PILEUP SHUTS VINCENT THOMAS BRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A "massive chain-reaction collision" involving 30 cars and as many as 14 
separate accidents shut down traffic on the Vincent Thomas Bridge in San Pedro 
for 2 1/2 hours early Tuesday, according to the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the amount of property damage -- one CHP officer described it as "just 
a mass of damaged vehicles pointed in all directions" -- no one was seriously 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
The bumper-car-style pileup began at 5:45 a.m. when one car rear-ended another. 
From the first crunch to the last bump, the incident lasted just 13 minutes. 
During the pileup, a jackknifed truck blocked both eastbound lanes of the 
bridge and a car caught fire when a motorcycle slid underneath it. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically," said CHP Officer Ken Ratcliff, "it was just a bunch of collisions 
one after another that just blocked the whole bridge. . . . It stretched out 
for approximately 300 yards on the bridge -- 30 damaged vehicles, some turned 
backwards, some turned crossways." 
</P>
<P>
Two people suffered minor injuries. Motorcyclist James Lord, 34, fell off his 
bike before it slid under the car and fractured his foot. 
</P>
<P>
And the driver of one of the cars involved in the first collision, Flordileno 
Lahep, 47, of Gardena, suffered neck strain. 
</P>
<P>
Both were treated at St. Mary's Hospital in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
There was no damage to the bridge itself and no damage estimate was immediately 
available for the cars. 
</P>
<P>
Bridge workers and Caltrans officials said Tuesday's pileup was the biggest 
accident on the 26-year-old Vincent Thomas in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
The bridge, which connects San Pedro to Terminal Island, is a commuting route 
for hundreds who work on the industrial island in Los Angeles Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ratcliff, the first collision, in which Lahep's car rear-ended 
another, occurred on a curve just over the crest of the bridge. The road was 
somewhat slick, because of morning dew, but officials have not said what caused 
the initial crash. 
</P>
<P>
By the time other drivers spotted the crash, he said, it was too late for them 
to slow down to avoid it. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides of the bridge were reopened at about 8:15 a.m., Ratcliff said.

After her high school graduation in 1918, Edith Levy stopped taking piano 
lessons. But when she started a part-time job as a receptionist at Chicago's 
Sherwood Conservatory of Music two years ago, she got the idea to resume piano 
study -- nearly 70 years later. 
</P>
<P>
"The piano had always been an important part of my life, and there I was in an 
environment where people were playing the music I'd always loved most: 
classical music," says Levy, now 87. 
</P>
<P>
Having completed a group piano class and begun biweekly private lessons, her 
current project is a complex piece by Bach. "As my granddaughter puts it, I've 
never been the kind of grandmother who just sits at home and knits," she says. 
"I enjoy being active, and playing the piano gives me that opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
One of Levy's fellow students at the conservatory is Weldon Hall, 67, who began 
piano study while in his 50s. Now that he's retired, Hall spends more time than 
ever practicing the piano -- about 90 minutes a day. 
</P>
<P>
"I never could have found that much time to practice while I was working," he 
says. "Now I have a real sense of accomplishment because I've mastered some 
very difficult pieces -- and I've overcome my shyness about playing in front of 
other people." 
</P>
<P>
Brenda Dillon, a Dallas-based piano teacher who teaches several older adults, 
believes self-confidence is the most important factor determining whether or 
not they succeed at piano study. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a myth that older people have lesser abilities to memorize and 
perform, and that's just what it is -- a myth," she insists. "The only handicap 
I see in older piano students is that sometimes they start believing the myth 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Dillon reminds her older students that whatever physical difficulties they may 
have, technical problems can be found in piano students of all ages, "and with 
older people, often their great enthusiasm and self-discipline more than makes 
up for any physical challenges they may have."

NBC STALKS RATINGS WITH RAMIREZ STORY; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: HIS CONVICTION MEANS "TRACKDOWN" WON'T NEED A REWRITE AND THAT THE 
MOVIE WILL BE READY FOR THE SWEEPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sept. 20 was a "fairly jubilant day" on one particular Hollywood movie set, the 
producer related. That was the day on which Richard Ramirez was found guilty of 
conducting his reign of terror as the Night Stalker. 
</P>
<P>
In two days, cast and crew would be done and -- whew! -- wouldn't have to do 
any new scenes. 
</P>
<P>
As it is now, the NBC movie of "Trackdown: The Search for the Night Stalker" 
ends with that festive arrest of "suspect" Ramirez in East Los Angeles and his 
delivery to the County Jail pending trial. The producers are putting a crawl on 
the screen explaining that Ramirez was subsequently found guilty of 13 murders 
and 30 other felonies and was sentenced to death 19 times. 
</P>
<P>
Had he been found innocent, well, "It would have been a scene of him released 
from jail, vindicated by the court system," said executive producer Leonard 
Hill. "But we didn't have to shoot it." 
</P>
<P>
The murderous rampage took five months in 1985. The trial took 14 months and 
the jury deliberations 22 days. Although the movie took only 20 days to 
photograph, the project started about the time of Ramirez's arrest in August, 
1985. The script was done about two years ago; NBC gave the production order 
early last year. 
</P>
<P>
Now the producers are racing like the wind to get "Trackdown" edited and scored 
and generally beautified for airing during the November ratings "sweeps" (the 
date hasn't been set yet). NBC is paying the overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The story took some of the best criminal minds in Hollywood. Consider their 
rapsheets: 
</P>
<P>
Len Hill produced "Jack the Ripper" and "Nitti: The Enforcer" last season. 
Veteran TV cop-show writer Joe Gunn had 20 years in the Los Angeles Police 
Department before retiring as a commander; he ran all the detectives on the 
Westside and checked all the homicide calls. Tony Masucci, NBC vice president 
for movies and miniseries, has done movies on multiple killer Ted Bundy, the 
Billionaire Boys Club and the Hillside Strangler murderers. 
</P>
<P>
The heroes of this trackdown are Los Angeles Sheriff's Detectives Frank 
Salerno, who also was a key investigator on the Strangler, and Gil Carillo. 
They were selected as the point men in pursuit of what at first was a local 
character known quaintly as "The Valley Intruder." Then, from the San Gabriel 
Valley, the madness exploded into the San Fernando Valley and Orange County, 
then San Francisco and the whole state. 
</P>
<P>
The officers are portrayed by Richard Jordan as Salerno and A Martinez as 
Carillo. Veteran character actor Jordan knows something about demented people: 
He played the twisted, sweating serial killer to Kurt Russell's reporter in the 
feature "Mean Season." 
</P>
<P>
Young actor Gregory Cruz was cast in the unenviable role of Ramirez. He has 
very few lines, and represents more of a presence than a person, since the 
story focuses on the tracking down and not on the persona of the satanist 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Ramirez was captured, Gunn got a call from NBC saying that 
several writers were talking Ramirez projects and asking what he thought. He 
said he didn't like the idea of focusing on the killer. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought a far more interesting movie," he said, "was from the point of view 
of the detectives and how they captured him and about the panic that covered 
not only L.A. but the whole state. The heat and the fear and the panic buying 
of guns. How one guy had kind of changed our whole pattern of living." 
</P>
<P>
Why wasn't the movie done right away? 
</P>
<P>
"The primary reason was a respect for law enforcement," Hill said. "There was a 
sense that if we did the show, those law enforcement officials who worked very 
hard to apprehend Ramirez and prosecute Ramirez stood the risk potentially of 
mistrial based on the way we treated the movie before the trial itself was 
resolved." 
</P>
<P>
The movie is "scrupulously true," said Hill, and "extremely accurate," said 
Gunn. The only fictionalization of any significance is a composite journalist 
called Ann Clark (played by Lisa Eilbacher). 
</P>
<P>
Asserted Hill: "The arc of her story is based on very pertinent events that 
relate to that classic quandary that every journalist dealing with these kind 
of stories confronts, the reporter's responsibility to print all the news 
that's fit to print -- but occasionally not print because of the implications 
of revealing sensitive information." 
</P>
<P>
One or more of the true-life journalists -- the producers won't say who -- 
discovered key evidence that police wanted to keep undisclosed for fear that it 
might undermine an important avenue of investigation. In the movie, Clark's 
editor at the TV station insists that this information should be used; the 
reporter finally says no. 
</P>
<P>
"Various reporters are taking credit for it," Hill said. "I've never discussed 
it personally with any of them. We've had triple corroboration and the key 
corroboration came from Salerno. He said, yes, indeed, there was a problem when 
a reporter or a couple reporters tumbled onto footprint information which had 
been the one thread the cops were able to knit through a few different crimes." 
</P>
<P>
Then came the major breakthrough, an informant who turned up after the county 
supervisors approved a reward. The informant knew about jewelry that had been 
burgled and fenced by the Stalker and "said the guy's name was Rick and he was 
a Latino from El Paso," Hill explained. 
</P>
<P>
Using new laser technology, they found a single print in a suspect Toyota and 
it led to "Rick" Ramirez. With the name, police raised his photo. 
</P>
<P>
Hill said that much previously unreported information on the case will be 
related in the film -- including a major dispute over whether to release the 
photo of Ramirez to the media. Investigators Salerno and Carillo insisted that 
distributing the photo might prompt Ramirez to take flight; Sheriff Sherman 
Block and Police Chief Darryl Gates felt that the public needed to know to 
protect itself, even if it hindered the pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hill, "Well, the best drama is always an argument between people who are 
both right." 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, life goes on. Or, more appropriately, death goes on. 
</P>
<P>
Hill's next release is "Cross of Fire," an NBC miniseries set for Nov. 5 and 6. 
Starring John Heard (as KKK Grand Dragon D. C. Stephenson), Mel Harris, David 
Morse and Lloyd Bridges, it's another true tale of romance, murder and revenge 
in 1920s Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Gunn is consulting on the new-new "Adam 12" and "Dragnet" -- with 104 deadly 
episodes ordered for syndication. There's bound to be some murders in there. No 
comedies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Is Masucci planning any more mass murdering? "Certainly true-life crime is a 
subject that all networks and movie makers continue to go back to because there 
seems to be an audience fascination with that kind of stuff," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the next thing we're doing is Joe McGinniss' 'Blind Faith.' It's not 
mass murder but true-life crime. It's going into production the end of the 
month." 
</P>
<P>
In the miniseries, Robert Urich plays insurance executive Rob Marshall, now 
residing on Death Row for killing his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Also coming up on the NBC longer-form schedule: "Murder in Mississippi," 
"Murder in Paradise," "Man Against the Mob II: Man in Cement," "Perry Mason: 
The Case of the Murder Mystery Murder," "Drug Wars: The Camarena Story," 
"Howard Beach: Making the Case for Murder" and "Hiroshima: Out of the Ashes."

KJOI TO DROP EASY-LISTENING FORMAT SUNDAY; 
</P>
<P>
RADIO: THE STATION WILL REPLACE INSTRUMENTALS WITH SOFT VOCALS AND LIGHT JAZZ 
IN AN EFFORT TO ATTRACT YOUNGER LISTENERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In an unusual move for a successful radio station, KJOI-FM (98.7) said Tuesday 
it will abandon the "easy listening" instrumental format it has employed for 
the last 25 years in favor of soft vocals and light jazz. 
</P>
<P>
The switch, effective Sunday, comes as a surprise because KJOI ranks fifth 
among Southern California's most-listened-to radio stations in the latest 
Arbitron ratings and, according to Bob Griffith, KJOI vice president and 
general manager, enjoys a 23% increase in advertising revenue this year over 
the same period in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The change from the station's traditional "elevator music" format was prompted 
by KJOI's lack of audience growth and a desire among station officials to reach 
slightly younger listeners. 
</P>
<P>
"We were not unhappy with our ratings," Griffith said. "We found that most of 
the research indicated that the radio station was not growing. . . . And our 
competition, for the most part, is growing by leaps and bounds. If everyone 
else is growing and you're not, you're perceived to be losing." 
</P>
<P>
After eight months of surveys, station officials said, they determined that the 
desired target audience (between ages 35 and 54) would best be reached through 
an updated format. Currently, the average listener is over 45, Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
Attracting younger listeners is mandatory if KJOI is "to compete in the '90s," 
said operations manager Allan Hotlen. 
</P>
<P>
"The term 'elevator music' is perceived as a negative," Griffith said. "And 
KJOI is synonymous with elevator music. That's why we felt we have to 
re-package." 
</P>
<P>
The mix will be 75% soft vocals -- by artists such as Anita Baker, Don Henley, 
Carly Simon, Al Jarreau and Neil Diamond -- and 25% instrumental light jazz, by 
such musicians as David Sanborn, David Benoit and Kenny G. KJOI executives said 
85% of the music will be compositions recorded in the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We still would like to be the softest radio station on the dial . . . but what 
we'd like to do is update the programming," Griffith said. "We think of it as 
an opportunity to keep our current listeners and also attract new listeners." 
</P>
<P>
The station will keep its call letters, though downplaying them in favor of the 
identifying slogan, "Touch 98.7." 
</P>
<P>
Terms such as passion, affection, bonding and emotion were bandied about by 
KJOI officials at a news conference announcing the change Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We think 'Touch' reflects the emotionalism and realness that maybe people 
don't find available on radio of today," Hotlen said. "We think our success 
will be a function largely of how people bond with the radio station." 
</P>
<P>
Television advertisements will feature soft, sultry songs and couples nuzzling 
or children smiling and the slogan, "Music you can really feel." 
</P>
<P>
The station will not feature flashy on-air personalities, nor will it offer 
big-money giveaways, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Capparela, the mellifluous-voiced former KFAC-FM announcer who was briefly 
at KUSC-FM after KFAC changed formats Sept. 21, will move over to KJOI next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
With rock stations jockeying for position to corner the coveted teen audience, 
an opportunity to reach more middle-aged people has opened up, Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
"What has happened to L.A. is that as a lot of radio stations become more 
rock-based, they're deserting an area that is very advantageous: adults about 
40," Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
The station is expected to compete with KOST-FM (103.5), currently the No. 1 
station in the market, and KBIG-FM (104.3), which ranked No. 8 in the latest 
Arbitron survey. 
</P>
<P>
Both KOST and KBIG also made the switch from easy listening during the '80s.

The sounds could have been from any construction site. From seven stories up 
came the clang of steel against steel, punctuated by wolf whistles and catcalls 
directed at young women walking by below. 
</P>
<P>
But that was Monday afternoon at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Tonight, 
the edifice will ring with "Steel Wheels" and cries of "awright" and "whooo!" 
from one Michael Phillip Jagger, who will be fronting the Rolling Stones on the 
first of the venerable rock institution's four nights at the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The focus of the more than 280,000 people expected at the shows will be on 
Jagger and his four Stones mates. Few will give much, if any, thought to what 
went in to mounting the event. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Ahern, however, will be thinking of little else. He's the production 
coordinator for the Stones' "Steel Wheels" tour -- the band's first U.S. tour 
in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 3 million people are expected to see the band during the 3 1/2-month 
tour that began Aug. 31 in Philadelphia and ends Dec. 14 in Montreal. The 
expected box office gross for the tour: a cool $90 million. 
</P>
<P>
Ahern is in charge of making sure everything is ready in each city when the 
Stones step on stage and begin playing "Start Me Up," the show's opening 
number. 
</P>
<P>
Among his daily concerns: overseeing the 240-strong construction and technical 
crews, the 800,000 pounds -- 10 semi trucks worth -- of steel scaffolding that 
supports the elaborate stage (including the 50-foot inflatable woman who makes 
an appearance during the show), and the sound, lighting and video equipment 
that will eat up 2.4 million watts of electricity each night. 
</P>
<P>
A cheerful man with a Brillo pad of graying hair, Ahern was so relaxed Monday 
as he stood on the Coliseum field and pronounced everything was on schedule 
that he couldn't resist jokingly exaggerating the cultural importance of this 
undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
"All this stuff," he said, waving at the stage-in-progress, "is to project an 
environment. If you think of L.A. as being the center of civilization that it 
is, and you think of the Coliseum as being the head and the stage as a crown on 
which the Rolling Stones -- the jewel -- is placed." 
</P>
<P>
Ahern can be forgiven for taking the endeavor in humorous stride -- he's 
something of a pioneer of the big stadium shows. A 20-year veteran of rock 
concert staging, the former stage manager of New York's old Fillmore East has 
overseen three previous Stones tours, David Bowie's 1983 and 1988 shows and 
such trail-blazing work as last year's Amnesty International stadium dates in 
cities such as New Delhi, where major Western rock shows had never been staged. 
</P>
<P>
This set of shows will be the second time the Coliseum has hosted four nights 
of one act. Bruce Springsteen played four nights in 1985 to a total audience of 
more than 320,000. (Capacity varies with the placement of the stage and sound 
equipment.) The Stones' shows may well be the biggest Ahern has worked on, but 
it's not the hardest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more stuff," he said. "But people are more used to it now, and the 
facilities and promoters and local crews are more into it because of the 
success of past productions by such groups as the Stones, Bowie, Pink Floyd and 
Genesis, who have tried to make big statements with the shows. 
</P>
<P>
"At first on this tour, all the bits and pieces took a lot of working out," 
Ahern said of the process that began last year with Jagger and drummer Charlie 
Watts presenting the initial design concepts for the urban decay set. "Now 
people know the specifics. Things like production and construction are actually 
fairly orderly now." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Luukko, the Coliseum and Sports Arena general manager, called this the 
"biggest show ever in terms of the size of the stage and the magnitude of the 
act." He was impressed by how smoothly the set-up was going, but he too said it 
has become routine. 
</P>
<P>
"Rock 'n' roll has grown up," he said. "The promoters, facilities, acts, police 
and fire -- pretty much work together now. Promoters and the acts have matured 
in terms of safety and those concerns, while the police have mellowed to the 
point where they're more in tune with peer security." 
</P>
<P>
Luukko did add that some measures are taken to adapt procedures to specific 
shows and anticipated audiences. For example, no alcohol will be sold at the 
Coliseum for these shows, due to the young audience that second-billed Guns N' 
Roses draws. And the scheduling of the Coliseum and Sports Arena presents 
further problems. 
</P>
<P>
In the five-day span of the Stones shows, the Sports Arena will be hosting a 
Clippers preseason basketball game, a volleyball exhibition and a professional 
wrestling match. And with the Raiders having played football at at the Coliseum 
last Sunday, the Stones crew was left with just two and a half days for what is 
normally a four-day set-up time. 
</P>
<P>
"Before (Raider player) Bo Jackson was in the locker room, we were laying 
plywood on the field," Luukko said. 
</P>
<P>
Ahern also had to deal with other details that may seem mundane, but could 
cause considerable contention if not handled smoothly. As he stood at the base 
of the stage, he viewed the large Miller High Life sign that adorns the 
Coliseum scoreboard directly behind the stage. The problem: the Stones tour is 
sponsored by Budweiser. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not because it's Miller and not Budweiser," Ahern explained. "Buildings 
have agreements (with their sponsors) and you can't mess with it. But if it's 
part of the stage picture like this, you might try to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
But those are problems that can be dealt with. What is the biggest headache for 
Ahern at each stop of the tour is something that seems like mere minutia, but 
is nonetheless a persistent annoyance. 
</P>
<P>
"Backstage passes, parking passes and T-shirts," he moaned. "People are always 
asking me, 'Can I get a T-shirt?' " 
</P>
<P>
Parking lots open for tonight's 6 p.m. show at 3 p.m., with stadium gates 
scheduled to open an hour later. The music begins with Living Colour, the New 
York-based quartet that is the opening act on all the stops on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
Guns N' Roses, the Los Angeles-based hard-rock group that is only joining the 
Stones for these Coliseum dates, will follow at 7:30 p.m., followed by the 
Stones around 9 p.m. The band's sets on other tour stops have been as long as 2 
1/2 hours. The schedule's the same for Thursday, but the Saturday and Sunday 
shows each begin at 3:30 p.m. There is no show Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Though there were questions about the Stones' ability to be effective after a 
7-year layoff, reviews of the veteran band's shows (most of the members are in 
their mid to late 40s) have been almost uniformly strong. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TICKETS 
</P>
<P>
Approximately 1,000 tickets remain available through Ticketmaster for tonight's 
Rolling Stones concert, though they're all near the back. The Thursday, 
Saturday and Sunday shows are sold out. Seats for all nights, and in all 
sections, are available through local ticket brokers -- if you are willing to 
pay for them. A survey of brokers came up with a range going from seats in the 
first 10 rows (for between $600 and $700) to near the back (as low as $50). 
Thursday tickets are most plentiful, while the weekend shows are harder to come 
by.

For the second morning in a row, Orange County's John Wayne Airport was closed 
because of fog until 8:45 a.m. today, airport officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The closure compounded problems that started when the airport was closed 
because of limited visibility starting at 6:50 p.m. Tuesday, which remained in 
effect all night, Assistant Airport Manager Jan Mittermeier said. 
</P>
<P>
But because of the closure Tuesday evening, only about three aircraft remained 
grounded by morning today, Mittermeier added. "We didn't have a mess as far as 
the planes trying to get out of here because none were on the ground," 
Mittermeier said. 
</P>
<P>
Airport operations were also halted Tuesday morning until 10 a.m. because of 
fog.

Cuba was elected today to the Security Council for the first time since its 
revolution 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said Cuba's election was a sign of increasing respectability and 
importance for the Communist nation still shunned by the U.S. government and 
subjected to a trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government, which did not openly oppose Cuba's seating, said it hoped 
the Havana government will act constructively on the council. It called on Cuba 
to respect the Central American peace accords and not to interfere with 
military or covert aid in regional affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Cuba served on the council was in 1956, before its 1959 
revolution. The only other time was in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba was elected by the General Assembly in a secret ballot, along with four 
other non-permanent members of the council serving two-year terms. Cuba, which 
replaces Brazil, received the highest number of votes in the balloting -- 146 
out of 156 votes cast.

OC DISASTER PREPAREDNESS, MILITARY UNITS EXTEND HELP

In the wake of the catastrophic earthquake that hit the San Francisco Bay Area 
Tuesday, Orange County's disaster preparedness agencies and the military 
mobilized today to provide relief to the shattered Northern California 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
Among the first to go was the California Army National Guard's 143rd Combat 
Support Hospital based in Los Alamitos. At least 11 doctors, nurses and medics, 
along with tents, tables and beds, were loaded onto a C-130 transport Tuesday 
night bound for Travis Air Force Base near Sacramento, where the unit will 
await further assignment. This morning, helicopters and crews from the 140th 
Aviation Battalion at Los Alamitos also was sent to provide medical evacuation 
services for the hospital unit set up at Travis Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 10,000 callers swamped 38 telephone lines at the Orange 
County Chapter of the American Red Cross in Santa Ana, which is seeking 
donations, and local utilities and fire departments have volunteered repair and 
emergency crews. Red Cross spokeswoman Sylvia Stewart said 25 lines are being 
installed to accommodate callers from throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
This morning, at least 100 volunteers also arrived at Red Cross offices 
offering to give blood or help in the relief effort. Stewart said 290 pints of 
blood were sent by the Orange County chapter to the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart said the Red Cross is suggesting that local residents wanting to help 
in the relief effort donate money to the national organization's disaster fund, 
which was depleted by Hurricane Hugo in September. 
</P>
<P>
Donations can be sent to the American Red Cross, Orange County Chapter, 601 N. 
Golden Circle Dr., Santa Ana, Calif., 92711. Contributors should mark 
"earthquake" on donation checks. Food and blankets also will be accepted, 
Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
Also on standby is Orange County Fire Department's heavy rescue team, a group 
of trained rescue workers and fire engines. It is awaiting word from the state 
Office of Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Fire Chief Ken MacLeod said the department's four-man rescue squad was 
dispatched to Mexico City several years ago during that city's major earthquake 
to aid in finding survivors amid the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Southern California Edison Co. in Orange County contacted 
communities in the Bay Area and offered to provide materials, repair crews and 
engineering assistance to help restore power.

BUSH ACTS QUICKLY TO SEND FEDERAL AID TO DEVASTATED AREA

<P>
With a swiftness not seen in two previous disasters, President Bush sent 
federal aid to earthquake-ravaged Northern California today and promised to 
"take every step and make every effort to help the Bay Area." 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to turn to the American people to help those in need," he said. 
"So far, I think from an organizational standpoint, people are moving in the 
right direction and we're going to follow it very, very closely from here." 
</P>
<P>
Just more than 12 hours after the San Francisco Bay area was jolted by its 
worst killer earthquake in 80 years, Bush signed a disaster declaration that 
could clear the way for hundreds of millions of dollars in federal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Having taken political heat for a slow response to two other disasters -- the 
Exxon oil spill and Hurricane Hugo -- Bush cranked the federal machinery up to 
full speed, rushing civilian and military assistance to the area. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said $273 million of the $1.1 
billion appropriated by Congress for cleanup efforts after Hugo will be 
available immediately for earthquake victims in California. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes of Tuesday's quake, White House officials began marshaling 
federal resources for an all-out response that included activation of a 
2-year-old catastrophic earthquake response plan involving the Red Cross and 26 
federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was too early to estimate the eventual cost, Fitzwater predicted it 
would far exceed the damage caused by Hugo, which struck the Carolina coast 
after hitting the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
During a visit to headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Bush 
said he hoped the quick response would lead to "less carping" than was the case 
after Hugo. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was to receive a report by telephone this afternoon from Vice President 
Dan Quayle and Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, who flew to the area 
to survey the damage. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he "probably will" visit the area, but not immediately because "I 
don't want to get in the way."

The Chicago area's first snow of the season fell this morning, about two weeks

The plane, en route from Minneapolis to Phoenix, slid about 1,000 feet off the

94% IN S. KOREA BACK U.S. TROOP ROLE, ROH DECLARES

South Korean President Roh Tae Woo told Congress today that 94% of his 
countrymen support the presence of 43,000 U.S. troops and that anti-American 
demonstrators represent only a "tiny band of extremists." 
</P>
<P>
"The extreme elements in Korea will diminish in influence as the benefits of 
democracy and prosperity are enjoyed more and more," Roh told a joint meeting 
of the Senate and House. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to unnamed dissidents, Roh said: "Regrettably, certain radicals have 
resorted to force and committed unlawful acts to pursue their aims under the 
guise of democratic reform. . . . Here are also the tiny band of extremists who 
parade anti-American slogans and perpetrate attacks on U.S. facilities." 
</P>
<P>
In the latest such incident, six militant students invaded and vandalized the 
U.S. ambassador's residence in Seoul last week. 
</P>
<P>
Roh said his own party and the political opposition are united in backing the 
American military presence that he and President Bush agreed in talks Tuesday 
continues to be vital for deterring attack by communist North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
In the population as a whole, he said "a very recent poll has shown that 94% 
strongly support the presence of U.S. troops." 
</P>
<P>
"Any hint of weakening in the U.S. defense commitment or (sudden) lessening of 
the U.S. military presence might cause North Korea to misjudge the U.S. 
commitment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Roh said his government is "exerting every possible effort to . . . convince 
North Korea that nothing will be achieved by force." He voiced hope that South 
Korea's expanding relations with the Soviet Union, China and other communist 
countries would help ease North Korean hostility. 
</P>
<P>
Roh was the second Korean president in history to address Congress. The first 
was Syngman Rhee, founder of the Republic of Korea, who in 1954 thanked the 
American people for saving his country from communism in the 1950-53 Korean 
War. 
</P>
<P>
Changes in his country, he said, "are so diverse, rapid and far-reaching that 
they can be truly called revolutionary."

HONECKER OUSTED IN E. GERMANY, ENDING 18 YEARS OF IRON RULE

<TEXT>
<P>
East German leader Erich Honecker was stripped of power today, ending 18 years 
of iron-fisted rule as the government grapples with growing public demands for 
a freer society. 
</P>
<P>
State news media said the Communist Party hierarchy replaced its 77-year-old 
leader with Egon Krenz, a Honecker protege and the youngest member of the 
ruling Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
Honecker, who directed the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961, will also be 
relieved of his largely ceremonial post as head of state and as chief of the 
military, the government-run news agency ADN said. 
</P>
<P>
ADN said Krenz, 52, in charge of security issues and government-run youth 
groups, had already taken over as the party chief and will be recommended for 
the posts as military chief and head of state. 
</P>
<P>
The latter two require the approval of the nation's Parliament, and that is 
guaranteed by the strong central control of the government. 
</P>
<P>
Krenz, like Honecker, is considered a Communist hard-liner. However, he 
signaled a softer stance when he reportedly urged police to stop their harsh 
crackdown on the thousands of people who have been staging protests in recent 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Two other key members of the ruling Politburo lost their positions. 
</P>
<P>
Politburo member Joachim Herrmann, 60, who was in charge of the nation's media, 
and Guenter Mittag, 63, the architect of East Germany's economic policy, "were 
relieved of their functions," ADN reported. 
</P>
<P>
ADN said both men had also lost their posts on the Communist Party's 163-member 
Central Committee and 21-member Politburo, and Mittag will be relieved of his 
duties as deputy head of state. 
</P>
<P>
The move apparently was an attempt to placate growing public demands for a 
freer press and economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The change in leadership comes as East Germany is still reeling from the exodus 
in recent months of tens of thousands of its citizens seeking better wages and 
more freedom in the West. The flight has been followed by public dissent 
unprecedented in this Communist country. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, President Bush said Krenz's rise to power was unlikely to signal 
fundamental change. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether that reflects a change in East-West relations, I don't think so," he 
said. "Mr. Krenz has been very much in accord with the policies of Honecker. So 
it's too early to say." 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl welcomed the leadership change and 
said he hoped Krenz will "make the way free" for a better life for East 
Germans. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that in the interest of our countrymen that the reform process that 
has been so sympathetically received in Poland and Hungary and also in the 
Soviet Union will finally get its chance in East Germany as well," Kohl told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
ADN said Honecker asked to be relieved of his official duties for "health 
reasons." Honecker has reportedly been in ill health following a gallbladder 
operation in August. 
</P>
<P>
But Honecker had been under pressure to resign after a wave of protests swept 
the country.

Pacific Bell officials said today their telephone network survived Tuesday's 
devastating Northern California earthquake without significant damage, but the 
system was being overloaded by a huge increase in calls into and out of the San 
Francisco area. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the surge in long-distance calls to the region, many calls were 
being blocked. Recorded messages told callers to try again later. 
</P>
<P>
The local network around San Francisco was unscathed, but because of the big 
increase in calls, callers were having difficulty connecting with the network, 
said Mary Hallisey, a Washington spokeswoman for Pacific Bell's parent, the 
Pacific Telesis Group. 
</P>
<P>
"The local network is in fine shape," Hallisey said. "There is no damage to the 
central offices or the network itself. It is operating. There is a gridlock 
problem based on the fact that so many people are trying to call in all at 
once. . . . When you pick up the phone out there you don't get a dial tone 
right away. . . . The system is not out, it's just a very slow dial tone." 
</P>
<P>
"You've got customers trying to get hold of friends, loved ones, work," said 
Sue Galloway, district manager for Pacific Bell's network in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"It's extremely heavy, and my anticipation is it will get heavier as the day 
goes on." 
</P>
<P>
"We're asking people not to call in for a 24-hour period," said Lissa Zanville, 
a Pacific Bell spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., which handles about 70% of the nation's 
long-distance calls, appealed to people not to try telephoning the earthquake 
area.

HOUSE PANEL OKS BILL TO BLOCK AIRLINE BUYOUTS

<P>
The House Public Works and Transportation Committee today approved legislation 
to give the Transportation Department the right to block takeovers of major 
airlines if safety or competition would be compromised. 
</P>
<P>
The bill cleared the committee by a vote of 23 to 5 despite claims that it 
could be the first step toward congressional regulation of leveraged buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
"The government doesn't have a role in determining individual transactions and 
second-guessing the marketplace," said Rep. Arlan Stangeland (R-Minn.), calling 
the bill an impediment to the economics of the airline industry. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would require DOT to block takeovers of major airlines if the 
acquisition would financially weaken the carrier and lead to a deterioration in 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of 15% of a carrier's voting stock also would be blocked if it 
would lead to the sale of a substantial portion of assets or jeopardize its 
ability to compete. The takeover could not go through if control went to a 
foreign interest. The bill applies to airlines worth at least $750 million. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, which is similar to legislation approved by the Senate Commerce, 
Science and Transportation Committee, had been rushed through Congress because 
of concerns about Donald J. Trump's attempts to take over AMR Corp., parent 
company of American Airlines Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Trump, a New York billionaire, withdrew his $7.5-billion bid on Monday, hours 
before a House aviation subcommittee passed the legislation but he said he may 
make another bid for the country's largest airline.

31.9 MILLION AMERICANS IN POVERTY IN '88; 13.1% RATE

<P>
The nation's poverty rate was 13.1% last year, about the same as in 1987, the 
Census Bureau reported today. That means 31.9 million Americans were living in 
poverty in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, about 32.3 million people, or 13.4% of the population, were living in 
poverty. The Census Bureau said the changes between 1987 and 1988 were not 
statistically significant. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau also reported that Americans' median household income was 
$27,230 in 1988, up from $27,140 a year earlier after adjusting for the rise in 
consumer prices. Again, the change was not considered significant. 
</P>
<P>
Per capita income, meanwhile, rose 1.7% to an all-time high of $13,120 in 1988, 
a change that was considered significant. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a year basically in which most groups stayed the same or improved," said 
William Butz, associate director for demographics at the Census Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
The report said the nation's poverty rate for whites declined by 0.3% last year 
to 10.1%. The poverty rate for blacks was 31.6%, down from 32.6% in 1987, and 
the rate for Latinos dipped to 26.8% from 28.1%. None of those changes was 
considered significant. 
</P>
<P>
Regionally, the only statistically significant change in the poverty rate 
occurred in the Midwest, where the rate dropped from 12.5% in 1987 to 11.5% 
last year. The poverty rate in the South was 16.2% in 1988, up from 16.1%. In 
the West, the rate was 12.7%, up from 12.5%, and in the Northeast, the rate was 
10.2%, down from 10.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Today's report on poverty in 1988 was prepared by the Census Bureau based on a 
survey of about 58,000 U.S. households last March. 
</P>
<P>
While debate rages over the cost and adequacy of programs to fight poverty, 
battles also continue over defining and counting it. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates for the poor insist the formal definition underestimates the problem 
because it does not really reflect their spending habits. 
</P>
<P>
But other researchers contend the measurement may overestimate poverty because 
it only considers people's cash income and not government assistance. 
</P>
<P>
The official definition of poverty was developed by the Social Security 
Administration in 1964 based on Department of Agriculture research on what 
people spend on food. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture analysts had calculated that people spent about one-third of their 
income to eat, and developed a variety of plans to provide adequate nutrition 
at high-, middle- and low-cost levels. 
</P>
<P>
The definition of poverty was then set at three times the cost of the lowest 
price food program, known as the thrifty food plan. 
</P>
<P>
Adjusted annually for inflation, the poverty threshold has risen from about 
$3,000 per year in the early 1960s to nearly $12,000 today for a family of 
four. The poverty level varies slightly for urban and rural residents and rises 
with the size of family. Many assistance programs kick in at 125% of the 
poverty rate. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years advocates for the poor have challenged that thinking, 
contending the cost of living has changed over the years.

Philip Morris Companies Inc. said today its third-quarter earnings climbed 
20.5% as sales soared 45.4%, reflecting the inclusion of results from Kraft 
Inc. acquired late last year. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris, which makes such widely known brands as Marlboro cigarettes, 
Miller beer, Oscar Mayer meats and Post cereals, said it earned $748 million, 
or 81 cents a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with $621 
million, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Third-quarter revenue soared to $11.25 billion from $7.74 billion a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Operating revenue was up from the company's cigarette operations as unit sales. 
Higher beer volume at the Miller Brewing Co. led to higher operating revenue in 
that division as well. The company provided no specific figures.

The NCAA Council announced today unanimous endorsement of a year-round random 
drug-testing program and tougher penalties for athletes who test positive, NCAA 
President Albert M. Witte said. 
</P>
<P>
The 46-member council ended three days of closed-door meetings, setting its 
agenda of proposals it will sponsor at the full NCAA convention in Dallas on 
Jan. 7-10. 
</P>
<P>
Witte said the drug-testing program would call for longer suspensions for 
athletes, but he did not offer specific penalties. He said the feeling among 
the council members, composed of faculty representatives from all three 
divisions, was to show "more concern and compassion for those athletes found to 
use street drugs." 
</P>
<P>
The council also denied an appeal for immediate eligibility for Chris Mills, 
who transferred from Kentucky to Arizona after Kentucky's basketball program 
was placed on three years probation. Mills had claimed he was not involved in 
any of the violations for which Kentucky was put on probation and should be 
able to compete immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"Mills voluntarily transferred and, according to the Division 1 steering 
committee, he seems to fit within the category of voluntary transfer students," 
Witte said. "The committee saw no reason to make an exception in this case."

Bob Welch, the scheduled pitcher for the Oakland Athletics in Game 3 of the 
World Series, looked with dismay at his earthquake-damaged future home today 
after a walk through the hard-hit Marina district. 
</P>
<P>
Welch, with a pained expression on his face, turned to his wife, Mary Ellen, 
and gave a "thumbs down" sign. His wife held the couple's 10-week-old son, 
Dylan, in her arms and tried unsuccessfully to hold back tears, after a short 
walk from their current residence, an apartment which suffered no serious 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
The couple recently bought the condominium unit in a two-story building. As a 
result of the quake, the exterior of the building has large cracks, mostly 
around the ground-level garage door and building entryway. 
</P>
<P>
"One good thing, we've got earthquake insurance," Welch said just before seeing 
the damaged building.

JERRY BUSS SHOPPING, HAS EYES ON S.D. PADRES

Los Angeles Lakers owner Jerry Buss says he's "in the market for a baseball 
team" and will see about buying the San Diego Padres following owner Joan 
Kroc's announcement that she is selling the club. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably will make a call (today) and throw my hat in the ring," Buss said 
after Kroc's statement on Tuesday that the franchise is on the block because 
she wants to spend more time with her family. (Story, Section C). 
</P>
<P>
"There comes a time in everyone's life when you have to look at your 
priorities, and my first priority is my family," Kroc said. "So I intend to 
semi-retire from public life to maximize the quality time I have with them, to 
travel and to enjoy my own personal time." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Kapstein, a longtime player agent who is married to Kroc's daughter, 
Linda, has been authorized to handle sale discussions with prospective buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Sources have told The Times that the selling price could exceed $100 million, 
which would be the largest amount ever paid for a team. 
</P>
<P>
Buss, who has a house in Encinitas in northern San Diego County, said he is "in 
the market for a baseball team." 
</P>
<P>
"One hundred million for the Padres sounds a little high, offhand, but you 
really don't know until you see the P-and-Ls (profit and loss statements) and 
take a closer look at it," Buss said. 
</P>
<P>
Buss noted that he wrote a letter to Kroc this summer asking about the 
franchise's availability, but received a reply from her representatives saying 
the club was not for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The franchise is tied to the city by a lease agreement for use of San Diego 
Jack Murphy Stadium that runs through March, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Kroc put the team up for sale in November, 1986, and a tentative agreement was 
announced in March, 1987, to sell it to George Argyros, then the owner of the 
Seattle Mariners. But the sale fell through and was aborted in May, 1987, with 
Kroc deciding she would hold onto the club for the time being.
