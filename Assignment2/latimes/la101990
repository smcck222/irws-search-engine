MRS. KEATING'S PLEA FOR HER JAILED HUSBAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is now 18 months since many of us investors found out that we have lost 
$30,000, $40,000 or $50,000 through fraudulent representation by Keating. 
</P>
<P>
First, I must say that Mrs. Keating is lucky she still has a husband; many of 
us investors do not. We meddle along financially and investment-wise hoping 
that what we do have will last for our lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Keating, "good solid citizens" do not cheat other citizens out of their 
life savings. Yes, I do believe you are very naive. If Charlie were "a loving, 
caring and honest individual," I would still have my $30,000 investment intact 
and earning interest. I wouldn't be worried about my future.

SHELBY STEELE ON PREFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times gave so much play to Steele's new book because it says what every, 
even minimally racist white person or pitifully misguided "Uncle Tom" 
African-American wants to hear -- that the "free ride" blacks have supposedly 
gotten through affirmative action is not only unfair to whites but hurts 
blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Bullstripes! Racism hurts black people directly and others indirectly. 
</P>
<P>
All affirmative action does, in the rare instances where it is actually 
enforced, is give blacks, women and other minorities a chance. That's all we 
want in the first place. It is ingrained and institutionalized racism that 
keeps us from getting that chance. 
</P>
<P>
My parents taught me the truth, as did Steele's parents, that as a black 
person, I have to be twice as good as a white person to be considered as 
capable. It is my experience that affirmative action programs allow a few more 
of the overly qualified black people to get a shot at middle management. We 
are, more often than not, still cut off from the top. 
</P>
<P>
Except for pockets of prejudice in states like California and Texas, other 
minority groups have not and do not face the same level of discrimination that 
black people do. White people don't have to feel guilty for the injustices 
historically visited upon the black race; there's plenty of current crapola to 
feel bad about.

WRONG DIRECTION ON CIVIL RIGHTS; 
</P>
<P>
IT DOESN'T FORCE QUOTAS -- BUSH SHOULDN'T VETO IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If President George Bush makes good on his threat to veto the Civil Rights Act 
of 1990, it will not only be an act of unfeeling misgovernment, but also 
another sign of his party's failure to resolve the contradiction between what 
it says it intends toward minority Americans and what it actually does for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
When former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke ran for the U.S. Senate as a 
Republican, Bush and other GOP leaders were sincerely horrified and rushed to 
repudiate him. They have been less quick to forswear their party's historic 
antipathy toward civil rights legislation -- an antipathy that made it easier 
for Duke to call himself a Republican, however uneasy it made GOP regulars feel 
to hear him say so. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush and the other Republican leaders of his generation are the 
architects of a strategy designed to wean Southern white and Northern ethnic 
voters away from their traditional Democratic loyalties. The key element in 
that approach is the anxiety both groups share about the legal and economic 
gains women, African-Americans and other minorities have made as the result of 
the civil rights movement. The GOP's strategy has been an electoral success, 
but it all too frequently has turned the the party of Lincoln and Emancipation 
into the party of white male privilege through obfuscation. 
</P>
<P>
It is, of course, the habit of American political discourse to excuse 
inequality through euphemism: states' rights, separate but equal, reverse 
discrimination. The circumlocution Bush employs to justify his hostility to the 
Civil Rights Act of 1990 is "quotas." The President insists the bill will force 
quotas despite the fact it explicitly says, "Nothing in the amendments made by 
this act shall be construed to require or encourage an employer to adopt hiring 
or promotional quotas on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national 
origin." But Bush recently wrote: "I am convinced that it will have the effect 
of forcing businesses to adopt quotas. . . It will also foster divisiveness and 
litigation. . . and do more to promote legal fees than civil rights." 
</P>
<P>
These observations are hard to reconcile with the bill's explicit disclaimer 
and its actual provisions. The Civil Rights Act of 1990 aims to reverse six 
recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions that have weakened existing federal laws 
against employment discrimination. Among other things, it requires that 
employers once again bear the burden of legally justifying practices or 
policies whose objective effect is to create discriminatory patterns in hiring 
or promotion. It also allows victims of sexual, religious or ethnic 
discrimination to seek the same compensatory and punitive damages already 
available to those who have suffered racial discrimination. Fair-minded people 
will search such proposals in vain for the dire consequences over which Bush 
frets. 
</P>
<P>
The President already has said he will allow a bill restricting advertising on 
children's television to become law without his signature, even though he 
personally feels it abridges some First Amendment freedoms. Americans are 
entitled to wonder why he cannot do the same for the Civil Rights Act of 1990.

<TEXT>
<P>
The commentary on affirmative action programs by Shelby Steele ("The High Price 
of Preference," Bookmark, Opinion, Sept. 30) was especially disturbing in that 
it rehashes the old stereotypical racist view that affirmative action programs 
promote the hiring of less competent minority workers at the expense of more 
qualified whites. As a personnel specialist in public sector hiring, I can 
assure the readers that we are choosing from equally unqualified candidates.

PROPOSITION 144; 
</P>
<P>
PRISON BREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the 1980s, the number of prisoners in California rose from about 20,000 
to more than 90,000, all of them crammed into prisons designed to hold about 
50,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Corrections plans to more than double prison capacity by the 
mid-1990s, leaving them holding only about one-third more inmates than they 
were designed for. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian has said that Californians might have to approve bond 
issues in every general election between now and then to complete the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Voters have, in fact, approved prison bonds in every general election since 
1984 and in the primary this year. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 144 on the Nov. 6 ballot calls for another $450- million worth of 
bonds, but there seem to be good reasons for letting the timetable on prison 
bonds slip a few months. 
</P>
<P>
First, Deukmejian will turn over his office in January to a new governor who 
should be given time to review the state's prison policies, particularly in 
light of a recent commission report on prison management. 
</P>
<P>
The state will not run out of prison money while a review goes on. Counting 
revenue bonds approved by the Legislature in July, the state already is 
authorized to sell more than $2-billion worth of prison bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Californians have approved $4-billion worth of bond issues so far this 
year and will vote billions more next month. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all are for good causes. Few can afford delay, but Proposition 144 is 
an exception. For these reasons, we urge a no vote on 144.

MRS. KEATING'S PLEA FOR HER JAILED HUSBAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Mary Elaine Keating Objects," letter, Oct. 9: 
</P>
<P>
I grieve that such a good Christian and devoted family man as Charlie Keating 
is incarcerated. After all, we all know the sacred tenets of Christianity 
dictate that we "sell to the weak, meek and the ignorant" and to "memorize our 
sales pitch as if it flows from our mouth like an exhaust pipe," as Charlie's 
infamous in-house memo instructed. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Mary Elaine, your husband's mug should be hung in every corporate 
boardroom in America, plus posted in every post office, police precinct, 
government building, senior center and trauma clinic to remind us of what a 
genuine swine (no offense to hogs), who has personally generated agonizing 
lives among seniors and other savers fighting for economic survival, looks 
like. 
</P>
<P>
As a Lincoln bondholder, defrauded by my own bank, I suggest an immediate 
auction sale of Mrs. Keating's house, antiques, furnishings, jewelry, wardrobe, 
curios and other holdings, not to bail Charlie out, but to begin paying 15,000 
of us back now.

COLONIAL POWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Peril of Strange-Bedfellowship" by Cheryl Benard (Commentary, Oct. 15) was 
excellent reading. She has very nicely and justly sympathized with the 
villain's (Saddam Hussein) position. 
</P>
<P>
Truly, the colonial powers have divided the world to their advantage by 
artificially dividing countries. They did not care about the consequences to 
the local population. 
</P>
<P>
They punished a big country like Iraq by giving it only one port, Basra, while 
they rewarded the tiny Sabah family with immense oil wealth and good ports. 
Look at Malaysia and oil-rich Brunei! Whatever British Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher says about right and wrong, a lot of blood and atrocities could have 
been avoided if tiny Britain had not gone out to conquer the world. 
</P>
<P>
The atrocities that the British committed in India during their rule are 
unforgivable. Hundreds of thousand innocent people died during the partition of 
India and Pakistan. The same for Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
Now the British talk about democracy and justice! They forget the days when a 
tiny island like Britain made most of the world its slave.

INSURANCE POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with interest your editorial "How to Make a Financial Killing" (Oct. 8). 
Gang violence is a tragedy that touches us all. 
</P>
<P>
Your newspaper reports almost daily on the unfortunate problem and its toll. 
</P>
<P>
Your editorial makes many important points. In commenting on insurance 
salespeople who use (and abuse) the natural fears of people living in 
crime-torn neighborhoods to sell low-cost policies, you observe that the public 
should aim its disgust at the gang problem rather than a few "brazen insurance 
salesmen." I agree. 
</P>
<P>
However, as a representative of the life insurance industry, I decry the 
questionable and inappropriate marketing strategies which your editorial 
discusses. In fact, these insurance "salespeople" tarnish the reputations of 
the vast majority who are decent, ethical and hard-working. 
</P>
<P>
The life insurance industry takes its community responsibilities seriously. As 
corporate citizens, we are involved in the community and provide ongoing 
support for many activities, including those that serve the needs of urban 
areas.

MCGWIRE WON'T SEE HIS BIG BROTHER PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Quarterback Dan McGwire hoped to be in Oakland this weekend to watch his 
brother, Mark, 27, in the World Series, but things haven't worked out. 
</P>
<P>
Games 3, 4 and 5 are set for tonight, Saturday and Sunday, but the Aztecs are 
scheduled to practice Saturday afternoon. McGwire figures he would not be able 
to fly out of San Diego until sometime Saturday night, and then, since Sunday's 
World Series game is at night, he wouldn't return to San Diego until very late 
Sunday or Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to go Friday, Saturday and Sunday," McGwire said. "But since we have 
practice Saturday, I have to be with the team." 
</P>
<P>
He said he talked to Coach Al Luginbill about the practice schedule but didn't 
ask for Saturday off. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to push the issue," said McGwire, who has been to the World 
Series in each of the past two years. "A lot of people (on the team) would like 
the weekend off. You can't pinpoint one person. It's not fair to everyone 
else." 
</P>
<P>
CBS, the network televising the Series, called SDSU's sports information 
department earlier this week to inquire whether McGwire would be attending this 
weekend's games. They wanted to interview him in the stands during a game. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado won a game earlier this year with a touchdown on fifth down. Michigan 
State defeated then-No. 1 Michigan when the Wolverines failed on a two-point 
conversion attempt with six seconds left. Michigan believed there was pass 
interference on the play, and a couple of days later Coach Gary Moeller 
received a telephone call from Dave Parry, Big Ten supervisor of officials, who 
apologized for the officials' apparent error. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a bad year for officials, and Luginbill says college football 
should institute an instant replay system. 
</P>
<P>
"Too much goes into these games to allow human error," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill said he would even be willing to waste one of his own timeouts in a 
crucial game to have a key play reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't get enough competent officials in one area to service a game," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill wondered how it is that people who work at something once a week -- 
officials -- are given power in a game over people who do it every day -- 
coaches and players. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never understand how they can do that," he said. "But you know what? I 
don't have a thing to say about it." SCOTT MILLER

GLENN NOT EXPECTED TO PLAY SUNDAY

<P>
Starting free safety Vencie Glenn did not participate in practice Thursday, and 
Coach Dan Henning said he does not expect him to play on Sunday against the 
Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn pulled a hamstring in last week's 39-3 victory over the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I'll play Sunday," Glenn said, and then he jumped into the air to 
demonstrate how healthy he feels. "See?" 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers continue to list Glenn, tight end Arthur Cox (large toe), 
cornerback Donald Frank (fingers), guard David Richards (large toe) and 
cornerback Sam Seale (fingers) as questionable. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Glenn, the other players all practiced. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders downgraded defensive end Mike Wise from probable to questionable 
with an ankle injury, and continued to list linebacker Art Jimerson (neck) as 
doubtful, and running back Greg Bell (ankle) as questionable. 
</P>
<P>
Henning, while aware of strained feelings between Steve Ortmayer, the Chargers' 
former director of football operations, and the media corps, said with tongue 
planted firmly in cheek: "Just don't be calling Ort and telling him what we're 
doing now." 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't resist that," Henning said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer is now working as special teams coach for the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Kicker John Carney went to work Thursday inside San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium 
in preparation for the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
"They have new sod on the infield, and some of our return guys haven't had a 
chance to work in the stadium," Carney said. "This is our home stadium, so it 
makes sense to know it, and use it as an advantage." 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Cedric Figaro aggravated a hip injury in practice when he collided 
with linebacker Gary Plummer. Plummer, however, was working at fullback at the 
time, and was assigned blocking duties on Figaro. 
</P>
<P>
"When you hit a running back, at least they fall down," Figaro said. 
</P>
<P>
Free agent linebacker Richard Brown, who played collegiately at San Diego 
State, has been overwhelmed by his selection as team captain for the special 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm real honored and surprised," Brown said. "I didn't know these guys cared 
about me that much. I didn't know they acknowledged my performance out there as 
a special teams player. I'm real happy; I feel like I'm at home now." 
</P>
<P>
Tackle Broderick Thompson and safety Martin Bayless will also serve as team 
captains this season based on a vote of teammates. T.J. SIMERS

Tonight's game between No. 8 Kearny and La Jolla will not only showcase two 
teams that seem to have a lock on a Division 2-A playoff berth but will likely 
decide the City Western League championship. 
</P>
<P>
Both coaches, Willie Matson of Kearny and Dick Huddleston of La Jolla, are 
preoccupied with a different concern, because neither wants this potential 
title matchup, at 7 p.m. at Mesa College, to become "Watson vs. Scott, Part I."

<P>
Junior running back/safety E.J. Watson of La Jolla (5-1) and senior wide 
receiver/safety Darnay Scott of Kearny (5-1) -- two football players so 
dominant that they have almost single-handedly defeated some opponents -- have 
already exchanged verbal blows about tonight's showdown, albeit in good nature. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, both coaches have designed their respective game plans to stop 
Watson and Scott, who, ironically, are neighborhood friends. 
</P>
<P>
In a 20-0 La Jolla victory Sept. 29 over Hoover, Watson rushed for 205 yards in 
19 carries, caught two passes for 27 yards, intercepted a pass and scored all 
three of his team's touchdowns. The previous night, Scott scored four of 
Kearny's five touchdowns in a 35-15 victory over Serra. Three of his scores 
came on 38-, 51- and 21-yard passes from quarterback Sam Page. The fourth was a 
70-yard interception return. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after he moved to Clairemont from St. Louis in 1989, Scott met Watson. 
From that day, the two seemed destined to be friends off the field and rivals 
on it. Both wear No. 9, and four weeks into the season the two were tied for 
second in the county with nine touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla, despite scoring an average of 35 points a game, second-best in the 
county, is considered an underdog against Kearny, the defending Western League 
champion. But Kearny is coming off a 57-6 loss to No. 1 Morse. 
</P>
<P>
"This is definitely the big game of the year," Matson said. "The way La Jolla's 
been playing, this is it."

MOBIL AGREES TO SAFETY PACT WITH TORRANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what is being termed an unprecedented action, Mobil Oil Corp. has agreed to 
phase out or significantly modify the use of highly toxic hydrofluoric acid at 
its Torrance refinery as part of a far-reaching pretrial settlement of a 
lawsuit brought by the city. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement, which was filed in Superior Court on Thursday, also calls for a 
court-supervised adviser to monitor and make recommendations on a broad range 
of safety and environmental issues at the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil has agreed to stop using hydrofluoric acid at the refinery by the end of 
1997 unless it can develop a safer form of the chemi cal by the end of 1994. 
Hydrofluoric acid is used, in a process called alkylation, to boost the octane 
in unleaded gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement is being called unprecedented by city and Mobil officials as 
well as some industry observers, particularly because it involves a safety 
adviser who would have the authority to investigate conditions at the refinery 
and make recommendations that could be made binding on Mobil by the court. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Mayor Katy Geissert hailed the agreement as a landmark settlement. 
"The unusual situation, I think, is that you have one of the largest 
corporations in the world agreeing to sit down and arrive at some agreements," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Joel H. Maness, manager of the Torrance refinery, said, "From our viewpoint, 
we've got a first-class facility." But he noted that the city felt strongly 
about the importance of an independent adviser. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not aware of any refineries in the country having this," Maness said. And 
an American Petroleum Institute spokesman said he has never heard of a safety 
adviser overseeing a refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Industry sources also said they are unaware of any refinery being forced to 
move away from use of hydrofluoric acid because of community pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the legal battle with the city, Mobil had complained that the cost 
of converting the refinery from the use of hydrofluoric acid would be 
prohibitive. Officials estimate it would cost $100 million to use sulfuric acid 
instead, the only existing alternative process. 
</P>
<P>
When asked why Mobil is now prepared to take on a project earlier deemed too 
expensive, a Mobil spokesman cited a press statement issued Thursday by Maness 
stating that Mobil has agree to "this unprecedented . . . phase-out in order to 
address the concerns of its neighbors and to resolve the dispute with the city 
of Torrance." 
</P>
<P>
Mobil also said Thursday it already has spent $25 million researching other 
alternatives, including additives to make hydrofluoric acid less hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
The refinery produces 12% of the gasoline used in Southern California. A Mobil 
spokesman said it is "highly unlikely" that the conversion will effect the 
price of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
The city filed suit against Mobil in April, 1989, after a series of accidents, 
deaths and injuries at the Torrance plant raised concerns about the refinery's 
safety. None of the deaths were caused by hydrofluoric acid. However, a major 
accident in November, 1987, that injured 10 people was caused by an overflow of 
the toxic chemical. 
</P>
<P>
Attention focused on hydrofluoric acid in 1986, after industry-sponsored tests 
showed that a leak of 1,000 gallons of hydrofluoric acid could be lethal as far 
as five miles downwind. Mobil typically has an estimated 29,000 gallons of the 
acid at the plant, officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
Hydrofluoric acid is used at 60 refineries in the United States, including four 
in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The situation in Torrance is unusual because many people live near the 
refinery, community concern about the chemical has been heightened and the 
lawsuit was pending, Maness said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a unique situation we do not have in the other communities," Maness 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of another community situation like this in the country," added 
Del Persinger, senior refining associate at the American Petroleum Institute in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The safety adviser would be selected by Mobil and Torrance, or named by the 
judge overseeing the settlement if the two sides cannot agree on a suitable 
consulting firm. The adviser would have to approve any modified hydrofluoric 
acid process proposed by Mobil and would have authority to investigate a wide 
range of safety, environmental, seismic and emergency questions at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Recommendations made by the adviser can be enforced by the court. Retired 
Superior Court Judge Harry V. Peetris, who guided the settlement talks, will 
oversee the consent decree. 
</P>
<P>
All costs of the safety adviser would be borne by Mobil. 
</P>
<P>
The safety adviser is a potential "weak link," depending on who is chosen, said 
David Roe, senior attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"The settlement guarantees risk reduction as long as you get the right safety 
adviser," Roe said. But he called the agreement significant. "I would hope 
someone would take this settlement and knock on the door of every other 
refinery in the state and say, 'Why can't you do this, too?' " 
</P>
<P>
Torrance City Council members praised the agreement, saying it accomplishes 
what they hoped the lawsuit would do. 
</P>
<P>
"After today, things will never be the same because refineries and people who 
deal with things that hurt the general population will know that just because 
they're big, or rich, or whatever, their first concern has got to be the health 
and safety of the community," said Councilman Dan Walker, who spearheaded an 
unsuccessful March referendum to force Mobil to stop using hydrofluoric acid in 
Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides predict that the settlement -- reached less than three weeks before 
the trial was scheduled to start Nov. 5 -- will ease the long-running tensions 
between Los Angeles County's fourth-largest city and Mobil, Torrance's largest 
taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
But in other quarters the reaction to the settlement was cautious -- and in 
some cases skeptical. Officials with the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District generally welcomed the settlement but said they have questions about 
the feasibility of modifying hydrofluoric acid. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD in December is scheduled to consider a phase-out of hydrofluoric acid 
at the four oil refineries and a refrigerant manufacturing plant in Los Angeles 
County. AQMD officials said Thursday that the Mobil settlement would not affect 
the agency's consideration of the proposed ban. 
</P>
<P>
The consent decree calls for Mobil to phase out the use of hydrofluoric acid in 
Torrance by Dec. 31, 1997. But the oil company may continue to use the acid 
after 1997 if it commits to a modified hydrofluoric catalyst process by Dec. 
31, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Although many refineries use less volatile sulfuric acid instead of 
hydrofluoric acid, Mobil has resisted switching to a sulfuric acid system, 
citing the cost. 
</P>
<P>
The city's suit, which maintained that Mobil is operating the refinery in a 
"callous and indifferent" fashion, sought to have the court declare the 
facility a public nuisance and grant the city authority to regulate it. 
</P>
<P>
The huge explosion that rocked the refinery in November, 1987, set off a 
17-hour fire and prompted the release of about 100 gallons of hydrofluoric 
acid. 
</P>
<P>
The city lawsuit contended, and Mobil later admitted, that human error caused 
the 1987 explosion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The city of Torrance filed suit against Mobil after a series of accidents at 
the Torrance refinery that raised safety concerns. Three people, including a 
passing motorist, were killed in 1979 when a large cloud of butane gas exploded 
after drifting from the refinery's tank farm. An explosion and two-day fire in 
November, 1987, injured 10 people. About 100 pounds of hydrofluoric acid were 
released in the fire. Scientists say a 1,000-gallon spill of hydrofluoric acid 
could produce a toxic cloud lethal within a range of five miles. Mobil 
typically has an estimated 29,000 gallons of the acid at the plant.

ENERGY COSTS PUSH CONSUMER PRICES UP 0.8% 
</P>

<P>
Soaring energy prices following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait pushed consumer 
prices 0.8% higher in September and boosted the nation's foreign trade deficit 
to its highest level in seven months, the government reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
While the one-two punch had been widely expected by economists, the combination 
of figures underscored the continuing problems facing an economy already 
teetering on the brink of recession. 
</P>
<P>
September's increase in the consumer price index marked the second month in a 
row that inflation has increased 0.8%, which represents an annual rate of 9.5%. 
Inflation hit an annual rate of 6.6% during the first nine months of the year, 
compared to 4.6% for all of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. trade deficit climbed to $9.34 billion in August, a 2.4% 
increase from July's $9.12 billion. The cost of imports, inflated by higher 
crude oil prices, reached a record $42 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew most of this was coming, and most of it was oil," said economist David 
Wyss of DRI/McGraw Hill, a Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm. "We knew all 
about energy in the consumer prices, because we all filled our gas tanks last 
month. And the OPEC (oil) bill more than offset the improvement in the rest of 
U.S. trade." 
</P>
<P>
The stock market, which already had come to terms with the inflationary impact 
of the Persian Gulf crisis, shrugged off Thursday's reports and had a sharp 
gain. 
</P>
<P>
The reports made clear, however, that oil price inflation will continue to 
distort consumer prices for the rest of the year and that a soaring oil import 
bill is likely to push the monthly trade deficits above $10 billion in future 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
September's increase in consumer prices was primarily attributable to higher 
energy costs, with gasoline gaining 9.5% for the month and fuel oil soaring 
13.2%. Since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, world oil prices have more than 
doubled. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the sharply higher energy costs recorded by the Labor Department's 
consumer price index, there was virtually no sign of the ricochet effect of 
higher oil prices in other parts of the economy. Economists said that those 
impacts are likely to be felt in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
The separate trade report issued by the Commerce Department showed that the 
nation's trade deficit with members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries jumped by $600 million in August. 
</P>
<P>
The increase was attributable entirely to higher prices, with the nation 
actually importing 28 million fewer barrels of oil in August than in July. 
August imports were purchased at an average price of $19.54 per barrel, barely 
half the level of recent spot prices but a higher average than in previous 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could have held down the cost of energy, this report would not have been 
bad," said Donald Ratajczak, an inflation specialist at Georgia State 
University in Atlanta. "But that price increase is so huge, people can't avoid 
it. The 9.5% jump in gasoline would be a hefty increase in a year, and people 
are using all their spare cash at filling stations." 
</P>
<P>
That trend, in turn, could accelerate the present economic downturn, as higher 
pump prices leave consumers with less money to spend on other goods. At the 
same time, however, it could help control inflation later on. 
</P>
<P>
"So far the weakness in the economy has not permited the higher price of oil to 
spread to other sectors," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at 
Manufacturers Hanover in New York. "I think we can expect the rate of inflation 
to settle down fairly quickly, just as it did earlier this year after the price 
of energy shot up in January because of the cold winter." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there were some signs of encouragement in the report. Excluding energy 
and food prices, the core rate of retail price inflation was a manageable 0.3%, 
down from 0.5% in August. 
</P>
<P>
The energy picture aside, other factors in the consumer price picture last 
month were normal for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Apparel prices jumped 0.7% for the month, pushed largely by a 1.5% surge in the 
cost of women's clothing as new fall lines hit retail stores. Those increases 
are invariably balanced by large discounts a few months later. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of shelter, excluding a 1.2% increase for fuel and utilities, rose a 
moderate 0.3% after much larger increases in July and August caused by summer 
increases in hotel room rates and the once-a-year impact of higher property tax 
rates and assessments. 
</P>
<P>
Medical costs rose 0.7%, about the monthly average for the year. But the cost 
of all services, up 0.7% in August, rose a more manageable 0.4%, and the retail 
price of durable goods -- which explicitly excludes all fuels -- was unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim metropolitan area, consumer prices rose 
0.5% before seasonal adjustment, compared to 0.9% nationwide. In August retail 
prices in the metropolitan region rose a full 1%. 
</P>
<P>
Before seasonal adjustment, the consumer price index rose 1.2 points to 131.1, 
from a base of 100 set in 1982-1984. That means that the cost of a hypothetical 
cross-section of consumer goods and services that cost $100 in the base period 
would have cost $131.10 in September. 
</P>
<P>
In the August trade report, exports increased $500 million to $32.6 billion, 
while imports rose $700 million to $42 billion. Oil imports were up $800 
million, a gain that was only marginally offset by smaller imports of capital 
and consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
The perennial trade deficit with Japan widened to $3.8 billion from $3 billion 
in July, but for the year it was running at only $26.3 billion through August, 
compared to $32.4 billion at the same point in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit with the European Community was $236 million in August, down 
from $997 million the previous month. The United States is running a surplus 
with the European Community this year totaling $4.1 billion through August, 
compared to a deficit of $1.5 billion in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"The trade deficits will certainly worsen in coming months as the impact of 
higher oil prices hits," said economist Allen Sinai of the Boston Co. "But it's 
encouraging to see exports stronger. Trade overall should keep showing an 
improvement, exclusive of oil, and exports remains a bright spot in our 
economy."

BUDGET: THE PACKAGE IS ENDORSED BY THE PRESIDENT BUT MUST BE RECONCILED WITH A 
SPENDING MEASURE PASSED BY THE HOUSE. BUSH WILL SIGN A STOPGAP SPENDING BILL.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate early Friday approved a $500-billion deficit-cutting package 
endorsed by President Bush and moved toward negotiations with the House on a 
new compromise plan as a threatened weekend shutdown of the federal government 
was averted. 
</P>
<P>
Prodded by Republican and Democratic leaders, the Senate voted, 54 to 46, for 
the legislation, which -- like a rival plan passed earlier by the House -- 
calls for the largest combination of spending cuts and tax increases ever 
adopted. 
</P>
<P>
California's senators split on the measure, with Democrat Alan Cranston voting 
in favor and Pete Wilson voting no. Overall, 32 Democrats and 22 Republicans 
voted for the measure while 23 Democrats and 23 Republicans voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the White House had sent word to Capitol Hill that the President would 
sign a stopgap resolution to continue federal spending through Wednesday while 
the lawmakers concluded their deliberations. The House subsequently approved 
such a bill by a vote of 379 to 37. 
</P>
<P>
Senate approval of the budget measure brings what may be the final stage of the 
5-month-old effort to reach an agreement between the Bush Administration and 
the Democrat-controlled Congress on slashing the federal deficit. The Senate 
and House budget plans now go to a conference committee that will try to hammer 
out an agreement that can be ratified by both chambers and then signed into law 
by President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Bush renewed his warning that he would not accept the Democratic bill 
passed by the House because, he said, it would raise income tax rates in ways 
that would "sock it to the middle class and working people of this country." 
</P>
<P>
Appearing before a group of White House interns, Bush defended himself against 
Democratic arguments that he was trying to protect the wealthiest Americans by 
resisting tax rate boosts. 
</P>
<P>
"When tax rates get too high . . . there is no incentive to save or to invest," 
the President said. "When some members of Congress talk about 'soaking the 
rich,' they really do mean raising taxes on everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Democratic and Republican leaders of the Senate successfully stiff-armed 
attempts to alter the Senate legislation during daylong debate Friday on the 
unprecedented election year combination of spending cuts and tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
The bipartisan bill would raise gasoline taxes by 9.5 cents a gallon, limit 
deductions by 5% for those making more than $100,000 a year and apply the 1.45% 
health insurance payroll tax to the first $89,000 of earnings each year instead 
of the $51,300 ceiling now in effect. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the House-approved plan would raise the top tax rate to 33%, 
impose a 10% surtax on taxable income of more than $1 million and raise almost 
everyone's taxes by a one-year delay in inflation adjustments of tax brackets 
and personal exemptions. It also contains a reduction in capital gains tax 
rates designed mainly for people with incomes of less than $100,000 a year but 
would retain federal gasoline taxes at the current 9 cents a gallon. Both bills 
would raise taxes on beer, wine, hard liquor and cigarettes and impose a luxury 
tax on the most expensive cars, yachts, private planes, furs and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
They also would make a wide variety of spending reductions for farm subsidies, 
veterans' benefits, federal lump-sum retirement payments and other government 
services, while raising dozens of user fees and penalties for violations of 
federal laws. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate rejected several attempts to raise top-bracket rates, soften the 
impact of Medicare cuts on the elderly and enact a 10% surtax on millionaires. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), who said he agreed with many 
of the proposals, argued that their passage would lead to a Bush veto of the 
legislation and therefore should be defeated to avoid a continued deadlock 
between Congress and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), chairman of the Finance Committee, said he 
personally favors an increase in top tax rates but he strongly opposed efforts 
to revise the bill, which his committee had approved by a 15-5 bipartisan vote. 
</P>
<P>
But Bentsen indicated that he would seek during the Senate-House bargaining to 
place a greater burden on the wealthy than the Senate bill provides. 
</P>
<P>
"Let us go to conference and pick the best of each" of the Senate and House 
bills," and put together a package that Democrats and Republicans can get 
behind," Bentsen said. "That has to mean an increase in progressivity as far as 
I am concerned -- it will be the objective." 
</P>
<P>
The Senate narrowly rejected, 51 to 49, an attempt to adopt the House-passed 
"millionaires' surtax" and use the revenue to eliminate a proposed increase in 
the deductible for doctor bills paid by Medicare beneficiaries. Under the rules 
for consideration of the budget act, however, it would have required 60 votes 
to pass the amendment introduced by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa). 
</P>
<P>
Another plan to raise the top tax rate to 33%, cut the proposed gas tax 
increase to 6 cents a gallon and soften the bill's impact on Medicare patients 
was rejected, 55 to 45. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. David L. Boren (D-Okla.) tried but failed, 57 to 42, to include a 
trade-off between lower capital gains rates for long-held assets and an 
increase to 33% in the top income tax rate. 
</P>
<P>
On each of the so-called deal busters, Mitchell, Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.) and their lieutenants combined forces to block major changes in the 
committee package. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to get this job done," Mitchell thundered at one point. "Do we want 
to make a statement or do we want to make a law?" 
</P>
<P>
Each senator had a foot-high copy of the 1,064-page budget reconciliation bill 
on his desk. The debate began in midmorning and continued into the early hours 
today on what for the Senate was an extremely fast track. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the Senate bill would cut the deficit by $28.4 billion in this fiscal 
year and by $252.5 billion over the next five years. Additional cuts in 
appropriations, mainly for defense, would trim red-ink spending by another $12 
billion in the next year and by $180 billion between now and 1995. Savings in 
interest payments on the debt would make up the balance of the $500-billion 
package. 
</P>
<P>
Without the continuing resolution approved by the House and expected to be 
approved by the Senate and signed by Bush today, massive spending cuts of $85.3 
billion would be imposed Saturday.

<P>
IMPACT ON FOOD IF 'BIG GREEN' PASSES DEBATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A California ballot measure that would phase out the use of at least 25 
pesticides -- and potentially ban more than twice that number -- could force 
major changes in the way food is grown around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which will appear on the Nov. 6 ballot as Proposition 128, would 
ban pesticides that cause cancer or birth defects if the chemicals are used on 
food. Produce and other food commodities from outside the state could not be 
sold in California if they were grown with these pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
The rules are among the most controversial provisions of Proposition 128, the 
environmental initiative known by its backers as "Big Green," because they ban 
pesticides even if they contain only trace levels of carcinogens or 
reproductive toxins. 
</P>
<P>
No one is certain how many chemicals eventually might be lost to agriculture 
because many have not been fully tested or analyzed. Clouding the picture even 
more are widely different interpretations of the initiative by the 
environmentalists who wrote it and the California Department of Food and 
Agriculture. If the measure is passed, the agency stands to lose some of its 
responsibilities for pesticide regulation to the California Department of 
Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an ironic campaign by Food and Ag to make this initiative even more 
far reaching than it is," said Al Meyerhoff, a senior attorney for the Natural 
Resources Defense Council, an environmental group sponsoring the initiative. "I 
know that once this passes . . . they will reverse direction 180 degrees and 
claim that the initiative doesn't include anything." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Wells, an assistant chief of the department's pest management division, 
said Meyerhoff is "desperate." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the proponents -- when they saw what the impact was -- realized it 
would frighten people, and are trying to back away from it and say, 'No, no no, 
it won't cover that.' " 
</P>
<P>
But even under the most narrow interpretation, the pesticide provisions would 
be far-reaching. 
</P>
<P>
"You are essentially dictating to other states how they can and can't use 
pesticides," said Jack Moore, a former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
assistant administrator and president of the Irvine-based Institute for 
Evaluating Health Risks. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters and opponents predict the initiative would spark renewed efforts in 
Congress to curtail states' rights on pesticide regulation. Congress has failed 
to muster enough votes to prohibit states from enacting tougher regulations 
than those set by the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
But Moore said he believes the initiative would spur Congress to limit states' 
rights, "or if not, it would be a close vote." Moore's nonprofit institute, 
established a year ago, attempts to determine the potential health effects of 
chemicals for government and industry clients. 
</P>
<P>
Out-of-state farmers who used banned pesticides would have to discontinue them, 
set up a separate production system for California, stop selling in the state 
or continue to use the chemicals and hope that residues could not be detected. 
</P>
<P>
Among the chemicals the initiative would phase out is a herbicide called 
alachlor, the most widely used pesticide in the nation, according to the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA says consumers have about a one-in-a-million risk of getting cancer 
from consuming food treated with the chemical -- a risk so small that many 
contend it is insignificant. Environmental groups counter that alachlor, which 
has been banned in Canada, is a major pollutant of ground water in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
Even Proposition 135, a counter initiative largely intended to preserve the 
status quo and head off the environmentalists, would reach beyond California, 
according to Moore and the Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
That initiative, backed by growers, would substantially increase the amount of 
food tested by the department for pesticide residues. The produce could not be 
sold if it contained residues of chemicals not permitted in California. State 
officials say farmers in other states use a handful of pesticides now 
prohibited for food use in California. Foreign countries use about a dozen such 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 135 also would set up a governor-appointed science advisory panel 
to advise the department on what it considers safe levels of pesticide use and 
repeal $1.5 million in licensing fees paid by produce dealers and food 
processors. The general fund would have to make up that revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Production of sterile Mediterranean fruit flies would be doubled to reduce 
future aerial pesticide spraying in urban communities and $25 million would be 
provided for research into pesticide alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
But the measure still would allow the Department of Food and Agriculture, which 
many critics contend places the needs of farmers over public health, to 
continue to call most of the shots on pesticide regulation in California. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see the (farmers) initiative as so much changing the way things are 
being done," said Moore, who is familiar with both measures. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 128 is far more sweeping. 
</P>
<P>
It bans 25 pesticides outright. That number will climb as studies required by 
the initiative discover more products that contain carcinogens or reproductive 
toxins. Manufacturers also may decide to abandon some products rather than 
spend the money for testing. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA, which regulates pesticides for the nation, now allows farmers to use 
most of these pesticides but has placed some under special review to determine 
whether they should be restricted further because of potential health hazards. 
</P>
<P>
In allowing use of the pesticides, the agency has determined that the benefits 
exceed the risks. The EPA says the risks are low because consumers are exposed 
to only small amounts of the substances. 
</P>
<P>
"Under Big Green, there is no safe dose," Moore said. "If it is listed as 
causing cancer or birth defects, it's gone." 
</P>
<P>
In California, six of the 25 pesticides specifically targeted by the initiative 
already are not used on food in California, according to state agricultural 
officials. Those six include one that is no longer permitted on food grown in 
the United States and another that is no longer manufactured. 
</P>
<P>
According to agricultural researchers at the University of California, there 
are substitutes, albeit potentially more costly and less effective, for most of 
the other pesticides used on California crops. 
</P>
<P>
There are no identified alternatives for several fungicides needed to combat 
diseases on dozens of crops, the researchers say, or for an insecticide now 
applied to eight crops that make up only a small share of the state's 
agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
"The impact (from the loss of the targeted pesticides) is not going to be as 
big as the farm groups say, but it's not going to be nothing either," said 
Frank Zalom, director of the statewide integrated pest management project for 
the University of California. 
</P>
<P>
"Individual growers are going to have problems with it "but it's really 
difficult to say (what will happen) across the whole ag industry." 
</P>
<P>
Experts agree that the loss of fungicides -- chemicals used to kill 
fungus-caused diseases -- would hit agriculture hardest. 
</P>
<P>
"In the U.S., some crops can't be grown in certain areas without severe fungus 
problems," said William Jordan, chief of policy staff in the EPA's pesticide 
program. "I think the list of available substitutes is very small, if there are 
any." 
</P>
<P>
The initiative would give farmers in most cases five to eight years to shift to 
other chemicals or alternate farming practices if no substitute is available. 
Twenty-million dollars would be spent on research to develop alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Government pesticide regulators argue that five to eight years may not be 
enough time to develop, test and register substitutes for use. Representatives 
of environmental groups counter that the federal government has previously 
yanked pesticides off the market with almost no notice. The supporters also 
contend that Proposition 128 will not catch pesticide manufacturers off guard. 
</P>
<P>
"The initiative is not an immediate and total ban," said Meyerhoff of the 
Natural Resources Defense Council. "And the writing has been on the wall for 
years that the days for most of these products are numbered." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest dispute over the potential impact of "Big Green" revolves around 
the number of chemicals it would actually prohibit. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents, who argue that Proposition 128 would raise food prices, speculate 
that the initiative could phase out hundreds of pesticides and warn that 
alternatives, even if they do not cause cancer or birth defects, could pose 
other significant health hazards. 
</P>
<P>
Meyerhoff argues that no more than 50 pesticides would be phased out over the 
next 10 to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Of major concern to farmers is how many pesticides would be banned by a 
provision that prohibits potentially harmful substances that are unavoidably 
added to the pesticide during manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Wells, the Department of Food and Agriculture official, said he cannot 
estimate the loss under that provision. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how many (such cases) we have out there," he said, "and we don't 
have any way of knowing unless we looked at all the formulations in depth and 
did some analyses." 
</P>
<P>
Such uncertainty unnerves farmers, who fear the loss of many of their tools, 
and aggravates environmentalists, who distrust government's ability to ensure a 
safe food supply. It is exacerbated by conflicting interpretations of which 
pesticides would be covered by the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Nelson, president of California Citrus Mutual, a citrus producers trade 
association, argues, for example, that "Big Green" will disrupt pest management 
practices designed to reduce reliance on pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, who is campaigning for the farmers' initiative, said citrus growers 
spread an oil-based product on the leaves of citrus trees to smother the eggs 
of a pest before hatching. Because a contaminant of the oil is benzene, which 
causes cancer, the product would be phased out by Proposition 128, according to 
Nelson and officials at the Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrie Mott, a senior scientist for the Natural Resources Defense Council, 
disagrees. She said the product would not be banned because oil is not 
considered a pesticide by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
The most drastic scenarios for the initiative's impact are based on 
misinterpretations, Mott and other sponsors contend. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Department of Food and Agriculture says it interprets one provision 
as possibly banning as much as 65% of all pesticides. State agricultural 
officials also insist the measure would phase out some insecticides used in the 
home and on pets; the sponsors say it only applies to pesticides when they are 
used to grow food. 
</P>
<P>
But even among the sponsors, there is occasional confusion about just what the 
initiative would do. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Department of Food and Agriculture, at least one formulation 
of malathion, a pesticide that is most widely known for its use against the 
Mediterranean fruit fly, could be banned because it contains heavy metals. 
</P>
<P>
"If this initiative will ban malathion, that's the best news I have heard in 
weeks," said Meyerhoff, the defense council's attorney. "But it's incorrect." 
</P>
<P>
Mott contradicts her colleague. If the formulation of malathion containing 
heavy metals were used on food, it would be subject to a five- to eight-year 
phase-out, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Veda Federighi, a spokeswoman for the Department of Food and Agriculture, notes 
that unless the initiative is passed and regulations adopted, its impact will 
remain uncertain. Proponents argue that their intent will shape how the final 
rules are developed. 
</P>
<P>
"Like everything else," Federighi said, "it depends on how the regulations are 
written to implement it."

SMITH ASKS FOE TO TELL EXTENT OF HIS TIES TO S&amp;LS

<P>
Standing outside a Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan branch office in West Los 
Angeles, Democratic state attorney general candidate Arlo Smith demanded 
Thursday that his Republican foe, former Rep. Dan Lungren, explain the extent 
of his ties to figures involved in the massive national S&amp;L scandal. 
</P>
<P>
"How can you (Lungren) be trusted to oversee the criminal investigation of the 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan targets when those very targets are your political 
patrons?" asked the San Francisco district attorney at the afternoon press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's statements came on the heels of the disclosure this week of a 1986 
letter addressed to the nation's top thrift regulator requesting secret records 
concerning controversial investment practices by S&amp;Ls. The letter was 
signed by 16 Republican congressmen, including Lungren. Edwin Gray, former 
Federal Home Loan Bank Board chairman, said in interviews this week that the 
letter appeared to have been a poorly disguised attempt to pass confidential 
information to the Orange County-based Lincoln thrift about possible federal 
actions to tighten controls over it. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln owner Charles H. Keating Jr. is awaiting trial on securities fraud 
charges in connection with the sale of junk bonds through the now-bankrupt 
institution, whose failure could cost taxpayers more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Gray said Thursday that he believed that Rep. Charles Pashayan (R-Fresno) 
prepared the letter and then asked other congressmen, including Lungren, Robert 
K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale) and now-Secretary 
of Defense Dick Cheney, to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
These other congressmen, he said, "allowed themselves to be duped and used by 
people like Charlie Keating." 
</P>
<P>
"If there's one thing people ought to learn back (in Washington), it's that 
they should know what they sign and who they do favors for and look twice at 
what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
In his press conference, Smith also criticized Lungren for taking campaign 
contributions from Lincoln's lawyers, who are now under investigation, as well 
as a $500 contribution from Lincoln's parent company, American Continental 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The American Continental contribution was made to Lungren's litigation fund in 
1988 after the state Senate rejected his selection to the post of state 
treasurer by Gov. George Deukmejian after the death of Jesse Unruh. At the 
time, Lungren was unsuccessfully seeking to persuade the State Supreme Court to 
overturn the Senate's vote. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren's current campaign has received the maximum personal contribution of 
$2,000 from GOP fund-raiser Karl M. Samuelian and another $1,350 from former 
state commissioner of corporations Franklin Tom. The two attorneys are partners 
in the Los Angeles law firm Parker, Milliken, Clark, O'Hara &amp; Samuelian, 
which recently agreed to pay up to $14.3 million to settle class-action 
lawsuits filed against it by 22,000 individuals who bought junk bonds, now 
worthless, from Lincoln Savings. 
</P>
<P>
Tom and Samuelian are both under investigation by the Sacramento County 
district attorney's office in a state probe of the Lincoln Savings scandal, 
according to Albert Locher, Sacramento County's chief deputy district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"California deserves an attorney general who has the integrity and the guts to 
take on the savings and loans and the other special interests," said Smith at 
his press conference. "Not an attorney general who will do their bidding." 
</P>
<P>
Lungren, in a telephone interview, said Thursday that he didn't even remember 
signing the letter to Gray, but assumed he may have done so at Pashayan's 
request. 
</P>
<P>
"We must have been on the (House) floor for some other purpose," said Lungren, 
"and Chip (Pashayan) was going around to California (congressmen) saying he 
needed help." 
</P>
<P>
Lungren pointed out that the letter contained no red flags since it did not 
specifically mention Lincoln Savings. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren also said he was not aware of the American Continental contribution to 
his 1988 legal fund until it was pointed out to him Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
He added that he saw no problem accepting contributions from Samuelian or Tom. 
Nor does he see a problem in having had Samuelian serve as a co-chairman of a 
$250-a-plate Lungren fund-raiser at the Bonaventure Hotel earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel they have the presumption of innocence. They have the same presumption 
of innocence as anyone else does," Lungren said. "I don't see anything 
ethically wrong. Karl Samuelian never asked anything of me. Karl Samuelian has 
given a lot of time to our party on the state level and on the national level. 
He's given a lot of his time to Ronald Reagan, George Bush and George 
Deukmejian."

ANTI-SMOKING SCIENTIST DROPPED FROM EPA PANEL; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: THE UC SAN DIEGO PROFESSOR HAS BEEN OUTSPOKEN ON CIGARETTE PERILS. THE 
TOBACCO INSTITUTE AND A VIRGINIA CONGRESSMAN URGED THAT HE BE REMOVED. 
</P>

<P>
At the urging of the Tobacco Institute and a Virginia congressman, a nationally 
acclaimed scientist from UC San Diego has been removed from an Environmental 
Protection Agency panel reviewing the effects of secondhand cigarette smoke. 
</P>
<P>
The scientist, Dr. David M. Burns, an associate clinical professor of medicine 
and a pulmonary specialist at UC San Diego Medical Center, has a been outspoken 
about the perils of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anything like this," said Steven Bayard, manager of the EPA 
project to assess the health risks of passive smoking. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disturbed about this," Bayard said Thursday. "I think it shows undue 
pressure, personally, from the tobacco companies and the Congress." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Donald Barnes, head of the EPA's Scientific Advisory Board, maintained that 
there was no undue pressure to remove Burns, who was praised by EPA staffers 
and others. 
</P>
<P>
Burns said he believes the tobacco industry is frightened about the quality of 
the two scientific reports on secondhand smoke that the panel was asked to 
review. The EPA reports, which analyze the effects of passive cigarette smoke 
on adults, children and people in the workplace, are scientifically solid, 
Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1970s, Burns, 43, has served as a senior editor and reviewer of 
the surgeon general's smoking reports. Former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett 
Koop presented Burns the prestigious Surgeon General's Medallion. 
</P>
<P>
Burns' fervent anti-smoking views and citing of scientific evidence have made 
him enemies in the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
Burns said he was asked by the EPA to serve on the panel in July, a fact 
confirmed in an Aug. 10 letter from the agency asking him to analyze the 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes, a former EPA staff scientist, told both Burns and The Times that while 
Burns has not technically been removed from the panel -- because the group does 
not yet officially exist -- the scientist will not serve on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes acknowledged that tobacco industry representatives came to see him two 
or three times to object to Burns. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan Dawson, a Tobacco Institute spokeswoman, told the Associated Press: "We 
want a fair panel that will look at it objectively. Our concern is that Mr. 
Burns is unable to do that." 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 18, Rep. Thomas Bliley (D-Va.) wrote the EPA without mentioning Burns 
by name but urging that the panel "consist of qualified individuals who have 
not already prejudged this issue in any manner." 
</P>

DAMAGE MINOR AS 4.0 QUAKE SHAKES UP ORANGE COUNTY

<P>
A moderate earthquake gave Orange County a sharp kick Thursday, driving 
students andteachers from their classrooms, shattering some windows and tossing 
ceramics from shelves at a crafts exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
The 10:21 a.m. quake, which measured magnitude 4.0, caused no injuries and only 
minordamage. The epicenter was near the Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa 
Mesa, according toseismologists at Caltech. Costa Mesa, Newport Beach and Santa 
Ana felt the quake most strongly, although residents from South Orange County 
to Long Beach also reported feeling the shaking. 
</P>
<P>
"It hit like a solid punch," said John Farmer, chief of campus security at 
Orange Coast College, near the quake's epicenter. "The ground started to roll a 
little so you knew it was coming, then it was a big jolt and the building shook 
for a while." 
</P>
<P>
About 150 students and staff members were evacuated from the four-story library 
at the college, but they were allowed back in shortly after inspectors 
determined it was undamaged. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals had no reports of injuries, and police and fire officials said they 
received only a few calls from residents. 
</P>
<P>
State Department of Transportation officials said work crews found no damage to 
roads, bridges or overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
Students and office workers "ducked and covered" when the earth began to move. 
Dawn Holst of New York City was participating in a computer software conference 
at the Marriott Hotel in Fashion Island when she felt the jolt. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I thought it was a subway going underneath me, and then I realized I 
wasn't in New York," she said. "I thought, 'Oh, my God, it's an earthquake.' " 
</P>
<P>
Roy Marquez was washing windows at an automobile dealership in Costa Mesa when 
the quake shattered three large windows and cracked a fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just starting on the third one when it hit," said Marquez, 26. "I 
thought I had broke it." 
</P>
<P>
When the quake hit, storekeepers and others at South Coast Plaza kept their 
eyes on a Rolls-Royce precariously balanced on four china teacups -- part of an 
exhibit for a British cultural festival being held at the mall. The car did not 
budge. 
</P>
<P>
But artisans at a British crafts exhibit at the mall did not fare as well. 
Expensive glassware, delicate ceramic works and pottery were knocked to the 
floor. Damage will probably top several thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The quake occurred in the Newport-Inglewood fault zone. The largest fault in 
the zone stretches from Beverly Hills to Newport Beach and then veers offshore. 
It is believed capable of a 6.5 quake, causing heavy damage. The last 
significant temblor occurred April 7, 1989, when a 4.6-magnitude quake centered 
in Newport Beach caused widespread but minor damage. 
</P>
<P>
An unrelated magnitude 2.4 temblor struck the Silver Lake District of Los 
Angeles at 8:52 p.m. Thursday. There were no damage or injury reports.

With its oil exports frozen by a U.N. trade embargo, Iraq tried to woo 
customers Thursday by offering oil at bargain prices, but traders greeted 
Baghdad's offer with skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
Oil Minister Issam Abdul-Rahim Chalabi said that Iraq would sell its oil to any 
buyer at $21 a barrel and pledged not to touch the money until the Persian Gulf 
crisis is over. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way anybody can get a single drop of oil from Iraq," a gulf-based

A DAILY BRIEFING PAPER ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CRISIS

<P>
Diplomatic Front: 
</P>
<P>
President Bush will confer today with Soviet envoy Yevgeny Primakov, who has 
met in recent days with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and French President 
Francois Mitterrand. 
</P>
<P>
In Vienna, French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas and Soviet Foreign Minister 
Eduard A. Shevardnadze said that sanctions against Iraq should be given more 
time to take effect. 
</P>
<P>
Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
A majority of Europeans in a recent Gallup poll supported military action if 
sanctions fail to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. The margin of support was 
86% in Britain, 75% in France, 66% in Spain, 63% in Germany and 59% in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi diplomats in Washington acknowledged that occupying troops had committed 
"isolated" abuses in Kuwait, but they said Western reports of widespread 
atrocities were unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
Economic Front: 
</P>
<P>
Iraq said it would be willing to sell crude oil for $21 a barrel, about half 
the prevailing market price, with the payments to be placed in a U.N. escrow 
fund pending resolution of the gulf crisis.

U.N. READIES DEMAND FOR DAMAGES FROM IRAQ; 
</P>
<P>
GULF CRISIS: THE SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION WOULD BENEFIT COUNTRIES HARMED BY 
KUWAIT INVASION.

<P>
The five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council have reached 
general agreement on a resolution demanding that Iraq pay other countries for 
damages suffered by its invasion of Kuwait, diplomats said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Final wording was being polished in Washington and other capitals before the 
draft resolution is presented to the 10 other members of the council. 
</P>
<P>
The measure also would call on Iraq to allow the resupply of Western embassies 
in Kuwait city and ask U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar to gather 
information on the mistreatment of citizens and foreigners living in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the draft resolution asks that governments supply data on behalf 
of citizens who have suffered financial losses because of the invasion. But the 
precise means of assessing Iraq for such damages has not been spelled out. 
</P>
<P>
"It is designed to help keep up the pressure," said one diplomat from a 
nonaligned nation with Security Council status who is familiar with the 
resolution worked out among the United States, Britain, China, the Soviet Union 
and France. 
</P>
<P>
Several nations have suffered major economic losses because of the seizure of 
Kuwait, including Jordan, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. 
</P>
<P>
The precise wording of the new resolution was still being worked out late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't even completely OKd by the United States," said one member of the 
Yemen delegation who had seen a draft. "I think the United States has some 
revisions." 
</P>
<P>
He said that although the United States was preparing to try to push for a 
quick consensus in the council, the process among nonaligned council members 
could take time. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we will work on the weekend. There is nothing serious," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the draft resolution, President Saddam Hussein's government would 
not be responsible for punitive damages, only compensation. 
</P>
<P>
Only a handful of foreign embassies still are operating in Kuwait city in 
defiance of the Hussein regime, and water, electricity and shipments of 
supplies have been cut off. According to the wife of a top U.S. diplomat, the 
few remaining Americans still had stored water and were eating a monotonous 
diet of rice and tuna. 
</P>
<P>
The pressure for a new resolution against Iraq came as Perez de Cuellar 
continued to try to clarify ways in which a U.N. fact-finding mission to 
Jerusalem would be accepted by the Israeli government. The Security Council 
voted last Friday to condemn Israel for the killing of 21 Palestinians in 
Jerusalem last week and requested Perez de Cuellar to send a mission to 
investigate. 
</P>
<P>
But the Israeli government has made it clear such a mission is not welcome. For 
almost a week, diplomats have been working behind the scenes to find a 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III defended U.S. support for 
the U.N. resolution condemning Israel during a sometimes heated exchange with 
members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"You are saying that the resolution was unbalanced," Baker told Rep. Eliot L. 
Engel (D-N.Y.). "I have to tell you that the (Israeli) response (to Arab 
rioting on Temple Mount) was unbalanced, and the resolution condemned the 
response. We think the response was excessive. There is no excuse for what 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
California Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica) issued a blistering statement 
accusing the Administration of "allowing longstanding Arab hatred of Israel to 
dictate American policy and drive a wedge between the U.S. and Israel." He said 
Administration policy created a link between the Arab-Israel conflict and the 
gulf crisis.

ISRAEL TO KEEP ON EXPANDING SETTLEMENTS IN EAST JERUSALEM, LEVY INFORMS BAKER; 
</P>
<P>
CONFRONTATION: THE FOREIGN MINISTER'S LETTER OF CLARIFICATION IS CERTAIN TO 
RENEW FRICTION WITH U.S. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Israel will continue to expand settlements in annexed districts of Jerusalem, 
as well as in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, despite persistent 
objections from Washington, Israel's Foreign Minister David Levy said Thursday 
in a letter to Secretary of State James A. Baker III. 
</P>
<P>
The letter is expected to renew the friction that appeared to have receded with 
recent pledges by Israel to alter its settlement policies. 
</P>
<P>
In early October, Israel promised not to use American aid money to build new 
neighborhoods on land seized by Israel in the Arab-Israeli War of 1967. In 
addition, Israel promised not to settle Soviet immigrants across the so-called 
Green Line that separated pre-1967 Israel from Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
The dual guarantees opened the way for U.S. approval of $400 million in loan 
guarantees for immigrant housing but touched off a storm of criticism from 
members of the government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, which has a fragile 
two-seat majority in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, in order to clarify "differing interpretations," Levy informed 
Baker that his previous pledge would not hinder the construction of 
settlements. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to make sure you are aware that in the (earlier) letter there is no 
undertaking, either direct or indirect, to refrain from construction within 
Jerusalem, or restricting it -- or in any other place, including Judea, Samaria 
and Gaza," Levy wrote. Judea and Samaria are the biblical names Israelis apply 
to the West Bank to symbolize what they regard as Israel's historical right to 
the land. 
</P>
<P>
"My government has an ideological foundation," Levy continued. "If you think 
that we will change our credo on the basis of which the government was elected 
because of these investment (loan) guarantees, you should know that this will 
not happen." 
</P>
<P>
Implicit in Levy's letter, Israeli officials say, is that Soviet immigrants 
will be settled in new housing in East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed after 
the 1967 war. Under a plan unveiled this week, six new neighborhoods will be 
built in East Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
In the U.S. view, East Jerusalem lies beyond the Green Line, but Israel 
considers the city to be within the line that separates Israel from the West 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Levy's letter highlights the gap between the United States and Israel over 
eventual control of East Jerusalem, with its large Arab population, as well as 
the West Bank and Gaza, where 1.7 million Palestinians live. 
</P>
<P>
Israel considers Jerusalem a closed subject. In Israel's view, no Green Line 
traverses the city; the municipal boundaries, including annexed Arab 
neighborhoods, are permanent. Although Israel has stopped short of annexing the 
West Bank and Gaza, the government has seized large areas of land and turned 
them over to Israeli settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Because housing is less expensive in the West Bank and Gaza Strip than in 
Israel proper, Israelis in increasing numbers are being tempted to move across 
the Green Line as the Soviet influx drives up rents and purchase prices. 
Financial breaks for contractors may also make new East Jerusalem housing 
cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
The United States still views Jerusalem as technically divided, with its status 
to be decided by negotiation. Both Bush and Baker have said the city should 
remain physically united, although they reserve comment on its political 
future. In the past, the United States has favored putting Jerusalem under 
international control. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has characterized Israeli settlements on the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip as obstacles to peace talks. Last spring, Baker raised the issue 
of whether U.S. aid frees up funds that permit Israel to move ahead with its 
settlement program. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when Israel is pressing for more aid to cover the influx of Soviet 
Jews, the government will spend $80 million on expanding West Bank and Gaza 
settlements, Israeli newspapers say. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry officials say the original Levy pledge on immigrant housing 
and settlements was designed to minimize U.S.-Israeli discord. 
</P>
<P>
"We would disagree, but not worry about it now," a ministry official said. 
</P>
<P>
East Jerusalem never came up in the negotiations over the pledge, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, two events have occurred to push the issue forward, and rivals of Levy 
in the government -- some say Shamir himself -- have rushed to criticize Levy 
for "surrendering" sovereignty over the city. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Shamir muddied the issue with terse comments on radio. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever accepts these (U.S.) conditions doesn't mean he agrees to all these 
limitations always and under all circumstances," Shamir said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's bloodshed on the Temple Mount, when police trying to deal with 
rioters killed 21 Palestinians, also drew attention to the divided nature of 
the city. Israel rejected a U.N. investigation of the Temple Mount incident, 
saying it would infringe on Israel's control of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Like the United States, the United Nations does not recognize the 1967 
annexation of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Washington is trying to keep intact a multilateral military force in Saudi 
Arabia to force Iraq out of Kuwait, and it views the Jerusalem turmoil as 
undermining relations with its Arab allies. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, Israel has been trying to shift the focus back to the Kuwaiti 
crisis while at the same time giving no ground on either the settlements issue 
or the question of permitting a U.N. team to investigate the Temple Mount 
incident.

IN PAKISTAN, BHUTTO IS THE ISSUE AS CAMPAIGN IGNORES MAJOR PROBLEMS; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE RACE IS NOT A KIND, GENTLE EXERCISE AS COMPETING CRIMINAL CHARGES 
PASS FOR POLITICAL DISCOURSE.

<TEXT>
<P>
At nearly midnight and still two campaign speeches from sleep, Benazir Bhutto 
had a voice that was hoarse, hair caked with dust and fingers nervously 
worrying a string of blue prayer beads. 
</P>
<P>
But the ousted prime minister suddenly leaned over on a crowded rally stage to 
confide the obvious: The race for Pakistan's national elections next Wednesday 
is no kinder, gentler exercise in democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been lots of pre-election rigging," she said. "Many people have been 
arrested. Money has been dished out to buy votes. Polling places have been 
changed. Identity cards have been confiscated. People have been intimidated. 
That's what my opponents are doing." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, one of her chief opponents disagrees. In a separate 
interview, interim Prime Minister Gulam Mustafa Jatoi accused Bhutto and her 
Pakistan People's Party of their own depredations. 
</P>
<P>
"She is the root cause of all evil," said Jatoi, munching a cake after his 
sparsely attended rally in nearby Padidan. "Now they want to prove that law and 
order under us is no better than under them. So they are behind kidnaping of 
children -- yes, kidnaping!" 
</P>
<P>
In a country long used to political violence, most of the charges are nothing 
new. Indeed, several political groups appear responsible for about 35 reported 
abductions of businessmen and students in Karachi, Pakistan's financial hub. 
</P>
<P>
"The word on the street is the kidnapings are to raise funds for the 
campaigns," one Western diplomat said. "The other word is intimidation. One 
guy's son was kidnaped to get him to give evidence against Bhutto's husband." 
</P>
<P>
So goes Pakistan's rough-and-tumble scramble for political power, 10 weeks 
after the modern Islamic world's first woman prime minister was abruptly sacked 
amid charges of corruption, nepotism and incompetence. It is a campaign where 
competing criminal charges pass for political discourse. 
</P>
<P>
So far the army, which has ruled Pakistan for 25 of its 43 years, has stayed in 
the background. But Jatoi's army-backed government has charged Bhutto with 
corruption and abuse of power in six special criminal court cases. 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, was jailed last week in Karachi for 
allegedly kidnaping a Pakistan-born British citizen and extorting $800,000 from 
him. Zardari's father and Bhutto's mother, both also linked to alleged 
corruption schemes, have fled to London. 
</P>
<P>
Partially as a result, Bhutto's 20-month administration, whose dismissal was 
again upheld Thursday by a Pakistani court, is the only issue in the battle for 
control of the 217-seat National Assembly, the policy-making lower house of 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
All sides agree that next week's election will be a referendum on Bhutto's 
scandal-plagued tenure, rather than her scandal-plagued would-be successors. 
</P>
<P>
"The only issue is her failure to govern the country, her corruption and her 
failure to maintain law and order," Jatoi asserted. 
</P>
<P>
"The only issue is Benazir's love for the people and the caretaker government's 
illegal persecution of her," countered Nafees Siddiqi, a Bhutto party 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Jatoi, an avuncular figure who is one of Pakistan's largest landlords, was 
appointed prime minister in August even though voters in his home constituency, 
Sind, had voted him out of office. After winning another seat, he flooded his 
district with 120 electricity projects and more than 1,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto's other main rival is Nawaz Sharif, a pudgy Punjab industrialist who 
heads a factious anti-Bhutto opposition coalition. 
</P>
<P>
None of the candidates has offered programs or solutions to the nation's more 
pressing problems, including one of the world's highest birthrates and lowest 
life expectancies. About 85% of Pakistani women are illiterate and less than 
half the 107 million people have clean water, while two-thirds of the rural 
population has no access to health services. 
</P>
<P>
Nor have the candidates focused on Washington's suspension of aid last week. 
Nearly $600 million is frozen until the White House can certify that Islamabad 
has curtailed a reputed nuclear weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's talking any substance," a second Western diplomat said. "Kashmir 
continues to fester. The economy is going to hell. Corruption is worse than 
ever. And they just lost half a billion in foreign aid. Yet none of these are 
issues. The only issue is, do you support Benazir or don't you?" 
</P>
<P>
It appears that a growing number do. Although she may yet be arrested or banned 
from political office, Bhutto's campaign has capitalized on her family's trials 
and tribulations, which she invariably portrays as persecution by her political 
enemies. 
</P>
<P>
"She's playing on the sympathy vote," Zahid Hussain, a political journalist, 
said. "And in some areas at least, it's working." 
</P>
<P>
At Nawabshah, where Bhutto's husband is running for a seat against Jatoi's son, 
Bhutto aides charged that 100 party and polling booth workers have been jailed 
without cause. Aijaz Shah, one 26-year-old landowner there, said his father and 
uncle were hiding to avoid arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"They are underground," he said. "Jatoi's people say if we don't vote for them, 
they take our land and we are arrested and jailed. But we say no. So they must

</P>
<P>
In two court appearances, Bhutto has pleaded not guilty. Charges against the 
37-year-old Oxford and Radcliffe university graduate involve the award of 
sweetheart cotton export contracts and a consultant's position in a power 
project funded by the Asian Development Bank. Each deal cost the government 
$4.6 million, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto also was charged with improperly approving a proposed hotel and golf 
course project on government land near Islamabad at a fraction of market rates, 
and of bypassing two dozen applicants to give lucrative marketing rights for 
liquid petroleum gas to a cousin, a family friend and two political allies. 
</P>
<P>
Two charges added Wednesday center on allegations that she misused intelligence 
funds and improperly used military and government planes to transport members 
of Parliament during a no-confidence vote last November. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, previously charged with bank fraud and illegal weapons possession, 
was arrested Oct. 10 in Karachi and remains jailed there. 
</P>
<P>
Available information suggests that evidence of his role in the kidnaping is 
mostly hearsay, but the government's special "accountability" tribunals are 
heavily weighted against the defendant. Unlike Pakistan's regular legal system, 
bail is barred and the defendant must prove his or her own innocence. 
</P>
<P>
That innocence is not in doubt, Bhutto said in an interview. She accused her 
opponents of arresting her husband "to undermine his election campaign" and to 
"demoralize and depress" party workers and supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to keep me preoccupied and worried and unable to concentrate on 
the campaign," Bhutto said. "But my husband is only winning more votes from his 
arrest. Our party workers will not stop. And while I am preoccupied, I don't 
let it stop me from the campaign. How can I?"

Photo, Competing Charges: In the campaign for Pakistan's national elections 
next week, accusations and criminal charges are passing for political 
discourse. Just 10 weeks after Benazir Bhutto, the modern Islamic world's first 
female prime minister, was ousted amid charges of corruption, most see the 
balloting as a referendum on the tenure of Bhutto -- at a rally this week, 
above -- and not her would-be successors. Associated Press; Photo, (Southland

Panamanian authorities said Thursday they have broken up a military ring 
plotting against the government and named as a coup leader the man picked as 
security chief after last year's U.S. invasion of Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. Rogelio Cruz accused the band of terrorist activities and of 
conspiring to seize military installations. 
</P>
<P>
He said former Col. Eduardo Herrera and a brother, Capt. Francisco Herrera, 
were implicated. 
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Hererra, who took charge of the newly formed public security forces 
after U.S. troops invaded Panama on Dec. 20, 1989, and ousted Gen. Manuel A. 
Noriega, was reported out of the country. His brother apparently is not in 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon said earlier Thursday that members of the 
security forces "could be connected to the explosion of bombs in the province 
of Chiriqui and possibly to some bombs that went off in the capital." 
</P>
<P>
He said Capt. Ivan Moreno, subdirector of Public Forces in Chiriqui, divulged 
the conspiracy after he was detained. Cruz said two enlisted men are also in 
custody.

S. AFRICA ENDS NATAL PROVINCE STATE OF EMERGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Frederik W. de Klerk, meeting a key demand of the African National 
Congress, lifted the four-year state of emergency in strife-torn Natal province 
on Thursday and declared the way clear for constitutional negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
With his action, the president also met one of the five conditions necessary 
for lifting American economic sanctions against Pretoria. Only two conditions 
remain: the freeing of political prisoners and the repeal of all apartheid 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"The door to (negotiations) is now fully open, and I am appealing to all 
leaders and all South Africans to accept the challenge of this open door," De 
Klerk said at a news conference in Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
Marlin Fitzwater, President Bush's press secretary, said De Klerk's action was 
"yet another important landmark on the road toward full normalization of 
political activity in South Africa." He added, "We believe that President De 
Klerk deserves credit for his political courage and leadership." 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said conditions in Natal have stabilized "to such an extent that the 
ordinary laws of the land are again sufficient to enable the government to . . 
. maintain public order despite continuing sporadic violence." 
</P>
<P>
The province of Natal, on the Indian Ocean coast, has been racked by three 
years of internecine warfare that has killed nearly 4,000 blacks. 
</P>
<P>
The fighting, primarily among Zulus, has pitted supporters of Nelson Mandela's 
ANC against those of Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party. But 
it has been fanned by the region's poverty, scarce resources and a housing 
shortage that has forced tens of thousands of blacks to live in shacks without 
running water. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC and Inkatha began peace talks in Natal a few weeks ago, and both sides 
report substantial progress. 
</P>
<P>
For months, the ANC and relief workers in Natal have complained that the extra 
powers granted the police under the emergency have exacerbated rather than 
eased tensions in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't think (the emergency) was necessary, except possibly to make whites 
feel more secure," said Paul Graham, director of the Institute for a Democratic 
Alternative in Durban. "We could well have done without it." 
</P>
<P>
Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said he does not intend to withdraw any of 
the several thousand police or troops in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have enough policemen there now," Vlok said. "We need more to ensure 
there's not another flare-up." 
</P>
<P>
At least 26 people have been killed in unrest in Natal this month, including 
six blacks who died in a bus ambush. Three white men, two of them right-wing 
extremists, have been arrested in that attack. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC, in a statement issued in Johannesburg, welcomed De Klerk's move, 
saying it will help create a climate for free political activity and peace.

PIVOTAL 'KEATING FIVE' DELIBERATIONS STARTED; 
</P>
<P>
ETHICS: PANEL ACTION IS SEEN AS A PRELUDE TO A FULL-SCALE INVESTIGATION OF 
SENS. CRANSTON, DECONCINI AND RIEGLE.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate Ethics Committee on Thursday began pivotal deliberations on the 
"Keating Five," amid indications that it will approve a full-scale 
investigation of actions that Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and two other key 
Democratic senators took to help savings and loan magnate Charles H. Keating 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The panel's closed-door session came with the disclosure of new documents 
showing the lengths to which Cranston and Sens. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and 
Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan went on behalf of Keating, a major campaign 
contributor. 
</P>
<P>
Raising particular questions were late-night and early-morning telephone calls 
that the documents state were made by Cranston and DeConcini to the unlisted 
home number of a federal regulator. In a sworn affidavit, former Federal Home 
Loan Bank Board member Roger F. Martin said that Cranston and DeConcini used 
"almost exactly the same words" in separate calls urging the board to meet with 
the head of an investor group that could have taken Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan 
Assn. off Keating's hands at a time when it was on the verge of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"The unexplained urgency of the senators' telephone calls was, in my 
experience, highly unusual, as was their timing very late at night and very 
early in the morning," Martin said in the affidavit, the contents of which were 
confirmed by a source close to the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The Ethics Committee will decide whether to follow the advice of its special 
counsel, Robert S. Bennett, by proceeding with the investigation of Cranston, 
DeConcini and Riegle, while dropping two other senators -- John Glenn (D-Ohio) 
and John McCain (R-Ariz.) -- from the inquiry for lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
All five repeatedly have denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston, in a statement Thursday, denounced the disclosure of the evidence. 
"The leaks are deplorable," he said. "I'm reminded of the (Sen. Joseph R.) 
McCarthy era," Cranston said in a reference to the late Wisconsin Republican 
whose investigative excesses led the Senate to censure him. 
</P>
<P>
"In my heart of hearts, I know I've done nothing wrong," he said. "I trust that 
will be the finding of the Ethics Committee." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Maynes, DeConcini's press secretary, said: "Not only do these leaks break 
Ethics Committee rules, but since they are frequently inaccurate or out of 
context, they violate the average American's sense of fair play." 
</P>
<P>
Citing advice from DeConcini's counsel and a request from the committee not to 
comment on the investigative process, Maynes said: "Therefore, unfortunately, 
Sen. DeConcini is not in a position to defend himself." 
</P>
<P>
Riegle charged that he was the victim of "continuing leaks of inaccurate and 
false information." 
</P>
<P>
"A selective pattern of leaked confidential materials -- totally out of context 
-- does not present the full picture before the committee nor does it recognize 
that I voluntarily supplied the committee with all materials that pertain to me 
and the Lincoln-Keating matter months ago," Riegle said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he believed the Senate panel will find "that my conduct was proper 
and ethical at all times." And he said that he looks forward to discussing the 
matter fully and all the facts being made public once the committee has 
completed its work. 
</P>
<P>
The Ethics Committee began investigating last December whether the actions by 
the five senators on behalf of Keating violated Senate rules. Keating donated 
more than $1 million to their campaigns or causes that they backed. 
</P>
<P>
Documents obtained by the committee show that Cranston, DeConcini and Riegle or 
their aides maintained frequent contact with Keating through letters, memoranda 
and personal meetings. They also show the senators' being advised that Keating 
was raising funds for them and expecting specific help from them. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, in his affidavit to committee investigators, said that, as recently as 
March or April of 1989, Cranston and DeConcini called to voice their concern 
that an investor group headed by former Rep. John H. Rousselot was not 
receiving a fair hearing from a bank board unit on its proposal to take over 
Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston reached him late at night at his unlisted home phone number in 
Virginia, Martin said, and DeConcini made a similar call to him at 5:30 a.m. 
the following morning. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said Cranston urged that the bank board meet with Rousselot immediately, 
citing his concern that Lincoln's failure "would have a serious impact on the 
Arizona real estate market." 
</P>
<P>
Martin said he told Cranston "that the board's procedures would not permit a 
full meeting of the board to be arranged on an urgent basis." 
</P>
<P>
In the call from DeConcini early the next morning, "he used almost exactly the 
same words as were used by Sen. Cranston the night before," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston and DeConcini did not urge that the acquisition be approved, Martin 
said. But he added that "while members of Congress occasionally attempted to 
call me at my office, I have never, either before or since this incident, 
received a telephone call at home from any senator or representative regarding 
a board matter." 
</P>
<P>
The bank board eventually rejected the takeover proposal and the government 
seized Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
M. Danny Wall, former chairman of the bank board, has previously disclosed that 
he received calls during the same period from both Cranston and DeConcini, who 
urged him to allow Keating to sell Lincoln. Wall was the man with the ultimate 
responsibility for the decision. 
</P>
<P>
The documents also include a Cranston memo thanking Keating for a $250,000 
contribution solicited by the senator for a voter registration project. The 
memo also expressed Cranston's pleasure that Keating had met with the top 
thrift regulator to voice his complaints.

FLORES TRIES TO REVIVE ISSUE OF EU'S HUSBAND'S FINANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Republican secretary of state candidate Joan Milke Flores attempted Thursday to 
revive concerns about the financial dealings of incumbent March Fong Eu's 
husband, a Singapore businessman whose refusal to divulge the secrets of his 
wealth forced Eu to abandon her U.S. Senate candidacy three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Standing outside the locked gates to Eu's Hancock Park neighborhood, Flores 
released her income tax returns for the last 10 years and called on Eu to do 
the same. Flores said the disclosure, although not required by law, was 
necessary to reassure voters that "we will put their best interests ahead of 
our own." 
</P>
<P>
Although Flores did not mention him by name, the challenge was clearly directed 
at Henry Eu, who is part of an economically powerful Chinese family with 
interests in Asian mining, real estate and herbal medicines. Henry Eu, who pays 
the lease on the family's Hancock Park home, is not a citizen of the United 
States and carries a Singapore passport. 
</P>
<P>
"Do we as voters have a right to know this information?" asked Flores, a Los 
Angeles city councilwoman who has been divorced for 27 years. "Absolutely . . . 
especially since her husband could have investments in California. Until these 
questions are answered, March Fong Eu will always be in a shadow of doubt." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Eu said Thursday that the four-term Democratic incumbent will 
release her tax returns as soon as she can assemble them, but he predicted they 
will not shed new light on her husband of 17 years because the couple do not 
file joint returns. 
</P>
<P>
"He is not even a resident of this country," said Anthony L. Miller, Eu's chief 
deputy. "His interest here is having a spouse here." 
</P>
<P>
Leo McElroy, Eu's campaign consultant, dismissed Flores' attack on Eu and her 
husband as an act of desperation. "You are seeing somebody who has basically 
failed to have her campaign catch fire and is still trying to light a match," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eu has long maintained that her husband does not share information with her 
about his business dealings and that their finances are separate. Statements of 
economic interest that she files annually with the state list only two of his 
many business interests, and aides said her income tax returns do not account 
for any of her husband's wealth. 
</P>
<P>
Eu said in a recent interview that she rarely sees her husband. "I am my 
family," she said. "My husband is not here much." 
</P>
<P>
Henry Eu's secretiveness in 1987 made it impossible for his wife to comply with 
federal campaign rules, which require candidates and their spouses to divulge 
their international financial holdings. His refusal to do so eventually led to 
his wife's withdrawal from the Senate race.

ROBERT TESSIER; 20 YEARS AS TOUGH GUY IN TV, MOVIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Tessier, whose shaved head and menacing countenance made him a 
forbidding presencein dozens of films and television shows, has died of cancer, 
a longtime friend said thisweek. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Haggerty said Tessier was 56 when he died of cancer in Lowell, Mass., on 
Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
He had returned to Lowell, his native city, when he learned his illness was 
fatal, Haggerty said. 
</P>
<P>
Cast throughout his 20-year career as villain or "tough guy," Tessier broke 
into films in 1970 with "Cry Blood, Apache." His last picture was this year's 
"Night-wish." In the interim he was Rude Water in the acclaimed TV series, 
"Centennial," Amtrac in the film "Hooper," Magua in "Last of the Mohicans," 
another TV film, and Kevin in "The Deep," a 1977 feature picture of underwater 
villainy. 
</P>
<P>
His other pictures included "The Longest Yard," "Hard Times" and such TV series 
as "Vegas," "The Fall Guy," "Charlie's Angels" and others. 
</P>
<P>
Born to an American Indian and French family, Tessier determined as a youth to 
become an actor. He came to Los Angeles in the 1960s after service in the 
Korean War where he was awarded the Silver Star and two Purple Hearts. 
</P>
<P>
He was befriended by Lindsay Crosby, Dennis Hopper and Dan Haggerty, all 
strugglingactors at that point. His first roles were in low-budget motorcycle 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Divorced, Tessier is survived by two sons, three daughters, his mother and two 
sisters. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial celebration will be held at The Outlaws, a Playa del Rey club, on 
Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, whose love for luxury sports cars may equal his 
passion for politics, got good deals on a couple of high-priced automobiles in 
the last year, but he didn't have to haggle over the price. 
</P>
<P>
The powerful San Francisco Democrat picked up a Corvette at a "fleet deal" from 
a San Diego-area car dealer who heads a group that lobbies in Sacramento. Brown 
also bought a limited-edition 1991 Acura NSX at $20,000 below the going rate in 
a purchase arranged through the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
The Corvette deal was set up by another politician with a passion for fast 
automobiles, Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), who briefly owned a stake in a 
National City car franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Brown saved $500 to $1,000 in sales commissions on the Corvette by dealing 
directly with Robert H. Baker, a former partner of Robbins and owner of several 
San Diego-area car dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like selling to a rental car company," Baker said of the 1989 deal. 
"It's a little better price than the general public, but I still made a buck on 
it. . . . The car is in the low $30,000 range. I made between 3% and 5%." 
</P>
<P>
Baker is president of the Motor Car Dealers of Southern California, a group 
that regularly lobbies the Legislature on bills affecting dealerships. A year 
ago, for example, the group backed a bill that allowed car dealers to raise the 
fees they charge customers for processing documents by $10 a vehicle. The 
measure, enacted last year, could cost consumers as much as $23 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
But Baker discounted any connection between legislation and the Corvette sale. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never dealt with Willie as president of the Southern California Motor Car 
Dealers, but I might in the future," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said that he described the Corvette transaction to federal authorities 
who are investigating how Robbins in 1987 acquired a share in an Acura 
dealership now owned by Baker.

Robbins is the subject of a continuing grand jury investigation into 
allegations of political corruption in the Capitol. Robbins could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with that inquiry have repeatedly said that Brown is not a 
target of the probe. Michael Reese, Brown's press secretary, said he could not 
comment on the Corvette transaction. Brown bought an even more expensive car 
last week from Carmichael Acura, two years after first telling the 
manufacturer, American Honda Motor Co., he was interested in purchasing one of 
the aluminum-body, high-performance cars. The autos are in such short supply 
that they are selling for $20,000 or more above the manufacturer's suggested 
$60,000 price, according to industry sources and advertised sales in Auto Week 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's purchase of the car at the sticker price, reported in Thursday's 
Sacramento Union, was a straightforward transaction, said Brown spokesman 
Michael Reese. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't haggle. He did not deal. He didn't ask for any cut," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A Honda spokesman said the manufacturer asked the dealership to sell Brown the 
car at the sticker price. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, American Honda has hired lobbyists to represent the company's 
interest in a variety of bills before the Legislature, including measures 
regulating noise from off-road vehicles and requiring that customers be 
notified when their cars are repaired with parts made by a company other than 
the original manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
But Reese stated that Brown promised Honda nothing in setting the price for his 
car. "There is clearly no evidence he has done this in exchange for anything, 
except to satisfy his passion for beautiful automobiles," Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
Honda spokesman Kurt Antonius acknowledged that the number of Acura NSX cars 
available in the United States is far less than demand and that only about 5% 
are sold for the $60,000 sticker price. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked the dealer (Carmichael Acura) to sell a car to Willie Brown," 
Antonius said. "That's what we asked them to sell it to him for -- $60,000." 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the dealership, Rick Niello, said that he has sold a number of 
cars to Brown. "He's a good customer of ours," Niello said. 
</P>
<P>
Antonius said the company arranged a similar deal on an NSX for filmmaker 
George Lucas and for the same reason as Brown: "He's a well-known person. He's 
recognizable, an opinion leader. We'd like to help take care of those people. 
There's nothing in return." 
</P>
<P>
Donald Trump is now on the company's waiting list for the sports car -- because 
his request came after Brown's, Antonius said. 
</P>
<P>
These are not the first instances of Brown receiving good deals on fancy cars. 
</P>
<P>
More than a year ago, he told The Times that he had purchased a jet black 
Porsche Turbo from an El Cajon auto dealer in 1986 for less "than the normal 
market price." Brown declined to name the dealer, but described him as a close 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said that investigators from an unnamed agency had examined the deal on 
the false assumption that the car was purchased from a drug dealer.

Charles Rothenberg, the man who was convicted of setting fire to his son in 
1983, will stay in San Quentin Prison because he violated his parole, officials 
ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg's parole will be revoked for eight months, said Jim Dowling, 
spokesman for the Board of Prison Terms. He said the revocation dates to Sept. 
10, when Rothenberg was arrested in Oakland. Rothenberg was en route to a job 
interview with a parole agent when he ducked out of a doughnut shop and eluded 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg, 50, was convicted of attempted murder, arson and other charges for 
pouring kerosene over his son David and setting him on fire. David, 6 at the 
time, was severely disfigured.

Great conflict often produces great art. Intimations of mortality evoking 
intimations of morality, and all that stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Regard: "The Aeneid." "Troilus and Criseyde." "Man's Fate." "V Letter and Other 
Poems." "Francis the Talking Mule Joins the Navy." 
</P>
<P>
To this canon now welcome "Saudi Marines Lament," provided by Mark Billing, 75, 
a retired Marine captain living in Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Billing says he's merely the vessel, not the author. He says he discovered the 
10-quatrain poem of irregular meter and unruly rhyme while working as a 
civilian in the Saudi oil fields in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"Saudi Marines Lament" is an elegy of heat, flies, strange customs and 
unfulfilled longings. Sample verses: 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere in the Arabia Desert 
</P>
<P>
 Where the sun is like a curse 
</P>
<P>
 And every day is followed 
</P>
<P>
 By one that's even worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere near the Gulf of Persia 
</P>
<P>
 Where a woman is never seen 
</P>
<P>
 Where the skies are never cloudy 
</P>
<P>
 And the grass is never green. 
</P>
<P>
 Where the drinking water is colored 
</P>
<P>
 Like the drainage from the sink 
</P>
<P>
 And a man can't drown his sorrows 
</P>
<P>
 'Cause there's not a beer to drink. 
</P>
<P>
 Where the camels are all crummy 
</P>
<P>
 And the donkeys slightly worse 
</P>
<P>
 An' we really must be crazy 
</P>
<P>
 When we start to writing verse. 
</P>
<P>
 Billing caused "Saudi Marines Lament" to be published in the Camp Pendleton 
newspaper. He wants the home front to appreciate the hardships the troops are 
facing (See Literature as Morale Booster, "Henry V"). 
</P>
<P>
He retired in 1961 after 25 years in the Corps. He says he'd go to Saudi Arabia 
in a flash, but he's a bit slowed up recently.

He survived Guadalcanal just fine, but competing on the senior tennis circuit 
is playing havoc with his arthritis.

It passed largely unnoticed Tuesday when a 33-year-old prostitute named Helena 
Klarissa Mueller-Beilschmidt pleaded guilty in San Diego Municipal Court to 
being an accessory to pandering. 
</P>
<P>
But, if the case had gone to trial, it could have been big news. 
</P>
<P>
Among the witnesses called by the prosecution: Richard T. Silberman, now at the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center awaiting assignment to a full-time federal 
pokey. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors won't say what they wanted to ask Silberman about 
Mueller-Beilschmidt, who reportedly once worked for Rolodex madam Karen 
Wilkening. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Iredale, attorney for Mueller-Beilschmidt, insists his client does not 
know Silberman except through news coverage: 
</P>
<P>
"Helena has told me that she does not know the man and was not involved with 
him. He has suffered enough." 
</P>
<P>
Iredale says Silberman's name arose only when his client's boyfriend told 
prosecutors a bunch of wild stories about an international ring of prostitutes, 
in an effort to strike a bargain in an assault case.

STUDENT APPLICANTS FLOOD CSU SAN MARCOS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE NEW UNIVERSITY MAY HAVE TO TURN AWAY 
QUALIFIED APPLICANTS FOR SPRING SEMESTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Still in its inaugural year, Cal State San Marcos will turn away qualified 
student applicants for the upcoming spring semester, university officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The university last Monday stopped accepting applications for the semester 
beginning in January. As late as Thursday, only an estimate of the number of 
applicants was available. 
</P>
<P>
"Our expectations were exceeded, and it looks like we are going to have just 
under 400 applications for the spring," said Betty Huff, director of 
admissions. 
</P>
<P>
Although none of the applications have been processed yet, Huff expects that 
more than 90% will meet the school's entrance requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Huff said the campus, at 283 full-time students, is already above the 250 
students that had been budgeted for this year. The new applicants will easily 
push the number of full-time students beyond 300, although no one is quite sure 
by how many, Huff said. 
</P>
<P>
Students applying to the university's teacher's credential program, its only 
post-baccalaureate program, accounted for more than 100 of the applicants, 
school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The credentialed program, however, has space for only 25 more students in the 
spring, and it is likely that qualified applicants will be turned away, said 
Dorothy Lloyd, director of the program. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be looking at test scores, students will come in for personal 
interviews, they must have completed field experience, and there is their 
grade-point average to consider," Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the students that don't make it this time will reapply for the 
fall, because the fall class will be much larger," Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
Accepting even 25 students is a stretch of the school's resources, she said. 
The 52 students accepted into the program for this semester were two more than 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
"It squeezed our budget to do it, but it would have been terrible not to take 
in any students this spring. We would not have been serving our community if we 
did not," Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
The school delayed hiring both administrative and support personnel until the 
fall in order to accept the added students, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Interest in the credential program had been building ever since the opening of 
school, Lloyd said, with as many as 30 inquiries a day from prospective 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not really surprised at the number of applicants," Lloyd said. "We had 
heard that there was a great need for teachers in the North County area, and we 
are in a prime location for students." 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd said the university plans to accept 75 to 80 students for the credential 
program in the fall of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Huff, director of admissions, said she does not expect any baccalaureate 
students to be turned away. Dean of students Ernest Zomalt expects that about 
10% of the baccalaureate students will not enroll when classes begin next year, 
given the university's experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of the group that is readily admissible (both baccalaureate and 
post-baccalaureate students), we're thinking that there would be something on 
the order of 200 to 210 of the 380 to 390 applicants that would in fact 
enroll," Zomalt said. "Our analysis of available space would indicate that we 
can absorb that number." 
</P>
<P>
Zomalt said that at least two faculty positions will be filled to help handle 
the influx of students but conceded that the student-to-faculty ratio will 
probably rise slightly, particularly in business courses.

GYMNASIUM LISTED AS EARTHQUAKE RISK; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY: CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ HILLS FACILITY IS RANKED AMONG THE TOP 100 STATE 
BUILDINGS POSING A HAZARD. UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS SAY BUILDING IS SAFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A gymnasium at Cal State Dominguez Hills is listed among the top 100 
state-owned buildings that pose potential hazards in the event of an 
earthquake, according to school officials and the state Seismic Safety 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The gymnasium, which is designated as the school's primary emergency shelter, 
is listed in a January, 1990, commission report that assigns a priority ranking 
to more than 1,000 state buildings for more detailed structural analysis, said 
Fred Turner, a structural engineer for the Seismic Safety Commission. The 
Dominguez Hills gymnasium is 80th on the list. 
</P>
<P>
However, officials at Cal State Dominguez Hills say they are not concerned 
about possible hazards related to the gymnasium because the commission listing 
is not based on a comprehensive structural study. 
</P>
<P>
"There hasn't been a physical integrity study done that's said 'Yes, this is 
dangerous,' " said university spokesman Greg Klerkx. He said the gymnasium, 
constructed in 1977, was designed to meet building and earthquake-safety 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we're concerned, it's a safe building," Klerkx said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Tom Tobin, the commission's executive director, said the building is 
made of non-ductile concrete, which cannot bend or stretch during an earthquake 
without breaking. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the kind of building that can have a significant failure in the event of 
an earthquake," Tobin said. "I would say it definitely needs to be looked at 
further." 
</P>
<P>
The commission report is an update of a seismic hazards survey prepared in 
April, 1981, that took into account building size, age and type of 
construction, number of occupants, size and frequency of earthquakes in the 
area and the number of lives that could be saved by retrofitting the building. 
The information was then entered into a computer to come up with a ranking, 
Turner said. It did not include an on-site inspection. 
</P>
<P>
Because the state does not have the money to physically examine every one of 
its 16,000 buildings, the survey is intended as a guideline for determining 
funding of engineering studies of individual state-owned buildings, state 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The updated report, which lists more than 1,000 University of California, Cal 
State University and state office buildings, provides cost estimates for 
rehabilitating the structures, Tobin said. 
</P>
<P>
Those buildings with the highest ranking are those that state officials believe 
pose the highest risk in an earthquake, Tobin said. 
</P>
<P>
Upgrading the Dominguez Hills gymnasium to meet current seismic safety 
standards would cost $2.3 million, according to state estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills uses the gymnasium for its physical education classes and 
intercollegiate athletic events. It is also the school's primary disaster 
shelter, Klerkx said. However, if an earthquake occurs, the gymnasium would be 
evacuated along with other school buildings as part of the university's 
earthquake preparedness plan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The university defends the building's designation as an emergency shelter based 
on its past performance during earthquakes, Klerkx said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never had any incidents with this building" even during the Whittier 
earthquake, Klerkx said, referring to the 5.9 temblor of October, 1987. "As far 
as we're concerned, we're comfortable with the fact that it's an emergency 
shelter." 
</P>
<P>
Tobin said the gymnasium's listing at 80th is not to be taken lightly because 
three buildings at Cal State L.A. -- Salazar Hall, Martin Luther King Hall and 
John F. Kennedy Library -- ranked lower in the 1981 survey but suffered 
structural damage in the Whittier quake. 
</P>
<P>
A 23-year-old microbiology student was killed in that quake when she was struck 
by a concrete slab that fell from a parking structure at Cal State L.A. The 
parking structure was one of several campus buildings that were not listed in 
the survey because the university did not provide any information about the 
structures to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Students at Cal State Dominguez Hills have not expressed much concern about 
safety questions related to the gymnasium since the issue was first publicized 
by the campus newspaper, Dominguez News, in September, said Anna Harmon, 
Associated Students president. She said she did not have enough information 
about the issue to take a position. 
</P>
<P>
Most faculty members at the school are not aware of the situation, said Jose 
Cuervo, president of the Dominguez Hills chapter of the California Faculty 
Assn. Cuervo said he became aware of the commission ranking only this week when 
a reporter inquired about it. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State University officials are counting on voter approval of Proposition 
143 on the November ballot to provide funding for the Cal State system to 
increase seismic safety at all its facilities, said Colleen Bentley-Adler, a 
spokeswoman for the chancellor's office. The $450-million bond measure would 
provide funding for capital outlays for the Cal State system, the UC and 
community college systems. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State system would spend $1 million of the bond money to conduct its 
own initial seismic safety studies, which would include a physical integrity 
study of the Dominguez Hills gymnasium, Bentley-Adler said. The Cal State 
system used the commission's survey and report to help devise an overall plan, 
submitted to the governor in August, to increase seismic safety at its 20 
campuses, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The retrofit costs of Cal State buildings in the top third of the commission 
ranking are estimated at more than $560 million, according to the January 
report. There are 45 Cal State buildings listed among the top 100 structures. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Nichelson, president of the California Faculty Assn., the bargaining unit 
for Cal State faculty, said there is "grave concern about the condition of the 
CSU's infrastructure" among faculty members. 
</P>
<P>
"Seismic safety is something we believe was not given enough regard in the 
expansion of the system," Nichelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Two buildings at UCLA -- Powell Library and Moore Hall -- are among the top 10 
structures listed in the commission report. Powell Library ranks first on the 
list, and Moore Hall is ranked third. UCLA officials say the buildings are 
among 24 older state-funded structures included in the school's seismic-upgrade 
plan.

2 PROPOSALS TO UNIFY BEACH CITY SCHOOLS MAY GO BEFORE VOTERS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: TRUSTEES SUGGEST PUTTING COMPETING PLANS ON THE BALLOT. BUT STATE 
AND COUNTY OFFICIALS AREN'T SURE THAT IT WOULD BE LEGAL. 
</P>

<P>
The beach city battle over school reorganization continued to heat up this 
week, as Hermosa Beach trustees proposed letting voters choose between two 
competing plans for reconfiguring the schools in Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach 
and Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The idea, discussed at the Hermosa Beach school board meeting Wednesday, was 
the latest twist in the two-year debate over whether the beach city schools 
should be reorganized into one umbrella district or two. Although the voters in 
the three cities ultimately will decide the so-called unification question, the 
school boards are politically deadlocked over what plan to put on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
State and county education officials said Hermosa Beach's proposed compromise 
-- putting both plans on the ballot -- might be workable but needs more 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a bad idea. We just aren't sure it's legal," said Marc Forgy, 
secretary to the Los Angeles County Committee on School District Organization. 
</P>
<P>
There now are four school districts for the three cities: an elementary 
district in each city, and the South Bay Union High School District into which 
they feed. Unification has been under serious discussion among the districts 
since 1989, when the financially troubled high school district proposed merging 
with the elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
But longstanding rivalries among the three cities, combined with a fierce 
attachment to home rule, have blocked consensus. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach and Manhattan Beach want to dismantle the high school district 
and the Hermosa Beach district and reorganize into two 
kindergarten-through-12th-grade school systems; with Hermosa joining the 
Manhattan Beach-based system. 
</P>
<P>
Hermosa Beach wants to dismantle all four districts and create one unified 
district. 
</P>
<P>
And the high school trustees have agreed to go along with whatever the 
elementary districts decide. 
</P>
<P>
The process for reconfiguring school districts is complicated and bureaucratic 
and, unless all the affected school boards can agree on a proposal, requires a 
massive petition drive. 
</P>
<P>
The State Board of Education, for example, must approve any reorganization plan 
before it can go to the voters, and to become eligible for such consideration, 
a plan must have either unanimous approval from the school boards involved or 
be accompanied by petitions bearing the signatures of 25% of the registered 
voters in the affected districts. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, because school management is such a complex issue, voters may have 
difficulty grasping its finer points. Advocates of a Redondo Beach 
kindergarten-through-12th-grade district, for example, have taken a year to 
collect just 6,000 of the 10,000 petition signatures they need. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, said Redondo Beach board President Bart Swanson, is that the 
petition passers have had to spend an average of 20 minutes with each person 
they solicit, explaining how a school system is organized and managed. 
</P>
<P>
If all four school boards could agree on a proposal, a ballot measure could go 
before beach city voters this year. If they have to go the petition route, the 
matter could take years to come to a vote, state and county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Hermosa Beach trustees said they proposed the compromise two-option ballot as a 
way out of the current stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
"It may not be possible to iron out, but . . . (a two-option ballot) would 
solve a lot of problems," said Hermosa Beach Trustee Joe Mark. 
</P>
<P>
But reaction from other trustees is lukewarm. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally don't have any problem with putting both (proposals) on the 
ballot," said Redondo Beach Trustee Swanson. "But as I remember it, we talked 
about that a long time ago, and we were left with the impression that it wasn't 
legal." 
</P>
<P>
Manhattan Beach board President Barbara Dunsmoor said she, too, had problems 
with the Hermosa Beach plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure it's a very good idea," she said. "The issue is confusing enough. 
This would only make it more confusing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UNIFICATION AT A GLANCE 
</P>
<P>
THE ISSUE: 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach each have an elementary school 
district. When children in the three cities reach ninth grade, they are 
funneled into the separate South Bay Union High School District. 
</P>
<P>
The high school district, however, has had financial problems, and the single 
K-8 school in Hermosa Beach is overcrowded and strapped for cash. All four 
districts agree reorganization is necessary, but they cannot agree on how to do 
it. 
</P>
<P>
THE OPTIONS: 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach and Manhattan Beach favor split unification, in which two K-12 
school systems would be created, one in each of those cities, and the high 
school district would be dismantled. Redondo Beach would take over Redondo 
Union High School, and Manhattan Beach would merge with Hermosa Beach and they 
would take over Mira Costa High School, which is in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Hermosa Beach wants total unification, in which all four districts would merge 
along the boundaries of the high school district to create one 10,000-student, 
unified district. 
</P>
<P>
(South Bay Union High School trustees initially wanted total unification but 
have since agreed to support any plan the elementary school boards can agree 
on.) 
</P>
<P>
THE ARGUMENTS: 
</P>
<P>
PRO: Split unification would protect local control for at least two of the 
districts while saving money through economies of scale. Manhattan Beach and 
Hermosa Beach already share a common approach to testing and educational 
programs. Hermosa Beach students could take advantage of the broader range of 
electives offered in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
CON: Hermosa Beach would become the only beach city to lose its home rule. 
About 500 students from North Redondo Beach, who now attend Mira Costa, would 
have to transfer to Redondo Union. 
</P>
<P>
PRO: Total unification would allow efficient operation and the broadest 
educational options. 
</P>
<P>
CON: All three cities would lose local control. The new district also would 
have to reconcile differences between Redondo Beach's testing and educational 
philosophy, and that of Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach.

PRICE CUTS UNABLE TO SPUR HOME SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Collins has some advice for homeowners thinking of putting a "FOR SALE" 
sign on their front lawn -- think twice. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a wonderful buyer's market, and we are encouraging everyone who doesn't 
need to be on the market right now to pull off," said Collins, a Hermosa Beach 
real estate broker and president of the South Bay Board of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
That would hardly have been Collins' advice 30 months ago, when many properties 
sold soon after the sign had been driven into the ground and sometimes even 
before they made the realtors' listing book. 
</P>
<P>
"It was exciting, it was hectic, it was bedlam," Collins recalled. "We could 
hardly get a listing to hang around a few days before we had an offer on it." 
</P>
<P>
Today, local agents say, the market is characterized by a crush of listings 
with some sellers sharply reducing their prices and still waiting months to 
unload their properties. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has a house to sell," said agent Susan McNeill, who is offering 
homes at the new Sea Bluff development in Rancho Palos Verdes, where prices 
have been reduced $100,000 to $150,000 to spur sales. The homes are now listed 
at $650,000 to $850,000. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, relationships between agents and sellers are being tested as 
the two sides square off over just how much a home should be listed for. Agents 
are now faced with the unpleasant task of telling clients that their homes may 
not fetch as much as the one down the street did six or seven months ago -- 
even though the homes are clones. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough because they think you are trying to rip them off," said a veteran 
South Bay agent who did not want to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, agents said lower-priced homes and very expensive homes, whose 
buyers aren't as affected by ups and downs in the economy, are moving the most 
rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
According to the California Assn. of Realtors, the median price of a home in 
California in August was $194,099, down 3.1% from a year ago. In Los Angeles 
County, the median price dropped 5%, to $212,170. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay multiple listing figures show that there were 7,146 homes, including 
condominiums, on the market at the end of September, up from 5,196 during the 
same period last year. On the average, it took 109 days to sell a home, 
compared to 76 days during the same period last year, the figures show. 
</P>
<P>
Even though agents say many sellers -- even those living in the South Bay's 
most pricey communities -- are slashing prices and waiting longer for an offer, 
the local multiple listing numbers do not necessarily indicate that. On the 
average, home sellers were getting 94% of their list price through September, 
according to the data from the South Bay multiple listing service. For the same 
period last year, the figure was 96%. 
</P>
<P>
Just where prices are headed is guesswork for agents and housing experts, many 
of whom peg their forecasts to the outcome of the Middle East and national 
budget crises and the direction of interest rates and inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Barring major bad economic news, Kathleen Connell, chairwoman of the Center for 
Finance and Real Estate at UCLA's Anderson Graduate School of Management, said 
she believes local real estate prices will probably remain flat in 1991, with 
perhaps a slight increase in the fourth quarter. Leslie Appleton-Young, vice 
president for research and economics for the state realtors association, 
predicted prices will remain steady the remainder of this year and next. 
</P>
<P>
Some agents and housing experts say the present slowdown was predictable 
because home prices in recent years have escalated to a level where many people 
simply found it difficult or impossible to afford a home. In the South Bay 
beach cities, for example, a so-called starter home now sells in the 
neighborhood of $325,000, Redondo Beach real estate agent David Teague said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think just pure affordability is a problem in our market," he said. ". . . 
(The) first-time buyer segment is getting smaller and smaller." 
</P>
<P>
Others said they believe a lack of consumer confidence is also having an impact 
on the market. People wondering whether their jobs are secure or if they are 
going to receive a year-end bonus are reluctant to trade up to a more expensive 
home, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not going to commit themselves to buying a bigger home in a better 
community," Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
Connell said that she also believes that consumers are simply resisting high 
housing costs, figuring prices are too high for what they are getting. "People 
are beginning to show some skepticism about the cost of housing in California," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Connell predicted that the real estate market is returning to more normal 
times. Over a 10-year period, figures show the average time it takes to sell a 
home in California is 10 to 12 months, she said. 
</P>
<P>
That's probably small consolation to sellers who expected their homes to be on 
the market for several months at the most, only to find themselves having to 
endure long waits and price reductions. Redondo Beach broker Vince DeLuca said 
his office listed a home for $750,000 a year ago. Even though the owner has 
dropped the price more than $120,000, it is still on the market. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the most desireable areas of the Palos Verdes Peninsula, the pattern of 
long listings and reduced prices is being repeated. William Michel, a retired 
aerospace worker who lives in Palos Verdes Estates, put his five-bedroom home 
on the market in January for $697,500. Even though he has lowered the price to 
$664,500, he still hasn't had an offer. 
</P>
<P>
Michel, who has purchased another home in Oceanside contingent on his own home 
selling, says he is in a quandary over whether he should reduce his price 
further. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had a little crystal ball and could say very well what was going to 
happen, I might be interested in dropping (the price)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sellers willing to list their homes at a realistic price have a much better 
chance of getting an offer, agents said. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line as far as I am concerned is always the price," said the agent 
who did not want to be identified. "The main problem I feel is people don't 
want to concede prices have gone down." 
</P>
<P>
The agent said he refinanced his home last November; it was appraised at 
$390,000. "Right now I have run comparables and it looks like I would get 
$350,000," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The present market has produced its share of bargain hunters hoping to pick up 
a great deal, agents said. Nevertheless, the agents predict such buyers will be 
sorely disappointed if they are waiting for home prices to fall precipitously. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are waiting for the bottom to fall out, they are waiting in the wrong 
neighborhood," Collins said. "There just has never been any evidence of that in 
the South Bay."

POLICE DEPARTMENT STUDY HAS SOME OFFICERS WORRIED ABOUT A SHAKE-UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An effort by police administrators to "flatten the organization" of the San 
Diego Police Department and cut through nine layers of bureaucracy has many 
officers worried about their jobs, Assistant Police Chief Norm Stamper said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Stamper is leading a two-part study of the department that will begin with a 
management audit and then follow it with what is expected to be a 
reorganization of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Such a restructuring probably will be needed to keep police policies from 
getting distorted through the ranks of chief to patrol officer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The announcement has fueled a considerable amount of speculation of what the 
study is going to reveal and what recommendations are going to come out," he 
said. "It's reasonable to raise questions about how you flatten the 
organization and how it could have an effect on your job." 
</P>
<P>
Until he finishes the study, Stamper said he will not know whether anybody will 
lose jobs or be transferred into new slots. 
</P>
<P>
But the department, he said, "is looking at consequential change here; not just 
some cosmetic change that shuffles the same old deck. I'm not attempting to 
reassure anybody of anything." 
</P>
<P>
Stamper, the department's second in command, began the study earlier this month 
after Police Chief Bob Burgreen complained that his philosophy for the 
department wasn't being carried out, even after his two years in command. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen has a grand -- some say vague -- vision of the 1,850-person 
department. According to Stamper, Burgreen wants San Diego police to be the 
best in the business, do their jobs with "dignity and respect," be proud of 
their work, show spirit, avoid racism and sexism, and be mindful of San Diego 
citizens and their safety. 
</P>
<P>
That message doesn't always work its way down to the bottom, Stamper said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten more and more bureaucratic because of the numbers of ranks we 
have," he said. "The more levels you have, the less likely the bottom knows 
what the top is doing." 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department has a chief, assistant chief, four deputy chiefs, seven 
commanders, captains, lieutenants, sergeants, agents and police officers, 
including detectives, traffic officers and patrol officers. 
</P>
<P>
Talk of reshuffling has members of the department, whose officers are upset 
over charges of corruption and incompetence, concerned about their future, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police already are under attack from critics over questionable 
shootings -- 23 people have been shot this year, nine fatally. And a 
multi-agency task force looking into the murders of 43 women, mostly 
prostitutes and transients, is investigating possible police involvement with 
prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Burgreen asked Stamper to review the work of the task force. 
As a result, Stamper recommended splitting the task force into three groups: 
one that would deal with possible police corruption; another that would 
investigate all the murders; and a third that would look specifically at the 
murder of prostitute Donna Gentile, who had some involvement with police. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the department is grappling with the largest manhunt in its history. 
Homicide detectives are looking for a serial killer said to be responsible for 
the fatal stabbings of five women in the Clairemont-University City area since 
January. 
</P>
<P>
The city also is facing a record for homicides and other violent crime, 
statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen has separate internal department studies that are analyzing the 
department's lethal force procedures and its ethics policy. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen's announcement of the organizational study last week to a group of 
captains, commanders and deputy chiefs, ignited rumors. 
</P>
<P>
One captain told Stamper that he understood the department's six commander 
positions were being eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
The rumor was not surprising, Stamper said. Commanders are the most recent 
positions added in most police departments, and the position, between a captain 
and deputy chief, is often seen as unnecessary, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The rumors are one example of what Burgreen is trying to remedy, Stamper said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to create an organizational structure that minimizes distortions," he 
said. "We've got information between the chief to the cop on the beat and 
everyone in between colors it, shades it, and subtracts from it." 
</P>
<P>
Stamper said "flattening" could occur in any number of ways, most having to do 
with establishing a shorter chain of command. 
</P>
<P>
Stamper is familiar with such restructuring. His doctoral dissertation 
consisted of surveying 52 police chiefs and their assistants to find out if 
their policies were being carried out throughout the department. Most were not, 
Stamper found. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't because these were bad people. It was their god-awful structure," he 
said. "The administration and the cop on the beat are sometimes in two 
different worlds. If you run in administrative circles, you can never know the 
fears and concerns of the cop on the beat."

A 10-year-old girl was raped by a 13-year-old boy in her North Park home 
Thursday afternoon, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The attacker, who was still at large Thursday night, "is known to authorities," 
said Sgt. Fred England, a spokesman for the San Diego Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The assault occurred about 4:15 p.m. in the girl's home on Dale Street, near 
Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
The girl was taken to Children's Hospital for treatment, and the extent of her 
injuries was unknown, England said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Children's declined comment Thursday night.

A man arrested hours after a La Jolla robbery may be the Beachcomber Bandit, 
authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents dubbed the gunman in three robberies committed in the last month the 
Beachcomber Bandit because of his penchant for robbing coastal banks. 
</P>
<P>
James L. Savage, 42, was arrested at 2:30 p.m. Wednesday after a witness to the 
La Jolla robbery at 10:30 a.m. gave police a partial license plate number for 
the getaway car, a gray Mercedes-Benz, San Diego police spokesman Bill Robinson 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
More than $2,000 was taken from the Security Pacific Bank at University Towne 
Centre, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a witness to the robbery of a Del Mar bank told police of a gray 
Mercedes heading for the coast, Robinson said. Police began searching coastal 
motels and found a gray Mercedes stolen from Van Nuys at the Village Motel, 944 
Camino del Mar in Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
The motel's manager told police a man matching the description of the La Jolla 
bank robber had been living in Room 7 for about a month, Robinson said. 
Officers waited for Savage to come out of his room and arrested him. Armed with 
a search warrant for his room, they found a pistol, cash and clothing matching 
the description of those worn by the robber. 
</P>
<P>
Savage was turned over to FBI agents and is being held at the federal 
Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown San Diego.

Sheriff's candidate Jack Drown picked up the endorsement Thursday of Escondido 
Police Chief Vince Jimno and later accused his opponent's wife of campaigning 
for her husband while on company time for the nonprofit Building Industry Assn. 
of San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Drown, an assistant sheriff, is running against Sheriff's Capt. Jim Roache in 
the Nov. 6 election to succeed Sheriff John Duffy, who has held the job nearly 
20 years but is not seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Jimno, who ran for sheriff this year, did not make it past the June primary. In 
endorsing Drown, Jimno called him "a professional, seasoned, and knowledgeable 
law enforcement administrator . . . not a politician." 
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Drown sent the boss of Roache's wife, Jeanette, a letter that 
accused her of campaigning for her husband while working as a staff vice 
president for the BIA. The nonprofit group is a trade organization for builders 
and developers in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Drown said that, if Jeanette Roache worked for her husband on company time, it 
could jeopardize the BIA's nonprofit status. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Morris, the BIA's executive vice president, said he received Drown's letter 
and said he will assure Drown that Roache has worked on the campaign on her own 
time. He said Roache puts in 60 to 70 hours a week and is allowed compensatory 
time for other activities.

WEEKENDER: COME TO THE MUSIC FAIR, WHERE EVERY TASTE WILL BE SATISFIED. 
</P>

The Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra is usually seen in formal attire, giving 
concerts on the stage of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But on Sunday, the musicians and conductor David Alan Miller will exchange 
black ties for sport shirts and sweaters and fill the Chadwick School campus 
with music during the daylong Peninsula Music Fair. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a great audience from the South Bay, and this is both a way of 
reaching new people down there and a kind of thank-you to the community," said 
Ann Giesler, volunteer activities coordinator for the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Although the philharmonic will be Sunday's star attraction, it's only one item 
on a rich musical bill of fare that will be served continuously between 10:30 
a.m. and 5 p.m. There will be marches, jazz, singing and chamber music, plus 
ethnic dancing, puppetry, country-Western sounds, and an appearance by popular 
jazz pianist and composer David Benoit. 
</P>
<P>
Children will have a "Musicland" all their own, where they will be able not 
only to enjoy performances but also to make musical instruments and play along 
with some of the entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
Local restaurants and markets will have food booths featuring all-American 
hamburgers and hot dogs as well as Chinese beef and broccoli and Southwestern 
gourmet plates. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a wonderful day to enjoy music, a family day of festivities with 
absolutely everything to satisfy all tastes," fair chairwoman Mary Diels said. 
The event has been staged for 18 years by the philharmonic's Peninsula 
Committee, a support group for the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's fair raised $45,000 for the orchestra, and $6,000 for music 
education programs the committee sponsors for schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
The fair will spread across the large, sloping Chadwick campus with its lawns 
and shade trees. Visitors can stretch out on blankets, taking in the music as 
they sample the food and drink on sale or picnics brought from home. 
</P>
<P>
Performers will be seen on two outdoor stages and in the school amphitheater, 
where Benoit will appear at 2 p.m. and the philharmonic at 3:30. Chamber groups 
will play indoors in Seeley Mudd Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"It's relaxed and there's music everywhere. What is so fun about it is that it 
is so casual," said Pattee Schlatter, publicity chairman for the fair. 
</P>
<P>
The day will get off to a rousing start with music by a unit of the USC 
Marching Band. Later, the 12 dancers and musicians of the Aman Folk Ensemble 
will demonstrate dances from Yugoslavia, Morocco, Turkey's Black Sea coast and 
American Appalachia. From Russia, instrumentalist Emanuil Sheynkman will 
perform on the balalaika. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of chamber groups with flute, guitar, cello and strings will perform 
the classics, and Smokewood will offer a blend of bluegrass and country. 
</P>
<P>
"Musicland" will give youngsters their own entertainment lineup, including the 
Jim Gamble Puppets, folk singer and storyteller Sam Hinton and the Le Tigre 
Steel Drum Band. 
</P>
<P>
Another attraction will be the Music Mobile, a van filled with musical 
instruments that the Peninsula Committee takes to South Bay schools. Youngsters 
-- even those smaller than a cello -- will be able to see and touch a variety 
of instruments and learn about symphonic music. 
</P>
<P>
Children will also be able to turn cans and cardboard into drums, flutes and 
maracas. They'll then join Hinton and the Le Tigre band to play on stage. 
</P>
<P>
With nearly 4,000 people expected during the day, free parking will be 
available at the Palos Verdes Landfill on Crenshaw Boulevard just north of 
Palos Verdes Drive North. There will be continuous free shuttle service to the 
Chadwick campus. 
</P>
<P>
Planning and staging the fair is a labor of love for the 120 active members of 
the support committee, Diels said. And fair day also has become one that many 
people mark on their calendars year after year. 
</P>
<P>
Said Diels: "Some fair-goers have never missed a fair. Our view is that once 
someone comes to the fair, we capture them for life. Even if they're not a 
terrific music lover, just the ambience, the festivity, the lovely campus and 
the rolling hills keep them coming back." GERALD FARIS

70 HORSE-DRAWN VEHICLES THAT FILL HIS OAK VIEW BARN.

John F. Morgan is working hard to bring the horse-and-buggy days back to 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, who started restoring old stagecoaches and other horse-drawn vehicles 
15 years ago as a hobby, now makes his living at it. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does he scour the country looking for old buggies and other relics 
from the past to polish up, he manufactures his own line of horse-drawn 
Petaluma carts for a clientele that includes actors Robert Wagner and Richard 
Widmark. 
</P>
<P>
Pausing by the silver-plated rails of an 1865 hearse he restored, the owner of 
the Morgan Carriage Works swept his eyes proudly this week over more than 70 
horse-drawn vehicles that fill his Oak View barn. 
</P>
<P>
"It began as a hobby and it kind of got out of hand," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, 55, was born in Arkansas and raised in Santa Paula. He managed the Vons 
grocery store in Ventura and owned two grocery markets in the Ojai Valley 
before turning full-time to the buggy business in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
As a child, Morgan recalls, he always wanted to have a horse, but his parents 
could not afford one. That memory gives him special pride because last weekend, 
with a 1903 buckboard he restored, his family won the sweepstakes prize at the 
Porterville Stage Coach Stampede. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I was born 100 years too late," Morgan says of his love affair with a 
gasoline-free form of transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Similar sentiments are shared by many others attracted to the new sport of 
buggy-driving that has begun gaining popularity in competitions throughout 
Southern California, Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
The growing popularity of old-fashioned buggy rides has created a demand for 
the two-wheel Petaluma cars he now manufactures, with prices beginning at 
$1,500. 
</P>
<P>
Although the private Morgan carriage collection is seldom shown outside the 
Morgans' barn, board members of the Ojai Valley Historical Society talked the 
family into displaying a dozen of their more unique horse-drawn vehicles from 4 
to 6 p.m. Saturday at the Ojai Valley Museum. 
</P>
<P>
The $5 admission price to the outdoor display and reception will benefit the 
museum's expansion fund. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan's buggy business is a family enterprise. His wife, Connie, sons Pat and 
Jim and three full-time employees complete the staff. 
</P>
<P>
"The most difficult part is getting a finished paint coat. Paint is always so 
important, like with a car," Morgan said. "But we're using modern materials 
because you simply can't get the old materials, and we really don't want to use 
lead-based paint." 
</P>
<P>
Traveling around the country to auctions, the Morgans have come home with 
buggies, buckboards, Irish jaunting carts, governess carts that nannies once 
used on country outings and even a replica of a Conestoga wagon, the freight 
car of the 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an Amish man in Pennsylvania who calls us collect from his neighbor 
because he doesn't have a phone," Morgan said of one of his scouts, whose 
religious sect has kept horse-drawn vehicles in daily use because of its 
abhorrence of automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
While most of the horse-drawn vehicles he collects are for sale, Morgan tends 
to view some of his assorted buggies and wagons as a private collection. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of vehicles I'm in love with that I just hate to sell, a lot of 
unrestored junkers," Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
He has little time, however, for restoring his private collection. The family 
is inundated with restoration requests and cart orders, and also provides 
carriage rides and hayrides for wedding parties, schools and church groups. 
</P>
<P>
The Morgans' neighbors never know what type of vehicle family members will 
test-drive next along the rural Riverside Road with their three registered 
Morgan horses. 
</P>
<P>
'My wife always wanted a Morgan, that's why she picked me," Morgan jokes of his 
childhood sweetheart, raised in Fillmore, who helped run Ven-Oak and Corner 
Markets in Oak View before the couple sold them five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Now she handles the quality control, upholstery and the business bookkeeping, 
Morgan said. Their son Pat, 29, took welding classes in school and became a 
certified welder for another firm before his father urged him to work at home. 
</P>
<P>
Although father and son say they are probably earning minimum wage for the 
number of hours they put into their work, they both speak of great satisfaction 
in seeking a finished product. 
</P>
<P>
"Each piece is almost a work of art," Pat Morgan said. "When it's finished you 
have a product that is usually taken care of and will be around for a number of 
years." 
</P>
<P>
This month they are restoring a doctor's carriage for Moorpark College and just 
completed renovating a mud-wagon, a lightweight stagecoach with canvas sides, 
for the Gene Autry Museum in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"He was my idol when I was six years old," the elder Morgan said of the singing 
cowboy. 
</P>
<P>
Now Morgan's son is also dressing in period costumes to compete in three-day 
driving competitions that include intricate arena maneuvers and timed, 10-mile 
cross-country marathons around obstacles such as trees and hay bales. 
</P>
<P>
After winning second place in the training division of a recent event in 
Rolling Hills, the younger Morgan noted with irony, "The guy that won first 
place was in one of our carts." 
</P>
<P>
Buggy riding is becoming more popular, he said, because people are finding out 
that two to four people can enjoy a riding experience with just one horse. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of elderly people who enjoy horses and can't get in the saddle can drive 
a buggy without getting too sore," he added.

EX-SERGEANT RECALLS MONEY SKIMMING; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: SOBEL SAYS DEPUTIES PLANTED EVIDENCE AND SET ASIDE MONEY FROM ARRESTS. 
HE ALSO TESTIFIES HE TOOK UP TO $22,000 FROM A SINGLE DRUG SEIZURE.

<P>
A former sheriff's sergeant testified Thursday that he personally skimmed as 
much as $22,000 from a single drug seizure and that his elite team of deputies 
often planted evidence on suspects, wrote false police reports and committed 
perjury. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Sobel, a 20-year Sheriff's Department veteran who has pleaded guilty in 
the case, was testifying for the prosecution in the trial of seven deputies, 
six of whom were under his command. 
</P>
<P>
Sobel, 45, detailed cases in which he and the deputies set aside cash for a 
slush fund they referred to as "the kitty." 
</P>
<P>
Sobel said he was the sergeant in charge of the department's Lennox station 
narcotics crew in 1985 when he first skimmed money from a 49-pound marijuana 
bust. He testified he took $400 and used the money to buy entry tools for his 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Sobel said members of the Lennox crew took money from arrests on 20 to 30 
occasions in 1985 and 1986, including a Paramount heroin case in which they 
took more than $3,000 and used it to buy guns. 
</P>
<P>
Sobel testified that the largest amount of money he took from a single arrest 
was $22,000, his share of the cash seized in a Beverly Hills bust in October, 
1986, while head of the department's Southwest narcotics crew. He said he spent 
the money on personal expenses, including a $5,000 payment on his wife's car. 
</P>
<P>
Sobel, who is in the federal witness protection program, also told of instances 
in which deputies planted drugs, phony evidence, wrote false police reports and 
used excessive force against suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas A. Hagemann, Sobel recalled a 
December, 1987, conversation in a Santa Fe Springs bar with deputies Daniel 
Garner and Bobby Juarez. 
</P>
<P>
Garner, who is one of the deputies indicted, allegedly told Sobel that "1988 
was going to be our year," Sobel said. According to Sobel's testimony, Garner 
said he had custody of the "kitty," and that it contained several thousand 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"(Garner) said, 'I've been watching you. You're a stand-up guy. We can all be 
rich. All you have to do is look the other way,' " Sobel testified. 
</P>
<P>
Sobel, the prosecution's key witness, was indicted along with 10 other deputies 
and one of the deputies' wives in February in the worst corruption scandal to 
strike the nation's largest sheriff's department. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Garner, the other deputies on trial are Terrell Amers, James 
Bauder, John Dickenson, Eufrasio Cortez, Ronald Daub and Macario Duran. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies Nancy Brown and Michael Kalinterna face a separate trial. 
</P>
<P>
Sobel began his testimony late Wednesday, describing how he watched as one 
narcotics officer dumped hundreds of thousands of dollars on a bed and divided 
the cash to steal during an FBI sting. 
</P>
<P>
He told jurors that the deputies who had been shadowing what they thought was a 
drug trafficker on Aug. 30, 1989, targeted the cash in a pattern familiar to 
his narcotics squad. 
</P>
<P>
"The protocol was that the investigating officer would make the call if money 
was to be skimmed or not," said Sobel, who began what is expected to be several 
days of testimony. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies are on trial in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on charges of 
stealing more than $1.4 million in cash seized from suspected drug dealers and 
money launderers. 
</P>
<P>
Sobel is viewed by prosecutors and defense attorneys as the trial's most 
important single witness, and his brief appearance Wednesday was the most 
dramatic in the weeklong proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
Sobel told jurors of his 19 years in the Sheriff's Department, then moved 
quickly through a description of the FBI sting -- and how the narcotics 
officers were tracking what they believed was an East Coast drug trafficker 
carrying about $500,000 in cash. The supposed drug dealer turned out to be an 
FBI agent. 
</P>
<P>
In describing their raid on the hotel suite, Sobel said the deputies detained 
the suspected dealer and then took hundreds of thousands of dollars that had 
been found in the suite. Although the sting had been videotaped -- and portions 
of it shown earlier to the jurors -- FBI surveillance cameras did not capture 
any footage of what Sobel said was deputies taking the money into a nearby 
hotel room from which they had conducted their surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
Inside that room, Sobel said, Brown -- who was the investigating officer in the 
case -- dumped the cash on the bed and began counting what Sobel said was more 
than $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Nancy separated the money. She separated a large pile of money," Sobel 
recalled. "She said this is what we will book (as evidence) and put the rest in 
a small bag." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys were quick to challenge Sobel's account. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney for Brown disputed the former sergeant's testimony in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a highly questionable guy with credibility problems," said Roger 
Hanson, referring to FBI interviews in which Sobel has acknowledged involvement 
in planting drugs on some suspects and beating others. 
</P>
<P>
Another defendant, Bauder, who Sobel said had earlier grabbed bundles of cash 
from the hotel suite in an attempt to steal the money, also vehemently denied 
Sobel's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"He is lying through his teeth," Bauder said of his former boss. "And I intend 
to take the stand to challenge and refute what he says." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that Sobel and the other narcotics officers skimmed $48,000 
that night from $498,000 in bags in the hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Sobel's testimony Wednesday, the jurors heard from a parade of 
federal agents who described seizing nearly $85,000 in cash, as well as 
financial records, cars, boats, jewelry and other valuables from the deputies' 
homes and businesses in Southern California and Arizona. Included in the seized 
cash was $19,680 in marked money from the sting, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Duran's wife, Maria, was a defendant until Wednesday when Judge Edward Rafeedie 
severed her case from the others. 
</P>
<P>
However, only hours later, federal prosecutors indicted Maria Duran, her 
husband and her mother for allegedly conspiring to obstruct the money-skimming 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The criminal indictment claims that the Durans and Maria's mother, Lilia 
Vazquez, attempted to conceal the source of an $88,500 down payment on a 
Northridge home by telling federal investigators that Vazquez had loaned the 
money to the couple. Vazquez, 60, was also accused of lying to a federal grand 
jury about the source of the money. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Duran's attorney, Scott Furstman, called the indictment "just one more 
attempt by the government to bring pressure on the Durans" to cooperate with 
the government and undermine her husband's defense.

DEPUTIES' SKIMMING OF DRUG MONEY TOLD; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: EX-SERGEANT SAYS MEN UNDER HIS COMMAND ALSO ROUTINELY BEAT SUSPECTS AND 
FALSIFIED REPORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MERINA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
The principal witness in the money-skimming trial of seven Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies testified Thursday that narcotics officers under his command 
routinely beat drug suspects, falsified reports and skimmed hundreds of 
thousands of dollars during drug raids. 
</P>
<P>
Ex-Sheriff's Sgt. Robert R. Sobel, who supervised three narcotics teams over a 
four-year period, told a federal jury that officers also planted drugs on 
suspects, perjured themselves and maintained "slush funds" with money skimmed 
from drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
When Sobel said he once threatened to stop the thefts, a deputy scoffed at his 
suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked at me and said, 'You can't stop it,' " Sobel told jurors. "'None of 
the other sergeants could stop it. We'll just do it behind your back.' " 
</P>
<P>
The testimony of Sobel, who has pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with 
federal prosecutors, provided the first detailed, public disclosure of a 
corruption scandal that has rocked the nation's largest sheriff's department 
and threatens other local law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
In his daylong appearance, the 45-year-old Sobel told jurors that he received 
more than $140,000 in stolen drug money as a member of the elite narcotics 
investigations team that is now on trial in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
As he described how drug traffickers and money couriers were targeted, Sobel 
implicated each of the defendants -- Deputies Terrell H. Amers, James R. 
Bauder, Eufrasio G. Cortez, Ronald E. Daub, John C. Dickenson, Daniel M. Garner 
and Macario M. Duran -- as part of the money-skimming ring. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Sobel said that in March, 1989, he and other members of the major 
narcotics investigations team obtained a search warrant for the Pico Rivera 
home of a suspected drug dealer. After discovering 28 kilos of cocaine in the 
garage, Sobel said, one of the officers also found a box of money in a locked 
closet and turned it over to the sergeant. Sobel then skimmed some of the money 
for his crew. 
</P>
<P>
"I took a couple of bundles (of money) to my car and stuffed them in the kit 
bag in the trunk," said Sobel, who added that he received $3,000 from the 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
In a December, 1988, raid, Sobel said, deputies found money stashed in a car 
stereo box at a house in Wilmington. He testified that Cortez skimmed some of 
the money, before bagging the rest as evidence. The next day at the parking lot 
of the narcotics bureau headquarters, Sobel said, Cortez handed him his share 
of the money. 
</P>
<P>
"Deputy Cortez said, 'Here's your Christmas bonus,' " Sobel testified. 
</P>
<P>
Six months earlier, Sobel said, the deputies had "jammed," or detained, another 
suspected drug trafficker after trailing him from Malibu to downtown Los 
Angeles. The deputies seized more than $1 million in cash, Sobel said. Then, 
two of the deputies drove off to an undisclosed location and removed hundreds 
of thousands of dollars, he testified. The next day, in the headquarters 
parking lot, Sobel said, Daub walked up with a shopping bag full of money to 
give him. 
</P>
<P>
" 'I took so much it scared me,' " Sobel quoted Daub as saying. 
</P>
<P>
When he opened the bag, Sobel said, he found $50,000. Asked what he did with 
the money, Sobel replied: "I spent it as fast as I can." 
</P>
<P>
In all, Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas A. Hagemann took Sobel through 19 drug 
cases in 1988 and 1989 where money was allegedly stolen by deputies and had 
Sobel recite how he spent the stolen cash on such luxuries as a sailboat, grand 
piano, big-screen television, automobiles and $15,000 on home improvements. 
</P>
<P>
In describing his participation in thefts that ranged from several thousand 
dollars to $500,000, Sobel made it clear that it was his deputies -- acting 
individually as the chief investigator in each case -- who actually stole most 
of the money and merely gave Sobel his share. 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorneys, who will cross-examine Sobel today, disputed his story. 
</P>
<P>
"His testimony is not to be believed," said Jay Lichtman, Daub's attorney, "and 
I don't think the jury will believe him." 
</P>
<P>
Vicki Podberesky, Bauder's attorney, said that her client is eager to take the 
stand and challenge Sobel's characterizations that Bauder helped skim money -- 
and in one allegation, planted narcotics on a drug suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to say that none of that happened," the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
The drug-planting and theft allegations were not relegated to the major crew, 
Sobel said. He testified that narcotics officers at the Lennox Sheriff's 
Station, where he worked earlier, also stole drug money to feed a "kitty" or 
"slush fund" that paid for tools, guns and other items for deputies. Sobel said 
he participated in 20 to 30 such thefts, but could not remember how much money 
he stole while at Lennox. 
</P>
<P>
Later, when he was promoted as supervisor of another anti-narcotics team, known 
as the Southwest Crew, Sobel said, he received $50,000 in stolen drug money and 
that team members beat suspects regularly, planted narcotics on suspects and 
lied about their activities. 
</P>
<P>
Sobel named Los Angeles Police Officer Steven Polak, who was one of four LAPD 
officers on the Southwest crew, as one officer who planted drugs on a suspect. 
But Polak, through his attorney, denied the assertion. 
</P>
<P>
"The allegations against Mr. Polak are a bunch of malarkey coming from the 
mouth of an admitted felon," said lawyer David Wiechert, whose client, Polak, 
has been reassigned to a desk job. 
</P>
<P>
While testifying Thursday, Sobel seldom looked at his former deputies as he 
painted an unflattering portrait of the officers bickering over money, engaging 
in racial slurs, growing suspicious of one another and spending extravagantly 
-- including $3,200 in cash for a Christmas dinner for deputies and their 
wives. 
</P>
<P>
Sobel, however, faltered when he described how federal agents searched his 
Westminster home on Sept. 1, 1989, and failed to find $12,000 in stolen drug 
money he had hidden in an oak desk. 
</P>
<P>
After the agents left, Sobel said, he waited until dark and then took the 
money, drove to Seal Beach and "threw it into the ocean." He then went to his 
sailboat, Sobel said, and contemplated suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to kill myself," he said choking back tears. "I decided to face 
the music." 
</P>
<P>
In his agreement with prosecutors, Sobel pleaded guilty to single counts of 
conspiracy and tax evasion, paid a $28,000 fine and forfeited the items he 
purchased with stolen drug cash. Sobel also was told he would not be prosecuted 
for other crimes if he cooperated with the government. 
</P>
<P>
As part of that arrangement, Sobel said, he secretly tape-recorded a meeting on 
Sept. 25, 1989, with several deputies. Portions of the recording from that 
meeting were played Thursday to jurors who had to wear headphones to listen to 
the largely unintelligible tape. 
</P>
<P>
What they heard were the suspended deputies grousing about the government 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen a case yet where a deputy or where a guy got done (convicted) 
where another deputy didn't testify against him," said Bauder at one point. 
"They ain't got a (expletive) chance unless somebody gets up on the (expletive) 
stand, and in this case they got to corroborate it. . . ."

U.S. MAY OVERRIDE STATE BAN OF OTTERS; 
</P>
<P>
WILDLIFE: A FEDERAL AGENCY INSISTS ON SENDING 18 MORE ANIMALS TO SAN NICOLAS. 
BUT CALIFORNIA OFFICIALS SAY THE PLAN FOR A COLONY HAS FAILED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Federal and state agencies may be headed for a showdown over whether more 
threatened California sea otters will be moved to San Nicolas Island. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service official said Thursday that the agency plans 
to override a state directive and move up to 18 more otters from the main 
Northern California population to remote San Nicolas Island, 60 miles southwest 
of Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
The state Fish and Game Commission told the federal government in August that 
its three-year program had failed to set up a spinoff otter colony to preserve 
the species in the event the main population is wiped out by an oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also rejected a federal request for a permit to move 18 more 
animals, which have radio implants inside their abdominal cavities, to the 
island. 
</P>
<P>
Since the $3-million program began, 137 otters have been captured and moved to 
San Nicolas Island, but only about 15 otters remain. Another 30 have swum back 
to their home range, a 200-mile stretch of coastal water off the Monterey 
Peninsula. Nine have been found dead and 80 are unaccounted for. 
</P>
<P>
But the program is not a failure, said Marvin L. Plenert, Fish and Wildlife 
Service regional director. Scientists need more time and more animals to study 
to complete their research, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Plenert said he will send a letter today advising the state of his agency's 
plan to go forward with the relocation program. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe we have the authority to go through with this," Plenert said from 
his regional headquarters in Oregon. "I'm just going to flat tell them that we 
plan to do it." 
</P>
<P>
The Fish and Wildlife Service must still obtain approval from its permits 
section and a separate board, the Marine Mammals Commission, Plenert said. But 
he said the state Fish and Game Commission should be advised of the plan 
upfront. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Treanor, the state Fish and Game Commission's executive officer, 
predicted Thursday that the five commissioners, a board appointed by Gov. 
George Deukmejian, will object to moving more animals to the island. 
</P>
<P>
"The commission felt that the goals and objectives had not been met," Treanor 
said of the federal relocation program. "The commission was very concerned with 
the number of otters that were unaccounted for, so they didn't want to add to 
the mortality of the otter population." 
</P>
<P>
Treanor said he planned to approach the state attorney general's office on the 
commission's options for preventing the probable federal action. 
</P>
<P>
Plenert said in August that his agency planned to comply with the state's ban 
on moving more otters to the island. But he said he changed his mind after the 
Fish and Wildlife Service's Sea Otter Recovery Team, a group of marine 
biologists and scientists who advise the service on sea otters, recommended 
that the program be continued. 
</P>
<P>
"The scientists are the experts," Plenert said. 
</P>
<P>
Only one otter now has a radio transmitter implanted inside its abdominal 
cavity. But more animals with radio transmitters need to be moved to the island 
so that scientists can better study the animals' habits, said Carl Benz, the 
Fish and Wildlife Service's sea otter recovery coordinator based in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that otters are very individualistic," he said. "So we need a broad 
sampling of behavior." 
</P>
<P>
California sea otters once numbered 20,000 before they were driven to near 
extinction by fur traders at the turn of the century. The population had 
numbered almost 1,900 in 1989, but a count this spring showed a 10% decline to 
1,678 otters. Benz said scientists are not sure whether the decline is real or 
a result of faulty counting techniques. 
</P>
<P>
The California commercial fishing lobby contends that the sea otter population 
in Northern California is recovering and objects to the transfer of more of the 
shellfish-eating animals to the waters off San Nicolas, a prime abalone and sea 
urchin fishery. 
</P>
<P>
"The more there are out there, the more they eat," said Diane Pleschner, a 
contributing editor of a commercial fishing trade industry publication. 
</P>
<P>
Plus, tagged otters from San Nicolas have been sighted off other Channel 
Islands, officials said. Pleschner said the Fish and Wildlife Service should 
keep animals at San Nicolas and out of other commercial fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
"If they transfer more out there, we lose shellfish resources," Pleschner said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JURORS IMPANELED IN 'COTTON CLUB' DRUG CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A jury was impaneled in Los Angeles on Thursday in the trial of a reputed 
cocaine dealer and three alleged hit men charged with murdering a New York 
producer in a dispute over financing of the movie "The Cotton Club." 
</P>
<P>
The Superior Court jury of nine women and three men as well as six alternate 
jurors, all women, was selected over a month's time. 
</P>
<P>
Opening statements in the trial are scheduled for Oct. 31. Final pretrial 
motions will be argued until then. 
</P>
<P>
On trial are a reputed major West Coast cocaine dealer, Karen De Layne 
Greenberger, 42, formerly of Sherman Oaks, and three former bodyguards for 
Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt: Alex Marti, 29, of Sherman Oaks, 
William Mentzer, 39, of Canoga Park, and Robert Ulmer Lowe, 44, of Rockville, 
Md. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that Greenberger hired the reputed hit men to kill New York 
theatrical producer Roy Radin, 33, whose decayed and bullet-riddled body was 
found in June, 1983, in rural Gorman.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOMB DAMAGES TRUCK AT GRAVEL COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A homemade bomb damaged a tractor-trailer truck at a Canyon Country gravel 
company Wednesday night, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred at 7:40 p.m. at the P.W. Gillibrand Co. in the 13000 
block of Lang Station Road, said Deputy Hal Grant. 
</P>
<P>
The company was closed at the time, and there were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb had been placed between the engine and the cab and caused "moderate to 
extensive" damage, Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
A dispatcher for Gillibrand said the company had not received any threats and 
that the vehicle belonged to a Palmdale man. "He parks his truck here at 
night," said dispatcher Jo May, adding six trucks are normally parked in the 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
Last week a pipe bomb was found at the California Highway Patrol scales on the 
northbound Antelope Valley Freeway near Via Princessa. The bomb was removed and 
there were no injuries. "There doesn't appear to be any relation between the 
two," said Sheriff's Department investigator Gary Stuart.

As so often happens with the HOLLYWOOD sign, El Segundo's less-legendary UNSAFE 
FOR JETS sign was covered up Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But Caltech pranksters weren't responsible. The El Segundo City Council was. 
</P>
<P>
The sign was covered only because Los Angeles International Airport is 
beginning a four-month experiment: Departing pilots will be required to delay 
the start of their left-hand turns until they're about a mile offshore. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, they could head south when they reached the shoreline, but El 
Segundo officials claimed that the pilots often turned earlier -- and flew over 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
The cover-up of the hillside sign, which was unveiled in 1988, could become 
permanent if the LAX policy becomes permanent, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
While UNSAFE FOR JETS might seem like an extreme message, it was muted compared 
to others that were considered. 
</P>
<P>
Among the rejects was: 
</P>
<P>
TURN AT THE COASTLINE, STUPID. 
</P>
<P>
The Lighting World convention opened this week, and you knew it had to happen. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors at the L.A. Convention Center Thursday beheld a cornucopia of light 
fixtures of every type and hue set out by manufacturers. And then the lights 
went out. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything in the place was dark for about 15 minutes," said publicist Ray 
Rosenbaum. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, several of the conventioneers were stocked with an older industry 
innovation that got them through the power outage: 
</P>
<P>
Flashlights. 
</P>
<P>
The theaters at Fallbrook Mall near Woodland Hills were showing mostly 
shoot-'em- and/or knife-'em-ups like "GoodFellas," "Pacific Heights" and "White 
Hunter, Black Heart." 
</P>
<P>
Up to the box office stepped a couple in their 60s. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you have senior citizens' rates?" asked the man. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly do," he was told. 
</P>
<P>
"Then two tickets please," said the man. "For Fantasia." 
</P>
<P>
There were no grandchildren in sight. 
</P>
<P>
While the controversy over smoking in L.A. restaurants continues, Milt Kagen of 
Hollywood writes to say that it's time to begin a crusade for a new sanctuary: 
</P>
<P>
Smoke-free rental cars. 
</P>
<P>
Kagen fumes about climbing into stinky cars. He sees it as "smokers' revenge -- 
smokers who sit for hours on nonsmoking airplanes then light up as soon as they 
are in the cars." 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, this is a nonsmoking column. Those who wish to smoke should turn 
to the weather page. 
</P>
<P>
Does it seem as though the days fly by faster every year? Well, writer Elliot 
Zwiebach may have found some real supporting evidence. He reports he received a 
subscription offer from Backstage Magazine, which declared that it publishes 
"each and every week, 51 times a year." 
</P>

obtains its supplies from Northern California. Thus, even the tap water in 
Beverly Hills is imported.

BILL BOYARSKY: FARRELL'S VOTE A SMOKE SIGNAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Farrell has always been a dependable pro-business vote on the Los Angeles 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
It makes political sense. The predominantly black and Latino constituents of 
his South-Central Los Angeles district, ranging from desperately poor to 
working class, are struggling in a difficult economy. Farrell, a black 
councilman, has felt they need jobs, not environmental schemes that may put 
employers out of business. 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, Farrell said no to two very big businesses, the tobacco 
industry and Los Angeles' restaurants, which employ many of his constituents. 
He voted to ban smoking in restaurants. "For me it was a significant shift," 
Farrell said later. 
</P>
<P>
In the short run, Farrell's vote didn't make much difference. The ban failed on 
a 6-6 vote, two shy of the eight needed for passage. But the switch of this 
solidly pro-business councilman was noteworthy. It can be interpreted as a sign 
-- albeit an early one -- of a political and social change in black 
neighborhoods, which are besieged by high rates of heart disease, hypertension 
and cancer, all of them linked to smoking. 
</P>
<P>
It's true there's more to the restaurant smoking ban than jobs vs. health. To 
nonsmoking Councilman Michael Woo, who voted against the measure, it's a matter 
of personal freedom. "People have an opportunity to choose where they eat out," 
he told me after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
But personal freedom wasn't the issue on Farrell's mind. It was the more 
agonizing choice of either possibly closing down restaurants where his 
constituents work and offending some major political supporters, or trusting 
his instincts in detecting a fundamental change in his district. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Farrell has been on the City Council since the mid-'70s, arriving as a 
young politician of great promise. At UCLA in the '60s, he had wanted to go 
into journalism. But newspapers weren't hiring many -- if any -- blacks in 
those days, so Farrell went into politics. 
</P>
<P>
I was impressed by his political smarts when we met while he was working in Tom 
Bradley's campaign for mayor in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Today, though, it's clear watching Farrell that the pressures of dealing with 
constituents and other council members have taken a toll. He flails at a 
variety of issues. Fascinated with global and national matters, he seems more 
interested in Africa than Slauson Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Although Farrell is famous for inconsistency, support of job-producing business 
has been a career constant. That has won him the support of lobbyists for 
builders, restaurants, oil, tobacco, construction and others with business at 
City Hall. The alliance has paid off. In fact, he told me the tobacco companies 
have been among his political supporters. 
</P>
<P>
The latest vote, he said, came as the result of a new attitude in his 
community. In part, he said, the attitude has been fostered by the U.S. 
Secretary of Health and Welfare, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, who is black. Sullivan 
has campaigned relentlessly against smoking and the cigarette advertising 
campaigns that target the black community. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a person of African-American heritage who is on a crusade on health 
issues," Farrell said, "and he's forcing us to look at those issues as never 
before." 
</P>
<P>
A letter from Sullivan was on the top of a packet of anti-smoking material 
handed out to council members before the vote by the smoking ban's author, 
Councilman Marvin Braude. 
</P>
<P>
Also included were two studies by Environmental Protection Agency scientists 
warning of secondhand smoke. For nonsmokers, they said, inhaling secondhand 
smoke is like smoking three low-tar cigarettes a day. They said it caused about 
5,000 lung cancer deaths a year in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of Sullivan and the figures did it for Farrell. 
</P>
<P>
It's true that one vote doesn't make a movement. The issue will be before the 
City Council again and Farrell will be under heavy pressure from his old 
tobacco industry pals to change. And Councilman Nate Holden, from the adjacent 
district, opposed the ban. Obviously, not all of South Los Angeles agrees with 
Farrell. 
</P>
<P>
But I think he's on the right track. All through the district, you see a new 
consciousness of health. In churches and community centers, there are posters 
advertising no-smoking clinics and classes on diet and stress control. 
Ministers promote the classes from the pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
There is an understanding, as Farrell's vote indicated, that a job isn't worth 
much without good health. And wouldn't it be something if all neighborhoods 
were free from having to choose between the two?

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN ARRESTED AT COUNCIL MEETING ON PARTY 
FRACAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A debate at a South Pasadena City Council meeting over police conduct turned 
ugly when an elderly resident was arrested for allegedly threatening the police 
association's attorney and kicking another woman he apparently mistook for the 
attorney, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
James H. Hulse, 68, was placed under citizen's arrest on suspicion of assault, 
battery and disturbing a public meeting shortly after the fracas at 11:30 p.m. 
Wednesday, Lt. Richard Kowaltschuk said. 
</P>
<P>
He was released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The hubbub occurred as Sylvia E. Kellison, attorney for the South Pasadena 
Police Officers Assn., was criticizing the council for hiring a private 
investigator to look into allegations of police misconduct while officers were 
breaking up a drinking party last month. Hulse apparently objected to the 
remarks and allegedly cocked his arm as if to punch Kellison. He later kicked 
the leg of an unidentified woman who apparently resembled Kellison, authorities 
said.

A Newhall woman who was attempting to burn her husband's clothes in a barbecue 
after an argument critically burned herself Thursday and badly damaged her 
house, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Sue Dittmann, 32, was in critical condition at County-USC Medical Center

estimated at $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
Dittmann told county firefighters that she had argued with her husband, whom 
she is divorcing, and decided to burn his clothes. She took an armful of 
clothes to the barbecue on the front porch of the house and used lighter fluid 
to ignite them.

<P>
Vice detectives infiltrated a meeting in Canoga Park and arrested 17 people 
suspected of operating an illegal "pyramid" scam, Los Angeles police said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
According to detectives, participants put in $500 and got back as much as 
$16,000 after drawing acquaintances into the meeting to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
The operation depends entirely on a continuous cycle of new investors to be 
successful. When the flow of investors dries up, those who joined most recently 
lose out, Sgt. Mark Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said 115 people were in the meeting hall when undercover officers 
stopped the meeting. Investigators interviewed the participants and arrested 
the alleged leaders of the operation on suspicion of promoting an "endless 
chain," a misdemeanor. They were all booked and released, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the arrests came shortly after one of the group's leaders 
announced, "This is not a Tupperware party. . . . We are here to make money. 
Lots of money."

<P>
The developer of the Playa Vista development settled a longstanding dispute 
with environmental groups over preservation of the Ballona Wetlands on 
Thursday, paving the way for the giant residential and commercial project to 
proceed with applications for city, county and state approval. The development 
site is a square-mile tract between Marina del Rey and the Westchester bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the settlement, 269 acres of land will be set aside and 
restored as a marshland. The developer, Maguire Thomas Partners, will pay $10 
million toward restoring the area and unspecified legal fees for the groups 
that brought suit in 1984, headed by Friends of Ballona Wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
The city, county and state Coastal Commission are among those still involved in 
the lawsuit, but the allegiance between the developer and the environmental 
groups is expected to be a key factor in gaining support for the project.

S&amp;LS GAVE $513,000 TO ASSEMBLYMAN BANE IN '80S;

<P>
FUND RAISING: THAT WAS MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE LEGISLATOR RECEIVED FROM THE 
INDUSTRY, FOR WHICH HE IS A LONGTIME CHAMPION.

<P>
Assemblyman Tom Bane (D-Van Nuys), a longtime champion of the savings and loan 
industry, received $513,000 in campaign contributions from thrifts -- more than 
any other state legislator in the 1980s, according to a survey released 
Thursday by two public-interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the survey said, savings and loans in the last decade contributed $4.1 
million to state lawmakers, including at least $216,000 to Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), $214,000 to Senate President Pro Tem David A. 
Roberti (D-Los Angeles) and $154,000 to former Assembly Republican Leader Pat 
Nolan (R-Glendale). 
</P>
<P>
The survey, called "Clearance Sale of the Decade: The Role of California's 
Elected Officials in the Savings and Loan Scandal," was released at press 
conferences here and in Los Angeles by the public advocacy group California 
Common Cause, and by Public Citizen, a consumer group formed by Ralph Nader. 
</P>
<P>
Common Cause officials singled out bills by Bane and Nolan as having fueled 
"the radical deregulation" of the savings and loan industry and helped heighten 
the current thrift crisis in California. 
</P>
<P>
Bane said that there was no connection between the campaign contributions and 
his efforts on behalf of the thrift industry. "I shared that money with most of 
the Democrats in California who ran for office or who were financially unable 
to finance their campaigns," Bane said. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Holton, a Common Cause lobbyist, said the survey shows their legislation 
"opened up the floodgates for anyone to run a savings and loan." She cited the 
savings and loan contributions as one reason the public should support 
Proposition 131, the Nov. 6 ballot initiative that would limit legislative 
terms and establish partial public financing of campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan's bill, which became law in 1982, was a sweeping overhaul of the industry 
that lifted restrictions on the percentage of a savings and loans' assets that 
could be invested in a single venture. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, Bane, chairman of the Assembly Rules Committee, also 
successfully pushed legislation to remove some state anti-fraud provisions for 
savings and loans. 
</P>
<P>
Common Cause said the measure helped deregulate the savings and loan industry. 
But Bane, a former executive of a savings and loan trade association, dismissed 
the criticism, saying his measure merely recodified existing statutes. 
</P>
<P>
Dave K. Milton, lobbyist for the California League of Savings Institutions, 
called the assertions made by Common Cause ridiculous. He said the blame for 
the savings and loan crisis lies in changes enacted in Washington, not 
Sacramento.

DOG OWNERS PLEAD GUILTY IN ATTACK THAT MAULED BOY 
</P>

<P>
The owners of two dogs that mauled an 8-year-old North Hollywood boy, leaving 
him partially paralyzed in one arm, pleaded guilty Thursday to charges stemming 
from the attack and were sentenced in Van Nuys Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Gillen, 72, and his grandson Robby Edward Gillen, 25, each pleaded 
guilty to one misdemeanor charge of permitting a dog to run free on public 
property and cause an injury. 
</P>
<P>
Robby Gillen was sentenced to 25 days in jail and placed on three years 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Gillen was ordered to perform 1,000 hours of community service, placed 
on three years probation and banned from owning a dog for three years. He was 
also ordered to pay for the boy's medical expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Gillen also pleaded guilty to two counts of inhumane treatment of 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, whose name was not released, was riding his bike in the 6400 block 
of Riverton Avenue in North Hollywood on June 19 when the attack occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the Gillens' malamute named Shadow attacked the boy as he rode 
past the Gillen house. The dog bit the boy on the left wrist, pulled him off 
his bicycle then continued biting him on his left shoulder and armpit. The dog 
dragged the boy along the sidewalk toward the Gillen residence, where another 
of the Gillens' dogs -- a Staffordshire terrier called Smiley -- bit the boy as 
well, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Risdon, a neighbor, and Alan Gaar, a construction worker who was at a 
nearby building site, heard the boy's screams and fought the dogs off. 
</P>
<P>
The boy was hospitalized for two weeks and is still undergoing physical 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
"The child was seriously hurt and may never have full normal use of his left 
arm due to nerve damage," City Atty. James K. Hahn said. "But the quick action 
of Risdon and Gaar . . . saved him from further injury and maybe even death." 
</P>
<P>
After the attack, animal regulation officials found the two dogs at the 
Gillens' residence with three Staffordshire terriers. The animals were being 
kept in "cruelly inhumane conditions" with no water and improper shelter. 
Broken gates on the property allowed the dogs to escape from the yard, Hahn 
said. All five dogs were impounded.

CALABASAS GETS OK TO PUT CITYHOOD ON THE BALLOT; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: THE APPROVAL FROM THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ENDS YEARS OF EFFORT. 
BUT DEVELOPERS FEAR A NEW CITY COUNCIL MIGHT HALT CONSTRUCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Despite developer protests, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors decided 
Thursday to allow 27,000 Calabasas residents to vote on whether to form an 
independent city. 
</P>
<P>
The board acted without debate, setting the election for March 5. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in, we're in!" Arnold Sank, a vice president of the Calabasas Cityhood 
Committee, rejoiced after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The election will culminate more than five years of efforts to bring the 
cityhood question before residents. Members of the Cityhood Committee said they 
believe most residents want to see their community become an independent city. 
</P>
<P>
But in the next few months, Sank said, he and other cityhood supporters will 
mount a campaign to persuade voters that cityhood would be preferable to 
remaining an unincorporated area of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Washburn, another vice president of the cityhood group, said a city 
government would be able to respond to community concerns faster than the 
county government, and could develop community resources such as parks and a 
senior citizens center. 
</P>
<P>
"It's local control of local problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some developers in the area have said they feared that a new city government 
might try to halt building. Michael Balikian, an attorney who represents 
Freeway Properties III, which owns two acres of commercially zoned property at 
Las Virgenes and Agoura roads, told the supervisors that the election should 
not take place until a lawsuit filed by the developer has been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Freeway Properties filed suit last month in Los Angeles County Superior Court 
against the Local Agency Formation Commission, which in August gave its consent 
to the proposed incorporation of Calabasas. The lawsuit charges that LAFCO 
violated the California Environmental Quality Act by failing to require an 
environmental impact report on the incorporation plan. 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO has previously stated that a change in government would not have a 
significant impact on the environment, and that no EIR was necessary. But the 
lawsuit contends that the new city government would have the power to change or 
ignore regional transportation plans, particularly the planned extension and 
improvement of several major roads. It also says LAFCO failed to consider what 
might happen if the new city cannot pay for the fire services that the county 
is expected to provide. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Stanard, who also represents Freeway Properties, said the city should not 
be allowed to incorporate until those issues are studied. He said he was 
surprised that the supervisors set an election while litigation is pending. 
</P>
<P>
But Meredith Jury, a private attorney defending LAFCO in the suit, said the 
developer has no legal grounds to delay the election, since he failed to 
complain about the roads and fire services issues during public hearings that 
were held before LAFCO gave the go-ahead on incorporation. Officials also said 
the Board of Supervisors had no choice but to set an election once LAFCO acted. 
The only way they could have put off a decision would have been if a majority 
of the registered voters in the area would have filed a written protest. 
</P>
<P>
Jury said she will ask that the suit be dismissed at a court hearing scheduled 
for Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood supporters also said they doubt that the lawsuit would affect the 
election, in which voters will also be asked to select five members for a city 
council. The election will be decided by a simple majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
"When you organize a city, you don't generally change the environment," Sank 
said. "We are not changing anything that would affect the air, or the water." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, LAFCO rejected a petition for incorporation after a financial study 
determined that the new government would be $450,000 in debt after its first 
year. But a new report completed in June found that the sales tax base had 
increased and that the new city would be financially viable.

MORE CITY CONTROLS URGED IN RURAL ZONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Developers of houses in Camarillo's "rural exclusive zone" will face more 
design scrutiny if the City Council follows a Planning Commission 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
The rural zone is generally used for estate and custom house development on 
large lots. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed change in zoning would allow the Planning Department to limit 
colors, textures and materials on new or remodeled residences. Under the 
existing ordinance, the city can only dictate the structure's height and 
distance from the street. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment will allow for greater review and control in the design of 
projects, Planning Director Matthew A. (Tony) Boden said Tuesday. The 
agricultural and rural zones are the only zones exempt from a design review by 
the city. The City Council will consider the ordinance change in November. RUSS

STATE SUIT FOCUSES ON TOY SELLER'S PROFITS; 
</P>
<P>
VENDOR: THE TRINKET HAWKER, WHO WORKS OUTSIDE L.A. ZOO, SAYS THE MONEY GOES TO 
CARE FOR UNWANTED PETS. OFFICIALS SAY HE POCKETS MOST OF IT. 
</P>

Garbed in a clown suit, Bernard Kessler until recently spent his weekends 
hawking balloons and toys in front of the Los Angeles Zoo -- raising money, he 
says, to care for thousands of unwanted cats and dogs. 
</P>
<P>
But the state attorney general's office alleges in a lawsuit that most of the 
money that Kessler and his workers have made in the last four years selling 
trinkets at various Griffith Park sites has gone not to animal welfare but into 
Kessler's pockets. 
</P>
<P>
"We estimated they were selling merchandise at the rate of $350,000 a year in 
front of the Los Angeles Zoo, the Griffith Observatory and Travel Town (Museum) 
. . . telling people the proceeds were going to help dogs and cats," Deputy 
Atty. Gen. James Cordi said. "Our investigation showed that most of the 
proceeds were going into Bernard Kessler's bank accounts." 
</P>
<P>
Kessler's attorney insists that his client is guilty of no more than poor 
record-keeping, while Kessler argues that he is being persecuted because his 
trinket sales compete with souvenir sales inside the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who knows Bernie knows that Bernie is devoted to animals," said 
Kessler's attorney, David Liberman. "He never took a salary, never took a 
vacation. All of this was used so that he can rescue animals. . . . He's a very 
eccentric guy, we're not denying that. But he's certainly not a dishonorable or 
dishonest person." 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general's office has obtained a temporary court order barring 
Kessler and his wife, Sheri Mizrachi, from making any more sales until a Nov. 
20 Superior Court hearing on the matter, prompting Kessler to complain that he 
is being prevented from helping "the little orphan kitties and puppies who need 
to be bottle-fed to survive." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Kessler read from a letter that he had been planning 
to send to "almost every important person, including the Pope of Rome" about 
his plight -- but then decided not to on the advice of his attorney. In the 
letter, Kessler muses, "Why can't I stand proudly like the Statue of Liberty at 
the L.A. Zoo as my balloons wave high in the air like the American flag?" 
</P>
<P>
In the Superior Court lawsuit filed Oct. 4, the state argues that Kessler has 
violated a number of state and federal laws governing the nonprofit 
organization he founded in 1985, Help Elevate Life for Pets. According to state 
auditors who reviewed Kessler's bank records, sale proceeds were deposited into 
six accounts, five of them personal accounts and the sixth earmarked for HELP. 
Checks written on the personal accounts were used to pay such things as 
Kessler's mortgage and car and utility bills. 
</P>
<P>
Saying that he uses his Sylmar home to house 1,000 abandoned pets a year, 
Kessler defended his use of the HELP income to pay the mortgage. "Ninety 
percent of the house is used by the animals," Kessler said. "Ten percent is 
used by me. We have phone bills; 95% of the phone bills are for the animals." 
</P>
<P>
At the East Valley Animal Care and Control Center, District Supervisor Tom 
Walsh said his office has received a couple of complaints in the last year from 
Kessler's neighbors about an illegal kennel. Walsh said that on some visits his 
inspectors found too many animals and issued warnings. On several other 
inspections, the animal control officers found only a few pets. 
</P>
<P>
"Where is he hiding them?" asked Walsh of the 25 to 50 pets Kessler said he 
cares for every day at his home.

OFFICIALS TELL OF HOMELESS 'CRISIS'; 
</P>
<P>
SOCIAL SERVICES: REPRESENTATIVES FROM FIVE CITIES PLEAD FOR MORE STATE AND 
FEDERAL MONEY TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Officials from five major cities went panhandling Thursday for more help for 
the homeless during a state Assembly committee hearing at Santa Monica City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The mayors were unanimous in calling for more state and federal assistance for 
housing and mental health care. Cities are being asked to assume too much of 
the responsibility for caring for the homeless, they argued. 
</P>
<P>
"The buck is stopping at the doorstep of City Hall, but the bucks aren't there 
to solve the problem," Santa Monica Mayor Dennis Zane said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Zane, mayors Loni Hancock of Berkeley and Ernest Kell of Long Beach 
testified Thursday. Santa Cruz Vice Mayor Jane Yokayama and Los Angeles City 
Councilman Robert Farrell also spoke. 
</P>
<P>
The politicians were joined at the hearing by a handful of the homeless and 
formerly homeless. And outside City Hall, about a dozen Santa Monica residents 
and merchants held a brief news conference, arguing that the homeless problem 
will persist as long as handouts and shelter are provided to the indigent. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing before the Assembly Committee on Human Services was the outgrowth 
of a lobbying effort by a group of businesses and elected officials. Mayors 
from 14 cities recently sent a letter to state legislators pressing them to 
hold hearings and join local governments to solve the homeless problem. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, Berkeley's Hancock said the state and federal governments 
appear to "be looking the other way" when it comes to the homeless. Echoing the 
statements of other mayors who spoke, Hancock said the homeless problem has 
been aggravated by deep cuts in housing and state mental health budgets. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a crisis situation and must be recognized as such," Hancock said. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell told the legislators that no one knows exactly how many homeless there 
are in Los Angeles, adding that the best estimates are somewhere between 40,000 
and 70,000. He said that many people, such as aerospace workers facing layoffs, 
are precariously close to falling into the homeless category and are only "two 
or three paychecks from being on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
"The economics of the city of Los Angeles these days is a lot of people doing 
very well, and a lot of people not doing so well with very little in the 
middle," Farrell said. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Tom Bates (D-Oakland), who chairs the Human Services Committee, 
applauded the efforts of cities such as Santa Monica for their efforts to 
provide programs for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
But Bates argued that other municipalities are not doing their fair share, and 
some are ignoring state-mandated housing goals for low-income people. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel we have to go after those other people," Bates said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee members heard testimony from several formerly homeless people. 
One, Jo Anne Vandegriff, who said she was homeless for six months after she 
quit her job and then ran into financial difficulties, said she spent nights in 
terminals at Los Angeles International Airport and days on Santa Monica's 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole country has to be educated that we're all vulnerable to becoming 
homeless," the 36-year-old part-time secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
Jasen Marsh, 17, told the committee that he had been homeless for more than 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager said that after he was "thrown out" of his Whittier home, he came 
to Hollywood, where he now lives in a shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh said he has lived under bridges, along freeways and in abandoned 
buildings during the time he has been homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"There need to be more shelters. There are maybe four or five shelters out 
there that I know of," he said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL DELAYS ACTION ON WARNER RIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Planning Commission on Thursday delayed action on a staff 
report recommending that development on Warner Ridge not be limited to 
single-family houses. 
</P>
<P>
The commission delayed action until Dec. 13 because the staff report, signed by 
Planning Department Director Ken Topping, was very hastily prepared and 
therefore technically inadequate, commission President Bill Luddy said. 
</P>
<P>
But Luddy said he doubted that Topping would return with different advice in 
December. Topping, who did not attend the meeting, recommended against approval 
of a proposal advocated by Councilwoman Joy Picus, who wants no commercial 
development on the 21.5-acre site in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The Picus-backed revision would make the Warner Ridge community plan compatible 
with the zoning adopted by the council in January. The zoning calls for 
residential housing, but the current community plan permits commercial 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Topping's recommendation was a supplemental environmental impact 
report estimating that only 65 houses could be built on the site if it were 
developed to the maximum under Picus' plan and if the site were exempted from 
the city's slope density formula -- a provision designed to reduce the number 
of units that can be built on steeper lots. Without a slope density exemption, 
only 17 houses would be permitted, the report says.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WORK WILL CLOSE PARTS OF VENTURA FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lanes, ramps and connector roads on the Ventura Freeway in the San Fernando 
Valley will be closed tonight and Saturday night to permit work on widening the 
congested thoroughfare, Caltrans announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
From 10 p.m. today to 9 a.m. Saturday, up to three eastbound and westbound 
lanes will be closed between Haskell and Wilbur avenues. 
</P>
<P>
During the same hours, the southbound San Diego Freeway connector road to the 
westbound Ventura Freeway also will be closed. 
</P>
<P>
From 11 p.m. Saturday to 11 a.m. Sunday, as many as three eastbound lanes on 
the Ventura Freeway will be closed between Sepulveda and Van Nuys boulevards. 
Also, the northbound San Diego connector road to the eastbound Ventura Freeway 
will be closed. 
</P>
<P>
During the same hours, the eastbound Sepulveda on-ramp and the eastbound Van 
Nuys Boulevard off-ramp will be closed. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers on the Ventura Freeway are encouraged to drive carefully through the 
construction zone and to use Ventura Boulevard as an alternate, said Jim 
McAllister, resident engineer for the project. 
</P>
<P>
The closures are part of a $62-million project to widen the Ventura and 
Hollywood freeways from Universal City to Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
When the project is completed in early 1992, the two freeways will be 10 lanes 
wide from Lankershim Boulevard to Topanga Canyon Boulevard.

ALLEGED BOMBER PLEADS NOT GUILTY; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: THE GANG MEMBER IS CHARGED WITH MAKING EXPLOSIVE DEVICES AND DETONATING 
THEM IN VACANT LOTS AND AS REVENGE AGAINST A RIVAL GROUP.

A gang member who authorities said is known as "The Scientist" pleaded not 
guilty in Glendale Municipal Court Thursday to charges that he manufactured 
bombs to be used against a rival gang he believed had killed a friend. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Pargament said he believes Arash Forouzanfar, 19, is 
responsible for two bombs set off in vacant lots and another that destroyed the 
vacant dwelling of a rival gang. 
</P>
<P>
Forouzanfar, also known as Arash Vakil, was charged Tuesday with four felony 
counts of possession of completed explosive devices and of the ingredients to 
make them. The charges, escalated by an allegation that the materials were to 
be used by gang members, carry a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison, 
Pargament said. 
</P>
<P>
The lanky, mustachioed young man appeared in court in handcuffs, dressed in a 
white sweat shirt and black pants. In attendance at the hearing were his 
stepfather, a sister and his mother, who left court in tears and refused to 
answer questions. Defense attorney Charles A. Maple requested a reduction in 
the man's $250,000 bail, saying the family has lived in Glendale for many years 
and has ties to community. The motion was denied. 
</P>
<P>
Forouzanfar, who police said works as a security guard in Burbank, is being 
held in County Jail. He will return to court Oct. 25 for a bail reduction 
hearing and Nov. 6 for a preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The youth, an Iranian national who belonged to a mainly Latino gang active in 
Glendale and Northeast Los Angeles, was arrested Tuesday at his family's 
Glendale home, Police Sgt. Pete Michael said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities that day searched four locations frequented by Forouzanfar. In a 
house in the 1000 block of Harvard Road in Burbank, bomb squad officers found 
two complete bombs, gunpowder and other chemicals, and a "launcher" designed to 
propel explosive devices, Pargament said. 
</P>
<P>
Police, who conducted a five-month investigation that led to the search, said 
they believe that two bombings in vacant, isolated lots in Glendale in January 
and August were tests of the devices by the man or his gang, Sgt. Don Meredith 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Pargament also said Thursday that Forouzanfar was believed to have been 
involved in a bombing of a dwelling. He said he did not know where or when the 
incident occurred, or how the youth's friend allegedly was killed.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Funding the Arts 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 175 to 249, the House rejected a conservative-sponsored crackdown 
on National Endowment for the Arts funding of sexually explicit artworks. The 
House later passed legislation (HR 4825) authorizing $175 million in fiscal 
1991 for the endowment. 
</P>
<P>
The bill increased federal scrutiny of artists receiving public money but left 
questions of obscenity to the courts. 
</P>
<P>
The rejected amendment sought, in part, to deny funding of projects that depict 
sexual conduct such as masturbation and sadomasochistic abuse or that tear down 
a religion. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach) said: "When it comes to federal tax 
dollars, we have a right to set a standard. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Peter H. Kostmayer (D-Pa.) said: "This amendment is brought to you by 
the book burners in the country and in the Congress." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to keep taxpayers' money from funding sexually explicit art. 
</P>
<P>
How They Voted 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Gallegly (R): Yea 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Lagomarsino (R): Yea 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Uphold Textile Veto 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 275 to 152, the House fell short of the two-thirds majority needed 
to overturn President Bush's veto of a bill limiting the growth of textile and 
apparel imports to 1% annually. The measure (HR 4328) also sought to freeze 
non-rubber footwear imports at 1989 levels. Canada and Israel would be exempted 
from the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters said the bill would protect jobs and factories against unfair 
foreign competition, while opponents said it would mask industry inefficiencies 
and raise retail prices. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to protect the domestic textile, apparel and non-rubber footwear 
industries. 
</P>
<P>

CAN'T RUSH CHANGES, SOVIET OFFICIAL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A high-ranking Soviet diplomat told an audience in Claremont Thursday night 
that the political situation in his country is "like sitting between two 
chairs," with one system dismantled and another yet to take its place. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very uncomfortable," said Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir F. Petrovsky. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is looking for early practical results. But we should not rush." 
</P>
<P>
To an audience of 300 at Pomona College, he said those ruling the Soviet Union 
worry that the nation could be torn apart between the demands for immediate 
change and resistance to change. 
</P>
<P>
Petrovsky, 57, has been deputy foreign minister since 1986 with special 
responsibility for the Middle East and international organizations, among other 
things. He is a frequent visitor to the United Nations where he has served as 
the point man for Soviet proposals for multilateral disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
As Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev wrestles with rebuilding his country's 
political institutions and economy, Petrovsky said, the Soviet leader was 
drawing inspiration from American history, particularly from the "political 
courage" of Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
"His idea is to steadily go farther and farther, but not to rock the boat," 
Petrovsky said. He also said the Soviet Union is committed to a course of 
"ballots -- not bullets." 
</P>
<P>
Though optimistic about international cooperation, he said the Middle East is 
"the only area outside of the negotiating process" because of Iraqi aggression. 
He also said the United Nations must "be prepared, if necessary, for 
suppression of aggression."

LANDLORD APPEALS RULING FOR TENANTS; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: LAWYER SAYS OWNER SHOULDN'T BE SINGLED OUT FOR CRIME IN THE AREA. 
RESIDENTS WERE AWARDED $20,000 AFTER CLAIMING HIS BUILDING BECAME 'HUB OF GANG 
ACTIVITY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Activist landlord Eric Crumpton went to Los Angeles Superior Court Thursday to 
appeal a Small Claims Court award of $20,000 to 10 neighbors of a building he 
owns in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The landlord's lawyer told Judge Kathryn Doi Todd that Crumpton's building is 
not the area's "hub of gang activity," as neighbors allege, and that Crumpton 
should not be singled out for failing to curb criminal activity that is rife 
throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
During a Small Claims Court hearing in February, area residents contended that 
Crumpton refused to keep track of his tenants and allowed gang members to 
overrun his property at 1644 Winona Blvd., near Hollywood Boulevard and 
Normandie Avenue. Eventually, plaintiffs said, the entire neighborhood 
suffered. 
</P>
<P>
"Gang activity in the area did not start with the Crumptons," said attorney 
Robert Weber, who is representing Crumpton and his wife, Joycelyn, also named 
in the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Weber said that gangs in Hollywood have been "endemic" since Crumpton bought 
the 40-unit, brick apartment building in November, 1986. For the last four 
years, gang activity has shifted from neighborhood to neighborhood, Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
"The (movement) has nothing to do with the property owners in that territory," 
Weber said. "If property owners could control criminal activity, all criminals 
would be homeless." 
</P>
<P>
The case was the first in Southern California in which neighbors successfully 
sued a landlord for nuisance and negligence violations. In Berkeley last year, 
18 neighbors were awarded a total of $18,000 after filing similar small claims 
actions against a building owner. In San Francisco, 15 people who took action 
were awarded $2,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Hollywood neighborhood group, Street Peace, who filed the 
complaint against Crumpton, said they chose the Small Claims Court because it 
was the quickest and cheapest method. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs alleged that neighbors were doused with liquid poured from 
windows in the building, and that Crumpton's tenants flung garbage into 
neighboring yards or onto the sidewalk and paths lining the building. Crumpton 
also allegedly balked at paying for seismological remodeling that would bring 
the apartment into compliance with building safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
Weber said that Crumpton received extensions to complete the remodeling, and 
that city building inspectors granted him leeway because of a backup on 
construction orders to retrofit buildings to new earthquake safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Bell, a neighborhood landlord scheduled to testify for Crumpton, said that 
the complaint was lodged by neighbors who were venting frustration over a 
general feeling of lawlessness that has taken over their once-quiet area. 
</P>
<P>
"In that area there are so many problems," Bell said. "But with the number of 
calls that the police get, only the most urgent ones can get attention. I think 
that residents (living near Crumpton's building) really are getting upset over 
the lack of response from police."

<P>
The God-given gift of child-bearing is exclusive to women. As a man, about all 
I can do is try to be there for a woman at the time she is having our baby, 
same way I was there at the time we created it. 
</P>
<P>
Thank goodness I do not pitch for the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to being in labor, the Reds have their own peculiar priorities. 
They place the manual labor of their baseball players and the winning of a 
World Series game as being more urgent and more necessary than being with one's 
wife during parturition, as we discovered Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
And the Reds are owned by Marge Schott, a woman. 
</P>
<P>
With Game 2 against the Oakland Athletics in progress, Cincinnati pitcher Tom 
Browning was notified that his wife, Debbie, had gone into labor. Because 
Browning is scheduled to start today's Game 3 at Oakland, the Reds did not 
expect to need him Wednesday. He took his wife to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
When the score became tied later in the game, however, the Reds suddenly became 
so panicked -- imagine, they became panicked -- that they were not going to 
have enough pitchers that they asked their radio voice, Marty Brennaman, to 
broadcast a message to Browning that if Tom was out there listening, he should 
hurry back to the stadium immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Now, think about this for a minute. A man whose wife is in a potentially 
life-threatening situation, is told that there is something far more important 
he must attend to, that being the final score of a baseball game being played 
someplace downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Shame on the Reds and on anybody who participated in this lunacy. Even if Tom 
and Mom Browning are extremely understanding, the fact remains that no World 
Series game bears anything remotely close to the importance of bearing a child, 
and this is not the 19th Century, where you just sat back and waited for your 
woman to do all the work. 
</P>
<P>
Do you know how many pitchers Cincinnati had used Wednesday when this 
earth-shattering emergency of theirs came up? 
</P>
<P>
Five. 
</P>
<P>
And that's how many the Reds used in the entire game, which lasted 10 innings. 
Not 15 innings. Not 20. It lasted 10 innings, with pitchers Rick Mahler and 
Randy Myers remaining in the bullpen, unused. 
</P>
<P>
You can be as sympathetic to the Reds' management as you like, reasoning how 
the poor dears had to plan in advance for the possibility of the game dragging 
on and on, but there was no call for them pulling apart Tom Browning's already 
unsteady emotions like a wishbone, just because Manager Lou Piniella misused 
his available pitchers or didn't leave himself a large enough supply on the 
roster. 
</P>
<P>
We seem to have a "the game is the important thing" mentality this time of year 
that precludes any other outside event, including earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Tom Browning did not have to be beside his wife when she was having their 
baby. He was not doing the actual delivery. She was not stuck inside some barn 
with a midwife and a kerosene lantern. 
</P>
<P>
But there is real life and then there is baseball. Having a baby is more than 
just a Kodak moment and a pocketful of cigars. There is pain and need and fear. 
Complications can occur. Debbie Browning didn't need Tom there to help her pick 
out a dress. She needed Tom there because she was giving birth to their child. 
</P>
<P>
Tom is 30 years old and an adult. He can make up his own mind about such 
things. Who knows? Maybe he would have hurried back to pitch because Debbie 
"would have wanted it that way." 
</P>
<P>
Just be glad that the Reds won the game when they did. Heaven forbid the 
manager should ask Norm Charlton to pitch more than one inning, or Rob Dibble 
more than two, or Mahler or Myers to do a little extra. Heaven forbid Tom 
Browning not be there when the game moved into the 18th inning and the clock 
struck midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Somebody undoubtedly will try to tell me that Daddy could not have given a 
sweeter birthday present to baby Browning than to have gone back and won the 
big ballgame. A rainstorm was headed Cincinnati's way. Browning could have 
grabbed a cab and told the driver: "Riverfront Stadium and step on it! I got a 
game to pitch!" Real Hollywood stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he could have pitched it in a hospital gown. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he could have named the baby Lou, or Marge, or Red. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he would have been so excited, he'd have pitched with the wrong hand, or 
run to the wrong dugout, or forgot to wear his socks, something like that. 
</P>
<P>
All I can say is, Marge Schott wouldn't have sent her dog out on a night like 
this. 
</P>
<P>
And even if she would have, she wouldn't have asked her to come back.

Michael Nunn invited Donald Curry to show he had the punching power of a 
middleweight. Curry failed. Nunn proved his point and kept his title Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Curry, who won titles as a welterweight and a junior-middleweight, was on 
target often enough but didn't have the power to nail the champion, who has 
always been a middleweight. 
</P>
<P>
"He never hurt me, but he gave me good shots," Nunn said after his 10th-round 
knockout of Curry. "I was testing his strength, seeing how strong he was. He 
was moving up and he deserved the opportunity to try and he got it, and I beat 
up on him. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just too big for him. He fought his way to number one, and naturally 
with him movingup, I was bigger and stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Nunn overpowered Curry with 15 consecutive punches in the 10th round that 
floored the challenger, and referee Denny Nelson ended the fight. 
</P>
<P>
The champion retained his International Boxing Federation title and remained 
undefeated as a professional. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn cut Curry in the second round and floored him in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn hopes he has won back the U.S. promoters who turned their backs on him 
after two sluggish performances. 
</P>
<P>
About 13,800 fans roared their approval of Nunn's performance, in which he 
showed a variety of punching skills, some fancy footwork and some touches of 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, 27, of Davenport, Iowa, who now lives in Agoura Hills, won the title from 
Frank Tate two years ago. He is unbeaten in 36 fights. 
</P>
<P>
Curry, 29, of Ft. Worth, is 33-4-0. 
</P>
<P>
Outreached by five inches and two inches shorter than the 6-foot-1 champion, 
Curry tried working low in the first round, when the left-handed Nunn was 
jeered for a low blow. 
</P>
<P>
In the second, Nunn stung Curry with a fast combination and opened a cut high 
on the challenger's forehead. Curry never was bothered by the cut, but he found 
it hard to deal with Nunn's variety of punches. 
</P>
<P>
Curry was forced into going forward by Nunn's dancing, counter-attacking style, 
and the fighters drew applause midway through the third after a sustained 
flurry of punches. 
</P>
<P>
Curry, one pound lighter than Nunn, landed two crisp rights in Round 4, but 
they did not appear to worry the champion. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, advised by Angelo Dundee, smiled at Aktar Muhammad, Curry's business 
adviser, who taunted the champion with shouts of "Run, Michael, Run." 
</P>
<P>
He rolled his stomach muscles in bodybuilder fashion when Curry caught him on 
the ropes, and Nunn even tried to help the challenger to his feet after Curry 
slipped to the canvas in Round 2. 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh, Nunn chased Curry into the challenger's corner, and a cluster 
of punches dropped him to his knees. He was up at the count of three and 
continued to push forward. But by the ninth, Curry was tiring fast. 
</P>
<P>
Now it was Nunn's turn to go forward, and he repeatedly hit the challenger's 
face with long right jabs and follow-up lefts. 
</P>
<P>
In the 10th, he had Curry retreating into his corner. Nunn did not let him 
leave. He directed punch after punch at the challenger's head until Curry 
crumbled onto his knees again. This time, Nelson called the fight.

BROWNING HAS NEW DELIVERY;

<P>
REDS: PITCHER LEAVES TO ACCOMPANY WIFE TO HOSPITAL, AND CLUB PUTS OUT AN 
ALL-POINTS BULLETIN FOR HIM.

<TEXT>
<P>
It was Wednesday night in the bottom of the eighth inning, and Tom Browning was 
on the edge of his seat. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati had just tied the Oakland Athletics in Game 2 of the World Series. 
Browning was anticipating a second Reds victory, looking forward to his Game 3 
start, thinking about . . . tap, tap, tap. 
</P>
<P>
A clubhouse attendant shattered his concentration, poking a finger into his 
shoulder. The attendant had a message from Browning's pregnant wife, Debbie. 
</P>
<P>
She was sitting in the waiting room outside the clubhouse. She wanted to see 
him. Now. 
</P>
<P>
"You should have seen the look on his face," teammate Rick Mahler said. "His 
eyes were like . . . oh no." 
</P>
<P>
And so began one of the strangest, sweetest odysseys in recent Series history. 
</P>
<P>
There was panic as Browning rushed out of the clubhouse to accompany Debbie to 
a local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
There was joy as Browning, wearing a gown over his Red uniform, watched the 
birth of his son just 30 minutes after he watched -- on television -- as the 
Reds defeated the A's in 10 innings. 
</P>
<P>
But more than anything there was total confusion, as neither Manager Lou 
Piniella nor pitching coach Stan Williams knew where Browning was. 
</P>
<P>
It wouldn't have mattered, except that after the game went into extra innings 
the Reds had only two pitchers remaining. Browning, scheduled to start today in 
Game 3, might have been needed two days early in relief. 
</P>
<P>
"In the eighth inning, Lou told me to warn Browning to start thinking about 
pitching," Williams said. "I didn't see him in the dugout, so I sent somebody 
up to the clubhouse to find him. The word came back that he was gone. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'He's what?' I didn't know where he could be. I was shocked." 
</P>
<P>
Williams reacted mildly compared to Piniella, who was seen on television 
yelling at Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"Lou said, 'What in the hell is going on?' " Williams said. "I said, 'Don't ask 
me.' I had never seen a pitcher walk out of a World Series game before." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after Browning's departure they realized he had accompanied his wife to 
the hospital. They didn't know which hospital, but they wanted him to come back 
and be available to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a kid phone every hospital in the area, but none of them would give out 
the information," Williams said. "All we knew was that he was with his wife and 
was doing whatever women do when they're getting ready to have babies." 
</P>
<P>
Their worry soon spread to the Reds' radio broadcast booth, where announcers 
pleaded on the air for Browning, wherever he was, to return to the park. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't quite panicked yet, it was only the 10th inning," Williams said. 
"But you wouldn't think you would have to put out a national signal to find a 
pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, by the time the Reds arrived in Oakland Thursday afternoon, Piniella 
and Williams understood what had happened. Browning had a two-day growth of 
beard and red eyes to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that we know, I told him, I understand everything he was going through," 
Williams said. "But I told him, next time, please do mention it to somebody." 
</P>
<P>
It is a story that Browning will be talking about for years. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just glad I remembered to take pictures," he said wearily. 
</P>
<P>
His night began at 4 p.m., when Debbie began having labor pains. She wasn't due 
to give birth to their third child for another week, so she thought it was 
false labor. 
</P>
<P>
Against her doctor's wishes, she attended the game, timing her contractions 
from behind home plate. The contractions grew stronger as the game dragged on, 
and finally she knew it was real. 
</P>
<P>
She rushed to her car to drive herself to the hospital, but the car was blocked 
by a team van. This is when she banged on the clubhouse door and asked for her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
"All she wanted me to do was get somebody to move the van so she could move her 
car," Browning said. "She didn't want me to leave the game. 
</P>
<P>
"But I panicked. I wasn't going to let her go alone. 
</P>
<P>
"The assistant trainer and one of the clubhouse guys and, I think, Ron Oester 
knew because he was there when they told me she was looking for me. But I 
didn't really come out and actually tell anybody where I was going. 
</P>
<P>
"I just got to the point where I saw her at the car and I kind of panicked and 
said, 'Let's go.' " 
</P>
<P>
Soon, in full uniform, he was helping her into the emergency room of St. 
Elizabeth South Hospital in Crestview Hills, Ky. He had not even bothered to 
remove his baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure some of those people thought I was just a big Reds fan," Browning 
said. "I heard a lot of whispers." 
</P>
<P>
Browning sat with his wife in a labor room and turned on the television. It was 
then that he heard a CBS announcer relay the message given over the radio. 
</P>
<P>
"It was then I realized that nobody knew where I was," Browning said. "But when 
you are about to become a father, you don't think about that. 
</P>
<P>
"I stood there listening to that and I started sweating and pacing, thinking, 
'Oh my God, what am I going to do here?' I was at the hospital. She was getting 
prepped, ready to get a C-section done. I wasn't going to leave, but I didn't 
know what else to do. I wanted to stay there, and another part of me wanted to 
go back to the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
"I was between a rock and a hard spot. I knew we were running low on pitchers. 
Yet I felt kind of helpless in that situation because I wanted to make sure 
that everything was OK with my wife and my child. Luckily Joe (Oliver) hit the 
double down the line and took care of all my problems." 
</P>
<P>
Moments after the game ended, he was being fitted for a gown over his jersey 
and taken into the operating room, where the baby would be born by Caesarean 
section. 
</P>
<P>
It was only then that Browning, who had missed the birth of his first child 
because of baseball, thankfully realized that he wasn't going to miss this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
At 12:27 p.m., Tucker Thomas Browning -- 6 pounds, 11 ounces -- was born. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Browning will have more than emotion on his side. He'll also have 
history. The last pitcher to start a World Series game the day after the birth 
of a child was Kansas City's Bret Saberhagen in 1985. All he did was throw a 
five-hit shutout against St. Louis in Game 7 to give the Royals the title. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball can be a luxurious life," Browning said. "But it is definitely not a 
normal life. 
</P>
<P>
"Y'know, a baby born this morning and I had to leave. That was tough. At least 
I know he's healthy and OK. It was a great night. We got a win and I got my 
third child."

WITH ANOTHER 64, SIMPSON'S GAME SURE ISN'T MICKEY MOUSE

Tim Simpson continued to blister par in the Disney Golf Classic on Thursday, 
adding a second-round 64 to an identical opening score for a 36-hole total that 
was 16 strokes under par and four in front of Paul Azinger. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm playing pretty darn good," said Simpson, who made seven birdies, an eagle 
and a bogey on the 7,190-yard Magnolia Course. 
</P>
<P>
He credited a change in his putting style Tuesday for much of his success. 
</P>
<P>
The low round of the day was a 63 by Tom Byrum. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson's 128 total ties similar low 36-hole scores by Jose Maria Olazabal and 
Peter Persons earlier this year on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
Azinger had a 65 Thursday to go with his first-round 67 and is four shots 
behind the leader. 
</P>
<P>
Also turning in 65s were Bob Gilder, Kenny Perry, Davis Love III, Gene Sauers 
and Bob Lohr. 
</P>
<P>
Gilder, Perry, Sauers and Love were five shots behind Simpson, along with Byrum 
and John Mahaffey (66). Lohr was one shot farther back at 134. 
</P>
<P>
"I remained patient today," Simpson said. "It took nine holes to get 
comfortable. But when you get it going, you feel like Rocky." 
</P>
<P>
His eagle came on the par-five 10th hole, where he hit a three-wood 243 yards 
into the wind for his second shot and then holed out with a sand wedge from 35 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow pro and friend Morris Hatalsky worked with Simpson to change to a more 
upright putting stance and a slower stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Azinger, who had seven birdies in his 65, said: "I was very solid tee to green. 
I was really close all the way. I felt I could have birdied every hole except 
seven and nine."

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: LIKE CANSECO, CBS COVERAGE OF SERIES BOTH HIT AND 
MISS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Overall, CBS is doing a good job on the World Series. Given an exciting game 
Wednesday night, the network captured the drama. 
</P>
<P>
But there have been some flaws. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Coyle, NBC's respected longtime baseball director, had a rule: Always 
follow the ball. It's a simple rule, but CBS has been breaking it. 
</P>
<P>
The best, or worst, example was on the triple to right field by Cincinnati's 
Billy Hatcher -- the one Oakland's Jose Canseco bungled -- in the eighth inning 
of Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers saw Canseco giving up on the ball, then, suddenly, were switched to 
Hatcher rounding second base. Viewers never saw -- not even in replays -- what 
happened to the ball. 
</P>
<P>
It was left to announcer Tim McCarver to explain that A's center fielder Dave 
Henderson came over to field it. 
</P>
<P>
This wasn't the only time CBS left the ball to show a baserunner during the 
first two games of the Series, but it was the most noticeable. 
</P>
<P>
Most revolting have been the closeups of the Reds' Eric Davis spitting tobacco 
juice. Does the director believe the nation wants to see this disgusting 
practice? Some people might be eating dinner in front of the set. What's next? 
A slo-mo replay of Davis spraying his juice around the batter's box while an 
analyst goes to the chalkboard to diagram how he does it? 
</P>
<P>
McCarver, while with ABC, worked within the confines of a three-announcer 
format in which play-by-play man Al Michaels also offered quite a bit of 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
McCarver didn't have time to ramble on. He had to be concise and to the point. 
</P>
<P>
Now, working with low-key Jack Buck on CBS, he has more time for analysis, and 
in this case, more is not better. 
</P>
<P>
McCarver, who generally got rave reviews while at ABC, is talking too much. 
</P>
<P>
He still offers important insights and makes a lot of good points, but at times 
he wears the viewer out with chatter. 
</P>
<P>
And sometimes he's hard to follow. 
</P>
<P>
During Game 1, while talking about Davis' $3-million contract and the fans' 
expectations, McCarver came up with this gem: "When players like Davis sign big 
contracts, most of the time the reason they don't do it (excel) is they're 
trying too hard, not hard enough, not not trying hard enough." After a pause, 
he added: "I guess that was clear?" 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, Tim, it wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Musburger, who was going to be CBS' main man at the Series until he was 
fired on April 1, watched the first two games from his Montana home before 
leaving for Palo Alto to work Saturday's Washington-Stanford football game for 
ABC. 
</P>
<P>
Does he feel any disappointment? 
</P>
<P>
"No, no, not at all," he said by phone. "Hey, I've been so busy with college 
football I haven't been able to give the World Series much thought." 
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes CBS does well, adding: "I still have a lot of friends there." 
</P>
<P>
Musburger turned off Game 1 after Oakland's Mark McGwire popped out in the 
fifth inning so he could watch Washington and Stanford tapes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting ready for Saturday's game, and I'm very excited about that," 
Musburger said. 
</P>
<P>
So football was what Musburger wanted to talk about. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what I've come to realize is the Eastern bias toward the Pac-10," he 
said. "I don't think the Pac-10 gets the credit it deserves. If Washington 
played Virginia and USC played Georgia Tech, I think you'd have to favor 
Washington and USC." 
</P>
<P>
Add Musburger: Interviewed recently by NBC's Bob Costas for his "Later" show, 
Musburger said he would have been willing to step aside as CBS' No. 1 baseball 
play-by-play announcer if the network had hired one of three people -- Vin 
Scully, Michaels or Costas. 
</P>
<P>
"I know about that conversation at the hotel they (CBS) had with you," 
Musburger said, which brought no response from Costas. 
</P>
<P>
Musburger also chided Costas about his concern over television critics. "You 
worry too much about that," Musburger said. "And you're lucky. They like you." 
</P>
<P>
Boxing beat: The departure from HBO of Sugar Ray Leonard as a boxing 
commentator seems to be one of those "only-in-boxing" things. 
</P>
<P>
HBO announced it wasn't renewing Leonard's contract because it hadn't been 
allowed to bid on Leonard's proposed fight against Terry Norris, the World 
Boxing Council junior-middleweight champion, tentatively scheduled for late 
January or early February at the Las Vegas Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
HBO thought Leonard slighted his employer of 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
But Leonard's manager, Mike Trainer, said he did have conversations with Bob 
Greenway, HBO's vice president of marketing, about the Norris fight and was led 
to believe that HBO, close to a $100-million deal with Mike Tyson, wasn't 
interested in Leonard-Norris. 
</P>
<P>
HBO countered that Trainer simply handed the fight to Showtime. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer said Leonard's HBO contract had expired anyway, and now he's free to 
work for other networks. He said Leonard has already received offers from ABC 
and ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN will use Leonard on its coverage before and after the Buster 
Douglas-Evander Holyfield heavyweight title bout, and he'll be a guest on "Good 
Morning, America" next week. 
</P>
<P>
Add boxing: Contrary to some reports, Rick Kulis, the coordinator of the 
pay-per-view and closed-circuit telecasts for Douglas-Holyfield next Thursday 
night, claims that sales are going well. 
</P>
<P>
The fight, being sold by most cable companies for $39.95, will be available in 
a record 14.8 million homes nationwide and at about 400 closed-circuit sites, 
including 50 in the Southland. The closed-circuit locations are such places as 
Legends in Long Beach, various Red Onion restaurants and the Sports Deli in 
Century City. 
</P>
<P>
The announcers will be Bob Papa and Ferdie Pacheco, with Jim Hill as host. The 
undercard, highlighted by a 10-round fight between heavyweights Riddick Bowe 
and Bert Cooper, will begin at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
Game 2 of the World Series got a national Nielsen rating of 21.8, bringing the 
two-game average to 21.1, a 26% increase over the 16.8 average for the first 
two games last year. . . . Series game times have been moved up a few minutes 
to 5:24 p.m., with the exception of Sunday, when game time will be 5:37. . . . 
A reminder: For those who prefer the poetic and insightful prose of Vin Scully, 
he's announcing the Series with Johnny Bench for CBS Radio (KNX in Los 
Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
The appeal of CBS' Notre Dame-Miami telecast, at 12:30 p.m. Saturday, has 
dropped considerably, but it still should be quite a game. . . . ABC sure fell 
asleep at the switch last Saturday when it didn't leave USC-Stanford to show 
the finish of the Michigan-Michigan State game to West Coast viewers. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 4's Fred Roggin called Dave Taylor of the Kings Dave Stewart last 
Sunday night. It's understandable. Stewart is a common name. Roggin did correct 
the mistake. . . . Roggin will work with Todd Christensen on the NBC telecast 
of the Raiders' game against the Chargers in San Diego Sunday. The CBS game at 
10 a.m. will be Philadelphia at Washington, with Pat Summerall and John Madden 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Ticket has a winner in "Press Box," its new nightly half-hour news show. 
Already, it's nearly as good as ESPN's "SportsCenter," and that's saying a lot. 
. . . Steve Garvey has been doing very well as a World Series analyst on "Press 
Box." So has the Dodgers' Rick Dempsey on Channel 2, although Dempsey now gives 
way to St. Louis Cardinal pitcher Joe Magrane, who was on Channel 2 during the 
National League playoffs. Magrane is a broadcasting natural. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 4's Brett Lewis came up with an interesting idea for a feature, getting 
Angel pitcher Jim Abbott and Montreal Expo pitcher John Costello to do an 
Abbott-and-Costello "Who's on First" routine. It was shown only last Sunday 
afternoon. Lewis said the estate of Lou Costello, which owns the rights to the 
routine, would permit only one showing. . . . George Steinbrenner will be 
interviewed on "A Current Affair" on Channel 11 tonight at 7:30 and will serve 
as host of "Saturday Night Live" Saturday.

THIS POSITION ISN'T ALWAYS A SNAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After botching the exchange between center and quarterback only once last 
season, USC has fumbled the snap seven times in its last two games. 
</P>
<P>
Six times, the center was sophomore Titus Tuiasosopo, a 6-foot-2, 275-pound 
reserve who probably would be moved into the starting lineup ahead of redshirt 
freshman David Apolskis if he could master the fundamental requirement of the 
position. 
</P>
<P>
"His blocking, his leadership, his toughness have been excellent," Coach Larry 
Smith said. "But you can't play with a center who can't get the snap up." 
</P>
<P>
Only two Pac-10 players, Greg Lewis of Washington and Anthony Wallace of 
California, have better per-game rushing averages than USC tailbacks Ricky 
Ervins and Mazio Royster, but neither Ervins nor Royster is included among the 
conference leaders because neither has played in 75% of the Trojans' games. 
</P>
<P>
Ervins averaged 95 yards a game before spraining an ankle in USC's fourth game 
against Ohio State. He hasn't played since, having given way to Royster, who 
didn't play in the Trojans' first two games, but has since averaged 95.8 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Royster's average includes this line from the Washington game: one carry, 
minus-two yards. Since Ervins was injured, he has averaged 128.3 yards a game.

PACIFIC 10 / MAL FLORENCE;

<P>
JAMES PLAYING DOWN ROSE BOWL PROSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's understandable that Washington players and fans are talking about the Rose 
Bowl, considering that the Huskies are the only Pacific 10 team that hasn't 
lost a conference game (3-0) and have a favorable schedule in their remaining 
five games. 
</P>
<P>
However, Coach Don James is trying to put a lid on such optimism. 
</P>
<P>
James is mindful that the Huskies had 3-0 Pac-10 records four times in the 
1980s and didn't go to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to be polite," James said, referring to people who are prematurely 
congratulating his team. "I just thank them and try to change the subject." 
</P>
<P>
The players, though, aren't as reticent. 
</P>
<P>
"I've said all along that this can be a great team. We can get to the Rose 
Bowl," offensive guard Dean Kirkland said. "We've got a mean defense and a mean 
offense. We'll go hats-on-hats with you and beat you." 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore quarterback Mark Brunell said: "We're getting better every game. I 
know I'm feeling more comfortable and confident." 
</P>
<P>
There are reasons for optimism: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Huskies lead the nation in rushing defense, allowing opponents an 
average of 47.5 yards a game on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tailback Greg Lewis is the conference's leading rusher, averaging 135.5 
yards a game. He averaged 7.3 yards a carry in a 38-17 victory over Oregon last 
Saturday in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In three conference games, Washington has outscored opponents, 111-31, and 
outgained them by an average of 459 yards to 215 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Washington will play Stanford at Palo Alto Saturday and has only one road game 
remaining thereafter, its annual regular-season-ending Apple Cup battle against 
Washington State at Pullman, Wash., on Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies will play California, Arizona and UCLA at home. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that makes it so great is that the whole team is playing well," 
defensive tackle Steve Emtman said. "It just isn't two or three guys. Everybody 
is making big plays." 
</P>
<P>
Although Fred Schweer Jr. led Oregon State to a 35-21 upset over Arizona last 
Saturday at Corvallis, Ore., Coach Dave Kragthorpe hasn't designated him as the 
No. 1 quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"Fred Schweer started because Matt Booher was injured," Kragthorpe said. "I 
feel very comfortable about our quarterback position and I am not concerned 
about who starts against Washington State (Saturday in Corvallis)." 
</P>
<P>
Schweer, from Woodbridge High School in Irvine, is a redshirt freshman. His 
father was a running back for the Beavers in 1964-65. 
</P>
<P>
The 35 points scored by the Beavers against the Wildcats were the most for 
Oregon State since it was beaten by WSU, 45-42, in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State lost nine fumbles in its first three games, but only one in its 
last three. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona seems to have problems getting up for the "little games." 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the Wildcats lost to Washington State, 38-14, at Tucson. The Cougars 
finished in a tie for eighth place in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars defeated the Wildcats the next year, winning, 34-19, in Tucson. Two 
weeks earlier, Arizona had upset previously unbeaten USC, 13-10, at the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Arizona tied Cal, 23-23, and lost to WSU, 45-28. The Bears and Cougars 
finished eighth and ninth, respectively, in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Wildcats had beaten Oklahoma, Washington and UCLA, among other 
schools, before losing to Cal, 29-28. The Bears wound up in last place in the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific 10 Notes 
</P>
<P>
Oregon Coach Rich Brooks, on Washington: "Defensively, they are just 
light-years ahead of where they were. Everywhere you look, they're all over on 
defense. They just obliterate opponents' running games. And Greg Lewis is a 
great running back, the best we've seen. Right now, they clearly have the best 
team in our conference." . . . Oregon cornerback Muhammad Oliver suffered a 
season-ending knee injury against the Huskies. Moreover, quarterback Bill 
Musgrave has a pulled abdominal muscle and is listed as doubtful for Saturday's 
game against Arizona State at Eugene, Ore. . . . The sound of music: Columnist 
Mark Purdy of the San Jose Mercury-News tuned in on the USC marching band last 
Saturday at Stanford. He estimated that it played "Conquest" 53 times. 
Considering that the Trojans haven't lost to the Cardinal since 1975, Purdy 
figures that Stanford has had to endure "Conquest" 795 times since last beating 
USC. . . . Washington has won 10 of its last 11 games against Stanford.

What did tailback Bo Jackson do with the 10 days he had between the end of 
baseball season and last Saturday, when he reported to the Raiders? 
</P>
<P>
"I did some hunting," Jackson said. "We went to Georgia and hunted wild boar 
with a bow and arrow." 
</P>
<P>
Did Jackson get one? 
</P>
<P>
"I got one, but I couldn't find it," he said. "He went off with my arrow. And a 
swamp isn't the place you want to be at 9 at night."

the practice squad to make room for defensive end Howie Long and tackle Bruce 
Wilkerson. CHRIS BAKER

Ickey Woods could be in the backfield again for the Cincinnati Bengals against 
the Cleveland Browns on Monday night, just when the Bengals' running game needs 
a boost. Woods, eligible to be activated from the Physically Unable to Perform 
list, hasn't played since the second game of the 1989 season, when he injured 
his left knee. The Bengals, after leading the league in rushing the past two 
seasons, are averaging fewer than 100 yards a game.

DOLPHINS WIN DESPITE FIVE TURNOVERS, 17-10; 
</P>
<P>
AFC: BLOCKED PUNT HELPS MIAMI BEAT NEW ENGLAND IN SLOPPY GAME.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Miami Dolphins have improved so much they can win even when they play 
poorly. 
</P>
<P>
Stingy defense and Mark Higgs' touchdown on a blocked punt helped the Dolphins 
overcome five turnovers Thursday night as they beat the New England Patriots, 
17-10, to assume sole possession of first place in the AFC East. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins (5-1), seeking their first playoff berth since 1985, took a 
half-game lead over the Buffalo Bills, who play the New York Jets Sunday. The 
Patriots (1-5) sustained their fourth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
An 11-day layoff left both teams looking sloppy. Miami won despite numerous 
dropped passes, an interception and four lost fumbles, including one in the 
Patriots' end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to look at how poorly we played offensively, and you can't be happy 
about that," Miami Coach Don Shula said. "It seemed like everything you could 
do wrong you did. The defense just kept the offense in it." 
</P>
<P>
New England had 34 yards in the first half and 197 in the game against the 
Dolphins' defense, ranked fourth in the NFL. Miami stopped the Patriots on 14 
of their 18 third-down situations. 
</P>
<P>
"Things went bad for the offense tonight," said Miami defensive end Jeff Cross, 
who had one of five sacks for the Dolphins and leads the league with eight. "We 
know there'll be days like this. We just hung in there and did enough to get 
the job done and win." 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins had all five turnovers in the first half, but they still led 10-3 
because of Higgs' 19-yard return of a blocked punt. With the ball at the 
Patriots' 36-yard line, he slipped between blockers up the middle and smothered 
Brian Hansen's kick, grabbed the ball on the bounce and scored easily. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Marino set up Miami's other touchdown late in the third quarter by passing 
to Mark Clayton for a 36-yard gain to the Patriots' two-yard line. Sammie Smith 
scored on the next play to cap a 64-yard drive for a 17-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
New England's touchdown came with 6:18 left when George Adams caught a 
four-yard scoring pass from Marc Wilson on fourth down. The Patriots quickly 
forced a punt and took over at the Miami 44, but their final threat ended when 
Wilson was stopped for no gain on a fourth-down sneak at the 35 with 3:31 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots had chances to build a big early lead, but they failed to pick up 
a first down after Miami's first three turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
"When we ran the ball they beat us, and when we passed, they covered us, and 
when we were open, we dropped it," Patriot Coach Rod Rust said. 
</P>
<P>
"We just kept turning them back," Shula said. "In the beginning we looked 
awesome as far as pass rush and run defense." 
</P>
<P>
Linebackers E.J. Junior and Hugh Green each had two sacks of Wilson, who 
completed 18 of 38 passes for 187 yards. His record as the Patriots' starting 
quarterback is 0-8. 
</P>
<P>
Rust said he considered replacing Wilson with Steve Grogan in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"But then I looked out on the field and thought that Marc was delivering the 
ball well," he said. "He had to endure four drops in a row." 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave Miami its best start since 1984, the last time the team made 
the Super Bowl, and also gave the Dolphins their fourth consecutive win against 
intra-division rivals, the team's best such streak since 1986.

RED WINGS SPEED PAST CANADIENS

<TEXT>
<P>
The Detroit Red Wings are using their speed to get off to a fast start in the 
Norris Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Wings extended their unbeaten streak to five games with a fast-paced 
5-2 victory over the Montreal Canadiens Thursday night at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Yzerman scored two goals as the Red Wings (4-0-1) won their fourth 
consecutive home game to stay in the division lead with 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
"We skated well with them and scored on rebounds," said Bryan Murray, who is in 
his first season as coach and general manager of the Red Wings. "That's what we 
want our guys to do. We want them to play with discipline. You have to have 
pretty good speed to do that, and we think we do. 
</P>
<P>
"We're gaining confidence. We're getting some pretty good plays now." 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Jean-Claude Bergeron, making his NHL debut, handled 24 shots in the 
Canadiens' goal. Tim Cheveldae handled 25 shots for Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little bit nervous," Bergeron said. "When you're nervous, the puck 
seems to have eyes. It finds holes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure I'm going to get used to it in a couple games." 
</P>
<P>
Marc Habscheid's goal gave Detroit a 1-0 lead at 9:51 of the first period. 
</P>
<P>
Gerard Gallant put Detroit ahead, 2-0, at 9:01 of the second period on a 
give-and-go with Dave Barr. 
</P>
<P>
"With four good lines, they can't key on one line anymore," Gallant said. "It 
takes a lot of pressure off." 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 5, Quebec 4 -- Norman Lacombe scored midway through the third 
period at Philadelphia to give the Flyers their fifth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers played without right winger Tim Kerr, whose wife, Kathy, died 
Tuesday, 10 days after giving birth. Team chaplain John Casey recited a prayer 
before the game in her memory. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 3, Toronto 0 -- Jocelyn Lemieux broke a scoreless tie with a goal in 
the second period at Chicago and Ed Belfour notched his first career shutout as 
the Blackhawks extended the Maple Leafs' winless streak to seven. 
</P>
<P>
The loss gave the Maple Leafs an 0-6-1 record -- worst in the NHL. The Maple 
Leafs have been held to 17 goals, the lowest number in the league. 
</P>
<P>
With Chicago only 15 seconds into its second power-play opportunity, Lemieux 
redirected Keith Brown's 55-foot slap shot past goalie Peter Ing at 11:52. 
</P>
<P>
Belfour, winning his fifth game, lowered his goals-against average to 1.72 per 
game, second best in the league. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 4, Calgary 3 -- Brett Hull scored two goals to lead the Blues at 
Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
Goaltender Vincent Riendeau stopped 29 shots to record his first victory over 
the Flames, who had beaten the Blues eight consecutive times. St. Louis last 
beat the Flames in Calgary on Feb. 5, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The victory also gave the Blues, who defeated the Edmonton Oilers, 5-2, on 
Tuesday, their first-ever Alberta Province sweep. 
</P>
<P>
Hull, who signed a $1.5-million contract with the Blues this summer, scored on 
a first-period tip-in and then floated a shot over the shoulder of Calgary 
goaltender Mike Vernon in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Hull leads the Blues' scoring with seven goals and two assists. 
</P>
<P>
Paul MacLean and Sergio Momesso also scored for the Blues, who were outshot, 
32-31. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames trailed 4-0 after two periods, but they scored three goals in the 
third period, including two only 16 seconds apart by Theoren Fleury and Paul 
Ranheim. 
</P>
<P>
Sergei Makarov scored Calgary's first goal five minutes into the final period.

O'BANNON UNDERGOES KNEE SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ed O'Bannon, a UCLA freshman who had ranked among the nation's top prep 
basketball players, underwent five hours of surgery Thursday to repair damage 
in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
"Surgery went well and Ed's knee was stable," said Dr. Michael R. Shapiro, who 
performed the operation at Sherman Oaks Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"He faces a period of rehabilitation. Although it is too soon to comment on his 
return, Ed is highly motivated and we believe it is possible for him to play 
basketball again," Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-8 O'Bannon suffered the injury during a pickup game at UCLA on Oct. 
9. 
</P>
<P>
He is expected to be sidelined for at least a year.

NEWSWIRE: COWBOYS SIGN UNHAPPY SOLOMON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Linebacker Jesse Solomon signed with the Dallas Cowboys for a large pay cut 
Thursday and participated in an afternoon workout. 
</P>
<P>
After practice, he blasted the Cowboys for not trading him, criticized the 
team's take-it-or-leave-it offer and even refused to shake owner Jerry Jones' 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
Solomon had been holding out since he turned down an offer reportedly worth $2 
million over three years. He said he reluctantly signed a two-year deal that 
will pay him $170,000 for the remainder of this season and $375,000 in 1991. 
Last year, he earned $460,000. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL's trading deadline was Tuesday, forcing Solomon either to accept the 
Cowboys' offer or to sit out the rest of the season.

FAST SYSTEM WITH MANY DRAWBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Race tracks in Illinois, Maryland and New Jersey have adopted an aberration 
called "fast official," and even Hollywood Park has shown an interest in a 
time-saving system whose time should never have come. 
</P>
<P>
With this method, there is less time between the finish and when the stewards 
hang up the race's payoffs on the tote board. That means more time to bet the 
next race and, theoretically, more money for the track. The tracks that use the 
system say it takes less time to run a full program, but even if that were 
true, this advantage is not enough to justify the drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Under "fast official," a jockey who wants to claim foul against another rider 
must notify an outrider before he dismounts. The outriders, those horsemen who 
escort the horses to the post, are equipped with radios and can relay foul 
claims to the stewards. If there are no claims, which is the case in most 
races, the jockeys are looking at the prices on the first three finishers 
before they ever talk to their trainers. 
</P>
<P>
Here is just one of the inequities of the system: It is virtually impossible 
for a trainer or an owner to put in an objection or to discuss the race with a 
rider who is thinking about lodging a claim. 
</P>
<P>
A number of years ago at a New York track, Cash Asmussen was riding a horse for 
trainer Red Terrell. They ran third in a race in which the jockey of the 
second-place horse claimed foul against the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Terrell and Asmussen had left the track and were discussing the race as they 
walked toward the jockeys' room. 
</P>
<P>
"The second horse claimed foul against the winner," Terrell said. 
</P>
<P>
"He did?" Asmussen said. "Gee, that second horse bothered me a little." 
</P>
<P>
With that, Terrell grabbed Asmussen by the arm, spun him around and all but 
dragged the jockey back to the winner's circle, where the phone to the stewards 
was nearby. 
</P>
<P>
They got there in time to register a foul claim, and after reviewing the video 
of the race, the stewards disqualified the first two horses and made the 
Terrell-Asmussen horse the winner. With "fast official," Terrell and Asmussen, 
and the betting public, would not have had this benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibit B: In New Jersey, a horse trained by Ben Perkins Sr. finished third. 
"Fast official" was in effect, and Perkins' rider, pulling up his horse, said 
he was unable to find the outrider in time to lodge an objection. By the time 
the jockey reached Perkins, the "official" sign had been posted. 
</P>
<P>
Perkins complained to the state's racing commission, and after a hearing, the 
board said the stewards had reviewed the tape of the race, anyway, and had 
concluded that Perkins' horse was not bothered even if there had been a foul 
claim. Perkins was out of luck. 
</P>
<P>
If these examples aren't enough reason to outlaw "fast official" and rescind 
the system wherever it has already crept in, consider the first running of the 
$250,000 Final Fourteen Stakes at Bay Meadows last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The horse finishing first in the race was disqualified by the stewards when the 
clerk of scales reported that his jockey weighed 2 1/2 pounds less coming back 
than he had going out. 
</P>
<P>
Under "fast official," there's no time to weigh the jockeys before the race 
becomes official. By not waiting for the postrace weigh-in, exponents of the 
system are in effect breaking a fundamental rule of racing every time out. The 
"fast official" fanatics used to rationalize the weigh-in quibble by asking, 
"When was the last time a jockey didn't have the right weight after a race?" 
That question can now be answered: "Quite recently." And in a $250,000 stake, 
to boot. 
</P>
<P>
"If tracks want the day to go faster, 'fast official' is not the answer," said 
Kentucky's Keene Daingerfield, the elder statesman of retired racing stewards. 
"All they have to do is get serious about honoring their nine post times." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jane du Pont Lunger, whose family is on the Forbes 400 list, has wealth 
estimated at more than $260 million, according to the current issue of the 
magazine. "Jane was the favored daughter," Forbes says. "She got $50 million to 
her sister's $2 million." Lunger's Go for Wand, who will run in the Breeders' 
Cup Distaff Oct. 27 at Belmont Park, is trying to become that rare filly to be 
voted horse of the year. Go for Wand would have a better chance at the title if 
she raced against males, in the Classic, but Lunger said: "I haven't run a 
filly against the boys in 52 years, and I never had any intention of running 
her in the Classic." 
</P>
<P>
Julie Krone, who became the first woman to ride in a Breeders' Cup race when 
she finished second aboard Darby Shuffle in the Juvenile Fillies at Churchill 
Downs in 1988, won a couple of stakes with Safely Kept in September, but Craig 
Perret, who has ridden the filly more often, has the mount for the Sprint. 
Perret became available when Housebuster was injured and retired for the year.

RUCKER'S 3 TOUCHDOWNS LIFT GLENDALE TO 21-14 WIN; 
</P>
<P>
PREP FOOTBALL: RUNNING BACK SCORES WINNING POINTS WITH LESS THAN TWO MINUTES TO 
PLAY, HELPING DYNAMITERS IMPROVE TO 7-0.

<P>
Almost from the opening kickoff, Pasadena High running back Jhayson Hall 
demonstrated that he was going to have an impact in Thursday's game against 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Hall rushed for 146 yards in 14 carries and two touchdowns in the first half, 
but it was his fourth-quarter fumble that set up Glendale's game-winning 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Pathon Rucker scored on a five-yard sweep with 1 minute 20 seconds left to lift 
host Glendale to a 21-14 victory in a Pacific League game. Glendale improved to 
7-0, the best start in school history. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena limited Rucker, who had been averaging 185 yards a game, to a 
season-low 75 yards, but the junior tailback scored all three Glendale 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 14-14, and 6:51 remaining, Alex Nielsen recovered Hall's 
fumble at the Pasadena 45-yard line. Glendale -- with Rucker carrying eight 
times for 46 yards -- needed 11 plays to convert the Pasadena mistake into a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale stopped Pasadena on downs on the next series, took possession with 22 
seconds remaining and ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good win for us," Glendale Coach Don Shoemaker. "We can't always 
expect to run over teams. We needed to learn how to come from behind. It's 
going to help us against Muir." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale, ranked eighth in the Southern Section Division II poll, improved to 
2-0 in league play and will meet Muir (4-2, 1-0) a week from today in a game 
that could decide the league championship. 
</P>
<P>
With Rucker tied up by the Pasadena defense, Glendale quarterback Eric Kiesau 
picked up the slack and completed eight of 13 passes for 109 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just me," Rucker said. "It was the whole team out there tonight. It 
was a sweet win." 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena took a 7-0 lead on a one-yard run by Hall on the game's opening series 
and went up, 14-0, on his 87-yard run with 6:51 remaining in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Less than three minutes later, Rucker capped a four-play, 62-yard drive with a 
five-yard run to cut the deficit to 14-6. On the preceding play, Kiesau 
connected with fullback Hector Maya on a 41-yard screen pass to set up Rucker's 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena was ruled offside on the point-after attempt and Glendale opted to go 
for two points. Rucker ran the ball in for the conversion to make it 14-8. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale shut down Pasadena on the ensuing series and Rucker scored on a 
one-yard plunge with 26 seconds remaining before the half to cap a 10-play 
drive and tie the score, 14-14.

TAFT BEATS EL CAMINO REAL WITHOUT BREAKING RANKS; 
</P>
<P>
CROSS-COUNTRY: TOREADORS SWEEP TOP FIVE PLACES IN PREPARATION FOR MT. SAC 
INVITATIONAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Taft High boys' cross-country team has learned to differentiate between 
low-key running and high-intensity racing. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for instance, the Toreadors' 15-44 dual-meet win over West Valley League 
rival El Camino Real on Thursday. Brian Godsey, Mike Krentzin, Kipp Ortenburger 
and Torino Carr ran in a tight pack at Pierce College, then fell into their 
"honor system" at the finish. 
</P>
<P>
The system, implemented by Coach Mel Hein, arranges the runners at the finish 
line according to their rank on the team. 
</P>
<P>
"The No. 3 and No. 4 runners are not going to jump ahead of Godsey just because 
they tied," Hein said. 
</P>
<P>
Godsey and Krentzin finished the three-mile race in 16 minutes 34 seconds and 
Ortenburger and Carr were each credited with 16:35. Freshman Cesar Rodriguez 
placed fifth in 16:45 to complete Taft's second consecutive 15-point league 
win. 
</P>
<P>
"That's all we wanted to do . . . nice and easy," Hein said of the win. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran them just as a workout," Godsey said. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Hurley finished sixth in 16:53 to lead El Camino Real (1-1 in league 
meets). 
</P>
<P>
The ease of the pace, though, came as a surprise to Krentzin, who has 
apparently recovered fully from a fracture in his foot that caused the junior 
to miss the state meet in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were running 18 minutes," Krentzin said. "But that's what you got 
to do or else you'll get mentally burned out." 
</P>
<P>
However Taft (3-0 overall in dual meets, 2-0 in league competition), the 
defending City Section champion, is not likely to finish in a tight group nor 
maintain an easy pace Saturday when it toes the starting line with nine of 
California's top 10 teams at the Mt. San Antonio College invitational in 
Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
City rival Belmont, which Taft regards as Public Enemy No. 1 after being 
upstaged twice by the Sentinels in invitationals this season, will try for a 
third win over its newest rival. 
</P>
<P>
Belmont won seven consecutive City titles before losing to Taft last year. 
Following Mt. SAC, Taft begins serious preparation for its title defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Next week, after Mt. SAC, (training) is going to be tough," Krentzin said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yep, 80-mile weeks," quipped Godsey. 
</P>
<P>
In other City dual meets at Pierce: 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando claimed its third North Valley League boys' title in a row with a 
22-35 thrashing of Kennedy. Kennedy's Jon Cohen won in 16:55, but the Tigers 
grabbed the next three places. 
</P>
<P>
The Taft girls' team defeated El Camino Real, 26-35, even though the 
Conquistadores took the first two places. 
</P>
<P>
Samantha Reed won in 20:25 and teammate Gina Zeno timed 21:26 in second. But 
Taft's superior depth prevailed as Estela Sanchez finished third (22:14) to 
pace the Toreadors (3-0, 2-0). 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando girls stunned Kennedy, 25-30, to win their second consecutive 
North Valley League title.

COLD-HEARTED 'CROSSING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"What's the rumpus?" is the byword among "Miller's Crossing's" Jazz Age 
mobsters. What is the rumpus, anyway, about this elegiac, stylish gangster 
movie (throughout San Diego County), the third feature from the brothers Coen? 
</P>
<P>
The Coens -- Joel directs, Ethan produces, they write together -- love old 
movies. "Blood Simple" was their Hitchcock, their stark little black film, its 
tongue very slightly in its cheek. It put them on the map. "Raising Arizona" 
was their stupefyingly madcap comedy, and for all those to whom it gave 
blinding headaches, it also introduced Holly Hunter, fair return for a few 
aspirins. 
</P>
<P>
With "Miller's Crossing," the Coens have turned to what they call the 
"dirty-town movie" of the '20s, full of casually violent gangster bosses, 
dangerous dames and ruthlessly tamped-down dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
It's a jump for them, in control and accomplishment, yet when you get past the 
luscious look of the piece and the roiling sound of its talk, it's a chilly 
film and foolishly light in the upper story. 
</P>
<P>
The Coens' love for the movies of the past is respectful in a clinical, remote 
way, as though films were museum-quality clocks, not pulsing, soulful things, 
warm and even inconveniently messy at times. Self-conscious formalism has been 
the Coens' signature. Before, when they've assembled their clockwork films, 
those movies -- for all their puddling blood or wacko action -- have been cool 
and smooth as plastic. 
</P>
<P>
"Miller's Crossing" certainly isn't plastic. It's dark and hushed as a men's 
club; it almost smells of polished leather and pricey cigars. When it isn't 
indoors, it's in arching, cathedral-like woods. It has somber, poetic images 
and an especially fine musical score that braids its Irish themes together 
hauntingly. 
</P>
<P>
Best of all, it has Albert Finney in a grand turn as Leo, the watchful Irish 
gangster boss. There is something about the sight of Finney, alone, at night 
and on the offensive, his cigar stub jammed into his dressing gown pocket, his 
crested slippers on his bare feet, his Thompson machine gun spitting sparks 
into the dark, that is breathtaking -- as filmmaking and as characterization. 
</P>
<P>
At Leo's right hand is Gabriel Byrne as the inscrutable Tommy, the most savvy 
lieutenant a boss could want except for his lousy luck at gambling and his 
invariable success with the ladies -- currently Verna, the lady of Leo's heart 
(Marcia Gay Harden). As Verna's brother, Bernie Bernbaum, there is John 
Turturro at his peak of smarmy perfection as a weasel only a sister could love, 
and you worry a little about her. 
</P>
<P>
Yet anything this stylish should have something to say, and "Miller's Crossing" 
is a declaration of serious but not altogether fathomable intentions. And 
unfortunately for a movie about friendship and loyalty, its diversions aren't 
enough to melt its cold, cold heart. 
</P>
<P>
Heart may be what the movie needs most, but a bit of clarity wouldn't hurt 
either. Even here in gangsterland, where random characters are cherished and 
non sequiturs are considered wisecracks, there is a difference between 
complications and impenetrability, and this plot is a bloody thicket. 
</P>
<P>
Broadly, the story revolves around Leo, Tommy and Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito). 
Caspar, the token Italian mobster, opens the film begging Leo for the right to 
kill Bernie, a bookie whom he calls "the schmatta" -- Yiddish for rag. Seems 
every time Caspar fixes a fight, Bernie screws the odds, making the fix almost 
pointless. 
</P>
<P>
But Leo won't fork over Bernie, partly because he won't be muscled, partly 
because Bernie is Verna's brother, and Leo's besotted with Verna. There is also 
the indelicate matter of Tommy and Verna, and Tommy, of course, is too 
honorable -- or too something -- to hide that forever. In the full-scale 
warfare that ensues, Tommy leaves Leo's side to go over to a rival and Leo 
disappears from the screen, leaving a hole the size of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne's Tommy remains at the center of things, the movie's iceman. He's 
supposed to be the ultimate loner, his brain whirring faster than everyone 
else's, his eyes shaded by that heavily symbolic hat. Byrne's beaky, promising 
face can hold us, but not forever. He's an opaque actor playing 
impenetrability, and it's possible to get tired of peering behind his 
remoteness for a glimpse at whatever's supposed to be inside. 
</P>
<P>
It's one of the movie's heavy jokes that Tommy is sapped, kicked, gut-punched, 
choked, thrown down three flights of stairs and beaten almost into 
insensibility, only to bounce back in the next scene, unscathed. With this 
ongoing insider joke, the Coens have their laugh but lose their audience.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: IT'S MORE FUN TO SELL SEX THAN PROTECTION 
</P>

TV's Risque Business 
</P>
<P>
* TV gives conflicting messages about sexuality. Entertainment programs employ 
sexual references daily. Yet the networks and most stations ban or discourage 
ads that deal frankly with birth control and AIDS protection. 
</P>
<P>
Sex, condoms and videotape. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: Television networks reject paid commercials for prophylactics out of fear 
of offending viewers who squirm at the mention of sex and AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: These same networks embrace TV scripts that emphasize casual sex, thus 
indirectly promoting the kind of indiscriminate lovemaking that feeds the AIDS 
epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
Hypocrites! 
</P>
<P>
TV is no bordello. While many mainstream theatrical movies continue showing 
sex, mainstream TV still just talks or giggles about it. 
</P>
<P>
In trying to compete with bawdier cable, however, the networks have 
dramatically increased their sexy patter this season. Far worse, they have done 
so at an hour -- 8 to 9 p.m. -- that is particularly accessible to young 
children, an hour once reserved for "family viewing." 
</P>
<P>
The A. C. Nielsen Co. estimates that a whopping 12.6 million children between 
the ages of 2 and 11 watch TV from 8 to 9. Obviously, their lives are shaped by 
more than what they watch on TV. Nevertheless, here is some of what's been 
available to them this season in comedies airing at that hour: 
</P>
<P>
* On the premiere of "Uncle Buck" on CBS, a woman suggested to Buck that they 
"do it" under the table. 
</P>
<P>
In a more recent episode, Buck's teen-age niece greeted his girlfriend at the 
door. "Can I help you?" the niece asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Because if she can't, I can," cracked her 7-year-old brother as he hitched up 
his pajama bottoms. 
</P>
<P>
In the same episode, Buck weighed his girlfriend's marriage proposal. "Before 
you decide," a friend advised, "I'd give all your organs the right to vote." 
</P>
<P>
* NBC this week ran a promo for "Grand" during a "Ferris Bueller" station 
break. In the promo, guest star John Goodman appeared to be coming on to a 
woman at a bar when he said: "I have a bomb in my pants." 
</P>
<P>
* In an episode of ABC's "Who's the Boss?," Mona the grandmother told daughter 
Angela that she was planning to join her boyfriend at a jazz club. His nickname 
is "Fingers." 
</P>
<P>
Angela: "What instrument does he play?" Mona: "He doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
* On the season premiere of NBC's "A Different World," a female student decided 
to sleep with a suitor to please him, and ultimately didn't do it only because 
a homeless Japanese girl moved in with the guy instead. In a promo for 
Thursday's episode of the same series, Whitley the spoiled debutante attempted 
to win back her boyfriend, who had dropped her for another woman. She was seen 
kissing him passionately, then pushing him downward. 
</P>
<P>
* On the season premiere of CBS' "Doctor, Doctor," there were references to 
pimps, foreplay and sperm. 
</P>
<P>
* On the premiere of Fox's "Parker Lewis Can't Lose," Parker confronted his 
high school principal with a video of her in a steamy embrace with a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
* Aphrodisiacs were discussed in an early scene in the premiere of "The Flash" 
on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
* On a recent episode of NBC's "Fresh Prince," Prince's trendy teen cousin told 
him she had gotten a tattoo with her boyfriend's initials. "Where no one will 
see it," the boyfriend added. 
</P>
<P>
* The premiere of NBC's "Hull High" included a story line about a female 
student posing nude in the boy's locker room for a photography assignment. The 
same episode also showed boys ogling the wiggly posterior of a sexy female 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
* The new male teacher in ABC's "Head of the Class" has the hots for the 
gorgeous assistant principal to the extent that in one episode he told his 
students that seeing her made him "randy," or sexually aroused. 
</P>
<P>
* Vasectomy and pregnancy were the major focus of the premiere of "Evening 
Shade" on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
* The season premiere of ABC's "The Wonder Years" had the narrator, as the teen 
Kevin, reporting that French kissing his girlfriend Winnie was one of his 
summer activities. There was also a scene showing Kevin and his friends 
eyeballing a girl sunbathing in a two-piece suit with her top undone. "She 
wants us," one of the boys said. 
</P>
<P>
In another episode, Kevin's friend, Paul, revealed that he was a virgin. 
</P>
<P>
* In a coming episode of "The Simpsons" on Fox, the state's governor is said to 
have been "felt up" by her boyfriend when she was younger. 
</P>
<P>
And so on and so on. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that these excerpts are all gratuitously raunchy or necessarily meant 
to titillate. On the contrary, they range from the unredeeming crudeness of 
"Uncle Buck" to the honest and sensitive portrayals of youthful sexual 
exuberance in "The Wonder Years." Moreover, many of the present crop of 8-to-9 
p.m. series happen to center on high schoolers, making sexual awareness a 
natural theme. 
</P>
<P>
However, it's the sheer number of these casual, often flip, sexual and 
anatomical references that is appalling, indicating that the front lines in the 
Big Three networks' war against Fox -- and all four networks' competition with 
cable -- have been extended to early prime time. 
</P>
<P>
Extending well beyond the relatively isolated examples of past seasons, the 
shows cited above represent a massive infusion of sexual content in early 
evening, a disturbing and profoundly irresponsible programming trend that 
exposes young and impressionable viewers to a set of potentially desensitizing 
values concerning sexual behavior. 
</P>
<P>
What warped universe is TV living in, anyway? At a time when AIDS is still an 
awesome peril and the teen pregnancy rate is still as swollen as an expectant 
mother's belly, a segment of TV is cavalierly implying to kids that sex is as 
routine as their sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
But no national commercials for prophylactics on ABC, CBS and NBC. No AIDS 
public-service announcements that say those naughty words condom and rubber, 
either. When it comes to these, the networks abruptly become born-again 
puritans. 
</P>
<P>
TV's entertainment programs promote the sex. Let someone else promote the 
protecting. 
</P>
<P>
It was in 1975 that the television industry -- feeling the hot breath of the 
Federal Communications Commission, which was being pushed by Congress -- 
adopted something called the "family viewing hour." Actually, it was two hours 
-- 7 to 9 p.m. -- the idea being that entertainment programs appropriate only 
for the entire family (sex and violence unwelcome) would be aired in this block 
of time. 
</P>
<P>
Although possibly well-intended, the concept had the scent of censorship and 
became embroiled in a legal challenge. Meanwhile, as the 1970s gave way to the 
Ronald Reagan epoch of deregulation that loosened the bonds of responsibility 
on all of broadcasting, the "family viewing hour" concept died of attrition. 
Now, nary a trace remains. 
</P>
<P>
This is no prude's lament, and a "family hour" inscribed in stone may indeed be 
going too far. But let's have some restraint here. Haven't viewers the right to 
expect at least a small slice of squeaky-clean prime-time in this prurient pie? 
</P>
<P>
Even if you're the parent of a 7-year-old and no square. Even if you're hip. 
Even if you're urbane. Even if you like sexy stories and racy jokes. Even if 
you saw "Henry &amp; June" and were turned on. Somewhere, shouldn't there be 
just a little bit of TV that you can watch in the presence of your child 
without feeling uncomfortable or being ambushed by a raw one-liner? Shouldn't 
you also be able to leave your kid alone in front of the set at 8 p.m. and be 
confident that he or she will not get a wisecracking lesson in human anatomy, 
sitcom-style, or hear from guys with bombs in their jeans? 
</P>
<P>
Of course you should. But the trend is just the opposite. So write the networks 
if you don't like what you see. In no way is this a plea to sanitize all of TV, 
only to make a small portion of it a little bit saner.

Fewer Bureaus for ABC News: ABC News is planning to close domestic bureaus in 
Dallas, Chicago and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve employees will be affected by the move and ABC will attempt to reassign 
them. Correspondent Chris Bury in Chicago will work out of the ABC-owned 
station there. The network will keep a production crew in Boston with Dr. 
Timothy Johnson, a medical reporter who appears on several ABC shows, but the 
bureau will be downgraded to an office. In Dallas, correspondent Charlie Murphy 
will work out of his home, while a cameraman and assistant there will be laid 
off or placed elsewhere. CLAUDIA PUIG

Berkeley Returns Rare Music: Rare manuscripts of music by composers Wolfgang 
Amadeus Mozart and Franz Schubert taken from an Austrian monastery at the end 
of World War II and thought to be lost forever were returned to Austrian 
officials Thursday by UC Berkeley. The university bought the manuscripts from a 
former prison guard for $1,400 in 1976 and was unaware of their origin until 
contacted by officials of the 800-year-old Benedictine monastery, who noticed 
them in a catalogue. CLAUDIA PUIG

Cambodian Dancer Will Stay: The star performer in the Cambodian dance troupe 
that danced last month at the Los Angeles Festival has joined four fellow 
dancers in remaining in the United States rather than returning with her 
company, which left New York for Cambodia on Wednesday, the dancer's attorney 
confirmed Thursday. But dancer Yim Devi has not yet decided whether she will 
defect and request political asylum like the other dancers or whether she will 
merely stay as a visitor until her visa runs out Dec. 14. CLAUDIA PUIG

PASSIONATE KITCHELL VIEW OF 'BERKELEY IN SIXTIES'; 
</P>
<P>
DOCUMENTARY: THE FILM CHALLENGES THE NOTION THAT THE ACTIVISTS WERE MOSTLY 
ADVENTURERS ON A SHALLOW QUEST FOR KICKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Violence was such an omnipresent fact on some major university campuses in the 
1960s that, for some of us, it's difficult to recall student life without 
getting instant chaotic flashes: mass marches, demonstrations with bullhorns, 
bloody confrontations, students scattering as canisters explode, the acrid 
teary stink of the gas, distant gunshots or fires raging ominously in the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Did all this happen? Did once placid groves of academe explode into street 
fights and tumult? Mark Kitchell's superb, heartfelt documentary, "Berkeley in 
the Sixties" (Ken Cinema, through Saturday only), reminds us that indeed they 
did. 
</P>
<P>
Kitchell's subject is Berkeley, the campus widely regarded as flash point for 
all radical student activity in the decade. And, in the course of his densely 
packed and continuously absorbing two hours, he shows every major event: from 
the early civil rights and free-speech protests through the inferno of the 
Vietnam War clashes, to the increasingly mock-apocalyptic, theatrical and 
half-crazy escapades of the years after the Kennedy and King assassinations. 
</P>
<P>
The movie is both coherent and inclusive. It distills the '60s expertly, both 
evoking and commenting on the era. It brings back the major players: 
free-speech dynamo Mario Savio, stuttering with anger; glum California 
president Clark Kerr; poet Allen Ginsberg; and Black Panther Huey Newton. It 
fills the sound track with the Grateful Dead and Country Joe and the Fish. We 
are continuously swung back and forth between the violent immediacy of events 
and reflections on riots past. 
</P>
<P>
Kitchell's form is conventional: 15 main interviews cut into a wealth of 
archival material. His tone is celebratory and reflective, just like his main 
interviewees, who project pride at their youthful fire and idealism, twinges of 
regret at opportunities lost, naivete exposed. 
</P>
<P>
There is one important perception in "Berkeley." It attacks the idea -- 
popularly held among their opponents -- that '60s activists were mostly 
irresponsible adventurers, pursuing allegedly idealistic goals out of a shallow 
quest for kicks. ("Civil rights panty raids" one nabob sneeringly describes 
their efforts.) 
</P>
<P>
No doubt Vietnam's violence fueled violence on some campuses. It's possible 
some young male protesters were driven to demonstrate physical courage to 
deflect the argument that they opposed a war to save their hides. But, over and 
over, one is struck by how seriously these activists took their actions, how 
they weighed -- even years after the fact -- their consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Contrastingly, one is struck by how unserious their establishment foes often 
seem: Lyndon Johnson, who seems to be trying to stare down the camera as he 
unleashes each new prevarication; Kerr, who seems somehow dead behind the eyes; 
and Ronald Reagan, who emerges here as a somewhat comical figure, reading with 
purse-lipped outrage a report from Ed Meese on the "sensual gyrations" taking 
place at a student dance, or erupting into schoolmarmish petulance at a news 
conference, scolding his questioners for coddling ruffians. The hipper Reagan 
media image came a decade later, when he ran for President. 
</P>
<P>
Is "Berkeley in the Sixties" (Times-rated: family, despite mature themes and 
discussion) objective? Of course not. No one could make a film like this, 
independently, without immense passion for the subject, and the political 
passions of Kitchell and his co-workers (editor Veronica Selver, 
cinematographer Stephen Lighthill) show through clearly.

RIFKIN, BILSON GUESTS AT CHAMBER GROUP OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After six weeks of living an energetic, performance-filled life playing for 
Music Center Opera, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, which began its own 
season at Ambassador Auditorium, seemed less than vigorous. 
</P>
<P>
Blame the conductor. This ensemble, one of the more enthusiastic and responsive 
orchestras in the state, usually reflects the personality of the person in 
charge on any particular occasion. This week, the leader is ragtime and Bach 
specialist Joshua Rifkin, making his first appearances with the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Rifkin's program, scheduled to be repeated tonight at the Japan America 
Theatre, is an intriguing one on the page, offering colorful, early 
Classical-period symphonies by J.C. Bach and Haydn, and keyboard concertos by 
Mozart and C.P.E. Bach. In performance, it doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
Or didn't work Wednesday night, when a festive audience in the Pasadena 
showplace was treated to untidy and unmotivated readings of works apparently 
lacking in charm and wit. Experience tells us the lack is not in the composers. 
</P>
<P>
What the 27-member ensemble played best was the evening's closer, Haydn's 
Symphony No. 78, given, despite Rifkin's windmill-tilting conducting style, a 
well-paced, sensible run-through. Not all the contrasts came into focus and not 
all the details shone, but the piece emerged neatly enough. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the program, J.C. Bach's Sinfonia in G minor, a wondrous 
and eccentric relic of 1770, exposed what was probably a serious lack of 
rehearsal; it certainly revealed the difficulty this resourceful orchestra must 
have had in following this guest conductor. Nevertheless, the placement of the 
two symphonies on this agenda could be justified. 
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of Mozart's first original piano concerto, usually called No. 9, 
also made sense. It is, as is well known by now -- 40 years ago it was not -- 
irresistible and cherishable, songful, ebullient and virtuosic. 
</P>
<P>
Fortepianist Malcolm Bilson, however, seemed to downplay all its virtues, in a 
performance of dutiful regularity. The piece we have long considered 
irrepressibly jaunty became merely pedestrian. With a prevailing lack of 
imagination, Rifkin and the orchestra contributed erratically to this 
impression. 
</P>
<P>
Superfluous in this context was the inclusion of a novelty, C.P.E. Bach's 
Concerto in E-flat for Harpsichord and Fortepiano (1788), a fragmented, 
episodic and ambivalent work of strange timbres and oddball textures. Weird, 
yes; wonderful, hardly. Conductor Rifkin presided from the harpsichord. Bilson, 
seated far upstage, and not visible to large portions of the audience, played 
the complicated and showy fortepiano solos in a frenzy of reliability. 
</P>
<P>
Before the scheduled program, Rifkin conducted the orchestra in Samuel Barber's 
Adagio for Strings, in memory of Leonard Bernstein, who died Sunday. DANIEL

'NEW' CLEVELAND QUARTET BOWS AT BING THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the decidedly with-it crowd that packed the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Art's Bing Theater Wednesday evening, the Cleveland Quartet's playing rather 
than their repertory was most likely the chief attraction. 
</P>
<P>
This was, after all, the local debut of the revamped ensemble, a new first 
violinist having recently signed on. 
</P>
<P>
His name is William Preucil, the concertmaster of the Atlanta Symphony a few 
seasons back. If the Cleveland wanted to radically change its aural and 
interpretive image through his acquisition, it have do done so in the most 
positive terms. 
</P>
<P>
This has been a frustrating group during its 20-odd-year past, loaded with 
talent but frequently raw in tone and interpretively unsettled, its fortunes 
rising and falling on the erratic bow and high-strung temperament of its 
brilliant founding first violinist, Donald Weilerstein, who left to pursue a 
solo career. 
</P>
<P>
Preucil is a cooler number, his tone smaller and sweeter than Weilerstein's, 
his interpretive instincts better integrated with the lively but rational 
attitudes of his colleagues, second violinist Peter Salaff and cellist Paul 
Katz (both founders) and violist James Dunham, a hero of our local scene prior 
to joining the Cleveland a few seasons back.

Monday's program opened with the Mozart D-minor Quartet, K. 421, a shakedown 
cruise for two wobbly movements, settling down in the Minuet to establish the 
evening's ultimately satisfying tone. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, one could revel in the skewed lyricism of Berg's Opus 3 Quartet, 
projected with stunning linear clarity and clear-eyed perception of its 
heaving, sighing, singing heart. And, finally, Beethoven's First "Rasumovsky" 
Quartet, played with irresistible warmth, rhythmic agility and impeccable 
ensemble balance. HERBERT GLASS

'QUIGLEY': NEW PREMISE, OLD TERRITORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Quigley Down Under," the new Tom Selleck movie, has the panoramic scope of a 
movie epic but the soul of a television movie. It's about Matthew Quigley 
(Selleck), a sharpshooter from Wyoming who hires himself out to a slimy cattle 
baron (Alan Rickman) in western Australia only to discover that his job entails 
picking off aborigines. In retaliation, he tries to pick off his employer. 
</P>
<P>
The film's 1860s period details and Panavision outback vistas are sumptuous 
without being very exciting; it's the Window Dressing school of movie-making. 
For audiences whose experiences with epics is limited to the small screen, 
"Quigley" (citywide) will probably go down very easily. It's affably 
inconsequential. 
</P>
<P>
The film's premise, however, is interesting enough to rate a larger scope. 
"Quigley" is a new-style revisionist Western, with aborigines replacing 
American Indians, and dingoes standing in for coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
At first, it's kicky watching the film's Wild West conventions played out in 
the outback; everything seems familiar yet slightly out of kilter. For 
Americans, the genocidal push of the white settlers in Australia against the 
aborigines plays like a variation on our own sorry history. Director Simon 
Wincer ("Lonesome Dove") doesn't employ the aborigines as Stone Age savages. He 
gives them their due -- their dignity. 
</P>
<P>
He gives them so much dignity, in fact, that their destruction takes over the 
movie and wipes out the rest of the action. Quigley is partnered throughout 
most of the film with a woman known as Crazy Cora (Laura San Giacomo), who has 
been loco ever since she accidentally suffocated her baby in a Comanche raid in 
the States years before. Cora drifts in and out of sanity, but what really gets 
Quigley's goat is that she persists in calling him "Roy" -- the name of the 
husband who left her. As they trek across the outback, pursued by the cattle 
baron's riflemen, they strike up a daffy, easygoing camaraderie. Their scenes 
together are alternately cartoonish and "sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
Their periodic forays into aboriginal territory take the film into more serious 
terrain, but the scenes are too short. And there's another problem. Even though 
Wincer and screenwriter John Hill are careful to humanize the aborigines, 
Quigley is set up as their savior. He's the Great White Father figure in this 
genocidal tragedy, and there's more than a whiff of paternalism in the 
conception. It's never pointed out that Quigley's powers as a savior reside 
almost entirely in the barrel of his custom-made, six-foot Sharps rifle. 
Compared to the aborigines' arsenal of spears and darts, he's practically 
Superman. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Selleck, with his relaxed, TV-star presence, fits into this movie's 
undemanding scheme. He's self-confidently mild, and he keeps the film watchable 
without imparting any darker shades to Quigley's do-good-ism. (Quigley won't 
even sleep with Cora until she calls him by his real name.) San Giacomo seems a 
bit too urban and wised-up for her role's moist sentimentality. She overdoes 
the looniness but she's better in Cora's lucid moments. She seems almost 
thankful for those moments. 
</P>
<P>
As in "Die Hard," Alan Rickman steals the movie (rated PG-13). His cattle baron 
is a transplanted Britisher who idolizes the American West and fancies himself 
a man out of his element. He thinks he really belongs in Dodge City going toe 
to toe with Wyatt Earp. Rickman gives this skunk's character such an oily 
finesse that his killing sprees play like black comedy. Rickman is the best 
man-you-love-to-hate villain the screen has seen in ages and, clearly, he has 
it in him to be a lot more than that -- as anyone who saw him on stage in "Les 
Liaisons Dangereuses" will attest. He's a classically trained actor with a 
relish for high-gloss smarm, and his infernal delight is infectious. 
</P>
<P>
The best thing about "Quigley Down Under" is that it keeps him alive for so 
long.

A TRIBUTE TO PHILIP LARKIN IN PLATER'S 'SWEET SORROW' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alan Plater's "Sweet Sorrow," a fond salute to the late British poet Philip 
Larkin at the Irvine Barclay Theatre, unfolds with the stately pace of an 
oceanliner being winched through the Panama Canal. 
</P>
<P>
It moves inevitably toward the sea and you are either fascinated by its slow 
passage or you find yourself measuring the inexorable march, inch by inch. In 
this case, about midway through the first act, my fascination was overwhelmed 
by a distinct lack of dramatic tension. 
</P>
<P>
The play, which runs through Sunday, has the tone of a didactic elegy written 
both to display the virtues of Larkin's poetry (spare, lovely and ironic) and 
to illustrate his personality (gently humorous, reticent, self-deprecating). 
</P>
<P>
But "Sweet Sorrow" is not, as the director John Godber (whose "Bouncers" was a 
Los Angeles hit in 1986) has claimed, an examination of the artist's role in 
society. It does not probe that deeply. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Plater has written an affectionate account of four fans who gather 
once a year to pay tribute to Larkin on the anniversary of their first meeting, 
a jam-packed memorial service held for him at Westminster Abbey in 1986. They 
listen to his favorite jazz, drink some wine, read some of his work aloud. 
</P>
<P>
For this particular gathering, their fourth, they have come to Hull, the town 
on the northeast English coast where one of them lives and where Larkin used to 
work as a university librarian. While they are toasting him, the dead poet 
himself shuffles onto the white set drenched in white light to the strains of 
Louis Armstrong's "West End Blues." 
</P>
<P>
John Scarborough, outfitted in a charcoal-gray suit and black-framed glasses, 
looks virtually as Larkin did in life -- like a self-described "balding salmon" 
-- to all outward appearances the complete personification of a routine 
existence. 
</P>
<P>
Larkin is touched by the celebration, even flattered, but as the wistful 
evening goes on, he is also a little concerned. For all the members of this 
worshipful band have a tale to tell about how one or another of his poems has 
changed their lives. This is a responsibility Larkin would rather not shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does he have to, because each of their revelations -- how a teacher's job 
was lost, a housewife's marriage broken, a vicar's faith destroyed -- rarely 
seems more than the pretext to recite a particular poem. "Sweet Sorrow" plays, 
in fact, like an elaborately embroidered poetry reading. 
</P>
<P>
The stories, acted out in miniature scenes, serve as bridges to get from one 
poem to the next. Moreover, all four characters are eager to relieve Larkin of 
any burden. Says Charles, the vicar who has been de-faithed but not defrocked: 
"You didn't destroy my faith. It was already destroyed. You simply described 
the vacuum." 
</P>
<P>
Happily, one thing neither they nor the playwright do in their enthusiasm is 
turn Larkin into an idol with feet of clay. He remains for us what Sidney 
Bechet's music was for him: "an enormous yes." It is only the play that is a 
little maybe. 
</P>
<P>
That notwithstanding, the production by the Hull Truck Theatre Company is 
flawlessly acted and immaculately staged. 
</P>
<P>
"Sweet Sorrow" had its world premiere in August at the Edinburgh Festival. It 
also played for five weeks in Hull, where the touring company is based, and a 
week in London. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. premiere at the Irvine Barclay is being presented as part of Orange 
County's Festival of Britain, a combination arts celebration and retail 
promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4242 Campus Drive, Irvine, today at 8 p.m.; Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m.; 
Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m. $19 to $28; (714) 854-4646.

JAZZ NOTES: UNKNOWN LOUIS ARMSTRONG RECORDINGS FOUND; 
</P>
<P>
RARITIES: SIX TRACKS FROM 1929-30 ARE NOT DAMAGED OR WORN. 'THEY BLAST,' SAYS 
THE PRODUCER WHO UNEARTHED THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For lovers of early jazz, the discovery of six previously unknown performances 
by trumpeter Louis Armstrong is akin to the discovery of King Tut's tomb. 
</P>
<P>
"A find like this comes along once in a lifetime," said producer Michael 
Brooks, who ran across the Armstrong sessions serendipitously earlier this 
year. "Nothing new from this period has been found in 50 years. For a jazz 
record collector, it's akin to finding another draft of 'The Great Gatsby' or 
the missing (edited) footage from 'The Magnificent Ambersons'." 
</P>
<P>
The selections, from 1929 and 1930, include two versions of "After You've 
Gone," two of "St. Louis Blues," one of "Dallas Blues" and another of "I Ain't 
Got Nobody." The first two have just been reissued on "Louis Armstrong in New 
York, Volume 6" (Columbia Jazz Masterpieces). The remaining four will be issued 
in early 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks, who has been a free-lance producer at CBS for almost 20 years, came 
upon his gold mine when he was in the middle of a reissue project. He noticed 
that one of the production sheets for an Armstrong session had a penciled 
notation that had been erased. "I rubbed it out and found a set of matrix 
numbers which had nothing to do with Louis," he recalled. "I went to the CBS 
files and found a card which showed we had a master of the tracks. I ordered 
the master up and found it was unissued Louis Armstrong material." 
</P>
<P>
The six tracks were originally recorded for the Odeon and Parlophone labels, 
offshoots of CBS that were started in England but were used in this country 
mainly to provide instrumental dance music for Latin American markets. After 
the initial find, Brooks called up all the Odeon and Parlophone masters -- only 
about 100 existed, he said -- and found the additional four Armstrong tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Of particular interest is the fact that all the tracks are instrumental 
versions of songs released by Armstrong as vocals. On four of the newly found 
sides, Armstrong plays an interpretation of the song's melody in place of his 
original vocal. But on "St. Louis Blues," which will be released in February, 
trumpeter Red Allen plays the part originally taken by Armstrong's vocal, then 
the maestro adds his own improvisation to climax the selection. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks was astounded at his good fortune. "It's amazing that these still 
existed, that they weren't thrown out for scrap during World War II, when CBS 
scrapped tens of thousands of (the metal) parts (that early shellac 78 r.p.m. 
recordings were made from)." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the thrill of simply finding these rarities, Brooks was ecstatic about 
the sound of the takes. "Nobody has played these," he said. "They've never been 
pressed, so they're not damaged or worn. They blast. They are magnificent 
records." 
</P>

'PARTY' A SKILLFUL MIX OF VIRGINIA WOOLF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A party can be very theatrical. 
</P>
<P>
Stars and supporting players come and go. Intense impressions of each other are 
based on a few sketchy fragments of information. People think one thing and say 
another. The overall effect can be exhilarating or excruciating. Finally, all 
of the effort creates nothing more permanent than memories. 
</P>
<P>
It's like many a play. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Woolf took her readers behind the scenes, so to speak, into the brains 
of several partygoers at Mrs. Dalloway's London house and garden, and Ellen 
McLaughlin has combined three of the resulting short stories into a miniature 
play, "The Party." 
</P>
<P>
This 40-minute, one-woman show, which opened the Mark Taper Forum's season at 
the Itchey Foot restaurant last weekend and plays only through this weekend, is 
a crystal-clear demonstration of how to conjure up worlds of thought and 
feeling from the apparently trivial, using only the barest of production 
values. 
</P>
<P>
Tall, majestic Kathleen Chalfant tells the stories and enacts all of the roles 
to perfection, directed by David Esbjornson. The sleek elegance of her 
neo-Grecian look, juxtaposed with the skittering sensations running through the 
minds of her characters, creates moments of surprisingly high-pitched humor as 
well as piercing insight. 
</P>
<P>
Mabel Waring, of "The New Dress," is the funniest creation. She hoped to create 
a little excitement out of her humdrum life by wearing an exotic old-fashioned 
dress to the party. Upon her arrival, however, the charms of the dress 
disappear and she feels mortified not only at her choice of outfit but also at 
her own ability to be so easily mortified. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine Cathy Guisewite's "Cathy" in the 1920s, expressing her anxieties in the 
prose of Virginia Woolf instead of a comic strip balloon. 
</P>
<P>
In "Together and Apart," Mr. Serle and Miss Anning exchange what would sound 
like the most perfunctory of pleasantries. But Woolf and Chalfant dissect the 
accompanying thoughts so thoroughly, so perceptively, that we quickly agree 
with Miss Anning that "nothing is so strange as human intercourse." 
</P>
<P>
In "A Summing Up," Sasha Latham and Bertram Pritchard stroll in the garden. 
While Bertram prattles on, Sasha looks at the scenery, and her thoughts veer 
wildly between hope and despair for all of humankind. 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin wove the three stories together with a fluid and subtle touch, and 
Garth Hemphill's lighting artfully highlights the transitions between stories. 
Unlike many of the Taper's Itchey Foot productions, this one is polished to a 
fine gleam -- no scripts in hand for Chalfant. It deserves a much longer life. 
</P>
<P>
 At 801 W. Temple St., Saturday at 2 and 6 p.m., Sunday at at 6 p.m. $8; (213) 
972-7337.

HOME TECH: MORE LEONARD BERNSTEIN RELEASES SET; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: SONY AND DEUTSCHE GRAMMOPHON PLAN EXPANDED RELEASE SCHEDULES OF 
RECORDINGS BY THE LATE CONDUCTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Recordings by Leonard Bernstein, one of the most documented conductors in 
history, will undergo expanded release programs following the conductor's death 
on Sunday, said representatives of the recording companies controlling the late 
Bernstein's catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
Executives of Sony Classical and Deutsche Grammophon, which control the bulk of 
Bernstein's recorded legacy, and BMG Classics/RCA Red Seal plan to step up 
timetables to deliver more Bernstein recordings to the marketplace. However, 
most of the repertory will be from previously released recordings, including 
some made early in his career. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the only new recordings will be out next month -- as originally 
scheduled, reported Karen Moody, vice president of Deutsche Grammophon. These 
are recent recordings Bernstein made with the New York Philharmonic 
(Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony), the Vienna Philharmonic (two Mozart symphonies 
and the clarinet concerto) and Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam (Schubert's 
Symphonies Nos. 5 and 8). 
</P>
<P>
At Sony Classical (formerly CBS Records) in New York City, Peter Munves, 
director of marketing, said this week that in January the company will begin 
its three-year release of "The Bernstein Collection": "We will release 75 CDs 
of Bernstein performances, including not only symphonic music by Beethoven and 
others, but also oratorio performances -- works by Haydn, and the Requiems by 
Berlioz and Verdi -- and other music never before released on CD." 
</P>
<P>
At Deutsche Grammophon, also in New York, Wende Persons, director of promotion, 
reported: "We are looking at (Bernstein's) active DG discography, which 
contains over 100 different recordings, and making sure everything is 
available. 
</P>
<P>
"That's 120 titles (of standard classical repertory) and some of Bernstein's 
own (non-theatrical) music, plus another dozen videos." In his last years, 
Bernstein recorded exclusively for DG. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Deutsche Grammophon released in this country a 12-CD set of 
Bernstein recordings with the Vienna Philharmonic, Israel Philharmonic and L.A. 
Philharmonic. These recordings were made between 1977 and 1985 of music by 
Beethoven, Brahms, Bernstein, Haydn, Mozart, Stravinsky, Tchaikovsky and 
Gershwin. Called "The Bernstein Edition," it is being sold concurrently in 
Europe in a 25-CD set. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Moody, vice president of the classical label, would not reveal sales 
figures for "The Bernstein Edition," but said: "I can say that it is selling 
very well in this country, surprisingly well, given the U.S. market aversion to 
CD sets." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Carol Brown, West Coast manager of sales and marketing for BMG 
Classics/RCA Red Seal, told The Times on Thursday that her label now plans a 
March release of recordings by Bernstein conducting the RCA Symphony in 
Copland's "Billy the Kid" and a suite from Bernstein's "On the Town," 
recordings made in the 1940s, and representing the conductor/composer's first 
commercial recordings. 
</P>
<P>
BMG also plans, according to spokesman Carl Pritzkat, the spring release of an 
early Bernstein recording as pianist -- in which he plays Copland's Piano 
Variations -- as well as other recorded documents of the young 
composer/pianist. 
</P>
<P>
The entire Bernstein catalogue encompasses well over 200 classical recordings 
and occupies more than a full page in the Schwann catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
There is very little available on Bernstein in the home-video market, which is 
no surprise considering there are so few classical music titles on cassette. 
Three tapes of programs recorded in 1971, all on Phoenix/BFA Films and Video, 
are out: 
</P>
<P>
* "Bernstein on Beethoven: a Tribute," featuring Bernstein playing sections of 
Piano Concerto No. 1 in C Major. 
</P>
<P>
* "Bernstein on Beethoven: Fidelio," with rehearsal and concert footage of 
Bernstein working with the Vienna State Opera Company. 
</P>
<P>
* "Bernstein on Beethoven: Ode to Joy From the Ninth Symphony," featuring the 
Vienna State Opera Chorus and the Vienna Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
Three movies whose scores he composed are also on home video: 
</P>
<P>
* MGM/UA's "On the Town" (1949), co-starring Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. The 
lyrics are by Adolph Green and Betty Comden. 
</P>
<P>
* MGM/UA's "West Side Story" (1961), featuring Stephen Sondheim's lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
* RCA/Columbia's "On the Waterfront" (1954), the Oscar-winner for best picture.

HOME TECH / VIDEO: YOU MAY HAVE TO HUNT FOR 'RED OCTOBER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you have trouble finding a cassette of "The Hunt for Red October" after its 
home-video release Thursday, it may be due to a retailer protest over the high 
price set by Paramount. Some store owners are buying fewer copies than they 
normally do of a new hit movie. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Margo, executive vice president of the eastern Palmer Video chain, said 
that Paramount fell 50,000 to 75,000 copies short of its initial sales goal -- 
said to be at least 400,000. That would amount to a loss for Paramount of at 
least $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
But Eric Doctorow, Paramount's senior vice president, denied Thursday that the 
protest was having a significant effect. "We are pleased with what we've sold 
to retailers and distributors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Doctorow wouldn't reveal Paramount's sales goal but did say that the company 
would announce how many copies of "Hunt" it sold in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount's wholesale price rise, amounting to at least $5 per cassette, was 
necessitated by the company's rising expenses, Doctorow said. 
</P>
<P>
The increase pushes "Hunt" to a $99.95 retail price -- $10 above the industry 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
What retailers fear is that other video manufacturers will follow Paramount's 
lead in boosting wholesale prices. 
</P>
<P>
"The retailers have made it known to Paramount and the rest of the industry 
that a price rise that would push all hit movies to a $100 retail price is 
simply unacceptable," said Frank Lucca, president of the 622-store chain 
Flagship Entertainment Centers. 
</P>
<P>
"If all prices were that high," Margo said, "some retailers would be forced out 
of business." 
</P>
<P>
Margo said that his company cut its order of "Hunt for Red October" in half. 
Brad Burnside, who heads the Video Adventure chain in Evanston, Ill., said that 
his order was reduced by one-third. Industry trade magazines have been full of 
complaints by other irate retailers who claimed that they intended to do the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
Burnside said that not all retailers were acting simply to teach Paramount a 
lesson. "Many retailers simply can't afford to buy more," he said. "It means 
stretching budgets that have already been stretched the limit." 
</P>
<P>
In another form of protest, Margo said that he and other retailers also would 
be buying fewer of Paramount's B titles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a silent form of protest that is very effective," said Lucca, whose chain 
has been protesting by excluding Paramount product from its advertising and 
promotion campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount's Doctorow said that his company hasn't felt the effect of any 
B-title boycott. He did acknowledge that, since the sale of B titles has been 
down during the last year, it's difficult to gauge the effect of a boycott. 
</P>
<P>
Passing on the price increase to consumers in the form of a rental price rise 
is a possibility too -- but one all retailers would like to avoid. "Some people 
have raised prices," Margo said. "They've had no choice. But all you do is 
alienate customers."

'AMERICAN SPLENDOR' MINES THE ORDINARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you listen to Harvey Pekar long enough, you find yourself starting to think 
like him. That's why, in a strange, inexplicable way, listening to "American 
Splendor," director Vince Waldron's adaptation of Pekar's writings at 
Theatre/Theater, is likely to make you, if not a funnier person, a more 
observant one. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who has read the underground comics of R. Crumb has likely read Pekar's 
work, since they've been frequent collaborators since 1974. Crumb is by far the 
more famous, so one would think that Pekar writes to Crumb's dead-on visuals, 
full of overweight urbanites at wit's end. 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. Crumb draws to Pekar's dialogues, as do all of Pekar's other artist 
collaborators, which suggests what a crackling writer he is. What Waldron has 
done is allowed the words to stand apart for themselves and has let Harvey, 
played by Dan Castellaneta, speak for himself. 
</P>
<P>
The show's title comes from the comic book Pekar puts out each May -- we even 
find out why May, and not, say, June. In his introduction to an anthology of 
"American Splendor," Crumb provides the show's cue: "There is drama in the most 
ordinary and routine of days, but it's a subtle thing that gets lost in the 
shuffle." 
</P>
<P>
This is life from the little guy's point of view. Castellaneta's Pekar is ultra 
mild-mannered, quintessentially droll, not the kind of fellow to get into 
emotional highs or lows. He's kept his day job as a file clerk at the Cleveland 
V.A. office all these years because it keeps him in touch with folks. Without 
that, he explains, he couldn't write. 
</P>
<P>
He's no working-class hero, though. While relating his weird fling with a phony 
named Carla (Siobhan Fallon, phenomenal in this and several other roles), he 
admits that all he really wanted out of her was a few good rolls in the hay. 
What he can't take -- and this makes Harvey our kind of guy -- is the act she 
puts on, bad British accent and all. 
</P>
<P>
Pekar isn't that desperate for a woman, although he clearly has a hard time 
dealing with them, judging by his three marriages (Fallon returns as his most 
recent wife). He relates better to men: the quiet, wise Mr. Boats (Andy 
Wilson); the bookish Sid (David O'Shea), who always has dinner with his mom; 
the nerd Toby, and the verbosely Yiddish Emil (Richard Kuhlman, in a dazzling 
switch). 
</P>
<P>
The "driven, compulsive" Pekar of Crumb's description is nowhere to be found in 
Castellaneta's charming performance. It jibes with Pekar's obvious distaste for 
fame, punch lines and morals -- he's just observing. It's how he observes that 
makes "American Splendor" a perfect antidote to our nasty epoch.

<P>
SURREALISM: A SHOW OF 12 CALIFORNIA ARTISTS CONTAINS WORKS THAT DO JUSTICE TO 
ORIGINATORS OF MOVEMENT BUT ALSO INCLUDES PIECES THAT EXPLOIT ITS POPULARITY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a 1924 manifesto, Andre Breton introduced surrealism as "a new vice," 
delivering ecstatic freedoms to its addicts -- freedom from the contamination 
of reality, freedom from the entangling skeins of logic, freedom for the mind, 
the heart, the unconscious to roam at leisure. 
</P>
<P>
Surrealism's "mysterious effects and special pleasures" continue to tempt many 
an artist and seduce many a curator. This year's abundance of shows related to 
surrealism -- locally and elsewhere -- has turned the surrealist label into a 
catch-all of instant virtue. Certainly the heady conceptualism that reigns in 
today's art scene begs a more intuitive, sensuous antidote, but what is being 
passed off as contemporary surrealism doesn't always fit the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"Echoes of Surrealism" (at UC San Diego's Mandeville Gallery through Oct. 28) 
is a show of 12 contemporary California artists, and contains several 
resounding voices that do justice to the ghosts of Breton, et al., but also 
includes some weak, derivative whimpers that exploit the movement's popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Surrealism, from its inception, has always been less a style than a frame of 
mind. Defined as pure psychic automatism by Breton, surrealism suggests a 
sensibility devoid of reason, "exempt from any aesthetic or moral concern." 
Black humor, rebellious pride, fidelity to chance and a disdain for the 
regimental social order all made surrealism a potent postscript to the 
anarchism of Dada. Political critique was rarely spelled out in the art itself, 
but was present in the artists' own revolutionary acts, in their defiance of 
convention, their poetic poison arrows sent to the guardians of the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
Given this heritage, it is surprising how overt and literal much of the imagery 
is in the Mandeville show. Carolyn Cardenas paints a painstakingly detailed 
chronicle of decadence and despair in her hinged triptych, "West of Eden." An 
updated version of Hieronymus Bosch's "Garden of Earthly Delights," Cardenas' 
painting takes Southern California as its target, particularly its inhabitants' 
indulgences in carnal pleasures and material diversions. A couple soaks in a 
hot tub while the world around them erodes -- physically, ethically, socially. 
</P>
<P>
Like Cardenas, Deborah F. Lawrence engages in slick social satire that has 
little to do with surrealism's poetic subterfuge, but much to do with decaying 
value systems and art's impotent, though highly visible, role in this process. 
Lawrence's painted montages twist familiar icons of art and popular culture, 
from the Mona Lisa to Marilyn Monroe, into humorous, irreverent positions. 
</P>
<P>
Other artists in the show have pledged a little too much allegiance to 
individual members of the original surrealist circle. Mark Bryan aligns himself 
uncomfortably close to Rene Magritte, while Phyllis Shafer borrows heavily from 
Yves Tanguy. Their efforts are overly stylized. They haven't the freshness and 
startling oddity of their precedents from 60 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the bizarre, fantastic visions here, Paul Singdahlsen's have the 
greatest power to seep beneath the skin and abrade one's sense of security and 
order. A train crosses over a jagged chasm in one of his dark, bare-bones 
landscapes, richly drawn in pastel. In another, Singdahlsen lays out his 
haunting, apocalyptic vision of glowing, shell-like shelters beneath a 
ravenous, brooding sky. The first band of surrealists had dreams to mine -- 
this generation suffers nightmares.

ART NOTES: ARTIST GUERRERO'S DEPICTION OF TIJUANA NIGHT LIFE ON VIEW

Raul Guerrero's moody, provocative paintings of Tijuana night life made their 
local debut at the David Zapf Gallery downtown last year. A selection from the 
continuing series is now on view in a three-person show at the Saxon-Lee 
Gallery in Los Angeles (through Nov. 3). Next January, the David Zapf will 
celebrate its second anniversary with a solo exhibition of Guerrero's paintings 
and drawings. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Carlsbad recently announced that Guerrero's contribution to last 
summer's temporary public art exhibition in Carlsbad has been made permanent. 
Guerrero's tile bench on Carlsbad Boulevard and the incised rock trail by Jim 
Wilstermann and Machi Uchida, also made for the temporary show, were recently 
purchased by the city, marking the first time the city has bought -- rather 
than commissioned -- works of art for a public place. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego sculptor and installation artist Kenneth Capps will be exhibiting in 
New York from Oct. 27 to Dec. 8. His show at the Vera Engelhorn Gallery will 
consist of "steel drawings" and sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
Local sculptor David Beck-Brown was recently appointed artist-facilitator at 
the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Ysidro. Beck-Brown had been 
the director of Grossmont College's Hyde Gallery and will continue to curate 
exhibitions there. In his new position, Beck-Brown and several other artists 
will work with inmates in drawing, painting, ceramics and theater. 
</P>
<P>
Performance artist Guillermo Gomez-Pena will speak at the Dia Center for the 
Arts in New York on Nov. 10 and 11 as part of a lecture series titled "The 
Politics of Images: Issues in the Presentation of Contemporary Art." The series 
begins in London at the Tate Gallery this weekend and concludes in New York 
next month. Gomez-Pena, a performance artist whose work addresses the 
bifurcated nature of life on the U.S.-Mexico border, will speak on "Alternative 
Curatorial Roles: Questions in Public and Private Sectors." LEAH OLLMAN

TAX BOARD DUEL FOUGHT WITH GADGETS

FRESNO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was high noon at the Big Fresno Fair and Brad Sherman was sidling up to 
prospective voters outside the Pronto Pup corn dog stand. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, I'm running for the State Board of Equalization," declared the balding 
36-year-old Granada Hills tax attorney and accountant. "And I'm handing out 
combs for two reasons: So you'll remember my name and on the theory that you 
can use one more than I can." 
</P>
<P>
Dean Kourafas, who had been sipping a beer, gladly accepted the blue notion. 
But the black-haired Fresno food marketer later acknowledged that he was more 
than slightly befuddled about what Sherman will be doing if he is elected to 
the five-member board next month. 
</P>
<P>
"Board of Equalization," pondered the young Fresno resident. "Isn't it 
something to do with raising food and providing programs for the needy?" 
</P>
<P>
Not quite. But not quite surprising either. 
</P>
<P>
In an era in which California politics seems synonymous with big money and mass 
media campaigning, the race for the nation's only elected tax appeals board is 
something of an anomaly. Here, the question of name recognition extends beyond 
the candidates to the government body itself. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people think it's some sort of a civil rights commission," says 
Republican Claude Parrish, who is running against Sherman to represent a 
3-million-voter district stretching from Santa Monica to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Change the name to the State Tax Commission, chimes in Sherman: "Then, people's 
ears might perk up." 
</P>
<P>
Of late, the obscure but powerful board -- which rules on personal and 
corporate tax appeals and oversees the collection and distribution of sales, 
gas and cigarette taxes -- has been receiving more attention than usual. That's 
because member Paul Carpenter was recently convicted of federal extortion 
charges stemming from his previous service as a state senator. 
</P>
<P>
However, little of the media focus has spilled over to the candidacies of 
Sherman and Parrish, who are vying for a seat being vacated by unsuccessful 
state Insurance Commissioner candidate Conway Collis. 
</P>
<P>
There is no question these lonely men of California politics want this 
$95,000-a-year job. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman is a Harvard Law School grad and political junkie. He lived in Orange 
County in the late 1960s and early 1970s, graduating from Corona del Mar High 
School and spending a year at Orange Coast College before moving on to UCLA and 
Harvard. He says he literally went for broke, selling the three condos he owned 
and moving into a $600-a-month apartment so he could loan his campaign almost 
$400,000 for the six-candidate Democratic primary. A good portion of the money 
went to pay for being included on influential election slate mailers in Los 
Angeles and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman figures that because the district is solidly Democratic his party 
affiliation alone gives him a nearly insurmountable advantage this fall. If 
elected, he expects to eventually see the loan repaid through future campaign 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
"And if I lose," he adds, "I'm a 36-year-old lawyer with no net worth. I won't 
be all that different from a lot of yuppie lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Parrish, a former barbershop owner from Canoga Park who has more 
recently worked as controller for a small securities firm, is combing the 
countryside seeking endorsements from county assessors. He also held a 
fund-raiser this week at the well-appointed Petroleum Club in downtown Los 
Angeles, featuring another politician known for his traveling, former Los 
Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty. 
</P>
<P>
With an outsize district and less than $20,000 cash on hand for each, the 
candidates say that full-scale advertising efforts in major metropolitan areas 
are both uneconomical and unfeasible. Moreover, they note, the board race draws 
virtually no big city TV or newspaper coverage. 
</P>
<P>
So, after covering such bases as ballot designation -- Sherman says his polls 
show the title "CPA" really helps -- the pair have little choice but to wage 
what is essentially a small-town campaign over an area the size of some states. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Sherman motored more than 1,000 miles through Watsonville, Paso 
Robles, Hanford and Santa Barbara, slowing down for interviews at weekly 
newspapers and radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
He was chauffeured by his secret weapon: his mother, Lane Sherman, whose 
consuming passion, along with the success of her children, is long-distance 
driving. Lane Sherman still lives in Newport Beach and her mother is a resident 
of Leisure World in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving in Fresno Thursday, mother and son set up shop outside the main 
entrances to the Big Fresno Fair, where up to 75,000 people passed daily. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to introduce you to my son, Brad," said Mrs. Sherman, as she 
energetically handed out brochures. "My son, he's a tax attorney and a CPA." 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a blue suit and suspenders in a sea of plaid and denim, it was hard to 
mistake Sherman for anything else. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the bookish candidate, who has represented California Common Cause in 
legislative hearings on tax issues, did exhibit a sense of humor. By handing 
out his combs and quips, he became the first statewide candidate in recent 
memory who has sought to use male pattern baldness to his advantage. 
</P>
<P>
At night, mother and son moved inside the fair to collar crowds streaming in 
for performances by Johnny Cash and Engelbert Humperdinck. Virtually the only 
large audience they passed up at the fair was the one at a Joan Jett rock 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
"The median voter in this state is 55 years old," explained Sherman, whose 
platform stresses professionalism and the elimination of big business tax 
loopholes. "I'm sure Joan Jett is a wonderful lady and deeply concerned about 
the political issues of our time. But the crowd she attracts does not represent 
high voter turnout." 
</P>
<P>
Parrish, meanwhile, has been reaching out to voters by appearing at any public 
forum that will have him. 
</P>
<P>
"I never turn any invitation down," confided Parrish, who has failed in 
previous runs for Congress, school board and the Board of Equalization. "I get 
a lot of invitations -- but to be honest, it's because the district is so 
large." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a senior citizens' political forum in Van Nuys last week, Parrish, 
43, promised that he would save taxpayers' money by employing "strict 
conservative accounting principles." 
</P>
<P>
Then he unveiled his answer to Sherman's combs: potholders. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish placed the kitchen mitts on a table next to stacks of brochures, bumper 
stickers, pens and posters. Within minutes, they had been scooped up, while 
most of the other candidates' election paraphernalia remained untouched. 
</P>
<P>
At 39 cents each, Parrish later explained to a reporter, they cost more than 
four times as much as Sherman's combs. "But combs you lose. A potholder lasts 
and lasts." 
</P>
<P>
The candidate concluded with a campaign pitch: "Who then is the more effective 
candidate at spending money? I think I am."

EARTHQUAKE: THE MODERATE TEMBLOR TRIGGERS EVACUATIONS, CAUSES SOME DAMAGE AND 
SHAKES UP RESIDENTS AND TOURISTS. THE EPICENTER WAS NEAR THE ORANGE COUNTY 
FAIRGROUNDS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A moderate earthquake gave Orange County a sharp kick Thursday, driving 
students and teachers from their classrooms, shattering windows, tossing 
ceramic artworks from shelves at a crafts festival, and generally spooking 
residents and tourists. 
</P>
<P>
The 10:21 a.m. quake, which measured a magnitude of 4.0, caused no injuries and 
only minor damage. The quake's epicenter was in the vicinity of the Orange 
County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa, according to seismologists at Caltech. Costa 
Mesa, Newport Beach and Santa Ana bore the brunt of the temblor's impact, 
though residents from South County to Long Beach reported feeling the jolt. 
</P>
<P>
"It hit like a solid punch," said John Farmer, chief of campus security at 
Orange Coast College, near the quake's epicenter. "The ground started to roll a 
little so you knew it was coming, then it was a big jolt and the building shook 
for a while." 
</P>
<P>
About 150 students and staff were evacuated from the four-story library at the 
college but were allowed to re-enter the building shortly after inspectors 
determined that the structure was not damaged. Two cracks, however, were 
discovered in other buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals said they had no reports of injuries, and police and fire officials 
said they received only a few calls from residents inquiring about the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials in Orange County said work crews were dispatched to check 
overpasses for cracks or other damage, but no problems were detected. Pacific 
Bell said telephone service was not interrupted by the quake, but a spokeswoman 
said there was a slight surge in usage, presumably as people rushed to call 
friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
The quake occurred on the Newport-Inglewood fault, Orange County's only major 
fault system. The last significant temblor to occur there was on April 7, 1989, 
when a 4.6 quake centered in Newport Beach caused widespread but minor damage. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Given, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Pasadena, said 
there are many faults within the Newport-Inglewood system. It is difficult to 
determine exactly which fault produces a temblor when it is of such a low 
magnitude, Givens said, calling this quake "a window rattler." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Thursday's quake rattled nerves of those who felt it, and set off 
car alarms in the parking lot of the County Courthouse in Santa Ana and 
elsewhere. Office workers and students in dozens of schools "ducked and 
covered" as the earth began to move. Out-of-town tourists were understandably 
upset. 
</P>
<P>
Dawn Holst of New York City was attending a computer-software conference at the 
Marriott Hotel in Fashion Island when she felt the earth move. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I thought it was a subway going underneath me, and then I realized I 
wasn't in New York," she said. "I thought, 'Oh, my God, it's an earthquake.' " 
</P>
<P>
Roy Marquez was washing windows at the Jeep-Eagle dealership in Costa Mesa when 
the quake shattered three large windows and cracked a fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just starting on the third one when it hit," said Marquez, 26. "I 
thought I had broke it. I thought maybe it was the soap I was using. I just 
ran." 
</P>
<P>
During the rocking and rolling, some storekeepers and shoppers at South Coast 
Plaza kept their eyes on a Rolls-Royce convertible precariously balanced on 
four china teacups -- part of an exhibit for a British cultural festival at the 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
The car did not budge. 
</P>
<P>
But artisans at a British crafts exhibit at the mall weren't so lucky. 
Expensive glassware, delicate ceramic works and pottery were knocked to the 
floor. Damage will probably go over several thousands of dollars, although an 
immediate estimate is not known, said Morris Latham, a spokesman for the crafts 
fair. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit is housed in a tent structure in the parking lot of the mall's 
Crystal Court annex. "It shook quite badly," Latham said of the tent. "Piles of 
things came down. There were ceramics and glass broken; some were quite 
valuable pieces." 
</P>
<P>
While not all schools in Orange County were evacuated, students at those 
closest to the epicenter initiated emergency procedures, many without prompting 
from teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"Today was very interesting because I had several teachers tell me that when 
the earthquake hit, the kids hit the floor like a shot," said Assistant 
Principal Carla Rush at Marina High School in Huntington Beach. "They knew 
exactly what to do. There was no fooling around." 
</P>
<P>
At the 13-story Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, employees said they felt a 
"bump," but the cathedral's massive glass panes withstood the shaking. 
</P>
<P>
"We just flew out of our chairs," said one employee. "Other than that, we're 
just fine. It's interesting when you are in a tower." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's quake occurred a day after the one-year anniversary of the 7.1 quake 
that caused 67 deaths and massive damage in the Bay Area. The grisly images 
from that disaster -- played repeatedly on television in recent days -- were 
fresh in the minds of some of those running for cover. 
</P>
<P>
"I just looked around and waited to see whether we should get under the table," 
said Huntington Beach resident Inez Cinocco, who was eating in a restaurant. 
"It was frightening, especially because on TV they kept showing the moments of 
silence from last year's (Bay Area) earthquake."

SHAKING UP THE COUNTY 
</P>
<P>
Here are some of the recent, notable earthquakes felt in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
July 8, 1986: A quake measuring 6.0 and centered near Palm Springs shakes 
people awake at 2:21 a.m. No major damage or injuries are reported in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 1, 1987: An earthquake registering 5.9, centered in Whittier, creates 
havoc throughout Southern California. In Orange County about $8 million in 
damage is caused. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 3, 1987: Orange County residents are awakened at 3:59 a.m. by an 
aftershock from the Oct. 1 earthquake. The aftershock registers 5.5 and causes 
extensive damage in the La Habra area. 
</P>
<P>
April 7, 1989: A sharp, jolting earthquake centered under Newport Beach shakes 
most of Orange and its surrounding counties, cracking buildings and closing 
schools. Five area residents suffer minor injuries during the quake, which 
measures 4.6. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 19, 1988: A moderate earthquake in the Pacific Ocean off Huntington Beach 
rumbles through Orange and Los Angeles counties. No damage or injuries are 
reported here. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 28, 1990: A moderate earthquake measuring 5.5, centered in the 
Upland-Pomona area, knocks bottles and cans from shelves locally and causes 
some minor damage to streets and sidewalks.

STATE INVESTIGATING ALLEGED EXTORTION BY LAOTIAN AGENCY;

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state attorney general's office confirmed Thursday it is investigating 
allegations that Laotian refugees in Southern California were shaken down for 
contributions to a Laos liberation group as a condition for receiving social 
services. 
</P>
<P>
After investigating extortion complaints from about 18 Hmong refugees in 
Riverside, San Bernardino and Orange Counties, the state Department of Social 
Services has also recommended terminating all state and county contracts with 
the social service agency, Lao Family Community Inc., said department 
spokeswoman Kathleen Norris. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence is there to support these allegations, and we are acting 
accordingly," Norris said Thursday. She said the department had been criticized 
for ignoring such allegations from refugees in the past and was now conducting 
a statewide probe. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. James D. Dutton said prosecutors are also conducting a 
separate criminal investigation into alleged embezzlement, extortion and other 
crimes by individuals who "may be connected or associated" with the political 
group, United Lao National Liberation Front, or with Lao Family Community. Both 
organizations have headquarters in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Front, also called Neo Hom, advocates the overthrow of the 
Communist government of Laos. It is headed by former Laotian Gen. Vang Pao, who 
once led a Hmong army in a Central Intelligence Agency-backed drive against the 
Pathet Lao. 
</P>
<P>
The Neo Hom had been all but forgotten until December, when it reportedly 
declared a "provisional revolutionary government" from the jungles of Laos and 
began waging insurgent attacks against the government. Pao, who lives in Garden 
Grove but travels extensively, is reported to be the military head of Neo Hom. 
</P>
<P>
Pao's son-in-law, Kao Thao, was formerly the director of Lao Family Community, 
a nonprofit agency with 10 branch offices in California and other states. 
</P>
<P>
Thao, 30, was fired from Lao Family in July for misappropriating funds. Last 
month he pleaded guilty to embezzling more than $70,000 from the agency and 
promised to repay the money. He is scheduled to be sentenced in November. 
</P>
<P>
Dutton said the embezzlement case is unrelated to the extortion probe. Thao's 
attorney, Bruce Bridgman, said he had no knowledge of any extortion probe. 
</P>
<P>
Lao Family acting director Gayle Morrison on Thursday denied that the social 
service agency and the Liberation Front are secretly linked. Morrison called 
the ongoing multiple investigations "a witch hunt." 
</P>
<P>
Morrison also said the evidence did not justify the recommendation by the DSS' 
Civil Rights Bureau that all state contracts with Lao Family be terminated. 
</P>
<P>
"We're bending over backwards to help them (investigate), and we will do 
anything to do so," Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Lao Family has a $356,000 state contract to run a refugee 
child development program in Huntington Beach. It has lost contracts for job 
training and other services, however, and has been cited by the Internal 
Revenue Service for nonpayment of payroll taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Alicia Martinez, who conducted the investigation for the Civil Rights Bureau, 
said about 18 refugees in Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties have 
alleged they were asked for contributions to the Liberation Front after they 
were referred to Lao Family Community for welfare screening or job training. 
</P>
<P>
Fearful that they would not receive help otherwise, some refugees contributed 
from $60 to $100 a month from their welfare checks to the cause, Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Martinez said, refugees were sold certificates that would 
guarantee them jobs as government officials in a newly liberated Laos, paying 
between $1,000 and $5,000 for the documents. 
</P>
<P>
"They were being told that if they wanted to get into Laos when Vang Pao took 
over again, that they would have to have these certificates if they wanted to 
be a policeman or a judge or some official," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Sources in Orange County said the sale of such certificates has been common 
knowledge in the Laotian refugee community for years. Many people supported the 
cause and donated freely, but others were pressured, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very sad case," the source said. "They have been telling people that if 
you don't belong to the organization, you can't go back when they liberate the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
According to Martinez, some refugees in San Bernardino said they were afraid to 
go to Lao Family for welfare screening because they had been forced to 
contribute to the Liberation Front while in Thai refugee camps, or had been 
approached by the group in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said Thao had shared an office with Liberation Front officials a few 
doors down from the Lao Family headquarters in Garden Grove. During a search of 
the office by the attorney general's investigators, she said, one of Thao's 
filing cabinets was found to contain Lao Family case files and budgets in the 
same drawer as files marked with the Neo Hom logo. 
</P>
<P>
Though some of the material was in Hmong, Martinez said, "there were lists of 
names of people who were contributing to Neo Hom." She would not comment on 
whether the donors' names matched those on the case files. 
</P>
<P>
However, Morrison said, the filing cabinet belonged to the Neo Hom officials 
who shared the office, and not to Thao. She said the state report was 
inaccurate and misleading, and an internal probe has turned up no corroborating 
evidence.

NEWPORT-INGLEWOOD FAULT AMONG MOST HAZARDOUS IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Newport-Inglewood fault isn't nearly as famous as the mighty San Andreas, 
but it poses such a severe threat to the Southern California coast that even a 
mild quake sends shivers up the spines of emergency officials. 
</P>
<P>
The fault cuts a subterranean path from Beverly Hills to Newport Beach -- 
directly underneath a densely populated coastline that sits precariously on 
sandy soils vulnerable to motion. South of Newport Beach the fault veers 
offshore. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1988 state report, geologists warned that a major quake on the 
Newport-Inglewood fault "poses one of the greatest hazards to lives and 
property in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
"Events like today's raise our level of consciousness," said Fausto Reyes, 
manager of the Orange County Fire Department's emergency management division. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's jolt, which had a magnitude of 4.0, occurred within the 
Newport-Inglewood fault system, but not on the fault itself, said Douglas 
Given, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Pasadena. The zone is 
a broad, vaguely defined area around the fault, encompassing the areas of Seal 
Beach, Huntington Beach, Costa Mesa and Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"There are lots of faults in that area, and it could have been on any of them," 
Given said. "We don't know if it physically intersects the Newport-Inglewood 
fault." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's quake was just a blip on a seismologist's screen, not even big 
enough to provide geophysicists with enough evidence to determine the specific 
fault responsible. In fact, they aren't sent out in the field unless the quake 
measures at least a 5.0. 
</P>
<P>
"In the absence of a ruptured surface, it's very difficult to isolate a fault, 
and there wouldn't be any surface ruptures in a quake of this magnitude," Given 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A moderate quake on the Newport-Inglewood could cause as much damage as a 
larger one on the San Andreas, largely because of the coast's dense population 
and loose soil. Coastal areas are prone to liquefaction, a process in which the 
soil turns mushy from the extreme vibration. The San Andreas, which cuts 
through the central part of the state, is buried in more solid ground. 
</P>
<P>
Experts predict the Newport-Inglewood fault could someday trigger a 6.5 quake 
that would kill thousands of people and cause millions of dollars in damage 
along the coast of Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport-Inglewood is most famous for the 1933 Long Beach quake, a 6.3 
shaker that killed more than 100 people and caused about $40 million in damage, 
equivalent to about $400 million today. 
</P>
<P>
The fault's most recent significant temblor was April 7, 1989, a 4.6 centered 
in Newport Beach, three miles from Thursday's epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
Experts know from the movement of Thursday's quake that it wasn't directly on 
the Newport-Inglewood fault. It had a north-south orientation, and one block in 
the earth's crust moved down relative to another block. Quakes on the 
Newport-Inglewood fault have a northwest-southeast trend and are strike-slip, 
which means the blocks move laterally. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like today's is not related to the April 7, 1989, event. It's close, 
within three miles, but the mechanism is different," Given said. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport-Inglewood fault hasn't been scrutinized as much as the famous San 
Andreas. Little is known about its southern reaches, since it cuts offshore 
south of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite a bit is known about the Newport-Inglewood fault, especially to the 
northwest, where it's on land. But in Orange County, it's mostly offshore and 
it's hard to study," said Kate Hutton, senior seismologist at Caltech in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Tale of Two Quakes 
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of Thursday's quake was about 3 miles north of the center of a 
4.6-magnitude quake that hit Newport Beach on April 7, 1989. Both were in the 
Newport-Inglewood fault zone. The fault is especially worrisome to emergency 
officials because it runs through densely populated areas on sandy, vulnerable 
soils. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday quake: 4.0 at OC Fair grounds. 
</P>
<P>
April 7, 1989: 4.6 near intersection of Cliff Drive and Tustin Avenue in 
Newport.

TEMBLOR PUTS SCHOOL TO THE TEST;

EMERGENCY: NEWPORT BEACH PUPILS SCORE HIGH BY QUICKLY DUCKING LOW UNDER THEIR 
DESKS, AS MOTHER NATURE SPRINGS A SURPRISE QUIZ IN GEOLOGY.

<P>
The faculty of Mariners Elementary School repeatedly drills its students with 
lessons in how to cope with the often unpredictable actions of Mother Nature. 
On Thursday, Mother Nature decided it was time for a pop quiz. 
</P>
<P>
What do you do when the earth shakes, rattles and rolls? The students' answer: 
You duck, cover and hold. 
</P>
<P>
The answer was correct. 
</P>
<P>
And what do you do when the earth stops shaking? The students' answer: Break 
out the emergency buckets, walk outside in an orderly fashion, sit in the grass 
and drink water from an emergency supply until further notice. 
</P>
<P>
Another correct response. 
</P>
<P>
Like all other schools in Orange County, Mariners Elementary is required to 
have students perform periodic earthquake drills to give them a taste of what 
conditions might be like after a major quake. And while Thursday's 4.0 quake 
was not exactly The Big One, it tested whether the students had been paying 
attention during drills. 
</P>
<P>
The result: They passed with flying colors. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Slaughter, the school's faculty representative for emergency 
preparedness, said extensive earthquake preparation plans were put into effect 
immediately after the quake hit at 10:21 a.m. Although there was no damage to 
the school, she said the temblor provided another lesson to students on why the 
frequent "duck-and-cover" drills are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we go through a drill, we go through the same thing," Slaughter 
said. "We just had a drill a week or two ago. Everybody obviously knew what to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
When the earthquake struck, the school's 620 students immediately ducked 
beneath their desks, covered their heads and held their positions, Slaughter 
said. The quake lasted only seconds, but, just as in earthquake drills, the 
students stayed beneath their desks until they finished counting to 100. 
</P>
<P>
The "duck-and-cover" drill yielded the school's only earthquake-related injury 
of the day. 
</P>
<P>
"One kid bumped his head (on his desk)," Slaughter said. "We put an ice pack on 
it. I don't know whether he was trying to get under the desk or if he bumped 
his head when he was coming out." 
</P>
<P>
The school was prepared for far more than just a minor knock on the head, 
however. Slaughter said that as soon as the earthquake ended, teachers broke 
out notebooks containing outlines of post-quake procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Following drill procedures to the letter, the school activated its first aid, 
search-and-rescue and student relief teams. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers led the students out into Mariner Park, part of which serves as a 
large playground for the school. Some students were assigned to bring out the 
two "emergency buckets" stored in each classroom. Slaughter said one bucket 
holds a first-aid kit, the class roll, name tags and a radio, while the other 
contains tissue, crayons, books "and whatever else the teacher might need when 
outside." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Slaughter and school principal Bruce Crockard manned the school's 
Emergency Operating Center -- which holds water and more emergency supplies -- 
to make sure all was well. 
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of the chance to run an impromptu drill, the school went so 
far as to set up a "sanitation area" with portable toilets and a Red Cross area 
for potential injuries. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries to treat, however, other than the kid who bumped his 
head, Slaughter said. A sweep of the school revealed no damage.

NEWPORT DOCTOR WHO FLED COUNTY ARRESTED IN TEXAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Newport Beach psychiatrist who failed to appear for his sentencing after 
pleading guilty to sexually molesting a 29-year-old male patient was arrested 
Thursday in Laredo, Tex., the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. James Harrington White, 47, was arrested at the Laredo border checkpoint as 
he entered the country with a 16-year-old boy, FBI spokesman Wylie B. Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have not determined the boy's relationship with White, who fled 
Orange County before being sentenced Aug. 29 on two counts of sexual 
molestation. 
</P>
<P>
White, who was highly successful and had homes in Newport Beach, Palm Desert 
and Mammoth Lakes, was accused of drugging a male patient who had moved into 
his home and performing a sex act while videotaping it. 
</P>
<P>
White was being held in the Webb County Law Enforcement Center and is scheduled 
to appear before a U.S. magistrate. Before he fled, White faced a maximum 
sentence of 10 years.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
CITY HOUSING PLAN IS UPHELD BY COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNON SANDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court commissioner has decided that the revised version of the 
city's housing plan is valid, disappointing an environmental group that had 
attacked the plan as vague and unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
In a four-page decision, Commissioner Ronald L. Bauer wrote that Seal Beach's 
plan "may or may not be the best possible housing element, with the best 
possible plans for the implementation of desired goals." 
</P>
<P>
But, he continued, "a decision about what is the 'best' way for Seal Beach to 
achieve these goals is uniquely political, to be resolved in the local elective 
and legislative processes." 
</P>
<P>
Lee Whittenberg, Seal Beach's director of development services, said he was 
happy to learn of Bauer's ruling. "It was nice, after all the work, to see it 
was done properly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Wetlands Restoration Society sued Seal Beach over its housing plan earlier 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathon Lehrer-Graiwer, the group's lawyer, argued that the housing plan's 
objectives for new low-cost housing and rental assistance are unrealistic and 
unattainable. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was part of the society's strategy for blocking a controversial, 
329-home project on the Hellman Ranch property. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent version of the housing element was approved by the City Council 
after Bauer ordered the city to update it. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer had thrown out the council's previous approval of Mola Development 
Corp.'s plans for Hellman Ranch because the plan was invalid when the permits 
were issued. 
</P>
<P>
Mola appealed that decision, but a new council has since rejected the project. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Oderman, an attorney for Mola, said Bauer's ruling last week will help 
support the company's appeal, for which no court date has yet been set. 
</P>
<P>
"Mola spent 4 1/2 years processing its project before the city of Seal Beach, 
and at the time it got approved, there wasn't any ruling invalidating the 
housing element," Oderman said. "Since that defect has been fixed, this ruling 
will support that." 
</P>
<P>
Galen Ambrose, president of the Wetlands Restoration Society, said he does not 
see Bauer's ruling as a setback because the original opinion overturning the 
project's approval still stands and the new council and housing committee are 
receptive to the society's goals. SHANNON SANDS

<P>
The City Council has rejected a proposed tax increase on the city's dwindling 
oil production because of uncertainties about the Persian Gulf crisis and the 
U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
In a unanimous vote Tuesday, the council defeated the 25% hike after oil 
producers argued that recent price increases only compensate for a five-year 
business slump. 
</P>
<P>
Tax increases, the producers said, could force independent companies out of 
business because of a relatively low financial return from the city's 399 
wells. 
</P>
<P>
Oil companies also feared that the proposed 25% hike would set off a chain 
reaction leading to similar increases elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Under the defeated proposal, the annual tax-per-well would have risen from $350 
to $437.50 and the tax-per-barrel rate would have gone from 12 cents to 16 
cents. Taxes on gas production would have risen from 1 cent to 1.25 cents per 
cubic foot. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the tax increase would add $70,500 to city coffers each 
year and was an attempt to make up for declining revenues from oil over the 
past five years. Oil-per-barrel income fell in the city from $175,421 in 
1985-86 to $130,405 in 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
Only recently, with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, have prices rebounded, oil 
producers say. Oil in Placentia and Yorba Linda now averages about $30 per 
barrel, according to Ed Malmgreen, manager of environmental affairs and 
taxation for the California Independent Petroleum Assn. But he added that, over 
the past five years, the price per barrel averaged only $13.54. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Malmgreen predicted that the price will soon fall, just as independent 
producers are taking their higher revenues to pay off debts and repair aging 
wells. TED JOHNSON

CURBSIDE RECYCLING GAINS COUNCIL OK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council this week approved a plan to have citywide, curbside recycling 
by next spring. 
</P>
<P>
Under a proposal by city staff and Yorba Linda Disposal, residents would be 
given a 110-gallon green bin for glass, paper, aluminum and plastic 
recyclables, to be collected biweekly, city officials said. The materials would 
be taken to a central location.

STUDENTS GET TRIAL RUN AT PARENTHOOD 
</P>

Mike Hendricks and Kim Zehner waited nervously in the lobby of South Coast 
Medical Center for space to be cleared in the hospital's maternity ward. Zehner 
fiddled with a baby blanket and pajamas while Hendricks calmed her with 
soothing words. 
</P>
<P>
"I got these (clothes) off my doll," said Zehner, a high school junior. "Yeah, 
we want to keep the baby warm," added Hendricks before donning a flannel robe 
and accompanying Zehner down the long hallway to the maternity ward. 
</P>
<P>
Just 45 minutes later, Zehner was wheeled out of the hospital with 5-pound 
identical twins, one on each arm -- 5-pound sacks of flour, that is. 
</P>
<P>
The medical center distributed the flour sacks to 23 Laguna Beach high school 
students as part of a weeklong project to teach teen-agers the realities of 
parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
The students, who are part of a decision-making class called Choices and 
Challenges, must keep their "flour babies" with them at all times and simulate 
the daily chores of parenting: changing diapers, buying supplies, finding child 
care and, of course, feeding. 
</P>
<P>
"I want you to go home tonight and set your alarm for every two hours, because 
that's when your baby will require feeding," Kathy Higgs, a hospital staff 
member who leads real parents in prenatal exercises and parenting classes, told 
the students. "I also would like you to be up at 5 a.m. to start your day 
tomorrow morning." 
</P>
<P>
Higgs orchestrated Wednesday's "birth" along with Laguna Beach High School 
teacher Art Smart and the Laguna Beach Chamber of Commerce. Tuesday, Higgs came 
to the students' classroom wearing a borrowed maternity gown and gave students 
a first-person account of her pregnancy, as well as sample breathing exercises 
and other prenatal training. On the day of the delivery, students toured the 
maternity ward, viewing the obstetrics lab and the nursery where newborns are 
kept for observation. 
</P>
<P>
While most high schools have similar parenting classes that involve eggs or 
other fragile objects, Smart said he decided to use the heavy sacks of flour to 
make a point about parenthood: It's not all fun. 
</P>
<P>
"Five pounds becomes cumbersome, especially for students who have cheerleading 
or track practice. It's exciting now, but after the honeymoon wears off, then 
reality sets in," Smart said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to carrying their offspring at all times on school grounds, 
students will also be required to research the cost of food, clothing, medical 
attention and child care, Smart said. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual project elicited jokes and giggles from the class of seniors and 
juniors, but most students said that carrying the sacks of flour for the next 
week will be a valuable exercise. 
</P>
<P>
"If I really had a kid, I'd probably have to drop out of school," said 
16-year-old Tom Wilkerson. "My parents wouldn't like that too much." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little strange," added Gordana Jurilj, an exchange student from 
Yugoslavia. "I think it's really good having these classes." CHERYLANNE BEALER

TRUSTEES QUESTION USE OF SCHOOL FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The two incumbents in the Tustin Unified School District race said they were 
surprised to learn how the district has spent some of the money from the sale 
of closed school sites. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbents Gloria Tuchman and Jane Bauer said they believed the district could 
use the funds only for refurbishing schools. 
</P>
<P>
But former superintendent and school board candidate Maurice Ross told the 
audience at a candidates' forum that some of the $12 million generated by the 
school site sales was used to buy computers. 
</P>
<P>
"My concern was not that we did it," Bauer said. "Because if it was spent, it 
was for something we needed. What I'm concerned about is that the expenditure 
was made without the board being told about it." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Fisher, business manager for the district, said $50,000 to $60,000 of the 
school sale fund was spent on computers last year. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, who resigned as superintendent last year after citing philosophical 
differences with school board members, said the board was told how the money 
was spent. 
</P>
<P>
"That's ridiculous. They have to vote on everything. The computers were Jane 
(Bauer)'s pet project. I don't see how in the world she wouldn't know," said 
Ross, who criticized the computer purchases because the district had pledged to 
spend the funds on refurbishing schools. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer said she asked questions but was never told the money was being spent on 
computers. "That was typical of the way Dr. Ross worked," she said. "Board 
members were not informed about what was going on, even when they asked 
questions." SHANNON SANDS

SUSPECT IS SOUGHT IN SHOOTINGS OF 3 MEN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Police were searching Thursday for a man suspected of shooting and wounding 
three men as they stood in front of an apartment complex at 1600 W. 1st St. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting, at about 7 p.m. Wednesday, was apparently unprovoked, police 
spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
"The three victims were waiting for friends outside of the complex, and the 
suspect had been drinking beer a short distance away," Thomas said. "The 
suspect walked over to the group and words were exchanged before the man pulled 
out a small-caliber handgun and fired three to five shots, striking all three 
of the people in the group." 
</P>
<P>
The victims, whose names were not available, were taken to Western Medical 
Center, where they were treated for wounds described by Thomas as "not 
life-threatening." 
</P>
<P>
"One person was hit in the elbow by gunfire, one was hit in the upper arm and 
one was hit in the hand and the leg. That person's leg was actually broken by 
the bullet," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
One man was released Wednesday night. The other victims remained at Western 
Medical Center, where they were listed in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
The assailant, described as a Latino in his 30s, ran to the rear of the 
apartment complex immediately after the shootings and drove away in a white or 
red pickup. GREG HERNANDEZ

<P>
Businessman John J. Collins has spent almost $2,800 in his campaign for the 
City Council, more than twice the amount of the total campaign budgets of two 
other candidates, according to his campaign financial statement. 
</P>
<P>
Collins' biggest payment -- $2,200 -- went to American Union Printing for 
flyers. He has raised $4,900 for his campaign to fill one of three seats after 
two failed attempts in 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates Marvin P. Adler and Guy Carozzo do not plan to spend more than 
$1,000 on their entire campaigns, according to their financial reports. 
</P>
<P>
A major part of Carozzo's election pledge is that he will pay for his campaign 
out of his retirement fund and won't accept campaign contributions. ROSE

10 CANDIDATES SHARPLY DEFINE DIFFERENCES IN 2 TV DEBATES

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Candidates for five Orange County seats in the state Assembly met Thursday in 
two debates that offered voters some clear distinctions between opponents but 
little time to explore their views in any depth. 
</P>
<P>
The half-hour debates were taped in the studios of KOCE-TV Channel 50 at Golden 
West College and were moderated by Jim Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
The first debate, which will air Oct. 29 at 6:30 p.m., featured 58th Assembly 
District candidates Luanne Pryor, a Long Beach public relations executive and 
Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays, and 71st District hopefuls Peter 
Mathews, a Cypress College professor, and incumbent Assemblywoman Doris Allen 
(R-Cypress). 
</P>
<P>
Mays, a Republican, and Pryor, a Democrat, are vying for the seat vacated by 
outgoing Assemblyman Dennis Brown. They traded charges that each is susceptible 
to influence from developers who have contributed to their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Pryor said Mays was in the pocket of the Huntington Beach Co., the largest 
landowner in that city, while Mays pointed out that Pryor took contributions 
from David Malmuth, a major Long Beach developer. 
</P>
<P>
Mathews, meanwhile, said that legislators are influenced by private special 
interests and that voters should reject incumbents and "return responsibility 
to the Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
Allen agreed that the Legislature is not functioning properly but blamed it on 
a Democrat-dominated power structure that is forcing citizens to legislate by 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about two initiatives on the ballot that would limit legislator's 
terms, Mays, Allen and Mathews all said they would support some form of term 
limits, with Mathews also supporting public financing of campaigns. Pryor said 
she sees limiting terms as being detrimental to women candidates, who are 
already underrepresented in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
In the second debate, which will air Oct. 30 at 6:30 p.m., candidates in the 
67th, 69th and 70th districts squared off. 
</P>
<P>
All three are heavily Republican districts, and the Democrat challengers are 
decided underdogs. 
</P>
<P>
In the 67th District, Chapman College Prof. Fred Smoller got into a short but 
heated argument with incumbent John R. Lewis (R-Orange) when Smoller blasted 
Lewis for his since-dismissed indictment on political forgery charges. 
</P>
<P>
"That alone is enough for him to forgo reelection," Smoller said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis countered by saying that the charges were trumped up by Atty. Gen. John 
Van de Kamp and other powerful Democrats and were "laughed out of court." He 
characterized Smoller as being "on the most extreme left-wing fringes of the 
Democratic Party." 
</P>
<P>
When Smoller said "that's ridiculous," Lewis asked him why, then, was he 
arrested for trespassing on government property to protest nuclear testing? 
</P>
<P>
Smoller said that Lewis was wrong, that he was "detained" and not arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Democratic candidate in the 69th District, business attorney 
James Toledano, attacked his opponent, Assemblyman Nolan Frizzelle 
(R-Huntington Beach) for refusing to debate him one-on-one during the campaign. 
"He's trying to conceal his record," said Toledano. 
</P>
<P>
Frizzelle did not directly answer the charge. Instead, he used his time to 
remind voters that he is a fiscal conservative who is concerned about keeping 
taxes low and restricting government growth. He said he opposes Measure M, the 
county's proposed sales tax increase for transportation improvements but 
supports construction of additional toll roads. 
</P>
<P>
Toledano said he, too, opposes Measure M, but because it is "a Band-Aid and 
Scotch tape" approach to problems that need a more comprehensive solution. 
</P>
<P>
In the 70th District, Democrat Howard Adler said the Republican incumbents 
"can't get the job done" and have failed to provide the county with any 
political leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"The voters believe all you guys are crooks," Adler said. 
</P>
<P>
Gil Ferguson answered that the Democrats in power in Sacramento for the past 37 
years are the crooks who have been "sucking this state blind." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to leave there myself if I can take all those crooks down with me," 
said Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), proclaiming his support for Prop. 140, the 
strictest of the term-limitation initiatives.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
THE BADGE OF GOOD POLICE WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police departments all across the country are facing enormous pressures to 
combat increased crime and drug-related violence in times of dwindling 
resources and budgets. Yet a recent California Department of Justice report 
found that two Orange County police departments were state leaders last year in 
solving serious crimes, despite the increasingly difficult climate for law 
enforcement. Santa Ana and Anaheim deserve a "well done" for their effective 
detective work. 
</P>
<P>
As these and other police departments have struggled to do more with less, 
their caseloads have increased because of growing populations and more gangs, 
drugs and related crime. 
</P>
<P>
The same report found, for example, that the Long Beach Police Department, once 
considered one of the best-run departments in the country, had deteriorated in 
performance to the point where in 1989 it had the worst record of any major 
city in California for solving serious and violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach is a case study in what happens when a department is beset with 
internal labor strife, including accusations by the chief that officers have 
been involved in the use and sale of narcotics, an increase in violent crime, 
and an influx of drugs. But Santa Ana and Anaheim, which have had their share 
of urban problems to deal with, have managed to turn in laudatory performances, 
despite the obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, for example, police solved 81% of reported rape cases, which was 
nearly 30% better than police agencies on the average in the state's other 10 
largest cities. And in Anaheim, police made arrests in 71% of rape cases and 
lead all other major cities in cracking assault cases, solving four of five, 
which was 20% more than the average. 
</P>
<P>
Still, these successful departments have had to set priorities because of the 
caseload, and the deterioration evident in Long Beach serves as a cautionary 
tale. A good report on police work is a badge that, to paraphrase the old 
airline commercial, has to be earned every day.

<P>
Southern Section administrators ruled Thursday that Mission Viejo High School 
running back Marcellus Chrishon is eligible to continue playing football after 
school officials presented evidence that they said showed his mother is living 
within the school's attendance area. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling was made following a meeting between Southern Section administrators 
Dean Crowley and Bill Clark; Robert Metz, Mission Viejo principal, and 
representatives of the Saddleback Valley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Chrishon's eligibility was questioned because section officials said they had 
failed to receive a transfer-eligibility request or hardship appeal when he 
transferred from Temecula Valley in July. 
</P>
<P>
Chrishon was ineligible to play football last fall at Temecula Valley, where he 
lived with his aunt after moving from Phoenix. He later competed on the track 
team there when his mother, Rose Davis, moved to the Temecula area. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime after the track season, Chrishon's mother granted legal guardianship 
of her son to Luis and Nelida Amposta, longtime friends of the family. Crowley 
had said Wednesday that no records of the change of guardianship had been filed 
with his office and added, "As far as we know, the mother is still living in 
Temecula." 
</P>
<P>
Southern Section and school officials declined to discuss details involving 
Thursday's meeting and released a statement that read: "The CIF Southern 
Section office met and reviewed the material presented by the Mission Viejo 
High School principal (Bob Metz) and assistant principal (Morris Hawkins). 
</P>
<P>
"From the information presented, it was determined by the Southern Section 
office that the athlete (Chrishon) is eligible under the provisions of the 
CIF-SS rules and regulations." 
</P>
<P>
Stan Ford, boys' athletic director at Temecula Valley, said he never received 
forms regarding Chrishon's transfer from Temecula Valley to Mission Viejo or a 
change in guardianship. 
</P>
<P>
A Southern Section official confirmed again Thursday that no records of 
Chrishon's transfer or a request for hardship eligibility is on file at the 
section office. 
</P>
<P>
School and section officials were instructed not to comment about the absence 
of both forms or how that affected Chrishon's eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, an unemployed nurse, said she is living with the Amposta family along 
with her husband, Chrishon's stepfather, Charles Rivers. 
</P>
<P>
When contacted Thursday, Davis said, "I was living in the Mission Viejo area 
before the Ampostas moved here. All this is a bunch of bull." 
</P>
<P>
Rivers said school officials met with his wife and Luis and Nelida Amposta on 
Thursday morning before conferring with Southern Section officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a big meeting at the house and got everything straightened out," Rivers 
said. "The CIF has all the facts. Anything else that you need to know, you'll 
have to get from our attorney." 
</P>
<P>
Rivers referred further questions to Hiram deFries, offensive back coach at 
Mission Viejo and the family's legal consultant. He was not available for 
comment Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
When interviewed Tuesday for a feature story, Chrishon talked about the 
transition of moving into the Amposta's Mission Viejo home and referred to 
Nelida as "my second mother." 
</P>
<P>
"It's great living with the Amposta family," Chrishon said. "They treat me just 
like one of their own kids. Mrs. Amposta is just like my mother." 
</P>
<P>
Chrishon was pictured with the Amposta family in a featured "Senior Families of 
the Week" in Mission Viejo's game program last Saturday. Davis, Chrishon's 
mother, is not in the photograph. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills Coach Don Douglass said the incident has become commonplace in high 
school sports. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sign of the times," Douglass said. "Parents are shopping around for the 
best school for their kids, and a situation like this comes up." 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo, the sixth-ranked team in the Orange County Sportswriters' Assn. 
high school football poll with a 5-1 record, meets host Dana Hills (3-2-1) at 
7:30 tonight in South Coast League play. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Johnson, coach at rival El Toro High School, was disappointed when he 
learned that Chrishon had been ruled eligible. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a joke," Johnson said. "It's a mockery of high school football. Three 
different guardians in the last three years. . . . It just makes a joke out of 
high school football."

ANAHEIM STICKS TO GROUND IN GUNNING DOWN WESTERN

<P>
Senior Robert Jones rushed for a season-high 229 yards in 23 carries to lead 
Anaheim High School to a 17-0 victory over Western in an Orange League game 
Thursday at Western High. 
</P>
<P>
Jones was the front man in an Anaheim ground game that piled up 344 yards and 
two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim's first score was all Jones and the offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
Gil Brito's 39-yard punt pinned Anaheim on its five-yard line with about seven 
minutes left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
On the first play, Jones broke a dive play for 23 yards. He followed that by 
dashing through a sizable hole, cutting into the open toward the left sidelines 
and finishing off a 72-yard scoring run. 
</P>
<P>
Jones had 148 yards rushing in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"We might have come of age as a football team tonight," Anaheim Coach Raul 
Victores said. "We eliminated the mental mistakes that have hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim only called five pass plays -- two resulted in sacks, two were 
incomplete and the other was a screen pass that went for 12 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim (3-4, 1-1 in league play) scored 10 points in the third quarter to put 
the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
Julio Langarcia kicked a 22-yard field goal midway through the third to give 
Anaheim a 10-0 lead. The kick capped a 12-play, 80-yard drive that took nearly 
seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The final touchdown came on a seven-yard blast by Brian Diaz with 1 minute 50 
seconds left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The score was set up when James Parson, a 6-foot-3 defensive end, reached high 
to intercept a screen pass from Pioneer quarterback Brito at the Western 24. 
</P>
<P>
Western's offense struggled, totaling only 127 yards. Brito, who also plays 
tailback, was four of 22 for 34 yards with two interceptions. In Brito's 
defense, Western receivers dropped five very catchable passes.

BODYBUILDING: OTIS ALBERT, A BLIND BODYBUILDER WHO IS ALSO A MUSICIAN, WILL TRY 
TO ADD TO HIS COLLECTION OF TROPHIES DURING COMPETITION SATURDAY AT WEST 
TORRANCE HIGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When the bodybuilders go on stage Saturday at West Torrance High, several will 
make unusual entrances. 
</P>
<P>
Some will be in wheelchairs. Some will be pushing retirement age. 
</P>
<P>
And one of the area's best novice bodybuilders will be led to the podium by his 
trainer's wife. Otis Albert, 26, has been an up-and-comer in the sport since he 
began competing 2 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In a competition where, the saying goes, the two most important tools are the 
barbell and the mirror, that's no mean feat. Albert has been blind his whole 
life. He's never seen his massive biceps or rippling pectorals. 
</P>
<P>
If lack of sight has made bodybuilding more difficult for Albert, it hasn't 
stood in his way. He'll be trying to add to his collection of trophies in 
Saturday's second annual World Cup of Natural Bodybuilding. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does Albert compete in the sport; his enthusiasm has made him a 
favorite of Pete Samra, a former Mr. USA who is the main mover in the drug-free 
bodybuilding scene. 
</P>
<P>
Samra helped Albert get into competing in 1988, showing him how to pose, 
providing counsel and nutritional aids. Now Albert is part of Samra's anti-drug 
team that addresses schools and youth groups. 
</P>
<P>
"He speaks, he poses," Samra said. "People see guys like Otis, or bodybuilders 
in wheelchairs. The message is no matter what you do in life, no matter what 
your handicap, you don't need drugs or steroids." 
</P>
<P>
Albert, who has been on his own since he was 19, supporting himself mainly as a 
musician and on Social Security, leans on the fellowship of his group of 
comrades who call themselves the Barbells for psychological strength. 
</P>
<P>
Former Narbonne High buddy Elizardo Delrio, who went blind with retinitis 
pigmentosa in the early 1980s, has become his trainer and mentor. Delrio's wife 
Nancy helps with posing, does the cooking and provides moral support. Albert 
moved in with the Delrios in 1988. They train in their Hawthorne apartment. 
</P>
<P>
A more recent addition to the Barbells is Bobby Smith, 22, also blind. Smith is 
shaping up as a competitive bodybuilder as well. "I hope to have Bobby 
competing by next April," Delrio, 27, said. 
</P>
<P>
When they're not training, the three also form an impressive a cappella group, 
performing old rock songs and Spanish standards. 
</P>
<P>
Sighted friends Glen Kapuy and John Vasquez round out the group, acting as 
bodyguards, spotting the barbells and weights during workouts and providing 
whatever useful services they can. 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is we've got that closeness," Delrio said. "Some ways 
we're closer than blood brothers. We all have different roles. There's never an 
ego trip. I'm the spokesman. Otis is the competitor, Bobby's our spiritual 
leader. And my wife is the most important part -- she looks after the three of 
us. We thank the Lord every day." 
</P>
<P>
It was Delrio who talked Albert into training two years ago. At the time, he 
said, Albert was a "sickly looking" guy with insomnia and a bad appetite. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd been telling him to work out since high school," Delrio said. "I told him, 
'You got a good physique.' We had to force feed him. Now you better make us 
famous, the way you eat." 
</P>
<P>
Albert grinned in agreement. "I was active (as a teen-ager) but it was more 
like running, not so much sports. I had got out of that for a while. Thank 
goodness my trainer kept on me." 
</P>
<P>
The 175-pound Albert progressed, and one day Delrio's wife saw an ad for a 
bodybuilding competition. 
</P>
<P>
"We told him to compete for the heck of it," Delrio said. 
</P>
<P>
At last year's World Cup, Albert came to the attention of Samra, who was 
intrigued. "I started training him to pose," Samra said. "He placed, and he's 
been in a couple more (contests) since. 
</P>
<P>
"I had never been involved with handicapped people when Otis came along. At 
first I didn't know how to deal with it. Teaching Otis to pose was very 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"First I had to teach him where to put his feet so he'd always know where the 
front of the stage was. He came in once a week. At first he was very rough. He 
was so clumsy, so stiff. After the first time I was saying to myself, 'How am I 
ever going to get through to him?' But the second week he had about mastered 
it. He overcame that barrier. It was a major achievement. He learned quick he 
has so much more potential and ability. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a visual sport. I would have to do the pose, flex and let him feel me or 
move his arms around so he could feel it himself. To me it was phenomenal. He's 
been very inspirational to me. A TV (cable) company showed our World Cup last 
year and they said if you hadn't seen him led on stage you didn't know he was 
blind." 
</P>
<P>
That, more than anything else, seems to be what pleases Albert, who is 
concentrating on developing his abdomen and legs to the competition level his 
chest and arms are. He competes at about 175 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got great potential," Samra said. "He's got good genetics, size, 
proportion, personality." 
</P>
<P>
Said Albert: "I love the challenge, I love the occasion. I just want to try to 
get better and better, maybe that'll open up other doors -- commercials and 
appearances. I want to be able to touch a lot of other people, especially other 
blind people. I want to break the stereotype, break the label that all we can 
do is stuff like music." 
</P>
<P>
That, too, is Delrio's point. 
</P>
<P>
"I got the idea to start training people after I lost my vision," said Delrio, 
who sets up individual programs for each bodybuilder and continues to modify 
Albert's training. "It was a self-esteem thing. More than looking good -- you 
feel good about yourself, you start getting compliments. It's something 
different to be blind and take care of yourself. Bodybuilding has opened up 
doors. It's been the key to a lot of things. Our lifelong dream is to have our 
own gym." 
</P>
<P>
The Barbells are also trying to make a mark in show business. Albert has been a 
drummer since boyhood and they've "fooled around" with a cappella singing since 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
Through HAPPI -- Handicapped Artists, Performers and Partners Inc., a talent 
agency that exclusively represents disabled performers -- they have gotten some 
singing engagements, including a recent appearance at the Directors Guild. 
</P>
<P>
But the focus this week is the World Cup. Albert won't see the surprised faces 
when he shows up backstage, but he'll be aware of them. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them are (surprised)," Albert said with a smile. "They ask me 
questions. A lot of those guys are inspirational to me." 
</P>
<P>
Delrio added: "He's a big inspiration to them, too. A lot come up to me and ask 
about him. He's one of a kind."

LOYOLA'S NOVAKOVIC IS A MAN ON THE MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It could be said Peter Novakovic is a dashing figure. 
</P>
<P>
If he's not dashing to work, he's dashing to soccer practice. In between, he's 
been dashing around town making wedding plans. Last week he and his fiancee 
whipped into his native New York City and were married. 
</P>
<P>
Novakovic -- a.k.a. Peter Novak to save time -- is a man on the run. Says one 
associate: "When you see Peter he always seems like he just ran in from 
somewhere, he's always sweating or running to somewhere else. You have these 
conversations with one-word answers -- 'Fine, great, see ya.' " 
</P>
<P>
"My day's a long day," says Novak, who works in an investment firm and coaches 
both the men's and women's soccer teams at Loyola Marymount. "This last week, 
between work, practice and picking up (wedding) rings, my life has been hectic. 
Working with the Middle East environment that's on Wall Street, coaching two 
teams, my heart's been racing from mid-August to now." 
</P>
<P>
All that's left for the second-year coach to try to squeeze in is a successful 
run in the West Coast Conference. That figures to be more a marathon than a 
dash. If the WCC isn't the nation's toughest conference, it's ranks right up 
there. Santa Clara is the defending national champ and is a contender again, as 
is Portland. San Francisco is a fully scholarshipped program that has won 
several national titles. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions, with no scholarships and virtually no financial support, are 
essentially a club team. But Novak is making progress with the talent on hand 
and says he's in for the long haul. In the Novakovic family, soccer is a 
passion, as much a part of life as eating or working. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad played for a first division team in Yugoslavia," Novak, 29, said. 
Playing in a tournament in Italy in 1958, his father defected and made his way 
to the U.S. Novak was born in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
"I basically grew up around soccer," he said. "I went to Adelphi University on 
a soccer scholarship. I have four brothers and two are on soccer scholarships 
now. When we were kids my mom had soccer laundry going nonstop. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been planning this wedding for a year. I had to make sure the wedding 
fell before or after the (Oct. 21) Santa Clara game. I thought of getting 
married at halftime of a game, I figured maybe that way we'd draw 100 fans." 
</P>
<P>
His fiancee, Helene Bozonier, drew the line there. "She just rolled her eyes," 
Novak said. 
</P>
<P>
She bears some of the responsibility, however, for Novak's double life. Friends 
of hers were the ones who revealed Loyola was looking for a coach for its 
women's club team. She told Novak, who figured that living in Marina del Rey 
near the Loyola campus and working East Coast hours, he could fit in a coaching 
stint. He contacted Loyola Athletic 
</P>
<P>
Director Brian Quinn and joined the staff as a volunteer coach in the summer of 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a good meeting," Novak said. "He was frank about the fact there was no 
money. A few weeks after, Brian called and was kind of in a panic, he said the 
men's coach just resigned and could I (coach) the men? I had just met with the 
women and felt committed to them, so I said, 'How about if I do both, I would 
like to try it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Novak met with another volunteer coach, Loyola graduate Jay Simon, and the two 
formed a coaching partnership. "The one area I kind of lack -- goalkeeping -- 
he's experienced in, so in that sense we're really matched," Novak said. "If 
I'm running late or one team's on the road we swap a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Novak, who works for Morgan Stanley Investments in downtown Los Angeles, goes 
to work at 5:30 a.m. and finishes in early afternoon. Most days, he rushes 
home, changes and goes to Loyola for practice at 3 p.m. He said his supervisor, 
Joseph O'Conner, has children in youth soccer and allows Novak to work a 
flexible schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"Luckily, the firm is an avid supporter," Novak said. "He even donates to the 
program." 
</P>
<P>
That's fortunate, because the Lions have to fight for what little money they 
get. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to build something that's never been here," Novak said. "We play 
five teams in the top 20 with zero money. We have to fight for uniforms. It's 
tough, sometimes, to get (the players) motivated. The women are basically on a 
life-support system but we're keeping it going. I think when Brian sees me now, 
he walks the other way. He knows I'll ask him for something." 
</P>
<P>
Quinn laughed when told of Novak's comments. 
</P>
<P>
"Considering the obstacles he has, it's a very difficult job to say the least," 
Quinn said. "Like any coach he's going to do the best he can for his kids. When 
he asks for something, it's never for him, it's always for the players. He's 
one of my least demanding coaches. I could use 25 more like him. He'd be a 
wonderful full-time staff member but with the job he's got, I doubt he could 
afford to give that up." 
</P>
<P>
Novak admits there are times when all the demands start to close in on him. But 
then he'll think of a player learning a skill he has worked on for months, or 
he remembers that his team was one of only two in the conference to score 
against Portland last year. 
</P>
<P>
"What keeps me going is I think of something that happened, maybe in practice, 
and it brings a smile to my face. I see we're improving." 
</P>
<P>
Along with sharing his soccer knowledge, Novak has done a good job of 
motivating the young team. The standout player is sophomore Eric Hill, and 
Novak starts a majority of sophomores and hopes to keep them together two more 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids, all they need is time and a little bit of money (for the 
program)," Novak said. "I'm sure down the road there'll be some rewards. We 
have a good nucleus. I'm hoping by their senior year we can really develop 
something." 
</P>
<P>
Hill, a halfback Novak said could play for any college team, said the team 
attitude "is improved tremendously." He added, "Skill-wise we're better but not 
what we need to be. We're inconsistent right now. But (Novak's) best aspect is 
he instills confidence in us. We were kind of intimidated. His main thing is he 
wants to win a couple of conference games. He says on any given day we can play 
with those teams." 
</P>
<P>
In his first season, Novak's team was mostly freshmen and went 3-13, the low 
point of which was a 9-0 whipping by USF. Two weeks ago, the Lions lost to the 
Dons, 2-0. Still looking for its first WCC victory, the team was 2-12 going 
into Friday's game at St. Mary's. They play at powerful Santa Clara at 2 p.m. 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"(The USF game) wasn't pretty but I told the guys nobody's gonna embarrass us," 
Novak said. "Last year I think some (WCC teams) tried to rock us. I don't feel 
like being lion meat anymore. One day this is all gonna turn around. I've got 
to applaud the kids. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran 'em at 6 a.m. in the preseason, they came two weeks before school 
opened and they weren't allowed to stay in the dorms so they were sleeping on 
my floor and Jay's floor for two weeks. They came because they love the game. 
They're eager. They got a little discipline, a little taste of what it takes. 
It's great to be able to pass on something you love. 
</P>
<P>
"You know the worst thing about coaching? It's sitting on the bench, not being 
able to go out there and do something when they need help." 
</P>
<P>
Said Quinn: "The kids play hard, they're very well coached. I deeply appreciate 
the job he's doing. The concern I've seen, the caring, the compassion are way 
above and beyond what you'd expect from a part-time coach."

EL CAMINO TO HIT ROAD AGAIN AFTER TWO LOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You can't blame the El Camino College football team for being eager to play at 
home again, but the Warriors will have to wait another week as they travel to 
Cerritos on Saturday for a Mission Conference Northern Division opener at 7 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
It will end a three-game road stretch that's been cruel to the Warriors, who 
had not lost two in a row since 1986, Coach John Featherstone's second season 
at the school. That year El Camino finished 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
After that, the Warriors lost only two games in three seasons. In 1987 El 
Camino won the mythical national championship with an 11-0 record, in 1988 it 
went 9-1-1 and in 1989 it finished 10-1 after losing to Riverside in the Orange 
County Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino started this season by winning its first four games and earning a No. 
1 national ranking by the JC Grid-Wire. It has been on a downhill slide since. 
The Warriors dropped to No. 8 in the rankings after losing to Riverside, 24-14, 
and out of the rankings after losing to Fullerton, 31-24, last week. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not happy with our losses, but we're not going to fold our tents because 
we lost to two good teams," Featherstone said. "We're not a great football 
team. We're good, but we're not great this season." 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos (4-1, 3-1) has not defeated El Camino since 1984. The Falcons, who had 
a bye last week, are ranked 16th. Their only loss is against second-ranked 
Fullerton, the only undefeated team in the 16-member Mission Conference. 
Cerritos has defeated Palomar, Orange Coast, San Diego City and San Diego Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"They're rested and they're gunning for us," Featherstone said. "Everybody is. 
I told the kids that it's a new ball game. It's the first game of our division 
and we're off to a fresh start. The winner of the division is guaranteed a bowl 
game so we're still in the running." 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos has a balanced offense that averages 383 yards a game. Quarterback 
Peter Montera has completed 47 passes for 781 yards and five touchdowns. 
Running backs Carwin Pinkney and Shawn Jones lead Cerritos' running game. 
Pinkney averages 92.7 yards a game and Jones averages 70. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino's offense (436 yards a game) is second in the league to Palomar. The 
Warriors' Anthony Daigle continues to lead the conference in rushing and 
scoring (13 touchdowns). The freshman tailback has gained 729 yards on 129 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Rod Harvey is second to Palomar's Brett Salisbury in Mission 
Conference passing. Harvey has completed 113 of 187 attempts for 1,530 yards 
and 10 touchdowns. The sophomore from Morningside High has only four 
interceptions and Salisbury has 12. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino's defense will be hampered by the absence of strong safety Donavan 
Gallatin, who suffered a concussion in last week's game. The freshman from El 
Segundo High had eight unassisted tackles, three pass deflections and an 
interception before getting knocked out. Featherstone said he'll be sidelined 
for at least two games. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night's Western State Conference game between Harbor College and Santa 
Barbara will feature teams with identical records (3-2, 2-2 in the WSC). The 
difference is that Harbor is coming off a big win and Santa Barbara is coming 
off a huge loss. The Seahawks are confident after last week's 25-21 victory 
over West L.A., which snapped a two-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor's other victories are against Victor Valley and L.A. Southwest. The 
Seahawks lost back-to-back WSC games to Pierce and Santa Monica before their 
last-minute victory at West L.A. Harbor's Glenn Baham ran for a seven-yard 
touchdown with less than three minutes remaining for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica defeated Santa Barbara, 38-14, last week. The Vaqueros' other loss 
is against top-ranked Bakersfield, the only undefeated team in the 12-member 
WSC. Santa Barbara has defeated West L.A., Pierce and Hancock. 
</P>
<P>
Game time is 7:30 p.m. at Habor. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Southwest's schedule presented a great opportunity for the Cougars to gain 
ground. The Cougars are in the midst of three games against the league's weaker 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest (2-3, 1-3 in conference play) snapped a three-game losing streak last 
week against winless Ventura and this week plays Pierce (2-3, 2-2). 
</P>
<P>
Before last week's home victory, the Cougars had not won since their opener 
against Rio Hondo. They have lost to Harbor, Glendale and 14th-ranked Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce fell, 35-22, to Glendale. The Brahmas have also lost to Santa Barbara 
and East L.A. Their victories came against Compton and Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Game time is 1 p.m. at Southwest.

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK;

<P>
CHAPMAN SCHEDULES LSU . . . FOR THE EXPERIENCE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Following the lead of the Cal State Fullerton and Cal State Long Beach football 
teams, the Chapman College men's basketball team has scheduled a game it 
doesn't expect to win this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers will step up an NCAA division -- and then some -- when they play 
Louisiana State in Baton Rouge on Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
LSU has qualified for the Division I playoffs seven years running and advanced 
to the Final Four twice in the 1980s. It's the LSU of 7-foot-1 sophomore center 
Shaquille O'Neal against Chapman, which was 11-16 overall and 3-11 in the 
Division II California Collegiate Athletic Assn. last season. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman Coach Bob Boyd admits his team, which started practice Monday, doesn't 
have much of a chance. He says the trip, which includes a game against McNeese 
State, another Division I school, will give the players a unique experience. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them don't know anything about the South," said Boyd, who coached 
five years at Mississippi State. He added that his players will compete against 
some of the best players in the country and be exposed to the coaching of his 
friend, LSU's Dale Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd said Chapman will also receive a $10,000 guarantee for the game in Baton 
Rouge and $5,000 plus the cost of hotel rooms for playing McNeese State the 
next day in Lake Charles, La. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd said that will more than pay for the trip, adding that he hopes to take 
his team on a Division I excursion every year. Because of the emphasis on 
schedule strength to determine qualifying for the NCAA playoffs, Boyd said it 
is difficult to get many Division I schools to schedule his team. That is why 
he is thankful to Fullerton Coach John Sneed for doing so this season. 
</P>
<P>
"John is really helping the Chapman program to be a notch above Division II," 
Boyd said. "Were playing LSU, Fullerton and McNeese State and not many Division 
II schools get to do that. It probably won't help our record any, but I'm not 
trying to use Chapman as a stepping stone. I'm not trying to build my coaching 
record." 
</P>
<P>
The magnitude of the mismatch against LSU appears so great -- the Panthers' 
starting center is eight inches shorter than O'Neal -- that Boyd is already 
facing reporters' facetious questions. He has been quick with his replies, 
apparently honing the one-liners. 
</P>
<P>
"We might be a smidge over our heads," Boyd said. "How's that for another 
tongue-in-cheek answer?" 
</P>
<P>
The defeat suffered by the Southern California College women's volleyball team 
against Christ College Irvine Tuesday, probably ended its playoff chances. The 
Vanguards, who started their season 12-5 and received votes in the NAIA 
national poll, are 15-17, 1-8 in the Golden State Athletic Conference. With 
three matches remaining, it's apparent they will not be among the five 
conference qualifiers for the District 3 playoffs. 
</P>

College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
Southern California College cross-country runner Sherri Hall won her second 
Golden State Athletic Conference title in three years when she ran 18 minutes 
16 seconds for five kilometers on the course at Bonelli Park in San Dimas 
Saturday. Hall, a 39-year-old mother of two, finished 14 seconds ahead of Azusa 
Pacific's Jenee Ellis, the only conference runner who has beaten her this 
season. Amber Coley was eighth in 19:29 and Stacey Cabral was 20th in 21:28 for 
SCC, which finished with 82 points, fourth out of five teams and 38 points 
behind the winner, Westmont. Tim Bryan, the top finisher on SCC's men's team, 
was 21st, running 28:02 for eight kilometers. . . . On Saturday, SCC will play 
host to its cross-country invitational on the Newport Back Bay course. The 
starting line for the meet, which begins at 9 a.m., is near the Costa 
Mesa-Newport Beach YMCA. . . . Because of injuries, Christ College Irvine still 
wasn't able to post a women's team score in the GSAC meet, but Renee Carroll 
finished 19th in 21:22 and Karla Keithly was 21st in 22:40 in her first 
competitive race. For the men, who also have yet to field a full team, Mark 
Powell was the highest finisher at 34th, with a time of 29:20. . . . The 
Pacific Christian women's volleyball team will begin the National Christian 
College Athletic Assn. District 7 Regionals today at Arizona College of the 
Bible. Pacific Christian (16-6) will play host to the national championship 
next week in Fullerton.

BANKRUPTCY JUDGE ORDERS EXPANDED PROBE OF PARKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A federal bankruptcy judge Thursday ordered an expanded investigation into an 
alleged multimillion-dollar equipment leasing fraud by Parker North American 
Corp., a defunct Costa Mesa company. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing before Judge John Ryan, bankruptcy examiner Robert Poyourow 
described how at least $12 million that Columbia Savings &amp; Loan of Beverly 
Hills invested in equipment leases with Parker North American ended up instead 
as cashier's checks made out to former Chairman Michael E. Parker, his family 
and business associates. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, 42, is a prominent Newport Beach businessman and was chairman of Parker 
North American until the day before the firm filed for bankruptcy in March, 
1989. Parker is now chairman of Parker Automotive Corp., a Costa Mesa 
manufacturer of engine-cleaning products. 
</P>
<P>
Parker North American leased equipment such as automated teller machines to 
banks and savings and loans. 
</P>
<P>
Under Parker North American's business deals with Columbia, Poyourow said, 
Columbia would pay 20% in cash to Parker North American to buy equipment on 
Columbia's behalf. Columbia financed the rest of the equipment cost through a 
third-party lender. 
</P>
<P>
Parker North American would lease the equipment to various firms, and the 
leasing fees were used to pay off the loans. As the owner of the equipment, 
Columbia stood to garner significant tax benefits from the deals. 
</P>
<P>
Parker and some of his associates have become the subjects of several lawsuits 
alleging fraud in connection with leasing deals. Parker North American also is 
under investigation by the FBI and Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia Savings and Loan in August filed a racketeering lawsuit in federal 
court against Parker and three other men, including one of its own former vice 
presidents, for allegedly carrying out "an illegal scheme to defraud Columbia 
of millions of dollars." Parker denies any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is obvious to the court that a fraud has occurred," John Graham, an 
attorney representing the unsecured creditors of bankrupt Parker North 
American, said after hearing Poyourow's report Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan praised Poyourow's work in tracing 17 of 102 lease transactions involving 
Columbia Savings and Parker North American. He instructed him to investigate 
the remaining transactions and to find out exactly what happened to the checks 
made out to Parker and other "third parties" who were not part of the business 
arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
Poyourow said he discovered that of the 17 lease transactions that he studied, 
five were for "fictitious" leases of equipment that was never purchased. In 11 
other instances, he said, the price of the equipment in which Columbia Savings 
&amp; Loan invested was inflated beyond its cost. 
</P>
<P>
"On Columbia's books, the numbers were uniformly inflated," Poyourow said. By 
contrast, he said, the financial records of Parker North American and of the 
banks that leased the equipment reflected the accurate costs. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Columbia invested about $31.1 million in Parker North American leases. 
But only about $19.3 million is recorded on Parker North American's books, 
Poyourow said. 
</P>
<P>
Poyourow told the judge he will need four to five months to complete his 
investigation. In addition, he said he needs to obtain additional Parker North 
American financial records, many of which have been seized by federal 
investigating agencies.

Unocal Ends Car-Junking Program: The Los Angeles-based oil company concluded 
its program to buy heavily polluting cars and scrap them as a way to cut 
vehicle emissions, saying that the company had junked 8,376 pre-1971 cars. The 
company estimated that the program, under which Unocal paid car owners $700 
each for their junkers, resulted in a reduction of 10.7 million pounds of 
pollution from the air, or about 53% more than originally expected.

SWEEPING OVERHAUL OF ARGENTINA'S ENERGY SECTOR URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS BREZINA, UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A report by the World Bank urges Argentina to make a sweeping reorganization of 
its energy sector to allow for more competition, more realistic pricing and a 
greater participation of the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report: 
</P>
<P>
* Argentina's oil reserves are one-third lower than the country claims, and its 
oil output could fall by almost 40% by the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
* Gas reserves, seen as the key to future energy development in the South 
American nation, are also smaller than the Argentine state oil company has 
calculated. 
</P>
<P>
* Plans for additional nuclear power plants should be scrapped in favor of more 
economical alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
World Bank economists and oil industry analysts see an opportunity for 
Argentina to expand its oil exploration and production in the wake of Iraq's 
invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, which has led to a doubling in the price of oil. 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Quijano, an analyst with the Petroleum Finance Company Ltd., a 
consulting firm in Washington, said in a recent study for the U.S. Department 
of Energy that only a small fraction of Argentina's territory, estimated at 10% 
to 20%, has been tested for oil. 
</P>
<P>
For Argentina to take advantage of the Middle East crisis, Quijano said, it 
needs a coherent oil development policy. 
</P>
<P>
The administration of President Carlos S. Menem, who took power in July, 1989, 
is trying to liberalize traditional Argentine energy policies with "bold" 
measures to spur domestic and foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
But Quijano contended that there now are too many policy conflicts among 
Menem's ministers, and turf battles among the federal government and provincial 
authorities, to entice foreign capital to participate in oil exploration and 
production in Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
Such participation is badly needed if the country is to increase its weak oil 
output and expand the size of its reserves, both of which have declined since 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
The Argentine state oil company, Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales, includes in 
its estimates a significant volume of oil reserves "classified under the unique 
concept termed 'conditional reserves' " that are not recoverable under existing 
economic conditions, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
To obtain reserve volumes in agreement with "currently acceptable definitions," 
the bank revised the official YPF estimates, excluding those reserves for which 
no production technology exists or for which there are no processing and 
transportation facilities.

<P>
The bank calculated that Argentina's proven oil reserves were 1.41 billion 
barrels at the beginning of 1988, with little change during 1989 -- 35% lower 
than YPF's estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Projecting into the future, the World Bank estimates that Argentine crude oil 
output could drop from about 165 million barrels in 1990 to 101 million in the 
year 2000, a 39% loss. 
</P>
<P>
Under the bank's "minimum supply scenario," by the year 2010 crude oil 
production would plunge to 30 million barrels a year and to 18 million barrels 
by 2014. 
</P>
<P>
Downstream from well production, the Argentine oil sector is hobbled by other 
serious problems, the bank said. 
</P>
<P>
YPF, responsible for most of Argentina's oil output and processing, suffered 
total losses of $1.7 billion in 1987 and $1.8 billion in 1988, the bank said, 
and its refineries are "grossly inefficient energy consumers" and suffer high 
levels of production losses. 
</P>
<P>
Oil export prospects, in turn, are jeopardized by inadequate port facilities. 
</P>
<P>
While the bank said Argentina has developed the largest nuclear power program 
in South America, it advised the country to "eliminate new nuclear plants from 
the (energy) development program" since they would not be as economical as 
other power-generating options.

UAL, CONISTON SETTLE DIFFERENCES; SIEGE ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The embattled parent of United Airlines on Thursday made peace with its largest 
shareholder, effectively ending a 15-month takeover siege. 
</P>
<P>
UAL Corp. said two principals from shareholder Coniston Partners will join its 
board. In return, New York money manager Coniston will not sell shares "in any 
major block" and will not buy shares "to any material extent" for 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise agreement prevents Coniston, which owns 11.8% of UAL's shares, 
from participating in an unwanted takeover for the nation's second-largest 
airline. The pact also protects UAL from such a takeover, since it would be 
difficult for an outsider -- or its unions -- to buy the company without 
Coniston's support. 
</P>
<P>
UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf said the agreement put "the uncertainty about 
ownership behind us," allowing UAL to "move forward to focus our full attention 
on United's long-term strategic plan and industry opportunities as they arise." 
</P>
<P>
Wolf struck the deal with Coniston in a meeting in New York on Wednesday. It 
was approved by UAL's board Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Coniston had pressed for a takeover to recover huge paper losses on its UAL 
investment. It paid an average of $160 each for its shares in UAL, which closed 
Thursday at $94.75, up $5. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Coniston concluded that an effort to take control of UAL might not 
succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"In consideration of worldwide economic conditions, including the price of oil, 
working with management and the board will produce the greatest value for 
shareholders," said Paul E. Tierney Jr., a Coniston principal who also is 
joining UAL's board. 
</P>
<P>
Coniston' agreement with United is a blow to the airline's unions. Coniston had 
supported the unions' recent attempt to buy the company. When the union bid 
collapsed last week, the unions said they would nonetheless continue to pursue 
employee ownership. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for United's flight attendants said Wolf had promised to contact 
the union about the deal but had not yet done so. "We are holding them to their 
word and reserving comment until then," said the spokeswoman, Bobbie 
Pilkington. 
</P>
<P>
F. C. Dubinsky, chairman of the United pilots union, also had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
The unions have open contracts and have said they are looking for "industry 
leading" raises. They had previously threatened possible strikes if their 
takeover efforts failed. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Gollust, the other Coniston principal who is joining UAL's board, said in 
an interview that the investment firm still believes in employee ownership "in 
principle." 
</P>
<P>
However, judging from the fate of the union bid, Gollust said, "it appears the 
time is not right for employee ownership." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would advocate giving employees a greater say in UAL affairs, he 
said: "They already have a big say. There is a continuous dialogue between 
senior management and employees." 
</P>
<P>
He declined comment when asked if he advocated giving the unions a board seat. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, announced after the close of the stock market on Thursday, was a 
surprise. Many on Wall Street expected Coniston to renew its takeover threats 
after the union buyout failed. 
</P>
<P>
Also, UAL said it intends to repurchase about 9% of its 21.7 million shares to 
boost shareholder value. There is no requirement for the board to do so, 
however. The company said the share repurchase plan won't affect its previously 
announced plan to allow employees to purchase shares.

IRVINE PC FIRM READY TO TAKE ON NEC IN JAPAN; 
</P>
<P>
COMPUTERS: WITH THREE JAPANESE DISTRIBUTORS, AST RESEARCH WILL BEGIN ITS SALES 
EFFORT NEXT MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
AST Research Inc., an Irvine-based personal computer maker, has signed up three 
distributors for its new made-for-Japan computer, overcoming the final obstacle 
to beginning sales next month of the hybrid machine. 
</P>
<P>
The machine drew strong interest when it was first announced in July because it 
was the first time an outside company had challenged NEC Corp.'s dominance of 
the Japanese personal computer market with a compatible machine. 
</P>
<P>
AST's DualStation 386SX (previously named the Dual SX/16) is compatible with 
both the NEC 9801 computer, which has become the standard in Japan, as well as 
with the International Business Machines AT. 
</P>
<P>
"We are committing significant resources to the development and promotion of 
the DualStation," said Safi Qureshey, AST co-chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese observers who attended Thursday's conference, however, were skeptical 
of how effective a challenge to NEC the DualStation could mount. 
</P>
<P>
"In Japan there isn't much demand for IBM ATs," said Seiji Matsufuji, a 
reporter for Nikkei Personal Computer, a trade publication. While AST was smart 
in making the computer NEC-compatible, Matsufuji said, it needs to make it 
cheaper to compete. 
</P>
<P>
AST said it would sell its cheapest model for $2,920, about the price of an 
equivalent NEC model without the AT option. 
</P>
<P>
Unless customers have set their heart on using IBM-compatible software, 
Japanese customers will choose manufacturers such as NEC with a strong 
reputation for quality, observers say. AST's choice of distributors also belies 
its intent to grab a 3% to 5% share of the Japanese market. One distributor, 
Okura &amp; Co., is a trading company with most of its sales in machinery and 
metals. Its distribution channels are primarily through dealers. Another, 
Proside Corp., is a relatively small entrepreneurial dealer. 
</P>
<P>
AST's third distributor, Swire Trastech, deals primarily with foreign companies 
in Japan and research institutes. None of the distributors have strong channels 
among retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
It is also far from clear whether AST's new distributors can bring the 
marketing muscle to compete with such powerhouses as NEC and Epson without a 
price advantage. Epson is the largest Japanese maker to sell a NEC-compatible 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics here said the new computer would sell primarily to the small number of 
users who absolutely must deal with both Japanese and English word processing. 
</P>
<P>
The company recognizes these weaknesses and plans to gradually build up its 
name and presence in the Japanese market over several years, a spokeswoman for 
AST Japan said. As AST's sales expand, she said, the distributors will also 
develop new retail channels. 
</P>
<P>
AST also announced Thursday that it sold more than 70 high-performance 
computers to the Tokyo Grain Exchange for about $1 million. The workstations 
will be used by traders on the commodity exchange.

RECORD SALES SEND MATTEL'S PROFIT UP 26% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing help from Barbie and a strong performance in foreign markets, Mattel 
Inc. reported Thursday that record sales drove its third-quarter earnings up 
26% to $47.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawthorne-based company said sales for the three months ending Sept. 29 
totaled $490 million, compared to $410 million for the same period in 1989. The 
third period is crucial to toy and game manufacturers because it marks the 
first half of retailers' Christmas buying season. 
</P>
<P>
The surge for Mattel, the No. 2 U.S. toy maker in terms of sales, came during a 
period of economic uncertainty for the industry. Wall Street analysts said 
industrywide sales this year have been relatively flat. With a 38% increase in 
foreign sales during the third quarter and a traditionally strong presence 
abroad, Mattel would be buoyed during a further slowdown in the U.S. economy, 
said Gary Jacobson, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"Domestically, the toy industry is facing very sluggish demand," Jacobson said. 
"On the international front, business is booming, and Mattel is being helped by 
the weaker (value) of the U.S. dollar in world markets." 
</P>
<P>
The weaker dollar makes Mattel products less expensive and more competitive 
abroad, but many buyers in the United States and Europe are also lured by some 
of the toy maker's newer products, said John W. Amerman, Mattel's chairman and 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Among the sales leaders are Magic Nursery dolls. The large toy is packaged in a 
hospital gown that dissolves in water, leaving underlying clothing and a card 
bearing information on the doll's sex. The Disney Preschool line of toys, 
introduced in 1988, also is enjoying strong sales, Amerman said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Barbie -- introduced 31 years ago -- is still the biggest financial 
boon to Mattel. A 30% increase in foreign sales of Barbie dolls helped boost 
the foreign portion of sales to 55%, Amerman said. Typically, about 50% of 
Mattel's business stems from foreign sales. 
</P>
<P>
"This shows that we're gaining market share around the world," Amerman said. 
"Our competitors are having more difficulty. . . .Our products are well-suited 
for international consumers." 
</P>
<P>
Barbie sales, which account for about 45% of all of Mattel's annual business, 
are surging because other toy makers are concentrating more of their resources 
on toys and games for boys, said Carol Palmer, an analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps 
in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been less competition in girls' lines," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer said Mattel has outperformed industry expectations. She said it is now 
gaining on Hasbro, the No. 1 U.S. toy maker. Hasbro reported an earnings 
increase of 6% in the third quarter, but its sales have not been rising as 
rapidly as Mattel's.

MARKET BEAT: AT THE HEART OF THIS RALLY, SHORTS WERE BUSY BUYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lot of people had come to believe that short selling was like printing money. 
But Thursday, the shorts' smug attitude was cut to ribbons, as stocks staged a 
surprise rally that fed on the shorts' worst fear: the bear market's end. 
</P>
<P>
The shorts -- traders who borrow stock and sell it, expecting to buy it back 
cheaper later -- have ruled the market's slide since July. Shares sold short on 
the New York Stock Exchange hit a record 706.3 million in September. 
</P>
<P>
As the shorts sell, they help drive the market down. In a bear market that 
already has enough to worry about, the shorts make things worse. 
</P>
<P>
But in the market's usual perverse way of doing things, a growing short 
position also becomes a weapon against the very traders who use that tactic: At 
the first sign of a real rally, terrified shorts often buy like crazy to cover 
their positions. 
</P>
<P>
As the shorts start buying, the action attracts more buyers, and the rally 
feeds on itself. The more shorts in the market, the greater the potential fuel 
for panic rallies. And with so many more amateur traders shorting these days, 
trigger fingers are the rule rather than the exception. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's 64.85-point surge in the Dow Jones industrials, to 2,452.72, led a 
broad market rally that was to a great degree driven by short-covering, many 
traders said: 
</P>
<P>
* "I think that was basically it," said Tracy Wheeler, over-the-counter trading 
chief at Seidler Amdec Securities in Los Angeles. "The shorts figure they 
better buy now," he said, because of the possibility of imminent deals in 
federal budget talks and in the Iraq-Kuwait crisis. 
</P>
<P>
* Robert O'Toole, head of OTC institutional trading for Shearson Lehman in New 
York, agreed that much of the buying was by shorts, rather than by true 
investors hunting for bargains. Quickly surveying traders around his desk, he 
said, "We don't see the major institutions buying today." 
</P>
<P>
Other traders, however, insisted there was legitimate buying throughout the 
day, as optimistic investors began to look past the budget and Mideast crises. 
"I think the last half of the action was certainly short-covering," said Sid 
Dorr, institutional trader at Charles Schwab &amp; Co. in San Francisco. "But I 
also think that as much as the market has come down, it has exposed a lot of 
values in stocks," and that investors were responding to that Thursday, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some technical analysts, who watch market chart patterns, also argue that Wall 
Street is primed for a sustainable rally. Andrew Addison, who writes the 
Addison Report market newsletter from Franklin, Mass., notes that while about 
700 NYSE stocks hit new lows in the deep market selloff in late August, the 
number of new lows at the depths of last week's selloff was around 400. 
</P>
<P>
That says the market's internals are strengthening, he contends. He thinks the 
Dow could rise about 8%, to 2,650, by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
The huge short position suggests we could get there even faster. The new short 
players are likely to lose sleep over the prospects of big losses if stocks 
turn up. So more who didn't cover their positions Thursday may do so today. 
Good news from Washington or the Mideast would cause the shorts further 
indigestion. 
</P>
<P>
To many analysts, the bear market still is on. But the rallies that will occur 
periodically within the bear cycle now seem likely to be wild affairs, given 
the unprecedented short presence. 
</P>
<P>
New Trouble for OTC Stocks: More brokerages are cutting back on market making 
in over-the-counter stocks. That will make it even harder to trade these mostly 
smaller issues. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Brokerage Services, a Los Angeles-based discount broker, last week 
halted market-making activities entirely -- meaning it will no longer keep 
inventories of specific stocks, and so will no longer stand ready to buy or 
sell those issues at set prices. The firm had kept markets in more than 40 OTC 
stocks, such as software firm Borland International and computer systems firm 
MIPS Computer. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Wallace, Pacific's owner, denied rumors that the firm was in financial 
trouble. "Far from it. We were profitable in September," despite the bear 
market, he said. The desire to stay profitable was what forced his hand, 
Wallace said. "The OTC market is very volatile, and the risk-reward ratio (in 
market making) isn't worth it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles has trimmed its OTC 
market-making positions by 5% to 7% in the past 30 days, to about 350 stocks, 
said Larry Rice, OTC trading chief. 
</P>
<P>
When an OTC stock is dropped by a market maker, there is one fewer firm price 
quote available. In many cases, only a few brokerages may be left quoting firm 
prices -- which makes it harder for investors to buy or sell the stock, and 
often tougher to get a decent price. 
</P>
<P>
Many market makers have been getting killed by maintaining inventories in small 
OTC stocks that have collapsed in recent months. The market makers are 
obligated to use their capital to buy the shares as investors dump them. Yet 
there are no buyers on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Wallace and other small brokerage chiefs complain that many larger 
trading houses refuse to deal in OTC stocks when the market is free-falling. 
"When the market is down 100 points, there still are firms that don't answer 
their phones," he contends. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the National Assn. of Securities Dealers says the number of 
market-maker positions in individual OTC stocks totaled 45,496 in September, 
down from 47,667 in July. Clearly, more brokers will drop out as the bear drags 
on. That's going to be a growing problem for investors, and for the companies 
behind the stocks.

SMALL BUSINESS: STAYING ON CAN HELP EX-OWNER AND FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five years after Ed Kramar and his partners founded Cypress Electronics in 
Santa Clara, they knew that they needed more cash to expand their wholesale 
electronics distribution firm. They borrowed some money, then began casting 
about for a buyer, figuring that they would stay on or go, depending on who 
bought the company. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Cypress agreed to be acquired for $4 million by Brajdas Corp., a 
public company based in Woodland Hills. Kramar agreed to stay on as president 
and asked his attorney to draft what is known in the world of mergers and 
acquisitions as an earnout agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Under an earnout agreement, the seller accepts a lump sum up front, and more 
cash down the road, with the amount usually pegged to the company's future 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
As small-business owners find venture capital and private funding sources more 
difficult to tap, financial advisers familiar with earnouts predict that they 
will greatly increase in popularity. 
</P>
<P>
"An earnout fills the gap in price between the buyer and the seller," said Gary 
Mendoza, an attorney who specializes in mergers and acquisitions for Riordan 
&amp; McKinzie in Los Angeles. In a well-drafted earnout, the buyer of a 
growing company benefits by having to put up less cash in the beginning. The 
earnout agreement also keeps key people around for a few years, increasing the 
chance of a smooth transition. Most earnouts serve as an incentive for the 
previous owners to work hard -- because their future compensation is hinged to 
the company's profit. 
</P>
<P>
Advisers caution that earnouts don't work for everyone, especially 
strong-willed entrepreneurs who would bristle at taking orders from new owners. 
Because there are so many legal and accounting factors, an earnout agreement 
should be written by experts. 
</P>
<P>
It should also include ways to undo the agreement if the deal doesn't seem to 
be working out. 
</P>
<P>
"You should have an unwind provision that specifies whether the seller gets the 
company back -- and at what price -- if things don't work out," said Mendoza. 
"If you sold good goods, you don't want to buy back bad goods." 
</P>
<P>
Cypress' Kramar asked Brajdas to reduce his earnout agreement from three years 
to two because he was facing certain ethical dilemmas related to the future of 
the company's operations. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Kramar said, he was torn between spending money to hire people and 
open new offices to bring in new business, or cutting back on expenses to 
improve the company's profitability. If he cut expenses, he could increase the 
amount of money he would receive under the earnout agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"But what might have been the best for me personally was not the best thing for 
the company," Kramar said. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Klein, chief financial officer of Brajdas, said the ethical situation 
that Kramar was in illustrates a problems with earnouts. The buyer must be 
careful to structure the deal so that the earnout does not interfere with the 
company's growth. 
</P>
<P>
But overall, Klein said, Brajdas is pleased with the way the Cypress earnout 
has worked, especially since Kramar is still part of the management team three 
years after the earnout expired. Kramar currently receives a salary and a 
percentage of the profits. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very fortunate that the former owners wanted to be part of a growth 
scenario," said Klein, who was responsible for presenting the former owners 
with monthly financial reports. Today, Cypress Electronics is one of three 
divisions of Brajdas, which had 1990 annual sales of $58 million and about 165 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
For Kramar personally, the first year after selling out was the hardest. 
"Before the sale, if I wanted to spend $200,000, I just did it," he said. After 
the sale, he had to ask the new president for his approval on major issues, 
although day-to-day operations were left to Kramar. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had sold the company to a more hands-on person, I probably wouldn't have 
lasted more than a year," admitted Kramar. 
</P>
<P>
Because earnouts are complex legal agreements, they are best drafted by a 
skilled attorney working with a good tax accountant. The accountant must 
consider all the tax ramifications of the lump sum payment and be sure the 
future compensation package is structured to give his or her client the best 
tax advantages. 
</P>
<P>
"Most earnouts are set up to last between two and five years," said Robert 
Untracht, the partner in charge of the diversified industries group at Ernst 
&amp; Young in Century City. Untracht, an attorney and a CPA, has structured 
several earnout agreements for big and small companies. 
</P>
<P>
Even the most well-written agreements can end in disaster if buyers and sellers 
have different ideas about how the company should be run. There also tend to be 
more problems when the seller is given a big chunk of cash up front and a 
paltry compensation package. With this approach, there is little incentive for 
the former owner to stay on and work hard. 
</P>
<P>
UP FOR AN EARNOUT? 
</P>
<P>
Before considering an earnout agreement, ask yourself these questions: 
</P>
<P>
* Will you be able to relinquish control and work with the new owner? 
</P>
<P>
* Are you willing to accept part of the sales price up front and the rest at a 
future date? 
</P>
<P>
* Will you be motivated to keep working after you put the initial payment in 
the bank? 
</P>
<P>
* Would you want the company back if the arrangement doesn't work out to your 
satisfaction? 
</P>
<P>
* Can you find a skilled accountant and attorney to draft an earnout agreement?

AST SIGNS JAPANESE DISTRIBUTORS FOR ITS HYBRID COMPUTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
AST Research Inc., an Irvine-based personal computer maker, has signed up three 
distributors for its new made-for-Japan computer, overcoming the final obstacle 
to beginning sales next month of the hybrid machine. 
</P>
<P>
The machine drew strong interest when it was first announced in July because it 
was the first time an outside company had challenged NEC Corp.'s dominance of 
the Japanese personal computer market with a compatible machine. 
</P>
<P>
AST's DualStation 386SX (previously named the Dual SX/16) is compatible with 
both the NEC 9801 computer, which has become the standard in Japan, as well as 
with the IBM AT. 
</P>
<P>
"We are committing significant resources to the development and promotion of 
the DualStation," said Safi Qureshey, AST co-chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese observers who attended Thursday's conference, however, were skeptical 
of how effective a challenge to NEC the DualStation could mount. 
</P>
<P>
"In Japan there isn't much demand for IBM ATs," said Seiji Matsufuji, a 
reporter for Nikkei Personal Computer, a trade publication. While AST was smart 
in making the computer NEC-compatible, Matsufuji said, they need to make it 
cheaper to compete. 
</P>
<P>
AST said it would sell its cheapest model for $2,920, about the price of an 
equivalent NEC model without the PC AT option. 
</P>
<P>
Unless customers have set their heart on using IBM-compatible software, 
Japanese customers will choose manufacturers such as NEC with a strong 
reputation for quality, observers say. AST's choice of distributors also belies 
its intent to grab a 3% to 5% share of the Japanese market. Okura and Co. is a 
trading company with most of its sales in machinery and metals. Its 
distribution channels are primarily through dealers. Proside Corp. is a 
relatively small entrepreneurial dealer. 
</P>
<P>
AST's third distributor, Swire Trastech, deals primarily with foreign companies 
in Japan and research institutes. None of the distributors have strong channels 
among retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Lair, a vice president at Dataquest, a San Jose market research firm, 
said he would be surprised if AST could garner more than 1% of the Japanese 
personal computer market, compared to 50% for NEC. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a real tough market," he said. "(AST) is a salmon swimming upstream." 
</P>
<P>
It is also far from clear whether AST's new distributors can bring the 
marketing muscle to compete with such powerhouses as NEC and Epson without a 
price advantage. Epson is the largest Japanese maker to sell a NEC-compatible 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics here said the new computer would sell primarily to the small number of 
users that absolutely must deal with both Japanese and English word processing. 
</P>
<P>
The company recognizes these weaknesses and plans to gradually build up its 
name and presence in the Japanese market over several years, according to a 
spokeswoman for AST Japan. As AST's sales expand, she said, the distributors 
will also develop new retail channels. 
</P>
<P>
AST also announced Thursday that it sold more than 70 high-performance 
computers to the Tokyo Grain Exchange for about $1 million. The workstations 
will be used by traders on the commodity exchange.

DECLINING NUMBER OF BUILDING PERMITS LOOKS LIKE BAD SIGN FOR O.C. ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by John O'Dell, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of building permits issued to developers each month is a prime 
indicator of the direction in which the economy is heading. 
</P>
<P>
That number has been going down in Orange County for several months now, and it 
looks as if the decline won't stop any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
In July, builders were issued permits for 569 units in the county, down from 
about 1,450 in July 1989. In August, the total dropped to 489 units from 1,255 
a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The county's 28 cities usually account for about half the total. Permits issued 
for unincorporated areas -- which include traditional building hot spots such 
as Rancho Santa Margarita, Foothill Ranch and Aliso Viejo -- make up the other 
half. 
</P>
<P>
The county's share fell to about 18% of the total in August, with permits 
issued for just 86 units. September permit information for the cities isn't 
available yet, but county officials say they issued permits for a mere 40 
residential units in unincorporated areas last month. 
</P>
<P>
If that's half the total for all of Orange County, the bottom really has 
dropped out. And even if it is only 10%, that still would make September -- 
with about 400 units -- the worst month since the real estate depression of 
1981.

OUSTED GRADCO FOUNDER FACES NEW BATTLE 
</P>

Plenum Publishing Corp. Chairman Martin E. Tash, who succeeded in wresting 
control of Gradco Systems Inc. from its founder, Keith B. Stewart, in a bitter 
proxy fight, said Thursday he will seek to remove Stewart from control of 
Gradco's Japanese subsidiary as well. 
</P>
<P>
After learning that Tash and his supporters had gained a majority of positions 
on Gradco's board through a proxy vote, Stewart said Wednesday he would resign 
as chairman and chief executive of the company. 
</P>
<P>
However, Stewart said, he would remain chairman of Gradco Japan, the company's 
profitable subsidiary, which makes sorters for office copiers. He also hinted 
that he might try to acquire Gradco or retake control of it in the future. 
</P>
<P>
But the Tash group said in a statement Thursday that it will seek to exercise 
control, with its Japanese partners, over Gradco Japan "without Mr. Stewart in 
any capacity." Stewart declined to respond to the Tash statement. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not engage in a battle in the newspapers," said Newton H. Lee, 
corporate secretary of Gradco, who spoke on behalf of Stewart. "It reflects on 
the fact those people don't understand the conduct of business in Japan. 
Stewart shall remain (with Gradco Japan)." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the company announced that the vote results from its annual meeting 
last week have been certified by Corporation Trust Co. The five elected 
directors are Tash and his two associates, Harland L. Mischler and Bernard 
Bressler, and Gradco nominees Thomas J. O'Keefe and John E. Rehfeld. 
</P>
<P>
O'Keefe is outside legal counsel for Gradco, and Rehfeld is president and chief 
executive of Seiko Instruments USA in Torrance. The directors will be formally 
installed at a board meeting to be held at the company offices in Irvine today. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco stock closed at $4.75, up 12 1/2 cents in over-the-counter trading 
Thursday.

NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE: WILSHIRE SQUARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELENA BRUNET 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Ana's 31 neighborhoods reflect Orange County's diversity and cultural 
richness. The city's central section boasts two areas with houses dating back 
more than half a century: Wilshire Square, south of McFadden Avenue, and 
Heninger Park to the north. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from their physical proximity, the areas have two other features in 
common. They were developed in the same time period and have a quality of 
architecture that has all but disappeared from Orange County. Wilshire Square 
alone, however, has prevailed over the exploitation of developers. 
</P>
<P>
Wilshire Square is held together not by crises but for social reasons. Although 
residents successfully blocked a Santa Ana Public Works Agency plan last 
February to remove a large number of trees along their streets (the city agreed 
to allow one couple to hire a professional outside the city crew to trim a 
70-year-old cedar tree in front of their house) and also shut down a medical 
clinic (whose purported physicians had no medical credentials) operating out of 
a private home at Broadway and Russell Avenue, they also built a sand castle in 
the recent contest at Corona del Mar State Beach. 
</P>

Wilshire Square is held together not by crises but for social reasons. 
Residents successfully blocked a Santa Ana Public Works Agency plan last 
February to remove a large number of trees along their streets (the city agreed

70-year-old cedar tree in front of their house). They also shut down a medical 
clinic (whose purported physicians had no medical credentials) operating out of 
a private home at Broadway and Russell Avenue. On a lighter note, residents 
built a sandcastle in the recent contest at Corona del Mar State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
About 600 families live in Wilshire Square in 60-year-old homes with 
old-fashioned charm and character, said Guy Ball, a neighborhood resident of 
five years and editor of the city newsletter Eye on Santa Ana. Neighbors know 
one another. Ball describes the neighborhood as safe and relatively 
inexpensive: The selling prices for homes are $160,000 to $190,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
His explanation for his move to Wilshire Square sounds almost like an 
advertisement: He didn't "want to move to Riverside, can't afford to live in 
South County, and (didn't) want to live in a condo," Ball said. The choice 
within his price range in Costa Mesa was "a bare-bones tract home" for 
$120,000. In 1985, Guy and Linda Ball's home cost $104,000 for 1,500 square 
feet and a back yard. Today a three-bedroom home in Wilshire Square costs about 
$190,000. 
</P>
<P>
Wilshire Square dates back to about 1920, when the land was subdivided into 
lots for sale. More than 50% of the homes in present-day Wilshire Square were 
built before 1936. They are constructed of sturdy lath and plaster, with 
crown-molded ceilings, hardwood floors, curved archways and wood moldings. 
</P>
<P>
The Cheney House at 1102 S. Ross St. stands out among the Spanish 
Colonial-style homes in the area. William J. Cheney, a founder of Farmers 
Insurance Co., built this handsome home -- with its red-tile roof, stucco walls 
and pegged oak floors -- for his retirement in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
English Tudor Revival is exemplified in the multi-gabled roof line and large 
front window of the Jasper Farney House at 1134 S. Van Ness Ave., built in 1929 
for $3,500. A building contractor and real estate broker, Farney helped 
construct more than 500 homes in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Wilshire Square is "a real neighborhood, the way it's supposed to be," said 
Ricki Older, neighborhood association co-chairwoman. "We take care of each 
other," she said. And it's "still a neighborhood people can afford." There have 
not been a lot of intrusions by developers or the city into the neighborhood, 
Older said. "There's no apartment building in the middle of the block." 
</P>
<P>
And the homes are pretty unusual, she said. "It's a bonus; (there's) not one 
house that looks like another." 
</P>
<P>
Wilshire Square shares the quality of architecture and relative age with its 
northern neighbor. Houses in Heninger Park may be even fancier than those in 
Wilshire Square, Guy Ball said. 
</P>
<P>
In Heninger Park, however, the outcry in the neighborhood is about overcrowding 
and traffic, said Charlotte Thomas, chairwoman of Heninger Park Neighbors. The 
area has had severe problems with the physical deterioration of older 
structures. The rehabilitation of those buildings and the streets is the 
neighborhood's top priority. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it was an instinct for self-preservation that drove Heninger Park 
Neighbors to ask the city to declare the area a historic district. Old 
Victorian-style homes were being torn down, Thomas said, to make way for 
high-density apartments. The neighborhood was designated a historic district in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
"It's mostly bungalow homes constructed for the middle man," Thomas said, "as 
opposed to Victorian homes that were for the elite." 
</P>
<P>
These modest California bungalows, made of wood, stone or occasionally brick, 
were erected between the years 1905 and 1920, though some date back as far as 
100 years. They are generally a single story with a horizontal emphasis in 
their floor plans.

Like houses in Wilshire Square, Heninger Park homes were custom-designed and 
built in subdivided tracts. Among the builders catering to ordinary buyers were 
the Heninger Brothers, who would build a six-room bungalow for no more than 
$1,500. 
</P>
<P>
The Heninger House at 602 Birch St., in which one of the brothers briefly 
resided and from which the neighborhood takes its name, is unusual in that it 
is Victorian in style -- more formal and vertical than its immediate neighbors. 
Today the Heninger House has received new siding, windows, paint, sidewalks and 
landscaping -- and looks almost as good as new. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Santa Ana gave special recognition to the 500 and 600 blocks of 
Birch Street: The houses have signs posted on each building stating the date 
they were built and the original owner's name. Two apartment buildings with no 
aesthetic value, probably marking the demise of some treasures before the 
area's historical designation, now share the area. Birch Street today is also 
the site of major reconstruction with the asphalt resurfacing of an originally 
concrete street, new curbs and gutters. 
</P>
<P>
Several homeowners are making major rehabilitations to their properties. The 
Crane house, at 506 Birch St., is being restored, Thomas said. Another house at 
Sycamore Street and Chestnut Avenue has also been restored inside and out, with 
its exterior painted shades of peach and white. Thomas has lived in Heninger 
Park since 1968. She started the neighborhood association in 1982 to stabilize 
the area. The neighborhood has "stayed pretty stable and has even (been) 
upgraded in the last couple of years, with people taking more pride," Thomas 
said. "That's what our main goal is -- to make the neighborhood better than it 
is."

SPARKLE, GLAMOUR SEIZE FASHION SHOW SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Glittery Gala 
</P>
<P>
For starters, the invitations shed silver glitter. Onto your clothes, your 
hands, your lap. Onto everything. Maybe that's what party planners wanted when 
they whipped up the invites to the Huntington Harbour Cancer League's annual 
fashion show fund-raiser -- a little sparkle in the night, for so many nights 
to come. 
</P>
<P>
The theme of the benefit was "treasures" -- the shiny kind that spill from 
buried chests, the kind hunted by pirates. After cocktails and silent auction 
bidding Saturday, 500 guests sat transfixed in the Disneyland Hotel's grand 
ballroom as a swashbuckling crew of models scampered up and down a runway like 
shipwrecked explorers on a pristine beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates of PCH 
</P>
<P>
The fast-paced fashion show -- complete with sets, music and lip-synching 
professional dancers -- was produced by Carlton Burnett, with clothes chosen by 
Kitty Leslie, fashion coordinator of Newport Center Fashion Island. Models were 
picked from among Huntington Harbourites -- 16 women on the basis of style and 
skill, five men by membership vote. 
</P>
<P>
Why the discrepancy? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I doubt that very many men would actually try out," said event 
chairwoman Sue Madison, laughing. "It's just a fun thing -- it's kind of like a 
reward." 
</P>
<P>
Out they came, in casual togs and business clothes and evening wear -- the 
women with wide smiles and jaunty steps, the men with sheepish grins that said, 
Am I really doing this? 
</P>
<P>
Net Treasures 
</P>
<P>
The party raised about $150,000, according to league president Phil Lupton, 
bringing the Huntington Harbour group's fund-raising efforts for the American 
Cancer Society's Orange County unit up over the $1 million mark. Funds will be 
used locally for cancer research, education and patient care, Lupton said. 
</P>
<P>
Faces 
</P>
<P>
Committee members included Marilyn Bohle, Barbara Snegg, Ellen Goodwin, Missy 
Prowell, Jean Zimmerman, Jeanie Barnett, Jenny Huntsinger, Sally Fenton and 
Emmeline Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
Among sponsors were Kay and Jim Burra, Bobbitt and Bill Williams, Linda and Ted 
Cohen, Phyllis and Dix Helland, Mary Ellen and Bob Houseal, and Helen La Bayne. 
</P>
<P>
Quote 
</P>
<P>
Backstage is chaos," said Barnett, who modeled five outfits, including a black, 
backless hot-pants number that was quite popular with the male dinner guests. 
"You have to be really careful with the clothes and you have to get in and out 
of them really fast -- so you just pray you don't tear anything. Or go out 
there unzipped!" PAMELA MARIN

MODEL MAYOR'S OBSESSION ENDS IN MURDER; 
</P>
<P>
BAD DESIRE BY GARY DEVON, RANDOM HOUSE, $18.95, 326 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Henry Slater would be a shoe-in for any public office he chose. Young, 
energetic, articulate, independently wealthy and married to a charming and 
public-spirited woman, he seems wasted as mayor of a small California city. 
</P>
<P>
From all appearances, he should have his eye on the White House, or at least 
Sacramento. Why would a man of Slater's talents settle for grappling with 
parking zoning ordinances when he could be making laws for everybody? 
</P>
<P>
Gary Devon answers this question on Page 13 of "Bad Desire," after you've seen 
this paragon of civic virtue meet another man in a seedy bar far from the 
pleasant plazas of Rio del Palmos. 
</P>
<P>
There, in a dim back booth, the two conspirators write terse messages to each 
other in spilled sugar, tipping the canister onto the table, then sweeping the 
grains away for the next line. They never speak, but by the time they leave, 
money has changed hands and you know something horrid will happen before 
midnight Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Slater is insanely in love with Sheila Bonner, a 17-year-old high school 
junior. They met when she was a child of 10, living with her grandmother, 
Rachel Buchanan, after her mother's death. 
</P>
<P>
Slater watched the pretty child grow to luscious adolescence. Though the 
Slaters now have a lavish estate on the opposite side of town, he hasn't lost 
touch. The mayor continually cruises in one of his three cars, trailing Sheila 
from school to cafe to mall, spying on her day and night. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Sheila has been accommodating, thrilled to have a secret admirer and 
delighted with his gifts of jewelry. Unfortunately, these treasures stay hidden 
in her closet. Her grandmother doesn't approve of the relationship, and has 
forbidden her to see Slater alone. The meetings are furtive and increasingly 
unsatisfactory for him. She now has a boyfriend, a football star acceptable to 
her grandmother, and she's beginning to tire of the dangerous game with the 
mayor. The boyfriend has made Slater not only impatient, but desperate. If the 
grandmother could only be eliminated, he thinks, all obstacles to his union 
with Sheila would melt away. 
</P>
<P>
The crucial difference between a mystery and a psychological thriller is that 
in the latter you know the villain at once. The excitement must come from 
watching him enmesh himself ever more deeply in evil as the clues accumulate 
and suspicion heightens. 
</P>
<P>
In "Bad Desire," neither the police chief nor the betrayed wife act upon their 
knowledge, effectively depriving the novel of the villain's only antagonists. 
Without them, tension dissipates like the morning fog over Rio del Palmos. 
</P>
<P>
Given his druthers, Slater would have preferred the murder of Rachel Buchanan 
to be a neat shotgun job by the hired assassin. But when the hit man is killed 
in a bizarre accident before he can fulfill his assignment, Slater takes 
matters into his own hands. 
</P>
<P>
Rachel Buchanan is amateurishly but gruesomely killed, and, as Slater had 
hoped, Sheila turns to him for the consolation he's so eager to provide. The 
trinkets escalate into major gifts; the brief encounters stretch into 
passionate afternoons in Henry's secret house, a remote property he bought 
under a false name for just this purpose. 
</P>
<P>
We soon learn that Slater is an expert builder of sophisticated explosive 
devices. From his cushy office in City Hall, he detonates these all over town, 
then calls emergency council meetings to deal with the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, a trio of escaped convicts has been terrorizing the coast, 
distracting the police chief and remaining at large long enough for Slater to 
complete his metamorphosis from model citizen into serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
For a few weeks, Slater enjoys his idyll with Sheila, all the while keeping up 
a busy social schedule with his wife and working overtime at his mayoral 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
But honeymoons eventually end -- some gradually, others abruptly. Slater's is 
the second kind, and when it's over, it turns out that Henry Slater isn't the 
only person in Rio del Palmos to suffer from sexual obsession. But this one 
won't come as any surprise, either. 
</P>

TODAY'S HOT LOOK: STIRRUPS ON A SHOESTRING

<P>
Working girls will have to save their paychecks to wear Giorgio Armani's 
Italian dressing for success this fall. The extra long melton jacket is $1,460. 
</P>
<P>
It is paired with the hottest look of the season -- stirrup pants, here in 
chamois colored cotton/wool for $260. Armani's folk print silk scarf is $175, 
the gray suede gloves are $130 and the pointy-toe shoe boots in brown suede are 
$350. He tops it off with a melton wool toque for $250. Top to bottom, it's 
$2,625 worth of designer style. 
</P>
<P>
Everything is available at the Giorgio Armani boutique in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Working girls on a shoestring will love the Limited's version of the same look. 
Limited's Armani look-alike jacket is lightweight rayon gabardine, long on 
style and short on price at $140. Their stretch acrylic knit stirrup pants are 
an affordable $44 (available in a rainbow of colors). You can add their 
geometric rayon challis blouse; it's only $44. All from the Limited in the 
Beverly Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
If you want the whole look, here's what to add: a $125 velvet toque designed by 
Kokin from Neiman Marcus in Beverly Hills, brown pigskin gloves, $36, from the 
J. Crew catalogue and The Broadway's great shoe boot for $59, bringing this 
grand total to $448. JOANNA DENDEL

LISTEN: VERSACE HAS DESIGNS ON 'CAPRICCIO' SET

As the curtain fell on Italian designer Gianni Versace's spring ready-to-wear 
shows in Milan, he was packing his bags for California. He will attend the 
opening Sunday night of the San Francisco Opera production of "Capriccio," for 
which he did the costumes. He's scheduled to roll into L.A. early next week to 
talk to famed fashion lens man Herb Ritts about an advertising campaign. And 
his itinerary holders tell Listen that Versace also plans to chat up artist 
David Hockney while rounding out his fine arts swing down the West Coast.

TRIPLE TREAT: Designer Bill Blass was in Los Angeles this week to introduce a 
trio of new fragrances: Basic Black, Nude and Hot. "I feel strongly women don't 
want to wear just one fragrance anymore. You can't do two, because that makes 
it either-or. But if you do three, there is a choice," the robust designer 
explained during a luncheon and fashion show at Bistro Garden. After working 
for two years on the project, he has firm ideas about the application of his 
scents, priced from $35 for the body lotion to $85 for the perfume: "They're 
not to be layered. They're to be worn separately. Nude is the most personal 
and, in my opinion, the freshest. Black is the most sophisticated, and Hot is 
the most aggressive." After lunch, Blass and his fans gathered at I. Magnin in 
Beverly Hills to get personal and aggressive with his fresh resort collection.

PRECIOUS ADVICE: There will be major wheeling and dealing in New York Tuesday 
when Christie's holds its "Magnificent Jewels" auction. But if you are a 
first-time bidder, Patrizia Ferenczi, a Christie's vice president and one of 
the few female auctioneers in the world, advises that you only look. Don't do 
anything that could make you the new owner of something like the late Barbara 
Stanwyck's diamond flower brooch, valued between $9,000 and $11,000. "Even if 
you think it's the most beautiful thing in the world, get the feel first and 
understand what an auction is all about," she says. When you finally do take 
the plunge, "set a limit. Ask yourself, 'How much am I willing to pay?' And buy 
jewelry to enjoy and wear, not to keep in a vault." 
</P>
<P>
DESIGNER MINIATURES: Fed up with the price of designer clothes? It's a little 
known fact that you can get a Bob Mackie bias cut gown with gold sequins for 
$120 and a limited-edition Arnold Scaasi tulle ball gown for $395. The hitch? 
They're doll size. Mackie dressed a special edition Barbie for Mattel this 
year. He agreed to do the dress because, "Barbie is an American icon. She's 
America's No. 1 sweetheart." The doll's Madonna-like, Blond Ambition-tour 
ponytail is a coincidence. "It was done way before Madonna adopted the look." 
The Scaasi doll, named Cissy and made by Madame Alexander, is available only at 
F.A.O. Schwarz. The prices, by the way, include the dolls. 
</P>
<P>
GET IT WHOLESALE: The publishers of a new directory, "Garment District, Los 
Angeles," aim to make things easier for shoppers in downtown's maze of 
wholesalers -- and to help fight cystic fibrosis. The directory contains 650 
listings, cross-referenced by store name and merchandise category, plus 
freeway, area and block maps detailing the locations of parking, restaurants 
and, thoughtfully, automated teller machines. PBG Publications will donate 
$3.50 of the $10 price (plus $1.25 for postage) through Nov. 15 to cystic 
fibrosis research programs. To order, call 1-800-CF-CURE1 during business 
hours.

SHEER ENERGY PROPELS A RECONSTITUTED NPG 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lot has changed for National People's Gang lately, but the Orange County rock 
band's first concert with a revamped lineup made it clear Wednesday night that 
its high-energy, intense theatrics and considerable promise remain intact. 
</P>
<P>
NPG's 50-minute set at Bogart's was its first show without founding guitarist 
Chad Forrello, who left the band about two months ago. His replacement, Michael 
Glines (younger brother of NPG's bassist, Deyo Glines), brought a new, 
metal-edged dimension to the band's sound. 
</P>
<P>
Also playing his first show as a member of National People's Gang was Scott 
Dibble, who has given up his old job as the group's sound man in favor of an 
on-stage role playing keyboards and percussion. While Glines' guitar style 
signals a prominent shift, Dibble's playing accounted for small, subtle but 
useful shades of difference that reinforced NPG's customary tribal rhythms and 
broadened the sound. 
</P>
<P>
One thing that hasn't changed is the central role of Chad Jasmine, who is 
probably the most charismatic and least conventional front man on the Orange 
County rock scene. Jasmine is essentially a performance artist with a 
heightened sense of the bizarre, who also happens to command a strong, unusual 
singing voice. At Bogart's he was at the top of his form in terms of sheer 
energy and his ability to hold an audience rapt with contortions of voice and 
body. 
</P>
<P>
With only two weeks of rehearsal behind it, the reconstituted NPG played a 
short set of 10 songs, only three of which were drawn from its two albums. The 
new material was wide-ranging, occasionally fascinating, but short on the 
melodic hooks that give the albums, "The Hard Swing" and "Orange," a sense of 
balance between art-rock and more accessible pop. 
</P>
<P>
NPG's new approach emphasized sonic intensity over melody. Glines is a fast, 
accurate, detail-minded guitarist whose metallic flurries and wails recalled 
the style of Living Colour's Vernon Reid. He and Jasmine made a fine tandem in 
several instrumental breaks that featured Glines' guitar lines weaving rapidly 
around the thin, sustained snake-charmer tones that Jasmine called from his 
soprano saxophone. 
</P>
<P>
Glines revealed another dimension, though. On several slow, moody pieces that 
were among the best of the new songs, he set aside his metal-style spray gun 
and dabbed on textures judiciously. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Jasmine's song lyrics and spoken performance set pieces were nearly 
unfathomable (one new number is about a pair of dinosaurs who encounter 
romantic difficulties and neuroses akin to those suffered by modern humans). 
Others were obvious and a little heavy-handed in their irony -- for example, a 
spoken set piece about the endangered Earth. Still, the songs all came across 
with grabbing force, even when it was hard to figure out what they were getting 
at. And some of the performance bits, even when heavy-handed, employed 
memorable imagery (Jasmine spinning a globe on his finger, then fumbling it, to 
illustrate the planet's environmental fragility). 
</P>
<P>
NPG's musicianship was better than ever. The only question now is whether it 
can come up with strong enough songs to expand on the base it has built with 
extensive touring over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Forrello, who was in the audience, said he decided to leave NPG because of 
differences over the band's musical direction. He and Jasmine had launched 
National People's Gang together 8 years ago. "I still love him -- we'll always 
be family," Forrello said. The guitarist said he is now looking for a new 
partner who can sing and write lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
Hindu Rope Trick, a five-member band that includes NPG's former bassist, Chuck 
Morris, played a set of songs that were so airy they just floated away. 
Harmonica was the main solo instrument, but the clean, dissonant rise and fall 
that seemed distinctive at first soon lapsed into sameness. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the bill was Soul Scream, which featured a strong, steady flow of moody 
saxophone soloing by Kirk Tracy. The band could have used another lead 
instrument to help fill out the sound and provide some needed contrast and fire 
-- the two guitars both played subordinate, too-polite rhythm roles instead of 
challenging Tracy's sax. Half-sung, half-intoned vocals from Dave Tetreault and 
Larry Weatherford also were a bit short on presence but there were hints of 
potential for dramatic expression if the singers can muster a bit more muscle 
and fervor. 
</P>
<P>
Soul Scream sometimes recalled such British bands as the Smiths and Blue 
Aeroplanes, but it also achieved an unusual jazzy, sultry, nighttime feel in 
its playing without sacrificing a low-key rock pulse, thanks to drummer Dave 
Tabone, who also plays in Eggplant.

<P>
For Joseph Hossein Karimbeik, who heads the London-based Theatre in Exile, the 
idea of staging August Strindberg's "Miss Julie" at the Forum Theatre here 
seemed a natural. 
</P>
<P>
During his years in London, where he co-founded the troupe with Dario Fo, Hanif 
Kureishi and other notable writers, he discovered that "a lot of American 
tourists came to see our productions. And I noticed an amazing thing: Many of 
them lived in a place called Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, when he came to Southern California six months ago to star in an 
independently financed Hollywood movie, he figured that Laguna Beach might be a 
friendly place to set up theatrical shop until filming began. 
</P>
<P>
As for choosing to mount Strindberg's century-old play, Karimbeik cites two 
obvious reasons -- its ageless themes of sexism and class antagonism. Despite 
the playwright's notorious misogyny, "Miss Julie" is a classic feminist drama 
-- among the first in the 19th-Century canon -- and it is fresher in some ways 
than those of Strinderg's predecessor, Ibsen. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the first things I noticed when I came here," said Karimbeik, a 
handsome, 39-year-old, compactly built Iranian, "is that women are trying to 
prove so hard that they are as good as men. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I thought, that is what 'Miss Julie' is all about." 
</P>
<P>
Another, less obvious reason for staging Strinderg's classic is that there are 
only three main characters in the cast, "which makes my life much easier as the 
director," Karimbeik pointed out, especially considering what happened at the 
open auditions he held in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I put ads in the papers and I got about 500 people," he recalled. "But I was 
very surprised: Out of all this 500, two were good. . . . So I had to speak 
with somebody for the role of Miss Julie who doesn't have the experience but 
who has the quality and the talent." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Karimbeik should have been less surprised. He was not offering to pay 
any of his actors. In fact, while the theater rental fee and related costs are 
higher than expected -- he says they're getting into the neighborhood of 
$10,000 -- the production itself is being mounted virtually on a shoestring. 
</P>
<P>
Karimbeik, born and raised in Tehran, left his native country for England 19 
years ago, as a university student, when Iran was still ruled by the Shah. He 
had been "labeled a troublemaker" by the Iranian authorities, he said, because 
of his cultural activities in the poor, semiliterate neighborhood where he grew 
up. 
</P>
<P>
By the late '70s, Karimbeik enrolled at the London Drama Centre -- then headed 
by Peter Brooke -- and began to make a career as an actor on British 
television. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Karimbeik also became artistic director of Theatre in Exile, a touring 
company that stages the work of many Third World immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Using a pseudonym, Karimbeik wrote and directed three plays in a four-play 
cycle called "Someone Else's Child," about the repression of Iranian women 
under the Khomeini regime, which had taken over Iran in October, 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Although Karimbeik has moved to Laguna Hills, where he lives with his wife and 
son, the theater's London operation continues, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Karimbeik said he plans to divide his time between California and England, 
where he acts in "at least three television shows" a year. Meanwhile, the 
Hollywood action movie in which he was signed to star -- called "The Rogue" -- 
hasn't begun filming because of "the usual complications with the financing," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves him in limbo, if not in exile. And the financially risky 
undertaking of "Miss Julie" gives him a sense of having embarked on a serious 
cause in a fool's paradise. 
</P>
<P>
"You try to do something worthwhile," he said. "But it is very difficult."

MARY STAR BELTS PATER NOSTER, 38-0

<P>
Recording its second shutout in six days, the Mary Star High football team beat 
visiting Pater Noster, 38-0, Thursday night at Daniels Field in San Pedro in a 
Santa Fe League game. 
</P>
<P>
The Stars (4-3, 2-0) have out-scored their league opponents, 93-0. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Nick Mariani (who accounted for two touchdowns), running back Mike 
Baker (two touchdown runs) and kicker-running back Jose Bermudez (13 points) 
led the way against winless Pater Noster. 
</P>
<P>
After a first half in which the Pater Noster defense gave up 24 points and its 
offense had only one first down (on a penalty), the Eagles had to wonder if the 
long bus ride down the Harbor Freeway from Eagle Rock was worth it. Pater 
Noster's attitude didn't improve in the second half when it hurt itself 
immediately by getting an offsides penalty on the opening kickoff (one of 10 
penalties it had). 
</P>
<P>
Mary Star scored on its second possession of the game as Mariani passed 20 
yards to Brian Bolgona. Matt Redlew's 25-yard punt return set up the 35-yard 
scoring drive. 
</P>
<P>
On their next drive, the Stars made it 14-0, with Mariani scoring on a 
nine-yard run. A 35-yard field goal by Bermudez made it 17-0 early in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Baker scored on a 27-yard run with 2:33 left before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Bermudez had a 15-yard touchdown run in the third quarter and Baker's one-yard 
dive in the fourth quarter made the score 38-0. 
</P>
<P>
Pater Noster, despite using an exotic offense that often utilized five wide 
receivers, didn't manage a scoring threat until it got inside the Mary Star 10 
with under two minutes left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Pater Noster had zero yards of total offense in the first half.

Two students were in critical condition with burns after an early morning fire 
today that injured at least 23 students in a dormitory at San Jose State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
Four students were in serious condition, including one who suffered a broken 
back jumping from a third-story window. 
</P>
<P>
At least seven were treated for smoke inhalation and minor injuries in the 
blaze that forced more than 160 students out of Andrew Moulder Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"I opened the door, and fumes and smoke entered the room, and people started 
shouting 'Fire! Fire!' It was very wild," said Jorg Stoka, a bathrobe-clad 
German exchange student who lives on the second floor of the three-story brick 
dormitory downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was reported shortly before 6 a.m. and put out within an hour. The 
cause was unknown but it was believed to have started on the third floor of the 
east wing. 
</P>
<P>
Most Moulder Hall students, many wearing bathrobes and slippers, had no time to 
grab any possessions as they fled their building. 
</P>
<P>
"You just get out of there. You don't think," said junior Jana Garrett.

Winter made a sneak preview in western Nevada, as snow capped the Sierra today 
following what many hope is just the first of more wet storms to come. 
</P>
<P>
About four inches of snow fell at Mt. Rose Ski Resort on the Mt. Rose Summit 
around the 9,000-foot elevation. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope it keeps coming," said resort manager Paul Senft.

He said the white stuff started falling late Thursday afternoon.

<P>
"It's been snowing real light all morning," he said today.

Echo Summit reported mostly rain, but did see about an inch of snow at 7,350 
feet, meteorologist Jim Fischer said.

THATCHER'S TORIES LOSE SHOCKER IN LOCAL RACE

EASTBOURNE, England 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a stunning defeat for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who derided it last 
week as a "dead parrot," the centrist Liberal Democratic Party today won this 
Conservative Party stronghold in a special parliamentary election. 
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Democrats took Eastbourne, a prosperous southern England coastal 
town, in a huge 20.5% swing against the government. Balloting was to replace a 
legislator slain by the Irish Republican Army. 
</P>
<P>
The Tory trouncing was among the worst electoral setbacks suffered by Thatcher 
since she came to power in 1979. It prompted speculation she might feel forced 
to shelve any plan to call a general election next year, a year before her 
third five-year term expires. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the result had scant impact on Thatcher's control of the 650-member 
House of Commons, where the Conservatives have 373 seats, Labor 226 and the 
Liberal Democrats now have 20. 
</P>
<P>
The rest are split among minority regional parties. 
</P>
<P>
The victory by Liberal Democrat David Bellotti, 47, appeared in part to be a 
backlash to the Tory campaign theme that a vote for the opposition would be "a 
moral victory for terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
It also marked a revolt against government economic policies of trying to 
squeeze 10.9% inflation with nearly two years of high interest rates and an 
unpopular new local tax imposed in the spring. Critics also pointed to what 
they have said is under-funding of health, education and welfare services. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very poor result for us; there are no bones about it," Conservative 
Party Chairman Kenneth Baker acknowledged when the result of Thursday's ballot 
was declared early today. 
</P>
<P>
Bellotti, scooping 51% of the vote, overturned a nearly 17,000-voter 
Conservative majority in Eastbourne to win by a comfortable 4,550-vote margin. 
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives' Richard Hickmet went down with 18,865 votes. 
</P>
<P>
The vote for the socialist Labor Party, with a yearlong lead in national 
opinion polls but no hope in Eastbourne, collapsed to just 2,308, or 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Eastbourne had been Tory territory for more than 70 years and ranked among the 
dozen safest Conservative Party seats in the country.

YUGOSLAVIA ACTS TO DEFUSE THREAT OF ETHNIC WARFARE

<TEXT>
<P>
Parliament today moved to defuse mounting ethnic and political tension and 
warnings of impending civil war by naming a Croatian reformer to the country's 
collective presidency. 
</P>
<P>
A crucial parliamentary debate on whether Yugoslavia remains a federation or 
becomes a looser alliance was then postponed until at least November. 
</P>
<P>
The two moves indicated that the country's quarreling political leaders have 
decided to put off, at least for now, a showdown in their power struggle over 
Yugoslavia's future. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies loudly applauded a conciliatory speech by outgoing President Borisav 
Jovic, a Serb who holds the annually rotating chairmanship of the collective 
ruling body. 
</P>
<P>
"All bridges have not been burned. There are still possibilities for the crisis 
to be overcome," Jovic said after Stjepan Mesic, a Croatian, was named to the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Communist-ruled Serbia staunchly opposes the confederacy plan pushed by 
Slovenia and Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
Under it, Yugoslavia would become a loose alliance of sovereign states. There 
would be no central rule or national capital, and each state would decide how 
it would deal with each other on an individual basis. 
</P>
<P>
Serbia calls for a "modern federation" that would keep central rule in 
Belgrade, the capital of the country and Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies from Serbia -- the largest republic and Croatia's traditional rival -- 
had earlier blocked the election of Mesic, charging that he is a Croatian 
nationalist who seeks independence for his republic.

Barry, scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 26, faces up to a year in prison and a

Law enforcement officials had said U.S. Atty. Jay Stephens might consider

BID TO PUNISH CHINA ON TRADE DIES IN SENATE

<P>
A largely symbolic effort to punish China with higher import tariffs for 
repressing pro-democracy demonstrators faltered early today as the Senate 
missed a deadline to vote on the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The House voted 247 to 174 Thursday to immediately suspend China's trade status 
as a "most-favored nation." 
</P>
<P>
The vote was aimed at reversing President Bush's decision in May to keep the 
present low tariffs on Chinese imports through next June. 
</P>
<P>
Under a trade law enacted in August, however, the Senate also would have had to 
pass the resolution by midnight Thursday. Bush was expected to veto the measure 
anyway, and the two houses lacked the two-thirds margin needed to override his 
veto. 
</P>
<P>
Lifting the most-favored-nation trade status -- granted to China a decade ago 
-- would increase tariffs on its exports to the United States tenfold, 
drastically reducing the $18 billion in two-way trade last year. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Senate missed the deadline, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said the 
House vote "will exert destructive impacts on the economic and trade relations 
between the two countries and will surely result in a serious slide back of the 
bilateral relations." 
</P>
<P>
The Senate spent all Thursday night working on its deficit-reduction plan. At 
midnight, Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) pronounced the effort to 
curtail trade with the Chinese dead for the year. 
</P>
<P>
"I continue to believe that the President's renewal of this special trade 
status is wrong," he said early today. "It is a signal to the Chinese 
leadership and the watching world that the United States views its brutal human 
rights violations with complacency."

China today bought more than $43-million worth of U.S. wheat, its second major 
subsidized purchase in two days. 
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Department announced the sale of 449,370 metric tons of winter 
wheat to China through the U.S. export subsidy program. 
</P>
<P>
It came one day after China bought 299,750 tons of wheat, also at discount 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
China is one of the world's top customers for U.S. wheat, buying 5.5 million 
tons in the 1989-90 marketing year -- half of its import total -- and 3.2 
million tons so far this year, which opened June 1. There are 36.7 bushels of 
wheat in a metric ton. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese purchases this week, worth more than $72 million based on Chicago 
prices, marked a welcome week of activity for lagging export sales. The Soviet 
Union bought 350,000 tons of corn, its first corn purchase since last May 15, 
and several smaller grain sales also were reported.

United Press International and Reuters today settled their court dispute over 
photo services, agreeing that Reuters will continue to supply UPI with foreign 
news photos but will cover the United States for itself. 
</P>
<P>
A 1984 agreement called for UPI to supply Reuters with photographs from the 
United States and for Reuters to provide UPI with pictures from other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was to run for 10 years beginning in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Reuters later sued to void the picture exchange, and UPI filed a counterclaim 
saying Reuters negotiated in bad faith. 
</P>
<P>
No compensation or monetary damages will be paid by either organization under 
today's settlement, the news organizations said. The announcement said UPI will 
have the option of ending the exchange agreement by giving Reuters 30 days 
notice.

Fear of in-flight clashes between militant smokers and nonsmokers has prompted 
Lufthansa to drop plans to ban smoking on domestic flights, the airline said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The national German carrier had planned to ban smoking on its flights with the 
start of its winter schedule Oct. 28. 
</P>
<P>
But Lufthansa said passenger reaction to its plans had been "extremely 
divided," although a majority of smokers had indicated their willingness to 
accept the ban. 
</P>
<P>
But since federal lawmakers decided not to pass no-smoking legislation, barring 
smoking on flights could lead to "polarization and confrontations among 
passengers," the airline said. It said it could not allow passengers and cabin 
crews to be involved in such situations.

VOLKSWAGEN PLANS TO INVEST $2.8 BILLION IN E. GERMANY

Volkswagen AG plans to propel auto production in economically ailing eastern 
Germany with a $2.8-billion investment, the largest injection of private 
capital in what used to be East Germany, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the investment will be used for the completion of a plant at Mosel near 
the southeastern town of Chemnitz, VW Chairman Carl Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
An agreement was signed late Thursday by Hahn and officials of the former East 
German auto cooperative IFA Pkw AG. The deal was also signed by the trust fund 
administration supervising the privatization of about 8,000 former state-owned 
East German firms. 
</P>
<P>
The investment also is to be used to restructure IFA subsidiaries and renew 
production lines. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said the subsidiary at Mosel will start production by 1994, eventually 
increasing annual output to 250,000 Golf model cars. 
</P>
<P>
He said Volkswagen, the second-largest European auto maker after the Italian 
giant Fiat, plans to create a total of 8,000 new jobs in production and 6,500 
more in the service sector. 
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen was one of the first West German companies to invest in East Germany 
after the ouster of the hard-line Communist leadership last fall, while other 
firms hesitated to risk their money before German unification Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
The government recently created financial incentives for companies to enter 
joint ventures, buy firms or seek partners in the new part of the Federal 
Republic to speed up economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Volkswagen, with its $2.8-billion investment, qualifies for 
sizable government subsidies.

Kevin Rooney, former trainer of Mike Tyson, won the first round of his 
breach-of-contract lawsuit against the boxer when a federal judge today denied 
a motion for dismissal of the case. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge Con Cholakis denied the motion for dismissal, meaning 
the suit will go to a jury trial in early 1991, according to Megan Kuntze, 
Rooney's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney filed the suit a year ago, claiming that Tyson broke a contract that 
said Rooney would train Tyson for as long as the heavyweight remained in 
boxing. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney was Tyson's trainer from 1981-88 and was in his corner for the first 35 
of his 39 fights. Tyson, 25, fired Rooney in December, 1988.

<P>
The star goalie of the Lewisville Blaze soccer team for girls under 12 played 
her position so well that she became the object of a gender check controversy 
that resulted in the suspensions of several people, including coaches and 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
It all started Sept. 29 when 10-year-old Natasha Dennis was playing goalie for 
her undefeated team in a game against the Solhers, a Denton team. 
</P>
<P>
"Two fathers from the other team went onto the field during halftime because 
they wanted proof that Natasha was a girl," Linda Dennis, the goalie's mother, 
who was one of the suspended parents, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Blaze coach offered the men the team roster and birth certificates for each 
player, but the men were not satisfied, said Ronnie Dennis, Natasha's father 
and the Blaze's assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
"They expected her to go into the ladies' restroom and take her clothes off in 
front of some stranger," Linda Dennis said. 
</P>
<P>
Ronnie Dennis said that during the game, he knew his daughter's gender was 
being challenged. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew the question they were debating, but I didn't know they were insisting 
on a panty check until after the game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His wife took Natasha to meet one of her accusers after the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Excuse me, but I would like to take the opportunity to introduce you 
to my daughter Natasha.' He looked at Natasha real funny and said, 'Good game, 
boy,' " Linda Dennis said. "I said no, it's 'Good game, girl.' He said, 'Good 
game, son,' and started to walk away." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Farr, another Blaze mother who had followed the Dennises across the 
field, began arguing with the man, Linda Dennis said. 
</P>
<P>
The North Texas State Soccer Assn. decided on the suspensions Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"When she told me they asked for a panty check, I was appalled," said Ross 
Stewart, youth commissioner for the association. "I've been working in youth 
programs for 20 years, and this has never happened." 
</P>
<P>
Natasha, a 4-foot-5 fourth-grader with short brown hair, admits to being 
boyish. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate dresses," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Natasha said she did not appreciate the men's accusations. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they should go somewhere and check and see if they have anything 
between their ears," she said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the two Solhers fathers accused of asking for the gender check, Jeff 
Gutkencht, was suspended from attending league games for one year, and the 
other, Randy Hill, for the rest of the fall season. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Dennis and Farr also were suspended for two games, Stewart said, because 
"they should not have crossed the field." 
</P>
<P>
Ronnie Dennis, the assistant coach, was suspended for two games and put on a 
year's probation because he did not stop the parents, Stewart said.

Opera star Beverly Sills at a Catholic fund-raiser denounced violence and 
explicit sex in the arts. But she added that "you can't criminalize 
imagination." 
</P>
<P>
"We have laws today that tell us we can't smoke on airplanes, but you can 
freely sing -- if you'll pardon the expression -- about the joys of violating a 
woman's body in monstrous detail on commercial recordings because it's a 
constitutional right," said Sills, 61, who directed the New York City Opera 
from 1979 to 1989 after retiring from the stage. 
</P>
<P>
She addressed about 1,000 politicians and pundits Thursday night at the 45th 
annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Dinner. The $500-a-plate dinner, run by the 
Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, benefits health care causes. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not need self-appointed vigilantes to insist upon legislating artistic 
work because you can't legislate taste," Sills said. "You can't criminalize 
imagination. You shouldn't throw artists in jail." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, she said, higher moral standards are needed. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need more laws to be enacted," she said. "We need to be outraged and 
worried about our kids. We will not accept the lowest common form of human 
behavior as the price for free expression."

Kirk Douglas was named the 1991 recipient of the American Film Institute's Life 
Achievement Award today, which, coincidentally, is the 30th anniversary of the 
Los Angeles premiere of "Spartacus" -- one of Douglas' most memorable roles. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, 74, was informed of his selection by film institute trustee Steven 
Spielberg, who called him in the south of France where he is shooting Xavier 
Castano's "Welcome to Veraz" co-starring Gerard Depardieu. 
</P>
<P>
"This award is special because it was voted by my peers and recognizes a whole 
body of work," the actor told The Times. "It's a nice pat on the back, and if 
you've read my autobiography, you know that that's always been very important 
to me." 
</P>
<P>
With his clipped delivery and famed cleft chin, Douglas has been one of 
Hollywood's more enduring leading men, snagging three best actor Oscar 
nominations ("Champion," "The Bad and the Beautiful" and "Lust for Life") in 
his more than 60 feature film performances. 
</P>
<P>
Last seen on the screen in 1986's "Tough Guys", Douglas recently shifted his 
focus to writing. His autobiography, "The Ragman's Son," was published in 1988, 
and his first novel published in 1990, "Dance With the Devil," will be adapted 
for the screen. 
</P>
<P>
He will be honored March 7 at the Beverly Hilton.
