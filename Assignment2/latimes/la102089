KEEPING RTD BUSES ON TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wishart's column only substantiates what exasperated riders of the 406-407 line 
have experienced at least since I started riding the line in January, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
After numerous complaining calls, two petitions addressed to the local county 
supervisor calling for better service in the form of on-time buses, and local 
meetings attended by riders, RTD officials, and politicians, nothing has 
changed in 4 1/2 years of bus riding. 
</P>
<P>
At one point a few weeks ago, the bus that had been showing up at a particular 
time failed to arrive for three days in a row. Calls to RTD asking if there was 
an unannounced schedule change only inform the dispatchers what they already 
know, i.e., the bus failed to arrive as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons given by RTD for such shoddy service are always the same: lack of 
drivers, shortage of working equipment and a dearth of spare parts. Since bus 
riders can only vote with their feet, how will the powers that be convince more 
people to take the bus in view of the inability of RTD management to rectify 
the problems? 
</P>
<P>
Even the drivers are hampered by such ineptitude. One recent consistent and 
courteous driver left to drive another line when he realized that RTD would not 
provide adequate equipment to service the line. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, since there appears to be no particular accountability on the part of 
RTD officials to do anything about the problems, why should they? I'll continue 
to ride the bus because my company subsidizes the cost. My answer to the shoddy 
service is: What do you want for nothing? 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, fellow bus riders of the 406-407 freeway express to downtown Los 
Angeles from Sunland-Tujunga and thereabouts will continue to refer to RTD as 
the Ridiculous Transit District, or better, Real True Disaster.

<P>
Hooray! Someone wrote an article, not just a letter, about the awful RTD 
service. I don't think the average bus rider has the ambition to write a 
letter; riders are too tired from standing in buses or waiting for one. 
</P>
<P>
There is a printed sign in all buses that says it is unlawful to stand in the 
stairwell. Most of the drivers don't seem to pay attention to it. Since they 
cut down on the service on June 25 it seems they can't say to wait for the next 
bus because who knows when there will be another one. 
</P>
<P>
I hope Wishart's article will wake up some of the officials to improve the bus 
service.

Does your publisher read your editorials? "Edison's Great Leap for Equity" 
(Oct. 9) is the one I'm referring to. It contains more of your hypocritical 
preaching on equal employment opportunities. As I peruse the masthead 
immediately above this editorial, I fail to see a Mary, Jose, Kim, Wong, 
Tanaka, Jesse Jackson III, or any other indication of minorities in The Times'

FOREST TRAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Trail Maintenance Long Overdue," editorial, Oct. 12: 
</P>
<P>
The Forest Service has two interesting ways of dealing with poor trail 
maintenance, in addition to failing to insist on reallocation of funds from 
logging roads to trails. One is to allow a trail to get overgrown and drop it 
from maps in succeeding editions. An "antique" Forest Service map of the Los 
Angeles Padres Forest, the 1969 edition, shows a number of trails so treated. 
Trying to hike up the east side of Cobblestone Mountain is an example. 
Chaparral has obliterated the trail in enough places that it takes an expert in 
reading maps to make one's way. 
</P>
<P>
The second approach is to get groups to "adopt a trail," or at least to work on 
it, using Forest Service tools and some supervision. Although hikers have risen 
to the need, especially under the leadership of Ken Croker in the Cleveland 
National Forest, and Charlie Jones and John Robinson in the Angeles, there is 
an implicit guilt trip laid on hikers unmatched in other parts of the service's 
activities. We do not expect volunteers to cut down timber, although possibly 
that's next, since so much logging is subsidized by the Forest Service.

This slam at my fellow operators angers me. I love my job and what I do. But 
I'm sure that the author wants answers not explanations. We stress teamwork on

Sir, this is a large city, a first-rate city with a first-rate transit system. 
With so many people unable to afford a car, let alone the necessary insurance

BIG U.S. TROOP PRESENCE IS BECOMING A LIABILITY;

SOUTH KOREA: THE ECONOMY IS BURGEONING AND POLITICS ARE BOILING. IN THE 
MEANTIME, THE AMERICAN MILITARY FORCE IS BECOMING A WHIPPING BOY.

appropriations subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

<TEXT>
<P>
In their talks this week, South Korean President Roh Tae Woo and President Bush 
have been silent about the issue of withdrawing any of the 44,000 American 
troops based in Roh's country. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the two presidents' reluctance, recent violent demonstrations in Seoul 
only underscore the growing irritant that our troop presence has become in 
U.S.-Korean relations. The rationale for our $2.6-billion annual presence, 
which made sense in the days following the Korean War, has grown weaker each 
year as South Korea's economy continues to boom. 
</P>
<P>
Today, South Korea's economy is eight times larger than North Korea's and its 
population is twice as large. Clearly, South Korea has matured to the point 
where it can more fully shoulder the burden of defending against a smaller, 
poorer neighbor. But when asked when the United States can begin reducing its 
Korean troop presence, the White House and South Korea both respond, "not now." 
</P>
<P>
This is the same response that Americans have been hearing for years. Recently 
the South Korean defense minister was more explicit: "We can discuss the issue 
of withdrawing U.S. troops in South Korea only after the year 2000." In his 
remarks, the official indicated he had the year 2004, or perhaps 2006, in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, North Korea still poses a threat to South Korea. But no one is 
seriously talking about ending our ironclad security guarantees to the Seoul 
government. Military experts agree that North Korea could not sustain a war 
against the South without substantial Soviet or Chinese assistance. Yet the 
Soviet Union and China are looking inward to their own serious economic and 
political problems. Rather than being an impetus to North Korean ambitions, 
virtually all east Asian observers agree, the Soviets and Chinese help keep the 
brake on. 
</P>
<P>
In this context, it makes sense now to reevaluate our Korean security policy 
with an eye to what's best for our interests. Let us ask ourselves, if North 
Korea poses such a threat to South Korea, why have the South Koreans allowed 
the share of their gross national product allotted to defense to decline 22% in 
the last few years? In fact, South Korea spends a smaller share of its GNP for 
defense than we do. We have repeatedly urged South Korea to buy more military 
equipment, preferably from us, but Seoul has resisted. 
</P>
<P>
It would certainly be unwise for the United States to sever its security 
commitment to South Korea totally. But it would be just as unwise to pretend 
that nothing has changed in 25 years. South Korea has a burgeoning economy and 
a $10-billion trade surplus against the United States. If the Koreans can't 
shoulder more of the burden of their own defense now, do we really have to wait 
until the year 2006, when South Korea's economy will be about 15 times larger 
than North Korea's? Can we act only with South Korea's acquiescence? If the 
answer is yes, then aren't we being held hostage? 
</P>
<P>
Apparently the Pentagon, despite the Administration's rhetoric, agrees that it 
is time to rethink our policy. According to recent press reports, the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff are already preparing plans for the possibility of withdrawing 
all U.S. troops by 1995. They know what a recent Pentagon report states; that 
in South Korea, "the role of U.S. air and naval elements is likely to be more 
critical" than our ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
Removing 10,000 Army troops by 1992, as I have proposed, would still leave two 
Air Force wings and all current Air Force personnel in place, as well as 
two-thirds of our current Army presence of about 31,000 soldiers. This 
remaining force would be a strong symbol of commitment to South Korea's 
security. Only Germany and Japan would have more U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
Our large troop presence in South Korea is a political liability for us in 
several ways. Our presence is inevitably a lightning rod for South Korean 
protest groups, as the most recent demonstrations show. We have become a 
whipping boy for every social and political ailment in South Korea, real or 
imagined. 
</P>
<P>
We do not want to be a catalyst for every Korean dissident. Our policy must 
recognize that South Korea's political center of gravity is to the left of Roh, 
who only narrowly won in 1987 against two left-wing opponents, who together 
received far more votes. 
</P>
<P>
We now have the opportunity to take control of events, rather than let them 
control us. A 25% reduction in U.S. troops in South Korea could save us more 
than $500 million annually and reduce anti-U.S. sentiment while still 
preserving important military capabilities. Let's not wait until 2006 to take 
this sensible step.

IS THERE SUBSTANCE BEHIND DE KLERK'S PR MOVES?;

SOUTH AFRICA: MANY ANTI-APARTHEID LEADERS REMAIN IN PRISON, GAGGED AND EXILED. 
APARTHEID LIVES -- OFF CAMERA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By ROSE MOSS, Rose Moss is editing Through the Fire, the trial transcript of

Lekota.

<TEXT>
<P>
South Africa, in a period of unprecedented acts, faces great danger and great 
promise. Since the day Parliament opened, the new president, Frederick W. de 
Klerk, has suspended key laws. At a march in Cape Town to protest the police 
terrorism that marked recent elections, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, leading the 
huge crowd arm-in-arm with the mayor of Cape Town, said, "We have won a great 
victory for justice and peace." 
</P>
<P>
The police were leashed. And for the first time in the history of South Africa 
the head of state was doing what the majority told him. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the country, in cities and in small villages, other peaceful marches 
followed. At one, the police gave flowers to demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps De Klerk has suffered an overnight conversion. Perhaps he is trying to 
wipe out election pictures of police whipping civilians, of a mother weeping 
for her baby, shot at point-blank range. For months, the international 
community has warned that ostracism and economic decline will persist unless 
South Africa breaks the cycle of violence. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk has a better TV image now. In another first for the country, he met 
face-to-face with church leaders who speak for the majority and won pictures of 
himself with Tutu and the Revs. Allan Boesak and Frank Chikane. He then 
released a handful of distinguished, aged prisoners and called Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher immediately to say she has what she needs to resist sanctions 
at this week's British Commonwealth conference. 
</P>
<P>
There may be some substance behind the public relations. Members of the 
Afrikaner Establishment are talking with the imprisoned Nelson Mandela and 
other leaders of the African National Congress. What more can the world want? 
</P>
<P>
What more can the churchmen want? De Klerk sounds plaintively surprised that 
the churchmen expressed distrust. Hasn't he shown his good intentions? 
</P>
<P>
They have said what they want. Justice and peace. No substitutes. Perhaps he 
finds these demands extreme. Revolutionary. Perhaps he is taking the first 
steps. He offered vague promises. 
</P>
<P>
The churchmen are wary, and with good reason. The last few weeks have suggested 
a new course in South Africa's history. They show that the minority government 
cannot silence the majority and has had to restrain the key resource of 
illegitimate rule, brute force. International opinion will not support more 
visible repression. Internally, a police officer broke ranks on election night 
to protest fellow police acting like wild dogs. Hundreds of men refused service 
in the apartheid army. These events suggest historic turning points, such as 
the opening of the Bastille, the Allied landing in Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
After such turning points, events move quickly. De Klerk seems to hope they 
will move slowly and that he will control the timetable. He may not be able to. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the daily practice of apartheid has been eroding. Integration is 
breaking out all over, in schools, universities, residential areas, work. White 
and black have been fraternizing. And the intransigent ruling minority is 
fragmenting. 
</P>
<P>
Where will De Klerk turn? South Africa has a lavish tradition of government 
treachery and duplicity, of smiling words and cruel actions. During the last 
decade, while proclaiming that apartheid is dead and promising reform, the 
government has used ever more guns, whips, prisons, nooses. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking English, De Klerk promises, smiling at the cameras, that in five years 
or so, there will be equal rights for each racial group, sort of. He can't 
really promise equal rights for individuals. Speaking Afrikaans, he reassures 
his internal constituency that there's nothing to be afraid of, really. 
</P>
<P>
But Tutu and other South Africans understand Afrikaans. They know that many 
anti-apartheid leaders remain in prison, gagged and exiled. Apartheid lives -- 
off camera. 
</P>
<P>
Some will give De Klerk a few months to show what his promises mean. If he 
balks at real change, there will be renewed violence. Apartheid cannot be 
maintained with white gloves and smiles. 
</P>
<P>
Even if he is sincere, the course ahead is fraught with danger. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa has created people, black as well as white, with vested interests 
in apartheid. For the bureaucracy, the "independent" homelands, the military 
and the police, apartheid means security, jobs, status. Some will rally to save 
the old order. They have implacable supporters who would rather die than yield. 
Would rather kill than negotiate. They are armed, dangerous and undisciplined. 
They will add to the hazards of the difficult transition that must be made. 
</P>
<P>
Those demanding a new order may also prove dangerous. Apartheid has created 
millions of embittered, impoverished and reckless people unwilling to wait and 
suffer. It has kept them in ignorance, and they are impatient. 
</P>
<P>
If peaceful protest has no effect, they may resort to other ways to take 
rights, restitution or revenge. The reign of love and flowers may give way to a 
reign of terror. This is what peaceful leaders in South Africa seek to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
They need support in maintaining peace. They need the skills of respected 
leaders now in prison. They need visible results to make the great victory for 
justice and peace a victory that lasts. They need the international community 
to understand that substitutes will not suffice.

SUPPLY LINES NEEDED FOR THE BIG ONE; 
</P>
<P>
PREPAREDNESS: EMERGENCY PLANS PAY TOO LITTLE ATTENTION TO ARRANGING THE FLOW OF 
ESSENTIAL MATERIALS FOR USE IF LOCAL SOURCES ARE DESTROYED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD M. WALDEN, Richard M. Walden is president of Operation 
California/USA, a Los Angeles-based international relief agency. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
October is earthquake preparedness month in Los Angeles. Each year, the media, 
the mayor and the schools make ritualistic appeals to the general public to 
think about preparing for the huge quake that experts say is inevitable on the 
southern San Andreas Fault. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these and other warnings, Los Angeles is tragically unprepared for the 
Big One. 
</P>
<P>
A recent reading of the state's emergency earthquake preparedness plan for 
Southern California shows detailed outlines for assumption of authority by 
different governmental units. Police, fire, public health and shelter 
information are readily available. What is lacking is any idea where vitally 
needed supplies might come from if local sources are destroyed or disabled. 
Location of suppliers is assumed to be the responsibility of the state's 
procurement authorities; no stockpiles of essential materials held in private 
hands are suggested. 
</P>
<P>
In light of our experience with earthquakes in Mexico City, San Salvador and 
Soviet Armenia, this is asking for trouble and needless delays. 
</P>
<P>
When an aroused and sympathetic public responds to press reports of 
disaster-related shortages, cupboards and medicine chests are cleaned out and 
the relief pipeline is clogged with unnecessary and unrequested aid from 
well-meaning people. Jamaica's recovery from Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 and 
Armenia's still struggling recovery effort were greatly impeded by such "aid." 
</P>
<P>
It would be far wiser for government and the private sector to better 
coordinate their advance planning efforts in the following ways: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Companies should evaluate their goods and services to see whether they 
might be of use in an earthquake recovery effort. They should also know what 
capacity they have for supplying surplus goods at any one time and what amount 
of such goods and services could be donated or made available immediately at 
reduced rates. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Companies should ensure that local disaster authorities are made aware of 
their capacity to supply essential goods and services. Heavy equipment such as 
cranes; mechanics, water and energy-related supplies and emergency food, 
shelter and medical aid should have the highest priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Individual workers at these companies should consult with management, 
unions and fellow workers to ensure that both the company and local authorities 
are plugged into the same game plan for the benefit of the entire community. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Government officials charged with disaster preparedness responsibilities 
should make it their top priority to ascertain which goods and services are 
available locally in the event of a disaster. Then they should solicit 
companies that have not otherwise informed them to see what they are willing to 
donate or provide, at cost, to disaster relief efforts. Trade organizations in 
various key sectors are a quick and efficient way for public officials to gain 
access to whole industries. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Government officials should contact nongovernmental organizations with wide 
experience in disaster relief internation- ally. There are over 100 U.S.-based 
international relief groups ready to help. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Computerized data bases should be developed, listing privately available 
sources of essential supplies. These lists should be made available to all 
players in a disaster scenario, along with emergency communications equipment 
(at both ends) to ensure that materials can be ordered to disaster sites 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 -- News media should be given full partnership with government and business in 
the planning and response phases of a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The politics of the budget process in Sacramento and Washington also play a 
great role in disaster preparedness and response. It was a well-kept secret in 
relief circles that the federal government's response to the Hurricane Hugo 
disaster in mid-September was greatly impeded because the Federal Emergency 
Management Administration and the State Department's Office of Foreign Disaster 
Assistance) were all but broke in the last two weeks of the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the newly replenished federal budget, FEMA is playing a leading and 
helpful role in providing financial resources to allow the Bay Area to recover 
from Tuesday's destruction. 
</P>
<P>
What is problematic is the relative lack of resources that the Deukmejian 
Administration has allocated to the state's Office of Emergency Services. It 
will take hundreds of millions of dollars to repair key road links in San 
Francisco and Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, it is obvious that we will have to rely on locally available talent 
and resources to plan for coping with a major quake. This will happen only if 
business joins with government and the nonprofit sector in making realistic 
assessments of our community's material needs after such a catastrophe.

TV-RADIO: MICHAELS DOES IT ALL, INCLUDING NEWS 
</P>

<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Al Michaels is incredible. What else can you say? 
</P>
<P>
As a baseball announcer, he ranks among the top two or three in the country. 
There are Michaels and Vin Scully, not necessarily in that order, and some 
people might include Bob Costas in that group. 
</P>
<P>
Michaels also has the most prestigious broadcasting job in football, as 
play-by-play announcer of "Monday Night Football." 
</P>
<P>
And Michaels is more than proficient at basketball, boxing or any other sport 
he's asked to announce. 
</P>
<P>
Hockey, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
He probably is best known for his work on the U.S. Olympic team's victory over 
the Soviet Union in 1980. "Do you believe in miracles?" is a call that ranks up 
there with Russ Hodges' "The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the 
pennant!" in 1951 and Scully's "We go to Chicago!" in 1959 as the most 
memorable in sportscasting lore. 
</P>
<P>
Michaels' best performance, however, probably came in Game 5 of the American 
League playoffs in 1986, when the Boston Red Sox, trailing, 5-2, in the ninth 
inning, beat the Angels, 7-6, in 11 innings. Michaels made an incredibly 
dramatic game even more dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
Now Michaels has shown his skills as a newsman, stepping in to do live reports 
for ABC News on the Bay Area earthquake. His work has drawn praise from 
colleagues Ted Koppel and Peter Jennings, and from television critics 
throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a wild decade for me," he said from his hotel room in San Francisco 
Thursday. "It began with the hockey game, and now this. 
</P>
<P>
"But there's no comparison between the two events. The U.S. Olympic team's 
victory over the Soviets was wonderful and thrilling, one of the brightest 
moments in American sports. This has been a heartbreak, a horrible moment, one 
of the darkest chapters in contemporary American history." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Michaels' work this week as a newsman may be his crowning achievement, 
his tour de force. "I've simply done what I'm trained to do, what I've had to 
do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It all began a little after ABC went on the air to broadcast Game 3 of the 
World Series from Candlestick Park Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Right before we went on the air I noticed an eerie quiet," Michaels said. "It 
was strange." 
</P>
<P>
The quake struck at 5:04 as partner Tim McCarver was narrating some highlights 
from Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
Michaels said he has never experienced such fright. "I thought the deck above 
us was coming down," he said. "Tim and I had our backs to the field at the 
time, and I felt myself sliding backward. 
</P>
<P>
"Tim says I grabbed his left knee. Maybe I did. I don't think so, but I can't 
remember what I did." 
</P>
<P>
Michaels blurted out, "We're having an earthquake" just as ABC lost its power 
and went off the air. 
</P>
<P>
The network went to its generators, and Michaels, McCarver and Jim Palmer were 
back on the air briefly. Michaels made a crack about the telecast beginning 
with a bang, but he was just trying to maintain his composure and didn't 
realize the severity of the earthquake at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Michaels later joined Koppel for live reports until midnight. He was told he'd 
be back on the air from Candlestick at 3 a.m., when "World News This Morning" 
was scheduled to begin on the East Coast, where it would be 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed a shave, so I decided to drive back to the hotel," Michaels said. "I 
also wanted to check out the area." 
</P>
<P>
The roads were empty by then, so Michaels only had to deal with closures and 
detours. 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't get up to his room, but a member of the ABC crew at Candlestick had 
given Michaels a razor and a producer somehow came up with some shaving cream. 
He shaved in a bathroom at his hotel. Then it was back to Candlestick. 
</P>
<P>
As of Thursday afternoon, the elevators at Michaels' hotel still weren't 
working, although the power went back on at 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
His room is on the 13th floor -- yes, this hotel has a 13th floor -- and he has 
made the trek up and down the stairs six times, he said. One of those trips 
wasn't necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"At my hotel, which goes to the top of my Hotel Hall of Fame list because of 
the way everything has been handled, people on the top floor have been given a 
second room on a lower floor so they don't have to always climb so many stairs. 
We (Michaels and his wife, Linda) also have a room on the second floor. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, the problem with the second floor is there's too much noise for me to 
sleep. So last night, Linda was going to sleep on the second floor and I was 
going to sleep on the 13th. One problem, though. When I got to the 13th floor, 
I discovered I forgot my key. 
</P>
<P>
"I went down to Linda's room and decided to sleep there. I didn't want to make 
that climb again." 
</P>
<P>
ABC had a technical advantage in covering the quake Tuesday night since it had 
equipment, including the Goodyear blimp, in San Francisco for the World Series, 
along with a crew of about 70 people. So the network should have done a good 
job, and it did. 
</P>
<P>
But ESPN, the all-sports network, was the first with live shots of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN had the advantage of going strictly with generator power in the first 
place. The network wasn't hooked into the power system at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
What ESPN needed was additional satellite time, since it wasn't scheduled to be 
on the air from Candlestick until after the game. The network got approval for 
the additional time by 5:15, and Bob Ley was on the air at 5:23 with a live 
report. ESPN had blimp shots of the collapsed portions of the Bay Bridge and 
Nimitz Freeway by 5:29, long before anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
ABC let ESPN use the blimp camera since ESPN had earlier offered to help ABC. 
ABC in turn used Ley's earlier reports. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN's rating went from a one to more than a four within a 20-minute span as 
viewers, apparently flipping dials, discovered the cable network's coverage. 
For Ley, as well as Chris Berman and Chris Myers, along with producer John 
Hamlin, it was a job well done. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
Of the ABC crew of about 70 in San Francisco for the World Series, most went 
home Thursday. The announcers and producer Curt Gowdy Jr. and director Craig 
Janoff, were among the few who stayed. Most of those who left will return 
Sunday, but not all. "We've tried to take care of the needs of our crew," 
Janoff said. "Some had vacations planned next week since we thought we'd be 
through with baseball. All our guys have done such a good job for us, we felt 
we had to be accommodating. We'll have a couple of different cameramen next 
week. But that's OK. This earthquake has helped show us where our priorities 
should be. There are things more important than baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Burks, the CBS producer scheduled to work Saturday's USC-Notre Dame 
game, owns a home in the Marina District of San Francisco, one of the areas hit 
hardest by the quake. He was given the week off. Ric La Civita will take his 
place. . . . La Civita, by the way, has an unpleasant memory of the USC-Notre 
Dame rivalry. He was working the 1986 game when CBS missed a last-second field 
goal that gave the Irish a dramatic 38-36 victory. The network was away for a 
commercial at the time, and La Civita took most of the heat for it. 
</P>
<P>
Kudos to King announcers Bob Miller, Nick Nickson and Randy Hahn for the job 
they did last Sunday on Wayne Gretzky's record-breaking night. Miller is in Al 
Michaels' class when it comes to making a dramatic situation even more 
dramatic. . . . Another example of Gretzky's effect on the Kings' popularity is 
that this season the team, for the first time, has a radio network, with six 
California stations -- in Blythe, El Centro, Lompoc, Palm Desert, Paso Robles 
and Santa Barbara -- and three stations outside California -- in Houston, 
Phoenix and Las Vegas.

Roger Maltbie, relieved to learn his relatives and his home in Los Gatos 
survived Tuesday's earthquake, shot a personal-best nine-under-par 63 Thursday 
for the lowest score of the second round of the 72-hole Disney tournament being 
played on three different courses. 
</P>
<P>
Maltbie's 10-under-par 134 total was good for a share of the lead until late in 
the day, when Tim Simpson shot a 67 for a two-stroke lead. Dave Rummells, who 
had a second-round 68, and Ted Schulz, with a 69, were tied with Maltbie.

OILERS EXPECTED TO TRADE CARSON WITHIN A WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Edmonton Oilers are not going to let Jimmy Carson sit home in Redondo Beach 
for long. General Manager Glen Sather is considering several offers for the 
high-scoring, 21-year-old center, and is expected to trade him within a week. 
</P>
<P>
When goalie Grant Fuhr "retired" from hockey last summer, the Oilers simply sat 
back and waited for him to unretire, which he did before the start of training 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
When Paul Coffey held out at the start of the 1987 season, the Oilers let him 
sit until the end of November, then dealt him to Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
But when Carson quit the team last Saturday, the Oilers started taking bids. 
There obviously was going to be no reconciliation between the Oilers and 
Carson, who wants to play in the United States, and he's much too valuable a 
commodity to waste. 
</P>
<P>
Until the Oilers make a deal, though, their roster has a gaping hole where once 
there was Wayne Gretzky. Carson, the young talent sent to the Oilers as the 
main on-ice compensation for Gretzky, scored 100 points -- 49 goals, 51 assists 
-- for the Oilers last season. 
</P>
<P>
To lose Gretzky for Carson was bad enough. 
</P>
<P>
So there will be a deal made soon. But don't expect Carson to be back with the 
Kings. Just about every other U.S. team has been mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
New King teammate Larry Robinson on Wayne Gretzky: "He doesn't wear that number 
for nothing. That's about the percentage of plays that he is going to execute." 
</P>
<P>
Boston Coach Mike Milbury on shutting out Gretzky at the Forum for the first 
time since Gretzky became a King: 
</P>
<P>
"If I were him, after the week he just went through, I would have been in a 
fog. He had some flashes and good chances. I don't know how the guy does it. 
He's a marvel to me. If you one time deny him any points in the game, you've 
got to feel really proud of yourself. It's a tribute to him that he gets other 
teams up just to play against him. That's a tremendous tribute to a guy." 
</P>
<P>
Compuware Corp. of Detroit wants to buy an NHL team and has inquired about the 
Oilers. According to Compuware's hockey director, Jim Rutherford, Oiler owner 
Peter Pocklington, "didn't say yes . . . didn't say no." 
</P>
<P>
So, Rutherford concludes, "I guess there's always a chance." 
</P>
<P>
When is a tie worse than kissing your sister? When your "rebuilding" team is 
about to pull the upset of the young season, when you're leading the defending 
Stanley Cup champions by five goals with less than four minutes left in front 
of your home fans. Then a tie is sickening. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope I never see another game like that," Quebec's Peter Stastny said after 
Calgary scored three goals in a 27-second span and then added two more -- two 
short-handed goals -- just four seconds apart to come up with the 8-8 tie on 
the Nordiques' ice. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec Coach Michel Bergeron, who knew he had his work cut out for him when he 
took this job after being fired by the Rangers at the end of last season, said: 
"I knew things would be hard this year because of all the changes we've made, 
but this is hard to stomach. There was general panic out there. It's a real 
shock. This is worse than a loss for sure." 
</P>
<P>
Even though he said he had "closed the book" on Bob Probert when he was 
arrested last March for smuggling cocaine into the United States, Detroit Coach 
Jacques Demers showed up in court Tuesday to speak as a character witness 
before Probert was sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit President Mike Illitch and General Manager Jim Devellano also appeared 
on Probert's behalf, and eight Red Wing players were in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Patrick Duggan sentenced Probert, a Canadian, to three 
months in prison and fined him $2,000. Also taken into consideration was 
Probert's agreement to plead guilty to the charge, which carries a maximum 
penalty of 20 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
A Canadian attorney for Probert, Maria Carroccia, said that there would be a 
hearing with the NHL on whether Probert will be allowed to play hockey again, 
but that hearing will not be held until after a deportation hearing Oct. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Probert has been in the United States since his arrest last March, undergoing 
substance abuse treatment at the Holly Gardens clinic. He has said that he will 
continue his treatment for alcohol abuse while in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Hockey Notes 
</P>
<P>
Alan Eagleson, head of the NHL players' association, reports that the average 
NHL salary is $200,000, boosted by $4,000 by the million-dollar contracts 
signed by Pittsburgh's Mario Lemieux and Detroit's Steve Yzerman. . . . 
Minnesota was the last unbeaten team in the league before losing at Detroit 
Thursday. The North Stars' surprising 5-1-1 start is their best in seven 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal defenseman Chris Chelios, the first American captain of the Canadiens 
since 1909, has hired a tutor to teach him French. He said he thinks he owes it 
to the people." . . . Paul Coffey assisted on all of Pittsburgh's goals in a 
9-3 loss at St. Louis Wednesday, increasing his total to 601 assists. He is the 
sixth defenseman in the NHL to reach 600. 
</P>
<P>
Word from France is that Bob Gainey, who retired from the Montreal Canadiens to 
become a player-coach, has not only played and coached but has also driven the 
Zamboni between periods. . . . Pittsburgh center John Cullen will be out for at 
least two weeks with Type A infectious hepatitis. Team officials who have been 
in contact with him recently and all of his teammates have been offered gamma 
globulin shots to ward off the infection. 
</P>
<P>
At Montreal Wednesday night, a fan in a Montreal sweater jumped onto the ice 
and used a small, souvenir stick to knock a puck into the Calgary net, another 
fan came onto the ice with a banner and two more lowered themselves from the 
rafters on ropes, holding a banner to promote CKMF, a radio station that was 
offering a $25,000 prize for the best stunt. After Montreal won the game, 2-1, 
Chelios said: "Now that we have won, it was funny. If we'd lost, I don't know 
how funny it would have been." And Calgary's Sergei Makarov said: "In the 
Soviet Union, the home team would have been penalized two minutes."

FLYING CONTINENTAL HOLDS OFF NO MARKER FOR OAK TREE VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Flying Continental, owned by Jack Kent Cooke, got a battle from No Marker 
through the stretch but prevailed by a neck in Thursday's $60,000 feature race 
of the Oak Tree meeting at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
The top two finishers ran in tandem throughout the 1 1/16-mile race, sitting 
just off the early pace of Mi Preferido and Prove Splendid. 
</P>
<P>
Flying Continental and No Marker moved together to take the lead at the top of 
the stretch and raced head-to-head from there. 
</P>
<P>
Flying Continental, ridden by Chris McCarron and trained by Jay Robbins, was 
clocked in 1:41 4/5 and returned $5.80, $2.80 and $2.40. No Marker paid $4.40 
and $3.20. 
</P>
<P>
Gaucho Alerta, who trailed the field by 12 lengths on the backstretch, finished 
strongly to take third as the pacesetters faded in the final quarter-mile. 
Gaucho Alerta paid $3.60. 
</P>
<P>
It was Flying Continental's first victory since the Santa Catalina Stakes at 
Santa Anita in February.

GOLDEN LEAGUE AWARDS SAUGUS FORFEIT VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Golden League administrators have awarded Saugus High a 2-0 forfeit victory 
after its football game against Palmdale last Friday night was suspended after 
a Palmdale player attacked a game official. 
</P>
<P>
Principals and athletic directors of the six-team league met for six hours 
Thursday at Quartz Hill High before reaching a consensus. Saugus Principal Mike 
von Buelow and Coach Dick Flaherty had contended that Saugus should be awarded 
the victory in the league opener at College of the Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
"We were looking for a fair and equitable decision," von Buelow said. "We 
didn't come across any real precedent that was close to this. It was just a 
matter of what would be the best thing to make sure this would never happen 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Von Buelow said that the league will release a statement today listing 
sanctions against those parties involved but declined to be specific. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale Principal Linda Janzen could not be reached for comment. Von Buelow, 
however, said that Palmdale officials were "extremely cooperative and helpful 
in making the decision." 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale Coach Kent Bothwell, who was not present at the meeting, said that he 
was not happy with the decision and declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Flaherty, who has said that his team was not at fault and should therefore be 
awarded the win, said he was pleased that the league awarded his team a 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way it should have been," Flaherty said. "Regardless of what the 
score was, an opportunity to finish the game was denied both teams. The team 
that was at fault was not us. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was a football coach and we were involved in the negative part of that, I 
would demand that we forfeit." 
</P>
<P>
Von Buelow said that he had mixed feelings. "I am (pleased) and I'm not," he 
said. "It is a difficult thing to have to go through. But if this helps in this 
not happening again, then I'm delighted." 
</P>
<P>
After three personal-foul penalties midway through the fourth quarter, the last 
two because of remarks directed from the Palmdale bench toward officials, 
Palmdale senior Darius Wilson grabbed back judge Brad Woolley and threw him to 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale's bench and bleachers cleared and Wilson later was arrested in the 
locker room by L. A. County Sheriff's deputies. Wilson, 18, has been suspended 
from school and could face misdemeanor battery charges, according to the 
Newhall district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Woolley, 31, who suffered a bruised back and shoulders, has said that he will 
consider filing civil charges against Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale had outgained Saugus, 220 yards to 30, but had not penetrated the 
Centurions' 20-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale had been charged with eight penalties -- including five personal fouls 
-- for 100 yards. Saugus was penalized 54 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The victory puts Saugus (4-2, 1-0 in league play) in a first-place tie with 
Canyon (2-3-1) and Quartz Hill (3-3). Palmdale is 1-5, 0-1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND A scoreless Golden League football game between Palmdale and Saugus 
highs Friday at College of the Canyons was suspended midway through the fourth 
quarter after a Palmdale player attacked an official. Darius Wilson was 
arrested by sheriff's deputies and has been suspended from school. He could 
face misdemeanor battery charges. The game's outcome was unresolved until 
Thursday's league meeting.

FALLACY OF THE FORTY; 
</P>
<P>
PURPORTED 40-YARD CLOCKINGS OF PLAYERS FAIL TO ACCOUNT FOR REACTION TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Canyon High football Coach Harry Welch refers to them as "Liars Poker." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy High mentor Bob Francola says they are important barometers in the 
evaluation of a player's capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever your opinion, 40-yard dash times have become among the most vital 
statistics in football, be it at the high school, collegiate or professional 
level. 
</P>
<P>
The 40 is oftentimes a major determinant in how highly recruited a player is 
coming out of high school or how high he goes in the National Football League 
draft out of college. 
</P>
<P>
But what exactly do the times mean? For years, track and field purists have 
scoffed at the reputed 40-yard times of football players, and with good reason. 
</P>
<P>
After all, according to these times, there are several players in the NFL who 
could blow away Canadian Ben Johnson -- steroids and all -- in the 40. 
</P>
<P>
This is the same Ben Johnson who is considered by most track experts to be the 
fastest starter in history. The same Ben Johnson who set a world record of 9.83 
seconds in the 100 meters in the 1987 World Championships in Rome, and the same 
Ben Johnson who lowered that mark to 9.79 in last year's Olympic Games in Seoul 
before being stripped of the record and his gold medal after testing positive 
for steroids. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Jackson (4.18 seconds) of the Los Angeles Raiders and Deion Sanders (4.25) 
of the Atlanta Falcons are just two NFL players who could outrun Johnson based 
on their 40 times. 
</P>
<P>
There are even a handful of high school players in the Valley who could give 
Big Ben a run for his money if their times are correct. Players such as Jerome 
Casey, Tobaise Brookins and Girmar Johnson of Sylmar, all of whom sport 40 
times of 4.35, according to Spartan Coach Jeff Engilman. 
</P>
<P>
If you're looking for more phantom speed, try Green Bay Packer offensive tackle 
Tony Mandarich, all 6-foot-6, 315 pounds of him, who has reportedly run 4.65. 
</P>
<P>
The aforementioned players' times are even more startling because they came 
without the aid of starting blocks and were run on football fields -- a slower 
surface than the synthetic tracks on which Johnson runs. 
</P>
<P>
During Johnson's world-record 100 in Rome, he was clocked in 4.67 at 40 meters, 
which converts to 4.28 at 40 yards, one-tenth of a second slower than Jackson's 
reported time. And Carl Lewis doesn't even belong on the same track as Jackson: 
His 40-meter time of 4.78 converts to 4.39 at 40 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Bo may know track but not that well. 
</P>
<P>
So what do 40 times measure? 
</P>
<P>
They measure the ability to run 40 yards after the runner has reacted to a 
starting gun or command. And after the timer has reacted to the runner's 
reaction. In other words, when a coach times a player in the 40, he or she 
waits for the player to react before starting the stopwatch, then stops it when 
the player crosses the 40-yard mark. 
</P>
<P>
Those procedures alone can produce a time that is about a half-second faster 
than if the player was timed in the manner employed at major track meets. 
</P>
<P>
Studies have shown that it takes humans an average of .24 seconds to react to a 
starter's gun, and that average also holds true for the timer holding a 
stopwatch. 
</P>
<P>
Based on these figures, an athlete's 40-yard time is actually .48 seconds 
faster than what he ran. 
</P>
<P>
Half of the .48 figure is the time it takes the athlete to react to the 
starting command, and the other half is the time it takes a timer to start a 
stopwatch. 
</P>
<P>
Also, none of the reported times can accurately be measured in hundredths of a 
second. Only fully automatic times can be recorded in this manner. These are 
times whereby a clock is electronically started by a starter's pistol and 
automatically stopped when the runner's torso breaks a beam of light at the end 
of a race. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, Jackson and Sanders are not your average humans, but Bo's hand-timed 
4.18 is more like a fully automatic 4.58 or 4.63 and Neon Deion's 4.25 is 
probably equivalent to a 4.65 or 4.70. 
</P>
<P>
Their times are still fast but no longer phenomenal. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the "standardized" procedures for timing a football 40, coaches still 
disagree about the validity of times. Montclair Prep Coach George Giannini 
agrees with Welch, saying that "they're real arbitrary." 
</P>
<P>
Welch's opinion is based on the abundance of high school players with reported 
4.3 and 4.4 speed. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never timed a kid faster than 4.55 . . . yet I constantly hear that this 
kid has run 4.4 and this kid has run 4.35. I guess it's possible, but I've 
never had one of those kids," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to legitimize 40 times at Montclair Prep, Giannini clocks his 
players five times and takes the average of those clockings. 
</P>
<P>
Based on this method, Michael Jones, Derek Sparks and Leland Sparks all ran 
4.5. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all legitimate 4.5 sprinters," Giannini said. "Those times are valid." 
</P>
<P>
Still, under fully automatic timing, they would be hard-pressed to break 5.0. 
</P>
<P>
Francola admitted that there are some innate discrepancies in 40 times, but 
that doesn't eliminate their importance. 
</P>
<P>
"The 40 is as important as any of the parameters we use in measuring a player's 
ability," he said. "The players are very conscious about their times and so are 
we. Speed is important. Speed is something that you cannot coach." 
</P>
<P>
Francola, who claims that he has two 4.44 sprinters in Ontiwaun Carter and 
Vince Solomon, pointed out that blazing speed on a straight line doesn't always 
translate into a breakaway threat at running back. "Vince has 4.4 speed, but he 
can't cut like Ontiwaun can," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's San Fernando's Michael Wynn, one of the top-ranked high school 
quarterbacks in the nation, who has a listed 40 time of 4.6. He has never 
actually run that fast. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason they say 4.6 is because I haven't been timed since my sophomore 
season and that's when I ran 4.7," Wynn said. "But they say I've gotten faster 
since then. The 4.6 is an estimation." 
</P>
<P>
So the next time you're watching a football game and the announcer says a 
player built like a gorilla can run like a gazelle, remember it is a sign of 
the times.

WOULD-BE OWNERS CONTINUE TO CALL ABOUT THE PADRES

Negotiations quietly continued Thursday in the search for a new Padre owner, 
but while sources said one group has advanced further than others in the 
discussions, all options are being kept open. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Jerry Kapstein, negotiating the sale for Joan Kroc, received new 
inquiries at his La Jolla office from prospective buyers but would not reveal 
their identities. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Buss, principal owner of the Lakers, says he is interested in purchasing 
the Padres, but since he has yet to schedule a single meeting with Kapstein, 
some wonder how realistic his chances are. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of people who would be interested to see Buss try to jump into 
the bidding because it would come out just how much he's worth," said a former 
business associate of Buss. "There's a lot of doubts whether he has that kind 
of money. He might be able to get enough people involved to come with that kind 
of money, but I don't think there's any way he has $100 million sitting 
around." 
</P>
<P>
Said Buss: "It would be inappropriate for me to comment on anything now because 
I don't have a meeting scheduled." 
</P>
<P>
Kapstein and partner Bob Teaff also refused comment. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 26 major league baseball franchises, there are just eight besides the 
Padres owned by a single person or family: the Dodgers, Angels, San Francisco 
Giants, Oakland Athletics, Minnesota Twins, Detroit Tigers, Cleveland Indians 
and St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be very surprised if the Padre sale doesn't come together very fast," said 
Mannie Jackson, who heads a group that is trying to bring an NBA franchise to 
San Diego but is uninterested in the Padres. "You're talking about a lot of 
visibility owning that team." 
</P>
<P>
John Lynch, chief executive of the Noble Broadcast Group that owns XTRA in San 
Diego, said that he very well could be interested in purchasing the franchise 
for the anticipated price of about $100 million, with one condition. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd have to get the broadcast rights to go with it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His group outbid the competition this year for the rights to broadcast the 
Padres but was nonetheless rejected in favor of KFMB. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to explore it a little bit," Lynch said. "But if we can't get the 
broadcast rights to go with it, I don't know what the point would be."

POINTERS' WHITE TO TEST MIRA MESA DEFENSE 
</P>

<P>
Point Loma High School quarterback Danny White, the county's leading passer, is 
good enough as it is. So the last thing Ed Shoen wants to do is give him reason 
to get any better. 
</P>
<P>
Shoen is Mira Mesa's defensive coordinator. His defense, which ranks second in 
the county (giving up an average of 5.7 points in six games) will take a 
midterm exam of sorts tonight at 7 when it attempts to find a way to slow Point 
Loma's passing in a City Eastern game at Mira Mesa High School. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa (5-1, 1-0) certainly is capable of stopping a top offense, as it 
proved when it held third-ranked Chula Vista to 14 points four weeks ago. Free 
safety Steve Hamaguchi, the county weight-lifting champion, is among the 
hardest hitting defensive backs around. Two quick cornerbacks -- Beau Champoux 
and Keith Wallace -- flank Hamaguchi. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Shoen won't bite when asked if this defense is capable of shutting down 
White. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, gosh," he said. "I don't know if we can expect that. I don't want anything 
that can go on any of their bulletin boards." 
</P>
<P>
The plan is this: 
</P>
<P>
"The best pass defense," Shoen said, "is if the quarterback is on his back. No 
one has had great success doing that (to White)." 
</P>
<P>
White has completed 78 of 133 passes for 1,351 yards and 11 touchdowns. He 
can't take all the credit -- his primary receivers, Brett Callan (31 
receptions, 620 yards) and J.J. Stokes (31, 564), rank second and third in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
The thing that has to frighten Mira Mesa is that Point Loma (3-3, 1-0) can also 
run. 
</P>
<P>
"Our running attack hasn't been bad," Point Loma Coach Bennie Edens said. 
"We've been getting better each week." 
</P>
<P>
This, despite losing starter Kevin Perreira to an ankle injury in a 36-34 
victory over Dorsey. Marlon Manassa and Jose Ugarte have filled in adequately, 
and Edens expects Perreira to return before the conclusion of the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been able to score on everybody," Edens said. "So I think we'll be able 
to put some points on the board." 
</P>
<P>
Another thing likely to be floating some anxiety in Mira Mesa's direction is 
that Point Loma's defense shut out Serra last week. In five previous games, the 
Pointers' weakness had been their defense, allowing a 32.8-point average. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, this has been a good match-up. Through the past six meetings, 
the teams stand even at 3-3. Both coaches will be quick to admit that Mira Mesa 
and Point Loma don't like each other, adding extra spice to an interesting 
game.

CIPHER DATA TO LAY OFF 525 WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Battered by a dramatic drop-off in demand for its computer data storage 
devices, Cipher Data Products on Thursday announced plans to lay off 525 
workers -- 24% of its work force. 
</P>
<P>
The company also reported a $14.2-million loss for its first quarter, which 
ended Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Among the jobs eliminated was that of Cipher Data's president, Edward L. 
Marinaro, who resigned effective Thursday. Marinaro's duties will be assumed by 
Cipher Data Chairman and Chief Executive Gary Liebl, who declined to discuss 
financial aspects of Marinaro's severance agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Cipher Data is a leading manufacturer of computer tape drives used as data 
storage devices in high-powered computer systems, such as minicomputers and 
small mainframes. As more businesses turn to desktop computers and 
workstations, demand for Cipher Data's devices has dropped sharply. 
</P>
<P>
"We have seen this coming for the last year or so, but we didn't expect it to 
manifest itself so quickly," Liebl said. 
</P>
<P>
Total sales of half-inch, reel-to-reel tape drives -- Cipher Data's 
bread-and-butter product -- will shrink to 128,000 units this year from 144,000 
units sold in 1988, according to Freeman Associates of Santa Barbara. By 1993, 
unit sales will fall to 57,000, Freeman Vice President Bob Abraham said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the most recent year for which figures are available, Cipher's share 
of the half-inch, reel-to-reel tape drive market was 32%, Abraham said. 
</P>
<P>
Marinaro joined Cipher Data in August, 1988, from Western Digital in Irvine, 
Liebl said. "Ed and I collaborated on the decision (to resign), we jointly 
agreed on it, and he tendered his resignation accordingly," Liebl said. 
</P>
<P>
The job cuts will include 200 at Cipher Data's San Diego headquarters and 
manufacturing plant and another 180 layoffs at Cipher Data's newly acquired 
subsidiary, Irwin Magnetic Systems, in Ann Arbor, Mich. Half of the 100 
employees at Cipher Data's Optimem operation in Mountain View will also be laid 
off. 
</P>
<P>
Cipher Data acquired Irwin Magnetic in a bid to expand its product line. 
Irwin's 3.5-inch cartridge tape drives hold a 50% share of the $250-million 
desktop computer tape drive market. 
</P>
<P>
The job cuts are being felt by employees at all levels of the company, Liebl 
said, and will be implemented over the next week or so. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, Cipher Data has moved most of its manufacturing 
operations to Singapore, and Liebl said some of the jobs eliminated could be 
reinstated there when the market rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The $14.2-million first-quarter loss, which came on revenue of $41.3 million, 
contrasts with a $3.8-million profit on $52 million in revenue over the same 
quarter last year. Cipher's first-quarter revenue would have been only $28 
million had it not been for the sales added through the acquisition of Irwin 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Cipher Data stock closed Thursday at $4.75, down $.625 in over-the-counter 
trading. For the fiscal year ended June 30, Cipher Data reported a profit of 
$12.2 million on revenue of $217.8 million.

JAPANESE FIRM BUYS PROPERTY FOR DOWNTOWN OFFICE TOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Shinryo California Inc., the U.S. real estate investment branch of a Japanese 
mechanical engineering company, bought a vacant downtown parcel for $8.25 
million Thursday and announced plans to build an office tower. 
</P>
<P>
The 55,000-square-foot parcel is bounded by 2nd and 3rd avenues and A and Ash 
streets. Gascon Mar Ltd., a San Diego development firm, assisted the Japanese 
company in the purchase from Toronto-based Manufacturers Life Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction was the second major acquisition of downtown real estate by a 
Japanese company within a week. On Oct. 12, the Minami Group -- a Tokyo 
conglomerate and a worldwide hotelier -- purchased three downtown blocks, 
including the historic El Cortez Hotel, and announced a $250-million plan to 
renovate the landmark and build four, mixed-use towers in a joint venture with 
Grosvenor Industries, a San Diego developer. 
</P>
<P>
Although no formal agreement has been reached between Shinryo and Gascon, 
sources close to the deal say it is likely that the two will jointly develop 
the high-rise. 
</P>
<P>
During a telephone interview Thursday, Allan Mackenzie, a Gascon principal, 
said his firm "will have a continuing association with (Shinryo), but I can't 
be more specific about our role." 
</P>
<P>
Shinryo is primarily interested in developing an office tower, perhaps, with 
limited retail space, Mackenzie said. He did not rule out the inclusion of 
residential space, but said it would be unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
"No formal plans have been drafted yet," Mackenzie said. "All I can say is that 
the previous owners (of the site) had plans to build a 22-story office tower 
approved by the city. We anticipate doing something substantially similar to 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Manufacturers Life Insurance Co. razed the Ticor Title building that 
stood on the site a few years ago to make way for its proposed office tower, 
said Paul Lafrenz, a broker with Coldwell Banker who represented Shinryo in the 
transaction. But unfavorable market conditions at the time discouraged 
Manufacturers Life from proceeding, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About six months ago, a business associate introduced Gascon Mar Ltd. to 
Shinryo officials, who were seeking to invest in their first California real 
estate venture. According to Mackenzie, Shinryo is a private, Tokyo-based 
mechanical engineering company. Shinryo California Inc., the company's real 
estate investment branch, is based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, Gascon is developing a 30-acre commercial park on Otay Mesa and 
has built a 100,000-square-foot industrial park in Sabre Springs. The San Diego 
firm, with 20 employees, has developed commercial projects in Los Angeles and 
numerous commercial and residential projects in Riverside.

American Brands Inc.: The Old Greenwich, Conn., consumer products company with 
three core businesses -- tobacco, distilled spirits and life insurance -- 
posted a third-quarter record profit of $166 million, up 13% from a year 
earlier. Revenue totaled $3.1 billion, down 2%. The results were attributed to 
the absence of Southland Life, which was sold in March, and the impact of the 
stronger U.S. dollar on overseas results.

The personal pilot of a top Colombian cocaine kingpin has been arrested and is 
being held for extradition to the United States, police in Bogota said. The 
pilot, Jorge de la Cuesta Marquez, is wanted in Florida on drug charges. He was 
identified as the pilot for Pablo Escobar, leader of the Medellin cocaine 
cartel. Meanwhile, nephews of two other Colombian drug traffickers were 
reported captured in Mexico City, where authorities broke up a ring that flew 
cocaine to Mexico on its way to Florida. The two arrested were Luis Alfredo 
Aguilar Castro, a nephew of Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, and Ricardo Isunza Ochoa, 
a nephew of Fabio Ochoa.

Czechoslovak police detained 15 human rights activists, including former 
Foreign Minister Jiri Hajek and an American member of the International 
Helsinki Federation, dissidents said. Olga Havlova, wife of dissident 
playwright Vaclav Havel, said they were detained when they arrived for a 
meeting at a restaurant in Prague, the capital, with a delegation from the 
Vienna-based federation, which monitors human rights violations. Jeri Laber, a 
member of U.S. Helsinki Watch, was also detained after taking photographs of 
police but was released shortly afterward, dissident Anna Sabatova said. The 
others were freed by nightfall, an emigre source said.

U.N. officials accused Israeli authorities of violating U.N. immunity by 
raiding its offices in the occupied territories. U.N. Secretary General Javier 
Perez de Cuellar said he was awaiting a report from the U.N. Relief and Works 
Agency after learning that Israeli soldiers broke into the agency's offices in 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, detaining staff and confiscating documents. An 
Israeli official said several U.N. staff members were suspected of illegally 
channeling money and jobs to activists in the Arab uprising.

A top U.S. Forest Service official, Associate Chief George M. Leonard, said his 
agency has adopted a policy for managing forests that would lead to the 
preservation of about half of the old-growth forest lands that are unprotected. 
But environmentalists questioned whether the policy is specific enough to have 
a serious impact on timber sales in the old-growth forests, areas where rare 
species such as the spotted owl thrive in centuries-old habitats. The 
Wilderness Society estimates there are 2.4 million acres of old-growth in the 
Pacific Northwest, of which 1.6 million acres are not protected from 
clear-cutting.

Jurors in Santa Ana agreed that a deaf man killed his estranged girlfriend and 
her mother, but they could not agree whether he was insane when he did it. 
After learning the panel was hopelessly deadlocked in the sanity portion of the 
trial of Ronald James Blaney Jr., Santa Ana Superior Court Judge Leonard H. 
McBride declared a mistrial. Two weeks ago, the same jury convicted Blaney, 32, 
of two counts of first-degree murder in the stabbing deaths of Priscilla Vinci, 
33, and her 65-year-old mother, Josephine Vinci. The convictions will stand, 
but a new jury must be picked to decide the sanity issue.

State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) faces a hearing Nov. 1 on whether his 
driver's license should be suspended. Torres, 42, was arrested Sept. 6 near the 
state Capitol for driving without lights, and officers said he refused to 
submit to a blood-alcohol test. The Department of Motor Vehicles said last 
month that Torres would lose his driver's license for two years for refusing to 
be tested. Torres asked for the hearing to review the case. The senator also 
has a Nov. 30 date in Sacramento Municipal Court for a pretrial conference 
where it will be decided if the case will proceed to a trial or if Torres will 
plead guilty to some charge, his attorney said.

RICHARD EWING JR; AIDS OUTREACH GROUP CO-FOUNDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard (Rick) Ewing Jr., the last surviving member of the three founders of 
Being Alive, an AIDS-support organization devoted to helping those stricken 
with the illness, has died in a Los Angeles hospice. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Knox, a spokesman for the group that tried to keep its members focused on 
celebrating life rather than contemplating death, said he died of AIDS 
complications Oct. 12. Ewing was 37. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Rose and Scott Barry, the other two founders, died of the illness in April 
and May, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing, an advertising agency copywriter, came to Los Angeles in 1983 from 
Texas, where he had been involved in a Houston mayoral campaign. 
</P>
<P>
He was diagnosed in March, 1986, as having acquired immune deficiency syndrome, 
and with Rose and Barry that year started a loosely knit association that 
successfully reached out to AIDS victims who found themselves isolated from 
friends, family and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The three men taught activism rather than acceptance. As Barry said early in 
the organization's formative months, "although our lives may be shorter, they 
can still be quality lives and productive." 
</P>
<P>
They held monthly meetings, published a newsletter and set up a speakers 
bureau. Candlelight walks and vigils were held to help the public understand 
the frustrations and needs of AIDS sufferers while campaigns were launched to 
lower the prices of the drugs that were keeping AIDS patients alive. 
</P>
<P>
At his death, Ewing had been working for the AIDS Hospice Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1987, Ewing received the Kenneth Schnorr Memorial Award from the AID 
for AIDS organization, another support group. Schnorr had been an earlier 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing's survivors include his parents, a sister and brother.

DOW RISES 39.55 TO 2,683.20 ON 2ND ANNIVERSARY OF THE '87 CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market staged a strong rally Thursday on the second anniversary of 
the Oct. 19, 1987, crash, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 39.55 
points to close at 2,683.20 after briefly surging above the 2,700 level for the 
first time since last Friday's plunge. 
</P>
<P>
Investors were encouraged by better-than-expected inflation figures, and during 
the day the Dow was up as much as 58 points before profit taking set in. Market 
analysts also said the strong showing stemmed from an increasing conviction 
that last Friday's 190-point drop in the blue chip index was an overreaction. 
The market had plunged on news that the investor group trying to buy UAL Corp. 
had failed to get financing for its $6.75-billion offer, raising fear that the 
climate for corporate takeovers had turned unfavorable. 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday's rally was propelled in part by movement back into so-called deal 
stocks. Speculators and institutional investors were reassured when an investor 
group announced Thursday that it had obtained all of the financing it needs to 
complete a $1.6-billion leveraged buyout of American Medical International. AMI 
gained 1.875 to close at 23.625. 
</P>
<P>
"It's takeover stocks that were leading everything up," said Kenneth P. Ducey, 
senior vice president for institutional trading at S. G. Warburg &amp; Co. in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
The rally in takeover stocks came despite continued signs of trouble in the 
junk bond market, where much of the financing for corporate buyouts and 
acquisitions has been raised in recent years. The initial offerings of at least 
four issues of junk bonds, totaling $1.68 billion, were postponed this week 
because of poor market conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's mood of renewed optimism for the stock market also had a big impact 
on over-the-counter stocks, which had their largest single-day rally since Jan. 
4, 1988. The NASDAQ composite index surged 7.52 points to close at 470.80. The 
rise was led by technology and telecommunications stocks, with cellular 
telephone concerns showing especially strong gains. Analysts said buyers were 
snapping up bargains in the wake of recent declines in OTC stocks. 
</P>
<P>
The stock market in general was cheered Thursday by news from the Labor 
Department that consumer prices rose only 0.2% in September. The figures -- on 
top of those from August, which showed no rise at all -- provided a strong 
indication that inflation at least for the moment has been checked. This added 
to expectations that the Federal Reserve Board would lower interest rates, 
which almost invariably helps the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Conlon, executive vice president in charge of equity trading at Nikko 
Securities Co. International in New York, called it "a good, solid moral 
victory for bulls" that the market rose on the second anniversary of the 1987 
crash, when the Dow plunged 508 points in a single day. He said Thursday's 
rally stemmed mainly from "a reassessment of what took place (last) Friday," 
adding that "the reaction people had then was just extraordinarily overdone." 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones transportation index, which had been hit hard by the free fall of 
UAL's stock and that of AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, had its 
first rally since last week. The transportation index gained 15.64 to close at 
1,263.51. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's rally leaves the Dow industrial index well above its level of about 
2,250 just before the 1987 crash, and not that far from its all-time high of 
2,791.41 reached less than two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Abby Joseph Cohen, Drexel Burnham Lambert's chief investment strategist, said 
Thursday's rally was also fueled by strong buying of blue chip stocks by 
institutional investors, including mutual funds. She said a lot of stock mutual 
funds, expecting large redemptions by customers after last week's drop, needed 
to sell stocks to raise cash; they sold blue chips because the market for these 
shares could most easily absorb large transactions. Now, Cohen said, "people 
are re-establishing positions in high-quality stocks." 
</P>
<P>
International Business Machines, which authorized an additional $1 billion in 
repurchases of its stock, added 2.375 to 104.125. 
</P>
<P>
Other gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, up 1.125 at 44.5; 
Procter &amp; Gamble, up 0.75 at 128; General Motors, up 0.625 at 45.5; 
Coca-Cola, up 2.375 at 70.375, and Du Pont, up 1.5 at 115.875. 
</P>
<P>
The Bay Area earthquake continued to have an impact on securities markets 
Thursday. Options traders from the Pacific Stock Exchange's offices in San 
Francisco arrived by chartered jets to set up temporary trading in Chicago, New 
York and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific exchange is the only one that makes a market for stock options of 
certain big companies, including Hilton Hotels and Compaq Computer. Officials 
were anxious to have trading in the options resume quickly, since today is the 
final session to trade or exercise October stock options before they expire. An 
option is the right to buy or sell a certain stock at a specified price before 
a specified expiration date. 
</P>
<P>
At the New York Stock Exchange, trading volume Thursday was a moderate 198.12 
million shares, compared to 166.90 on Wednesday. Advancing issues outnumbered 
those that fell by about 7 to 2, with 1,235 up, 355 down and 379 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The American Stock Exchange's market value index closed up 4.74 at 382.81. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stocks rose in a fairly quiet session, with the Financial Times 
Stock Exchange 100-share index gaining 19.2 points to close at 2,189.3. 
</P>
<P>
Confidence seeped back into Tokyo's market after it showed its ability to 
weather a sharp worldwide setback for stock prices early this week. Prices 
ended broadly higher, with the Nikkei 225-share average up 266.66 points, or 
0.76%, to close at 35,374.22.

Ford to End Scorpio Imports: Ford Motor Co. said it will no longer import its 
German-built Scorpio luxury sedan, in effect dissolving its Merkur franchises 
at Lincoln-Mercury dealers after nearly five years of disappointing results. 
Ford said it will not offer a 1990-model of its $28,400 Scorpio sedan because 
of the high costs of equipping it with passive restraints and decreasing luxury 
car sales in the U.S. Ford executives had recently said they remained committed 
to the Merkur franchise.

JAPAN URGED TO HELP EASE U.S. HOSTILITY

U.S. Ambassador Michael H. Armacost denied Thursday that American racism is 
creating a backlash against Japan's investments in the United States but warned 
the Japanese that they must improve their track record to combat 
anti-investment sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
The warning was delivered in a speech to a conference of business and political 
leaders from Texas and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"There should be no question -- the welcome mat is still out," Armacost assured 
the Japanese. But, he said, "Sony's recent purchase of Columbia Pictures 
crystallized . . . concerns about the rising flow of foreign investment in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Some Americans worry that for a substantial, perhaps a technologically 
critical, part of the U.S. economy, a measure of control over decisions 
affecting our national interest could be lost. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a natural concern that foreign managers may not be sensitive to 
American traditions and unwritten rules. . . . Like Japanese, some Americans 
worry that our social harmony may be disrupted," the ambassador said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not racism," he added, taking note of recent criticisms made privately 
by Japanese against America's growing condemnations of Japan, in general, and 
of Sony's acquisition, in particular. "We have worked hard to wipe out the 
stain of racism on our history. . . . And we have largely succeeded." 
</P>
<P>
Rather, he said, Americans are criticizing investments such as Sony's because 
they "perceive that Japanese firms are free to acquire existing American 
companies but that comparable opportunities are rarely available here" in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
As both U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills and Deputy Treasury Secretary 
John E. Robson did during visits here last week, Armacost said opportunities 
for U.S. firms to buy Japanese corporations are needed to ensure that American 
support for foreign investment continues. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of reciprocity, Armacost said, "is not a simple issue of Japanese legal 
prohibitions, as it once was. It's a consequence, instead, of the close 
relationships that complicate many foreign investors' entry into the Japanese 
market." 
</P>
<P>
To combat rising American criticism, Armacost also advised the Japanese to 
"demonstrate that their presence benefits the United States and, particularly, 
the communities where they locate." 
</P>
<P>
Japanese investors, he said, should "localize" their U.S. management 
structures, "fully integrate their U.S. manufacturing," rather than merely 
assembling products, and "increase business dealings with established U.S. 
firms," rather than bring with them subsidiaries of their traditional parts 
suppliers in Japan.

They also should get involved in community service activities, "like the 
Rotary, the Jaycees, Scouts, Little League and PTA," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Although many Japanese economists had predicted that establishment of 
manufacturing plants in the United States would result in generating new 
exports to Japan, the ambassador complained that growing flows of Japanese 
machinery to equip new factories in the United States have "greatly outweighed" 
exports to Japan of goods produced in those factories. 
</P>
<P>
Armacost cited a survey by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
showing that Japanese-owned factories in the United States shipped back to 
Japan only $980 million worth of their American-based production in the 
Japanese fiscal year that ended in March, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1988, Japanese investment in the United States amounted to $53.4 
billion, 16% of total foreign investment and second only to that of Britain, he 
said. But investment from Japan doubled in two years and expanded twice as fast 
as foreign investments as a whole, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"Because it is the fastest growing and tends to be readily recognizable, 
Japanese investment stands out most," he said.

WARNER SEEKS TO BAN SONY FROM HIRING GUBER, PETERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In a legal move that casts new doubt over Sony Corp.'s staffing plans for 
Columbia Pictures, Warner Bros. on Thursday filed a motion for a preliminary 
injunction to prevent the Japanese electronics giant from hiring producers 
Peter Guber and Jon Peters. 
</P>
<P>
If a Los Angeles Superior Court judge grants the motion at a hearing set for 
Nov. 2, Sony could be forced to look elsewhere for top talent to run Columbia, 
which the Japanese firm is now buying through a $3.4-billion tender offer that 
expires Oct. 31. Sony is also acquiring Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. for 
$17.50 a share, or about $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
A Warner attorney said the studio is seeking a preliminary injunction to speed 
up resolution of the Warner-Sony dispute. Last week, the two companies filed 
suit against each other in the same court, but that litigation could drag on 
for years while Sony pursues its plans for Columbia, said Warner attorney 
Stuart Robinowitz. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure they continue rendering services for us on all projects 
in the works," Robinowitz said. "We don't want to wait a year or two. We also 
feel we have a very strong case." 
</P>
<P>
But an attorney for Guber-Peters dismissed Warner's motion as relying on 
speculation. "I don't think it's real," attorney Terry Christensen said. "It's 
a further attempt to hammer Sony." Warner, he added, filed the motion "for 
publicity and bargaining purposes." 
</P>
<P>
A key issue in the Sony-Warner litigation is whether Warner executives ever 
gave Guber and Peters oral assurances that they could break their five-year 
exclusive production deal with Warner to pursue executive posts at other 
studios. Christensen said Warner President Terry Semel provided such an 
assurance, while Warner calls the alleged oral agreement "a transparent fairy 
tale." 
</P>
<P>
In a declaration filed in court and signed by Semel, the Warner president said 
he first learned about Sony's advances to the producers at a Sept. 25 meeting 
with Guber, about one week after the Japanese firm first approached the pair. 
"Guber told me that the package of financial incentives offered by Sony would 
allow him and Mr. Peters to make more money than anyone in the history of the 
motion picture industry," Semel said. 
</P>
<P>
At that meeting, Guber asked for a written release from their five-year 
agreement with Warner. "I told him I could not sign the release," Semel said. 
Then he called Warner Bros. Chairman Robert A. Daly and they arranged a 
conference call with Steven J. Ross, co-chief executive of parent Time Warner 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"We all expressed shock that Guber and Peters had secretly made a deal with 
Sony," Semel said. "When I asked Mr. Guber why he had not discussed this matter 
in advance with me, he told me that he had chosen not to inform Warner earlier 
. . . because he was concerned that Mr. Ross would call Mr. Akio Morita, Sony's 
chairman, and tell him that Warner would not surrender its rights under the 
1989 agreement." 
</P>
<P>
According to Christensen, however, Guber's initial meeting with Semel -- a 
close friend -- ended with hugs and congratulations. It was Ross who put up a 
roadblock to letting Guber and Peters out of their deal, according to industry 
sources and Christensen. 
</P>
<P>
The following day, Peters made a personal plea to Ross to let the pair out of 
their contract, according to a declaration made by Ross. "I explained that we 
could not release them in view of their great importance to the company," Ross 
said.

GROUP OF SEVEN SPLIT OVER INFLATION STRATEGY; 
</P>
<P>
POLICY: FAILURE TO FIX THE DOLLAR'S VALUE ON EXCHANGE MARKETS HAS CREATED A 
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC HOT POTATO AMONG THE SEVEN MAJOR INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States and its major economic allies are engaged in a deadly serious 
game of economic hot potato -- to see which will end up bearing the brunt of a 
new surge of inflation that is building in the major industrialized countries. 
</P>
<P>
The struggle has become more intense in the wake of the recent failure by the 
seven major industrial democracies to fix the value of the dollar on the 
foreign exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts say it is also at the heart of the latest flap between the 
Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board over how far to go in driving 
the dollar down. The Treasury wants the dollar to drop further to ease the 
trade deficit, but the Fed wants the greenback high to ward off inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a battle about inflation and the trade-off against the (large U.S.) 
trade deficit," said Scott Pardee, a former Fed official now at Yamaichi 
International America, a securities house in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The disagreements were temporarily put aside as all sides struggled to cope 
with last Friday's stock market plunge, which forced the Fed to nudge U.S. 
interest rates down slightly and kept the outlook for the dollar uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
But Washington officials and many private analysts say it is likely to 
re-emerge as the stock market turmoil abates and the foreign exchange markets 
return to normal. 
</P>
<P>
"The dollar problem is only temporarily off the front burner," said William C. 
Melton, chief economist for IDS Financial Services in Minneapolis. "The markets 
probably will be regaining their poise in about a week -- and then we'll be 
back to business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
The current wrangling among the United States, West Germany and Japan 
represents a decided departure from the practice of the past two decades, when 
-- by mutual agreement -- the United States absorbed most of the economic 
shocks that the Big Seven had to endure. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, for example, Washington willingly became the engine of worldwide 
growth and later accepted a steady fall in the value of the dollar even though 
a cheaper currency eroded America's political power and exacerbated inflation 
here at home. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, while the dollar was high, new economic stimulus from the 
United States kept European economies from plunging more deeply into recession. 
The U.S. willingness to shoulder the economic burden provided the cohesion that 
enabled the allies to work together. 
</P>
<P>
Today, inflation is once again threatening to cloud the economic outlook. West 
Germany's prices clearly are on the rise, and authorities there are wary that 
the spiral may be speeded by the influx of East Bloc immigrants who are certain 
to spur demand for consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
Japan is also experiencing higher than expected inflation pressures. And the 
United States, while apparently no longer in danger of an overheating economy, 
is struggling with an underlying 5% inflation rate that many analysts still 
find worrisome. 
</P>
<P>
The economics of the hot potato struggle are simple: If the dollar's value 
rises against the West German mark and the Japanese yen, then inflation 
pressures intensify in West Germany and Japan while easing in the United 
States. If it plunges, price pressures ease abroad but increase at home. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that having a high-valued currency, although making a country's 
goods less competitive overseas, helps offset domestic inflation pressures by 
making imports less expensive and preventing domestic industries from raising 
their own prices. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, a low currency reduces a country's trade deficit and helps 
domestic manufacturers, but it intensifies inflation at home. 
</P>
<P>
Policy-makers in Washington, Bonn and Tokyo are aware that if the dollar were 
to plunge significantly, it would transfer the brunt of the inflation from West 
Germany and Japan to the United States. If the greenback's value rose, the 
pressures would flow the other way. 
</P>
<P>
The latest flap is the culmination of a long-brewing dispute between the Fed 
and the Bush Administration over how seriously the economy is threatened by 
inflation -- and how much the Fed should change its policies to accommodate 
other economic goals. 
</P>
<P>
The central bank is, by its nature, committed to putting the anti-inflation 
effort first. No other government entity has price stability as its major 
objective. It was Fed tightening, first in 1979 and later in 1987, that reined 
in inflation. 
</P>
<P>
With the Administration and Congress still unwilling to reduce the budget 
deficit any further, and with inflation pressures still high, many analysts 
believe that the central bank has no choice but to hold firm. "The Fed is 
absolutely right," Melton asserted. 
</P>
<P>
But the Administration is pressing for a more buoyant domestic economy and 
wants the dollar lower to help ease trade pressures here. The trade deficit 
ballooned to $10.8 billion in August, up from $8.2 billion in July, and the 
White House fears that trend may persist. 
</P>
<P>
"What's different today is that, certainly as the Fed sees it, we don't have a 
lot of room to move," said Robert Z. Lawrence, a Brookings Institution 
economist. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping with tradition, the Fed by and large has acceded to the 
Administration's wishes on exchange rate policy. On Sept. 23, the Treasury 
persuaded the six other industrial democracies to launch a drive to cap the 
dollar's rise. The Fed went along reluctantly. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, the effort has fizzled. Despite repeated rounds of heavy 
intervention by the Big Seven countries, the greenback's value has fallen only 
slightly in the foreign exchange markets. And it has risen again in recent 
days. The dollar Thursday stood at 142 yen and 1.85 West German marks -- close 
to where it was before the Sept. 23 Group of Seven move. 
</P>
<P>
More drastic steps -- moves by the West German central bank and the Bank of 
Japan to raise their interest rates in hopes of easing demand for greenbacks -- 
also have proved inadequate. The message from the markets was that the measures 
simply are not enough. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like they really would have to have some major changes in monetary 
policy now to have much effect," said Brookings' Lawrence. "What they've tried 
so far simply hasn't done the job." 
</P>
<P>
The Group of Seven dollar-bashing effort is in disarray for several reasons. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, there is not the cohesion among Washington and its allies that 
there was, say, in 1985, when the Treasury launched a move to drive the dollar 
down. The Fed opposed that devaluation but did not have the political clout to 
block it. 
</P>
<P>
And the mark and the yen are both being weakened by political instability in 
the West German and Japanese governments -- also a new element. So the 
traditional jawboning and interest rate juggling is not having as much effect 
as some expected.

T-Bill Rates Fall: Interest rates on 52-week Treasury bills fell at the latest 
action to the lowest level since July. The Treasury sold $9.8 billion of new 
bills at an average discount rate of 7.35%, down from 7.61% at the last auction 
on Sept. 21. The rates were the lowest since July 27, when the one-year bills 
sold for 7.22%. The new discount rate understates the actual return to 
investors -- 7.90%, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,256.80.

Joel Ritch's San Francisco office was intact when he arrived Wednesday, but his 
business was a mess. 
</P>
<P>
His firm, Professional Messenger, like many San Francisco small businesses, 
does not have a contingency plan for emergencies. Instead, he has operated by 
"instant, knee-jerk reaction." The office was without power when Ritch, 
president of the firm, and two employees entered the brick building south of 
downtown Wednesday morning. Ritch immediately rented a portable generator to 
restore some of the power in the offices. By later in the day, one of seven 
telephone lines started working. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, nearly as soon as power had been restored, Ritch and his staff 
found themselves out on the street: Police and fire officials ordered them out 
as they closed a building next door because of suspected structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
Ritch loaded important files and a telephone into a car, and operations 
director Debra Steckel made arrangements for the firm's answering service to 
take calls and forward messages to the Paradise Lounge across the street. 
</P>
<P>
A bus stop then became the operation's center for Professional Messenger, which 
has a staff of about 10 workers and contracts with about 20 messengers who 
operate on bikes, motorcycles and cars, serving firms in the entire San 
Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
Messengers, who on a typical day get directions by walkie-talkie or two-way 
radio, swung by the bus stop for their orders. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no idea where our drivers are," Steckel said. "This is a very complex 
operation. Now it's a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ritch began considering longer-term concerns. 
</P>
<P>
With no offices, he attempted to reach the landlord of a building that the firm 
had planned to move into in December to see if they might set up quarters 
earlier there. 
</P>
<P>
Other options included going to Ritch's home. "We could rent cellular phones 
and pagers for all the messengers," said Ritch. "We could even do it right here 
in the street." 
</P>
<P>
The firm was able to remedy its problem at least for the near term, when, after 
an hour of discussion with officials from the city's Building Inspector's 
Office, Ritch and his staff were allowed to re-enter the building, but the 
building's owner must immediately obtain a structural engineer's report that 
the building could survive the crash of its neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Ritch was also trying to develop a plan to provide service from San Francisco 
to Oakland, which has been made extremely difficult because of the collapse of 
the Bay Bridge, which connects the two cities. "We'll hire people to ride the 
BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) to get across the Bay. On each side, messengers 
will meet them at the station and go from there." 
</P>
<P>
Ritch said that two or three days without doing business will wipe out profits 
for perhaps two or three months. If his firm is forced to close six days, "It 
would kill us." 
</P>
<P>
"When you're young, you don't have an emergency plan. But we're also 
adaptable," Steckel said. "This is the kind of business where we've got an 
emergency every day. We just have to come up with a new solution for this one."

STRONG SALES SEND MATTEL PROFIT SOARING 73% 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mattel Inc., the maker of Barbie dolls and other toys, said Thursday that 
strong sales in its three major product lines drove its third-quarter earnings 
up 73% to $38 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawthorne-based company said sales for the three months ending Sept. 30 
totaled $410 million, a 34% increase from the same quarter a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Mattel said its long-established Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels racing cars led 
its sales and earnings growth. Mattel was also bolstered by the sale of its 
Disney character line of toys for infants and preschoolers, said John Amerman, 
chairman and chief executive. Amerman said Mattel has focused much of its 
marketing efforts on those three toy lines. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes the volatility out of business when the top sellers do well," Amerman 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
The Disney line, introduced by Mattel in 1988, has been a boon for the company, 
said Barry Rothberg, an analyst at New York-based Mabon, Nugent &amp; Co. 
Disney sales totaled about $55 million in 1988 and should climb to $125 million 
this year, Rothberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"Before introducing Disney, they did not have a real presence in the preschool 
market," Rothberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Rothberg said Mattel is also benefiting from an industrywide resurgence in the 
toy market. For example, Hasbro Inc. -- another leading toy maker -- on 
Thursday reported a 73.1% increase in third-quarter earnings, Rothberg noted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fairly healthy industry now," Rothberg said. "Until recently, the 
industry was losing ground to Nintendo and other video games." 
</P>
<P>
However, Rothberg said much of Mattel's third-quarter earnings stems from sales 
to retailers that are stocking up for the upcoming holiday shopping period. 
</P>
<P>
"The third quarter bodes well for the company," he said. "But the real test 
comes in the fourth quarter; that's when we find out how well consumers like 
the products."

Bond prices rose broadly Thursday as a government report on consumer prices 
indicated inflation is more subdued than expected. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 27/32 point, or about $8.40 per 
$1,000 face amount. Its yield dropped to 7.96% from 8.03% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the day, the Labor Department said consumer prices in September rose 
0.2%. Many analysts had been looking for a rise twice as large. 
</P>
<P>
The rise also came to 0.2% when food and energy costs were excluded. That 
narrower measure is an important barometer for the markets. 
</P>
<P>
The moderate rise was viewed favorably because higher prices erode the value of 
fixed-income securities such as bonds. The smaller rise was also seen as giving 
the Federal Reserve more leeway to encourage lower interest rates, a 
development that would boost bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
rose by 1/16 point to 1/8 point, intermediate maturities climbed by 5/32 to 1/2 
point and long-term issues jumped as much as 7/8 point, according to Telerate 
Inc., the financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a $1,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
Prices also were generally higher in the market for high-yield junk bonds, 
according to John Lonski of Moody's Investors Service. 
</P>
<P>
"It reflects the strength in equities and quality bonds," he said, adding that 
it was one of the better days for the junk bond market in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
He estimated that prices were up $2.50 to $5 for every $1,000 in face value on 
average by late afternoon and advancing bonds well outnumbered declines. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8.688%, down from 8.75% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar finished mixed against major foreign currencies at the end of an 
uneventful session. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices eased in the United States after posting scattered gains and losses 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at 
$367.10 an ounce, down $1.60 from Wednesday. Republic National Bank quoted an 
ounce of gold at $366.50 at 4 p.m. EDT, $2.20 lower than Wednesday's late bid. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers in financial centers around the world temporarily sold dollars 
when news broke that September's CPI rise was less than expected. 
</P>
<P>
But the unexpectedly small inflation rate had little lasting impact on currency 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation about the chances for lower interest rates circulated in the 
markets and tended to temper any urge to buy dollars, dealers said. The low 
inflation reading could give the Federal Reserve Board greater leeway to ease 
monetary tightness, leading to lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar opened this morning at 141.93 yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange 
market.On Thursday, the dollar closed at 141.55 yen down from 142.10 yen at 
Wednesday's close. Later, in London, it fell further to 141.25 yen. But at the

WALL STREET CRITICS CALL FOR FURTHER MARKET REFORM 
</P>

<P>
As the final echoes of last Friday's stock market avalanche fade, some in the 
investment world are arguing that the big slide shows that the job of reforming 
the market system is only half complete. 
</P>
<P>
Some Wall Street critics assert that the use of trading halts in the futures 
market but not in the stock market increased panic and hastened stocks' fall. 
Other critics, including many individual investors and the brokerages that 
serve them, are complaining that the fall was worsened by computer-guided 
program trading. 
</P>
<P>
The critics haven't found a receptive audience among government regulators and 
market administrators, who seem to have spent more time this week hailing the 
markets' performance than searching for new cracks in the edifice. Few 
observers believe that the gripes will bring about change in Washington, or in 
the New York or Chicago markets. 
</P>
<P>
But the critics are adamant. "We saw in October, 1987, what program trading 
does on a bad day," said John W. Bachmann, managing principal at the Edwards D. 
Jones brokerage in St. Louis. "We saw it Friday. And it looks like a lesson we 
will have to keep on learning." 
</P>
<P>
The programs instruct traders to buy or sell huge groups, or "baskets," of 
securities simultaneously at key moments. Some program trading is a type called 
index arbitrage, in which traders buy and sell big blocks of shares in New York 
and stock index futures in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
These stock index futures are investments that are worth the value of a 
collection of shares at a set point in the future. Index arbitrage players 
profit by exploiting tiny differences in the value of stock index futures and 
the underlying shares themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The foes of program trading assert that when the programs kicked in late 
Friday, they produced selling momentum that pounded the Dow Jones industrial 
index to its 190-point loss. Program trading of all kinds amounted to about 13% 
of New York Stock Exchange volume last Friday and about 16% on Monday, exchange 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
They assert that the program trading activity wasn't enough to have 
precipitated the slide. The big program traders, which include such firms as 
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., Salomon Bros., Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and Morgan 
Stanley &amp; Co., point out that the presidentially appointed Brady Commission 
of 1987 found program trading not guilty of provoking the October, 1987, crash. 
</P>
<P>
Defenders of the practice observe too that program trading will soon be 
available to investors through overseas markets, making it futile, they say, to 
ban it here. They note that the New York Stock Exchange is due this month to 
begin trading an investment whose price fluctuates with the value of all stocks 
in the popular Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index. The availability of that 
investment is expected to remove much of the incentive for index arbitrage. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), chairman of a House subcommittee that oversees 
securities regulation, says he's considering amending a pending bill to allow 
the Securities and Exchange Commission to halt program trading in emergencies. 
But Markey may not have much support for the idea. Even Rep. John Dingell 
(D-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and a critic of 
stock index futures, isn't sure it would help to order the computers unplugged. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the critics are unappeased. Bachmann says the program trading has caused 
"lots of anger" among the firm's clientele, and not because they lack 
sophistication. "You can sit in Grand Island, Neb., and understand a lot about 
life that you couldn't see standing in New York talking to people who always 
agree with you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
William J. O'Neil, an investor and chairman of the Investor's Daily financial 
newspaper, urged in a front-page editorial in his paper Tuesday that program 
trading be outlawed or sharply restricted because it is "a major disincentive 
for public ownership of any American company." 
</P>
<P>
As these critics push for further reform, another group argues that some 
changes made since the 1987 crash have been half-steps that worsened the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, they maintain that trading halts imposed in futures and options 
last Friday effectively closed half the escape hatches for investors, 
heightening panic and increasing the flight from stocks. Eliminating the chance 
to escape through half the markets was "the worst of all possible worlds," 
William C. Freund, former chief economist at the New York Stock Exchange, wrote 
in an opinion page article that appeared Tuesday in the Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
The temporary closings came about because of "circuit breakers" that the 
Chicago Mercantile Exchange has put in place since the crash. Under this 
arrangement, trading in the S&amp;P 500 index was halted at 3 p.m. for 30 
minutes after the index had slid 12 points, or the equivalent of a 100-point 
drop on the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
Options on many stocks were also halted while trading in New York continued. 
Trading in the S&amp;P 500 index was resumed at 3:30 p.m. but closed again at 
3:45 p.m., when the index had fallen another 30 points to its daily limit. 
</P>
<P>
Some advocates of the circuit breakers maintain that the halts gave traders 
time to digest what was happening in the market and kept the big investment 
banks from making the index arbitrage trades that some critics felt accelerated 
the 1987 crash. 
</P>
<P>
The critics see it differently. Robert Gordon, president of Twenty First 
Securities in New York, noted that the Brady Commission's central conclusion 
about the 1987 crash was that the futures and stock market now operate as one 
market and should be regulated as such. 
</P>
<P>
"They've ignored that lesson," he said. "It's better to have no rule than a 
rule like this that affects one market and not the other."

U.S. TO BAR CITIZENS FROM ANY DEALINGS WITH NORIEGA 
</P>

<P>
The Bush Administration, imposing new sanctions against Panama, has decided to 
outlaw all financial dealings by U.S. citizens with strongman Manuel A. 
Noriega, his wife and 32 Panamanian companies in which they own shares, 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, scheduled to be announced next week, is the first of several new 
actions planned by U.S. officials to increase pressure on Noriega himself, 
rather than the Panamanian economy as a whole, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
They added that the Administration is also moving toward a decision to prohibit 
Panamanian-registered ships from calling at U.S. ports, an action that would 
presumably force many vessels to re-register in other countries, depriving 
Noriega's government of more revenue. Panama today is one of the world's major 
"flags of convenience" for maritime commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The new sanctions come in the wake of a failed coup against Noriega. The 
Administration was criticized for not sufficiently aiding it. 
</P>
<P>
Any U.S. citizen who deals with Noriega, his wife, his partner or his companies 
-- in any transaction, anywhere in the world -- could face fines of up to 
$500,000 per transaction and up to 12 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
One aim of the new measures is to feed Noriega's "paranoia" in a way that could 
weaken his ability to maintain control over Panama's military, a senior 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think he's sleeping well," another official said. An abortive coup on 
Oct. 3, led by disaffected officers who had been close to Noriega, "shows that 
. . . his institutional base is crumbling beneath his feet," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some officials concede that the Administration is having a hard time 
effectively pressuring Noriega. The United States has been trying to force the 
strongman out of office with financial sanctions for more than two years, but 
while the measures have brought Panama's economy to a standstill, they have 
failed to budge the general. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for all the kinds of pressure we can," the senior official said. 
"One of the problems is we've done most of the things we can without really 
hurting the Panamanian people badly. You can put more economic sanctions on, 
but it really hurts the people. . . . We don't want to do that." 
</P>
<P>
The Administration is resorting to a novel twist of law to outlaw all 
transactions between U.S. citizens and Noriega: It is formally declaring the 
Panamanian and his wife to be "designated Cuban nationals" under the 
26-year-old U.S. trade embargo against Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. intelligence officials have long charged that Noriega has forged close 
links with the Communist regime of Fidel Castro, but only recently did State 
Department officials propose turning that charge against the Panamanian's 
personal business holdings. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration also has placed Noriega's business partner, Carlos Duque, 
under the embargo, along with 12 firms he is believed to control. 
</P>
<P>
"This has the effect of focusing on Noriega and his cronies in the (Panama 
Defense Forces)," said an official involved in preparing the new measures. "It 
is very focused and very tailored." 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's companies, which include several import-export firms, are believed to 
conduct "substantial business" with U.S. firms, another official said, adding: 
"But it's not Americans seeking them out. It's the (Noriega) companies going 
out into the market, buying electronic goods and, in some cases, shipping them 
to Cuba. . . . The Americans may not know that Noriega owns shares." 
</P>
<P>
He said he could not provide an estimate of the volume of business or name any 
U.S. firms that may have dealt with Noriega-owned concerns. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials are compiling lists of other Noriega associates and companies 
and may place them under the Cuban embargo as well, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration had begun discussing new sanctions against Panama even 
before the coup attempt, once the Organization of American States decided not 
to impose multinational measures against the Noriega regime, officials said. 
But the failure of the Oct. 3 coup, and the widespread criticism of the 
Administration's failure to oust Noriega that followed, clearly gave new 
impetus to the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The United States first imposed sanctions against Panama in mid-1987 and again 
in December of that year. Additional sanctions were imposed in March, 1988, 
after two federal grand juries indicted Noriega on drug trafficking charges. 
</P>
<P>
Then-President Ronald Reagan ordered the seizure of Panamanian government 
assets in the United States and withheld U.S. payments for use of the Panama 
Canal. Later, the Treasury Department ordered U.S. firms doing business in 
Panama to stop paying taxes to Noriega's regime, but the general persuaded them 
to ignore the order by threatening to jail the companies' managers. 
</P>
<P>
In a related action, the commander of U.S. troops in Panama has recommended 
shortening soldiers' tours of duty to decrease the number of military spouses 
and children stationed there. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has been gradually withdrawing military families from Panama 
because of the danger that U.S. dependents could be caught in hostilities. But 
there are still about 11,000 American dependents in the country, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are reviewing the issue right now of whether or not that (withdrawal) 
should be accelerated," White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has about 12,500 military personnel in Panama and about 2,700 
civilian Defense Department employees.

SENATE REJECTS FLAG-BURNING AMENDMENT 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
The Senate on Thursday rejected a constitutional amendment to outlaw flag 
burning that President Bush had endorsed in the wake of a controversial Supreme 
Court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
The 51-48 vote in favor of the President's proposal fell far short of the 
two-thirds majority needed to initiate a constitutional change and appeared 
likely to bury the issue for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
Congress already has approved a statutory ban on flag burning that was 
supported by lawmakers who oppose a constitutional change. Bush said last 
Friday that he would allow the law to go into effect without signing it. 
</P>
<P>
The White House shrugged off the defeat of the constitutional change Thursday, 
saying only that Bush was disappointed by the outcome of the campaign that he 
had begun with a burst of public relations activity last summer. 
</P>
<P>
The flag issue became a political firestorm after the Supreme Court struck down 
a Texas law against flag burning in June. But the President's allies in the 
Senate said that the issue has since lost much of its political appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents picked up 14 more votes than necessary to defeat the amendment -- 
including 11 Repub lican senators -- with arguments that the statutory ban 
passed by Congress would protect the flag adequately without tampering with the 
Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
"We can support the American flag without changing the American Constitution," 
said Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell of Maine, who denounced the 
proposed constitutional amendment as unnecessary and unwise. 
</P>
<P>
But Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas termed the outcome "a loss for 
the American people" and said that the flag flying over the Capitol should be 
lowered to half-staff in mourning. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendment was supported by 33 Republicans and 18 Democrats; 37 
Democrats and 11 Republicans voted against it. Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) was 
absent. An aide to Wilson, a Republican candidate for governor of California, 
said Wilson was in San Francisco observing earthquake clean-up activities. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) also traveled to California to observe the 
earthquake damage but returned Thursday and voted against the constitutional 
amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Dole suggested that political opponents would try to exploit the flag issue 
against senators who voted against the proposed constitutional change and 
charged that Democrats had blocked the amendment by making it a partisan cause. 
</P>
<P>
But he criticized the Administration's lobbying effort as inadequate, noting 
that its three-line statement of support for the proposal would not take up a 
lot of space in the Congressional Record. 
</P>
<P>
That modest statement contrasts with an earlier White House public relations 
blitz. On June 30, for example, the President went to the Iwo Jima Memorial to 
commemorate the flag-raising on the Pacific island during World War II as part 
of the pro-amendment campaign. 
</P>
<P>
But, as it became increasingly apparent that the proposal was doomed, Bush 
lowered his voice. 
</P>
<P>
"The silence from the White House over the past few days on this issue has been 
deafening," Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said the proposal should have been called the "Bush-Atwater Amendment" 
because the President gave it his blessing after a luncheon with Republican 
National Chairman Lee Atwater. 
</P>
<P>
"(Bush) has used his high office for a low purpose," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) disagreed. "It is not accurate to say that this is a 
partisan matter being engineered for crass political purposes when 18 Democrats 
have supported it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, 
has said that the Senate would have voted overwhelmingly for a constitutional 
change in the first days or weeks after the Supreme Court's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
On June 21, the high court reversed the conviction of Gregory Lee Johnson for 
torching a flag during the 1984 Republican convention in Dallas on grounds that 
his action was symbolic speech protected by the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the statutory ban approved by Congress contend it has a better 
chance of being upheld than the Texas law because it prohibits flag desecration 
regardless of motivation. The Texas law prohibited flag burning only if a jury 
considered such action offensive in nature. 
</P>
<P>
Prompt action by the House and Senate to approve the statutory ban appeared to 
cool passions of both the public and the lawmakers, Biden noted. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the Republicans who were original co-sponsors of the proposed amendment 
changed their minds and voted against it: Sens. John C. Danforth of Missouri, 
Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire, William S. Cohen of Maine and Slade Gorton 
of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Danforth, among others, said he was opposed to the proposal because it would 
narrow the free speech provisions of the First Amendment for the first time in 
200 years. 
</P>
<P>
A leading conservative, Sen. Gordon J. Humphrey (R-N.H.), also cast his vote 
against the amendment, declaring that the Senate had put aside polls and 
political considerations "to do what's right for posterity." 
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Humphrey added: "One would think that America was aflame with 
burning flags, when nothing could be further from the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston said that the 48 senators who voted against the amendment showed 
political courage, and others cautioned that it might be costly at the polls 
later. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Senate vote effectively killed the amendment for the time being, 
the House is expected to vote on the proposal before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
It takes a two-thirds approval by both chambers, plus ratification by 
three-fourths of the states, to adopt an amendment to the Constitution.

NIMITZ FREEWAY DEATH TOLL SHARPLY LOWERED; 
</P>
<P>
DISASTER: POWERFUL AFTERSHOCKS AWAKEN BAY AREA RESIDENTS BUT THERE ARE 
INCREASING SIGNS OF A RETURN TO SOME OF THE ROUTINES OF NORMAL LIFE.

<P>
As if Bay Area emotions were not already tattered enough, residents were shaken 
awake Thursday by powerful and destructive pre-dawn aftershocks, but as the day 
went on there was good news in the collapsed rubble of the Nimitz Freeway and 
the return to some routines of normal life. 
</P>
<P>
Crews digging with jackhammers and cranes found many fewer cars than expected 
crushed in the rubble of the Nimitz Freeway's upper deck, which collapsed on 
motorists below in Tuesday's catastrophic 6.9-magnitude quake. 
</P>
<P>
Disaster officials felt confident enough late Thursday to revise their fears 
that more than 250 people may have died on the Nimitz. 
</P>
<P>
"Now they are going lower, much lower in fact," said Lisa Covington, a 
spokeswoman for the Office of Emergency Services. So far, 45 automobiles have 
been pulled from the rubble and 18 bodies recovered, Oakland Mayor Lionel 
Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Another 27 automobiles were sighted but workers cannot yet tell if they contain 
victims, Oakland Asst. Fire Chief Andy Stark said. About 720 feet of the 
freeway upper deck lies too tightly on the lower level for searchers to look 
underneath. 
</P>
<P>
In all, at least 34 deaths have been confirmed in the Bay Area since the quake 
that struck minutes before the start of a World Series game in San Francisco. 
Unofficial reports have put the death toll as high as 39. There have been at 
least 2,483 injuries, state officials said Thursday night. Oakland police said 
167 people remain missing. 
</P>
<P>
Damage was estimated at $4 billion and climbing. In Washington, House Speaker 
Thomas S. Foley said Congress will consider a $2.5-billion aid package for the 
Bay Area. Gov. George Deukmejian said an emergency, temporary tax increase -- 
probably in the form of higher gasoline or sales taxes -- may be needed. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush was planning to leave Andrews Air Force Base before dawn today 
to survey the quake damage and meet with officials on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
As the second day of recovery began in good weather, many parts of the Bay Area 
tried to pick up the normal pace of Northern California life. 
</P>
<P>
Power was restored to all but about 100,000 customers, and many people returned 
to offices and schools. Unlike Wednesday, when most people stayed home, there 
was even commuter traffic snarls. By mid-afternoon the Bay Area Rapid Transit 
system, which briefly shut down its transbay tube for inspection Wednesday 
night, was running at 70% of normal and considering extending its hours to 
operate all night. 
</P>
<P>
But earthquakes are fickle phenomena, and word also came Thursday that the Bay 
Bridge -- an integral institution of "normal life" in the Bay Area -- will be 
closed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
A thorough look at the damage inflicted by the quake found that an earlier 
estimate of reopening the bridge in three weeks was unrealistic, said Anita 
Yoder, a Caltrans spokeswoman in Sacramento.

Deukmejian issued an executive order that indefinitely suspended the collection 
of tolls during morning rush hour on three bridges that remain open over the 
Bay: the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, the San Mateo-Hayward Bridge and the 
Dumbarton Bridge. He requested that the independently run Golden Gate Bridge 
also suspend toll collection. 
</P>
<P>
The aftershocks, which shuddered as many as 5 million Bay Area residents out of 
their first restful night's sleep since Tuesday, hit especially hard in Santa 
Cruz County and put more urgency behind plans to airlift disaster aid into the 
Santa Cruz area and Watsonville. 
</P>
<P>
California 17, the main link used by 20% of Santa Cruz residents to reach jobs 
in the San Jose area, suffered new damage and will be closed at least three 
more weeks, county spokeswoman Dinah Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
Sewage from broken lines is being diverted into Monterey Bay and the county 
declared Santa Cruz beaches unsafe for swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
Water, gasoline, medical supplies and shelters for displaced families who may 
be drenched by rains in the forecast were in short supply Thursday. More than 
1,000 people are staying in shelters in the Santa Cruz area. 
</P>
<P>
Food was also running short at local markets. 
</P>
<P>
"All they had was Twinkies," said Kristen Jensen, a UC Santa Cruz student. 
</P>
<P>
Three separate airlifts were planned to bring medical supplies and provisions 
into Santa Cruz County. A plane from Santa Barbara left in the morning to ferry 
medical supplies to three hospitals in the Santa Cruz area. The Air National 
Guard plans to dispatch two helicopters from Mather Air Force Base to bring 
supplies into Santa Cruz and nurses to Watsonville. The Salvation Army also 
sent 9,500 gallons of water into Santa Cruz County 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Cruz County is partially isolated," said Tom Mullins of the state 
Emergency Medical Services Authority. "An estimated 5,000 to 6,000 residents 
are using trucked-in water and large numbers are also without power." 
</P>
<P>
At least 201 homes and apartment buildings and 72 commercial structures 
sustained serious damage. Emergency shelter is needed because rain -- predicted 
to fall in the next few days -- would make camping out more difficult for 
displaced families. 
</P>
<P>
Towns in the hills above Santa Cruz where the big earthquake was centered took 
the worst brunt of it. Two-thirds of the 450 homes in the hamlet of Loma Prieta 
were damaged, in Boulder Creek 60 buildings had major damage or were destroyed 
and in Scotts Valley, 35 buildings were damaged. Nearby in Zayante 25 buildings 
had major damage. 
</P>
<P>
Electricity was expected to be restored in the hills by the weekend but water 
supply remained a problem. 
</P>
<P>
In Watsonville farther south, hundreds of people took to the streets after the 
strongest aftershock at 3:15 a.m. Seismic labs estimated that the shock was 
between 4.5 and 5.0 magnitude. It collapsed an historic church steeple, forced 
closure of a bridge and set a fire that destroyed a mobile home. 
</P>
<P>
"We had lived in very poor houses and had saved all we could. We don't know 
where we are going to live now," said Berta Sandoval, whose farm worker family 
took refuge in Callaghan Park after their home -- just purchased in May after 
10 years of saving -- was knocked off its foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in Main Street looking at the damaged, 100-year-old St. Patrick's 
Catholic Church, Watsonville police officer Jim Ihlen said: "It breaks our 
hearts." The church almost certainly will have to be demolished. "It's our town 
symbol, a piece of history that's gone." 
</P>
<P>
Long lines formed at the few markets and gas stations open for business. 
Phillips said much of downtown Watsonville is closed, a one block area of the 
main street was virtually demolished and a levee was seriously damaged. More 
than 150 homes probably will be condemned, said City Clerk Lorraine Washington. 
Older brick and unreinforced concrete structures suffered the worst damage. 
</P>
<P>
Also in Watsonville, the Green Giant frozen food processing building lost 20 to 
40 million pounds of frozen food. That's a $5 million to $15 million loss, 
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Angry Residents 
</P>
<P>
Sixty miles away in the Marina District of San Francisco, Mayor Art Agnos 
mounted a van and tried to calm angry residents. They were upset that officials 
had kept them out of their homes and that bulldozers had begun changing the 
face of the trendy, well-to-do neighborhood by razing damaged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood has some of the nicest views in the city, but was built on 
fill over what used to be a cove on San Francisco Bay. The area suffered the 
city's worst quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
"Please understand we are doing our best to respond to the biggest crisis this 
city has faced since 1906," Agnos said. But the mayor was booed when it became 
clear that 50 to 100 buildings would be condemned, and that other residents 
would be kept out of their homes indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
At the Nimitz Freeway in west Oakland, a large crowd of onlookers watched the 
retrieval efforts, and hot dog vendors -- who began arriving soon after the 
freeway collapsed -- did a brisk business feeding rescue workers and 
spectators. 
</P>
<P>
Police and fire crews from Los Angeles and other cities were also on the scene 
shooting videotape to be used in training their own disaster teams. 
</P>
<P>
Construction workers using blow torches and jackhammers and a "mini-max" 
concrete cutter hoisted atop the rubble by helicopter methodically broke up 
concrete slabs of freeway. Cranes eight stories high then plucked out the 
chunks of concrete and the flattened cars. Workers said it could take six days 
of around-the-clock work to dismantle the huge pile of debris. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Stark, assistant chief of the Oakland Fire Department, said that the 
meticulous process begins with two teams of 10 firefighters who map and measure 
each 80-foot pillar-to-pillar section of the freeway, plotting where cuts in 
the top level must be made to reach vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mapping Code 
</P>
<P>
Searchers quickly developed a code for that mapping process. Where they found a 
car 40 feet toward the center of a section, they spray-paint "40" on a pillar, 
and where no cars are found, they write "MT" for "empty." The letters "DOA" for 
"dead on arrival" designate location of a body. 
</P>
<P>
When cars were extricated, police and coroner's deputies worked to identify the 
human remains. But the process was going slowly. 
</P>
<P>
Stark said the teams were finding only about three cars in each of the 
approximately 40 smashed sections of the freeway -- fewer than officials 
originally estimated. But dozens of the "DOA" symbols were painted near the 
southern pancaked portion of the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a couple of cars up there that are six or seven inches high. It's 
pretty gruesome," said Brock Settlemier, president of Biggie Crane &amp; 
Rigging Co. of San Leandro, which provided the cranes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unbelievable how the cars are crushed," Oakland police Sgt. Bob Crawford 
said. "It looks like somebody took some tinfoil, just wadded it up and threw it 
away." 
</P>
<P>
At dawn Thursday, near the end of the 1 1/4-mile-long collapsed stretch of 
Interstate 880, workers hauled out a crushed Japanese Acura automobile 
virtually unrecognizable except for the steering wheel, which was intact. A 
human arm was the only identifiable body part seen. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like if he had a few more seconds he would have been out of there," 
said Joe Everett, a construction worker. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Getreau of the Milpitas Fire Department said he helped remove a mother and 
a little girl, about 7, whose book was stuck on the inside of their car's 
intact windshield. Workers, wearing gloves, needed a little more than an hour 
to lift out the bodies after the tops of cars were cut off. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not difficult," Getreau said, "except for the emotional part." 
</P>
<P>
The morning's aftershocks did no apparent new damage. But Oakland Police Capt. 
Jim Hahn said some space between layers had settled through the night. Crawl 
spaces that were once four feet high had shrunk to inches, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In downtown Santa Cruz, friends of Robin Ortiz, 22, stood watch Thursday as 
workers searched for her inside the fallen-down Santa Cruz Coffee Roasting Co. 
For many it had been a two-day vigil, marred when five of the friends were 
arrested for objecting when police called off the search Wednesday night 
because of darkness and danger from aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 friends had gathered outside the shop in the Pacific Garden Mall, 
chanting her name, "Robin, Robin," and singing folk songs. Ortiz, a popular 
employee of the shop, was last heard yelling at patrons to evacuate during the 
main quake, which caused the roof to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Her body was finally pulled from the debris Thursday afternoon. The body of one 
man had already been pulled out, and his injured girlfriend was rescued. 
</P>
<P>
In Salinas in Monterey County, David Harris of the Office of Emergency Services 
said the earthquake and its aftershocks had damaged 50 homes and seven 
commercial structures. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, state officials also described the extent of damage to the 
Bay Bridge, which connects San Francisco with the East Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Before heavy equipment can be taken onto the bridge to make repairs, engineers 
have decided that the Oakland reach of the four-mile-long bridge needs to be 
reinforced. That process will take about a week, the state Department of 
Transportation announced. 
</P>
<P>
Once the bridge is stabilized, crews will use a crane to remove part of the 
upper deck and place it on a barge moored in the bay. A 30-foot piece of the 
upper deck, which carries cars headed into San Francisco, collapsed during 
Tuesday's main quake onto the lower deck where traffic was bound for Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
The upper deck will be repaired on the barge, then lifted back into position on 
the bridge. But before the repaired section can be fitted back on the bridge, 
engineers must fix the lower deck too. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the East Bay is linked with San Francisco by ferries, the 
underwater Bay Area Rapid Transit system tube, and by long drives around the 
bay to the Golden Gate or San Mateo bridges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Art Museum Damage 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco Chronicle and San Francisco Examiner printed special, smaller 
editions without ads again Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The quake toll in San Francisco was found Thursday to include at least $5 
million damage to the Asian Art Museum, the largest collection of Asian art in 
the Western world, and unspecified but serious damage at the the Mexican 
Museum, home to one of the worlds' largest Mexican collections outside of that 
country. 
</P>
<P>
But the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum and the California Palace of the Legion 
of Honor, two of San Francisco's best-known institutions, did not suffer 
serious damage. 
</P>
<P>
Some damage may not be detected for months. State officials inspected hundreds 
of miles of fragile levees in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, finding 
only minor cracks and seepage in isolated spots. 
</P>
<P>
Officials fear that the quake could have weakened already leaky levees that are 
vital to Northern California's recreation and ecology and California's water 
system. Coming rains could add further strain. 
</P>
<P>
This story was written by Times staff writers Kevin Roderick and Myrna Oliver 
in Los Angeles based on staff reports from the Bay Area.

REPAIRING THE BAY BRIDGE 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans engineers have devised a novel plan to repair the San 
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, the transportation backbone of the area that is 
used by 480,000 commuters daily. A Caltrans spokeswoman said the repair -- in 
which a crane will move the damaged span to a nearby barge -- will take from 
three weeks to two months. 
</P>
<P>
1. Support towers and lower roadway will be reinforced in order to stabilize 
damaged area. 
</P>
<P>
2. The damaged upper span will be picked up by barge-mounted crane and moved to 
a second barge alongside the bridge for repair. 
</P>
<P>
3. While work proceeds on upper span, another crew will repair holes in the 
lower span. The upper span will then be replaced and reattached to tower 
supports.

BUSH PLANS 3-HOUR TOUR OF QUAKE AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush will take a three-hour tour today of Northern California areas 
damaged by the earthquake. He will spend much of his time in a helicopter, 
stopping only in Oakland and Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll do as much as we can without disrupting local activities," White House 
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is to fly to Moffett Naval Air Station near Mountain View and take a 
helicopter to Alameda on the east side of the San Francisco Bay, and then drive 
to Oakland to view the collapsed Interstate 880. 
</P>
<P>
He will then go back to Alameda for a helicopter ride to Santa Cruz, where 
there is extensive damage. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos -- who had criticized an earlier 
helicopter tour by Vice President Dan Quayle as being nothing more than a 
publicity stunt -- was invited to accompany Bush on Friday, along with the 
mayors of Oakland and Alameda.

<P>
Disasters are times of peril for politicians. The wrong move or a misspoken 
word at a crucial moment can damage a career. Just ask former governors Edmund 
G. (Pat) Brown and his son, Jerry, and, perhaps now, Vice President Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
The senior Brown, touring a catastrophic North Coast flood during his second 
term, proclaimed to the news media that "this is the worst disaster since I was 
elected governor." Everybody got a good laugh except Brown and his advisers. 
</P>
<P>
Two decades later, his governor son became the subject of ridicule and 
criticism for not taking the Medfly seriously and delaying spraying until the 
tiny fruit pest had spread almost out of control. His career suffered severely 
and he lost a Senate bid in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Quayle flew into San Francisco to tour earthquake destruction and 
did not meet with Mayor Art Agnos. Both sides offered conflicting reasons. Only 
one thing was known for sure: the Republican vice president and the Democratic 
mayor got into a long-distance, public shouting match. 
</P>
<P>
Agnos said he was "ticked off" and added: "I have real questions about what he 
was doing here. It may have been just a publicity stunt." Quayle responded by 
denouncing Agnos' "political rhetoric." And White House spokesman Marlin 
Fitzwater accused the mayor of "not cooperating." But Agnos probably got the 
better of the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Observed one California political strategist for Republican candidates, who did 
not want to be identified: "The predominant wisdom is that he (Quayle) isn't 
very capable. So whenever there's a doubt about something he does, that wisdom 
is reinforced among the public. It may be unfair, but he's the loser. What you 
can't do is what he did. You can't just stiff somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle's visit illustrated again that when a disaster strikes, the resulting 
public spotlight attracts politicians like moths and, like moths, they can get 
burned. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco this week has been inundated by politicians -- Gov. George 
Deukmejian, Republican Sen. Pete Wilson and Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston, and 
countless members of Congress and the Legislature. President Bush will visit 
Oakland and Santa Cruz today. 
</P>
<P>
All these elected officials have legitimate reasons for touring scenes of 
disaster. They represent the afflicted citizens and hold the power to help ease 
suffering. But, as Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) pointed out Thursday, 
"what you don't want to do is to look like -- or be -- an ambulance chaser. 
That is totally inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights), who toured the Bay Area 
Wednesday in his capacity as chairman of the Joint Legislative Committee on 
Disaster Services, acknowledged: 
</P>
<P>
"Politicians invariably suffer from foot-in-mouth disease. And the chances of a 
severe attack are greatly enhanced during the time of a disaster. The desire to 
see their name in print or face on television is all-consuming. And you don't 
know if it's going to come out good or bad." 
</P>
<P>
Generally, disasters are more fraught with peril than they are ripe with 
opportunity for politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Steven A. Merksamer, former chief of staff to Gov. Deukmejian, recalled that 
"my biggest fear always was of not being prepared for a major disaster -- and 
one thing about living in California is we have them. How they are handled can 
make or break elected officials." 
</P>
<P>
Merksamer disclosed that during the governor's first term "we spent a lot of 
time drilling for disasters. We would have mock prison riots, mock earthquakes 
-- eight-hour drills when we would practice making decisions, several times a 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Always fresh in the mind of Deukmejian and his top advisers, Merksamer said, 
was Jerry Brown's "Medfly crisis." And they also indelibly remembered another 
chapter of California political history: When Pat Brown was on vacation in 
Greece during the Watts riot. "Where was Pat?" became a one-liner in Ronald 
Reagan's victorious campaign against Brown in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, it was Deukmejian's instant reaction to immediately return home when he 
heard of the disastrous earthquake shortly after 1 a.m., local time, while on a 
trade mission in Frankfurt, West Germany. That was part of the drill practiced 
time and again in his office. 
</P>
<P>
"When the ship's in trouble it's appropriate for the captain to be in charge," 
noted Merksamer. "But there's a fine line public relationswise. It's bad 
government and it's bad politics to be seen as trying to take advantage of any 
kind of a disaster for personal political reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Stuart K. Spencer, a veteran political consultant who managed campaigns for 
Reagan, said candidly that during a disaster "the biggest problem is not doing 
something. You do something -- even if it's wrong. The real peril is getting 
frozen in inaction -- being afraid to make a mistake. If a person goes by their 
natural instincts, they're going to do the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
Bush is the most recent example of a politician accused of inaction during a 
crisis. He was sharply criticized for responding sluggishly to two disasters -- 
the Exxon oil spill and Hurricane Hugo. When he got a third chance, after the 
Northern California earthquake, the President moved quickly and with high 
visibility to, as he said, "take every step and make every effort to help the 
Bay Area." 
</P>
<P>
A page in the chapter of Pat Brown's Grecian vacation was that his lieutenant 
governor, Glenn Anderson, got frozen in inaction. "He hesitated when he should 
have acted" in calling out the National Guard during the Watts riots, a 
blue-ribbon commission later asserted. And it probably cost Anderson reelection 
in 1966. He was later elected to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
For a few hours Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, until Deukmejian arrived 
back in California, Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy was the acting 
governor. And "one of the things on his checklist," recalled chief of staff Kim 
Cranston, was to "seriously consider" calling out the National Guard. He 
decided against it after conferring with local officials who reported little 
looting. 
</P>
<P>
"These (disaster) situations bring out the best and worst in people because 
you're under stress," said Cranston, son of the senator. "You have to make 
quick decisions. You can't sit back and develop strategy. There's no time for 
that."

CONGRESS SEES NEED TO PROVIDE $2.5 BILLION IN EMERGENCY AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congress moved swiftly Thursday to put together a massive package of emergency 
aid for earthquake-stricken Northern California, and lawmakers predicted that 
the assistance will exceed $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the Bay Area quake a "terrible disaster," House Speaker Thomas S. Foley 
(D-Wash.) said congressional leaders will ask the House to approve the funding 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're looking at somewhere around $2.5 billion minimum," Foley said. 
He added that the amount might go higher as the scope of the damage caused by 
Tuesday's earthquake becomes clearer. 
</P>
<P>
Foley said the relief funds will have to increase the federal deficit if they 
cannot be siphoned away from other programs. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, he predicted strong bipartisan support in both the House and Senate 
for such a move, which would require a waiver of the Gramm-Rudman deficit 
reduction limits for fiscal year 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"To put it bluntly, if the deficit has to go up, then it has to go up," Foley 
said. "If we need a waiver of Gramm-Rudman, then that will have to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Congress, responding to Hurricane Hugo's destructive swing across the Caribbean 
and the Carolinas last month, recently appropriated $1.1 billion in additional 
general disaster relief funds. Of that amount, only $275 million is available 
for California because the hurricane-struck areas received most of the money. 
</P>
<P>
Several members of California's congressional delegation, appearing with Foley 
at a news conference, expressed confidence that Congress will act quickly on 
several legislative measures already drafted or being planned to replenish the 
depleted disaster funds. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that an emergency like this will need a very significant 
and immediate bipartisan reaction by members of both houses," said Rep. Jerry 
Lewis (R-Redlands). 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento) said he will introduce an amendment in the House 
Appropriations Committee on Monday to raise money for the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) and several other federal agencies that are providing 
disaster relief. 
</P>
<P>
Fazio said he will not know the exact amount of the request until Monday 
morning, when the Office of Management and Budget, FEMA and other federal and 
state agencies have promised to furnish a more accurate estimate of damage 
caused by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
Fazio said he anticipates that FEMA will need between $600 million and $1 
billion in additional funds for California disaster assistance. The Small 
Business Administration probably will need $1 billion, he said, and the 
Transportation Department at least another $800 million to repair the San 
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, the Nimitz Freeway and other roads and bridges 
damaged by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
Fazio said he expects the Appropriations Committee to speed through its review 
of the proposal and send the measure to the House floor on Tuesday, with Senate 
consideration likely next week. 
</P>
<P>
The funding is to be provided in a continuing resolution, which is a 
legislative mechanism that permits federal agencies to operate pending the 
approval of their regular appropriations. 
</P>
<P>
Although Fazio said the continuing resolution will be the primary vehicle for 
disaster relief, several other measures were also being drafted to provide 
emergency assistance to Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, Steve Symms (R-Ida.) planned to introduce legislation to lift 
the $100-million cap on federal funds available to individual states for 
emergency highway repairs. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Symms, the ranking Republican on the Senate Environment and 
Public Works subcommittee on transportation and infrastructure, said the 
legislation will be introduced "as soon as we get word from California on 
what's needed." 
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the House Public Works and Transportation Committee, Rep. Glenn 
M. Anderson (D-San Pedro), said legislation will also be needed to waive 
restrictions barring the use of federal funds to repair toll bridges, including 
the partly collapsed Bay Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a rule that says you can't use federal money on a toll bridge, but 
we're already working on legislation to waive that in this case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said at least $1 billion will be needed for highway and bridge repairs 
after the quake. Fazio said he expects the federal government to assume "100% 
of the cost" of repairing interstate highways. 
</P>
<P>
Although most legislators agreed with Fazio that Congress must act with "speed 
and bipartisan spirit" to raise adequate relief funds, the amount that will be 
required is certain to force agonizing debates in both houses over where the 
money will come from. 
</P>
<P>
"We are talking to all the subcommittee people to see where we can squeeze the 
best without killing other projects in these very difficult budget times," 
Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Although legislators face a tough choice between either raising the federal 
deficit or making more cuts in already pared-back programs, Foley said that 
issue is secondary to the "obligation we have to meet our responsibilities for 
disaster relief." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. military forces continued to provide assistance to the 
quake-stricken region. 
</P>
<P>
By Thursday, Gov. George Deukmejian had called up 1,173 California National 
Guardsmen for the recovery operations. The troops are engaged in medical 
evacuation, damage assessment from the air and ground and engineering support. 
</P>
<P>
Guard medical units have set up field stations and hospitals at Travis, 
McClellan and Mather Air Force bases. 
</P>
<P>
Equipped with four C-130 transport jets and 12 helicopters, the National Guard 
is also hauling emergency workers and equipment to the Bay Area.

</P>
<P>
SAFETY: REGULAR CHECKS HAD TURNED UP CRACKS AND CHIPS IN THE CONCRETE PILLARS,

<P>
Regular state inspections of the section of the Nimitz Freeway that collapsed 
in Tuesday's earthquake found the structure to be in sound condition, despite 
the presence of numerous cracks and chips in the concrete pillars supporting 
the elevated highway. 
</P>
<P>
The reports show that some of the cracks exposed the steel inside the 
structure's concrete casing, allowing water to seep through and rust the 
reinforcements. 
</P>
<P>
But a top California Department of Transportation maintenance official said the 
items cited in 32 years of inspection reports released Thursday in no way 
contributed to the catastrophic collapse, which killed at least 18 people who 
were crushed in their cars when the roadway's upper level fell onto the lanes 
below. The drivers and passengers in an undetermined number of other cars 
remain unaccounted for. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing I have seen in these reports either gave the writer of those reports 
or me any concern" that it would not withstand a quake of Tuesday's magnitude, 
said Elvin Klein, branch chief of Caltrans' structural maintenance office. 
</P>
<P>
Klein said the cracks are typical of freeways everywhere. "It is not cause for 
alarm," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Drago, a Caltrans spokesman, added: "The collapse of the freeway was in no 
way related to any of the normal wear and tear that was listed in these 
inspection reports over the course of the years and addressed." 
</P>
<P>
The annual inspections began in 1957, the year the eight-lane, double-decked 
freeway opened as a state-of-the-art facility near the Bay Bridge in Oakland. 
The reports detail everything from sagging of the freeway decks to bumpy 
roadways, from drainage problems to the presence of graffiti on the structure. 
</P>
<P>
In 1957, the freeway was reported to be in "excellent condition throughout." In 
1960, an inspector found the Nimitz to be "in good structural condition." Later 
reports itemize the cracks and other flaws but give no overall assessment of 
the freeway's structural integrity. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, the reports use technical language and it is unclear what 
conclusions can be drawn from the findings. 
</P>
<P>
In 1959, for instance, an inspector found "vertical cracks" in a column near 
where the freeway collapsed Tuesday. "Water seeps through the column and has 
rusted the reinforcing," the inspector wrote. No corrective action was 
recommended. 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, Caltrans found "numerous diagonal tension cracks" in the 
exterior girders. "The size and number of cracks on the easterly side of the 
structure appear to have increased considerably during the past year," the 
inspector wrote. 
</P>
<P>
In 1966, an inspector said that the back wall of one of the bridge abutments 
was cracking and said it appeared that the "superstructure is transmitting 
higher than anticipated . . . forces on the abutment back wall." 
</P>
<P>
The Times asked several earthquake experts to evaluate the reports. One of 
them, Vitelmo Bertero, UC Berkeley professor of earthquake engineering, said 
the cracks inspectors found in reinforced concrete girders are "structural 
cracks." 
</P>
<P>
"I have been one of those who has called attention to these," Bertero said, 
adding that he had sent his students to look at the cracks before the collapse. 
"I've been scared about these." 
</P>
<P>
But even though Bertero has long been concerned about the apparent cracking, 
after inspecting the collapsed structure, he said he is convinced that the 
cross-beam cracks were not the cause of the failure during the quake. "What 
failed are the columns," he said. 
</P>
<P>
An engineering professor at another California university, who asked not to be 
identified, agreed with Bertero's assessment of the bridge inspection reports. 
He said that failure to do proper maintenance can cause structural problems. 
But, he said, "Nothing clearly points to that." The description of structural 
cracking is more troublesome, he said, but may not prove to be relevant to the 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
A UC San Diego earthquake engineer said Thursday that the collapse of the top 
deck of the freeway was caused by failed joints that linked the roadway with 
reinforced columns. Nigel Priestly, a structural engineering professor, said 
there was "virtually no reinforcement" in the joints even though the design was 
"state of the art" for the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether the inspection reports found maintenance problems 
related to the joints. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gov. George Deukmejian announced the formation of an independent 
commission to conduct an inquiry into the freeway collapse. He named Ian G. 
Buckle, deputy director of the National Center for Earthquake Engineering 
Research, to head the task force. 
</P>
<P>
"I want answers to the pertinent architectural questions as soon as possible," 
the governor said in a statement. "This independent team comprised by leading 
structural engineering experts from throughout the nation will give us these 
answers." 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the commission have not been named, but will include 
representatives from the National Transportation Safety Board, the Federal 
Highway Administration, research institutions and private corporations, the 
governor's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Buckle, in an opinion article published in The Times on Thursday, defended 
Caltrans' record in upgrading the state's freeways to prevent destruction in an 
earthquake. He said the department had followed a proper strategy of fixing the 
simplest problems first and saving the most difficult problems -- such as the 
San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and the Nimitz Freeway double-decking -- for 
last. 
</P>
<P>
"Now is not the time for knocking Caltrans," Buckle wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Buckle's statement, Deukmejian Press Secretary Kevin Brett said the 
governor was confident that the earthquake expert from Buffalo, N.Y., would 
conduct a thorough investigation of the freeway collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe he is going to be objective in his evaluation," Brett said. "We are 
certain he is going to be critical where he needs to be critical. We want the 
facts, and those facts may not be pretty, because we don't want to see this 
tragedy happen again."

OAKLAND LOOKS BEYOND CRISIS TO START MAPPING WAY OUT OF TRANSIT MESS

<P>
The city of Oakland is not yet able to sweep aside the debris left by Tuesday's 
earthquake, pick up the pieces and get on with life. So, much of the city's 
attention is still riveted on the tragic crumple of concrete and steel of the 
Cypress section of the Nimitz Freeway, where untold quake victims are still 
buried. 
</P>
<P>
But while much of the city and the world focused on the Nimitz tragedy, 
officials of public and private transportation agencies were meeting Thursday 
to devise ways to keep Oakland humming as the transportation hub of the Bay 
Area. 
</P>
<P>
The Nimitz, or Interstate 880, and the damaged San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge 
play a role in the city's economy. They are the major routes for moving goods 
in all directions from the Port of Oakland, warehouses and other manufacturing 
plants that provide a significant number of jobs in the city. 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, transportation concerns have found alternate routes around 
the collapsed portion of the freeway, according to Mel Wax, public affairs 
director for the port. 
</P>
<P>
Trucks headed for San Francisco have been rerouted north to Richmond, where 
they cross the bay and head south across the Golden Gate Bridge to San 
Francisco, he said. Traffic headed for the South Bay from Oakland is crossing 
the San Mateo Bridge, he said. At a meeting called by the Metropolitan 
Transportation Commission, barge companies agreed to haul trucks across the bay 
until the damaged portion of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is repaired. 
</P>
<P>
But while everyone has improvised for the time being, some business people are 
worried about life without the Nimitz link once business gets back to normal 
and the city streets are clogged with traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Along the shoreline and at port facilities just west of the Nimitz are dozens 
of warehouses, light and heavy manufacturing plants and transportation 
specialty companies that rely on the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of these companies is Jorgensen Steel, which serves as a service and 
distribution center for steel mills and their customers around the country. 
Jorgensen has been a West Oakland staple since the mid-1930s. Some of its 71 
employees were among the first on the scene Tuesday to help rescue survivors of 
the freeway collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Like much of the rest of the city, Jorgensen's attention has remained on the 
Nimitz tragedy, but on Thursday its managers began to assess the changes that 
the disastrous quake will bring to the business. 
</P>
<P>
The company stopped shipping after the quake, but it expects to begin sending 
out trucks today, according to general manager Lawrence Paparelli. Once its 
trucks are back on the road, they will use city streets to get around the 
collapsed freeway. However, Paparelli foresees great turmoil for Oakland's 
traffic once the army of commuters and shippers return to normal schedules. 
"The 880 has always been a main artery," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the Oakland Convention Centers have had two cancellations because 
event sponsors were concerned about access to the centers. The centers have 
always attracted a certain amount of business because of the easy access to San 
Francisco's cultural, dining and night spots provided by the Bay Bridge and Bay 
Area Rapid Transit (BART) trains. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Patterson, general manager of the centers, was reviewing the calendar 
Thursday for other potential trouble spots. "We're concerned (about the 
potential loss of business). The problem may get bigger. I'm hoping BART is the 
answer," Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear what the financial impact of the loss of the bridge and the 
collapse of the freeway will be. Mayor Lionel Wilson on Thursday put the losses 
to the city at $1.3 billion, exclusive of the loss involving the Nimitz 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Oakland boosters were rallying Thursday to convince the world that 
the quake and its disastrous results would not stall Oakland's redevelopment, 
which, when disaster struck, appeared to be finally on track after decades of 
fits and starts. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in the city seven years. For a long time, I watched one of the great 
cities growing very slowly," said Henry Feldman, vice president of the 
Claremont Hotel in the hills above downtown Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of location, great ports, great infrastructure and strong facilities, 
the city has unlimited potential. As San Francisco becomes more and more a 
difficult place to do business, Oakland can't help but succeed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the city has attracted significant office development to its 
downtown, in part because of the high land prices and development restrictions 
in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"Oakland in every sense is in a terrific position," said Glenn Isaacson, 
executive vice president of Bramalea Pacific, which is developing City Center, 
a 16-block collection of office buildings and small retail shops. Thus far, the 
development is home to Clorox Corp., International Business Machines, Wells 
Fargo and American President Lines. 
</P>
<P>
Another major project is Jack London's Waterfront, a $110-million office and 
retail project being developed on the waterfront by the port in a joint venture 
with private concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland's major problem is its image, said Perry C. Page, the Rouse Co.'s vice 
president for redevelopment on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Rouse, which is developing a major shopping center in downtown Oakland, 
initially passed on the city, he said. But watching Oakland since 1981, the 
company realized that there is "tremendous growth there -- a lot more than 
meets the eye," he said. The city actually has great demographics -- that is, 
lots of high-income people -- for retailing, he said. Such facts convinced 
major department stores to anchor the mall. Nordstrom, Macy's, J.C. Penney and 
Emporium Capwell have agreed to join.

As rescuers ever so slowly untangled the dead from the wreckage of an Oakland 
freeway Thursday, clusters of loved ones of the missing gazed up at the ruins 
with agony in their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"I have hope as long as there are people still working, as long as we know 
there are air pockets up there, I have hope," said Daniel Rubi, whose 
28-year-old son was believed to have been on the Nimitz Freeway when part of it 
collapsed in Tuesday's earthquake. Rubi's son, a father of 8-year-old twin 
boys, had not been heard from since the earthquake struck. 
</P>
<P>
Like other distraught family members and friends of the missing, Rubi was 
bitter that more was not being done. "When we try to get close," he said, "the 
police just say, 'Step back or you will be arrested.' " 
</P>
<P>
The scene Rubi and others so sadly surveyed offered them only more pain. At 
dawn, as a crane lifted out what once had been an Acura automobile, only the 
steering wheel and a human arm could be discerned in the twisted metal. Many 
vehicles had been flattened to a height of only seven inches. Everywhere, there 
were pools of blood and by day's end, the air was filled with the stench of 
death. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unbelievable how (the vehicles) are crushed," said one Oakland policeman. 
"It looks like somebody took some tinfoil, just wadded it up and threw it 
away." 
</P>
<P>
A crew of 200 workers were combing through the rubble Thursday, searching 
without success for survivors and extricating vehicles and bodies. By day's 
end, officials said a total of 18 bodies and 45 vehicles had been recovered. 
Most of the victims in those vehicles were believed to have been rescued 
Tuesday night. Twenty-seven vehicles remained trapped between the two decks of 
the elevated section that had toppled. Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson said 83 
motorists were believed missing, fewer than initially believed. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland Asst. Fire Chief Andy Stark said 35 of 44 freeway sections involved in 
the collapse had been repeatedly examined for survivors by workers with 
sophisticated detection equipment and by specially trained dogs. The remaining 
nine sections were "pancaked" or so badly mangled that rescuers could not get 
to them. 
</P>
<P>
"We're always hoping for miracles, but I am not confident we are going to find 
anyone else alive," Stark said. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Getreu, a rescuer from the Milpitas Fire Department, said workers used 
"jaws of life" to cut off the tops of vehicles and then lifted out the bodies 
with their hands. It took as long as four hours to remove each victim. Getreu 
removed the bodies of a woman and a little girl from one of the vehicles. The 
little girl, he said, appeared to have been reading a book when the quake 
struck. "It's not difficult except for the emotional part," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The day brought relief for some. Some who had not been heard from since the 
earthquake struck and were believed to have been killed on the freeway suddenly 
appeared. Among them was an Oakland attorney who had been missing for a day and 
a half. He showed up at his City Hall office Thursday, informing co-workers he 
had been sick with the flu. "One by one people are turning up," said Mayor 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Workers with heavy equipment tore at tons of concrete and metal girders on the 
freeway's upper deck, trying to crumble it into small pieces so it could be 
carted away and the vehicles below removed. The 90-foot freeway sections 
weighed 10,000 tons each and could not be dismantled in slabs. Workers 
concentrated first on areas where the cars would be easiest to reach, leaving 
the sections that had completely pancaked to the last. Cranes seven to eight 
stories high lifted off the cars, some still containing bodies. Rescuers said a 
rank odor permeated the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
As on Wednesday, the work proceeded slowly because officials feared too much 
equipment or movement might send the wobbly freeway section crashing to the 
ground. The section had sagged overnight, and pockets between the two decks 
that had been four feet high the day before were only inches apart on Thursday. 
A series of aftershocks might have contributed to the settling, but officials 
said they caused nothing to topple from the rubble. Gasoline and oil leaking 
from the vehicles posed fire hazards. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very dangerous under there," said Oakland Police Sgt. Bob Crawford. "They 
believe it could collapse at any moment." 
</P>
<P>
A team of medical examiners, wearing bright blue overalls and face masks, was 
assigned to each car that was removed to identify the victims. They searched 
through purses and wallets for clues. The bodies were then put in blue body 
bags and wheeled away on stretchers to be taken by ambulance to the morgue. 
Police publicized numbers for people to call for information on their missing 
loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Landswick and Bob Pratt, two Alameda County prosecutors, stared at the 
mangled freeway as though they were looking for someone. They were. A friend 
was believed trapped inside. "It's all a matter of timing (who got killed), and 
in this case, it's a matter of bad timing," said Pratt. The prosecutors feared 
that a colleague who had left the office to pick up her niece at 5 p.m. on 
Tuesday may have been on the freeway when it collapsed. No one had heard from 
her since. 
</P>
<P>
After waiting all day with no word of his son, Daniel Rubi confronted Mayor 
Wilson at a news conference at the scene. "Mayor, did you know you are directly 
responsible for this tragedy?" Rubi challenged. Police, recognizing Rubi was 
not a member of the media, took him away in a police car. A family member 
explained Rubi was overcome by grief, and police said they expected to release 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Smith also waited. Three friends had been missing since they left the 
East Bay for Tuesday's World Series game. "We will stay as long as it takes 
until they make us leave," said Smith, who had tried unsuccessfully to get 
through police lines. 
</P>
<P>
The wreckage drew more than just families and friends to the industrial 
neighborhood. People with cameras and video recorders came to take pictures and 
tape the carnage. Some watched from nearby rooftops. Members of the 
Revolutionary Communist Party exhorted the 100 spectators to demand to be 
allowed to help and they attacked the government for doing too little. 
Spectators applauded the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
And just as grief drew some, others came for different reasons. Dwight Jones, 
an auto-detailer who lives in nearby San Leandro, was a fortune seeker. He said 
he heard two armored cars had been crushed in the debris and he hoped he would 
find money when the winds kicked up. "I wish the wind would start blowing this 
way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneurs set up hot dog stands and passed out coupons for restaurants and 
Halloween costume stores. Rescuers took naps on cots alongside the freeway, 
using their hard hats to shade their eyes from the bright, warm sun. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Solorio, a rescue worker from the Army Reserve, said in the morning he 
and other rescuers were upset that they could not move more quickly. He said 
they saw several victims who didn't look badly injured. Although no one saw any 
movement or heard voices, rescuers, like the loved ones watching, had clung to 
the hope that someone might still be alive. 
</P>
<P>
From a distance of 25 feet, Solorio saw a couple sitting in the front seat of a 
Honda Prelude. Their eyes were closed. The front end of the car was crushed, 
and its windshield had shattered and caved in, but the top of the car remained 
intact. Solorio said he had wondered if they just might be unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
Steel girders were used to reinforce the precarious section, and some officials 
said the excavation was moving more rapidly than it had the first day. But Kyle 
Nelson, a spokesman for the California Department of Transportation, conceded: 
"It's very slow work. It's one section at a time. I've never seen damage this 
massive."

The multibillion-dollar Superfund toxic waste project is failing to clean up 
sites that pose an imminent danger while spending more than half of its 
resources on management, long-range studies and questionable technology, the 
Congressional Office of Technology Assessment said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The report was quickly criticized by both the Environmental Protection Agency, 
which said the study was outdated when it was released, and the chairman of the 
congressional panel that ordered the investigation, who termed the study too 
speculative. 
</P>
<P>
The two-year study contended that 50% to 70% of the $4.4 billion spent so far 
was used ineffectively by government and industry. 
</P>

Investigators estimated that half of the project's effort is being spent to 
study "speculative future risks," and that three-fourths of the cleanups are 
"unlikely to work over the long term." 
</P>
<P>
"The closer one gets to Superfund's implementation, the more that many cleanups 
look like decision-making has worked backward," the OTA concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The report also charged that the agency is allowing cheaper, less effective 
cleanups at some sites to encourage companies responsible for creating dumps to 
foot the bill voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
The OTA cited "a pattern of EPA selecting less stringent cleanup technologies 
to obtain voluntary or negotiated settlements with responsible parties 
(polluters)." Polluters may have saved as much as $1 billion in 1988 by using 
less effective cleanup methods, the report estimated. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reconcile competing interests in the massive undertaking, the report 
said, have created a "Superfund syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
"Analysis breeds paralysis as stakeholders with different perceptions of risk 
and different priorities fight data with data. Contractors keep busy, reports 
pile up, contamination spreads into soil and ground water, (and) many sites 
wait to get into the system." 
</P>
<P>
The EPA, which administers the much-criticized program launched eight years 
ago, estimates that it will need to add 900 sites to its current list of 1,200 
priority sites. 
</P>
<P>
But the OTA estimated that the number of new sites to be identified could be 10 
times that. 
</P>
<P>
"The nation," it said, "has probably spent only about 1% or 2% of what 
ultimately might be spent by all parties to clean up chemically contaminated 
sites -- now roughly estimated by OTA at $500 billion over 50 years." 
</P>
<P>
Created in 1980 as a crash program to get rid of toxic waste dumps, the program 
has spent about $4.4 billion, but the scope of the toxic waste problem has 
grossly outpaced the program's ability to react. The OTA suggested the project 
needs to be fundamentally reorganized. 
</P>
<P>
EPA officials suggested that much of the criticism leveled by the study already 
has been addressed since the Bush Administration named William K. Reilly head 
of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
The new administrator ordered an intensive review of the Superfund program last 
summer and recommended 50 substantive changes in it. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certainly benefits to be gleaned from the OTA report," said Lewis 
Crampton, a spokesman for the EPA. "There is a lot of overlap in what they 
cover and what we covered, but they do not give us credit for addressing a lot 
of the issues they talk about." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce 
Committee, criticized the study done for his panel. 
</P>
<P>
"I am extremely concerned," he said in a letter to OTA director John H. 
Gibbons, "that the constructive aspects of the report will be overshadowed by 
its excessive emphasis on speculative statistics. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, there is an overwhelming consensus among all parties (including 
EPA) that the Superfund program could and should make more efficient use of its 
resources. But I do not believe the report has presented persuasive evidence to 
support its conclusion that 50% to 70% of Superfund spending by government and 
industry has been inefficient, and I am troubled that this figure is likely to 
be misconstrued." 
</P>
<P>
In spite of limited progress, skyrocketing costs, public criticism and the 
staggering cost of getting rid of the dumps, the report declared the Superfund 
program should be extended by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"Lack of public confidence in Superfund and criticism of Superfund may cause 
some people to discount the real environmental problem and abandon the effort," 
it said. "With billions of dollars at stake . . . building public confidence in 
Superfund is more necessary than ever." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The Superfund toxic waste project was created in 1980 as a short-term, 
$1.6-billion cleanup effort. But it soon became clear the problem was not 
likely to be solved quickly or cheaply. In 1985, Congress reauthorized 
Superfund, adding $8.5 billion. To date, the fund has spent $4.4 billion but 
has cleaned up only a fraction of the 1,200 sites targeted. The new study for 
Congress estimates there could be 9,000 more toxic sites that need attention -- 
an effort it estimated would cost $500 billion over 50 years.

GALILEO ON PERFECT COURSE; SHUTTLE HAS COOLING TROUBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Galileo spacecraft was speeding along Thursday toward its eventual 
rendezvous with Jupiter, following a course so perfect that ground controllers 
will not have to make even a minor adjustment for at least 20 days. 
</P>
<P>
"It's doing good," said Ron Dittemore, a shuttle flight director at the Johnson 
Space Center. 
</P>
<P>
However, the ghost of Galileo lingered aboard the shuttle Atlantis, which sent 
the 3-ton spacecraft speeding on its historic expedition six hours after the 
shuttle was launched Wednesday from the Kennedy Space Center. It seems that 
Galileo's controversial nuclear generators may have temporarily messed up the 
air conditioning system in the crew's quarters. 
</P>
<P>
The five astronauts aboard the Atlantis were alternately either a little too 
cool or a little too warm during their first day on orbit, Dittemore said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to find a happy medium," he said at a press briefing here. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo carries about 48 pounds of plutonium, which gives off heat as it goes 
through radioactive decay. The heat, in turn, is converted to electricity to 
run the craft's many scientific instruments. 
</P>
<P>
While it was nestled in the Atlantis' cargo bay, excess heat was removed from 
Galileo by a cooling loop containing water, Dittemore said. The cooling loop 
was integrated into the shuttle's "total cooling system," he said, and it 
apparently added more heat than had been expected. 
</P>
<P>
That caused condensation in one of the cooling and heating ducts, which 
promptly turned to ice and blocked the system. The ice was eventually melted, 
but the temperature in the shuttle's cabin remained a bit chilly -- in the low 
70s -- Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo, meanwhile, was more than 200,000 miles away from Earth on Thursday. 
Its speed, relative to Earth, was 9,400 m.p.h. -- slightly more than half of 
the orbiting speed of the shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
With their primary mission already accomplished, the five astronauts aboard the 
Atlantis spent Thursday taking photographs of Earth in a program designed to 
examine trouble spots in the planet's environment, such as deforestation in the 
Brazilian rain forest. In addition, they activated a number of experiments, 
including one that will study the damage to the ozone layer that protects Earth 
from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle is scheduled to land Monday at Edwards Air Force Base in Southern 
California at 12:38 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Navy Capt. Donald E. Williams, 47, is the commander of the Atlantis. The other 
members of the crew are Michael J. McCulley, 46, the pilot, and Shannon W. 
Lucid, 46, Franklin Chang-Diaz, 39, and Ellen S. Baker, 36.

SOLAR FLARE HURLS RADIATION SURGE

A major solar flare on the sun Thursday hurled a surge of radiation toward the 
Earth that may disrupt communications and electrical power transmission over 
the next two days, government scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Cohen, a geophysical forecaster at the Space Environment Services Center 
run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colo., 
said he was sending alerts to electrical utilities in Canada and in the 
northern United States to expect possible power surges. 
</P>
<P>
Powerful solar flares can also affect satellites and spacecraft, but officials 
at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said they have evaluated 
the burst of energy and determined that astronauts on board the orbiting space 
shuttle Atlantis are not in any danger. 
</P>
<P>
"In the orbit we're in, at 160 mile altitude, it is no threat at all," said 
Ronald D. Dittemore, a flight director at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
A NASA spokesman said engineers were checking for any effect on Galileo, the 
probe released from Atlantis six hours after the space shuttle was launched 
Wednesday. Galileo on Thursday afternoon was more than 200,000 miles from Earth 
on its six-year journey to Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the GOES satellite first detected the solar flare at 5:30 a.m. PDT 
and that the X-rays from the flare surged higher than instruments on the 
satellite could measure. The flare was estimated at an X-13, a unit that 
measures X-ray flux. The GOES measures only up to X-12.

HEED NICARAGUA LESSON, SALVADORANS TOLD 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez met this week with the 
antagonists in El Salvador's civil war, he urged them to look to Nicaragua for 
lessons in how to make peace. 
</P>
<P>
"In Nicaragua, nobody asks any more how many died in the latest battle," Arias 
said. "They ask how the election campaign is going." 
</P>
<P>
As enemies in Nicaragua turn from bullets to ballots, the rightist government 
and Marxist rebels of El Salvador have launched their own effort to end Latin 
America's most intense conflict, a 10-year war that has cost an estimated 
70,000 lives. 
</P>
<P>
But the peculiarities of the Salvadoran war make it more intractable than the 
fading Nicaraguan war between the Sandinista government and U.S.-backed 
Contras. 
</P>
<P>
The Salvadoran government and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front 
agreed Sept. 15 in Mexico City to try to make peace "by political means in the 
shortest time possible" through monthly negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Their first round of substantive talks, however, reached an impasse here 
Wednesday. In three days, they agreed on nothing but to meet again in November. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, the Salvadoran talks mirror those the Sandinistas and Contras 
held in late 1987 and early 1988. While battle fatigue pushed the contenders to 
the table, diplomacy has worked against the guerrilla side in both countries. 
</P>
<P>
Poles apart in ideology, the FMLN rebels and the Contras ended up in the same 
bind -- both facing a government bolstered by the 1987 Central American peace 
agreement that aims to end rebel insurgencies. 
</P>
<P>
Within the limits of that five-nation accord, which brought Arias a Nobel Peace 
Prize, both rebel groups were obliged to recognize a regime they had fought to 
overthrow and to negotiate for little more than equal rights in a freer 
political system. 
</P>
<P>
In Nicaragua, peace talks broke down in June, 1988, but not before producing an 
informal truce that still holds. With the Contras weakened by a cutoff of U.S. 
military aid, the Sandinistas drove most of them into Honduras, then won a 
regional pact for the rebels' disarmament in exchange for early elections, set 
for Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody expects a quick settlement in El Salvador. But Arias and other optimists 
dare to predict that the ebbing tide of East-West conflict makes one 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani has proposed an immediate cease-fire; 
just as the Contras reacted to a similar Sandinista offer two years ago, the 
FMLN rejects it. 
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas say Cristiani is maneuvering politically to undermine them 
without making real concessions. As a prelude to a cease-fire, they demand 
fundamental reform of the constitution, the political system, the judiciary and 
the military. 
</P>
<P>
A Costa Rican official involved in both peace efforts said that sooner or later 
the FMLN will have to accept a cease-fire with few conditions, at least as a 
basis for further talks. 
</P>
<P>
"If not, they risk losing their credibility," he said. Recalling that the 
Contras "ceased to be a legitimate force" after breaking off their talks last 
year, he added that "the same thing could happen to the FMLN." 
</P>
<P>
The official said Arias privately pressed this view on the guerrillas, holding 
up the Nicaraguan cease-fire -- the so-called Sapoa agreement of March, 1988 -- 
as a model. 
</P>
<P>
FMLN leaders have listened to Arias with quiet dismay, rejecting his premise 
that the two conflicts can be treated equally. 
</P>
<P>
In their view, the FMLN is strong enough militarily to win concessions in 
return for a cease-fire, while the Contras were defeated on the battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
"Sapoa is a dirty word for the FMLN," rebel spokesman Arnoldo Ramos said. "It 
implies symmetry between our forces, which are self-sufficient, and the 
Contras, which are a mercenary army of the United States."

AQUINO BARS REELECTION BID WHEN TERM ENDS IN 1992; 
</P>

PHILIPPINES: THE SUCCESSOR TO MARCOS SAYS SHE WILL LEAVE PRESIDENCY TO WRITE 
HER MEMOIRS AND HELP THE POOR.

<TEXT>
<P>
On the eve of her second state visit to the United States, President Corazon 
Aquino of the Philippines ruled out running for reelection when her term 
expires in 1992, saying she has done her duty as a citizen and now wants to 
write a book. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino said Thursday in an interview that she could not foresee conditions 
under which she would seek a second term. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't see myself as having to run again," Aquino said. "I am not a 
traditional politician, and I really felt in 1986 that I had to do my part if 
we were to have a chance at restoring democracy here. I feel I have already 
done my duty insofar as being a citizen of this republic is concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Although her family and some supporters have urged her to run again, Aquino 
said she will leave Malacanang Palace to write her memoirs and join a 
non-government group to help the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino took office in February, 1986, as a self-described housewife who had 
helped lead a "people power" revolt that toppled Ferdinand E. Marcos. Her 
comments Thursday hardened previous statements in which she had indicated that 
she saw herself in a transitional political role. This seemed likely to 
increase the scramble of politicians and military officers eager to replace 
her. 
</P>
<P>
She has come under increasing criticism since the early glory days. Although 
her integrity is not questioned, polls show that her popularity has fallen amid 
charges that government policy has drifted, land reform plans are largely 
unfulfilled and political corruption, cronyism and ineptitude are endemic. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino brushes aside most complaints as the healthy workings of a vibrant, if 
fragile, democracy in which "almost nothing is left secret." Indeed, two dozen 
newspapers compete to provide the most lurid accounts of the most recent 
scandals. 
</P>
<P>
"I am realistic enough to know I can't possibly please everybody all the time," 
she said. "So long as I do what I think is right, then I think that is all that 
is asked of me. I have been called weak and indecisive (and) at the same time, 
I've been called vindictive and heartless. So take your pick." 
</P>
<P>
Aquino defended her administration's much-criticized record on human rights, 
and she acknowledged that no member of the military or police has been 
convicted of human rights abuse despite more than 500 cases being filed. Most 
of these cases, she said, were brought in connection with the 20-year battle 
against Communist rebels. 
</P>
<P>
"You must remember that where alleged violations of human rights are concerned, 
in almost all cases, these are insurgency-related," she said. "It is not as if 
these are just being done with no provocation from rebel groups." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the provocation, two international organizations, Asia Watch and 
Amnesty International, charge that the Philippine government has not done 
enough to stop vigilante or military violence against human rights lawyers, 
priests and other activists. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department has reported "signs of deterioration" in the human 
rights situation in 1988, although officials at the U.S. Embassy here have 
taken exception to that assessment. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino will visit the United States and Canada mostly to promote her country's 
economic recovery. Citing an economic growth rate of 6.7% last year, economic 
planners hope to lure enough investment to fuel the kind of development that 
has transformed virtually every other non-Communist country in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
The trip comes at a sensitive time. Although Aquino wants to convince foreign 
investors that her government is stable, she cited potential destabilization 
from both right and left as the reason for refusing to allow Marcos' burial 
here after his death last month in Hawaii. Her aides say they do not fear coup 
attempts in her absence. 
</P>
<P>
The trip also brings up a sensitive issue: family planning. With half the 
population of 58 million in poverty, the birth rate of 2.8% has undercut 
economic progress. The rate is up from 2.4% in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"We leave it to the couple to decide for themselves what is the best option," 
Aquino said, noting that most Filipinos are Roman Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
But critics say Aquino has decided to ignore the issue. Government inaction and 
bickering led the U.S. Agency for International Development, the largest 
foreign aid donor, to cut off family planning support early this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position was, once you get a program, you'll get new funds," a U.S. 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats here give Aquino high marks for restoring democracy, 
improving the economy and halting the growth of the Communist insurgency. But 
most say that beyond that, the record has been spotty. 
</P>
<P>
After three days in Canada, Aquino will arrive in New York on Nov. 7 to start a 
Philippine stock fund on Wall Street. She will meet President Bush in 
Washington, discuss debt relief with international bankers, dine on barbecue 
with oilmen in Dallas and stop in Los Angeles for five hours to meet local 
Filipinos before returning home Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino was accorded a hero's welcome when she last visited the United States in 
1986. "This time, she wants a no-frills state visit," said Deedee M. Siytangco, 
a palace spokeswoman. "It's a working trip."

COURT FREES 4 JAILED IN BRITISH PUB BOMBINGS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a landmark decision, a British appellate court Thursday exonerated three 
Irishmen and an Englishwoman serving life sentences for terrorist pub bombings 
near London in 1974 that killed eight people and injured 90. 
</P>
<P>
The three-judge panel acted after an attorney representing the government said 
the convictions of the so-called Guildford Four were based on evidence 
"concocted" by police investigators. 
</P>
<P>
The decision touched off calls for reviews of other cases of terrorist activity 
on behalf of the outlawed Irish Republican Army, which opposes British rule in 
Northern Ireland. It also spurred demands for new legal procedures that would 
give greater protection to accused criminals, particularly in cases that hinge 
on confessions. 
</P>
<P>
The Guildford Four, so called because the most lethal of the bombings took 
place in a town by that name southwest of London, originally confessed but then 
-- at their 1975 trial -- recanted and accused the police of coercion. 
Prosecutors offered no corroborating physical evidence. 
</P>
<P>
The convictions were upheld in 1977 even after three other people, all IRA 
members, confessed to the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
The four defendants were set free after Thursday's hearing. However, one of 
them, Paul Hill, 35, was immediately rearrested in connection with a life 
sentence he is serving concurrently for the murder of a British soldier in 
Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate court's action followed a long campaign on behalf of the four by 
such prominent groups and individuals as Amnesty International, two former home 
secretaries and the Archbishop of Canterbury. The British news media said it 
was the first time that an IRA terrorist conviction has been reversed in 
England. 
</P>

Defendant Gerard Conlon, 35, was the first to emerge from the courtroom. 
Shaking with emotion and flanked by his two sisters, Conlon shouted: "I've been

anything about."

SNOW BLITZES MIDWEST, CAUSING POWER OUTAGES

Trees in autumnal technicolor of crimson and gold turned suddenly white 
Thursday when a storm blitzed the Midwest with up to 6 inches of snow, causing 
power outages to more than 200,000 customers in Ohio, Indiana and Michigan, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the earliest snowfall on record for many cities, including Cincinnati 
and Dayton in Ohio, Indianapolis and St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Snow also fell in parts of Kentucky, where a firefighter was electrocuted by 
power lines downed by the snow. 
</P>
<P>
In Covington, Ohio, a man was killed when his car veered into the opposite lane 
of a snow-slickened highway and struck a pickup truck near Dayton, said Patty 
Carey of the Ohio Highway Patrol. The area had received 4 inches of snow. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe this," said Jan Fredbeck of Franklin, Ind., where 6 inches of 
snow fell. "We've got Halloween decorations up inside and they look so stupid 
now." 
</P>
<P>
John Robinson, a National Weather Service forecaster, said records dating back 
to about 1870 show no snowfall in Cincinnati as early as Oct. 19. It also was 
the earliest snowfall record for Dayton. 
</P>
<P>
In Kentucky, up to 4 inches of snow fell, knocking out power to up to 100,000 
customers stretched from Louisville to the state's north-central and 
northeastern sections. 
</P>
<P>
Indianapolis' snowfall of up to 6 inches was the deepest on record since the 
weather service began keeping records in 1885, said meteorologist John Curran 
of the weather service. It also broke a record for the earliest measurable 
snow, set on Oct. 20, 1916. 
</P>
<P>
Snow flurries in the eastern half of Missouri gave St. Louis its earliest 
snowfall on record. Like Indianapolis, it broke a record, set Oct. 20, 1916.

A 7-year-old girl who was once the nation's youngest liver transplant recipient 
was released from the hospital Thursday after being treated for internal 
bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
Jamie Fiske was the youngest transplant recipient in the country in 1982 when 
she got a new liver following a nationwide appeal by her father. Earlier this 
month doctors removed her enlarged spleen. She was hospitalized again a few 
days later for internal bleeding. 
</P>

Doctors said her condition had stabilized but that she would remain in the area

SENATE IGNORES VETO VOW; OKS ABORTION BILL

The Senate on Thursday sent President Bush legislation that permits federally 
financed abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest, despite 
the President's pledge to veto the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The language of the bill, which has assumed symbolic importance in the larger 
political war over the abortion issue, would ease a restriction in force for 
eight years on circumstances in which Medicaid will pay for an abortion sought 
by a poor woman. 
</P>
<P>
The 67-31 vote in the Senate Thursday provided final congressional passage of a 
spending bill, including the key provision on abortion, which the House 
approved in a vote last week. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would allow federal money to be spent on abortions for poor 
women who are victims of rape or incest and who "reported promptly" to law 
enforcement or public health authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Although the measure has become the object of intense effort on both sides of 
the abortion issue, there was little Senate discussion as it came to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Brock Adams (D-Wash.) said that Bush's promise of a veto would "cause 
enormous additional suffering" for poor victims of rape or incest. 
</P>
<P>
"Forcing women and children . . . to bear a child which is the result of rape 
or incest is unconscionable," Adams said. "This is about the right to have a 
choice regardless of financial circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Medicaid restrictions in the law since 1981 permit federal money for abortions 
only in cases where the life of the mother is endangered by her pregnancy. 
Medicaid financing for poor women's abortions has been restricted in one way or 
another since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
The abortion provision is part of a $156.7-billion measure to finance labor, 
health and education programs for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Bush last week said he was looking for "room for flexibility" on the issue and 
did not wish "conflict" on abortion -- an issue that has been troublesome for 
him throughout his political career. But this week he hardened his stand and 
promised the veto. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the Senate nor the House is expected to have the votes to override a 
veto.

FRONT-RUNNER DINKINS FACES STORMY WEATHER; 
</P>
<P>
MAYORALTY: N.Y. DEMOCRAT COMES UNDER SCRUTINY OVER STOCK TRANSFER TO HIS SON 
AND A CONTROVERSIAL PAYMENT TO A COMMUNITY ACTIVIST. 
</P>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manhattan Borough President David N. Dinkins has built a big lead in public 
opinion polls as he pursues his bid to become New York's first black mayor. But 
less than three weeks before the election, his campaign suddenly is facing its 
first sustained stretch of politically stormy weather. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters are questioning a stock transfer to his son and his campaign's 
payment of $9,500 in primary day "walking around money" to a controversial 
community activist with a criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
Even Mayor Edward I. Koch, who has pledged to support Dinkins, said Thursday 
that the issues being raised were legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
Koch, who was defeated by Dinkins in the Democratic primary and whose 
constituency Dinkins badly needs in the general election, also called on 
Dinkins to release an official city report by the Department of Investigation 
examining Dinkins' failure to pay income taxes two decades ago. Dinkins, who 
subsequently paid the taxes with all penalties, has apologized for his failure 
to file. 
</P>
<P>
In a move to deflect criticism and regain momentum, Dinkins released a highly 
unusual personal letter Thursday, attacking his GOP opponent, former U.S. Atty. 
Rudolph W. Giuliani, and his media adviser Roger Ailes, a key consultant in 
President Bush's winning White House bid. 
</P>
<P>
"I am determined not to let your consultant Roger Ailes do to me what he has 
done to other Democrats in other races, slandering their records and playing 
upon fear," Dinkins charged. 
</P>
<P>
"I am challenging you one last time to stop the gutter politics. . . . You and 
Mr. Ailes may have bullied people in the past. But if you persist on your 
present course, you will learn something I learned in the Marine Corps: Marines 
aren't very good at picking fights, but they certainly know how to end them." 
</P>
<P>
Giuliani's advisers said Dinkins' decision to play the "Ailes card" -- to seek 
to make the controversial media adviser an election issue -- was a sign that 
Dinkins' campaign was in difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Powers, Giuliani's campaign manager, labeled the letter a "subterfuge" 
and charged that Dinkins was canceling public appearances and news conferences 
to duck the media. 
</P>
<P>
"I would suggest that he is adopting a bunker mentality," he said. "Our 
television campaign has nothing to do with his current financial problem, and 
it is dishonest for him to even suggest that is the case." 
</P>
<P>
Giuliani has been airing a tough television commercial stressing, among other 
things, Dinkins' past tax troubles and his campaign's recent controversial 
payment to the community activist, including the tag line: "David Dinkins: Why 
does he always wait until he's caught?" 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Dinkins was scheduled to appear with Koch and other city officials 
at a building dedication in Brooklyn. But after being pressed by reporters at 
an earlier stop on the details of the stock transaction, the candidate skipped 
the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, New York Newsday reported that Dinkins' 588 shares of privately 
held stock in Inner City Broadcasting Co. were worth at least $2.5 million when 
he sold them to his son for $58,000 in 1986. The paper said that by 
undervaluing the stock, Dinkins potentially could have avoided paying a 
substantial capital gains tax. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for Dinkins said the candidate believed at the time that the value put 
on the stock was fair. 
</P>
<P>
But in an interview with the New York Times published in today's editions, 
Dinkins admitted that he had once placed a value of $1 million or more on the 
stock in a confidential form he filed with New York state in 1983. On a public 
disclosure document he filed with New York City the same year, he estimated the 
stock's value at between $20,000 and $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the discrepancy, Dinkins replied: "I really don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins said he was consulting with advisers on how to handle any potential tax 
problems and had selected the lower value without talking to lawyers or 
accountants. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, after he canceled a news conference, Dinkins issued a statement 
saying it was a mistake for members of his staff, sitting in for him at Board 
of Estimate meetings, to vote on two occasions on issues relating to the 
broadcasting company. Dinkins, an early investor in the company, had been 
advised by the New York City Board of Ethics not to vote on any issues 
involving the company. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of his payments to community activist Sonny Carson escalated Thursday 
when Carson called a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Carson, who was once convicted on a kidnaping charge and who organized a 
violent demonstration that forced police to close the Brooklyn Bridge last 
month, said the money he received was designed to help get out the vote and was 
not a payment to dampen down volatility. 
</P>
<P>
Carson angrily told reporters he wasn't anti-Semitic. "I'm anti-white," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
That remark prompted a quick rebuttal from Dinkins. 
</P>
<P>
"Sonny Carson's comments represent the kind of bigotry and intolerance I 
utterly reject and have fought against my whole life," Dinkins said in a 
statement. "Had such comments come to my attention, he never would have played 
any role in my campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Giuliani's strategists hope Dinkins' difficulties will begin to be reflected in 
the polls, which would make fund-raising easier. Even though President Bush 
raised $1.5 million at a dinner for Giuliani last week, finding substantial 
additional money has been hard. 
</P>
<P>
With less than three weeks before Election Day, various polls show Dinkins with 
a lead ranging from 19 to 24 points.

EL CAMINO'S NIU SALE: HE'S REAL COOL -- UNTIL THE GAME GETS GOING; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: THE SOPHOMORE DEFENSIVE BACK WAS AN ALL-AMERICAN LAST YEAR AND THIS 
SEASON ISN'T EXPECTED TO BE ANY DIFFERENT. HE LEADS THE TEAM IN TACKLES WITH 
47. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Seeing Niu Sale out of his football attire can be deceiving. The 19-year old 
sophomore from Carson appears relaxed, carefree and cool. Very cool. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week El Camino's All-American defensive back strutted across 
campus in a white tank top, black shorts, thongs and a large straw hat. A 
goatee, dark glasses and a black hoop earring complimented the outfit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a mellow guy," Sale said smiling. "I'm just relaxed all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Well, not all the time. He laughs often and has a silly pre-game ritual -- he 
eats a big hamburger with cheese and chicken nuggets before every game -- but 
when it comes to football, he's a very intense individual. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a winner," said El Camino co-defensive coordinator Steve Schmitz. "That's 
the bottom line. No matter where you put him, he'll do everything in his power 
to beat you." 
</P>
<P>
On the field the sturdy athlete seldom speaks. Actions do that for him whether 
he's returning a punt, holding the ball for a field goal or jumping on a ball 
carrier. 
</P>
<P>
"In football you don't talk with your mouth," Sale said. "You talk with your 
helmet. We wear Bike (brand) helmets so I tell the guys on the other team 'come 
ride a bike,' and when I get a good play I say 'you just rode a bike.' They 
hate it and they curse all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Negative words from bitter opponents don't bother Sale, whose large photo 
appears on the front of the Warriors' media guide. His performance is always 
top-notch. Aggression and quickness are his main trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
"When we need to put out the fire or make a big play," said Head Coach John 
Featherstone, "he always comes through." 
</P>
<P>
Featherstone says there aren't many football players with Sale's ability and 
dedication. The Warriors' fifth-year coach believes Sale is one of a kind. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been coaching junior college football for 14 years," he said, "and I 
really don't think I've seen a finer athlete than Niu. He's just a gifted, 
natural athlete." 
</P>
<P>
At 5-foot-9 and 190 pounds, Sale is not dominating, but speed and strength make 
up for his lack of size. He had 93 tackles and four interceptions last year as 
an All-American and all-Mission Conference free safety. 
</P>
<P>
This season he leads the Warriors in tackles with 47, despite playing behind a 
tough front line that includes all-conference defensive end Jeff Cummins and 
tackles Eric Marrero and Elgin Loften. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an outstanding player," said Golden West Coach Ray Shackleford. "I'm sure 
he's one of their best guys and they have a great team. He's very quick and 
he's always around the football." 
</P>
<P>
In El Camino's 31-24 victory over Fullerton, Sale had 11 tackles although he 
was moved to strong safety because Anthony Anetema, who starts at that 
position, cracked a wrist. 
</P>
<P>
Sale also had an outstanding performance (14 tackles) in the Warriors' 38-14 
win over Golden West and last week, when El Camino whipped Southwestern, he 
returned a punt 47 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Opportunities for big plays aren't always easy to come by considering Sale is 
up against Anetema, a childhood friend, who was an all-conference strong safety 
last season with 96 tackles. Ed Togia (78 tackles last year), an all-conference 
linebacker, also makes his share of tackles before Sale even sees the man. 
</P>
<P>
Warrior co-defensive coordinator Walt Justice calls it El Camino's best defense 
in his six years at the school. It's played a tremendous role in the Warriors' 
success, even though they possess the state's second-best offense. El Camino is 
5-0 (4-0 in conference) and ranked No. 1 in the state by the JC Athletic Bureau 
and No.2 in the nation by USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
"Our other great defense," Justice said, "was in 1987 (when El Camino won the 
national championship). This year we even have more depth in our starters. We 
have seven or eight stars instead of just one or two." 
</P>
<P>
Justice says Sale is the best defensive back he's seen at El Camino. The other 
top back in recent history was all-American Bill Hughley, who went on to Oregon 
State. 
</P>
<P>
"Niu is more disciplined than Bill," Justice said. "He's always in control. He 
has something you just don't teach. He has great instinct for the game and 
great knowledge of it." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's because he's been playing for 10 years, starting with flag football 
at age 9. Sale and his older brother Ken, 21, competed in Carson leagues and 
both played at Bishop Montgomery High. 
</P>
<P>
Ken, a linebacker, played at El Camino in 1986 and 1987 and now leads the 
University of Texas, El Paso (UTEP), in tackles (99 for the season). The 
brothers played together for one season at Bishop Montgomery and both were 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
Sale was an all-around man for the Knights and a three-time all-Angelus League 
selection. He was successful as a defensive back, quarterback, tailback and 
linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
In his first game at quarterback, as a junior, Sale led Bishop Montgomery to a 
27-0 win over Mary Star by rushing for all of the Knights' touchdowns. As a 
senior tailback he gained 240 yards in a game against Servite High. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Szabatura, the coach at Bishop Montgomery when Sale played there, says 
he's never seen a more versatile football player. 
</P>
<P>
"We used him everywhere," said Szabatura who's an offensive coordinator at St. 
John Bosco in Bellflower. "He was one of the best option quarterbacks I've ever 
had. He's the best athlete I've been associated with in my 10-year coaching 
career." 
</P>
<P>
Sale was good enough to play in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. as a 
freshman, but didn't qualify academically. Several schools recruited him as a 
defensive back, including UTEP, Tennessee and the University of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Under Proposition 48 he would have been forced to sit out one season. The NCAA 
rule stipulates that incoming freshmen must score at least 700 on the 
Scholastic Aptitude Test (higher or lower depending on grade-point average) and 
Sale didn't meet that requirement. 
</P>
<P>
"I came here (El Camino)," he said, "because I wanted to stay in shape. I 
didn't want to just sit around for a year. I could never do that." 
</P>
<P>
The colleges that wanted him out of high school still want him. In addition 
Sale has received letters from UC Berkeley, Syracuse, Washington State and 
Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't decided where he'll go, but he wants to leave the state to "see 
what's out there." For now though, he's preoccupied with his performance at El 
Camino. He wants to leave as a two-time all-American. 
</P>
<P>
Szabatura says anyone who knows Sale knows he can do it. His exceptional drive 
and ability make it possible, the coach says. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't a better hitter out there," Szabatura said. "This is the type of 
kid that delivers pops, big pops." 
</P>
<P>
You'd never think that if you saw him out of his pads and helmet, though.

El Camino College begins the toughest phase of its schedule -- Mission 
Conference Northern Division teams -- Saturday at 7 p.m. against visiting 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The top-ranked Warriors (5-0, 4-0) will have their hands full against the 
13th-ranked Lancers, who prefer to control the ball on the ground. Running back 
Wolfe Barber is Pasadena's leading rusher with 617 yards and three touchdowns 
on 90 carries. Pasadena also has Mingo Hooey, who leads the state in 
interceptions (six for 95 yards). 
</P>
<P>
"This has the makings of a very good game," said Coach John Featherstone. "I 
think Pasadena is one of the few teams that matches up with us physically. They 
also have good team speed." 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers (4-1, 3-1) beat Saddleback 24-20 in last week's Mission Conference 
game. Pasadena's other league victories are over Palomar and Grossmont. The 
Lancers' conference loss was to Golden West (19-15), a team El Camino defeated 
38-14 on Oct.7. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors, ranked No. 2 in the nation by USA Today, also have conference 
wins over Fullerton and Orange Coast. Quarterback Frank Dolce is the state's 
fourth-leading passer with 95 of 144 attempts for 1,364 yards and 14 
touchdowns. The sophomore plans to keep alive El Camino's 12-game winning 
streak, the nation's longest. 
</P>
<P>
Ninth-ranked L.A. Southwest (4-0-1, 3-0-1) hosts No.17 Glendale in Saturday's 1 
p.m. Western State Conference game. Last week's contest against L.A. Pierce was 
not much of a test for the Cougars, who walked away with a 28-7 win. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale (3-1-1, 3-0-1) will be much tougher. The Vaqueros beat Santa Monica 
44-41 last week thanks to a productive offense that gained 512 yards. 
Quarterback Ronnie Lopez will keep Southwest's secondary busy. He completed 12 
of 25 passes for 274 yards and two touchdowns last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars, ranked No. 20 in the nation by the JC Grid-Wire, also have 
conference wins over L.A. Valley and West L.A. They tied Bakersfield this 
season and so did Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Unranked Harbor (2-3, 1-3) finally got a conference victory last week against 
winless West L.A., but it's highly unlikely that the Seahawks will repeat the 
feat in Saturday's 1 p.m WSC game at Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
The No.18 Raiders are 3-1 in conference (4-1 overall) after last week's 28-27 
loss to Bakersfield. Quarterback Jayson Merrill completed 19 of 38 passes for 
324 yards and one touchdown. Running back Fred Bradley will also present 
difficulties for Harbor's defense. He's rushed for 523 yards on 86 carries in 
five games. Moorpark's offense averages 435 yards a game.

Bruin Soccer Tourney Will Hold Key to National Title 
</P>
<P>
Anyone looking for an early line on the finals of the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. men's soccer finals should keep an eye on the fifth annual 
UCLA/Met Life Classic that opens tonight at El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
The four-team field features three teams in the Top 20. And three times in the 
tournament's history one has advanced to the NCAA final. Host UCLA in 1985 and 
Duke in 1986 won national titles. And the Met Life tournament has produced a 
Final Four participant each year. Bruin Coach Sigi Schmid is "pleased with the 
field. This is definitely the premier tournament this weekend -- and maybe this 
month -- in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Schmid said the field was attractive enough to move Friday's opening 
doubleheader to the South Bay. Sunday's final will be played at UCLA's North 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
"All four teams will be aiming to improve their playoff chances, so the 
intensity and quality of soccer will be quite high," Schmid said. "We decided 
to have the first round at El Camino College because we feel we can draw a 
better crowd on a Friday night." 
</P>
<P>
The opening matchups pit No. 11 Rutgers (12-1) against 16th-ranked San Diego 
State (10-3-1) at 6 and No. 3 UCLA (12-1-1) against Wisconsin-Green Bay (9-6-1) 
at 8. On Sunday, San Diego and Green Bay will face off at noon and UCLA will 
play Rutgers at 2. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, who have won two of the four Met Life titles and tied for another, 
were ranked No. 1 nationally until last week when they were upset by San Diego 
State, 3-2, in overtime. The three goals were more than UCLA goalkeeper Anton 
Nistl Jr. had allowed all season. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has remained afloat despite the loss for the season of All-American 
forward Billy Thompson, and Schmid said he is pleased to be ranked in the top 
three with a revamped lineup. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins have had luck at El Camino, winning three games in Murdock Stadium 
this fall. In the only Friday night contest, Schmid said, they drew 1,500. For 
several of the Bruins it's something of a homecoming. Schmid, former coach at 
Bishop Montgomery, lives in Torrance and has three Torrance natives playing 
regularly this season -- Chris Roosen, Dana Keir and Ray Fernandez. Fernandez, 
the tournament's MVP in 1986, has three goals this season, all scored at El 
Camino. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a great field for Ray," Schmid said. "He's scored in every game. 
We're hoping to keep that streak alive. And two of those three goals have been 
great goals, extraordinary. Two were left-footed, his off-foot." 
</P>
<P>
Keir, a defender converted to forward due to teammates' injuries, has scored 
more goals this season (four) than in two previous years on defense. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, Schmid said, Keir will return to defense but is expected to 
continue to contribute offensively now that he has the feel. "He was definitely 
a key for us in the early part of the season when we had all those injuries up 
front," Schmid said. 
</P>
<P>
Several players from the other teams have Southland ties. San Diego's top 
scorers, Marcello Balboa and Eric Wynalda, are from Cerritos and Westlake 
Village, respectively. The Aztecs' No. 3 scorer, Jeff Betts, played with some 
of the Bruins on the West team in the Sports Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Another outstanding player is Rutgers forward Leno Dicuollo. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's program will also feature several North Torrance youth soccer teams 
playing before the college games and during intermissions. 
</P>
<P>
In all, it should be a soccer junkie's dream. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Dominguez Hills has applied to be the site for the NCAA Division II 
women's soccer championship. Unfortunately, Toros Coach Marine Cano feels, the 
women didn't apply themselves Tuesday and were whipped by Division I power UC 
Santa Barbara, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Going into Saturday's game against Chapman, the Lady Toros are 14-2 and both 
losses are to Santa Barbara. Cano felt his team had to have a competitive game 
Tuesday to impress the NCAA selection committee. 
</P>
<P>
It's an understatement to say Cano didn't feel his team played well. "We stunk 
-- no, think of a word stronger than stink and that is how we played," the 
agitated coach said. 
</P>
<P>
Cano fears that despite the Lady Toros' 14-0 record against everyone but Santa 
Barbara, the NCAA selection committee might be tempted to pick defending 
national champ Cal State Hayward if it finishes strongly. "This really puts a 
damper on our chances," Cano said. 
</P>
<P>
He figures the way to ensure a playoff bid is to win the last four games 
impressively, starting with Saturday's 11 a.m. home game against Chapman. The 
Lady Toros close out their home schedule Monday against Azusa Pacific, an NAIA 
school, then finish on the road at Cal Poly Pomona and San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
Cano said Chapman "is a big one. We have got to pound some big goals, I mean 
pound some big goals." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara just seems to have Dominguez Hills' number. The Toros have given 
up seven goals to Santa Barbara in the two losses while the other 14 opponents 
have scored only four times. On Tuesday, the Toros held Santa Barbara scoreless 
in the second half but were soundly outplayed, getting outshot, 18-5. In the 
second half, Cano inserted some substitutes for season-long starters. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot lose another game this year," Cano said. "We have some starters who 
think that they are playing well, and they're not." 
</P>
<P>
Ratings Game: So far, Loyola Marymount is picked in every preseason poll but 
one to win the West Coast Conference basketball title. The one exception is 
Dick Vitale's Basketball '89-90 magazine, which selects Pepperdine. However, 
showing the ability to go both ways, Vitale's magazine rates Loyola No. 48 in 
its top 50 and doesn't rank Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
Midnight, it was. Madness, it wasn't. Picking up on an idea used at colleges 
around the country to start basketball practice at the first stroke of Oct. 15 
-- the official start of practice allowed by the NCAA -- Loyola Marymount 
women's basketball Coach Todd Corman held his first practice at midnight 
Saturday. At hoops hotbeds such as Kentucky, it's called Midnight Madness. At 
Loyola, Corman found his team more ready for bed than basketball. "I'll never 
do that again," he said, shaking his head. "By 1 o'clock, (the players) 
couldn't run a break." 
</P>
<P>
College Notes: Dominguez Hills soccer forward Kaveh Razaghi continues to lead 
the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. in scoring with 19 points . . . Loyola 
catcher Miah Bradbury and first baseman/outfielder Joe Ciccarella are on a U.S. 
Federation baseball team playing in the Presidential Cup in Taiwan on Oct. 31 
to Nov. 12. Also on the 20-man squad is Pepperdine outfielder Jalal Leach. The 
international tourney, also including teams from Canada, the Netherlands, 
Japan, Korea, the Philippines and Spain, is a prelude to next summer's Goodwill 
Games . . . The seventh annual Tom Higgins Golf Classic will be played Nov. 6 
to benefit the Loyola Marymount golf team. Golfing begins at 11 a.m. at 
Hacienda Golf Club in La Habra. Entry fee is $250. For information, call the 
Rev. Tom Higgins at 642-1801.

PARK PERFORMERS INVITED TO 'DONATE TIME' AT ARTS FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an about-face, the coordinator of Super Powers Sunday said Thursday that 
Balboa Park street performers will be allowed to take part in Sunday's 
festivities in the park, which kick off the 3 1/2-week Soviet arts festival. 
</P>
<P>
But, she noted, performers won't be allowed to ask for tips, and any mime, 
juggler, clown or harpist wishing to "donate their time" won't be allowed to 
"do their thing" just any place. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll put them where we want them to be," said Peg Nugent, the coordinator for 
Super Powers Sunday, which starts at 11 a.m. in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Officials for the San Diego Police Department estimate that as many as 50,000 
people may visit the park Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Penny Scott, district manager for Balboa Park, said street 
performers would not be granted permits to perform in the park either Saturday 
or Sunday. They were also prohibited from performing in the park last weekend 
during a children's arts fair. 
</P>
<P>
She described Super Powers Sunday and the Kidz Artz Fair as "private parties." 
She said sponsors of neither event wanted the street performers, who 
customarily show up in the park on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Nugent said Thursday that, despite the park's permit policy, it was never her 
intention -- nor that of Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who conceived the festival -- 
to ban anyone from performing in the park. She reiterated, however, that in 
letting street performers know they're welcome, they would have to "conform to 
the rules" of Super Powers Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I have now asked these people to donate their talents to the people of San 
Diego," Nugent said. "We may have 3,000 performers in the park on Sunday. It 
would be pretty startling, don't you think, if they suddenly started asking for 
tips. So, they can't ask for tips. But I'm inviting the street performers to 
come to the park and be a part of our big celebration. The truth is, I can use 
'em, so bring 'em on." 
</P>
<P>
"I got a call from Peg Nugent this morning, and she sounded like a different 
person," said Cynthia Douglass, a harpist from Del Mar, who said Balboa Park 
officials told her earlier in the week that she would not be welcome or 
permitted on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Nugent said, 'We're so sorry for the miscommunication,' " Douglass said. 
"Miscommunication was the word she used, but my very definite impression, from 
everyone I talked to, was that we were being banned. We even got a memo to that 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
"Nugent gave me a phone number to call and asked me to contact other street 
performers," Douglass said. "So, I will. . . . If she's serious -- and I assume 
she is, I'm taking her at her word -- I will perform, as will most of my 
friends, even it means working without tips." 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Barton, who as a clown goes by the name Silly Star, said she planned to 
perform in the park Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I have some questions about anyone saying we can't make a profit," Barton 
said. "I'm a single mother going to school full time. My child and I are living 
on welfare. Dressing up like a clown and entertaining for pocket change helps a 
lot. Without it, we wouldn't have gas or electricity or a phone. I couldn't 
manage my household if I didn't work as a clown. 
</P>
<P>
"The people running this festival can make all the demands they want, but the 
truth is my survival depends on tips. What are the hot dog vendors going to do 
on Sunday? Give their money to the poor? I doubt it. Every performer is willing 
to do this, but we all feel we're entitled to tips." 
</P>
<P>
Barton said she had been told by Balboa Park officials that performers from Sea 
World and Seaport Village were being paid to work as street performers for 
Super Powers Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Nugent said Sea World and Seaport Village are providing a delegation of 
performers for Super Powers Sunday, but no one connected with the event is 
paying them. 
</P>
<P>
"Seaport Village and Sea World may very well be paying them," she said, 
"because the people they're sending are on the payroll of Seaport Village and 
Sea World. But I can't stress strongly enough that this is a volunteer event, 
for which no one is being paid by the organizers. That's why we don't want 
people asking for tips. That would take away from the spirit of the festival." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Jacobs, a spokesman for Sea World, said any performer on the Sea World 
payroll would be paid -- by Sea World -- for performing during Super Powers 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Lowell Taylor, a spokeswoman for Seaport Village, said the same holds true for 
her park. Taylor said that Seaport Village is sending two mimes, a juggler and 
a magician to Super Powers Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"These are people who would normally be performing at Seaport Village on 
Sunday," Taylor said, "but instead, we're sending them to Super Powers Sunday 
for a couple of hours, at our expense. These are some of the best street 
performers in town; they've been here quite a few years." 
</P>
<P>
Barton said street performers who show up on weekends in Balboa Park are a 
loose-knit coalition of friends who perform only for tips. She said they 
include mimes, jugglers, a magician, clowns, a harpist and Indian dancers. 
</P>
<P>
She said the feeling they shared at first was that the city wanted 
"higher-quality" street performers, that the city was embarrassed by them and 
did not want them seen by visitors from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"The city never would have asked these people to give up their livelihood," 
Nugent said. "For the city to take the heat for this, when we were doing 
everything in our power to bring in as many as possible, just wasn't fair. 
We're grateful for the generosity of all local talents featured, including 
those who use the park on a regular basis."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: 'MAY MORE CHICKENS COME FROM THESE EGGS' 
</P>

Maureen and Mikhail and Malcolm were there. 
</P>
<P>
So were about 500 other prosperous folk who attended the preview reception and 
dinner Thursday night for the Faberge egg exhibit at the Museum of Art, the 
artistic centerpiece of the Soviet arts festival. 
</P>
<P>
Two days hence Balboa Park will be given over to Super Powers Sunday, the 
official start of the festival, with folk dancers, circus clowns, chefs, 
jugglers, musicians and about everything else, Soviet and American, that the 
park will hold. All free and informal and open to all. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd at the preview reception was different. It was black-tie, 
invitation-only. 
</P>
<P>
These are people with CEO and S&amp;L after their names; people whose names 
appear in the Blue Book but not the phone book. People who own newspapers and a 
few who work at them. 
</P>
<P>
Security was tight. Discreet, but tight. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of 27 priceless works of art, including 8 from the Kremlin and 9 
from the Forbes collection, tends to make you cautious. I'm sure I spotted a 
guy with a heater hidden in his tux. 
</P>
<P>
"Every screw is tightened, every case is unturnable, every pane is 
bulletproof," assured Joseph W. Hibben, president of the museum's board of 
trustees. 
</P>
<P>
A toast was offered by Mikhail Gribanov, the Soviet minister of culture, a 
solid, stolid soul with a high forehead and thick eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
"May more chickens come from these eggs," he said. Translation: If the festival 
goes well, it's just the beginning, glasnost willing. 
</P>
<P>
Four kinds of caviar and five kinds of vodka (the pepper vodka packed a 
particular wallop) kept the mood festive. 
</P>
<P>
If there was a star of the evening it was the irrepressible Malcolm Forbes. 
"I'm just glad a capitalist tool like me could play a part in this," grinned 
the magazine magnate. 
</P>
<P>
You have to love a man who parks his own hot-air ballon outside the party: 
decorated like a Faberge egg. 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake, this is a man who has mastered the twin arts of making money 
and living well and doesn't give a damn who knows it. 
</P>
<P>
When his private jet arrived Thursday morning at Lindbergh Field, reporters 
beseeched: Where's Liz? Malcolm and Ms. Taylor are quite good friends. 
</P>
<P>
Turns out she caught the vapors early in the week and opted to stay home in 
Beverly Hills. "She even had to break a date Monday night with Mick Jagger," 
explained Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes said the Faberge show would never have occurred without the rapport that 
developed between Mayor Maureen O'Connor and Irina Rodimtseva, director of the 
state museums at the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
"When those two ladies got together and hit it off," Forbes said, "who the hell 
could have stopped it?" 
</P>
<P>
Who indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Ready to Tell All 
</P>
<P>
Here's what I hear. 
</P>
<P>
* Dorena Bertusi, one of two women staffers that the House ethics committee 
says were sexually harassed by Rep. Jim Bates, has already accepted an 
invitation to tell everything to Geraldo Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
She may also file a civil suit. And Bates-baiters are already planning buttons: 
Dump "Backseat" Bates. 
</P>
<P>
* An old political saw says the smart candidate "knows who his voters are." 
</P>
<P>
If so, council-hopeful Bob Trettin may have an interesting constituency. His 
signs line the streets leading to the Del Mar Race Track. 
</P>
<P>
* Sheriff John Duffy obtained a court order striking the address of his new 
5,200-square-foot home at Scripps Ranch from voter registration records. 
</P>
<P>
Too many threats and process servers arriving at all hours, says a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy invoked a new state law that entitles cops, prosecutors and judges to 
seek confidentiality in voter registration. So far, he's the only San Diego 
County official to do so. 
</P>
<P>
* It didn't take long for panhandlers in downtown San Diego to develop an 
earthquake pitch. 
</P>
<P>
One fellow at 5th and Broadway is bumming spare change by saying his Social 
Security check is delayed because the Oakland office is shut by the shake.

4 WELFARE RECIPIENTS SUE COUNTY OVER PUNISHMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Four welfare recipients who broke San Diego County's rules for receiving basic 
aid sued the county Thursday, claiming the punishment was too harsh for their 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, which was filed in San Diego Superior Court and seeks to add as 
plaintiffs all indigent people who receive the county aid, claims the county 
violates the federal and state constitutions when it bars the poor for as many 
as six months for flouting the regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs are seeking back benefits and a change in county regulations. 
</P>
<P>
No other state counties with large cities impose such lengthy penalties, said 
Rosemary Bishop, an attorney for the Legal Aid Society of San Diego, which 
filed the suit. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the length of the sanctions is pretty shocking, and we think the 
court will be shocked, too," Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
The suit will test the due process clause of the federal and state 
constitutions, an area of law often cited in suits but, in a way, rarely seen 
in modern cases, Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit centers on the county's general relief program, which the suit 
describes as the "program of 'last resort' for people who have no other means 
of support." Under the program, required by state law, county residents who 
cannot qualify for any other form of aid can get $291 a month plus food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
In March, the last month for which figures were available, 4,739 people 
received those benefits, according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Those who are not disabled are required to work 72 hours a month at $3.35 an 
hour on county projects to help repay their relief grant, the suit says. During 
off hours, recipients must search for and accept any other job that pays 
minimum wage, it says. 
</P>
<P>
Violations of the work rules result in fixed periods of ineligibility for the 
aid, from 60 days to six months, the suit says. Making up missed work or 
otherwise trying to comply with the rules does not change the sanction, it 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the four people who filed the suit added sworn statements saying they 
were penalized for three months. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of the three was Barbara Mascorro, 25, who said she lost her 
eligibility because she failed to provide an adequate medical excuse for 
missing work. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth plaintiff, Veronica McNeil, 30, said she was ineligible for benefits 
for 60 days because she had been fired in the private sector.

SOUTHLAND QUAKE INSURERS FEEL NO JOLT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the devastation and destruction left by the Bay Area earthquake, 
homeowners in Southern California are not rushing out to buy earthquake 
insurance, industry officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Theresa Bedoy, Allstate underwriting manager for Southern California, said her 
company's local agents are only getting about "one or two" inquiries a day 
about earthquake insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"We got more calls after the (1987) Whittier quake, but that was because of the 
earthquake's proximity," said Bedoy, who works out of Orange County. "We have 
surveyed several of our 550 agents in Southern California. They're getting 
about one or two calls a day. People don't usually call and ask for earthquake 
insurance, but it's happening now." 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Knierim, part-owner of the Hartley, Scott &amp; Knierim Insurance Agency 
in San Diego, agreed that local homeowners have not shown a sudden interest in 
earthquake coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been no big rush to buy earthquake insurance in San Diego. At least, 
not with our company. Most people know that earthquake coverage is available to 
them. The law in California says that, if you write a homeowner's policy, you 
have to give the buyer the option of buying earthquake coverage, too," Knierim 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although earthquakes are a common, and, some would say, routine, phenomenon in 
California, earthquake insurance is not a popular item. One reason for that is 
its high cost. In San Diego County, premiums cost $1.80 to $4 per $1,000 of 
coverage, depending on the company. Earthquake premiums in San Diego County are 
cheaper than in Los Angeles County, industry officials said, because the 
chances of a severe temblor are greater there. 
</P>
<P>
In fault-riddled Imperial County, premiums cost up to $12 per $1,000 of 
coverage, Bedoy said. That is the highest rate in California, she added. 
Deductibles on earthquake policies are usually 10%, whereas deductibles for a 
regular homeowner's policy usually run from $200 to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, about 1 out of every 5 homeowners have earthquake insurance, said 
Debbie Rosenzweig, spokeswoman for the Western Insurance Information Service 
office in Orange County. In the Bay Area, the rate is a little higher, with 1 
out of every 4 homeowners having earthquake coverage. Figures for San Diego 
County were not available. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners often assume incorrectly that they are not covered for damages 
incurred during an earthquake, Bedoy said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some situations where a homeowner can be compensated even if he 
doesn't have earthquake insurance. If your house burns down because of fires 
started by a quake, you can be covered. If it's damaged by burst water pipes, 
you can be covered," Bedoy said. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenzweig said wood frame houses are cheaper to insure against earthquakes, 
while brick homes are more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the day after the quake, most insurance companies imposed a 
30-day moratorium in the Bay Area on the sale of earthquake policies. Jeff 
Beyer, a spokesman for the Farmers Insurance home office in Los Angeles, said 
his company's moratorium covers 20 counties around the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
Allstate lifted its moratorium in 17 Bay Area counties Thursday morning, Bedoy 
said. The company authorized its agents to begin writing new policies, but only 
after physically inspecting the home or vehicle to make sure there is no 
existing damage, she said.

RESIDENTS LOBBY FOR CORNER TO EXPAND STUDIO CITY LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Studio City residents lobbied the Los Angeles Board of Library Commissioners on 
Thursday to buy a vacant corner for future expansion of the community's branch 
library and its parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The Studio City Library, 4400 Babcock Ave., is crowded by at least 58,000 books 
-- more than twice its intended capacity -- and its 19-space parking lot is 
usually full, said Gerald A. Kurland of the Studio City Residents Assn. 
</P>
<P>
When a gasoline station next door was torn down earlier this year, Kurland said 
library patrons began wondering if the land could be purchased to ease the 
crowding. 
</P>
<P>
Conversations with the property owner were encouraging, he told the library 
board Thursday. "But any day he could change his mind. We need to act swiftly." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners offered the residents little encouragement. They asked the 
board's staff to review the proposal, but said long-term plans adopted last 
year call for moving the branch to a commercial location. 
</P>
<P>
In general, library board members believe that small branch libraries fare 
better in commercial centers, where there is better security and more parking, 
said board Vice President Sanford P. Paris. 
</P>
<P>
"We find that we get more use out of libraries in a commercial facility, where 
parents can come, drop off the kids . . . and do other things with one parking 
stop," Paris said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, money for land purchases and library expansion is short because older 
libraries that need earthquake strengthening have funding priority, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Far from being discouraged, Kurland said after the meeting that the residents 
-- who have letters of support from Councilmen Michael Woo and Joel Wachs, who 
represent the area -- plan to take the issue to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
They already have 1,150 signatures on a petition endorsing the idea. Kurland 
and Fred Gaines, representing Friends of the Studio City Library, said they 
would continue distributing the petition and contacting community 
organizations, including the Parent-Teacher-Student associations at local 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to get the kids involved," Kurland said. "They really feel the impact 
probably most of all."

WAS DUTIFUL, OBEDIENT, HUNTER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nancy Hoover Hunter, testifying for a second day Thursday at her fraud and 
tax-evasion trial, portrayed herself as a dutiful worker who obediently 
followed the directions of J. David (Jerry) Dominelli because she trusted and 
believed him. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter said she "wanted to do everything" to help Dominelli during the first 
few years of business at his La Jolla investment firm, J. David &amp; Co., 
because at the time, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, she thought he was a 
genius. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter is being tried on 197 charges in U.S. District Court related to her 
alleged participation in the investment company's giant Ponzi scheme, which 
collapsed in February, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that Hunter played an active role in the fraud, which cost 
about 1,200 investers $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys claim that Hunter was blinded by her love for Dominelli and 
was unaware of his illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
In line with that theme, Hunter said Thursday that among her jobs during the 
early years at J. David was helping Dominelli assemble track records of his 
trading profits -- but only, she said, at his direction and with records and 
documents he supplied. 
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, Judge Earl B. Gilliam ruled Thursday that a diary Hunter 
kept in 1979 and love letters Dominelli sent her in 1980 could not be admitted 
as evidence in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's attorney, Richard Marmaro of Los Angeles, had argued that Hunter's 
love for Dominelli led to her "good faith belief" in him, and that faith, in 
turn, could lead the jury to find her innocent of the charges against her. But 
Gilliam said Hunter's love was not in dispute, so the material was not 
relevant. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter returns to the witness stand today. Her testimony is expected to last at 
least through next Tuesday.

POLICE SHOTS HALT STOLEN CAR IN S.D. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego police shot the tires of a stolen car Thursday when they feared the 
fleeing vehicle was heading toward a school zone where it would endanger 
children. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said officers spotted the car downtown at about 8 a.m. and 
chased it to Hillcrest, where it drove into a cul-de-sac south of Pennsylvania 
and 7th avenues. 
</P>
<P>
When officers approached, the driver turned the car around and smashed into a 
patrol car as it fled. 
</P>
<P>
The officers, fearing for the safety of children, shot the tires, Lt. Larry 
Kenny said. Police arrested the driver and a passenger at 7th and University 
avenues, Kenney said. A second passenger ran away. 
</P>
<P>
The two men who were arrested were identified only as Mexican citizens who may 
be part of an auto-theft ring.

UCSD ENGINEER BLAMES CRACKED JOINTS FOR NIMITZ FREEWAY COLLAPSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A UC San Diego structural engineer on Thursday blamed the Nimitz Freeway 
collapse on cracks in the ill-designed joints that connected the double-decked 
roadway to its massive, reinforced support columns. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation on what caused the bridge in Oakland to collapse in Tuesday's Bay 
Area earthquake has focused largely on the bridge's support columns. But Nigel 
Priestley, a UCSD structural engineering professor who studies how earthquakes 
affect bridges, said the temblor generated intense pressures that cracked the 
under-reinforced joints, allowing the upper deck to collapse on motorists 
traveling along the lower deck. 
</P>
<P>
The joints provided a "natural place for weakness, and there was virtually no 
reinforcement" evident in the failed bridge or in original engineering designs, 
Priestley said. 
</P>
<P>
Although substandard by today's guidelines, the Nimitz Freeway's relatively 
unique design was "state of the art" in the 1950s, said Priestley, who is 
helping the state Department of Transportation find ways to reinforce bridge 
columns that are susceptible to earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Bridges Share Problem 
</P>
<P>
Priestley said other double-deck bridges should not be shut down because few 
bridges share the same fatal design problems. 
</P>
<P>
Priestley, who traveled to Oakland on Wednesday to inspect the failed bridge 
and original engineering designs, described the columns as "under-designed by 
today's standards." But he maintained that the joints were "the real weak 
link." 
</P>
<P>
The Nimitz Freeway's chances of surviving Tuesday's earthquake would not have 
improved had its huge support columns been retrofitted during Caltrans' 
continuing retrofitting program, Priestley said. The accident "could have 
happened anyway," Priestley said. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1970s, Caltrans installed improved expansion joints on the bridge's 
roadway. But those improvements were not designed to lessen the strains that 
produced cracks in the joints between the roadways and the support columns. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a complex and unusual bridge," said Priestley, who studies bridges and 
other structures in UCSD's unique earthquake engineering laboratory. "It's not 
a standard . . . and there are some unusual aspects to it that make it prone to 
damage." 
</P>
<P>
Priestley said the steel bars that should have reinforced brittle concrete at 
the joints evidently proved unable to handle stresses generated when the 
roadways and columns lurched back and forth during Tuesday's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Although newer bridge designs take those stresses into account, engineers 
during the 1950s had a "very primitive" understanding of how bridges would 
transfer stress from one section to another. The joints, while up to standard 
in the 1950s, left the "potential for a very major crack to develop." 
</P>
<P>
That potential existed because reinforcing bars at the joints were 
"inadequately anchored" in the massive support columns, Priestley said. 
</P>
<P>
Priestley and two other scientists at UCSD use a unique $2-million earthquake 
testing center to construct full-scale models of structures that are 
subsequently destroyed by earthquake-like forces. Those studies will be used to 
improve design and construction methods in the United States, reducing 
casualties and property damage after earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans has awarded UCSD's earthquake researchers a $717,000 contract to 
physically test a "steel blanket" that would be wrapped around suspect bridge 
columns across the state to improve their resistance to earthquake damage. 
Caltrans also has awarded the laboratory a $135,000 contract to assess damage 
caused to the I-5/I-605 interchange during the 1987 earthquake in Whittier.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: UNRULY MAN DIES AFTER BREAKING INTO HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An apparently deranged intruder broke into a Pacoima house Thursday and was 
restrained by residents, then died en route to a hospital, apparently of a drug 
overdose, Los Angeles police reported. 
</P>
<P>
William Robert Fields, 24, of Apple Valley died in an ambulance on the way to 
Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills after police arrested him outside 
the house in the 13400 block of Desmond Street, Detective Al Ferrand said. 
</P>
<P>
Results of an autopsy will not be available for several weeks, Ferrand said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither officers nor the residents injured the man, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fields kicked in the front door of the house about 1:30 a.m. and, once inside, 
began stacking furniture against the door, apparently to keep out an imaginary 
assailant, Ferrand said. He then ran through the house, screaming incoherently, 
and knocked out windows, apparently to get outside, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A 16-year-old girl who was awakened by the commotion called police while five 
other family members threw the man to the living room floor and held him there 
until officers arrived, police said. The house is occupied by a family of seven 
or eight, Ferrand said. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrand said Fields fits the description of a man who witnesses said was 
chasing and assaulting people near the house about 10:30 p.m. Wednesday.

FAME COMING AT ISMAIL FASTER THAN A ROCKET

SOUTH BEND, Ind. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Outside the window was a Christmas card come to life. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana was getting a winter preview from a storm that was expected to drop up 
to six inches of snow by Thursday night. The Notre Dame campus was blanketed 
with the flakes, leaving a scene of peace and serenity. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, the young man stared at it almost wistfully as he spoke, seeming to 
search for some calm in the storm. Peace and serenity are the last things he 
has in his life right now. 
</P>
<P>
No, this is not another story about a kid going down the road of drugs or gang 
warfare to ruin. This is a story about a kid who has taken the high road to 
fame and glory. 
</P>
<P>
But sometimes, that journey can be almost as harrowing. 
</P>
<P>
As in this case. 
</P>
<P>
Meet Raghib Ismail. Age: 19. Background: deeply religious. Nature: modest, 
soft-spoken. 
</P>
<P>
Now meet Rocket, brightest new star to streak across the media sky, with his 
faithful companions, Missile and Bomb, and his mom, the Launching Pad. 
</P>
<P>
Sound like a Saturday morning cartoon crew? 
</P>
<P>
That's what life sometimes seems like for Ismail, alias the Rocket, American 
sports' new super hero. 
</P>
<P>
No secret identity for this guy. No Clark Kent alter ego. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody knows who the Rocket is. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody. 
</P>
<P>
In the last month, he has been mentioned in a speech by President Bush, 
featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated, profiled by major media outlets 
across the country and linked by name and deed to a select few, such as Magic 
and Bo, who can be instantly identified with a single word. 
</P>
<P>
Ismail is trying to keep it all in perspective. As the nation's premier kickoff 
returner, he may have no trouble keeping his balance, but standing on a 
pedestal can be a little trickier. 
</P>
<P>
He tells people that, at Notre Dame, he is just one weapon of the defending 
national champions, that Saturday's showdown here against USC is just another 
big game in a season full of big games and that he is just another student who 
needs his education because he might not it as a pro. "Many people have done 
some pretty good things in college," Ismail said, "and they have not even 
played in the pros, even if they were drafted. So I'm not thinking about it." 
</P>
<P>
But he can't avoid thinking about his newly acquired fame when it stares at him 
from the cover of a national magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I was shocked when I saw my picture on the cover," Ismail said. "But 
then, I started thinking, 'I hope it doesn't bring on more than I want. Now, 
everybody knows your business. Everybody wants to be your friend.' " 
</P>
<P>
Even those he considers friends don't always understand his new life. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of weeks ago, I was sick," he explained, "and I had to study for 
midterms. So, I didn't eat lunch with the people I usually do. But not knowing 
what was going on, they started saying, 'Now that he's been on the cover of 
that magazine, he can't eat with us. He's too good for us.' " 
</P>
<P>
The nation discovered just how good Ismail is in Notre Dame's second game this 
season, a nationally televised contest against Michigan. Ismail returned two 
kickoffs for touchdowns, one for 89 yards, the other for 92. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler said Ismail was "faster than the speed of 
sound." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, in a speech on the obligation to use one's talent, picked Ismail as an 
example. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps some of you saw," the President said, "this amazing Notre Dame 
sophomore. . . . not once, but twice returning kickoffs for record-breaking 
touchdowns -- the best use of speed since Chuck Yeager broke the sound 
barrier." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame fans discovered Ismail a year earlier when he first pulled off this 
double-barreled feat against Rice, returning kickoffs for touchdowns of 87 and 
83 yards. 
</P>
<P>
But they've known about the Rocket in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., for several years. 
</P>
<P>
It was there that he and his brothers, Qadry and Sulaiman, moved after the 
death of their father, Ibrahim, from kidney problems. 
</P>
<P>
Their mother, Fatma, working two jobs just to survive, worried about the bad 
environment in the schools of Newark, N.J., where they lived. So she sent her 
kids to live with her mother-in-law, Laura Bauknight, in Wilkes-Barre. 
</P>
<P>
It was there that the Ismail kids expanded their religious horizons. Bauknight, 
a devout Christian, introduced the boys to her beliefs with a simple rule -- no 
church, no food. 
</P>
<P>
It was there the legend was born. 
</P>
<P>
A track coach, Jim Cross, watching eighth-grader Ismail race out of the 
starting blocks, said, "He has the thrust of a rocket." 
</P>
<P>
And who at Meyers High School could disagree? 
</P>
<P>
Before he left, Ismail rushed for 4,494 yards and 62 touchdowns, caught 57 
passes for 858 yards and five more touchdowns and gained 2,024 additional yards 
and scored seven more touchdowns on kickoff and punt returns. Grand total: 
7,376 all-purpose yards and 74 touchdowns in 26 games. 
</P>
<P>
Ismail gained 313 yards rushing in one game, scored six touchdowns in another. 
And he still found enough energy to be a star on the track squad as a 
sprinter/triple jumper/long jumper, and play guard on the basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Rewriting the Meyers record book is one thing. Doing the same at Notre Dame is 
quite another. 
</P>
<P>
But Ismail is working on it. 
</P>
<P>
His four kickoff returns for touchdowns are already enough to break the school 
record of three, set by a pretty good player by the name of Tim Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Ismail is only two behind the NCAA career mark, set by USC's Anthony Davis. Two 
of Davis' were against Notre Dame in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Ismail was so impressive last year that the NCAA made a rare statistical 
decision, awarding him the kickoff return title even though he didn't qualify. 
</P>
<P>
Ismail averaged 36.1 yards on a dozen kickoffs. The NCAA required minimum is 
14. But he was ruled the winner anyway when it was determined that he would 
have finished ahead of the runner-up, Chris Oldham of Oregon, even if he hadn't 
gained a single yard on his next two returns. 
</P>
<P>
His average this year is even higher at 39.9 yards a runback. 
</P>
<P>
You can always kick away from him, as teams are doing. But Notre Dame Coach Lou 
Holtz is countering by using Ismail and his 4.28-second, 40-yard dash speed 
more and more in his game plan: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ismail has been used as a split end, and he leads the Irish in receiving 
with 17 catches for 333 yards, a 19.6-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He has been used as a ballcarrier out of a full-house backfield. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He has been used as a punt returner. In only his second punt return of the 
season last week against Air Force, Ismail went all the way on a 56-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And, the ultimate horror for opposing coaches, Ismail is now running at 
tailback. 
</P>
<P>
Against Air Force, Ismail rushed for 92 yards in 10 carries, including a 
24-yard touchdown on a reverse. 
</P>
<P>
"I just felt we had to do something to be more productive," Holtz said. "He 
didn't know the blocking schemes that well, but when he saw a hole, he just 
accelerated. I don't think you're going to see him eight, nine, 10 times at 
tailback. I don't think we can afford to do that. But he is stronger for his 
size than we were led to believe." 
</P>
<P>
At 5-10 and 175 pounds, Ismail may not look imposing. But after the Rocket 
receives his payload and takes off, afterburners roaring, there are no more 
doubters. 
</P>
<P>
Behind him, fueled and ready, are Qadry (nicknamed Missile), a Syracuse 
freshman who has already returned a kick 56 yards this season to set up a 
touchdown, and Sulaiman (Bomb), still at Meyers. 
</P>
<P>
Fatma placed the nickname, Launching Pad, on her own head. 
</P>
<P>
All this stuff only serves to make the spotlight on Ismail even brighter, but 
he's still managing to have fun in the pressure cooker. 
</P>
<P>
When he scored his first touchdown as a collegian against Purdue last season on 
a 54-yard pass from Tony Rice, Ismail kept going, right into the stands to a 
hug a few folks. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, son," Holtz later told him, "if you want to go up in the stands, I'll get 
you a ticket." 
</P>
<P>
The Rocket roared, with laughter. 
</P>
<P>
And, why not? 
</P>
<P>
It looks as if he's got a ticket that will take him a long way. 
</P>
<P>
Peace and serenity will have to wait.

KCBS BUYS REMAINING TICKETS, PUTTING RAM GAME ON TV SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Los Angeles will get a Ram-Raider doubleheader on television Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams announced Thursday that their game against the New Orleans Saints on 
Sunday at Anaheim Stadium was a sellout before the 1 p.m. deadline for lifting 
the television blackout. 
</P>
<P>
A Ram spokesman said KCBS, which will televise the game here, bought the 
remaining tickets. The spokesman did not say how many tickets remained, nor did 
a spokeswoman for KCBS. 
</P>
<P>
Reportedly, about 5,000 tickets were still unsold Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The game announcers for the 1 p.m. telecast on Channel 2 will be Steve 
Zabriskie and Hank Stram. 
</P>
<P>
KCBS was originally scheduled to show the New York Giant-San Diego Charger game 
from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The Ram-Saint telecast will follow the Raiders' game against the Eagles at 
Philadelphia, which will be on Channel 4 at 10 a.m. Joel Meyers and Paul 
Maguire will report. 
</P>
<P>
This is first local telecast of a Ram home game this season. Even Eric 
Dickerson's return with the Indianapolis Colts on Sept. 17 wasn't televised 
locally. The game didn't sell out, but even if it had, it couldn't have been 
televised because of a scheduling snafu. LARRY STEWART

<P>
When Chris Zorich, Notre Dame's All-American junior nose tackle, goes home to 
Chicago's South Side, he is quickly reminded of his troubled childhood in the 
ghetto. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny how things worked out," Zorich said. "The same guys who used to 
beat me up and extort money, at least the ones who are still around, are still 
standing on the same corner all drugged up and still asking me if I've got a 
buck. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll say things like, 'Chris, you doing great, man, you an athlete now -- 
big-time. We're following you on television, man, all the time. You ain't 
forgetting us or anything, are you, man?' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't answer most of the time because there isn't much to say. The only 
thing they know is the four blocks around them, and I've learned there are 
other things in this world." 
</P>
<P>
Zorich's world includes the lakes and woods of the Notre Dame campus, but the 
memories of his younger days, still painful, are with him even when he plays. 
</P>
<P>
"There's almost always a double team against me," Zorich said, "so I can't 
afford to focus on anything but the center and the snap of the ball because 
that's my only chance to get the upper hand . . . to tear into the center 
before he's ready to handle me. 
</P>
<P>
"But somewhere in the back of my mind, I remember all the things I've been 
through, that my mom went through. That, more than just about anything else, 
makes me play the way I do." 
</P>
<P>
Zorich has never met his father, who is black, and the task of rearing him in a 
predominately black ghetto went to his mother, Zora Zorich, who is white and of 
Yugoslav descent. 
</P>
<P>
There were muggings, and Zorich recalls times when he and his mother worried 
whether they would have enough to eat. 
</P>
<P>
But he survived and earned a scholarship to Notre Dame. He's from Chicago 
Vocational High School, where Dick Butkus, the former Chicago Bear All-Pro 
linebacker, once played. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Lou Holtz switched the 6-foot-1, 268-pound Zorich from linebacker to 
defensive lineman, then worked on calming him down. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a scrimmage last year, and I remember after every play he was looking 
for somebody to fight," Holtz said. "Well, finally, he found the one guy who 
would fight him, and that was me. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so upset that I grabbed him by the facemask, and we had quite a few 
words -- all one-sided, of course. I told him I didn't want him getting thrown 
out of games, that he was going to be a great player for four years. 
</P>
<P>
"What he didn't understand at the time is that his performance would speak for 
itself. He's never been in trouble since." 
</P>
<P>
Zorich was frustrated last Saturday night when Air Force guard Steve Wilson 
scored a late touchdown on a "fumblerooskie" play, a version of the old 
hidden-ball trick. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked at the quarterback and said, 'Where's the ball?' " Zorich said. 
"Then, all of a sudden I see this big fat guard going in for a score." 
</P>
<P>
Holtz said the touchdown shouldn't have been allowed, but the Irish, who won 
41-27, had a 41-14 lead at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"Both of his knees were down when he picked the ball up," Holtz said. "I told 
an official that it was a downed play because his knees were on the ground. The 
official said, 'I didn't see it.' I said, 'Fair enough. Neither did any of our 
players.' " 
</P>
<P>
It's doubtful that USC will try to fool the Irish with such a gimmick in 
Saturday's game at South Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Football players endure aches and pains, but Tulane quarterback Deron Smith 
lives with the constant fear of recurring, blinding headaches that last as long 
as three days. 
</P>
<P>
"He has what are called 'cluster' headaches, similar to migraine headaches, 
but, as the name says, they come in clusters," Tulane trainer Scott Anderson 
said. "It's caused by a combination of things. They're stress-related, or seem 
to be, but it also has to do with the balance of chemicals in the brain, and 
there's some evidence they're hereditary." 
</P>
<P>
Said Smith: "I take medicine every day for it, but the only thing that seems to 
help is breathing pure oxygen. It cuts the length of the headache down some. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a throbbing pain. It's something you don't like to talk about. It just 
stays there. Nothing cures it at the time. It's like someone pounding on your 
head with a hammer. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it's twice a day. Sometimes they don't come for two or three weeks, 
then they come every day. Sometimes it's three times a day." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who has been suffering the headaches since the seventh grade, says his 
mother once suffered from the same type of headache and that his sister still 
does. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was to catch one during a game, I'd have to come out. There's no way I 
could play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tulane Coach Greg Davis said the headaches are incapacitating. 
</P>
<P>
"All you have to do is look at him, and you know he's in extreme pain," he 
said. "His eyes show it." 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, USC's players complained about the Omniturf at Oregon's Autzen 
Stadium in Eugene, saying that they slipped repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
Now Nebraska is making a similar complaint about the same artificial surface at 
Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably had 10 to 12 crucial slips in the game," Nebraska Coach Tom 
Osborne said. "Missouri probably had three or four because they know a little 
more about how to play on it. Their coaches admit it's kind of hazardous to 
play on. We're glad we don't have to go back to Missouri for two more years." 
</P>
<P>
Although he wasn't recruited by any major schools, Kirk Baumgartner is 
attracting the attention of NFL scouts. Baumgartner plays for Wisconsin Stevens 
Point and last week he became the NAIA's career total offense leader with 
10,965 yards. He has also thrown 139 consecutive passes without an 
interception, an NCAA Division III record. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not a sleeper anymore," said Tom Braatz, the Green Bay Packer vice 
president for football operations. "He's got too many yards and and he can 
throw the ball too well. He has a big league arm."

Cook County Sheriff's deputies in Chicago served Raider receiver Willie Gault 
with an eviction notice, passed by the owners of a building because Gault owes 
$32,533.33 in rent on a clothing store. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart Dubin, an attorney for the landlord, said the store opened in January, 
but Gault had paid only $14,000 of a rental bill that totaled more than $50,000

SAUGUS AWARDED VICTORY IN GAME SUSPENDED WHEN OFFICIAL ATTACKED

Golden League administrators Thursday awarded Saugus High a 2-0 forfeit victory 
in its football game last Friday night that was suspended after a Palmdale 
player attacked an official. 
</P>
<P>
Principals and athletic directors met for six hours Thursday at Quartz Hill 
High before reaching a decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We were looking for a fair and equitable decision," Saugus principal Mike von 
Buelow said. "We didn't come across any real precedent that was close to this. 
It was just a matter of what would be the best thing to make sure this would 
never happen again." 
</P>
<P>
Von Buelow said the league will release a statement today listing sanctions 
against individuals involved. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale Principal Linda Janzen could not be reached for comment. Von Buelow, 
however, said that Palmdale officials were "extremely cooperative and helpful 
in making the decision." 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale Coach Kent Bothwell said he was not happy with the decision but 
declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
The teams were locked in a scoreless tie when the game was suspended in the 
fourth quarter after Palmdale's Darius Wilson attacked official Brad Woolley. 
Wilson was arrested and could face misdemeanor battery charges. He has been 
suspended from school. VINCE KOWALICK

49ERS MOVE GAME FROM CANDLESTICK TO STANFORD

Sunday's National Football League game between the San Francisco 49ers and New 
England Patriots will be played at Stanford Stadium in nearby Palo Alto, while 
preparation continues to ready Candlestick Park for the resumption of the World 
Series next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Stanford and 49er officials met earlier today and arrived at that decision," 
David Brown of the Stanford sports information office said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman in the 49ers' ticket office at Candlestick Park confirmed the 
change. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to use Stanford was made after team officials toured Candlestick 
Park on Thursday morning, two days after the devastating Bay Area earthquake, 
and rejected that arena as the venue for the game. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said that a limited number of $25 tickets went on sale at Stanford on 
Thursday, with proceeds going to the Bay Area earthquake relief fund. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford Stadium has a capacity of 86,000, compared to Candlestick Park's 
65,701 seats. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said that the game will be televised on NBC as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
At least one 49er player was happy with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never played on it, but I've practiced on it and it's a real fast field," 
wide receiver Jerry Rice said. "As long as we stay home it's fine with me." 
</P>
<P>
It will be only the second home game of the season for the 49ers, who are 5-0 
on the road and lost their only home game, 13-12, to the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers inspected Stanford Stadium, located about 35 miles south of San 
Francisco, and found no structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pleased with how well it rode it out," athletic director Andy Geiger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers had Tuesday off, but Coach George Seifert said the building at their 
training headquarters in Santa Clara "rocked and rolled" during the 6.9 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
There were hairline cracks in the building's stucco, and a large picture and 10 
game balls on display in the main entrance fell to the floor.

A'S NELSON WAS A RELIEVED RELIEVER WHEN REUNITED WITH MISSING WIFE

<P>
Everyone who was at Candlestick Park Tuesday night has his own story to tell, 
and A's pitcher Gene Nelson has his. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the earthquake struck, Nelson looked out to the field boxes, where 
his family was supposed to be sitting. 
</P>
<P>
His son, David, was there. 
</P>
<P>
But where was his wife? 
</P>
<P>
Dave Perron, the A's director of community affairs, told Nelson that his wife 
had missed the family buses from Oakland to Candlestick for the game. Cecilia 
Nelson was apparently driving to the game, which meant crossing the Bay Bridge, 
part of which had collapsed when the earthquake hit at 5:04 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pretty nervous," Nelson said. "I know how long it takes to get . . . 
here and that she must've been on the bridge somewhere around 5:04. 
</P>
<P>
"And then to go for a long period of time without knowing . . . " 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Cecilia had crossed the bridge safely but didn't reach 
Candlestick until after the earthquake hit. 
</P>
<P>
"She got held up at the toll booth," Nelson said. "After the earthquake, they 
wouldn't let anyone into the parking lot. My son was driven to the game in 
another car and kept telling me she couldn't have been more than five minutes 
behind him." 
</P>
<P>
Once the game was postponed, Nelson and his son began scouring the parking lot 
and, eventually, Cecilia was sighted. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, I found her," Nelson said with a sigh. "Believe me, I felt a lot of 
relief." MIKE PENNER

Anglers are loading their sacks as the terrific run of albacore and tuna is 
within a one-and two-day reach of South Bay sportfishers. 
</P>
<P>
The big outbreak of albacore started last month, prompting local sportfishers 
to schedule three-to-five day trips. 
</P>
<P>
Now the big bite is just 90 miles out and has surpassed last year's catch 
counts. 
</P>
<P>
The El Dorado from Long Beach Sportfishing found solid action south of San 
Clemente Island. Capt. Cookie Cook said he made 30 jig stops on the two-day run 
and anglers caught tuna up to 60-plus pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, 72, who has been on many tuna trips in the past 40 years, noted that he 
hadn't seen the abundance of tuna like this for many years. 
</P>
<P>
Every stop resulted in consistent hookups. The only puzzle he can't solve is 
the albacore average of only eight pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Yellow fin and blue fin tuna mixed with the albacore are heavyweights. 
</P>
<P>
Leroy Januwc of San Pedro was a jackpot winner with his 65-pound yellow fin 
tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Villaionoz of Redondo Beach decked a 53-pound yellow fin tuna. John 
Meinich, also of Redondo Beach, decked a blue fin tuna weighing 44 pounds. The 
total catch was 200 albacore, 106 blue fin tuna and 72 yellow fin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Manhattan Beach angler Ted Mancki, fishing in the second annual Oceans Shootout 
in San Diego, took grand angler honors fishing aboard the Apollo with a 
110-pound bigeye tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Drulias of Rancho Palos Verdes just returned from Cabo San Lucas with a 
255-pound blue marlin. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Fleming of Wilmington, trolling aboard the Ghetto Queen for marlin at 
Avalon, had a marlin jumper hit his mackerel. It escaped as a school of sharks 
attacked the bait. Pulling his trolling line, Fleming brought aboard a 77 
1/4-pound mako shark. 
</P>
<P>
The Cabrillo Beach launch ramp has been closed until spring, 1990. Work is 
starting on new floats and dredging of sand that has built up at the ramp. 
</P>
<P>
An alternate ramp for South Bay small boat anglers is the Redondo Beach ramp 
site.

CAR SEATS -- WHAT IS BEST FOR CHILD?; 
</P>
<P>
AUTO SAFETY: EXPERTS ARE DIVIDED OVER WHETHER BOOSTER SEATS OR LAP BELTS ARE 
THE BEST WAY TO PROTECT THE YOUNG ONES IN THE CAR.

The second baby has arrived, so it's time to play musical car seats. If you 
were thinking of putting junior in a booster seat so the baby can have his car 
safety seat, you may want to think twice about it. 
</P>
<P>
Safety specialists are divided over the issue of how safe booster seats (small 
car seats without backs or sides) really are. 
</P>
<P>
Some say the right booster seat used under the right conditions is perfectly 
safe. Others believe they do not provide as much protection as a simple lap 
belt, especially when used on children who are too small for them. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel anyone putting a child who is under 40 pounds in a booster is really 
looking for a lot of trouble," says Lorrie Walker, a safety trainer with the 
American Academy of Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
As children reach the toddler stage, many parents make the switch from a car 
seat to a booster seat, thinking it is just as safe. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, booster seats must pass the same crash standards as car 
seats. According to Kent Milton, a spokesman for the National Highway 
Transportation Safety Administration, all of the booster seats on the market 
were tested in January and all of them passed the government-set standards. 
Previously, Milton says, Pride-Trimble's Click'n Go had failed the compliance 
test. Pride-Trimble last year recalled at least 6,000 booster seats carrying 
the model numbers 890, 892 and 891. They've since been modified and replaced 
with models bearing the numbers 890-1, 891-1 and 892-1. The company's newly 
designed booster seats passed the January compliance test as well, Milton says. 
</P>
<P>
But the American Academy of Pediatrics says the safety level of booster seats 
depends on the type of booster seat and the circumstances under which they are 
used. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no one answer. That's the problem," says the academy's Walker. "A lot 
of it depends on the booster seat used, the size and the age of the child, the 
lap and shoulder belt system in the car. 
</P>
<P>
"In some cases your child may be better off with just a lap belt in the back 
seat," says Walker. "At least the child isn't going to be ejected." 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Weber, senior research associate at the University of Michigan School 
of Medicine, has conducted more than 100 tests on booster seats. Weber says 
there has never been a case in the United States where a child was ejected from 
a properly used booster seat. 
</P>
<P>
But she agrees that a child may be better off in a simple lap belt if the 
alternative is a low-shield booster seat that is kept in place with a lap belt. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with boosters that only require a lap belt is that there is nothing 
to prevent the child from moving forward on impact. A booster with a 
shoulder-lap belt will prevent the child from being ejected or hitting the 
shield. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been injuries of children, abdominal injuries because their torso 
hasn't been restrained," Walker says. 
</P>
<P>
The best type of booster seat to use is one with a large frontal shield that is 
kept in place with a shoulder-lap belt. 
</P>
<P>
Although manufacturers generally say booster seats can be used for children 20 
to 70 pounds, Walker says that simply isn't the case. 
</P>
<P>
Any child who can see out of the car window is too big for a booster and would 
be better off in the back seat with a shoulder-lap belt. 
</P>
<P>
Children under 40 pounds should never be put in a booster seat, according to 
the American Academy of Pediatrics. Walker says children under 40 pounds are 
too small and can slide around too much during a collision. In the long run, 
Walker says a child under 40 pounds who sits still would be better off in a lap 
belt than in a booster seat if the child can properly wear a lap belt. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with questions about car seat safety can call (800) CAR-BELT, the 
American Academy of Pediatrics' toll-free number.

ROGER SIMON: STANDING UP FOR NEW UNDERDOGS

<TEXT>
<P>
The rich are different from you and me: They have more enemies. 
</P>
<P>
I am not one of them, however. 
</P>
<P>
I like the rich. And I'll give you an example of why. 
</P>
<P>
When rich people go to lunch and the check comes, this is what you hear: 
</P>
<P>
"I'll get it." 
</P>
<P>
"No, let me." 
</P>
<P>
"No, I'll get it." 
</P>
<P>
"No, I insist." 
</P>
<P>
When my friends and I go to lunch and the check comes, this is what you hear: 
</P>
<P>
"Who had the meatball sub?" 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have an appetizer." 
</P>
<P>
"She never brought my Coke." 
</P>
<P>
"I only have a dollar." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, I am not afraid to admit I am a defender of the rich. And the rich 
certainly need defending these days. That's because of what Malcolm Forbes 
recently did. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes, a magazine publisher with oodles of money, threw a 70th birthday party 
for himself two months ago. He flew 600 of his closest friends -- some of whom 
he actually knew -- over to Morocco for a big party. It was a real extravaganza 
and it cost Forbes $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since, there has been a firestorm of criticism. There have been magazine 
articles, columns, newspaper editorials and an entire half-hour of "Nightline" 
devoted to attacking Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
I have read and watched it all. And the one thing I learned is that the rich 
are not supposed to spend their money. Or, at the very least, they are not 
supposed to spend it in extravagant and foolish ways. 
</P>
<P>
But if you can't spend your money in extravagant and foolish ways, what's the 
point of being rich? 
</P>
<P>
Forbes, as near as I can tell, did not knife anybody to get his money. He did 
not pull off any stock market swindles or even dress in leather and chains and 
vomit on stage during rock concerts to get his dough. 
</P>
<P>
Why am I sticking up for the rich? Well, because as wealthy as they are, I feel 
sorry for them. That's because many of them are as dumb as doorknobs. 
</P>
<P>
That's right. You do not have to be smart to be rich. You just have to find 
people dumber than you to buy whatever you are selling. 
</P>
<P>
Take Forbes' party. Boy, was it dumb. He had a perfect right to throw it, but 
it was still dumb. I'll prove it: 
</P>
<P>
What does Malcolm Forbes do? He holds a party in Morocco in August. And guess 
what his equally dumbo rich friends find out? Gossip columnist Liz Smith, who 
went to the party, complained about it in print and on TV. She got to Morocco 
in August and found out it was hot. 
</P>
<P>
Liz never guessed that the desert wasn't air-conditioned! How was she to know? 
It wasn't on the invitation. 
</P>
<P>
So she and the other guests got there and sweated like absolute hogs. 
</P>
<P>
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
</P>
<P>
Which is another reason we should appreciate the rich: They are always good for 
a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
But some journalists got angry at Forbes because they were afraid he was going 
to deduct the cost of the party from his taxes. They saw no reason for the 
American taxpayer to subsidize Forbes' luxuries. 
</P>
<P>
They are right. And, as it turned out, Forbes is not deducting the party from 
his taxes. 
</P>
<P>
But I sure hope none of the journalists who complained ever go out to lunch 
with "sources" and then turn in the tab as a business expense. 
</P>
<P>
And I wonder about those newspapers that did editorials criticizing Forbes. I 
wonder how many of those newspapers own skyboxes or season tickets to sporting 
events? That's 80% tax-deductible too. And the American taxpayer is forced to 
subsidize that luxury. 
</P>
<P>
So let's play fair. As long as Forbes gives to charity and doesn't try to get 
the rest of us to pay for his parties, I say let him go ahead and make a dork 
out of himself. 
</P>
<P>
And I've got a suggestion for his next bash: 
</P>
<P>
I hear Iceland in January is simply splendid.

JAN MORRIS FINDS PEACE IN 'PLEASURES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN ALLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Morris established a reputation as one of the world's premier journalists 
in 1953, when, at the age of 26, he climbed Mt. Everest with Sir Edmund Hillary 
and filed exclusive reports of the expedition with the London Times. 
</P>
<P>
Later, as a staff writer for the Manchester Guardian, he covered the Moscow 
trial of Francis Gary Powers and the Jerusalem trial of Adolf Eichmann, and 
began writing the travel essays and historical books that brought him a second 
round of celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
A third bout with fame of an unrelated (and somewhat unwanted) sort followed in 
the early 1970s, when Morris flew to Casablanca to undergo the last phase in a 
six-year-long process of changing his sex. 
</P>
<P>
When Morris returned to England, now as Jan Morris, she explored her life in a 
best-selling 1974 biography, "Conundrum." That has now been followed up with a 
book that's a sequel of sorts, "Pleasures of a Tangled Life," published this 
fall by Random House. 
</P>
<P>
The new book is more lighthearted. "People always think of me in terms of 
'Conundrum,' " she explains, "and I wanted to portray the other half -- to show 
that my life has really been one of great pleasure and show all the fun I've 
had." 
</P>
<P>
Part informal chat, part memoirs of a cheerful eccentric, "Pleasures of a 
Tangled Life" is a book of 35 short essays on the joys of travel and the joys 
of staying home, the joys of being alone and being with friends, and the joys 
of the past and the joys of the present. 
</P>
<P>
Trefan Morys, her home in Cymru, Wales, ranks among Morris' favorite pleasures. 
Among the others that she sketches in her new book are watching ships; good 
wine; books (her own and others); walks; friendships; and Cymraeg, the Welsh 
language. 
</P>
<P>
And, as Morris readily admits, a healthy dislike can be enervating in and of 
itself. Among the things she confesses to loathing are zoos, organized 
religions of all sorts, "all aspects and symptoms of authority, anywhere in the 
world," and sitting through concerts. ("Music, to my mind, is best enjoyed by 
oneself and in freedom, as one enjoys nature.") 
</P>
<P>
"I am merely out to show once more," she writes in the first chapter, "by the 
examples of my own life and taste, out of my peculiar circumstances, what a 
pleasure pleasures are." 
</P>
<P>
Eating lunch at a sidewalk cafe in Beverly Hills, Morris looks like a proper 
Welsh woman, with the broad-shouldered good humor of both Barbara Bush and 
Barbara Woodhouse. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to reconcile the image of the young journalist who scaled Mt. Everest 
with this cheerful woman in her yellow pullover, simple bead necklace, sensible 
athletic shoes, and bifocals. Her laughter is loud and frequent. Her thoughts, 
no matter how mildly expressed, are unmistakably those of Jan Morris as 
expressed in her books: sensual, fanciful, occasionally shocking, and often 
contradictory. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't got many opinions, but the ones I've got I rather enjoy expressing," 
she says, ordering a second glass of milk. 
</P>
<P>
Morris describes herself, for instance, as "an animal liberationist of almost 
atavistic passion," and yet freely admits that she has neither ever worked for 
an animal-rights group, nor is she a vegetarian. "I accept that Nature itself 
is carnivorous." Morris bites into her omelet and smiles. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you like dill?" she asks, suddenly sunny. "It's my favorite taste in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of next year, Morris is leaving Wales for an undetermined 
amount of time and traveling to Sydney, which will be the subject of her next 
book. (She's also been offered the job of literary editor of the Sydney Morning 
Herald.) Although Morris has always preferred to live in the country, her books 
have celebrated the joys of cities: Venice, Hong Kong, Cairo and others. And 
while her work has introduced her to the famous and powerful, she prefers to 
avoid such encounters. 
</P>
<P>
As a correspondent for Rolling Stone in the 1970s, she was sent to Panama to 
file a report, an experience she details in "Pleasures." 
</P>
<P>
Morris had met Col. Manuel Noriega, then chief of security police for the 
Panamanian government, and was invited to his bunker for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"He never showed up, and I was glad," says Morris, "because if he did, I would 
have felt obliged to report some dull thing he said." 
</P>
<P>
With nothing else to do, she explored his room and described what she saw as 
"like looking at the bedroom of an overindulged adolescent. The chrome and 
white leather objects, the pictures of girls and the cocktail cabinets. . . . 
We are ruled by children, I thought to myself as I looked at this, and of 
course it's true: The very instinct of authority is an instinct of immaturity, 
well worth the pleasure of laughing at whenever practicable, just to cut it 
down to size." 
</P>
<P>
Morris is markedly unenthusiastic when it comes to meeting heads of state or 
authority figures of any kind. "I used to think it was necessary to go meet 
people," she says, "but I gave that up. They never really tell you anything 
interesting." 
</P>
<P>
Public response to her works and her ideas, Morris admits, has always been 
important to her. And she sees "Pleasures," like "Conundrum," as "a very 
personal book. And it's a very vulnerable position that that book occupies. 
It's presenting yourself: Here I am, look at me. And naturally some people are 
going to say 'you're awful,' and others are going to say 'you're nice.' Of 
course, I want everyone to say 'you're nice.' " 
</P>
<P>
Reviewers and critics thought she was nice indeed until the publication of 
"Conundrum." Rebecca West, in the New York Times, wrote in 1974 that she found 
"Conundrum" to be "rather a record of a strange self-treatment for a neurotic 
condition." 
</P>
<P>
Nora Ephron, then a columnist for Esquire magazine, took it a step further. In 
an essay suffused with disgust, Ephron referred to the book's "overembellished 
and simile-laden verbiage that makes the style of Victorian woman novelists 
seem spare." She also called "Conundrum" "a mawkish and embarrassing book," and 
said, "Jan Morris is perfectly awful at being a woman; what she has become 
instead is exactly what James Morris wanted to become those many years ago. A 
girl. And worse, a 47-year-old girl." 
</P>
<P>
While admitting that she can't help reading reviews, Morris claims that this 
particular vituperation escaped her attention when it was published. "The bad 
ones (reviews) wound me terribly," she says, "and the good ones truly to make 
me swollen-headed. I try very hard not to read them, but I always fail." 
</P>
<P>
As to "Conundrum" and her sex-change operation, she considers it a closed 
chapter in her life, almost shrugging off the subject. "I think my problem is 
now being more publicly accepted. There was some error of hormones or something 
of that sort that I had to try to put right, that's all that was. 
</P>
<P>
"This book is about the pleasures that have come out of my tangled life. The 
tangles are more or less over with, really." 
</P>
<P>
One of the leitmotifs in "Pleasures" is the concept of hwyl, a Welsh word that 
originally referred to the billowing sail of a ship. Today it refers to, 
according to Morris, "a great feeling of largeness, of enjoyable passionate 
largeness. And from there, it's gone further. If you say goodby, you say 
'Ilwyl,' meaning 'Enjoy that sort of pleasure.' " 
</P>
<P>
Today, Jan Morris derives hwyl from Trefan Morys, her home in the northern 
Welsh countryside, of which she writes, "I love it above all inanimate objects, 
and above a good many animate ones too. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"When I come back to it after a long journey, opening with its big 18th-Century 
key its crooked blue-painted front door -- when I enter its presence once again 
I experience more than mere relief or comfort, but something undeniably akin to 
lechery." 
</P>
<P>
In "Pleasures," Morris also writes tenderly of Elizabeth Tuckniss, whom she 
divorced following the sex-change operation, but with whom she continues to 
live and travel: "I have lived with one partner for nearly 40 years, through a 
greater permutation of sexual relationships than a Grecian fabulist could 
conceive, and out of it all I have drawn the conclusion that the ultimate 
object of sex is not physical after all, but spiritual . . . the sealing of 
profounder unions." 
</P>
<P>
It's a union she intends to continue into death, having long ago purchased both 
a double funeral plot and a single gravestone, bearing the Welsh inscription 
DYMA MAE DWY FFRIND, AR DERFYN UN BYWYD ("Here are two friends, at the end of 
one life"). 
</P>
<P>
The gravestone has become part of Morris' legend, having stood in the author's 
library since the early 1970s. When asked about it, Morris laughs, as if living 
with one's gravestone is quite a natural thing. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted people to know of my love affair," she explains. "I was moved by that 
affair, as I still am. I wanted to make something beautiful of it, and place it 
in a beautiful place, so we would always be remembered when people step over 
us. If I say it myself, that will probably be the one thing I'll be remembered 
for, that little slab of slate." 
</P>
<P>
But to keep it in the library? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, Elizabeth puts it under the stairs; she's not quite so keen on it as I 
am," Morris explains. 
</P>
<P>
She laughs and shrugs. "I didn't have a choice, really, but to put it 
somewhere."

MAKING OF THE ATOMIC NIGHTMARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As the first atomic bomb roars to life in "Fat Man and Little Boy" (citywide), 
we see a chilling image, as horrific in its way as the roiling cloud overhead: 
project director J. Robert Oppenheimer, his mouth an opened O, the flesh of his 
face rippling like a sheet of rubber from the bomb's air blast, twin yellow 
fireballs reflected in his black goggles. 
</P>
<P>
This is the "mad scientist," late 20th-Century-style; the cornerstone image of 
the film and director Roland Joffe's cyanide-capsule comment on the 
intellectual tempted into playing God. 
</P>
<P>
With co-writer Bruce Robinson, Joffe understandably sees this temptation as one 
with irrevocable consequences for the planet. But while his film makes that 
point with the fullest poignance, it also takes until its last quarter to 
gather its power, and its poetic eye is paired with a flat voice and an oddly 
tin ear. 
</P>
<P>
It's Gen. Leslie Groves (Paul Newman), a hefty, politically conservative 
engineer who becomes the unlikely Devil to Oppenheimer's Faust. Not one to be 
argued with, Groves picks Oppenheimer (Dwight Schultz) to head the Manhattan 
Project because he suspects the man's genius and chooses to ignore Army 
counterintelligence warnings about the scientist's left-wing background. 
Sports, Groves once conceded to an interviewer, were the only things he could 
see that Oppenheimer didn't know everything about. 
</P>
<P>
Newman and Schultz are arrestingly matched and not playing the title characters 
(Little Boy was the code name of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima Aug. 6, 1945, 
and Fat Man was the Nagasaki bomb, dropped three days later). Schultz's 
"Oppie," charismatic from his first exchange with Groves, is a believably 
complicated figure, a commanding, prideful, prickly egghead. It's said that his 
style and his skill at the romantic gesture also made him irresistible to 
women, a quality harder to see. Oppie's wife, Kitty (Bonnie Bedelia), and 
mistress, Jean Tatlock (Natasha Richardson), go through their own form of hell 
for him, but we're never exactly sure why. 
</P>
<P>
Newman's Groves, unconvincing only at being bulky, is far from Oppenheimer's 
disdainful appraisal of him as a meatball and a cipher. In an entirely 
different way, Groves is equally commanding, the sort of man who can say -- and 
believe -- that God is on the side of the bomb-builders. And in the film, he is 
the steam that drives the engine of Oppenheimer's darkest ambitions. It's one 
of Newman's biggest stretches and most complex achievements. 
</P>
<P>
The film cuts background explanations short, so that after Groves checks with 
Chicago-based nuclear physicist Leo Szilard (Gerald Hiken) -- reduced here to a 
waggish bit role in the bathtub -- to learn whether such a weapon could even be 
created, the focus quickly shifts to Los Alamos, built almost under our eyes. 
There, the Oppenheimer-picked team of physicists, biochemists and 
mathematicians, and their families, are literally isolated, and Groves' strict 
code of secrecy and the scientists' habits of sharing each discovery communally 
clash almost daily. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the towering figures of the project -- the Tellers, the Fermis, et 
al., whom we meet offhandedly as "Edward" or "Enrico," and really never get to 
know as individuals -- there is a fictitious pair, young Michael Merriman (John 
Cusack, supposedly a composite of several scientists) and an outspokenly 
dove-ish nurse, Kathleen Robinson (Laura Dern). Put there clearly to be the 
film's young lovers-in-optimism, they are fine actors who give sweetness and 
reality to characters of the purest papier-mache. 
</P>
<P>
Like the bomb itself, stirring to life over years, the film comes to life 
slowly. The push and pull of Groves and Oppenheimer remains the fascination of 
the story, but between them and the frustrations in bomb-building, the rest of 
the characters have to be content with little scraps of scenes. That's 
especially hard when you have an actress like Bedelia, whose presence and 
complexities make you want to see more, not less of her. (Incidentally, showing 
Kitty Oppenheimer glowingly pregnant, then just as glowingly thin again, 
without explanation, is a terrible mistake. Birth? Death? Trauma? Diapers? 
Directors shouldn't do this; audiences worry, even subliminally.) 
</P>
<P>
There is tension throughout the movie, but its last quarter contains the film's 
real philosophical meat, the moral dilemma of some of the scientists about 
whether, in the wake of V-E Day, the bomb they have raced to build should ever 
be detonated, even as a threat. To make this quandary immediate to us -- here 
before August, 1945 -- the writers have created a lab accident that exposes one 
of the young scientists to a lethal dose of radiation, then intercut his 
agonies with preparations for the pre-dawn test in the desert. (There was a 
real accident, but it came after the war ended, and the length of time it took 
that scientist to die was more extended.) 
</P>
<P>
This barefaced device does exactly what it's meant to: No one seeing this 
suffering can help but multiply this young man by 200,000 -- the number of 
Japanese dead in both blasts. It might possibly be considered a forgivable 
invention. 
</P>
<P>
But another, almost throwaway statistic, delivered by John McGinley's doctor, 
that the government has been "injecting the old and mentally ill with 
plutonium" at Oak Ridge is more electrifying and harder to authenticate. It's 
not mentioned in the bible on the subject, Richard Rhodes' "The Making of the 
Atomic Bomb," and in a New York Times interview last week, Rhodes was quoted as 
being "bothered" by the scene because he "doubted that it happened." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, that last statistic is actually extraneous. Remove it, and the last 
20 minutes of "Fat Man and Little Boy" still qualify as civilization's most 
authentic nightmare. Whatever his film's contrivances as it builds, with this 
closing, Joffe has made a permanent contribution to our national insomnia.

STILL THE GREATEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The winner and still champ: the Rolling Stones. 
</P>
<P>
On a night when rock 'n' roll's most celebrated survivors played with such 
passion and fire at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum that they looked as 
though they could go on convincingly for another 10 years, Guns N' Roses, the 
young Los Angeles rock upstarts, made you wonder Wednesday whether they were 
going to even survive the concert. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of hot-tempered remarks during his group's 80-minute set, Guns lead 
singer Axl Rose not only fueled the controversy over the racial and sexual 
epithets in the band's song "One in a Million," but he twice suggested that the 
four-day Coliseum stand, which concludes with shows Saturday and Sunday, may be 
his last performances with the band. 
</P>
<P>
The concert loomed as a classic rock 'n' roll showdown: a generational battle 
of the bands. 
</P>
<P>
But the Stones simply had too many weapons: too much historic aura, too many 
great songs and too splendid a lineup of musicians. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Stones' songs (especially "Play With Fire" and "2,000 Light Years") 
are too dated, and others are decidedly marginal ("Harlem Shuffle," "Undercover 
of the Night"), but the best of the Stones' rockers ("Start Me Up," "Brown 
Sugar") and the most seductive of the band's mood pieces ("Tumbling Dice," 
"Honky Tonk Women") are rock hallmarks. 
</P>
<P>
The Stones, with good reason, have been called the world's greatest rock 'n' 
roll band for so long -- at least since the early '70s -- that for years no one 
has even considered an alternative. It wasn't until the band's recent 
seven-year layoff from touring that rock observers started wondering if the 
band -- nearing its third decade -- should pass the torch. 
</P>
<P>
Guns N' Roses isn't the only contender, but it is the only one appearing with 
the Stones during the band's 3 1/2-month tour. The group -- whose bad-boy 
stance is reminiscent of the Stones' role in the '60s and early '70s -- is the 
most celebrated hard-rock outfit of the '80s. Its first two albums have sold an 
estimated 12 million copies. 
</P>
<P>
The Coliseum bill -- it's the only place Guns N' Roses is appearing on the 
Stones tour -- is so hot that nearly 280,000 people will see the four shows. 
Ticket brokers around town reported brisk business, commanding as much as $700 
for choice seats. The souvenir stands at the Coliseum also reflected an 
awareness of the older Stones fans' affluence. Besides the standard $20 
T-shirts, booths offered such upscale concert items as a $450 leather jacket 
and a $190 flight jacket. 
</P>
<P>
Coming on stage shortly before 8 p.m., Rose didn't even wait for the rest of 
the quintet to get in place before grabbing the microphone and defending his 
right to use in "One in a Million" words deeply offensive to blacks and 
homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
"Before we start playing, (I want to say) I'm sick of all this publicity about 
our song," he said in an expletive-filled tirade to an estimated 72,000 fans. 
He then denied he was a racist, but suggested that selective use of the words 
-- against particular members of those groups who offend you -- is acceptable. 
"If you still want to call me a racist, you can . . . shove it. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Rose's defense is likely to anger further those who have been offended by the 
song. It's one thing to argue for the limited use of those words as social 
realism in art, but it shows a lack of sensitivity to use them as a part of 
your vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
It was soon apparent that his ire was not just directed at those who have 
challenged him on the language of "One in a Million." 
</P>
<P>
Before starting the second song, he again paused. "I don't like to do this on 
stage," he said, "But unless certain people in this band start getting their 
act together, these are going to be the last Guns N' Roses shows," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While fans looked at each other in amazement, Rose -- known to be a volatile, 
highly spontaneous performer -- continued: "I'm sick and tired of too many 
people in this organization dancing with Mr. Brownstone," a reference to a Guns 
N' Roses song dealing with drug use. 
</P>
<P>
Later, returning for the encore of "Paradise City," he again seemed agitated. 
"Before we begin, I'd like to announce this is my last gig with Guns N' Roses." 
He then added, with an air of disillusionment, that there's no need to look for 
a Paradise City because none exists. 
</P>
<P>
(The band's management had no comment Thursday on the group's status for the 
Coliseum shows on Thursday, Saturday and Sunday). 
</P>
<P>
It was both a troubling and fascinating display -- one that will probably go 
down as a storied moment in L.A. rock. Rose has the potential to be one of the 
most compelling figures in American rock since the late Jim Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
Like Morrison, Rose exhibits a fierce independence that sometimes leads to 
errors in judgment as he races in a somewhat romantic pursuit of artistic 
truth. He also shares Morrison's duality: exploring the dark side of man's 
nature (the fast-lane corruption of "Welcome to the Jungle") while also 
possessing an almost old-fashioned yearning for innocence ("Sweet Child o' 
Mine"). 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of the anger Wednesday, for instance, Rose led the audience on a 
disarming sing-along of Bob Dylan's wistful "Knockin' on Heaven's Door." 
</P>
<P>
The most striking of the similarities with Morrison, however, is Rose's 
tendency on stage to act on raw impulse and emotion. He is someone that you 
can't take your eyes off. There is a sense of genuine involvement -- rather 
than rote -- in both his soft, swaying movements as he sings, and in the way he 
searches vocally to find some new truth every time he sings a song. 
</P>
<P>
Rose seems to get so caught up emotionally in the song that he disregards his 
own safety. At one point early in the set, he fell approximately six feet after 
he accidentally stepped off a dark edge of the main floor while singing 
"Patience," one of Guns' hit singles. He landed on his side on a platform and 
appeared stunned, losing his balance as he tried to regain his footing. 
Finally, a security guard helped him up. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, Rose stepped down to the Coliseum floor and shook hands with fans as 
he moved along a wooden partition that separates the audience from the 
technicians in front of the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Whether because of or despite its raw edges, Guns N' Roses has become the most 
absorbing hard-rock band to emerge in the '80s, and it may again challenge for 
the title -- if it survives. But you can't beat a great team by showing the 
divisions that Guns N' Roses did. 
</P>
<P>
The group did supply one element Wednesday that the Stones no longer have: A 
sense of spontaneity. It wasn't however, enough. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when the Stones were branded as irresponsible in their use of 
language and as rude in their behavior as Guns N' Roses is now. What those 
criticisms missed was the excellence of the Stones' music, and it's that music 
that now enables the group to continue to be such a wonderfully stirring 
attraction. 
</P>
<P>
After the emotional high-wire act of Rose, the Stones seemed almost quaintly 
tame. The show moved as smoothly as a Broadway revue -- but what a revue. 
</P>
<P>
The stage set is a futuristic construction site that, through use of lighting, 
shifts during the evening to serve as either an unsettling display of urban 
decay or a more optimistic statement of social and urban renewal. 
</P>
<P>
The lighting, too, is dazzling as it changes from red-hell alarm (during 
"Sympathy for the Devil") to a comforting blue ("You Can't Always Get What You 
Want"). There's also a sense of humor as 50-foot high balloons in the shape of 
bar girls brighten "Honky Tonk Women." 
</P>
<P>
Wearing the same sporty green leather tails he wore at the start of the tour on 
Aug. 31 in Philadelphia, 46-year-old Mick Jagger set a fast opening pace as he 
skipped around the stage with the energy of a man half his age. 
</P>
<P>
Guitarists Keith Richards and Ron Wood, drummer Charlie Watts and bassist Bill 
Wyman have been joined by keyboardists Chuck Leavell and Matt Clifford, 
saxophonist Bobby Keys, three backup singers and a three-piece horn section. 
These musicians have all been woven into the Stones' traditional blues-based 
rock sound without making it appear either unnecessarily fancy or uptown. 
</P>
<P>
Richards has always said that he doesn't worry about growing old because he's 
seen his treasured bluesmen play into their 60s and 70s. That gives him and the 
Stones a long time to go. The question on recent tours was whether they would 
still be accepted by young audiences. 
</P>
<P>
The response of the young fans on this tour -- and about two-thirds of the 
crowd on most tour stops is under 21 -- is that the Stones hold up well. Even 
those fans predicting a Guns N' Roses victory in Wednesday's showdown expressed 
admiration for the Stones. Their fondness for Guns was based on matters of 
generational pride. "This is my band," said Robert Sanchez, 20, of Hollywood. 
"The Stones are my dad's band." 
</P>
<P>
After the concert, Martin Miller, 36, of La Habra had a comment that appeared 
more typical of the older Stones fans on hand. "Guns N' Roses," he said 
sarcastically, "may be a great band -- let's see in 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Living Colour, the opening act, was in the difficult position of beginning its 
set at 6 p.m., when only about 5,000 people were in their seats and it was 
still daylight. But the New York group, led by guitarist-songwriter Vernon 
Reid, put on a crowd-pleasing mix of almost metal-ish force and songs with 
substance and social relevance. The only weak link is the stiffness of lead 
singer Corey Glover. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson of Wednesday's show is that it's doubtful that any band can step on 
stage with enough good-to-great familiar songs and with enough historical 
mystique to take the rock crown away from the Stones. The Stones can only be 
upstaged when they no longer play their music with the energy and commitment it 
deserves. Don't expect it to happen soon.

Life gets more exciting for Chris Burke of ABC's "Life Goes On." The young 
actor, who has Down's syndrome, has been invited to the White House to appear 
with President Bush in a public service announcement tied to National Down's 
Syndrome Month. On the spot, the President talks about the importance of 
weaving messages into programming, in this case using handicapped individuals. 
Making the trip with Chris on Wednesday will be his parents, along with "Life 
Goes On" creator and executive producer Michael Braverman and co-executive 
producer Rick Rosenthal. A Rose Garden reception will follow the taping.

A collection of 44 paintings belonging to the estate of the son of the founder 
of Campbell's Soup has sold for a record $116 million at Sotheby's auction 
house in New York. Erratic bidding Wednesday night saw record highs and 
unexpected lows, but ended with the largest total ever paid for a private 
collection. The works, including Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and modern 
paintings by Monet, Picasso, Van Gogh, Renoir and Degas among others, belonged 
to John T. Dorrance, whose father founded Campbell's. Dorrance died in April. 
An unexpected record for Henri Matisse's "Woman With Red Umbrella" came when it 
sold to an anonymous bidder via telephone for $12.3 million. However, Van 
Gogh's "Man at Sea," which portrays a woman clutching her child awaiting her 
husband's return from the sea, sold for $7.15 million -- less than the $8 
million to $12 million presale estimate -- to Kiyotaka Kori, a Tokyo dealer 
representing Aska International, a Japanese concern. The record for a single 
collection sale had been $85 million, set last November at Christie's auction 
house for the William Goetz collection. Sotheby's had a low estimate of $93.5 
million and a high figure of $129 million for the Dorrance collection. 
Sotheby's reported that 15 of the 44 lots went to Japanese bidders. ALEENE

'GROSS ANATOMY' NEEDS SOME SCRIPT SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The young medical students in "Gross Anatomy" (citywide) -- five hopeful 
surgeons sharing the same dissection table during a punishing first med-school 
year -- aren't the kind you'd want pawing around your pancreas in some 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Self-centered, callous, shallow, they don't express much desire to help people 
beyond the formula rote idealism you'd expect from students-on-the-make. Except 
for pregnant young Kim (Alice Carter), they seem low on sensitivity, as well. 
These are kids, and a movie, with tunnel vision: yuppie-doctors-in-embryo. One 
of them (Todd Field) pops pills and hides biochemistry textbooks naear his 
cadaver. Another (John Scott Clough) is a silk-shirted apple-polisher. They're 
privileged kids for whom success is a touchstone. The major seeming exception, 
fisherman's son Joe Slovak (Matthew Modine), is slotted as the group's sexy 
rebel. He bounces a basketball on the way to his class locker. 
</P>
<P>
This sounds like good meat for a satire of the medical profession -- a movie 
that might cheerfully savage its mercenary tendencies -- and "MASH" and "The 
Paper Chase" are the obvious inspirations, along with the real-life experiences 
of co-producer and ex-med student Howard Rosenman. 
</P>
<P>
But "Gross Anatomy" isn't really geared for satire or humorous realism. There's 
a charismatic mentor here, like "Paper Chase's" Prof. Kingsfield, plus some of 
"MASH's" jock irreverence and a pale carbon of its hip, funny attitude toward 
gore. Mostly, though, the five writers who've pawed over this story in three 
shifts have shot it full of '80s raw pragmatism and sentimental tomfoolery and 
left it anesthetized on the table, full of cheerless twitches and spasmodic 
eruptions of programmed mirth. 
</P>
<P>
There's another deodorant-ad notion of a love affair: Novak and Laurie (Daphne 
Zuniga) do much of their wooing on a jogging track and, when Laurie succumbs, 
she says simply "You got me!" Novak's rebellion, meanwhile, is limited to 
helping his roommate cheat on exams and cheerfully telling his examiners that 
he's in it for the money. (So, apparently, is the movie.) 
</P>
<P>
Christine Lahti is cast in the John Houseman-type role and, though she is a 
brilliant actress, she is used badly here. The script suggests that Lahti's Dr. 
Woodruff sees Joe as a kindred spirit: a rebel, an outsider, a born doctor. 
Instead, she seems another movie fairy godmother, inexplicably hung up on a 
self-absorbed goof-off. When, in the movie's big passing-the-torch scene, Joe 
finds her wasting away from lupus and begins screaming "What do you want from 
me?," you want to set him right back to his fisherman dad, perhaps to be used 
as bait. 
</P>
<P>
Is this any way for a potential surgeon to act toward an obviously dying woman? 
You'd like to think the writers are being sarcastic with Dr. Woodruff's 
response -- she gives him a be-all-that-you-can-be speech -- but no such luck. 
Fifty years ago, Joe would have been wafted with a heavenly choir out of this 
benediction from his female Dr. Chips straight to worldwide surgical fame. 
Here, we know we're heading toward the '80s equivalent: a climactic sexy clinch 
with Daphne Zuniga and soft-rock under the credits. 
</P>
<P>
The director of "Gross Anatomy" (MPAA-rated PG-13 for sex and language), Thom 
Eberhardt ("Night of the Comet"), shows occasional verve and a lively touch 
with the actors -- especially Modine and Field, surprisingly good as Joe's 
amphetamine-crazed roommate. But there's a no-exit shallowness to this '80s 
sentimentalism where people scream, rage and insult each other, cheat, strive 
ruthlessly for success, and go warm and gooey after they pass the final exam. 
Who needs heavenly choirs? "Gross," in this case, describes the anatomy class 
and the movie itself.

'ZERO' DOESN'T ADD UP AS A THRILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The one thing you can say for "Apartment Zero" (at the Royal) is that they've 
got that numeral in the title right: This overwrought and underdeveloped 
psychological thriller with heavy-handed political implications adds up to 
exactly nothing. 
</P>
<P>
It's the kind of genre piece in which logic must be airtight, yet fledgling 
film maker Martin Donovan would have us believe that you can fall down a 
stairwell and emerge with only a cut over your eye, and that a shrewd serial 
killer would leave incriminating photos in a dresser drawer. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing, however, makes much sense right from the start. We soon learn that 
Hart Bochner's handsome, insinuating Jack Carney has every reason to seek 
privacy and security, yet he rents a room from Colin Firth's Adrian LeDuc, who 
clearly spells trouble for him. A fussy, overattentive and intensely repressed 
film buff with an incestuous passion for his crazy hospitalized mother, LeDuc 
registers an instant attraction to Jack, who responds with a laid-back, 
tantalizing seductiveness. Since there is no credibility in Jack accepting 
Adrian as a landlord -- let alone toying with such an up-tight, obvious weirdo 
-- there is really no credibility in all that follows. 
</P>
<P>
Donovan seems to have overdosed on Losey's "The Servant," Polanski's "The 
Tenant" and the Roeg-Cammell "Performance" -- just for starters. He strives to 
establish Jack and Adrian as one of those calamitous but inevitable teams, 
reminiscent of Chicago child-killers Leopold and Loeb, in which we're supposed 
to perceive larger meanings. The setting of "Apartment Zero" is present-day 
Buenos Aires, with Adrian as a native Argentine who insists on speaking English 
after having been raised in Great Britain and Jack as an American ostensibly 
there on some sort of corporate training program. Donovan and co-writer David 
Koepp attempt, in their increasingly morbid horror-picture context, to comment 
on the evil of the notorious death squads of Argentina's former military regime 
and to suggest further that killing becomes addictive. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the long-winded "Apartment Zero" is awkward to the point of 
ludicrousness. Firth has the determination and skill to make Adrian 
consistently pathetic and believable, but Bochner is allowed to lapse into 
striking attitudes and poses. British actresses Dora Bryan and Liz Smith play 
the nosiest of Adrian and Jack's neighbors as caricatures. With its 
tango-tinged score and moody lighting, "Apartment Zero" (Times-rated Mature) 
looks and sounds far better than it is.

MANGOS SOUTH PACIFIC SERVES UP A TASTY EXPERIMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here it is. You read it here first: absolutely the newest new cuisine in town! 
Are you ready? 
</P>
<P>
Nouvelle Polynesian. 
</P>
<P>
True, Mangos South Pacific Grill does not use that term. Possibly chef Colin 
Colville, who has cooked in a rather rarefied atmosphere (the Regency Club, La 
Couronne), is not even aware of the old Polynesian Cuisine, a fantasy style of 
cooking meant to evoke the Magic of the Islands that was the hottest thing in 
L.A. restaurants 30 or 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, it's Cantonese appetizers, Indonesian-like entrees and savage rum 
drinks with evocative names. We're too hip for that now, of course. Instead, 
what we find at Mangos is largely of Indonesian and Sichuanese (not Cantonese) 
inspiration, plus crazy-California pastas and sushi. Once in a while, here in 
today's South Pacific, one even sees the word Cajun. In place of rum, of 
course, there's Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
Well, these are some of our favorite things, and anyway Manhattan Beach could 
use a few more experimental restaurants -- rather than any more clones of 
Manhattan Coolers, for instance -- and the result is very pleasant. The menu 
changes from time to time, but you might start out with a big mass of marinated 
regional mushrooms accompanied by tiny grilled eggplants the size of your 
thumb, all in soy and vinegar. Or skewered bits of swordfish with a loudly 
garlicky peanut sauce and some lightly pickled Chinese cabbage on the side. 
</P>
<P>
One of my favorites is the semi-absurd Sichuan chicken wings: If I don't miss 
my guess, these grilled wings have simply been coated with jalapeno jelly, but 
they're fun anyway. Among the salads, which seem consistently good, there's a 
spinach model in a slightly sweet dressing memorably dosed with brutally hot 
Chinese mustard. 
</P>
<P>
Pear chutney has a faintly bogus ring, but it's perfectly sensible with the 
pork chop in a sweet-sour tamarind sauce. There has also been a fascinating 
tamarind chicken with an exotic scent of ground coriander. One dish that did 
strike me as bogus was scallops on "corn ratatouille," which is basically corn 
relish with some zucchini and tomato in it. It's a little like having scallops 
in fruit salad. 
</P>
<P>
It was with a snapper sandwich at lunch that I saw the words Cajun tartar sauce 
on the menu; tartar sauce with Tabasco in it, as it happened. The result wasn't 
bad, a generous grilled fish sandwich on a good French roll. A sort of peppery 
coleslaw came with it. Interesting. 
</P>
<P>
The pastas I've tried were also interesting . . . interesting for a couple of 
bites, that is. Unfortunately, they tended to taste like one thing all the way 
through, which is hard to carry off on a starch dish. Fettuccine (technically, 
fettucce riccie: broad fettuccine with rippled edges) came in a smoky-peppery 
cream sauce with wild mushrooms. It was interesting to start with, but like a 
life sentence to finish a whole plate. A very rich sauce of peanuts and mint 
gave the chicken tortellini a flavor oddly like Medieval food, a pleasant 
novelty at first that seems mawkish and ghastly after about six bites. 
</P>
<P>
The desserts are really pretty good. The very eggy creme brulee has a crisp 
sugar crust, and among the ice creams the vanilla bean has a particularly 
luscious flavor. The espresso ice cream is perhaps a shade too authentic, what 
with those fine coffee grounds peppering it. 
</P>
<P>
The South Pacific has been a stage for our fantasies for decades now. Mangos, 
with its rattan chairs and occasional panels of corrugated metal, not to 
mention one of the great sunset-watching windows of Manhattan Beach, belongs to 
a venerable tradition. But if only Chardonnays had names to compare with those 
of the old rum drinks. Ah, if only you could order a glass of 1986 Estate 
Bottled Missionary's Downfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Mangos South Pacific Grill, 1300 Highland Ave., Manhattan Beach; (213) 
545-2690. Open for lunch Monday through Friday, for dinner seven nights; 
weekend brunch. Beer and wine. Parking lot. MasterCard and Visa accepted. 
Dinner for two, food only, $30 to $64.

ETHNIC EATING: PAKISTANIS SET SPICY TABLE AT BUNDOO KHAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Picture a free-living Pathan tribesman on Pakistan's northwest frontier. He 
takes a handful of chopped meat, spices it vigorously and tosses it onto the 
grill. Pressing the meat flat with a big, rough hand, he cooks it to a 
sizzling, earthy brown. This is chaplee kebab, and you can have it at Bundoo 
Khan, a new Pakistani restaurant in mid Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province is mountainous land adjoining 
Afghanistan. In this rugged terrain, even vegetables are boldly cooked. Strong 
notes of vinegar, lemon juice and ginger turn a combination of ordinary produce 
such as cauliflower, broccoli and carrots into a dish that demands respect. And 
frontier gosht adds powerful seasonings to beef cubes grilled Pathan style. 
</P>
<P>
Away from the frontier, food is pretty zesty too, judging by the rest of Bundoo 
Khan's menu. Karahi gosht can be downright dangerous if you bite into one of 
the small green chiles simmered with this lamb dish. The grilled morsels of 
beef called boti kebab are thick with spice paste, and seekh kebab shows how 
spices can electrify ground beef. 
</P>
<P>
Even the vegetable samosas are exciting thanks to bright seasonings that 
include dried pomegranate seeds, cumin and garam masala. Another vegetable 
dish, aloo palak, includes spinach that might have been too hot for Popeye. The 
spinach hides little cubes of potato, and its dark hue shows off a scattering 
of golden channa dal, one of the pulses that add protein to Indian vegetarian 
dishes. 
</P>
<P>
One has to admire a fledgling restaurant (it opened in June) that is courageous 
enough to serve this intensely flavored food rather than taming it down for 
average palates. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is an Islamic state, and Bundoo Khan is Islamic right down to the sign 
by the door that warns against the drinking of alcoholic beverages. The flowing 
Arabic inscriptions on the wall plaques are passages from the Koran. And the 
menu makes it clear that the food is halal, meaning acceptable to Muslims. 
Meats come from animals that have been slaughtered according to Islamic 
precepts; pork is excluded. 
</P>
<P>
A rare Muslim dish that Bundoo Khan offers occasionally is haleem, a highly 
seasoned puree that includes whole wheat, three kinds of lentils and beef. The 
texture and flavor call to mind refried beans, but instead of cheese, the dish 
is garnished with fried onion shreds and ginger. Another special dish, nihari, 
features shreddy beef in a dark sauce that has a strong note of cloves. Ginger 
shreds and sliced hot green chiles augment the spices. 
</P>
<P>
Ready-made masalas (spice mixtures) for nihari and haleem are available down 
the street at the Islamic Food Mart, which is the source of Bundoo Khan's 
meats. The masalas, imported from Pakistan, come with recipes in English and 
Arabic. The market also stocks Pakistani mango chutney, which the restaurant 
serves along with its own tamarind and mint chutneys. 
</P>
<P>
What Bundoo Khan lacks is a tandoor oven, but you wouldn't know that from 
tasting the tangy, red-tinted chicken tikka. Whole roast chargha chicken 
curiously had very little flavor, although the seasonings included finely 
ground jalapenos, cilantro, mint, cloves and peppercorns. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of tandoori breads there are chapatis so large they have to be folded 
into the bread basket and parathas that are browned in oil to make the exterior 
crisp and flaky. Pistachio kulfi (ice cream) is far from mild. The flavoring 
that will make you wonder what you are tasting is kewra essence, which even in 
small quantities gives the effect of eating lumber in a pine forest. Here the 
dose is small enough to mute that woodsy quality. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a large chargha chicken at $20 and a whole roast leg of lamb for 
$50, the prices at Bundoo Khan are low. Most entrees, including the chaplee 
kebab, haleem and nihari, are $6.95. Two large samosas are $2, and aloo palak 
and frontier vegetables are each $3.95. Another dish worth trying is lamb 
biryani, a combination of lamb and rice for $6.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Bundoo Khan, 116 S. Vermont Ave., Los Angeles; (213) 380-7574. Open daily from 
11 a.m. to 11 p.m. MasterCard and Visa accepted. Free parking in the shopping 
center lot.

WHO KNOWS WHAT EVIL LURKS IN B-FILMS? THE PHANTOM KNOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Somewhere near your VCR you probably keep a movie reference book or two -- and 
if it's Leonard Maltin's excellent "TV Movies and Video Guide," you probably 
can do without all the others. (The 20th Anniversary Edition just hit the 
stands three weeks ago, all 1,277 pages of it -- $5.95 from Signet.) However, 
there's a new reference work that's worthy of standing alongside Maltin's: "The 
Phantom's Ultimate Video Guide" ($12.95 from Dell). 
</P>
<P>
Don't let the odd title put you off. The Phantom has been the anonymous B-film 
and video critic for the New York Daily News since 1984. His specialty (and the 
Phantom does indicate, at least, that he is male), to quote the cover, concerns 
"the weirdest, rarest action, horror, sci-fi, cult, camp, comedy and classic 
videos." Note the order and you'll get the idea. If it's scary, cheap, violent 
and/or exploitative and it's on videocassette, it's probably covered here. 
</P>
<P>
The Phantom's focus isn't the only thing that makes this book worth buying for 
video fans. He ends the 756-page book with a descriptive listing of mail-order 
and specialty video suppliers (with addresses and phone numbers). That's 
something you won't find in Maltin's work. 
</P>
<P>
Also to this incognito critic's credit: He doesn't go overboard with 
appreciation for "cult classics" -- the brief opinions are relatively reliable. 
And if the Phantom hasn't seen a film, he just decribes it and adds NR for "not 
rated." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of ratings, the Phantom and Maltin books share one minor but annoying 
omission: neither provides MPAA ratings (R, PG, etc.) when applicable. This 
added information would take little space and would be valuable, especially to 
parents renting tapes for the whole family or just for the kids. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
With most of the big early-to-mid-1989 films already out on video -- the 
outstanding exceptions being "Batman" (Nov. 15) and "Ghostbusters II" (Nov. 22) 
-- the emphasis this week is on old movies. Fortunately, they're great old 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
David Lean's monumental "Lawrence of Arabia" has previously been released on 
videocassette, but this week RCA/Columbia is making available the restored 
version that played theaters this summer. Not only has most of what was cut 
after the film's 1962 premiere been put back in, but the new video also is in 
letterbox format. And the price is nice: $29.95 for both cassettes -- all 218 
minutes of this desert-set biography starring Peter O'Toole as the troubled 
British adventurer T. E. Lawrence. MPAA Rating: PG. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life" is one of the 
best-selling video-vintage-movies ever, it's surprising to learn that two of 
his other classics, "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" (starring Gary Cooper and the 
great, now-underappreciated Jean Arthur) and "You Can't Take It With You" (also 
with Arthur, as well as James Stewart and Lionel Barrymore), are just now 
reaching the video stores. They're only $19.95 each from RCA/Columbia. The 
latter, from 1938, is a delightful screwball comedy based on the Kaufman-Hart 
play; "Deeds" (1936) is a more serious-toned satire concerning a small-town 
poet who has unorthodox plans for the $20 million he inherits. 
</P>
<P>
Several other movies from the past get their prices reduced this week to $19.95 
by MGM/UA, including "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" (the original 1958 version), 
"2001: A Space Odyssey," "The Thin Man" (as well as five sequels), "The Dirty 
Dozen" and "Carrie." 
</P>
<P>
More recent pictures new to video include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Hotel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie" (Portfolio/Virgin, 
$99.95 for two cassettes, no MPAA rating). This winner of the 1988 documentary 
Oscar is, like director Marcel Ophuls' previous "The Sorrow and the Pity," an 
intelligent, detailed and very long (267 minutes) examination of Nazi cruelty 
in WWII France, compromised morality and related issues. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "A World Apart" (Media, $89.95, PG), an uneven but interesting true-life 
drama about how South Africa's apartheid separated an imprisoned journalist 
(Barbara Hershey) from her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Dead Calm" (Warner, $89.95, R), a tense thriller about a couple who take a 
mysterious shipwreck survivor aboard their yacht. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "No Holds Barred" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, PG-13), a predictable wrestling 
flick starring champ Hulk Hogan. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Dead-Bang" (Warner, $89.95, R), a dumb, groddy cop film starring Don 
Johnson and directed by John Frankenheimer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OTHER NEW VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: "Harry Connick, Jr.: Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans" 
(VIEW, $29.95) is a 72-minute, 14-song introduction to the fast-rising singer 
and his smooth, Sinatra-esque style. "Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation" (A&amp;M, 
$24.98) is the dance-filled, four-video accompaniment to Michael's sister's 
newest (and most pretentious) album. "Yngwie Malmsteen -- Trial By Fire: Live 
in Leningrad" (PMV, $24.95) features the hard-rock guitarist in concert. 
"Luther Vandross: Live at Wembley" (CMV, $19.98) is an 11-song London show by 
the R&amp;B singer. 
</P>
<P>
SPORTS: "ESPN's Amazing Biff Bam Boom Anything Goes Sports Bloopers" ($9.95, 45 
minutes) is the for-sale version of a Sports Illustrated subscription premium. 
"Strange Reigns at Oak Hill" (True North, $29.95) offers 40 minutes of 
highlights of the 1989 U.S. Open golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
KIDS: "Ghostbusters: Spirits, Spooks and Specters," "Sherlock Hound in the Dogs 
of Bowserville" and "Clementine: A Young Girl and Her Dreams" are three 
animated titles from Just for Kids ($39.95 each). TERRY ATKINSON

BOTH 'LITTLE SHOP,' 'TIME' OFFER GOOD BITS

<P>
"Little Shop of Horrors." (Warner, Extended Play CLV, $35) and "Time After 
Time" (Warner, Extended Play CLV, $35). 
</P>
<P>
Both of these films are available on videotape and both provide good home video 
value: Parts of them are worth seeing repeatedly. But the laser video discs 
offer the kind of home viewing experience that videotape just cannot duplicate. 
Not only is the picture sharper and the digitally processed sound track 
clearer, but there's the laser's Chapter Index feature. Chapter stops are 
placed before highlights in each film, enabling the viewer to find, for 
example, favorite dramatic scenes ("Chasing Jack the Ripper through San 
Francisco" in the time-travel horror/thriller "Time After Time") or musical 
numbers (the Steve Martin-sung "Dentist!" in this 1986 version of "Little Shop 
of Horrors"). "Time After Time" offers 15 chapter stop numbers; "Little Shop of 
Horrors," 14. BARBARA SALTZMAN

What are we to make of an "American Baroque Hiboy Refrigerator"? Well, it hums 
like a fridge and it has cans of cold Coke inside. But it sits on curving metal 
legs and supports an elaborate metal scrollwork balancing a trio of American 
Indian pots. And the door is colored leaded glass, with velvet wound around the 
handle. 
</P>
<P>
The piece is one of Joel Otterson's ingenious portmanteau creations -- a little 
of this and a little of that, pieced together to reflect what he calls the 
"hybrid" character of contemporary life. What makes this refrigerator 
"American" anyway -- the Coke inside or the artifacts of Indian culture? The 
refrigerator surely has become as central a piece of furniture in the 
middle-class home as the highboy -- a tall chest of drawers mounted on legs -- 
once was. (Otterson's spelling gives it the flip, vernacular sound of mass 
marketing.) 
</P>
<P>
In "Single Cell on Wheels/Hindeloopen Piece," Otterson paints a colony of 
plump, curving PVC sewer pipes punctured by constellations of tiny holes and 
painted with small floral designs similar to Pennsylvania Dutch patterns. The 
pipes rest on an old-fashioned I-shaped steel pipe delicately balanced on small 
piano wheels. 
</P>
<P>
The piece seems to be partly about our surprisingly flexible notions of what 
can be decorative, and about the way vastly disparate objects can be read as 
organic forms of a greater or lesser order. Puns on the various definitions of 
"cell" are also at work here. 
</P>
<P>
And there's more. While he wryly observes consumer culture dancing a jig with 
art forms past and present, Otterson -- a young Los Angeles artist who lives in 
New York -- is also creating works that stand on their own as delights for the 
eye. (Margo Leavin Gallery, 812 N. Robertson Blvd., to Nov. 11.) CATHY CURTIS

In America, the '60s meant Warhol and Pop. The movement was actually pollinated 
before that by London's Beat movement in music, art and letters, and the 
photographs of Michael Cooper recorded it all. Cooper made a name shooting 
album jackets for the Rolling Stones and the Beatles. He also worked for art 
dealer Robert Fraser, whose gallery was the hub of the '60s scene in England. 
Symbol and product of those fast, fraught times, Cooper died tragically in 1973 
at age 31. 
</P>
<P>
His assistant has collected and salvaged the prints Cooper left behind to form 
a show of photos dated 1963-73, as well as a slick, salable portfolio with 
anecdotes by '60s luminaries. Perhaps because Cooper's negatives laid in disuse 
for so long, or because Cooper was still a young, evolving photographer when he 
died, many of the black-and-white works have a rough edge and don't arrest our 
attention for technical virtuosity. They grab us as gutsy, candid freeze frames 
of the pulse of an era: Bay Area poet Allen Ginsberg protests the Vietnam War; 
a youthful Dennis Hopper, isolated against black, is a sultry rebel without a 
cause; a young flaxen-haired David Hockney poses with a winsome boy. 
</P>
<P>
There are countless shots of prankster Rolling Stones in eccentric garb. A 
photo of Marcel Duchamp, aged and ever cagey, is priceless, as are warm views 
of surrealist Rene Magritte. The '60s are big business today, but in spite of 
the posthumous hype one senses Cooper's gentle creative spirit. (Earl McGrath

Morton Dimondstein paints the unbeautiful people -- ordinary folks in their 
comfortable clothes. Piecing together several sheets of paper to make an ample 
surface, he lets his easygoing brush focus on pattern, vivid color and a basic 
sense of human character. "Regina," in stinging green beads and a pink mini, 
smirks as she poses next to a battery of studio lights. "Joshua," an intense 
fellow in a striped shirt and tennis shoes, turns his back on a brightly 
dressed woman who chats with a plump nude. For some reason, the nudes in these 
paintings -- who seem to be studio models -- are only ciphers, bulky figures 
with no discernable personality. 
</P>
<P>
The most that can be said for Dimondstein's painting style is that it does the 
job in a workmanlike and self-effacing way. His strength lies in the warmly 
human but unprettifying eye -- verging slightly on caricature -- with which he 
views most of his subjects. "Chris and Dorothy" in particular -- two lumpy 
middle-aged people in drab dress -- radiate a simple content with their lot in 
life. Dimondstein's abstract "Torso" sculptures share that unpretentious 
quality. The hollows and planes have an honest, handcrafted look, complete with 
cracks and blemishes, and the grain of the wood is carefully used to full 
effect. (Ana Izax Gallerie, 421 N. Rodeo Drive, to Nov. 4.) CATHY CURTIS

CARSON SETS RELOCATION AID FOR TRAILER PARK RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Carson City Council has unanimously adopted a resolution that specifies the 
amount of relocation assistance for residents of Citation Mobile Home Park, 
whose owner plans to close the park this year to build single-family houses. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution ends a 10-month dispute between the trailer owners and park 
owner James W. Robel about what would be fair compensation for residents who 
own their trailers and are forced to leave the park. City ordinance requires 
park owners to compensate displaced owner-residents before a park can be closed 
but does not specify what the payment should be. The resolution also specifies 
the amount of compensation for residents of mobile homes if they cannot 
relocate to a park within 50 miles. 
</P>
<P>
According to the resolution, recreational vehicle owners will receive $2,000 
and owners of single-wide mobile homes will receive $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to lump sum payments to cover moving expenses, an additional $1,000 
will go to residents over age 62 who fall within federal low- and 
moderate-income guidelines and residents certified as handicapped or disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Robel, asked if he was satisfied with the resolution, said: "It will close the 
park." 
</P>
<P>
Residents attending the council meeting said they were unhappy with the 
resolution, which they feel does not provide enough money for moving costs or 
adequate payment to those mobile home owners who cannot find parks to move to. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution provides no payments to renters of mobile homes at the park, or 
to mobile home owners who do not live at the park. Mobile homes are the larger 
units in the park, while recreational vehicles are more easily moved. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the only double-wide home in the park, Carol Stefan, will be paid 
a maximum of $6,200 to move her home. 
</P>
<P>
Stefan said that may not be enough to cover the cost of moving the two-bedroom, 
two-bathroom home and doubted if she would be able to find a park that would 
accept her mobile home. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of parks don't want a large coach . . . and I want to be in a safe area, 
close to where I work," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution requires residents to leave the park at East 220th Street within 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
If a resident cannot find a park within 50 miles into which they can move a 
mobile home, Robel must pay the difference between its on-site value and 
off-site value. In that case, residents must pay for moving costs. The on-site 
and off-site values of the 14 homes in the park are listed in the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
The on-site values of the mobile homes range from $5,000 to $43,800, according 
to the resolution. Their off-site values range from $1,500 to $27,600. 
</P>
<P>
If the residents must sell their homes, the resolution requires Robel to 
reserve apartments for them in apartment buildings he owns in Carson and 
Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Marino, 71, has lived at Citation for five years and was glad to hear 
that older people will receive additional money, but said he did not want to 
move. 
</P>
<P>
"Just when you think you're set . . . somebody comes along that doesn't have 
any care for your position," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my dining room and my bedroom," he said pointing to a small table and 
the pillow on top of it. He sleeps at the table because his legs become numb if 
he lays down, he said. 
</P>
<P>
There are 29 mobile home parks in Carson, two of them have closure applications 
before the Planning Commission.

SHATTERED DREAM; 
</P>
<P>
YOUNGEST BOY OF FAMILY FROM NEPAL SHOT TO DEATH IN INGLEWOOD ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
Matshyendra and Mathura Singh led a life of comfort and some position in their 
native Nepal. Surrounded by family and friends, the couple lived on the pension 
earned by Matshyendra after 28 years as an accountant for the U.S. Agency for 
International Development. 
</P>
<P>
The Singhs said they never would have considered leaving their home in the 
capital city of Katmandu, in the shadow of the Himalayas, were it not for their 
son Majendra. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager, the youngest of three children, was bright and outgoing. His 
parents wanted him to have an American college education so he could pursue his 
dream of becoming an architect or engineer. So, 21 months ago, the family moved 
halfway around the world to settle near relatives in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
Matshyendra remembers that decision with sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'I will see him established here, then I will go home,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
But last week the aspirations of a family and much of the tightknit Nepalese 
community in Los Angeles were shattered when Majendra Singh -- son of Nepal and 
child of the American Dream -- was shot to death in his new hometown. 
</P>
<P>
Majendra, 19, was counting the night's receipts at the Pizza Hut on Manchester 
Avenue when he was confronted by two men. They shot him and took the money. 
</P>
<P>
Majendra will be cremated Saturday in the Hindu tradition, his father said, 
freeing the young man's soul to ascend to heaven. The weight of the tragedy 
remains with the living. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, in the middle of a 10-day mourning period, the father sat cross-legged 
on the floor of the family's modest apartment, his voice barely audible above 
the roar of jets from nearby Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Matshyendra, 50, said he had planned to remain here until his children were 
established. 
</P>
<P>
"Now my son is gone forever and I feel my purpose is completely lost." 
</P>
<P>
The grief is shared by Southern California's Nepalese community. The 300-member 
American Nepal Society was to meet in two weeks to celebrate Dashin, the 
festival that is the holiest event on the Hindu calendar. Instead, the 
gathering will be used to remember and pray for Majendra, said Naren Suwal, a 
member of the society and relative of the Singh family. 
</P>
<P>
The Singhs have rejected the help of grief counselors and victim assistance 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a different way," said Suwal, who calls Matshyendra a "brother-cousin" 
-- their grandfathers were brothers. 
</P>
<P>
A stream of friends and relatives came to the family's home on Crenshaw 
Boulevard throughout the week, bringing food and prayers. And the American 
Nepal Society has established a memorial fund. 
</P>
<P>
Majendra will be cremated Saturday at Forest Lawn Mortuary in Pomona, along 
with his jata, the astrological chart that is drawn at birth for Hindus. 
</P>
<P>
On Majendra's last birthday in Katmandu, his mother had gone to an astrologer 
with her son's jata. "The woman said 'The stars are not very cooperative,' " 
his father recalled, "but she said 'There is nothing major to fear.' " 
</P>
<P>
From the time the family arrived in Inglewood, however, their stars seemed to 
be crossed. They came to Inglewood to live near Suwal, who had a budding career 
in hotel management after immigrating several years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Matshyendra's $200 monthly pension had supported the family in Nepal, one of 
the world's poorest nations, but it was paltry by American standards. Half of 
the $3,500 he brought from his homeland had to be spent for a deposit on an 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Matshyendra wanted to start working immediately, so he could send his son to 
college. But for months he could not find a job. Employers told him alternately 
that he did not know computers, or that he was overqualified. 
</P>
<P>
Majendra and his sister Sunayana, now 21, were forced to find jobs to support 
the family. Their educations would have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
Sunayana worked part time at McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
Their mother, who speaks little English, cared for the children of other 
Nepalese families. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks after they arrived in January, 1988, Majendra was working at Pizza 
Hut about a mile north of his home. He earned minimum wage, but he could work 
long hours and he was promoted quickly from dishwasher to cook, to night crew 
chief. His pay went up to $5 an hour, and he often worked 60 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to ask him, 'Are you tired, Majendra? Are you tired?' "recalled Juana 
Flores, the youth's co-worker and friend. "And he said, 'No, you can't get 
tired in this kind of job.' " 
</P>
<P>
Friends explained that for Hindus, work is a form of worship. 
</P>
<P>
His father waited up late every night until his son came home. He counseled 
Majendra to work fewer hours and to start classes at a community college. But 
Majendra demurred, saying that his family came before his education. 
</P>
<P>
Majendra tried to talk his father out of taking a job as a stock clerk at a 
Torrance liquor store, saying it was too demeaning for a professional man. But 
Matshyendra took the job anyway and, because of the extra income, his son felt 
free this fall to enroll at El Camino College in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
There, he took two courses to get acclimated. Next semester, he hoped to enroll 
full time. 
</P>
<P>
"He always wanted to become somebody," Suwal said. 
</P>
<P>
Majendra continued to work long hours. A recent pay stub showed that he logged 
112 hours in two weeks. Often, he closed the pizza parlor and counted the 
receipts. 
</P>
<P>
Suwal, 34, who had been robbed while managing a hotel in Covina, told Majendra 
that if bandits ever came, he should give up the money. 
</P>
<P>
After another long Friday night, Majendra closed the restaurant at 1 a.m. last 
Saturday morning. It was just before 2 a.m. that two young robbers confronted 
him. 
</P>
<P>
None of the three other employees who were cleaning up that night know how the 
thieves got into the restaurant, police said. Majendra did not resist them, but 
was shot dead, a woman who worked behind the counter told police. 
</P>
<P>
Matshyendra Singh can almost understand the robbery, but not why his son had to 
die. 
</P>
<P>
The father said he expects to return to Katmandu with his wife. He will let his 
daughter and eldest son -- who arrived Thursday for the funeral -- stay if they 
want to. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no reason for him to remain, Matshyendra said. 
</P>
<P>
"As a man, I did this for my children. I didn't come here for any other 
purpose."

FROM DOGS TO DRILLING -- IT'S ALL DEBATABLE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: IN TWO FORUMS, CONTENDERS FOR CITY COUNCIL IN THE HERMOSA BEACH RACE 
TAKE THE STAND TO DECLARE HOW THEY STAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
Two Hermosa Beach organizations, the Chamber of Commerce and the grass-roots 
Watchdog political group, sponsored back-to-back debates for council candidates 
this week, with the two incumbents and five challengers discussing issues 
ranging from unleashed dogs to downzoning to oil drilling. 
</P>
<P>
The first debate, on Wednesday, was sponsored by Watchdog, a group formed 
earlier this year after the City Council announced that the leash law would be 
enforced along the Santa Fe Railroad right of way once the city acquires 
ownership. More than 80 residents attended that forum. 
</P>
<P>
The Chamber of Commerce and the League of Women Voters sponsored the second 
debate Thursday, drawing a crowd of about 80. 
</P>
<P>
Despite rumors circulating before the debates that one of them may have been 
scheduled to upstage the other, both came off smoothly. Representatives of both 
groups said the timing appeared to be unintentional. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Anne Boyle, secretary of Watchdog, said the group reserved the Clark 
Stadium community building for mid-October with the understanding that a 
chamber debate would not be held until the end of the month. The timing of the 
debates "should not be construed as any sort of competition," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wes Bush, executive vice president of the chamber, said that although the 
chamber set up its debate first, he did not think Watchdog intended to cause 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the five council seats are up for grabs. Two incumbents, Mayor June 
Williams and Councilwoman Etta Simpson, are running for second terms. 
Councilman Jim Rosenberger is not running for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
The five challengers are Les Barry, Robert Benz, Robert Essertier, Kathleen 
Midstokke, and Albert G. Wiemans. 
</P>
<P>
Voters also face competing ballot measures on two issues -- the fate of the 
Biltmore hotel site and whether dogs should be allowed off their leashes on the 
Santa Fe Railroad right of way. 
</P>
<P>
The dog issue is represented on the ballot by a Watchdog-sponsored initiative 
to allow dogs to be off their leashes and by a city-sponsored proposal to 
require them to be leashed. 
</P>
<P>
After the Watchdog proposal qualified for the ballot, the City Council voted 3 
to 2 in June to add its own ballot measure, which would designate the 20-acre 
strip a parkland and would specifically ban unleashed dogs. 
</P>
<P>
During the forums, however, some candidates said the dog issue is not as 
crucial as others facing the city, including housing density, a parking 
shortage, the aging sewer system and measures to improve the downtown business 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who voted in June to ban unleashed dogs from the right of way, voiced 
reservations Wednesday about attending a politically sponsored forum, saying in 
her introductory remarks that her presence "does not mean I support the views 
of the political group sponsoring this forum." 
</P>
<P>
In both debates, candidates gave brief introductory descriptions of their 
backgrounds and discussed their positions on the issues. The introductory 
session was followed by written questions from the audience, read by moderator 
Lance Whitman. Candidates also fielded questions from a panel of reporters at 
Thursday's debate. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some views expressed by the candidates: 
</P>
<P>
*Barry, 66, a free-lance journalist and a vocal opponent of oil drilling in the 
city, argued that it would be detrimental to the environment and said the city 
would be restricted in how it could spend oil revenues because the site is on 
tidelands property. He said some residents voted for oil drilling in 1984 in 
the erroneous belief that if they did not, the city would not have enough money 
to buy the right of way and condominiums would be built on the property. Barry 
also criticized the city for signing a lease with MacPherson Oil before seeing 
an environmental impact report. On the Biltmore issue, Barry suggested the city 
consider alternative uses for the site, including building a surfing hall of 
fame there. 
</P>
<P>
*Benz, 30, an engineer and the host of a local cable television show, described 
himself as a pro-oil candidate whose engineering background would be useful in 
mitigating the impact of oil drilling in the city. Benz said the city should 
encourage businesses to remain in the city, to maintain sales tax revenues and 
offset an estimated $20 million cost of repairing the city's sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
* Essertier, 40, a computer software entrepreneur who has lived in Hermosa 
Beach for 15 years, said he favors oil drilling, despite personal reservations, 
because the city can use oil revenues for needed city services and repair of 
the infrastructure. Essertier said the dog-leash measure is not an issue 
because it is on the ballot and will be decided by the voters. 
</P>
<P>
* Midstokke, 39, was elected Hermosa Beach city clerk in 1984. Midstokke said 
she would work toward the city's acquiring excess school property for open 
space and to put a measure on the ballot defining how open space can be used. 
Midstokke called city fiscal policies lax. She cited a cost overrun of $145,000 
for an environmental impact report on the right of way that she said should 
have been paid for by the developer, and the loss of $10,000 in improperly 
charged movie permit fees over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
* Wiemans, 48, an attorney, criticized the present council as unresponsive to 
residents. He advocated overhauling the entire City Council and reducing the 
size of some city departments. Wiemans opposes the council's decisions to lower 
densities throughout the city, arguing that because downzoning makes some 
properties legally nonconforming, it limits property owners' rights and 
decreases property values. Though he is personally opposed to oil drilling, 
Wiemans said, he would support it because the voters approved it in a 1984 
election. 
</P>
<P>
* Councilwoman Simpson, 67, describing herself as an analytical council member 
who has taken strong stands to decrease density, said she is concerned about 
the environmental impact of oil drilling in the city. Simpson said she has 
saved the city $21,500 in salary and insurance costs during her tenure by 
serving for a salary of $1 a year. 
</P>
<P>
* Mayor Williams, 61, said that in a second term, she would continue her 
efforts to decrease density and congestion. Williams said that when she took 
office four years ago, city budget projections were bleak. A balanced budget 
was projected this year, she said, but the city needs to increase revenue to 
keep up with inflation. She also said the city needs to begin environmental 
reviews of large developments. 
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's forum, representatives of the four ballot measures -- two on 
each issue -- also addressed the crowd of about 100. 
</P>
<P>
Community activist Parker Herriott, who spearheaded a ballot initiative to 
convert the Biltmore site into a park, urged voters to support that initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Chuck Sheldon spoke in favor of both city-sponsored measures. 
</P>
<P>
He called the measure to approve use of the Biltmore site as a mix of 
commercial, residential and open space "an excellent compromise ballot 
measure." 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon also said that dogs need to be leashed, citing a recent incident in 
which he said a 10-year-old Hermosa Valley School student was attacked but not 
seriously hurt by a leashed pit bull on the right of way.

ARTS: ORGANIZATIONS ARE ASSESSING QUAKE DAMAGE TO THEIR BUILDINGS AND 
COLLECTIONS, WITH A SPECIAL CONCERN FOR THE FORT MASON COMPLEX, WHERE MANY 
WORKS ARE FEARED LOST.

<P>
Many Bay Area arts organizations have closed their doors or canceled rehearsals 
and performances this week, struggling to determine everything from the extent 
of damage to buildings and collections to how badly their vital computerized 
fund-raising databases have been affected. 
</P>
<P>
While some museums suffered costly losses of artworks and significant damage to 
buildings, first- and second-day reports indicate that institutions whose 
telephones were working escaped with surprisingly few problems. Many 
organizations still could not be reached on Thursday, however, and the silence 
suggests that more serious damage reports may emerge in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
There was serious concern Thursday for the fate of collections and arts 
buildings in the Fort Mason Center complex near the devastated Marina District. 
Fort Mason, a former Army base, is the home of the Mexican Museum, the Museo 
Italoamericano, the San Francisco Craft &amp; Folk Art Museum and the Magic 
Theater. 
</P>
<P>
The entire complex remained sealed off even to museum staff members and 
officials Thursday morning as structural engineers struggled to assess 
apparently heavy damage. However, Marie Acosta-Colon, director of the Mexican 
Museum, said there were fears that damage to art objects was enormous. 
</P>
<P>
She said museum workers observed a number of Colonial saint figures and pieces 
of furniture crash to the floor in the seconds following the first tremor, 
immediately before Fort Mason was completely evacuated. Acosta-Colon said an 
asbestos-covered pipe apparently broke loose in the shock and asbestos fibers 
may have sprayed over large parts of the collection. 
</P>
<P>
Acosta-Colon said a 300-piece collection of ceramic pieces from the estate of 
Nelson Rockefeller was also feared to have sustained massive damage. She said 
the museum's insurance coverage apparently is far below the potential cost of 
the damage and that she was concerned the Fort Mason buildings may be 
condemned. The Mexican Museum has the largest collection of Mexican and 
Mexican-American art objects in the country -- 7,000 pieces in all. 
</P>
<P>
"We could not assess the damage because the staff was ordered to leave 
immediately and there was a major gas leak," she said in a telephone interview. 
"I can only imagine the worst." 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, Juan Carrillo, deputy director for programs of the California 
Arts Council, said the organization has notified the National Endowment for the 
Arts that it will seek an emergency disaster relief grant for arts 
organizations of between $100,000 and $200,000. Carrillo said it would take 
about two weeks for arts officials to get a detailed picture of the extent to 
which arts groups require special assistance. 
</P>
<P>
At the Asian Art Museum in Golden Gate Park, about 100 stone sculptures and 
porcelain objects -- less than 1% -- of the collection of 12,000 pieces were 
broken, according to a preliminary survey, said Lilia Villanueva, head of 
public relations. The museum has not estimated the value of the loss, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Miraculously, no glass objects were broken. That speaks well of the way the 
pieces were installed and secured in displays and storage," Villanueva said. 
About 80% of the museum's vast collection is in storage. 
</P>
<P>
The building sustained cracks in basement offices and in floors on the main and 
second levels, she said. Building inspectors were assessing damage and checking 
for asbestos leaks on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland Museum sustained serious losses of artworks, including several 
glass and ceramics pieces in the museum's crafts collections and various 
objects in a display of art and artifacts on California history. Two 
contemporary sculptures, by David Bottini and Robert Hudson, also were 
overturned and a 6-foot jade pagoda lay on its side, broken in several pieces. 
The contemporary metal sculptures and the jade pagoda can be repaired, said 
associate director Phil Mumma, but "at what cost I don't know." He said it was 
too soon to put a dollar value on the museum's total losses. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point we're going through the galleries where there was damage and 
picking up all the infinitesimal pieces to see what we can conserve. It's sort 
of like archeology," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the strength of the shake, which was amazing, and our proximity to the 
freeway that collapsed, I expected the damage to be much worse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary engineer's survey indicated that the sturdy modern museum 
building had survived intact, but the building has been closed for an 
indefinite period pending an inspection by city building inspectors, he said. 
The closure necessitated cancellation of a multidisciplinary symposium, "20/20: 
Focus on California Past and Future," scheduled this weekend at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Among other visual art institutions, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art 
lost only one artwork, a Peter Voulkos ceramic sculpture, according to 
Millicent Gaudieri, executive director of the New York-based Assn. of Art 
Museum Directors. There was "significant cosmetic damage" to the building but 
possible structural damage had yet to be determined, she said. 
</P>
<P>
An employee added that skylights had fallen, the walls had cracked and several 
sculptures had toppled. Staff members who could easily reach the museum were 
reportedly at work on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco reported no serious damage to artworks 
or buildings, according to press officer Linda Jablon. She said some sculptures 
had toppled over but no works were known to be destroyed. The situation looked 
so hopeful that the M.H. de Young Museum may be able to reopen on Saturday, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to reach the Friends of Photography's new Ansel Adams Center south of 
Market Street also were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
In the East Bay, the University Art Museum at UC Berkeley escaped unscathed, 
according to director Jacqueline Bass. 
</P>
<P>
The San Jose Museum of Art, housed in a historic 1890s structure, suffered only 
"minor apparent damage" -- cracks in walls and some fallen plaster, director I. 
Michael Danoff said. The staff was installing a new exhibition when the quake 
hit, so very little art was on display and none was damaged, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Richmond Art Center was closed on Wednesday because the area was being 
inspected for gas leaks, but it was engaged in "business as usual" on Thursday, 
curator Michael Schwager said. "We watched pictures fly off the wall" and swept 
a layer of broken glass when the quake ended, he said, but only the glass 
covering the artworks was broken. All the artworks and expensive Macintosh and 
Sony computers in the center's current "Art and Technology" show survived 
intact, as did the building, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary reports suggest that damage to performing arts institutions may be 
extensive. Margaret Jenkins, artistic director of San Francisco's Margaret 
Jenkins Dance Company, said she was conducting a rehearsal when the earthquake 
struck. "We felt it the way you often do when an earthquake first starts, but 
then it became clear what was going on," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins said virtually all performing arts organizations in the city were 
officially closed, with most hurriedly seeking evaluations of rehearsal and 
performance spaces by structural engineers. Jenkins said arts organizations 
were heeding requests by city officials that they cancel rehearsals and 
performances for the rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
Louise Strasbaugh, who took over as executive director of the Chamber Symphony 
of San Francisco just one day before the earthquake, said she and many other 
arts organization officials had serious concerns about the damage inflicted by 
the prolonged power failure to computer systems containing ticket reservation, 
subscriber information and fund-raising databases. 
</P>
<P>
While most arts groups shuttered their offices Wednesday morning, Strasbaugh 
said she found power still out at her apartment and decided to prepare and cook 
all of the food in her freezer, walk over to work and serve it to whoever she 
found at the office. "We're just sitting around eating," she said, awaiting 
results of a structural inspection of the building. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra, which does not open its season until November, will not be 
forced to alter its performance schedule she said. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco Ballet, which occupies a comparatively new building, 
sustained only minor damage, but its offices were officially closed. A 
spokesman said no performances would be immediately affected because the 
company is performing in Orange County this week. 
</P>
<P>
Bay Area theaters appear to have fared well. In general, the show will go on. 
</P>
<P>
El Teatro Campesino, located just a few miles from the San Andreas fault in San 
Juan Bautista, suffered virtually no damage and will present two new one-acts 
this weekend -- Josefina Lopez's "Simply Maria" and "Food for the Dead." 
</P>
<P>
The city's theater district near Union Square was virtually shut down. San 
Francisco's flagship theater, the American Conservatory Theatre, expects to 
resume performances of "Right Mind" at the Geary Theatre on Monday. The Geary, 
built about 1910, sustained no visible damage, but weekend performances were 
suspended pending a check of the structure. 
</P>
<P>
"Durante," at the Golden Gate Theatre, has been temporarily suspended until the 
theater can be certified as safe. Four performances were canceled, and a 
spokesman said he did not know when the theater would reopen. 
</P>
<P>
"Les Miserables" at the Curran Theatre postponed its first preview from tonight 
to Saturday. The company was rehearsing in the theater when the quake struck. 
No damage or injuries were reported, but the theater had to be checked, and 
power wasn't restored until Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The Berkeley Repertory Theatre came through unscathed. It's rehearsing 
"Reckless" for a Wednesday opening. The Theatre Artaud had no problems, either. 
The Dell' Arte Players continue there with "Slapstick." 
</P>
<P>
As reports of damage to arts organizations trickled in, state arts officials 
largely remained in the dark about their member organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Reid, director of the California Arts Council, Reid said he believed the 
effect of the quake, especially on small arts organizations -- including 
galleries, small performing arts companies and similar groups -- would be 
tremendous. "I would imagine the impact on those arts organizations simply is 
going to be that they are crippled," Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Carrillo, the arts council's deputy director of programs, said, "I'm 
having zero luck" learning the fate of specific arts groups. Carrillo said 
state officials were particularly concerned at damage to off-exhibit museum 
collections in storage areas where large volumes of pottery and other breakable 
materials might have been displaced by the force of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
East Coast offices of national arts organizations were similarly unable to 
account for earthquake losses at Bay Area institutions. In Washington, the 
National Endowment for the Arts said its state arts program office had 
attempted to contact Bay Area arts organizations, without success. An endowment 
spokesman said there had been unconfirmed reports -- apparently originating 
from news media -- of some damage to the San Francisco Opera House. The opera 
offices were apparently closed Wednesday and Thursday, as were offices of the 
San Francisco Symphony and San Francisco Performances. 
</P>
<P>
The American Assn. of Museums in Washington said a staff member had been 
assigned to try to determine the extent of damage to Bay Area museums but that 
the organization had been unable to obtain any information because of telephone 
problems.

SAN DIEGO ARTS FESTIVAL: TREASURES OF THE SOVIET UNION; 
</P>
<P>
SUPER POWERS SUNDAY WILL LAUNCH SOVIET ARTS FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's been almost two years since Mayor Maureen O'Connor unveiled her complex 
and often controversial plans to mount the "San Diego Arts Festival: Treasures 
of the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, she's celebrating their fruition with a party in Balboa Park, and 
she's hoping for 50,000 friends to help her kick off the three-week Soviet 
festival at Super Powers Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Starting at 9 a.m., visitors to the park can, at no charge, see many of the 
performers scheduled to appear throughout the festival. These include the 
Georgian State Singing and Dancing Ensemble, whose performances have been sold 
out for several weeks, and the Tbilisi State Marionette Theatre, a band of tiny 
puppets, also a sellout. 
</P>
<P>
And, although they can't be seen free, the touted Imperial Faberge eggs will be 
on display for the first time at the Museum of Art. Tickets for Sunday's 
viewing of the 27 jeweled eggs are still available only at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor even managed to land an appearance from Mickey Mouse, who will lead 
the opening ceremony procession at noon with Frish, the Russian clown, and 
Ronald McDonald. Strolling entertainers will roam the park, fest-goers can 
sample Georgian cuisine and Malcolm Forbes has lent his egg-shaped hot air 
balloon to the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
It's been 54 years since Balboa Park has seen a celebration the size planned 
for Sunday. A total of 59,987 showed up when the California Pacific 
International Exposition opened on May 29, 1935. 
</P>
<P>
And, on New Year's Eve 1914, about 31,800 revelers helped kick off the 
Panama-California Exposition, for which Balboa Park was originally built. 
</P>
<P>
Festival organizers spent $50,000 of the Soviet festival's $6-million budget on 
Super Powers Sunday, said coordinator Peg Nugent, mostly to purchase shuttle 
transportation for visitors who must park downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Super Powers Sunday runs from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Most Soviet performers will 
appear between noon and 5. Here are some highlights: 
</P>
<P>
Georgian Folk Dancers -- This may be the only opportunity many San Diegans have 
to see these leaping, saber-flashing dancers. Tickets to scheduled performances 
during the rest of the festival have been sold out for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, fest-goers can see the 65-member dance troupe free. The adult and 
child dancers will give separate performances. The first show is scheduled for 
12:25 p.m., immediately following opening ceremonies in the Spreckels Organ 
Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Prodigies -- Airapetianz Ripsime, 14, and Yekaterina Mechetina, 11, are 
recognized as two of the Soviet Union's most promising young musical talents. A 
violinist, Ripsime is a ninth-grade student in a Moscow music school where she 
has developed a diverse concert repertoire that includes selections by 
Mendelssohn, Mozart and Tchaikovsky. 
</P>
<P>
(Katia) Mechetina, a fifth-grade student, studies piano at the same music 
school in Moscow. She began piano lessons at age 4, gave her first concert by 
age 5, and has played publicly since she was 8. 
</P>
<P>
The girls will perform separately and as a duet Sunday at the Casa del Prado 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Marionettes -- Sunday marks the first U.S. performance of Georgian Rezo 
Gabriadze's Tbilisi State Puppet Theatre. Gabriadze's popularity in his 
homeland stems from his ability to write shows that both entertain children and 
challenge adults. His stories and scenarios revolve around life, work and 
family themes, and have been made into 30 feature films. 
</P>
<P>
Marie Hitchcock Puppets -- Local puppeteer Marie Hitchcock, 78, has been 
entertaining San Diegans for 41 of her 78 years. Her show honoring the Soviet 
Festival features a meeting between four Faberge eggs and Humpty Dumpty. 
</P>
<P>
Opera Talents -- American cast members from the Russian opera, Mussorgsky's 
"Boris Godunov," will sing a variety of popular arias and light opera during a 
40-minute show on the Old Globe Theatre outdoor stage. Scheduled performers 
include Stephen West, Martha Jane Howe, Robert Galbraith, Bernard Fitch and 
Patricia Minton-Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers had originally scheduled Soviet opera performers to entertain as 
well. But San Diego Opera officials vetoed that plan, maintaining that the 
Russian singers would be too busy preparing for performances of "Boris." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet, Mexican and American muralists -- Artist Nikolai Ignatov of Georgia has 
been in San Diego since early October working on a mural commemorating the 
"Treasures of the Soviet Union" festival, in conjunction with muralists from 
the Centro Cultural de la Raza in Balboa Park. The trio of international 
artists will continue their work Sunday at the Centro. 
</P>
<P>
Georgian Chefs -- Six master chefs spent days working with cooks from the U.S. 
Navy to prepare a feast of Georgian cuisine, including shashlik (grilled lamb 
on a skewer), basturma (marinated filet of beef cooked over an open flame), and 
lobio (a bean-and-herb spread). Of course, a sturgeon dish is also on the menu, 
as well as pomegranate ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors can sample those dishes for $2 a taste. 
</P>
<P>
For those whose tastes are slightly less adventurous, American favorites like 
hot dogs, popcorn and ice cream will be available. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Faberge Eggs and other exhibits -- Sunday marks the opening of the 
Faberge Egg exhibit at the Museum of Art, and tickets for Sunday's viewing are 
still available. Adult admission is $5, which includes free admission for one 
child under 12 years and $2 for each additional child. 
</P>
<P>
Faberge eggs are hand-crafted, decorative artworks made primarily from gold and 
silver. They are encrusted with precious stones such as rubies, diamonds and 
pearls. The eggs were created by master jeweler Peter Carl Faberge for the 
Romanov Czars Alexander III and Nicholas II between 1885 and 1917. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 27 eggs will be shown -- believed to be the largest collection since 
1917. 
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with the showing of the celebrated eggs, a special exhibition of 
Faberge gem and mineral carvings will be displayed at the Natural History 
Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet jewelry in gold, silver and cloisonne enamel can be seen at the B Street 
Pier Exhibit Hall as part of the "Masterworks in Metal," display. And an 
exhibit of Russian lacquer miniatures is being presented by the Museum of Man. 
</P>
<P>
The Reuben H. Fleet Space Theater and the San Diego Historical Society are 
sponsoring a display of Soviet and American space art at the Museum of San 
Diego History, which also is hosting an exhibit of Soviet and American 
children's art. 
</P>
<P>
And photographs of daily life in the Soviet Union are on display at the Museum 
of Photographic Arts in "An Insight into Contemporary Soviet Photography: 
1968-88." 
</P>
<P>
Admission will be charged Sunday for all museum exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes Hot Air Egg Balloon -- International financier Malcolm Forbes owns this 
egg-shaped balloon, crafted to honor the nine Faberge eggs he has collected. 
The balloon's design matches Forbes' rosebud egg, one of 27 Imperial jeweled 
eggs on display through January at the Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
Street Entertainers -- Performers from Sea World and Seaport Village, local 
bands including the Mar Dels, and children's choruses from around the county 
will entertain at sites throughout the park. 
</P>
<P>
Parking -- Festival organizers are encouraging people to avoid traffic Sunday 
by arriving well before the noon opening ceremonies begin. Many of the park's 
interior parking lots will be closed to the public on Super Powers Sunday, but 
free shuttles will be provided from several parking lots downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Free parking will be available at the county Administration Building on Pacific 
Coast Highway, the San Diego City College parking lot at Pershing Drive and B 
Street, Morley Field off Pershing Drive and the Metropolitan Transit Board 
parking lot at 12th and Imperial avenues. 
</P>
<P>
Buses will pick up passengers from these lots and drop them off on Park 
Boulevard in front of the Reuben H. Fleet Space Theater. One bus will carry 
early-bird passengers from Morley Field at 7:30 a.m. Other buses will start 
running at 9 a.m., unless demand warrants an earlier start. Buses will run 
until 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
For fest-goers riding the trolley, shuttles will pick them up at the trolley 
stop at 12th Avenue and B Street near City College. 
</P>
<P>
Maps and programs -- Brochures, maps and a schedule of events will be given to 
everyone riding the shuttle buses. Others can get them in the park at any of 10 
information booths. For those who still can't find their way, 500 volunteers 
will be on hand to offer directions. 
</P>
<P>

LA JOLLA PLAYHOUSE PLAYS BEAT THE FUND-RAISING CLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Will the La Jolla Playhouse win its race against the clock? In a campaign of 
just over five weeks, the theater has raised 24% of its $1-million goal and 
nearly half of the $500,000 it needs to raise before Dec. 31 to ensure a 1990 
season, a Playhouse official said this week. Gifts and pledges totaling 
$240,986 have come in from a variety of donors who decline to be identified, 
the spokeswoman said. Monthly progress reports are scheduled to come throughout 
the campaign, which is supposed to end June 30. 
</P>
<P>
The theater has an accumulated deficit of $703,000, which has grown annually 
since the theater, revived in 1983, went through $1 million in seed money in 
1986. Alan Levey, managing director of the theater, said this may be the first 
season in which the annual budget will be in the black. 
</P>
<P>
He said key problems have been the length of the Playhouse season -- shorter 
than any other League of Resident Theatres (LORT)) in the Playhouse's category. 
The Playhouse shares venues with UC San Diego and offers limited seating at the 
Warren Theatre. Playhouse executives say plans to build the Weiss Forum in 1991 
should alleviate the problem by adding 150 seats to the Warren. The theater 
hopes to build a third theater to allow for year-round operation. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem is that the theater has fallen short of its own projections for 
donations and single-ticket sales. Charmaine Kaplan, a member of the Playhouse 
board, will seek donations as head of the financial stabilization campaign. 
Meanwhile, Playhouse executives say they're encouraged by brisk ticket sales 
for its current production, "Macbeth," at the Mandell Weiss. Only advance 
ticket sales for the Playhouse's "80 Days" have been greater. 
</P>
<P>
The theater sold standing-room-only spots during "Macbeth" previews and was 
filled almost to capacity Tuesday. But 100 tickets still remained Wednesday for 
the Pay What You Can matinee performance on Saturday, which costs only what 
individual theatergoers can afford to pay. 
</P>
<P>
In its attempt to reach a wider audience, the theater has scheduled: an 
interpreted performance for the hearing-impaired Sunday that includes a 
pre-performance discussion on the theater deck led by deaf actress Freda 
Norman, and a limited number of $8 tickets for the hearing-impaired; $5 tickets 
for an Oct. 25 matinee at 1 p.m. for student groups; and student rush tickets 
for all performances, in which anyone with student identification can buy two 
half-price tickets a half hour before curtain time. 
</P>
<P>
Come November, it will have been a year since the staging of "The Life of the 
Party," the last production by Diversionary Theatre, San Diego's only gay and 
lesbian theater company. In the interim, the theater's board of directors 
parted company with artistic director and founder Thomas Vegh, now directing 
"The Deadly Game," opening tonight at the La Jolla Stage Company. 
</P>
<P>
The California Arts Council expressed confidence that the company would resume 
production in the form of a $1,100 grant. And the theater is likely to resume 
next year -- possibly as early as February -- with a three-play season, said 
Larry Oviatt, chairman of the board of trustees. Oviatt said a new artistic 
director will be announced soon and that the only real production holdup is the 
search for space. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Oviatt had his mind less on Diversionary than on the earthquake 
that devastated the San Francisco Bay Area the day before. Steve Rosen, future 
son-in-law of a friend of Oviatt's, wasn't home when his apartment building, 
which was sitting on a landfill, collapsed. The fourth floor is now the first 
floor and Rosen's apartment, which was on the first floor, is now nestled 
beneath the earth. Rosen, son of San Francisco Giants president Al Rosen, was 
at the World Series game in Candlestick Park when the earthquake hit, so Oviatt 
judges that this is one case in which being a fan actually spared someone's 
life. 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAM NOTES: Danny Simon liked the North Coast Repertory Theatre production 
of his brother Neil Simon's "Broadway Bound" so much that he called his 
brother's agent to say that if a touring company of the show ever gets off the 
ground, they ought to consider the North Coast lead -- 19-year-old Paul Epstein 
-- for the part of Eugene. Audiences like the show, too. It has played to 86% 
capacity in the three-week run to date, 95% last weekend alone, and has been an 
unprecedented success for the theater, said artistic director Olive Blakistone, 
who just extended the show through Nov. 25. The only North Coast show that has 
come was "The Musical Comedy Murders of 1940" at 75%. "I hope it will be as 
successful for the Gaslamp," said Blakistone of the theater that plans to 
present the San Diego professional premiere of "Broadway Bound" from Feb. 
21-April 1. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Gaslamp Quarter Theatre can't seem to get a break. First, North Coast did 
"Broadway Bound" before the Gaslamp's scheduled date for the professional 
premiere of the show. Now, another Gaslamp season selection, "Party of One," 
scheduled for March 14-May 5 at the newly named Elizabeth North Theatre, will 
play first at the Price Center Theatre at UC San Diego on Jan. 6. Ah, well, at 
least both shows have staying power. "Party of One," a musical revue about 
being single, played for four years in San Francisco before closing and leaving 
for a national tour with the original cast. The January date marks the show's 
first San Diego stop. . . .

Theater directors are counting on ticket demand for the Soviet arts festival 
theater events to climb as they inch closer to opening night -- Sunday for San 
Diego Repertory Theatre's "Slingshot" and Tuesday for Old Globe Theatre's 
"Brothers and Sisters." So far, the Globe is sold to less than half capacity 
for the American premiere of an epic theater production by the renowned Maly 
Theatre (which has sold out in every other city where its shows have appeared). 
The San Diego Repertory Theatre stands at 53% capacity for its world premiere 
directed in English by Soviet director Roman Viktyuk. Vicki Wolf, managing 
director of Sushi Performance Gallery, which is presenting the Soviet 
performance art group, Derevo, Nov. 3-5, feels right on schedule for Sushi's 
80-seat space with 10 tickets sold for the Friday night performance and six for 
the Saturday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The last bubble has not yet burst for "Suds," the home-grown San Diego musical 
that played at the San Diego Repertory Theatre, the Old Globe Theatre and 
off-Broadway last year. It is scheduled for a May 1 production at La Mirada 
Civic Theatre in La Mirada as part of a subscription series. It will be the 
first "Suds" production done with a new director, new choreographer and new 
cast. The old cast keeps busy, too. Susan Mosher will star as Fanny Brice in 
"Funny Girl" at the Lawrence Welk Resort Theatre on Nov. 21-Jan. 27. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Scripteasers, a 41-year-old organization dedicated to helping writers develop 
new work, will present its 16th showcase, a reading of three one-act plays at 8 
p.m. Monday at the Elizabeth North Theatre. On the program is "A is A" and 
"Mixed Nuts," by Gary Seger, and "Franklin," by Laurence McGilvery and Justin 
McGilvery.

KNBC SWEEPS SLATE CLEAN FOR QUAKE STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The quake shook the Bay Area some 400 miles to the north, but Los Angeles 
television station KNBC saw it as the ultimate local story. From shortly after 
5 p.m. Tuesday, when the station's news department first learned of the 
disaster, until 7 p.m. Wednesday, Channel 4 scrapped all of its regular 
programming to provide continuous coverage of the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The NBC-owned station had never done that before -- not after the Whittier 
quake two years ago and not after the Sylmar quake in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
While rival station KCBS Channel 2 switched over to "The Pat Sajak Show" late 
Tuesday, KNBC kept its anchors up through the wee hours of the night to talk 
about the quake. While KABC Channel 7 broadcast its daytime soaps as scheduled 
Wednesday afternoon, Channel 4 carried San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos' press 
conference from the streets of that city's devastated Marina District. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the E-word," Tom Capra, KNBC's news director, said Thursday. 
"Earthquakes, especially one in San Francisco on the San Andreas fault, scares 
everyone down here. They want to know how bad it is. Many people here have 
relatives or friends in the Bay Area, and we want to know how they are. My 
daughter was evacuated from her dorm at San Jose State and is staying with her 
grandparents in Santa Cruz. I think people want to know as much as we can tell 
them." 
</P>
<P>
In the first hour after the quake rumbled through the Bay Area, Channel 4 
couldn't tell them much at all. Its San Francisco sister station, KRON, was 
knocked off air by the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
But from about 6 p.m. Tuesday onward, when the station was finally able to get 
pictures out of San Francisco, it was all earthquake, all the time. Like other 
local stations, Channel 4 sent several of its own reporters to the Bay Area, 
and also drove Phil Shuman to Santa Cruz in a rented satellite truck. 
</P>
<P>
Capra said that his station certainly did want to catch up with its 
competitors, who all had pictures of the area more than an hour earlier than 
Channel 4. But once the station was able to obtain KRON's coverage, which KNBC 
used liberally throughout the day, Capra said he figured: "Why stop? The 
satellites were working, we had our people there, we had their coverage and it 
was a story that changed and changed." 
</P>
<P>
John Beard, who anchored many hours of Channel 4's coverage, said that the 
extensive reporting was justified because Southern Californians can learn from 
any large earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though we're told it's going to happen here again, there's a part of your 
mind that refuses to believe it until you see it. We saw it for 24 hours -- how 
people dealt with it, how preparedness paid off and what kind of questions were 
raised about our readiness for the quake and about the infrastructure, the 
freeways and bridges down here. There are so many parallels that it becomes a 
Southern California story." 
</P>
<P>
KNBC's continuous coverage also proved a boon in the ratings. Between 6 a.m. 
and 4 p.m. Wednesday, Channel 4 averaged a 9.9 rating and 32% of the audience 
-- about twice the number of viewers it gets on a normal day. KABC Channel 7, 
which aired live earthquake coverage for part of that time period, registered a 
6.4, while KCBS Channel 2, which broadcast the majority of its regular 
schedule, received a 3.6 rating. KNBC's newscast from 4 to 6:30 p.m. Wednesday 
also easily outdistanced its two competitors. 
</P>
<P>
A KNBC spokeswoman said that a few viewers called to complain because they 
couldn't see their favorite soap opera, but calls to the station, she said, 
were running about 6-to-1 in favor of the extended quake reports. Capra said it 
was the first time that preempting regular programs didn't produce outrage from 
at least some viewers. 
</P>
<P>
"When Richard Ramirez was captured, we preempted the NBC baseball game of the 
week to go live with that," he said, "and this guy called up the newsroom and 
said he was going to come down here and rip my heart out. Here they captured 
the Night Stalker, who had been terrorizing the entire area, and this guy 
wanted to kill me over missing the second inning of the Cubs and Cardinals. We 
didn't have anything like that this time." 
</P>
<P>
Capra added that sending reporters up to the Bay Area and procuring satellite 
time to beam their reports back to Los Angeles did cost the station 
"something," but he added that the extensive coverage was not "overly 
expensive." He said he could not be more specific. No extra personnel were 
hired and the station was able to air all of its regular local advertising 
spots. 
</P>
<P>
Some of KNBC's competitors, who chose not to devote so many hours to the San 
Francisco quake, complained that KNBC's coverage in the middle of the day 
Wednesday became "repetitive and boring." But Channel 4 personnel dismissed 
that criticism as sour grapes. 
</P>
<P>
"This is such an important story for us in Los Angeles. It deserves this kind 
of attention," said KNBC anchor Linda Alvarez. "It's going to happen here and 
we can all get prepared with radios and flashlights and water. But we have to 
keep mentally prepared too, and this really helps us to see what can happen. I 
think showing as much as we can of what happened up there really makes it hit 
home. I don't think we can over-report this story." 
</P>
<P>
And when the big one finally does hit at home? "We wouldn't be off the air 
yet," Capra said Thursday. "You'll see us here for for days on end."

'PEOPLE NEXT DOOR' SHOWN THE DOOR AT CBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KAYE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CBS axed its new Monday-night comedy "The People Next Door" Thursday, marking 
the first cancellation of the new season. 
</P>
<P>
The low-rated sitcom was chock-full of special effects, revolving around a 
cartoonist who could make anything in his vivid imagination come to life. 
</P>
<P>
" 'The People Next Door,' given the time to develop its audience, would have 
been a success," said David Salzman, president of Lorimar, which produced the 
show. "But CBS needs a quick fix." 
</P>
<P>
The show, which premiered Sept. 18, had been part of the network's all-comedy 
night. Network executives were concerned that the low ratings it was garnering 
at 8:30 p.m. were hurting the programs that followed. 
</P>
<P>
The network did not immediately announce what will fill the open slot. Instead, 
CBS will give 8:30 p.m. tryouts to "Newhart" on Oct. 23 and to "The Famous 
Teddy Z" on Oct. 30. "Doctor, Doctor" a sitcom starring Matt Frewer that ran 
last summer, will begin airing Nov. 13 in the 10:30 p.m. Monday slot now 
occupied by "Newhart." 
</P>
<P>
Network programmers will evaluate ratings during the next few weeks before 
deciding on permanent repositioning. 
</P>
<P>
Steve and Madeline Sunshine, executive producers of "The People Next Door," 
said Thursday that they felt the plug was pulled too soon. "It's a show that 
needed time," said Steve Sunshine. "I think that hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
The husband-and-wife team, who are best known for producing the sitcom 
"Webster," feel the show was improving every week and that their best episodes 
had not yet aired. Only five of the 10 episodes they had completed were 
broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
"We discovered which (special) effects worked best and which not to use," said 
Madeline Sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband said that they learned quickly that having characters suddenly pop 
into the picture "was a nice idea but was getting tiring." The team quickly 
dispatched a talking moose head on the wall, which appeared in the pilot, 
because it looked too "Saturday morning -- too puppety." 
</P>
<P>
"The moose cried all night," Steve Sunshine added. 
</P>
<P>
The couple said they would like to have aired their later episodes out of 
sequence and put them on right away. But the complicated schedule required for 
the special effects prohibited any episode juggling. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Sunshines said they enjoyed making the show, they do not plan to 
produce another special effects-type series for a long time, if ever. 
</P>
<P>
Said Steve Sunshine, "I can't even go to a George Lucas movie again."

The Washington-based National Endowment for the Arts is awaiting a review of 
the Bay Area arts situation by a senior staff member who happened to be in San 
Francisco at the time of the quake. The endowment said it was prepared to offer 
disaster relief funds to arts institutions that sustained specific losses of 
such things as vehicles, costumes and buildings. Affected organizations can 
contact the endowment program office that oversees their disciplines. The 
endowment's general telephone number is (202) 682-5400.

ALL THAT'S SOVIET ISN'T RUSSIAN; 
</P>
<P>
OPERA: FOUR MUSICIANS FROM THE TBILISI OPERA THEATRE WILL OPEN THE SOVIET ARTS 
FESTIVAL WITH A RUSSIAN OPERA THAT IS NOT PART OF THEIR GEORGIAN NATIONAL 
TRADITION.

As the Soviet Arts Festival is about to prove, not all Soviet art is Russian. 
The Faberge Imperial eggs, for instance, are luxurious Russian artifacts 
commissioned by the czars, but the festival's icon exhibit organized by the 
Timken Gallery is from the treasury of Georgian religious art on loan from the 
State Art Museum of Georgia. Modest Mussorgsky's opera "Boris Godunov," which 
opens the festival Saturday night, recounts the turbulent political upheavals 
of 16th-Century Russian history, but, for the four visiting musicians from 
Georgia's Tbilisi Opera Theatre, "Boris Godunov" is not part of their Georgian 
national tradition. Although Georgia is now one of the 15 Soviet republics, the 
roots of Georgian culture pre-date its inclusion in the Soviet Union in 1921. 
</P>
<P>
If bass Omar Khoperia, who will sing Varlaam in San Diego Opera's "Boris 
Godunov" production, had his druthers, he would be singing in Zakhary 
Paliashvili's "Absolom and Eteri," a classic of the Georgian opera tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be much more pleasant for me to sing Georgian national music in San 
Diego," said Khoperia through an interpreter provided by San Diego Opera. " 
'Boris Godunov' is one thing -- Georgian opera is another." 
</P>
<P>
It is not that conductor Jansoug Kakhidze and his three Tbilisi Opera singers 
don't like "Boris Godunov." Kakhidze, whose English is fluent enough to 
interrupt and clarify his interpreter, proudly talked about a "Boris" 
performance by his Tbilisi Opera company in Moscow's prestigious Bolshoi 
Theatre on tour four years ago. Georgians take pride in their own musical 
heritage, however, which is distinct from the Russian tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Kakhidze, who will conduct San Diego's "Boris," is Tbilisi Opera's director and 
head conductor, as well as a conductor of Georgia's State Symphony. (San Diego 
Opera's "Boris Godunov" production brings together two principal singers from 
Leningrad's Kirov Opera, the four Georgians, and American stage director 
Nathaniel Merrill, as well as the San Diego Opera chorus and other American 
singers in comprimario roles.) That Kakhidze could participate in the San Diego 
festival with several members of his company is an unmistakable result of 
perestroika, according to Khoperia. Before the Gorbachev era, he noted, only a 
single singer would be allowed to perform in the West. In addition to Khoperia, 
the visiting Tbilisi contingent includes tenor Teimuraz Gugushvili and bass Gia 
Asatiani. 
</P>
<P>
Last year at Boston's Soviet arts festival, "Making Music Together," Kakhidze 
made a highly favorable North American debut conducting a contemporary Soviet 
opera, Rodion Shchedrin's "Dead Souls." Boston selected Kakhidze to conduct the 
Shchedrin opera, even though he had not conducted it prior to the Boston Opera 
production. 
</P>
<P>
"Shchedrin and I are great friends," said Kakhidze, "even though he lives in 
Moscow, which is far from Tbilisi. I have toured all around Europe conducting 
his compositions, and I consider him one of the prominent contemporary Russian 
composers." Shchedrin's Second Piano Concerto, which will receive its West 
Coast premiere with the San Diego Symphony Nov. 2, was presented in Boston 
under Kakhidze's baton. 
</P>
<P>
Both Khoperia and Kakhidze stressed that Georgians find singing as natural as 
most cultures find speaking. In spite of a long tradition of folk singing, 
Kakhidze explained that Georgian opera did not come into its own until the 
early decades of the 20th Century. Although the operas of Paliashvili and 
contemporary Georgian composers such as Gia Kancheli rarely are performed 
outside of the Georgian Republic, in purely musical terms, they compare with 
the national, patriotic operas of, say, Smetana and Dvorak. 
</P>
<P>
"Georgian people like very much to sing. If three Georgians get together, they 
will start singing in parts," said Khoperia, alluding to the polyphonic nature 
of Georgian folk song. 
</P>
<P>
"Georgian people have beautiful voices," Kakhidze said. "Most do not work as 
professional singers, but they sing when working, at weddings, when sitting at 
table -- every connection between people is celebrated in singing." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most European vocal folk music, which consists of a single melodic line, 
Georgian folk song developed a complex polyphonic tradition early in its 
history. It is basically choral singing, rather than solo singing. San Diegans 
who attend the Georgian State National Singing and Dancing Ensemble at the 
Spreckels Theatre (Nov. 1-5) will hear some of this traditional Georgian choral 
folk music. 
</P>
<P>
"In Europe, instrumental music was more developed," Kakhidze said. "But in 
Georgia, singing was everything."

'NOT KNOWING' WEARS DOWN CALLERS TRYING TO GET THROUGH

The Brock family in San Clemente kept trying to get through. After 2 1/2 days, 
nerves were frazzled and worn thin. Then, late Thursday afternoon from Santa 
Cruz came the telephone call from Bob Brock's sister, who said: "We're safe. 
No, we didn't get hurt, and Mom's OK." 
</P>
<P>
Brock's sister, Betty Rucker, and his 90-year-old mother, Freda Brock, were 
emotionally shaken but safe after Tuesday's 6.9 temblor, which left much of 
downtown Santa Cruz in rubble. And Rucker herself had escaped injury because 
she left her work at a department store in the Santa Cruz mall about about an 
hour before the earthquake hit at 5:04 p.m. One woman died in the store, and 
another was critically injured when the roof collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Magdalena Ortega's vigil also ended Thursday when the Huntington Beach woman 
finally got word that both her nieces -- Maria Prado of Hollister and Lupe 
Palomares of San Jose, and their families -- were safe. "It was the fear of not 
knowing," a much-relieved Ortega said. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of other Orange County residents unable to reach relatives in 
quake-devastated Northern California jammed telephone lines to the local 
offices of the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army in hopes of getting 
news. 
</P>
<P>
But Red Cross officials in Santa Ana said Thursday that they have been 
powerless to try to reach loved ones in the San Francisco Bay Area on behalf of 
thousands of people who called them. 
</P>
<P>
"Our volunteers have just been overwhelmed with the flood of people calling in 
here. With no way to communicate to Northern California, we are, essentially, 
helping people wait," Red Cross spokeswoman Sylvia Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
And so the thousands of requests -- called "disaster welfare inquiries" -- from 
local residents to contact loved ones sat untouched in a bin at the Santa Ana 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"What we do is try and reassure family members down here. We're giving them 
options," Stewart said. "Like advising them to contact relatives in other 
states on the chance that they may have received word from relatives in San 
Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said contributions for quake relief reached $41,835 Thursday, up 300% 
from Wednesday. And more than 900 pints of blood had been collected in the 
first 24 hours after the quake, prompting the Red Cross to reduce its 
blood-donating hours on Friday and during the weekend, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we have no indication that we will be needing more blood," Stewart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Pacific Bell spokeswoman in Orange County said telephone service 
to the Bay Area had improved Thursday, but many people continued to experience 
difficulty calling the Santa Cruz and San Francisco areas. Pacific Bell 
officials continued to advise customers to call only if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"The network was clogged," said Linda Bonnicksen of Pacific Bell. "But the 
network came through OK. It's just that customers began picking up their 
telephones all at the same time and it almost collapsed our system. (But) more 
calls are going through more freely throughout the state." 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, where 80 bilingual Pacific Bell operators handled calls from 
throughout the state from Spanish-speaking customers, volume jumped 25% 
Wednesday, up from an average of 14,000 calls a day, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our operators talked to one man who had tried to reach his son in San Jose. 
The minute he heard the voice of one of our Spanish-speaking operators, he 
started crying. Apparently it had been a very frustrating time for him," 
Bonnicksen said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Brocks' days of frantic calls to Santa Cruz, it was Betty Rucker 
who finally reached them in San Clemente, said Rose-Marie Brock, adding: "She 
said that Tuesday's quake was a close call." 
</P>
<P>
"At least we know they're safe," Bob Brock said. 
</P>
<P>
Rucker, a saleswoman at Ford's Department Store in the downtown mall, told them 
she usually works until 5 p.m. But on Tuesday, she went in an hour earlier than 
usual and left about 4 p.m. When the earthquake struck little more than a hour 
later, the front of the building collapsed, killing one woman inside and 
critically injuring another on the sidewalk, the Brocks said. 
</P>
<P>
"My sister was upset because she couldn't get hold of me," he said. "Is she 
frightened? She doesn't even want to go back downtown to look at the rubble." 
</P>
<P>
Maria Prado told Magdalena Ortega and other relatives in Orange County that to 
call them, she had to drive to Gilroy from Hollister, where telephone service 
had been interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
Damage was extensive in Hollister, an older rural community with many 
wood-frame homes, she said.

O.C. STUDENTS HELP OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Students at two Orange County schools have launched fund-raising drives to help 
survivors of Tuesday's massive earthquake that killed at least 34 people and 
injured thousands of others in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
Students and faculty at Ladera Vista Junior High School in Fullerton on 
Thursday began a fund-raising drive for victims of the San Francisco Bay area 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
According to Andrea Goettinger, an English teacher at the school, the students 
and faculty donated $500 during a collection drive Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
At Arroyo Elementary School in North Tustin, the student council launched a 
similar drive Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
At Ladera, the drive started in a 7th grade English class, when a student asked 
how they could help.

A brush fire that raged unchecked for a second day spread into the rugged 
canyons of southern Orange and Riverside counties Thursday, blackening more 
than 9,200 acres and filling the sky with ash that left fine deposits on cars 
and lawns as far away as Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze began Wednesday morning during a military exercise at the Marine 
Corps base at Camp Pendleton in San Diego County. It crossed into Orange and 
Riverside counties and burned in narrow canyons near the Cleveland National 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
At nightfall, the fire was threatening the Riverside County village of Rancho 
Carrillo, a cluster of small horse ranches east of the Ronald W. Caspers 
Wilderness Park. A contingent of firefighters on about 50 fire trucks were 
called to battle the flames. 
</P>
<P>
They were among the nearly 800 firefighters who battled the blaze all day under 
a sun turned to an angry red ball by billowing clouds of smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the brush fire's massive size, however, no structures were lost. But 
because it was burning in such rugged terrain, officials predicted that the 
blaze may take four or five days to contain. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the flames raced 
</P>
<P>
through thick fields of chaparral and groves of old oak and pepper trees. 
Carcasses of field mice and rabbits littered the bleak landscape. A fawn was 
seen trying to forage among the embers. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping tabs on the general direction of the fire proved to be a daunting task 
for the army of firefighters, who were being hampered by capricious winds that 
picked up shortly after dawn Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's bouncing back and forth in all directions," Marine Gunnery Sgt. Roy L. 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Suzanne Olson said only three buildings have 
been threatened by the fire, and none were homes. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a whole lot out there. It is just wide open space," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Olson said the fire appeared at one point to be headed in the direction of 
about seven houses that are in Verdugo Canyon. "We told folks that if they want 
to evacuate, it's entirely voluntary," she said. 
</P>
<P>
One resident who decided to stay was Jack Barnes, owner of an expansive 
thoroughbred ranch off the Ortega Highway, who went about his business while 
ignoring the red cloud of smoke that billowed over a nearby ridge line. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes said he had been through occasional fires in the area and did not fear 
for his house. 
</P>
<P>
"I ain't evacuating, but I might have to throw some sprinklers on," he said. 
"Fires don't bother me. This happens all the time." 
</P>
<P>
In Rancho Carrillo, residents were told not to try to evacuate because the long 
dirt road to Ortega Highway would be too dangerous. Instead, they were 
instructed to gather in a large corral if the fire moved toward the village 
while firefighters set up equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Residents also took special care to protect their horses. Marty Myers said she 
rubbed petroleum jelly into the nostrils of her four $20,000 Peruvian horses to 
keep them from spooking when they smell smoke. "These horses are our entire 
investment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Eight air tankers and four water-dropping helicopters bombarded the flames, 
while engine and hand crews worked from the ground. Agencies participating in 
the firefighting effort included the Orange County Fire Department and several 
city fire crews; firefighters from San Diego and Riverside counties, the U.S. 
Forest Service, the state Division of Forestry and the San Diego city Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Marine Lt. Patrick Gibbons said that exact cause of the fire was under 
investigation. Marines were training in the area when the fire began.

CURTIS' FOES RAISE $155,422 FOR RECALL BID;

<P>
POLITICS: MISSION VIEJO COUNCILMAN IS ACCUSED OF POWER-MONGERING, BUT HE SAYS

<P>
Leaning heavily on corporate Orange County, recall organizers trying to unseat 
City Councilman Robert A. Curtis have raised $155,422, according to financial 
statements filed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The largest contributor, the Mission Viejo Co., spent $35,717, while 13 other 
businesses and political action committees -- some as far away as Covina and 
Los Angeles -- contributed $95,750, the statements filed by the Coalition to 
Recall Councilman Curtis show. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Curtis received contributions totaling $9,660, according to his 
financial report. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I should feel flattered," Curtis said. "This dramatically illustrates 
for the city that the Philip Morris Co. is trying to buy City Hall." The 
Mission Viejo Co. is owned by New York-based Philip Morris Cos. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
A Mission Viejo Co. spokeswoman, however, responded that the company has been 
opposed for years to any attempts to change city boundaries and objects to 
Curtis' efforts to annex a parcel of land to the new city. 
</P>
<P>
Recall proponents turned in 12,001 signatures to the city clerk Sept. 28 in a 
bid to force a recall election. The petitions are being checked to determine 
whether there are 7,770 valid signatures, the number needed to place on the 
ballot a recall question on Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition, which describes itself as a citizens' group, has accused Curtis 
of being a divisive force on the City Council and of power-mongering through 
his efforts last spring to annex Aegean Hills, a section of land near the San 
Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
But Curtis has countered that the real powers behind the recall drive are 
developers, particularly the Mission Viejo Co., who are angry with his 
slow-growth stance. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess their financial statement shows just how badly they want me out," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether it is overkill to contribute such a large sum, Mission Viejo Co. 
spokeswoman Wendy Wetzel said: "We invest millions of dollars in Mission Viejo. 
It is our business. We have opposed for many years any attempts to change the 
boundaries of Mission Viejo without a vote from the residents of our planned 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Wetzel also confirmed that included in the company's contribution was $10,000 
spent for the services of high-powered political consultant Lynn Wessell of 
Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Another big pro-recall contributor was Kathyrn G. Thompson, president of Laguna 
Audubon II, a development firm that donated $25,000 and that has subcontracted 
work with the Mission Viejo Co. Contributing $10,000 each were the Frost Group 
of Laguna Niguel, Baldwin Builders Inc. of Irvine, the William Lyon Co. of 
Newport Beach and the Alliance for Representative Government of Covina. Another 
nine contributors gave $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis predicted that developers will see a backlash from citizens, who will be 
irritated by the involvement of outside interests in local issues. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of Mission Viejo will highly resent this blatant power play by the 
building industry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Helen Monroe, leader of the recall movement, said she found it 
appropriate to accept money from corporations based outside the county: "Many 
of these companies build in Mission Viejo. We were delighted to get their 
support. Obviously, this man has irritated some developers." 
</P>
<P>
Curtis has also accused the Mission Viejo Co. of coaxing developers to send 
money to the recall campaign, which company officials deny. 
</P>
<P>
"We have certainly discussed the issue with others," Wetzel said, "but the 
individual corporations have made their own decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Among the spending listed by the pro-recall group are $65,922 paid to employees 
to circulate petitions, $20,367 spent on mailers and $12,774 paid to a Santa 
Monica-based law firm. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe said she considers the money well spent. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it wasn't overkill, because we reached our goal of 12,000 signatures" 
on the recall petitions, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis' contribution list was topped by the J.M. Peters Co. of Newport Beach, 
which gave $1,500. Four supporters who gave $500 each are Mayor William S. 
Craycraft, M.V. Imports, Fieldsted and Co. of Irvine and All Area Moving and 
Storage of Irvine. No other contributor gave more than $250. 
</P>
<P>
An employee in the city clerk's office said more than two-thirds of the 
signatures on the petitions have been examined, but she could not estimate when 
the job would be complete. State law requires verification of the petition 
signatures within 30 days.

ANTI-DRUG FAIR PLANNED FOR OCT. 28 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Organizers of an anti-drug fair predict more than 1,000 people will show up for 
the culmination of the second annual Red Ribbon Week at Saddleback College on 
Oct. 28. 
</P>
<P>
The all-day event is part of a national anti-drug campaign run by Parents for 
Drug-Free Use. Festivities will include a soap-box derby, pancake breakfast, 
games and live entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Ribbon campaign was inspired by the death of federal agent Enrique 
Camarena at the hands of drug traffickers, Chariton said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's event attracted more than 500 people to Saddleback College.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LICENSE TAG WAS A GAMBLE, INDEED

Sheriff's deputies, investigating what they say is the largest sports 
bookmaking operation ever uncovered in Orange County, could not help but smile 
when they saw the license plate on the vehicle belonging to a man they had 
arrested in the case. It read: AGMBLR2, with a license holder saying: THE GOOD 
THE BAD &amp; THE LUCKY. In a search of the vehicle Thursday, deputies said 
they recovered ledgers containing names of more bettors and betting agents. It 
was the latest development in the case, which has resulted in the arrests of 
eight people on suspicion of running the ring out of restaurants and residences 
in Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
"The new evidence will surely firm up our cases, and as we analyze the 
information, more arrests may follow," Investigator Larry Vance said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ford utility truck is registered to Vincent Marchionno, 40, of Fullerton. 
Marchionno was among seven men and one woman arrested Tuesday night when 
sheriff's deputies served search warrants on residences in Anaheim, Lakewood, 
Bellflower and Norwalk. They also searched Spoons restaurants in Santa Ana and 
Tustin and Shipmates Tavern in Cerritos, where some of the suspects worked. 
</P>
<P>
Searches yielded ledgers and computerized records that Vance said appear to 
contain the coded identities of hundreds of bettors. The operation allegedly 
involved using employees of popular Orange County bars and restaurants as 
agents to take bets on professional and collegiate baseball, football, 
basketball, hockey and horse racing. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies paid for the costs of their undercover investigation by placing 
winning bets on basketball's Los Angeles Lakers and baseball's Oakland 
Athletics, according to the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Marchionno had refused deputies' request to search his vehicle when he and two 
others were arrested at a Bellflower apartment Tuesday. Deputies alleged that 
the men were accepting bets on the telephone when the arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
Vance said he secured a warrant to search Marchionno's truck Thursday and 
confiscated betting slips and ledgers that he alleged could point investigators 
to the ringleaders of the alleged $3-million-a-year operation. 
</P>
<P>
When contacted at his home Thursday, Marchionno declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
He has been released on $10,000 bail. Thomas Eric Stevens, 52, of Norwalk and 
Mary Scallon, 25, a bookkeeper at Spoons in Tustin, were released after posting 
$50,000 and $10,000 bail, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Vance said the suspects still in jail on suspicion of bookmaking and conspiracy 
to commit bookmaking included two Spoons managers, Michael Dunn, 38, of Tustin 
and Thomas Sullivan, 30, of Fullerton; also Robert Reed, 59, of Anaheim; Donald 
Richard Trava, 37, of Lakewood, and Ian White, 30, of Bellflower. Bail for 
Trava and Reed was set at $50,000 each, $10,000 for the others. DAVAN MAHARAJ

COUNCIL CONTINUES WAREHOUSE HEARING

<P>
Plans for a 70,300-square-foot concrete warehouse in Buena Park, which had been 
opposed by dozens of neighborhood residents, will be the subject of a hearing 
Nov. 20. 
</P>
<P>
A motion to continue the hearings to Nov. 20 was passed after Alloy Die Casting 
appealed to the City Council during a recent public hearing, stating that 
changes had been made since the initial submission of plans. 
</P>
<P>
"We have met with the neighbors on several occasions and have been able to 
negotiate many issues," Alloy vice president Jay A. Andrews said. "We have 
changed the height to 30 foot, and have agreed to set the building back, out of 
view." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Anderson, resident and homeowner in the Poet housing development near the 
proposed site on Caballero Boulevard, said in his appeal to the City Council: 
"We feel that a lot of the problems have been worked out. We are not opposed to 
the building, just the height. We could live with a 26-to-28-foot outside wall, 
but not 30 foot."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA'S BID FOR INJUNCTION REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID BURKE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge Thursday dismissed the city of La Habra's request for a 
temporary injunction to stop the county from taking over a federal job-training 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Ruling that the federal courts have no jurisdiction in such matters, U.S. 
District Court Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler refused to issue an order 
restraining the county from seeking or accepting designation as a Service 
Delivery Agency (SDA) for the program, which serves 10 North County 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is control over a federally funded Job Training Partnership Act 
program that spends nearly $1 million annually in 10 North Orange County 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
The county is scheduled to take over the program on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
City officials expressed concern that the county would abandon the existing 
"fair share" philosophy that provides services to the 10 communities based on 
population. 
</P>
<P>
"The county may well determine a 'critical need' for youth services in the city 
of Buena Park and allocate most, if not all, of such available funds to Buena 
Park to the exclusion of the other cities within the SDA," said La Habra City 
Manager Lee Risner in written comments to the court. 
</P>
<P>
Funds are currently being allocated to La Habra, Buena Park, Brea, Cypress, 
Fullerton, La Palma, Los Alamitos, Placentia, Stanton and Yorba Linda. DAVID

ROSARY HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM OKD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite concerns from neighbors about noise and traffic, the City Council has 
given the go-ahead for Rosary High School to build a gymnasium on the east side 
of the school. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city Planning Commission approved the 14,000-square-foot gym and 
multipurpose building in September, about a dozen people who live near the 
school on North Acacia Avenue held up the project through appeals to the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing three hours of complaints from residents and pleas for support 
from high school students, teachers and administrators, the council voted 
unanimously this week to allow construction of the building. 
</P>
<P>
Rosary is a private Catholic girls school about half a mile west of Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints from residents focused on traffic and noise. If the gymnasium and 
multipurpose room were to be built, more people would be drawn to the school, 
residents reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Dardenne-Ankringa, 43, who lives near the school on Mountain View Place, 
charged that the school was given preferential treatment because it was run by 
a church. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't about churches or schools or motherhood, it's about following the 
(city) code," he told the council. 
</P>
<P>
School officials said the gymnasium will cut down on noise because basketball 
and volleyball games will be moved indoors. 
</P>
<P>
After approving the building, the council asked the school to work with 
neighbors and the city's Transportation and Circulation Commission to look for 
solutions to the traffic problems. TOM McQUEENEY

CITY TO SEEK MORE FAMILY RESTAURANTS

<P>
Fed up with fast food, the City Council has voted to adopt "an aggressive 
marketing approach" to attract more family restaurants to the city. 
</P>
<P>
A report by Community Development Director Phillip S. Paxton this week said 
that while the city is saturated with fast-food and takeout establishments, it 
can accommodate more sit-down restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"From an economic and demographic point of view, Yorba Linda can support 38% 
more restaurants than the average (city) in the United States," Paxton said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the motion was passed unanimously, the council did not reach agreement 
on how it will attract new restaurants to the city. LINDA HICKMAN

place me on a leave with a four-person vote, and I am not going to accept that 
vote." 
</P>
<P>
Four council members voted Tuesday for the forced administrative leave. Two 
other council members, both opposed to the action, walked out before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ron May, who voted in favor, said his colleagues will "proceed to 
take the legal and appropriate action necessary to ensure that our orders are 
enforced." 
</P>
<P>
The two council members who disagreed, Patricia A. McGuigan and Mayor Daniel H. 
Young, said such an action is not legally binding because it requires five 
council votes. And Cooper said the city charter does not give the council 
authority to place the city attorney on forced leave. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any legal possibility for them. They can hire a legal attorney if 
they wish, if they want to waste their money," Cooper said. "But no court would 
ever issue me an order to leave my office based on the charter as it currently 
stands." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper and others said the vote stems from the fact that three of the four 
council members who voted for the leave -- John Acosta, Richards L. Norton and 
Miguel A. Pulido Jr. -- have been in lawsuits involving the city. Norton 
remains involved in suits over two swap meets he operates, for which the city 
is seeking about $140,000 in fines, Cooper said. LISA MASCARO

Two incumbents and one challenger will vie for two seats on the Garden Grove 
school board in the Nov. 7 general election. 
</P>
<P>
Maureen G. DiMarco, 41, of Cypress and Richard H. Hain, 68, of Garden Grove 
will be seeking their third terms. Watson Lewis Warren, 44, of Santa Ana is 
making a second run at a post on the governing board of Orange County's second 
largest school district. 
</P>
<P>
DiMarco, an educational consultant and a third-year law student, also is 
president-elect of the California School Boards Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm running because I feel I have a lot to offer the school district. It's 
gone through all kinds of changes. The experienced leadership is there. I think 
I've got a lot of support," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her goals for a third term would include "maintaining a high level of quality 
of education" in spite of "funding fluctuations." 
</P>
<P>
Hain, a resident of Garden Grove since 1954, is a retired educator who was 
formerly the director of personnel for the district. He's seeking a third term 
because "I'm vitally interested in what happens in the Garden Grove Unified 
School District and to the young people who will graduate from it." 
</P>
<P>
He lists among the accomplishments of the current board "good utilization of 
special funds," including lottery money for projects ranging from carpeting 
classrooms to putting rubberized mats beneath playground equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Hain said the district has tightened graduation requirements, emphasized a 
global dimension in its social-studies programs and broadened the use of 
computers in all grade levels. 
</P>
<P>
Warren, an operating engineer, finished last in a field of eight candidates in 
1987, polling 1,387 votes. He also ran unsuccessfully in 1988 for a spot on the 
Rancho Santiago Community College District board. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the English-only program is important," Warren said. "I think it's too 
tough on teachers to have to teach in two different languages. I'm also in 
favor of fundamental schools, which place a heavy emphasis on the basics." 
</P>
<P>
He concedes that "this election will be an easy one for them (the incumbents) 
to win." Warren does not have a candidate's statement in the voter-information 
pamphlet mailed to all registered voters, and says he is planning no 
canvassing, mailings or signs promoting his candidacy.

JOURNEY: LINH LE, LOS AMIGOS CROSS-COUNTRY RUNNER WHO LEFT VIETNAM 10 YEARS 
AGO, WOULD RATHER DISCUSS HIS SPORT THAN HIS PATH TO THE U.S.

<TEXT>
<P>
It is about 30 minutes to race time, and Linh Le, a junior at Los Amigos High 
School, is entertaining his teammates near the starting line at Mile Square 
Park. Le, the team's best runner, also is quick with a joke or an animated 
expression, whatever it takes to keep his team loose. 
</P>
<P>
On this day, Le seems especially animated around his friends, though that may 
have something to do with the presence of a newspaper photographer standing to 
the side, taking his picture. 
</P>
<P>
For a boy who becomes painfully shy around strangers -- so much so that he 
actually runs away to avoid an approaching reporter -- Le has little trouble 
being himself in the camera's eye. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be a movie star," says Le, 16. "I figure in running, if you look 
good, you might get into a commercial, maybe get to say 'I'm going to 
Disneyland' or something like that. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to get in front of people. It makes you nervous, but it's a challenge. 
It builds confidence, I think." 
</P>
<P>
If anyone could be better blessed with confidence, it would be Le. As a runner, 
he is talented -- he won the aforementioned race by nearly a minute -- and 
rates among the county's best. 
</P>
<P>
Suggest that to Le, though, and his eyes open wide in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
"Why are you doing this story on me? There are so many better runners," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Le, who plans to study theater arts in college, is a natural actor, earning the 
highest grade in his first-year drama class, said his teacher, George 
Taylorson. 
</P>
<P>
"This kid has got some tremendous natural talent," Taylorson said. "He can 
really get into the role. He leaves himself and becomes another person. That's 
extremely difficult for a high school kid. Sitting in class, you hardly know 
he's there. But get him up on stage, and he comes alive." 
</P>
<P>
As the focus of a lunch-time interview, however, Le is obviously uncomfortable. 
Just trying to make eye contact with him is a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Especially when the subject is of his family's homeland, Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents say we're lucky to be here, so do your best, get a job, support 
your family," Le said. "They say in Vietnam they had it real bad. They never 
tell me why. They just don't want to think about it." 
</P>
<P>
Le, who was 6 when his family fled the country 10 years ago, says he was too 
young to remember the details of the escape. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a dream to me," he said. "I can see it, but it's like it didn't 
really happen." 
</P>
<P>
According to Linh's 19-year-old brother, Phuong (Philip) Le, the eldest of 
Linh's five siblings, the Le family arrived in the United States on July 11, 
1979, nearly eight months after fleeing the communist regime in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Like hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese refugees before them, the Le family 
had to sell its home, a three-bedroom brick house in Saigon, a farm and 
livestock to afford the approximately $2,000 in gold it took to leave the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
After selling their possessions, the family moved into a small hotel at Vung 
Tau, the port in which they would escape. After weeks of waiting, their turn 
came. At midnight, they crept to the dock and, along with friends and 
relatives, piled into two small fishing boats, 34 people in one, 29 in the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
For seven days, the two boats chugged through heavy, sometimes violent storms 
in the South China Sea, trying to find Malaysia, where they hoped to find 
refuge. 
</P>
<P>
But after the second day, the boats became separated by storm. For a long time, 
the families wondered if they'd ever see each other again, but on the fourth 
day, somehow the boats were rejoined. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, with food, water and fuel nearly gone, they came upon a manned 
oil platform, which flew flags of many nations. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, they didn't want to let us in; they didn't want to help us," Philip 
said. But after some of the Vietnamese dived from the boats and started 
climbing the oil rig's ladders, begging for help, they relented. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Le family landed on a tiny island off the Malaysian peninsula, 
where they stayed eight months before being granted entry to the United States. 
There, relatives living throughout Orange County awaited and helped them get 
started. 
</P>
<P>
The entire Le family -- father Luong, mother Hoa, Philip, Chau, 18, Linh, 
Karen, 13, Linda, 7, and Johnny, 6 -- currently share a four-bedroom home in 
Westminster. They moved there from Fountain Valley last year. 
</P>
<P>
At home, the Le family speaks mostly Vietnamese, enjoys traditional foods and 
discusses the current situation in Vietnam. "We talk about it a lot," Karen 
said. "My father's really concerned. It's really hard right now; there's no 
food and a lot of people are starving to death." 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is not a subject Linh wishes to discuss. For him, running, with all its 
sidetracks, is the favored topic. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he knew of any other Vietnamese runners of his ability, Linh 
shrugged and said: 
</P>
<P>
"Not many Vietnamese people get into sport. They don't have spirit. They don't 
understand scholarships. My parents don't. They say there's too many Americans 
who are bigger and stronger, that I won't make it to the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents are afraid I'll hurt myself running. When I'm tired they say 'Don't 
try any harder.' I tell them, you can't get hurt, but they don't believe me." 
</P>
<P>
This summer, Linh, who has been racing on and off since the sixth grade, 
attended a weeklong running camp for the first time. There, he said, a whole 
new world opened up for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned so many things," he said. "All the small stuff: sit-ups, push-ups, 
eating right, goal-setting . . . All those things can make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Sumner, the camp's director, said the runners were encouraged to take 
notes during the camp's mini-clinics, but Linh was one of a few who did so 
religiously. 
</P>
<P>
"I did bed checks at night," Sumner said. "And he'd have pages of notes with 
him." 
</P>
<P>
But when pressed on more serious subjects, namely his homeland, Linh speaks 
with a raised voice that soon begins to tremble. 
</P>
<P>
"The stuff my family tells me, it's sad stuff, bad stuff," he said. "Sometimes 
I'm curious, but that's because I don't even know what's going on. I mean what 
are we doing here? Why did North Vietnam come into South Vietnam? Why can't it 
be one country?" 
</P>
<P>
Had these words been spoken in drama class, Linh no doubt would have earned 
high marks once again. But they were spoken with sincerity . . . and reality. A 
reality from which Linh Le cannot run, or leave behind on stage.

CORONA DEL MAR HOLDS ON TO DEFEAT SADDLEBACK, 17-14 
</P>

<P>
Corona del Mar High School beat Saddleback, 17-14, in a Sea View League game 
Thursday at Newport Harbor High, and all it took was an interception returned 
for touchdown and a long field goal on a windy night. 
</P>
<P>
Get the feeling this wasn't easy? 
</P>
<P>
The difference in the game was Jerrott Willard, Corona del Mar's 
linebacker/running back/kicker, who kicked a 39-yard field goal with 54 seconds 
left in the third quarter. The field goal came after an eight-play Corona del 
Mar drive had stalled at the Saddleback 22. Willard, who has kicked a 44-yarder 
this season, had this one clear the crossbar with a lot to spare. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar scored first on Brian Lucas' two-yard run in the second quarter 
which capped a 60-yard drive. Willard ran twice for 39 yards in the drive. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings (5-2, 1-1) scored midway through the second quarter when 
defensive back Mark Perlmutter intercepted Saddleback quarterback Paul Delgado 
at the Corona del Mar 27 and returned the ball 73 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback finally mounted a drive late in the first half. Delgado, who 
completed five passes for 62 yards on the drive, was the main weapon as the 
Roadrunners (3-4, 1-1) drove from their 20. The score came when Delgado, his 
team on the Corona del Mar 19, threw a pass to Tony Colthirst, who managed to 
get into the end zone despite going up against seven defenders. 
</P>
<P>
But Saddleback's offense had trouble starting in the second half, and when 
Willard kicked his field goal, it appeared that Corona del Mar had a safe 17-14 
lead with 54 seconds to play in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But, again, Saddleback drove 80 yards and scored, this time on Delgado's 
five-yard pass to Robert Reyes, who made an exceptional leaping catch. 
</P>
<P>
On its next drive, Saddleback would get as far as the Corona del Mar 30, but 
Delgado overthrew a receiver and was intercepted by George Dickson. On 
Saddleback's last drive, Delgado, who completed 18 of 33 passes for 190 yards, 
drove his team to its 42 before being intercepted by Weston Johnson.

LOS ALAMITOS REWRITES SCRIPT WITH 'THE PLAY' TO WIN

Los Alamitos quarterback Todd Gragnano looked over the Cypress defense, looked 
to wide receiver Chad Millan, and knew he had to change the play. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied 7-7 and the Griffins on their 10 with 7:28 remaining, 
Gragnano had called a deep curl pattern. But he changed his mind at the line of 
scrimmage, and called for Millan to run a deep post pattern in hopes of getting 
behind Cypress' coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Gragnano's decision paid off as he completed a 90-yard touchdown pass to Millan 
to give Los Alamitos a 14-7 victory over Cypress Thursday night at Veterans 
Stadium. It was the Griffins' sixth consecutive victory over Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty impossible to stop that pass route," said Gragnano, who has 14 
touchdown passes this season. "It's sort of like 'The Play' for us. It works 
every time." 
</P>
<P>
The Griffins, 6-1 overall and 2-0 in the Empire League, ran the play only once 
against the Centurions (3-4, 1-1). 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I could get open," said Millan, who had dropped two earlier passes. "I 
just wanted to make sure I caught the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Cypress drove to the Griffins' 44 with 1:04 remaining, but the threat ended 
when a snap sailed over quarterback Bobby Hubbard's head for a 28-yard loss 
with 44 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes said the Centurians frustrated his team in the 
first half, holding the Griffins to 99 yards in total offense. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought (Cypress Coach John) Selbe had as good a game plan as anyone we've 
played, especially defensively, in the last four years," Barnes said. "We were 
really confused out there in the first half. We were kind of disoriented at 
halftime. There was a lot of yelling and screaming in the locker room."

Laguna Hills High School got the maximum number of points from a minimum amount 
of effort Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks were handed opportunity after opportunity by Costa Mesa and the 
result was a 41-7 Pacific Coast League victory in front of 1,000 at Mission 
Viejo High School. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure we really played that well," Laguna Hills Coach Steve Bresnahan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks (4-3 overall, 2-0 in league play) scored six touchdowns, four on 
drives of fewer than 32 yards. In fact, three of them were fewer than 14 yards 
and two of those began inside the Costa Mesa 10-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa (0-7, 0-2) fumbled seven times, losing two. Mustang quarterback Mike 
Cutler also threw four interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Darrin Chapman touched the ball only seven times, but scored four touchdowns in 
various ways. He gave the Hawks an early lead with a 29-yard touchdown 
reception that capped a 77-yard drive, the only sustained effort Laguna Hills 
had to make. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman scored on runs of 18 and five yards. He also returned a kickoff 75 
yards for a touchdown.

SAVANNA COMES BACK TWICE TO TIE NO. 8 VALENCIA, 14-14

Savanna High School scored more points than any other Valencia opponent this 
season Thursday night, but it wasn't enough for a victory as the teams played 
to a 14-14 tie in an Orange League game at Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
For a number of reasons, it had to be one of the more satisfying ties for 
Savanna (3-3-1, 1-0-1). Valencia (6-0-1, 1-0-1), the six-time defending league 
champion, came into the game ranked eighth in Orange County. Savanna didn't win 
a league game last season. First-year Savanna Coach Fred Di Palma, who was a 
Valencia assistant for the past two years, said the key was to make his players 
believe they had a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"If they didn't think they were going to win, we would have been crushed," Di 
Palma said. 
</P>
<P>
With few exceptions, Valencia's defense again was unyielding. But those 
exceptions -- both 47-yard touchdown plays -- proved costly, and both tied the 
score for Savanna. The first, in the first quarter, was a 47-yard pass from 
Carlos Robledo to Vince Flores. In the fourth quarter on fourth and six inches 
at the Valencia 47, Rebel running back Kenison PoChing appeared stopped short 
of the first down, but he bounced to the outside and eluded two desperate 
tackle attempts downfield. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia scored on its first possession of the game, on a 13-play drive that 
ended with a two-yard touchdown run by Sergio Ortiz. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia's other touchdown, a 10-yard pass from Richard Wells to Scott Weinman, 
followed Scott Wilson's 45-yard punt return.

Nichols Institute: The national provider of diagnostic laboratory services 
based in San Juan Capistrano, posted third-quarter net income of $1.3 million, 
more than double the net income of $636,000 in the same quarter a year ago. 
Third-quarter revenue was $32.8 million, up 30% from $25.2 million a year ago. 
The company's net income for the first nine months of 1989 was $3.4 million, up 
70% from $2 million. Its revenue for the nine-month period was $95.5 million, 
up 49% from $64.1 million last year. Company officials said the growth in 
revenue and earnings was the result of improved service and increased marketing 
efforts as well as last year's acquisition of a laboratory in St. Cloud, Minn.

AST Research: The personal computer manufacturer in Irvine reported a nine-fold 
increase in net income for the fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 29 of $2.9 
million contrasted with $306,000 a year earlier. Sales were up about 6% to 
$114.5 million from $108.4 million. AST attributed the improved performance to 
the introduction of its 386 computer and an increase in sales overseas.

The Hammond Co.: The Newport Beach mortgage banker reported net income of 
$928,769 for its fiscal second quarter, ended Sept. 30, a 68% increase over 
$553,404 earned in last year's second quarter. Quarterly revenue rose slightly 
to $6.6 million this year from $6.55 million. For its first six months, the 
company posted net income of $415,986, a 34% increase over $310,591 earned in 
the same period last year. Revenue for the period fell 3% to $11.2 million this 
year from $11.5 million. The second-quarter profit, spurred by increased sales 
of loans and reduced operating expenses, marked a return to profitability after 
the firm posted a $513,000 loss for its fiscal first quarter and a $1.1-million 
loss for its fiscal year.

BREEDING BIRDS: AMERICAN COOT; 
</P>
<P>
AMERICAN COOT, (CALYPTE ANNA)

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Times

<TEXT>
<P>
Description: Black head and neck, with small reddish-brown forehead shield, 
light bill with dark band near tip. Outer feathers of undertail coverts are 
white, inner ones black. Leg color ranges from greenish-gray in young birds to 
yellow or orangish in adults. In flight, a white trailing edge on most of wing 
is distinctive. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Freshwater marshes, wetlands or near lakes and ponds. 
</P>
<P>
Diet: Mostly aquatic vegetation and algae; also tadpoles, fish, crustaceans, 
snails, worms, aquatic and terrestrial insects, eggs of other marsh- nesting 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
Displays: Male paddles after female, flapping wings; female dives if too 
closely pressed. Male paddles with head and neck on water, wingtips raised 
above, spreads and elevates tail to display white patches. Female assumes 
similar pose. . 
</P>
<P>
Nest: Usually over water, in vegetation tall enough to conceal; consists of 
large floating cup of dead stems on platforms anchored to vegetation, lined 
with finer materials. Other platforms for resting and roosting, especially 
brood platform built mostly by male. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs: Pinkish-buff, marked with blackish-brown. Eggs are around 1.9 inches 
long. 
</P>
<P>
Natural history notes: Each year from October to April, Orange County is 
inundated with American coots. Last year, 50 permits to shoot coots were 
issued, mostly to golf courses. Mission Viejo, Woodbridge (Irvine) and many 
other communities with man-made lakes have the same complaint annually about 
these birds. They eat vegetation, destroy grass and defecate widely. 
Considering flocks may number up to 1,500 birds, coots may readily attain pest 
status. 
</P>
<P>
Coots are noisy and aggressively territorial. They select from a repertoire of 
some 14 displays to communicate among themselves. Not only are coots 
demonstrative, they are also hardy. They can adjust quite well to hot 
temperatures. They have lobed feet, which, in addition to their use in battle, 
can effectively conduct heat out of the body. 
</P>
<P>
They are opportunistic feeders. Besides hunting for themselves, coots also feed 
commensally by taking leftovers from other species such as dabbling ducks, or 
pirate plants brought to the surface by diving ducks. Groups of up to five 
juveniles may pirate aquatic vegetation from the bills of ducks and swans. 
</P>
<P>
These birds are the least graceful of all marsh birds. Commonly called 
"splatterers," coots bob their heads while walking, quite likely because the 
head movements help them to judge the distance to their prey. 
</P>
<P>

SINGLE LIFE: BEING UNMARRIED IS RIGHT STATE FOR SOME

Matt Story is a 47-year-old Laguna Hills plumbing contractor who has never been 
married. 
</P>
<P>
"People assume that I'm gay, a momma's boy, socially maladjusted -- or all 
three -- just because I enjoy living alone," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Story says he leads a normal, active life, enjoys children, pets and women, but 
prefers to remain unmarried because he likes the autonomy being single gives 
him. "Luckily, I have finally found a woman who feels as I do. In fact, we joke 
with each other that the perfect marriage would be not only separate bedrooms, 
but separate houses," he quips. 
</P>
<P>
One need not be a nit-picking fussbudget or a social malcontent to prefer 
single life over married life. 
</P>
<P>
"Forty percent of the adult population of the United States is simply not 
suited to marriage -- not psychologically disposed to it," says Norton F. 
Kristy, a psychotherapist who claims a large Orange County audience for his 
twice-weekly radio program on KFMB radio. "These people are not, in general, 
social misfits. Yet, society often thinks they are simply because they choose a 
different path in life. They are happier in relationships that are elective, 
rather than structured as in marriage." 
</P>
<P>
Michele Lamb, 22, of Costa Mesa is a tall, attractive young woman who has her 
sights set on a real estate career. She says she has plenty of dates but a 
degree in real estate acquisition has supplanted any desire for a "Mrs." 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother was raised to find a man who would take care of her -- she married 
and divorced three times looking for that -- and she never found 'Prince 
Charming.' I don't look at men as meal tickets. I can count on myself for 
financial and emotional security." Though she believes that she will someday 
marry, "I'm in no hurry at all," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Fineman, director of psychological services for a Huntington 
Beach-based medical group and associate professor of clinical psychology at UC 
Irvine, believes that early psychoanalytic literature has set a precedent that 
has been accepted by society, which is that once a certain age, a person should 
want to settle down and choose a mate. 
</P>
<P>
"Choosing a single life style, be it short-term, long-term or forever, is an 
option a person might choose for any number of healthy reasons, all of which 
might make a great deal of sense," Fineman contends. "There is a pervasive 
assumption in our society that anyone who doesn't want to marry is strange, 
which, of course, is not true." 
</P>
<P>
Many singles simply never feel the urge to marry. Others, such as Leigh-Ann 
Jensen of Dana Point, have experienced a change of attitude toward marriage. 
She is the single mother of two daughters who are now grown and themselves 
married. Divorced for nearly 20 years, she no longer has any interest in 
remarrying. "I married at 18 with no goals and very little self-confidence. 
When my children were young I wanted to remarry so that we could be a real 
family again. But after 10 years the girls were growing up. I started 
concentrating on my career." 
</P>
<P>
Jensen maintains that she enjoys her life alone. "I share my life when I can 
and want, rather than because I feel I must." 
</P>
<P>
Assumptions people make about her life style don't bother her. "I used to be 
very sensitive if men implied there was something wrong with me because I've 
been single for so long. Now I let people think whatever they like. I don't 
care anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Kristy contends that most people are not brave enough to follow their own 
natural rhythms and instead follow the lead of others. "It is entirely possible 
for a single person to identify himself or herself as an autonomous individual 
without necessarily being selfish or narcissistic, yet people assume that those 
who do not wish to marry are therefore unable or unwilling to share. I have not 
found this to be the case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Concentration on self-development, education and career are often best done 
without the responsibility of another person, according to both psychologists. 
</P>
<P>
"People who give thought to where they want to be in the world and take the 
time to develop themselves often form the most enduring relationships once they 
decide to marry," Fineman said. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Friberg, a theatrical agent who lives in Coto de Caza, was 40 years old 
when he married. 
</P>
<P>
Why did he wait so long? "Simple, I never fell in love until I met my wife. We 
have two kids and a great life, but I wasn't ready to settle down until six 
years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Does he miss being single? "I loved being single, and now I love being married. 
If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't change a thing." 
</P>
<P>
Even for those wedded to single life, the decision to go it alone has its 
disadvantages. 
</P>
<P>
Claire Fischer, 33, a Tustin-based trial attorney, concedes: "When I experience 
a victory in court -- or a defeat -- I have no special man to share it with, 
and that can be lonely. But I also have no one to have to cook for if I don't 
want to, and no one telling me how to spend my money. You can't have it all."

BLACKS AS ROLE MODELS: AN UP-TO-DATE CALENDAR;

Kenneth Vernon hopes his participation in the 1990 Orange County Black Role 
Model Calendar will help black youngsters better understand their own 
potential. He also hopes it will help change some preconceived notions about 
blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"You see so many negative stereotypes about blacks that I hope this shows that 
not all blacks are on welfare. Not all blacks are uneducated. Not all blacks 
don't have a strong male image in the home," says the 30-year-old geologist, 
who has a 4-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
Vernon is one of 14 nominees included in the calendar, which was created by a 
group of Orange County black businesswomen. The 12 nominees who receive the 
most votes from members of the community attending Selection Night today at the 
Irvine Marriott will be featured on the 12 months of the calendar. The other 
two will appear in the year-at-a-glance section. The calendar will also include 
biographical material on each man as well as highlighted black history dates. 
</P>
<P>
Nominees range in age from 20 to 58 and include entrepreneurs, a former FBI 
agent, a mortgage banker, a salesman and a young man who made his way from 
foster home care to studies at Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
Some are married. Some are single. Most have a college degree, though one of 
the nominees created a successful business in spite of only an eighth-grade 
education. 
</P>
<P>
The nominees include: Howard Wesley Anderson of Anaheim Hills, 42, a senior 
special investigator with Rockwell; Darrell L. Armstrong, 20, Anaheim, a 
Stanford University student in public policy and economics; Nathan T. Edwards, 
43, Costa Mesa, owner of Austin Diversified Productions, Costa Mesa; Ronald 
Harding, 48, Yorba Linda, owner of Ron Harding Moving &amp; Storage, Anaheim; 
Ottis Lenior, 43, Huntington Beach, a district sales manager with GTE; James D. 
McClellan, 42, Orange, a salesman with Digital Equipment Corp. in Irvine, and 
Robert Vernon McDonald, 42, Anaheim Hills, a marketing executive with United 
Stationers. 
</P>
<P>
Others are: James Edward Myers, 49, Anaheim Hills, insurance investigator and 
owner of the Vargas Co.; Leo Parker, 40, Tustin, owner of People Security, 
Santa Ana; Lionel Punchard, 37, El Toro, owner of First Republic Mortgage 
Corp., Santa Ana; Patrick Rhodes, 52, Lake Forest, an account manager with 
Digital Equipment Corp.; Anthony Romano, 58, Anaheim Hills, a realtor with ERA, 
Anaheim; Ron Shirley, 33, a credit manager with Xerox Corp. in Santa Ana, and 
Vernon, who works for Clayton Environment Consultants Inc. in Cypress and lives 
in Rialto. 
</P>
<P>
The calendar was the brainchild of a committee headed by Sandra Lynch of S.K. 
Lynch Productions in Santa Ana. Lynch and her associates came up with the idea 
after a speech by Thomas A. Parham, a psychologist and director of the Career 
Planning and Placement Center at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
According to Lynch, Parham challenged members of the Black Business Alliance of 
Orange County to do something positive to change the lack of visibility of 
black male role models in the community. 
</P>
<P>
The black male role models are out there, Lynch found. It's just a matter of 
taking the time to notice them. She says the calendar is making a statement 
that even in Orange County -- where blacks represent only 1.9% of the 
population, according to Parham -- they were easily able to find more than 
enough role models. 
</P>
<P>
Sports and entertainment figures were purposely excluded from the calendar. The 
difficulty with seeing only those people as role models is that it limits the 
scope of what black youngsters are encouraged to aspire to, says Parham, who 
assisted Lynch's committee with the project. 
</P>
<P>
He says the calendar will "allow us to really highlight a group of heroes for 
our young people. It allows our young people to believe in heroes who are 
important and significant, not because they can bounce a basketball or because 
they're an entertainer, but because they embody those characteristics that are 
most highly valued in the black community." 
</P>
<P>
"A role model to me," Parham says, "is some individual who can provide for and 
protect his family. A role model to me is somebody who puts his community and 
his group and his family before himself. A role model to me is somebody with a 
strong religious orientation. A role model to me is somebody . . . who goes to 
work every day . . . tries to advance himself and makes money and provides for 
himself in an honest way. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to understand really what heroes are. Heroes are nothing more 
than symbols, and as symbols, what they represent are the possibilities and 
potentialities for young people to do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
The calendars will be available in early December and will retail for $8.95 
each. Distribution plans are still in progress, however. Lynch hopes to be able 
to sell them in convenience stores and also to make them available to students 
through some corporate sponsorships. And she is negotiating with a soft-drink 
manufacturer who is considering using the calendars as a promotional item. 
</P>
<P>
The calendar is a for-profit endeavor for Lynch's committee, but she says they 
will be lucky to break even this year. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch's fellow calendar committee members, who selected the nominees, include: 
Thelma Cole, owner of Hair Castles, Santa Ana; Joyce Jordan of El Toro, owner 
of Office Services Unlimited; Marlene Dyce of Westminster, a fashion 
coordinator; Kathleen Barros of Moreno Valley, president of Access 
International in Riverside; Gwen McClellan of Orange, a sales representative 
with Digital Equipment Corp., Irvine; Ernesta Wright of Anaheim, who works for 
Elite Professional Services, and Tanya Ratcliff of Orange, owner of Tantra 
Enterprises Wordsmiths. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch hopes the 1990 calendar will be the first of many for Orange County -- 
and that the idea will spread to other areas. 
</P>
<P>
And Kenneth Vernon hopes that people will understand what the calendar project 
is really all about. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess what I'm trying to say," Vernon explains, "is that I'm not taking any 
particular pride in the fact that I'm a black geologist or a white geologist. I 
just want to get across that it doesn't matter what color you are. It matters 
how hard you strive for what you want to achieve, and color shouldn't be a 
barrier towards your goals. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be recognized as a black geologist. I want to be recognized as 
a good geologist who happens to be black. And if that is significant to black 
kids who are considering vocations, well then, I think that's good."

Luncheon/fashion show at the Muckenthaler Cultural Center in Fullerton. The 
annual fund-raiser, sponsored by the Center Circle guild, drew 238 guests at 
$20 a pop, raising an estimated $4,000 for the museum, according to board 
member Carolyn Loe. Tuesday's hazy skies and high humidity made the lawn party 
something of a shade hunt, with guests dipping their heads under table 
umbrellas and chitchatting under leafy trellises. The benefit started shortly 
before high (murky?) noon, with white wine, fruit punch and folksy standards 
("Oh Suzanna," "Hello, Dolly") played by a solo keyboardist whose electric 
piano was programmed to sound like a harpsichord. Guild President Pem Slack 
said the group hoped the music would complement the carousel-themed party 
(which complemented the carousel-themed exhibit in the museum galleries). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fashion Statements 
</P>
<P>
Guests wore print dresses and summer-weight knits -- casual "but not too 
casual," as Loe put it. The show, billed as "wearable art and jewelry," 
consisted of 30 ensembles, each featuring several one-of-a-kind pieces by local 
artisans. The handmade clothes and jewelry, priced from $50 to $1,500, ranged 
from a tie-dyed poncho and funky jade and brass necklace to an elegant satin, 
hand-painted tunic dress with matching kimono jacket. "Considering all the work 
that goes into (the pieces), they really aren't that expensive," mused guest 
Joanne Rogers, browsing a program with table-mates Evelyn Schirmer and Grace 
Hibbard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Who Was There 
</P>
<P>
Guild members Joanie SteinCQ and Betty Chapin, co-chairwomen of the event. Also 
members Sandy Smith, Mildred Bert, Jeanette Miller, Veda Chapel, Gladys Baker, 
Peggy Lake and Janet Krabbenhoft. "Guild daughters" (as they called themselves) 
Lisa Fiege-Kollmann and Kristin Casparie tagged along with moms Gloria Bagwell 
and Ruth Johnson, respectively. Fiege-Kollmann said she had been to the fashion 
show four or five times before. "I never buy any of the stuff, but I like to 
come because it's really fun, good food and nice women." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lunch 
</P>
<P>
Plates were handed outside at the museum's kitchen door and carried by each 
guest to her place at one of the tables centered with hand-painted paper 
carousel horses. Ultra-light helpings included salmon mousse, cold lemon soup, 
salad Nicoise and croissants. Dessert plates loaded with cookies and brownies 
waited at each table.

LIBERAL THINKINGS VS. BELIEFS OF CHRISTIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joseph N. Bell's article "The War Against Sin Offers Variety of Enemies" (Sept. 
21) was disturbing to read. In his article, Bell seemed to take delight in 
ridiculing the Rev. Lou Sheldon. I wonder if Mr. Bell realizes that his 
liberal, humanistic article and thinking is an offense to most Christians. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bell states that there wouldn't be much fun in the Rev. Sheldon's world. 
That couldn't be further from the truth. The closer one comes to living a life 
pleasing to God, the closer one is to genuine and lasting peace and joy. The 
happiest people I know are those who try, like the Rev. Sheldon, to follow the 
life outlined and practiced by Jesus. The unhappiest are those who try to 
rationalize why they don't see the need to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bell just couldn't be more wrong when he says nobody has a "direct pipeline 
to God." The Bible teaches us that God hears the righteous man's prayers and 
that he answers those prayers. But Bell is correct when he states that "one 
should not follow the advice of either him or the Rev. Sheldon" and that 
instead one must think it through for oneself. That is true -- but only true 
when one seeks the guidance and wisdom of God as he searches for that truth in 
the Bible. Wise men still do seek him. Only a fool thinks he, or any mortal 
man, has such profound answers. Jesus is the source of truth, and it is He we 
must follow.

Re: Joseph N. Bell's "War Against Sin," I would disagree with his conclusion 
that "we sin-fighters are left with defining sin with our own personal lights." 
One's "personal light" is hardly a suitable guide. My "personal light" tells me 
that 80 m.p.h. on an uncrowded freeway is a suitable speed for both my car and 
my driving ability. Guess who would disagree? 
</P>
<P>
We are a nation governed by law, not a democracy governed by the majority. The 
law is designed to protect me from those whose "personal lights" say it's OK to 
harm me. I'm sure Mr. Bell will find this hard to take, but most of our law, as 
it relates to humankind's crimes against one another (sins), has its precedent 
in biblical law. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bell has difficulty in accepting the biblical definitions of sin. I wonder 
why. If that collection of books is suitable to form the foundation for the 
moral codes of Western civilization, then it should certainly be suitable to 
define the very disease for which it provides the cure, sin. 
</P>
<P>
More money and time has been expended, than any time prior, on sex education, 
acceptance of homosexual life styles, state and federally financed abortion, 
drug interdiction and drug law enforcement. In recent years, these moral issues 
have been dealt with without the benefit of biblical ethics. Let's examine the 
results. Unwed teen pregnancies are skyrocketing, teen suicide is higher than 
ever, AIDS accelerates its deadly toll within the homosexual community, child 
abuse and sexual molestation by parents is rapidly increasing, and we're no 
closer to winning the drug war than we've ever been. 
</P>
<P>
Could Lou Sheldon and the other "narrow-minded fundamentalists" possibly be 
right in believing that the problem is sin and that these other symptoms of the 
problem could be done away with once the problem is recognized and dealt with?

INFORMANT-AIDED CONVICTIONS GOING UNCHALLENGED; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: FEW DEFENSE LAWYERS ARE ACCEPTING AN INVITATION TO APPEAL MURDER 
CONVICTIONS OBTAINED WITH THE HELP OF JAILHOUSE SNITCHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED ROHRLICH, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although many defense lawyers shouted their outrage when a jailhouse informant 
scandal broke last year, surprisingly few have accepted invitations from the 
Los Angeles County prosecutor to challenge murder convictions that were 
obtained with informants' help. 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner's office said it has sent invitations to defense lawyers 
in 142 cases that resulted in convictions in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers so far have taken steps to challenge convictions in only 13 of 
the cases. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Antonio Barreto Jr., a member of a four-person team organized by the 
district attorney's office to handle an expected mountain of litigation, 
commented: "There was an awful lot of noise at the beginning, and very little 
action." 
</P>
<P>
Gerald F. Uelmen, dean of the law school at the University of Santa Clara, 
characterized the defense response as "disappointing. I'd go further and say it 
may be cause for alarm if it indicates a wholesale abandonment of clients by 
their lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors and defense lawyers, in interviews, suggested many reasons for the 
small response, ranging from lawyer laziness, to incompetence, to a belief that 
appeals would be futile because informants played only a small role in some 
cases in which there was ample other evidence of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, many attorneys cited a belief that they had no ethical obligation 
to represent former clients. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a year after the scandal broke, there is no agreement on the number of 
cases in which jailhouse informant testimony figured. The district attorney's 
office, which now says the number of cases involving informants in the last 
decade is 142, has, at various times, put the number at 175 or more. The Los 
Angeles Criminal Courts Bar Assn., a predominantly defense lawyer group, has 
placed the number at 240. Almost all are murder cases. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Nelson, an attorney at the Los Angeles office of the California 
Appellate Project, which finds and supervises lawyers to handle appeals for 
indigent felons, said she has identified about 170 defendants who now have no 
lawyers because their appeals have been denied. The overwhelming majority of 
their former lawyers have declined to try to reopen cases. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said many of these lawyers have a false expectation that some other 
agency, such as the Los Angeles County Grand Jury, will look to see whether 
injustices have been done. But former California Supreme Court Justice Otto 
Kaus, who is acting as special counsel to the grand jury on informants, has 
said repeatedly that he is not looking at individual cases -- only at possible 
patterns of law enforcement misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
The office of the state public defender, which is the other main source for 
representation of indigents in appeals of their criminal convictions, said in a 
letter last March that it was "unable to participate" in informant litigation 
on closed cases. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Assistant State Public Defender Edward H. Schulman said in the letter 
that his agency had identified eight of its cases that involved informants and 
were still on appeal. Schulman said the agency would investigate the 
possibility of litigating in formant questions in those cases, but warned that 
his appellate lawyers had "very little expertise in the handling of the kinds 
of evidentiary hearings which may be contemplated." 
</P>
<P>
His comments highlighted another persistent problem: While many trial lawyers 
are unfamiliar with the highly technical procedural steps necessary to try to 
reopen an old case, many appellate lawyers, who earn their livings by reviewing 
transcripts and writing briefs, are unfamiliar with walking into a courtroom to 
question witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
There is no tradition of close cooperation between the two types of criminal 
defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Abramson, president of the statewide defense lawyers lobbying 
organization, California Attorneys for Criminal Justice, offered yet another 
reason for the lack of response. Abramson, a trial lawyer, said she has not had 
a chance to pursue her own informant case and probably will not for some time. 
"People . . . have to decide if that's the stuff they're going to work on when 
they have tons of other stuff happening," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Uelmen, the law school dean, suggested still another reason, "the absence of 
'Mr. Green.' " "Mr. Green" is a criminal lawyer's expression meaning money. 
</P>
<P>
Money is available to pay the lawyers, although some lawyers do not know it. 
David Horowitz, the supervising judge for criminal matters in Los Angeles 
Superior Court, has said that he would appoint lawyers to represent their own 
imprisoned, and presumably impoverished, former clients at public expense. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 13 cases in which defense lawyers have taken action, eight have involved 
the filing of papers. These cases are at early stages. In the other five case, 
lawyers have asked the district attorney's office informally for additional 
information before deciding whether to file papers. 
</P>
<P>
Another dozen or so defense lawyers have indicated that they may take action. 
</P>
<P>
No convictions have been overturned. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner invited the defense attorneys to contest the cases after a veteran 
informant, Leslie Vernon White, demonstrated for his jailers in October of last 
year that he could convincingly fake another inmate's murder confession. 
</P>
<P>
White, a convicted robber and kidnaper, showed how he could feign having talked 
to an accused murderer he had never met by gathering inside information about 
the murder from law enforcement agencies. To gather the information, White used 
a jail telephone and posed as a law officer. 
</P>
<P>
His demonstration raised the possibility that he and other informants had 
perjured themselves about confessions in return for leniency in their own 
cases, and that, as a result, innocent people had been convicted. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the demonstration, the district attorney's office began 
centralizing information about White and other informants it had used. 
</P>
<P>
It quickly became apparent that the district attorney's office had been so 
disorganized that its prosecutors had not disclosed to the defense, as they 
were required to do, all the negative information the office had on informants 
it had used. 
</P>
<P>
This failure to disclose raised the possibility that some defendants had not 
gotten fair trials, in that their attorneys had not been given adequate chances 
to discredit informants in front of judges and juries. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, jailhouse informants testify that they have heard confessions from 
other inmates, in exchange for leniency in their own cases. Terms of the 
leniency were sometimes not disclosed. Nor were other cases in which the same 
informants had testified. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Frank E. Sunstedt Jr., a member of the team of prosecutors 
organized to handle litigation arising from the informant scandal, said his 
team has found a a pattern of non-disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
He said there was nothing nefarious about this. It was merely inefficiency 
related to the office's size. With 800 lawyers, the district attorney's office 
is the largest local prosecutor's office in the country. Until the informant 
scandal broke, any prosecutor had authority to use an informant and might do so 
without the knowledge that other prosecutors had also used him. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Supreme Court case on the subject, Giglio vs. the United States, 
however, says size of the prosecutors' office is no excuse for failing to 
disclose critical information to the defense. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, the court granted a convicted forger a new trial because the 
government had failed to disclose an alleged promise of leniency to a key 
witness in return for his testimony. The court said that even though the 
promise was made by one prosecutor without the knowledge of the prosecutor who 
tried the case, the prosecutors' office was at fault. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys who handled cases in which White figured as a prosecution 
witness received letters from Reiner calling attention to this sort of problem. 
</P>
<P>
The letters said the district attorney's office had learned that "at the time 
Mr. White testified as a prosecution witness . . . information existed that you 
may not have been aware of, which might adversely reflect upon Mr. White's 
credibility. As a result, you may not have been able to thoroughly develop 
evidence which might have been used to impeach the testimony of Mr. White." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys who handled cases in which other informants figured received 
letters which said that the district attorney's office did not know whether the 
informants "acquired information in a manner alluded to by Mr. White" in his 
demonstration. "However, since the courtroom is the appropriate forum in which 
to fully explore this issue, our office will join with you in expediting the 
hearing of any appropriate motion you may wish to bring." 
</P>
<P>
In the months since those letters were written, stacks of files that should 
have been disclosed to trial lawyers, but were not, have piled up at the 
district attorney's office, unexamined by defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
In apparent repudiation of its earlier promise to expedite hearings, the 
district attorney's office has fought those few defense lawyers who have filed 
motions seeking the additional information. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said that defense attorneys are welcome to look at the district 
attorney's files if they make an informal request. But prosecutors said they 
feel that they have to oppose formal requests. They said they fear establishing 
a precedent by which defense lawyers could file discovery motions in death 
penalty cases as a way of postponing executions indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers Gigi Gordon and Gerald Chaleff are the only ones who have won a 
formal discovery motion in an informant case. Gordon said that informal 
discovery would have been insufficient because the district attorney's office 
was only offering to show its own files, and not the files of other law 
enforcement agencies that might have critical information about an informant. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office, joined by the state attorney general's office 
and the county counsel's office, has appealed the trial court ruling granting 
post-conviction discovery in Gordon's case.

3 SOUTHLAND HOSPITALS FAILING THE POOR, U.S. SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SPIEGEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal health officials have accused three Los Angeles-area hospitals of not 
complying with a federal requirement that they provide health care to poor 
people insured through the state's Medi-Cal program. 
</P>
<P>
At least one hospital in Northern California has also received a notice of 
non-compliance and 17 other hospitals statewide have been targeted for further 
study but not yet contacted, health and hospital officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
The actions by officials in the Office of Civil Rights of the U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services arise from pledges these hospitals made several 
decades ago to serve the poor, in return for accepting millions of public 
health care dollars to modernize, expand or build new facilities. 
</P>
<P>
If the federal government is successful in forcing additional hospitals to open 
their doors to Medi-Cal patients, state officials said that access to health 
care for the poor would be improved and the burden of providing this care would 
be spread more evenly among hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can get some broader range of hospitals required to participate, you 
get better access for patients, and the state gets a better price," said Mike 
Murray, executive director of the California Medical Assistance Commission, 
which negotiates Medi-Cal contracts with hospitals statewide. 
</P>
<P>
At Methodist Hospital of Southern California in Arcadia, Holy Cross Hospital in 
Mission Hills and Northridge Hospital Medical Center in the San Fernando 
Valley, officials said they have been notified by federal health officials that 
they are not meeting their obligation to serve the poor, specifically because 
they are not under contract with the state of California to treat patients 
insured through the publicly funded Medi-Cal program. 
</P>
<P>
Holy Cross Hospital is now trying to negotiate a Medi-Cal contract, according 
to Dan Perritt, the hospital's chief financial officer. However, San Francisco 
attorney Steve Lipton said that both Northridge and Methodist hospitals are 
"respectfully declining" at this point to enter into negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd all be best served if we can come to an amicable, timely, reasonable 
agreement on the issues," said Virginia Apodaca, regional manager in San 
Francisco of the Office of Civil Rights. However, a stalemate may ultimately 
lead to litigation. She would not disclose the names of hospitals that have 
been served with notices of non-compliance. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, several hospital officials criticized the Office of Civil Rights 
for putting a "new twist" on their interpretation of hospital obligations set 
forth in the Hill-Burton Act -- the post-World War II legislation that 
unleashed millions of federal dollars for hospital construction programs 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation requires Hill-Burton hospitals to treat Medicare and Medicaid 
patients. In California, the Medicaid program is called Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
"Our view is that . . . the language (of the regulations) is real clear," 
Apodaca said. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy provides a glimpse at a complicated, competitive and 
confidential process by which state officials negotiate contracts with about 
270 hospitals throughout California to treat hundreds of thousands of 
low-income patients insured through the state's Medi-Cal program. Negotiations 
are private and the final rates, which are not publicly disclosed, vary from 
hospital to hospital. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, many hospital officials have complained that the rates are too 
low to cover their costs. Some hospitals, like Northridge and Holy Cross, have 
terminated their Medi-Cal contracts as a result. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Flocken, president of Northridge, said that for four years, Northridge had 
a contract with the state to provide in-patient hospitalization for Medi-Cal 
patients, but terminated the contract in 1986 "because we had not had a rate 
increase from the state in four years." 
</P>
<P>
Perritt said that Holy Cross Hospital contracted with the state since 1960 to 
treat Medi-Cal patients, but terminated the contract last July "because we 
couldn't come to an agreement" on a fair rate of reimbursement. Medi-Cal 
patients, he pointed out, can get care at other hospitals in the area. Even so, 
he said Holy Cross is trying to renegotiate a Medi-Cal contract, independent of 
any pressure from the Office of Civil Rights. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it's important for us to serve that population, but we need fair 
reimbursement," Perritt said. 
</P>
<P>
Other hospitals in Los Angeles County that received Hill-Burton funds but 
currently do not contract with the state to care for Medi-Cal patients include, 
for example, Glendale Memorial Hospital and Health Center, Queen of the Valley 
Hospital in West Covina and Torrance Memorial Hospital Medical Center. Hospital 
officials there said they have not been contacted by the Office of Civil 
Rights. 
</P>
<P>
At Torrance Memorial, Vice President Ray Allen Rahn said Medi-Cal reimbursement 
rates are so low that contracting to provide care for these patients is "a good 
way to go broke." 
</P>
<P>
He said that his hospital would be reluctant to pledge to enter into a contract

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUPERVISORS DEAL SETBACK TO BID FOR 
CITYHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The county Board of Supervisors on Thursday handed Malibu cityhood supporters a 
temporary setback, putting off until Nov. 21 the setting of an election to 
determine whether the seaside community will become an incorporated city. 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of lawyers for the county, the supervisors postponed setting a 
date for the election until next month, after the California Coastal Commission 
considers whether to approve a revised sewer plan for Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
The commission in September rejected the county's $43-million sewer plan for 
Malibu -- which many cityhood supporters opposed -- as "oversized." It is to 
consider approval of a revised plan during several days of hearings that begin 
Nov. 14.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: IMMIGRANT SENTENCED FOR RAPE OF 'BETROTHED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who claimed that he paid the Long Beach family of a 10-year-old girl to 
ensure that she would someday become his wife received a six-year term Thursday 
for raping her. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Yang, 33, a postal clerk, was convicted of rape on Oct. 6 after a two-week 
trial in Superior Court. Yang lived with the girl and her family in Long Beach 
and said he paid $9,000 for the promise that she marry him. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said Yang, a Laotian immigrant, tried unsuccessfully to use 
differences between cultures in Laos and the United States as a defense. Yang 
denied raping the girl last April. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Ken Lamb said that two days after the rape, the girl's 
mother took her to a physician and Yang told the doctor he was the victim's 
husband and that he had had sex with her. 
</P>
<P>
Although the victim recanted her accusation against Yang, Lamb presented 
medical evidence to establish that she had been sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
The victim and a 12-year-old sister are living in a foster home.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MORE WARRANTS SERVED IN PROBE OF SPORTS 
BETTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The investigation continued Thursday into illegal sports betting rings that 
Tuesday led to eight arrests in Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County sheriff's deputies on Thursday served additional search warrants 
in the case, calling it one of the largest illegal sports betting operations 
ever to operate in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Eight suspected bookmakers were arrested Tuesday night in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. Searches yielded ledgers and computerized records that Orange 
County Sheriff's Sgt. Bob Giles said appear to contain the coded identities of 
hundreds of bettors. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we're in the process of breaking down a number of codes (into) 
names and telephone numbers," Giles said. He said that bettors, as well 
bookmakers, will be prosecuted for illegal gambling when they are identified. 
</P>
<P>
The operation involved using employees of popular Orange County bars and 
restaurants as agents to take bets on professional and collegiate baseball, 
football, basketball, hockey and horse racing. Deputies financed the costs of 
their undercover investigation by placing winning bets on basketball's Los 
Angeles Lakers and baseball's Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, sheriff's detectives served search warrants on homes in Norwalk, 
Lakewood and Bellflower as well as Anaheim.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLICE SEEK INFORMATION ON ELDERLY MISSING 
MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendora police are seeking information from the public that might help them 
find an 81-year-old Glendora man who has Alzheimer's disease, and who has been 
missing since Oct. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Ulysses Sheridan Stanton wandered away from his Wabash Street home wearing a 
white straw hat with a red hat band, a pale green silk shirt with a navy blue 
neck tie, blue pants and a charcoal colored suit coat. He also had on brown 
dress shoes, said his daughter, Betty Millican. 
</P>
<P>
"He usually doesn't go anywhere by himself," Millican said. "He walked out the 
door while my mom was making him lunch. He sometimes gets confused and doesn't 
know where he is when he is in the driveway." 
</P>
<P>
Stanton usually goes by the name Stan, Millican said, but he often does not 
remember his name or his family. He is 5-feet-7, weighs 150 pounds, has white 
hair and hazel eyes. He also has burn scars on his arms, hands, lower face and 
ears, Millican said. Stanton had surgery for throat cancer a week before the 
disappearance and is supposed to be on medication, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who has seen Stanton should call the Glendora police at (818) 914-8250.

In the first second, there is a rumbling. It seems to grow. In the second and 
third seconds, the earth begins to move. Buildings, streets, cars, people, all 
are losing control. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth and fifth seconds, the earth reaches its full, angry spasm, The 
rumbling is overwhelmed by the sound of metal, of glass, desperate people 
screaming. There is the hint of gas. It is faint at first, then a insistent 
stench. In the sixth and seventh seconds, early lights of evening dim and 
falter. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth and ninth seconds, it becomes clear this is no small earthquake. 
The thought weakens the knees, dries the tongue. Now the sound is larger. Here 
and there, one can see dust. Or is it smoke? Walls are crumbling. Streets are 
buckling. Part of a bridge falls, Then a freeway cracks, begins to plunge. The 
10th second. The 11th second. Still the earth will not stop.

IT IS TUESDAY, OCT. 17, 1989. San Francisco plays host to the World Series. The 
nation is set to watch. Suddenly, with all eyes turned west, Northern 
California offers an awesome surprise. TV screens go blank. When the picture 
returns, baseball has vanished, replaced by the stuff of nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
IN A QUARTER OF A MINUTE the earthquake delivers a full ration of misery. At 
what was to have been a golden moment, a metropolis is brought to its knees. 
Beneath the broken buildings, bridges and freeways, a grim human toll awaits 
discovery. It will be days before the digging ends. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The 1906 earthquake that devastated San Francisco was later estimated by 
seismologists to have reached a magnitude of 8.3. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
San Francisco's Marina District suffered the city's greatest damage, although 
it was more than 50 miles from the earthquakes's epicenter near Santa Cruz.

The Nimitz Freeway was reinforced in 1977 in the first of a three-phase program

Delivery man Gary Watson was running on time and just half an hour or so from 
the end of another day on his new job. 
</P>
<P>
Watson, 54, was on the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland, driving his Burlington 
Express truck back to the air freight company's home office in San Leandro. He 
had a day's load of packages behind him in the truck, mostly wine he had picked 
up during his regular rounds of the vineyards in the Napa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Watson, born and reared in Vallejo, now lived in nearby Napa with his wife and 
four daughters, ages 12 to 24. He was pleased that his delivery job allowed him 
to get to know some of the local wine makers. His oldest daughter, Kristina, 
worked at one of the wineries on his route and Watson believed that he, too, 
was becoming a part of the industry that gave Napa Valley much of its identity. 
</P>
<P>
Only a month before, Watson had retired from the Mare Island Naval Base where 
he had been a civilian sheet metal worker for nearly 20 years. He liked the new 
job, being outside and covering a lot of ground, usually with the truck radio 
tuned to a 1950's music station. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Watson was on his usual route, south through Oakland to San Leandro 
on the upper deck of the Nimitz when the unusual happened. The earth shook. The 
double-deck freeway collapsed. Watson was one of the first to be pulled from 
the wreckage, but it was already too late. 
</P>
<P>
At her home in Napa, Dorrothy Watson heard nothing from her husband after he 
didn't arrive home on time. She and her children thought he was caught in 
traffic. But after hearing that the Nimitz motor way had collapsed, she called 
the Burlington Express dispatch center in San Leandro and was told that her 
husband had not turned in his truck. A few hours later, Alameda County 
authorities called to tell her that Gary Watson was dead. MICHAEL CONNELLY

Caristine Larsen, 24, is a transporter. That means she pushes gurneys. 
</P>
<P>
She had a hunch it was going to be a bad day when a 15-year-old girl seeking 
medical help drove her car through the emergency room doors at Samuel Merritt 
Hospital in Oakland, clipped a wall and skidded partway up the front hall 
before coming to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
That was before 5:04 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the earthquake. Larsen felt it. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I didn't think it was that bad, until I went up into the emergency 
room. They said it was a disaster and people would be coming in. They told me 
to get the gurneys downstairs fast. I did that and started putting mattresses 
on the sidewalk. From then on, we didn't have time to react. 
</P>
<P>
"We just had to do what had to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Patients started arriving within 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Things got hectic, even frantic. "We had to pull them out of their cars and put 
them somewhere. Depending on how bad they were, we put them on the gurneys, or 
we put them in a wheelchair, or we'd just lay them on the mattresses." 
</P>
<P>
She saw gaping wounds, severe cuts, broken bones, countless bruises. 
</P>
<P>
"The criticals would go to emergency room; the cuts to the ambulatory treatment 
center. Others just waited. We'd take them inside, try to get a name and put an 
ID on them if we could." 
</P>
<P>
Larsen talked to one woman caught on the Bay Bridge when it collapsed. She had 
jumped out of her car and fallen from the top level of the bridge to its lower 
level. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like a real fool," she told Larsen. "But I had to jump." 
</P>
<P>
Larsen says she must have handled 50 patients. She had help, from everybody who 
had a spare moment -- X-ray file clerks, security guards. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, she says, she and two helpers carried a man up three flights of 
stairs for surgery because the hospital elevator was on auxiliary power and 
they didn't trust it. Getting stuck between floors seemed possible, even 
likely. 
</P>
<P>
"People were covered in blood. There was blood everywhere. I must have gone 
through 50 pairs of gloves. It was a terrible bloody mess. I got blood on my 
uniform. I just threw it away. I didn't even try to clean it. 
</P>
<P>
"People were bringing other people in off the streets -- people they had just 
found." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, at Highland General, another large Oakland hospital, Valerie Louie, 
charge nurse in the emergency room, was wondering out loud why she had put 
herself down for a double shift. "I don't do it very often," she said. "I sure 
picked a hell of a time." 
</P>
<P>
She ended up working a quintuple, 40 hours with almost no rest. It was 5:35 
p.m. when the first earthquake victim arrived. 
</P>
<P>
She was a woman whose car had been crushed when the upper deck of the Nimitz 
Freeway pancaked onto the lower deck. Her husband had been killed. She was 
suffering severe head and neck injuries. Louis did what she could for her -- 
but soon victims from the Nimitz became a long and steady stream. 
</P>
<P>
There were skull fractures, broken bones, cuts from flying glass, crushed 
chests -- and some plain old anxiety attacks. 
</P>
<P>
There were victims who were much worse. 
</P>
<P>
Louie had no time to call in extra help. But there was no need. Off-duty nurses 
showed up by themselves. Some were volunteers from out of state, in town for 
the World Series. At one point, Louie turned to two nurses who had said they 
were from somewhere in the East. Without intended irony, she said:

"The first thing I thought was maybe we'd lost all four tires," said the 
Pacific Palisades resident. "All of a sudden, the guy driving us, the real 
estate broker, said: 'Oh, my God! We're having an earthquake!' And then it got 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
"The bridge was swaying . . . . The next thing that happened is that it began 
waving. It fanned, sort of. The cables -- the little ones that go up and down 
-- were like spaghetti. The big ones, those big fat ones, they were moving from 
side to side, six feet in either direction." 
</P>
<P>
Brake lights flared. Cars screeched to a halt, each driver trying to avoid the 
next. Across the bay in San Francisco, a huge column of dust arose from the 
collapsed buildings in the Marina District. 
</P>
<P>
On the Golden Gate, the swaying lasted 40 to 50 seconds, Collins-Gudim 
estimated, nearly three times the elapsed time of the actual quake.

"I just thought I was never going to see my kids again," she said. "I had my 
hand on the car door. If we were going to fall in the water, I didn't want to 
drown." CATHLEEN DECKER

Suddenly, Dorothy Otto found herself trapped. The top deck of the Nimitz 
Freeway had her pinned to the bottom deck. It was dark and dirty and hot. "I 
heard other people yelling and moaning for a little while," she said, "but not 
for very long." 
</P>
<P>
Otto, 43, had been heading home, nearing the Cypress exit in her Pontiac, when 
she felt the freeway heave and heard it groan. She knew right away there had 
been an earthquake. As the top deck slammed down, a chunk landed vertically on 
her car. It braced the upper deck at an angle. She thinks that is what saved 
her. 
</P>
<P>
But the earthquake wreckage held her tight. It caught her left foot. She could 
not move. 
</P>
<P>
"I politely called for help for half an hour," she said. "And then I started 
screaming. If you see pictures, you can see where the top tier is kissing the 
lower tier, and it looks like there is not much room in there. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, there isn't." 
</P>
<P>
Somebody, she doesn't know who, heard her screams. "Some wonderful rescue 
workers slaved four hours to cut me free. Those guys went into a place that I 
wouldn't go if you paid me. It was a real scary thing. I didn't think I would 
get out. I heard smashing and banging as they worked. It took four hours of 
really hard work. 
</P>
<P>
"They had to cut the door off the car. They had to cut the floor out of the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anybody's name. I wish I did. There were guys from the Oakland 
neighborhood crawling into the rubble, trying to help anyone. They were really 
putting themselves on the line. They were great." 
</P>
<P>
Otto was taken to Eden Hospital Medical Center in Oakland. "I hurt a lot, but 
I'm in great shape. I'm a very lucky lady. I guess not many people made it who 
were on the lower deck." MARIA NEWMAN

Harriet Ralston woke in the darkness of her Santa Cruz Mountains home, picked 
her way across the debris-strewn kitchen floor to the sink, searched for a 
glass and turned on the faucet. Her reward: a few drops of water. 
</P>
<P>
It had been a day and half since a powerful earthquake, centered not far from 
her Los Gatos home, had struck, and still no running water. Not to mention 
electricity or gas service. 
</P>
<P>
"All I wanted was a drink of water, and instinctively, I went to the tap," she 
said. "I was half asleep, and just plain forgot the water was out. You don't 
realize how much you take for granted." 
</P>
<P>
Ralston, most certainly, was not alone. Hundreds of thousands of Bay Area 
residents and businesses shared the loss of the most essential of services in 
the hours and days following the 15-second temblor. 
</P>
<P>
The quake left cities ringing the bay in darkness. Roughly 1 million 
residential customers lost power; in some outlying areas, it may be days before 
lights replace candles. Scores of water lines broke or ruptured, triggering a 
run on bottled water as tens of thousands of residents coped with shortages. 
</P>
<P>
Another 50,000 people were without gas service, and deliveries of oil and 
gasoline products were halted while pipelines were inspected for damage. 
</P>
<P>
It was a region living hand to mouth, anxiously waiting for the 20th Century to 
return. 
</P>
<P>
Only the telephone system seemed to escape widespread problems. Although 
several of Pacific Bell's Bay Area offices were damaged, none of the critical 
computer components or switching equipment was wrecked. Service to the 
company's 2.5 million Bay Area customers was never down -- only interrupted by 
the crush of calls from friends and relatives outside the region. 
</P>
<P>
In the first hours after the quake, an astounding 47.1 million long distance 
calls -- nearly three times the average number -- were placed to the Bay Area. 
It was an unprecedented overload that prompted phone company officials to make 
a public appeal to outsiders to stop calling the quake zone. But the 
heartstrings and worry proved too strong, and the calls kept coming. Long 
distance operators were forced to block many of the incoming calls so residents 
could call out. 
</P>
<P>
Those in the quake's strike zone found pay phones quicker and more reliable. 
News reporters, shop owners and businessmen alike waited in long lines on 
darkened street corners in San Francisco for the phones. 
</P>
<P>
"I spent 45 minutes trying to get a line out of my office," said Roger Witken, 
a stock broker who works in San Francisco's financial district. "I came down 
here, and in one try, I reached my wife in Oakland. I'm never going to curse a 
pay phone again." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike large businesses where phone calls are often routed through an in-house 
switchboard before entering the general phone network, pay phones are directly 
linked with the phone company's main equipment, said Pacific Bell spokeswoman 
Linda Bonniksen. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time a call has to go through another switch, another layer, there's a 
greater chance for delays," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Delays in restoring services are bound to be a way of life for days in the Bay 
Area, especially in outlying towns. 
</P>
<P>
By early Thursday, power was back on in most of San Francisco, except the 
fire-ravaged Marina District. Traffic signals, hotel marquees and street lamps 
returned Wednesday to brighten the night. Gone were the pedestrians who bravely 
used flashlights to direct traffic through city intersections. 
</P>
<P>
In some neighborhoods, normalcy appeared to have taken root again. 
</P>
<P>
But in towns near the quake's epicenter south of San Jose, or in the East Bay 
counties of Alameda and Contra Costa, the recovery was slow. 
</P>
<P>
About 150,000 customers of the East Bay Municipal Utility District face water 
shortages for another week because the quake ruptured a 60-inch line. The break 
has been bypassed temporarily with a smaller main, but it provides only about 
half the normal supply. 
</P>
<P>
"We are asking people to halt all car washing and garden use of water," utility 
spokeswoman Ida McClendon said. 
</P>
<P>
A major sewage-treatment plant in Santa Clara County, the Rinconda Water 
Treatment Plant, was seriously damaged and remained closed, although it posed 
no immediate health threat, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Gatos, water supplies grew critical. A pipeline leading from Lexington 
Reservoir, a major supply for nearly 30,000 people, was broken, and city 
officials urged residents to take further steps to conserve water in an area 
already affected by the third year of drought conditions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A day after the quake, 3,000 natural gas leaks had been identified and 
repaired. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The nationwide volume of long-distance calls swelled to 2 1/2 times normal 
between 8 p.m. and midnight EDT on Tuesday, to well over 40 million calls.

On Telegraph Hill, Jerry Lubenow got his biggest shock when he arrived at his 
apartment after the deadly earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no damage to our place or in our neighborhood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing Lubenow could figure out was that "Telegraph Hill is on rock." 
He then talked to friends who live on Nob Hill and Russian Hill, which are also 
situated on rock, and learned that their residences also avoided damage. 
</P>
<P>
"You almost feel guilty," he said, referring to his own good fortune. "(It's) 
like living through the blitz in London in the Second World War." 
</P>
<P>
Only a few miles away in San Francisco's affluent Marina District, dozens of 
fashionable townhouses were damaged or destroyed. Some buckled and pitched 
forward off their foundations into the street. Others appeared outwardly sound 
but sustained interior damage that rendered them uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
Why did some of the luxury, four-story apartment buildings collapse at the 
Marina while in nearby Chinatown, shops made of unreinforced masonry sustained 
little damage in the 6.9 temblor? 
</P>
<P>
Why did high-rises that form the elegant San Francisco skyline escape virtually 
unscathed while an office building in the city's southeast district peel apart, 
killing five pedestrians below? 
</P>
<P>
"The buildings that collapsed did so because of a combination of two things: 
very poor soil and very poor structural design," said Peter I. Yanev, chairman 
of EQE Engineering Inc., a structural engineering firm in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"They were on top of the worst soil conditions in the city," explained Yanev, 
who said he has traveled to "all the major earthquakes" in the last 20 years 
studying their impact on construction. 
</P>
<P>
The soil beneath the Marina District, where six buildings burned down or 
collapsed, is made up of landfill partly dredged from the bay more than 70 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Yanev said many of the buildings in the neighborhood were erected in the early 
part of this century when there were no earthquake codes. 
</P>
<P>
"What collapsed and killed some people were four-story apartment buildings that 
had garages built all the way along the bottom (floor)," Yanev said. "So, you 
have a bunch of garages underneath all these apartments. You effectively have 
no walls on one side of the building. The connections just break, and the front 
end falls into the street." 
</P>
<P>
Yanev called the two conditions a "disaster waiting to happen." 
</P>
<P>
"Should we have an earthquake centered off the Golden Gate Bridge instead of 
Santa Cruz, you'd probably have hundreds of these buildings collapse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Experts said they did not anticipate that the Marina District would be the 
major problem in an earthquake. The worst areas, they believed, would be 
Chinatown and the Tenderloin, where brick buildings abound. 
</P>
<P>
Chinatown survived relatively intact, Yanev said, because it is located "up in 
the hills" atop "very firm soil," and the epicenter of the temblor was many 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
In the city's high-rise office towers, a few broken windows and other cosmetic 
damage could be seen. A preliminary survey found only three skyscrapers 
rendered unsafe by the quake. But most buildings, including the landmark 
Transamerica Pyramid, were not touched. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Cahill, an owner of Cahill Construction Co., a contractor that built 
several high-rises in the city, said the earthquake codes "did their job." 
</P>
<P>
"What this quake proves is that the engineers were right" when they said tall 
buildings could withstand a strong quake, he said. They said the downtown 
buildings are constructed to withstand a quake of at least 8 magnitude with an 
epicenter in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Earthquake experts said they were not surprised that the high-rises swayed with 
the earthquake while four-story buildings collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
"An earthquake means that the ground shakes, and that means force is applied to 
the sides of buildings," said George C. Lee, acting director of the National 
Center for Earthquake Engineering Research at the University of Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
When architects design skyscrapers, Lee said, they factor in wind gusts and 
earth movement -- forces that are not considered as much when constructing 
smaller buildings. 
</P>
<P>
In smaller buildings, he said, contractors usually make sure that vertical 
forces -- such as snow and ice -- cannot force a structure to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the Bay Area, residents were left to puzzle over why the earthquake 
savaged some buildings and bypassed others, much like San Francisco was left to 
wonder why the Marina District was hard hit and others spared. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Cruz, initial damages were estimated at $350 million, and 30% of the 
downtown mall -- the heart of the city -- was severely damaged. An estimated 20 
commercial buildings must be razed, a county official said. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Gatos, 30 miles northeast of Santa Cruz, portions of the downtown area 
were destroyed. Several dozen Victorian homes were shifted off their 
foundations, and numerous chimneys crumbled. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco fire officials said as many as 60 buildings in the Marina 
District may have to be torn down because of structural instability caused by 
the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the buildings are extremely hazardous," Assistant Fire Chief Frank 
Blackburn said. "They are four-story buildings above garages. All they had were 
vertical columns holding up the structures. If you picture a building sitting 
on columns with no lateral support on those columns, when you get sideways 
motion, the buildings slide left and right." 
</P>
<P>
Blackburn said many residents are not going to be able to get their belongings 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"If a (big) aftershock comes, it'll collapse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buildings collapsed like cakes without yeast. One fourth-floor apartment 
dweller stepped through her window onto the street after her building crumbled 
beneath her.

The way Jim Sawyer figures it, the collapse of a 50-foot length of the Bay 
Bridge may have begun with a two-cent rivet. Sawyer has made a career of 
designing and examining bridges, and he is sure that the seismic blast from the 
earthquake snapped a row of rivets and caused a patch of concrete five lanes 
wide to give way on the top deck of the Bay Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
The falling slab pierced the traffic lanes on the lower deck, exposing daylight 
and the chilly bay waters 250 feet below. Two cars wedged by the falling debris 
teetered on the edge of the damaged roadway. Initial reports said some 
motorists jumped into the water, but the Coast Guard said there is no evidence 
of that. 
</P>
<P>
It was a staggering scene, one that framed the disaster for a nation that had 
tuned in to watch Game 3 of the World Series only to see live pictures of a 
stricken bridge. 
</P>
<P>
And Sawyer, a Tampa Bay civil engineer watching on television in Florida, could 
not help but think about the rivets that join the huge concrete panels on the 
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"It was probably a connection failure, right about where the rivets sit," 
Sawyer said. "Chances are it wouldn't happen in a hundred years. Those rivets 
are routinely inspected." 
</P>
<P>
But Sawyer and other structural experts who watched the quake's flattening 
power say it is impossible to examine each joint, each beam and each rivet. 
</P>
<P>
"Truth is you can't go over it with a microscope," Sawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
In time, Caltrans officials will eyeball, photograph, measure and note what 
happened to the failed link of the Bay Bridge and draw conclusions as to the 
cause. And they will undoubtedly ponder why the Golden Gate Bridge, the more 
glamorous of the twin spans that link San Francisco with its bayside neighbors, 
weathered the shake with little more than a superficial crack or two. 
</P>
<P>
One theory advanced by experts focuses on the inability of the Bay Bridge to 
bend or give when struck sideways by the powerful ground waves generated by the 
temblor. As evidence, the roadway collapse occurred along one of the bridge's 
most rigid sections. 
</P>
<P>
"The bridge didn't give. It broke," said one structural engineer, who requested 
anonymity because he has a contract with the state. "It was more like a stick 
that snapped than a rubber band that stretched. That jolt may have displaced 
the bridge as much as a foot before that section went." 
</P>
<P>
State highway officials have declined to speculate, saying it is too soon to 
know what caused the bridge failure. Caltrans has spent $58 million since the 
1971 Sylmar earthquake to strengthen and upgrade 1,500 bridges in quake-prone 
areas, including the Bay Area. Among the retrofitted structures was the Bay 
Bridge, where crews retied the bridge decks to column supports, Caltrans 
spokeswoman Lisa Covington said. A second $64-million phase to reinforce more 
than 700 bridge columns and supports statewide should be completed by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"Some retrofitting of the Bay Bridge has been done, but what sections had been 
worked on is unclear," Covington said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim McCarty believes the busted bridge may have had more to do with geography 
than concrete patch jobs. The Bay Bridge, built during the Depression, runs 
east and west, tying Oakland with San Francisco. When the quake hit, it sent a 
powerful ground swell north from its epicenter near Santa Cruz toward the Bay 
Bridge, said McCarty, Oakland's public works director for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
The Bay Bridge incorporates three engineering styles, with the Oakland side of 
the bridge supported by metal trusses. Unlike the Golden Gate Bridge or even 
the San Francisco side of the Bay Bridge, both of which are supported by cables 
that give when rocked by a quake, metal trusses tend to be more resistant to 
movement, McCarty said. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, when the quake's powerful groundswell broadsided the bridge, a chunk of 
the upper deck collapsed, McCarty said. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Gate Bridge, which opened a year after the Bay Bridge, was spared 
because it was perpendicular to ground motion. The Golden Gate's roadbed, 
resting in a massive sling of cables and span, swayed with the 15-second shake 
but survived intact. 
</P>
<P>
"A truss bridge is much more rigid, much less forgiving," McCarty said. "The TV 
pictures showed us that." 
</P>
<P>
The section of bridge that failed is over a pier support, and McCarty said he 
believes that the columns supporting the roadway "separated ever so slightly, 
and boom, the concrete gave way." 
</P>
<P>
Moments after it happened, Thomas Kelly was driving his camper on the bridge's 
upper deck, trying to return to San Francisco. Then, as he videotaped the 
confusion among rattled motorists around him, he witnessed a car falling 
through the crevice in the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a moment frozen in my mind," said Kelly, an Oklahoman who was vacationing 
in the Bay Area with his wife, Debbie. "One minute the car was there. The next 
it was gone. I really thought we were next. I thought the entire bridge was 
going." 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Gate remained opened, and after several closures to inspect joints 
and seams, the San Mateo Bridge was declared safe and passable for motorists 
fewer than 24 hours after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
Reopening the Bay Bridge, traveled daily by half a million motorists, is less 
certain. 
</P>
<P>
A large marine crane moved into place Thursday below the wounded structure to 
lift the downed section bridge in an attempt to assess the damage. Officials 
also considered spanning the gap with steel girders called Bailey Bridges, a 
World War II innovation to move tanks and heavy equipment across waterways. 
</P>
<P>
It is a temporary fix, at best, and one Caltrans official said rather than 
putting a "Band-Aid on the hurt, we'd like to fix it right." But that could 
mean it will be several weeks before the toll bridge is open again for 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"That bridge has done a damn good job for 50 years," said McCarty, a Bay Area 
resident for most of his life. "Until it's reopened, life just won't be the 
same."

A gasoline truck, a potential inferno in its belly, was amazingly intact, 
resting beneath a section of the Nimitz Freeway's upper level that miraculously 
stood while other parts of the roadway fell. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, a BMW sat unscathed, as shiny as a showroom special. 
</P>
<P>
These were the exceptions, the remnants of normality amid an almost 
unimaginably grotesque scene of crushed bodies, mangled steel and crumbled 
concrete. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 250 vehicles may have been trapped under the rubble. Bodies are only 
beginning to be extricated; it could be several days before the death toll is 
known. 
</P>
<P>
There was no clear pattern to the Nimitz's collapse. Some columns along the 
one-mile stretch crumbled where they supported the freeway's upper level, about 
60 feet above Cypress Street; others broke off closer to the first level or to 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Cademartori, a businessman who was at work next to the freeway, said the 
earthquake that "shook you like God was coming" leveled the Nimitz "like a sand 
castle." 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't just being descriptive. The Nimitz was built atop mud and 
water-saturated soil that can shake like Jell-O in an earthquake, intensifying 
the temblor's wave -- a key factor in its collapse. Its columns were 
constructed of "nonductile" concrete, a pre-1971 technology that leaves pillars 
too brittle to withstand much lateral sway. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a well-known type of hazardous construction," said Fred Turner, a staff 
structural engineer for the California Seismic Safety Commission. 
</P>
<P>
While the Nimitz's double-deck height probably contributed to its instability, 
other double-decked freeways in the Bay Area, such as the Embarcadero in San 
Francisco, withstood the earthquake because they were newer and built on more 
solid ground, engineers said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, while the dangers of the Nimitz were known, engineers were stunned by 
the magnitude of the structural failure. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it might be damaged, but we did not think it would collapse," said 
William E. Schaefer, chief engineer for Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
When it was completed in 1957, the double-decked Nimitz Freeway was the pride 
of Oakland -- a forerunner of other freeways that would ring and traverse the 
city. It was a major artery to the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, and 
carried 195,000 vehicles a day. 
</P>
<P>
But as it was reduced to a graveyard, the Nimitz accented its outdated 
technology, and focused attention on an aging road system that is simply too 
expensive to fix all at once. 
</P>
<P>
"Where do you start?" wrote Ian G. Buckle, deputy director of the National 
Center for Earthquake Engineering Research at the State University of New York 
at Buffalo, in a newspaper editorial. "There are more than 13,000 bridges in 
the (California) state system. It is simply not possible to upgrade all of them 
simultaneously." 
</P>
<P>
Could it have been fixed? Some scientists say yes, if there had been a bigger 
push to correct problems that everyone knew existed. Gov. George Deukmejian, 
calling for a full inquiry into the freeway collapse, said he was "displeased 
and disappointed" to discover that not all of California's freeways are 
seismically safe -- and wondered aloud if the Nimitz's construction had been 
substandard. 
</P>
<P>
"You can tell that obviously something went wrong," Deukmejian said. 
</P>
<P>
But other engineers, from within the state and around the country, said 
California's highway engineering is already the most advanced in the nation, 
and a solution to the problems posed by aging, massive structures such as the 
Nimitz is simply unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
The Nimitz was shored up with steel cables in 1977 as part of a Caltrans effort 
to reinforce more than 1,200 bridges, overpasses and elevated road structures. 
The $58-million effort, spurred by the 1971 Sylmar earthquake, was completed 
two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
But the steel cables only help keep spans of freeway decks from slipping off 
their supports. They do not strengthen the brittle concrete columns, spaced 
about every 75 feet, which must support 500-ton sections of freeway. 
</P>
<P>
In the second phase, a $65-million project to improve structures, Caltrans 
plans to place steel wrapping around the bases of elevated freeways that are 
supported by single columns. That project, expected to run through 1992, would 
not have included the Nimitz. 
</P>
<P>
The third phase would bolster multicolumn structures such as the Nimitz and Bay 
Bridge -- but engineers at UC San Diego, where tests are being conducted, are 
still not sure what the best method of doing that would be. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans engineer Schaefer said: "We really don't have the expertise to know 
what to do."

Shovels at their sides and geophysical lust in their hearts, seismologists were 
tramping through the redwood-studded beauty of the Santa Cruz Mountains this 
week in search of answers. 
</P>
<P>
In cluttered offices, others can tap into computer networks to look at what the 
earthquake wrought. Still others were anticipating reviewing data captured by 
ground-motion detectors placed in the basements of high-rises that swayed like 
metronomes but survived. 
</P>
<P>
The geophysics research community even dispatched a seismology SWAT team to aim 
a new, smarter generation of earth monitors at the spot where the Earth 
shuddered. 
</P>
<P>
All because the 6.9-magnitude quake on the San Francisco Peninsula promises 
answers that can only be found in the rubble of yesterday's tragedies -- and 
the sooner the data can be gathered, the better. 
</P>
<P>
Learning how the rupture near Santa Cruz occurred could offer scientists the 
best clues ever on the seismic future of the millions of people who live within 
shaking distance of potentially more destructive quakes. 
</P>
<P>
The relative primitiveness of much of the earthquake monitoring network -- the 
legacy of a decade of federal budget cuts, scientists grumble -- means it will 
take weeks for much of the data to be gathered by hand. But, for men and women 
accustomed to spinning geophysical theory from a few tufts of geologic history, 
this is the chance of a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
"There's great excitement. I hate to say this is a seismologist's dream, but 
this quake is essentially what front-line seismology is all about," said Art 
Lerner-Lam, a seismologist at Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory in New 
York. "The opportunity for getting data that can really begin to address some 
of the problems (in seismology) just can't be missed." 
</P>
<P>
What some might view as morbidly detached scientific interest is actually a 
quiet conviction that meticulous studies will save lives. 
</P>
<P>
For Southern California, perhaps the biggest scientific boon from the quake is 
likely to come from the comparisons that can be made between that section of 
the San Andreas Fault and similar sections near the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first geophysicists to pack his hiking boots and go to Santa Cruz 
this week was Kerry Sieh of Caltech. In the past, Sieh has used a backhoe to 
dig up evidence that the portion of the southern San Andreas in the Mojave 
Desert moved less than adjoining sections during the last large earthquake 
there, in 1857. This is pertinent to Tuesday's quake, because a similar "slip 
deficit" had been noted in the Santa Cruz section of the San Andreas. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it was for this reason that a 1985 research paper by Christopher Scholz 
of Lamont-Doherty predicted a 6.9-magnitude earthquake would occur in the Santa 
Cruz segment because, during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the fault 
slipped only a third as much there as it did elsewhere. The two sides of the 
fault moved only about three feet past each other; in San Francisco, there was 
eight to nine feet of movement. 
</P>
<P>
Many scientists believe such "slip deficits" occur where there are slight bends 
in the fault -- as is the case just southwest of Palo Alto on the Santa Cruz 
segment, and all along the San Andreas in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
A geophysicist at USC, Egill Hauksson, was ready this week to declare the Santa 
Cruz quake as evidence buttressing Sieh's work, and as an indicator of size for 
the next big quake on the southern part of the San Andreas. 
</P>
<P>
"In my mind, what it suggests is that, when we have the great earthquake on the 
southern San Andreas, if it starts in the Coachella Valley (near Indio), maybe 
that earthquake is going to continue up into the Mojave segment and maybe all 
the way into the Cajon Pass," Hauksson said. That covers nearly 200 miles. 
</P>
<P>
The slip deficit along the southern San Andreas has been one of the reasons 
that earthquake forecasters believe there is at least a 60% chance of a quake 
of 7.5 or 8 magnitude somewhere along the southern San Andreas within the next 
30 years. The subsection considered at highest risk of a quake that size is the 
Coachella Valley segment. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Tuesday's quake lent support to these figures, contained in a July, 
1988, report that was the U.S. Geological Survey's first attempt at issuing 
formal earthquake forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the one good thing that's come out of this whole disaster is that it 
did happen where we had expected it to happen," said Stuart Nishenko of the 
National Earthquake Information Center in Colorado, one of a fledgling group of 
federal earthquake forecasters. 
</P>
<P>
"By getting these successes -- if you want to use such a morbid term for it -- 
we're slowly building up a case history so we can evaluate the methods we have 
been using. We've made the hypothesis and now we're letting nature verify that 
hypothesis," Nishenko said. 
</P>
<P>
In an office at the information center, the woman in charge of evaluating 
hazards for the Geological Survey, Kaye Shedlock, was seeing the Santa Cruz 
quake as her best chance yet to get the subtle data needed to tell residents 
why some buildings shake to pieces and others remain standing. 
</P>
<P>
Why, for instance, was the San Francisco Marina District badly damaged but the 
Embarcadero District relatively unscathed, when both are built on fill that 
vibrates like gelatin during a quake? The answers are important because the 
East Bay area along the Hayward Fault and Southern California have areas that 
could face similar shaking in a quake. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking, at this point, at subtle differences," Shedlock said. "We need 
to get in there and be able to say X percent of brick buildings on rock fell 
down, X percent of brick buildings, wood frame, steel frame. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Like other seismologists, Shedlock is acutely aware of the human tragedy that 
shadows her research. But she takes heart in just how well the hazard analysis 
and retrofitting of buildings over the last two decades worked Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Face it, this earthquake was roughly the same energy level as the one in 
Armenia," where about 25,000 people died and an entire region was leveled Dec. 
7, Shedlock said. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the fact that California had given some thought to responses to an 
earthquake and Armenia had not, the difference is graphic. Our death toll is in 
the low one hundreds. Our building loss is certainly nowhere near the almost 
complete devastation in Armenia," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her group will be searching for specific answers to cut the hazards to 
California residents and their property even further, by mapping the Bay Area 
and looking for specific damage patterns. Aiding them will be a network of 60 
strong-ground-motion detectors the state has installed in basements of 
skyscrapers and on bridges and dams in the Bay Area, she said. Unfortunately, 
the data must be gathered by hand from each machine over several days, she 
noted, and analyzing it will take even longer. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen R. McNutt, senior seismologist for the state Division of Mines and 
Geology, noted that the analysis of ground motion during the Whittier 
earthquake two years ago was only recently issued, because the analysis process 
is so time-consuming. 
</P>
<P>
The studies of Tuesday's earthquake also will mark the first use of a new 
generation of portable seismic instruments that were developed for just such 
situations, Lerner-Lam said. 
</P>
<P>
Under a National Science Foundation cooperative program, Lamont-Doherty sent a 
team to the Santa Cruz site Wednesday to install 20 portable seismographs for 
monitoring aftershocks. The machines not only are 100 times more sensitive than 
previous portable seismographs, but also formats the data for instantaneous 
analysis on portable computers in a hotel room, Lerner-Lam said. 
</P>
<P>
Such equipment is expensive, however, and its scarcity points out what 
seismologists say is the biggest problem associated with quake research: You 
get what you pay for. 
</P>
<P>
The right equipment just wasn't in place during the Santa Cruz quake to give 
scientists good, fast answers, scientists say, and they blamed the 
budget-cutting fever of the '80s. In many cases of the last several years, 
monitors of fault motion and strain had to be removed because there was no 
money to maintain them, they say. 
</P>
<P>
There also was a lack of quick information from the monitors that were in 
place, because centralized seismic systems have not been modified with computer 
hookups that would allow researchers all over the country to have instantaneous 
access to their data. 
</P>
<P>
Two small systems like that are in place at Caltech and at Harvard University, 
but they cost $100,000 each, versus roughly $3,000 for a conventional seismic 
setup, said Thomas Heaton of Geological Survey's Pasadena office. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who run the seismic instruments in the Bay Area are basically the 
U.S. Geological Survey Western Region Office (in Menlo Park), the largest 
concentration of seismologists in this country by far. And yet we find that, 
the day after the earthquake, there's really considerable lack of information 
about what happened in this quake," Heaton said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next days and weeks, geophysicists will be filling that information 
gap as best they can with the hope that the next time around the scientific 
import will outweigh the human tragedy.

TRANSPORTATION: EXPERTS WERE SHOCKED BY THE EXTENT OF DAMAGE TO THE NIMITZ 
FREEWAY AND BAY BRIDGE. AND THEY DISAGREE OVER WHAT MUST BE DONE TO PREVENT IT

It wasn't supposed to happen this way. 
</P>
<P>
When a major earthquake strikes in California, state officials expect to see 
plenty of damage. Broken water mains flooding streets. Cracked gas lines 
setting off fires. Older brick buildings crumbling to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
But freeways and bridges are supposed to stand up under the shaking, with only 
some buckling and cracking of the concrete. 
</P>
<P>
No one among the state's top road and bridge engineers thought that a major 
freeway would simply collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, a top Caltrans engineer told a press briefing in Los Angeles 
that, thanks to improvements made since the 1971 Sylmar earthquake, the state's 
highways were now essentially earthquake-proof. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel all the bridges and freeways will go through an event (an earthquake) 
without collapsing," Ray J. Zelinski, design engineer for the California 
Department of Transportation, said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Even the big one -- the catastrophic quake predicted for Southern California -- 
would not destroy an elevated roadway, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's 6.9 quake not only shattered lives and structures in the Bay Area, it 
also shattered the confidence of the state's road and bridge builders. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers, though generally an unemotional lot, admitted that they were shocked 
by what happened Tuesday. Already, there is a demand to know what went wrong 
and who is to blame. But they also admit that, so far, they can't supply the 
answers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised and very disappointed," Zelinski said of Tuesday's disastrous 
collapse of a portion of Interstate 880, the Nimitz Freeway. "We didn't think a 
total collapse was a real possibility." 
</P>
<P>
From San Diego to Eureka, millions of California motorists drive each day on 
freeway overpasses held up by concrete-and-steel columns built before 1971. 
Now, Caltrans engineers say they may face the dauntingly expensive task of 
reinforcing or even replacing the columns to prevent what happened on the 
Nimitz. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of one portion of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, though 
sure to be a haunting scene from Tuesday's quake, may not forebode a statewide 
problem. Described as a vintage 1930s-era rigid steel structure, the Bay Bridge 
is "unique," said Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago. "There is nothing else like 
it." 
</P>
<P>
More recent spans, including the Vincent Thomas Bridge in San Pedro and the San 
Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge in San Diego, were built to allow some swaying in a 
quake. Nevertheless, after engineers determine what caused the collapse on the 
Bay Bridge, they will be fanning out around the state inspecting the thousands 
of old bridges to see if renovations are required, Drago said. 
</P>
<P>
The freeway overpass problem is more pressing. While the collapse of the Nimitz 
ended any disagreements over whether the older freeway overpasses pose a danger 
during a major quake, engineers still disagree over what needs to be done. 
</P>
<P>
Zelinski of Caltrans is among those who believe that the support columns need 
to be strengthened. The steel rods holding up the columns need to be wrapped in 
steel bands so that the rods do not buckle and "explode out" during a heavy 
shake. The state has just undertaken a $64-million, four-year program to add 
such reinforcements to freeway supports. 
</P>
<P>
But others say the columns need to be made more flexible. Samuel Aroni, a 
professor at the UCLA Graduate School of Architecture, said the heavy, 
super-strong but rigid reinforced concrete structures built in the 1960s were 
not elastic enough. Unable to bend to absorb the tremendous forces generated by 
an earthquake, they fractured and collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Still, others are not sure what the proper remedy is. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, we don't have the knowledge to fix them today," Caltrans chief 
engineer William E. Schaefer said. Thousands of overpasses, such as those on 
the Santa Monica Freeway, are supported by rigid, pre-1971 columns, and the 
Nimitz disaster showed that they are vulnerable to collapse during a powerful 
temblor. 
</P>
<P>
The answer, said Schaefer, is to do more research, and that alone represents a 
major change in attitude for Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt pretty comfortable" before Tuesday's quake, Schaefer conceded, because 
of the recently completed $58-million retrofitting program begun after the 
Sylmar quake. 
</P>
<P>
After the magnitude-6.4 temblor in the north San Fernando Valley, engineers 
discovered that the roadways bounced on their support columns, leading to their 
collapse. To remedy that problem, Caltrans paid to have new steel ties added to 
hold the road girders onto their support columns. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's quake exposed an entirely different problem. The columns on the 
two-tiered Nimitz freeway simply buckled and broke. 
</P>
<P>
The Nimitz was unusual in one important sense. The state has relatively few 
double-decker freeways and none in the Los Angeles area -- although plans are 
under way to double-deck portions of the Harbor Freeway using different, newer 
techniques than were used on the Nimitz. 
</P>
<P>
But the state has hundreds, if not thousands, of freeway spans held up by rigid 
reinforced concrete columns similar to those that broke on the Nimitz on 
Tuesday. These were thought to be strong enough to withstand a major 
earthquake. That thinking was wrong, at least in the case of the Nimitz. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected damage but not total collapse," Schaefer said in an interview from 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say, however, that if state engineers did not know about the problems 
posed by the rigid construction techniques used in the 1960s, they should have 
been warned by the near-collapse of a portion of the 605 Freeway-Interstate 5 
interchange during the Whittier quake in October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Any structural engineer could see these (multi-column) structures are 
vulnerable," said Aroni of UCLA, an earthquake expert. 
</P>
<P>
"Reinforced concrete buildings of the 1960s were not designed with the 
understanding of today," he said. "I am very surprised that (Caltrans) did not 
realize they are dangerous," he said. Aroni said it is neither cheap nor easy 
to upgrade so that the structure can bend and deform elastically and snap back. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a paper clip -- you can deform it up to a point and then release it 
and it snaps back to its original shape, but if you bend too much, it will just 
stay bent and won't go back to its original shape," Aroni said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the reinforced concrete structures built in the 1960s are more brittle 
and not capable of bending without breaking, as the newer structures have been 
designed to do, he said. Steel and concrete must be put together so they have 
the ability to stretch and yield to the gigantic forces of an earthquake 
without breaking. 
</P>
<P>
State engineers realized that the support columns on older freeways could pose 
a danger during a powerful quake. They planned a renovation program that 
focused on those freeways supported by single columns. Freeway overpasses with 
column supports on both sides were seen as secure -- until Tuesday. The Nimitz 
was a multi-column overpass. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans engineers stress that it will be some time before they entirely 
understand what caused the Nimitz disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know why it collapsed. We have to find out," Schaefer said. The 
Sylmar quake proved to be an important learning experience for engineers, and 
the officials said they expect the same for the Bay Area quake. 
</P>
<P>
"This quake will teach us what we need to do now," Schaefer said.

Seismologists say the Bay Area earthquake was not the Big One they expected to 
devastate wide areas of California by the end of the century. That's still to 
come, they warn. 
</P>
<P>
But was it the economic Big One -- the disaster that, combined with congestion, 
pollution and other ills, will finally push the booming California economy off 
the cliff? 
</P>
<P>
The initial evidence suggests that the answer is no. And over the long run, 
man-made threats to growth are more likely to curtail the state's boom than 
natural forces.

<P>
Throughout the 1980s, economists have marveled at the state's economic 
strength. Its traditional industries, including defense, agriculture and 
entertainment, have remained healthy, and a flood of new businesses -- among 
them, financial services, apparel, international trade and technology -- have 
had phenomenal growth. Meanwhile, immigrants from all over the world, from 
low-wage day laborers to highly trained technocrats, have kept the California 
"growth machine" well oiled. 
</P>
<P>
For some, it has amounted to a "Don't Worry -- Be Happy" economic situation, 
with no clouds on the horizon. The Pacific Age has dawned, with California at 
the hub; virtually nothing can quickly derail the huge economic forces that set 
in motion the state's growth. 
</P>
<P>
California's economy, coupled with the fortunate accident of its geographical 
location at the crossroads of Pacific trade, has built to a critical mass -- a 
term economists use to mean that momentum has built to such a velocity that 
it's hard to imagine anything that could slam on the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
But most economists who have written such sanguine forecasts for the state have 
usually included at least a footnote warning that California's growth could, of 
course, be disrupted by the Big One. Effects of a cataclysmic disaster, such as 
an earthquake or war, can't be factored into a computer-generated economic 
forecast, the economists have said. If the region is physically devastated, all 
bets are off. 
</P>
<P>
What seems clear in the wake of the temblor in the Bay Area is that the worst 
damage was suffered by older buildings and the so-called infrastructure, most 
notably roads, bridges and public utilities. 
</P>
<P>
The physical facilities used by business -- from skyscrapers to warehouses -- 
were remarkably unscathed. Much of that is credited to the fact that business 
facilities tend to be newer buildings built under modern construction codes 
that mandate a fairly high resistance to earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone lines, the vital arteries that keep business alive in the Information 
Age, were disrupted, but not for very long. Most companies were able to 
reassure customers and employees throughout the world within hours. Pacific 
Bell credits technological improvements and experience gleaned from prior 
quakes for its quick ability to get the phones working again this time. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, over the past decade most major businesses have practiced disaster 
preparedness to reduce injuries and damage. For the most part, the plans worked 
well on Tuesday, particularly emergency power systems that kicked in to save 
computer memories and delicate high-tech equipment. 
</P>
<P>
So, will fear of physical devastation from more quakes likely prevent business 
from expanding in California? The consensus is probably not. 
</P>
<P>
"It's reassuring that the newer structures in the Bay Area withstood the quake 
so well," said Jane Pisano, executive director of Los Angeles 2000, a 
quasi-government group that has studied future trends in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Investors who put up the money to build skyscrapers and factories will be 
looking at what survived the quake, not what was destroyed, she said. "Will a 
Japanese investor rather invest now in Memphis . . . ? Probably not." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest worry that future investors may have, she adds, will be the cost to 
rebuild the infrastructure that proved so vulnerable in the Bay Area. If 
business is tapped to pay a significant share of the rebuilding costs for this 
disaster, investors may fret over the costs they may bear for rebuilding after 
future quakes in California. 
</P>
<P>
A number of experts also subscribe to the so-called "jitters" school of 
thought, which basically argues that the emotional impact of two major quakes 
in California in the past two years -- the Whittier quake occurred in October, 
1987 -- will scare away some businesses that might otherwise come to California 
and cause those here to plan any expansion outside the state. 
</P>
<P>
"It will stunt our growth," one Los Angeles banker says. "No one will ever know 
by how much, but it's certain that the fear of quakes by people living 
elsewhere will hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
In the short run, California will suffer economic harm from the quake, 
especially from an expected reduction in tourism as nervous travelers go 
elsewhere on vacation. And it's possible that, at least for awhile, the 
breathtaking run-up in California real estate prices may slow as worried 
investors hold off. 
</P>
<P>
But Southern California tourism has slowly begun to recover from a downturn in 
1988 after the Whittier earthquake, and some experts believe that over the long 
haul, California will remain a desirable tourist destination. And its 
population growth virtually dictates that real estate prices will continue to 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
Others dismiss the "jitters" notion for a different reason. They argue that two 
outside areas that perhaps have contributed the most to California's economic 
boom -- Japan, which has invested billions in California business and real 
estate, and Central America, which has supplied hundreds of thousands of 
low-wage workers for the state economy -- are both earthquake-prone themselves. 
Therefore, people in those regions are less likely to change their minds about 
California because of the Bay Area quake. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe they're more afraid in New York, but New Yorkers aren't responsible for 
our boom," said an economist at a Northern California university. 
</P>
<P>
Some, however, are less quick to dismiss the effects of the quake on 
California's economic future. The cumulative effects of the natural disaster, 
combined with growing problems of congestion, overdevelopment and pollution, 
just aren't known yet, they say. 
</P>
<P>
In such a situation, history may be the best source to help figure out what may 
happen. San Francisco rebuilt after the 1906 quake and became a greater, more 
vibrant city than before largely because economic forces, including its famed 
harbor and shipping capabilities, dictated that the city would survive. San 
Franciscans didn't walk away, like the ancient Mayans, after a natural 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Economic -- not natural -- forces have also been the overwhelming reason, 
historically, for the end of past regional booms. For example, Liverpool's 
reign as a great shipping center ended because Britain failed to keep up 
technologically and lost its position as the world's greatest sea trader. 
</P>
<P>
Some economists see forces at work in California now that could be much more 
threatening to the economy than earthquakes. The movement to control growth, 
limit the population and reduce pollution in ways that severely restrict 
industrial activity represents a conscious decision by Californians not to 
continue the amazing expansion of the last decade, they argue. 
</P>
<P>
And such an "opting out" could, in the long term, be the major reason the 
current boom will end.

A thick layer of evening fog gave more than 900 firefighters a respite in their 
battle against a stubborn brush fire that broke out two days ago at Camp 
Pendleton and had burned into Orange, Riverside and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just lying real low today," said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Delores 
Fremter. "When the winds kick up in the afternoon, we'll see where it goes." 
</P>
<P>
At mid-morning, firefighters had begun to pull out of the Riverside County 
hamlet of Rancho Carrillo, which had been threatened by the fire Thursday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze had blackened 9,200 acres of tree-studded brushlands. The fog 
prevented six air tankers and four water-dropping helicopters from operating 
during the night, but they were back in operation after sunrise today, Fremter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another fire official said the fog and humidity gave firefighters a chance to 
contain 30% of the blaze, which was burning generally northeast into the San 
Mateo Canyon Wilderness in Riverside County.

Japan, the world's largest consumer of ivory, reversed itself and agreed today 
to abide by an international ban on ivory imports, a move seen as vital to the 
effort to save the African elephant from extinction. 
</P>
<P>
Japan announced its acceptance on the last day of a two-week conference of 
CITES, the French acronym for the International Convention on Trade in 
Endangered Species. 
</P>
<P>
"Japanese observation of the ban was vital because it could never be effective 
without Japan, which accounts for around 40% of world imports of ivory," a 
CITES spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement followed a decision earlier in the day by the Japanese Cabinet 
in Tokyo. Officials said Environment Agency Director General Setsu Shiga urged 
Japan to reverse its position as a major importer in order to avoid isolation 
in the international community. 
</P>
<P>
Some conservationists estimate that numbers of African elephants have plunged 
in the last decade from about 1.3 million to 625,000.

HIGHEST HONOR AWAITS REAGAN IN JAPAN VISIT

Ronald and Nancy Reagan arrived here today on a visit for which the former 
President reportedly will receive $2 million, and the Japanese government said 
it will award him one of its highest honors. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagans arrived on a chartered TWA Boeing 747 along with 229 U.S. military 
dependents they invited to hitch a ride to the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan will receive the Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum 
for his "contribution to the maintenance and promotion of friendship between 
the United States and Japan," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Reagan has always been clear in refusing protectionism and tried his best 
to maintain the free trade system," Watanabe said. 
</P>
<P>
The only other U.S. President to receive the honor was Dwight Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagans are in Japan at the invitation of the Japanese government and the 
Fujisankei Communications Group. Fujisankei has refused to confirm reports 
Reagan will receive about $2 million for the visit, which it said will cost a 
total of about $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagans descended hand-in-hand from their plane and were met by U.S. 
Ambassador Michael Armacost and Vice Foreign Minister Naoki Tanaka. 
</P>
<P>
In short remarks on the Tarmac, Reagan said he was "delighted" to be back in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"I deeply valued the working relationships I had with Japanese leaders during 
my time in the White House," he said. "Nancy and I have a special fondness for 
the Japanese people." 
</P>
<P>
The Reagans will attend several charity events and meet Prime Minister Toshiki 
Kaifu, Emperor Akihito and other government figures during the two-day official 
part of the visit. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagans were whisked by helicopter from Tokyo to Fujisankei's Hakone 
Open-Air Museum in the forested hills near Mt. Fuji where, after a brief 
welcoming ceremony, they were to spend this evening and Saturday resting. 
</P>
<P>
It is Reagan's first major excursion since he had surgery Sept. 8 to drain 
fluid from his brain after suffering a head injury in a horseback riding 
accident this summer.

President Bush, looking stunned, said he was "deeply moved" by his grim tour of 
earthquake devastation in the Bay Area, where falling temperatures and the 
threat of rain heaped new misery today on thousands of people put out of their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
"Jesus," the President muttered as he walked beside crumbled remains of the 
Nimitz Freeway in west Oakland, where rescuers worked to remove dozens of 
bodies feared entombed. The official death toll in the quake stood at 45. 
</P>
<P>
"I am deeply moved by this," Bush said, "saddened in some ways, yet very 
stimulated by this team effort." 
</P>
<P>
Bush flew into Moffett Field south of San Francisco at mid-morning and was met 
by Gov. George Deukmejian, Sen. Pete Wilson and other officials. A helicopter 
took the entourage to Oakland, and Bush came by motorcade to the site of the 
collapsed freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Bush then flew to the Presidio, a U.S. Army post in San Francisco, to meet with 
Mayor Art Agnos and view scores of toppled homes in the Marina District. He 
flew later to Santa Cruz, the coastal city 75 miles south where the main quake 
leveled stores. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also taped a television public service announcement that sought to 
reassure Bay Area residents that help is in the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
Damage estimates topped $4 billion, which state officials said today are 
"conservative." A private economist, Frank McCormick of Bank of America in San 
Francisco, said damage is likely to reach $10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The President announced he was appointing Transportation Secretary Samuel K. 
Skinner to coordinate federal relief efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner, traveling with Bush, said, "I don't think anybody can tell you at this 
moment exactly how much is going to be needed." 
</P>
<P>
Agnos, one of three mayors accompanying the President on his tour, told Bush: 
"We need fast action. We need checks written on the spot." 
</P>
<P>
Scientists roaming the mountains that isolate Santa Cruz from the Bay Area 
pinpointed the epicenter of Tuesday's 5:04 p.m. quake, a magnitude 6.9 shocker, 
in the northeast corner of Forest of Nisene Marks State Park, said Joseph 
Cotton with the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park. 
</P>
<P>
The site is about 57 miles from San Francisco and very near the San Andreas 
Fault. Heavy damage was reported throughout Santa Cruz County, the closest 
populated area to the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
More than 700 people spent the night in Red Cross shelters in Santa Cruz, and 
about 500 camped out in a Watsonville park. As many as 4,500 people in Santa 
Cruz County may have been displaced from their homes, the state Office of 
Emergency Services said. 
</P>
<P>
Morning temperatures in the Santa Cruz area were expected to fall into the 30s 
in mountain towns where hundreds of homes were seriously damaged and rain is 
due by Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
A magnitude 3.9 aftershock, considered moderate, rumbled across the Bay Area 
and Santa Cruz County at 1:13 a.m., said Rick McKenzie at the Seismographic 
Station at the University of California at Berkeley. It was centered about 
seven miles southwest of Los Gatos. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Kristina Wraa of the Oakland police department said today that 167 people 
are still unaccounted for in Alameda County.

After a three-month investigation, the outside counsel handling the ethics case 
of Rep. Newt Gingrich, the House's No. 2 Republican leader, has found no reason 
to pursue the case, congressional sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
However, the law firm hired by the House Ethics Committee did come up with a 
list of unanswered questions that the panel's staff will pursue with Gingrich 
of Georgia before a final disposition of the case is made, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The case stems from a complaint by Rep. Bill Alexander (D-Ark.) that Gingrich 
violated House rules and federal campaign finance laws in the operation of a 
limited partnership created in 1984 to promote "Window of Opportunity," a book 
written by Gingrich and two others.

Brown University today canceled two weekend events for black students after a 
string of attacks on white and Asian students. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Ivy League school took the action to limit the number of 
non-students attending campus events during the annual Parents' Weekend, said 
Robert Reichley, vice president for university relations. 
</P>
<P>
The two canceled events are "Funk Night" and a dance sponsored by Omega Psi 
Phi, a black fraternity. 
</P>
<P>
Since late August, 22 students have been assaulted in 19 attacks. Fourteen of 
the attacks involved gangs of black youths beating white and Asian students. 
The rest were robberies. 
</P>
<P>
The school is trying to prevent non-students who may have been involved in the 
attacks from hanging around parties this weekend, Reichley said. School 
officials did not discuss their actions with minority students.

Audrey Hepburn, in Bangladesh as good-will ambassador for UNICEF, today began a 
tour of dusty, poor and crowded northern Bangladesh to tell mothers ways to 
combat disease among children. 
</P>
<P>
Hepburn, who won an Oscar for her role in "Roman Holiday," arrived Thursday for 
a six-day visit as special representative of the U.N. Children's Fund. 
</P>
<P>
"In our part of the world we know much about you by just floods and tragedies 
that struck Bangladesh. But there is also a lot about your people, your poetry 
and beauty of your country," said Hepburn, who was appointed UNICEF's good-will 
ambassador in 1981.

Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) today denied a published report that he engaged in 
sexual misconduct in the House gym and predicted that any ethics committee 
investigation of the allegation would support him. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Times reported in today's editions that the committee has 
evidence of sexual misconduct by Frank and several other members in the gym, in 
the sub-basement of the Rayburn House Office Building. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Frank called the allegations "completely untrue . . . and I am 
confident that the ethics committee will concur." 
</P>
<P>
The conservative newspaper quoted a male prostitute, Stephen Gobie, as saying 
he and Frank performed sex acts "on a couple of occasions" after hours in the 
private House gymnasium. The newspaper also said it had confirmed that Frank 
had brought "a number of young men" to the gym.

NIPPON LIFE INSURANCE TO BUY NEW YORK LANDMARK

Nippon Life Insurance, Japan's largest life insurer, agreed today to buy an 80% 
stake in the Paine Webber Building, a Midtown Manhattan landmark, for $550 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Equitable Life Assurance Society will hold the other 20% and continue to manage 
the 38-story building on the Avenue of the Americas, a Nippon Life spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The company has invested in five other buildings in the United States in 
cooperation with Equitable. It owns 20 buildings overseas, of which 18 are in 
the United States and the remaining two in Canada and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very nervous about investing in real estate in the U.S. Therefore our 
investments are mainly based on tie-ups or cooperation with real estate 
developers and life insurance companies there," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Nippon Life, which has assets of more than $156 billion, hopes the building 
will provide long-term stable returns, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Purchases of American buildings by Japanese life insurers have drawn criticism 
in the United States because the buildings have tended to be well known and 
some Americans have objected to seeing them in foreign hands. 
</P>
<P>
Big Japanese life insurance companies began to invest in U.S. real estate in 
1981 and now own nearly 50 buildings there. Nearly 90% of overseas real estate 
held by Japan's 25 life insurers is in the United States, industry sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our real estate investment in the U.S. will peak soon. To diversify risks, we 
must shift our funds to other countries," said the manager of the international 
investment department of one Japanese life insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
The big firms have now started to buy more real estate in Europe, especially 
London.

Five Western and three Soviet banks will open the first mixed capital bank in 
the Soviet Union to finance the growing number of joint ventures. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Credit Lyonnais said today that the new bank will be 60% 
owned by its Western partners and have working capital of $160 million. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Credit Lyonnais are Banca Commerciale Italiana, Bayerische Vereinsbank 
of West Germany, Creditanstalt-Bankverein of Austria and Finland's 
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, which will each have a 12% stake in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet partners include the Vneshekonombank, with 20%, and Promstroibank 
and Sberbank, each with 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Kremlin's reform drive, foreign partners in joint ventures have been 
given broad control over their projects. Many Western firms are rushing in to 
try to fill big gaps in the Soviet economy.

The head of Lloyd's of London, the world's biggest insurance organization, said 
today it was too early to tell how much the Northern California earthquake 
would cost its underwriters. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some wild figures being quoted in London, from low to high," Murray 
Lawrence told a news conference in Paris. "I don't think there's any real 
conception of the total damage." 
</P>
<P>
Insurers at the scene have estimated property damage at $3 billion to $4 
billion but the figure was expected to rise as fuller damage reports were 
compiled. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence said much of the damage was to uninsured properties and installations. 
Fisherman's Wharf, where buildings were generally of low value, suffered heavy 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these buildings are going to take a lot of inspection," Lawrence 
said. "They may look all right but some of them may have been damaged in such a 
way that it's difficult to estimate it at first sight."

<P>
Bond Corp., the flagship company of Australian tycoon Alan Bond, today 
announced the largest loss in Australian history. 
</P>
<P>
Bond Corp. said it chalked up a net loss of $610 million in the year ending 
June 30 after making a profit of $266 million in 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
Directors of the heavily indebted media, brewing and natural-resources company 
blamed recent rapid growth for the results and insisted that it remains a 
viable concern. 
</P>
<P>
"Having fully considered all aspects of the company's state of affairs and 
future cash flows the directors confirm absolutely that the company is 
solvent," the corporation said. 
</P>
<P>
Bond Corp.'s shares, avoided by larger institutions because of what they see as 
Alan Bond's unpredictability, slid to 29 cents today from a year's high of 
$1.87 in January. 
</P>
<P>
The corporation said its rapid growth over the last few years had proved its 
undoing, forcing it into a fire sale of assets totaling more than $3.5 billion 
this year.

Just four days after the Bay Area was hit by a catastrophic earthquake, the 
Washington Huskies and the California Golden Bears will meet Saturday at 
Berkeley's Memorial Stadium on the Cal campus. 
</P>
<P>
The stadium at Strawberry Canyon was not damaged by Tuesday's 6.9 quake, and UC 
Chancellor Ira Heyman announced Thursday that the Washington-Cal game was 
officially on. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal stadium was designed 15 years after San Francisco's 1906 quake and was 
built with earthquakes in mind. It was constructed in sections with expansion 
joints to withstand earth movements. 
</P>
<P>
After the quake, the location of the game had been in doubt. Mike Lude, 
Washington's athletic director, called Cal Athletic Director Dave Maggard and 
offered to move the game to Husky Stadium in Seattle.

Two Chicago businessmen have enlisted the financial backing of media executive 
Robert Wussler to buy the Denver Nuggets, with the directors of Wussler's 
company expected to vote on the deal today. 
</P>
<P>
"We are confirming that we are in discussion to purchase the Denver Nuggets as 
part of a partnership headed by Bertram Lee and Peter Bynoe," said Bob Hunter, 
spokesman for Wussler's firm, Comsat Video Enterprises of Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
"Discussion has been under way for some time and is on a fast track," Hunter 
told the Associated Press today. "It could be concluded within a matter of 
days, even hours." 
</P>
<P>
Lee and Bynoe brought Wussler into the picture to gain the monetary strength 
they had lacked when their other proposal to buy the Nuggets from owner Sidney 
Shlenker fell through last week. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase would make Lee and Bynoe the first black owners of a major league 
sports franchise, and the structure of the proposed deal calls for them to run 
the team as managing partners. 
</P>
<P>
Closing of the estimated $65 million deal was expected today in Washington, 
D.C. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter said Comsat is interested in purchasing the Nuggets "because it will 
allow us to differentiate Comsat Video Enterprises from our competition and 
allow us to capitalize on our ability to distribute live sports events.

City officials said they don't want to pay the Los Angeles Raiders $50 million 
to move to California's capital until a group of private investors provides $37 
million in guarantees that the city won't lose money on the football deal. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento Mayor Anne Rudin said Thursday she wants the investors to advance 
the first $30 million of the $50 million relocation fee offered to the Raiders. 
The city would not repay the money until a football stadium is built and the 
first game is played. 
</P>
<P>
Rudin and other Sacramento officials also want the investment group to issue 
the city a $7-million letter of credit that the city can tap if it fails to 
earn enough money from the football deal to make debt payments on a proposed 
bond issue to raise the $50-million fee. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a way to guarantee that unless the stadium is built and the first 
game played, we are not out any money," Sacramento Treasurer Thomas Friery 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, meanwhile, the president of the Coliseum Commission said today 
that Raiders owner Al Davis is strongly interested in keeping the football team 
where it is. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had several indications recently that Davis wants to stay here," said 
Richard Riordan, president of the commission that has been battling Davis on 
several fronts over renovating the stadium.
