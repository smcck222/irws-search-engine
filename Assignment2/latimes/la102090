Alaska Air Group Inc.: The Seattle-based airline reported third-quarter net 
income of $19.7 million, off 16% from the same period of last year, on revenue 
of $295.7 million, up 10%. The company said fuel prices, which almost doubled 
during the quarter, were to blame for the lower profit.

OZZY'S MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a 47-year-old Ozzy Osbourne fan, I thought I'd heard every conceivable 
criticism of his music and antics from the mean-spirited people of my 
generation who've forgotten how rock 'n' roll enriched our own lives. But now, 
with the lame excuse of bereavement over a teen suicide, they're trying to 
blame a tragedy that must have myriad causes on Ozzy's masterpiece of 
anti-booze propaganda, "Suicide Solution." 
</P>
<P>
Do they read the lyrics they're condemning? Lines like "Grab a bottle, drown 
your sorrow" and "Now you live inside a bottle; the Reaper's moving at full 
throttle" are bluntly satirical attacks on our hypocrisy about alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't Shakespeare, requiring several readings and years of contemplation 
to interpret. Any adult who can't understand this ham-fisted pop poetry must 
think that "Moby Dick" is an anti-whaling treatise and that Kafka's 
"Metamorphosis" is about bugs!

NEWSCASTER LUND'S RETURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "Back From the Ranch," Steve Weinstein's Oct. 10 article on newscaster 
Christine Lund: 
</P>
<P>
Like many other Southern Californians, I'll be welcoming the return of Lund to 
Channel 7. I remember her thorough and honest reporting . . . her ability to go 
on the scene and ask tough questions . . . her concern for fairness. 
</P>
<P>
I was eagerly reading Weinstein's interview until I saw, "Now in her 40s but 
still possessed of the white-blond hair and crisp blue eyes that once made her 
an anchor superstar. . . ." Is this what she worked so hard for? Would your 
reporter have said this about a male journalist? And what rock has he been 
living under that he thinks women in their 40s are suddenly unattractive? 
</P>
<P>
An interesting story became yet another example of trivializing a woman's 
accomplishments. Where's a good editor when you need one?

<TEXT>
<P>
George A. Scott, a radar and Navy communications pioneer who served as a 
navigator for pilot George Bush during World War II, has died. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, who died Sunday at Grossmont District Hospital in La Mesa in San Diego 
County, joined the Navy in 1925 and quickly proved adept in electronics. The 
Navy loaned Scott's services to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to 
teach radar and associated concepts. 
</P>
<P>
He later signed on for submarine service and remained in that area for 10 years 
before World War II. Scott and a friend developed a method of communication 
between submarines and surface ships during that time. The Navy later perfected 
the sub-to-ship concept and Scott was transferred to communications. 
</P>
<P>
One of his most memorable assignments was as navigator and gunner on a torpedo 
bomber piloted by now-President Bush, said Scott's wife, Frances. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the war, Scott was assigned to San Diego to supervise the 
construction of Navy communication towers. He was discharged in 1955 with the 
rank of lieutenant and immediately began working for the government on 
developing a two-man submarine. 
</P>
<P>
A few months later, he went to work for General Dynamics Astronautics, where he 
was assigned to the Atlas Missile Project. He retired in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Besides his wife of 60 years, survivors include their son, John W. Scott, of 
Merced, Calif.

BILL BOYARSKY: FARRELL'S VOTE A SMOKE SIGNAL TO BIG BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Farrell has always been a dependable pro-business vote on the Los Angeles 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
It makes political sense. The predominantly black and Latino constituents of 
his South-Central Los Angeles district, ranging from desperately poor to 
working class, are struggling in a difficult economy. Farrell, a black 
councilman, has felt they need jobs, not environmental schemes that may put 
employers out of business. 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, Farrell said no to two very big businesses, the tobacco 
industry and Los Angeles' restaurants, which employ many of his constituents. 
He voted to ban smoking in restaurants. "For me it was a significant shift," 
Farrell said later. 
</P>
<P>
In the short run, Farrell's vote didn't make much difference. The ban failed on 
a 6-6 vote, two shy of the eight needed for passage. But the switch of this 
solidly pro-business councilman was noteworthy. It can be interpreted as a sign 
-- albeit an early one -- of a political and social change in black 
neighborhoods, which are besieged by high rates of heart disease, hypertension 
and cancer, all of them linked to smoking. 
</P>
<P>
It's true there's more to the restaurant smoking ban than jobs vs. health. To 
nonsmoking Councilman Michael Woo, who voted against the measure, it's a matter 
of personal freedom. "People have an opportunity to choose where they eat out," 
he told me after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
But personal freedom wasn't the issue on Farrell's mind. It was the more 
agonizing choice of either possibly closing down restaurants where his 
constituents work and offending some major political supporters, or trusting 
his instincts in detecting a fundamental change in his district. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Farrell has been on the City Council since the mid-'70s, arriving as a 
young politician of great promise. At UCLA in the '60s, he had wanted to go 
into journalism. But newspapers weren't hiring many -- if any -- blacks in 
those days, so Farrell went into politics. 
</P>
<P>
I was impressed by his political smarts when we met while he was working in Tom 
Bradley's campaign for mayor in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Today, though, it's clear watching Farrell that the pressures of dealing with 
constituents and other council members have taken a toll. He flails at a 
variety of issues. Fascinated with global and national matters, he seems more 
interested in Africa than Slauson Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Although Farrell is famous for inconsistency, support of job-producing business 
has been a career constant. That has won him the support of lobbyists for 
builders, restaurants, oil, tobacco, construction and others with business at 
City Hall. The alliance has paid off. In fact, he told me the tobacco companies 
have been among his political supporters. 
</P>
<P>
The latest vote, he said, came as the result of a new attitude in his 
community. In part, he said, the attitude has been fostered by the U.S. 
Secretary of Health and Welfare, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, who is black. Sullivan 
has campaigned relentlessly against smoking and the cigarette advertising 
campaigns that target the black community. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a person of African-American heritage who is on a crusade on health 
issues," Farrell said, "and he's forcing us to look at those issues as never 
before." 
</P>
<P>
A letter from Sullivan was on the top of a packet of anti-smoking material 
handed out to council members before the vote by the smoking ban's author, 
Councilman Marvin Braude. 
</P>
<P>
Also included were two studies by Environmental Protection Agency scientists 
warning of secondhand smoke. For nonsmokers, they said, inhaling secondhand 
smoke is like smoking three low-tar cigarettes a day. They said it caused about 
5,000 lung cancer deaths a year in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of Sullivan and the figures did it for Farrell. 
</P>
<P>
It's true that one vote doesn't make a movement. The issue will be before the 
City Council again and Farrell will be under heavy pressure from his old 
tobacco industry pals to change. And Councilman Nate Holden, from the adjacent 
district, opposed the ban. Obviously, not all of South Los Angeles agrees with 
Farrell. 
</P>
<P>
But I think he's on the right track. All through the district, you see a new 
consciousness of health. In churches and community centers, there are posters 
advertising no-smoking clinics and classes on diet and stress control. 
Ministers promote the classes from the pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
There is an understanding, as Farrell's vote indicated, that a job isn't worth 
much without good health. And wouldn't it be something if all neighborhoods 
were free from having to choose between the two?

BEWARE, THE SILLY SEASON IS UPON US; 
</P>
<P>
HOW TO TELL THERE'S AN ELECTION COMING SOON. . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is that season when days and campaigns grow short. Something about it 
makes our politics and our politicians, well, silly. 
</P>
<P>
Herewith, then, vignettes of the week just past. No endorsement expressed or 
implied. No significance alleged -- beyond the comedic: 
</P>
<P>
ACROBATS: Dan Quayle, Vice President of the United States, came to Orange 
County Thursday and promptly endorsed the term limits contained in Prop. 140. 
That measure was written by four-time L.A. County Supervisor Pete Schabarum, 
who, along with his Latino roots, last year discovered the indispensability of 
citizen politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, the former incumbent senator from Indiana, denounced incumbency's 
pernicious advantages while standing on the Tarmac of the El Toro Marine Air 
Station, surrounded by a military band, the waiting limousines of an official 
motorcade and the television cameras that inevitably follow an incumbent vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
The principal beneficiary of Quayle's two-day swing through California was GOP 
gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson, currently an incumbent U.S. senator and 
formerly the incumbent mayor of San Diego. He also endorses Proposition 140. 
While here, Quayle raised $1.2 million for Wilson, most of which must, of 
course, have come from average people who share their antipathy toward 
"professional politicians, lobbyists and special interests." 
</P>
<P>
Hours after Quayle delivered his remarks and a few miles north, incumbent Los 
Angeles City Council member Joan Milke Flores, who is seeking to unseat 
incumbent Secretary of State March Fong Eu, appeared before the locked gates of 
Fremont Place, where her opponent's husband leases a home for the family. 
Flores was waving 10 years' worth of tax returns and challenged Eu to come out 
and do the same -- sort of mano a mano disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
FIRE-EATERS: Meanwhile, in another part of the city, Democratic attorney 
general candidate Arlo Smith was lurking in the shadow of a Lincoln Savings and 
Loan branch waving a letter signed by his opponent Dan Lungren and 15 other 
Republican congressmen. Smith, the incumbent San Francisco district attorney, 
alleged the letter was a covert attempt to obtain government secrets for 
Charles Keating, former owner of the failed thrift. The letter, which Lungren 
-- who was formerly an incumbent -- says he does not remember signing, does not 
mention Keating or Lincoln Savings. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was Dana Rohrabacher, the incumbent Republican congressman from Long 
Beach, and a fire-eating advocate of conservative "family values." A former 
associate charges that, as a young man, Rohrabacher used marijuana, hashish and 
LSD. The 43-year-old Rohrabacher refuses to confirm or deny the charge and says 
his youthful mistakes, if any, are long in the past and nobody's business. 
</P>
<P>
We rather agree, though if the allegations are true, it would be interesting to 
know whether Rohrabacher's antediluvian views on the National Endowment for the 
Arts predate his use of mind-altering drugs.

BUSY SIGNAL

<TEXT>
<P>
Last year more than 4.6 million calls were handled by the city's 911 emergency 
telephone system. But a half-million other callers were unable to reach an 
emergency operator, the result of a system whose capacity to respond has been 
overtaken by the demands made on it. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition J on the Nov. 6 ballot would provide funding to expand and 
modernize this vital emergency system. Every resident of Los Angeles will 
benefit if Proposition J is approved. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition J, which requires a two-thirds vote for passage, would impose a 
special tax on residential, business and commercial property in the city of Los 
Angeles to finance a $235-million bond issue. Proceeds from the bonds would 
modernize the Police Department's obsolete radio system, build a new 911 
dispatch center in the San Fernando Valley, move the current dispatch center to 
a new facility and increase the number of 911 operators, dispatchers and police 
radio channels. 
</P>
<P>
Expanding the capacity of the 911 dispatch center would ensure better emergency 
service on police, fire and paramedic calls. Building a second facility some 
distance from the present downtown center would also make available a backup 
system should an earthquake or some other disaster put the downtown site out of 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition J would cost the owner of a 1,500-square-foot home about $14 a year 
over the 20-year life of the special tax. That is a small cost to pay to obtain 
a more secure and responsive emergency communications system. Proposition J is 
a life-saving measure.

ENDING THE WAR IN WASHINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congress and the Bush Administration are fighting over El Salvador again, but 
in truth they are really not that far apart. Both sides want to help end El 
Salvador's civil war. Both want the fighting there to stop. Both took steps 
this week to move the process along. They ought to put their heads together and 
get their political egos out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
The most significant step was the Senate's vote to trim U.S. military aid to El 
Salvador. It was a firm message to the Salvadoran military that U.S. taxpayers 
are weary of paying for an inconclusive 10-year war that has claimed more than 
70,000 lives. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for President Bush warned that he might veto the foreign-aid bill. He 
would prefer a smaller cutback than the 50% approved by the Congress but should 
reconsider that stance. A veto could undermine a potentially significant effort 
that the State Department launched to reinvigorate the stalled peace talks in 
El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, the United States and Soviet Union called on the two sides in the 
conflict to intensify efforts to negotiate a peace agreement. The joint 
statement, issued in both Moscow and Washington, marked the first time the Cold 
War adversaries had cooperated over El Salvador. Washington wants Moscow to use 
any leverage it has left with Cuba's Fidel Castro to get him to stop pumping up 
the Salvadoran guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
The last time American and Soviet diplomats tried this approach in Central 
America, it had a salutary effect. Prior to this year's elections in Nicaragua, 
U.S. and Soviet diplomats worked out a secret agreement to trim aid to the 
warring sides there. That agreement helped calm the battlefield standoff 
between the Soviet-supported Sandinista government and the U.S.-backed Contra 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
But El Salvador isn't Nicaragua. It will take more than superpower goodwill for 
El Salvador's rabidly anti-communist military to work out its differences with 
the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. But once both sides in 
that sad, bloody war realize they can't look outside their borders for military 
aid, the better the chance they will try to bridge the political chasm that 
divides them. Continuing warfare only widens the gap.

DEVELOPMENT AT FARMERS MARKET

<TEXT>
<P>
Seldom have I read such an example of specious reasoning as that offered by 
Hilty. Why, Henry, the first half of your article almost had me in tears. 
</P>
<P>
Images of pioneer Great-Grandpa Gilmore hacking away at the soil in the 1870s, 
your happiest childhood memories running up and down the aisles, how you mourn 
the loss of our unique historic landmarks torn down by unscrupulous developers. 
The rise in popularity of these appalling anonymous shopping malls that only 
highlight the extraordinary special qualities of your very own Farmers Market 
that you list in detail. 
</P>
<P>
Then suddenly you lose me. You tell me that all these things you apparently 
care about so much are not enough in today's competitive climate and you're 
worrying about it! A word of advice, Henry. Relax. Everything's just fine as it 
is. Forget the new construction. Ignore those advisers who tell you those acres 
of surface parking are quaint reminders of the '50s, and your place isn't 
special any more. It really is.

PROS AND CONS ON NOVEMBER BALLOT MEASURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your paper is recommending a no vote on Prop. 134, the Nickel-a-Drink 
Initiative, because of what you consider flaws in the initiative. After waiting 
53 years for the perfect language to increase the tax on wine, how much longer 
do you recommend voters wait? 
</P>
<P>
If we wait, the defeat of Prop. 134 will mean that the Los Angeles County Board 
of Supervisors will be forced to cut another $22 million from a mental health 
system already near collapse. The county trauma system, itself in hemorrhage, 
will be denied $54 million in critical funding and local law enforcement will 
lose $30 million. Obviously your quest for perfect legislation carries a high 
price. 
</P>
<P>
Your concern about a pending recession and the impact of new taxes does not 
support your opposition to Prop. 134. The Nickel-a-Drink Initiative will create 
over 26,000 new jobs in law enforcement and health services, stimulate $1.66

PROPOSITIONS 136, 137 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The League of Women Voters is opposing Props. 136 and 137. 
</P>
<P>
Prop. 136 would require that all special taxes put before the voters would 
require a two-thirds vote to pass instead of a majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
In addition all cities, counties and possibly special districts would have to 
submit all increases in taxes or new tax proposals to a vote. The league 
believes this measure constitutes a serious hindrance to representative 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Prop. 136 also seeks to nullify any taxes approved by the voters in other 
measures on this ballot: namely Props. 126 and 134, dealing with alcohol taxes, 
and Prop. 133 which proposes to raise taxes for drug enforcement and education. 
While the league takes no stand on these particular measures, it does support 
decision-making by a simple majority of the voters. If Prop. 136 passes, future 
proposals to raise taxes for hospitals, libraries or pollution cleanup or for 
any purpose the voters deem worthy could fail for lack of a two-thirds vote. 
Prop. 136 is heavily financed by the liquor industry. 
</P>
<P>
Prop. 137 would require that any change with respect to the initiative and 
referendum process, no matter how minor, must be submitted to the voters. The 
league believes that this measure is unnecessary and that it would lead to more 
clutter on the ballot and more cost. The initiative and referendum process is 
already well protected in California's Constitution.

PROPOSITIONS 136, 137 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am questioning the legality of Prop. 136. How can a measure that can pass 
with as little as 50% plus one vote require a 66.7% vote to overturn it? Since 
Prop. 13 passed, there have been many measures to raise money that received a 
far greater percentage than Prop. 13 but fell short of two-thirds and thus were 
defeated. 
</P>
<P>
Is that right? 
</P>
<P>
If Prop. 136 passes and is not struck down as unconstitutional, we'll probably 
see every future proposition with the same two-thirds clause. Try to imagine 
the chaos the initiative process would be dealing with.

<TEXT>
<P>
I read with interest Peter Steinhart's column ("Giving Our Children a Break," 
Opinion, Oct. 14) advocating passage of Prop. 128, Big Green. 
</P>
<P>
I was an early supporter and financial backer of Big Green. As I considered the 
proposal more thoroughly, I sadly concluded it is a typical "deep thinkers" 
response of correcting bad behavior with bad law. It won't solve our problems. 
Ultimately, it will exacerbate them by forcing exorbitant future costs on 
society and stymie targeted efforts to deal intelligently with specific 
problems. Policy often has undiscovered consequences. Big Green would be a Big 
Mistake.

MORNING BRIEFING: SURE, HE KNOWS THE DESERT, BUT HIS TIMING ISN'T SO HOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
An 11-day race involving 114 motorcycles, 83 cars, 12 trucks and 19 ultra-light 
motorized vehicles ended in Giza, Egypt, this week. 
</P>
<P>
Or as Gayle Young of United Press International reported: "Two Frenchmen in a 
Soviet automobile thundered out of the desert to the foot of the Pyramids 
Wednesday to win Egypt's Pharaoh's Rally. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Young took nothing away from motorcyclist Doug LaPorte, a Californian who was 
the first to cross the finish line but "unknowingly failed to contact a 
checkpoint on the second day and was disqualified." 
</P>
<P>
According to UPI's desert correspondent, as LaPorte finished to the cheers of 
hundreds of rally enthusiasts and a few wayward tourists, Alexander Campbell, a 
rally organizer said: "He grew up in the California desert and he's a desert 
kind of guy. That really helps here." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who holds the record for most consecutive hitless at-bats in World 
Series play? 
</P>
<P>
So much for hype: Today's game between Wisconsin and Northwestern, both 1-4 
overall and 0-2 in the Big Ten, won't be televised locally and won't be the 
radio game of the week. 
</P>
<P>
So we'll have to trust Northwestern Coach Francis Peay, who described the 
matchup as one "between two very similar football teams and an interesting game 
from that standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
Attention, ABC and CBS: ESPN analyst Beano Cook, in an interview with College 
Football Magazine, was asked whether any team besides Notre Dame could put 
together its own contract with a television network. 
</P>
<P>
Said Cook: "No. The two biggest things in football are Notre Dame and the USC 
Song Girls, and the USC Song Girls are the only ones besides Notre Dame that 
could have their own network." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, of course: Raider defensive end Howie Long, in his foreword to Bo 
Jackson's new book, "Bo Knows Bo," writes: 
</P>
<P>
"If Bo and I were both stallions, I think I could command -- based on physical 
characteristics and past performances -- a stud fee of maybe $500,000, Bo would 
get $5 million. It's like Bo's Secretariat and I'm Mr. Ed." 
</P>
<P>
Hot seats: The University of Arizona recently went one-on-one against Lawrence 
Ollason, a federal bankruptcy judge. Guess who won. 
</P>
<P>
Ollason signed an order that an auction be held Oct. 27 to sell two pairs of 
Arizona football and basketball season tickets belonging to David Randall 
Jenkins, who filed for bankruptcy three years ago. His real estate development 
and construction firm faces criminal charges of illegal sale of securities and 
defrauding investors. Jenkins himself faces 300 fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the university's contention that it should be allowed to retain control 
of the tickets, associate athletic director Ted Kissell said the school would 
abide by Ollason's decision. 
</P>
<P>
About the auction, Kissell said: "I have a feeling that courtroom is going to 
be very crowded." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Marvin Owen of the Detroit Tigers was hitless in 31 consecutive 
at-bats in the 1934 and '35 World Series.

A SPECIAL MEMORY OF MAZEROSKI HOMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I remember where I was on Oct. 13, 1960, at 3:36 in the afternoon. I was in my 
mother's womb exactly six days to the minute from the day I was born. 
</P>
<P>
This may seem to be an astonishing accomplishment, except that my memories of 
Bill Mazeroski's home run began 10 years later at the beginning of my baseball 
"career." I was unsure about my skill and about my body due to injuries I 
suffered at the age of 4. 
</P>
<P>
So when I ran onto the field to begin my tryout, I had only one ally, my father 
and his memories of that 1960 World Series. He would describe how the New York 
Yankees were heavily favored to win against the Pirates and how these same 
Pirates went on to win the world championship. 
</P>
<P>
I made the team that year and every year after and every time I read about the 
home run or see it on TV, I get a chill about my dad reliving it for me back in 
the summer of 1970.

LAKERS PLAY TONIGHT AT FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lakers will play the Milwaukee Bucks tonight at 7:30 in the second of two 
exhibitions at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
At 4:30, the San Antonio Spurs will play the Cleveland Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
The winners will meet Sunday night, after the losers play Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers are 2-1 in the exhibition season, having split with Portland and 
beaten Maccabi Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, the Lakers cut swingmen Michael Young and Steve Bucknall, leaving 14 
players on the roster. Free-agent guard Keith Smith is rated a longshot. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 2 pick, guard Tony Smith, was slowed by his early-camp absence but is 
still expected to remain with the team. 
</P>
<P>
The competition for the 12th spot seems to be between two free-agent forwards, 
veteran Tony Brown and rookie Irving Thomas. MARK HEISLER

It's a shame about Ed O'Bannon's injury. Funny how fate is.

If he had kept his commitment to UNLV, this most likely wouldn't have happened.

With all the time he's going to have on his hands, O'Bannon might think about

EVERYONE IS COMING TO THE RAMS' DEFENSE, OR, RATHER, LACK OF IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have many questions, but Ram coaches and management don't seem to have the 
answers. 
</P>
<P>
Why don't the Rams trade a running back or a draft choice to the Redskins for 
the rights to Dexter Manley and hope the commissioner will lift his lifetime 
ban? 
</P>
<P>
I believe that the best thing that could happen is for Georgia to sell the team 
to Jerry Buss. Then the players would get paid what they are worth and be there 
at the beginning of training camp and take some of the load off the guys that 
are there and prevent injuries. 
</P>
<P>
There is another scenario. The Rams end up with the worst record in the NFL. 
They fire the coach and get the first pick in the draft. They pick the best 
defensive player. Problem is, they probably wouldn't sign him until they lose 
four out of five next year.

THERE'S LITTLE DEFENSE AGAINST THE USC BAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ears and brain can take only so much and I hope I never hear the USC band 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Having been totally annoyed in the past, I decided at Saturday's USC-Stanford 
game to try to count the number of times the Trojan Band played all or part of 
its fanfare (called "Conquest," I think). The total I got was 46 and I probably 
missed a few. 
</P>
<P>
What the USC band director forgets (or ignores) is that any mature brain begins 
to filter out the constant music. And finally it is totally tuned out or the 
trapped listener is driven wild.

JORDAN BEATS JEFFERSON, ENDS 14-GAME SLUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Damien Jackson's nine-yard touchdown pass to Malcom McCray with 6:19 to play 
gave Jordan a 24-18 victory over Jefferson Friday in a City nonconference game 
at Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, which had lost 14 consecutive games, scored on all of its second-half 
possessions to erase an 18-6 halftime deficit. The Bulldogs' last victory also 
came against Jefferson, on Oct. 28, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been struggling all season, but today we put it together," said Jackson, 
who threw three touchdown passes and ran for another score. "I think our 
program is on an upswing." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan (1-4) took a 6-0 first-quarter lead on a 67-yard touchdown pass play 
from Jackson to McCray. However, Jefferson scored 18 consecutive points behind 
tailback Tony Thomas, who finished with 103 yards in the first half, and 
fullback Marcus Johnson, who scored two one-yard touchdowns. The Democrats' 
third touchdown came on a 24-yard pass from Darrell Cooley to Emilo Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, a junior, entered the game with 735 yards rushing for the season. He 
was shut down in the second half as Jordan held him to 20 yards and took 
control with its rushing attack. 
</P>
<P>
Behind James Wheeler and Maurice Smith, who combined for 91 yards in 20 
carries, the Bulldogs outgained Jefferson in total yards, 178-87, in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
"We just keyed on (Thomas) in the second half," first-year Jordan Coach Edward 
Woody said. "He is an outstanding back, so we knew we had to keep him off the 
field with ball control." 
</P>
<P>
In its three second-half possessions, Jordan went 66 yards in six plays with 
Smith scoring on a six-yard run; 59 yards in five plays with Jackson running in 
from three yards out, and 53 yards in eight plays capped by Jackson's touchdown 
pass to McCray. 
</P>
<P>
A last-minute drive by Jefferson (2-3-1) ended at Jordan's 13-yard line.

Belmont High spotted Eagle Rock a 7-0 lead but came back to score a 16-7 
victory over the Eagles in a City Section Northern Conference game at Eagle 
Rock Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The key play for Belmont came with one minute remaining in the second quarter 
when halfback Edgar Moreno completed a 50-yard option pass to David Panameno, 
which set up John Evans' four-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
"We practice that play every day, but this is the first time we've used it," 
Belmont Coach Rob Levy said after his team improved to 2-1 in conference play 
and 4-1 overall. "We had to try it, nothing else was working." 
</P>
<P>
Belmont took a 10-7 lead after Juan Ramos kicked a 27-yard field goal three 
minutes into the third quarter and, eight minutes later, the Centenials mounted 
10-play, 66-yard scoring drive. The touchdown came on a 21-yard pass from 
Conteraras to Moreno. 
</P>
<P>
Belmont's defense dominated the second half, allowing Eagle Rock only 10 yards 
in net offense, Eagle quarterback Eddy Espinoza was sacked five times for 47 
yards in losses. MARK STRODER

READERS EXPLAIN UPROAR OVER 'SISTER MARY IGNATIUS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, the Costa Mesa City Council has revealed an alignment with 
extremist and intolerant attitudes in a blatant disregard for democracy, 
freedom of expression and the separation of church and state ("Stage Uproar 
Could Haunt Playhouse," Oct. 3). Just months after the enactment of a policy 
restricting the types of works that qualify to receive arts grants, the Costa 
Mesa Civic Playhouse comes under attack for alleged violations of the policy 
for (its) presentation of the play "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for 
You." What prompted this investigation? Once again, the unsubstantiated and 
hysterical opinion of one citizen, John Feeney, joined by his wife Ernie, who 
claim that this play was a "religious activity." 
</P>
<P>
The Feeneys' attack on the arts, free speech and diversity of thought is 
substantial. We are all affected by this crusade. The Feeneys are free to 
express their opinion, but their attitude is that only their opinion counts, 
and if members of the community have opinions other than theirs, or participate 
in activities that offend them, those are wrong. Where was the public outcry 
against the Civic Playhouse or South Coast Repertory? The Feeneys attend a play 
they know in advance will offend them, invite the "carpetbaggers for morality," 
the Eagle Forum, as their guests and proceed to fabricate an arts controversy 
because they are supposedly "offended." The fact that a theatrical production 
or a flyer "offends" the Feeneys does not mean it is offensive to the entire 
community! 
</P>
<P>
The arts community continues to be viciously attacked by the Feeneys and the 
members of the Costa Mesa City Council. Now the Feeneys and council member 
Sandra L. Genis claim to be "under harassment" from the arts community. To 
them, participation in this democracy is harassment, as they want no other 
voices to be heard. When these individuals create public hysteria, they are 
hardly seeking a dialogue about community issues. 
</P>
<P>
The Feeneys say they don't want their tax dollars used to fund anything they 
don't believe in. In reality, the Feeneys have forced our tax dollars to be 
spent on worthless investigations of organizations such as the South Coast 
Repertory Theatre and the Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse. The play "Sister Mary" is 
about fanaticism, and so is this entire episode, with the Feeneys and the City 
Council cast in leading roles. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney was correct that the play was not religious activity. This 
latest incident highlights the absurdity of the council's policy and 
underscores the fact that it should be removed immediately.

<P>
Having been in the eye of the storm, I didn't think it could get more 
frightening. I attended the Costa Mesa City Council meeting on Oct. 1 and 
discovered I was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse must not be "punished" in retaliation for the 
production of one play out of 26 seasons of art presented to meet the demand 
created by the citizens of Costa Mesa. To refuse the Playhouse funds that 
otherwise would have been granted is to castigate it for exercising a 
constitutional right to free speech. To renege on agreements the city made with 
the Playhouse regarding facilities during the weaning process from city funds 
can be viewed as nothing short of a cheap attempt to reprimand the Playhouse 
for presenting a controversial piece. 
</P>
<P>
I performed in "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You." My 11-year-old 
son also performed in the production. As some council members said of 
themselves, I am not Catholic but I am a Christian. Unlike some others of my 
faith, I am not offended by Sister Mary. Quite the contrary, I found it an 
excellent opportunity to teach my child that he must ask himself the tough 
questions about what he believes. He must never let someone "explain it all" 
for him. And when he has asked himself these questions and has drawn his own 
conclusions, when someone else challenges those beliefs he will be standing on 
solid ground. He will not feel threatened or have to resort to refusing the 
right of others to question those beliefs in order to justify his own. It was 
also an opportunity to teach him that our government supports freedom of 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
We live in a democracy. I doubt there is one of us who agrees with the city's 
use of each and every tax dollar we pay. It is the very nature of our 
government that a little of what comes out of each citizen's pocket will be put 
to use for the majority he is not a part of. I do not feel that the possible 2 
cents that may have funded a particular play -- out of the possible $2 that I, 
as a single taxpayer, doled out to support all the arts -- is a significant 
loss. The quality of living those $2 buy me and the other citizens of Costa 
Mesa is well worth the 2 cents "lost" in funding one play, one musical 
presentation, one poetic reading or one art exhibit I might find personally 
offensive. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa City Council members seem willing to throw the baby out with the 
bathwater. Censorship of the Playhouse or a complete end of funding to the arts 
seemed to be the only options they would entertain. I cannot express how 
disappointed I am in the council members who represent me in Costa Mesa, save 
Council Member (Mary) Hornbuckle. She is the only one who seems to have any 
perspective whatsoever on the funding of the arts issue. Thank you, Ms. 
Hornbuckle, for your voice of reason. I hope, as you discuss these issues with 
fellow members in the future, that you can persuade them toward your good 
judgment. 
</P>
<P>
As for me, I will continue to voice my support for unrestricted funding of the 
arts with city tax dollars. I will vehemently stand against any change in the 
city's dealings with Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse in particular. I will continue 
to teach my children to question authority and come up with their own answers. 
I will use my vote as a 23-year member of the city of Costa Mesa to keep in 
office those officials who share a respect for all others, including those who 
disagree with his or her own views.

Upset by the popularity of Christopher Durang's "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains 
It All for You," Costa Mesa City Councilman Orville Amburgey has decreed: 
"There are enough plays that we can go out there and perform that won't be 
offensive to anyone." Fine. Mr. Amburgey has decided to offer pablum and tripe 
for those few tormented souls who take offense to any thought-provoking 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Feeney with husband John, who incited this incursion and catapulted it to 
a national level, vows, "This city will never be torn apart for a religious 
issue again." However, it was the Feeneys' intrusion into the world of 
community theater that has caused the turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Councilwoman Sandra L. Genis has opined that the issue is one of 
"sponsorship, not censorship." Yet, without supplemental city funding, the 
theater will be unable to function. Is that not censorship? The City Council is 
currently debating whether or not to withhold further funding pending the 
establishment of "guidelines." Whose guidelines? The electorate's? The City 
Council's? The Feeneys'? 
</P>
<P>
Judging by the sellout of the play's run, it would seem the people have spoken. 
They don't want pretentiousness, they want substance. They don't want 
simplicity, they want stimulation. 
</P>
<P>
The current fad in this country to suppress the First Amendment's right to 
freedom of expression has been brought about by those individuals who feel it 
is their duty to protect the rest of us from what they have decided is wrong or 
bad. They want their "guidelines" established for all. 
</P>
<P>
The gross mistake made in these thought processes is that intelligent, 
rational, freethinking people do not want, nor do they need, to have someone 
else establish "guidelines" for them as to what is right or wrong. The choice 
must be left up to the individual if any semblance of personal responsibility 
is to remain. Individual thought and self-expression made this country. We 
cannot let these principles die through the misguided attempts of the 
self-appointed "right minders."

I say C.M. Jerks is right ("I Say Throw Those Grove Bums Out," Oct. 12). We 
don't want any Shakespeare plays here, attacking our value system, trying to 
reach down into the wellsprings of our being, and tap that emotional core, that 
spirit of humanity, that we have long covered up. 
</P>
<P>
It's subversive, that's what it is. A threat to our comfort and peace. Leave us 
to our manicured lawns, our well-furnished homes, our small businesses, our 
civic duties. We are proud of our well-run town. We certainly don't need this 
long-dead provincial poet from England to tell us what life is all about. We 
already know. 
</P>
<P>
I say, along with C.M. Jerks, take the plays elsewhere, to a community more in 
need.

The remains of two American soldiers killed in the last major assault of the 
Vietnam War were laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery, 19 years after 
their helicopter was shot down. Vietnam veterans hailed the return of the 
remains to the United States in July as the result of the first joint 
U.S.-Laotian search for Americans missing in action. Capt. Keith A. Brandt of 
Bellingham, Wash., and Lt. Alan B. Boffman of Norfolk, Va., crashed March 18, 
1971, while attempting to save 88 South Vietnamese infantrymen stranded in a 
thrust into Laos.

SHUTTLE DAMAGE LAID TO HUMAN ERROR

<P>
A nine-foot-long aluminum beam left inside the engine compartment of the space 
shuttle Atlantis that damaged the craft was the result of human error, 
investigators in Cape Canaveral, Fla., concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Routine worker fatigue, inexperience or scheduling were ruled out as causes of 
the mishap, officials said. The beam, part of a work platform, banged around 
inside the compartment and caused about 25 dents and dings when the shuttle was 
lifted into an upright position in an assembly room on Oct. 3. The damage was 
not expected to delay a secret military flight by Atlantis, set for around Nov. 
10.

Hurricane Nana lost its punch, and forecasters at the National Hurricane Center

stationary in the Caribbean. Nana, which is now designated as a tropical storm, 
had top winds of 70 m.p.h., but it still posed a threat to Bermuda. Nana, the 
eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, moved north-northeast at 
nearly 5 m.p.h. and was expected to turn toward the northeast today.

GATES SAYS HE WELCOMES AUDIT OF DEPARTMENT; 
</P>
<P>
POLICE: CHIEF SAYS HE WON'T BE FORCED OUT AND DEFENDS WORK OF HIS OFFICERS. 
BRADLEY ORDERS EXAMINATION THAT COULD TAKE UP TO A YEAR AND COST MORE THAN $1 
MILLION.

<P>
Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said Friday that he welcomed a thorough 
audit of the Police Department, as long as it is done by an independent 
consultant outside City Hall, and dismissed speculation that the mayor and City 
Council are seeking the audit as a prelude to removing him. 
</P>
<P>
"This chief is not going to be manipulated out of here," Gates said when asked 
at a crowded Parker Center press conference if he interpreted the audit as the 
first step in a political process to seek his ouster. 
</P>
<P>
"I will pick the time when I leave this department," Gates said. "I may have a 
big mouth, but I know how to run a major police department. And I'll leave when 
I choose to leave." 
</P>
<P>
A management audit of the Police Department, ordered by Mayor Tom Bradley on 
Friday, would be one of the most sweeping examinations of its kind, taking up 
to a year to complete at a cost that could exceed $1 million, city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said he wants the audit to determine "from top to bottom how the 
department is deploying its 1,500 new officers and what results the public has 
received for its huge investment." The Police Department has a $1-billion 
annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I welcome an audit," the chief said. "I think the Los Angeles Police 
Department is the most effective, most efficient police department in the 
country. Not because of me, but because of a management team, because of a 
spirit, because of the fine police officers in this organization. And because 
of the public that supports us over and over and over again. 
</P>
<P>
"Any kind of review of this organization would be helpful, particularly if it's 
done by an outside consulting group." 
</P>
<P>
Gates stopped short of criticizing the mayor, however, for ordering the review. 
"Tom has had his troubles," the chief said. "I've had a lot of people ask me to 
step forward and criticize the mayor. But I refuse." 
</P>
<P>
But Gates declined to detail a conversation he had Friday morning with the 
mayor, in which Bradley advised the chief that he was calling for the audit. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a conversation between the mayor and myself," Gates said. "It was a 
very agreeable conversation, and I told him if he chooses to have an audit, he 
has my full support." 
</P>
<P>
But Gates did blast Bradley's inner circle of advisers at City Hall, calling 
them "a young staff over there that has let him down." 
</P>
<P>
He took particular aim at Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani. "He's a slick-haired fella 
that sits over there as a young kid," Gates said. "I have no idea what he's 
trying to do, or if he does anything." 
</P>
<P>
And he criticized Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's comments about an increase in 
the crime rate. "He doesn't know what he's talking about," Gates said. "But 
that's not new." 
</P>
<P>
The chief saved most of his venom for The Times, and repeatedly blamed the 
newspaper for a series of recent articles that he said were "badly reported." 
</P>
<P>
He expressed his disgust for articles about his remark that casual drug users 
ought to be "taken out and shot," problems with the internal police 
disciplinary system, and recent allegations of police misconduct in the 
so-called "39th and Dalton" drug raid. 
</P>
<P>
He accused "new management" at the newspaper of using those articles to prod 
the City Council and Bradley to remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of anybody who's trying to orchestrate my departure except the 
Los Angeles Times," he said. "This has been orchestrated very cleverly by one 
newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
He said The Times did not appreciate his comments before Congress about casual 
drug users. "I don't know why they're lobbying for the casual drug users, but 
obviously they are," Gates said of the newspaper. "That might say something 
about that organization." 
</P>
<P>
Craig Turner, metropolitan editor of The Times, responded: "It is our 
responsibility to report thoroughly and accurately on the public agencies that 
serve Southern California, including the Los Angeles Police Department. We have 
done so for the last 108 years and will continue to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"Any suggestion that The Times is somehow trying to ignite a feud between the 
mayor and the chief, to orchestrate the chief's departure, or to lobby for 
casual drug users is ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani also dismissed Gates' criticisms. "Mayor Bradley makes the decisions 
around here and if Chief Gates thinks otherwise, he's kidding himself," Fabiani 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky responded to Gates' comments by saying: "As far as I'm concerned, 
this isn't about personalities, but about getting the best use of taxpayer 
dollars." 
</P>
<P>
In another development Friday, Police Commissioner Stephen D. Yslas resigned 
after more than 10 years on the five-member panel. But he maintained that his 
resignation is not related to the recent department controversies. 
</P>
<P>
"My decision to resign was completely personal," Yslas said. 
</P>
<P>
Sources at City Hall said the resignation may be the first in a series of 
changes on the commission in the coming months as Bradley attempts to gain 
tighter control over the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Gates said there was no secret about how the 1,500 new officers are being 
deployed. He said that except for a few detectives and narcotics investigators, 
and 400 recruits in the academy, the vast majority are out on beat patrols. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they had requested an accounting two months ago from the 
department and have yet to receive a response. But Gates said the report was 
sent over last week. 
</P>
<P>
At the City Council on Friday, Yaroslavsky introduced a motion calling for the 
formation of a Police Department Audit Review Committee to ensure a "thorough 
and objective process."

"It is absolutely critical that the city identify what the audit must 
encompass, how and who will be selected to perform the audit and who will 
supervise the project," Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Comrie, the city's chief administrative officer, said the scope and depth 
of the review could exceed the six-month, $1.2-million examination of the 
Department of Water and Power that produced a 585-page report earlier this 
year. That report found that the DWP failed to adequately plan for the city's 
future water needs and concluded that planning for new sources of water "should 
receive immediate attention." 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department, with 8,400 sworn officers, is one of the largest and 
most complex city departments. The management audit would be the first of its 
scope in a decade, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Gates, in welcoming the audit, said he hopes the evaluation is exhaustive and 
confirms his opinion that "a lot of things" need improvement. 
</P>
<P>
He said narcotics detectives work in cramped quarters, that 400 officers are 
crowded into the Rampart Station, and that some police helicopters have a 
dangerously high number of flight hours. 
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, he said, police are making inroads in fighting crime. He 
said burglaries have decreased by 40% over the last decade, that "homicides are 
coming down" in some areas, and that police officer response times have dropped 
from 9.2 minutes in 1986 to 6.8 minutes today. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a safe city," the chief said. "Safer than any major city in the 
country."

MOBIL, TORRANCE FACE TASK OF AGREEING ON REFINERY OVERSEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY and DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After reaching an unprecedented agreement that will permit an independent 
safety adviser to oversee operations of the Mobil Oil Refinery in Torrance, 
city and Mobil officials now face several difficult tasks, chief among them 
being finding an adviser who knows the oil industry, but is not beholden to it. 
</P>
<P>
The choice of the safety adviser, seen as crucial to enforcing the settlement 
announced Thursday, is one of several major hurdles facing the city and Mobil 
as they try to end an 18-month legal struggle over safety conditions at the oil 
refinery, city officials, environmental groups and other observers said. 
</P>
<P>
To settle the lawsuit Mobil agreed to phase out or greatly modify its use of 
hazardous hydrofluoric acid. However, some experts have questioned whether the 
technology exists -- or will exist soon enough -- to allow Mobil to commit to 
using a modified form of the toxic compound in time for the 1994 deadline set 
out in the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Some Torrance residents are skeptical that the agreement alone will guarantee 
safety at the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to keep a watchdog attitude toward them. The more regulation, the 
better," said Jim Beezhold, vice president of the Northwest Torrance Homeowners 
Assn., which represents neighbors of the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
But both city and company officials agreed that the linchpin to making the 
settlement work is finding the right safety adviser. 
</P>
<P>
The post, to be filled within two months, "is the heart of the agreement" 
between Mobil and Torrance, said City Atty. Kenneth L. Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
The city and Mobil will attempt to pick a safety adviser together. If they 
cannot, one will be selected by retired Superior Court Judge Harry V. Peetris, 
who helped negotiate the settlement and will oversee the case. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance filed suit filed in April, 1989, after a series of accidents, deaths 
and injuries at the refinery. No deaths were caused by hydrofluoric acid, but 
10 people were injured in a 1987 accident attributed to an acid overflow. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance's dilemma now will be to find a scientist or engineer who understands 
refineries, but who is not too closely linked with the industry, city officials 
and environmentalists said. 
</P>
<P>
"You run the risk of finding someone whose livelihood depends on acceptability 
within the industry," said David Roe, a senior attorney with the Environmental 
Defense Fund. "There are not a lot of public-interest, hydrofluoric-acid 
process engineers." 
</P>
<P>
Mobil is looking at a number of candidates, said Joel H. Maness, manager of the 
refinery. 
</P>
<P>
One of the safety adviser's most important tasks, both sides agreed, will be to 
judge whether Mobil will modify or discontinue its use of hydrofluoric acid. 
The settlement calls for the company to stop using the compound by Dec. 31, 
1997, unless it can find a safer form of the acid and agree to use a new 
process by December, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Hydrofluoric acid is used as a catalyst in a process called alkylation, which 
creates a high-octane gasoline component. Safety concerns about the acid have 
arisen because it vaporizes at room temperature when released, forming a 
potentially fatal ground-hugging cloud. 
</P>
<P>
Less-volatile sulfuric acid can be used in alkylation units in place of 
hydrofluoric acid. But Mobil has opposed converting on grounds that 
hydrofluoric acid is more efficient and that switching would cost $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Maness said that his company hopes within four years to develop additives that 
could make hydrofluoric acid safe by inhibiting its ability to vaporize. Mobil 
is also researching alternative octane-boosting processes that would make the 
the acid's use unnecessary, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that within four years we can complete our research process," Maness 
said. "If at the end of that period we haven't identified any other processes 
that we think are viable and feasible, sulfuric acid alkylation will be our 
only other option." 
</P>
<P>
However, at least one expert questioned whether such systems could 
realistically be discovered and developed so soon. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing that I'm aware of that will do the job now," said Ronald 
Koopman, an energy expert with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory who 
conducted industry-sponsored safety studies of hydrofluoric acid in 1986. "It 
sounds like they're going to have to work very hard to invent something." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TERMS OF SETTLEMENT The settlement of Torrance's lawsuit against Mobil Oil 
Corp. came 18 months after the city sued the oil giant in Superior Court asking 
that its Torrance refinery be declared a public nuisance and that the city be 
given the authority to regulate it. Under the settlement terms announced 
Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
Mobil must halt use of hydrofluoric acid at the refinery by Dec. 31, 1997, 
unless it can develop a safer form of the highly toxic substance and commit to 
a modified process by Dec. 31, 1994. The chemical is used as a catalyst in the 
production of high-octane unleaded gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
A safety adviser, probably an engineering consulting firm, will be selected by 
Mobil and the city. If they cannot agree, the judge overseeing the settlement 
would name a firm. 
</P>
<P>
The safety adviser will review and make recommendations about refinery safety, 
including the emergency response program, employee training, seismic safety, 
procedures for handling hazardous materials and traffic control on nearby 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
Decisions of the safety adviser would be binding on the parties unless they 
appealed within 30 days to the judge appointed to oversee the settlement, who 
would decide whether to enforce or modify the adviser's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
The safety adviser must approve of any modified hydrofluoric acid process and 
the modified chemical must not form an aerosol or dense vapor cloud on release. 
</P>
<P>
The safety adviser will report findings every three months through 1997. If the 
city decides any part of refinery operations poses an immediate threat, it can 
seek a court hearing to be held within 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The safety adviser has the right to inspect the refinery, obtain documents and 
interview Mobil employees but a Mobil representative can be present. 
</P>
<P>
The fees of the safety adviser and the judge overseeing the agreement will be 
paid by Mobil. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement expires Dec. 31, 1997, but can be extended by the court.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: IRS SEIZES PROPERTY FROM ALLEGED PORNO 
KINGPIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About $800,000 worth of artworks and other property has been seized from the 
Van Nuys home of alleged pornography kingpin Reuben Sturman to help pay off his 
$4.9-million tax bill, the Internal Revenue Service said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The property was taken Thursday from Sturman's sprawling home in the 13900 
block of Weddington Street and will be sold at a public auction to pay the back 
taxes, said Patricia Hudak, IRS assistant public affairs officer in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS has also placed a tax lien against the football-field-sized property, 
which is surrounded by a 5-foot fence. 
</P>
<P>
Sturman was convicted in Cleveland last November of violating banking 
requirements, conspiracy and tax fraud after an investigation by the IRS that 
involved proceeds from an alleged pornography distribution empire. He was 
sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined $2.46 million, but remains free on 
$1-million bail while appealing the conviction. He could not be reached for 
comment.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CAR DEALER PLEADS GUILTY TO MONEY 
LAUNDERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owner of a Los Angeles car dealership that allegedly existed to sell luxury 
cars to drug dealers has pleaded guilty to money laundering and tax charges, 
federal authorities said this week. 
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Reza Vosoughi, 32, told U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian that he 
willingly accepted drug proceeds and knew that many of the customers of his 
firm, AMS Auto Sales, were drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Vosoughi pleaded guilty to conspiring to launder money, filing false tax 
returns and failing to file the required form -- Form 8300 -- mandated by 
federal law when a business accepts more than $10,000 in cash. Vosoughi's 
prosecution was the first in Los Angeles for failure to file the form, Internal 
Revenue Service officials said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HAHN IN GOOD CONDITION AFTER BEING 
HOSPITALIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Veteran Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn was hospitalized Friday 
complaining of "chest discomfort," an aide said. He was in good condition in 
the cardiac care unit at Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn, 70, who suffered a stroke in 1987 that left him partly paralyzed, was 
taken by his county driver to the hospital "for precautionary reasons," said 
Hahn spokeswoman Lynn Sakamoto. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn missed work Monday and Tuesday complaining of flu-like symptoms, but 
briefly attended Thursday morning's board meeting. The supervisor will undergo 
tests and remain at the hospital a few days, Sakamoto said. 
</P>
<P>
Sakamoto described Hahn as alert and said that he sent word from his hospital 
bed through an aide for her to prepare a news release applauding the board vote 
Thursday to impose restrictions on wood roofs, something Hahn has long sought.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ATTORNEYS CLASH OVER LEGAL STATUS OF SCOUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An attorney for a homosexual seeking to become a Scout master argued Friday 
that the Boy Scouts of America is barred by state law from discriminating on 
the basis of sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
The Boy Scouts violated the Unruh Civil Rights Act when it refused Timothy 
Curran's request to lead a Scout troop, said attorney Jon Davidson of the 
American Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
Curran, 28, was asked to leave the Scouts in 1980 because of his homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Sally Disco heard closing arguments for the 
trial's first phase to determine whether the Scouts is a business or a 
nonprofit organization free to promote its own philosophy. If Disco rules the 
organization is a business, a second phase will begin to determine whether 
Curran was discriminated against. 
</P>
<P>
George Davidson, attorney for the Boy Scouts, told Disco that the organization 
should not be required to admit homosexuals because homosexual conduct is not 
compatible with the Scout Oath and Law.

CHALLENGER ASTRONAUT MONUMENT UNVEILED

With Buddhist blessings and bittersweet memories, a 27-foot-long replica of the 
space shuttle Challenger was unveiled in Little Tokyo on Friday in honor of 
Col. Ellison Onizuka, one of seven crew members who died in the shuttle 
explosion more than four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
One-tenth the size of the Challenger, the memorial stands in the middle of a 
plaza named after Onizuka, the first Asian-American in space. 
</P>
<P>
"With this project now fixed to the street that bears his name, all of you have 
given my husband, Ellison Onizuka, a very proud sense of permanence here in the 
City of Angels," said his widow, Lorna, before she pulled a cord unveiling the 
fiberglass model with the help of Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and several 
astronauts from the American and Japanese space programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you for remembering with me and my children and my family a man who 
gently touched our lives in very special ways and then went away," said 
Onizuka. 
</P>
<P>
So true in detail is the monument that astronaut Col. Loren Shriver quipped 
that "if we have too many more problems with (the space shuttle) Columbia and 
hydrogen leaks, we may come and ask the committee if we can borrow this shuttle 
and use it for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Money for the $250,000 memorial is being raised by the local Japanese-American 
community. The replica sits atop a black granite base with a bronze plaque, 
bearing a large relief bust of Onizuka, and an inscription in English and 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"Born and raised in a simple rural community, he walked a remarkable path that 
led from the coffee fields of Kona, Hawaii, to miles above the earth," reads 
part of the inscription. 
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated Challenger launch was the second space flight for the 39-year-old 
Onizuka. Less than two minutes after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986, the Challenger 
exploded, killing all seven aboard.

Fred L. Hartley, the outspoken oilman who built Unocal Corp. into a worldwide 
energy concern, feuded with the press and successfully fended off a takeover 
attempt by financier T. Boone Pickens Jr., died Friday afternoon in his Palos 
Verdes Estates home after a long illness. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley, a longtime Los Angeles business leader remembered as gruff and 
aggressive one moment, charming and affable the next, left his imprint on 
almost every aspect of Unocal Corp., the company he joined in 1939 as an 
engineer trainee. 
</P>

He died while the company was observing its centennial.

During his 50-year career, Hartley was credited with building Unocal from a 
local oil company into a multinational energy firm with $11.4 billion in 
revenues in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
He fueled its steady growth by plowing profits back into the company, analysts 
said. Until the fractious 1985 takeover battle with Pickens -- a battle in 
which he was credited with saving Unocal from dismemberment -- he was also 
praised for keeping the company's long-term debt level low. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley's defeat of Pickens was seen as a turning point in the merger mania of 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Hartley was a creative engineer, an executive of vision and a man of great 
integrity who led Unocal for a quarter of a century and transformed it from a 
small, regional oil company to its present position as a worldwide earth 
resources company," said Unocal Chairman Richard J. Stegemeier, Hartley's 
successor, in a statement. "He was a close friend who will be sorely missed by 
all of us who knew him and worked with him." 
</P>
<P>
David Batchelder, an adviser to T. Boone Pickens Jr. during the failed 1985 
takeover attempt, recalled that Hartley was "a very determined man. He carved 
out his path and stuck to it all the way through." 
</P>
<P>
Franklin D. Murphy, former UCLA chancellor and former chairman of Times Mirror 
Co., parent company of The Times, remembered that Hartley would rail at him 
about news coverage of Unocal one moment, then "in a few minutes after he got 
that off his chest, he'd have his arm around me and be calling me his friend." 
</P>
<P>
No details of Hartley's condition were given, but he was believed to have been 
ill for some time. He missed the company's annual meeting in April, as well as 
several board meetings and centennial celebrations, said John Imle, a Unocal 
senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley, was born in Vancouver, Canada, Jan. 16, 1917. He joined Union Oil in 
1939 as an engineer trainee and worked his way up the corporate ladder, rising 
to president and chief executive officer in 1964, and chairman of the board 10 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
One of his first tasks was presiding over the then-largest merger ever: the 
$900,000 acquisition of Pure Oil that propelled Union from a regional company 
to a national firm. 
</P>
<P>
He ran the company almost as a personal fiefdom, relying on only a handful of 
trusted advisers. "He was a fighter, and we had to prove our ideas to him all 
the time," said Sam Snyder, now Unocal's general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not single-minded. He presented to the public a single-mindedness, but 
he also used his advisers and listened to them." 
</P>
<P>
Hartley led Unocal's efforts in developing geothermal and shale oil as 
alternative energy sources. Unocal remains the largest commercial shale oil 
producer in the country with its costly project in Parachute, Colo., and the 
largest geothermal energy producer. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he feuded with environmentalists, financial analysts -- whom 
he sometimes referred to as "bums" -- and with the press. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley's distrust of the media stemmed to the Santa Barbara oil spill in 1969, 
which came from an offshore Unocal platform. Comments made to a Senate 
subcommittee on the deaths of sea gulls were widely misquoted. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley's comment, "I am always tremendously impressed at the publicity that 
the death of birds receives versus the loss of people in our country in this 
day and age," became: "I'm amazed at the publicity for the loss of a few 
birds." 
</P>
<P>
Later, during the first oil shocks of the 1970s, he unsuccessfully sued The 
Times and cartoonist Paul Conrad for a panel critical of him during the first 
oil crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley proved to be a formidable enemy to the likes of Pickens, who cast his 
eye on the then-Union Oil Co. while prowling for undervalued oil stocks. 
</P>
<P>
On Valentine's Day, 1985, Pickens' Mesa Petroleum notified the Securities and 
Exchange Commission that he had acquired 7.9% of Union Oil's stock. Pickens' 
apparent hope was to force a restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
"(Hartley) was very calm, very collected," said Snyder, one of the chief 
engineers of Unocal's defense. "He organized a group, and he said, 'We will 
fight.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hartley built his defense team from nearby, believing, Snyder said, "that if 
you got into the maelstrom with Wall Street advisers, you would play by their 
playbook and wind up the way everyone else did who plays. He wanted the venue 
in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
The battle left Unocal independent but saddled with a huge debt load: $6.1 
billion, which the company has managed to whittle down to more than $4 billion 
through asset sales, including that of its headquarters building downtown. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Hartley stepped down as chief executive and president, handing the 
reins to Stegemeier, his hand-picked successor. In 1989, Hartley resigned his 
final leadership role as chairman of the board. He remained a director and 
chairman emeritus of the company at his death. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley was a longtime participant in Los Angeles civic groups, including the 
California Institute of Technology, Southwest Museum, California Museum of 
Science and Industry, Music Center, Los Angeles Philharmonic and Huntington 
Library. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley is survived by his wife, Peggy; daughter, Marnie; son-in-law, Dan 
Gruen, and son, Fred L. Hartley Jr.

<P>
Monica Chadha, a 19-year-old student, looked up from her morning newspaper, 
which described a rash of protest suicides by Indian teen-agers, and announced 
that she was going to kill herself. 
</P>
<P>
Monica "told us she was going to burn herself to death -- just like that," her 
elder sister Sonia recalled the other day. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her, 'Monica, come on, you're joking.' And she said, 'No, it's not a 
joke. I am very serious. If all these other boys and girls can sacrifice 
themselves like this to shout down the policies of this prime minister, then I 
will sacrifice my life as well.' " 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, Monica kept her word. As her family went back to their 
breakfast and a lighthearted movie on television, she went out to the terrace, 
poured gasoline over herself, lit a match -- and turned so she could be seen by 
those, including her father, Gulshan, who were attending a nearby political 
rally against Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh. 
</P>
<P>
It took Monica Chadha 10 days to die. But as her life ebbed away Wednesday 
night, she mumbled repeatedly: "Today, I want to teach a lesson to V. P. Singh. 
I am proud of what I have done." 
</P>
<P>
Monica Chadha is just one of more than 150 middle-class Indian students and 
teen-agers who in the past month have attempted to kill themselves by 
immolation, poisoning or hanging. Nearly half have succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
All have done so with the stated purpose of protesting Prime Minister Singh's 
controversial policy of altering India's ancient Hindu caste system -- a 
"positive discrimination" order that dims the future for high-caste families 
like the Chadhas by reserving 27% more government jobs and university 
placements for India's downtrodden lower castes. 
</P>
<P>
The order has touched off mass demonstrations that rival anything seen in New 
Delhi since the assassination six years ago of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. 
Repeatedly, police have opened fire on demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
"Only V.P. Singh is responsible for my death," wrote one student, Sushil Kumar, 
before he swallowed a lethal dose of insecticide in Haryana state. And in the 
state of Punjab, Narinder Kaur hanged herself and left a note in which she 
donated her eyes to the prime minister "so that he can see better for himself 
the misery 'the report' has brought upon the student community." 
</P>
<P>
The 900-page report she referred to was drafted more than a decade ago by a 
commission headed by B. P. Mandal, a member of Parliament. Although it was 
written while Indira Gandhi was prime minister, neither she nor her son and 
successor, Rajiv Gandhi, could muster the political consensus or will to 
implement its findings. 
</P>
<P>
According to unconfirmed reports, Indira Gandhi wrote on her copy of the Mandal 
report: "If these are implemented, there will be civil war." 
</P>
<P>
Not until the renegade politician Vishwanath Pratap Singh came to power a year 
ago, at the head of a minority government promising a new political order, was 
any action taken to carry out Mandal's proposal for a quota system. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 30, Singh put the system into effect, declaring that it was time the 
upper castes surrendered some of their power and prestige to what are 
officially called "Other Backward Classes." These are the lower castes, 
estimated to number 3,743, that are officially identified in the Indian 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The quota concept is not new. For four decades, since the present constitution 
was adopted, 22.5% of all government jobs and university slots have been 
reserved for India's Untouchables, the non-caste Hindus whom Mohandas K. 
(Mahatma) Gandhi renamed harijans in his campaign to liberate them from 
centuries of oppression. 
</P>
<P>
But Singh ordered that the quotas now would apply to low-caste Hindus as well, 
a step that in effect more than doubles the number of beneficiaries. This sent 
shock waves through the emerging middle- and lower-middle classes, which are 
dominated by the three Hindu groups considered upper caste -- the Brahmins, the 
Kshatriyas and the Vaishyas. 
</P>
<P>
What is more, the new Mandal quotas came amid a rush of consumerism, 
materialism and unprecedented pressure for upward mobility in the middle class, 
which is believed to account for 20% of the population and which relies heavily 
on government placements to build their fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
Instantly, the protests began. Student leaders at New Delhi University quickly 
formed the Anti-Mandal Commission Forum and took to the streets in 
demonstrations that often ended in bloody clashes with police. And the protests 
spread rapidly to other states where the upper castes are dominant in a 
spontaneous, though largely uncoordinated, national movement. 
</P>
<P>
Few politicians were willing to take up the cause. Privately, most of Singh's 
opponents and independent analysts alike have charged that the prime minister's 
order was a blatantly political attempt to build personal support. 
</P>
<P>
They note that the lower castes affected by the quota system account for 52% of 
the Indian population, and they emphasize that Singh, now dangerously close to 
losing key coalition partners that keep his minority government in power, needs 
this power base to remain in office. 
</P>
<P>
"V. P. Singh, by these reservations, has created for himself a very large 
majority vote almost overnight," said Lokesh Chandra, a Hindu scholar who heads 
the International Academy of Indian Culture. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a political masterstroke, and if a few children have sacrificed 
themselves, what does it matter? It sounds cynical, but in reality no 
politician can speak out against the Mandal commission and survive." 
</P>
<P>
Bharat Wariavwalla, a fellow at the New Delhi-based Center for the Study of 
Developing Societies, agreed, saying: 
</P>
<P>
"For whatever reasons V. P. Singh has taken this step, and I agree they were 
probably cynical ones, the fact remains that it is the most important and 
symbolic assault on the caste system since Mahatma Gandhi staged his fast until 
death on behalf of the harijans in 1931. 
</P>
<P>
"And today, for the first time, no one -- absolutely no politician with any 
ambitions for the future -- can appear to be anything but committed to the 
reservations system in the Mandal report." 
</P>
<P>
Wariavwalla likened the quota system to the quotas for blacks that were 
introduced amid similar controversy during the civil rights campaign in the 
United States. Now, he said, Singh must take harder and more fundamental 
economic steps, such as land reform and liberalization of the private sector, 
if the move is to be more than symbolic. 
</P>
<P>
Public pressure on Singh to implement such sweeping economic reforms is not 
likely to ease in the coming months. For while the politicians have been 
silent, the increasingly vocal middle class -- students and parents -- have 
not. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first teen-age suicide attempt that ignited the students' flagging 
movement, on Sept. 19, at a rally in New Delhi. When it appeared that the 
politicians were ignoring the students, Rajiv Goswami, 19, suddenly doused 
himself with kerosene and set himself ablaze. As the flames licked around him, 
he whispered that his motive was to rekindle a movement that "would have died 
out . . . without this sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
Goswami lived, although he is still listed in critical condition in a New Delhi 
burn ward. But scores of teen-agers who followed his example have not. 
</P>
<P>
In what Indian psychologists describe as a series of copycat suicides, boys and 
girls throughout north India have joined in at a rate of two or three a day. 
</P>
<P>
Most have been upper-caste, middle-class students, but psychologists and others 
insist that the quota system is merely one small piece in a mosaic of 
frustration brought on by the wave of consumerism and capitalist ambition. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, Monica Chadha was a prime example. Her family of nine lived in 
Greater Kailash Colony, one of Delhi's most posh neighborhoods. But she and her 
sisters were crammed into the one-room tenement that doubles as her father's 
place of business. 
</P>
<P>
Monica's father, who with his parents fled Pakistan at the time of partition in 
1947, owns an antique shop that caters to the diplomatic community. And he 
dabbles in politics, serving as block chairman for the opposition Congress-I 
Party. He concedes that this takes him away from his family at times, as it did 
on the morning of his daughter's suicide. 
</P>
<P>
The Chadha family was not unfamiliar with personal tragedy compounded by 
official neglect. Two years ago, another of Gulshan's daughters, 7-year-old 
Sulekha, was run down and killed by a government bus. The eldest Chadha 
daughter, Sonia, was injured in the accident, and she wrote a letter of 
complaint to then-Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. 
</P>
<P>
"I never did receive a reply," Sonia said during the interview this week. 
</P>
<P>
She said she shared with her sister Monica a growing sense of frustration in 
being unable to affect a system that appears increasingly stacked against them. 
</P>
<P>
"Before she set herself on fire," Sonia said, "Monica kept talking about this 
girl who had just killed herself in Haryana, saying if she could sacrifice her 
life to change things, so could Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her that I agreed with what she was saying, but that it was wrong. 'Why 
burn yourself?' I kept asking her. 'You're just hurting yourself.' There have 
been so many of these burnings, and they've made no difference to V.P. Singh at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
Her parents interrupted, presenting dozens of newspaper clippings that 
mentioned their daughter's suicide prominently. 
</P>
<P>
"You see, these children look at their future and all they see is darkness," 
Gulshan, the father, said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's education that's important," Malti, the mother, added. "It's the only way 
to survive in India, and this is what V.P. Singh is taking away from us." 
</P>
<P>
Sonia, 20, listened quietly for nearly an hour, then picked up where she had 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"Even after Monica burned herself, she was talking," she said softly. "I was 
with her in the hospital every day. And she did not feel she had done a wrong 
thing. She kept remembering the girl from Haryana, saying, 'Sister, do not cry. 
I have donated my life, and you donated yours.' 
</P>
<P>
"Then she turned to me and told me, 'Sister, don't be angry. I have done this 
because, inside my heart, something said I should donate my life, that somehow 
it will mean something now. And now, I'm proud of myself.' "

BIRDS KILLED TO BOLSTER SUIT AGAINST EXXON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Government officials have quietly ordered the killing of hundreds of birds, 
some seals and perhaps other mammals for studies that could strengthen their 
court case against Exxon Corp. for the 1989 oil spill in Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
The public reaction, though, is starting to be heard, and it is anything but 
quiet. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. reacted Friday to 
disclosure of the bird kills with astonishment, "like most Americans, and asked 
why." 
</P>
<P>
"Pretty incredible isn't it?" said Lujan spokesman Steve Goldstein, in 
Washington, D.C. "The secretary did not know of this in advance and would not 
have approved it if he did." 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials in Anchorage confirmed that they had authorized the killing 
of birds for at least eight different studies in an attempt to more accurately 
determine how many animals were killed by the oil spill. The bird carcasses, 
some of them oiled to simulate the spill, were then tossed into Prince William 
Sound and tracked. 
</P>
<P>
In one study this year, 250 or more birds were shot. In the others, federal 
officials indicated, the numbers were somewhat lower -- a few dozen for each 
study. 
</P>
<P>
That means the number of birds killed under government contract was half or 
more of the 797 injured birds found alive, cleaned of oil and released by a 
legion of rescue workers in the immediate aftermath of the grounding of the 
tanker Exxon Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the rescue, however, which was publicized in heart-tugging accounts 
around the world, the killings were undertaken in secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the state of Alaska confirmed that it, too, "collected some animals" 
in preparation for a damage suit against Exxon. But a state official said 
lawyers in the case ordered on Friday that no specifics be released until the 
legal implications are studied. All that is known is a previously disclosed 
kill of 10 harbor seals, including three pups, in Prince William Sound in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to seals, federal authorities said that the state of Alaska may 
have killed river otters, deer and other mammals as well as an unknown number 
of sea ducks as it builds a scientific foundation for its impending litigation. 
</P>
<P>
News of the animal killing started emerging this week after some digging 
through contract paperwork in Washington, D.C., by a reporter from the 
Anchorage Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan was not alone in expressing alarm at the notion of killing birds to add 
to the evidence against Exxon. Cleveland Amory of the Fund for Animals, reached 
in Tucson, Ariz., denounced the shootings as "the most asinine plan I have ever 
heard of. And I mean no put-down of donkeys." 
</P>
<P>
Exxon spokesman Karsten Rodvik in Anchorage noted that the company figures it 
spent $25 million trying to rescue sea birds after the spill. As for the 
killing, he said: "We think they could have found alternatives that would not 
have resulted in the destruction of wildlife." 
</P>
<P>
Bird Study No. 1, as it was called, is apparently the largest of the bird kills 
and the only one about which details have been released. It was sought by 
lawyers from the Department of Justice, who believed the government lacked 
precise enough information about the number of cormorants, scoters, murres and 
other species killed by the nearly 11 million gallons of oil that burst from 
the tanker in America's worst oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
So, the Interior Department's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, apparently 
reluctantly, approved a $600,000 contract with an ecological research company 
from Portland, Ore. The company was authorized to shoot up to 350 sea birds, 
but Fish and Wildlife spokesman Bruce Batten said the actual number killed was 
about two-thirds that number. 
</P>
<P>
Government lawyers and scientists have on hand as evidence the frozen carcasses 
of 36,471 dead birds recovered from the oil. But officials said these were not 
adequate for the kind of research the lawyers wanted. 
</P>
<P>
According to federal officials, the contract killing in Bird Study No. 1 
occurred this summer on various islands, including, ironically, national 
wildlife refuges. The coast of Alaska is summer home to more sea birds than all 
other places on the planet combined, according to the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
By tracking the movement of the bodies through the water, the study sought to 
devise a formula for determining how many birds may have succumbed to the 
effects of oil. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the Fish and Wildlife Service said it could only estimate bird 
casualties at 90,000 to 270,000. Justice Department lawyers said they found 
that estimate too vague. 
</P>
<P>
Batten said the contract shooting was undertaken despite some internal 
disagreement within the Fish and Wildlife Service. "We don't normally go out 
and kill animals to make a point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But the lawyers thought this was important . . . . It's a government case, 
and, as a government entity, it's our responsibility to support that case. In 
theory, at least, the damages collected will go to restoration of those (bird) 
populations in the future. And the better the case, the higher the damages." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Bird Study No. 1, Batten said he had been informed that birds 
were killed in two other studies this year and five in 1989. Each case involved 
a couple of dozen birds.

ILLICIT TRADING IN ENDANGERED SPECIES FLOURISHES IN THAILAND. LEGAL LOOPHOLES

BANGKOK, Thailand 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When security guards passed the suitcase on Thai International's Sunday night 
flight to Paris through a routine X-ray check, they were astounded to see the 
images of three tiny bodies moving inside. 
</P>
<P>
When the suitcase was opened, customs officials found three rare apes known as 
gibbons, renowned for their eerie resemblance to small humans. The gibbons had 
been wedged into a cardboard box so that they could barely move, then wrapped 
in a towel and stuffed into the suitcase for the 13-hour flight to France. 
</P>
<P>
The smuggling incident at Bangkok's Don Muang Airport on Oct. 7 provided fresh 
evidence that Thailand remains a wildlife supermarket, the world center for an 
illicit trade in endangered species of animals ranging from the orangutans of 
Indonesia to the crocodile-like caimans of South America. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to serving as an international transit center to "launder" 
illegally obtained wildlife, Bangkok is home to dealers who now control a 
growing trade in wildlife poached in the countries of Indochina -- Laos, 
Vietnam and Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
One enterprising Bangkok dealer has even created a fictitious zoo using a post 
office box in Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, giving the impression of 
legality to help market everything from parrots to camels. 
</P>
<P>
"Principally because of its poor enforcement (of international regulations), 
Thailand has now taken over from Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore as the favored 
destination in Asia of much illegal wildlife trade," said a recent report by 
the World Wide Fund for Nature. "It is regularly used as a laundering point for 
wildlife to enter Europe and other countries in Asia." 
</P>
<P>
There is a huge demand in America for rare parrots and dangerous snakes. 
Collectors in Japan and elsewhere in Asia seek rare monkeys, such as Vietnam's 
douc langur, as exotic pets. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign and Thai conservationists blame the problem largely on a lack of Thai 
laws to protect animals that are not native to Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Thai government ratified the 1973 Convention on International 
Trade in Endangered Species, which sharply restricts imports and exports of 
animals at risk of extinction, it has never adopted laws to provide 
enforcement. Five attempts by the Wildlife Department to get legislation passed 
by Parliament have failed. 
</P>
<P>
Illegally imported animals are "laundered," or made to appear legal, in several 
ways. The simplest is to obtain forged documents certifying that the animals 
can be legally exported, such as for research purposes. Another method used by 
dealers is to take animals to the Laotian capital of Vientiane, just across the 
Thai border, obtain legal documents from the Laotian government, which has not 
signed the endangered species pact, and then import them back into Thailand 
legally. The same is true of Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
One other popular method of laundering, according to wildlife experts, is to 
describe animals being shipped out as something different than what they are. 
Dealers will obtain clearance for a shipment of parakeets, for example, and 
then ship rare parrots. One dealer shipped rare birds to the United States 
marked "Danger: Spitting Cobras," but the package was nonetheless opened by an 
intrepid U.S. Customs agent. 
</P>
<P>
Even with native species, the Thai government has a spotty record of 
enforcement. According to Boonlerd Angsirijinda, chief wildlife enforcement 
officer in the Forestry Department, customs officials at the airport took no 
action against the passenger who was attempting to smuggle out the three 
gibbons, which are now suffering from double pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
"If you confess, there is no penalty," Boonlerd said of tourists caught at the 
airport. "You have to give up the animals, but you can leave the country." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, traders caught in Thailand by the police routinely receive suspended 
jail sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the influx of foreign tourists in recent years, traders have begun 
using airports at Chiang Mai in the north and Phuket in the south to smuggle 
animals out of Thailand because customs officials there are unfamiliar with the 
complicated conservation laws. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildlife Department also has no facilities to care for seized animals, so 
they are often at risk of dying even if they are rescued. Two British women 
living in Thailand, Leonie Vejjajiva and Margaret Himathongkom, have started 
private menageries to care for recovered animals, including the three gibbons. 
</P>
<P>
Bangkok's tourist shops are filled with items carved from ivory. Shop owners 
assert that the ivory is from Africa, where exporting ivory is prohibited. But 
Thailand does not observe the ban and, under Thai law, African ivory is legal. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are no checks to determine whether the ivory has actually come 
from Africa or from Thai elephants, which are protected by law. Last month, 
Sueb Nakhasathien, head of one of Thailand's largest wildlife sanctuaries, 
committed suicide to draw attention to the widespread poaching of protected 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, tourist areas are filled with shops offering reptile-skin boots at 
bargain prices. The boots almost certainly are made in Brazil from skins of the 
endangered caimans rather than of the far more expensive crocodiles raised in 
Thailand. But once the skins have been turned into pointed cowboy boots, few 
stop to ask questions. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Milliken, a Covina, Calif., man who works for an organization called 
Traffic Japan, which is attempting to restrict illegal wildlife trade in Japan, 
said there is an enormous market in that country. 
</P>
<P>
Milliken traced several shipments in 1988 in which tens of thousands of caiman 
skins were sent from South America through Thailand and on to Japan using 
forged documents obtained in Bangkok to obscure their origins. At one point, 
the Japanese government sent a query by telex to the Thai Wildlife Department; 
the reply by telex came instead from a wildlife dealer, indicating that 
government employees were working on both sides of the fence. 
</P>
<P>
"The Thai law contains a major loophole," Milliken said. "If the situation 
doesn't improve qualitatively, I think you'll see sanctions being imposed 
against Thailand." 
</P>
<P>
Even Pairot Suwannakorn, director general of the Forestry Department, who has 
been praised by foreign experts for his efforts to reform his agency, said the 
existing laws "are simply ridiculous. We don't have the power to arrest." 
</P>
<P>
He added that corruption among government officials who profit from the trade 
"is a big problem." 
</P>
<P>
As just about every tourist who has visited Bangkok knows, the city's weekend 
Chatuchak market is a center for the wildlife trade. During a visit in early 
October, a trader produced a gibbon from a hiding place and offered it for sale 
for 3,000 baht, about $120. 
</P>
<P>
Another loophole in Thai laws that benefits small dealers allows individuals to 
own two protected animals as pets. Thus, even if caught with two gibbons at the 
market, a dealer can avoid prosecution by saying they are merely pets. Dealers 
frequently employ children as salesmen, thus avoiding prosecution altogether. 
</P>
<P>
According to Boonlerd of the Forestry Department, 57 people have been arrested 
for wildlife trade this year and the government has confiscated 1,559 birds, 
481 reptiles and 123 mammals, mostly monkeys. It also has taken possession of 
10,159 illegal skins. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the wildlife trade is so open that a worldwide conference on 
conservation was held recently at a Bangkok hotel that advertises that it has 
hundreds of rare birds in cages on its grounds. The export to Thailand of many 
such birds is barred under the endangered-species convention. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the weekend market and individual vendors serving tourists, there are 
four major wildlife traders in Bangkok who act as conduits for shipping abroad, 
wildlife groups say. Many use impoverished zoos in Eastern Europe to further 
help "launder" the animals, obscuring their true origins, according to Thai 
wildlife officials. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for a specimen or two of an endangered animal, the zoos provide the 
dealers with certificates falsely showing that other specimens of the animal 
were born in captivity. Under the international convention, the sale of 
endangered species born in captivity is legal. 
</P>
<P>
One of the four traders, Preecha Varavichit, who operates a company called 
Pimjai Birds, told the newspaper Bangkok Post recently that he paid $5,000 to 
the Laotian government to operate out of Vientiane, where wildlife trading is 
conducted at a former army camp and is apparently legal. 
</P>
<P>
"Laos has a lot of wildlife," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Preecha told the newspaper that senior Thai officials "have never questioned 
me, and they don't dare." He was quoted as saying that "if government officials 
did not give their cooperation, I would not be able to do business. Don't blame 
me alone. They work as a team. If they take legal action against me, I will 
reveal everything." 
</P>
<P>
Shirley McGreal, head of the International Primate Protective League in 
Summerville, S.C., said in a telephone interview that the flourishing trade is 
doubly worrying because of the destructive way in which the wildlife is 
collected. 
</P>
<P>
A baby gibbon, for example, can be taken only if the mother is killed, usually 
by high-powered rifle. But the subsequent fall from a tree often injures the 
baby as well, meaning that 20 gibbons may die for each one sold on the market. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very, very destructive of the species," McGreal said. "There is such 
terrible waste." 
</P>
<P>
According to McGreal and others, the animals are also shipped in horrific 
conditions. A gorilla sent from Africa to Bangkok via Moscow arrived frozen 
solid. One Japanese tourist had 11 rare monkeys jammed into a carry-on bag. 
When discovered by Tokyo customs, five of the monkeys had suffocated. 
</P>
<P>
Pisit na Patalung, head of the Wildlife Fund of Thailand, said he objects to 
the sheer cruelty of the animal dealers. Monkeys' teeth are pulled out with 
pliers or cut with clippers to make their bites harmless. Smugglers have gotten 
some small leopards out of Thailand by dyeing their fur black and claiming them 
as house cats. Rare birds are drugged and stuffed into suitcases. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most famous case involves what has become known as the "Bangkok 
Six," six orangutans shipped from Singapore to Belgrade, Yugoslavia, via 
Bangkok last February. Singapore does not X-ray personal baggage as a security 
precaution, and so it is another favorite conduit for wildlife smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the shipment was discovered in Bangkok because of a clerical 
oversight; the Soviet airline Aeroflot would not carry animals without a 
waybill. When the crate was opened, the six orangutans were found stuffed in 
straw to keep them from moving, three of them upside down. A West German 
national, Kurt Schafer, who works for a wildlife trader in Bangkok, was later 
fined about $1,000 by a Singapore court for attempting to smuggle the animals 
to the Belgrade Zoo in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
According to McGreal, the six orangutans were apparently headed for a wildlife 
dealer in Miami. The apes have been popular in the United States since Clint 
Eastwood made a series of films with them. 
</P>
<P>
The case of the Bangkok Six caused a furor in Thailand. Photographs appeared 
around the world showing the injured apes. Although shipped back to their 
native Indonesia, four of them have since died. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the outcry, a wild animal dealer in Jakarta has four orangutans 
awaiting shipment, according to Leonie Vejjajiva. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just too horrible to contemplate," she said.

BUSH WEIGHS HIS THREAT TO VETO CIVIL RIGHTS BILL; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATION: THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS A COMPROMISE MEASURE IS STILL POSSIBLE. 
DEMONSTRATORS CALL ON THE PRESIDENT TO SIGN VERSION PASSED BY CONGRESS.

<P>
President Bush was confronted by a last-minute appeal and demonstration by 
civil rights leaders Friday as he weighed whether to carry through on his 
threat to veto the civil rights minority-hiring bill. 
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there was a long-shot possibility 
that a compromise could be reached, but he indicated that Bush might simply 
veto the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"We will staple our new bill to the veto message and send it right back up," 
Fitzwater suggested. 
</P>
<P>
However, another official said Friday that the Administration was preparing new 
proposals for Congress to consider that offer a compromise on the sticky 
question of whether the bill would result in hiring quotas for minority 
members. 
</P>
<P>
This official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the White House could 
have a draft ready this weekend to send to Capitol Hill, where members of 
Congress will be meeting on the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
The civil rights bill had not been sent to the White House from Congress by the 
time Bush left to spend the weekend at the presidential retreat at Camp David, 
Md. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sen. James M. Jeffords (R-Vt.), one of five Republicans who met 
Thursday with Bush to discuss the bill, said he remained optimistic that 
Congress could draft follow-up legislation that would satisfy the President's 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to the President again this afternoon," Jeffords said. "We are 
optimistic, there has been movement on both sides." He said Bush set no 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, passed earlier this week, would make it easier for women and 
minority workers to bring discrimination suits against their employers. The 
White House contends that the bill would force employers to establish hiring 
quotas -- something that sponsors dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, which is the top legislative goal of national civil rights groups, 
would reverse a series of Supreme Court rulings that sponsors of the measure 
say have weakened anti-discrimination protections in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said the only hope of heading off a veto was congressional action on 
separate legislation that would, in effect, modify the civil rights bill to 
meet the Administration's objections. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, civil rights leaders demonstrated in front of the White House and 
sought a meeting with Bush in a last-ditch effort to persuade him to sign the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
"We are asking that, before he makes a decision to veto it, that he would meet 
with the civil rights leadership," said Benjamin L. Hooks, executive director 
of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Bush had told him in a telephone conversation Thursday that he was 
exploring possible ways to avoid a veto, including passage of follow-up 
legislation modifying the main bill to meet his objections. 
</P>
<P>
Hooks suggested that civil rights leaders were not willing to endorse any 
compromise that would water down the legislation. But, he said that "there is 
room for hope" that Bush might reverse himself and sign the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said, "The President certainly wants a strong civil rights bill. He 
is committed to it. Let's erase this legal question and make it a true civil 
rights bill." 
</P>
<P>
He hinted that Democratic sponsors of the civil rights bill that was passed by 
Congress were more interested in playing politics with the issue than in 
ironing out differences with the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been nothing to change our belief that it's a quota bill. The only 
issue is, is there any way to get it changed at this late date in a way that 
will be satisfactory," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Hooks was among several hundred chanting demonstrators who gathered outside the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
White House congressional liaison Frederick McClure greeted them at the gate, 
then escorted a small delegation onto the grounds, where he accepted the 
demonstrators' written request for a meeting with Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators held aloft a large banner that said: "Mr. President, Sign the 
Civil Rights Bill." 
</P>
<P>
Hooks said the demonstrators represented "civil rights organizations from all 
over the nation -- women's groups, Hispanic groups, from the Jewish community, 
from the black community and from the liberal Republican groups." 
</P>
<P>
"The consequence of a veto is that President Bush will not be living up to his 
promise of representing all the people, and that gentler, kinder nation that we 
were looking for will not come to pass," Hooks said.

HUNGARY HOPES TO TRANSFORM FORMER SOVIET AIR BASES INTO COMMERCIAL VENTURES, 
WITH WESTERN HELP.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trying to cash in on one of Eastern Europe's few immediate peace dividends, 
Hungarian officials are seeking Western partners to transform former Soviet air 
bases into regional airports, air freight terminals or aircraft service 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
A government call for leasing proposals on seven sites being abandoned by the 
Soviets, including one just south of Budapest, signals the start of an 
aggressive campaign to make Hungary an important civil aviation crossroad 
between East and West. 
</P>
<P>
Air transportation authorities say representatives of major aircraft 
manufacturers such as Boeing and Lockheed have expressed keen interest in the 
site near Budapest as a potential manufacturing or maintenance center for 
jetliners they hope to sell to the emerging East European and Soviet markets. 
</P>
<P>
International air cargo movers are reportedly eyeing the same site, the Tokol 
air base on the Danube River, as a major transit center for refrigerated goods. 
</P>
<P>
Detailed descriptions of the sites and facilities still in Soviet hands are to 
be made available next month, said Defense Ministry spokesman Gyorgy Keleti. 
But the task of identifying exactly what is being offered is proving difficult, 
as the Hungarians don't know themselves what the Soviets will leave behind. 
</P>
<P>
During four decades of military occupation, Soviet troops made some substantial 
improvements in the Hungarian properties they controlled, including what are 
reportedly modern runways and hangars. Moscow has demanded more than $800 
million for its "investments" in Hungary, and last month it sent negotiators to 
Budapest to press its bid for compensation. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarians have, in turn, accused the Soviets of grossly polluting the 
bases they occupied, spilling fuel into soil and ground water and littering 
practice fields with live ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides agree that Hungary has an uncontested claim to the actual real 
estate. But Budapest argues that the environmental damage should even the score 
for any structural improvements made by the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
"Hungary is not willing to pay for those improvements that were of military 
significance but have little or no commercial value," such as bunkers, shabby 
barracks and surveillance equipment, Keleti said. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are continuing, but neither side is sure how soon they will be 
able to agree on the compensation issue. There is a June, 1991, deadline for 
the Soviet pullout. 
</P>
<P>
The standoff requires some skilled poker-playing on the part of the Hungarians. 
Bids to lease the facilities won't be opened until Dec. 4, so the Ministry of 
Transportation doesn't yet know details of the projects being proposed. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokol base has runways long enough to handle any aircraft, and its location 
on Csepel Island in the Danube River gives it good access to shipping 
throughout Central Europe, Keleti said. 
</P>
<P>
Another of the bases, near the eastern city of Debrecen, has already been 
turned over by the Soviets and is being used as a regional airport by the 
national airline Malev and a new domestic carrier, Danube Air. But vast areas 
of the Debrecen base remain unused and open to development. 
</P>
<P>
The bases would need major investment to be brought up to the comfort standards 
demanded by international air travelers, so Western airlines are expected to 
continue using Budapest's two-terminal Ferihegy Airport for all passenger 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to discourage any offers, but the bases are probably more suited 
to manufacturing and cargo handling than passenger service," Keleti said.

PALMA DE MAJORCA, Spain 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A terrible loss of animal life etched the issues for all to see on the eve of 
an international conference on the environment of the Mediterranean Sea: Scores 
of dead dolphins were washing up on the beaches of Majorca, the Costa Brava and 
other favorite resorts of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Veterinarians concluded that contamination of the Mediterranean had broken down 
the immune systems of these sleek animals, leaving them too weak to fight off a 
viral infection. 
</P>
<P>
It was a dramatic reminder that the calm and light-blue waters of the 
Mediterranean have become polluted in the last few decades by the immense 
industrialization of southern Europe and by the 50 million tourists who crowd 
onto the sun-drenched beaches every year. 
</P>
<P>
The Rhone River alone, which courses past some of France's most potent 
petrochemicaland nuclear energy plants, each day deposits an enormous tonnage 
of nitrates, sulfates, iron, sewage, mercury and pesticides into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
The issues thus seemed obvious enough when the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) opened its meeting on the Mediterranean 
environment here almost a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
But the Mediterranean, usually described as the cradle of European 
civilization, has often been a crucible of conflict as well. So, it was not too 
surprising that the meeting of 35 nations, which ended with flowery and general 
promises of cooperation Friday, was caught up in tense wrangling during key 
moments of negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
A political problem erupted on the first day when Spanish Foreign Affairs 
Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, supported by the Italian foreign 
minister, called on the member governments "to apply the spirit of Helsinki to 
the Mediterranean and Middle East" and create a new organization, the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal touched the heart of the history of the organization. The CSCE, a 
meeting ground for Europe's Western and Communist camps, first met in Helsinki 
in 1973 and produced a series of agreements on human rights two years later 
that became known as the Helsinki Accords. Since the Soviet Union had signed 
the accords, dissidents in Eastern Europe embraced them as justification for 
their cries for freedom. 
</P>
<P>
With the world in crisis over Iraqi aggression in the Middle East, Fernandez 
Ordonez said, it is time to create an organization that would provide a meeting 
ground for all Mediterranean peoples, no matter how much in conflict. Steps 
might somehow be taken, for example, to ease relations between Israelis and 
Arabs just as the Helsinki Accords gradually led to an easing of U.S.-Soviet 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish-Italian proposal hit some delegations like a wet fish. Ambassador 
John Davis, the U.S. delegate, insisted it simply was out of place: It had 
nothing to do with the Mediterranean environment. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government obviously looked on the proposal as a Pandora's Box, one 
that might create a new forum for President Saddam Hussein of Iraq or lead to 
the kind of international conference on the Middle East that the United States 
has long opposed. In the end, the U.S. view prevailed: The final communique 
merely noted that the proposal had been made. 
</P>
<P>
The conference also had the usual tug of wills between environmentalists and 
protectors of economic interests. In the end, according to the private 
environmental organization Greenpeace, the economic interests won. 
</P>
<P>
Xavier Pastor, a Spaniard in charge of Greenpeace's Mediterranean studies, 
denounced what he called the incompetence of many delegations and singled out 
the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and the European Common Market 
secretariat as the main diluters of tough resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
Britain, according to Pastor, had rejected a proposal by Italy to ban the 
mile-long drift nets that catch every small species in the way while trapping 
commercial fish in the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
Pastor pronounced the conference "a complete failure." In the end, he said, the 
delegates failed to adopt any resolution that "will make a substantial 
difference in what is going on in the Mediterranean."

SENATE VOTES 74-25 TO HALVE MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR;

<P>
CENTRAL AMERICA: THE LAWMAKERS RISK A VETO AS THEY CALL FOR POLITICAL AND HUMAN 
RIGHTS REFORMS.

<P>
The Senate, in a sharp rebuke to the Bush Administration, voted overwhelmingly 
Friday to withhold more than $40 million in military assistance from El 
Salvador in an effort to press political and human rights reforms on its armed 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
Defying a White House veto threat, senators voted 74 to 25 to impose complex 
restrictions on the $85 million in military aid earmarked for El Salvador next 
year, withholding half for now and tying future assistance to the conduct of 
both sides in El Salvador's bloody civil war. 
</P>
<P>
The provisions were part of a $15.5-billion foreign aid bill on which the 
Senate had hoped to complete action late Friday. It eventually postponed a 
decision until Monday. Reflecting congressional concern about the Persian Gulf 
crisis, the bill also would forgive $7 billion in Egyptian military debt and 
cut off aid to countries that fail to comply with the global embargo against 
Iraq. Egypt has sent troops to Saudi Arabia to support the U.S.-led deployment 
against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian debt plan survived a spirited challenge, with critics arguing that 
it sets a precedent the United States cannot afford at a time when lawmakers 
must make deep cuts in domestic spending to reduce the budget deficit by $500 
billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
The provision, which the Administration believes is vital to the stability of a 
key U.S. ally in the Middle East, was retained when an attempt to strip it from 
the bill was defeated by a 55-42 margin. 
</P>
<P>
It was El Salvador, however, that dominated debate and clouded the future of 
the bill, which President Bush has indicated he may veto unless the conditions 
it places on Salvadoran military aid are modified. The House adopted similar 
restrictions in the foreign aid bill it passed in June. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting congressional frustration with El Salvador's failure to solve the 
brutal murders of six priests last year, the amendment sponsored by Sens. 
Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) and Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) caps military aid to 
El Salvador next year at $85 million. 
</P>
<P>
Half of the $85 million would be withheld unless Bush determines that the 
country's leftist rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front are 
unwilling to accept a U.N. cease-fire plan or to cooperate with U.N. mediation 
efforts, or if they launch another major military offensive. The full aid 
package would be restored in any of those circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
If, however, the government of President Alfredo Cristiani refuses to accept 
the U.N. plan or fails to prosecute military officers believed responsible for 
the slaying of the priests, the aid would be cut off completely. 
</P>
<P>
While the Administration lobbied intensively to soften the restrictions, 
several lawmakers said they do not believe that Bush will carry out his threat 
to veto the foreign aid bill. They cited Bush's desire to win approval of the 
Egyptian debt provision and the White House's recognition that, after a year of 
prevarication and procrastination by officials investigating the Jesuit case, 
congressional action was unavoidable. 
</P>
<P>
The slaying of the Jesuits, followed by reports that Salvadoran military 
officials were tampering with evidence and delaying the investigation, 
mobilized a strong move in Congress to challenge the Administration's policies 
on El Salvador. The prevailing mood was evident in the fact that 19 Republicans 
joined with Democrats to vote for the Dodd-Leahy cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"Year after year, the Administration has said it will cut military aid to El 
Salvador if the (human rights) situation didn't improve . . . and year after 
year, it doesn't improve. It gets worse," Leahy said in urging passage of the 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"At a time when we are cutting virtually every program important to people in 
the United States, we are sending money by the carload to El Salvador . . . and 
that's not foreign policy, that's crazy," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that the effort to impose conditions on aid to El Salvador would 
succeed, the Administration tried to soften them by supporting a Republican 
amendment that would have restored the cuts unless both sides accepted a 
cease-fire within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Robert W. Kasten (R-Wis.), the ranking Republican on the foreign 
operations subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee, argued that the 
amendment would have given the Dodd-Leahy provisions "balance" by applying 
pressure to reach peace "equally to both sides." 
</P>
<P>
The Republican amendment was defeated 58 to 39, well short of the two-thirds 
majority needed to override a veto.

FIRMS REASSURE CONSUMERS ABOUT MERCURY IN PAINTS

Paint companies scrambled to alleviate consumer fears Friday over reports that 
mercury in interior latex paint can be harmful. Several of the companies said 
they have not used mercury for years. 
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency barred manufacturers from adding mercury to 
paint after Aug. 20. Paint made before then may still be sold, however. 
</P>
<P>
But the furor followed reports this week of a study that found relatively high 
levels of mercury in people whose homes were painted inside with latex paint 
containing mercury. 
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted in 1989, was published in Thursday's issue of the New 
England Journal of Medicine. Concern about mercury in paint arose last year 
after a 4-year-old Michigan boy suffered mercury poisoning when his home was 
painted. He suffered severe rashes, itching, sweating and a personality change. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA's 24-hour hot line for paint information -- the National Pesticide 
Telecommunications Network at 1-800-858-7378 -- reported a record 900 calls on 
the issue on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A trade group for 550 manufacturers, including some of the nation's largest, 
noted that paint used in the study and to which the boy was exposed contained 
nearly three times as much mercury as the EPA recommended at the time. The 
paint was made by the Mercury Paint Co. of Detroit, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
"It was almost certainly at the high end," said Marilyn Ludwig, spokeswoman for 
the National Paint &amp; Coatings Assn. in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"Vague directives" led the EPA to declare Mercury Paint's mercury levels to be 
an "unenforceable action," agency spokesman Al Heier said. 
</P>
<P>
A telephone call Friday to Charles Soberman, president and owner of Mercury 
Paint, was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
Most uses of mercury were banned in the mid-1970s, except in paint. 
Manufacturers had convinced the EPA that they didn't have a good alternative to 
mercury, Heier said. The element is used to preserve the paint in the can and 
prevent mildew after application. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA estimates that, before the recent ban, up to 30% of interior latex 
paint contained mercury. But the industry association believes just 10% to 15% 
contained the element, Ludwig said. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers who own paint bought before the ban should call the manufacturer to 
determine if it contains mercury, she said.

Champion Garry Kasparov took one of his three allowed timeouts Friday, 
postponing Game 5 of the World Chess Championship series with challenger 
Anatoly Karpov until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Karpov used one of his timeouts last week, after suffering a defeat in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
Kasparov and Karpov agreed Thursday to a draw in the fourth game. The draw was 
initiated by Karpov a few hours after the game was adjourned. 
</P>
<P>
Kasparov, who has remained on the attack throughout the match, leads with 2 1/2 
points to Karpov's 1 1/2 points. The victory in the second game was worth a 
full point to Kasparov. The other three games have been draws, worth half a 
point to each player. 
</P>
<P>
Kasparov and Karpov are playing a 24-game series for the crown and a $3-million 
purse. They are scheduled to play on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, with the 
first 12 games in New York and the rest in Lyon, France. The first player to 
reach 12 1/2 points wins.

CRIMINAL INDICTMENT OF EXXON IN ALASKA OIL SPILL IS UPHELD

A federal judge on Friday upheld the government's indictment of Exxon and 
rejected a plea to throw out criminal charges stemming from last year's massive 
Exxon Valdez oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
"I deny all motions to dismiss," U.S. District Judge H. Russel Holland said 
after a two-hour hearing in which Exxon Corp. and Exxon Shipping Co. sought to 
have the charges against them thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, to be followed by a written opinion later, was welcomed by Justice 
Department lawyers, who are prosecuting the two Exxon companies for the 
nation's worst oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
"The indictment is proper and fairly puts the defendants on notice of what they 
have to defend against," Holland said in a brief statement. Exxon lawyers at 
the hearing voiced disappointment over their defeat but said there would be no 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The trial has been set for April 10, more than two years after the tanker Exxon 
Valdez rammed into Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound and spilled 11 million 
gallons of oil into pristine waters, fouling rich fishing grounds and wildlife 
habitat.

WASHINGTON PARTY ACTS TO GAIN SPOT ON BALLOT; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: GROUP NAMED AFTER CHICAGO'S FIRST BLACK MAYOR HAS DEMOCRATS WORRIED 
IT MAY HELP GOP AT POLLS.

<P>
Harold Washington died almost three years ago, but in the raucous world of 
Chicago politics his name -- if not, perhaps, his spirit -- lives on in the 
form of a now-you-see-it-now-you-don't political party that could cause major 
problems for Chicago Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
The all-black Harold Washington Party, named after the city's first black 
mayor, was formed last year by Alderman Timothy C. Evans, a Washington protege 
who waged an unsuccessful mayoral campaign as an independent. In its current 
incarnation, the party is trying to get a countywide slate of candidates on the 
Nov. 6 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
What has Cook County Democrats worried is the possibility that the party will 
help Republicans get elected -- perchance from the governorship on down -- by 
siphoning black voters away from the Democrats. Increasing the concern is the 
fact that Democratic gubernatorial candidate Neil Hartigan is running no better 
than neck-and-neck with Republican Jim Edgar. 
</P>
<P>
The Illinois Supreme Court took the Washington Party off the ballot last week, 
upholding a lower court ruling that the party did not collect enough signatures 
on its petitions in suburban areas. 
</P>
<P>
But party organizers, bitterly decrying what they call the mistreatment of 
blacks by the Democratic organization, vowed to fight down to the wire and take 
the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary to get on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it seems that damaging the Democratic Party is the Washington Party's 
primary goal, so strong is the anger party organizers hold toward regular 
Democrats, whom they accuse of mistreating and neglecting the black community. 
</P>
<P>
Blatant racial appeals are nothing new to Chicago. In 1987, white mayoral 
candidate Thomas C. Hynes formed a white-based third party in reaction to the 
Democrats' renomination of Washington as the party's candidate. 
</P>
<P>
It is a truism here that whites vote for white candidates and blacks for black 
candidates. But R. Eugene Pincham, a former Illinois appellate judge and the 
titular head of the Washington Party, argues in a lengthy treatise, entitled 
"Why the Harold Washington Party," that the organization was formed because the 
truism actually is false. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, blacks, who make up about half of the city's population, voted 
overwhelmingly for the Democratic-endorsed candidates even though the vast 
majority of those candidates were white and did little for the black community 
once they were elected, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"The attitude, perception and reality that African-Americans have no 
alternative -- no place to go -- must be eliminated, completely and 
permanently," Pincham argues. 
</P>
<P>
Creation of the Harold Washington Party has drawn criticism from Democratic 
politicians, white and black, who say inclusiveness, not isolation, was the 
lesson of Washington's election as Chicago's first black mayor. 
</P>
<P>
But antipathy toward the Democratic Party has grown so strong in some quarters 
of the black community that the Washington Party at times has resembled nothing 
less than a kamikaze assault on the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
If the party does not succeed in getting on the ballot, party officials hint 
that they will urge supporters to vote Republican or for write-in candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't kowtow to a party that's trying to destroy this community," Pincham 
said at a press conference.

Three white supremacists face up to 25 years in prison on their convictions for 
plotting last spring to bomb a Seattle disco frequented by homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Edwin Nelson, 35, Robert John Winslow, 29, and Proctor James Baker, 58, 
all of northern Idaho, were convicted Thursday night by a federal court jury. 
Sentencing was set for Jan. 11. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Ronald Howen, an assistant U.S. attorney, called the case one 
of "domestic terrorism." Besides plotting to bomb Neighbours Disco, prosecutors 
charged, the three plotted to bomb a synagogue and Seattle-area businesses 
frequented by blacks and Asian-Americans.

ETHICS PANEL DELAYS ACTION IN 'KEATING 5' INVESTIGATION

The Senate Ethics Committee on Friday delayed a decision on five senators under 
investigation for their ties to former savings and loan executive Charles H. 
Keating Jr., prompting a protest from Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) that the five 
are being victimized by the panel's "fear of acting." 
</P>
<P>
Lott, a committee member, described himself as "furious" about what he said was 
the committee's inability to decide how to proceed. He said he was pessimistic 
about chances for action before Congress adjourns, adding: "I feel like I've 
become an accomplice to a crime." 
</P>
<P>
Before the six-member panel is a recommendation from its special counsel, 
Robert S. Bennett, that it take no further action against Sens. John Glenn 
(D-Ohio) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) but proceed to a full investigation of Sens. 
Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) and Donald W. Riegle Jr. 
(D-Mich.). 
</P>
<P>
After brief meetings over the last two days to decide what to do, the 
committee, distracted by other business and apparently split over how quickly 
to act, put off a decision until at least Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bennett found no reason to proceed against Glenn and McCain, he said 
he found critical links between Keating's contributions to the other three 
senators and their intervention with thrift-industry regulators on behalf of 
Keating's failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine, Calif. Keating gave a 
total of $1.3 million to the campaigns and causes of the five senators. 
</P>
<P>
Documents being examined by the committee indicate that Cranston, DeConcini and 
Riegle had more extensive dealings with Keating than they acknowledged, 
including a relationship that continued after regulators warned them that 
Keating faced a criminal probe. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of Lincoln is expected to cost taxpayers about $2 billion. Keating 
was released Thursday on $300,000 bond after a month in jail in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Lott's angry outburst to reporters occurred as pressure for action by the 
committee mounted among Republicans in the Senate, many of whom are complaining 
privately that Democrats on the panel are waiting until after the Nov. 6 
congressional elections to act. If Glenn and McCain are dropped from the probe, 
the bipartisan "Keating Five" would become the all-Democratic "Keating Three," 
they note. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Howell Heflin (D-Ala.), chairman of the Select Committee on Ethics, 
expressed frustration as he left the meeting, but his annoyance was directed at 
leaks to newspapers of documents that have been compiled in the case. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if the slow pace were attributable to Heflin, who is known for his 
deliberative way of doing business, Lott said, "I can't say it's one or two 
(members) or even that it's partisan, quite frankly." Instead, he said, "I'm 
afraid it's the Senate . . . which is completely incompetent to let go of 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Colleagues have said that both Glenn and McCain are intensely frustrated by the 
delay in action by the committee. "I've been frustrated for a year," Glenn said 
Friday. McCain, who has been more outspoken in his impatience, said: "Frankly, 
I'm deeply disappointed they haven't been able to act. I think they owe the 
American people an explanation."

SENATOR'S AIDE TAKES A CRACK AT A CODE

Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.) says there might be merit in the work of an aide 
who thought he discovered a code word by playing Administration officials' 
Persian Gulf speeches backward. 
</P>
<P>
But Pell, who is seeking a sixth term, said aide C. B. Scott Jones, who is paid 
to study paranormal phenomena, did not have permission to write Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney questioning whether "Simone" was a code word. 
</P>
<P>
Jones' Oct. 3 letter on Senate stationery, which was sent anonymously to 
several Rhode Island news outlets this week, said the word appeared when 
speeches by President Bush, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Cheney 
were played backward. 
</P>
<P>
"I mention this situation in case it is a code word that would not be in the 
national interest to be known," the letter said. "If the word means nothing 
special to you, this is a non-event, just another mystery in a new technology 
we are developing." 
</P>
<P>
Pell's long-standing interest in the paranormal brings periodic snickers from 
his Capitol Hill colleagues. Jones, 62, a six-year veteran of Pell's staff who 
earns about $50,000 annually, is assigned to study developments in paranormal 
phenomena. 
</P>
<P>
Pell is seeking reelection against Rep. Claudine Schneider. He said the timing 
of the letter "certainly isn't helpful." 
</P>
<P>
Jones was reprimanded for his actions, said Pell's chief of staff, Thomas G. 
Hughes Jr. Pell said he had not known about the letter until reporters 
questioned him about it. 
</P>
<P>
Pell, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told the Providence 
Journal-Bulletin that the reverse speech theory "sounds wacky, (but) there may 
be some merit to it" because he trusts Jones. 
</P>
<P>
The senator said he thought Jones was concerned that the alleged code word was 
accessible and that the letter was "motivated by patriotic reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Jones said the reverse speech theory, which is relatively new to him, holds 
that audio tapes played backward can disclose the hidden codes or thoughts 
behind normal, forward speech. Someone alerted him to the "Simone" theory, and 
he decided to alert Cheney, a longtime friend of his, he said.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE AD CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By Elements of the ad, with analysis by Times political writer Bill Stall 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The race: Governor. Whose ad: Republican Pete Wilson. Cost: The Wilson campaign 
refused to disclose. Producer: Don Sipple and Larry McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Sen. Pete Wilson launches a 30-second television commercial 
throughout California today that seeks to blunt the Senate absenteeism issue 
that Democrat Dianne Feinstein has used against him and to further brand 
Feinstein as a candidate who will raise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Elements of the ad, with analysis by Times political writer Bill Stall: 
</P>
<P>
Ad: The commercial shows a photo of Feinstein followed by a graphic from 
Congressional Quarterly magazine and a photo of Wilson casting a Senate vote 
after surgery. An announcer says: "When Dianne Feinstein attacks Pete Wilson's 
attendance, remember: Wilson's attendance is a solid 92%. Wilson missed votes 
while helping earthquake victims and for an emergency appendectomy." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Wilson was recorded on 92% of 312 roll call votes in the Senate 
during 1989, the third-worst voting record in the Senate. Twenty senators voted 
on every bill for a 100% record. A tally of 98% or 99% was relatively common. 
Wilson missed 14 votes while in California after the San Francisco Bay Area 
earthquake a year ago. His post-surgery vote in pajamas in favor of the 
balanced-budget constitutional amendment occurred in 1985. The Feinstein 
campaign claimed that since 1987, Wilson has had the worst attendance record in 
the Senate, missing 71 of 291 votes during 1990. This summer, Wilson attended 
most Senate sessions during the week and campaigned in California on weekends 
until the August recess. From the time Congress went back into session after 
Labor Day until he returned to Washington late Monday, Wilson campaigned full 
time in California and missed 46 Senate roll call votes. Twenty-five of the 33 
senators who are up for reelection this year made every roll call vote. 
</P>
<P>
Ad: With newspaper headlines showing on the screen, the announcer says, 
"Feinstein is attacking Wilson to hide her own record on taxes. As mayor, 
Feinstein raised taxes six times, but still left a $172-million deficit. Now, 
Feinstein proposes increasing sales and income taxes by nearly $2 billion a 
year. Can we afford Feinstein for governor?" 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Taxes did go up during Feinstein's terms as mayor of San Francisco, 
including at least one levy that she opposed. Technically, all of Feinstein's 
budgets were balanced as required by state law. When Feinstein was succeeded by 
present Mayor Art Agnos, with whom Feinstein often has quarreled, Agnos claimed 
that Feinstein left the city with a potential $172-million deficit in his first 
year. 
</P>
<P>
As a candidate for governor, Feinstein has endorsed Proposition 133 on the Nov. 
6 ballot, an initiative sponsored by Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy that would 
increase the state sales tax by half a cent on the dollar to support a variety 
of anti-drug programs. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein had proposed to continue the quarter-cent sales tax levied after the 
Oct. 17, 1989, earthquake beyond its current expiration of Dec. 31 to make 
buildings and highways earthquake safe. This week, however, she said she is no 
longer certain that the money is needed. Feinstein has not specifically called 
for an increase in income taxes. She has said that if elected, she would 
attempt to achieve savings and budget reforms that would obviate the need for 
new taxes. If more tax income was necessary, she proposed reinstating the 11% 
bracket of the state personal income tax for the wealthiest taxpayers.

BONDS TARGET CHILDREN, VETS AND HOUSING

<P>
Three bond issues on the Nov. 6 ballot would raise a total of $755 million to 
benefit a broad spectrum of low- and middle-income Californians -- except for a 
share that could also reach the pockets of those in higher brackets. 
</P>
<P>
Passage of Proposition 145 would authorize the sale of $325 million in bonds to 
finance homes for first-time buyers and to provide housing assistance for a 
range of low-income groups. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 142 is a $400-million home- and farm-loan measure designed to aid 
military veterans. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 151 would raise $30 million to build and expand child-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
Worked out in negotiations between Gov. George Deukmejian and Democratic 
legislative leaders during the final days of the 1990 session, Proposition 145 
would provide $200 million in low-interest loans and interest-rate subsidies to 
5,000 potential first-time home-buyers who meet certain requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining $125 million would go for a variety of programs designed to 
assist low-income renters, farm workers, homeless people and those living in 
buildings that might become unsafe during a major earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"Proposition 145 will make home ownership a reality for many families again," 
Deukmejian said. "Housing prices in California have doubled in the past 10 
years. Many families, even with both parents working, are unable to become 
homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
"Only one in five California families can afford to buy a median-priced home. 
</P>
<P>
This is discouraging to young families just starting out and to employers who 
want to bring more jobs to our state." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno carried the enabling legislation. 
The housing aid measure is also supported by Senate President Pro Tem David A. 
Roberti (D-Los Angeles) and the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Primary opposition to the housing plan comes from Assemblyman Dan Hauser 
(D-Arcata), the chairman of the Assembly Committee on Housing and Community 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
It is a "yuppie" ballot measure, Hauser charged, because people who earn more 
than $80,000 a year could qualify for low-interest home loans in some counties 
where home prices are very high. Eligibility is tied to median prices, so a 
family of three living in San Mateo or Marin counties and earning $83,000, for 
example, could qualify, according to the state formula. 
</P>
<P>
Hauser said it would establish "a policy which benefits the wealthiest 
residents of our state while providing virtually no additional housing for 
those in greatest need." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 142, the $400-million Cal-Vet home- and farm-loan bond issue, is 
aimed at helping 3,200 additional military veterans obtain loans. It would 
continue a state program that has been in operation for almost 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal-Vet program is self-supporting because the interest and principal on 
the bonds are paid back with money received from monthly loan payments made by 
veterans. 
</P>
<P>
Strongly backed by various veterans groups, the legislation to place the bond 
issue on the ballot cleared both houses of the Legislature without dissent. 
</P>
<P>
It was carried by Sen. Don Rogers (R-Bakersfield). B. T. Collins, the state's 
Vietnam War Memorial commissioner, was a leading supporter. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers described the Cal-Vet program as "an appropriate expression of our 
appreciation for the sacrifices U.S. veterans of foreign wars make in defense 
of our state and nation." 
</P>
<P>
Ted Brown, chairman of the Los Angeles central committee of the Libertarian 
Party, opposed the measure, warning that a recession could cause many veterans 
to default on their Cal-Vet loans and leave taxpayers to pay off the bad debts. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 151, the $30-million bond issue to start up or expand child-care 
centers for the children of working parents, is the outgrowth of a bill 
sponsored by Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), chairwoman of the Senate 
Committee on Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
The money would be used to fund low-interest loans to acquire, renovate, 
construct or purchase equipment for child-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
A nine-member Child Care Facilities Authority would administer the loan 
program. Preference would be given to applicants who serve areas with 
significant unmet child-care needs. 
</P>
<P>
"Although many parents would prefer to stay at home and care for their 
children," Watson said, "economic necessity is forcing them into the labor 
force. 
</P>
<P>
"This means that some form of child care is needed for a good part of the day. 
For young people in their critical formative years, the type of care they 
receive can affect their development and achievement later in life." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside), chairman of the Select Committee on Children 
and Youth, and Sen. Becky Morgan (R-Los Altos Hills), chairwoman of the Select 
Committee on Infant Child Care and Development, also support Proposition 151. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents include John Vernon, former chairman of the Libertarian Party, who 
argued that tax credits or tax deductions for working parents would be a better 
way of providing assistance for child-care purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian recently urged California voters to choose carefully when voting on 
the more than one dozen proposed bond issues that will appear on the general 
election ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"Without fiscal restraint by the voters this fall," he said, "we could find 
ourselves too deeply in debt and jeopardize the fiscal health we have worked so 
hard to achieve."

WILSON STRADDLES PRESIDENT'S FINE LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL HOUSTON and CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hours after he voted against a Senate budget plan endorsed by President Bush, 
Pete Wilson was asked by a reporter how he felt about being left out of a 
meeting Bush arranged to thank loyal senators. 
</P>
<P>
"He's what?" asked Wilson, who was en route to the members' dining room Friday 
and unaware of the Capitol event. ". . . I don't have any comment. I don't know 
anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
Only hours before in Los Angeles, Wilson, although absent, had been the 
beneficiary of a fund-raising visit by Vice President Dan Quayle, wherein 
Quayle scorned members of Congress who voted against the President. Then he 
turned around and praised what he called Wilson's "independence" for making the 
same move. 
</P>
<P>
The White House is walking a fine line between getting Republicans elected in 
November and punishing those who defect from the fold on the ongoing budget 
negotiations. And Friday, Pete Wilson found himself straddling the divide. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the Republican candidate for governor got what amounted to a good 
cop, bad cop routine from the country's two top elected Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's reception with senators who supported the bipartisan budget plan was a 
none-too-subtle reminder of the Administration's disappointment in those who 
voted against the Senate bill -- which passed despite the objections of Wilson 
and 22 other Republicans. Most of the opponents, like Wilson, are involved in 
competitive elections next month. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, while lavishing praise on Wilson, underscored the sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
"He thinks voting against the budget was the right thing," Quayle said of 
Wilson. "I respect his independence. I respect his integrity and intellect. I 
just wish he could have been with us." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson explained his vote against the Senate plan in an early-morning address 
in the Senate chamber. He said his vote "reflected the lack of pleasure that we 
see in this particular package and the lack of certainty that it would reduce 
the deficit." He also opposed the bill's proposed 9.5-cent-per-gallon increase 
in gasoline taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The vice president, in a breakfast meeting with reporters, lamented that 
Congress "doesn't pay attention to the leadership." 
</P>
<P>
"You have a Congress that doesn't want to do anything but come home and 
campaign," he said. "They're very good at campaigning; they're very good at 
getting reelected. But they're very bad at conducting the nation's business." 
</P>
<P>
Although Quayle's remarks were not directed at Wilson, they mimicked attacks by 
Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who has berated the senator for weeks for not 
tending to Senate business. Under that fire, Wilson returned to Washington 
Monday for the first time since the August recess. 
</P>
<P>
When the similarity between his comments and Feinstein's criticism was raised, 
Quayle defended Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, he wants to be governor of the state of California and you're not going 
to be able to run for governor of the state of California by spending a lot of 
time in Washington, D.C.," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"He is back there right now because this is the most crucial vote of the 
Congressional session. . . . And therefore he could have, from a theoretical 
point of view, spent the entire two years (of the session) in California but be 
back there in the budget and not miss a thing." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who had been planning to return to California on Saturday, decided late 
Friday to remain in Washington several more days to vote on upcoming 
appropriation bills. Feinstein, who spent the last two days holding 
fund-raisers in the Bay Area, has scheduled a busy weekend of campaign events 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
In his remarks, Quayle said that some of those who had rebelled against an 
earlier bipartisan budget package sanctioned by Congressional leaders and Bush 
-- and then defeated in the House -- were intent on producing "chaos." Their 
behavior, he said, would be quelledby passage of initiatives limiting terms of 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson jumped aboard the term limits bandwagon for the first time on Oct. 7 
during a televised debate with Feinstein. Polls show he has benefited from his 
endorsement of Proposition 140, a term limits initiative on the November 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The vice president has advocated term limits since 1976, when he won a 
congressional seat by defeating an veteran legislator. In his first speech to 
Congress the next year, his spokesman said, Quayle proposed 12-year limits on 
senators and representatives. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not apply it to Congress as well?" Quayle asked, referring to 
constitutional limits of two terms for president. "I say what's good for the 
President is good for the Congress." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's staff said the senator has not endorsed the idea of federal term 
limits, which would affect the job he holds. "He said, 'Let's see what the 
voters in California do first,' " explained his Washington spokeswoman, Lynda 
Schuler. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle compared the movement to limit the lawmakers' terms to the tax revolt of 
the late 1970s. While saying his motive is to replace current legislators with 
members who would "look at the national interest rather than their own 
parochial interest," the vice president also acknowledged that Republicans 
would probably benefit. Democrats currently hold power in both houses of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
At a Koreatown fund-raiser later in the morning, Quayle repeated his support of 
term limits. The event earned Wilson's campaign $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day, the vice president also did his best to spread the 
Administration's view that increasing user fees, like the gasoline tax, is a 
better way to reduce the deficit than raising income taxes, as House Democrats 
wish. While Democrats have characterized their bill as one that would increase 
taxes on the rich, Administration officials have countered that the plan would 
affect all taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
"The Democrats' idea of rich is anyone who has a job," Quayle said.

THE PROPOSITIONS; 
</P>
<P>
131 WOULD FUND CAMPAIGNS, LIMIT OFFICIALS' TERMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Charging that escalating campaign costs have made politicians increasingly 
beholden to well-heeled special interests, backers of one of two term-limit 
initiatives on the November ballot are calling for a dramatic change in the way 
elections are financed. 
</P>
<P>
Propositions 131 and 140 seek to overhaul state politics by forcing more 
turnover of elected representatives. But the public financing of campaigns, 
called for in Proposition 131, could bring a more immediate change in the 
political behavior of candidates for state office and the financial 
contributors on whom they depend. 
</P>
<P>
In place of overwhelming reliance on special-interest money, Proposition 131 
would set up a taxpayer-supported fund to pay up to half the costs of a 
candidate's campaign. The new rules would apply in every race for elected state 
office, including governor, attorney general and all members of the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Proposition 131 contend that public funding would work hand in 
hand with the measure's other provisions -- term limits, a ban on 
non-election-year fund raising, and new restrictions on campaign spending and 
contributions. Backers say this combination of reforms seeks to loosen the grip 
that special interests -- corporations, causes and institutions -- have had on 
legislators. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be the most comprehensive package of campaign reforms ever adopted in 
this country," said Robert M. Stern, the former general counsel for the Fair 
Political Practices Commission and a backer of Proposition 131. 
</P>
<P>
Said Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, who drew up the initiative as part of his 
unsuccessful campaign for governor: "It's really going to open up the 
possibility for new faces (in elected office)." 
</P>
<P>
But opponents of Proposition 131 argue that the campaign-funding provisions 
would increase the influence of special-interest money. They say that when 
limits on political committees are reached, individual corporate executives 
could respond by making sizable personal contributions -- up to $40,000 spread 
over 40 campaigns. Less affluent people would not be able to give as 
generously, according to this argument. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents also argue the initiative would give tax money to the campaigns of 
extremist candidates, and that by limiting campaign spending it would restrict 
free speech. 
</P>
<P>
"It is riddled with ambiguous rules, Orwellian regulations . . . and clearly 
unconstitutional provisions," contends a lengthy dissection of the initiative 
prepared by Berman and D'Agostino Campaigns, consultants for the opposition 
campaign, which is backed by legislative leaders and a wide range of 
special-interest groups, such as labor unions, race tracks, trial lawyers and 
oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is designed to encourage candidates to look to smaller contributions, 
especially from within their own districts, for the money needed to run a 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"The campaign finance reform will turn Sacramento on its head," said Fred 
Woocher, a deputy attorney general, who worked with Van de Kamp in drafting 
Proposition 131. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who raise large amounts from large contributors will no longer be 
favored," Woocher said. "Instead, those skilled in shaking down moneyed 
interests will be at a disadvantage." 
</P>
<P>
The measure would allow taxpayers to voluntarily direct $5 of their state 
income-tax returns to the fund for public campaign financing. That is similar 
to the federal checkoff system, which has provided funding for presidential 
races since 1976. Over the past two years, 21% of federal taxpayers have 
directed $1 of their taxes toward the presidential fund. A similar response 
rate on state returns would mean $20 million a year for California races. 
</P>
<P>
Each individual contribution to a candidate of up to $250 would be matched by 
the state fund in varying amounts -- providing $3 for every $1 donated by a 
person living within the candidate's district and a dollar-for-dollar match for 
donors living outside the district. 
</P>
<P>
No public funds would be made available to match contributions from 
corporations, unions, political action committees and political parties. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would require candidates who accept state money to abide by 
spending limits, which would be lifted only if a non-participating opponent 
exceeds the limit. A candidate for the Assembly who accepted public funds could 
spend no more than $400,000 for the general election. A candidate who chose not 
to accept public financing would be exempt from the spending ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
All candidates, whether they accept public funds or not, would have to limit 
the total amount they accept from all corporations, unions and PACs. A 
candidate for the Assembly could accept no more than $133,333 from these 
sources. Any additional money would have to come from individuals, at 
contributions of no more than $1,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to all these changes, the initiative would create a special 
prosecutor's office to pursue political corruption cases and impose criminal 
penalties on legislators who try to influence government decisions that might 
be of personal financial benefit. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would also tighten existing law to prohibit state elected officials 
from taking any gift of $100 or more, and it would extend a recently enacted 
ban on honorariums, as well as the gift limitation, to local elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
The rival to Van de Kamp's initiative -- Proposition 140, sponsored by Los 
Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum -- would put even more stringent 
limits on the terms of state elected officials but contains no provision for 
public financing of campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 131 would limit Assembly members and state senators to 12 
consecutive years in office. Proposition 140 would create a six-year lifetime 
limit on service in the Assembly and an eight-year limit in the state Senate. 
If both measures pass, term limits would be set by the one getting more votes, 
but all the other provisions of the initiatives would be enacted, including 
public funding of campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the Schabarum initiative say they simply do not like the use of 
public money to pay for campaigns under Proposition 131. 
</P>
<P>
Republican gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson, who supports Proposition 140, 
said recently that he could not endorse Proposition 131 "because it in addition 
proposes that you pay for my election campaigns, not as individuals but as 
taxpayers. I don't think that's right. It would make life a whole lot simpler 
and easier for me as a candidate, but I don't think my inconvenience as a 
candidate is an urgent public priority." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis K. Uhler, president of the National Tax Limitation Committee and a 
co-sponsor of Proposition 140, argued that taxpayers "should not be asked to 
fund campaigns of candidates -- especially those whose opinions they detest." 
</P>
<P>
When backers of Proposition 131 set out to limit the influence of special 
interests, they had to include public financing because of a 1976 U.S. Supreme 
Court ruling. Under that landmark decision, the court said that states can only 
limit campaign spending if the candidates themselves agree voluntarily to do so 
in exchange for public funding of their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Van de Kamp initiative, a candidate for governor who chooses to take 
public money could spend a combined $11.7 million in the primary and general 
election campaigns. Up to half of that amount could come from the 
taxpayer-supported fund. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, in the present gubernatorial campaign, Republican Pete Wilson 
had spent $14.4 million by the end of September. Democrat Dianne Feinstein had 
spent $11.5 million. Both will have spent millions more by Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the Van de Kamp initiative point out that no candidate for 
governor -- whether they accept public funds or not -- could take contributions 
from corporations and other "non-individual" supporters totaling more than $1.5 
million in the primary and $2.4 million in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
Stern predicted that the various limits on contributions would give serious 
candidates for office little choice but to apply for state funds and agree to 
the spending limits. Not to do so, he said, would leave these candidates 
trailing badly in campaign funds. 
</P>
<P>
In their analysis of Proposition 131 drawn up for opponents, political 
consultants Michael Berman and Carl D'Agostino argue that the measure would 
mean paying out "taxpayers' monies to the political campaigns of Lyndon 
LaRouche followers or members of the Ku Klux Klan if such individuals meet the 
qualifications." 
</P>
<P>
Woocher and other backers argue that the measure contains a number of 
safeguards to discourage extremist groups, such as requiring candidates to 
raise a significant amount on their own before becoming eligible for matching 
money. 
</P>
<P>
The Berman-D'Agostino analysis also argues that various cults and radical 
groups would be able to take money from individual members, draw on the public 
fund for a 3-for-1 match, then kick back the original contribution disguising 
it, for example, as salary or consulting fees. 
</P>
<P>
The measure specifically bars a campaign taking public funds from paying money 
to a donor, unless that individual has provided "full and adequate 
consideration" for the payment. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents predict that public funding will prove the downfall of the Van de 
Kamp initiative. That idea has been "rejected by the people several times," 
said Assemblyman Richard L. Mountjoy (R-Monrovia), who is supporting the rival 
term-limit measure. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters point out that voters in 1988, by 53% to 47%, approved Proposition 
68, which contained public financing for legislative races. But the electorate 
gave an even larger mandate to Proposition 73, which specifically prohibited 
the use of public funds in election campaigns. That vote invalidated the public 
financing scheme. Public financing of local campaigns was approved by Los 
Angeles voters last June -- to take effect in 1993 -- but the measure faces 
court challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 140 is silent on the subject of public financing of campaigns. If 
both initiatives pass, the campaign rules contained in the Van de Kamp measure 
would become law.

CITY URGED TO USE CORONADO BRIDGE TOLLS FOR BARRIO LOGAN PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
San Diego city officials were asked Friday to examine ways to use tolls from 
the Coronado Bridge to improve Barrio Logan, the historic Chicano neighborhood 
that was devastated by bridge and highway construction two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the California Transportation Commission decided to retain the $1 
round-trip toll until at least mid-1995, but authorities earmarked the 
estimated $25 million in tolls until mid-1995 for bridge upkeep and for traffic 
projects along bridge approaches in Coronado. The tolls have already paid for 
bridge construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
By statute, the toll funds -- which are state, not city revenues -- can now 
only be used for maintenance, rehabilitation and traffic improvements on the 
bridge and its approaches, said Mariana Mejia, a spokeswoman in Sacramento with 
the California Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Whether that requirement can be met and the funds directed toward 
bridge-related projects in Barrio Logan remains an open question. "They (San 
Diego officials) will have to work around it creatively," said Mejia, the 
Caltrans spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Councilman Bob Filner formally requested that City Manager John 
Lockwood investigate the use of tolls for a variety of Barrio Logan projects, 
including traffic improvements on city streets leading to the bridge and the 
upkeep and expansion of Chicano Park. The park, which is situated in the shadow 
of the bridge's eastern terminus, features widely acclaimed murals depicting 
Chicano, indigenous American and other themes emblazoned on the bridge's 
concrete support pillars. 
</P>
<P>
"Both the construction of the bridge and the ongoing operations have had a 
really negative impact on the community of Barrio Logan, and there ought to be 
some recognition of that impact," said Filner, whose district includes the 
barrio, a low-income area. 
</P>
<P>
In Barrio Logan, where the bridge remains a sore point and where bridge traffic 
contributes to traffic bottlenecks, a still-nascent movement has emerged 
seeking to redirect some of the toll funds to community needs, particularly the 
care of Chicano Park and its much-lauded murals. Some of the murals are 
deteriorating and badly in need of care, activists say. There have also been 
few additions in recent years, although the mural project is considered ongoing 
and open to expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we should get our fair share," said Salvador Roberto Torres, a 
neighborhood resident, artist and assistant professor at San Diego State 
University who has long been active in promoting the park murals. 
"Traditionally, we have been the stepchild in this whole drama of events that 
has unfolded and impacted our community." 
</P>
<P>
The bridge opened in August, 1969. Its erection, along with the somewhat 
earlier construction of the Interstate 5 freeway, displaced thousands of 
residents of Barrio Logan, one of California's oldest Chicano communities. 
Neighborhood outrage over the displacements and a perceived city neglect of the 
area sparked a series of events and confrontations that led directly to the 
founding of Chicano Park and the painting of the murals. 
</P>
<P>
In Coronado, Mayor Mary Herron said Friday that she expects no objection from 
her constituents if bridge toll revenues are redirected to improvements in 
Barrio Logan. However, she noted that the city could face difficulty in 
complying with the state guidelines restricting the use of toll money. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there would be a pretty stiff legal battle," Mayor Herron said.

TRANSIT BOARD ACTS TO GET FUEL TANKS FIXED; 
</P>
<P>
HAZARD: NORTH COUNTY AGENCY FIRES CONTRACTOR IT SAYS IMPROPERLY INSTALLED THE 
STORAGE VESSELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
North County Transit District officials will act next week to repair four 
underground diesel storage tanks after firing the contractor who the district 
claims installed the tanks incorrectly. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Kulchin, chairwoman of the NCTD board, confirmed Friday that directors have 
voted to cancel the contract with Louetto Construction of Escondido for 
construction of the bus company's Oceanside maintenance facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The district's action was taken at a closed session during the Oct. 11 board 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Dwight Worden, attorney for the transit district, said the contract termination 
decision came after six weeks of trying to get Louetto to repair the damaged 
diesel tanks. 
</P>
<P>
"We terminated the contract and asked them to leave the job site," Worden said. 
"We feel there is a real danger here, with those tanks floating around loose. 
For six weeks, we have been trying to get them to come in and do the job right. 
Now we are going out and get some company that knows what it's doing to finish 
the job." 
</P>
<P>
The transit district is the second public agency to have been held up by 
Louetto in recent weeks. Grading at the site of the Cal State San Marcos 
university campus has been delayed for a month because Louetto allegedly failed 
to pay subcontractors. 
</P>
<P>
According to the transit district's Oct. 25 board agenda, directors will be 
asked to empower Richard Fifer, NCTD executive director, to negotiate an 
emergency contract with another company to repair the "dangerous condition" at 
the San Luis Rey valley site off Mission Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The storage tanks, designed to hold 80,000 gallons of fuel for the 300-bus 
fleet, were installed incorrectly and have broken loose from their moorings, 
according to the staff report, which described the tanks as lying askew in a 
partly open pit, floating in ground water, "a dangerous condition." 
</P>
<P>
Transit district spokesman Peter Aadland said the board action Thursday would 
allow Fifer to bypass bidding procedures in order to remedy the situation 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to Louetto notifying the firm of the construction contract 
cancellation, Fifer stated: "The inability of the district to use these tanks 
exposes the district to unacceptable fuel shortages, a concern of which you are 
aware and which is aggravated by the current crisis in the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
Fifer said that the underground storage tanks are "in an unusable and dangerous 
condition," and that bus company is forced to use temporary above-ground fuel 
tanks that hold only a two-day supply of fuel for the bus fleet. 
</P>
<P>
Louie Pauletto, head of Louetto Construction, could not be reached for comment 
at his Escondido office or home Friday. A spokesman at the Louetto offices said 
that no company executives would be available for comment until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Worden said that Louetto removed the old fuel tanks that had given the bus 
company a week's supply of diesel before installing the new tanks, which were 
not anchored securely and broke away from their underground anchorages. 
</P>
<P>
"That is not the only reason we terminated the contract," he said. "It was just 
the straw that broke the camel's back. There have been numerous other problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We will hire another contractor, and we will expect to be reimbursed from 
Louetto for expenditures above the original contract costs." 
</P>
<P>
Two bonding companies insure the transit district and Louetto subcontractors 
against losses if Louetto fails to perform, Worden said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the system works right, bonding company money will finish the job for us," 
he said, "and bonding company money will reimburse the subcontractors who were 
not paid for their work. Then the bonding companies will go after Louetto to 
recover the money." 
</P>
<P>
Worden said subcontractors had 60 liens against Louetto for failure to be paid 
for their work on the Oceanside maintenance yard. 
</P>
<P>
"We paid Louetto a lot of money, but, for some reason, the subcontractors were 
never paid," Worden said. 
</P>
<P>
A subcontractor on the Oceanside maintenance yard construction project, who 
spoke on condition that his name not be used, said that the problems at the 
site went further the improperly installed underground fuel tanks. 
Subcontractors, including his own firm, had not been paid by Louetto, the 
general contractor, and had "walked off the job," after weeks and months of 
seeking compensation without success, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the work, which was started in February, 1989, and was scheduled to be 
completed in January, is about 85% complete, Aadland said. The project involved 
building a state-of-the-art maintenance facility on the site where the transit 
district's predecessor, the Oceanside Bus Co., had had its headquarters for 
several decades. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cal State San Marcos administrators said this week that they had 
been assured by an insurer for Louetto that another contractor will continue 
the grading by Oct. 28.

DUFFY TO REOPEN PROBE OF INMATE ABUSES AT JAIL; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATION: ATTORNEY FOR CAPT. MAUDIE BOBBITT SAYS ACTION BY SHERIFF IS 
POLITICAL RETALIATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff John Duffy said Friday that he is reopening an investigation into 
allegations that the captain who supervised the so-called "Rambo Squad" -- 
accused of harassing prisoners during 1987 and 1988 at the El Cajon jail -- 
overlooked or ignored charges of inmate abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy took the action after saying he would formally withdraw a previously 
imposed 35-day suspension without pay against Capt. Maudie Bobbitt, who was in 
charge of the jail between July, 1986, and February, 1988. The suspension had 
to be withdrawn for the investigation to begin, Duffy's attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
If a sheriff's internal investigation determines that Bobbitt ignored abuse 
complaints, she "could certainly be facing far more serious disciplinary 
actions than the suspension," Duffy said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
Everett Bobbitt, Maudie's husband and attorney in this case, said Duffy's move 
is political retaliation against him for pursuing legal cases against Duffy and 
for Bobbitt's aggressive support of Sheriff's Capt. Jim Roache, who is running 
for sheriff next month against Assistant Sheriff Jack Drown, Duffy's choice as 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy announced last year that he was not running for reelection after nearly 
20 years in office. Soon after the announcement, Drown announced his intention 
to run and Duffy endorsed him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's purely political because Maudie and I supported Roache," Bobbitt said. 
"This is Duffy's way of trying to ensure that Drown wins and retaliating 
against Maudie. I am angry. This is my home and my family and my wife being 
used as a political football." 
</P>
<P>
Bobbitt said Duffy dislikes him for a series of court victories the attorney 
has won over the years, including one that allowed Roache to run for sheriff. 
Bobbitt represents rank-and-file sheriff's deputies, police officers and other 
officials protected under Civil Service regulations. 
</P>
<P>
He said attorneys for Duffy have told him that they eventually will seek to 
fire his wife, a charge Duffy's attorney denies. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual series of events Friday surfaced five days before a hearing at 
which Maudie Bobbitt was to appeal her November, 1989, suspension and to which 
Duffy and Drown were subpoenaed. 
</P>
<P>
Although the hearing is still scheduled for Wednesday, it is unclear exactly 
what matters will be heard. Bobbitt contended that part of Duffy's strategy in 
withdrawing his wife's discipline was to stop the hearing, which is to fall 
less than two weeks before the election. 
</P>
<P>
Bobbitt and nine other deputies and high-ranking officials were disciplined for 
their role in the so-called "Rambo Squad," which the county grand jury 
concluded engaged in "deliberate and cruel harassment . . . to show the inmates 
who's running the jails." 
</P>
<P>
The report said deputies were guilty of abuse, including an exercise in which 
inmates had to lean spread-eagled against a wall until they lost muscle 
control, and having deputies scrape inmates' faces against a wall. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the grand jury said, deputies would "delight in cruelty to others" 
by squashing packets of mustard, catsup and mayonnaise so that the contents 
would spray into cells and inmates would be forced to clean the mess. 
</P>
<P>
After the report was released in March, 1989, Duffy began his own internal 
investigation that drew many of the same conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
In August of last year, he promised the grand jury that he would take "specific 
disciplinary actions" including "termination from employment; demotion in rank; 
30-day suspension without pay; 10-day suspension without pay; and five-day 
suspension without pay." 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported Wednesday, however, that Duffy reneged on the promise and 
that nobody received worse than a suspension. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy and his attorney, Martin J. Mayer, said Friday that Everett Bobbitt 
raised the allegations that his wife ignored or overlooked inmate abuse in a 
legal document submitted to the county's Civil Service Commission last week. 
</P>
<P>
In the legal paper, Bobbitt said he wanted his wife's hearing to include 
Duffy's testimony about whether he condoned inmate abuse at the jail. Bobbitt 
said he has evidence that Duffy ignored numerous reports of inmate abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"If the sheriff condoned or encouraged the mistreatment of San Diego County 
Jail prisoners and projected this to the commanding officers of the San Diego 
County Sheriff's Department, it would be relevant to how Captain Bobbitt 
proceeded to investigate allegations of abuse," Bobbitt wrote. 
</P>
<P>
It is this statement that Duffy and Mayer said raises the question of whether 
Maudie Bobbitt ignored or overlooked charges of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"Everett Bobbitt is saying that his wife didn't do the type of investigation 
that she should have done because she thought her boss condoned abuse, and so 
she looked the other way," Mayer said. "That's the Nuremberg defense. Looking 
the other way because you thought you were supposed to is not a defense." 
</P>
<P>
In his prepared statement, Duffy said Maudie Bobbitt "may well have 
deliberately refused to investigate allegations of inmate abuse brought to her 
attention because she perceived that (this oversight) was somehow what was 
expected of her." 
</P>
<P>
Bobbitt contends that, although Duffy ignored reports of abuse, his wife 
conducted numerous investigations. 
</P>
<P>
"Sheriff Duffy is a liar," he said. "He wouldn't know the truth if he saw it. 
My wife recognized that John Duffy was not serious in investigating abuse. I 
have proof that she did a lot better job." 
</P>
<P>
Late Friday, Bobbitt said he would file a $10-million lawsuit against Duffy, 
Drown and Cmdr. Myron Klippert, Maudie Bobbitt's immediate supervisor, alleging 
political retaliation, sexual discrimination and the intentional infliction of 
emotional injury. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Bobbitt told the Civil Service Commission that his wife was singled 
out for discipline, although many of her male counterparts, whose jails were 
also reported to have abuse problems, were not. 
</P>
<P>
Mayer said the internal affairs investigation also would include Bobbitt's 
claims of "gender discrimination." He said it was premature of Bobbitt to file 
a lawsuit alleging political retaliation or sexual discrimination because the 
internal affairs investigation has not yet been started. 
</P>
<P>
During this Wednesday's hearing on Maudie Bobbitt's appeal of her suspension, 
Mayer said he will formally withdraw Bobbitt's 35-day suspension and repay the 
money she was owed during that time. Everett Bobbitt estimated the amount to be 
about $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
Mayer said the Sheriff's Department will then begin the investigation. He said 
nobody has told Everett Bobbitt that his wife will be fired. 
</P>
<P>
Everett Bobbitt said that, under the legal procedures that govern Civil Service 
Commission hearings, any investigation of his wife has to end once Duffy 
rescinds the suspension. He said his wife cannot then be tried on the same 
charges of overlooking inmate abuse. 
</P>
<P>
But Duffy suggested in his statement that Maudie Bobbitt may face a different 
charge, one that will determine whether "she engaged in willful and deliberate 
misconduct." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy said he had no choice but to reopen his investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since the original internal affairs investigation was completed, I have 
been operating on the belief that Capt. Bobbitt merely neglected her duties in 
a manner which was well below the performance standards expected of a sheriff's 
captain," Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, nearly two years later on the eve of her appeal, her attorney/husband 
publicly says that she may well have deliberately refused to investigate 
allegations of inmate abuse."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY; 
</P>
<P>
ANIMAL RESEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the sensitive animal rights issue continuously surfacing, voters may read 
too much into Proposition C on the Nov. 6 ballot. Remember, this advisory 
measure asks only whether the county of San Diego should continue to provide 
pound animals for medical research. 
</P>
<P>
We believe that the current county policy of selling a small number of animals 
to UC San Diego School of Medicine for research is acceptable, morally and 
practically. 
</P>
<P>
When the rhetoric is set aside, the essential facts are these: UCSD performs 
valuable medical research that could lead to progress in fighting diseases 
afflicting both humans and animals. While researchers use some animals bred 
specifically for research, certain experiments require older animals or ones 
subjected to the real world. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD purchased only a few hundred of the 24,000 animals brought to county 
shelters over a recent 12-month period. Before an animal is made available for 
research, it is held to allow pet owners to claim it. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the pound animals used by the medical school would be euthanized 
anyway. If pound animals are made unavailable, they will die along with 
additional ones bred for research. More animals will perish, not fewer. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the system claim that animals used in research inevitably suffer, 
physically and emotionally, more than those euthanized. We are not insensitive 
to that pain, but must conclude that, on balance, the present system is the 
best resolution of a difficult situation. 
</P>
<P>
We recommend a yes vote on Proposition C.

SAN DIEGAN WINS TOP PRIZE IN POLISH CHOPIN COMPETITION

<P>
San Diego resident Kevin Kenner won the top prize awarded today in the 
prestigious 12th International Frederic Chopin Piano Competition. 
</P>
<P>
The jury awarded no first prize, apparently agreeing with the audience that the 
competitors performed with technical skill but not genius. Deliberations 
continued for three hours past the scheduled announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Kenner, an American studying in Hanover, Germany, was awarded the Silver Medal 
with a prize of $2,100. 
</P>
<P>
"I am happy and relieved," said Kenner, 27, as he was hugged by his wife and 
his teacher in the lobby of the National Philharmonic Hall, where the 
three-week competition was staged. 
</P>
<P>
Yukio Yokoyama, a 19-year-old Tokyo native studying in Paris, won the 
third-prize Bronze Medal, with a prize of $1,575. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth places went to Corrado Rollero, 21, of Italy, and Margarita Shevchenko, 
23, of the Soviet Union. Fifth places were awarded to Anna Malikova, 25, of the 
Soviet Union and Takako Takahashi, 26, of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The judges awarded no prizes for the best performance of a Chopin mazurka or 
for the concertos. The award for the best polonaise went to Kenner and Wojciech 
Switala, 23, who withdrew from the third round after being the only Pole to 
reach the semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Kenner, born in Coronado, studied with a Polish-American teacher before 
attending the Peabody Conservatory of Music in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
He called the judge's withholding of a first prize "disappointing" but "very 
strange and very interesting." 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time that Kenner, a semifinalist in the 1989 Van Cliburn 
International Piano Competition, has been deemed to play unemotionally. In an 
April review of a San Diego State University recital by Kenner, Times classical 
music critic Kenneth Herman wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"Kenner's brilliance in the 'Grand Polonaise' was cold and impersonal, without 
a hint of passion, and eliminating passion from Chopin is like purging the 
blues of melancholy." 
</P>
<P>
The competition has been staged since 1927 to honor Chopin, the composer born 
in 1810 near Warsaw. He studied at the Warsaw Conservatory but settled in 
Paris, where he gave his first concert in 1831 and went on to use his Romantic 
compositions to establish the piano as a solo instrument. 
</P>
<P>
He never returned to his homeland but recalled Poland in his polonaises and 
mazurkas. He died of tuberculosis in 1849 and was buried in Paris. His heart, 
however, was interred in a Warsaw church, and Poles embrace him as a national 
hero. 
</P>
<P>
The 12th staging of the competition by the Chopin Society in Warsaw attracted 
nearly 140 competitors. The seven finalists performed Chopin's concertos in E 
minor or F minor on Thursday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The winner was to be announced by the jury at 11 p.m. Friday, but was not 
presented until about 2 a.m. today. While waiting, the anxious contestants 
mingled with autograph-seekers and an international audience of Chopin 
enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
Only one American has ever won the first prize, Garrick Ohlsson in 1970, and 
none has placed second.

For youthful gang members, the ways of the street have an imperative all their 
own, often at odds with the self-discipline needed to get an education. The 
Anaheim Union High School District has a program that is successfully enticing 
some of them back into the education system against heavy odds. 
</P>
<P>
Its victories to date are modest, with small class sizes and small numbers of 
students managing to turn their lives around. But as one teacher says of her 
class, "If we can help four of these nine students, that's four more students 
back in school." 
</P>
<P>
The program allows students who have dropped out of high school to study at 
their own pace and earn credits by meeting twice a week during after-school 
hours. The very idea of Project SAY, which is an acronym for Save A Youth, says 
something about the power of education to rescue lives. There are cases where 
members of as many as three rival gangs find themselves in the same classroom, 
but participants are made to understand that they are to leave their colors and 
turf battles outside.

Just getting gang members into the program can be trying. Some students are 
diverted by the problems of their lives, or they lack motivation. Others simply 
are afraid to cross gang lines to attend classes. Undaunted, the program 
director combs the barrio to recruit candidates. 
</P>
<P>
It's a tough-minded approach to a tough world. For its commitment to this 
valuable project, Anaheim deserves encouragement and support.

With eight different players rushing for a total of 218 yards and quarterback 
Steve Walker passing for two touchdowns, Newport Harbor defeated University, 
21-7, in a Sea View League game Friday night at Davidson Field. 
</P>
<P>
The Sailors (5-2, 1-1) took the opening kickoff and drove 63 yards in 11 plays 
to take a 6-0 lead on a seven-yard touchdown pass from Walker to Branon 
Coluccio. 
</P>
<P>
Walker threw only eight passes, completing six for 72 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Walker didn't have to throw much considering the damage the Sailors did on the 
ground. Newport Harbor averaged more than five yards per rush, led by Russell 
Olshefski's 84 yards on 16 carries, and Marc Tagliaeferri's 77 yards in 10 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
"This season, teams haven't been able to run much against us," University Coach 
Mark Cunningham said, "but for some reason, we couldn't stop Newport Harbor 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
University's lone offensive highlight came in the third quarter when the 
Trojans (2-5, 0-2) marched 80 yards in 13 plays to score on a Marc Walker 
one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
"We were fortunate to get a win tonight," Newport Harbor Coach Jeff Brinkley 
said. "We got sloppy in the second half and we can't make mistakes and still 
expect to win because we face Tustin next week." MICHAEL ITAGAKI

DRAMATIC INTERCEPTION PRESERVES ESPERANZA VICTORY

Esperanza High School placed its faith in defense, which proved to be a wise 
decision. But it was a close call. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs survived a frantic final drive to defeat Loara, 12-7, Friday in an 
Empire League game at Glover Stadium. The Saxons got as close as the Esperanza 
25-yard line, but came up short on time, yards and their final pass. 
</P>
<P>
After driving from its own one-yard line in the final three minutes, Loara 
quarterback Charles Gipson's last pass ended up in the arms of defensive back 
Derek Reeves with nine seconds left. The clock ran out, the Aztecs celebrated 
and Esperanza Coach Gary Meek let out a deep sigh. 
</P>
<P>
"All I kept saying to myself was, 'Run the clock, run the clock,' " Meek said. 
"It was a long three minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Just before the final drive, the Aztecs appeared on the verge of clinching the 
game. Esperanza had a first and goal at the three, but gained only two yards in 
three plays. On fourth and goal from inside the one, fullback Mark Parlin was 
stopped for no gain and Loara took possession. 
</P>
<P>
From there, Gipson took the Saxons (3-4, 1-1) to the verge of victory. He 
completed three passes on the drive, including a screen to Shawn Easter, who 
bobbed and weaved for 27 yards and a first down on the 25. 
</P>
<P>
After an incompletion, Gipson lofted a pass to Dan Bokelman, who was 
double-covered. The ball was short and Derek Reaves came back to make his sixth 
interception of the season and was promptly mobbed by teammates. 
</P>
<P>
The victory puts the Aztecs (7-0, 2-0) in good position to win their first 
league title since 1986. They have already beaten Los Alamitos and Loara, their 
toughest challengers, and have only Cypress, El Dorado and Katella left. 
</P>
<P>
None of those three teams has a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell you, Loara is a tough, tough, team," Meek said. "They did a good job of 
keeping us out of the end zone most of the game." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs got inside the Loara 10 twice in the first half, but came away with 
the minimum -- two field goals by Clay King. 
</P>
<P>
By halftime, the Loara defense was in complete control. Esperanza had 69 total 
yards and only 10 yards passing. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza quarterback Keith McDonald completed only one of nine passes and was 
intercepted twice. 
</P>
<P>
The Saxons' lone score came after a 56-yard completion to John Karner, which 
gave Loara a first down on the Aztec 24. 
</P>
<P>
Three plays later, Gipson threw a swing pass to Easter, who dodged one defender 
for an eight-yard touchdown pass. Loara led, 7-6, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza scored on its first possession of the second half, driving 80 yards 
in 14 plays. McDonald threw a three-yard pass to Reid Pullen for the touchdown.

TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Cypress tailback Byran Dawson gained 64 of his 124 rushing yards and scored two 
touchdowns in the fourth quarter to lead the Centurions to a 15-7 victory over 
El Dorado in an Empire League game. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Tim Snowden completed 19 of 25 passes for 288 yards and three touchdowns in 
just over three quarters to lead Mission Viejo to a 40-20 South Coast League 
decision over San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
LATE HEROICS 
</P>
<P>
Estancia stopped Laguna Beach running back Jason Levinson on a two-point 
conversion run with 2:20 to play to preserve a 21-20 Pacific Coast League 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
ODDS AND ENDS 
</P>
<P>
Item from the Tustin Booster club newsletter, inviting fans to the post-game 
party: 
</P>
<P>
". . . It's your only opportunity to meet the Coaches during the season -- at 
least the only time they appear to be mellow." 
</P>
<P>
After Esperanza's Clay King kicked a field goal in the first quarter for a 3-0 
lead, the Aztec band began chanting, "Na-na-na-na, hey-hey-hey, goodbye." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't quite that easy. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs needed an interception by Derek Reaves in the final 10 seconds to 
hold on to a 12-7 Empire League victory over Loara. 
</P>
<P>
NOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita, which defeated Santa Maria 20-12, used three buses to go to 
Santa Maria and all three broke down en route. Originally the school had two 
buses, but one broke down in Carson and another bus had to replace it. The 
replacement bus broke down as well as the other original bus. Santa Margarita 
left for its game at 10 a.m. and did not arrive until 7 p.m. at Santa Maria, 
which is about 30 miles south of San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
ON THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
"Having Tim herewas one of the reasons we were so jittery in the first half. 
The locker room was pretty teary before the game. It has been a bad week for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Roark, Brethren coach, after his players wore patches on their jerseys 
in honor of teammate Tim Nichol, a running back who suffered a torn hear valve 
in a game last week. Nichol was hospitalized last weekend for observation and 
was released early this week. He was on the sidelines for Friday night's 17-14 
victory over Orange Lutheran.

Savanna High School and Brea-Olinda High School each had three prime scoring 
opportunities but were stopped short of the goal line and played to a 7-7 tie 
in front of about 2,000 homecoming fans in Orange League football action Friday 
at Brea-Olinda High School. 
</P>
<P>
Brea (1-0-1, 4-2-1) fumbled at the Savanna three as the first quarter came to a 
close. 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of the first half, Brea was on the Savanna nine only to turn the 
ball over again. Hien Nguyen intercepted quarterback Jason Luevanos' pass in 
the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Brea's last chance came with five seconds left when Marco Hernandez missed a 
25-yard field goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna had its chances as well. The Rebels (3-2-2, 0-1-1) were stopped on a 
fourth and one at the Brea four early in the third quarter. Savanna then 
fumbled into the Brea end zone, and the Wildcats' Marc Feine fell on the ball 
for a touchback. 
</P>
<P>
With 2:22 to play, Feine recovered another Savanna fumble at the Brea six-yard 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Brea took a 7-0 lead early in the first quarter, driving 78 yards in six plays 
after the opening kickoff. The drive was capped by Luevanos' one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna came back to tie it on a five-yard run by Jeff Ragos with 4:09 left in 
the first half. KEN HILL

Ryan McEvoy passed for 212 yards Friday night as Costa Mesa High School easily 
defeated Pacific Coast League rival Century, 21-6, at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, the Centurions were on their own 29 when quarterback Rick 
Odoardi (five of nine for 177 yards) was intercepted by David Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
McEvoy pulled off a quarterback sneak for 17 yards, which set up Jermaine 
Jackson's 12-yard run into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, with the Centurions leading, 6-0, Jackson (12 carries, 68 
yards) scored again, running 11 yards. A pass from McEvoy to Quoc Pham (eight 
receptions, 64 yards) gave the Centurions a two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
Odoardi completed five of nine passes for 177 yards and threw two 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams are 3-4, 1-1 in league play. MARGIE LUCK

FAILED TWO-POINT CONVERSION ATTEMPT SAVES ESTANCIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Estancia High School linebacker Taro Miyazawa led the right side of a defensive 
line that stopped Laguna Beach running back Jason Levinson a yard short of a 
two-point conversion Friday night, ending a fourth-quarter comeback by the 
Artists and sealing the Eagles' 21-20 Pacific Coast League victory at Laguna 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Perry had scored on a one-yard touchdown run with 2:20 to play, all but 
eliminating Estancia's 21-7 fourth-quarter lead, and Laguna Beach Coach Lyman 
Olney decided to go for two points and the victory. 
</P>
<P>
But Levinson's off-tackle run was stopped short, and Estancia ran out the clock 
after recovering Laguna Beach's subsequent onside kick attempt. 
</P>
<P>
The Artists' comeback was led by wide receiver Eric Fegraus, who caught a 
76-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Morgan Lanchantin to cut the deficit to 
seven points with 10 minutes left and a key 37-yard pass from Lanchantin during 
the 80-yard drive that ended with Perry's touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Sandro and David Hong led the Eagles (2-5, 1-1). Sandro ran for 158 yards 
and a touchdown in 27 carries, and Hong gained 95 yards and a touchdown on 10 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach is 2-5, 0-2.

Bolsa Grande Coach Bill Holst said it was homecoming that did it for the 
Matadors, inspiring them to their second Garden Grove league victory, 13-10, 
over Garden Grove High School. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gone nuts all week long," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our kids came ready to play. Our defense was superb. They watched (Garden 
Grove) films all week, so they knew what to expect." 
</P>
<P>
Bolsa Grande might not have expected to win after fumbling five times -- 
although it recovered three of them -- and throwing two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Matadors won, thanks to Maurice Wilson's game-winning, 75-yard 
touchdown run with 9:36 left. The extra-point attempt failed, but Bolsa Grande 
(3-4, 2-2) held off Garden Grove (3-4, 2-2). 
</P>
<P>
Bolsa Grande fell behind, 7-0, in the first quarter after Simon Fuentes hit 
Jason Baca with a 35-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors tied the score in the third quarter, when quarterback Bryan 
Taylor's 44-yard run set up a three-yard touchdown run by Marcus Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove's Adrian Ioja missed a 30-yard field goal attempt, but seemed to 
redeem himself with a 26-yard kick with 10:11 left in the game before Maurice 
Wilson's run turned the lead into a loss. HEATHER SMALLEY

Randy Karliner played well, but Ocean View High's offensive line couldn't 
penetrate a strong Marina defense in the Seahawks' 17-7 loss Friday at 
Westminster High School. 
</P>
<P>
Karliner, sacked six times and intercepted once for a Marina touchdown, 
completed 12 of 28 passes for 193 yards for Ocean View (4-2-1, 2-1 in league 
play). 
</P>
<P>
He also completed a 34-yard touchdown pass to Jeff Bush in the final 1 minute 
41 seconds of the game and carried 15 times for 73 of Ocean View's 155 yards 
rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Marina's Ingmar Northcott sacked Karliner three times unassisted, and assisted 
on two more. Marina (5-2-1, 2-1), which only executed 14 plays in the first 
half, took its first possession at its 20 after Ocean View's Ron Lightner 
missed a 38-yard field goal with 6:24 left in the first quarter. Shawn Fulford, 
who rushed for 102 of Marina's 164 yards, had a 45-yard run during this 
nine-play drive. He scored from the one with 2:39 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, Dan Armstrong's 39-yard field goal gave Marina a 10-0 
lead with 8:16 to play. Three plays after the ensuing kick, Chad Henderson 
picked off Karliner's pass at the Ocean View 23 and ran it into the end zone in 
the final 7:35. BOB BORSUM

Dominguez High School handed Fountain Valley its seventh consecutive loss, 
44-30, Friday in a nonleague game. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley (0-7), playing before a homecoming crowd of 3,000, led, 20-16, 
at halftime, but 28 second-half points by Dominguez (5-2) put the game away. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez scored first on a 13-yard run by James Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
With seconds left in the quarter, Fountain Valley's Mike Pecen intercepted a 
pass at the Dominguez 35 and ran it back for a tying touchdown. Fountain 
Valley's Brian Williams scored the game's next touchdown on a 41-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez halfback Lavelle Townsend took the ensuing kickoff 99 yards for a 
touchdown, but the point-after attempt failed. Dominguez took a 16-14 lead on a 
field goal, but with 3:29 left in the half, Fountain Valley's Marcos Diaz 
caught a 19-yard pass for a touchdown and a 20-16 halftime lead. VINCE AGUL

NEW GOALIE DOESN'T HELP STRUGGLING GULLS BREAK THE ICE

The expansion San Diego Gulls, winless since capturing their first game in the 
International Hockey League, hoped to turn things around with the acquisition 
of former NHL goalie Glen Hanlon earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't quite work like that Friday at the Indianapolis Fairgrounds Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
The Indianapolis Ice defeated the Gulls, 6-1, in front of 3,190 fans. 
</P>
<P>
"(Hanlon) didn't get too much support," Gulls Coach Mike O'Connell said. "But 
you need big saves to win, and we didn't get that." 
</P>
<P>
Hanlon, who began the year with the Detroit Red Wings, saved 16 shots, but 
allowed the Ice (3-2) to score for the first time in three games only 1:29 into 
the game. Martin Desjardins scored the first of his two goals off assists from 
Marty Nanne and Owen Lessard. Sean Williams, who had only one goal in four 
games, scored a hat trick, the final goal on a power play in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Jones scored the lone goal for the Gulls (1-4-1), who have outshot their 
opponent in every game, including 23-22 against the Ice, the defending IHL 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
"Just mental mistakes again," O'Connell said. "The mistakes we're trying to 
correct are still being made." 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls play in Fort Wayne, Ind., tonight, before returning to the Sports 
Arena for a game Tuesday against the Phoenix Roadrunners.

EL CAMINO REAL SHUTS DOWN KENNEDY, 20-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lest anyone suspect that El Camino Real High's upset win over San Fernando last 
week was a fluke, the Conquistadores on Friday night provided more evidence 
that they are for real in a convincing 20-0 win at Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Conquistadore running back Ryan Marine ran 16 times for 139 yards and a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Evan Howland added 30 yards in 11 carries. 
</P>
<P>
The win kept El Camino Real (4-1, 3-0) unbeaten in Northwest Valley Conference 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Playing before a homecoming crowd, Kennedy's spread offense looked like it was 
spread too thin. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Mike McMullen completed only 11 of 33 attempts for 80 yards and 
threw two interceptions. Running back Ontiwaun Carter returned to the lineup 
after missing a week because of a bladder infection. After being held to 45 
yards in 18 carries, he might just as well have stayed in bed. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars finished with 139 yards in offense. 
</P>
<P>
"Those guys are tough," Kennedy Coach Bob Francola said in an understatement. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real gave an early indication of how the game would go, scoring on 
its first possession. In what was to become a familiar sight, Marine ran 
straight up the middle behind center Troy Snider and guards Juan Hernandez and 
William Manning. El Camino Real ground out a 12-play, 73-yard drive with Marine 
scoring from the one. 
</P>
<P>
A few plays later, the Conquistadore defense made its mark, forcing Kennedy 
wide receiver Jimmy Rodriguez to fumble and recovering at the Cougars' 18-yard 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Howland finished a short drive by diving in from the one. After a missed 
conversion, El Camino Real's second of the game, the Conquistadores led, 12-0. 
</P>
<P>
By halftime, Kennedy had only 57 yards in offense.

A NOSE FOR THE GOAL LINE;

<P>
NORTHRIDGE LINEMAN SILA SAVORS 33-YARD TOUCHDOWN RETURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heaven hath no joy like a lineman who has scored a touchdown, which is one 
reason why Alo Sila stood near midfield last Saturday at Southern Utah State's 
Coliseum with a smile that seemed to span the distance between goal posts. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge had just defeated Southern Utah State to assume first 
place in the Western Football Conference and Sila had produced the Matadors' 
most pivotal points. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 17-17, early in the fourth quarter, Sila intercepted a 
pass by Southern Utah State's Brad Matthews and returned it 33 yards for a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The play triggered Northridge's 34-24 victory and helped stretch the Matadors' 
win streak to a school-record five games heading into today's 7 p.m. WFC 
matchup with Cal State Sacramento at North Campus Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
For Sila, a 6-foot-1, 265-pound nose tackle, scoring a touchdown on an 
interception is like a pitcher hitting a game-winning grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
Make that an American League pitcher. In the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
When Sila reached the end zone, was anybody in the stadium happier? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," CSUN Coach Bob Burt said. "The coach." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't only that Sila scored. It was how he had scored. 
</P>
<P>
The pass had been drilled right at him, but he made a clean catch and reacted 
with the instincts of a running back. He tucked the ball under his arm and 
high-tailed it into the end zone, scoring untouched. 
</P>
<P>
"He went," said an obviously impressed Kenny Vaughn, a Matador linebacker. "He 
was movin.' " 
</P>
<P>
From a few who witnessed Sila's runback, Burt has heard lighthearted 
suggestions that he play the stocky junior from San Jose at fullback in certain 
situations. Said Burt: "We kind of like him where he is." 
</P>
<P>
With good reason. Sila (pronounced SEE-la) is among the team leaders with 23 
tackles, including nine for losses. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, one position change in a season is enough. 
</P>
<P>
At San Jose City College, Sila was an outside linebacker. His specialty was the 
same as it is now -- rushing the quarterback. Sila is second among Northridge 
players with four sacks. 
</P>
<P>
"We recruited him knowing nose tackle was going to be his position and that it 
was going to be just a matter of him learning to play there," Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
Sila was happy just to be playing at all. He played in fewer than half of San 
Jose's games last season because he quit the team after a series of 
disagreements with an assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, based in part on the recommendation of linebacker Terrell Taylor, 
Sila's former teammate at San Jose, offered him a scholarship anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me on my (recruiting) trip that they wanted me to be a lineman," 
Sila said. "That was OK with me. I felt I could play any position, really. I 
was confident, but it felt different going from standing to a three-point or 
four-point stance." 
</P>
<P>
Sila has bench-pressed 455 pounds and has all the necessary physical attributes 
to wreak havoc from his new position. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge's basic defense consists of three down linemen and four linebackers. 
"If you're going to play that defense, you've got to have a good nose tackle," 
Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor and Vaughn, the team's inside linebackers, lead the team in tackles and 
are quick to credit the play of Sila and tackles Tom Berry and Eric Ahola. 
</P>
<P>
"With our front line, there aren't too many times (blockers) get back there to 
us," Vaughn said. "When they double- or triple-team Alo, that just frees us up 
to make the tackles." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Sila was triple-teamed on the play in which he made the interception 
against Southern Utah State. He bounced from center to guard to guard before he 
saw fullback Scott Firestone release out of the backfield. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting like the former linebacker he is, Sila slipped off a block right into 
Matthews' passing lane. 
</P>
<P>
"Good players do that," Burt said. "They take it upon themselves to make the 
big play when you need it most." 
</P>
<P>
It was the first touchdown of Sila's football career. 
</P>
<P>
"What could be any sweeter?" Sila was asked. 
</P>
<P>
Sila shook his head and shrugged. An answer came to him. 
</P>
<P>
"A championship," he said.

VENTURA CROSSES UP BUENA IN VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura High Coach Harvey Kochel never claimed to be an offensive wizard. Just 
line up, fellas, and run at them. 
</P>
<P>
"We really don't have a lot of plays," Kochel said. "It's that the ones we 
have, the kids understand them. And if it's there, we do the job." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura has used that philosophy to become the area's biggest offensive threat, 
adding 397 yards during a 27-20 win over Buena in a Channel League game Friday 
in front of more than 6,000 at Larrabee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura diverts attention to its running game, which averages 266 yards a game, 
then surprises the defense with the pass. And Friday, that happened to be a 
75-yard pass from Trevor Rumsey to Tito Holquin that extended a 21-20 lead with 
4 minutes 48 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Buena, which had watched Ventura sophomore Derek Swafford score on runs of 72 
and 47 yards in the first half, adjusted its defense to thwart the run, so 
Kochel ordered Ventura's seventh pass of the night on third and nine at the 
Cougars' 25-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't run, so we had to do something," Kochel said. 
</P>
<P>
And it was something. Holquin caught the ball alone at midfield and sprinted 
untouched into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"They had those two long runs (from Swafford), and we were supposed to make the 
adjustment for that pass, but didn't," Buena Coach Rick Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Ventura (5-1-1, 3-0-1 in league play) did not secure the victory until 
Buena's ensuing drive ended at Ventura's 14. Buena (2-5, 2-2), aided by Chuck 
Mullaney's 35-yard run, had first down at the 20 but came up empty when Mike 
Dexter's pass fell incomplete in the end zone with 1:41 left. 
</P>
<P>
For Buena, it was typical of a second half in which the Bulldogs wasted two 
scoring opportunities because of interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"We had our chances," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
And, for the most part, the Bulldogs took advantage of them. They led, 20-14, 
at halftime on a 74-yard run by freshman George Keiaho (10 carries for 108 
yards) as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
But in the second half Ventura, which gained 307 yards rushing, began to wear 
Buena down. Swafford, who gained a career-best 201 yards in 19 carries, scored 
on a two-yard run with 5:25 left in the third quarter. Rumsey's conversion gave 
the Cougars a 21-20 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt if we had enough snaps, we'd get the ball into the end zone," Kochel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura established that mind-set when, on a third-and-one play, Swafford 
sprinted 72 yards from the Cougars' 28. Rumsey's conversion gave Ventura a 7-0 
lead with 10:03 left in the first quarter. Buena answered with consecutive 
touchdowns, the first a two-yard run by Mullaney with 6:20 left in the first 
quarter. The key play of the drive was Dexter's 18-yard run on third and nine 
from Ventura's 31. 
</P>
<P>
Then Buena put together a 72-yard drive that Mullaney capped with a 12-yard 
run. The march was kept alive by Rumsey's 20-yard completion to Anthony Morales 
on a fake punt. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura countered with another long touchdown run by Swafford, this one from 47 
yards with 1:08 left in the half. Rumsey's conversion tied the score, 14-14. 
</P>
<P>
Buena next began on its 21 only 1:05 before intermission, then faced first and 
16 at its 26 with three seconds left. But Keiaho broke several tackles on a 
74-yard run that gave Buena a 20-14 halftime lead.

SAN FERNANDO BREEZES TO VICTORY OVER TAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taft High Coach Tom Stevenson is the kind of guy who would wear shorts in a 
blizzard. Friday night, he did just that. 
</P>
<P>
In an unseasonably cold windstorm that was enough to chill the hardiest of 
souls, San Fernando won in -- appropriately enough -- a blowout. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers scored twice in the first five minutes and poured it on in the 
second half of a 37-0 victory in a Northwest Valley Conference game at San 
Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
These were not the winds of change: It marked the third shutout of the season 
for San Fernando, which has not lost to Taft since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a good, old-fashioned Eastside . . . whipping," Stevenson said. "They 
dominated us from start to finish. It was embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando (4-2, 2-1 in league play) was led by running back Leonice Brown, a 
senior transfer from Crespi who scored a career-high three touchdowns on runs 
of 19, three and 21 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Brown finished with a game-high 79 yards in 13 carries. Backfield mates 
LaKarlos Townsend and Will Taylor added 60 and 56 yards, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, it was the unselfish Tiger trio that led the way. Brown said that 
he didn't mind sharing the load one bit. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter how many yards we get," Brown said. "As long as we win, who 
cares who has the most yards?" 
</P>
<P>
In this case, it was Brown's younger brother, Johnnie, whose yardage won't show 
up in the offensive totals. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 15-0, San Fernando applied the coup de grace with 5 minutes 53 seconds 
left in the third quarter. Taft (3-2, 2-1) drove inside the Tiger 10, but the 
drive stalled and Stevenson sent in the field-goal crew. Kicker Carlos 
Mansilla's 19-yard attempt struck one of his linemen and Johnnie Brown scooped 
up the loose ball and raced 86 yards for a touchdown and a 23-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"That was tight down there," San Fernando Coach Tom Hernandez said. "That could 
have turned it around. But we make the big play and take it in. It was tight, 
real tight." 
</P>
<P>
Thereafter, Taft came undone. 
</P>
<P>
Brown scored on a three-yard run with 8:52 remaining and from 12 yards with 
3:25 left. 
</P>
<P>
Taft, which lost five fumbles, was held to 90 yards. Tailback Darnell Hendricks 
gained 39 yards in 14 carries. San Fernando gained 235 yards, 195 on the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
A 25-yard "punt" return by Townsend gave San Fernando the ball on its own 27 in 
the first quarter. Taft, heading into a strong head wind, elected to have 
Mansilla kick a line drive out of field-goal formation. 
</P>
<P>
On the first play, Taylor broke loose and scored for a 6-0 lead with 9:50 
remaining in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Taft didn't do much better the next time it got its hands on the ball, mainly 
because it never got its hands on the ball. Quarterback Karlon Mack fumbled the 
snap from center on first and 10 from the Toreador 28, and San Fernando's 
Anthony Murray recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Three plays later, Leonice Brown took a pitch around right end for a 19-yard 
touchdown, giving San Fernando a 12-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando's Jose Servin kicked a 40-yard field goal into the wind to give 
the Tigers a 15-0 lead with 8:20 left in the half.

CANYON THWARTS ANTELOPE VALLEY ON LATE SCORE, 16-14;

<P>
A week after losing a Golden League game for only the second time in Coach 
Harry Welch's nine-year tenure, Canyon High appeared destined for another 
setback late in a game Friday night at Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But Canyon quarterback Kevin Bialas scored on a one-yard sneak with 1 minute 19 
seconds remaining and the Cowboys survived a last-gasp Antelope drive to win, 
16-14. 
</P>
<P>
Bialas' plunge capped an 11-play, 80-yard drive that consumed almost five 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley's Eugene Dreher, however, blocked Matt George's point-after 
attempt -- Dreher's seventh block of the season -- to keep alive Antelope 
Valley's upset hopes. 
</P>
<P>
With no timeouts remaining, Antelope Valley (1-6, 0-1) returned the ensuing 
kickoff to its 36-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jacob Munksdaard completed passes of 11 and eight yards to Rodney 
Flakes and Freddy Edwards to move the ball to the Cowboy 45. 
</P>
<P>
With 34 seconds remaining, Munksdaard scrambled for 11 yards and Chelsa Blanks 
plunged ahead for four to the Canyon 30. Antelope Valley's field-goal team 
rushed onto the field, but time expired before kicker Peter Holt could attempt 
a 47-yard kick. 
</P>
<P>
With Antelope Valley trailing, 10-7, Edwards picked off a Bialas pass and 
returned it 43 yards for a touchdown to put the Antelopes ahead, 14-10, with 
10:32 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
On Canyon's next series, Edwards recovered a fumble at the Antelope Valley 41 
with slightly more than seven minutes to play. But Canyon (6-1, 1-1 in league 
play) forced a punt less than a minute later and began the decisive drive. 
</P>
<P>
Bialas completed 11 of 23 passes for 105 yards and tailback Mike Torres rushed 
for 124 yards in 14 carries before leaving the game early in the fourth because 
of an injured knee. 
</P>
<P>
With tailback David McDivitt sidelined because of a deep thigh bruise and 
backup Mike Santos also out because of an injury, Canyon relied on Jason 
Brenner and Scott Blade to pick up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
Blade and Brenner carried on seven of the 11 plays during the winning drive. 
</P>
<P>
"If anybody wants to give an orthopedic surgeon good business, he should become 
a Canyon running back," said Welch, whose team lost to Quartz Hill last week. 
"We had absolutely nobody left. We were down to the water boys." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon took a 7-0 lead 1:02 into the game when Torres raced into the end zone 
from 19 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, who accounted for 104 of Antelope Valley's 160 rushing yards, blasted 
up the middle on a 50-yard run to tie the score, 7-7, with 6:59 left in the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
George kicked a 26-yard field goal with seven seconds left in the half to put 
Canyon ahead, 10-7.

GRANADA HILLS POSTS 3RD SHUTOUT IN A ROW 
</P>

<P>
The mismatch between Granada Hills and Cleveland highs took place -- as 
expected -- Friday night as the Highlanders rolled to a 33-0 Northwest Valley 
Conference victory at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills' Brett Washington ran wild -- as expected -- gaining 104 yards in 
13 carries and scoring his ninth and 10th touchdowns of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Highlander quarterback Bryan Martin strafed the Cleveland secondary -- as 
expected -- completing 11 of 20 passes for 153 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
And Cleveland Coach Steve Landress was upset afterward -- as expected -- as his 
team fell to 0-4-1, 0-3 in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
"We belong in the (City Section) 3-A (Division)," Landress said of his 4-A 
Division team. "This is a misfortune. I can't believe the district would allow 
this to happen." 
</P>
<P>
It happened, all right. Granada Hills (5-1, 3-0) recorded its third consecutive 
shutout and held Cleveland to 135 yards while amassing 338. Even reserve 
running back Earl Andrews got into the act, racing 59 yards for a fourth-period 
touchdown on his first carry. 
</P>
<P>
About the only bright spot for Cleveland was the running of tailback Ibn Bilal, 
who gained 134 yards in 19 carries in his first start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Bilal was pressed into action because Delvon McDaniel, the starting tailback, 
was playing quarterback in place of the injured Dave Erhardt, who is recovering 
from a separated shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel completed two of eight passes for 10 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Washington scored twice in the first half, lumbering 13 yards for a 
first-period touchdown and 34 yards down the left sideline for a second-quarter 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who struggled a week ago against Reseda, was six of 12 for 68 yards 
passing in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Martin tossed his eighth touchdown pass of the season -- one of eight yards to 
Eric Moss -- as time expired in the first half. Martin also threw a 35-yard 
touchdown pass to Alonzo Finney in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland, meanwhile, could do little right in the first half. The Cavaliers 
fumbled three times, losing one, and McDaniel misfired on all four of his pass 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland, which was held to 31 first-half yards, had four first downs at 
intermission but only one was earned without the aid of a penalty.

Harvard 24, St. Francis 14 -- Harvard scored 21 unanswered points in the second 
half to rally from an 11-point deficit at St. Francis. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard (6-1, 2-0) drove 80 yards, capped by a 13-yard scoring run by Jeremiah 
Aguolu, to cut the deficit to 14-10 at the end of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Saracens took the lead, 17-14, on a 24-yard touchdown run by Kent Dahn. The 
play was set up when Stafford Lee gained 25 yards on a fake punt from the 
Saracen 44. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard finished the scoring when Dahn raced 21 yards late in the fourth 
quarter. Dahn rushed for 77 yards and Harvard quarterback Steve Kezirian 
completed nine of 27 passes for 95 yards. 
</P>
<P>
James Yun intercepted a Kezirian pass and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown 
and a 14-3 third-quarter St. Francis (4-3, 1-1) lead. St. Francis opened the 
scoring on a two-yard touchdown run by Larry Duenas in the first quarter. KEVIN

FIEN'S 3 TOUCHDOWN PASSES LEAD ROYAL TO 28-0 VICTORY

Ryan Fien hit Jeff Creed on scoring passes of 29 and four yards and Tony Liming 
on a 11-yard touchdown throw to lead Royal High to a 28-0 victory over Agoura 
in a Marmonte League game Friday night at Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
The victory kept Royal (6-1, 3-1 in league play) within one game of Thousand 
Oaks and Westlake in the league standings. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura (5-2, 2-2) committed turnovers on four of its first six possessions. The 
other two ended in punts. Altogether, the Chargers had five turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Royal, however, capitalized on only one of the first-half turnovers, suffering 
an interception and a fumble inside the Agoura 10-yard line to erase scoring 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders' first touchdown came on a one-yard plunge by senior running 
back Richard Naranjo late in the first quarter. The score was set up by a 
36-yard run by tailback Robbie Smith, who rushed for 88 yards in 10 carries, 
including 82 yards in six carries in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Fien proceeded to hit Creed with two touchdown passes in the second quarter and 
connected with Liming in the third quarter. Liming also had two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Agoura was again unable to move the ball, facing a brisk 
wind in the third quarter and a 28-0 deficit by the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura's best scoring opportunity came in the third quarter when quarterback 
Sean Fitzgerald faked an option pitch and sprinted 63 yards to the Royal 17. 
However, the Chargers turned the ball over on downs. 
</P>
<P>
Fien, a junior, finished with nine completions in 19 attempts for 164 yards. 
His three touchdown passes give him 12 this season. Creed has six touchdown 
receptions and Liming has five. GREG GUSS

LEE'S 3 TOUCHDOWNS SPARK CRESPI

<TEXT>
<P>
Sophomore running back Torie Lee scored three touchdowns to lead Crespi High to 
a 21-7 Mission League victory over host Chaminade on Friday night in a 
penalty-marred game. 
</P>
<P>
Lee was Crespi's workhorse, gaining 191 yards in 34 carries. 
</P>
<P>
He led off the scoring in the second quarter on a 14-yard pass reception from 
junior quarterback Cody Smith (nine of 15 for 108 yards). 
</P>
<P>
His second touchdown, a one-yard run, capped a 13-play, 61-yard drive to give 
the Celts a 14-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Torie had a very good physical football game for us tonight," Crespi Coach Tim 
Lins said. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi held Chaminade (1-5-1, 0-4) to minus-three yards in offense in the first 
half and 97 in the game. However, the Celts were penalized seven times for 85 
yards in the first half and 15 times for 185 yards in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi (6-1, 3-0 in league play) opened the second half with a nine-play, 
70-yard drive -- capped by Lee's one-yard plunge -- to take a 21-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jeff Meyer, who replaced starter Travis Hall (broken collarbone), 
led the Chaminade offense in the second half. He completed eight of 20 for 91 
yards and one touchdown, a 18-yard toss to junior Mike Sweeney for the game's 
final score. GARY HYNES

Hueneme dominated the second half offensively, but Oxnard quarterback Larry 
Bumpus ran 43 yards on a third-quarter keeper for the game's final score.

<P>
Trailing, 6-0, Oxnard tied the score on a nine-yard run by Dan Duchai in the 
second period. With one second left in the half, Bumpus passed 12 yards to 
tight end Brooke Johnson for a touchdown that gave Oxnard a lead it never lost.

SANTA ANAS EXPECTED TO RETURN ON SUNDAY

Remember last week, when the Santa Ana winds stirred up enough sand and dust to 
clog a lot of folks' nasal passages and make walking close to miserable? 
They're coming back this weekend, most likely on Sunday, and staying through 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a dry, warm, gusty weekend in Orange County," said Ken 
German, a meteorologist for WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
The high today should be in the low 80s most places in the county, but will 
climb to the upper 80s and could reach 90 by Sunday afternoon. The winds will 
blow in a northeasterly direction. 
</P>
<P>
Winds could gust to 25 m.p.h. or more, especially closer to the hills, German 
said. That's generally comparable to last week's Santa Anas, though one report 
showed the wind reaching 50 m.p.h. in several places, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Today's hottest weather is expected to be in the El Toro area, where the high 
is expected to reach 84. Newport Beach is expected to reach no more than 72 
today. German said the winds will also push out the low cloud layer. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana winds fueled major fires in Glendale and Santa Barbara during the 
summer. The Orange County Fire Department sent an assessment team to both of 
those cities, and county fire spokesman Capt. Dan Young said the team made some 
interesting discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
"Homes that nobody thought would ever burn ended up in trouble, even some with 
non-combustible roofs," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
The reason: Some homeowners had not done a good job of creating what the fire 
department calls "defensible space" on their land. 
</P>
<P>
That means keeping lids on garbage cans, clearing roofs of dry leaves, keeping 
tree branches from leaning onto the house or its roof, and making sure that any 
utility wires are clear of branches or debris. 
</P>
<P>
Young explained that in some of the Glendale and Santa Barbara fires, flames 
were able to spread because they reached combustible items in open trash 
containers and then spread to the underside of roofs. 
</P>
<P>
"Even a non-combustible roof, such as tile, has an underlining that is 
combustible," Young said.

When Ronald Reagan campaigned in Orange County for reelection in 1984, he sent 
buses to Leisure World in Laguna Hills so his faithful supporters there could 
be sure to attend. 
</P>
<P>
And when Leisure World celebrated its 25th Anniversary in 1988, then-Senate 
candidate Pete Wilson led the community's parade. 
</P>
<P>
If it were a city, Leisure World would be one of Orange County's smallest. But 
in terms of political clout, it is one of the state's most concentrated pockets 
of activism. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, four of the seven statewide Republican candidates attended a rally in 
Clubhouse 3, which was decked out with campaign placards, red-white-and-blue 
balloons and packed with more than 400 senior citizens by 10 a.m. Under the 
stage, Don Dressen's Leisure World Dixieland Band sounded a chord to announce 
each candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you find the most dedicated Republican activists in the state here," 
said State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) who represents part of 
Leisure World and is now running for lieutenant governor. "They have been the 
backbone of the Republican Party in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was scheduled to attend Friday's rally, but he returned to Washington 
this week for a vote on the federal budget. The others attending were attorney 
general candidate Dan Lungren; Joan Milke Flores, running for secretary of 
state, and Matt Fong, candidate for state controller. 
</P>
<P>
Forget that the average age here is about 73. Last week, the Leisure World 
Democratic Club meeting seemed like a high school pep rally when another 
audience of about 400 turned out and cheered for 85-year-old former California 
Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr. and attorney general candidate Arlo Smith. 
</P>
<P>
There were more people at that gathering alone than at the county Democratic 
Party's recent convention in Anaheim where gubernatorial candidate Dianne 
Feinstein gave the keynote speech. 
</P>
<P>
After Brown's speech, a Democratic organizer asked the audience for $100 
donations, and seven people stood up to respond. Then, for the next 10 minutes, 
nearly 40 people took turns pledging $50 and $25 donations. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when voter apathy is crippling the election process, Leisure World is 
an island of participation. On average, its voter turnout is about 64%, far 
higher even than the rest of Orange County's loyal electorate. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1986 race for governor, Leisure World produced 69% of its voters 
compared to 53% countywide. And in the primary last June, turnout in Leisure 
World was 54% -- almost 13 points higher than the rest of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Like Orange County, Leisure World is decidedly Republican and affluent. There 
are just more than 5,000 Democrats and about twice as many in the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly a large part of the political activity at Leisure World stems from 
the free time that retired residents have to devote to their interests. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, campaign events are scheduled for lunch breaks, evenings or 
weekends. There is hardly any place in the state to find a crowd of 400 people 
on a Friday morning, like there was at Leisure World. 
</P>
<P>
For many residents, political loyalties were also forged in some of the 
country's most traumatic periods, such as World War II or the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
After speaking last week, Brown took questions from the audience, including one 
from a man who said: "I think Democrats have given up on the principles of 
President (Franklin) Roosevelt. Why has there been this retreat?" 
</P>
<P>
Another questioner told Brown: "You remind me of Harry Truman." 
</P>
<P>
It was also a politically educated audience. When Brown misspoke and identified 
Feinstein's husband as "Mr. Feinstein" the audience immediately corrected him: 
"It's Mr. Blum," they said. 
</P>
<P>
"Leisure World is a different type of society than the rest of the world," said 
Herbert Schwartz, president of the Leisure World Republican Club. "You've got a 
bunch of seniors who are fairly affluent and have time to read. It's just not a 
passive audience." 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz, a retired financial investor, said he has voted Republican since 
Roosevelt ran for his third term as president. He has lived in California since 
1963 and moved from Beverly Hills to Leisure World 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Before Leisure World, it was just making a living," said Schwartz, now a 
member of the county's Republican Lincoln Club. "When I moved here, (politics) 
intrigued me and I started getting involved." 
</P>
<P>
Gray power is an increasingly powerful part of the American electorate, 
recently forcing Congress to rewrite part of its deficit reduction proposal 
regarding Medicare funding. 
</P>
<P>
But Leisure World political leaders insist that their voters should not be 
considered a one-issue bloc. Schwartz said there are funding votes for local 
schools that would have failed without Leisure World's support. And the 
community has been active in growth management issues since the area was 
becoming a boom town for housing development. 
</P>
<P>
"You find a cross-section of Americana here," said Marian Miller, past 
president of the Leisure World Republican Club. "We're through raising our 
children and worrying about the financial problems, so that's not the issue. 
But we're more concerned with government because we want good government 
overall." 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest beneficiaries of Leisure World support has been Assemblyman 
Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach). Ferguson barely lost a special election for 
state Senate earlier this year, and he attributed a large part of his close 
finish to Leisure World voters. 
</P>
<P>
"They were about a third of my vote," he said. "They will work for you. They'll 
work telephone banks, they will register voters, they will sit in the shopping 
centers here. The reputation is justly deserved."

JOY OF FATHERHOOD HELD HOSTAGE;

<TEXT>
<P>
Three-year-old Joanne Turner has never seen her father, Jonathon. He has been 
held hostage in Beirut since 1987, shortly before she was born. 
</P>
<P>
But soon, Jonathon (Jesse) Turner may get his first glimpse of his daughter in 
a videotaped family celebration held in his honor, which may be televised 
internationally on Cable News Network within the next few days, a CNN spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a black-and-white dress with a red polka-dot bow in her hair, Joanne 
delivered the message to her father into a television camera: "I love you." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hope and a wish" that he will be able to see the tape, said Turner's 
mother, Estelle Ronneburg. She spoke at a party videotaped at a Santa Ana 
school Friday morning. The taping was organized by an Orange County-based 
philanthropic group called Points of Light. 
</P>
<P>
"Somehow, they will get the tape to Lebanon," said Nancy Fontaine, who 
organizes support activities for the hostages' families. "Somehow, Jesse will 
know that we love him and care." 
</P>
<P>
The celebration, held at Pride Development School, doubled as a birthday party 
for Turner's stepfather, Eugene, who will turn 62 on Tuesday. Preschoolers sang 
and blew out candles on three chocolate cakes. 
</P>
<P>
Jamal Burns, 8, read a message to Turner on behalf of the schoolchildren. "The 
holidays are coming and Joanna and the children of Points of Light hope that 
you are going to be home to make it a wonderful Christmas," he said. "You are 
in our hearts and thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
"We wish that he would come back and see his daughter for the first time," said 
Turner's wife, Badr. "I hope that I can soon be back with Johnny." 
</P>
<P>
Turner, 41, was kidnaped from Beirut University where he was a visiting 
mathematics and computer-science professor. Badr, 39, was then four months 
pregnant with Joanne. Family members said that hostages held with Turner who 
have since been released said he has learned that he has daughter, but knows 
nothing about her. 
</P>
<P>
Badr Turner and her daughter live with his parents in Boise, Idaho, and 
traveled to Orange County this week to attend the Freedoms Foundation at Valley 
Forge annual awards dinner where Fontaine was honored for her work with 
families of hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Fontaine said she decided to organize the party for the Turners "as a 
thank-you." 
</P>
<P>
After singing at the party, the children finger-painted yellow and blue dots on 
a large sign that read, "Jesse, we all want you home." 
</P>
<P>
Estelle Ronneburg said that Joanne "knows she has a daddy and that he can't 
come home yet. She asks about him frequently, but she's not old enough to 
understand what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
Joanne, who was raised in the United Arab Emirates and speaks only Arabic, said 
through her mother that she wants her father back: "I want to hug him. I want 
to touch his beard." 
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, the family took Joanne to Disneyland, where Badr Turner 
said they would see "It's a Small World" and visit one of Joanne's favorite 
characters, Mickey Mouse.

<P>
Two young women were killed in a possibly alcohol-related crash early Friday 
when their car drifted off the road and flew 20 feet into the air before 
landing upside down on a sidewalk, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, Lisa Marie Spicer, 24, of Garden Grove was pronounced dead at the 
scene of the 1:46 a.m. accident, which occurred at the intersection of Newport 
Boulevard and 23rd Street, Costa Mesa Police Lt. Tom Warnack said. 
</P>
<P>
Spicer died instantly when she was run over by a passing motorist who failed to 
see her lying in the road after she had been thrown from her car, Warnack said. 
</P>
<P>
Passenger Toshia Runner, 23, of Huntington Beach died of massive head injuries 
at College Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the two friends, who had known each other for only a short 
time, were returning home from an evening at the Deja Vu nightclub, a popular 
hangout for young adults. 
</P>
<P>
Although investigators said that Spicer apparently had been drinking before the 
accident, it was not known what caused her to drift off the two-lane road as 
she was heading toward the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the accident) is still under investigation," Warnack said. "(But) based on 
witness statements, both driver and passenger appeared to be under the 
influence of alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa Police Lt. Alan Kent said that Spicer and Runner had left the 
nightclub, located at Newport Boulevard and Fairview Road, and headed north on 
Newport Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
A block later, at 23rd Street, Spicer's 1984 gray Camaro drifted onto the 
sidewalk, Kent said. 
</P>
<P>
Before she could regain control, the car rode up a guy wire attached to a 
40-foot-high light pole. The car, which was then about 20 feet in the air, 
flipped upside down and landed on its roof, crushing it and pinning Runner 
inside. The vehicle came to rest on the sidewalk about 15 feet from the pole, 
Kent said. 
</P>
<P>
Spicer was thrown from the Camaro as it skidded to a stop and uprooted a 
signpost. Moments later, as she lay unconscious in the street, the driver of a 
white, 1985 Chevrolet Cavalier swerved to avoid the downed light pole and 
inadvertently ran over Spicer, according to Kent. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, who was not cited, stayed at the scene until police arrived and 
interviewed him. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a traumatic experience for him," Kent said. "He was distraught. This is 
not a hit-and-run situation in any way." 
</P>
<P>
It took a Fire Department rescue team about 20 minutes to free Runner from the 
wreckage and take her to the hospital, Kent said. 
</P>
<P>
Runner's mother, Jeanne Blumer, who learned of her daughter's death at 3:30 
a.m., said that the last time she talked to Runner was earlier in the evening 
when her daughter dropped over to the family's Tustin home for a brief visit 
after attending a mathematics class at Irvine Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
"She came by after . . . class and told me she was going to go out," Blumer 
said. "That was the last time I talked to her." 
</P>
<P>
Blumer, a teacher for the Laguna Beach Unified School District, said the two 
young women met a few months ago when Runner moved into a Huntington Beach 
apartment with a mutual acquaintance.

DESPITE SUIT, GREEK SAYS HE'S RUNNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Council candidate Don Greek said Friday that he will stay in the race 
despite the council's decision this week to sue him because his engineering 
firms did business with the city while he was a public official. 
</P>
<P>
Greek also blamed the City Council for any impropriety, noting that the 
Planning Commission, on which he served for seven years, does not have the 
power to award city contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"We are tired of the abuse," Greek said in an interview. "Now (my opponents) 
are starting rumors that I've dropped out of the race, which is not true. We're 
still running, and we're planning to win." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted 5 to 0 to sue Greek after the Orange County district 
attorney's office began reviewing the contracts with Greek's businesses to see 
if state conflict-of-interest codes had been violated. Greek's firms, Don Greek 
&amp; Associates and DGA Consultants Inc., did at least $104,000 worth of 
business with the city while he was a planning commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
According to a California code, state, county and city employees and officers 
"shall not be financially interested in any contract made by them in their 
official capacity or by any body or board of which they are members."

FEMALE AIDE SUES POLICE DEPARTMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
A second female employee of the Buena Park Police Department has filed a sexual 
harassment suit against the department. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Chaney, an investigative aide who worked as a civilian employee for 
the past seven years, filed the lawsuit this month. Chaney, of Garden Grove, 
alleges that she was so upset by the harassment that she could no longer 
perform her job. 
</P>
<P>
In the suit, Chaney claims that a statement she made in August during an 
internal investigation of another sexual harassment case was copied and 
circulated throughout the department. 
</P>
<P>
"She was so upset she didn't go to work. . . . It was very embarrassing for 
her," said Carrie MacMillin, Chaney's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Chaney was given until Oct. 15 to return to work, and when she didn't, she was 
fired, MacMillin said. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint names Police Chief Richard M. Tefank, Capt. Charles Self, Sgt. 
Jerry Smock and city psychologist Tom Abbott as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Tefank declined comment. "I am not at liberty to comment on any of her 
allegations," he said. When asked if the suit warranted outside investigation, 
Tefank said, "In my opinion, it does not." 
</P>
<P>
Chaney also claims in the lawsuit that officers made comments to her about her 
sex life and that when she went to Abbott for help, he "stated obscenities to 
plaintiff, thereby causing plaintiff additional emotional distress." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Donald L. Bone said the City Council has not yet discussed the matter. 
"Because we, as a group, haven't been fully apprised, it is premature to give 
an answer," Bone said. City Manager Kevin O'Rouke declined to comment on the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
In a case filed earlier this year, former Officer Sandra Jean McClaren alleged 
that she was subjected to sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in January, claims that male officers frequently made sexual 
comments to McClaren that led to her quitting in October, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
MacMillin, who is also representing McClaren, said the case is moving toward a 
trial. LYNDA NATALI

COUNCIL LIKES PLANS FOR GOLF COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Plans to refurbish the Los Alamitos Golf Course were greeted with rave reviews 
this week as the Cypress City Council approved a request from the developer to 
begin renovations. 
</P>
<P>
"It closed a long chapter in our history," Mayor Cecilia L. Age said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all very happy." 
</P>
<P>
Plans unanimously approved by the council Monday call for the overhaul of the 
course, including adding 30 acres of fairways and 11 acres of lakes. The 
18-hole course will even get a new name -- the Cypress Golf Club. Dye Equity 
Inc. of Colorado is overseeing the renovation. The course was recently 
purchased by Fuji Country Co. of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed to allow the developer to construct an interim 
4,500-square-foot clubhouse while a proposal for a permanent site is drawn up. 
Eventually, the golf course is expected to be integrated with the development 
of a hotel complex. However, plans for the hotel are not complete, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents expressed concerns about the cost of playing at the new site, but the 
developer has not released any fee schedules. "There are just too many factors 
involved to determine green fees at this time," Hamlin said. 
</P>
<P>
The course has been a source of controversy since 1986, when developers tried 
to shut it down to build a business park. A plan was approved in April for the 
Los Alamitos Race Course and the adjacent golf course. 
</P>
<P>
The project is scheduled to be completed by January, 1992, officials said.

Golden West College officials plan to celebrate the school's 25th anniversary 
next year in a big way, and a committee has been named to prepare gala events. 
</P>
<P>
Faculty and staff members, alumni, students and community representatives on 
the panel are planning eight months of festivities that will begin in 
September, 1991, committee chairman John Wordes said. 
</P>
<P>
The silver anniversary will be different than the college's 1986-87 celebration 
of its 20th year, said Wordes, who has been on the faculty since the college 
opened in September, 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas the 20-year anniversary focused upon the achievements of faculty and 
alumni, next year's celebration will include the surrounding community, he 
said.JOHN PENNER

7 HONORED FOR SAVING BOY'S LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A team of emergency medical workers received commendations this week for saving 
the life of a 3-year-old Fullerton boy who cut deeply into his own abdomen with 
a circular saw. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council honored two paramedics and other emergency workers who rushed 
to the aid of Ryan Galvan, who was nearly cut in two in the July 17 accident at 
his parents' home. 
</P>
<P>
Receiving commendations were Fullerton Fire Capt. Robert Dunkel, paramedics 
Richard Hutchinson and Tom Schultz, firefighter James Worthy, emergency room 
nurse Hermine Stricklin and Southland ambulance attendants Rhonda Hall and 
Brian Speer. 
</P>
<P>
Stricklin, a nurse at St. Jude Hospital in Fullerton, had been riding along 
with the paramedics that day. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors credited the team's pre-hospital care with saving the boy's life. The 
power saw cut into Ryan's abdomen, cutting into his intestines and leaving the 
intestines wrapped around the blade. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters chose not to remove the saw from Ryan's stomach and instead cut 
the power cord and wrapped the intestines in a trauma pack. Their actions 
helped prevent further organ damage and loss of blood, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse during treatment, the paramedic's radio link to the 
hospital failed and the pressure suit they placed on Ryan to prevent shock 
leaked so badly that Worthy kept it inflated by blowing into it with his mouth.

DESCRIPTION IS RELEASED OF NEWBORN FOUND DEAD

A newborn boy found dead in a commercial trash bin in Laguna Hills on Thursday 
was a Caucasian with blond hair and blue eyes, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're saying that the baby was born (a healthy child) between midnight and 8 
a.m. on Wednesday," said Lt. Robert Rivas, a sheriff's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"He was dead for about a day (before he was found)." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County coroner's officials performed an autopsy Friday on the infant, 
who was found by a man who frequently picks through the dumpsters at the 
Saddleback Business Complex just off Interstate 5 below the upscale homes of 
Nellie Gail Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
The man, who was not identified, called sheriff's investigators, who retrieved 
the body from the trash bin. Witnesses said the child was wrapped in a white 
cloth and partially covered by debris. 
</P>
<P>
Rivas declined to reveal the cause of death, saying that the release of that 
information could affect the homicide investigation. 
</P>
<P>
He said that while homicide was a possible cause of death, the baby could have 
died from overexposure. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not ruling anything out," Rivas said. "We are handling it as a possible 
homicide. But it could be natural causes; it could be accidental manslaughter 
or homicide. We handle it to the extreme to make sure we cover all bases." 
</P>
<P>
Rivas said investigators have few leads and are seeking the public's 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"We need help," he said, adding that the baby's mother has not been identified. 
Rivas said that she may be seeking medical attention for possible hemorrhaging. 
</P>
<P>
"We need any leads we can get," he said. "We are stressing the urgency." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information should call detectives Rudy Garcia or Tim Carney at 
(714) 647-7000.

PROPOSED DRUG-TESTING PLAN RAISES CONCERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Police chiefs in Orange County are girding for some resistance to a plan that 
asks each of the county's law enforcement agencies, including the Sheriff's 
Department, to establish drug-testing programs for their departments by the end 
of next year. 
</P>
<P>
Robert MacLeod, general manager of the Orange County Deputy Sheriff's Assn., 
said members are already questioning motivations for the policy and whether 
safeguards will be included to protect against possible abuses. 
</P>
<P>
"We have received some phone calls," said MacLeod, referring to members of the 
county's largest law enforcement union. "They're expressing concerns. . . . 
What kind of checks and balances will there be? What kind of substances will 
they check for? Will it be merely illegal drugs or prescription drugs, too? 
I've had three people call today asking about codeine -- a couple of guys said 
they take it for bronchitis and were concerned about it." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach Police Chief Neil J. Purcell, president of the Orange County 
Chiefs of Police and Sheriff's Assn. which announced the proposal Wednesday, 
said the association has built in enough time to allow individual departments 
to deal with concerns raised by police unions and employee groups. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to have a policy to nail people," Purcell said. "These are our 
employees we are talking about, not criminals. We've allowed some time because 
we want to work with the police unions. Hopefully, we will be able to work out 
the bugs." 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan approved by the police chiefs and Sheriff Brad Gates, Purcell 
said individual departments will have the freedom to deal with the kinds and 
numbers of drugs to be screened and the disciplinary procedures to be followed. 
The plans are expected to be formulated by Dec. 31, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Purcell said his association merely presented a model plan and some guidelines 
to help individual departments along. That model includes testing provisions 
for the presence of morphine, codeine, cocaine, amphetamines and marijuana. He 
said those substances represented the most commonly abused drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The model does not include testing for steroids or alcohol, but Purcell said 
those substances and others could be included in a plan tailored for an 
individual department. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the questions raised by officers, MacLeod said his police 
association has not taken a formal position on the proposal. However, he said 
it would be good to ensure that a certified laboratory in drug testing 
procedures be retained to provide a safeguard against false positive readings. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Police Chief Joseph T. Molloy said he expects police unions to question 
the integrity of any system implemented in police agencies in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"Drug testing is not the issue here," Molloy said. "It is how we're going to 
make this a reliable process. What kind of a process are we going to build in 
for their protection? Some labor groups may have a problem with it." 
</P>
<P>
Molloy said he had informed his department of 340 sworn officers about the 
issue well before the police chiefs made their announcement Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"This wasn't something that was a covert action," he said. "All of this may be 
ambitious. Our guys have not reacted to it."

Air Regulator Recall: A diving equipment manufacturer based in Santa Ana 
announced Friday that it has voluntarily recalled all of its air regulators 
because they may allow too much air to flow into divers' lungs. 
</P>
<P>
The company, U.S. Divers, said that a functional problem with the high pressure 
seats of the first stage of the regulators may allow an uncontrolled flow of 
air to its second stage. "If this occurs during a dive, use of the product 
could be hazardous," the company said. U.S. Divers said the recall affects all 
regulators that were purchased or serviced since Aug. 15. The company did not 
indicate whether any injuries have resulted because of the problem.

ECONOMISTS AGREE O.C. BETTER DUCK THIS RECESSION SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
CONFERENCE: A PANELIST SAYS PLUMMETING CONSTRUCTION WILL DRAG THE COUNTY DOWN 
DEEPER THAN THE REST OF THE STATE NEXT YEAR BECAUSE OF THE MAJOR ROLE BUILDERS 
PLAY IN LOCAL ECONOMY.

<P>
The nation's economy will slide into a mild recession by early next year -- if 
one hasn't already begun -- and the rebound will be sluggish at best, three 
economists said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
And Orange County, which nearly missed the last mild recession in 1980 because 
of its vigorous economy -- is likely to be hit hard this time around, warned 
one member of the panel addressing the annual Orange County Economic Outlook 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"The county is not recession-resistant," said James Doti, a Chapman College 
economist who specializes in local economic forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
He said plummeting construction activity will drag the county deeper into 
recession next year than most other areas of the state because of the major 
role construction still plays in this economy. 
</P>
<P>
Doti and economists Allen Sinai of the Boston Co. and Norman Mains of the Los 
Angeles investment firm Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc., agreed that the 
recession they and other economists predict will be relatively short -- lasting 
three to five quarters. 
</P>
<P>
While the recession of 1973-75 was preceded by a quadrupling of world oil 
prices, and the recession of 1981-82 was triggered by inflation and spiraling 
interest rates, there has been no one significant national or worldwide event 
feeding the current slump, Mains said. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 caused oil prices to double, but because 
the United States is much less dependent on foreign oil now than during the 
1973-75 recession, the impact was lessened, he said. 
</P>
<P>
And interest rates and inflation both remain relatively tame, said Sinai, 
adding that he does expect inflation to exceed 6.5% in 1991, up from about 5% 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Those factors suggest a shallow recession, Sinai said, but also indicate a less 
vigorous recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Sinai also cautioned that any economic predictions are subject to changes in 
the Middle East situation. 
</P>
<P>
While none of the economists speculated on the political climate, former 
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci told the nearly 800 county business 
executives attending that the likelihood of a military conflict is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
Carlucci, who used his luncheon speech for a ringing defense of the Reagan 
Administration's arms policies, warned that congressional moves to trim 
military spending are premature, despite the diminished threat from the 
economically troubled Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
But if the Bush Administration succeeds in removing Iraqi troops from Kuwait 
without an economy-shattering war, Sinai said, the domestic economic situation 
still seems headed for "a protracted period of anemic, sub-par, punky, lousy, 
crummy economic performance." 
</P>
<P>
All three economists suggested that a recession has already begun and that the 
gross national product -- the official measuring stick of the economy -- will 
decline in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Economists define a recession as two or more consecutive quarters of actual 
decline in the GNP. 
</P>
<P>
Doti said the county's annual economy of nearly $70 billion is in recession 
when there are two or more consecutive quarters in which employment levels are 
lower than in the same period of the prior year. 
</P>
<P>
While the county's total employment at the end of August remained slightly 
higher than at the end of August, 1989 -- 1.22 million versus 1.2 million -- 
the total has dropped each month since June. 
</P>
<P>
Doti said his calculations show that the nation will be dragged into recession 
largely because of the construction slump. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the resulting job losses in the county will not be fully felt 
until early next year. 
</P>
<P>
"The nose-dive in construction, nationally and locally, is the culprit," Doti 
said, "and right now we are seeing only the tip of the iceberg." 
</P>
<P>
"The drop in activity started in the third quarter, and it takes from one to 
five quarters for all of the employment impact to hit." 
</P>
<P>
Doti said he expects construction activity to "continue plummeting," with a 
12-month loss to the economy of about $3 billion when the total impact is 
tallied. 
</P>
<P>
"That is about 5% of our total county product," he said, "and that is a pretty 
big hit." 
</P>
<P>
"If it weren't for these building permit statistics, there would be no 
significant signs of a serious downturn for the county" Doti said in an 
interview before his remarks Friday. 
</P>
<P>
County manufacturers say "things are weak but that there is no sign of a big 
drop-off," he said. "But there is just not enough going on in manufacturing and 
other sectors of the local economy to compensate for such a heavy hit from the 
construction slump."

HealthTrade International Inc., a Mission Viejo trading company specializing in 
medical and health care equipment, said it has recently signed an agreement to 
provide artificial lenses to several hospitals in Southern China. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bart S. Chapman, president of HealthTrade, said the value of the contract 
is small but may open the door to future sales in China. He said Chinese 
officials have already indicated that they plan to order more artificial lenses 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
The artificial lenses will be used by people suffering from cataracts. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman said his company is currently negotiating with other Chinese hospitals 
to supply them with advanced computerized medical equipment.

Herb E. Pruett has resigned as director of the Anaheim Museum, effective Nov. 
2, to return to his home in Northern California's Mendocino County. His 
assistant, Rita Robinson, will manage daily operations until the museum's board 
finds a new director. 
</P>
<P>
Pruett became the museum's second director in September, 1985, when it existed 
in a small Anaheim office "with two desks," he said. The institution now 
occupies the city's former library, a historic landmark built with funds from 
the Carnegie Foundation in 1908. 
</P>
<P>
"I came down here in 1985 to work in the museum field in Southern California, 
and I feel like I've accomplished the goals I set and it's time to go back," 
Pruett said. "Mendocino is my home." 
</P>
<P>
Pruett, who was previously founding director of the Mendocino County Museum, 
said he plans to do museum consulting and develop other "outside interests." 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim Museum focuses on the history of Anaheim and north Orange County. 
It has changing exhibits, a permanent collection and a children's hands-on 
gallery as well as a gallery at Anaheim Plaza shopping center. Its main site is 
open four days a week.

<P>
If your child thinks carrots come from the grocery store and peanuts are 
manufactured in a factory and sealed in a can, perhaps it's time to consider a 
back-yard garden. 
</P>
<P>
"We see a lot of youngsters here who have no idea how vegetables are grown," 
said Jim Bailey, a former agriculture teacher at Sunny Hills High School in 
Fullerton. He donates his time and expertise at the Youth Garden at the Orange 
County Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
The fairgrounds in Costa Mesa operates a youth garden at its year-round farm. 
Youngsters can see firsthand how carrots, lettuce, beans and tomatoes are 
grown. In addition, more unusual "crops" are also grown here -- grapes, 
berries, peanuts and popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
"Tour groups come by to see how these foods are grown as well as visit with the 
animals at the farm," Bailey said. "We started the garden about two years ago, 
and 16,000 children have come through since then." 
</P>
<P>
Bailey stressed the importance of youngsters knowing about agriculture and 
where they get their food and what it takes to produce it. 
</P>
<P>
"In Southern California, many children haven't seen gardens or fields of 
vegetables growing," he said. "It's hard for them to realize the time and 
effort it takes to grow what they eat." 
</P>
<P>
That's unfortunate, according to Bailey, because a back-yard garden can be an 
educational experience for youngsters. And in Orange County, the weather 
provides opportunities for year-round growing. Even preschoolers can get 
involved on a limited basis. By the time children are 6 or 7, they can take 
further responsibility for a garden with some adult supervision. 
</P>
<P>
"With youngsters, start by giving them a seed, like squash, and plant it in a 
cup," Bailey said. "When it's about two inches high, they can transplant it out 
in the yard." 
</P>
<P>
Radishes are another good choice for first-time farmers, because they grow 
rapidly. In 28 days, they're ready to eat. 
</P>
<P>
"With children, it's nice to grow something fairly quickly to maintain their 
interest," Bailey said. "With carrots, it can take a lot longer for the 
results. By that point, the child may have given up." 
</P>
<P>
During the warmer spring and summer months, recommended fruits and vegetables 
for a back-yard garden include beans, tomatoes, melons, cucumbers, 
strawberries, peas and peppers. In the fall and winter, turn to the leafy 
members of the vegetable family: cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels 
sprouts and different types of lettuce. Such vegetables as squash and zucchini 
are other garden favorites of children; they are easy to grow and produce 
multiple offerings from one plant. 
</P>
<P>
But what if your yard is too small? Not to worry. 
</P>
<P>
"You really don't need a lot of room to grow vegetables," Bailey said. "In 
fact, I have a planter at home that is four feet wide and about 15 feet long. 
In it I grow radishes, carrots, beets, cauliflower and several types of 
lettuce. In a space that size, about 60 square feet, there's plenty of room to 
grow enough vegetables to feed a whole family." Gardens can also be grown in 
containers. 
</P>
<P>
A six-inch pot is all that's required to grow about four or five beet plants, 
although a tub is needed to grow honeydew. Herbs are another option for 
container gardening, and many nurseries and seed catalogues feature mini, dwarf 
and compact versions of different vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
"With very little space, children can learn about the growing cycle and achieve 
hands-on learning," Bailey said. "They begin to understand concepts of 
germination and the effects of the seasons and the weather. Agriculture is a 
science and there's no end to the experiments you can try. You can water one 
area more than another and see what happens. Or fertilize one section and not 
another. Measure the plants as they grow to see how quickly they shoot up. Do 
they grow better in the sun or the shade?" 
</P>
<P>
Children can also be taught the parts of a plant (roots, stem, seeds, leaves) 
and even "dissect" flowers to locate the stamen, petals, sepal and pistil. 
</P>
<P>
Even garden "pests" can provide learning experiences. Bailey recommended 
turning ladybugs loose in the garden to eat the aphids that may appear. 
Earthworms can help aerate the soil and teach children lessons about how 
different life forms interact. Bailey also recommends using organic materials 
to control insects -- especially if children are involved in tending the 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
"At the youth garden, we work with integrated pest control," he said. "That 
means we use ladybugs as well as organic materials to control insects. You can 
purchase organic materials at most nurseries. Just check the bottle to make 
sure it says 'organic.' " 
</P>
<P>
Another advantage of back-yard gardening is its minimal expense. Other than 
seeds, the only tools that are required are a can or hose for watering, a 
pointed-nose shovel for digging, a hoe for weeding and making furrows, and a 
rake to break up dirt and spread soil. An occasional feeding of fertilizer is 
recommended to enhance growth. But what you spend on the garden can be saved on 
the grocery bill. 
</P>
<P>
But with all the other opportunities around, why is it important for a child to 
know about gardening? 
</P>
<P>
"First, it's educational," Bailey said. "It's a living science experiment, and 
I also think kids need to be involved in a hands-on working environment. And 
gardening is . . . a different kind of work. You get dirty and you get tired, 
but it's worth it when you see the results of your work. Children are very 
proud when their gardens begin to yield fruit and vegetables. . . . They are 
even more likely to eat something if they've grown it themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Children can achieve a sense of satisfaction and learn patience while they wait 
for their gardens to bear, Bailey said. They also learn responsibility by 
nurturing it -- watering, weeding and taking care of garden pests. 
</P>
<P>
As a former agriculture teacher, Bailey said he was pleasantly surprised by the 
number of students who wanted to learn more about agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is that youngsters are interested in gardening," he said. "If you 
give them the responsibility and some direction, they can do very well."

IS JUNIOR A FUTURE WOLFGANG PUCK?

<P>
My first experience with food preparation involved a free-form recipe that 
included, among other things, Worcestershire sauce, flour, Tabasco, sugar, 
Delaware Punch, ketchup, cracker crumbs, random spices and the entrails of a 
couple of halibut that a friend and I had pulled out of Newport Harbor that 
morning. We were both 9. We made a vast mess in the kitchen of my friend's 
mother and were forced to bury our creation in the back yard so it couldn't 
hurt the dog. 
</P>
<P>
From that time until the year I graduated from college -- and decided that 
there must be forms of food other than those with a "Mc" in front of them -- 
the kitchen was the Forbidden Zone and cooking was alchemy. My haute cuisine 
was Cocoa Puffs. My preparation for life did not include lessons in pasta, the 
all-purpose bachelor chow. 
</P>
<P>
But Pamela Sheldon says it could have. A food writer, teacher and consultant 
who lives in Long Beach, Sheldon said it's possible, even easy, to teach a 
5-year-old not only how to make pasta from scratch, but how to actually knock 
together a decent meal. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids are very natural in the kitchen," said Sheldon, who taught children's 
cooking classes at Ma Cuisine when that store was in Fashion Island. "It may 
sound scary, but actually it's one of the easiest things to do with a child 
because food is so motivating. At the end of the lesson, you get to eat 
something really good. And in the long run, it'll save time for you because the 
kids can be more responsible and independent. They can fix their own snacks." 
</P>
<P>
The snacks, however, as well as actual entrees, shouldn't involve "cooking 
down" to the kids, Sheldon said. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to do real food with kids," she said. "I don't like to make it up. 
Taking canned biscuits and spreading tomato paste and cheese on them and 
calling it pizza isn't real food. Kids can learn how to handle making real 
food. It may not be a pizza recipe from Spago, but you can make a pizza using 
real pizza ingredients. That's always one of the kids' favorites." 
</P>
<P>
Even a 5-year-old, she said, can whip up a batch of cookies. 
</P>
<P>
"Cookies are a good place to start," Sheldon advised. "They can do the stirring 
and put the ingredients together. And they get to watch what happens when it 
all goes into the oven. It also helps them learn math skills when they're 
measuring, they can learn about telling time by watching the clock and about 
reading when they're looking at recipes. They're developing organizational 
skills." 
</P>
<P>
Supervision, of course, is paramount. Otherwise you could end up with fish 
entrail gazpacho and a nervous dog or, worse, a cut or burn to treat. Simple 
common sense, Sheldon said, can anticipate most problems. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, she said, don't expect a 5-year-old kid to grasp the nuances of 
flipping sizzling food in a saute pan. Junior's going to need a few more motor 
skills before he can look like a Cordon Bleu grad. So, if you've got a heavy 
pot full of hot stew in the oven, you take it out. 
</P>
<P>
But, Sheldon suggests, while you're teaching your child that knives are sharp 
and stoves are hot and a big mess is only a flying elbow away, emphasize that 
the process can still be a kick. 
</P>
<P>
"Depending on the child's age," she said, "you have to set down some guidelines 
on what can be used with and without an adult around. For instance, you can 
make a rule that no sharp knives can be used without an adult present. But you 
don't want to make it so scary that when the kids turn 21, they're still afraid 
to pick up a knife." 
</P>
<P>
One strategy, she said, is division of labor. Highlight the steps in the 
cookbook that your child can do -- stirring, blending, shaping dough, cutting 
out cookies -- and you dice and saute the onions and flambe the dessert. 
</P>
<P>
A cookbook for kids can help demystify and simplify things, for both children 
and their parents. A good one is Betty Crocker's New Boys and Girls Cookbook. 
It costs about $10, it's simply written, includes a brief glossary of common 
cooking terms and hints, illustrates how to set a table and how to measure 
ingredients, includes a page on "kitchen math" and an illustrated nomenclature 
of cooking tools. 
</P>
<P>
(This information alone, believe me, would have been a real boon in my hungry 
postgraduate days when I was a culinary moron and the can opener was my primary 
cooking tool. Do your kids a favor and get them a cookbook like this when 
they're young so they won't face the embarrassment of having to buy a child's 
cookbook to learn the basics when they're 22.) 
</P>
<P>
It isn't baby food. A few moppet meals from the Betty Crocker book: nachos, 
scrambled eggs, lemon-blueberry muffins, scones, vegetable soup, crunchy 
tortellini salad, sloppy joes, oven-fried chicken, peanut chocolate truffles, 
strawberry shortcake, baked cheese with apples and, yes, pizza. 
</P>
<P>
Presentation doesn't count. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if it doesn't look good at the end, they're proud of it because they did 
it," she said. "There are very few kids that don't get excited about cooking." 
</P>
<P>
But what if the kid turns into Kitchen Ninja? What if he starts carrying around 
a Henckel Four Star in a holster like a Navy Colt? What if he pulls down the 
Magic Johnson poster and puts up one of Wolfgang Puck? What if he asks for a 
duck press for Christmas? 
</P>
<P>
Relax. Scrap the kiddie cookbook, get him a copy of the Larousse Gastronomique 
and set the table. Until he heads off to chef's school at La Varenne (on 
scholarship), you're going to eat like a sultan.

GROWING SPACES; 
</P>
<P>
KIDS' ROOMS: DESIGNING ENVIRONMENTS FOR CHILDREN THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE THEM FROM 
THE CRIB TO COLLEGE CAN TEST PARENTS' PATIENCE, IMAGINATION AND POCKETBOOKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH GLAZNER, Elizabeth Glazner is a regular contributor to Home 
Design. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Few things are as ephemeral as the motif of a growing child's bedroom. Except 
perhaps a child's shoe size. 
</P>
<P>
It seems as soon as the crib is upgraded to that walnut-stained captain's bunk, 
your toddler's a teen-ager, swapping his Batman slipcovers for a jet-black 
duvet. And before you can sing "Happy Birthday," he's abandoning it for the 
college dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
Brat. 
</P>
<P>
In the space of about 18 years, parents find themselves in an endless quest to 
accommodate the fickle needs of a kid who one day wants a toy chest for his 
stuffed stegosaurus, the next is stuffing it with floppy disks and college 
catalogues. Too often, parents find these needs outgrow their pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
Designing an environment for children that can take them from crayons to 
computers is the dilemma parents confront when looking at how to stretch their 
investment dollars, says Francine Pace, manager of Kids' Quarters in Orange, 
which specializes in juvenile furniture. The issues, she says, are 
timelessness, versatility, and of course, where to put the goldfish. 
</P>
<P>
Whether it's pink or blue or has a bed shaped like a race car, a child's 
bedroom is his or her first laboratory of self-expression. 
</P>
<P>
Elaine Hankin of Elaine Hankin Interior Design in Huntington Beach says every 
child should have his or her own special place. For 6-month-old Christina 
Andrews's room in Huntington Beach, Hankin commissioned a muralist to draw a 
fantasy-scape on one wall. Hankin says rooms should not be dated with trendy 
furnishings ("I never used avocado green or shag") and that they should be 
comfortable enough for children to grow up in. For this reason, Christina's 
mural doesn't depict nursery characters but animals and fairies, and her crib 
will eventually convert into a bed. 
</P>
<P>
"Buying children's furniture is more interesting and exciting than buying other 
things for the home," says Pace. "Parents feel obliged to learn at least six 
technical aspects of a product like a refrigerator. Buying things for a kid's 
room is a lot more fun." 
</P>
<P>
That may be, but most parents would agree that there are still some technical 
aspects to choosing a design for their children's room, based primarily on 
variables of style and function. 
</P>
<P>
Pace says the most popular plan revolves around modular units -- separate 
storage pieces that can be made to fit together in a variety of ways. "It's 
affordable and adaptable," Pace says. "And besides, there is always some piece 
that a grandparent can buy." 
</P>
<P>
Storage cabinets, drawers, desks and hutches, tables and even wardrobes can all 
be purchased according to the basic tenet of mix and match, Pace says. Within 
that framework, parents can custom design an environment that can be altered as 
quickly as their child changes grades. 
</P>
<P>
Once the child has outgrown the crib, the logical place to start spending would 
be in the bed department. 
</P>
<P>
The gamut at Kids' Quarters runs from a twin bed of simple pine for around 
$120, to an oak bed "imported" from the East Coast for about $500. Similar 
prices can be found at Children's World in Irvine, Kids' Room in Tustin, Al's 
Woodcraft in Tustin, Anaheim and Huntington Beach and STOR in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, beds can be as varied as the children who sleep in them. The 
captain's bunk has always been popular because of its built-in storage space, 
and bunk beds are revered as an extension of the back yard Jungle Jim. Though 
Pace denies that bunk beds are necessarily juvenile, their design can present a 
problem to teen-agers who might one day decide that the bed they've slept in 
since kindergarten is now a total gross-out. 
</P>
<P>
That's when parents realize their initial mistake in planning their child's 
room: They didn't. Pace tries to stress versatility to young families -- 
avoiding the cliches of childhood that spawn such trends as race car beds, in 
favor of more timeless designs. That way, the room can be given a fresh look 
simply by investing in a new bedspread and curtains -- a much cheaper 
transition from toddler to teen. 
</P>
<P>
The same basic rule applies when designing storage space for your child's room. 
Pace says the most popular piece is the three-drawer chest, just short enough 
so that most kids can reach the top drawer. Their design can range from simple 
pine to sophisticated laminate -- an attractive selling point for parents weary 
of fingerprints and scarring ballpoint pen marks. 
</P>
<P>
As the need for space increases, more three-drawer chests can be added. STOR 
offers a four-drawer white-lacquered particleboard system for $99, with 
adaptable shelf and cabinet units. It also sells white-lacquered desktops that 
can be placed on top of two narrow drawer units that will suffice until your 
child goes to college. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, parents can spend as much as they want on furniture for their 
children. Bellini, an upscale juvenile furniture store in Costa Mesa, 
specializes in Italian-made solid beechwood cribs, priced from $474 to $700. 
Manager Courtney Alford says that although Bellini is priced higher than most 
outlets, the long-term cost to parents is minimized because the cribs convert 
to youth beds that can be used by children until about age 4. 
</P>
<P>
Bellini also sells changing tables, for around $580, that convert into full 
bookcases, and Canadian-made beechwood rockers that are pretty enough to 
complement any room from child to adult. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to know how long the furniture (you're buying) will last," 
Alford says. "Is it durable enough to support older children? It's hard for 
some people to look beyond the first couple of years," she continues. 
</P>
<P>
"Typically, after two years, they start to redo the nursery. That's when they 
show up here." 
</P>
<P>
Part of children's furniture buying savvy is knowing something about its 
manufacturers. The domestic furniture industry is fragmented, with more than 
2,000 producers throughout the country, Pace says. 
</P>
<P>
The East Coast, where the industry began, still specializes in hardwoods such 
as oak and maple. But because of the high cost of shipping, California has a 
plethora of local manufacturers offering furniture at competitive prices. 
</P>
<P>
California entrepreneurs can offer pine, alder, and of course, redwood from the 
Northwest, and ship them locally, saving 18% off their retail price tag. A 
standard oak bunk bed set from the East Coast, says Pace, could cost as much at 
$800. 
</P>
<P>
West Coast furniture outlets such as STOR keep freight costs even lower by 
shipping their wares unassembled, which makes for a more efficient package. 
</P>
<P>
All of this means that parents on the West Coast can outfit their children's 
rooms cheaper than parents in, say, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
So parents can afford to pay attention to style as well as function, says Jeff 
Lee, a STOR buyer. He says we are a generation of parents who definitely care 
about style. 
</P>
<P>
"Juvenile furniture sales accelerated dramatically because of the baby 
boomers," Lee says. "Women have more disposable income because they went out 
and built their careers and then had their families. They took time to think 
about their families, and they're interested in providing as much quality for 
their children as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Mothers are also older today than they used to be, from 25 to 38, as opposed to 
"our mothers, who were 18," according to Pace's estimate. As a result, she 
says, "they have had time to research their choices. They're generally more in 
tune with what's available." Which of course ultimately dictates what's 
available. 
</P>
<P>
The baby boomer generation has helped establish the American Furniture 
Manufacturer's Assn., a voluntary organization with guidelines that set up 
safety precautions for furniture makers. The guidelines suggest such safety 
items as placing a sandpaper-like strip on the rungs of metal bunk bed ladders 
so that children do not fall through them. 
</P>
<P>
Lee notes that it was this precautionary vision that prompted the redesign of 
the toy box, that age-old repository of childhood. The safer "storage bench" 
does not lock when it closes, avoiding the possibility of trapping a child 
inside. And though it may not accommodate all of the junk a child can possibly 
try to stuff into it, Kids' Quarters still carries one, in solid maple, for 
$99. 
</P>
<P>
And so does Bellini, in hand-painted solid beechwood, for $220. 
</P>
<P>
Such well-bred quality seems to be making a comeback among homemakers who have, 
in the years since their liberation, relied on convenience and disposability 
for everything from diapers to dinner trays. Pointing again to the aspirations 
of the baby boom generation, Alford notes the phenomenal success of 
television's "thirtysomething" in portraying the successful life as one lived 
among expensive and well-crafted possessions. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a change in the market in just the last two years," she notes. 
"Everyone's more decorator-oriented. They want the look of quality." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Bellini furniture and accessories have appeared in many video images of 
the baby boom landscape -- the Diane Keaton film "Baby Boom," as well as "Miami 
Vice" and "All My Children," to name a few." 
</P>
<P>
Such attention to quality and durability might help establish a new generation 
of family heirlooms, suggests Alford. "All of this stuff makes good 
hand-me-downs."

BERNSON'S CAMPAIGN FUNDING QUESTIONED; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: COMMON CAUSE SAYS THE COUNCILMAN'S COMMITTEE, FORMED TO BACK A 
POSSIBLE BID FOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR IN 1994, WAS CREATED 'TO GET AROUND THE 
CITY'S CAMPAIGN LAWS.' 
</P>

<P>
A political watchdog group said Friday it will again ask authorities to review 
the activities of a controversial political committee that Los Angeles City 
Councilman Hal Bernson said he plans to disband. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Foster, executive director of California Common Cause, said Bernson's 
decision to shut down his Bernson for Lt. Governor 1994 Committee only 
underscores questions Common Cause has had about the committee, which began 
raising money in early 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been saying for a long time that he had no intention to run for 
lieutenant governor," Foster said. "He set up the committee to get around the 
city's campaign laws." Common Cause is a group concerned with campaign finance 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that he's closed the committee, it may be time to revisit the question," 
Foster said. "I think it merits a second look by the city attorney's office." 
</P>
<P>
Bernson, who has represented the north San Fernando Valley since 1979, denied 
Friday that establishing the committee was a ruse designed to avoid a City 
Charter section forbidding council members from raising funds in excess of $500 
from any individual with the intent of spending the money to get reelected. The 
committee raised $179,525 for Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
"We never had any problem with money, so we didn't need to raise money" in 
violation of the law, Bernson said in an interview Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson also said he was always serious about "exploring the possibility of 
running for lieutenant governor." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not something I want to pursue now," he added. "My work is here in Los 
Angeles and I want to complete some of the things I've started." Bernson, whose 
term expires June 30, 1991, said he intends to seek reelection next spring. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmaker also said the city attorney's office, state Fair Political 
Practices Commission and state attorney general's office had reviewed 
complaints previously lodged with them by Common Cause. "All of them took a 
look at it and found everything was lawful and proper," Bernson said. 
</P>
<P>
A review of the reports filed by the committee show that 73%, or $130,500, of 
the $179,525 raised by the committee was raised from individuals contributing 
more than $500 each. Contributions of this size are not permitted under the 
city's campaign law if spent to help a council member seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
The reports say $29,800 was spent for a fund-raising banquet at the Sheraton 
Universal Hotel and another $17,114 for related fund-raising expenses. 
</P>
<P>
About $11,400 went for dinners with constituents and supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Of $17,235 labeled as "contributions" in the reports, $10,185 was given to 
charitable groups -- Boy Scouts, Jewish temples, YMCA -- that were listed in 
Bernson's report as having an address in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Common Cause contended that many of the expenditures made by the 
committee would help Bernson win reelection to his council seat and expressed 
doubts that much would be spent outside the district in a race for lieutenant 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson, however, said he was "very careful" about how the committee's funds 
were spent. "I'd say most of the money was spent outside the district," he 
said. But pressed about details, he said, "I'm not going to get into an 
accounting of it." 
</P>
<P>
The committee has a surplus of "about $40,000," Bernson said. As of June 30 of 
this year, when it last disclosed its financial affairs, the committee had cash 
on hand of $55,721.09. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said the surplus will be transferred to another of his political 
committees -- but not to the committee he will tap for his reelection expenses.

OWNERS OFFER TO CLEAR CHATSWORTH SITE TO REDUCE COURTHOUSE COST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The owners of a defunct power-tool manufacturing company, who want to sell the 
Chatsworth property to the county for a municipal courthouse site, have offered 
to demolish the vacant buildings to reduce the cost of a county purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Farley, executive vice president of Allegretti and Co., said he 
submitted a proposal to county court administrators last week offering to 
absorb the cost of clearing several warehouses from the nine-acre parcel at 
9200 Mason Ave. as part of the sales agreement. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the county, Farley offered to sell the cleared land for $12 
million to $14 million, a price he said was "very competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Farley said he has not received a response. A court spokeswoman confirmed 
Friday that the offer was received, but declined to comment on its status. 
</P>
<P>
Court officials, who have entered into negotiations with a developer to 
purchase another Chatsworth site for the new West Valley municipal courthouse, 
earlier rejected the Allegretti property as too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
However, Farley said Friday he believed the county overestimated the cost of 
demolishing the old buildings on his property. 
</P>
<P>
In their initial reports, Farley said, county officials estimated that it would 
cost $2.8 million to clear the land. Farley said he obtained estimates from 
demolition firms stating the site could be cleared for about $280,000. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Farley complained that his land had not been given fair 
consideration before county officials decided to open negotiations with 
developer Alexander Haagen for a nine-acre parcel at Plummer Street and 
Winnetka Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The Plummer Street proposal has raised vehement protests from nearby homeowners 
who fear that the courthouse will generate traffic congestion and graffiti, 
increase crime and reduce property values. 
</P>
<P>
In response to Farley's complaint and to the growing pressure from homeowners 
to find an alternative site, County Supervisor Mike Antonovich requested that 
court officials reconsider the Allegretti site while continuing to negotiate 
with Haagen.

HOUSE APPROVES ROCKWELL CLEANUP FUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE $11.8 MILLION WOULD BE SPENT TO REMOVE CHEMICAL AND 
RADIOACTIVE RESIDUES, UPGRADE POLLUTION CONTROLS AND TEST GROUND WATER. SENATE 
PASSAGE APPEARS LIKELY.

<P>
The cleanup of radioactive and chemical contamination at Rockwell International 
facilities west of Chatsworth will likely receive about $11.8 million in the 
next fiscal year in an energy and water spending bill approved Friday by the 
House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
The figure represents the full sum proposed for the fiscal year that began Oct. 
1 under the Department of Energy's six-year, $37.3-million plan to clean up the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
The department will use the funds to remove chemical and radioactive 
contamination, found mostly at low levels in soil and buildings, and to upgrade 
pollution controls on equipment at Rockwell's Santa Susana Field Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the funds also will be spent on ground-water testing at Rockwell's De 
Soto Avenue plant in Canoga Park, where the firm has handled chemicals and, in 
the past, conducted nuclear operations, including the manufacture of nuclear 
fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), whose 21st District includes the field 
laboratory, said he is pleased with the funding levels and vowed to continue 
his efforts to ensure that the cleanup continues on schedule, press secretary 
John Frith said. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, everything looks good," Frith said. 
</P>
<P>
The energy and water bill, negotiated by a House and Senate conference 
committee last week, contains a total of $3.15 billion for Department of Energy 
environmental restoration and waste management projects nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
This includes defense as well as non-defense facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The bill does not break down projected spending for individual sites, but Frith 
said that energy officials indicated that the overall funds in the measure 
would permit them to allocate all of the funds proposed for the Rockwell 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Energy had initially projected $9.8 million in the next 
fiscal year for the 25 separate Rockwell projects in the West San Fernando 
Valley, but increased the figure to $11.8 million when President Bush submitted 
his proposed 1991 budget to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The measure is expected to be passed by the Senate and sent to Bush for his 
signature in the next week.

ANGRY BAND OF INVESTORS REFUSES TO CALL IT QUITS; 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;LS: ABOUT 350 SENIOR CITIZENS WHO CALL THEMSELVES THE 'VICTIMS OF 
KEATING' ORGANIZE TO SHARE INFORMATION AND FOLLOW THE CASE. THEY WANT JUSTICE 
DONE AND TO RECOUP THEIR LOSSES. 
</P>

<P>
Prosecutors and investigators aren't the only adversaries Charles Keating, the 
former thrift executive charged in the multimillion-dollar Lincoln Savings 
&amp; Loan collapse, will have to face the next time he goes to court. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, who was released Thursday from Los Angeles County Jail after posting 
$300,000 bail, also can expect to see a busload of angry senior citizens from 
the San Fernando Valley, who say they have lost hundreds of thousands of 
dollars -- in some cases their life savings. 
</P>
<P>
The group consists of about 350 former investors, about 50 of whom attend 
monthly meetings at a senior center in Sherman Oaks. Their official name is the 
Lincoln ACC Bondholders Action Committee; their nickname is "Victims of 
Keating." (ACC stands for American Continental Corp., Lincoln's parent 
company.) 
</P>
<P>
"They are a whirlwind group," said Don West, chief investigator for Joseph 
Cotchett, the Burlingame lawyer representing 22,000 investors in a class-action 
suit pending against Keating and numerous colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Other than a similar organization in Orange County, West said the Valley 
committee is the only well-organized group of former holders of now-worthless 
American Continental Corp. bonds, which authorities allege Lincoln officials 
pushed on investors through misleading tactics. The seniors have banded 
together to share information, keep the case in the media, attend court 
hearings and do whatever else they can to see justice done and their money 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still very angry," said Jeri Mellon, 65, committee chairwoman, of 
Sherman Oaks. The former hospital administrator says she lost the $40,000 she 
invested in bonds in 1986 at the Lincoln branch at Riverside Drive and Woodman 
Avenue. She said she trusted officials there because the atmosphere was "like a 
family. I had been banking there since 1969. Everybody knew your name when you 
walked in the door." 
</P>
<P>
The "victims" group, which extends across economic lines, attempts to function 
as something of an extended family in helping each other cope, Mellon said. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart goes out to some of these people; they lost everything," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A case in point, according to Mellon and West, is Israel Tepper. 
</P>
<P>
The 69-year-old Tepper, a retired jewelry manufacturer, said he lost $265,000. 
After the 1989 Lincoln collapse cut off his interest checks, his income of 
about $3,000 a month was slashed to about $800 in Social Security, he said. He 
had to abandon his comfortable Van Nuys apartment and move in with friends in 
Simi Valley, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was hard for Tepper to watch Keating go free. 
</P>
<P>
"That judge should be thrown out," said Tepper, who also has harsh words for 
the elected officials and bureaucrats he accuses of abetting or ignoring the 
S&amp;L debacle. 
</P>
<P>
"The senators were overlooking the situation," he said. "Why didn't the 
government tell us something was wrong and get the money out? Why are we giving 
money to other countries that we don't have? This is the most bankrupt country 
in the world." 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the group shares a growing overall disgust with entrenched 
politicians, Mellon said, and plans to vote accordingly in November. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to reduce the greed of our politicians," she said. "They don't care 
about us. All they care about is their power. We have to get them out." 
</P>
<P>
Mellon and the others still have hopes of getting some of their money back, 
pointing out that some defendants have settled civil suits against them and 
provided money to a plaintiffs' fund. That money has not yet been distributed 
by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
As for Keating, Mellon said she intends to rent a bus for a show of force at 
upcoming court dates. She can count on Sam Epstein, 78, of North Hollywood. 
Epstein was in his pajamas last month when he got a call asking that he attend 
Keating's first bail hearing that same morning, but he still made it to court 
in time. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like it," Epstein said of the decision that allowed Keating to make 
bail. "I don't think it's right. Why doesn't he divulge where some of the money 
is? I'll bet some of that bail money is ours."

DR. ARTHUR S. LEAVITT; RETIRED PHYSICIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Arthur S. Leavitt, a retired Tujunga general practitioner and one of the 
first physicians to treat diabetes with insulin, has died in a Glendale 
hospital. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
Leavitt died Wednesday of natural causes, said his stepson, Dr. Robert Foran of 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Leavitt was born Sept. 15, 1897, in Boston. He graduated in 1924 from the 
University of Manitoba Medical School in Canada and moved to Los Angeles. 
Leavitt practiced medicine in Los Angeles during the 1920s and 1930s, and 
served as a colonel in the Army from 1941 to 1946 during World War II, managing 
a base hospital in Alaska's Aleutian Islands. 
</P>
<P>
In 1950, he moved his practice to Tujunga, where he specialized in allergy 
treatment until his retirement in 1982. He was a staff physician at several 
Glendale area hospitals and conducted a free clinic on Saturdays. Leavitt was 
one of the first physicians to use insulin to treat diabetes, according to 
officials at the Los Angeles County Medical Assn., which honored him in 1985 
for having one of the longest terms of membership. 
</P>
<P>
Other survivors include a stepdaughter, Sally Sutherland of Sausalito; four 
step-grandchildren and two step-great-grandchildren. His wife, Rose Leavitt, 
died in June. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral, with burial to follow, is scheduled for 3 p.m. Sunday at Mt. Sinai 
Memorial Park, 5950 Forest Lawn Drive, Los Angeles. Mt. Sinai Mortuary is 
handling the arrangements. Donations can be made in Leavitt's name to the 
Verdugo Hills Hebrew Center in Tujunga, where he was a member.

PRINGLE APPROPRIATES SOME OF UMBERG'S ENDORSEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A mailer sent to voters this week by Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) 
claims endorsements from at least four law enforcement groups that have 
actually pledged their support to his opponent, Democrat Tom Umberg. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle said the mistake was inadvertent. An umbrella organization that 
represents about two dozen police groups endorsed Pringle and told him in a 
letter: "Feel free to use our name and affiliate list." 
</P>
<P>
He did, but several of the affiliates had already endorsed Umberg on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Umberg was unsympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
"I know Curt is having problems getting law enforcement groups to support his 
reelection," he said. "I guess he just got desperate." 
</P>
<P>
Umberg's campaign manager, George Urch, said: "If I was Pringle, I would have 
been more cautious. We've been working very hard on this. He's trying to create 
the impression that he's got a lot of law enforcement support, which he does 
not." 
</P>
<P>
Pringle said that he was only following the instructions of the California 
Union of Safety Employees (CAUSE), the umbrella group that endorsed him. He 
said he will not include the disputed endorsements in future mailers. 
</P>
<P>
"When a group endorses me and tells me to use their name, I will use it," he 
said. "And if I'm told there's an error, then I'll correct it." 
</P>
<P>
Pringle said he learned of the error in letters he received Monday from three 
of the police groups. Two had endorsed Umberg and one had not endorsed anyone, 
but Pringle had used their names in a mailer a few weeks ago. Pringle said, 
however, that it was too late to correct the mailer that some voters received 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Umberg said that at least nine law enforcement endorsements claimed by Pringle 
are erroneous. 
</P>
<P>
Eight are members of CAUSE, and four of them have endorsed Umberg. Umberg said 
the other four have not endorsed anyone. Representatives from some of the 
organizations were unavailable Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The ninth group, the Latino Peace Officers Assn., has apparently split into two 
factions with the same name, and the splinter groups have chosen opposite sides 
in the race. 
</P>
<P>
The groups in Pringle's mailer that have actually endorsed Umberg are the 
California State Police Assn., the Hospital Police Assn. of California, the 
State Park Peace Officers Assn. of California, and the California Fish and Game 
Wardens Protective Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Richard A. Holland, president of the Hospital Police Assn., complained Friday 
that CAUSE directors knew some of their affiliates had endorsed Umberg and 
should not have told Pringle he could use their names. 
</P>
<P>
"CAUSE doesn't have too much integrity," he said. "They have no right to say 
'Feel free to use the affiliates' names.' " 
</P>
<P>
Cecil E. Riley, president of CAUSE, and other officers of the group were 
unavailable for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Crime is the major issue for voters in Pringle's 72nd Assembly District, which 
includes Stanton and parts of Santa Ana, Westminster, Garden Grove and Anaheim, 
so police endorsements are a key factor in both campaigns.

About $800,000 worth of artworks and other property was seized from the Van 
Nuys home of alleged pornography kingpin Reuben Sturman to help pay off his 
$4.9-million tax bill, the Internal Revenue Service reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The property was taken Thursday from Sturman's sprawling home in the 13900 
block of Weddington Street and will be sold at a public auction to pay the back 
taxes, said Patricia Hudak, IRS assistant public affairs officer in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Sturman was convicted in Cleveland last year of violating banking requirements, 
conspiracy and tax fraud, after an investigation by the IRS that involved 
proceeds from an alleged pornography distribution empire. 
</P>
<P>
After his Nov. 17, 1989, conviction in Cleveland, Sturman was sentenced to 10 
years in prison and fined $2.46 million. He remains free on $1-million bail 
while appealing the conviction. He could not be located for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Sturman was not living in the Van Nuys house at the time of the seizure, but 
Los Angeles police said he resides elsewhere in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS did not reveal what specific items were taken from the 
5,610-square-foot, Tudor-style house in Van Nuys because the property list was 
sealed by court order, Hudak said. The IRS has also placed a tax lien against 
the football-field-size property, which is surrounded by a five-foot fence. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, IRS agents also seized property and placed a lien against a 
house in Cleveland owned by the 65-year-old Sturman, Hudak said. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the auction of property taken in both seizures will be used to 
defray $4.9 million in taxes and interest Sturman owes for the years 1978 
through 1982, Hudak said. 
</P>
<P>
Hudak said the seizures occurred because other efforts to collect the money 
from Sturman were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
"We ask for immediate payment," she said. "If that fails . . . enforcement 
action can be taken. We try to collect the money as quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Sturman, who was described in a 1986 presidential report as the world's largest 
distributor of pornography, is awaiting trial next month in Las Vegas on 
charges of racketeering and interstate transportation of obscene material.

KINGS GET 4TH WIN IN ROW; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: GRETZKY SCORES GOAL IN 5-2 VICTORY OVER WHALERS, BUT FALLS SHORT OF 
2,000 MARK.

<P>
Wayne Gretzky failed to reach the 2,000-point mark Friday night, settling for 
one goal to push his career point total to 1,997. 
</P>
<P>
No complaints from the Kings, however, who gained the two points in the 
standings they were seeking by beating the Hartford Whalers, 5-2, before a 
Forum crowd of 14,499. It gave the Kings a five-point edge in the Smythe 
Division over runners-up Vancouver and Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' victory, sparked by Tomas Sandstrom's two goals, was their fourth in 
a row, equaling their best winning streak from last season and improving their 
record to 6-1-1, best in the NHL. Their unbeaten string increased to six. 
</P>
<P>
"We're surprising a lot of people," Gretzky said. "Some people thought we'd be 
in last. It's not just that we're winning, but our goals-against is strong. 
When we're winning and holding the other guys to two goals or one goal, you 
know these guys are for real." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings have given up six goals in their last four games. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's goal, his seventh, went into an open net after the game was out of 
the Whalers' reach. Hartford dropped to 4-3-2, still good enough to lead the 
Adams Division. 
</P>
<P>
For the fifth consecutive game, the opposition came out on top in the 
shots-on-goal department, outshooting the Kings, 29-28. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal was to keep it under 30," said a happy Coach Tom Webster, who had 
stormed out of the clubhouse Wednesday night, after the Kings had given up more 
than 40 shots on goal for the third game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Those who had been hoping to see Gretzky break the 2,000 mark thought for a 
moment he might have broken something a lot more near and dear -- his right 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the scoreless first period, Gretzky and Hartford defenseman Brad Shaw 
collided. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky went up in the air and came crashing to the ice, flopping like a puppet 
on a string, his right hand smacking the ice. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky grimaced, obviously in pain. He had sliced his pinkieon his right hand. 
But after a quick trip to the bench for a bandage, he was back on the ice. No 
stitches were required, and Gretzky was able to continue playing. 
</P>
<P>
"I had tried to spin off him," said Gretzky of the collision with Shaw. "My 
hand hit the ice. My stick came down on it. And my knee came down on my stick. 
</P>
<P>
"My hand was pretty numb in the second period. It didn't seem like a serious 
injury and it's not, but it's a pain." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's injury was about the only moment worth mentioning in a quiet first 
period, but the pace picked up considerably after the intermission. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings started the puck rolling with a goal 4:44 into the period by Steve 
Duchesne, his second of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings increased their lead at 6:41 with Sandstrom's first goal of the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford got that back 55 seconds later on Scott Young's second goal of the 
season on a power play. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings moved out to a 3-1 lead at 4:45 of the third period on Todd Elik's 
fourth goal. 
</P>
<P>
But again the Whalers responded, this time answering 23 seconds later on Bob 
Holik's third goal of the season. Sandstrom added his second goal and fifth of 
the season at 9:25 on a power play. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, Gretzky seemed more relieved at avoiding a serious injury 
than disappointed at falling short of 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't go on too long," he said, "without my hands." 
</P>
<P>
Nor could the Kings, red hot or not. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Despite their quick start, the Kings began play Friday averaging about 1,100 
fewer fans per game than at this point last season, perhaps the result of 
higher ticket prices. In seven dates, the club has had only two sellouts. Last 
season, the Kings had four sellouts in their first seven dates en route to a 
club-record 31 full houses. 
</P>
<P>
King defenseman Tom Laidlaw, who hasn't played since March 17 because of back 
problems, hoped to return early next month. Cortisone shots had alleviated the 
pain in his back, but once Laidlaw got on the ice to practice, the pain 
returned. So his comeback is on hold again. In the meantime, Laidlaw will 
continue his new career, as color commentator for play-by-play announcer Nick 
Nickson on King radio broadcasts. . . . Defenseman Tim Watters, cleared to play 
for the first time since bruising ribs on Oct. 6, was scratched by Coach Tom 
Webster.

USC FEARS HISTORY WILL REPEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Written into the grass at Arizona Stadium -- in block letters that stretch 
between the 35-yard lines -- is the motivational reminder: "Bear Down." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Arizona, a similar message isn't painted onto the artificial 
turf at Oregon State's Parker Stadium, where last week the Wildcats were upset 
by the previously winless Beavers. 
</P>
<P>
The 35-21 loss all but eliminated Arizona from the Rose Bowl race and tried the 
patience of Coach Dick Tomey. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not pleased with where we are, but we've just got to accept that and go 
on," said Tomey, whose team is 4-2 overall and 2-2 in the Pacific 10 Conference 
going into today's game against USC (5-1, 2-1) at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
USC Coach Larry Smith called last week's game a disaster for Arizona and warned 
his team this week that such a humbling loss could serve to motivate the 
Wildcats, as last month's 31-0 loss to Washington seemed to revive the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, losing to the worst team in the conference is different than losing 
to the best. 
</P>
<P>
But to Smith, apparently, a train wreck is a train wreck. 
</P>
<P>
"We can expect a completely different Arizona team in here," he said. "I think 
we can expect them to play the best game of their lives, or of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes Arizona so dangerous is that they're where we were (after) 
Washington. They had a disaster. We came back the next week against Ohio State 
and played one of our best games. They're very capable of doing (the same 
thing)." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona, ranked as high as 16th this season and 21st after a dramatic 28-21 
victory over UCLA two weeks ago at the Rose Bowl, fell out of the top 25 after 
squandering a 21-14 third-quarter lead against Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats rank ninth in the Pac-10 in total offense and rank last in the 
conference in passing -- which should be good news to the Trojans, who have 
been outpassed in every game since their opener. 
</P>
<P>
George Malauulu, a sophomore from Carson High, started at quarterback last 
week, completing nine of 21 passes for 155 yards, but Tomey said Malauulu and 
Ronald Veal, a starter in 28 games for the Wildcats, will both play today. 
</P>
<P>
Malauulu collapsed after practice Tuesday and spent several hours in the 
University of Arizona hospital, where his condition was diagnosed as 
dehydration. He returned to practice Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"George has been a little more successful throwing the ball down the field, but 
Ronnie has thrown for a higher percentage," Tomey said of his quarterbacks, 
neither of whom is considered a threat to win a game with his passing alone. 
</P>
<P>
Veal has thrown 31 passes, completing 61.3% for 207 yards, and Malauulu has 
thrown 51, completing 43.1% for 408 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona's strength is its running game, which ranks second in the Pac-10, and 
its defense, which ranks third in the conference and is led by cornerback 
Darryl Lewis, a senior from Nogales High in La Puente whom many, including 
Tomey, consider the premier defensive back in college football. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just doing everything you could ask of a cornerback," Tomey said of 
Lewis, a converted running back who rushed for 1,423 yards as a senior at 
Nogales. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis made a game-saving tackle on Oregon quarterback Bill Musgrave at 
Arizona's one-yard line with nine seconds to play in a 22-17 victory over the 
Ducks last month and returned an interception 70 yards for the game-winning 
touchdown against UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got great speed on defense," Smith said of the Wildcats. "They've got 
by far the best secondary we've played -- in terms of both hitting and pass 
defense. It's like throwing into a tiger's teeth back there." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona knows about tigers. It ran into one last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of about 70,000 is expected for the homecoming game. . . . USC is 15-1 
against Arizona, the loss occurring in 1981, when the Trojans were 4-0 and 
ranked No. 1. They lost at the Coliseum, 13-10, against a team coached by Larry 
Smith. . . . USC has won its last six games against Arizona.

LAST DANCE WON'T BE SLOW FOR NOTRE DAME AND MIAMI

A moment of silence, please, for the rivalry that gave you fistfights and 
highlights, taunts and touchdowns, cakewalks and classics. 
</P>
<P>
At 12:30 p.m. today (Channel 2), sixth-ranked Notre Dame and second-ranked 
Miami will conclude a relationship that blissfully began in 1955, but ends 23 
games later amid veiled accusations of Irish cowardice and Hurricane thuggery. 
</P>
<P>
Wave goodby to one of the few rivalries that still causes goose bumps. Storied, 
tradition-dipped Notre Dame vs. the James Dean of college football, Miami. Or 
as it's labeled on the hot-selling T-shirts here these days: Catholics vs. the 
Convicts. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame says it is ending the series because future Irish schedules, which 
run through 2004, need more diversity. The Irish pride themselves on national 
schedules, meaning there is a turnover in opponents. In this case, Miami gets 
the boot after 23 games' worth of faithful service. 
</P>
<P>
In its defense, Notre Dame correctly points out that other longtime opponents, 
such as Michigan, will step aside in coming years for the likes of Florida 
State. In essence, Notre Dame is saying the decision was nothing personal. 
</P>
<P>
As you might expect, the Miami version of the story differs from the official 
Notre Dame explanation. A lot. 
</P>
<P>
The Hurricanes, whose schedule is set through 2000, offered to juggle or drop 
opponents so the rivalry could continue uninterrupted. Notre Dame declined. 
</P>
<P>
Miami tactfully mentioned the monetary benefits of such a series. After all, 
the last two games between the Irish and the Hurricanes gave CBS its highest 
college football rating each season. The 1987 game produced the second-highest 
rating. Notre Dame shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
And wouldn't a Hurricane-Irish matchup bring Notre Dame another huge payday for 
those games played at the Orange Bowl? NBC owns Notre Dame's home TV rights 
beginning next year, but that doesn't mean the Irish couldn't collect a hefty 
paycheck for a nationally televised road game on another network. 
</P>
<P>
"We have done everything possible to keep this game alive, both in the present 
and future," said Sam Jankovich, Miami's athletic director. "And we would have 
entertained any proposal from Notre Dame." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame wasn't in the proposing mood. Last August, Irish Athletic Director 
Dick Rosenthal told reporters that "nothing should be read into the fact that 
the series is ending. It was something planned many, many years ago. There 
should be no suggestion that Miami doesn't want to play Notre Dame or Notre 
Dame doesn't want to play Miami." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal also said that if an opening presented itself, Miami would be one of 
the first schools the Irish called. Well, there were openings, but Notre Dame 
signed Florida State and, later, West Virginia to contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they even called us," said Larry Wahl, Miami's associate 
athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Miami has its own reasons for the series' demise, beginning with the escalating 
ill will that surrounds the game. 
</P>
<P>
"They may feel it's gotten a little out of hand," Wahl said. 
</P>
<P>
A little out of hand? 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the teams traded punches outside the tunnel leading to the Notre Dame 
Stadium locker rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the teams almost engaged in another pregame fight, but Miami and 
Notre Dame coaches were able to separate the players before punches were 
thrown. 
</P>
<P>
"It became emotional maybe in the mid-'80s," Irish Coach Lou Holtz said earlier 
this week in a teleconference. "I read where the players accused Miami of 
spitting in their faces. I don't know what happened. That kind of talk fuels 
emotions for the next year when they play." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame leads the series, 14-7-1, but Miami has won five of the last six 
games and six of the nine games played in the 1980s. Before that, Notre Dame 
had won 10 consecutive games against the Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
If ever a rivalry caused a nation to take notice, this is the one. For the 
fourth time in as many years, Miami and Notre Dame start today's game ranked in 
the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
One other statistic of note: In the last three seasons, the winner of this game 
has gone on to win the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good rivalry," said Melvin Bratton, a former Hurricane running back 
(1983-87) who plays for the Denver Broncos. "I just think they're tired of 
getting beat by us." 
</P>
<P>
The rivalry was doing nicely until 1985, when the fourth-ranked Hurricanes 
destroyed the unranked Irish, 58-7. Miami, which was then coached by Jimmy 
Johnson, was accused of running up the score. 
</P>
<P>
"That kind of teed off Notre Dame fans around the whole country," Bratton said. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Bratton said the Hurricanes couldn't help running up the score, 
so bad were the Irish that year. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz and Miami Coach Dennis Erickson vowed that there would be no more fights. 
The last game between the Irish and the Hurricanes, they said, will also be the 
cleanest. Or so they say. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's going to be fine," Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going there to play a game," Erickson said in his weekly news 
conference. "(Fighting is) something of the past, and you won't see it." 
</P>
<P>
One other thing you won't see: a rematch.

UCLA'S DOMINANCE OF CAL IS IN JEOPARDY TODAY 
</P>

<P>
Streaks can be burdensome, not only for the teams on the losing side, but also 
the winners. 
</P>
<P>
Take the UCLA-California football series, for example. The Bears haven't beaten 
the Bruins since 1971, a string of 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
There's pressure to end the streak -- and also to maintain it. 
</P>
<P>
Today at Memorial Stadium in Strawberry Canyon, the Bears probably have their 
best opportunity in many years to beat the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
The game is rated a tossup. Cal has a better overall record than UCLA, 4-2 to 
3-3, and the Bears have won three consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
The teams have identical Pacific 10 Conference records, 2-1, so it's an 
elimination contest. A school is virtually out of contention in the Rose Bowl 
race with two losses. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach Terry Donahue says the streak is highly unusual, but also plausible. 
</P>
<P>
"In some years we just had better players and, in other years, we were lucky on 
occasion," he said. "However, last year and this year we're a lot more 
vulnerable to the streak (ending) than we have been in the past." 
</P>
<P>
After beating Cal last season, 24-6, the Bruins won only one more game the rest 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Snyder, who is in his fourth season as Cal's coach, says that his team 
has closed the talent gap against UCLA to some extent, adding, "That gives us 
some hope." 
</P>
<P>
At this point in the season, the Bears are usually out of the Rose Bowl race. 
</P>
<P>
"That we're in the seventh game and still talking about the conference 
standings is real refreshing," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
Cal's improvement is mainly due to its running game, which ranked ninth in the 
conference in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
With the addition of Russell White, a former Encino Crespi star, alternating at 
tailback with Anthony Wallace, formerly of Pasadena Community College, the 
Bears' rushing game is formidable on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
It ranks third in the conference, averaging 196.2 rushing yards. Wallace, the 
league's No. 2 rusher, is averaging 96.8 and White, No. 4 in the league, is 
averaging 81.8. 
</P>
<P>
White has scored 10 touchdowns, one of them on a 99-yard kickoff return against 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 6-foot, 200-pound White, who had to sit out a year because of academic 
restrictions, Cal quarterback Mike Pawlawski said: "He's one of the great ones. 
He has speed, natural instincts and great moves." 
</P>
<P>
White, Wallace and fullback Greg Zomalt operate behind an offensive line led by 
290-pound James Richards and 295-pound Ernie Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears are averaging 29.8 points, but their defense has given up an average 
of 31.3 points. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has similar statistics, averaging 26.2 points while yielding an average of 
30.3. Today's game could be one of those 40-35 affairs, either way. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, the Pac-10 required the Bruins to forfeit a 21-19 victory for using an 
ineligible player. However, the NCAA didn't adjust the record to include a 
forfeit. . . . Rushing update: Cal has averaged more than 3.2 yards a carry 
only once in the last 14 years. The Bears are averaging four yards a carry 
through six games this season. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA center Lance Zeno, who has been inactive because of sprained foot 
ligaments, is expected to start today. However, guard Vaughn Parker is 
sidelined because of an ankle injury and will be replaced by Mike Linn.

MELVIN DURSLAG: WORLD SERIES / CINCINNATI REDS VS. OAKLAND ATHLETICS;

<P>
It took a long time for those in charge of baseball to dissuade players from 
scratching themselves while games were on television. 
</P>
<P>
And some who didn't scratch would reach down gingerly, apparently needing 
assurance everything was still there. 
</P>
<P>
It was explained to the players: "Hey, you seem to forget you are being watched 
by zillions of people." 
</P>
<P>
So, for the most part, players stopped scratching and reaching down. All they 
do now is chew tobacco and dispense juice about the acreage. 
</P>
<P>
Some spit the stuff on the ground. Others in the dugout are seen spitting into 
a cup. Then you get a close-up of Bob Welch out at the mound, chewing 
industriously, a corner of his mouth soiled by tobacco liquid. 
</P>
<P>
And Eric Davis? His chomping is the cultural low spot of the World Series, 
further vulgarized by TV, which captures his face in such detail you can see 
tobacco churning within his teeth. 
</P>
<P>
It is a happy statistic that the majority of those who watch television don't 
chew tobacco. Looking at Davis, this species asks plaintively, "Where do we go 
to get sick?" 
</P>
<P>
You complain to TV and it shrugs, responding, "You want the story and we are 
giving it to you." 
</P>
<P>
Reconsidering, you aren't sure how you want the story. 
</P>
<P>
Another unique feature of the current World Series has been the appearances on 
the field at Cincinnati of owner Marge Schott and her faithful dog, Schottzie. 
</P>
<P>
The way the two have worked, Marge has done the talking while Schottzie has 
reclined on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
If the Series returns to Cincinnati, though, you are looking for the roles to 
be reversed. 
</P>
<P>
Marge didn't introduce four-legged creatures to the World Series. Eighteen 
years ago, Charlie Finley, then owner of Oakland, brought his mule, Charlie O., 
to the event. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie O. was a fine mule, of whom Finley was so proud that he brought him 
into the press room, where authors were at work. 
</P>
<P>
"I want you guys to meet Charlie O.," announced Finley, at which point Charlie 
O. commits a nuisance on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"Get him the hell outta here!" someone yells. 
</P>
<P>
Finley laughs. "What he has done is appropriate for what is being written," he 
answers. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of Jack Buck in the TV booth at this year's World Series is a 
pleasure to those who appreciate a calm environment at major sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
At 65, Jack isn't impressed by his assignment. Nor with the power it embodies. 
He doesn't bombard you with language or with anecdotes. His account is quiet. 
</P>
<P>
But what Jack does is keep you in the game. Many announcers in baseball and 
football today have fallen to talking so much that they stray from what's 
happening on the field. 
</P>
<P>
And it gets especially bad when two or three occupying the booth engage in 
interplay, gabbing, laughing, spinning stories. 
</P>
<P>
At times, they wander so far from focus that you plead with them to shut up. 
</P>
<P>
Buck doesn't invite an excessive amount of comment from his colleague, Tim 
McCarver, inspiring a broadcast that is businesslike and clear. 
</P>
<P>
Nor are the two fracturing each other with extravagant wit. 
</P>
<P>
Buck isn't the oldest guy to broadcast a major sports event, but he may be the 
most relaxed. Jack needs the work as he needs a hamstring pull, and he does it 
mainly because he owes it to his Muse. 
</P>
<P>
We can't picture another broadcaster on television who would have had the 
innards to wish all the best to Pete Rose, watching the Series in the 
jailhouse. 
</P>
<P>
For most people in the baseball business, including the Cincinnati ownership, 
Rose got too hot to handle. Saying something nice about a guy nailed on a 
felony seemed a political indiscretion not many cared to tackle. 
</P>
<P>
But Jack not only said hello to Pete on the air, but told him he tried 
unsuccessfully to reach him by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Unwittingly, on the part of Buck, this was a stroke of comedy. Did the slammer 
where Pete was watching the Series have a telephone jack where calls could be 
plugged in? 
</P>
<P>
Was it not like the celebrity table at Chasen's? 
</P>
<P>
But Rose was a pal of Buck's before Pete went afoul of the law and, in this 
incredible circumstance -- Cincinnati in the World Series and Rose in jail -- 
it seemed fitting, in Jack's judgment, to say hello. 
</P>
<P>
We kind of liked that. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, we are looking for Jack to say "Hi" to Leona Helmsley.

ATHLETICS ARE AT A LOSS TO EXPLAIN THEIR FALL FROM GRACE;

<P>
GAME 3: OAKLAND'S DYNASTY IN THE MAKING IS NOW ON THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION.

<P>
Even before his team's 8-3 humiliation in Game 3 of the World Series Friday 
night, Sandy Alderson, general manager of the Oakland Athletics, was struggling 
with the swiftly changing perception of the A's. 
</P>
<P>
Alderson, sitting in the dugout before the A's fell behind the Cincinnati Reds 
three games to none in the best-of-seven series, was asked if this was the 
unmaking of a dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
"I try not to deal in dynasty, legacy, travesty," he said. "One word synopses 
are beyond me, but we seem to have gone from one end of the spectrum to the 
other in 48 hours." 
</P>
<P>
Was that his opinion or that of the media? Alderson shook his head and said it 
seemed to be the media view. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, we were not at one end of the spectrum to start with and we're 
not at the other now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, but this much seems clear: 
</P>
<P>
Where the A's are now is on the verge of embarrassing extinction, and much 
closer to travesty than dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
"If we keep playing the way we've played the last two or three games, we're 
done," center fielder Dave Henderson said of a situation that finds the A's 
needing to win four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
He said it amid the sounds of silence in a clubhouse devoid of players for 
almost 20 minutes after media was admitted. 
</P>
<P>
A shock? An embarrassment? 
</P>
<P>
"Not if we can come back and play to our capability, but if we get beat playing 
the way we're playing, there's no other way to describe it," first baseman Mark 
McGwire said. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, right now they're the better team, it's that simple. There's no 
explanation, no excuses. We're getting smoked. They're hitting everything, 
scoring a lot of runs and flat out beating us." 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The A's have been outscored, 20-7, and are one for 23 with runners in 
scoring position. McGwire is three for 10 with no runs batted in, and Jose 
Canseco is one for 11 with two RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Booed by A's fans while going hitless in four at-bats Friday after being rapped 
by manager Tony La Russa and Dave Stewart following Wednesday's game, Bash 
Brother Canseco dressed in private and refused to speak with the media after 
this latest disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Oakland pitchers, who produced the American League's best earned-run 
average for a third consecutive season, have given up 38 hits and 16 earned 
runs in three games -- an ERA of 5.54 compared to 3.18 during the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"Am I shocked?" Dave Henderson said of the pitching breakdown. "No, I'm the 
center fielder. I saw the ball going to the plate. We're dealing with major 
league hitters who hit pitches they should hit. Sometimes you can get away with 
a pitch down the middle, but not as often as we're throwing them." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Moore, who won Game 3 of the American League playoffs 10 days earlier, 
didn't get away with it for long Friday. He faced 16 batters and yielded eight 
hits, including the two home runs by Chris Sabo. Moore, as did Stewart after 
Game 1, said he had good stuff but bad location. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't nervous at all, but I couldn't put my pitches where I wanted, and you 
can't make a mistake the way they're swinging," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, they're relaxed, seeing the ball and hitting it. Right now, they're 
more aggressive than any club we saw this year." 
</P>
<P>
And the A's catalogue of mistakes expands. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, for example, there was a costly error by McGwire on a no-chance 
throw by Dave Henderson that put another runner into scoring position, a stolen 
base when the A's pitcher (Scott Sanderson) went into a full windup and a 
booted double play ball by shortstop Mike Gallego. 
</P>
<P>
As a complement, the team once thought to be the best in baseball managed only 
seven hits and faces the possibility that its season could end tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart will try to extend the series and said he was undaunted, considering it 
a no-lose proposition. He predicted another four games, although no team has 
ever come back from a three-game deficit in the Series. 
</P>
<P>
"Am I making that call? Sure, I'm sticking my neck out, but anything can 
happen," Stewart said. "I mean, no one thought anyone would ever hit 715 home 
runs, but Henry Aaron did. I think I'm going to make it real tough on the Reds, 
and that will be the start of it." 
</P>
<P>
Time will tell. For the moment, the A's seem closer to being finished than 
getting started.

NO DISSENSION AS FAR AS LA RUSSA IS CONCERNED 
</P>

<P>
Manager Tony La Russa said Friday his remarks about Jose Canseco's outfield 
play Wednesday reflected an honesty that characterized his manner all season 
and did not indicate dissension on the Oakland club. 
</P>
<P>
La Russa had said Canseco should have been able to catch a fly ball by Billy 
Hatcher that became a triple and began an eighth-inning rally by the Cincinnati 
Reds in Game 2 at Riverfront Stadium. However, he stressed that he did not say 
the play had cost Oakland the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It happens all the time here, a guy saying, 'I don't think somebody's quite 
right,' " he said. "You people (reporters) lose credibility when you try to 
make something of that. If Stew (Dave Stewart) says Jose was distracted or I 
say he should make a play, it's not dissension." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who lost Game 1 and will start again tonight in Game 4, did not 
consider his comment about Canseco's lack of concentration either newsworthy or 
devastating. He said he had spoken with Canseco about it several times during 
the season and meant it as helpful advice rather than criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see it to be that fatal when I say that he's not bringing his total 
attention to each at-bat," Stewart said. "It's what I feel is distracting him 
from doing his job. I'm sure if he thought there was something I was doing that 
was distracting me, (he would say it) as constructive criticism. . . . I think 
sometimes ball-and-strike calls are big distractions for him. Not just Jose, 
but if you allow other things to interfere, it makes the one job you have to do 
tougher." 
</P>
<P>
Never reticent, Stewart said, "It's going to be tough for (the Reds) to win" 
tonight because he's enjoying the comforts of home. Stewart gave up four runs 
in four innings Tuesday night in the A's Series-opening 7-0 loss at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
"I like pitching on three days' rest versus five or versus four. I feel a lot 
more in control of what my body's doing and of my natural stuff," he said. "I'm 
pitching in a situation I like to pitch in with the fourth day. I'm real 
comfortable in this ballpark and I've had a chance to see that ballclub and see 
what they're capable of." 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Willie McGee and Stewart will probably be fined for arriving at the 
Oakland Coliseum less than an hour before Friday's game. 
</P>
<P>
A's spokesman Jay Alves said both players thought the game started at 8:30 
p.m., instead of the actual 5:30 p.m. start. 
</P>
<P>
McGee arrived at about 4:30 p.m., missing batting practice, and Stewart arrived 
at 4:50 p.m. Neither was in Friday's starting lineup, but Stewart was 15 
minutes late for a news conference in which he discussed his thoughts about 
starting Game 4 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart made the ceremonial first pitch to honor his selection as the 1990 
Roberto Clemente Award winner for community involvement. 
</P>
<P>
McGee hit for Mike Gallego in the seventh inning and struck out against 
reliever Rob Dibble. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Rijo, who will oppose Stewart tonight, said his initial concerns over a 
blood blister on the middle finger of his right hand have proven unfounded. 
Rijo pitched seven shutout innings in Game 1 before raising the blister, which 
he said he'd never had before. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it will interfere in any way," he said. "People think it's going 
to be a big deal but it won't be." 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on his experiences as a player in the Oakland Coliseum, Red Manager 
Lou Piniella said: "I never liked to hit here, but I think it had more to do 
with (former A's pitchers) Vida Blue, Catfish Hunter, Ken Holtzman and Rollie 
Fingers than the stadium itself. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing is more fun than managing, but I get more satisfaction out of coming 
here (to the Series) as a manager because I feel I was more responsible for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Billy Hatcher's World Series-record hitting streak ended in the first inning, 
when he grounded into a double play. Hatcher had five doubles and two singles 
(plus two walks) in his first seven Series at-bats. He was two for five Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Third base umpire Larry Barnett was unable to work Friday's game because of the 
flu. 
</P>
<P>
He was replaced by Bruce Froemming, a National League umpire who was working 
for CBS as an analyst on matters involving umpires. This is Froemming's fourth 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
The home run by Oakland's Harold Baines in the second inning was only the 10th 
by a designated hitter since the DH became part of the World Series in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time a player hit a home run in his first at-bat as a 
designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Fay Vincent said he is guardedly hopeful that talks with the 
National Assn. of Professional Baseball Leagues, which governs the minor 
leagues, will produce a new bargaining agreement in the next few weeks, 
allowing the major leagues to conduct their annual winter meetings in 
conjunction with the minor league convention, scheduled for Los Angeles in late 
November and early December. 
</P>
<P>
If there is no agreement, Vincent said, the major leagues will meet elsewhere 
-- reportedly in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner also said he continues to dislike the designated hitter rule 
and the impact it has on managerial moves and strategy, and may make a new 
attempt to have the American League revoke it. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Ross Newhan and Bill Plaschke contributed to this story.

SETTING KLECKO'S RECORD STRAIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A couple of former New York Jets, Joe Klecko and Joe Fields, decided to write a 
book last year. 
</P>
<P>
It's the tale of a couple of linemen, both of whom rose from low draft choices 
to NFL stardom. 
</P>
<P>
The book, actually written by Greg Logan, contains a version of Klecko's boxing 
career, which has outraged one buyer. When Bruce Blair was a heavyweight 
collegiate boxer at West Chester University, near Philadelphia, Klecko boxed 
for Temple University. "Klecko out-and-out lied about our bout in 1975, and I 
want to correct it," Blair said. "I've got newspaper clippings, all kinds of 
people who saw it, all kinds of proof. Can you help set the record straight?" 
</P>
<P>
In Klecko's recollection of his collegiate boxing days, he says he was known 
then as "Smokin' Joe" Klecko because he trained at Joe Frazier's Philadelphia 
gym. 
</P>
<P>
OK, there's a blinking red light. 
</P>
<P>
Klecko next says his Temple boxing career record was 25-1. 
</P>
<P>
That's incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
It was 25-2, and both losses were to Bruce Blair. 
</P>
<P>
Klecko acknowledges one loss to Blair, but attributes it in part to having had 
sex the afternoon before his fight against Blair. 
</P>
<P>
Klecko's version of Blair-Klecko I: "In the second round, all he did was run 
from me and I made the mistake of chasing him, when I had no legs. I beat the . 
. . out of the SOB. I said to the ref, 'Will you stop this? I don't want to 
hurt him anymore.' " 
</P>
<P>
Of the result, a unanimous, unquestioned decision for Blair, Klecko says: "We 
were fighting in his hometown, so they gave him a split decision." 
</P>
<P>
Here's how Randy Shantz of the West Chester Daily Local News covered that 
fight, March 16, 1975: 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Blair unleashed a punishing, two-fisted attack on Klecko, earning a 
unanimous decision. . . . Klecko, noticeably weary starting the third round, 
was overcome early by Blair's swarming flurries and sagged at the knees. . . . 
The bell sounded to end the fight and saved the Temple star from an inevitable 
knockout." 
</P>
<P>
Blair also points out there is a major omission from Klecko's recollection of 
his college boxing days -- Blair-Klecko II. Sure enough, Smokin' Joe doesn't 
have a word in there about the rematch. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe Joe just forgot about the rematch," Blair said. "If he hasn't forgotten 
about it he should, because that was Klecko's 'No mas' fight. He quit on his 
stool, like a dog." 
</P>
<P>
Reporter Shantz wrote: "When the second round ended, Klecko was obviously tired 
and somewhat shaky from Blair's punching. When he stayed on the stool as the 
bell rang for Round 3, referee John Fitzpatrick raised Blair's arm." 
</P>
<P>
That, according to Blair, was Klecko's last bout. He finished 25-2 as a 
collegian and Blair was 28-0. Blair continued to box as an amateur, in hopes of 
making the 1980 Olympic team, but failed. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe Klecko was the Mike Tyson of college boxing in those days, and I won't try 
now to take anything away from him, like he did to me in this book," said 
Blair, who now works for Top Rank Boxing in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
"He could have been a good pro boxer. He had great size, good hand speed and 
had some skills. 
</P>
<P>
"When I heard he'd written a book, I bought it. I figured there'd be 
complimentary stuff about me in there. But when I saw all that . . . , I really 
blew up. This whole thing makes me wonder if all these books written by 
ex-athletes -- are they all full of lies, like this one?" 
</P>
<P>
One of Blair's responsibilities at Top Rank is to keep an eye on Olympic gold 
medalist Kennedy McKinney, who, when Blair turned his back on him about two 
weeks ago, disappeared for nine days with his wife and infant son. 
</P>
<P>
McKinney, who has had a cocaine problem since he turned pro in 1988, missed a 
mandatory drug test after vanishing and everyone concerned feared the worst. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is fine now," Blair said. "Kennedy has been under a lot of scrutiny 
the past few months. He'd been clean, and he just felt a great need to get away 
from everyone with his family. 
</P>
<P>
"He went to L.A. for a few days. But we've made it clear to him we are very 
unhappy he did it without telling us, that we do not condone it. When he got 
back, he wanted to be tested right away. He was, and he tested clean." 
</P>
<P>
McKinney, dropped from Top Rank's Nov. 8 ESPN card at Bally's in Las Vegas, is 
back on the show. 
</P>
<P>
Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The California Athletic Commission finally is putting together a plan for 
random testing for illegal drugs at every state boxing show. . . . Top Rank's 
pay-per-view ($19.95) heavyweight doubleheader Jan. 11 features Ray 
Mercer-Francesco Damiani and Tommy Morrison-James Tillis. If time permits, 
Bruce Seldon-Tyrell Biggs will also be shown. 
</P>
<P>
Also on pay-per-view: Loreto Garza-Vinny Pazienza from Sacramento, Dec. 1, for 
$12.95. Promoter Don Chargin is looking for another big crowd for that one, 
after drawing 15,008 for Tony Lopez-Jorge Paez Sept. 22. Chargin has scaled 
Arco Arena seats for Garza-Pazienza from $100 to $27. . . . Guillermo Moreno of 
Beaumont and Albert Guardado of Colton won gold and silver medals, 
respectively, at the recent USA Amateur Boxing Federation's junior tournament 
at Fort Huachuca, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Promoter Don King says he has letters from three of boxing's governing bodies 
that, he says, require the winner of Buster Douglas-Evander Holyfield to next 
fight Mike Tyson. There has been talk of George Foreman getting a title shot 
before Tyson. . . . Former super-lightweight champion Lonnie Smith will fight 
Antonio Garcia of Mexicali in Las Vegas Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Because of rules forbidding special exhibitions of amateur boxers on pro cards, 
the nation's best amateur boxer, Oscar de la Hoya of East L.A., will be 
virtually unseen in his own town before he goes to the 1992 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
What's wrong with having de la Hoya and another Southland national champion, 
Shane Mosley of Pomona, appear in two three-round undercard matches, under 
amateur rules, on a Forum pro boxing show, with any money paid going to their 
club? 
</P>
<P>
Paul Konnor, USA Amateur Boxing Federation officer from Milwaukee, says the 
rule is an international one, not a USA/ABF rule. "We don't like the rule, and 
it's going to get even tougher," Konnor said. "Now, they're talking about a 
rule prohibiting any trainer of pro boxers from working the Olympics or world 
championships." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Rooney, Tyson's fired trainer, won Round 1 in his wrongful-termination 
suit against the former heavyweight champion when a New York judge denied a 
motion for dismissal of the case Friday.

ULTIMATUM PRESENTED BY ARNOLD; 
</P>
<P>
HORSE RACING: HE THREATENS TO DROP HARNESS RACING AT LOS ALAMITOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHERWA, TIMES ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lloyd Arnold, president and general manager of Los Alamitos Race Course, told a 
special subcommittee of the California Horse Racing Board on Friday that he 
will pull harness racing out of Los Alamitos if additional weeks of racing are 
not approved at Pomona's Fairplex Park for 1991 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold, who appeared before the committee that recommends racing dates, said 
that if the CHRB does not approve 18 weeks of harness racing at Pomona, he will 
ask that the board rescind all his dates for 1991 and 1992 because the sport 
will not be viable in California. 
</P>
<P>
"If you say we are not going to run at Pomona, then you are saying we should 
not run harness racing," Arnold said. "Instead, we're going to come back and 
apply for thoroughbred dates during that time. And if we have to build a mile 
track to do that, we will. We've already had architects and engineers out there 
looking." 
</P>
<P>
The special four-hour meeting in Burbank was punctuated by several 
interruptions and one harness trainer was asked to leave. 
</P>
<P>
The harness interests say the sport will die without year-round racing in 
Southern California. The opposition comes mostly from Hollywood Park and Santa 
Anita, whose horsemen use Pomona as a training track. There are about 500 
thoroughbreds at Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
If Arnold's demand is met, there will be daytime racing at the thoroughbred 
tracks overlapping racing of quarter horses at Los Alamitos and harness horses 
at Pomona during the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Don Robbins, general manager at Hollywood Park, said the overlap racing would 
adversely affect the thoroughbred handle. He cited 1986, when three tracks ran 
on the same day. Hollywood's fall meeting lost 15.5% in attendance and 14% in 
handle during that period, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The harness interests contended that the average on-track handle at Hollywood 
Park dropped almost $600,000 between 1985 and 1987 and the average handle at 
Pomona was only $262,000, so that there were other forces besides overlap 
racing at work. Since then, satellite wagering has increased handles at all 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee members, Leslie Liscom, Henry Chavez and Rosemary Ferraro, all 
said they needed more time and would not offer a recommendation to the board. 
The full board of the CHRB will rule on Friday.

A POIGNANT TRIBUTE TO BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just about every symphony orchestra in America, and beyond, must be thinking 
about Leonard Bernstein this week. The man left his mark. 
</P>
<P>
Hasty tributes to the late 
conductor-composer-pianist-educator-writer-philosopher-showman are virtually 
imperative at current concerts from Albuquerque to Zanzibar. Many music 
directors have added the elegiac Adagietto from Mahler's Fifth Symphony to 
their scheduled agendas, simultaneously honoring Bernstein himself and his 
crusading efforts on behalf of the Austrian master he so desperately wanted to 
emulate. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein would, no doubt, have approved. He might have been even happier, 
however, with memorials involving music of his own. He always chafed at the 
suggestion that he was, even by temporal default, a conductor first and a 
composer second. 
</P>
<P>
At the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on Thursday, Andre Previn opened the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic program with a little Bernstein. In place of Berlioz's 
overture to "Beatrice et Benedict," Previn interpolated "A Simple Song" from 
Bernstein's "Mass." It turned out to be an unhappily revealing choice. 
</P>
<P>
The "Simple Song" is a slushy song, a trivial song. Affecting in its 
unabashedly sentimental way, it is most interesting because of a few unexpected 
harmonic quirks. It is instantly hummable yet eminently forgettable. As 
orchestrated by Irwin Kostal, it sounds like a good excuse for lyric calm 
between raucous storms at the Boston Pops. 
</P>
<P>
Inadvertently, this tribute suggested that Bernstein's most notable gift to 
posterity may have been re-creative rather than creative. There's nothing wrong 
with that. It is only a question of priority and pretense. 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of the program, Bloch's Schelomo, had been planned all along as 
a vehicle for Yo-Yo Ma. Under the mournful circumstances, the conductor and 
cellist dedicated their performance to Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
It was a generally splendid performance, at once taut yet intense, heroic yet 
melancholic. Unlike some celebrated predecessors, Ma does not bathe the 
rhetoric in pulsating tone and gushing passion. His favors lean outlines and a 
somewhat muted dynamic scheme. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, his introspection ennobled the rhapsodic drama. His virtuosity 
remains its own reward, and ours. 
</P>
<P>
Previn provided a sympathetic symphonic framework. The accompaniment proved 
more remarkable for sensitivity, however, than for precision. 
</P>
<P>
The mood lightened drastically, and agreeably, after intermission with a suite 
fusing snippets of Shakespeare with the score Mendelssohn composed for "A 
Midsummer Night's Dream." Here, Previn made the orchestra play with ample charm 
and propulsive energy, if not with the gossamer delicacy one ideally associates 
with music of elfin enchantment. 
</P>
<P>
He supported his incidental singers thoughtfully. He also enjoyed a fine 
rapport with Claire Bloom, the stellar Shakespearean narrator. 
</P>
<P>
Bloom brought subtle definition to various character identities and benefited 
from Previn's sense of dramatic timing. Although over-amplified, she elegantly 
understated the poetry and, with rhythmic inflection and cantilena stress, even 
hinted at a basic musical subtext. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Beardsley, Marzelline in the recent Music Center "Fidelio," sang the 
solos of the soprano fairy with exquisite point and a touch of rapture. Her 
efforts were sweetly seconded by the mezzo-soprano, Stephanie Vlahos. The Los 
Angeles Children's Chorus, trained by Rebecca Thompson, piped its cheery 
refrains cheerily.

DOUGLAS IS AFI LIFE ACHIEVEMENT WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE DUTKA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American Film Institute has named Kirk Douglas the 1991 recipient of its 
prestigious Life Achievement Award. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made on Friday, which, coincidentally, was the 30th 
anniversary of the Los Angeles premiere of "Spartacus" -- one of Douglas' most 
memorable roles. 
</P>
<P>
"This award is special because it was voted by my peers and recognizes a whole 
body of work," Douglas, 74, told The Times. "It's a nice pat on the back and, 
if you've read my autobiography, you know that that's always been very 
important to me." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, in the south of France shooting a film, was informed of his selection 
by film institute trustee Steven Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
With his clipped delivery and famed cleft chin, Douglas has been one of 
Hollywood's more enduring leading men, snagging three best actor Oscar 
nominations (1949's "Champion," 1952's "The Bad and the Beautiful," and 1956's 
"Lust for Life") in his more than 60 feature film performances. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood, says the star of such films as "Seven Days in May" (1964) and "The 
Brotherhood" (1968), was never his goal. "I always wanted to be a stage actor, 
so in this sense, I'm a failure. I haven't done anything live since 'One Flew 
Over the Cuckoo's Nest' (1963)." 
</P>
<P>
Last seen on the screen in 1986's "Tough Guys," the actor recently shifted his 
focus to writing. 
</P>
<P>
His autobiography, "The Ragman's Son," was published in 1988 and his first 
novel, "Dance With the Devil" (1990), will be adapted for the screen. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas is shooting Xavier Castano's "Welcome to Veraz," co-starring the noted 
French actor Gerard Depardieu. 
</P>
<P>
Like "Lawrence of Arabia," directed by last year's Life Achievement winner, Sir 
David Lean, "Spartacus" (1960) is being restored at a cost of between $600,000 
and $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
Coordinated by Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, and Universal Pictures chief Tom 
Pollock, the new version will contain 15 minutes of footage cut from the 
original and is scheduled for release early next year. 
</P>
<P>
As the 19th recipient of the film institute's honor, Douglas joins such 
previous recipients as Billy Wilder, Gene Kelly, Lillian Gish and Bette Davis. 
He will be honored March 7 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.

KCET CLAIMS BIAS, WON'T AIR ANY NEW 'AFRICA NOW' SHOWS; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: A CONSERVATIVE MEDIA GROUP CLAIMS VICTORY AFTER ITS LETTER-WRITING 
CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Claiming that the series "South Africa Now" is biased in favor of the African 
National Congress, programmers at Los Angeles public-television station KCET 
have decided not to carry the public-affairs program when its new season begins 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
The Committee on Media Integrity, a conservative media coalition, claimed 
victory Friday for the decision. The group, led by David Horowitz, a former 
Ramparts magazine editor who went on to co-author the book "Destructive 
Generation: Second Thoughts About the '60s," has been waging a letter-writing 
campaign and threatening legal action against KCET Channel 28 for airing "South 
Africa Now" and other programs that it claims have a leftist bias. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz, who said he is opposed to apartheid but also is opposed to the 
African National Congress, said that he had had several meetings about "South 
Africa Now" with Stephen Kulczycki, senior vice president and station manager 
at KCET. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that the show was posing as a news report, but it was really just doing 
propaganda," Horowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Kulczycki denied Friday that pressure from Horowitz's group had anything to do 
with his decision not to renew the series, which has been running on Sundays at 
9 a.m. He said that "South Africa Now," which is produced in New York by 
Globalvision Inc. and is seen on 80 U.S. public-TV stations, gives only cursory 
attention to views of liberal whites and blacks, as well as to the South 
African government and others who differ with the policies of the African 
National Congress, the party of Nelson Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
"As time has gone by, it appears more clear that the main issue in South Africa 
is not whether there will be apartheid, but what kind of anti-apartheid 
government in South Africa would come into power," Kulczycki said. "When it 
('South Africa Now') was an advocacy program and the only issue was apartheid, 
that was something many people were willing to accept. But in recent weeks and 
months, the story has become more complicated and the producers don't seem to 
want to present a broad spectrum of views." 
</P>
<P>
Kulczycki said that KCET was planning to run a number of specials about South 
Africa, which would present all sides of the issues there. And he said that if 
Globalvision were to produce specials instead of a series, he would consider 
them "on a case-by-case basis." 
</P>
<P>
The decision not to renew "South Africa Now" has sparked anger and surprise 
among leaders in Southern California's African-American community, who have 
begun to wage a telephone and letter-writing campaign of their own to urge the 
program's re-instatement. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever happened to the marketplace of ideas?" said Gerald Horne, a professor 
of black studies at the University of California at Santa Barbara. "I guess 
KCET is saying that their marketplace is limited, that you can only do a 
certain amount of shopping there." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Robert Farrell, who has been active in the 
anti-apartheid movement, said Friday that he is so outraged by KCET's action 
that he is considering asking the council to withhold funding from the station 
next year. Last year, city-approved grants to KCET totaled $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
"KCET puts its integrity on the line with this decision," Farrell said. Even if 
the program does focus on the African National Congress, Farrell said, "The ANC 
is in fact engaged in a discussion with the South African government leading to 
what is going to be a democracy in South Africa. (KCET) says the ANC is not the 
voice of the South African majority -- (South African President) F. W. De Klerk 
obviously thinks it is." 
</P>
<P>
Farrell said that he is working with other leaders in the black community to 
oppose the decision. And the councilman said he plans to meet personally with 
members of the KCET board of directors and with station president William 
Kobin. 
</P>
<P>
Horne said that he has watched "South Africa Now" every week since it went on 
the air in 1989 and does not believe that it is biased. 
</P>
<P>
"It covered the black consciousness movement, it covered Desmond Tutu, it 
covered the Pan African Congress, and it covered the white minority regime," 
Horne said. "I take it that those who opposed 'South Africa Now' would also 
have opposed a show on opposition to Idi Amin or the opposition to Germany in 
1936 and wanted balance there." 
</P>
<P>
Danny Schechter, executive producer of "South Africa Now," said that he 
resented the claim that his program was biased. "I have won several news Emmys, 
including two national Emmys for work on (ABC's) '20/20,' where I was a 
producer for nine years," Schechter said. "I've been a Nieman Fellow at 
Harvard. I've been covering this issue for 20 years."

BATTLE OF TWO TV STRATEGIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT EPSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Americans are going through a major change in their television viewing habits, 
a trend that can only get stronger in the '90s. That's the real significance of 
this week's report by a group of television researchers that found 
significantly more people are turning to cable and staying there. 
</P>
<P>
A victory of sorts for the niche strategists. A setback for the networks and 
their date-book planners. 
</P>
<P>
Niche programming works this way: Think small. Spend less. Find your place in 
television's universe with very specific programs for, hopefully, very 
specific, dedicated viewers. An example: the MTV Networks that aim at young 
music fans on MTV, older music followers on VH1, nostalgia collectors on Nick 
at Nite and now HA! for people who desperately seek laughter. In contrast, 
date-book programming works this way: Get viewers to date their television set. 
If it's Monday it must be Murphy, the Sugarbakers and Rosie. If it's Thursday 
it must be the Huxtables, Sam and Carla. 
</P>
<P>
Cable programmers had to be inventive. They didn't have the budgets and the 
revenues to compete directly with the traditional Big-Three-and-a-Half 
networks. Rather than going broad, they went narrow. MTV's chant about wanting 
MTV was more an anthem for all of cable than a repetitive, singular advertising 
slogan. 
</P>
<P>
Thus cable developed themed networks and new audiences: niches for news (CNN 
and Headline News), sports (ESPN, Prime Ticket, SportsChannel), government 
affairs (C -- SPAN 1 and 2), children's programs (Nickelodeon). Almost every 
cable network is identified with specific programming. Lifetime for women's 
interests, USA for reruns and sports, A &amp; E and Bravo for the arts. 
</P>
<P>
Now there are sub-niches: weather, golf, show business news, home shopping, 
country-Western music, nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
Consider comedy. This year two cable networks aimed at comedy went on the air: 
HBO spawned the Comedy Channel, the MTV Networks produced HA! Comedians earlier 
had established a place on cable with successful stand-up shows on HBO, 
Showtime and A &amp; E. Comedy was a natural. While the networks spent hundreds 
of thousands on sitcoms and hoped they'd pay off in advertising and future 
markets, the cable programmers, limited in money, thought cheap. For as little 
as $20,000 you could get a half hour of comedy with a crew taping at the Improv 
or at a concert. And you weren't limited by the inflexibility that networks 
face in scheduling shows. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the No. 1 network in ratings was the one with the No. 1 comedy 
sitcom. To get attention try funny. To win large audiences, get them to laugh. 
To some extent that's what the people at HA! are thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've done is create an environment for viewers," explained Debby Beece, 
senior vice president of programming at HA! "The whole channel is an 
environment, a home base for comedy. That's different from traditional 
television comedy. The viewer knows when they punch up HA! they'll get comedy 
after comedy." 
</P>
<P>
Six months old, HA! is edging toward getting into 10 million homes by the end 
of this year, having just completed a deal with Cox Cable Communications and 
Cencom Cable Associates in Los Angeles for the HA! network. The break-even 
point for most cable networks is 25 to 30 million homes. Hitting that mark 
could conceivably turn a deficit into million-dollar profits. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy in developing HA!'s niche was a mixture of the practical and the 
creative. Currently, most of HA! shows are television sitcom reruns heavily 
from the MTM library. HA! is counting on Rhoda and Mary and Phyllis and Bob and 
Steve to lure the 18- to 49-year-olds the network lust after. At the same time 
the network isn't counting on just name familiarity and nostalgia. It wants to 
establish a unique base. 
</P>
<P>
Almost one-fourth of the programs on the 24-hour service are original shows, 
shows that the network's executives hope in time will become classics on their 
own. "Random Acts of Variety" is an attempt to bring back variety programming, 
but this time with a brashness and an attitude. The game show "Clash" brings 
together contestants of opposite persuasion (nudists versus fashion designers, 
butchers versus vegetarians). Two nights of the week are devoted largely to 
original program. Co-production deals have been developed with Hollywood 
producers for additional half-hour, one-act comedies or stories. Jackie Mason 
will soon find a new home with his own show on HA! Collections of the best (or 
worst) of cable access shows will become a new form of comedy show. 
</P>
<P>
Creative ways of developing cash-flow to support the new network beyond 
advertisers have also been developed by the MTV Networks. The "Clash" format 
has been sold to foreign broadcasters. Some versions of "Saturday Night Live," 
to which the MTV Networks has international rights, are being marketed 
overseas. MTV has a European version and recently completed a deal for an hour 
video show in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, Ted Turner and his Cable News Network showed how a new concept 
in news coverage could be developed cheaply yet extensively. Twenty-four hours 
of news available when wanted. Now Turner has two news networks. 
</P>
<P>
Not all niches are winners. The Financial News Network is having its problems. 
Some ethnic networks haven't attracted sufficient viewers to stay around. 
Several others are struggling. 
</P>
<P>
But niches big and small have begun to add up. The trend seems to favor more of 
them. Tom Freston, chairman and chief executive officer of MTV Networks, sees 
the number of channels offered by local cable companies moving from 35 to 55. 
Specialized services -- more comedy, more sports, pay-per-view, health -- will 
fill those spots. Dennis Miller, former president and chief operating officer 
of Think Entertainment and now executive vice president of Turner Network 
Television, earlier this year told a group of independent filmmakers that by 
the end of the '90s there might be 100 to 200 cable networks looking for shows. 
</P>
<P>
Will the networks be ready for the Attack of the Killer Niches? Maybe we 
shouldn't worry about the networks. Will we be ready?

SOUTHWEST SOCIETY OPENS 4TH SEASON

<TEXT>
<P>
In today's conservative musical world of brand names and recycled repertory, 
the presenter with the courage to offer unhackneyed music is usually new to the 
game or about to lose it. 
</P>
<P>
Not so the Southwest Chamber Music Society, which survives, and opened its 
fourth season Thursday night in Salmon Hall at Chapman College. Southwest, to 
call it by its first name, specializes in the unusual and neglected, and seems 
to draw an enthusiastic audience also friendly to discovery. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the society's players -- a flexible ensemble of 11 members, 
plus guests -- appear to operate several notches above the mainstream of 
ad-hoc, temporary groups often producing in this musical neighborhood: At its 
best, the organization makes music in a serious and polished way. 
</P>
<P>
The performances given at Chapman on Thursday -- and scheduled to be repeated 
Friday night in Pasadena -- lived up to that standard. 
</P>
<P>
Led by violinist Peter Marsh, the quintet playing Brahms' Opus 111 and the 
United States premiere of Anthony Payne's "Consort Music" -- violinist Lawrence 
Sonderling, violists Jan Karlin and Robin Ross, and cellist Richard Treat -- 
did so with passion, deep detailing and a projected sense of style. 
</P>
<P>
There were areas of unfinished preparation in the wondrous G-major Quintet -- 
some overplaying here, misgauging of balances there, momentary lapses of 
intonation. But they did not harm the overall sweep of the piece, a work of 
valedictory statements despite its heroic stance. 
</P>
<P>
Payne's haunting but active quarter-hour essay on introversion/extroversion 
turned out a strong contrast to Brahms' less reserved musical oratory. Atonal 
in dialect, emotionally dichotomous "Consort Music" leaves the listener feeling 
spent but optimistic. Nothing seemed tentative. 
</P>
<P>
This program began with piano. In memory of Leonard Bernstein, Albert Dominguez 
played "Five Anniversaries" (1954) with all its cherishable Americanisms 
intact: wit, directness, sentiment, sassiness and vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
Then, to open the program proper, Marsh and Dominguez gave a reading of Elgar's 
Second Sonata that reminded us again of the grandeur of much of the British 
composer's output. An elegant duo, Marsh-Dominguez produced a comprehensive and 
full-throated aural view of this handsome, deeply felt, aristocratic and 
sometimes self-mocking score. Why do we not hear it more often? DANIEL CARIAGA

LEONARD BERNSTEIN REMEMBRANCES; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: MORE LOCAL TRIBUTES FOR THE CONDUCTOR-COMPOSER ARE PLANNED ON SUNDAY. 
</P>

<P>
In addition to the Leonard Bernstein tribute that is part of the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic program this weekend, other local orchestras are also planning 
special remembrances. Sunday at Royce Hall, the American Youth Symphony has 
added local composer Leon Levitch's Elegy for Strings -- a personal choice from 
conductor Mehli Mehta -- to the program to honor Bernstein, who died last 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Also, opening the new season of the Glendale Symphony season on Sunday at 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, music director Lalo Schifrin will observe a moment 
of silence to honor his longtime friend and colleague. 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, KUSC-FM (91.5) devoted its entire day of live broadcasting, from 6 
a.m. to 10 p.m., to performances -- as conductor and pianist -- and 
compositions of Bernstein, including an unusual recording from 1956 of him 
discussing Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
KKGO-FM (105.1) also devoted a considerable amount air time to Bernstein's work 
on Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Another measure of grief came from the obituary section of the New York Times, 
which includes a section of special classified ads for public condolences at 
$15.85 a line. The outpouring of emotions following Bernstein's death filled 
almost 200 lines (15 inches of small type) and encompassed 14 separate 
tributes. Among the contributors were conductors Zubin Mehta and Kurt Masur, as 
well as Peter Martins of the New York Ballet and Christopher Keene of the New 
York City Opera. 
</P>
<P>
"Leonard Bernstein . . . is now being mourned by the entire world. I personally 
have lost a dear friend." wrote Mehta in his tribute. "I was proud to be 
associated with him at the New York Philharmonic and the Israel Philharmonic 
Orchestra, both of which he considered family." 
</P>
<P>
"This is perhaps not unusual for a prominent member of the Jewish community 
involved with philanthropic activities," reported Irv Horowitz, the New York 
Times obituary editor. He said the biggest similar reaction he could recall 
came after the recent death of the mother of the New York Times publisher. 
"That was considerably larger," Horowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bernstein family has requested contributions in lieu of flowers be made to 
the Bernstein Education Through the Arts Fund Inc., 25 C.P.W., Suite 1B, New 
York, N.Y. 10023.

SHRIMPS IN HIGHWAYS SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When they're really cooking, members of the local performance art group Shrimps 
can reveal antic and unexpected connections among sports, games, everyday 
behavior and stereotypic gender roles. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, very little of that happened when the group entered the final 
round of the current "Dance Traffic" series Thursday at Highways in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
(The final performance is tonight.) 
</P>
<P>
In their most focused and tightly organized work, "Scrap" (from 1987), men in 
business suits (Ryan Hill, Martin Kersels and Steven Nagler) and women in 
athletic shorts and shirts (Weba Garretson and Cindy Furchner) turned the 
dribbling of basketballs into competitive challenges, dodgeball games, 
strip-tease acts and wrestling bouts. Somehow, the evolution looked inevitable. 
Nothing seemed arbitrary. 
</P>
<P>
Described as a work in progress from which excerpts were drawn, "Tongue," not 
surprisingly, failed at this stage to cohere very much. More links occurred 
through its use of shadow-theater techniques (including wicked projections of 
simulated sex acts) than by its thematic gender reversal obsessions. (Alder 
Dixon and Nicole Soulanille joined the others for the piece.) 
</P>
<P>
"Looks" (1990), however, had no excuse for its sprawling, indulgent messiness. 
By now, seeing the boys mincing about in various degrees of stripped-down drag 
and the girls flexing their powerhouse muscles had become routine, and antic 
gave way to frantic. Or maybe, desperate. 
</P>
<P>
The girls looked up the boys' dresses, the boys played pick-up sticks with 
brooms, everyone carried or pushed or posed with or hurled down giant gourds. 
At the end, the men were vanquished, the women triumphed, the gourds were ready 
for puree. 
</P>
<P>
Pamela Casey choreographed "Tongue" and "Looks." Steve Stewart and Mark Wheaton 
composed serviceable music for "Tongue" and, with Garretson, for "Looks." CHRIS

KID BEAT: UNEVEN START AT SERENDIPITY WITH '4TH GRADE NOTHING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three-year-old Farley Drexel Hatcher, Fudge for short -- is driving 10-year-old 
brother Peter bonkers. He is noisy, messes up Peter's homework, sends Peter's 
pet turtle Dribble to a dark fate that no turtle deserves, and his birthday 
party is the stuff of parental nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
Worst of all, everyone thinks he is so cute. Poor Peter. 
</P>
<P>
The new Serendipity Theatre Company at the Coronet, Los Angeles' only 
full-time, Equity-contract children's theater, is off to a rambunctiously 
funny, but uneven start with its version of the comic "Tales of a Fourth Grade 
Nothing," based on Judy Blume's super children's book. 
</P>
<P>
If W.C. Fields were around, he would avoid this show like the plague. On 
opening night, tiny, 6-year-old Klee Bragger, a natural as Fudge, captivated a 
delighted audience every time he appeared. Breathy audience Awwwws greeted him 
throughout. (L. R. Davidson alternates in some performances.) 
</P>
<P>
Josh Wheeler as Peter, and professionals Lauren Cole and Tim Kahle as Mom and 
Dad, along with Joyce Guy, Katy Henk and David Nathan Schwartz in multiple 
roles, bowed to the inevitable and provided enthusiastic backup. 
</P>
<P>
The glitch is in the staging. Some timing lags and uncertain light cues are 
correctable, but two of co-directors Jody Johnston-Davidson's and Scott 
Davidson's choices are more problematic. They have given their cast an obstacle 
course of black-and-white cartoon-style sets and props. The look is appealing, 
but the clutter blocks audience sight lines and gives the actors too much 
maneuvering to think about. 
</P>
<P>
And, although they get laughs, the adults playing secondary child roles loom 
over the diminutive Klee and look and sound out of place next to the real 
thing. This makes Blume's famous tinkle scene appear unnecessarily coy. 
</P>
<P>
Crisper staging would do justice to Bruce Mason's hoot of a script. Even so, 
parents can be prepared for frequent repetitions of dialogue; this fatherly 
riposte was gleefully repeated by young theatergoers: "Eat it or wear it!" 
</P>
<P>
 At 366 N. La Cienega Blvd., West Hollywood, through Nov. 25, Fridays-Saturdays 
at 7:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 p.m., Sundays at 1 and 4 p.m. $6 per child (13 and 
younger); $10 per adult. (213) 652-9199.

The World Series will share the sports television spotlight with Bo Jackson's 
1990 National Football League debut and the annual installment of what has 
become one of college football's most heated rivalries: Miami vs. Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
The Cincinnati Reds, who went into Friday's Game 3 with a 2-0 lead over the 
Oakland Athletics, are in position to complete one of the biggest upsets in 
World Series history when coverage of Game 4 begins at 5 p.m. on Channels 2 and 
8, with the first pitch coming at 5:24. The telecast of Sunday's Game 5, if 
necessary, also starts at 5 p.m., with the first pitch at 5:37. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders, tied with the Miami Dolphins for the best record in the AFC (5-1) 
and who lead the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC West by one game, add Bo Jackson 
to the backfield Sunday against the San Diego Chargers (2-4) (1 p.m., Channels 
4, 36 and 39). In his limited NFL career, Jackson has rushed for 212 yards in 
three games against the Chargers, including 103 yards last season. 
</P>
<P>
With the Rams failing to sell out 72 hours in advance of Sunday's game against 
the Atlanta Falcons at Anaheim Stadium, Channels 2 and 8 will air the 
Philadelphia Eagles-Washington Redskins game at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The only other NFL game to be shown by a Southland station matches the Denver 
Broncos and Indianapolis Colts on KMIR Channel 36 in Palm Springs. That game, 
which also marks the return of running back Eric Dickerson to the Colts, begins 
at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no Sunday night game on TNT. The NFL and TNT did not want to 
compete against the World Series for viewers. 
</P>
<P>
In college football, today's premiere attraction is the final game of the 
often-contentious Miami-Notre Dame series, 12:30 p.m. on Channels 2 and 8. 
(SportsChannel will air a replay at 10:30 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
In other telecasts involving teams ranked in the Top 25 by The Associated 
Press, No. 22 Iowa faces No. 10 Michigan (9:30 a.m. ESPN); Arkansas visits No. 
19 Texas (10 a.m. Prime Ticket); No. 13 Washington takes on Stanford (12:30 
p.m., Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42); No. 3 Tennessee hosts Alabama (1 p.m., ESPN) 
and No. 7 Florida State meets No. 5 Auburn (4:30 p.m. ESPN). 
</P>
<P>
Three games involving Southland teams will also get television exposure. No. 15 
USC tries to keep its Rose Bowl hopes alive against Arizona at 3:30 p.m. on 
Prime Ticket, KADY Channel 63 airs the Cal Lutheran-La Verne game at 1:30 p.m. 
while Cal State Long Beach challenges perennial Big West Conference power 
Fresno State at 7 p.m. on SportsChannel. STEVEN HERBERT

BART VS. BILL: 'COSBY' TAKES ROUND 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In round two of TV's heavyweight clash between "The Simpsons" and the 
Huxtables, "The Cosby Show" opened a lead Thursday night after finishing in a 
virtual dead heat with Fox's cantankerous cartoon clan the week before. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's "Cosby" was seen in about 17.2 million homes, compared to about 15.1 
million for "The Simpsons." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Fox executives said that they were thrilled with the showing 
because, among the teen and young-adult viewers that Fox and its advertisers 
prize most, "The Simpsons" has been beating "Cosby" handily. "Cosby's" rating 
is bolstered by heavy viewership among people over 50. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, "The Simpsons" continues to be the No. 1 choice, as 39% of all 
television sets in use between 8 and 8:30 Thursday night were tuned to 
Fox-owned KTTV Channel 11. "Cosby" was the choice of 26% of the area's viewers.

COMPUTAINMENT: 'FACES' STACKS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANE deCOSTER and DAVID CROOK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unlike many arcade games, "Faces" does not encourage you to destroy worlds, and 
errors do not result in gory deaths. This addicting and overall quite pleasant 
little game could foster a mild curiosity about the faces caricatured on the 
screen, and by playing you do your part to improve U.S.-Soviet trade relations. 
</P>
<P>
Spectrum HoloByte's "Faces . . . Tris III" is the third offering from Soviet 
designer and programmer Alexey Pajitnov. It builds on the theme of his earlier 
two games, "Tetris" and "Weltris." All three games use a deceptively simple 
stacking technique to assemble coherent objects and earn points. 
</P>
<P>
Not so strangely, the objects assembled in "Faces" are just that -- faces. 
Faces of modern world leaders -- Indira Gandhi, Margaret Thatcher, Mikhail 
Gorbachev. Faces of science -- Newton, Einstein, Galileo. Faces from history -- 
Sitting Bull, Frederick Douglass, George Washington Carver. Faces of fantasy -- 
Wolfman, Frankenstein, Dracula. And more. Lots more. 
</P>
<P>
Faces are built from the chin up. Chins, mouths, noses, eyes, foreheads. As you 
begin playing, pairs of small rectangles bearing brightly colored chins start 
gently drifting down from the sky. A pair of mouths follow. Great -- more than 
likely, they land on the chins. Now what? More chins. More chins? You don't 
need more chins. You want noses! 
</P>
<P>
You get the idea. The faces parts start falling faster than East European 
governments, and the unused features start piling up. 
</P>
<P>
Tension grows, and suddenly you are hooked. 
</P>
<P>
Difficulty levels are nicely graduated to allow for novice to advanced players. 
Beginning players, children and adults probably will be comfortable at the 
lower levels, while even teen-age Nintendo aces might enjoy the challenges of 
the higher playing levels.

EGYPTIAN MONKS FIND SERENITY IN MOJAVE DESERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES HILLINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
COYOTE DRY LAKE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six Egyptian monks of the Coptic Orthodox Church pray, work and meditate near 
the shores of this Mojave Desert dry lake 25 miles northeast of Barstow. 
</P>
<P>
"We are here in this remote place because it is far away from worldly 
distractions, in a location remarkably similar to the church's 10 monasteries 
in the deserts of Egypt," explained Father Benjamin, 38, one of the monks at 
St. Antony Monastery. 
</P>
<P>
A five-mile dirt road leads to the monastery named after the Coptic monk who 
spent 58 years living a solitary life in a desert cave in Egypt. St. Antony, 
who lived in the 3rd and 4th centuries, is considered by some to be 
Christendom's first monk. 
</P>
<P>
The Coptic Orthodox Church traces its origin to Mark, reputed to be the author 
of the second Gospel. Although Western biblical scholars say Mark's historical 
identity is uncertain, the Coptic church regards Pope Shenouda III, 67, as the 
church's 117th Pope since St. Mark. 
</P>
<P>
Atif Guirguis was the first monk in this seldom-visited spot. 
</P>
<P>
He had come to this country from Egypt to earn his master's degree in 
engineering at Caltech. After graduating, he worked as an engineer in Southern 
California until 1977. He then gave up the secular life and became a hermit, 
dedicating himself to God. He was ordained a Coptic Orthodox monk, took the 
name Brother Atif and built a shack where the monastery is now located. For 
three years he lived a solitary life like St. Antony, praying and meditating. 
</P>
<P>
Guirguis returned to Egypt, where he eventually became a bishop; he now manages 
the church's publishing house in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
The monastery lay unused from Brother Atif's departure until 1988, when the 
present chapel and monks' quarters were built. Last year the six monks came 
from Egypt and moved in. 
</P>
<P>
The only other Coptic monastery outside Egypt is in Germany. During Pope 
Shenouda's visit to California last November he dedicated St. Antony Monastery. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California has 10 Coptic churches with about 10,000 followers, the 
largest concentration of Coptics in this country other than New York City, 
according to Father Antonious Henein, 46, pastor of Los Angeles' Holy Virgin 
Mary Coptic Orthodox Church. 
</P>
<P>
The first Coptic church in Southern California, St. Mark in West Los Angeles, 
was consecrated in 1969. Most members of the Coptic churches in the United 
States are Egyptian immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
There are 8 million members of the Coptic Orthodox Church in Egypt, the largest 
Christian church in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Refaat Bakhoum, 55, a contractor from Rancho Palos Verdes, suggested that the 
church buy the land the monastery sits upon. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a friend who owned land really off the beaten path in the Barstow 
area," Bakhoum said. "To me it was a spiritual place like the monasteries in 
Egypt. I told the church about it. My friend sold the church 20 acres to be set 
aside for the first Coptic monastery in America." 
</P>
<P>
That was 15 years ago. Since then the Coptic church has acquired 140 acres of 
adjacent desert. 
</P>
<P>
"We are now busy planting trees around the border of our property. There is 
ample water here, and we will plant much of our land in vegetables, fruit and 
pistachio trees for our own use and to sell to the public to help support the 
monastery," Father Benjamin said. 
</P>
<P>
He said plans are for St. Antony Monastery eventually to house 100 to 150 
monks, "most coming from Egypt, but in time we expect Coptics living in America 
will choose the monastic life as well." There are 10,000 monks in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
Each monk has his own room, where he spends hours in prayer and meditation. "We 
pray for everyone, for peace in the world," said Brother Malak, 28. 
</P>
<P>
The Coptic church split from the Roman Catholic church in 451. In 1973, Pope 
Shenouda met with Pope Paul VI at the Vatican in the first meeting between 
leaders of the two churches since the 5th Century. The two Popes signed a 
declaration affirming that their faiths are essentially one. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we are halfway around the world from our homes in Egypt. Yet being in 
this out-of-the-way place in a desert so much like the Egyptian desert, we feel 
like we never left home," Brother Malak said. "It is God's will that we are 
here."

SANTA PAULA POLICE CLEARED IN DEATH AT JAIL

<P>
The Ventura County district attorney's office on Friday cleared the Santa Paula 
Police Department of any wrongdoing in the case of a man who died last month in 
the Santa Paula jail. 
</P>
<P>
District attorney's investigators concluded that Daniel Guajardo, 23, who was 
found dead about 10 hours after his arrest Sept. 3, died from ingesting lethal 
doses of cocaine and lidocaine, Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula police arrested Guajardo about 5 p.m. that day, after he had a 
heated argument with his wife. He was charged with possession of cocaine, being 
under the influence of cocaine and obstructing a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Guajardo's body was found between 3 and 3:15 a.m. the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ron O'Halloran, assistant Ventura County coroner, ruled that superficial 
cuts and scrapes found on Guajardo's body could have been caused by Guajardo 
resisting arrest, but none was life-threatening, according to the district 
attorney's report. 
</P>
<P>
High concentrations of pure cocaine that had been only slightly metabolized 
were found in Guajardo's blood, indicating that he ingested the drug shortly 
before he died, O'Halloran ruled. 
</P>
<P>
"Ingestion occurred after his arrest," the district attorney's report 
concluded. "Death could have occurred in one to two hours or sooner after 
assimilation. It is common knowledge and common experience among drug 
enforcement officers that a person possessing illegal drugs will often swallow 
them if faced with arrest. This is to either destroy evidence or recover and 
use the drugs while incarcerated." 
</P>
<P>
The report said police recovered small packets of cocaine and lidocaine from 
the police car used to take Guajardo to the police station. 
</P>
<P>
Guajardo's widow, Frances Marie, reacted bitterly to the district attorney's 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm mad," she said. "I'm really furious. How can they say there was nothing 
wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
Guajardo said her attorney, Douglas Stenzel, would continue his investigation 
of the case. "We've found a bunch of things that were wrong," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Guajardo's grandmother, Juanita Gaona, was also disappointed. "I'm not happy 
because I know the police beat him," she said in Spanish. "There was no reason 
for that. He wasn't fighting and he wasn't running away. Just because police 
have pistols, it doesn't mean they can do whatever they want." 
</P>
<P>
But Kossoris said Guajardo's family has not been willing to share another 
autopsy report prepared by Dr. Irving Root, who was hired to conduct a second 
autopsy Sept. 8 on Guajardo.

ELECTIONS THOUSAND OAKS CITY COUNCIL; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGNS DOMINATED BY ISSUES OF GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In an election focused on the issues of increased traffic, air pollution and 
crime, nine City Council candidates in Thousand Oaks say they are determined to 
keep the city from becoming another San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
All nine council candidates -- including incumbents Alex Fiore and Lawrence E. 
Horner -- cite some aspect of growth as the most important issue in the race 
for three open seats. 
</P>
<P>
While Fiore and Horner are emphasizing long records of service to the city, 
their seven challengers are hammering away at the theme that steady growth 
could destroy the small-town environment that drew many to Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Although both incumbents support growth-control measures, Fiore and Horner 
differ on how to manage construction over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
The 64-year-old Fiore is seeking his eighth council term after serving for more 
than 26 years. He takes credit for supporting municipal controls against 
development of sensitive ridgelines and against cutting down oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
Fiore said he believes there are enough growth controls in place with Measure 
A, an initiative passed in 1980 that limits new housing construction to 500 
residences a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got controlled growth," Fiore said. "I don't think traffic is that bad. 
We could always improve on it." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to broad growth questions, the campaign has focused on a proposal 
to build a government center and arts auditorium at the former Jungleland site 
in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
One of the major proponents of the Jungleland project, Fiore has drawn 
criticism from people who oppose the plan to build the $63-million civic 
center. 
</P>
<P>
He opposes placing a measure on the Jungleland issue on the ballot, putting him 
in opposition to Horner, who supports a citywide referendum on the project. 
</P>
<P>
A Northrop Corp. vice president, Horner, 60, is seeking his fifth term after 
more than 16 years on the council. 
</P>
<P>
He is pushing for more open space in the city. He also supports building more 
affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
During the 10 years since the growth-control measure went into effect, city 
planners have approved permits for an average of 594 residences a year, 
according to a city building official. 
</P>
<P>
The growth limits exclude affordable housing, and in some years when there were 
few applications for development, the City Council has allowed the unused 
housing quota to be saved for later allocation. 
</P>
<P>
Horner says that practice has created an imbalance in growth that alarms city 
residents. Population jumped after the passage of Measure A, from 77,000 in 
1980 to about 103,000 today, he said. He opposes carrying over unused housing 
quotas from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
"People, when they are concerned about growth, they don't care about 1998. They 
want to know the impact in 1991 or 1992," Horner said. 
</P>
<P>
After supporting the Jungleland civic center site for many years, Horner says 
he now opposes the project because it has become bigger than citizens 
originally envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the seats held by Fiore and Horner, a third council seat held by 
Tony Lamb is at stake. Lamb is not running for reelection. The remaining seven 
candidates also say that the questions of growth and the Jungleland project are 
important issues in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Financial consultant Ray Grams, 26, the youngest council candidate, called the 
Jungleland project "a big white elephant around the city's neck" and said the 
council should work to donate more acreage for open space. 
</P>
<P>
The city should also prepare for the development of Jordan and Ahmanson ranches 
by doing an environmental report on a possible annexation, a measure that the 
city of Simi Valley is now undertaking, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Halfhill, 52, an operations manager for a private investigations firm 
in Ventura and a Thousand Oaks resident for 22 years, said a jump in population 
has congested city streets and strained schools and water resources. 
</P>
<P>
Halfhill has emphasized stronger growth controls, but acknowledges that it's 
unrealistic to think that the city can survive with no growth at all. 
</P>
<P>
Halfhill also is critical of council members who are reluctant to put a ballot 
measure on Jungleland before voters. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Hughes, 52, a former radio station director, said he is committed to making 
sure that Jungleland is on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
He has begun helping citizens groups gather signatures to place the Jungleland 
project on the ballot for a third time. Hughes contends that the City Council 
has been unresponsive to residents who oppose the project. 
</P>
<P>
One of the strongest proponents of stricter traffic controls and of building a 
new civic center is Judy Lazar, 49, a planning commissioner for Thousand Oaks 
and former executive director of Conejo Valley Senior Concerns, an agency that 
provides services for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Lazar decided to run for a council seat after more than four years on the 
Thousand Oaks Planning Commission, two of them as chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
During that time, proposals have come before the Planning Commission on how to 
revitalize an ailing business district along Thousand Oaks Boulevard, among 
them the Jungleland project. 
</P>
<P>
Jungleland would "create a downtown core that's needed in a city of over 
100,000 people," Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
Lazar also supports stronger controls on growth, including an ordinance to 
protect more ridgelines and requirements that developers provide road 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Another proponent of the Jungleland project is Bob O'Brien, 60, a former city 
building director who worked for Thousand Oaks for 19 years before retiring in 
May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien said his experience in city government has made him conscious of 
preserving the small-town quality of Thousand Oaks. He has made preserving air 
quality and the development of parks the main issues in his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to protect the qualities in the valley that we moved here for," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Markey, 35, a Compton police detective who has raised the largest 
amount of money in the race, is financing most of his campaign himself. Markey 
is president of the Shadow Mountain Homeowners Assn. in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
Markey believes crime is one of the most important issues facing the city as 
population increases. He supports increased law enforcement and called for the 
creation of substations to take reports from citizens who live far away from 
the Sheriff's Department station on Olsen Road. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Sheriff's Department considers the crime rate in Thousand Oaks to 
be one of the lowest in the western United States among cities with a 
population of 100,000 or more, Markey said citizens face growing gang violence 
and drug trafficking as more residences are built. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking at it from the perspective of growth in the next five to 10 
years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Elois Zeanah, 48, is making her third bid for the City Council after running in 
1988 and 1989. A former campaign manager for supervisor-elect Maria VanderKolk, 
Zeanah describes herself as a community activist who has focused on the effect 
of growth on the Thousand Oaks environment. 
</P>
<P>
She has opposed the Jungleland project, saying it is an example of poor 
municipal planning. 
</P>
<P>
"Traffic and air pollution have worsened," Zeanah said. "We can't let Thousand 
Oaks become another San Fernando Valley."

SUPERVISORS ASKED TO BACK LIQUOR SURTAX; 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSITION 134: A BOARD MEMBER TELLS HER COLLEAGUES THAT UNDER-FUNDED PROGRAMS 
NEED THE MONEY. BUT FOUR VINTNERS SAY THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE LEVY. 
</P>

<P>
County Supervisor Maggie Erickson wants fellow supervisors to take what she 
calls a rare action -- a stand in favor of a ballot proposition to further tax 
alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson has asked that the supervisors pass a resolution Tuesday urging 
support of Proposition 134, which goes to the voters in the Nov. 6 general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would establish a surtax on beer, wine and liquor, equivalent to "a 
nickel a drink," according to promoters. The additional revenue from the new 
tax would fund alcohol and drug abuse programs, along with health, mental 
health and law enforcement efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The ballot proposition has drawn strong opposition from the alcoholic beverage 
industry in California, including several small wineries that operate in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson said the measure, if approved, would generate $730 million statewide 
within the first year. Of that, $11.2 million would come to Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson supports the measure partly because hefty state funding cuts have 
stripped the county of needed funds to support local programs and services. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the money Proposition 134 would bring to the county's under-funded 
programs, "I believe it is appropriate for the Board of Supervisors to adopt a 
position on this measure, an action we only rarely take," she said in a letter 
seeking the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would increase the existing tax on beer from 4 cents to 57 cents 
per gallon, on most wines from 1 cent to $1.29 per gallon and on liquor from $2 
to $8.40 per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
The revenue would go into an alcohol surtax fund that allots 24% for alcohol 
and drug abuse treatment and prevention, 15% to assist victims of alcohol 
abuse, 15% for mental health programs, 21% for law enforcement and 25% for 
medical services. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, federal administration and congressional proposals, still changing 
as legislators work out a federal budget package, call for up to another $1.27 
per gallon in federal liquor tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
The wine industry projects that surtaxes at the production level will translate 
into a $2-per-bottle increase at the retail level, causing sales to drop by 
15%, said Jerry Vorpal, vice president of the Wine Institute, a San 
Francisco-based wine industry association. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of four of Ventura County's five small wineries, which produce about 
20,000 cases of wine per year, told The Times this week that they cannot afford 
to pay the increased taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The wineries now sell their wine at $6 to $15 a bottle. If prices are increased 
$2, they argue that they would be forced into a higher price bracket in 
competition with the better-known wineries of Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
"If both of those taxes pass, we're pretty well through," said Charles Branham, 
part-owner of the Old Creek Ranch Winery in Oak View and a biology teacher at 
Ventura's Buena High School. "It just really does a number on us." 
</P>
<P>
With area winemakers already operating on narrow profit margins, the higher 
cost of production combined with lower sales could wipe out the county's wine 
industry, said John Daume, owner of the Daume Winery in the Las Posas 
industrial area of Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
"You know how I deal with that?" asked Daume, who boasts of "winemaking in the 
French tradition" to produce 2,500 cases a year at his winery. "I take the key 
to my winery and put it in an envelope and say, 'Come and get it; it's yours.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
The county's largest winery, the Leeward Winery in Ventura, generates enough 
sales at 13,500 cases per year to absorb the higher taxes and lower revenues, 
said winemaker Brooks Painter. But money will be tight. 
</P>
<P>
"The wine industry is not a big money-making industry," he said. "If we could 
have raised our prices before now and maintained sales, we would have." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Pagor, owner of the Rolling Hills Winery that produces about 2,000 cases per 
year in a Camarillo industrial area, complained that Ventura County winemakers 
would lose sales to lower-priced imports from Chile or Argentina, which now are 
$6 to $9 per bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Adam Tolmac, who owns Ojai Vineyards, regarded as the smallest of the county's 
wineries, could not be reached for comment 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the proposed tax increase include the Ventura County and state 
chapters of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the California Council on Alcohol 
Problems and the California Assn. of Highway Patrolmen. 
</P>
<P>
They argue that the majority of Californians who drink infrequently or 
moderately will pay no more than an extra 35 cents a week if the state tax 
passes. And the money is vitally needed for alcohol abuse and other programs, 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 134 proponents say it is precisely the small wineries, such as 
those in Ventura County, that will be least affected by the tax hike. 
</P>
<P>
"Our tax is a nickel a drink, which adds up to about 27 cents per bottle," said 
Kermit Newman, deputy campaign director for Yes On 134. "If you're a small 
winery putting out a nice bottle of wine for $9, people are not going to stop 
buying it if it costs $9.27. 
</P>
<P>
"Wine industry studies show that the big low-end producers such as Gallo are 
going to be the hardest hit. If you put out a $2 wine, the tax is going to be 
over 10%. If your bottle costs $10, the tax is going to be about 2.5%," Newman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Newman said, about three-fourths of the wine produced in California 
is exported out of state and wine exports are not subject to taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"Alcohol causes a tremendous damage to our communities and it's about time that 
the people who use alcohol pay for the consequences," Newman said. 
</P>

2 NEW SUPERINTENDENTS READY TO TACKLE TOUGH PROBLEMS; 
</P>
<P>
OXNARD: IAN C. KIRKPATRICK HAS INHERITED AN ENROLLMENT GROWTH TWICE AS HIGH AS 
WAS PROJECTED AND A DISPUTE OVER THE SITE OF A NEW HIGH SCHOOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Escalating growth in the Oxnard Union High School District, where the number of 
new students this year is double what officials had projected, is the biggest 
issue facing the six-school district, the new superintendent said after his 
first full week in the top post. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, we're up 400 students over last year," Ian C. Kirkpatrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials had projected that the number of students would increase by only 200 
this year. Enrollment in the 11,200-student district is expected to double by 
the year 2006. 
</P>
<P>
The soft-spoken Kirkpatrick, formerly head of the Oakdale Joint Union High 
School District in Oakdale, near Modesto, said he is visiting Oxnard's schools, 
introducing himself to teachers, staff members and students and becoming 
familiar with district issues. 
</P>
<P>
The two high schools in the Oakdale district had an enrollment of about 2,500, 
and although one school was about 55% Latino and the other about 25% Latino, 
they were much less ethnically diverse than the Oxnard district, Kirkpatrick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In his new $87,000-a-year job, Kirkpatrick, 48, will make decisions affecting 
schools in Oxnard and Camarillo that, on average, are about 65% Latino. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to have such a rich mix," said Kirkpatrick, citing slightly higher 
percentages of Asians, blacks and other minorities in the Oxnard schools 
compared with his former district. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkpatrick encountered an early controversy at his first district school board 
meeting in September when the board discussed a policy that would have allowed 
strip-searches of students. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we realized our mistake, we did pull back on it," Kirkpatrick said. 
"That really wasn't what we meant at all." 
</P>
<P>
A revised version of the policy, part of a larger locker-search policy, will be 
presented to the board later, he said. "At this point we have no reference in 
the policy to strip-searches, nor will we," Kirkpatrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Another continuing controversy that Kirkpatrick inherited involves an 80-acre 
site that was to be donated for a new Oxnard High School. The Oxnard City 
Council did not approve the developer's plans, which included a residential 
development. 
</P>
<P>
District officials are seeking another site for the school, estimated to cost 
about $21 million. It will replace and relocate the current school, which is 
near the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a need for some expediency," Kirkpatrick said. "The state will not 
hold on to funding for this site forever." 
</P>
<P>
The superintendent was described by Oakdale school board members and teachers' 
union leaders as a hard-working educator whose dedication during his 15-year 
career there carried him from teacher to principal, to associate superintendent 
and finally superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
"He's even-tempered, and that's important in that particular position, because 
often he's the man in the middle, between the community and the staff," Oakdale 
board President Sam Bates said. 
</P>
<P>
"I sure hate to lose him," Bates said. "I think he was just ready to move." 
</P>
<P>
Oakdale High School teacher Carl Vargas, who became president of the teachers' 
association this year, said Oakdale's teachers enjoyed a relatively smooth 
relationship with the administration during Kirkpatrick's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkpatrick has a bachelor's degree from Cal State Sacramento, a master's 
degree from Cal State Stanislaus and a doctorate from the University of La 
Verne, in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
A former track coach, Kirkpatrick competes about twice a year in biathlons that 
combine running and bicycling. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Diane, a consultant for the Stanislaus County Department of Education 
who works with students on the verge of dropping out, hopes to find a similar 
position in Ventura County, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkpatrick, who followed in his mother's footsteps in becoming a teacher, said 
he hopes to make a difference to students. 
</P>
<P>
"If school doesn't touch a kid, there are not a lot of things that are going 
to, and the things that do are not all good," Kirkpatrick said. "I think it's 
real important for us to make an impact."

A 30-year-old man was arrested in Simi Valley after sheriff's deputies stopped 
him for speeding and discovered about $100,000 worth of cocaine in the trunk of 
his vehicle, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Eugenio Jimenez Arreola of Pacoima was being held in the Ventura County Jail in 
lieu of $100,000 bail on suspicion of possession of cocaine for sale and 
transportation of cocaine for sale, said Sgt. Arnie Aviles of the Ventura 
County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies stopped Arreola for speeding as he traveled east on the Simi Valley 
Freeway near Sycamore Drive at 6:45 p.m. Thursday, Aviles said. 
</P>
<P>
A search revealed a kilogram of cocaine hidden in the wall panels of the trunk, 
he said. GERRY BRAILO SPENCER

<P>
NOT-GUILTY PLEA ENTERED IN SLAYING

<P>
A 27-year-old Oxnard tile-setter pleaded not guilty Friday to murder and 
robbery charges in the July 3 beating and strangulation of a 62-year-old Port 
Hueneme man. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Eugene Diaz entered the plea in Ventura County Municipal Court two days 
after police arrested him in the slaying of Bruce Eugene Pope, a self-employed 
free-lance business consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Pope was taking care of two condominiums in a guarded complex in the 300 block 
of Lighthouse Way in Port Hueneme where the robbery occurred, police said. A 
renter who lived with Pope returned home to find the condo ransacked and called 
security guards, who later summoned police. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Pope had been severely beaten with household objects and then 
strangled. Missing items included a television, videocassette recorder, 
computer, camera and cash. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe that Diaz and Pope met by chance and that Diaz apparently 
decided to rob Pope after he had been invited to the condominium. 
</P>
<P>
Police received a tip in August that helped them identify Diaz and link him to 
evidence at the scene, but Deputy Dist. Atty. James Ellison would not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz was held until Friday in lieu of $517,000 bail. Judge Steven E. Hintz, 
however, ordered Diaz held without bail because the district attorney's office 
had accused him of the special circumstance of murder during a robbery, a 
potential death-penalty charge that allows no bail. 
</P>
<P>
Ellison said his office will decide after the preliminary hearing, scheduled 
for Nov. 5, whether to seek the death penalty in Diaz's case. MACK REED

COUNCIL APPROVES CHILD-CARE CENTER 
</P>

<P>
Plans for the construction of a child-care center at the Oxnard Financial Plaza 
were approved by the Oxnard City Council this week although the city Planning 
Commission rejected the proposal last month. 
</P>
<P>
The center will be built next to the Financial Plaza Hilton on Esplanade Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The facility's 11,370-square-foot building and 20,800-square-foot playground 
area will accommodate up to 208 children. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission voted 4 to 2 against the plans because the site is next 
to the Ventura Freeway and subject to its pollution and noise. 
</P>
<P>
Members questioned how easily emergency vehicles could reach the building, 
which would be in the corner of the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ann Johs, who appealed the commission's ruling before the City 
Council, said children would not be on the playground during rush hours 
breathing the worst of the exhaust. She also pointed out that the section of 
the freeway running by the building is raised, so much of the smog would pass 
overhead. 
</P>
<P>
Johs dismissed doubts about emergency vehicle access. "The Fire Department 
hasn't raised that concern," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The center will be owned by Martin V. Smith Inc., which built the Financial 
Plaza complex and has its offices there. 
</P>
<P>
It is expected to open by the end of next summer, said a company spokesman. 
Parents may use the child-care center even if they don't work in the office 
complex. KIM KASH

NEGOTIATIONS BEGIN ON SCHOOL CONTRACT

<P>
Contract negotiations between officials and teachers in the Pleasant Valley 
School District have begun, with both sides scheduled to meet today to discuss 
salary and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers are asking for parity in pay with the rest of the county's school 
districts and for the district to pay more toward health benefits, said Ina Lea 
Parker, president of the 300-member Pleasant Valley Educators Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The Camarillo district has about 6,400 students. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the fourth-lowest-paid district in the county, and the district pays 
only $3,900 toward our benefits, which is second-lowest in the county," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides salary and benefits, each side will bring up an additional issue. The 
teachers are asking for more time for class preparation, and the district wants 
to clarify the policy on teachers and other certificated personnel transferring 
within the district. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers, in the final year of a three-year contract, have picketed the 
past three meetings of the board of education. 
</P>
<P>
The next scheduled negotiating session is Nov. 17 and 18. KAREN MCKEAN

CANYON CLEANERS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: TWO CARS, ABOUT 1,200 TIRES, 3,500 POUNDS OF SCRAP METAL, CHAIRS, 
WASHERS AND DRYERS ARE AMONG THE ITEMS REMOVED IN TUJUNGA.

Tires -- hundreds of tires -- appliances by the dozen and a new car with only 
its stereo missing were among a "shocking" collection of illegally dumped items 
pulled this week from two steep ravines in La Tuna Canyon in Tujunga. 
</P>
<P>
By Thursday afternoon, sweating, dirty volunteer workers and minimum-wage Los 
Angeles Conservation Corps employees had dredged out what cleanup organizers 
said was one of the worst collections of dumped debris they have ever seen in a 
San Fernando Valley canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been really shocking to us all," said Scott Mathes, director of the 
California Environmental Project, the nonprofit group that organized the 
cleanup with other agencies. "From the amount of debris, we think this is the 
first time this part of the canyon has been cleaned." 
</P>
<P>
Although illegal dumping has long plagued scenic and remote canyons throughout 
the Valley, park rangers and others suspect that skyrocketing prices at 
space-crunched landfills in the region have led to an increase in clandestine 
dumping. 
</P>
<P>
Northern La Tuna Canyon, the site of the four-day cleanup, is especially 
vulnerable to dumping because of its proximity to the freeway and its desolate 
location far from the vigilant eyes of rangers and homeowners, said Gary Moser, 
chief park ranger for the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, a state agency 
that buys and maintains parkland. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really sickening to see what has been dumped in that area," Moser said. 
"There are truckloads of entire house renovations -- the kitchen sink, the 
tiles, the ceiling." 
</P>
<P>
Most jolting to the cleanup crews working in a human chain was that they pulled 
out about 1,200 tires, stacking the putrid-smelling rubber by the roadside in a 
four-foot-high pile for 20 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"It really gets me mad to see this," said Gustavo Guzman, 19, one of the paid 
workers. "Before, I never even cared about the environment. But when I'm down 
there with all those sharp metals, heavy tires, car parts, I wonder how people 
can do this. They don't realize the damage." 
</P>
<P>
The crews hauled away several large, wooden stereo consoles, couches, chairs, 
washers and dryers. They collected 1,100 pounds of glass, 3,500 pounds of scrap 
metal and two trailers full of wood and concrete, all of it hauled to recycling 
centers. About 30 gallons of oil in tin cans and glass bottles were carefully 
removed. Workers called police to haul off two cars, including a new 1989 black 
Mazda with only the stereo missing. Both vehicles had been reported stolen. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty scary down there," said worker Lorena Chavez, 22. 
</P>
<P>
Mathes' volunteer group and the Conservation Corps crews, which are funded by 
state and local government grants to clean up public lands, targeted a stretch 
of conservancy-owned parkland in the canyon where about four feet of debris had 
choked chaparral and scraped away tree bark. 
</P>
<P>
In their zeal to remove trash, they inadvertently cleaned an adjacent parcel of 
privately owned property. Mathes said they will attempt to contact the owner to 
ask for contributions to the cleanup effort. 
</P>
<P>
Rangers and environmentalists said the debris buildup in La Tuna Canyon was 
especially troublesome because water from nearby creek beds eventually drains 
into the Los Angeles River, carrying with it residue from hazardous materials 
such as oil and paint. The polluted water ultimately flows into the Santa 
Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Also, wildlife food chains are poisoned when materials seep into the ground and 
splash on shrubbery. Animals are commonly cut or injured in the trash. Plant 
life is smothered by the trash. In rainy seasons, flooding is common in La Tuna 
Canyon because culverts are clogged, Moser said. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups said they are bolstering their efforts to track down 
illegal dumpers by sifting through garbage in search of mail or other 
identification papers. Moser said he often tracks down dumpers and can usually 
persuade them to donate funds to future cleanups. 
</P>
<P>
Punishment for dumping can range from a $100 citation to a $100,000 fine and 
prison time if hazardous materials are involved. But catching offenders is 
difficult because police or rangers must actually see the dumping take place. 
</P>
<P>
Mathes and rangers said they will petition the city of Los Angeles to install 
higher road barriers to make it more difficult to unload a truck of garbage.

RUMORS OF PEACE SEND OIL PRICES INTO TAILSPIN; 
</P>
<P>
ENERGY: ANALYSTS CITE COMMENTS BY AN IRAQI OFFICIAL FOR A $3-PER-BARREL PLUNGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rumors of peace shocked the oil markets Friday, as prices plunged $3 a barrel 
amid reports that Iraq sought a diplomatic solution to the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices "dropped like a stone," observed Norman E. Mains, chief economist at 
the Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards investment firm in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The fall was good news to investors, who have had plenty of bad news about oil 
in recent weeks. The Dow Jones industrial index jumped 68.07 points to close at 
2,520.79, following a gain Thursday of 64.85. Bonds also rallied, capping a 
week in which crude oil fell $5.90 a barrel on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"It's conceivable that reality is creeping back into the people that are buying 
and selling oil," said Kenneth W. Haley, manager of energy forecasting for 
Chevron Corp. in San Francisco. "But, as sure as I say that, maybe prices will 
go up tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
The falloff in energy prices Friday was propelled by comments from Iraqi First 
Deputy Prime Minister Taha Yassin Ramadan in Amman, Jordan. "There is serious 
thinking to find a peaceful outlet to the crisis, be it on the Arab or European 
arenas," the official reportedly said. 
</P>
<P>
As word spread through computerized news services and into trading rooms, 
speculators began unloading oil contracts. The selloff began in Asia and then 
shifted to Europe and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude -- a widely 
quoted barometer of oil prices -- closed at $33.79 a barrel, $3.01 below 
Thursday's close. That is the price for futures contracts -- oil promised for 
November delivery. Since Oct. 11, crude has fallen $6.63 a barrel from its 
record peak closing price of $40.42. 
</P>
<P>
Although economists teach that prices have a rational basis in supply and 
demand, the explosive leaps and declines in oil since August are also explained 
in terms of fear and emotion, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
"When Saddam Hussein says something aggressive, they go up. When he says 
something less aggressive, they drop," Mains said. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil was not the only energy-related product to drop Friday. The wholesale 
price of heating oil for November delivery also fell sharply, declining 8.11 
cents to 88.4 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of a serious oil shortage was underscored earlier this week, when the 
U.S. Department of Energy announced that other countries were largely making up 
the loss of oil from Iraq and Kuwait. The loss -- 4.3 million barrels of daily 
output -- will largely be offset by the end of the year with extra oil produced 
in Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Libya, Iran, Venezuela and other countries, according 
to U.S. energy officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, there is enough crude oil to keep the world in balance -- so long as 
nothing else bad happens," said Chevron's Haley. 
</P>
<P>
The world consumes about 66 million barrels of oil a day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Within the energy industry -- ranging from small independent operators to giant 
corporations -- many watch the continued gyrations of oil prices with a sense 
of bewilderment. 
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday and this morning some positive things were said -- and the price of 
oil dropped four bucks in two days," said Doug Eberts, managing partner of 
Driltek, an oil-drilling management firm in Bakersfield. "That's how volatile 
it is." 
</P>
<P>
Doug Elmets, an Arco spokesman in Los Angeles, agreed that oil prices have 
become heavily influenced by news reports and rumors. "Today, there may be a 
sense in the marketplace that there might be a diplomatic solution. But, on 
Monday morning, there may be a rumor that Saddam Hussein has decided to invade 
Saudi Arabia." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Friday's respite from fear about oil shortages heartened the bond 
market and helped trim interest rates. Prices of long-term U.S. Treasury bonds 
-- which move in the opposite direction from interest rates -- rose more than 
$5 for each $1,000 in face value.

KEATING GOT STAR TREATMENT DURING STAY IN COUNTY JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Charles H. Keating Jr. stepped to freedom through the doors of Los Angeles 
County Jail Thursday night, he told reporters, "Everyone in there was just 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. During his monthlong imprisonment, the Phoenix businessman known for 
his lavish lifestyle was afforded a level of personal service and liberal 
treatment not given most other inmates, jail officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
He was allowed four hours a day of exercise and leisure time -- much of which 
he spent on the phone -- compared to two hours a week usually given most 
prisoners. Keating's food was served in plates and bowls, compared to 
TV-dinner-like trays for others. And he ate ample portions of the servings. 
</P>
<P>
At his disposal during leisure time were a color television, pay telephone, 
exercise bike, shower, books and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
"Some inmates refer to it as the 'country club,' " Commander Robert Pash, a 
county jail spokesman, said of the wing where Keating stayed. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities described Keating as a cooperative prisoner who created no 
controversy inside the jail since entering it on Sept. 18 after being indicted 
on 42 counts of securities fraud in connection with Phoenix-based American 
Continental Corp. and its failed former unit, Irvine-based Lincoln Savings 
&amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
The 66-year-old former American Continental chairman, released Thursday night 
after a federal judge lowered his bail to $300,000 from $5 million, followed 
rules and got along with guards and inmates -- spending 33 quiet days in a 
highly isolated but relatively freer prison environment, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was in high spirits considering the situation," said Dan Ordway, a deputy 
sheriff at the jail. "He was courteous and he smiled occasionally." 
</P>
<P>
Ordway said the inmate population was aware of Keating's presence, but he "did 
not create a stir" compared to Christian Brando -- son of actor Marlon Brando 
-- who earlier had been housed in the same special wing as Keating. 
</P>
<P>
Jail officials say Keating -- who refused requests for an interview -- was 
treated like about 60 other prisoners detained in a separate security section 
called the "7000 wing." Actor Todd Bridges was detained there, as was Brando. 
</P>
<P>
The wing is set aside for high-profile prisoners or others who might need 
protection from fellow inmates, Pash said. There were three others in Keating's 
block -- all in one-person cells divided by a 7-by-40-foot leisure area known 
as the freeway, which contained the TV, phone and other amenities. Only one of 
the four inmates had access to the freeway at a time. 
</P>
<P>
"He was kept in a high-security area for high-risk people because of his 
notoriety," Pash said. "There is some freedom . . . but the area is needed 
because (otherwise) every time we move him outside the cell, he would have to 
be escorted by a guard. This minimizes the need for security escort. We make up 
for the restrictions on movement by letting them out into the freeway for 
longer periods." 
</P>
<P>
"They're housed this way for a reason and for our convenience," Pash said. 
</P>
<P>
For Keating -- accustomed to corporate jets, mansion living and top-notch 
service -- the setting and experience was still a radical change. However, he 
was given personal service because he -- like other high-profile prisoners -- 
was not allowed to make trips to the facility's cafeteria or the jail store. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, food was brought to Keating's cell at 6 a.m., 12:30 p.m. and 5 p.m. 
daily. The main dinner courses included dishes such as spaghetti, turkey a la 
king, ham and chili. Salad, bread and dessert -- pastry, cookies or ice cream, 
for example -- were part of dinner. 
</P>
<P>
The same fare was served to the general jail population, but those inmates -- 
about 6,500 people -- eat from trays, a faster way to serve a large group. 
Metal bowls, metal cups and paper plates were used in Keating's block. 
</P>
<P>
"He ate well," Pash said. 
</P>
<P>
Items from the jail store -- newspapers, candy, tobacco products and shaving 
items -- were wheeled to Keating's cell twice a week. Guards said Keating 
bought shaving items and newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
As are other high-profile prisoners, Keating was allowed visitors daily between 
noon and 7 p.m. While inmates in the general population are restricted to about 
20 minutes of visitation per day, the segregated group in the 7000 wing could 
get up to 90 minutes per visitor -- for up to five hours per day -- because 
they are fewer in number. Keating saw visitors daily, mainly family members, 
guards said. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is nothing posh about the setting in the 7000 wing. Keating's 
6-by-10-foot cell -- painted white -- contained a bunk with a mattress and 
blanket, toilet and sink. Prisoners in the general population are locked behind 
jail doors made of bars. Cells in the 7000 wing contain metal doors with a 
window and slots for food delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the isolation and greater sound-resistant doors, Keating occasionally 
chatted with others in his cell block, guards said. 
</P>
<P>
However, guards said, Keating did most of his talking on the telephone -- 
mainly to his lawyers -- during his daily four-hour leisure period. 
</P>
<P>
Although Keating indicated that he was treated well, there were some hitches. 
When he arrived, he traded in his business suit and tie for prison blues. His 
business attire, like all inmate clothing, was to be dry cleaned and made 
available upon his release. 
</P>
<P>
But a deputy said Keating's clothing could not be found when a bond agent 
secured his release Thursday. Freedom was delayed while family members arranged 
to acquire other clothing, the deputy said.

INVESTIGATION THWARTS HIGHER PIPELINE OUTPUT; 
</P>
<P>
ENERGY: ALASKA AND U.S. OFFICIALS ARE LOOKING INTO ALLEGATIONS THAT WORKERS 
FALSIFIED INSPECTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Plans to move more oil out of Alaska to offset supplies lost due to the Persian 
Gulf crisis are being complicated by state and federal investigations into 
charges that workers on the 800-mile Trans-Alaska Pipeline falsified 
inspections of corrosion problems. 
</P>
<P>
The investigations center on allegations made by a former employee of a 
pipeline subcontractor that workers ignored potential cracks and corrosion, 
were poorly trained and used drugs and alcohol on the job. 
</P>
<P>
While the investigations are under way, Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. said it 
has been denied permission by the federal Department of Transportation to boost 
the pressure of oil flowing through a key section of the pipeline for fear of a 
break. 
</P>
<P>
Though neither Alyeska officials nor spokesmen for oil companies expect any 
disruptions in oil flow as a result, state officials say such restrictions 
could hamper plans to ship more oil through the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
"We're about as high as we're willing to go right now until we know how 
significant the problems are," said Rod Swope, commissioner for the state 
Department of Natural Resources, which is responsible for pipeline safety and 
operations on state lands. 
</P>
<P>
As early as next week, Alyeska plans to unearth and reinspect two buried 
sections whose inspections were challenged by Edward W. Thompson, a former 
inspector for subcontractor Thorpe Technical Services of Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, federal and state investigators on Friday interviewed Thompson, who 
worked for Thorpe from March until July, when he was fired for allegedly 
driving company vehicles for personal use. Officials would not comment Friday 
on their findings. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Thorpe, president of the subcontractor, has denied Thompson's charges, 
calling them "vicious." Alyeska has said it will cooperate fully with the 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
The inquiries are the latest in a series of problems surrounding Alyeska, a 
consortium of seven oil companies, led by BP America Inc. and Los-Angeles-based 
Atlantic Richfield Co., that operates the pipeline. The 13-year-old conduit 
moves about a quarter of the oil produced in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Alyeska already is dealing with corrosion problems on the pipeline, as well as 
charges of air pollution and fallout from the company's botched initial 
response to the oil spill from the Exxon Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
More oil has been pumped through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline since the Aug. 2 
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Marnie Isaacs, an Alyeska spokeswoman in Anchorage, estimated that the 
"throughput," or amount of oil flowing through the pipeline, is now about 1.95 
million barrels a day, compared to between 1.6 million and 1.8 million barrels 
a day before the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
With new gas handling plants and well stimulation, producers have said they 
could increase production to as much as 2 million barrels a day. The pipeline 
has a maximum capacity of about 2.1 million barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the investigation is being undertaken by the federal Bureau of 
Land Management and the Department of Transportation, as well as the Alaska 
state Department of Natural Resources and other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter dated Oct. 3, Thompson claimed that he and other workers were not 
trained for some of the work Thorpe asked them to perform, including a type of 
magnetic inspection designed to verify corrosion. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Thompson said, the inspections "were fraudulent." While working on 
two separate sections of pipe, Thompson said he thought he saw cracks or 
corrosion, but was told in each instance by a supervisor to ignore them. 
</P>
<P>
It is those two sections, each about 80 to 100 feet long, that Alyeska will dig 
up next week to see if Thompson is telling the truth, Isaacs said. An 
independent contractor, not Thorpe, will be hired to reinspect the pipeline.

If true, Thompson's allegations could bring into question the integrity of 
large sections of the pipeline that carry hot oil through virgin territory. 
</P>
<P>
But it is unlikely that the pipeline would need to be shut down, officials 
said.

Judge Lets P.I.E. Use Cash: A federal bankruptcy judge in Jacksonville, Fla., 
said Olympia Holdings Inc. could use $24.4 million in cash from accounts 
receivable to fund its P.I.E. International trucking unit. The cash infusion 
won't prevent cutbacks at the unit, which plans to lay off 20% of its 7,500 
workers and close 22% of its 230 terminals as a result of parent Olympia's 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. P.I.E. also plans a 30% reduction in annual sales 
to $350 million. P.I.E.'s sister company, Los Angeles-based Transcon Lines, is 
in Chapter 7 liquidation.

Bank Sues Former Columbia S&amp;L Chief: Bankers Trust alleged in a suit filed 
in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles that Thomas Spiegel failed to make a 
$1.2-million payment on a line of credit. 
</P>
<P>
Also named as defendants in the suit are Spiegel's wife, Helene, and his 
father, Abraham, who is acting trustee of the Thomas Spiegel 1982 Trust. The 
suit seeks to recover $1.2 million plus interest from Thomas Spiegel and $1.8 
million allegedly overdue from the trust. Regulators have previously charged 
Spiegel with squandering the thrift's assets. A lawyer for Spiegel said he had 
not yet seen the Bankers Trust lawsuit.

Midway Airlines Sells gates and routes: The carrier sold the Philadelphia gates 
and routes it acquired from Eastern Airlines for $100 million last year to 
USAir for $64.5 million. Midway, a money-losing airline based in Chicago, said 
the sale would result in a $32-million charge in the fourth quarter. The sale, 
if approved by the Departments of Justice and Transportation, would bolster 
USAir as the largest carrier in Philadelphia.

INDUSTRY STATIC KILLS CABLE BILL A 2ND TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Last-minute phone calls by White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu and 
pressure by small cable companies have dashed hopes of reviving a legislative 
proposal to re-regulate cable television, one of the bill's sponsors said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Once again, the public has been 'Sununu-ed,' " said Sen. Albert Gore Jr. 
(D-Tenn.). "I used that word because I know for a fact that John Sununu made 
personal calls to Republican senators urging that holds be put on this 
legislation." 
</P>
<P>
The White House refused to comment, but the Bush Administration already was on 
record threatening to veto the bill if it were passed by both houses of 
Congress. The Administration opposed the bill in large part because it involves 
regulatory restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
The basic problem the bill sought to address, according to supporters, is that 
cable rates have risen dramatically while service has deteriorated ever since 
the cable industry was deregulated in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The last-minute maneuvering involved a Senate bill that would have allowed the 
Federal Communications Commission to set rates for over-the-air broadcast 
stations that are carried on cable, a concern of rural Americans who cannot 
easily get broadcast reception without cable. The bill also would have 
empowered the FCC to review and roll back rates, if deemed excessive, for 
premium cable channels such as HBO, ESPN or CNN. 
</P>
<P>
A similar bill already has passed the House. 
</P>
<P>
But the authors of the Senate measure said that several Republican senators 
were refusing to let the bill come up for a vote after being pressured by the 
White House and by some small cable operators. 
</P>
<P>
The bill appeared to have died two weeks ago, when Sen. Tim Wirth (D-Colo.) 
blocked it from coming to a vote. But Gore and Wirth worked out a compromise 
amendment last week that gave the bill another shot at floor consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides agree that the development of competing technology eventually will 
be the best way to ensure quality service and low pricing. But supporters of 
re-regulation contend that rival technologies are still years away and that 
some regulatory protection is necessary in the interim.

DENNY'S DECIDES TO LEAVE IRVINE FOR SOUTH CAROLINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move that has stunned its 500-member work force, Denny's Inc. has decided 
to close its corporate headquarters in Irvine and consolidate operations into 
its parent company in Spartanburg, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
The relocation will mean the elimination of about 400 jobs in Southern 
California. Many Denny's workers will face a difficult dilemma: deciding 
whether to move nearly 3,000 miles to begin a new life or face finding a new 
job in a slumping economy. 
</P>
<P>
Denny's, the nation's largest coffee shop chain, said it will retain about 100 
employees in Southern California. An undisclosed number of workers will be laid 
off and the rest asked to relocate to Spartanburg, a city proud of its rural 
character and sausage biscuits. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement surprised Denny's employees, particularly since it comes soon 
after the company moved its headquarters from La Mirada to the mirrored, 
sprawling Park Place office complex next to the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"It's up in the air for me," said one worker, who would not give his name. For 
many of his co-workers, he said the prospect of moving to the South is "a 
painful thought. A lot of them aren't going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
But he added, others are enticed by the prospect of lower housing costs. "You 
can buy a mansion for the price of a shack" in Orange County, he said. 
</P>
<P>
TW Services Inc., the Spartanburg-based parent of Denny's, announced the move 
Thursday as part of an effort to centralize its five food-service operations. 
While no timetable was announced, the consolidation is expected to take two to 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
The company also announced a shake-up of management. Sam Maw, the longtime TW 
executive who has served a president of the 1,300-restaurants Denny's chain for 
three years, will take a new position as senior vice president of product 
development for the firm. 
</P>
<P>
He will be replaced by Bernard Scott, a vice president of operations for 
Denny's on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Shively, vice president in charge of human resources, said about 20% of 
Denny's corporate employees will be retained in Irvine to manage the El Pollo 
Loco chain of Mexican-style charbroiled chicken restaurants and the West Coast 
operations of Denny's. 
</P>
<P>
For those who are laid off, he said the company will be providing severance pay 
based on length of service, bonus pay to stay during the transition and help 
with placement in new jobs at other companies. He said that more clerical 
workers than middle- and low-level managers are being laid off.

FOR KRETZSCHMAR, SERRA FOOTBALL IS MORE THAN GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angie was a name spoken hundreds of times in Gardena on Friday night as Serra 
High celebrated its 40th homecoming with a Camino Real League football game 
against St. Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Angela Maria Kretzschmar, a fixture at the all-boys Catholic school for 39 
years, is "our biggest fan" according to Athletic Director Michael Falco. A 
short and motherly figure, Angie watches the games from a lawn chair at the 
30-yard line, where she is often dwarfed by huge red, white and blue-uniformed 
players. 
</P>
<P>
At 75, she has slowed a bit in the past few years, attending fewer events, but 
she is a regular figure at most of the school's varsity athletic contests, 
especially the football games. 
</P>
<P>
"These are my boys," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A resident of Hawthorne, Angie has been on a first-name basis with most 
everyone associated with Serra since 1951, when the first of her three sons 
attended the high school. 
</P>
<P>
"No one remembers Kretzschmar," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She greets spectators as they enter the stadium prior to home games. When 
former students and players pass through the gates, they get a big hug. 
</P>
<P>
"What are you up to these days?" she will ask. "Are you taking care of yourself 
dear?" 
</P>
<P>
Angie will accept nothing but a straight answer. 
</P>
<P>
"Young people are looking for somebody to give a darn," she said. "There just 
isn't enough of that going on today." 
</P>
<P>
Angie gives a darn, and a lot more. Each year she contributes $2,000 toward 
athletic equipment and scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
But she is best known for her patronage on the sidelines, where she mingles 
with players and offers encouragement. It is tradition for her to pass out gum 
after the team's first score. 
</P>
<P>
"No certain brand, mind you," she said. "Especially now, I give them sugarless. 
They must take care of their teeth." 
</P>
<P>
She also attends football practices daily. 
</P>
<P>
"Except Wednesdays," she said. "That's when I go dancing." 
</P>
<P>
She has been known to watch game films with coaches and give pep talks before 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"However, Angie never tells the coach what to do," she said. "That's a no-no." 
</P>
<P>
She has touched the lives of many athletes at Serra, and at times she has been 
rewarded. When the football team won the Southern Section Division VII title 
last year, the players bought Angie a pendant that resembles the championship 
rings they received. 
</P>
<P>
Born in New York City to Italian immigrants, Angie moved to Los Angeles when 
she was 7. She met her husband, Raymond, at a dance. They married in 1936 and 
eventually moved to Hawthorne. They had a daughter, Raemonda, and sons, Frank, 
John and Bernie, all of whom graduated from Serra in the 1950s. Raymond died in 
1981. Frank remains close to the school as the president of its Alumni Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Angie has become the link between different generations of what Frank 
Kretzschmar calls "the Serra man," someone who is "a well-rounded person with 
the ability to work well with people." 
</P>
<P>
Said Principal James E. Crowell: "Twenty-five years ago, when I was a student 
at Serra, there was Angie. Fifteen years ago, when I returned here as a 
teacher, there was Angie. Today, there still is Angie." 
</P>
<P>
A lot has changed in that time. In the 1950s, Serra was all white and all 
Catholic. Today the student body is only 65% Catholic and most of the 300 
students are minorities. A year from now, when the school begins accepting 
girls for the first time, enrollment is expected to jump considerably. 
</P>
<P>
"We went from being an all-white school to an all-black school and now to a 
school that is 50% black, 40% Latino and 10% white and others," Angie said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the change in the school's ethnic makeup, Angie said: "This is the best 
place to learn how to get along with people of other races. So when the kids 
get out of here and experience mixed races, they know what to do and how to 
act. It's no big deal to them." 
</P>
<P>
Tuition is $1,740 for Catholics and $300 more for non-Catholics. With so much 
money at stake, Angie said, it is imperative that Serra students respect the 
school. The campus is graffiti-free, she pointed out because "tomfoolery isn't 
tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
"Our kids know what is expected of them," she said. "They know that if they 
make a mistake they're out (of school)." 
</P>
<P>
That's what makes Serra unique from other educational settings, Crowell and 
Angie said. 
</P>
<P>
"We foster a family spirit here," Crowell said. "As the school population has 
changed, Angie has become an example of our extended family." 
</P>
<P>
Serra, which has won 18 consecutive games and is ranked No. 1 in Division VII, 
played a sloppy, penalty-ridden first half two weeks ago before defeating 
visiting Inglewood, 42-6. Serra took a 22-6 halftime lead, but Angie wasn't 
impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"We look crummy," she said. "I don't want to be in the locker room at 
halftime." 
</P>
<P>
Angie was on the field to help "my players" when they needed her. When 
defensive end Twan Hall was ejected from the game for punching an opponent in 
the first series, Angie took him by the arm. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't punch the dude," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
"Easy, honey. Easy," Angie said. "Calm down. It will be all right." 
</P>
<P>
She encouraged the team to play better. Then, when Jerald Henry scored on a 
six-yard sweep with 5:11 left in the first quarter, she said, "Shall we pass 
out the gum now?" 
</P>
<P>
Off she went down the sidelines, handing out the bounty. Coach Leo Hand took a 
stick and popped it into his mouth. He glanced back at Angie, surrounded by 
football players. 
</P>
<P>
The scene was repeated last night, and will be repeated time and time again for 
years to come.
