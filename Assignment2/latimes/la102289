In "All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers," Larry McMurtry's fifth novel, 
published in 1972, Danny Deck is half in love with Emma Horton, the wife of his 
pal and Rice University classmate Flap Horton. The feeling is mutual, but poor 
Emma is eclipsed when, after an all-night party in the home of Prof. Gordon 
Lloyd-Jons, Danny wakes up next to the leggy, alluring Sally Bynum. On an 
impulse, they marry. Before long, Sally is pregnant. On a second impulse they 
split for the coast. 
</P>
<P>
Sally leaves Danny in San Francisco. Jill, an Oscar-winning screenwriter whom 
Danny meets in Los Angeles, leaves him too -- Jill who seemed so perfect for 
him, an artist who loved his writing as much as she loved him. Back in Houston, 
trying to catch up with Sally and his unborn child, Danny is seduced by Jenny, 
his former landlady, but that can't last. He spends a guilty night with Emma 
while Flap is on a fishing trip, but that can't last either. Sally's father 
attacks him outside the hospital; Danny will not be permitted to see his own 
child. Despondent, he leaves for California again, but not right away. First, 
there is to be a detour to the Rio Grande. 
</P>
<P>
"All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers" is a unique, Western-accented 
birth-of-a-writer novel. Sally and Jill leave Danny, Danny leaves Jenny and 
Emma, but along the way Danny sells his first novel, meets his first editor, 
attends his first literary cocktail party and his first book-signing, and faces 
the fact that he has become a strange sort of being: "The door to the ordinary 
places was the door that I had missed. The door to Emma's kitchen, or to all 
such places. There would never be an Emma's kitchen for me." 
</P>
<P>
That strangeness may be nothing more than the strangeness of any novelist's 
life, novelists living, as they do, more in their made-up worlds than in the 
one the rest of us share. But this is a strangeness Danny is facing for the 
first time. His detour to the Rio Grande becomes the occasion for the rueful 
drowning of the manuscript of his second novel: "A boy drowning a manuscript. I 
would have laughed, if I could have been the one watching. I was never the one 
watching, though. I was always the one the hilarious things were happening to." 
</P>
<P>
The Danny Deck of "All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers" is a genuinely 
lovable character. When Jill tells him "You're so lovable some girl will glom 
onto you five minutes after I leave. No normal woman could ask for more than 
you and a nice apartment," she is only saying what we already know. A rare 
ability to portray the lovability that real people do sometimes have is 
McMurtry's great gift. Not that his protagonists are saints: When a biker tries 
to shake down Gordon Lloyd-Jons, Danny flips the punk over a balcony railing 
and leaves him with a broken hip. But Danny's sins are sins of youth and 
passion, never of venality, calculation or simple meanness. 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry's portrayal of Danny in "All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers" is 
helped along, however, by two features that are missing in "Some Can Whistle," 
the sequel to that novel. The new novel is set 22 years after its predecessor. 
Danny is now 51, a failed novelist but a fabulously successful television 
writer, the creator of a long-running hit, "Al and Sal." The show has been 
canceled, at long last, and Danny has taken a portion of his vast earnings and 
moved back to Texas where, improbably, he has the white-haired Lloyd-Jons as a 
roomer in his mansion. 
</P>
<P>
One day, the phone rings at pool-side. It is his daughter, now 22. Over the 
years, until he lost track of her completely, Danny sent annual birthday 
presents for T. R., as she now calls herself. Sally, T. R.'s mother, returned 
them all. But Danny's fame and presumed wealth have prompted the young woman to 
come looking for her lost father. 
</P>
<P>
Father welcomes daughter despite the fact that he has come to prize his 
solitude: "Once I'd probably felt that I was developing my solitude for the 
sake of my novel, or for some kind of art work, but in recent years I had come 
to realize that that wasn't really true. I had become solitary because I liked 
it and needed it. Aloneness, I had come to believe, did not need an art work to 
justify it." 
</P>
<P>
T. R. represents, in truth, Danny's last chance to break out of his solitude. 
The inconclusive love affairs of "All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers" 
have subsided, in "Some Can Whistle," into inconclusive telephone conversations 
or, worse, into inconclusive messages left on answering machines. The 
rich-and-famous Danny alludes, a bit unconvincingly, to a jet-set past: "There 
were Marella Miracola and Antonella Napthi, the most dazzling and most constant 
of my various Italian loves. I also had a few pictures of women who had never 
been girlfriends, but who nonetheless loomed large in my memories of Europe -- 
Pier Angeli, Francoise Dorleac, Romy Schneider; they flashed in my imagination 
whenever I thought of Paris or Rome." But that, at best, was then. Now is, so 
far as we can tell, a time of semi-voluntary celibacy. 
</P>
<P>
T. R. is working in a hamburger joint when she calls. Danny will learn, in due 
course, that his daughter has not been raised by Sally and her wealthy new 
husband, as he thought, but by her low-life grandparents. She is coarse and 
poor, knows it, and hates herself and him because of it. During the first 300 
pages of this 350-page novel, Danny tracks her down, persuades her to move in 
with him (she brings along her two small children and Muddy Box, the father of 
the younger child), and sets about overcoming two decades' worth of suspicion 
and resentment. As he does all this, he suffers recurrent migraine headaches 
(the migraine is all but an independent character in the first half of the 
book), drifts back in memory to the great days of "Al and Sal," and exchanges 
phone messages with the glamorous or semi-glamorous women of his former life, 
most notably with actress Jeanie Vertus, the one among them who seems genuinely 
in love with him. 
</P>
<P>
These 300 pages depend, novelistically, on the relationship between Danny and 
T. R. Theirs is a boy-gets-girl drama, with the father cast as boy and his 
daughter as girl. T. R. resists Danny's advances, but gradually he wins her 
over. Her resistance ends when, against his tastes and her expectations, he 
takes her dancing in a local roadhouse. En route, there glimmers the 
possibility that as he warms her heart, he will warm his own; in other words, 
that T. R. will, indirectly, work a change in Danny's relationship with Jeanie. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, neither T. R. nor Danny quite comes to life. In an odd, brief 
chapter 10 pages before the end of the novel, Danny, now a reborn novelist, 
says: "It took three years to write the novel. I thought it would be about my 
daughter -- about T. R. Perhaps I thought that in writing it I would discover 
some of the things about her that I didn't know; perhaps I thought the book 
would bring some of her back to me. By truthful imaginings I would find my 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked hard and in time regained a certain art, but the art refused to be 
used as I had hoped to use it. It took its own path, and the path led not to T. 
R. but to the old man . . . The book was a modest success." 
</P>
<P>
"Some Can Whistle" is itself only a modest success, far inferior to the 
brilliant, hilarious, vivid "All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers." Danny 
is the same guy, still standing wistfully at that kitchen door. But his 
innocence, his fumbling are less beguiling in a man of 50 than they were in a 
boy of 25, and wistful phone messages pall more quickly than wistful sex 
scenes. 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry had Danny's youth going for him the first time around; this time he 
doesn't. Worse, perhaps, the older Danny just doesn't get out and around as 
much as the younger Danny did. In the earlier novel, there were a score of 
minor characters: the Rice University librarian, a Mexican janitor, a pair of 
Texas rangers, a gas-station attendant, a redneck landlord, all of them drawn 
with stunning economy and delicious humor. There are many fewer characters in 
the new novel, and they are less well drawn. The physicality of the earlier 
book was exuberant: The Texas rangers toss the long-haired, hippyish young 
novelist across a barbed-wire fence into a field of prickly pears; the novel 
closes with him waist deep in the Rio Grande. The new novel, by contrast, seems 
all talk, far too much of it tedious plot summary from "Al and Sal." 
</P>
<P>
And yet, just at the point when this reader was ready to stop reading, 
something happened in "Some Can Whistle." Life at Danny's Texas mansion flies 
to pieces when Earl Dee, T. R.'s first husband, gets out of jail and commits a 
multiple murder. One of his casualties, most mysteriously, is the voice of 
Danny-the-TV-Writer. What we hear instead, from this point on (which is to say, 
in the last 50 pages of the book), is a voice like that of Larry McMurtry in 
his nonfiction memoir "In a Narrow Grave." Denouement is rarely the most 
interesting part of a novel, but in this one it is. Danny tells us where the 
various characters have ended up, speaking simply with a kind of quiet, adult 
interest, rather as one might in a long letter. As he does this, McMurtry's 
novel most unexpectedly starts to move. Reading this book is like rowing a 
flat-bottomed boat through a reedy, muddy swamp. Your arms have long since 
grown heavy when you notice that you're not hitting mud any more: The water is 
deeper; the reeds are gone; there is a current under the boat; you are moving 
at last. 
</P>
<P>
Those closing 50 pages and a brief, earlier episode featuring Jill Reed, the 
lost love of "All My Friends," are the work of the McMurtry whose devoted 
reader I have been since 1972. The rest seem to be by someone else. 
</P>
<P>
More than generally realized, Los Angeles is the second pole (Texas is the 
first) in McMurtry's work. "Moving On," his fourth novel, contains the finest 
brief description of the freeway ever written. "Some Can Whistle" is, in good 
measure, a Los Angeles novel. There are pages in it about the television 
industry that many who work there may appreciate. But when one of the two main 
characters in a novel is killed and the other starts talking like someone else, 
and when just at that point the reader of the novel finds his spirits picking 
up, there has to be a little something wrong with those characters.

"A Cry for Help: The Tracey Thurman Story" was a realistic and disturbing story 
of spousal abuse. Dale Midkiff and Nancy McKeon were riveting in their 
portrayals of abuser and victim. Such productions are few in number yet 
valuable and substantial in their impact on public awareness. Midkiff and 
McKeon are to be lauded for their contribution.

"Peaceable Kingdom" is the best new show on TV this fall. The stories are 
heartwarming, fresh, entertaining and devoid of the violence that continually 
bombards the tube. The show also displays a positive image of our Los Angeles 
Zoo to the rest of the country.

I am offended by the language and behavior of the cast of "Sister Kate." I find 
it incredulous, insensitive and racist to portray children in such a manner. 
Let me explain further. On the Sept. 21 episode, Sister Kate tried to place the 
little black girl with a white family. The little black boy addressed the girl 
as "woman." At some points during the show, one or both of the children told 
the other to "shut up"; called the other "stupid"; and referred to the family 
as "honky white people." I do not recall that Sister Kate properly corrected 
the children. As this is a situation comedy, and the children appear to be 
under 10 years of age, their language and demeanor are not acceptable.

I like "Baywatch," not just for the well-filmed scenic views of the beach, not 
just for the great-looking swimsuits and not just for showing people having fun 
at the beach, but for showing the tremendous importance of having lifeguards.

HUXLEY IN HOLLYWOOD: BY DAVID KING DUNNAWAY (HARPER &amp; ROW: $24.95; 472 PP.; 
0-06-03095-6) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tom Dardis, Dardis is a free-lance writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
The English novelist Aldous Huxley, accompanied by his wife, Maria, arrived in 
America in 1937 to spend a few months lecturing on pacifism, a "lost cause" 
subject that had gripped Huxley's interest in the few years preceding World War 
II. The Huxleys found the United States endlessly fascinating. It was the 
outbreak of the war in Europe, however, that kept them from returning home. The 
short stay originally planned by the Huxleys became a permanent relocation. 
</P>
<P>
Huxley spent the last 25 years of his life in and around Hollywood, writing, 
while there, a number of screenplays for films that have become classics, like 
"Pride and Prejudice" and "Jane Eyre." He also wrote two novels that were 
highly regarded in their day, "After Many a Summer Dies the Swan" and "Time 
Must Have a Stop." He also wrote a book that became influential in the 1950s 
and '60s, "The Doors of Perception," Huxley's account of his own experiences 
with hallucinogenic drugs. His circle of friends in Hollywood included a 
remarkable number of the interesting people then in residence: Charlie Chaplin, 
Igor Stravinsky, Christopher Isherwood, Greta Garbo, Bertolt Brecht, Anita 
Loos. 
</P>
<P>
In "Huxley in Hollywood," David King Dunnaway has written an account of these 
American years. As his publisher notes, Dunnaway has written two distinct 
books: One is the story of Huxley's intellectual and personal life in 
California. In the second, running as a sort of counterpoint to his 
biographical narrative, Dunnaway has filled up many of his nearly 500 pages 
with brief sketches of the lives and careers of the many new friends Huxley 
made in Hollywood. In the long run, these background interruptions to the main 
story become tedious and add little to our knowledge of Huxley. 
</P>
<P>
Although very nearly blind, the Huxley who began living in California in 1938 
struck many as a truly awesome figure. At 6 feet 4, he was a walking and 
talking tower of knowledge on every conceivable subject. His awareness of 
things was aided by his reading and rereading, from cover to cover, the 11th 
edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica, for which he had luggage specially 
constructed for his endless travels in the 1920s and '30s. In America, Huxley 
turned more and more to mysticism, and it was perhaps to be expected that in 
time he would turn his attention to the newly discovered hallucinogenic drugs. 
He tried them all: mescaline, psiloxbin and, finally, LSD. This combination of 
mysticism and drug-taking led to his writing "The Doors of Perception," his 
little book that, in a sense, legitimized for some the taking of these 
mind-altering drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Huxley made no bones about why he took these drugs when he said that "It's a 
very salutary thing to realize that the rather dull universe in which most of 
us spend most of our time is not the only universe there is." In short, Huxley 
eventually found the real world to be lacking in the phantasmagoric images he 
encountered in his drug trips. It is fair to ask that if Huxley had possessed 
normal vision, would he have preferred this inner world? 
</P>
<P>
It seems that Huxley's ever-growing preoccupation with the state of mind 
produced by the drugs resulted in the steady deterioration of his novelistic 
talent. It became harder and harder for him to express himself meaningfully in 
fictional terms about all the vital issues -- nuclear warfare, environmental 
pollution -- that threatened the lives of his fellows. His last two novels, 
"Ape and Essence" and "Island," suffer badly from the fierce intrusion of the 
essayist into the realm of the storyteller, a strategy that he had been able to 
handle brilliantly in the 1932 "Brave New World." 
</P>
<P>
There is little doubt that Huxley's reputation has faded: The current trading 
value of his stock on the literary exchange is not very high. Except for his 
novel of the future, "Brave New World," which has become a staple in the 
American high school curriculum, few of his nearly 60 books are read much any 
more. When he came to America in 1937, Huxley was perhaps the best known among 
the serious English novelists of his generation. His books were international 
best-sellers, but they were thought to be distinguished contributions to modern 
English literature. However, even before his death in 1963 (the same day as 
John F. Kennedy), Huxley's fame had been eroded sufficiently to make it clear 
that there were at least three of his contemporaries who had displaced him in 
the critical canon: His old friend D. H. Lawrence, James Joyce and Virginia 
Woolf. 
</P>
<P>
Except in a single area, Dunnaway's account does not differ significantly from 
the long and excellent life of Huxley written in 1973 by his close friend the 
English novelist Sybille Bedford. Although Dunnaway has interviewed many of 
Huxley's friends, the Bedford Life presents us with a far more sympathetic, 
warmer Huxley. Indeed, the Huxley in Bedford's book emerges as a much more 
confused man than does the one in Dunnaway's pages. 
</P>
<P>
There is not much that is new here about the famous people that Huxley knew in 
these years. Shockingly, none of them emerge very clearly in the reader's mind 
unless one has read about them elsewhere. Even Garbo and Brecht remain 
perfectly faceless and voiceless. 
</P>
<P>
Dunnaway attempts to make much of Maria Huxley's lesbianism, almost the only 
area in which he offers fresh material. Drawing largely from her letters to her 
family in Belgium and France, as well as from the testimony of friends, 
Dunnaway reveals that Maria conducted a number of affairs with various members 
of the film community. While it has long been known that Maria functioned as 
the principal go-between in arranging her husband's many affairs, Dunnaway 
believes that Maria's sexual nature had much to do with her presumed 
indifference to his marital infidelities. My set of the advance proofs of 
"Huxley in Hollywood" contains many passages concerning Maria's lovers expunged 
by Dunnaway's publishers for, presumably, legal reasons. No such censoring was 
required, however, for the names of the women in Aldous' life. Dunnaway was 
not, apparently, able to obtain them. As for Maria's love life, these 
revelations are mildly interesting, but fail to tell us much about Huxley or 
what he thought about it. 
</P>
<P>
"Huxley in Hollywood" is marred by factual errors: Bertolt Brecht was not at 
any time married to Salka Viertal; Howard Hawks' film "Sergeant York" is not 
"an anti-Nazi blockbuster" but is about an American pacifist in World War I; 
the Kurt Weill and Paul Green play "Johnny Johnson" is a work of 1936, not 1939 
as Dunnaway would have you infer from his text. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the endless potted-history passages that clog the narrative, the 
book is weakened by the carelessness of the writing style. Even by planting the 
idea in David Selznick's mind, it would appear insane to describe Huxley's 
participation in the writing of the "Jane Eyre" script in these terms: "While 
not Bronte's sort of novelist, he spoke like an English don." One short example 
of stylistic banality will suffice: 
</P>
<P>
"He and Maria were soon steering across the Atlantic toward the remains of 
their former lives: What had become of their villa at Sanary? Of Juliette and 
Maria's sisters? They sailed on a Cunard liner."

HOW THEY KILLED THE LITTLE GIRL IN HER; 
</P>
<P>
LION AT THE DOOR BY DAVID ATTOE (LITTLE, BROWN: $17.95; 232 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Margot Mifflin, Mifflin is a contributing editor at Elle magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though "mature" writers from John Updike to Saul Bellow recently have been 
chided for their two-dimensional depictions of women in fiction, David Attoe's 
explosive first novel, "Lion at the Door," proves that you don't have to be a 
woman to penetrate the female psyche. Attoe wiggles into the mind of Hazel 
Sapper, a girl growing up in industrial England in the 1950s, to reveal the 
ruin of her youth -- and life -- by her sexually abusive father. Through the 
voices of Hazel, her daughter and her childhood friend Rosko, Attoe convinces 
us that time doesn't heal all wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Hazel describes her bleak family life in the poetically coarse, abbreviated 
dialect of the English Midlands, where her father is a coal miner. Her tender 
but defeated mother is impotent in the face of her husband's violence. The 
girl's only sanctuary is in books, which her father considers evil, and in 
Rosko, who takes her to the hut in the woods he built as an escape from his own 
domestic hell. Attoe communicates all the girlish charm of Hazel's fervid mind 
while he teases out the brutal realities -- rape, "hidings," the girl's 
thwarted literary ambitions -- that will eventually jaundice it. She indulges 
in loving descriptions of the countryside and has a special fondness for birds 
and plant life, her only reference to a free and unpolluted world: 
</P>
<P>
"And then the gray wagtail, that had scurried up the shallows along the stream, 
said tzissi tzissi, and dipped its head and neck forward with every movement, 
as if it was agreeing with itself, as it flickered over the watery stones." 
</P>
<P>
After Hazel and Rosko are beaten by their parents for falling asleep in the 
hideaway overnight, the boy runs away, and Hazel's remaining school years are 
tinged with loneliness. She waits longingly for his return, then gives up: "I 
realized there was nothing left to wait for and I knew I'd have to be like them 
now with today and tomorrow separate, bossing me . . . I didn't want to hate, 
but I did." 
</P>
<P>
The narrative then passes to Hazel's estranged daughter, who's come home for 
her mother's funeral 25 years later. Daughter (also named Hazel) feels nothing 
for the impassive woman who, she learns from a family friend, bore two children 
by a violent, alcoholic husband after a shotgun wedding, then was abandoned. In 
short, Hazel's capacity for love was suffocated by the brutal men in her life 
and the economic trap they forced her into. Her children -- the products of her 
degradation and defeat -- never knew the playfully intrepid person who once 
inhabited her chilly shell. 
</P>
<P>
When Rosko assumes the narrative voice in the book's final chapter, he's a 
reminder of what could have been, just as daughter Hazel is evidence of what 
was. We don't know half enough about his life or the daughter's, but we learn 
that he returned to Hazel a year before her death to reclaim her friendship, 
only to find her broken and vengeful: "I didn't want what was his inside me," 
she reflects on her first pregnancy. "Once it was in you, leeching for a life 
you didn't have to give, what did it matter what color eyes or hair it would 
have . . . He wanted no different from what my soddin' father did . . . Took it 
the same way. Rough." 
</P>
<P>
This is a relentlessly dark novel, and the question arises: Could a woman bear 
children without ever loving them? Considering the increasing number of mothers 
who drop their infants out of windows or stuff them in garbage cans, however, 
Hazel's plight is not unrealistic. Attoe avoids letting his tale sink into a 
maelstrom of misery by animating his three narrators with rage and imbuing them 
with a vivid, Faulkneresque sense of the local landscape and dialect. He grants 
the reader the final satisfaction of the reunion, at which Rosko is able to 
coax forth a glimmer of the girl he once knew. He later vows to take her some 
garden plants to persuade her to see him again, but what happens between them 
in the months before her death is left to the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
While many first novels are dashed off with cheap cynicism and smug urbanity, 
"Lion at the Door" is a gold mine of complexity, both psychological and 
structural. Attoe has a muscular prose style in which nouns often double as 
verbs, and he's able to shift narrative voices -- male and female -- with 
idiosyncratic realism. Perfectly tuned, exquisitely told, "Lion at the Door" is 
thorny beauty.

Viewers can follow the law in a big way this week. 
</P>
<P>
Three programs that deal with various phases of law enforcement can be found on 
commercial and cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
First comes "Do You Know the Muffin Man?," a new TV movie airing Sunday at 9 
p.m. on CBS (Channels 2 and 8). It concerns a police officer (John Shea) who 
independently tries to gather evidence after his son (Brian Bonsall) reveals 
that he was the victim of abuse at his day-care center. Pam Dawber plays the 
boy's mother. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday at 8 p.m., HBO presents "Perfect Witness." In this made-for-cable 
movie, a New York City restaurant owner (Aidan Quinn) who witnesses a gangland 
murder is pressured by two attorneys (Brian Dennehy, Stockard Channing) into 
testifying before a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
Then Saturday at 9 p.m. on ABC (Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42), Telly Savalas -- who 
is profiled on Page 7 -- returns to prime time as New York city detective Theo 
Kojak. Four new two-hour dramas featuring "Kojak," who has been promoted to 
inspector, will rotate with "Columbo," "B.L. Stryker" and "Christine Cromwell," 
starring Jaclyn Smith, on the "ABC Saturday Mystery."

TRULY WEIRD OR JUST PRETENDING?; 
</P>
<P>
THE HISTORY OF LUMINOUS MOTION BY SCOTT BRADFIELD (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $17.95; 273 
PP.; 0-394-57875-9) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
One of my favorite episodes of the "Mary Tyler Moore Show" involved Mary and 
Rhoda attending a party given by friends of a younger man Mary was dating. The 
generation gap widened perceptibly when one of the young folks decribed his 
idea of a good time as going downtown, acting weird, and hoping someone would 
notice. 
</P>
<P>
This first novel by a San Francisco native who currently teaches at the 
University of Connecticut at Storrs betrays a similar desperation for attention 
at any price. Every page, every sentence, proclaims, "Hey, look at me, I'm 
mind-boggling, shocking, totally outrageous." The writer's stance places the 
reviewer in a neat predicament: Do I denounce this novel as the latest 
manifestation of a decadent society -- and risk taking my place with the 
hapless philistines of yesteryear who trounced innovative artists from 
Baudelaire to Burroughs? Or, do I rush to pay tribute to this book as the 
product of an extraordinarily original mind -- and risk taking it at the 
author's estimation instead of at my own? Or, might it really not be best to do 
what experienced New Yorkers do when a lunatic acts up on a the subway: Ignore 
it -- and risk letting it go its way uncriticized? 
</P>
<P>
"The History of Luminous Motion" sets out at once to shock the reader with its 
craziness and violence while short-circuiting any objections by contradicting 
its own premises. It is narrated in the first person by a brilliant, weird, 
psychopathic 8-year-old named Phillip who writes like a brilliant, weird, 
psychopathic 18-year-old. Phillip takes a pretty good line for a teen-ager, but 
only by putting his words into the mouth of a little boy can the author be sure 
that they are truly astonishing. The only problem is, Phillip doesn't sound 
like a little boy, not even the little superboy he's supposed to be. He sounds 
like a very big boy who's taken one too many creative-writing classes. 
</P>
<P>
We first meet little Phillip traveling in the back seat of his Mom's car: "No 
matter where we went we seemed to be where we had been before. We were more 
than a family, Mom and I. We were a quality of landscape. We were the map's 
name rather than some encoded or strategic position on it. We were like an MX 
missile, always moving but always exactly where we were supposed to be. There 
were many times when I thought of Mom and me as a sort of weapon." 
</P>
<P>
Mom, for her part, says things like, "Culture's just a scheme of rules and 
regulations we've all quite happily agreed to. It's not all cliches, baby . . . 
Culture's got our best interests at heart. Culture's just the walls of a house. 
It's that house I always told you we lived in, only I didn't realize the house 
was culture before." 
</P>
<P>
After years of driving from town to town, picking up strange men, Mom finds a 
man named Pedro to provide her and Phillip with a real home. Phillip has a hard 
time adjusting to "normal" life. He seems, at first, jealous of Pedro, but then 
seems to like Pedro. He decides to kill Pedro, who, in return, makes posthumous 
appearances advising Phillip on how to kill his real father, who, shortly after 
Pedro's demise, conveniently returns to the picture. As Mom retreats into 
alcoholism, Dad shows up to look after the family. He's a good provider, 
showering the boy with presents and sound advice. Mom, still strung out and 
withdrawn, becomes pregnant. Phillip moves toward patricide even though -- 
perhaps because -- he likes Dad: "I was going to return Dad to that world where 
he truly belonged, that fundamental world of basic particles which breathed 
underneath our realer world of mere events." 
</P>
<P>
Phillip has lots of portentous ideas about mass, energy, matter and reality, 
and what goes on in your head, and stuff like that. He makes a pair of friends: 
Rodney, a premature juvenile delinquent, and Beatrice, an infantile 
Marxist-feminist (although of course she, like the boys, is finally too clever 
to fit into any mere category) -- and they sit around drinking, smoking, 
sniffing glue, investigating Satanism and concocting poisons for Phillip's 
father. 
</P>
<P>
No, this is not a socially aware novel about victimized children from broken 
homes who are corrupted by evil influences. As the narrative makes clear, the 
evil is far more radical. We are invited to view it in several ways: as a 
manifestation of mass, energy, motion, time-space, et al.; or as a special 
condition of this particular boy's mentality; or as the intersection of mind 
and matter. The reader may well find himself wondering whether the "brilliant" 
metaphysical ruminations are supposed to make Phillip's crimes more interesting 
or whether the crimes are supposed to add excitement to the ruminations. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, our narrator "grows up": becomes "normal" -- or so he says. If 
we've learned anything by now, we've learned not to trust him. He is returned 
to the bosom of his family. Dad is recovering from the wounds Phillip inflicted 
on him, Mom has given birth to the baby she was expecting, but Phillip seems to 
believe that this is a new, foster family. 
</P>
<P>
To give credit where due, the writing is skillful, the concept genuinely 
offbeat. But does it pass the acid test of being a book one regrets having to 
put down and looks forward to picking up? No. It could be argued that no 
genuinely new or original work would be appreciated, judged by such a standard; 
that no work dealing with repellent subject matter would pass such a "taste" 
test. But, far from being original, this novel is another latecomer in the 
tedious line of bad- seed stories, most recently exploited by Knopf editor 
Gordon Lish in his novel about murder in the sandbox. Whether the subject 
matter is phony or genuine is hard to say. It strikes me as phony, but I don't 
think it finally matters very much whether this novel is echt pathology or only 
a cunning forgery.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: CONSUMING VISIONS: ACCUMULATION AND DISPLAY OF GOODS IN 
AMERICA 1880-1920 EDITED BY SIMON J. BRONNER (WINTERTHUR/W. W. NORTON: $29.95; 
391 PP.)

Two ideas dominate this collection of essays, and between them they express the 
ambivalence Americans historically have shown toward worldly goods. On one side 
of the scale is Thorstein Veblen, who coined the term "conspicuous consumption" 
in his 1899 classic, "Theory of the Leisure Class"; on the other is John 
Wanamaker, the Philadelphia department-store magnate, who described commerce as 
"the great civilizer" and the United States (in a 1906 advertisement) as the 
"Land of Desire." The ideas are not of equal weight in this book, however, for 
"Consuming Visions" chronicles the triumph of Wanamaker's point of view. 
</P>
<P>
"Consuming Visions" consists of 13 essays by social historians examining, among 
other things, interior decoration, commercial window display, the rise of 
museum collections and the Boy Scouts. It's a hodgepodge, to be sure, but that 
characterization shouldn't be taken too negatively; the multiplicity of 
subjects illuminates the extent to which Americans absorbed the consumer frame 
of mind. Materialism always has existed, of course, but in the late 19th 
Century mass materialism was a new concept. The Pilgrim Fathers would have been 
shocked to hear the minister Russell Conwell (an appropriate name) preach: "It 
is your duty to get rich." Nor would they have approved of the maxim inscribed 
on the University of Chicago's social- science building: "When you cannot 
measure, your knowledge is meager and unsatisfactory." The modern age's 
obsession with magnitude already had begun. 
</P>
<P>
The book is full of such interesting arcana -- which makes up for the fact that 
it resembles an incomplete jigsaw puzzle, never giving a clear, reliable 
picture. Who knew, to give more arcana, that in the same year L. Frank Baum 
wrote "The Wizard of Oz" -- 1900 -- he also published "The Art of Decorating 
Show Windows and Dry Goods Interiors," the first book of its kind? That one of 
the earliest interior decorators, Elsie de Wolfe, upon first seeing the 
Parthenon, exclaimed: "It's beige -- my color!"? In "Consuming Visions," we 
meet the enemy, and the mirror the book holds up reflects an indefatigable 
shopper. Chris Goodrich

has vanished from many of its original haunts. Recent concern over the wolf and 
study of its habits are quickly changing the folktale image of the big bad

GIANNI GOES MARCHING ON; 
</P>
<P>
AGNELLI: FIAT AND THE NETWORK OF ITALIAN POWER BY ALAN FRIEDMAN (NEW AMERICAN 
LIBRARY:$19.95; 359 PP.; 0-453-0069-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By George Armstrong, Armstrong is the Rome correspondent for Britain's Guardian 
newspaper. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This book was published last year simultaneously in Britain and in Italy, where 
it was called (in Italian) "All in the Family," a rather more cozy title than 
the Anglo-American one. The French edition of Friedman's book, there called 
"Agnelli, l'Argent et la Politique en Italie," now is vying for custom with 
another book called "Agnelli, l'Irresistible," by Marie France Pochna, a French 
lawyer. Though I probably never shall read Madame Pochna's book, I feel certain 
that the two titles are interchangeable. 
</P>
<P>
Gianni Agnelli was born 68 years ago as heir-apparent to the Fiat car company 
of Turin that his grandfather had founded and which has grown enormously under 
Gianni's tutelage to the point that it controls 25% of all the companies quoted 
on the Milan Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Being born with lots of money, if things are well handled, can bring one lots 
of power. That may even be the only honest way of obtaining such power today. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman says that he started out to write a book on the rich new Italy of this 
closing decade, the author having arrived in Milan in 1985 as one of the 
Financial Times' two correspondents in Italy. Later the author's focus was 
drawn exclusively (irresistibly?) to Agnelli, and to what Friedman calls his 
"network of power." That phrase is often forcefully inserted into the test as 
if it were, in itself, a thing ominous and sinister. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman certainly was right to concentrate his attention on Agnelli. Italy has 
not had a genuine and enduring famous name since the upside-down exit of the 
dictator Benito Mussolini. Nor has the land of song given the world a single 
recent pop singer. Federico Fellini's films since 1973 have been lead balloons 
in the cinema circus. Agnelli is the best-known Italian public figure. 
</P>
<P>
He has achieved this pinnacle through hard work, starting with being the 
country's richest and most renowned young playboy. That takes work as well as 
money. He did not really take up his duties at Fiat until he was 45, and he has 
never entirely put away his playboyish things -- yacht racing, ownership of a 
champion professional soccer team, skiing, and turning up everywhere when there 
is an international gala affair, but one selected with great care. Fiat's 
success as a car-maker, and its success with about 200 other companies owned in 
some way by the Agnelli family, has not been harmed by Gianni's fame as a 
swath-cutting global socialite. The two organizations on the Italian peninsula 
with the best corporate image, thanks in part to well-honed public-relations 
teams, are Fiat and the Vatican. The Pope, of course, inherited a long-tested 
apparatus, and one much longer in business, whereas Gianni has created today's 
Fiat empire, starting with only a couple of first-rate car factories. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman's book was a best seller in Italy and in Britain, and it is difficult 
to understand why. Gianni and Fiat's managing director, Cesare Romiti, are the 
only strong characters in the book and are never in conflict. The average 
reader would need a machete to cut his way through the jungle of acronyms in 
which the two men live in what may soon be their private game reserve. The 
reader is confronted with ENI, IRI, SNIA, BPD, IFAT, IMI, STET, RAI, IFI and 
TELIT, all of them corporations, or groups, with a role to play in the Angelli 
story. Of course, Fiat itself is an acronym (Fabbrica Italiana Automobili 
Torino), but one that is at least graced by being also a Latin word, as in Fiat 
Lux, though that may be known only to Biblical or to Latin scholars and, 
possibly, to the Lever Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen-sink completeness of this book could be a handicap, or another 
penalty readers must pay when any author has fed his computer with every word 
the researchers have come up with on his subject, most of those words taken 
from press clippings. Second helpings are only too rarely denied. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman's chapter called "The Mafia and the Other Mafias" was omitted from the 
Italian edition. It may be that the London and New York publishers felt that a 
book on Italy without the Mafia would lose mercantile value. The chapter only 
touches on the Mafia and is in fact a capsuled history of Italy in the last 
century or so. The "other Mafias," one supposes, are the other "power 
networks." One irresistible quality that Agnelli lacks is that of being a 
Mafioso. 
</P>
<P>
"Gianni Agnelli, outwardly the amiable and charming friend of presidents, 
kings, and prime ministers, is in fact the head of a ruthlessly managed and 
arrogant network of power which virtually amounts to a shadow Italian 
government . . . " (Friedman is right in his shadow reference, but in a country 
where the major Christian Democrat Party has more than the average quota of 
truly shady characters, Italy's present economic prosperity or luck may be at 
least partly due to such an efficient shadow government.) 
</P>
<P>
The Fiat president is "the uncrowned king of Italy, a latter-day despot whose 
family enriched itself by doing business with the Fascist inner circle when 
Mussolini came to power," the author says. (Well, Fiat already was a giant 
power when Mussolini was still a Socialist schoolteacher. Was Fiat expected, 
for 20 years, to turn down contracts from Italy's legitimate government?) 
</P>
<P>
Henry Kissinger, who flies into Italy often on an Agnelli plane to sit next to 
Gianni when his Juventus soccer team is playing, describes him as "somebody for 
whom I have enormous affection and admiration . . . (He represents) the 
permanent establishment, the continuity, that Italy can be proud of," Kissinger 
told Friedman, the good doctor sounding very much like a British monarchist 
speaking of the Queen. 
</P>
<P>
Gianni, his brothers and sisters, Friedman tells us with a Dickensian relish, 
were given candies by their English nanny "after meals (while most Italian 
children were lucky to have a square meal)." In an early post-war survey, 
conducted I believe by the U.N.'s Health Organization, the luckless children of 
poor Italian families were found to be considerably healthier, and with more 
stamina, than their American counterparts, who had been regularly, and 
squarely, stuffed with steak, potatoes, and candy. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it is said in Italy that Agnelli may own Fiat but he does not run it, 
that being done by the stony-faced (and seemingly flint-hearted) managing 
director, Cesare Romiti, brought in for that purpose in 1974. That would make 
Romiti the most powerful man in Italy, and that would make Gianni (people, like 
this reviewer, who do not know Agnelli like to call him Gianni -- for his staff 
he is l'Avvocato, or The Lawyer) more like the Venetian Doge, a ubiquitous 
figurehead, an icon helicoptered from city to city (three in a single day) to 
lend his presence and to spread his grace. 
</P>
<P>
Agnelli also controls newspapers whose sales amount to 25% of the Italian 
national sales and, as Friedman points out, "no one could imagine GM owning 25% 
of the American press." But then no one could have imagined the ownership of 
today's major Hollywood studios, whose products arguably have more worldwide 
influence than daily newspapers. Gianni's two largest dailies never read like 
house organs and happen also to be Italy's best. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman gives less than is due to Agnelli's funding of numerous cultural 
projects in the last decade, something for which the House of Windsor does not 
even open its handbag. Some of these fundings are done on the quiet. An 
exception is the Palazzo Grassi, the largest palace on Venice's Grand Canal. 
Agnelli bought it and had its interior remodeled at a cost of $15 million, and 
it is the best art showcase in Europe. He uses it, about twice a year, when a 
major art show opens and his worldwide court flies in, on their own jets, for 
the grand opening. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the reader may find that the author has tried too hard to demonize 
"The King," and his own admiration for Agnelli's success, and particular life 
style, can be heard banging from inside the closet door. If Italians must have 
a king, they could do (and once did) far worse.

POSITIVE ILLUSIONS: CREATIVE SELF-DECEPTION AND THE HEALTHY MIND BY SHELLEY 
TAYLOR (BASIC BOOKS: $19.95; 290 PP.; 0-465-06052-8) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Nancy Mairs, Mairs' most recent book is Remembering the Bone House: An 
Erotics of Time &amp; Place (Harper &amp; Row). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every so often, and generally by accident, the right book comes along to fill a 
personal need you may not even have known you had. When Shelley Taylor's 
"Positive Illusions: Creative Self-Deception and the Healthy Mind" showed up in 
my mailbox, I was feeling low. The steady worsening of the multiple sclerosis 
that has crippled me over the last 17 years made it likely that I would soon be 
unable to leave my house on my own and would thus lose much of the independence 
I cherish, becoming an increasing burden to my already overextended husband. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in Taylor's chapter entitled "Illusion, Mania and Depression: A View From 
Mental Illness," I read: "Normal people believe to an unrealistic degree that 
the future holds a bounty of good things and few bad things. Depressed people 
are more realistic in their perceptions of the future." Of course! I thought. 
I'm depressed! Or, to use Taylor's terms, in evaluating the likely consequences 
of my increasing debilitation, I was suffering from "depressive realism," "a 
somewhat more accurate view of reality" than most people take, resulting from 
"a lack of or loss of the positive biases that normally shelter people from the 
harsher side of reality." Having a label for my condition, I cheered up 
considerably. 
</P>
<P>
Self-deception has long been assumed to be both morally and psychologically 
unwholesome, a failure to perceive one's real condition and circumstances, 
which signals character weakness if not outright madness. In Taylor's view, 
however, "rather than being firmly in touch with reality, the normal human mind 
distorts incoming information in a positive direction." This distortion, far 
from being maladaptive, enhances the ability to cope with life's difficulties 
and thus actually increases mental health. 
</P>
<P>
The positive illusions involved include self-aggrandizing perceptions of one's 
own qualities and capabilities, overestimation of one's control over 
circumstances, and an overly optimistic assessment of future events. Drawing on 
a range of scientific studies, Taylor -- who teaches psychology at UCLA -- 
examines these adaptive illusions in the context of everyday life and of 
extraordinary adversities like rape, tornadoes and cancer. She concludes that 
"We must view the psychologically healthy person not as someone who sees things 
as they are but as someone who sees things as he or she would like them to be." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's point is persuasive as long as one shares her fundamentally gloomy 
vision of reality, and this is hard to reject because she adopts the detached 
and knowing stance characteristic of much conventional science, which often 
obscures deep personal bias. She states unequivocally, for instance, that 
"Without freedom from illness and disability, the enjoyment of other aspects of 
life is undermined." 
</P>
<P>
Now, in my experience, disability has actually enhanced my enjoyment of a great 
many aspects of life (excluding, obviously, ballroom dancing and the like). In 
Taylor's reasoning, that enhancement is one of the positive illusions I use to 
cope with the bleakness of reality. But who is to say that my enjoyment is 
"really" undermined whereas the enhancement I experience is illusory? 
Implicitly, Taylor is, because she identifies herself as a scientist and points 
out that the chief role of science is "to discover and describe truth." She 
doesn't go so far as to capitalize the T, but the point is clear: An absolute 
discoverable truth exists. And the "real" life it defines is, according to 
Taylor, so distressing and painful that only the "falsely positive nature" of 
our illusions can get us through. For some of us, truth just isn't that easy to 
come at -- and reality just isn't that bad. 
</P>
<P>
Although thus grounded in a grim view of human existence, "Positive Illusions" 
is not a discouraging book. It is generally brisk and authoritative and 
occasionally amusing. Ninety percent of the drivers in one survey, Taylor 
informs us, believed their driving skills to be above average. Think about that 
the next time you're trying to make a left turn through a major intersection at 
rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the prose, though clear, is often tedious: The phrase illusions 
about the self, the world, and the future occurs so often that I began to wince 
each time I saw it. Taylor may repeat her generalizations irritatingly because 
she hasn't found a way to develop them in lively detail. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, she summarizes research studies. Although she occasionally 
gives specific examples, these tend to be brief. Had she expanded these, after 
the manner of Cheri Register in "Living With Chronic Illness" or Maggie Scarf 
in "Unfinished Business," for example, she would have dramatized her points, 
and at the same time absorbed the reader's attention more fully. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson here, I suppose, is that a book needn't be especially well-reasoned 
or well-written in order to serve as the "right" book. It need simply intersect 
meaningfully with the reader's own experience. Taylor's overview of the healthy 
human being in "Positive Illusions" is sufficiently broad -- as well as 
good-natured, responsible and reassuring -- that the book should be "right" for 
a good many of us.

THE CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK JONATHAN HARRIS, Harris is a documentary film maker and author of books 
for children and young adults. His latest is Come the Morning (Bradbury Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Children tend to regard nonfiction books as spinach or lima beans. They may be 
good for you, but they're hard going down. 
</P>
<P>
Too often the children are right. Although the nonfiction written for them may 
be as full of significant facts as spinach is of vitamins, frequently the books 
are dry, boring and unappetizing. 
</P>
<P>
In the right hands, though, nonfiction for children can be as riveting and 
dramatic as any storybook or novel. 
</P>
<P>
Take Aliki's The King's Day: Louis XIV of France (Thomas Y. Crowell: $13.95; 32 
pp.), a picture book aimed for 7 to 11-year-olds. The author-illustrator 
examines life in 17th-Century France by following the brilliant and pampered 
Sun King during a typical day at Versailles. While the facts may be true, the 
story reads like a fairy tale. "Louis XIV was every inch a king," begins Aliki. 
"He wore the curliest wigs, the richest robes, the rarest jewels, and the 
fanciest shoes in all of France." The rituals of Louis' court are as 
fascinating as the king's extravagance, which Aliki captures in her charming 
drawings -- full of plumes and buttons and lace. Like all good fairy tales, the 
book even has an implicit moral: It is better to be a king than a courtier. 
</P>
<P>
The California Gold Rush of 1848-1852 is another historical period in which 
life was as colorful and mythical as fiction. Rhoda Blumberg, an award-winning 
author of history books for children, brings this subject to vivid life in The 
Great American Gold Rush (Bradbury Press: $16.95; 144 pp.). During the Gold 
Rush, the 19th-Century equivalent of today's lottery, argonauts dug up a 
quarter of a billion dollars of gold. Like those who play the lottery, though, 
most wound up with only hard-luck stories for their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Blumberg quotes from the letter of one disappointed miner: "Say to all my 
friends: Stay at home. Tell my enemies to come." The author describes the many 
hardships the gold-seekers faced, especially the difficulties of crossing the 
continent to California, either overland by wagon train, around the Cape Horn 
by ship, or by ship and mule or canoe in "shortcuts" through Panama and 
Nicaragua. Blumberg is more interested in the broad sweep of the Gold Rush than 
she is in individual stories, but she quotes from diaries and letters to give 
the era color and detail. The book is also richly illustrated with paintings, 
sketches, and cartoons of the period. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish Civil War (1936-39) is as romantic a historical event as the 
California Gold Rush, but one that American history textbooks scarcely mention. 
Few high school students know that about 3,000 idealistic Americans joined 
volunteers from around the world to help save the republic of Spain from a 
Fascist takeover. More than half the American volunteers were killed or 
seriously wounded in the fight to preserve Spain's democracy and warn the world 
of the Nazi danger menacing Europe. Two new books for older children recount 
this often neglected chapter of our history: Don Lawson's The Abraham Lincoln 
Brigade: Americans Fighting Fascism in the Spanish Civil War (Thomas Y. 
Crowell: $11.95; 160 pp.) and William Loren Katz and Marc Crawford's The 
Lincoln Brigade: A Picture History (Atheneum: $14.95; 84 pp.). 
</P>
<P>
In this case words tell the story better than pictures. Lawson not only 
provides a richer historical context for understanding the Americans' 
experience in Spain, but his decision to focus on one American couple who 
volunteered -- Robert Merriman and his wife Marion -- makes his book more 
compelling reading. Merriman, who was killed in the Spanish civil war, was also 
the model for the fictional Robert Jordan in Hemingway's "For Whom the Bell 
Tolls." Merriman's personal story gives Lawson's history an intimacy and 
tension that Katz and Crawford's book lacks. Their book, however, quotes a 
broader range of volunteers and is particularly good in describing the racial 
harmony of the Lincoln Brigade, which was the first fully integrated U.S. Army. 
</P>
<P>
The bravery and idealism of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade inspired a generation 
of young Americans in the '30s. A half-century later the brigade still stands 
as a powerful example of sacrifice and heroism. 
</P>
<P>
The columnist Erma Bombeck and photographer-writer Jill Krementz have found 
role models of courage closer to home -- in children fighting life-threatening 
diseases. In I Want to Grow Hair, I Want to Grow Up, I Want to Go to 
Boise(Harper &amp; Row: $16.95; 185 pp.), Bombeck writes about children 
surviving cancer. In How It Feels to Fight for Your Life (Little, Brown: 
$15.95; 132 pp.), Krementz interviews and photographs children with serious 
illnesses or disabilities. Both books portray the emotional resilience of 
children and demonstrate the importance of attitude in fighting sickness and 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
Bombeck started out writing a pamphlet to show that not every child who gets 
cancer dies. Two years later she has written a moving book about "children 
fighting a disease some of them can't even spell." Although many people persist 
in thinking of cancer and death as synonymous, the fact is, today, 40-to-90% of 
kids with cancer survive. Bombeck set out to find the strength and optimism 
that enables children to conquer the disease. 
</P>
<P>
She is particularly drawn to the dark humor and zany antics that children 
employ to cope with their illness: the artificial-limb jokes, the contest to 
see who can wait the longest to throw up during chemo, the crazy answers to 
explain what happened to their hair. Bombeck's breezy style is well suited to 
conveying the gutsiness of the cancer patients, who deserve, she writes, 
"better than buckets of tears and public pity." In her effort to be "upbeat" 
and "optimistic," she sometimes slights the pain, fear and bewilderment of the 
cancer experience, but her interviews, and the many letters she quotes from 
children and their families, provide real examples of hope and courage. 
</P>
<P>
Krementz's book has no good jokes or kooky stories, but it is a more balanced 
book about children facing illness. Ten-to-15% of children in the United States 
have some form of chronic health impairment. Krementz focuses on 14, with 
illnesses ranging from asthma and diabetes to epilepsy and cancer. One boy 
suffers from accidental burns, another from a gunshot wound that severed his 
spinal cord. Whatever the specifics of their illness or disability, the 
children have many emotional reactions in common: They talk about feelings of 
aloneness, helplessness, and hope. 
</P>
<P>
Children suffering from severe or chronic health problems will especially 
appreciate Krementz's book, for it captures truths about illness that only 
young patients can convey. One thoughtful, articulate young girl suffering from 
cancer emphasizes how important it was for her to meet and talk with another 
young girl who had just completed chemotherapy treatments. "One of the 
requirements for a medical degree should be to have had a serious illness," she 
comments later. Another 14-year-old boy with congenital heart problems says 
about his open-heart surgery: "One thing I can say for sure is that now I know 
how to fight for my life and never give up hope." 
</P>
<P>
The power of these witnesses is not just their insight and courage, but that 
they have survived. Inspiration for adults as well as children.

NOTHING FAILS LIKE SUCCESS; 
</P>
<P>
IRWIN SHAW: A BIOGRAPHY BY MICHAEL SHNAYERSON (G. P. PUTNAM'S SONS: $21.95; 441 
PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-399-13443-3) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Neal Gabler, Gabler is the author of An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews 
Invented Hollywood. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps the tragedy of Irwin Shaw was that he eluded categorization. He was a 
burly lumberjack of a man with woolen curls and a broken beak of a nose, but 
his best prose had a delicacy and plaintive rue that belied his displays of 
machismo. He flirted with the left during the savage political wars of the '30s 
and '40s, winning praise as a voice of proletarian malaise, but the '50s 
revealed him as nondoctrinaire and essentially apolitical. He made his 
reputation with an avant-garde anti-war play and solidified it with a stunning 
series of stories in The New Yorker, but he would soon be regarded and then 
dismissed as a popular writer, not a literary one. Shaw himself, speaking of 
writing but also providing a defense of his life, once said it gave him "the 
private and exquisite reward of escaping from the laws of consistency." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so, but the Irwin Shaw who emerges in Michael Shnayerson's thorough, 
shrewd and compelling biography would always be plagued by his own resistance 
to those laws. Born in Brooklyn in 1913 of a middle-class Jewish family that 
would be wrecked by the Depression, Shaw (nee Shamforoff) attended Brooklyn 
College, then landed a job cranking out radio scripts like the protagonist of 
his famous story, "Main Currents in American Thought." At 22, he wrote his 
anti-war agitprop drama, "Bury the Dead," and immediately captured the 
attention of New York's intelligentsia who hailed him as a second Clifford 
Odets. The next year he would make his first appearance in The New Yorker. He 
also would be lured to Hollywood to write screenplays. The die was cast. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw's stories were praised and anthologized, and his first novel, "The Young 
Lions," a saga of three soldiers enduring the war, caused a sensation. But as 
he shuttled easily between New York and Hollywood, between the literary world 
and what the literati disparaged as the world of commerce, Shaw paid dearly for 
his success. His reputation suffered. The literati began attacking him. Leslie 
Fielder in a typical broadside called his work "half-art." Others regarded him 
as a hack -- a literary whore. In any case, as Shnayerson demonstrates, Shaw 
became to some a symbol of the corruption of a serious writer, to others a 
symbol of the deterioration of public taste. It wasn't just that he was no 
longer a literary writer. It was that he was a turncoat, sacrificing his art 
for the almighty dollar -- an awful sin in New York intellectual circles. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw tried hanging on to his literary reputation, but it was impossible. Partly 
he was the victim of jealousy, partly of revenge for his not playing by the 
rules and not living the austere literary life. (Norman Mailer's analysis of 
why the literary establishment reviled Shaw: "Because he's very rich, he likes 
martinis -- and he's Jewish.") Partly, however, it was because Shaw's style 
wasn't high literary. With the exception of a few late potboilers he batted 
out, it wasn't pulp melodrama either. Sadly for him, Shaw existed in a limbo 
where there are no proponents -- too good to get lumped with mercenaries like 
Sidney Sheldon, not good enough to be elevated into the pantheon. 
</P>
<P>
With sensitivity to both the irony and pathos of Shaw's predicament, Shnayerson 
deploys the tension between lucre and literature as the theme of his book, and 
he is brilliant at detailing the shape and meaning of Shaw's life as well as 
his victimization by literary politics. But this is also a critical biography, 
one which intends to establish Shaw's rank as something more than a master 
storyteller, a backhanded accolade Shaw often received in his later years. If 
there is a deficiency to "Irwin Shaw," it may be Shnayerson's inability 
finally, despite a close and canny examination of Shaw's work, to substantiate 
the writer's claim on greatness. Shaw's voice was unmistakable: fleet, fluid, 
youthful even when the subject was jadedness, simultaneously wistful and wry. 
(Unfortunately, possibly for legal reasons, very little of Shaw's prose appears 
in the book.) He had craft. What he lacked was a governing sensibility, a 
comprehensive and complex vision of the world, the tenacity of mind and spirit 
to galvanize each work with his desperation. William Styron, a friend, called 
it pain: "There's not enough true pain in his work." 
</P>
<P>
In his life Shaw had pain in abundance. Married for 30 years to a peevish and 
jealous woman (for good reason, one should quickly add) with whom he had 
virtually nothing in common, fretting over his finances despite his 
extraordinary wealth, suffering badly the decline of his status and realizing 
he couldn't appease the gods of criticism, condescended to by the new 
generation of serious writers, Shaw nevertheless refused to play the role of 
anguished artist. Instead he became, in Shnayerson's word, a figure. 
</P>
<P>
Abandoning the United States, largely for tax reasons, and settling in a Swiss 
ski village named Klosters, Shaw conducted an endless bacchanal of convivial 
drinking, affairs, parties, tennis matches and ski runs, joined by dozens of 
illuminati who couldn't resist his company. His life did corrupt his writing; 
he was now turning out "Rich Man, Poor Man," "Beggarman, Thief" nd "Evening in 
Byzantium" where once he had produced "The Girls in Their Summer Dresses" and 
"The Eighty-Yard Run." But as Shnayerson reasons it, Shaw had chosen to make "a 
veritable artwork of his life." The writing now seemed to come second. 
</P>
<P>
As Shaw's life sputters to its conclusion, his biography inescapably does too. 
In the end, Shaw devolved into an aching hulk, disabled by arthritis and 
debilitated by drink, though with "Rich Man, Poor Man" he was to become 
commercially more successful than ever. The games had worn thin. So had the 
womanizing. He finally divorced his wife only to remarry her years later when 
he was felled by illness and needed companionship. When he died in 1984 at age 
70, his friends and family decided to scatter half his ashes near Klosters as 
Shaw had instructed, but they also carried half home to the United States. It 
was a gesture perfectly in keeping with Shaw's life. Even in death Shaw would 
be divided. Even in death, as this exacting and elegant biography makes plain, 
Shaw would labor to escape the awful laws of consistency.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: LEGENDS, LIES &amp; CHERISHED MYTHS OF AMERICAN HISTORY BY

<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Shenkman is so eager to debunk popular beliefs, he wastes a great deal 
of effort setting up straw men, just so he can knock them down. His research is 
derived entirely from secondary sources, and his "revelations" often amount to 
restatements of the obvious, e.g., machines credited to single inventors are 
actually refined versions of earlier prototypes. He also fails to consider the 
significance of the myths he discredits. Andrew Johnson may have been the only 
President born into poverty (a term Shenkman fails to define adequately), but 
why do Americans like to think of their leaders as men who rose from rags to 
riches? The chapter deriding popular nostalgia for the pre-World War I era 
contains outrageous, unsupported pronouncements about pollution and poverty. 
Shenkman's assertion, "Nothing we have today compares with the horrible 
conditions of tenement life in the Gilded Age," might come as a revelation to 
thousands of families living in slums, cars and cardboard boxes.

From Alexis de Tocqueville to ALF, foreigners traditionally have offered the 
most insightful comments on American mores and foibles. During the early '60s, 
Indian novelist R. K. Narayan traversed the United States, carefully recording 
his bewilderment at such curious American phenomena as cafeterias and the New 
York subway system. He's bemused by the cheerful vulgarity of a woman who 
expects facile answers to complex metaphysical questions, dismayed by the 
crudely made brew American restaurants call coffee and charmed by the reclusive 
Greta Garbo. A chapter on Los Angeles includes notes on meeting Aldous Huxley 
and various studio executives, descriptions of the vanished charms of Pershing 
Square and dismayed reactions to the smog and traffic. Highly entertaining 
sketches of the United States as seen through Indian eyes.

ENDPAPERS: SEIZE THE DAY, SAID THE OLD SALT, SEIZE THE DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, Balzar is a Times political writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A roustabout once explained to me why he was forever heading off on some 
unfathomable new quest to tax the body, mind and spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike him, he said, people who seek the safe way of urban routines spend far 
too much of their lives looking over their shoulders, worrying about what 
they've done, what is already past. When they're not looking back, he 
continued, they're worrying about what awaits them tonight, tomorrow or next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad, he said. These people hardly have time for the present. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, my adventurer friend dedicated himself to that other existence, 
hanging his weather-beaten hide out there on the edge, where there is no 
distraction from the past or the future, where life at the moment upwells with 
urgency for no other reason than that it is placed intentionally at risk. 
</P>
<P>
This passion to live in the present seems to me superior to the old wheeze 
"Because it's there" as an answer to the question "Why climb mountains?" Or, 
for today's purposes, to the question, "Why get in a small boat and set sail 
across the ocean?" 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Joshua Slocum was the first man to sail around the world alone. Not only 
was he a seafarer and a hero to seafarers for his deeds, he was a pretty good 
storyteller, too. It is a legacy for which we of less adventuresome disposition 
have been thankful for almost 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
His book, "Sailing Alone Around the World," published first in magazine 
installments at the turn of the century and still in print today, is the 
classic of a long-lasting genre of small-boat sailing adventures -- books that 
whether written of Slocum's voyage in 1895-98 or a trip that ended a week ago 
Tuesday are filled with the same thing: the vital, throbbing single-mindedness 
of the present. 
</P>
<P>
Slocum was a clipper-ship captain rendered obsolete by the arrival of the 
steamship -- "cast up from the ocean," he wrote, and plopped just like that 
onto the hard, frozen ground of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
He was not a fretter, though, and when someone offered him a rotting 37-foot 
sloop, he did the natural thing: He fixed it up and went sailing. 
</P>
<P>
My deadpan is intentional. That is how Slocum regarded adventure -- he just did 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Working with hand tools, he rebuilt the boat, Spray, from scratch. He 
provisioned it and set sail, at age 51, without engine, without radio, without 
weather forecasts, without a Panama Canal, without a whimper of doubt, and 
completely by himself. Forty-six thousand miles later, he had outrun pirates, 
survived storms, outwitted wild Indians, taken measure of the great beauty of 
the planet and returned home. And rarely does he raise his writer's voice, 
never growing breathless or smearing the pages with flamboyant adjectives. 
</P>
<P>
He reminds us of the resourcefulness that people can find in themselves when 
backed alone against the wall in an inescapable moment that is the present. 
</P>
<P>
Impoverished natives of Tierra del Fuego stalked Slocum relentlessly across the 
straits of South America. He responded with carpet tacks he kept aboard. After 
anchoring, he spread tacks across his deck and went below to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, it is well known that one cannot step on a tack without saying something 
about it," he writes. "A pretty good Christian will whistle when he steps on 
the 'commercial end' of a carpet tack; a savage will howl and claw the air, and 
that was just what happened that night about twelve o'clock, while I was asleep 
in the cabin, where the savages thought they had me, sloop and all, but changed 
their minds when they stepped on deck, for then they thought that I or somebody 
else had them." 
</P>
<P>
Another lasting but wholly different sailing yarn was spun nearly three 
generations later by renegade Hollywood actor Sterling Hayden in his 
autobiography "Wanderer." On the wharfs and marina docks across America, 
sailors today treasure their copies of this elegant, enlightening and richly 
spellbinding 1963 book that was re-issued in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden lived from 1916 to 1986, but greater than the span of years was the 
cultural gulf that his life bridged. As a strapping and hungry young hand, he 
worked the fishing schooners off the banks of New England through gale-tossed 
winters; as a celebrity, he harvested the success and torment of a Los Angeles 
he found befouled by smog and lawyers and venal ambition. 
</P>
<P>
Buffeted by the extravagant extremes of his life, Hayden sought peace 
intermittently at sea. He may be remembered chiefly for his character roles in 
movies like "Dr. Strangelove," but Hayden considered himself a fraud behind the 
camera. He was in his heart a sailor, and, as it turned out, a writer, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Wanderer" begins with the 1959 event that titillated Hollywood -- a leap for 
freedom so brassy as to be incomprehensible. Who would give up rich film offers 
to trundle his children off to Tahiti in a leaky old schooner named Wanderer 
crewed by people picked from a newspaper want ad? Who indeed, asked a Los 
Angeles judge, in issuing an injunction against taking the children on any such 
voyage. The judge acted in response to a petition by Hayden's ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
Soon thereafter, bound for the South Pacific with children and crew -- the 
judge be damned -- Hayden ordered this devilish entry into Wanderer's log: 
"Your honor, sir, the proposed ocean voyage is no longer enjoined -- for the 
record that is." 
</P>
<P>
Hayden covers a rich inventory of other ocean passages on romantic old 
schooners, a scattering of Hollywood "moments," his oddball childhood and his 
days as a World War II OSS gun-runner. But more than a entertainment bio, 
"Wanderer," at its root, like Hayden himself, is a call to arms for adventure. 
</P>
<P>
He mocks the men who say, "I've always wanted to sail to the South Seas but I 
can't afford it." 
</P>
<P>
"What these men can't afford is not to go. They are enmeshed in the cancerous 
discipline of 'security.' And in the worship of security we fling our lives 
beneath the wheels of routine -- and before we know it our lives are gone." 
</P>
<P>
This compulsion to live for the moment underlies most good true-life sailing 
yarns. And nowhere is the drive stronger and purer than in Bernard Moitessier's 
solo account of his participation in the first around-the-world, nonstop, 
single-handed sailboat race. 
</P>
<P>
His book is "The Long Way," first published in 1973 and now available from 
Grafton Books' The Mariner's Library, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Frenchman Moitessier, a few pals and some acquaintances found themselves in the 
late 1960s similarly intrigued with the idea of sailing their boats alone 
around the world without stopping, from Europe down past the capes of Africa, 
New Zealand and South America. The Sunday Times of London heard of the talk and 
announced a race with a 5,000 prize. 
</P>
<P>
Few sailors can resist a race. In the summer of 1968, the handful of 
competitors left, each carrying more than a year's worth of supplies, 
Moitessier aboard the 40-foot ketch Joshua. 
</P>
<P>
Moitessier is a lyrical, inward-looking writer as eccentrically passionate 
about the mystic sea as Edward Abbey was about the Southwestern desert. 
</P>
<P>
Readers have reported feeling slightly loopy at the end of Moitessier's account 
of months on end, utterly alone at the far reaches of the sea. 
</P>
<P>
"I am neither happy nor sad, neither really tense nor really relaxed," he wrote 
of his approach to the Horn. "Perhaps that is the way it is when a man gazes at 
the stars, asking himself questions he is not mature enough to answer. So one 
day he is happy, the next a bit sad without knowing why. It is a little like 
the horizon: For all your distinctly seeing sky and sea come together on the 
same line, for all your constantly making for it, the horizon stays at the same 
distance, right at hand and out of reach." 
</P>
<P>
What occurs next separates Moitessier from other adventurers, and establishes 
him as a cult hero. 
</P>
<P>
After rounding the Horn and heading home on the final leg of the "race," 
Moitessier struggles with himself, sanity, society's values. And he alters 
course. Forget the race. Onward around the world still more, past Africa a 
second time, through the Indian Ocean and back to the Pacific again. Onward to 
Tahiti -- one-and-a-half times around the world, alone and without stopping. 
</P>
<P>
After such books and such adventurers, how much, really, is there left to say 
of this business of man-against-the-sea? 
</P>
<P>
How about a troubled 1980s teen-age girl against the sea? How about this girl, 
a Manhattan bicycle messenger who hangs out aimlessly with the urban flotsam of 
the East Village, coaxed by her anguished father into an adventure that will 
risk her life to save it? 
</P>
<P>
Tania Aebi sets out in 1985 in Varuna, a tiny 26-foot sloop, never having 
sailed alone before, having slept through her navigation class, knowing little 
of mechanics or blue-water weather. Not out of sight of New York, she screams 
on her VHF radio, "Daddy! Daddy!" as the engine quits. She doesn't know how to 
anchor properly. Her boat leaks badly. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you only learn things in this world the hard way," her father warned 
her. 
</P>
<P>
She leaves New York a girl and returns more than two years later, the first 
American woman to circumnavigate the globe alone. Her romantic adventure is 
told, with the help of magazine journalist Bernadette Brennan, 
straightforwardly and with broad appeal in "Maiden Voyage," published this 
August by Simon &amp; Schuster. 
</P>
<P>
It is a story of little-girl tears, such as when her ocean-going companion 
Dinghy-the-cat falls ill and dies. Of huge displays of courage -- her lone 
weapon for protection is a false beard to wear as a disguise. It is a story of 
fresh eyes on faraway places. And a story of discovery as Tania finds those two 
priceless treasures, love and self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Approaching New York on her return in a November gale of 1987, she reflects: "I 
remember back to the days before leaving New York, when I worried if I would 
ever adapt to a life at sea on my own. Having done it, I realized now how much 
more is possible. But I could never have known had I not tried."

Jack Nicholson has the title role in "The Murder of Napoleon," being developed 
by producer Thom Mount at Warner Bros. The Deric Washburn ("The Deer Hunter") 
script is based on Ben Weider and David Hapgood's book of the same name, which 
Nicholson optioned several years ago. Their tome, a blend of history and 
detection, relates how a Swedish dentist discovered convincing proof that 
Napoleon was slowly poisoned to death with arsenic during his final years in 
exile on St. Helena. . . .

Independent film, which also stars Jack O'Halloran, Don Stroud, Leo Gordon and 
Dick Miller, began shooting last week under Fred Olen Ray's direction. . . .

construction is about to get under way on an outdoor replication of Rodeo Drive 
for Nelson Entertainment's "The Taking of Beverly Hills." To start filming next 
March, it will pit Ken Wahl against terrorists who take over that street. . 
Jill Schoelen (star of the November release "Phantom of the Opera"), Don 
Michael Paul ("Heart of Dixie") and Sean Kanan ("Karate Kid III") are the leads

THIS PROGRAM IS for those concerned citizens who, after reading in the morning 
newspaper about what absurdities elected officials have committed, immediately 
want to register a strong dissent with their representatives. 
</P>
<P>
It's a gap that GOVERN-U.S. was made to fill. GOVERN is a standard mail-merge 
program with a twist. Instead of the usual data base filled the names and 
address of customers and subscribers, GOVERN contains the names and addresses 
of all members of Congress, each of the nine justices on the Supreme Court and 
all major officials of the executive branch (from the President to the head of 
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.) 
</P>
<P>
An expanded version also includes House Committees, Senate Committees, Joint 
Congressional Committees, Committee Assignments and foreign embassies. Finally, 
in case you need to remind your representatives of the basic law of the land, 
GOVERN also contains copies of the Constitution of the United States and 
Declaration of Independence. 
</P>
<P>
The way GOVERN works is simple. All you do is call up GOVERN's standard letter 
form, enter the text of the letter, and GOVERN prints out a properly addressed 
copy to each public official you designate. (You designate a public official by 
placing his name in a custom mailing-list file. Thereafter, every time you 
write a letter, GOVERN sends out individually addressed copies to everyone on 
your mailing list.) If you wish, GOVERN will also address the envelopes as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 GOVERN-U.S. is a shareware program ($3 for the basic version) available from 
California Freeware (805) 273-0300. If you plan to use GOVERN regularly, the 
publisher (Foundation for Infinite Survival Inc., of Berkeley) asks that you 
register your copy for $28, which also entitles you to free updates and the 
expanded public official data base.

TOLL ROAD WARRIOR

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Toll Road Warrior" Bob Poole will never win over the opposition as long as he 
continues to deflect his critics with comments such as: What's so bad about 
letting "fat cats in their BMWs willingly pay a bunch of extra money to use 
their cars?" I happen to be a BMW owner, and I am neither wealthy nor 
extravagant, as implied by his remark. I am already paying "a bunch of extra 
money" to use my car through higher license fees, higher insurance and higher 
maintenance costs, and these are not monies I spend willingly. What makes him 
think I would willingly pay to make use of his proposed toll roads? The only 
reason I will make use of the toll roads he proposes will be because my time 
has a higher value used somewhere other than sitting in stop-and-go traffic on 
the freeway. Even then, it will be done unwillingly.

As a woman the same age as Christie, I offer a female perspective on why 
Playboy's image has dwindled over the years with suggestions on how they can 
improve it. 
</P>
<P>
Playboy, especially the Playboy Channel, has focused on the male fantasies of 
who women are and what they desire. Women are shown totally nude while the men 
are clothed; women are portrayed as insatiably sex-starved and mindless, and 
the story lines and dialogue are ridiculous. If Playboy truly wants success, it 
needs to consider its female viewers and its couples, and to understand that 
today, while we welcome fantasy, we also need some reality, honesty and 
responsibility in sexual and personal relationships. The old days are over. 
Playboy needs to grow up, too.

POP EYE: KROQ CAUGHT BETWEEN ROCK AND A HARD PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is KROQ-FM ready to make a weighty change in its format . . . weighty as in 
heavy-metal? 
</P>
<P>
If you believed the rock rumor mill, you'd think KROQ -- once L.A.'s hippest 
radio outlet and a key influence on national programming trends -- could be 
going in any musical direction. After an 18-month rating slump, KROQ has 
slipped to a lowly No. 16 in the latest Arbitron ratings, shaken up its 
programming staff, fired longtime afternoon-drive deejay Dusty Street and 
replaced many of its techno-pop dance tunes with current hits by Guns N' Roses, 
Faith No More, Tom Petty and (gasp) the Rolling Stones. 
</P>
<P>
New station manager Trip Reeb didn't mince words: "I think one of the biggest 
mistakes this station ever made was not playing the Guns N' Roses album when it 
came out two years ago. And we won't make that mistake again. We're going to be 
a rock station -- a station playing harder-edged, guitar-oriented music." 
</P>
<P>
Call it Rock of the '90s. "If we come across the right new metal song, which we 
feel crosses over to our audience, we'll play it," said Reeb, who came to KROQ 
from 91X, San Diego's hip rock outlet. "When I first got here, I asked the 
question -- why not play Metallica? Why not play Soundgarden? Those are hip, 
musically adventuresome bands, which is exactly what KROQ has always been 
about." 
</P>
<P>
Don't worry -- KROQ isn't aiming for the Hair Brigades. "I don't care how many 
records they sell -- you're never going to see us play Bon Jovi," Reeb 
promised. 
</P>
<P>
But the times they are 'a changing. By the mid-1980s, KROQ had grown from a 
tiny underground rocker to an L.A. powerhouse. Under the tutelage of program 
director Rick Carroll, The ROQ eclipsed cobwebby album-rock outlets such as 
KLOS-FM and the late KMET-FM with a potent combination of sassy deejays, a 
post-punk playlist and a hip attitude that embraced every ditzy new trend 
popular with L.A.'s style-conscious teens. 
</P>
<P>
By last year, the hot streak was over. Plagued by a troubled personal life, 
Carroll was rarely around (he died last July after a brief illness). Without a 
firm hand at the helm, the station lost touch with its notoriously fickle 
youthful audience. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, the station was a victim of its own success. When KROQ was sold 
for a record $45 million in 1986, it became obvious that L.A. rock radio had 
enormous profit potential. As heavy-duty competitors such as Power 106 and 
KQLZ-FM (Pirate Radio) jumped into the market, KROQ was forced to compete 
against better-financed rivals, each armed with splashy contest give-aways and 
huge marketing budgets. 
</P>
<P>
As each new station arrived, it borrowed the most accessible items from KROQ's 
format. Meanwhile, the station's house bands -- Oingo Boingo, the Cure and the 
B-52's -- graduated to pop stardom and Top 40 radio. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone told you 18 months ago that the Cure would sell out Dodger Stadium 
and get played every night on KIIS-FM," said Reeb, "you'd have thought they 
were nuts. Now you can hear them everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Reeb says KROQ was especially hurt by Pirate Radio (Home of the Power Ballad), 
which has snatched a huge chunk of KROQ's young male audience. "They marketed 
themselves superbly," he said. "They came in with a rebellious, 
we'll-do-anything attitude that was -- well -- our attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Reeb isn't taking the loss of his key rock listeners lying down. He's brought 
in a sharp, 25-year-old program director, Andy Schuon, a "radio fanatic," 
who'll help give the station a strong sense of on-air production. Reeb is also 
toning down his air staff: "Honestly, I think our jocks talked too much. Over 
the music. Into the music. They talked a lot! 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to use the MTV analogy, but we'd like to give the station the same 
striking audio image that MTV has done with its visual image. We want to create 
a whole attitude -- and environment -- that captures what KROQ is all about -- 
nutty, off-beat and unpredictable." 
</P>
<P>
KROQ's deejays are hoping for the best. "They had to do something with the 
ratings so down lately," said The Poorman, the station's 9 a.m. to noon deejay. 
"We're all hoping this will be the answer. I'm sure people are saying KROQ may 
have run its course. But I'm the eternal optimist. I think if we can play the 
right music, we can make a comeback." 
</P>
<P>
Dusty Street, who had been at KROQ for eight years, was less optimistic. 
"Everyone's shaking in their boots over there," said Street, who claimed she 
was fired because she had "too strong of a personality." 
</P>
<P>
"Disc jockeys no longer have any voice. They might as well hire people with no 
ears. By the end of the year, I doubt seriously the station will resemble what 
KROQ used to be." 
</P>
<P>
Reeb disagreed. "I think there's only been a big uproar because I came in and 
did everything at once. Dusty is very talented. But she's a renegade. And I 
couldn't see her adjusting to the way we wanted to handle the format. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not the radical departure people think. The station had just become 
too limited by the dance-oriented 
</P>
<P>
format. We want to keep our loyal listeners -- and add a new generation of 
listeners too. The way to do that is not to forsake the bands that have always 
had a special place at KROQ. But pop music is constantly changing -- and we 
want to change with it."

$25 GUIDE: DEBUTS AND COMEBACKS DOMINATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Artistic comebacks, quality rap and promising debuts dominate this combined 
September-November edition of the $25 Guide, a blueprint for keeping up with 
what's exciting in pop music on a record budget of $25 a month. All the albums 
are available in compact disc, though CD buyers have to think in terms of a $45 
monthly budget. 
</P>
<P>
September 
</P>
<P>
Paul McCartney's "Flowers in the Dirt" (Capitol) -- Artistic Rebound No. 1. 
Don't let its modest commercial showing mislead you into thinking that this is 
just another mediocre McCartney album. In his best collection in more than a 
decade, McCartney, writing four tunes with Elvis Costello, exhibits some of the 
old Beatles grit and samples of the warmth and charm that have characterized 
his most appealing work over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Boogie Down Productions' "Ghetto Music: The Blueprint of Hip Hop" (Jive/RCA) -- 
Good Rap No. 1. KRS-One's Biblical scholarship (on "Why Is That?") is open to 
question, but the New Yorker is turning into the Curtis Mayfield of rap. His 
socially conscious looks at inner-city problems and challenges are clear-eyed 
and inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
The Stone Roses' "The Stone Roses" (Silvertone/RCA) -- Welcome Debut No. 1. The 
guitar-rich "She Bangs the Drums" is as exquisite as R.E.M. taking another trip 
through "Rockville," only this time there's a shadowy, psychedelic edge. 
Elsewhere, this young British band sounds like the Byrds on a magical mystery 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
October 
</P>
<P>
Bob Dylan's "Oh Mercy" (Columbia) -- Artistic Rebound No. 2. Thanks to 
marvelously soulful production touches by Daniel (U2, Peter Gabriel) Lanois and 
to Dylan's most satisfying collection of songs since 1983's "Infidels," this 
examination of personal and social storm clouds is a heartwarming revelation. 
</P>
<P>
Aerosmith's "Pump" (Geffen) -- If 1987's nifty "Permanent Vacation" hadn't 
already given Aerosmith a dramatic comeback album, this taut collection of 
good-natured scorchers ("Love in an Elevator") and gentle reflections ("Janie's 
Got a Gun") would be yet another in the year's remarkable number of returns to 
form -- a series that began in January with Lou Reed's striking "New York." 
</P>
<P>
James McMurtry's "Too Long in the Wasteland" (Columbia) -- Welcome Debut No. 2. 
John Mellencamp helped in the studio, while Dylan, John Prine and Guy Clark 
helped supply inspiration for this Texas songwriter, whose best tunes speak 
about small town values, lost and found, with conviction and freshness. 
</P>
<P>
November 
</P>
<P>
Neil Young's "Freedom" (Reprise) -- Artistic Rebound No. 3. Young always said 
all those strange shifts of direction (from rockabilly to techno-pop) were 
simply his way of keeping his creative spirit alive and that he would 
eventually deliver an album that would dazzle us. Here it is: a show-stopping 
blend of the beauty of "After the Gold Rush" and the dark intensity of 
"Tonight's the Night." An album of the year candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Big Daddy Kane's "It's a Big Daddy Thing" (Cold Chillin'/Reprise) -- Good Rap 
No. 2. There's a silky, sensual feel to these beats that recalls the seductive 
Memphis soul sound of the '60s and '70s -- the ideal backdrop for one of 
today's most authoritative and stylish hard-core rappers. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmie Dale Gilmore's "Jimmie Dale Gilmore" (Hightone) -- Nashville power 
brokers can boast all they want about how country music has returned to its 
roots, but it's just a lot of hot air as long as they keep giving their awards 
to mediocre artists like George Strait and Dwight Yoakam while ignoring people 
with the honky-tonk vitality and vision of Gilmore (whose singing is even 
sharper than on his first Hightone release) and his Texas sidekicks Joe Ely and 
Butch Hancock.

ROCK 'N' ROIL: DEBATES ON WHO'S NO. 1, RACISM, SEXISM AND CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Hilburn hit it right on the nose when referring to the Stones of the 
1970s, saying that other bands made better albums and or exerted more influence 
but couldn't overcome the Stones' dominance in terms of historical importance 
and fame. 
</P>
<P>
All politicians, fighters and rock bands have high and low periods, and that is 
to be expected. But very few can stand the test of time. 
</P>
<P>
Guns N' Roses may be considered the best rock 'n' roll band around today, but 
it's the Rolling Stones who still are called the greatest rock 'n' roll band in 
the world.

A "Showdown at the Coliseum"? As a 20-year veteran of Rolling Stones concerts 
who has seen the Stones on the same bill with many fine artists, I can attest 
to the fact that there are few feelings comparable to the letdown that occurs 
the moment the Stones themselves hit the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Let's drop this talk about "upstaging" -- I don't believe the Stones have 
played with much passion, or even in tune, for decades -- and tip our hats to 
these master entertainers, canny (and secure) enough to bring us a better show 
than they can put on themselves.

Concerning the Sept. 24 Pop Eye column's mention of Mott the Hoople and 
guitarist Mick Ronson and, later, the letter of correction from Michael 
Beltramo: Ronson didn't play on any Mott the Hoople albums but he did in fact 
join the group in time to play on and produce the last single, "Saturday Gigs." 
He also played guitar on the last Mott tour. I hope this will put both Mott 
informants in the right!

CORPORATE MIND?

Re Claudia Puig's Oct. 8 article, "Music to Someone's Ears": Some of the KKBT 
scenes and executives described by Puig call to mind the cold, efficient 
corporate thinking and fax-minded corporate underlings portrayed in the movie 
"Robocop." (Major chill!) 
</P>
<P>
For myself, it seems this was a good year to leave Los Angeles. Southern 
California's culture peaked with the Dodgers -- the region's last repository of 
higher culture -- winning the '88 Series. Since then, it's been all downhill.

KKBT general manger Jim de Castro is a college-educated anti-intellectual whose 
remarks (and those of his staff) consist of yuppie-oriented non sequiturs and 
reflect a lack of taste. 
</P>
<P>
Equally offensive is De Castro's attitude. He not only feels no remorse in 
having eliminated one of the longest-operating classical radio stations, but he 
actually thinks he has something to offer that the other rock stations don't.

Regarding Axl Rose's racial and anti-gay epithets: I find his homophobia 
remarkable for a man who has borrowed so much attire from gay subculture -- 
leather chaps, biker cap, etc. Maybe this is one reason he has had "very bad 
experiences with homosexuals": They mistake him for one.

Yes, Guns N' Roses' song "One in a Million" uses racist remarks, but it uses 
them to show us how evil racism is! 
</P>
<P>
The song does not reflect the band's opinions; they have explained that in many 
heavy-metal magazines. You have to show the ugliness of hate, just as you must 
show the ugliness of drugs.

Once again a major publication puts out an article about bigoted rock lyrics 
and their inflammatory nature with nary a mention of that old rock 'n' roll 
mainstay: sexism. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, racial slurs are inflammatory, but what do you call it when a bunch of 
stupid boys, both white and black, sing lyrics that degrade women or boast of 
violence against them (Motley Crue and N.W.A)? 
</P>
<P>
Bigotry against women affects over half of the population without regard for 
race, religion or sexual orientation.

REMODELING: AROUND HOME; 
</P>
<P>
TREE TRIMMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOMEOWNERS, when confronted by a tree that needs trimming, usually hire 
whomever gives them the least expensive estimate. They often regret the 
decision. "It isn't easy to find a reliable tree-maintenance service," says 
Alden Kelley, an arborist consultant in Fullerton. "There are no official 
licensing standards for the profession." But, he says, consumers can protect 
themselves by following some guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Tree trimming professionals recommend that homeowners get at least three 
estimates. One should be from a large company with a reputation to protect, and 
one should be a small tradesman or someone who advertises in the local 
newspaper. In all cases, check references, going to recent jobs to check the 
quality of the work. A small number of tree trimmers are certified by the 
International Society of Arboriculture and have to meet high standards to get 
the ISA designation. Finding one of them might be worth the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
A word on insurance: Most large companies carry protection, but many small 
firms and individuals do not. Insist on proof that the tree trimmer has 
workman's compensation and liability. "Get the proof directly from the 
company's insurance carrier," says Robert Kelley (no relation to Alden) of 
Kelley Tree Specialists in Los Angeles. "Ask for a copy of the insurance binder 
-- many people dummy up papers to look legitimate." If a homeowner's insurance 
fully protects them -- against liability, property damage from hired workers 
and injury to those workers -- the homeowner can hire a skilled trimmer who 
does not carry insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The most important thing is trimming skill. "Like a well-styled haircut, a 
properly trimmed tree is not conspicuous," says Alden Kelley. "It should have 
much the same shape as before." Don't take the trimmer's word alone that he is 
good; watch him work, if possible. Certain trees are trimmed with a chain saw, 
but check for bad cuts, rips in the bark and remaining stubs. Other trees need 
fine, or feather, pruning and will be trimmed by handsaw and pruner only; look 
for stubs and tearing of the bark. 
</P>
<P>
Fine pruning requires a light touch -- most trimmers don't have it. A trimmer 
who can fine prune is worth any extra cost. "It's an all-or-nothing type of 
thing," says Alden Kelley. "Invest profitably, or pay 2 to 10 times the actual 
cost in damage. You might save $200 but lower the assessable value of your tree 
by $2,000." 
</P>
<P>
An average minimum figure is about $35 an hour, but most jobs are priced by 
what the market will bear ("You need at least three estimates to get a 
competitive price," Robert Kelley says.) Figure on paying at least $100, with 
no limit on the other end of the scale. People who routinely pay $400 for work 
on their car flinch when asked to pay the same for tree work -- even if that 
tree adds $5,000 to the value of their property. A well-cared-for tree is an 
investment that keeps growing. 
</P>
<P>
 For basic information, contact the City of Los Angeles, Bureau of Street 
Maintenance, Street Tree Division. It also provides information on choosing 
types of trees and where to plant but does not give referrals for tree trimmers 
or companies. 
</P>
<P>

Western Chapter, 232 Archer Way, Nipomo, Calif. 93444.

ISLANDS BRING A REMEDY TO THE TROUBLES OF THE 20TH CENTURY. THIS LUST FOR 
ISLANDS ISSOMEPLACE BETWEEN A HOBBY AND A RELIGION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GOLD, Gold's most recent novel, Dreaming, has just been published in 
paperback by Dell; his new book, Travels in San Francisco, will be published 
this winter by Arcade Publishing-Little, Brown 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some people collect stamps, lovers, money or injustices. I collect islands. 
Islands bring a remedy to the troubles of the 20th Century. This lust for 
islands is someplace between a hobby and a religion. 
</P>
<P>
If an island is too big, it's called a continent and I don't find it so 
congenial. This will not soon happen to Goree, St. Pierre and Miquelon, the 
Seychelles, the Galapagos, Martinique, Tahiti or the pineapple and mojo 
volcanic peaks of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Some islands are at risk. Near offshore islands tend to be corrupted by 
causeways, thereby becoming peninsulas -- mere continental extensions. You have 
to look carefully to notice that the Ile St-Louis in the Seine is not an 
ordinary part of Paris but an island village apart. But when I stay there, I 
find the island temperament intact -- a touch of arrogance, isolation and 
insulation from reality -- all good qualities. Even Belvedere, across the 
Golden Gate Bridge, can do in a pinch, although wilder islands do even better. 
Belvedere, in San Francisco Bay, is not like Mill Valley or Sausalito, and it 
stands proudly aloof from adjacent Tiburon, a mere peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Raised in the Midwest, I discovered islands during adolescence, a time of many 
crucial discoveries (sex might be another). Personally, I was an island in my 
family surrounded by pounding seas of privacy, like any normal teen-ager. 
Graduating from high school, I made an island decision to be alone and discover 
what the devil I was. I ran away from home. I was on my way to an island -- 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
There was this occasional smell of salt that crept over lower Manhattan. It was 
the sea. I stood at the Battery and looked out and suffered deep 17-year-old 
thoughts. It got cold that winter and I moved my forces southward to Florida. 
Leaving that peninsula, U.S. 1 becomes a thin ribbon of road across a long, 
looping, semi-crescent scatter of islands. On one of them -- Pelican's Roost, 
an outcropping just off Key Largo -- I was offered a job and stayed awhile. 
</P>
<P>
Adventure gives islands an appeal, but security and manageable dimensions also 
come with the geography. Spinoza said that freedom consists in knowing what the 
limits are. With an island, the geographical limits are defined by nature. You 
can visit and soon know your way around. 
</P>
<P>
Some islands are large, of course, and if they get too large, they are likely 
to contain distracting museums, cathedrals and historic monuments. Majorca has 
all those menaces to tranquillity, plus something even worse -- many beautiful 
Swedish girls. 
</P>
<P>
Other islands have bloody pasts that they now celebrate in peace. Goree, for 
example, an island in the magnificent broad harbor of Dakar, Senegal, evokes 
enough historical pain to satisfy any connoisseur of misery. It was a departure 
point for slave ships. Its dungeons contain trapdoors at the rear, behind which 
sharks cut back and forth, the descendants of those that once fed on captured 
slaves who were difficult or sick. From this island -- a sort of Ellis Island 
in reverse -- the vessels set sail for the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
I spent a few weeks there, making friends with a French anthropologist who was 
studying the life of the island, surfing, diving and working out his own 
problems in the way of anthropologists, who seem to have more life problems 
than other occupational classifications, including writers. 
</P>
<P>
Besides a small fishing economy, Goree has become a tourist destination for 
groups from the United States seeking their roots. One day I joined a church 
group from Newark, N.J. -- serious, thoughtful senior citizens with an ardent 
younger minister as their guide. He put them in the damp and stony dungeons. He 
urged them to wrap themselves in the chains. "Now, remember!" he called. "Our 
ancestors couldn't just get out when they wanted to. They couldn't just go to 
lunch when they got hungry." 
</P>
<P>
He opened the trapdoor that led to the chute that led to the Atlantic Ocean and 
the sharks. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they were lunch, brothers and sisters." 
</P>
<P>
They could buy souvenir post cards, souvenir chains, souvenir slave clothes -- 
"My Grandmother Went to Goree and All She Bought Me Was This T-shirt" -- but 
despite the Goreeland atmosphere that the dream of profit induced, there was 
something real and touching about the place. I had lunch in a flowered stone 
bower with a French anthropologist, his wife, his present girlfriend and his 
future girlfriend. "There is nothing like this anyplace," I said. 
</P>
<P>
The island nation I dream about nightly is Haiti, which shares Hispaniola with 
the Dominican Republic. The place is in misery now, although the Grand Hotel 
Oloffson is still my favorite hotel in the world. Once I stood on the terrace 
with a retiring U.S. State Department official, looking out into the smoky, 
chicken-calling, drum-filled night of Port-au-Prince, and he said: "I've ruined 
my life here, I've never been so happy. I destroyed my career. It was worth 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The love of islands is almost a religion among island collectors, and Haiti is 
one of the extreme forms of this fanaticism. 
</P>
<P>
With islands, a person knows where he stands. He finds his way around. 
</P>
<P>
St. Pierre and Miquelon are real islands. They lie off Newfoundland, not too 
far from Canada, and they are the only provinces France kept when it was 
expelled from North America. About 1,500 Frenchmen live there, celebrating 
Bastille Day with a 19th-Century ferocity. On the 15th of July there were 
underclothes stuck to the ceilings of the waterfront bars -- almost every bar 
is a waterfront one. Most adult males had bruises, contusions, black eyes. It's 
a proud holiday for these French island dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
In my two weeks there, I ate in every restaurant, drank in every bar and 
visited a lot of vessels. I met artists, politicians, fishermen and bicyclists. 
Two weeks on St. Pierre and Miquelon made me almost a citizen, and if the local 
residents didn't share that opinion, at least they let me live out my delusion. 
When I left, I was leaving my island home. Someone was waving goodby. When I go 
back, and I will, I'll visit my old, dear friends. Island dwellers are of 
interest to me, but the visitor is also of interest to them -- bringer of fresh 
tidings from the continent. Contrary to the experience of some, I find 
islanders hospitable and grateful for strange company. Cynics might assume that 
it is expense accounts that cause this friendliness, but I prefer to ascribe it 
to being a really good listener. Plus maybe buying a round now and then. 
</P>
<P>
y island practice is to walk a lot, hire a bicycle, not carry a camera. There 
is sea air to breath, fauna to observe. Since I speak French, I have developed 
a sub-speciality: French-speaking islands. In addition to having celebrated 
Bastille Day in St. Pierre, I've done so in Martinique and Tahiti. In those 
distant provinces they don't seem to know that Paris no longer becomes a 
village strung with colored lights on the 14th of July, people dancing to the 
music of accordions because tyranny has been abolished. Last year the dancing 
in the streets of Paris was to the rhythms of recorded rock music, or of French 
imitations of English imitations of white American imitations of black American 
music. The cars honked; the air was impure. 
</P>
<P>
But on Moorea, the musette still twangs and hums. And in Martinique, the heroes 
of the French Resistance against the Nazis stand at attention while a prefect 
in blinding whites salutes, jumps into his air-conditioned Peugeot and dashes 
off to a picnic on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
This may not be real life -- really real reality as we know it today -- but it 
keeps up the island tradition of separation from the matter-of-earth world. 
</P>
<P>
I don't limit myself to glamorous, foreign-correspondent, Third World islands. 
I also enjoyed staying in the Kapalua Bay Hotel, a resort on Maui where I 
seemed to be the only guest below the rank of vice president of a major 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Islands concentrate whatever resources are available. On Maui, it's a 
concentration of money, condos and luxury hotels -- and also of dropouts, 
laid-backs and alternate-economy entrepreneurs. I explored both cultures. The 
isolation and concentration of islands makes my nose twitch and my ankles yearn 
to move about. Perhaps that has to do with island metabolism -- the sea on all 
sides and a volcano beneath. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria, the capital of the Seychelles, has a Victorian clock that strikes the 
hour twice, once as a warning and once as an afterthought. The people are a 
mixture of African and Ceylonese, Chinese and Caucasian and are kind and gentle 
and indifferent to the Marxist rhetoric that blasts through the radio. I ate 
fruit bats and fish, swam in the Indian Ocean and saw but one other American 
during the whole time. The Seychelles are exactly halfway around the world from 
California, so you can go either through the Far East and Australia or, as I 
did, through London, Zurich, and Bahrain. An old Scottish seaman, living with 
his wives on the beach, said he came for the spearfishing but that spearfishing 
now is illegal. He stayed because his wives depended on him. I also met a 
German student of Israeli political thought, a young woman who had been given a 
trip to the Seychelles as a goodby present by her lover, a famous Berlin 
publisher. 
</P>
<P>
On islands one meets people one does not normally meet on continents. The 
sunsets are glorious, as are the birds and the fishing. That is the rule. 
Sometimes there are snakes and sometimes not. Any island you propose is one I 
want to visit. I have an affinity. 
</P>
<P>
Being concentrated themselves, islands concentrate the mind. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the earnest part -- Man the Seeker. The magic in islands is more than 
escape, recreation, entertainment. I feel secure on islands. I can sense the 
borders, and the sea is just over there, and I can crisscross, veer about and 
find my way back. I've written novels about two islands, Manhattan and 
Haiti-on-Hispaniola. 
</P>
<P>
Like Captain Cook, I believe that Eden was an island, not a garden. John 
Donne's famous remark is off the mark. "No man is an island, entire of itself" 
No, sir. Every man is an island, and wants it thus. 
</P>
<P>
Oh! It's a snug little island! 
</P>
<P>
A right little, tight little island! 
</P>
<P>
Wordsworth's lines awaken fellow feelings in me. In North America, the 
territory ahead for Mark Twain was in the West when it was surrounded by hope 
and mystery, as if by an ocean. Islands can also be gloomy, sad, foggy, empty 
and representative of our failed yearnings. The loneliest I've ever felt was on 
Naushon Island, off Cape Cod, far from the mainland, with a boat not due for a 
day or so -- an island on which I had broken a tooth and where there was no 
dentist. 
</P>
<P>
Island routines are based on the strict limits of outcropping, seagirt and 
defined. Sometimes, of course, water doesn't organize efficiently, since the 
sea does not have human purposes in mind. It used to be easier to get to Paris 
from Jacmel, Haiti, than it was to get to Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
in roofs, palm trees and iced beverages compose one vision of islands, although 
there are fog-swept volcanic outcroppings in non-tropical waters, too. My 
personal preoccupation is island fever, island eccentricity, sometimes island 
madness. On Galapagos, for example, lived a German doctor, convinced by 
Nietzsche that his mighty will could do anything he chose to do. He pulled all 
his teeth to prove that he could train his gums for chewing purposes. In Haiti, 
I knew Doc Reser, a former Marine sergeant, who called himself the white voodoo 
kind of doctor and specialized in the magic trick of relieving tourists of 
their money. 
</P>
<P>
Islands concentrate possibility. When I was writing about Gauguin in Tahiti, I 
sat near the market in Papeete and watched the granddaughters of the girls he 
painted speeding by on motorbikes. On Moorea, I watched boys leap into a pool, 
grab the tails of sharks and ride them, whipping and spinning, leaping and 
twisting, as the frantic beasts sought to dislodge the kids. 
</P>
<P>
I've already found, many times, the island of my dreams. Surely Samoa will be 
another. An island never looks for a better beachcomber, never says, "I've got 
to fulfill myself." 
</P>
<P>
And so my soul is stirring, my feet are itching . . . .

A VISIT TO MADEWOOD, 'QUEEN OF THE BAYOU' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

As is his routine whenever he is in residence at Madewood Plantation, Keith 
Marshall, impeccably attired, strolls through the antebellum home of an 
evening, announcing to visitors that dinner is being served. In a scene harking 
to an opulent life style in pre-Civil War Louisiana, guests gather as shadows 
dance in the glow of candles and the fragrance of gumbo settles over this 
exquisite room with its period antiques. 
</P>
<P>
The friendly hum of conversation brings alive Madewood like no other antebellum 
home between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Known as the "Queen of the Bayou," 
Madewood is distinguished as a National Historic Landmark and is described as 
the finest Greek Revival mansion in Louisiana -- as well as the friendliest. 
With its Ionic columns, Madewood was the setting for the film "A Woman Called 
Moses," starring Cicely Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
Awakening at Madewood is like discovering oneself on a Southern plantation 
during Louisiana's days of wine and wealth, long before that wealth vanished 
with the ravages of a war that forever changed the course of American history. 
Madewood, along with other plantations -- some spanning thousands of acres -- 
was the focus of a lavish period for the well-to-do. The mistresses of these 
magnificent homes hosted teas and receptions, while the masters of these 
mansions concentrated on the land. 
</P>
<P>
Profits from sugar and cotton were enormous, fortunes that vanished with the 
close of the war. 
</P>
<P>
Once echoing with the voices of prosperous planters, these noble antebellum 
homes in later times sheltered only the ghosts of the departed. Ghosts and 
memories. Lace curtains rotted at the windows. Shutters rattled in breezes 
pouring off the bayous and the Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
Although enemy troops had torched the surrounding land, the plantation was 
spared by a Union general who took pity on a Confederate colonel's widow living 
at Madewood. 
</P>
<P>
The mansion is renowned as an extraordinary monument to the pre-Civil War 
South, with caring owners who have transformed it into one of Louisiana's most 
inviting guest homes. Other antebellum mansions have fared less well. Nottoway 
and Oak Alley are in need of cosmetic face lifts. And nearby Ashland Belle 
Helene is a tragic ghost, shutters peeling, stucco crumbling, floors rotted 
through, a once-proud mansion that stands empty, vandalized, its veranda 
festooned with bee nests, each of its ancient, untrimmed oaks dripping with 
Spanish moss, looking like the hoary figures of a bent old man. 
</P>
<P>
adewood was fortunate in that Naomi Marshall, art patron and spirited mover of 
New Orleans' cultural events, was struck by the mansion's derelict condition. 
Although she has never lived at Madewood, Marshall poured energy and a fortune 
into the transformation of the old home. With a son, Keith, she restored a 
relic that had been abandoned to the elements, its wallpaper stained, its 
window sills rotting, its floors decaying, its plaster peeling, its attic 
crawling with rodents. 
</P>
<P>
Naomi Marshall's late husband didn't share his wife's enthusiasm, insisting 
that he had "never seen anyone work so hard to lose money," alluding to the 
idea that Madewood, which she bought in 1965, was a nuisance and a burden that 
would drain the family fortune. Undaunted, Naomi Marshall and her 41-year-old 
son replumbed, rewired, reroofed and repainted Madewood until today it stands 
as a classic example of a plantation home from the South's golden days. 
</P>
<P>
Its polished floors shone brilliantly one recent afternoon as housekeeper 
Thelma Parker led guests on a tour of the parlor, dining room, library and 
ballroom, pointing out Madewood's marble fireplaces, a set of 18th-Century 
Meisen, an antique piano and organ, along with other priceless pieces gathered 
by Keith Marshall during his student days as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other antebellum mansions with their roped-off rooms and ghostly 
reminders of a period lost in the cobwebs of time, Madewood is alive with soul 
and laughter and hospitality provided by Keith Marshall and his wife, Millie, 
who were married at Madewood in a garden ceremony performed beneath an ancient 
oak named for Millie's grandmother, a ceremony attended by hundreds of 
relatives and friends. Millie Ball Marshall, a writer for the New Orleans 
Times-Picayune, described her magic day in an article for her newspaper: 
</P>
<P>
"It was without a doubt a grand wedding, and when the groom hugged the bride 
after the ceremony, the guests burst into applause. Later, candles set in paper 
bags illuminated the scene and gospel singers standing under a drooping oak 
sang spirituals. Wearing a Victorian dress, I danced to 1940s tunes played by 
the New Leviathen Oriental Fox Trot Orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
Millie recalls how guests tapped their feet to the music while waiting for 
helpings of jambalaya. It was a day that shed its magic in shadows cast by the 
great white mansion and the spread of oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Although less than two hours by car from New Orleans, Madewood is a lifetime 
removed from the manifestations of that city. Madewood rises on a 20-acre 
estate near Napoleonville, facing Bayou Lafourche and with the Mississippi 
River flowing not far away. Its grounds are impeccable, its service without 
fault. Morning arrives with a soft knock on the door and a pot of coffee 
delivered by Thelma Parker, Clem Thomas or Jean-Marie Richard, who do turns as 
chef, manager and tour guides. 
</P>
<P>
One arrives at Madewood as one would to a friend's home, without the formality 
of registering at a reception desk. Nor is it overrun with strangers, although 
small group tours are conducted. Before dinner, guests join their host and 
hostess for wine and cheese and conversation that hums throughout the old 
mansion. 
</P>
<P>
While visiting one afternoon with the Marshalls on Madewood's screened porch, 
we watched clouds gather and the sky darken. Lightning flashed across the 
heavens and the earth shook with thunder as daylight turned to dusk. Just as 
quickly the skies cleared, leaving only wisps of cloud against an incredibly 
blue Louisiana sky. 
</P>
<P>
At Madewood, a handsome walnut staircase leads to guest rooms, one with a 
four-poster and a Persian carpet, a full-length teardrop mirror, ancient 
armoires and fresh flowers. Windows frame sugar cane fields that flow to the 
horizon, and other rooms feature twin brass beds from the Ursuline Convent in 
New Orleans, iron and half testers with feather pillows and down comforters, 
cabinets crowded with books and magazines, and walls that are lined with scenes 
of the early South. Meanwhile, other visitors retreat to a couple of 
19th-Century cottages sheltered by Madewood's magnificent oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Keith and Millie Marshall became innkeepers on impulse while paying bills a few 
years ago. A caller inquired if they could accommodate three couples. Studying 
the check he'd just written for a $450 electric bill, Keith said yes, of 
course. How much, the caller asked? Dividing the electric bill by three, Keith 
came up with a figure of $150 per couple, a rate that remains unchanged today. 
</P>
<P>
Besides accommodations, the price includes breakfast and dinner, wine and 
cheese parties and a belt of brandy at bedtime, making Madewood one of the 
South's outstanding bargains. At dinner- time, Thelma Palmer delivers platters 
of chicken and shrimp pie, gumbo, pumpkin, greens, corn bread, salad and bread 
pudding. Breakfast is a symphony of ham, sausage, eggs, grits, biscuits and 
fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Of a lazy afternoon, guests rock contentedly on the veranda while sipping mint 
juleps and lemonade and studying the cane fields that sweep for miles. 
</P>
<P>
Inside this mansion with its splendors of a past generation, a sense of 
well-being reaches out like the sweet scent of jasmine. Visitors are impressed 
by a staff that swings into action at the slightest urging, a flashback to the 
heady days of the South's prewar wealth. 
</P>
<P>
Once, nearby Bayou Lafourche was navigable for steamboats cruising the 
Mississippi. Showboats plied its waters as well, and the happy melody of 
calliopes drew huge crowds. Slowly, though, the bayou narrowed, and during the 
postwar years Madewood went through a succession of owners. Finally abandoned, 
the mansion stood empty for nearly 20 years until Naomi Marshall took it upon 
herself to restore it to its original splendor. 
</P>
<P>
As Madewood came to life it became the scene of summer concerts, ballet on the 
lawn, symphonies under the oaks and gospel singers who performed in the little 
cemetery where the mansion's first family rests. 
</P>
<P>
Naomi Marshall recalls how during the holidays Chester Freeman, a handyman and 
deacon in the plantation church, recited the story of the birth of the Saviour 
with such simple devotion that "guests were in tears." Then the beloved Freeman 
died. Without him, Marshall confesses, Madewood isn't quite the same at 
Christmastime, although there remains a night of caroling and a roaring fire in 
an open hearth, twigs of holly and magnolia branches tied with red ribbon. 
</P>
<P>
Guests are served cups of wassail, and after dinner the choir retires to the 
staircase to sing "Silent Night." In the ballroom and parlor huge Scotch pines, 
decorated with hand-crocheted ornaments, stretch floor-to-ceiling. Christmas at 
Madewood is special indeed. 
</P>
<P>
To hear Millie Ball Marshall tell it, operating a plantation guest home is hard 
work. "Everyone pictures my husband Keith and me sitting in white rockers on 
the balcony, sipping mint juleps. They envision me whooshing down the grand 
stairway in a long dress and rustling crinolines, chattering to 
elegantly-dressed guests." On the contrary, Millie insists that she and Keith 
are on the run almost constantly. 
</P>
<P>
Those who have slept in Madewood's four-posters and half-testers arrive from 
such far-flung destinations as Britain, Denmark, Sweden, France and India. 
Queen Elizabeth's first cousin was a guest. "Sometimes it's like a house 
party," says Millie, whose mother-in-law, Naomi Marshall, "gives thanks to the 
Lord for giving us the opportunity to renovate Madewood." Naomi Marshall smiles 
reflectively. "Madewood," she says softly, "is only in our care. We never 
really own anything in life, you know." 
</P>
<P>
No telephones, no TV, peaceful moments and the fragrance of new-mown grass. 
This is Madewood. Dating from 1864, it is a masterpiece of understated 
elegance, with windows that frame the oaks and mists that rise from the bayous. 
And always there is a pervading cheerfulness that provides guests with a sense 
of well-being and a feeling of never having left home . . . or perhaps pleased 
that one did. 
</P>
<P>
To visit Madewood: The mansion faces Louisiana 308, 75 miles northwest of New 
Orleans on Bayou Lafourche and 21 miles north of Thibodaux. From New Orleans, 
take Interstate 10 toward Baton Rouge, leave the expressway at Exit 182 and 
cross the Sunshine Bridge to Napoleonville. For other details, write to 
Madewood, Route 2, Box 478, Napoleonville, La. 70390. 
</P>
<P>
As Madewood came to life it became the scene of summer concerts, ballet on the 
lawn, symphonies under the oaks and gospel singers who performed in in the 
little cemetery where the mansion's first family rests

LUNAR HOLIDAY;

EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN BOTH THE AEROSPACE AND TRAVEL INDUSTRIES.

<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIS PLAYER, Player is a former senior vice-president and assistant to the 
chairman of Pan American Airways with duties that included the space program.

<TEXT>
<P>
When we see the Space Shuttle launched, view color images from Neptune or 
listen to tales of space travel, it's a reminder that one day in the 
not-too-distant future we could be taking vacations on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
Does that prospect seem outlandish -- or out-worldish? 
</P>
<P>
If you're a prudent bettor, don't wager against it. Odds are you'll lose, just 
as a half-century ago you'd have lost if you had bet that transoceanic 
vacations would never become commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, it's well within the realm of possibility to create a lunar colony 
and a transportation system to support it. 
</P>
<P>
In science fiction, rockets have been the favorite way to ride the imagination 
to the moon and beyond, although wooden vessels suspended from balloons and 
blown by cosmic winds have had their partisans. 
</P>
<P>
By the late 1940s, engineers, scientists and aerospace executives were starting 
to make serious proposals for real rocket ships and real space cities to be 
served by them. 
</P>
<P>
Today, rocket launchings monopolize space flight, and there are a lot of them; 
in 1988, the Soviet Union alone launched 89 space missions. Rockets that will 
be bigger or better or both are on the way. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the chances are that when you take your holiday on the moon, you'll not be 
borne there on the flame and thunder of a rocket. A better way is being dreamed 
up in labs and workshops around the world -- in Great Britain and the United 
States, in the Soviet Union and Japan. The better way is a moon plane that, 
within Earth's atmosphere, will behave much like the airplanes you ride today. 
</P>
<P>
In appearance the moon plane will combine the familiar with the alien. Its 
shapes and surfaces will be somewhat unfamiliar, but you will be able to 
recognize it as a plane. 
</P>
<P>
Over the objections of today's airmen, it will have no windows, not even a 
windshield. You can have a sturdier, simpler hull, easier to build, if you do 
without them, and for surveillance, electronic scanners and other sensors will 
better serve the purpose. 
</P>
<P>
When you board you'll find no conventional seats. Instead, you'll see what look 
like the progeny of a marriage between a recliner, and, well, a mummy case, one 
for each passenger. Each module will be operable by its occupant as well as by 
the flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to being an unconventional seat (or, at your preference, a bed) 
your moon-flight module will serve as a substitute for the anchor of gravity, 
to keep you from going adrift. It will also be your purveyor of services. 
</P>
<P>
Within your self-contained module you'll access food and drink, manage your 
ambient temperature, operate the built-in sanitary facilities, select a range 
of postures, control your view screen, select entertainment channels and, of 
course, communicate with the cabin crew and with your traveling companions. 
</P>
<P>
You'll go to the moon by plane rather than be lofted by rocket because rockets 
have the oddity that they cannot "breathe" the oxygen in the atmosphere as a 
jet engine can. 
</P>
<P>
So even with oxygen all around them in the atmosphere, they must carry a large 
amount with them to power their ascent. They must stand poised on tiptoe, focus 
their energies beneath them and blast themselves off like controlled bombs. 
Their lift-off is a managed explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Few transportation professionals are content with the prospect of trying to 
offer fare-paying passengers regularly scheduled service aboard that sort of 
volcanic contrivance. 
</P>
<P>
With an air-breathing power plant, the moon plane will make a conventional 
takeoff, gently transferring its load from wheels to wings and then ascending 
at a comfortable gradient through the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
To maneuver in airless space, the plane will use small thrusters similar to 
those on some of today's spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
Once in space you'll not be confined to your module. You'll be encouraged to 
emerge from it to experience the fun of floating with the aid of guidelines and 
handholds and under the tutelage of the flight attendants. With a little 
practice, turning a somersault in mid-nothing will become almost as easy as 
opening and closing your eyes. 
</P>
<P>
But that will be only your second-favorite in-flight entertainment. Your first 
will be watching Earth recede and moon approach on your vision screen. 
</P>
<P>
Long-range scanners will let you glimpse such sights as low-orbit space 
stations or a space tug outbound to retrieve a crippled satellite for repair. 
Generally, though, your flight path will stay well clear of other activities 
and objects. At space speeds, even a collision with an object the size of an 
aspirin tablet could be catastrophic. 
</P>
<P>
Regularly scheduled passenger flights will traverse space ways that are 
cleaned, protected and controlled. That means that the principal space-faring 
nations will have devised an agency to operate space ways and to guard them 
from space litter, of which, believe it or not, there already is a dismally 
large accumulation. 
</P>
<P>
The moon plane will take about 20 hours to reach the orbiting transfer station, 
from which tourists will descend by ferry to the lunar surface. 
</P>
<P>
You will not be dragging along suitcases full of clothes. Weight, energy and 
storage space will not be wasted that way (a concept many a traveler has wished 
could be applied to Earth transportation). You can keep what you wore to the 
moon and wear it back, but on the moon you will wear simple garments of 
space-age fabrics that stay there and are recycled there. 
</P>
<P>
We do not yet know whether there is ice on the moon to convert to water. What 
is certain is that it will be more efficient to convert moon matter for use 
than to transport necessities such as water from Earth. Energy probably will be 
supplied from solar sources. You will inhabit ecosystems that will function 
through recycling and renewal rather than through consumption and replacement. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, they will be small re-creations of our Earth environment, but to 
preserve them we shall have to treat them far more sensibly than we now do 
Earth's environment. In doing so, we will perhaps learn how to treat Earth's 
better, too. 
</P>
<P>
The moon's gravity is about one-sixth that of Earth's. If you can drive a golf 
ball 200 yards on Earth, you'll be dismayed when you hit it quite out of sight 
on a lunar course -- unless you're allowed to use brightly colored, 
basketball-size golf balls. 
</P>
<P>
A golf course on the moon? Maybe, maybe not. But don't forget that in addition 
to its educational and recreational value, moon tourism, like tourism on Earth, 
will be important to economic development. 
</P>
<P>
Moon tourism will be fostered because it will help to pay the expenses of other 
activities, such as the movement of cargo -- supplies outbound and products 
inbound. The vast scale of investment that will be made in tourist plant and 
services on the moon is foreshadowed by those made, for example, in today's 
theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
Moon tourists will have opportunities to observe science experiments, 
manufacturing processes, medical research and the workings of life-support 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
There will be tours of the austere landscape, but the visit that almost 
everyone will want to make will be to the spot where Neil Armstrong and Edwin 
(Buzz) Aldrin in 1969 became the first representatives of the human race to set 
foot on the moon -- and where they left a United States flag to mark the 
occasion. 
</P>
<P>
On some of the excursions tourists will wear spacesuits that will be 
self-contained, single-person mobile habitations. Most excursions, however, 
will be conducted in vehicles with complete life-support systems for groups of 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
But the main attraction will be Earth-viewing, not only for its heart-stopping 
beauty but for the chance to view and learn about our planet in ways never 
before possible. 
</P>
<P>
Today's Space Shuttle must bore a long, super-hot tunnel through the atmosphere 
until the friction of re-entry retards the craft enough to permit a landing. 
The moon plane will make re-entry humdrum, perhaps by using power brakes, 
perhaps by losing energy by skipping, like a stone on a pond, upon the surface 
of the atmosphere. Then its air-breathing engines will let it land just like an 
airplane. 
</P>
<P>
Already, preliminary work is in progress in a number of countries on such a 
moon plane, or at least its forerunner. 
</P>
<P>
The British call their space plane concept HOTOL for Horizontal Take Off and 
Landing. The British government has authorized two companies, British Aerospace 
and Rolls-Royce, to seek an international partnership to turn the concept into 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
The American forerunner is called the X-30 and is funded by the Department of 
Defense, NASA and individual private manufacturers. The Defense Advanced 
Research Projects Agency, which manages the program, says that a prototype 
could fly by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets and, lately, the Japanese -- the latter already having come up with 
artists' renditions of imagined lunar hotels -- also are working toward regular 
moon flights. 
</P>
<P>
To preview that future, think back a moment to the aerial conquest of the 
Pacific. The air space over the Pacific was more mysterious then than cislunar 
space (between Earth and the moon) is now. Flying the Pacific seemed more 
impossible than the project to put humans on the moon later was to appear. 
Newspaper, radio and newsreel accounts of the day reflected amazement, even 
disbelief, that the deed could be done at all. 
</P>
<P>
In less than a lifetime, the impossible became the commonplace. And that's the 
realistic way to look at your own prospects for vacationing on the moon.

SKIING THE WEST

<P>
I hear Little Nell is the place to stay this winter," insists the sleek blonde 
in a shimmering silver ski suit that deflects sun into my eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's the first World Cup race? I need pointers." says the guy on the left 
wearing form-fitting racing pants and a rainbow gold sport shield that protects 
his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife swears she'll try skiing this year. Anyone know a place where we can 
take the kids, get everyone lessons and still afford to eat out?" a third skier 
queries as we slide off the high speed quad chair and prepare to ski downhill. 
</P>
<P>
Ride time at most ski areas isn't simply for heading uphill. It's also for 
comparing lists of what's trendy, what's not, what's new and where should you 
go next. Here's a chairlift-length list of suggestions for the coming season: 
</P>
<P>
Best Bizarre Event: Pack a party lunch and get ready to laugh, if, that is, you 
don't have the stamina to enter the pole, pedal and paddle race April 17 at 
Jackson Hole, Wyo. Contestants in the serious classes ski down the 
4,000-vertical-foot mountain, glide around a 10-kilometer cross-country 
circuit, bike 19.8 miles to the Snake River, then paddle 9 miles to the finish 
line. But anything goes for entrants in the unlimited and fun classes. In past 
years, contestants have been seen biking down the ski slopes and skiing (on 
pontoons shaped like skis) on the river. One year, a group of 15 friends on a 
raft loaded with "refreshments" took first place in a class where the slowest 
entry won. 
</P>
<P>
Trendiest New Digs: Service to make the high prices you'll pay seem like a 
bargain is the goal at these luxurious new hotels. Little Nell is a posh, small 
hotel nudging the gondola at the base of Aspen Mountain, Colo. You'll never see 
your skis unless they're on your feet, because a ski valet will hand them to 
you (freshly waxed) each morning, and take them away each afternoon at the 
door. The hotel's van will take you to Snowmass when you want to go -- forget 
about using public buses. Workaholics can even check out a cellular telephone 
to work out deals while heading up the gondola. (And get a copy of the signed 
contract via the fax machine at the top of the lift.) You get the drift. 
</P>
<P>
The 350-bed Chateau Whistler is at the base of two fabulous ski mountains -- 
Whistler and Blackcomb in British Columbia -- and recently was rated No. 1 by 
writers and readers in Ski magazine's survey of North America's top resorts. 
</P>
<P>
When guests enter the new Hyatt at Beaver Creek, Colo., they get special 
slippers to use while their ski boots are warmed and dried. And that's just a 
sample of the pampering promised at this large hotel opening this season at the 
base of the main lifts at Beaver Creek. 
</P>
<P>
Best Place for Personal Pampering: The Lodge at Cordillera, a posh 
European-style auberge in Edwards, Colo., with a 21st-Century health club, runs 
one-day programs during which you will be exercised, pampered and treated to a 
spa lunch from the kitchen of Belgian executive chef Philippe Van Cappellen, 
who owns a Michelin-rated restaurant. The $145 day includes the chance to sweat 
in exercise classes, or on the cross-country trails threading this isolated 
mountaintop, followed by an aqua-aerobic class and an easy stretch class. Once 
your body is worn down, specialists will revive you with a massage, your choice 
of a facial or a hydro-tub treatment, and a variety of other beauty treatments. 
Transportation from Vail and Beaver Creek, 20 minutes away, can be arranged. If 
you couldn't care less about being at the slopes when the lifts open, book one 
of the wonderful lodge rooms. 
</P>
<P>
The Season's Glitziest Party: At this celebrity round-up, the wealthy and 
famous will mush dog sleds, tangle with slalom gates and totter around 
Alberta's spectacularly scenic Lake Louise on skinny cross-country skis. But 
the real race, during the 100th anniversary of the fabled Chateau Lake Louise, 
Jan. 18-21, will be for space on the masseuses' time sheet. While you're in 
Canada's Banff National Park, ski at Lake Louise Ski Area, which stretches over 
two mountains, and at nearby Sunshine Village, perched on the edge of the 
Continental Divide. 
</P>
<P>
Best Case of the Blues: Mellow sounds, laced with free-floating riffs, waft 
from the Thunderbird Lodge in Taos Ski Valley, N.M., during the Eighth Annual 
Jazz Legends sessions. Two jams nightly feature traditional jazz, Jan. 2-10 and 
Jan. 12-17. (Reserve early. Sessions sell out and preference and discounts go 
to lodge and dinner guests. Skiers who want to enter Taos' ski school weeks 
stay in the tiny valley. The less fanatic lodge in Taos, 20 minutes away. 
</P>
<P>
Finest Bargain for Novices: Crested Butte, Colo., will offer free lessons, 
lifts and rentals to first-timers, Nov. 27 through Dec. 15. For your entire 
stay, not just the first day. Companions also get a break: $10 lift tickets, 
plus half-price lessons and rentals. Lodging rates are $25-$30 per person, per 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Best Commoner's Bash: Oom-pah-pah music overlays the laughter of imbibers in 
the Bavarian Beverage Gardens at the annual Hof Winter Carnival in Ogden, Utah, 
Jan. 26-28. This Oktoberfest-style festival was created to salute Ogden's 
sister city of Hof, Germany. The street festival includes ski races on the 
snow-covered main street, parades and a cross-country progressive dinner. Ogden 
anchors the region's three ski areas: SnowBasin, Powder Mountain and Nordic 
Valley; and it's an easy drive from Snowbird, Alta, Park City and Deer Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Best Beach Bash: Arapahoe Basin's Memorial Day "Beachin' at the Basin" party 
promises beer, bikinis and bumps so soft they disintegrate when you bash 'em. 
Seasoned beach bums ski in the morning, then park on deck chairs around the 
mid-mountain barbecue grill and rate spectacular crashes and bronzing bodies. 
Of course, you'll stay at Keystone Resort, opening up all the activities in 
Colorado's Summit County. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Bet for Timid Women Skiers: Some women learn best in a pressure-free 
atmosphere (translate that as without spouses or male friends offering 
"friendly" advice). The three-to five-day women's ski seminars offer an 
opportunity to improve skills while skiing with women who applaud when you link 
a great set of turns and show compassion when you throw a yard sale, sending 
skis, poles, goggles and gloves to the wind. Female instructors are trained to 
bring out your best efforts and deal with your inner fears about the sport. 
Aspen, Snowmass, Copper and Telluride in Colorado, and Squaw Valley, Calif., 
all run programs. Women who want to try heli-skiing should contact Canadian 
Mountain Holidays about women's heli-ski week in the Bobbie Burns region of the 
Canadian Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
Best Racer-Chaser Events: You can try Park City, Utah's two new chairlifts, 
while the racer-chaser in your group watches America's opening World Cup races. 
The men's and women's slalom and giant slalom races are scheduled for Nov. 
23-26. 
</P>
<P>
Steamboat, Colo., is planning a Western welcome to recreational skiers coming 
to watch the season's first women's downhill World Cup Race, at the Subaru USA 
Ski Town Classic, Dec. 9-10. (Ask about VIP status packages.) 
</P>
<P>
Best of the Serious Amateur Competitions: The Skimeister of the Year title goes 
to the winner of a grueling combination of Nordic and alpine races at Sun 
Valley's Skimeister Centennial Championships, in Sun Valley, Ida., Feb. 1-3. 
Scheduled are competition classes for ski areas, states and nations; an elite 
class for pros and high-level amateurs, and a class for Idaho residents.

MEANWHILE IN CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT SIMS, Sims has covered skiing for 35 years and is a Western regional 
correspondent for Skiing magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California has historically bred superlatives, so it's no surprise that they 
can be applied to the latest in the Far West world of skiing, too. 
</P>
<P>
For openers, Squaw Valley, celebrating its 40th anniversary (and the 30th 
anniversary of the Olympic Winter Games held there), now has the largest number 
of ski lifts -- 32 -- of any resort in the Western Hemisphere. It also has the 
greatest uphill capacity, and can deliver 47,370 skiers an hour onto the high 
ground. That should "un-wait" a lot of lift lines. 
</P>
<P>
One of its five new chairlifts (two were replacements) is the Squaw Peak 
Express, a detachable quad 7,618-feet long that will rise 2,000 feet and carry 
3,040 skiers an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Squaw Valley is not California's lone flag-bearer. As a matter of fact, the 
second-largest lift network, at Mammoth Mountain (30 lifts, 43,000 rides an 
hour), and the third, Heavenly Valley (24 lifts, 31,000 an hour) maintain 
California's superlative hemispherical lead. 
</P>
<P>
Such pace setting tells the world the Golden State is a skiing state despite 
all its other attractions. And nowhere else does such a mix of choices await a 
snow-going visitor. 
</P>
<P>
From Lake Tahoe's ring of playgrounds and night excitement to Southern 
California's ski-and-surf-same-day possibilities; from Royal Gorge (North 
America's largest cross-country destination resort) and Yosemite's quiet 
grandeur to the close-to-100-m.p.h. night speed-skiing at Snow Valley and the 
half-pipe snow boarders at June Mountain and Snow Summit; from the gentle ski 
school spawning grounds that induce beginners to stay in the sport to the 
extreme steeps that magnetize the most daring, the sporting challenge and the 
pursuit of pleasure lead to the sale of some 7-million lift tickets a year. 
</P>
<P>
That figure, according to the California Ski Industry Assn., is second only to 
Colorado, which has some 50 fewer lifts. 
</P>
<P>
Squaw Valley, with its $15-million expenditure last summer and a groaning 
drawing board of projects, isn't the only ski area with new toys. Southern 
California this season gets its first high-speed detachable quad -- the 
state-of-the-art in chairlifts -- with a $2.5 million Doppelmayr shuttle at 
Mountain High East. Compared with old Chair 7, it will carry four times as many 
riders from the bottom to the top in less than half the time. 
</P>
<P>
Northstar-at-Tahoe is getting two of these. Alpine Meadows and Sierra Ski Ranch 
each are getting one. Mammoth Mountain, which focused this year on trail 
upgrades, has emplaced five quads in its $40-million expansion program 
(including the purchase of June Mountain) of the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
Resort retailers love the high-speed quads. Often by mid-afternoon the skiers 
are so burned out that they spend their remaining energies shopping. 
</P>
<P>
Growth can come in several forms. For example, while Bear Mountain, at Big Bear 
Lake, has made pronounced improvements in its Learn-to-Ski Center and in trail 
design, one of its major thrusts is to train the visitor. A free Ski Evaluation 
program will have an instructor videotaping skiers, then critiquing the 
immediate on-screen "replay" and issuing a card rating the performance. This 
can be an introduction to a $17, 45-minute tips class limited to three students 
per instructor. Also, Bear Mountain will be the pilot area for a video 
presentation to lift lines, covering updates on conditions and a vast array of 
educational topics related to skiing. 
</P>
<P>
Snow Summit, confident that it can provide a good experience, continues its 
"Skier Satisfaction" guarantee. Anyone unhappy after one run -- for any reason, 
from conditions to a hangover -- may exchange the lift ticket for a voucher 
good for another visit. Other Snow Summit innovations include considerably 
increasing the size of the beginners' area, storing repeat rental customers' 
statistics in computers for quick access, and establishing a parents' "hot 
line" to the expanded day-care center from two chairlift locations. 
</P>
<P>
Snow Valley is launching a Midweek Club that offers members free lessons, free 
rentals, ski shop discounts and other privileges during the week (except on 
holidays) all season long for a one-time fee of $5. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how good the facilities and the service, however, the vital 
ingredient is snow. Good natural snowfalls mean big crowds in California. In 
the last several years, though, the science of snow-making has made the 
presence of carpet almost a certainty. For example, in nine of the last 10 
years, Snow Summit, Snow Valley and Goldmine (now Bear Mountain) have opened 
the weekend before Thanksgiving, whether or not natural snow had been 
sufficient to cover the runs. 
</P>
<P>
A leader in this field is Heavenly Valley, which has the world's largest 
snow-making system coating great sections of its 12,800 acres. Now, the 
capacity has been increased, and Heavenly Valley can offer skiing off all its 
lifts on the California side, as well as off five lifts on the Nevada side, 
without natural snow. 
</P>
<P>
To sum it up, it isn't difficult to find an adjective to describe California's 
skiing resources. 
</P>
<P>
Superlative.

WHAT IS IMPORTANT WITH TRAVEL PICTURES IS NOT ONLY TO SHOW WHAT IS THERE BUT TO 
GIVE YOUR VIEWERS A FEELING OF BEING THERE, A SAMPLE OF WHAT YOU SAW, WHAT 
STRUCK YOUR FANCY ANDHOW YOU REACTED TO IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEFFINGWELL, Leffingwell is a Times staff photographer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-some years ago when I first traveled to Europe, I had a new camera, a 
gift from a generous grandmother. My head was full of Ingmar Bergman and 
Federico Fellini film images, because their works were my visual influence. 
</P>
<P>
My father watched in disbelief as I shot one odd, obscure, artsy photograph 
after another. One day he reminded me that I had promised to show my 
grandmother my photos, and that she might not recognize a cat curled in sleep 
against a window ledge as being a uniquely Dutch cat on a distinctly Amsterdam 
window ledge next to a canal. 
</P>
<P>
Annoyed but properly warned, I started shooting pictures a little less 
"artistic," a little more "post card-like." Those shots showed the scenes, but 
they showed more than that. Years, and many travels later, that humbling photo 
lesson of the '60s still holds. 
</P>
<P>
What is important with travel pictures is not only to show what is there but to 
give your viewers a sense of being there, a sample of what you saw, what struck 
your fancy and how you reacted to it. The best photographs should make you want 
to get into the next plane, train or automobile and head to that spot to see it 
for yourself. 
</P>
<P>
Shoot the general views, the "post card" pictures, but don't stop there. Walk 
into your post card and find what it is that catches your eye and your 
interest. It is these little details, the small things, that give your viewers 
the sense of the place. Shoot the canals of Amsterdam, and keep your eyes 
peeled for cats asleep in the windows. Notice how the old window glass ripples 
(the effect of hand-rolled glass made long ago) and how those ripples make 
interesting distorted reflections of the view across the canal. Then look 
across the canal and notice the buildings mirrored in the water. 
</P>
<P>
But it only begins there. If you're fortunate enough to stay in any one place 
for more than a day, pay attention to the light. Notice the way everything 
looks when you leave your hotel in the morning, and how it's different when you 
come back to drop off packages at lunch and again when you return before dinner 
at dusk. As the sun moves across the sky, it dramatically changes the way 
scenes look, starting cool and austere in the morning, changing to hard, brutal 
and direct at noon, and becoming warm and flattering in late afternoon. Even 
rain has an exciting effect; don't forget the camera on those days. Streets 
shine in the rain, and electric lights inside stores and homes look warm and 
inviting to the eye -- and even more so on film. 
</P>
<P>
Unless you are interested only in architectural studies, don't exclude people 
from your pictures. Years later you can look at the photos and marvel at the 
clothing styles, but more immediately people serve to give the picture a sense 
of scale. 
</P>
<P>
As they move through your picture, people often become additional design and 
composition elements as you shoot at one instant or another, waiting a moment 
for them to walk across the street or piazza, balancing the composition against 
some other element in your shot. 
</P>
<P>
Wherever I stay, I try to get a room high up in the hotel or inn, with a view 
of the street or square below. I love to eavesdrop on the world from up high 
and shoot down on the patterns of traffic in the street. Dawn and dusk shots 
are more interesting, too, when you can see up or down the street, catching the 
street lights and store signs at the last light of day. Sometimes you can 
literally eavesdrop on the rooftops and residents' lives as they tend their 
gardens or their laundry. It all gives a flavor of what life is like, a sense 
of the place. 
</P>
<P>
If you have access to a darkroom, try shooting print film, especially 
black-and-white. For me, the feeling of a place often comes across more clearly 
when the distraction of color is removed. And some of the travels I treasure 
most have been the six- or eight-hour trips spent in the darkroom working on 
the prints weeks after I've returned.

'A TRAVEL BOOK HAS THE CAPACITY TO EXPRESS A COUNTRY'S HEART -- AND PERHAPS THE 
HEART OF THE TRAVELER TOO -- BUT ONLY . . . AS LONG AS IT CONCENTRATES ON 
PEOPLE IN THEIR LANDSCAPE, AND IT INCLUDES THE DISCOMFORTS AS WELL AS THE 
PLEASURES, THE DISSONANCE AS WELL AS THE MELODIES, THE CONTRADICTIONS AND THE 
VIVID TRIVIA.' -- PAUL THEROUX; 
</P>
<P>
'TO TELL THE TRUTH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, Jones is an associate editor of Traveling in Style. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since childhood, when I lived within earshot of the Boston &amp; Maine, I 
have seldom heard a train go by and not wished I was on it." 
</P>
<P>
With that single opening sentence, written more than 14 years ago, Paul Theroux 
dramatically changed not only the course of his own career but perhaps the 
direction of American travel literature. 
</P>
<P>
The lonely whistle that he heard as a boy in his hometown of Medford, Mass., 
echoed down the years and eventually led to "The Great Railway Bazaar," 
Theroux's 1975 tale of a rail journey through Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Theroux has interspersed his novels with five other travel books, 
most recently 1988's "Riding the Iron Rooster," a revealing account of the 12 
months he spent exploring China by train. Reading the book today, backlighted 
-- figuratively speaking -- by the fires of Tian An Men Square, it is 
astonishing to realize how on target Theroux was in capturing the mood of the 
country. The seeds of the coming upheaval are scattered throughout its pages. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, in an article he wrote for the New York Times, Theroux 
described how "Riding the Iron Rooster" had caused him to re-evaluate what it 
means to write about travel. 
</P>
<P>
"The job of the travel writer," he wrote, "is to go far and wide, to make 
voluminous notes, to tell the truth. There is immense drudgery in the job. But 
the book ought to live, and if it is truthful, it ought to be prescient without 
making predictions. 
</P>
<P>
". . . A great novel may express the soul of a country. A travel book has the 
capacity to express a country's heart -- and perhaps the heart of the traveler, 
too -- but only as long as it stays away from vacations, holidays, sightseeing 
and the half-truths in official handouts; as long as it concentrates on people 
in their landscape, and it includes the discomforts as well as the pleasures, 
the dissonance as well as the melodies, the contradictions and the vivid 
trivia. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Theroux expanded on this theme during a recent interview in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Question: If you were to meet yourself on one of your rail journeys, how would 
you describe yourself? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: It depends on the trip. On a lot of them I would be a very, very 
watchful person in a rather inconspicuous place. I would be the man in a corner 
seat, by the window, with something in his lap -- maybe a book, maybe a 
notebook. You wouldn't be able to know what it was. 
</P>
<P>
I would not initially be talking to anyone. I'd be very watchful. I would be 
looking out the window, and then when someone got on the train, I'd be looking 
at the person. If someone sat next to me and I began talking to him and the 
person wasn't particularly interesting, I would probably make my excuses and 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, I would look like someone at work but not obviously at work. 
Maybe you would mistake me for a Jehovah's Witness or an insurance salesman or 
a CIA agent or someone from the embassy. You wouldn't say 'this guy's a 
tourist' or 'this guy is on a package tour.' 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you have a definition for travel? 
</P>
<P>
A: It means leaving home, with all that that implies. It means leaving home and 
knowing that you're leaving home and not expecting necessarily to find a 
version of home where you're going. It's getting away. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving home can also be going down the street. It can be just taking a tent 
and going a mile away and pitching it if you're doing what Thoreau did at 
Walden Pond. And it can also mean going to Arabia, the Andes, the Himalayas or 
the Arctic. It's getting away. And I think it has something to do with being 
solitary. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Norman Lewis once wrote that for him "travel came before writing" and that 
there was a time when all he wanted from life was "to remain a perpetual 
spectator of changing scenes." Which came first for you, the love of travel or 
love of language? 
</P>
<P>
A: It's a tough one, which came first? Certainly the desire to get away, to 
leave home, was very, very strong in me because I came from a large family, I 
came from a family of seven children. And although I was very secure in the 
family, I wanted to make my mark. It's a combined thing. One is going away and 
the other is proving that you're not escaping, that you're not just running 
away. That you're going away to do something. 
</P>
<P>
So I think the idea of travel is bound up with the idea of writing. I could 
never justify going away without turning it into something. And although that 
sounds like rationalization, it's actually the way I felt. 
</P>
<P>
I used to want to be a doctor, and in fact I was a pre-med student. I used to 
think, 'I'll be a doctor of tropical medicine,' but only because I thought that 
was a good way of justifying going to the tropics. I come from a very 
puritanical household where travel for its own sake would not have been 
accepted. So it was very much (a case of) having to justify it. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Lewis also said that for him travel was "an addiction." Is it for you? 
</P>
<P>
A: No, I don't think so. I'm being perfectly honest with you. I don't think it 
is. The more you travel, the more you realize how much trouble it is. How much 
travel is bound up with delay, with nuisance, with discomfort, with expense and 
with places that have been completely spoiled. 
</P>
<P>
You go to what you consider to be a distant, romantic place and it turns out 
that it's a place that's been invaded and violated. So there's a lot of 
disappointment in travel, and if it's an addiction, then it's a sort of sick 
addiction. 
</P>
<P>
My addiction, my obsession, let's say, is with snooping. I have a deeply nosy 
nature. . . . When I was in England I used to egg people on to show me the 
family album. I love looking at family albums. If they had books, I used to 
note the titles. I used to look in drawers. In China, when people would open a 
handbag, I would look in. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it's a terrible thing to admit. I'm not necessarily proud of it, but 
I'm saying that my real obsession is with searching things out, with looking, 
and not necessarily with travel. It's to go to a place and find the secret life 
of a place, to look more deeply into a place. 
</P>
<P>
"I also have -- it's not an obsession and it's not an addiction -- but I have a 
Boy Scout mentality. I love self-sufficiency. I like camping, I like making 
things, I like the idea living off the land, catching fish, paddling a canoe, 
cooking over a fire. I love it. One of the problems in the United States is 
that a lot of campsites are just filled with other tents, but the idea of doing 
it alone is something I'm very, very interested in. 
</P>
<P>
Q: V. S. Naipaul said that travel was "a necessary stimulus" for him because it 
made unsuspecting demands on him as a person and as a writer. How important has 
travel been to your development in that light? 
</P>
<P>
A: I certainly wouldn't have been the person that I am if I had stayed where I 
was born. If I had stayed in the town where I grew up, I probably wouldn't have 
become a writer. I would have been very frustrated, too. 
</P>
<P>
So a combination of the writing and the traveling has made me very happy. I've 
found it very, very fulfilling. I'm not boasting and I'm not gloating, but I 
know that I needed to get away. 
</P>
<P>
Q: It's become a way of life for you now? 
</P>
<P>
A: In a way, yes. But I think that now the idea of long, very arduous trips is 
not one that appeals to me. If you go to Hawaii, for example, and you see how 
many empty, very, very pretty places there are there, you begin to think that 
someone like Robert Louis Stevenson probably had the right idea. I mean he 
spent the very early part of his life searching, looking. He went everywhere. 
He crossed the United States, sailed to Australia. But then he found the right 
island and he never really traveled much after that. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know if I'm going to do the same thing, but it's something that 
appeals. Certainly, flying to New York or going to Europe or heading for Brazil 
or whatever doesn't have as much appeal as perhaps finding a beautiful place 
and staying there and being happy. 
</P>
<P>
I don't even know what would happen to my writing. I was driven, I think, in my 
early life to write. I used to think about it all the time. I published my 
first book in '66 and I've published 28 books. That's an awful lot of work to 
do. Again, that's not a boast but it's a comment on how I was very 
single-minded. 
</P>
<P>
I don't feel single-minded any more. For example, I was asked to write an 
article a few weeks ago. I didn't find the deadline congenial, and I went off 
and was practicing Eskimo rolling with a kayak. I got much more satisfaction 
doing Eskimo rolling than I would have writing that article. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In "Riding the Iron Rooster" you wrote that "one of the pleasures of travel 
is being anonymous." 
</P>
<P>
A: That's definitely true. If you're conspicuous and people keep noticing you, 
they're responding to you and you're not seeing them. The traveler shouldn't 
become the focus of anyone's interest. He should be invisible, ideally. 
Particularly if he or she is going to write about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You also wrote: "When I travel, I dream a great deal. Perhaps that is one 
of my main reasons for travel." Does that have to do with creativity? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, I think it has to do with not sleeping in your own bed. It has to do 
with the motion of travel. I dream a lot on trains. Because of the motion, 
you're constantly waking. And when you're suddenly awakened, you're aware that 
you've been dreaming. If you've had a long good night's sleep, you're not 
always aware of it. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, I don't sleep as well if I'm on a train or on a trip and in some 
strange bed. I think you're more aware of your dreams. All your secret life is 
in your dreams, all your desires. You begin to see what they are; you begin to 
understand them better. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You wrote that: "Sightseeing is one of the doubtful aspects of travel." 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, I think it is. I think sightseeing is like if you go to a person's 
house, a very interesting house, and they say, 'You must see our collection of 
porcelain frogs.' So you sit down and they show you their porcelain frogs. And 
they say, 'Have you seen the bathroom? Doris just had it retiled.' And you see 
lovely tiles. 
</P>
<P>
It (sightseeing) is like being taken through someone's house. It's not like 
opening drawers, or going to the attic, or going to the cellar, or going into 
closets. It's like being taken through and shown things. So it's a highly 
selective and not-always-revealing and not-always-very satisfying way of seeing 
a country. 
</P>
<P>
Also -- and maybe it's just me -- most sights that you're taken to see strike 
me as being fake. I don't know why -- maybe I'm cynical -- but they always look 
fake to me. The Taj Mahal's not a fake. I have a feeling that the Pyramids are 
not a fake. The Eiffel Tower's not a fake. But in China, lots of parts of 
India, and in South America, I don't know. You're taken to see something, and 
they say, 'This is a very old temple,' and it looks as if it's been repainted, 
regilded. And you say, 'Well, what about the Cultural Revolution?' and they 
say, 'Oh, yes, it was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.' So what are 
you looking at? 
</P>
<P>
Q: You hold tourists in commendable disregard, almost contempt, I think. For 
example, when talking about the Great Wall you compared them to "fleas on the 
back of a dead snake." Is there any hope for tourists at all? In other words, 
can they be turned into travelers? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, there is hope for them. Don't write them off. I think that to a large 
extent tourists have a bad rap. Maybe they have a bad rap from me, I don't 
know. They're doing the best they can. It's in the interests of travel 
companies to get money out of them. The way you get money out of people is by 
controlling them. You ship them in on a plane, put them in an expensive hotel, 
prevent them from wandering away; you put them on a bus, take them to the 
museum, then take them to a few sights. Then you take them to a shopping 
center, and, because you're a national tour guide and you perhaps get a cut, 
you take them to this curio shop or that one. 
</P>
<P>
They're the tools. They're being used by the people who are running the 
industry. Then you put them back on the bus and you ship them away and you get 
a new shipment in. 
</P>
<P>
No country likes the independent traveler. An independent traveler is not a 
person who's going to buy a lot of stuff in the country. He or she is going to 
be wandering around, not spending a lot of money. It's a very inconvenient 
thing to have. No one likes them. They're definitely dangerous because they 
meet people, they ask questions, they're in the way, they're uncontrollable. 
</P>
<P>
Most governments want to control the tourist population. So I think that 
tourists do the best they can. They're not allowed to do very much. 
</P>
<P>
Q: It was (Aldous) Huxley, I believe, who said that "Tourists are, in the main, 
a very gloomy looking tribe . . . one wonders why they came abroad." 
</P>
<P>
A: I think it's true. First, they're very tired because they're being shuttled 
around; they're not keeping their own hours. They're treated like sheep. It's 
unfortunate. I hate to be in a position of bad-mouthing tourists. They get a 
lot of criticism, but I've come to believe that they can't help it. 
</P>
<P>
There's also a question of time. In order to see a country well, you need time. 
A tourist never has time. I don't have a job, so that's why I don't like to be 
in the position of being too contemptuous of people who don't have the time to 
do it. They might have three weeks vacation a year and they're doing the best 
they can. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Naipaul said that travel and the decisions made during a journey can be "as 
creative and imaginative a procedure" as the writing that comes later. Do you 
agree with that? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think that's true. In order to take a worthwhile journey you have to 
devise an itinerary, and devising an itinerary is a highly creative thing. 
You're dealing with maps; I read books about places and try to figure out the 
most revealing route through a particular place. It's not just asking people, 
'Where do you think I should go?' Which is what a lot of people do. 
</P>
<P>
They say, 'Do you know any people in Port Moresby?' and they make a list of 
people and then they fly to Port Moresby and they visit them and say, 'Where do 
you think I should go?' And the person says, 'Well, I'm going to the jungle 
tomorrow, do you want to come with me?' 
</P>
<P>
A lot of books are like that: I met old so and so and he said 'I'm going to the 
highlands to see a circumcision ceremony.' 'Oh, that's a good idea.' And you go 
along. 
</P>
<P>
I would like not to depend on local people but to look at a map and say, 
'Here's a river. This river seems to connect to that river, which connects with 
a railway that goes over the mountains. I think I'll make that little 
connection.' You look at it on the map and it looks feasible. Sometimes you get 
there and you do it. And people say, 'Gosh, I never thought of doing that. No 
one's done that lately.' 
</P>
<P>
Q: Graham Greene, in a preface to a later edition of "Journey Without Maps," 
wrote: "I can now look back with a certain regret at the hard words I used 
about Freetown." Have you experienced the same misgivings yet regarding places 
you've written about? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, lots of them. But I think that when I've had hard words to say about a 
place, I was being as truthful as possible to what my feelings were at the 
time. A travel book has to be personal and partisan. You're not writing a 
geography book. This is not for sixth graders to find out about the rainfall in 
the Andes. It's your own response to a trip; no other book will be like it. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How would you distinguish between travel literature and travel writing? I 
mean, what makes a travel book suddenly become a literary work. It's a 
difficult question, I know . . . 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 A: It is, but I think you could ask the same question about the novel. Will 
Stephen King's books be read 50 years from now or 100 years from now? There 
were many people who were writing very, very popular books in the 19th Century 
at the time Dickens was writing, and we don't know their names. Their books 
have long since been put at the bottom of parrot cages. 
</P>
<P>
Q: But there is such a thing as travel literature as opposed to travel writing? 
People are still reading (Charles M.) Doughty or (H. M.) Tomlinson or (Norman) 
Douglas or Fleming now, to a certain extent anyway. 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, but I think that when they came out -- and the same with (Evelyn) Waugh 
-- they were reviewed simply as travel books. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What sort of relationship do you have with some of the other authors writing 
in the same field today -- Jonathon Raban, Redmond O'Hanlon, and so on. Are you 
close to them? Do you have any feelings about them and what they're writing? 
</P>
<P>
A: Living in London, I see these people quite a lot. And they're all doing 
something different. O'Hanlon genuinely likes to travel and is an adventurous 
spirit. Raban hates traveling but likes writing, he's much more of a writer. 
He's sort of looking for a subject; O'Hanlon's looking for trouble. There are a 
lot of women who are very, very good travelers -- Dervla Murphy and Christina 
Dodwell, for example -- but they're not particularly good writers. I don't read 
them (other travel writer) for the same reason that I don't read novels, or 
don't keep up with novels: It's very distracting to be too aware or too 
self-conscious of what your contemporaries are doing. 
</P>
<P>
Q: But as a group, do you think they're as strong now as, say, the Waughs and 
the Greenes were in the '30s, or the Tomlinsons and Douglases earlier on? I 
mean is the genre itself just as strong as it was? 
</P>
<P>
A: It's a good question, but it's a very tough one to answer because you'd have 
to think of the (individual) books. The books of the '30s, for example. Three 
of Evelyn Waugh's travel books are wonderful. Graham Greene's two, on Africa 
and on Mexico, are very good. Peter Fleming's are slightly facetious. 
"Brazilian Adventure" and "Travels in Tartary" are very, very good. Robert 
Byron. There are lots of very good ones. 
</P>
<P>
But the thing is, it's not a competition. It was a different world and it's not 
competitive. Only time will tell if the people who are writing now are writing 
anything of value. But it's a combination of two things: where these people 
went and how it was written about. Is it funny? Is it alive?

STUPID ADVERTISING IS NO LONGER THE EXCEPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a retired advertising agency executive, I found the article ("Tacky Ads: A 
Low Road to Attention," Sept. 5) only scratched the surface of the growing 
amount of stupid advertising being thrown at the public. 
</P>
<P>
One area alone -- automobile promotion -- is a disgrace. Cars jump across 
creeks with wheels and doors falling off then get back in place while some 
squirt babbles about the qualities of the car. Cars dash through dust storms so 
dense that the car can hardly be seen. As many as a dozen adults and children 
get out of a car then back into it. A line of cars, bumper to bumper, race 
around turns, sometimes on the wrong side of the road. What they are trying to 
prove is beyond me. 
</P>
<P>
If there was a prize for wasting the most amount of advertising money it would 
be hard to decide which agency or client should receive it. Thank goodness I am 
no longer in the business. And I am ashamed to admit that I ever was, based on 
what is currently being produced. 
</P>
<P>
Why don't you blast these upstart "advertising geniuses" and urge that they go 
back to kindergarten before they totally ruin what used to be a respectable 
business?

ROGER SIMON: SOVIETS' ALIEN DELUSIONS SURFACE IN NUCLEAR AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I knew it would happen sooner or later. What with all the stories about how the 
Soviet Union is a better and better place, I knew it was inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
After decades of hating the Soviets, we now like them. And this is fine with 
me. I have read and I believe all the stories telling me how the Russians are 
just as nice as Americans, just as warm as Americans and just as decent as 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
And now, the final step: 
</P>
<P>
It turns out Russians are just as dopey as Americans, too. 
</P>
<P>
You've heard of glasnost? 
</P>
<P>
This is nutnost. 
</P>
<P>
The story broke last week. The Soviet news agency Tass reported that gigantic 
"humanlike" creatures and a tiny robot had emerged from a huge "banana-shaped" 
UFO to land in the Soviet city of Voronezh, 300 miles south of Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The UFO hovered over a park and then descended. The aliens, who were 10 feet 
tall and had three eyes, were clad in silvery coveralls and boots the color of 
bronze. 
</P>
<P>
Just another loony UFO story, you say? Exactly the point. Tass does not report 
loony UFO stories. 
</P>
<P>
Tass' idea of a wild story is tractor production in Minsk and the International 
Conference on Hydroelectric Power in Pinsk. 
</P>
<P>
Tass is the official mouthpiece of the Soviet government and never before has 
been confused with a supermarket tabloid. 
</P>
<P>
But under Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Union has entered into a new era. And 
now the Soviets want to prove they can be goofy, too. 
</P>
<P>
Tass reported that there were numerous witnesses to the alien landing and that 
"onlookers were overwhelmed with a fear that lasted for several days." 
</P>
<P>
At first, the story upset me. That's because it shattered my long-held theory 
about UFOs: Even though space aliens are supposed to be much smarter than 
Earthlings, they always pick extremely stupid places to land. 
</P>
<P>
They never land in front of the White House, for instance, or on the quadrangle 
at MIT or even in a shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
No, they always land in obscure places like the swamps of Georgia where Luke 
and Duke Dweeb are out in a flat boat fishing for engine blocks. And Luke goes 
on local TV and says, "Yup, they was big and green and offered to take us back 
to mate with their women and start a master race." 
</P>
<P>
"But we said no," Duke says, "because we didn't want to miss the next episode 
of 'Chicken Soup.' " 
</P>
<P>
But the Tass story seemed to shoot down my theory. After all, Voronezh sounded 
like a pretty important city and this time the aliens were seen by many 
onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
So this could have been for real. After all, why else would Tass have reported 
it? 
</P>
<P>
Then, other accounts began to surface. I saw a Soviet TV interview with an 
"onlooker" who had seen the three-eyed aliens. 
</P>
<P>
He was 10 years old. And, as it turns out, the other onlookers were 10 years 
old, too. 
</P>
<P>
I am not saying 10-year-olds are liars. But when I was 10, I would have said I 
saw three-eyed monsters, too, if it would have gotten me on TV or out of a math 
test. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is Voronezh itself. For information about that, I interviewed Antero 
Pietila, a former Moscow correspondent for the Baltimore Sun and an expert on 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not call Voronezh a major city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
What would you call it? I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"A hick town," he said. "A large hick town -- maybe about 300,000 people -- but 
it's still a hick town. Though it is quite plausible to have giant three-eyed 
creatures there." 
</P>
<P>
Really? I said. You are not making this up? 
</P>
<P>
"Really," he said. "Voronezh has a huge cooling lake that sits over a nuclear 
power plant. And the lake is stocked with carp and the people eat the carp." 
</P>
<P>
The government lets people eat carp that swim in the cooling lake of nuclear 
power plant? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yes, the town is very proud of the lake," he said. "They have a beach 
there and everything. And so I would not be surprised at all if, after a few 
years of eating the carp in that lake, you would see strange creatures in 
Voronezh." 
</P>
<P>
So there you have it. The creatures are not aliens! They are the next 
generation of Soviet citizens! 
</P>
<P>
And while some Soviets may be scared of them now, I think they will soon see 
the advantage of having a race of multieyed giants. 
</P>
<P>
Just wait until the '92 Olympics.

CALCUTTA CITIZEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am a graduate student at UC San Diego and I am from Calcutta, India. I would 
like to draw your attention to the reporting "A Calcutta Murderer Slinks From 
Depths Of Depravity" by Mark Fineman (Oct. 9). 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the second paragraph Fineman has reported, "Calcutta is being 
stalked and spooked by a serial murderer, barbaric even by local standards." As 
a citizen of Calcutta I find this remark not only an ignorant one, but also 
insulting because it clearly implies that the local standards of Calcutta are 
already barbaric. 
</P>
<P>
Born and raised in Calcutta, I know the demerits of the city better than any 
one else and I also know that it is a shame for us that people still sleep on 
the streets, but having beggars and poor people doesn't prove at all that the 
standards of a city are barbaric. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to know by what standards has Fineman judged Calcutta, especially 
if the issue involves crime, because he himself is the citizen of a country 
which is known in the world for having the highest crime rate. Fineman should 
have known that in spite of the large population, Calcutta is the least 
crime-infested city in India. It is far behind any city in America as far as 
crime goes. The barbaric drive-by shootings by gangs which are so common in 
this country are alien to the citizens of Calcutta. Women in Calcutta are 
absolutely safe on the streets compared to the women in Los Angeles or New York 
and the murder rate doesn't affect the normal flow of life in the city.

ANN RICHARDS, 'FROM THE HEART' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now let me get this straight. Texas treasurer Ann Richards, a "funny lady" with 
"good-old-gal charms," offered "a rousing start" to "a tough campaign" by 
giving us "a good laugh" with her "humorous attack on George Bush." 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, however, the media dubs George Bush responsible for setting the tone 
and initiating the "dirtiest, most negative presidential campaign in memory." 
</P>
<P>
I must have missed something. Could you run it by again? Just the 
double-standards part will suffice.

THE COUSTEAU WATCH: PREHISTORIC DREAM IN NEW ZEALAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACQUES-YVES COUSTEAU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In New Zealand's Breaksea Sound, one of the longest fjords in the world, the 
coasts are steep, covered with forests and dripping with water. Calypso's stern 
dug into the bushy tree branches. It was raining, unrelentingly. Halfway to the 
top of the high mountains above us, patches of fog clung to the slopes. 
Vertiginous waterfalls cascaded down drenched mountain peaks that merged with 
the sky. Water was everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
It fell in raindrops. It hung in layers of fog. It soaked the forest, oozing 
out of the moss-covered ground, swallowing sap and rot. Then over the surface 
of the sound, it regurgitated a layer of yellowish and murky vegetal freshwater 
goo that floated on top of the deep and crystalline salt water. 
</P>
<P>
I took our small seaplane to land and walked through the deep, vertical forest. 
I maneuvered through the mud, proceeding with caution in a silence broken only 
by the patter of rain, the crackling of rotting branches and the melodic songs 
of bellbirds. 
</P>
<P>
There were evergreen beeches, shrubs with clustered leaves, and ferns 
everywhere -- the dwarf kind, the creeping kind, but also the very tall and 
arborescent kind. Networks of moss covered the ground, the tree trunks and the 
rocks. Everything was spongy. 
</P>
<P>
This welcoming forest, mild and soft to the touch, was defenseless against such 
animals as goats and deer. But scarcely two centuries have passed since humans 
brought goats, sheep, deer, rats and other mammals to New Zealand, that had 
otherwise evolved free of all mammalian life, free of the need of defense. 
</P>
<P>
I removed my gloves and found that, in contrast to the Amazon forest, here 
nothing prickled, nothing stung, nothing irritated the skin. There were no 
scorpions, no snakes, no tarantulas, no biting ants. And, except for perhaps an 
occasional tiny white orchid, obviously of recent date, even as I searched, all 
around me, I saw no flowers. 
</P>
<P>
I leaned on a forked tree limb and fell under the spell, escaping from the 
present world and traveling back in time, relying on daydreams as fragile as 
the half-rotten branch that supported me. Mystery, like the water, flowed 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
I traveled back some 70 million years, when New Zealand broke away from the 
supercontinent of Gondwanaland that eventually divided into the continents of 
our time. I pictured New Zealand as a ship that broke loose from its parent, 
drifting, lashed by tremendous volcanic storms, constantly reshaped by the whim 
of shifting tectonic plates. The dinosaurs never invaded the region that would 
become this vessel, and so the castaway forests had not developed defenses 
against the formidable plant-eaters that most dinosaurs were. 
</P>
<P>
Then I travel back perhaps 130 million years, just before the appearance of the 
first flowers. This time I set foot on Gondwanaland itself to witness the havoc 
the dinosaurs wreaked on plants of all kinds. The vegetation had armed itself 
to no avail with ridiculous prickles to ward off the teeth of the 
brontosauruses and other diplodocuses. When the flowering plants did appear, 
they managed to survive because of their rapid reproduction. And these plants 
not only produced perfumes, but alkaloids and tannins -- odors and bitter 
chemicals capable of discouraging most herbivores. 
</P>
<P>
With that, I then fantasize that flowers could have caused dinosaurs to starve 
and vanish. I picture, with a smile, a giant brontosaurus spitting out a tender 
flower.

ERMA BOMBECK: ZSA ZSA AND HER DRESS FOR DURESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is anyone else Gaboricized to the max? The whole world and all the news in it 
have been put on hold while the media push their newest breakfast serial: 
Fortified Zsa Zsa Goodies. 
</P>
<P>
The major news pales by comparison. Do we know for sure that Oprah put on a few 
pounds? When will Roseanne's tattoos go public? Is it true that Tammy Bakker's 
tears are recycled to conserve water? Inquiring minds want to know. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the most illuminating thing to come out of Gabor's trial for slapping 
a police officer is the insight into our judicial system. It has focused 
attention on an important aspect of the law: what to wear when you go to court, 
or more specifically, how to dress for duress. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-September, when Gabor was delivered to court in what she termed her 
"jailhouse Rolls-Royce," she was wearing a 5-year-old, Italian-designed, 
light-colored outfit. 
</P>
<P>
During the jury selection, accompanied by her hairdresser, she told the press 
that in anticipation of the worst, she had designer Bob Mackie come up with a 
new $6,000 prison dress, complete with traditional jailbird stripes. This must 
have silenced all her critics who thought she wasn't taking the charges 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Later she alleviated all of our anxieties when she purportedly announced, "I 
have enough clothes . . . even if this trial lasts a year." 
</P>
<P>
Here is a woman who knows how the system works. Clothes are important when we 
are being judged. Take Ollie North. He chose a power suit to wear to his trial. 
He should have stuck with the olive number with the silver chicken accessories 
on the shoulder. Uniforms make you look taller and more sincere. 
</P>
<P>
Leona Helmsley should have opted for simple mix-and-match separates from Sears 
topped with plastic earrings. People forgive you for anything when your sleeves 
are too long. 
</P>
<P>
I looked in my closet the other day and realized I didn't have enough clothes 
to get me through a traffic ticket for my dog's violation of the seat-belt law. 
It made me very depressed. I have a black outfit that makes me look like a cat 
burglar and a drop-dead cocktail dress that could get me life. There is little 
in between. The bottom line is, I can't afford to defy the law.

ZAN THOMPSON: LOS COYOTES: BEAUTY TO HOWL ABOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bogie, Bridget and Dino were already swimming blissfully, with their ears 
streaming out behind them, by the time we drove up in the trucks. 
</P>
<P>
We were at Los Coyotes, a ranch on a high ridge of land belonging to my son, 
Tim, and his wife, Geri. The ranch is only about a six-minute drive from their 
house. Their house faces the Salton Sea. Tim and Geri keep the ranch as their 
personal park and swimming hole, picnic and barbecue retreat. 
</P>
<P>
Los Coyotes is the highest point of land in the undulating desert. There is 
beauty in every direction. The Salton Sea looks as if it has been reflecting 
the blue sky since prehistoric times. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it has only been there since 1908 when the Colorado River overflowed 
into the Coachella Valley, filling a vast sand pit and making the inland sea. 
It's 30 miles long and 13 miles wide, according to a government brochure 
published in 1966. Even then, the booklet warned that the water in the sea may 
eventually become too salty to support game fish because of the irrigation 
water as well as the original salt deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, at day's end, the Salton Sea is beautiful to see and it would be a 
tragic loss to the inventory of pure beauty in California if it dries up from 
lack of clear water. 
</P>
<P>
Looking east are the Chocolate Mountains and the Orocopias. Beyond these two 
ranges and dimmed by the distance are the Chuckawallas. 
</P>
<P>
A fold in the mountain range to the east is the Bradshaw Trail. None of the 
guides I have seen in the area say who Bradshaw was. I like to think the trail 
is named for a wagon master or a wagon owner or one of those brave men and 
women who crossed the plains, the mountains, the desert and went north to the 
Oregon Trail or on to the edge of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Across the Salton Sea, the Superstition Mountains rear up like a herd of wild 
stallions. I love the geographic names of the desert. Indian, Spanish or 
cattle-drive English, the names are colorful and graphic. 
</P>
<P>
From Tim and Geri's ranch we can see the San Andreas Fault, splitting the land 
from high up in the mountain range to the desert floor. It makes a streak of 
green in the brown earth. There is water deep in the fault, slaking the thirst 
of the desert vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
The oasis we can see from Los Coyotes is Dos Palmas, a ranch named for the two 
tall palms which were the first to grow in what is now a grove of trees. It 
once belonged to a friend of mine named Ray Morgan, a bright, funny advertising 
man out of Stanford with whom I did several political campaigns. What goes 
around comes around. Ray used to tell me I would enjoy a weekend at his ranch, 
Dos Palmas, and 25 years later, I am standing with my son while he points out 
Ray's former ranch. 
</P>
<P>
The dogs are standing at the edge of the pond, knee deep in the cool water. 
Bogie and Dino are neighbor dogs who run out and join our caravan as we go by 
their house. They are delightful dogs who love to swim. Bridget is Tim and 
Geri's big, gentle, black dog, half Labrador and half German shepherd. She's as 
big as a pony and lamb-gentle. Peaches ran at her and screamed several times 
and Bridget just quietly walked away. 
</P>
<P>
Poor old Peaches had never seen so many dogs of any kind, let alone such big 
ones. Peaches did not choose to swim and she was fortunate that the big dogs 
were all even-tempered. They paid no more attention to Peaches than if she had 
been a butterfly, which frustrated her and hurt her feelings. It's hard to be a 
very small creature in the midst of gentle giants. On the way back, I found out 
why Tim and Geri had brought two trucks. They think it's fine for Bogie and 
Dino to run wildly along beside the trucks on the way, but after the swim and 
all that exercise, they think the dogs should ride back. 
</P>
<P>
As the sun went down, and the mountains went from pink to purple, an airplane 
flew over us. Tim yelled, "It's Brad. He got the plane up." 
</P>
<P>
Brad Bertling is a friend of Tim who has a flying school not far from Los 
Coyotes. He dipped his wings and flashed his lights as he flew over. Tim said 
getting the plane up was a great accomplishment and that Brad had been babying 
the balky airplane for days. It's now flying like a homesick angel, to quote 
that marvelous line known to all flyers. 
</P>
<P>
My house is not yet finished. No one will even hazard a guess as to a 
completion date. Peaches and I are deeply grateful for my friend Jean Erck's 
hospitality, or else we might come sit on the curb in front of your house.

COUNTY MOUNTS CHEMICAL WAR ON ORIENTAL FRUIT FLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIOK-HIAN TAY KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reaching his arm through a hole cut in the truck's window, Bill McCartney 
pointed a spray gun at a tree on a Monrovia sidewalk and fired. 
</P>
<P>
The truck rolled on toward a utility pole, leaving a spritz the size of a 
dinner plate on the tree. The bait contained a scent that attracts the male 
Oriental fruit fly laced with an insecticide that will remain deadly for two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, four flies were discovered on grapefruit, guava and orange trees 
within a square mile in Monrovia and Arcadia. If one more fly is trapped in the 
same area, a quarantine restricting the movement of home-grown produce could be 
imposed, Los Angeles County Agricultural Commissioner Leon Spaugy said in a 
recent statement. 
</P>
<P>
Since Oct. 11, McCartney has been squirting trees -- his arm protected from the 
mist by a plastic sleeve taped over his window -- in the battle to eliminate 
the pest from the two cities. For at least another two months, more than 600 
applications per square mile will be made every two weeks over a 
nine-square-mile area in Monrovia and neighboring Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the Oriental fruit fly has caused an infestation in the 
San Gabriel Valley, said entomologist Becky Jones of the state Department of 
Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
A quarantine on 65 acres in and around West Covina was lifted earlier this 
month. About 70 square miles in the Silver Lake and Echo Park area is under 
quarantine after the discovery of five flies during routine inspection of traps 
in back yard fruit trees. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a very busy year for fruit fly infestations, particularly for 
the Oriental fruit fly," Spaugy said. The pest has been detected in the county 
12 times this year. 
</P>
<P>
The aerial spraying of malathion used in Mediterranean fruit fly eradication is 
not necessary here because state and county bug specialists have found a more 
powerful weapon in "a tremendously attractive male lure," said Bob Atkins, the 
county's deputy agricultural commissioner in charge of pest prevention. 
</P>
<P>
In the "male annihilation technique," the enticing methyl eugenol is mixed with 
the pesticide Naled, which kills both on contact and upon ingestion. 
</P>
<P>
If that seems like a lot of attention for a lowly insect, it is with good 
reason. The fly could cost the state $44 million to $176 million in pesticide 
expenses, crop losses and quarantine restrictions if it isn't successfully 
eradicated. 
</P>
<P>
Originally from Southeast Asia, the fly has become a major pest in Hawaii, 
since it was introduced in that state in the 1940s. One of the most harmful of 
all fruit flies, the species attacks more than 250 varieties of fruits and 
vegetables, including important California crops, such as citrus, avocados and 
grapes. 
</P>
<P>
The fly is a notoriously strong flier that has traveled 30 miles in search of 
food and a place to lay eggs. As a result, infestations can spread quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Slightly larger than a housefly, with a yellow-striped abdomen and yellowish 
legs, the Oriental fruit fly begins its 90-day life cycle in the pulp of a 
fruit or vegetable, after the female deposits 10 to 100 eggs under the skin of 
her target. 
</P>
<P>
Maggots hatch and tunnel through the fruit for nourishment, turning their host 
into a rotten, mottled mass. Sometimes the fruit drops from the tree 
prematurely as a result, said state pest control specialist Roger Faulkner. 
</P>
<P>
The larvae either drop from or crawl out of the fruit to burrow as far as an 
inch into the soil to continue developing. Adult flies emerge within 12 days. 
</P>
<P>
Fly traps throughout the state are checked weekly all year, Faulkner said. 
</P>
<P>
When a fly is caught, trapping is intensified and fruit in the area is 
inspected for the creamy-white larvae. Because there are so many varieties of 
flies, any maggots found are dropped into a vial of alcohol and mailed to 
Sacramento, so that state entomologists can confirm the identification. No 
larvae have been found in Arcadia or Monrovia, Faulkner said. 
</P>
<P>
Fruit from infested countries must be fumigated before entering the state, but 
often untreated produce is carried in by mail or travelers. County, state and 
federal agricultural officials will be meeting later this month to discuss ways 
the pests are slipping into California and how to stop it, Spaugy said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
* The discovery of four Oriental fruit flies in Monrovia and Arcadia earlier 
this month was the second time the flies have been found in the San Gabriel 
Valley this year. To eradicate the flies, officials are treating a 
nine-square-mile area. A quarantine imposed in July on 65 acres in and around 
West Covina was lifted last month.

THE SCHOOL HAS CHANGED, BUT MISSION REMAINS THE SAME

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's 7:45 a.m. and Teri Uyemura's sixth-grade class is drifting onto campus 
like the morning fog that often blankets this part of Northwest Pasadena. They 
walk past the three security guards posted at the school, through halls of 
jostling, yelling seventh- and eighth-graders and plop down into the wooden 
desks of Room 115 at Washington Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
There's Chris Spearman, wearing a pair of knee-length "Do the Right Thing" 
shorts and sporting a red, yellow and green pendant of the African continent on 
his chest. 
</P>
<P>
Followed by Victor Hernandez, with his rat-tail haircut, inquisitive eyes 
framed by glasses held in place with a skier's-type leash. 
</P>
<P>
And Hugo Sanchez, with his pants slung low on his hips, who will make several 
trips to the pencil sharpener and the Kleenex dispenser in the coming hours as 
other heads bend over class work. 
</P>
<P>
"He's so bright," Uyemura says wistfully of Hugo, who already towers over his 
5-foot, 1-inch teacher. After 19 years of teaching sixth grade, the last four 
at Washington, Uyemura knows that with the right encouragement, Hugo will 
blossom. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the sixth grade, Pasadena Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Here in a sunlit classroom festooned with children's drawings and homework 
assignments, Uyemura wrestles with ignorance. She battles the effects of missed 
breakfasts, broken homes, too much TV and not enough sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Washington Middle School, built in 1924, during the post-World War I boom when 
Northwest Pasadena meant swank homes and privilege, now lies in the poorest, 
most ethnic part of town. 
</P>
<P>
Many affluent whites have fled both the area and its public schools. Most of 
Uyemura's kids are black or Latino. More than half have only one parent at 
home, teachers say; most families are on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't faze Uyemura. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to hear any kind of complaining," she announces during the first 
month of class, pivoting on her low heels to better take in the room. "All of 
you guys are supposed to get ready for the seventh grade, and you're not going 
to get anywhere unless you do this work," she says, referring to math problems 
(division with remainders) she has just assigned. 
</P>
<P>
Whether she is explaining homonyms at the board or asking her wriggling charges 
to name the seven continents and four oceans, Uyemura is the boss in Room 115. 
</P>
<P>
She knows it, and the class knows it too. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some of the other teachers they have for electives, Uyemura commands 
students' respect. They may murmur and goof off when she leaves the room for a 
minute, inscribing the desktops with a style of graffiti found throughout 
Northwest Pasadena and throughout Los Angeles. Or the boys may flick pens at 
each other to impress the girls, then holler, "Don't you be touching on me!" as 
they punch the nearest shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
But a sibilant murmur of "Sh's" accompanies Uyemura's return. Several of those 
in the class are garrulous, but this year, Uyemura says with relief, she has a 
basically good bunch of kids. There is no troublemaker, and just a glimmer of a 
class clown, the playful Rickey Armendariz, whom she has so far discouraged by 
explaining that such behavior is for babies and will not be tolerated in the 
grown-up sixth grade. 
</P>
<P>
Others, like Margaret Gonzalez, she merely beams grateful smiles at, smiles 
that the smart girl returns shyly. Slender, with brown locks pulled back neatly 
in a ribbon, Margaret breezes through her assignments, then pulls out "A Light 
in the Attic" and reads while the others catch up. 
</P>
<P>
Uyemura instills trust too. When she bends over a student's work, she sticks 
her face right up to theirs, looking them eyeball to eyeball, praising them out 
loud for good work, sometimes admonishing them privately for bad behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Sixth grade works on a simple system of incentives, punishments and rewards. 
Students who finish a set amount of class work, which varies whether they want 
to earn an A, B or C, can go to "break" when the bell rings. Those who don't 
stay in. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the sixth grade," Uyemura reflects during lunch, catching her breath 
while students wander in and out of the classroom to talk about weekend 
excursions and coming projects. 
</P>
<P>
"They're right at the age when you can talk to them and reason with them. 
They're trying to discover who they are." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard sometimes, since the class is interrupted repeatedly, by a monitor 
coming around for candy money, an instructor poking her head in for 30 seconds 
to confer with Uyemura, a special-education teacher collecting a child for 
individual counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the attentive classroom and the children's interest in learning, this 
is no little red schoolhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of kids I have are borderline to giving up. They're really close," 
Uyemura says, her voice tinged with sadness. She mentions one student about 
whom she is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"He could real easily be out on the street and be a gang member," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Another has shown up twice for school in recent weeks. When he arrived one of 
those days, another instructor sent him right to detention. He hasn't been 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Things were different between 1958 and 1960, when Uyemura attended Washington 
Middle School. There was a woodworking shop, intramural sports, social and 
civic clubs -- more of a campus life. 
</P>
<P>
Today, security guards patrol the campus to keep violence, especially 
gang-related activities, away. The school is surrounded by fences that are 
locked at night. After-school sports were scuttled when games started 
attracting unsavory neighborhood denizens. 
</P>
<P>
The ethnic makeup was different then too. Uyemura remembers a fairly even mix 
of white and black students then. Today there are few whites and an increasing 
number of Latinos, with a sprinkling of Armenians. 
</P>
<P>
But kids are still kids, especially at that tremulous threshold between 
childhood and adolescence. Earlier in the day, they had hung with rapt 
attention on the words of Jim Robinett who team-teaches science with Uyemura in 
the adjoining classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Robinett had sliced open the embalmed heart of a sheep before the intrigued 
class, and the talk had gone from arteries to embalming fluid to a 
well-received discussion about Cleopatra and the famous Egyptian mummy King 
Tut. 
</P>
<P>
To the kids, this suddenly wasn't school, it was "Raiders of the Lost Ark," 
with Robinett assuming the mantle of Indiana Jones as he spun his tale. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Deandre Hall, a slender boy whose hair is closely shaved, except for a 
triangular patch at the base of his skull, came running up to his teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Uyemura," he said, happy to show off his knowledge of ancient Egyptian 
history. "I heard about him. I heard about that man who was wrapped."

SHOPKEEPER BACKS WESTWOOD HOTELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a small shop owner in Westwood Village, I deplore the position of the three 
homeowners' groups (Westwood Homeowners Assn., friends of Westwood Inc. and 
Holmby-Westwood Property Owners) regarding the limit of hotel rooms in Westwood 
Village. I believe Westwood should have several hotels and that hotel visitors 
would stabilize the downtrend in the type of visitor to the village. 
</P>
<P>
The hotels would bring non-automobile, upper-income visitors to the village. 
The restaurants and shopping are a natural attraction. The university needs the 
hotel rooms to support its activities. The existing offices will support the 
hotels. Residents in the area will find the quality of the services offered and 
the upscale restaurants and shopping appealing. 
</P>
<P>
To block the development of hotels will only continue the downward direction of 
the village. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles must understand that it has a responsibility to operate 
as a master landlord who must compete for business with newer shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the city approaches Westwood as if it were a penal colony. It taxes 
the users of the parking spaces by an aggressive ticketing policy that serves 
to drive away the very type of customers we shopkeepers wish to attract. 
</P>
<P>
The city should be made accountable for its administration of the area. It 
takes tax revenue from the real estate sales, tax revenue from the shop owners, 
and police revenue from the parking and traffic violators. But it is running 
the area into economic oblivion and exacerbating the very situation that we all 
wish corrected.

HOUSING ISSUE BEYOND A FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I do not know all of the facts of Keryl Cartee's life up to now (Times, Oct. 
8). There is no statement as to whether or not she was ever married, whether or 
not these children are from one marriage or what happened to her husband or 
husbands who have not or are not in a position to support their children. 
</P>
<P>
The attitude of (Santa Monica Rent Control Commissioner) Wayne Bauer that it is 
the responsibility of the landlords of Santa Monica to provide this woman 
housing at a below-market cost is not justifiable. My question is: "What is the 
responsibility of the individual to provide for herself and her family?" 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that there are many people in our city who have deferred 
having large families because they could not provide for them, and there are 
hundreds of families with five children who would love to have a three- or 
four-bedroom apartment in Santa Monica at a low rent. 
</P>
<P>
Will Mr. Bauer provide these other less fortunate families with the same 
accommodations that he is seeking for Ms. Cartee?

LIGHT RAIL FORUM DISPUTE SIMMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I had to laugh when I saw the letter from Susan Brown giving her lame defense 
of the fairness of her so-called "Light Rail Forum." Here's my view of her 
highly orchestrated non-event: 
</P>
<P>
The "forum" was promoted only in the neighborhoods along the Exposition right 
of way. Brightly colored posters lined the streets within a block or so of the 
rail line. I also received a definitely one-sided sheet announcing the event 
from her group, the Cheviot Hills Homeowners Assn. The notice presented none of 
the alternative information available from other groups. 
</P>
<P>
Especially ludicrous was her defense of the gathering as representing 
alternative viewpoints. Yes, Neil Peterson, the executive director of the 
county Transportation Commission was there. But he was asked to speak first. 
Then the other five primary participants took turns lambasting him, his 
presentation, the city of Santa Monica, and light rail. 
</P>
<P>
This spectacle was followed by a videotape that made up in inflammatory 
distortion what it lacked in technical competence. At this point you could have 
taken the audience and goose-stepped it down to kick the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
In her letter, Susan Brown asks the question: "What other responsible viewpoint 
could there be?" Well, mine was there but was not welcome. I made 400 copies of 
a letter to the community I drafted urging caution (and) asking residents to 
beware of manipulation by both sides. It also asked if we should preserve the 
right of way for other possible uses. 
</P>
<P>
I asked Ms. Brown if I could leave the letter on the table with the other 
literature which was all anti-rail. 
</P>
<P>
She proceeded to yell, "Absolutely not," that this was "her meeting" and that 
if I wanted to give them out I could go and organize my own meeting. Clearly, 
according to Susan Brown, the only possible responsible viewpoint is her own. 
</P>
<P>
My first concern is that the Exposition right of way should be preserved before 
it is lost, regardless of whether it is found most useful for a strip park, 
urban bike trail, jogging path, or any of the various possibilities for public 
transportation. I now have the added concern that my neighbors and I are being 
manipulated by demagogues whose only concern is for their own narrow agendas.

IDEAS OF ALHAMBRANS AND S. PASADENANS IN GRIDLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding South Pasadena's effort in stopping the completion of the Long Beach 
Freeway, and the resulting traffic gridlock created in Alhambra, I have one 
simple solution. 
</P>
<P>
If South Pasadena residents are sincere in their desire to save their 
"historical" homes, they can help us Alhambra residents if they voluntarily 
stopped using our streets to reach their destination or to make connections to 
other nearby freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine if several thousand South Pasadena residents voluntarily refrained from 
traveling on Alhambra streets! Perhaps we (Alhambra residents) might regain 
some sense of normalcy. I would like this idea to be presented to the South 
Pasadena City Council as well as those groups who are fighting the freeway.

CHOOSING SIDES ON BUILDING PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rhubarb over a proposed project at Santa Monica airport makes painfully 
clear why homeowner groups have been so energetic (and accused of being 
"fanatic" and "overzealous") in their opposition to such intrusive projects and 
so distrustful of the actions of government. 
</P>
<P>
The scene is repeated almost laughably often: 1) The developer proposes a 
project of enormous size; 2) the developer emphasizes that the project will 
have "no impact on the community!"; 3) The City Council (in this case, Santa 
Monica, but Los Angeles is no less guilty of this behavior) sidles up to the 
homeowners with professions of support, yells and screams at the size of the 
project, and proceeds to approve a "reduced" project, accepting the developer's 
contention that the project will have "no impact." 
</P>
<P>
You don't have to be a genius to imagine that the developer proposed a much 
bigger project than he really needed, and that even the "reduced" project will 
have lots of "impact." 
</P>
<P>
Those of us active in homeowners' causes know that the system is based upon 
much more than rationality, and that our leaders usually appear willing to risk 
future community integrity for present promises of tax base and campaign 
support. The people who live here seem to have a much better sense of what will 
work and what won't in the near and far future. Until government and developers 
show that they truly have community integrity at heart, rather than just their 
own pocketbooks, homeowner associations will continue their "fanatic, 
overzealous" hue and cry.

PEI MASTERPIECE: TOO ELEGANT HERE?; 
</P>
<P>
DESIGN: POLISHED TO PERFECTION, BUILDING DOESN'T SEEM TO FIT IN WITH ITS 
LOW-PROFILE BEVERLY HILLS NEIGHBORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By LEON WHITESON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the busy corner in Beverly Hills where Little Santa Monica and Wilshire 
boulevards intersect, the sleek new headquarters for the Creative Artists 
Agency poses like a dapper executive waiting for his chauffeur to bring the 
limo around. 
</P>
<P>
The three-story building stands supremely self-assured on the western edge of 
Beverly Hills, exuding more sheer class than any other structure in the city. 
Draped in honeyed travertine marble, tinted glass and crisp white steel, CAA's 
urbanely elegant curves were tailored by a master. 
</P>
<P>
The master tailor is New York architect I. M. Pei. His client, CAA President 
Michael Ovitz, who heads the most powerful talent agency in Hollywood -- that 
is, the world -- asked for an architecture that was "very simple and very 
classic." 
</P>
<P>
"I did a lot of research, and decided I. M. was my man," Ovitz explained. "I 
love the style of the classic period of modernism, especially the 1930's German 
Bauhaus, and I feel Pei is the purest inheritor of that tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing I wanted for this agency was a trendy L.A.-style building that 
would date in a decade. I wanted an I. M. Pei signature design straight from 
his own hands, and I got exactly what I was after." 
</P>
<P>
The CAA building, within the limits of its mainstream modernist style, bears a 
mantle of inevitability, as if this were the only way such a building could be 
done. Its artful geometries and urbane dress are all of a piece, perfect in 
every detail. 
</P>
<P>
But is its splendidly sleek style appropriate to Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
The building doesn't seem to fit where it is placed, in the midst of a host of 
pleasantly low-key, thoroughly ordinary commercial and residential buildings. 
It has the air of a man from Manhattan who, hailing a cab on Park Avenue, to 
his astonishment, ends up at this odd corner of Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Outside architects seem often to carry a baggage of assumptions about Los 
Angeles, one of them being that the city has no distinctive architectural 
character in its commercial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Pei, who admits he seldom visits here, should have taken the time to absorb the 
look of Beverly Hills' "Golden Triangle" commercial district. He might have 
discovered the delightful mix of Spanish Colonial, Art Deco and Italianate 
architecture that make the city's shopping streets so pleasant to roam. 
</P>
<P>
He might have let his hair down a little and responded with a touch of 
playfulness that would have made his masterpiece less of a stranger in our 
midst. 
</P>
<P>
Although Pei heads one of the largest and most prestigious architectural firms 
in the United States, he only puts his personal designs on a few select 
projects. These include the new pyramid in the courtyard of the Louvre in 
Paris, the Dallas Symphony Center, and earlier designs for the East Wing of the 
National Gallery of Art in Washington and the Kennedy Library in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Most Pei projects, such as the expansion of the Los Angeles Convention Center 
and the 72-story First Interstate World Center now rising beside the downtown 
Central Library, are handled by Pei's partners. 
</P>
<P>
The CAA building is the first signature design by Pei on the West Coast. Noted 
for its superb simplicity and crisp precision, Pei's personal architecture 
stands or falls by the quality of its cut and the excellence of its execution. 
</P>
<P>
Pei said a major reason why he waited so long to accept a signature commission 
in Southern California was his fear that he might not be able to find here the 
high level of craftsmanship that his designs demand. 
</P>
<P>
The excellent craftsmanship evident in every detail of the CAA building proves 
that Pei's fears were unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
CAA's curves and counter-curves, culminating in a spacious semicircular glazed 
atrium that rises through three stories to a conical skyline, are refined to 
perfection. Stone, steel and glass mesh like gears in a Porsche transmission. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very impressed by the quality of 
</P>
<P>
the workmanship in this building," Pei said. "I was afraid that, as things seem 
so transient in Los Angeles, I wouldn't find local subcontractors who could 
measure up to my standards. 
</P>
<P>
"Tremendous credit is due to those craftsmen who created the stone, steel and 
glass elements, and to the general contractor, and especially to Bill McGregor, 
the developer who managed the construction contract." 
</P>
<P>
Pei feels that the CAA design shows that Los Angeles can play host to an 
architecture that is deeply sophisticated and finely finished, up to the 
highest standards. 
</P>
<P>
"The dynamism of this city, which I've long admired, is reaching for a level of 
expression to match its developing self-confidence as one of the world's great 
metropolises," he said. "Local architects should take courage from this, and 
reach for unabashed excellence." 
</P>
<P>
Pei's architect son Sandi, who worked with his father on the CAA design and 
played a major role in supervising its construction, said, "This is a building 
of great ambition. 
</P>
<P>
"We studied every detail, every junction between stone and glass and steel, 
every quality of finish. For example, my father insisted on using solid blocks 
of travertine selected from the Poggi quarries in Tivoli, Italy, rather than 
risk the cheaper practice of using thin slabs of stone as facing panels. This 
gives the building a feeling of solidity, even to the casual glance." 
</P>
<P>
Like all fine tailoring, the deceptive simplicity of CAA's appearance conceals 
the expense of its creation. At a reported cost of $25 million, the building's 
75,000-square-foot bulk, plus three underground parking levels, is roughly 
twice as expensive as a standard corporate office structure. 
</P>
<P>
CAA's main entry off Little Santa Monica Boulevard divides the exterior facade 
in two. The northern half, oriented toward the commercial character of the 
"Golden Triangle" shopping district, is sheathed in tinted glass set in a frame 
of travertine. 
</P>
<P>
The southern half, sympathetic to the residential streets behind the building, 
is solid stone with house-like windows punched in regular rows. A fourth-floor 
parapet hides the building's rooftop plant rooms. 
</P>
<P>
The sunlit atrium, dominated by a huge and vivid painting by artist Roy 
Lichtenstein, is the heart of Pei's concept. 
</P>
<P>
Designed as a connection between the north and south wings of the building, the 
atrium, in Pei's words, "encourages the relaxed interaction that characterizes 
this agency, where around 200 creative people engaged in the collective 
enterprise of making movies and television programs can casually gather here, 
or cross the overhead bridges that link the two halves of the building." 
</P>
<P>
Spectacular, cantilevered steel ring beams support the atrium's giant skylight. 
Rods of silvered aluminum bars under the glass create a fan of barred shadows 
on the Lichtenstein mural. The mural, inspired by a small 1920's sketch by 
Bauhaus artist Oskar Schlemmer, knocks your eye out with its hard yellows, 
blues and busy dots. 
</P>
<P>
The mural captures the visitor's attention as he enters the atrium from the 
street or from the elevator leading up from the underground parking. 
</P>
<P>
Upper-level atrium balconies afford busy workers a moment to pause and watch 
colleagues crisscrossing the wide marble floor below. From there, a sharp 
observer may note a revealing contrast between the style of the building and 
the mode of the people who work in it. 
</P>
<P>
While the fashion of the architecture may be mature, most of the young agents 
and secretaries who scurry across the atrium, attired in hip outfits from 
Esprit and the Gap, seem barely post-pubescent. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever CAA's architectural pretensions to mature politesse, the Hollywood 
industry is powered by an insatiable appetite for youthful energy. 
</P>
<P>
CAA President Ovitz's office, which overlooks Santa Monica Boulevard and the 
park-like stretch of residential streets beyond, is modest in size and subdued 
in style. 
</P>
<P>
Following the curve of the facade, the presidential suite is divided into a 
section for informal conferences and an area with a semi-circular desk, 
designed by Kitty Hawks, that echoes the shape of the atrium. 
</P>
<P>
The tones of carpeting and cabinetry are subtle gray and beige, in tune with 
the muted palette of Pei's travertine and glass. 
</P>
<P>
Other private offices are less discreet. Each executive was free to hire his 
own designer, and the results range from homey Southwestern pueblo to paneled 
Louis Quatorze fit for an agent aristocrat.

A GOOD NEGOTIATOR'S TRUMP CARD IN DEAL: APPEAR NONCHALANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS, Bruss is a San Francisco-area lawyer, author and real 
estate broker. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Successful real estate negotiation does not necessarily involve outsmarting the 
other party. But it does involve careful planning to fully understand the 
negotiating situation. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite motto is "Proper preparation prevents poor performance." This 
statement is especially true if you want to be a successful real estate 
negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, we discussed the importance of using your superior knowledge to 
formulate a negotiation game plan, understanding the importance of time in 
negotiation, gaining power by learning everything you can about the other party 
while revealing as little information about your situation as possible and 
understanding the "higher authority" negotiation strategy. 
</P>
<P>
This week we will conclude our negotiation discussion with more strategies to 
use if you want to be a successful real estate negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
Use the "he who cares least, wins" strategy. Buying or selling a home is a 
highly emotional decision. However, when you want to successfully negotiate the 
best possible price and terms, from your viewpoint it is important to be 
unemotional. Pretend you don't really care if you buy the property. 
</P>
<P>
If you are the buyer, the world won't come to an end if you don't purchase the 
home you like best. If you are the seller, you don't absolutely have to receive 
the top price and all the sales terms you would like to get. 
</P>
<P>
Top negotiators realize that if they are to be successful, they must adopt, at 
least on the outside, an attitude of not caring. If it becomes too obvious that 
you must either buy or sell quickly, the other party will soon sense your 
situation and try to take advantage of you. 
</P>
<P>
For example, negotiations for large commercial properties often go on for 
months if neither party is highly motivated. However, when the seller must sell 
quickly or the buyer has a deadline, then one party will get the best of the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
Watch out for the non-stop negotiation strategy. If you are a property seller, 
beware of buyers who never stop negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
Even after a firm written contract is signed by both buyer and seller, some 
buyers will continue hammering away to negotiate a better deal. They usually do 
this by repeatedly coming back to the property to inspect and reinspect. 
</P>
<P>
Often they do this for various alleged reasons, such as to measure the rooms 
for furniture. But the truth is, every time they come back they are looking for 
defects so they can renegotiate the price or other terms. 
</P>
<P>
The truly professional non-stop negotiators wait until just before the 
scheduled closing date when the seller has already made plans to vacate and 
other prospective buyers have lost interest in the property. 
</P>
<P>
This is when the non-stop negotiators spring their last-minute demands on the 
seller, such as insisting the seller leave the appliances or the buyer won't 
complete the purchase as agreed. Although the seller knows the buyer has no 
right to the appliances, often the seller will agree just to keep the sale from 
falling apart. 
</P>
<P>
The best way to handle the non-stop negotiator is to be tough. Make sure you 
have a firm, well-written, legally binding real estate sales contract. Unless 
you see some advantage to changing the terms, stick by the original agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Tactfully remind the other party, perhaps through your attorney, that you 
expect to live up to your agreement and you expect the other party to do so 
too. 
</P>
<P>
The good guy-bad guy strategy. You may occasionally encounter this negotiation 
method in which one party on the opposite side acts difficult and unpleasant 
while the other person acts extremely pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
Husbands and wives often play these roles like Hollywood movie stars. The 
husband is usually the tough guy, demanding an unreasonable price or terms. 
Then the wife, when she sees he won't get his way, suggests a compromise at 
more reasonable terms. 
</P>
<P>
To counteract this strategy, just listen to the other parties, nod your head to 
show understanding but not necessarily agreement, and let the talkers wear 
themselves out. Even if it takes hours, let the other side run out of energy 
until they agree with your viewpoint. The best time to negotiate with these 
people is in the evening or on a weekend, when you have plenty of time to wait 
them out. 
</P>
<P>
The auction strategy. If you have ever been to an auction, you know the often 
uncontrollable fever that affects some buyers who absolutely must have the item 
being auctioned. The same thing can happen in real estate, especially in a 
strong seller's market when there are fewer properties for sale than there are 
qualified buyers. 
</P>
<P>
When buyers are abundant, property sellers can afford to adopt a "he who cares 
least, wins" attitude. This happened to me recently. The seller rejected my 
purchase offer, implied there was another offer coming in from another buyer, 
and invited me to make a better bid. But I called his bluff by not raising my 
bid. I doubt that there was another offer because the property is still for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
As a buyer, when I know there is another buyer I drop out, because the only 
winner in a bidding contest is the seller.

IMPROVE THE COMMUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article, "The High Cost of Housing" (Oct. 1), properly identified the high 
cost of land as the culprit. That answer, however, merely raises another 
question: Why does land cost so much here? 
</P>
<P>
Land prices reflect supply and demand. Limits on the supply side of the 
relationship distinguish Southern California from other areas and explain much 
of the differential. 
</P>
<P>
Because of traffic congestion, commuting ranges -- the distances that one can 
travel in a given time during rush hours -- rank among the lowest anywhere. 
Commuting ranges determine the area in which workers can live, and this area 
fixes the supply of housing for them. 
</P>
<P>
As commuting ranges decrease, the area in which people can live decreases. As 
the area decreases, the supply of housing does, too, and prices go up because 
fewer sellers compete against each other. 
</P>
<P>
As commuting ranges increase, the area increases, and commuters have more 
choices for housing. More sellers compete against each other, the supply 
increases, and prices decrease. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, Chicago, Boston, Toronto, and, to a lesser extent, Washington and 
San Francisco, and in all major cities of Western Europe, commuter rail systems 
move many of people over long distances. By increasing commuting ranges and 
spreading people over a larger area, these systems increase the supply of land 
suitable for housing for urban workers and reduce the price of it. Southern 
California has no comparable systems and, consequently, relatively higher 
housing costs. 
</P>
<P>
To make housing more affordable here, we must increase the efficiency of our 
transportation system. Land costs, housing prices, and transportation 
efficiency are inextricably linked together. 
</P>
<P>
As long as public policy here and in Washington ignores this linkage and does 
little to increase transportation efficiency, the housing affordability crisis 
will continue unabated. The solutions coming from some quarters -- greater FHA 
mortgage limits, using IRA savings for down payments and other 
demand-increasing schemes -- will only boost demand and increase prices.

letter, but reconsidered, figuring "Nah, it will get better." Well it hasn't, 
so here is the letter: 
</P>
<P>
Enough already! Enough gardening, home repair and enough of "some washed-up 
star moves out of the area." At a time when Los Angeles is taking over as the 
real estate and financial capital of the United States, we are being informed 
that Burl Ives is moving to Washington state. In a year when major Century City 
and Westwood high-rise office buildings have changed hands, we are being 
informed that now is the time to plant fava beans and rhubarb. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe there should be a separate section for gardening and household tips. 
</P>
<P>
When we finally find the commercial section, on Page 17, the lead article is 
about a development that is being built by Tom Selleck's brother and father. It 
seems, unless your name is Joan Collins or Tom Selleck, your chance for meaty 
commercial real estate news is almost impossible. 
</P>
<P>
This is a major metropolitan city. Let's report on office, retail and 
industrial properties that are being sold, leased or developed.

KASEM AND HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read in the Oct. 1 Hot Property column that homeless activist Casey Kasem and 
his wife, Jean, purchased a home in the Holmby Hills for $6.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, a $6.8-million residence is a minimum necessity and quite normal, 
especially with all the homelessness and poverty the Kasems and others whine 
about. 
</P>
<P>
Kasem could go down as the greatest humanitarian in U.S. history by making the 
supreme sacrifice: selling the $6.8-million place and buying one valued at a 
mere $1 million. Then Kasem could take the $5.8-savings and make a cash 
contribution to each and every homeless person in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
With this, the homeless could rent apartments or houses, and get off the 
streets. Then, with a place of their own, they could go out and look for and 
obtain employment. (There are plenty of available jobs.) 
</P>
<P>
I believe, Kasem knows that even if he were to undertake this magnanimous 
philanthropy, homelessness would still be with us, as it has been throughout 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the homeless are mentally ill and are in need of institutionalization. 
Others, enjoy the freedom and irresponsibility of being homeless. They'd all 
take the money, and there would still be homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
Then, what would happen to this "cause"? Obviously, Kasem is not cut from the 
same cloth as New Orleans millionaire Pat Taylor, who was recently profiled on 
"60 Minutes." Taylor is single-handedly offering to pay full college tuition to 
any New Orleans school child who stays in school, gets Bs and stays out of 
trouble with the law. Pat Taylor puts his money where his mouth is. Casey Kasem 
merely fills America with insincere liberal rhetoric.

YOUR MORTGAGE;

<P>
AS FIXED-RATE MORTGAGE RATES DIP, FEWER BUYERS OPT FOR ADJUSTABLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With fixed-mortgage rates near their lowest point of the decade and 
adjustable-rate mortgages offering consumers less initial savings, a growing 
number of home buyers are rejecting the call to ARMs and once again opting for 
fixed-rate loans. 
</P>
<P>
Adjustables are usually popular with consumers when interest rates are high and 
introductory rates on ARMs are at least two points below those offered on 
fixed-rate mortgages. But the average introductory rate on ARMs now stands at 
about 8 3/4%, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., and consumers 
can easily find fixed-rate loans at 10% -- a difference of little more than a 
point. 
</P>
<P>
"People are looking at the numbers and saying, 'The money I could initially 
save by choosing an ARM just isn't worth the risk involved in having a loan 
with a rate that could move up real fast," said Peter G. Miller, author of "The 
Common Sense Mortgage." 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I don't blame them. If I were looking for a mortgage today, I'd 
choose a fixed over an adjustable." 
</P>
<P>
Miller isn't alone: In a turnaround from just a few months ago, many financial 
experts are telling consumers who are loan-shopping today to choose a 
fixed-rate loan over one whose interest rate will vary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rate Likely to Change 
</P>
<P>
Although fixed-rate loans are hovering around the 10%-mark and many lenders are 
offering ARMs with an introductory rate under 9%, it's important to remember 
that the ARM rate will likely change at the first adjustment period -- usually 
in six or 12 months. When that happens, the loan rate could easily go higher 
than 10% -- higher than today's fixed-rate loans. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, fixed-rate loans offer other advantages. "There's the comfort of 
knowing that your rate and your monthly payment will never change, even if 
inflation takes off," Miller said. "That makes budgeting a bit easier and might 
also let you sleep better at night." 
</P>
<P>
Home buyers seem to like all those advantages. When fixed rates stood above 11% 
earlier this year, about 54% of the public opted for adjustable-rate mortgages, 
according to the federal Office of Thrift Supervision. But now that fixed-rate 
loans can be found for about 10%, only 27% are choosing ARMs. 
</P>
<P>
It's a trend that many experts say will continue, in part because mortgage 
rates are expected to drift upward through much of next year. Borrowers who 
take out fixed-rate loans today won't feel the effects of the expected 
increases: Buyers who choose adjustable-rate loans will. 
</P>
<P>
Although ARMs may have lost some of their luster, they're still attractive to 
certain types of buyers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Short-Term Stay 
</P>
<P>
"If you can barely qualify for a loan, you might want to choose an 
adjustable-rate mortgage over a fixed-rate loan because the lower initial rate 
on the ARM will make it easier to get the money," said Mark Obrinksy, senior 
economist for the Federal National Mortgage Assn. in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"Or, you might want to choose the ARM if you're only going to be in your house 
for one, two or three years. You'll get the savings provided by the ARM's low 
initial rate, and you'll probably have moved by the time it's adjusted all the 
way upwards." 
</P>
<P>
If an ARM still looks attractive, remember that your interest rate will be 
periodically adjusted based on changes in an index specified by the lender. One 
of the most popular is the 11th District cost of funds index, a composite 
figure that reflects rates the Federal Home Loan Bank charges lenders for a 
variety of different loans. 
</P>
<P>
Other popular ARMs are linked to the more volatile index of one-year Treasury 
securities. Still others are pegged to long-term Treasuries, the prime rate or 
more obscure indexes. 
</P>
<P>
If you disbelieve most economists and think rates are headed for a sharp 
downturn, choose an ARM linked to one-year Treasuries because the index reacts 
more quickly to interest-rate swings. But if you think rates are headed higher 
or you don't want wild fluctuations each time your rate is adjusted, consider 
an ARM that's linked to the slower-moving cost-of-funds index or five-year 
Treasury index. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lender's 'Spread' 
</P>
<P>
Also remember that all lenders slap on a markup, or "spread," on the index once 
the introductory rate has ended. If the index rate is 8 1/2% and the lender's 
spread is two points, your new rate will be 10 1/2%. 
</P>
<P>
"If the lender wants a spread that's more than two or 2 1/2 points, it's best 
to look somewhere else," said Lawrence A. Krause, president of a San 
Francisco-based financial planning firm that bears his name. 
</P>
<P>
Also look for a loan that has a five- or six-point limit, or "cap," on how high 
the rate can go over the life of the loan. So, if the introductory rate is 8.5% 
and the loan has a five-point cap, your interest rate will never go above 
13.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, too, to see what kind of cap is put on the periodic adjustments. 
Generally, it's best to look for an ARM that can't be adjusted more than one or 
two percentage points at each adjustment period. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if your ARM currently has a 9.5% rate, a two-point cap on the 
periodic adjustments would prevent your loan from rising above 11.5% the next 
time it's changed -- regardless of how high rates might go between now and 
then.

MANY MARKET LENDERS FINANCE 90% MORTGAGES

<P>
QUESTION: We live in a very expensive area where home prices seem outrageous. 
My husband and I have been saving like mad but only have about a 10% down 
payment. What is the maximum limit on a 90% mortgage? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: There is no limit to 90% mortgages. Although Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 
can't buy mortgages over $187,000, there are other secondary-mortgage market 
lenders who either originate or buy home loans with virtually unlimited 
amounts. 
</P>
<P>
These so-called jumbo loans can be obtained from local S&amp;Ls, banks and 
mortgage brokers. Although these loans may seem expensive, they are better than 
the alternative of not buying a home. 
</P>
<P>
Getting a big mortgage doesn't conflict with the suggestion that you pay off 
that mortgage as quickly as possible if you plan to stay in the home many years 
and want to save interest dollars by cutting the loan from 30 to 15 or 20 
years. To find out the exact extra payment necessary to cut the mortgage term, 
ask your lender to supply a 15-year and 20-year payment amortization schedule. 
</P>
<P>
'Get Largest Mortgage' Still the Best Advice 
</P>
<P>
Q: Several times you recently said home buyers should obtain the largest 
mortgage they can get. I agree that because of the 1987 Tax Act, your advice 
makes sense. But doesn't this conflict with your advice to add an extra $50 or 
$100 to each mortgage payment to reduce the principal and cut the mortgage 
term? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Many home buyers make large down payments, thinking it is smart to 
reduce their monthly mortgage payment by a few dollars. Then they realize their 
big mistake but it's too late. Once a home acquisition mortgage is obtained, 
the home buyer has only 90 days to change his/her mind. 
</P>
<P>
Tax-Deferred Exchange Way to Handle Profit 
</P>
<P>
Q: We recently sold some land and earned about $44,000 profit. If we use this 
money to pay down our home mortgage can we avoid tax? 
</P>
<P>
A: Nice try, but using your cash from the land sale to pay down your home 
mortgage won't avoid tax on the profit. You could have avoided tax by making an 
IRC 1031 tax-deferred exchange but it's too late now. Please consult your tax 
adviser for details. 
</P>
<P>
Pay Home Loan Fee by Separate Check 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are buying our first home. Our realtor advised us to pay the loan fee by 
separate check, so we can deduct it on our income tax returns. But the lender 
refused to let us do that and subtracted the loan fee from our mortgage 
proceeds. Can we deduct our loan fee on our tax returns anyway? 
</P>
<P>
A: The official IRS position is that the loan fee for a mortgage to acquire a 
principal residence is tax deductible as itemized interest if "paid" from 
separate funds rather than being subtracted from loan proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
You should have listened to your smart realtor and insisted that the lender 
allow you to pay the loan fee by separate check. Shame on that ill-informed 
lender who forced you to make a costly tax mistake. I've heard some aggressive 
taxpayers claim this deduction even if the lender subtracted the loan fee from 
the proceeds, but then they pray every day that they won't be audited by the 
IRS on this item. 
</P>
<P>
Loan fees not paid by separate check on home acquisition loans and loan fees on 
all other types of realty loans are tax deductible over the life of the loan. 
Please consult your CPA for full details. 
</P>
<P>
Child Can't Deduct Mom's Mortgage Cost 
</P>
<P>
Q: For the last few years, I have been paying my disabled mother's mortgage 
payments, property taxes and insurance. A friend tells me I can deduct these 
expenses on my income tax returns, although I do not live in my mother's house. 
If true, these tax deductions would save me a bundle of income taxes since I 
rent an apartment and don't have enough tax deductions to itemize. Please 
clarify. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your friend is mistaken. Since you are not the owner of the property and 
therefore are not obligated to pay the mortgage and property taxes, you are not 
entitled to deduct them on your tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
However, if your mother is willing to add you as a co-owner of the residence 
and if you move into it as your personal residence, then you would become 
eligible to deduct the mortgage interest and property taxes you pay. 
</P>
<P>
But there could be adverse tax consequences of doing so because if your mother 
is expected to die soon, you would probably be better off inheriting the home 
since you would then receive a stepped-up basis of its market value on the date 
of her death. Please discuss the pros and cons with your tax adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Don't Use Inheritance on Mortgage Principal 
</P>
<P>
Q: Several times recently you have advised homeowners to make extra principal 
payments of $100 or so each month on their mortgage payments to cut the length 
of their mortgage by several years. My husband recently inherited almost 
$15,000 and we are considering using it to pay down our 8.25% interest-rate 
mortgage, which has a balance of almost $34,000. Do you think we should do 
this? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Making a lump sum prepayment on a low interest rate home loan is not a 
smart idea. There are several reasons. Your monthly mortgage payment will not 
be reduced, and since your mortgage interest rate is low, you will never again 
be able to borrow money so cheaply. 
</P>
<P>
You would be tying up cash which you might need for emergencies or investments. 
By paying down a low-cost loan, you would really be investing that $15,000 at 
8.25 percent interest. That is a very poor investment. 
</P>
<P>
The only advantage of making a lump-sum payment on a low-interest-rate mortgage 
is you will cut the life of the mortgage and save some interest. However, 
saving interest at 8.25 percent is not a smart move. Instead, I suggest you 
invest that $15,000. Surely you can earn more than 8.25 percent interest on it. 
</P>
<P>
You Don't Have to Pay Off Loan Before Selling 
</P>
<P>
Q: A few years ago, we refinanced our mortgage with a new VA loan. My husband 
died last year and I have decided to sell my home and move to a better climate. 
I talked to a realtor and she says I don't have to pay off my mortgage before 
selling. This doesn't seem right to me that I can sell with my mortgage unpaid. 
How does this work? 
</P>
<P>
A: Presuming your VA mortgage was created before 1988, there is no need to pay 
it off before selling your home. The buyer can either assume it or obtain 
another mortgage which will be used to pay off your old VA loan. 
</P>
<P>
Having an assumable mortgage is a major advantage if it has an attractive 
interest rate. However, if the buyer assumes your VA mortgage, be sure the 
lender releases you from further liability. 
</P>
<P>
Then, if the buyer defaults, you won't have to worry about a deficiency loss 
against you. Ask your attorney to explain further.

SALES OF NEW HOMES UP 2% IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New-home sales in Orange County rose a modest 2% this summer from a year 
earlier, but were up a sharp 19.5% from the spring, according to a real estate 
research and consulting group. 
</P>
<P>
The report by the Meyers Group said 2,970 new homes were sold in the 
three-month period that ended Sept. 30, up from 2,901 homes sold in the 
previous summer and the 2,486 homes sold last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-eight new projects opened for sale in the latest quarter, compared to 29 
in the spring and 22 in the summer of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The median price of a new single-family home in the county stood at $350,000 in 
the July-September period, down 5.4% from the $369,000 median in the spring but 
up 12% from the previous summer. 
</P>
<P>
The price decline from the previous quarter was blamed on competition caused by 
the sharp increase in new housing projects and the fact that many of the homes 
that were sold during the summer were smaller and had fewer costly amenities. 
</P>
<P>
The lowest-priced new house in Orange County sold for $159,900 this summer, the 
report said. Homes in the most expensive non-custom new tract were $1,150,000.

APARTMENT LIFE: MUST LANDLORD PAY IF TENANT FORCED TO MOVE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN B. POSTEMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We rent a duplex in Westchester, and Los Angeles' rent control 
applies. Our month-to-month rental agreement says the tenancy may be terminated 
by either party with 30 days notice. "No relocation fees are applicable" was 
written in by our landlord. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby duplexes are being rapidly demolished and replaced by new apartments. It 
appears to be only a matter of time before our duplex goes. 
</P>
<P>
The question is, is a clause like this enforceable even though it appears to be 
contrary to the city rent control law, which says my family, which includes a 
minor child, is entitled to a $5,000 relocation fee? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: The clause is not enforceable because, as you said, it conflicts with 
the city's rent law. If your owner decides to demolish and asks you to leave 
the premises, you are entitled to the relocation money. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, any renter in Los Angeles who is asked to move or evicted through a 
"no-fault" eviction in which the renter is not at fault (does nothing wrong), 
is entitled to relocation fees. No-fault evictions include the following: The 
owner wants to move in his parents, children, himself or his spouse; to 
demolish the property, or when an owner seeks to permanently remove a rental 
unit from rental housing use. 
</P>
<P>
Relocation fees are paid at the rate of $5,000 a unit to the elderly, 
handicapped or families with minor children. Others get $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
Rental Owner Must Provide 'Safe' Carpet 
</P>
<P>
Q: The carpet in my Los Angeles apartment is badly worn. It was used four years 
ago when I moved in, and the owner won't replace it until I move out or a 
premium is added to the rent. Although the unit is rent controlled, shouldn't I 
expect minor maintenance such as this for wear and tear? 
</P>
<P>
A: Carpeting, like anything in a rental, must be maintained in a safe 
condition. While it may be worn, it may still be "safe." If it is, the owner is 
not obligated to replace or repair it. 
</P>
<P>
If the carpet is unsafe, for instance, has holes in it, which could cause you 
to trip and fall, the owner must do something about it. He does not, however, 
have to replace the carpet. He may repair it. And that would be "minor 
maintenance." 
</P>
<P>
If the owner opts to replace the carpet, he is entitled to a rent increase 
under L.A.'s rent law for that "capital improvement," which is what replacement 
is considered under the law. 
</P>
<P>
Landlord Can Take Action on Damages 
</P>
<P>
Q: The renter has moved out of my Los Angeles apartment. It was clean when he 
moved in but it's not clean now. The tenant also left holes in the walls of all 
of the rooms, with an extra big one in the living room ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
I also just recently paid a $79.98 plumbing bill that the plumber said was 
caused by a grease stoppage. And, finally, he broke the locks on our gate and 
broke into our garage. 
</P>
<P>
The question is, what can I do now? Do I deduct money from the security deposit 
or sue in Small Claims Court? 
</P>
<P>
A: You may deduct money from the deposit for the actual cost of the cleaning 
and to repair damages that are over and above "normal wear and tear." 
</P>
<P>
Holes in the walls resulting from renters hanging pictures and the like are 
usually considered normal wear and tear by the courts. The "big" one in the 
living room you allude to probably is not. 
</P>
<P>
Since you say it was the plumber, as an independent "expert," who ascertained 
that the drain stoppage resulted from grease, you should be safe in deducting 
the charge to unclog the drain. 
</P>
<P>
The broken gate lock and the garage break-in and any damages related to it, are 
not, obviously, considered normal wear and tear. However, unless the renter 
admitted breaking the lock or breaking into the garage, you would be 
hard-pressed to prove in Small Claims Court that he is culpable. 
</P>
<P>
You may sue this renter in Small Claims Court for any damages that exceed his 
security deposit, from which you may deduct money for the cleaning, damages and 
unpaid rent, if there was any. 
</P>
<P>
Tenant Without Bank Account Prefers Cash 
</P>
<P>
Q: I live in Arroyo Grande, near San Luis Obispo, and I have a problem. My 
lease says I must pay my rent by check or money order. I don't have a bank 
account, and getting money orders is very inconvenient and costly. Here's my 
question: Can I be evicted because I prefer to pay the rent in cash? 
</P>
<P>
A: Absent an agreement to the contrary, an owner may demand to be paid his rent 
in cash if he gives a renter some extra time to get it. There is no rule/law 
that says you cannot enter into an agreement, as you say you have done, to pay 
the rent in a form other than cash. I'd keep paying the rent by money order. 
</P>
<P>
Landlady Wants to Rent Month-to-Month 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband and I moved into our one-bedroom Glendora apartment about a year 
ago. We signed a one-year lease. Now our landlady wants to turn our lease into 
a month-to-month rental agreement. She says that if we don't sign the new 
agreement, she will evict us. Can she do that? 
</P>
<P>
If we sign the agreement, is there a chance that she could still evict us? She 
just raised the rent by $25 a month, and we're afraid that she'll continue to 
do so with this new month-to-month arrangement and no rent control in the city. 
</P>
<P>
A: The landlady can require you to move out with a 30-day notice at any time 
now that the lease has expired. She doesn't need a reason in Glendora, such as, 
"they didn't sign the new agreement," to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Don't be overly concerned with the $25 rent increase as annual rent increases 
are fairly common within the industry. If your landlady really wanted you to 
move out, she probably would not have offered you a month-to-month rental 
agreement.

COMMERICAL SCENE: NEW YORK BANKERS CHALLENGING L.A. BROKERAGES; 
</P>
<P>
COMMERCIAL SALES: EAST COAST INVESTMENT HOUSES CLOSE BIG DEALS IN CALIFORNIA BY 
SHUTTING OUT COMPETITION IN SOUTHLAND.

When CalFED Inc. decided to sell its Miracle Mile office tower this year, 
Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. was hired as the broker. 
</P>
<P>
The sellers of the Ambassador Hotel retained Morgan Stanley to unload their 
prized mid-Wilshire parcel. 
</P>
<P>
And Salomon Bros. last month sold a prime Laguna Niguel property set to become 
a high-priced resort hotel to Australian Quintex Group Chairman Christopher C. 
Skase. 
</P>
<P>
Left out of these New York investment banker deals were Los Angeles' own 
commercial real estate brokers, who are not just competing against each other 
anymore, but against the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"They're taking people in the securities business and turning them into real 
estate brokers," said Howard Sadowsky, vice president at real estate brokerage 
Julien J. Studley in Westwood. "They've certainly gotten into our pockets and 
affected the national marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Land of Opportunity 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is but one of several cities targeted by investment bankers as a 
land of opportunity for real estate brokerage. Chicago, New York, Dallas and 
Washington are on the list, too. Los Angeles, however, is attracting more New 
York deal makers than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman Sachs reports almost 20 real estate bankers at its downtown Los Angeles 
office. Another 140 are dispersed among offices in Europe, Australia and, of 
course, Asia. Goldman Sachs is credited with adding joint venture partners 
Mitsubishi Estate and Ayshire Corp. to the 777 Tower under construction at 8th 
and Figueroa streets in downtown Los Angeles; to the sale of the Dana Point 
Resort this summer in Orange County, and refinancing of the Century Plaza Hotel 
in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan Stanley employs about 85 real estate executives worldwide and brokered 
the sale of The Hotel Bel-Air and the Beverly Hills Hotel -- both at record 
prices at the time they were sold. 
</P>
<P>
"More of the major Los Angeles properties are being sold internationally," said 
John Grinch, vice president at Morgan Stanley. "What we offer is international 
financing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sellers Hold a 'Bake-Off' 
</P>
<P>
"There is going to be more of a blend between real estate and the main line of 
investment banking," he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Sellers increasingly are holding what Grinch calls a "bake-off" to decide which 
company will get to represent their building. Global connections and name 
recognition, he said, are increasingly giving his company and other investment 
bankers an edge over many local real estate brokers. 
</P>
<P>
But measuring the share of New York-based investment bankers in the Los 
Angeles-area real estate market is very tough, said Studley's Sadowsky. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that investment bankers have the contracts," he concedes, 
"but they don't know the subtleties of the market." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foreign Money Is Here 
</P>
<P>
As for marketing local commercial property abroad, he said: 
</P>
<P>
"You don't need to go to Japan to sell to the Japanese. A lot of foreign money 
is sitting right here in Los Angeles already." 
</P>
<P>
Dick C. Schnell, senior vice president at Cushman Realty in Los Angeles, 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"To succeed in sales you have to understand the local tenant market," he said. 
"Access to capital is only part of what is needed from a good broker. . . . 
Everybody thinks foreigners will buy anything at any price -- but they are very 
sophisticated." 
</P>
<P>
Most New York-based investment houses just do not have the local resources 
needed to serve the Southland market properly, Schnell insisted. And, he said, 
"New York's share of the market here hasn't been as great as they purport it to 
be." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stearns Closed Office 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Schnell said, while firms such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and 
Salomon Bros. have managed to make their mark in Los Angeles, not all their 
colleagues have been as successful. Bear Stearns Real Estate Group closed its 
Los Angeles operations this summer for lack of business. First Boston, too, has 
apparently retracted from earlier plans to claim a share of Southern 
California's hot real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers such as Grubb &amp; Ellis, Julien J. Studley and others are not 
standing by idly either. They have formed international marketing and financing 
teams for properties worth more than about $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
L.A.'s top local brokers also make it their business to court Japanese and 
European financiers so that they too can offer sellers their connections in 
exchange for a top-tier listing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shmoozing in Japan 
</P>
<P>
For example, broker John C. Cushman III, head of Cushman Realty, spends one to 
two months a year in Japan shmoozing with other executives. 
</P>
<P>
The success of New York brokers in Los Angeles will ultimately depend on who 
they hire and how they are trained, Sadowsky said. 
</P>
<P>
Investment banking houses that do not commit enough staff to the local market 
will see their share of business erode, he predicted. And, he added, ultimately 
"each player will have to decide on a well-defined market niche." 
</P>
<P>
Columbia S &amp; L Opens Wilshire at Elm 
</P>
<P>
Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association celebrated the opening of Wilshire at 
Elm this month, the first of six new Beverly Hills boutique office buildings 
being called the "Masterpiece Collection." 
</P>
<P>
Designed by architects Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, the 48,000-square-foot 
Columbia Development Partners project features three levels of high-end office 
space wrapped in black granite, limestone and stainless steel. 
</P>
<P>
The style, critics say, could best be described as "deconstructivist," with 
exposed beams and what looks like a peeled-away facade. Soon to come are the 
Wilshire at La Peer South and Wilshire at Maple buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Another project, slated for the site of the once-venerable Beverly Theater, 
remains stymied as Columbia battles in court for the rights to demolish an 
adjacent building. Blocking demolition is a Beverly Hills investment group, JPL 
Properties, that claims its rights as the now-empty building's master lessor 
are being violated by Columbia. Columbia counters that it has paid for all 
rights to the building and should be allowed to proceed. Yet another hearing on 
this dispute is scheduled for December. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, both parties were urged this month by the judge to "work it 
out among yourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Teradata Corp. Signs $100,000 Million Lease 
</P>
<P>
$100 million. That's the value being put on a 335,000-square-foot lease just 
signed by Teradata Corp. with El Segundo's Pacific Financial building at 100 N. 
Sepulveda. The 11-year lease deal is one of the biggest in Southland history 
and sure to earn a hefty commission for Jay Borzi and Steve Silk of Cushman 
&amp; Wakefield of California Inc., who represented Teradata, and John Ayoob 
and Grafton Tanquary of Coldwell Banker Commercial Real Estate Services, who 
represented landlord Pacific Financial Group. 
</P>
<P>
Also involved was Nelson T. Korchak, president of Los Angeles Realty Service 
Inc., a division of Pacific Financial. Computer maker Teradata plans to 
consolidate its growing work force next year -- relocating from three separate 
Marina del Rey buildings it currently calls home. 
</P>
<P>
$10 Million in Leases at Beverly Hills Site 
</P>
<P>
Three leases totaling more than $10 million were announced at Security Pacific 
Place, 9665 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills. New York-based stock brokerage 
Gruntal &amp; Co. Inc. signed for 15,000 square feet of offices in a 7-year 
contract worth $4.5 million. Austrian merchant bank, Osterreichische Landerbank 
will establish its first West Coast office at the building -- taking 6,000 
square feet for seven years at $2.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
And law firm Weissman &amp; Wolff renewed a 15,000 square-foot-lease for five 
years in a deal worth $3.5 million. Gruntal was represented by Julien J. 
Studley Inc. and Osterreichische Landerbank by New York brokerage Peter H. 
Friedman Ltd. Joe and Fawn Bellavia of Grubb &amp; Ellis Commercial Real Estate 
Services represented the landlord in all of the transactions, and the firm of 
Weissman &amp; Wolff. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Told Corp. Buys in Camarillo 
</P>
<P>
Developer Told Corp. has purchased 24 acres of industrial property in 
Camarillo, including a 310,000-square-foot Playtex warehouse and distribution 
facility. Playtex plans to continue occupying 77,000 square feet -- the 
remainder is up for lease at monthly rates of 35 cents to 37 cents a square 
foot. The purchase comes just as Told welcomed guests to its new offices last 
week. Headquarters for the company are now at Pacific Corporate Plaza in 
Oxnard's Channel Islands Business Center.

BUYING CARPET? BEWARE OF THIS TYPE OF PADDING; 
</P>
<P>
CONSUMER: SOME UNSCRUPULOUS DEALERS ENGAGE IN SCAMS TO DRIVE UP THE COST OF 
SO-CALLED BARGAIN MERCHANDISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Buying new carpet to enhance the resale value of your property? If you're not 
cautious, there may be more than one sort of padding in your deal. 
</P>
<P>
Insiders in the highly splintered, intensely price-conscious carpet retailing 
field call the practice "yard grabbing." It means the salesman charges you for, 
say, 80 square yards when he's installed only 70. 
</P>
<P>
This is but one of several scams that go on in the marketplace for carpet, a 
major purchase so often recommended to people planning -- sooner or later -- to 
sell their homes. The scams are driven by retailers working on narrow profit 
margins who deal with intense competition yet face scarcely any regulation. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be very leery," says Frances Kleinman, a consumer specialist for 
the Maryland attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
While few in the carpet retailing industry contend that scams are prevalent, 
most allow that they're a reality of the business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Padding the Yardage 
</P>
<P>
Misleading advertising, hidden extras in the bill and second-grade-quality 
merchandise sold as first-grade-quality are some of the ways carpet salesmen 
have of clipping corners. Of all the scams, "grabbing yardage" may be the most 
common. 
</P>
<P>
"Some dealers do indeed pad the yardage, which is sad," says Lee Horwitz, 
president of A&amp;M Carpet Inc. in Fresno, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
To the carpet shopper, a "real low-ball bid" is often a sign that something is 
amiss, Horwitz advises. 
</P>
<P>
Wall-to-wall carpet, a widely advertised commodity, is typically priced on a 
per-square-yard basis. Suppose you spot an ad touting the carpet of your choice 
on sale for $10.99 a yard at outlet A. 
</P>
<P>
Since normally you've seen the same product offered for $12.99 at outlets B, C 
and D, you rush to outlet A, believing you'll save a bale of cash when you 
recarpet your living room, dining room and stairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Needed Less Carpeting 
</P>
<P>
You commit to outlet A, and the salesman follows you home to measure. After 
mumbling something about the complex art of carpet measurement, he pulls out a 
tape and soon declares you need 112 square yards. You concur, not really 
understanding his technique, and give him a deposit. 
</P>
<P>
Turns out you really needed only 91 square yards of carpeting, the amount 
outlets B, C and D would have sold you. The cost of the extra yardage you 
bought but never received from outlet A more than canceled out any savings you 
could have achieved by shopping there. Actually, you would have been better off 
patronizing B, C or D. 
</P>
<P>
Such a practice is relatively rare, but reputable dealers, believing that the 
acts of a few in the field tarnish the reputations of many, are anxious to 
stamp it out entirely, says Robert Donnelly, general sales manager for 
Baltimore-based Carpet Fair, which operates 24 retail outlets in the 
mid-Atlantic region. 
</P>
<P>
"If I catch someone doing that, they're fired," Donnelly says of the yardage 
padding scheme. To avoid being skinned by a yard padder, Donnelly says, "forget 
about the per-square-yard price." 
</P>
<P>
What's important is the bottom-line cost after your floor area has been 
measured. If you do only a yard-to-yard price comparison in carpet showrooms, 
chances are you'll be comparing tangerines with avocados. But if you compare 
the total prices quoted by several dealers, the one who claims you need more 
yardage than you do should stand out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Checking Out Bottom Line 
</P>
<P>
Bottom-line price checking also makes sense to avoid another set of scams, 
related to misleading advertising, says Edward Korczak, executive director of 
the Chicago-based American Floor Covering Assn., the carpet retailers' trade 
group. Korczak says industry leaders are troubled by the ads used by some 
carpet retailers that offer, say, "three rooms of carpet for $298." 
</P>
<P>
"What they don't tell you is the size of the rooms or the number of square 
yards they offer for the price," Korczak says. What often happens in such cases 
is that after the carpet is installed, the homeowner is hit with a nasty cost 
overrun. When challenged, the carpet company offers this lame explanation: 
"Your rooms were larger than standard." 
</P>
<P>
Another pricing scam involves unexpected last-minute add-ons. Some dealers make 
it clear they charge extra for padding, as well as labor costs associated with 
taking up the old carpet and putting down the new. But others fail to advise 
customers of these charges until they arrive at the home on installation day. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, less reputable dealers may invent other, unusual last-minute fees, 
such as a charge for "disposal" of the used carpet. Again, the only way to 
prevent such unpleasant surprises is to insist on a final price before 
committing to the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inferior Merchandise 
</P>
<P>
Still another scam involves the sale of second-grade merchandise as top-quality 
goods. Some dealers accumulate seconds in their warehouses and, without telling 
the customer he's buying secondary quality, seek to pass them off as a great 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
Some manufacturing defects, such as dye streaks or lines, are obvious when the 
carpet is rolled out on the customer's floor. But other defects, such as 
slightly off-color carpet and carpet with loose backing, only become apparent 
later. 
</P>
<P>
"If your backing is loose, your carpet won't stay down for six months. You'll 
have an ocean," says Horwitz, the A&amp;M Carpet president. 
</P>
<P>
It's not always easy to prevent being taken advantage of by a merchant passing 
second-grade carpet as the top-of-the-line merchandise, according to carpet 
specialists. Your best bet is to check a dealer's reputation before you buy. 
Dealers who've been in business for an extended period are probably more 
protective of their reputations and less likely to attempt such tricks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Good Installation 
</P>
<P>
An established dealer could also be a better bet as the installer of your 
carpet. Don't underestimate the skill involved in good carpet installation, 
says Michael Ingel, assistant manager of Migala Carpet Inc. in Kalamazoo, Mich. 
It's demanding work and, done badly, can ruin the appearance of an otherwise 
fine product. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of quality, industry specialists strongly advocate a denser, 
heavier-weight carpet for those seeking a product that will look good for many 
years. A maxim among retailers is that carpets don't wear out, they "ugly out." 
</P>
<P>
A denser carpet is more resistant to the kind of matting and tracking that 
diminishes appearance. High-quality padding also promotes durability, not to 
mention a cushier feel under foot. 
</P>
<P>
The ability of carpets to resist staining has become an issue in the public's 
mind since the introduction of StainMaster by DuPont and other similar 
stain-resistant fibers. Recently, the Amoco Fabrics &amp; Fibers Co. started a 
nationwide campaign to promote Genesis, a polypropylene yarn it says offers 
superior stain resistance. 
</P>
<P>
Amoco insists that strict controls over the manufacture of carpets made of 
Genesis fiber guarantee their longevity. But many carpet dealers, at home with 
nylon, remain unconvinced that Genesis fiber, no matter how densely packed, 
won't mat or crush the way earlier generations of polypropylene carpet did. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Color Selection 
</P>
<P>
Assuming you plan to sell your home in the near future, an important factor to 
consider is color selection. Remember that dark carpeting, while good at 
camouflaging soil, can appear to reduce the size of your rooms. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a good idea to steer clear of unusual colors. You may be enamored of 
Kelly green, rose or purple. But there's no certainty that potential buyers of 
your property will share your taste, says Richard Engel, sales manager for 
Standard Carpet in Woodlawn, Md. 
</P>
<P>
"When in doubt," Engel says, "go with a neutral."

U.S. REMODELING OUTPACES NEW HOME CONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Americans are on a multibillion-dollar home remodeling binge that will soon 
find them spending more to fix up old houses than to build new ones, according 
to a survey released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The favorite remodeling target is the kitchen, followed by bathrooms, room 
additions and porch enclosures, according to Professional Builder magazine, 
which published the survey. 
</P>
<P>
This year Americans will spend $104.7 billion on remodeling for both 
professional and do-it-yourself projects, an economist for the magazine 
estimated. That compares to a projection of $139.7 billion for residential 
construction in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
At some point, probably in the mid-'90s, the remodeling figure will outstrip 
spending for new construction, the magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
One factor in the trend is that 60% of the homes in the United States were 
built prior to 1970. In addition many are owned by members of the post-World 
War II "baby boom" generation who have money to spend and are attached to the 
neighborhoods and schools in areas where they live. 
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, which covered a representative sample of 819 home 
owners, the average home remodeling project will cost $5,000 next year and the 
most expensive project, a room addition, will cost an average of $15,000.

FOOTLOOSE: THERE'S A BEWITCHING AIR ABOUT OLD SALEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SALEM, Mass. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The year 1692 wasn't a particularly good one around here, what with 19 women 
being hanged for witchcraft and the Rev. Cotton Mather throwing fear into much 
of New England with his rampant Puritanism. 
</P>
<P>
Cooler heads finally prevailed when Mather's father, a president of Harvard, 
condemned the practice in a religious tract of 1693. Even the fiery Cotton 
eventually recanted, and things slowly got back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
All of which hasn't kept the Salem police of today from wearing witch shoulder 
patches, a newspaper from displaying a witch on its masthead, taxis from 
emblazoning them on their doors and the high school from making covens of its 
teams by using the old sorceress as a nickname. 
</P>
<P>
From its colorful past, Salem has grown into a lovely and very cultured town, 
give or take a few witch museums. It is the home of native son Nathaniel 
Hawthorne's House of the Seven Gables and the spectacular Peabody Museum of 
maritime artifacts and Asian art. 
</P>
<P>
Just a couple of miles down the road is oh-so-affluent Marblehead, one of the 
prettiest of New England's port towns and the self-described "yachting capital 
of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: Fly United, American, USAir, TWA, Northwest or Continental to 
Boston. From there, it's 30 minutes by commuter rail to Salem. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? Allow two or three days for Salem and Marblehead, perhaps 
another couple for visiting fetching towns along the North Shore. Accommodation 
costs are moderate, fine dining the same. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: June through October are the best and busiest months here, a 
short spring rather bleak, winters only for the hardy. Halloween brings the 
witches back, along with an 11-day "Haunted Happenings" festival that's scary 
and fun. Getting around town is easy with The Hawthorne, a turn-of-the-century 
trolley (complete with history narrators) that stops at all the important 
places. We highly recommend this ride. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: Hawthorne Hotel (on the Common; $75 to $125 double) is a 
Federalist-style place with 18th-Century furnishings that was built by public 
subscription in the 1920s. Bedrooms are large, serene and have wonderful 
reproductions of period furniture. Choose between the elegant Nathaniel's 
dining room or the Tavern on the Green for your meals, the latter with lighter 
fare. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most enchanting inns we've seen lately is Marblehead's The Harbor 
Light Inn (58 Washington St.; $75-$95 B&amp;B double), an 18th-Century home 
meticulously restored, with four-posters, fireplaces, old brasswork, historical 
paintings, etchings and prints. Some rooms have a large private deck and 
Jacuzzi in the bath. There is also a rooftop walk where you may view boats 
coming and going in the harbor and the famed Marblehead Light. 
</P>
<P>
The Stepping Stone Inn (19 Washington Square North; $95-$125 B&amp;B double, 
May through October, $75-$105 March-April and November-December) is next door 
to Salem's Witch Museum and convenient to most of the town's attractions. It's 
an 1846 naval officer's home with eight bedrooms brought up to snuff with 
queen-size beds, original art and homemade quilts on the walls. Full breakfasts 
include such items as eggs Benedict, fine breads and your own silver pot of 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: You're close to the Atlantic here, and that means 
seafood that locals are almost snobs about, claiming never to have touched 
anything frozen. Cherrystone clams, lobster, halibut, scallops, sole and scrod 
are staples, with clam and fish chowders to get things rolling. 
</P>
<P>
A traditional New England clambake may be difficult to find, so watch the 
papers for church suppers and the like. There is also plenty of good Italian 
food in these parts. 
</P>
<P>
Good dining: Cherrystones (80 Newberry St. off U.S. 1) has every seafood 
imaginable. This is a large and rambling place, with wood floors and old 
Oriental carpets. Many locals have their big night out here. Try the super-rich 
lobster bisque and follow with swordfish grilled, blackened or broiled. There 
are also such dishes as smoked salmon ravioli, lobster and scallops Alfredo. 
</P>
<P>
Chase House (Pickering Wharf) is a great place for lunch right on the river 
leading to the Atlantic. Sit on a deck and feast on scallops and lobster hauled 
right off the boat to the back door. The original Chase House opened in Salem 
in 1872, and the new version is trying to bring back the magic of yesteryear. 
</P>
<P>
Two Italian restaurants in Marblehead that caught our fancy are Rosalie's (18 
Sewall St.) and Capucino's (40 Atlantic Ave.). Rosalie's features angel hair 
pasta with calamari, tomato, basil and garlic, then broiled swordfish with 
pesto butter. The fettucine melanzane and vitello Milanese also draw raves. The 
decor here is eclectic, with such items as old church pews, a wooden bar, an 
antique hutch and a marble table for serving. 
</P>
<P>
Capucino's recently was voted best Italian restaurant on the North Shore, and 
it should get another accolade for the mounds of food set before you. Choose 
from 11 kinds of veal, 16 pastas and eight seafood dishes, all with a distinct 
Italian accent. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: If you don't know anything about witches when you arrive in Salem, 
you will when you leave. Figuring out which witch house (there are three) to 
start with is your first problem. Try the Witch Museum for starters, then mount 
your broom and go from there. 
</P>
<P>
The Peabody is America's oldest continuously operated museum, housing a 
fascinating collection of ship figureheads, Polynesian masks, carvings, 
pottery, jewelry and textiles from India, Japan, Africa, China and the rest of 
Asia. Don't miss it. 
</P>
<P>
The Essex Institute, a museum housed in six old Salem homes dating to 1684, 
also has a main building with five galleries of furniture, dolls, toys, silver, 
glass, ceramics and military gear tracing the town's 18th and 19th Century 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Don't miss Hawthorne's House of the Seven Gables, built in 1668 and set in a 
complex of early homes and gardens. If you still have energy in the evening, 
take in a show at the North Shore Music Theater, where Ray Charles, Chita 
Rivera, Harry Belafonte, Jay Leno, Roy Clark and Tammy Wynette perform in 
Broadway musicals and concerts from April through December. It's a first-class 
and very professional operation from curtain to curtain. 
</P>

NEGEV DESERT REMAINS THE LAND OF BEN-GURION 
</P>

SDE-BOKER, Israel 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the sun tints the desert canyon mauve, pink, amber and gold and a breeze 
ruffles the pepper tree shading two graves, a girl picks up a stone. Gently, 
reverently, she lays it on one of the graves. She picks up another and lays it 
on the other grave. 
</P>
<P>
The "grand old man" -- David Ben-Gurion -- is buried here in his beloved Negev 
Desert overlooking the deep and abiding Zin Canyon. Paula, his American wife 
from New York City, is at his side. 
</P>
<P>
The canyon, a great cavern of jagged, scabrous boulders and craters, stretches 
miles north and south. Across the distant rim, burning sapphire skies sear 
barren, formidable hills, defying habitation. 
</P>
<P>
This is Ben-Gurion's desert. 
</P>
<P>
The grave of Israel's founding father is near Sde-Boker Kibbutz, an oasis of 
peach, fig and olive trees about 45 minutes south of Beer Sheva, capital of the 
Negev. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Beauty of Desert Flora 
</P>
<P>
A path bordered by tiered limestone winds to the site. It is adorned by plants 
from the world's major deserts, a testimony to the beauty and spirit of desert 
flora. 
</P>
<P>
Since Ben-Gurion's death, thousands from many nations have journeyed to 
Sde-Boker in tribute to the man who dared the desert to bloom. 
</P>
<P>
Ben-Gurion's grave, with its spectacular canyon view, is a top tourist 
attraction. And tourism to the Negev's canyons, craters and steep passes, 
archeological sites and new agricultural settlements has increased 200-fold. 
</P>
<P>
Beer Sheva, once a dusty, frontier town built to house immigrants while Bedouin 
camels plodded unmarked streets, is a metropolis of 120,000. The city boasts a 
chamber orchestra, a repertory theater, a municipal museum and the Ben-Gurion 
University of the Negev, where desert life and development is under constant 
study. 
</P>
<P>
On the way to Sde-Boker from Beer Sheva the landscape changes from city to 
desert, stony dry hills and flats punctuated by struggling plants only goats 
could digest. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers pass Bedouin tents with TV aerials and children scampering after 
sheep. Suddenly a grove of eucalyptus trees or field of green crops brightens 
the stark landscape. With irrigation, the Negev bears fertility. 
</P>
<P>
Sde-Boker Kibbutz was founded to raise cattle and breed horses and in 1953 was 
only a few wooden buildings and one spindly tree surrounded by barbed wire. 
</P>
<P>
When Ben-Gurion became a kibbutznik he labored in the fields. Later he became a 
shepherd; his wife Paula worked in the kitchen and nursery. 
</P>
<P>
At Sde-Boker, Ben-Gurion's former "hut" is a five-room aquamarine cottage with 
a red corrugated roof. Furnishings are simple. In the living room are a brown 
couch and four green chairs, along with a TV set and map of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
In the study his desk is glass-topped, his wooden chair uncushioned. In the 
bedroom a photo of Mahatma Gandhi hangs over his bed. He cut it from a magazine 
and framed it himself. Worn leather slippers lie on a mat; piles of assorted 
books cover a night table. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remarkable Scholar 
</P>
<P>
Not only did Ben-Gurion become a renowned leader but a remarkable scholar. In 
his permanent home in Tel Aviv, now a museum, the second floor belonged to him 
-- a tiny bedroom and four rooms containing his 20,000-volume library. 
</P>
<P>
There you'll find a staggering subject range -- the voluminous Sacred Books of 
the East, philosophy tomes, hundreds of classics, books on military history, 
Europe, America and Islam, the history of the Zionist movement and Bibles in 
many languages. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Ben-Gurion's Tel Aviv home on Ben-Gurion Boulevard (a few minutes from the 
Mediterranean) is open daily from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., Friday to 1 p.m., and 
Monday and Thursday 5 to 7 p.m. Admission free. 
</P>
<P>
Entrance to Ben-Gurion's hut at Sde-Boker also is free. The kibbutz has a snack 
bar and serves lunch. 
</P>
<P>
To tour the nearby archives of the David Ben-Gurion Research Center or the 
Blaustein International Center for Desert Studies, arrangements must be made 
through the public relations department at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, 
Beer Sheva. 
</P>
<P>
If you're in Beer Sheva on a Thursday, don't miss the bustling Bedouin market 
held weekly on Rehov Hevron opposite the wholesalers' market, from 6 a.m. to 2 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Bedouins converge to hawk beaten copperware, jewelry, embroidered camel bags, 
hand-woven rugs, ceramics, exotic spices, fruits, vegetables, grains, 
kitchenware, clothing, chickens and turkeys. 
</P>
<P>
Photo buffs will have a heyday, but many Bedouins demand at least a shekel 
(about 75 cents) per shot to pose. 
</P>
<P>
At the market you're expected to bargain. If Arabic or Hebrew isn't your 
language, English works fine. Be flexible. 
</P>
<P>
Shops in Israel generally feature a wide variety of gifts ranging from jewelry 
and diamonds to Oriental carpets, clothing, leather goods, ceramics, furs and 
antiques. 
</P>
<P>
Oriental markets and bazaars are especially good in the old cities of Jaffa and 
Jerusalem. Most stores are open daily from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 4 to 7 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Taxi and bus service are excellent, as is sherut service. The sherut taxi seats 
six or seven passengers and operates on an urban and interurban basis following 
set routes. Though slightly more expensive than buses, sheruts are quicker and 
have more room for baggage. 
</P>
<P>
Israel's airline, El Al, offers a variety of travel packages. Call (800) 
352-5786.

Tourist Office, 6380 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1700, Los Angeles 90048, (213)

HOT ON THE TRAIL OF THE RED PANTHER

DEL RIO, Tex. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The coal-black interior of the flooded 19th-Century railroad tunnel at Lake 
Amistad was eerily quiet, except for the lap of tiny river waves. We had 
paddled our boat in through a ventilation shaft, now at water level. 
</P>
<P>
The only other entrance was a small semicircle of sunshine at the tunnel's end. 
Vampire bats darted back and forth in front of the boat, silhouetted against 
the opening. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only place on the U.S. side of the Rio Grande where vampire bats 
are found," said our archeologist-guide, Joe Labadie. 
</P>
<P>
Lucky us. The bats almost made me forget the ache in my left foot. I had broken 
it an hour earlier at our first stop at Coyote Cave, on the Pecos River. 
</P>
<P>
My husband, daughter and I were in a 16-foot flat-bottom boat, accompanied by 
the Amistad National Recreation Area archeologist, on our way to what many 
scientists believe to be the oldest rock art in North America. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Panther Pictograph 
</P>
<P>
These little-known pictographs, or paintings, were created by the Pecos people 
who populated the Rio Grande, lower Pecos and Devils River canyon areas for 
9,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
There are 500 archeological sites in the park's jurisdiction, most 2,000 to 
6,000 years old. The largest and best-preserved pictographs, probably painted 
by shamans, are within a 60-square-mile area around the confluence of the three 
rivers. 
</P>
<P>
Although visitors can walk to fine examples in Seminole Canyon, some of the 
most spectacular, including drawings of a red-orange, 22-foot panther or 
mountain lion, can be reached only by boat. 
</P>
<P>
We boarded on the Pecos in the early morning chill, exhilarated by the fresh 
air and long shadows. Labadie steered us toward the mouth of the river and 
pulled up at a shallow rock shelter called Coyote or "Hands Cave" because of 
its handprints in red ocher. 
</P>
<P>
Reboarding, I missed my footing and fell, taking most of my weight on my left 
foot. I was almost sure it broke, but on the trail of the red panther, an 
injured foot wasn't going to stop me. 
</P>
<P>
As we motored deeper into the "biotic paradise," as Labadie describes the river 
system, we were surprised by the abundant wildlife on the edge of the 
Chihuahuan Desert. 
</P>
<P>
Labadie pointed out trees felled by nutria rodents, and cliff-swallow nests 
plastered to the vertical rock. 
</P>
<P>
Close to the Mexican side we drifted silently below three Great Blue Heron 
nests clinging to the canyon wall. The males, with wing spans of six feet, took 
off and circled. The females stayed with their chirping young. 
</P>
<P>
It was April and the desert was blooming in a riot of reds against the 
brilliant blue sky. In Painted Canyon, claret-cup cactus blossomed against the 
black manganese, a mineral used as paint by ancient artists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Signs of Ages Past 
</P>
<P>
Parida Cave was a typical rock shelter, where generations of Pecos people 
lived. The hanging cave is filled with their layered debris. Archeologists 
found burial sites, earth ovens where tough roots were baked for days, 
grass-lined beds, grinding stones, freshwater mussel shells, painted pebbles, 
clothing and sandals. 
</P>
<P>
As we motored into Seminole Canyon, the pier at the base of Panther Cave came 
into view. The cave, guarded by a chain link fence, is a short walk up and 
along the cliff. The red-orange panther stalks through eternity high on the 
cave wall. 
</P>
<P>
An entire culture may be recorded at Panther Cave. The curved wall, about 75 
feet by 20 feet, is covered with strange figures. 
</P>
<P>
Black and red shamans, guardians of sacred traditions, tower above figures with 
atlatls (throwing sticks). A turtle-like figure and characters decorated with 
feathers and geometric patterns defy explanation. 
</P>
<P>
Experts believe the murals are separate motifs drawn over thousands of years 
when the cave was used for rituals, and that the paintings are probably forms 
of communication. 
</P>
<P>
To reach Panther Cave, boats must be launched at the Pecos boat ramp. Boats can 
be rented at three marinas on Lake Amistad, but you need a boat trailer to get 
to the Pecos. 
</P>
<P>
For an easier introduction to rock art of the Pecos people, landlocked visitors 
can take a guided tour to Fate Bell Shelter in Seminole Canyon State Historical 
Park, which abuts the Amistad Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
The park is at the head of Seminole Canyon just off U.S. 90, 45 miles west of 
Del Rio. Walking tours, which leave at 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. every day, descend 
300 feet to the canyon floor, through purple sage and cat's claw. 
</P>
<P>
The ceiling at Fate Bell is black from the fires of centuries, and along the 
front of the shelter are depressions in the limestone used for grinding seeds. 
Like an ancient butcher block, a flat rock is laminated with solidified fat, 
where thousands of animals were cut up. 
</P>
<P>
Four shaman pictographs, one with orange antlers, look out at Seminole Canyon. 
Our guide said they were 6,000 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
The Amistad Recreation Area and Seminole Canyon are about 150 miles west of San 
Antonio via U.S. 90. 
</P>
<P>
Water skiing, swimming and scuba diving are big attractions nine months of the 
year on Lake Amistad, which has a shoreline of 850 miles. Fishing is good all 
year, especially for bass, catfish, crappie and sunfish. 
</P>
<P>
Del Rio, population 30,000, 30 miles from Seminole Canyon and 10 miles from the 
Diablo East boat ramp on Lake Amistad, has 16 motels ranging from the Del Rio 
Motor Lodge, with rooms starting at $17.95, to the Laguna Diablo Resort on Lake 
Amistad, which has one-bedroom cabins with equipped kitchens for $54.50. 
</P>
<P>
For reservations: Del Rio Motor Lodge, 1300 Avenue F, Del Rio, Tex. 78840, 
(512) 775-2486, and Laguna Diablo Resort on Lake Amistad, Box 420608, Del Rio, 
Tex. 78842, (512) 774-2422. 
</P>
<P>
Near Del Rio are seven RV campgrounds and there are six primitive campsites in 
the Amistad Recreation Area. Camping from boats also is permitted. There is one 
campsite with 31 spaces in Seminole Canyon State Historical Park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Down-Home Cooking 
</P>
<P>
Del Rio's restaurants offer what's best on the border -- barbecue, Mexican food 
and grilled steaks. For smoky, first-rate Texas-style beef and ribs, try the 
Hot Pit at the corner of Avenue 5 and East Second. 
</P>
<P>
Betty's Ranch House Cafe on Avenue F is popular for big breakfasts of grits and 
biscuits, and lunch specials such as chicken fried steak with cream gravy for 
$3.99. The wood-paneled cafe is a storehouse of Southwestern memorabilia, with 
Remington prints, old maps and collections of ceramic horses. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to cross the Rio Grande into Ciudad Acuna, Mexico. You can drive in 
without a permit, but if you don't want to take your car, leave it in a lot at 
the bridge and walk across, or take a taxi or bus. The bus also leaves from 
downtown Del Rio. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular and picturesque restaurant in Ciudad Acuna is Mrs. Crosby's on 
Calle Hidalgo among the curio stores. We also enjoyed La Macarena, near the 
corner of Madero and Juarez. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What to See 
</P>
<P>
Attractions in Del Rio include the Whitehead Memorial Museum, 1308 S. Main St., 
which occupies seven buildings, one from the 1870s. 
</P>
<P>
There is a replica of the Jersey Lily saloon and court, Judge Roy Bean's grave 
and memorabilia, a collection of early farming and transportation equipment and 
displays explaining Seminole scout activities. 
</P>
<P>
The Judge Roy Bean Visitor Center and Jersey Lily are in Langtry, 59 miles west 
of Del Rio, across the Pecos. 
</P>
<P>
The Val Verde Winery, the oldest wine-making facility in Texas, is at 139 
Qualia Drive. The building and surroundings are beautiful and the tours are 
free. 
</P>
<P>

MUSICAL PRAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barbara Malone's article ("It's the Finest Choir Music You've Never Heard," 
Oct. 15) gave me shivers and goose pimples as I reminisced about similar 
experiences in Britain's great cathedrals. Visitors can also hear fine music at 
lunchtime in many such venues, especially during summer when visiting choirs 
from other countries give recitals. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, the San Louis Obispo Vocal Arts Ensemble was one such choir 
singing in St. Giles (Edinburgh), Ripon, Norwich, Lincoln, Ely and Durham 
cathedrals. You never know -- your own hometown group may turn up on your 
itinerary by surprise.

GUIDE LINES MAKE TOURS INTO LAUGHING MATTERS; 
</P>
<P>
NEW ORLEANS: TAKING A CITY TOUR IS ABOUT THE BEST WAY TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH A 
TOWN, PARTICULARLY IF THE GUIDE IS GOOD AND CAN KEEP UP THE JOKES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB O'SULLIVAN, O'Sullivan is a travel writer based in Canoga Park. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He climbed up the steps of the bus, stood on his tiptoes and counted heads. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward he sat down, adjusted his microphone, turned up the air conditioning 
and pulled away from the curb. 
</P>
<P>
"Ya'll get comfortable, now. You gentlemen can loosen your belts, you ladies do 
the best you can. My name's Curtis Majors and I want to welcome ya'll to the 
official tour of the city of New Orleans." 
</P>
<P>
It was 98 degrees and the humidity was reportedly 97%. Even though it was 
uncomfortable, the driver made up for it with his corny routine. And he did get 
a few laughs. 
</P>
<P>
Almost everywhere we go, my wife Joyce and I take city tours. We've found that 
it's about the best way to get acquainted with a town. And if the guide is 
good, he kind of makes you feel the personality of the city itself. 
</P>
<P>
"New Orleans," our guide said, "is one of the most beautiful places the Lord 
ever made, friends. But today it is just a mite warm. To tell you the truth, 
there are better months to visit New Orleans than July." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wrong Month 
</P>
<P>
Somebody reminded him that it was August. He just guffawed. 
</P>
<P>
We were in the French Quarter when he turned a corner into a traffic jam. "I'm 
sure you'll be happy to know," he said, "that I have been rated as one of the 
10 best drivers in the country." There was some applause. 
</P>
<P>
"But unfortunately," he went on, "this is my first day in the city." 
</P>
<P>
The passengers groaned. 
</P>
<P>
Up ahead, a rental truck had pulled away from the curb and into the side of a 
van. Two men and a woman were standing in the street arguing. Our driver got 
off and walked up to the scene to see what he could do. In a few minutes he was 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, folks," he said, "there was nobody hurt, but they're working at it, now. 
I don't mean they're trying to clear up the accident; I mean they're working on 
getting somebody hurt. Ya'll should hear that argument. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd have been back sooner, but there was this dog chasing a cat and I stopped 
to watch. It's so hot out there they were both walking." 
</P>
<P>
More groans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tour de Force 
</P>
<P>
After about 20 minutes, a policeman cleared the way behind the bus and our 
driver backed down the street till we were clear of the traffic jam. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be one of the fun tours, folks. I just wish ya'll were 
younger. I'm afraid you're gonna remember most of my jokes. We're not working 
with a whole lot of new material here, you know." 
</P>
<P>
He was right about the material, some of which he'd mutter to himself and then 
laugh at. Even that was fun. "Should I tell 'em about the New Orleans coffee, 
about how you can write home with it instead of about it? Haw haw haw, that's 
funny. Naw, this bunch is too smart for an old one like that." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone agreed. 
</P>
<P>
As we passed through a section of old, beautiful and expensive homes, he said: 
"I live over there. See the big house with the columns out in front? I live 
just two doors and 15 miles past that." 
</P>
<P>
We learned about Spanish moss. (It just won't hang around trees that have any 
kind of "T.O." That's Tree Odor.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long's Louisiana 
</P>
<P>
We learned a lot about a great city. He told us about Huey Long. "Some folks 
was sorry he died before he could do all he wanted to do for Louisiana, and 
others were glad he died before he could do all he wanted to do to Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
He told us about plantation life and the Creoles and the Cajuns. Over the 
ensuing two hours we did a lot of laughing and maybe a little groaning. "Some 
of these jokes are by W. C. Fields, some by Harry Lauder and, of course, there 
are some old jokes in here, too." 
</P>
<P>
But 2 1/2 hours later, when he dropped us off at our hotel, we knew a lot more 
about New Orleans and we'd had a fun time. When he said, "Ya'll come back now," 
we told him we would and both of us meant it. 
</P>
<P>
Six days later, 200 miles north, in Baton Rouge, at the start of our tour of 
Cajun Country, a man named Henry LaFluer was our guide. As he took us through 
the outskirts of Baton Rouge, we passed what looked like the main house of a 
plantation, surrounded by an immense lawn. 
</P>
<P>
"That," said Henry, "is the house Jimmy Swaggert calls his little two-bedroom 
home." 
</P>
<P>
In Vancouver, "one of the world's cleanest cities," our tour included steam 
clocks, suspension bridges, ferry rides and a line of patter from our 
guide-driver, Mike Dixon, that kept most of us grinning a good part of the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Star of the Show 
</P>
<P>
The young man said, as far as he was concerned, that his job was to keep the 
audience awake and happy so he could show off the star of the show to the best 
advantage. The star, he said, was Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
It worked out that way, too. My wife and I remember the city, a star of the 
Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
Later when we got to Ireland, we skipped the Dublin tour, but we had guides 
through the rest of Ireland. Some we grew to like so much, it's a little hard 
to separate them from what they were showing us. 
</P>
<P>
Our first, Peter Bourke, had thick glasses and a forehead that reached to 
behind his ears. He was full of good spirits, and introduced himself and Frank, 
the bus driver. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very fine driver," said Peter, "but for the curse that's on him. He has 
a little problem with blackouts." 
</P>
<P>
There was a sharp intake of breath from a few of the passengers. 
</P>
<P>
"You see," said Peter, "when he's going to be driving a tour group he gets a 
haircut. When that happens, his hat tends to fall down over his eyes and he 
can't see a thing." 
</P>
<P>
"Not a thing," Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Irish Legends 
</P>
<P>
During the tour he introduced us to Ireland's history and her legends. "Tursty 
work, I tink me troat is getting dry." 
</P>
<P>
So we'd find a singing pub and sing a little and "have a taste" and cry a bit 
about Rose of Tralee or Danny Boy or the Wild Colonial Boy. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't drink too much. It's deadly, you know. It was drink that killed my 
cousin?" 
</P>
<P>
"It was?" 
</P>
<P>
"He was run over by a Guinness truck." 
</P>
<P>
When the tour was ending, Joyce and I went to thank Peter. He was pushing 
something into his carry-on. "Was that Joe Miller's joke book?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Over here, Joe Miller is named Des MacHale," he said. "And I'm not above 
borrowing a line or two, if it helps do the trick." 
</P>
<P>
"And what is the trick?" 
</P>
<P>
He looked surprised. "Why, it's to make you happy memories, so you want to come 
back." 
</P>
<P>
We've been back three times since then and we'll go back again. The last time, 
we met Dublin's Floozy in the Jacuzzi, but that's another story. 
</P>
<P>
And we'll be going back to New Orleans and Baton Rouge and Rome and Lucerne and 
Dublin and Vancouver and Kansas City and Paris and Chicago and . . .

DINING OUT: PORTLAND HAS A LOT MORE THAN BREAD AND BEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL LASLEY and ELIZABETH HARRYMAN, Lasley and Harryman are Beverly Hills 
free-lance writers. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PORTLAND, Ore. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Since Mesopotamian times, people have baked bread and made beer in the same 
location," said Greg Higgins, chef and manager of the B. Moloch Heathman Bakery 
and Pub in downtown Portland. "Maybe it was because you need yeast for both 
beer and bread, and yeast likes certain atmospheres." 
</P>
<P>
Beer and bread are together again at B. Moloch's, named for the 
turn-of-the-century French political cartoonist whose caricatures decorate the 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
A micro-brewery making Widmer beer occupies about a third of the warehouse-like 
space. The rest is devoted to the bakery/restaurant that offers an eclectic mix 
of breads, muffins, scones, pizzas, salads and pastas. And what bread it is -- 
full of flavor and with a great crust that comes from the wood-fired oven. 
</P>
<P>
"We use beer in many of our recipes," Higgins said, as he trimmed the excess 
pastry from several dozen calzone and slides them into the brick oven. "We make 
a slightly sour beer bread, and we use beer in our rarebits and some of our 
sauces." 
</P>
<P>
But as with most of the good restaurants in this city, the thing that really 
distinguishes the food at B. Moloch's is the use of Oregon's abundant natural 
produce. 
</P>
<P>
"The range of ingredients in Oregon eclipses even what is available in the Napa 
and Sonoma counties of California," Higgins said. "We have great lamb, seafood, 
vegetables, game meats, huckleberries and hazelnuts. The local produce is just 
superlative, including, of course, the salmon." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Salmon Runs 
</P>
<P>
The twice-yearly salmon runs in the nearby Columbia River -- usually in early 
October and late February -- are famous. But at B. Moloch's, "salmon run" has a 
special meaning. 
</P>
<P>
Every spring, Portland artist Roger Long paints a series of banners depicting 
several varieties of salmon. 
</P>
<P>
On the morning of the vernal equinox, a group of local food-lovers gathers at 
the Salmon Fountain near the Willamette River and -- each carrying a banner -- 
run nine blocks up Salmon Street to the restaurant, where Long then hangs the 
banners from the ceiling, arranging them to simulate the course of the river. 
</P>
<P>
As we breakfasted on warm bannocks, a kind of Scottish scone made with oats and 
cheese, we looked up to admire the banner over our heads. 
</P>
<P>
At the side of a beautifully depicted chinook was what looked like Japanese 
writing. Higgins told us it was actually "salmon talk," and pointed to the 
English translation that read, "Protect our cool streams for the king of 
mountain migrators -- Pacific chinook and salmon Atlantic." 
</P>
<P>
Salmon, and food in general, is taken very seriously in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
At B. Moloch, breakfast items include a smoked salmon Benedict for $7.50, a 
cheddar and hazelnut rarebit for $4.95 and freshly baked breads, muffins and 
scones. 
</P>
<P>
Calzone -- seafood, meat or vegetarian -- and pizza for $6-$8 are popular at 
lunch, and dinner specialties include grilled breast of duck with artichoke 
hearts and polenta for $13.95 and braised Oregon rabbit for $11.50. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Touch of Humor 
</P>
<P>
While B. Moloch shares the same ownership as the Heathman Hotel, the management 
is separate. However, the hotel does buy bread from the bakery and, like 
Higgins, George Tate -- executive chef at the Heathman -- operates his kitchen 
with a touch of humor and a refreshing lack of pretension. 
</P>
<P>
"We just try to present what we have naturally, in the best way we can," he 
says of the cuisine in the hotel's dining room. "We're fortunate here to have 
access to great natural ingredients -- chanterelles, salmon, oysters, crawfish. 
We generally don't use recipes; we cook by taste and use whatever fresh produce 
comes in the back door that day." 
</P>
<P>
Tate, who grew up working in his parents' restaurant in central Oregon and put 
himself through the Culinary Institute of America, incorporates Oriental and 
Mexican influences in such dishes as black bean soup with lamb sausage and 
sun-dried tomatoes and salmon glazed with Sichuan peppercorns and garlic. 
</P>
<P>
The Heathman's restaurant is among the best in the Pacific Northwest, and Tate 
is so easygoing it's easy to forget that what he creates in his kitchen is 
excellent cuisine -- creative and complex. His food has helped to make the 
Heathman Hotel Dining Room a popular place for power breakfasts and business 
lunches. Reservations are usually necessary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warhol Prints 
</P>
<P>
The stylishly contemporary dining room is hung with Andy Warhol animal prints 
and furnished in comfortable leather chairs. We began our lunch there with a 
seafood bisque redolent with the flavor of fresh tomato and topped with tender 
scallops. 
</P>
<P>
A broiled breast of Oregon chicken, aromatic from the grill, was served with 
lemon pasta and smoked ham. Fresh chinook salmon was poached and served in a 
buerre blanc with cilantro, red onion and lime. 
</P>
<P>
Accompaniments included fresh wild mushrooms that had been lightly steamed, 
baby carrots and spaghetti squash in maple syrup and butter. Lunch or dinner 
for two costs about $30-$50, about half what a similar meal would cost in New 
York or Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Another of Portland's creative chefs is Dennis Baker, whose small restaurant in 
a restored building not far from downtown is one of the most romantic dining 
places we've found. 
</P>
<P>
Cafe des Amis is intimate, with only two small, candlelight dining rooms. The 
plain white walls and sparse decor allowed us to concentrate on each other and 
the food. As we found in most Portland restaurants, there was the luxury of 
space around the tables. 
</P>
<P>
As the mushroom soup was served, the aroma of fresh, wild mushrooms filled the 
air. A salad of red leaf lettuce with a walnut dressing was crisp and had just 
the right balance of oil and vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
Next came duck with orange and green peppercorns and salmon Trois Gros, salmon 
poached in fresh stock, creme fraiche and shallots. For dessert, we had 
huckleberry tart, a seasonal specialty. The crust was crisp and flaky and the 
huckleberries were like small blueberries with a more intense flavor. Dinner 
for two, without wine, was about $50. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ship's Interior 
</P>
<P>
For a more casual meal, we tried Dan &amp; Louis Oyster Bar, near the river. In 
operation since 1907, the restaurant has an interior designed to look like the 
hull of an old sailing ship. Hundreds of plates, photographs and bric-a-brac 
decorate the pine covered walls. 
</P>
<P>
Yaquina oysters -- grown by the owners in beds in Yaquina Bay on the coast -- 
were small and flavorful, with a hint of ocean spray. The next course of fresh 
shrimp and scallops, deep-fried in a light batter, were good, but we kept 
thinking of those exceptional oysters. They cost just $6 a dozen. Entrees are 
$6-$10. 
</P>
<P>
Another Portland landmark restaurant, Jake's, is always crowded, and if you 
wait for a table be sure and ask for a booth, it will make dining a lot more 
pleasant. While waiting, you can walk a couple of blocks to Powell's book 
store, one of the largest anywhere, and browse. 
</P>
<P>
If you tire of seafood, there's Hamburger Mary's, in a tiny corner building 
downtown. The interior is festooned with odd signs, hanging plants and giant 
plastic dinosaurs. Inside is a counter and some tables, but in good weather, 
there's outdoor dining on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
Hamburger Blue came with a strong topping of blue cheese and cheddar, and 
Hamburger Mary, with melted cheddar, tomatoes, lettuce, sprouts and a special 
sauce. The hamburgers are large, full of flavor and juice and served on freshly 
baked buns. They cost $3.80-$4.60. Alas, no French fries or milk shakes. Come 
early. It's always crowded. 
</P>
<P>
Other Portland dining choices include the imaginative Bread 'n' Ink Cafe; 
Atwater's, on the 30th floor of the city's tallest building for the view, and 
Huber's Cafe for great sandwiches and atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Skyline Restaurant is a true '50s diner with a real soda fountain, and then 
there's the original Original Pancake House, where the breakfasts are huge. 
</P>
<P>
The London Grill at the Westin Benson has a harpist and still serves Steak 
Diane. The Alexis Hotel restaurant offers nice views of the Willamette River. 
</P>
<P>
Portland is also a coffee-lover's paradise. The entire downtown area is full of 
coffee bars and cafes that offer a range of freshly ground coffees, espressos 
and cappuccinos. Starbucks, in a structure that would be at home in Paris, is 
right in Pioneer Courthouse Square. It opens early for coffee, fresh rolls and 
muffins. 
</P>
<P>
Just a block away, Kobos serves coffee and cookies in a shop with brewing 
accessories and beans from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Our favorite coffee stop was at Le Panier, a French bakery near the riverfront. 
The shop has won honors as the top bakery in Portland. It carries a supply of 
freshly baked French breads in several shapes and sizes, as well as some 
excellent pastries. 
</P>
<P>
We tried a lemon charlotte that was nicely puckery with lemon flavor. This is a 
good place to stock up for a picnic by the river. Get bread and a dessert here 
and pick up other ingredients at the Yamhill Market a few blocks away at 
Yamhill and Second streets. 
</P>
<P>
You'll find that almost everything in downtown Portland is within easy walking 
distance, and there's free rapid transit in the central district. 
</P>

YOUTH BEAT: STUDENT IDENTITY CARD IS HONORED IN EAST BLOC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON, Izon is a Canadian travel journalist covering youth budget 
routes.

<TEXT>
<P>
There's good news for student travelers heading to Eastern Europe. Starting 
Jan. 1 the International Student Identity Card will, for the first time, be 
honored for reductions in a number of Eastern European countries. 
</P>
<P>
The ISIC was created so that companies offering special discounts to students 
traveling overseas could easily distinguish who was eligible for the 
reductions. Schools issue thousands of styles of cards each year, and it's all 
but impossible to distinguish the valid from the phony.

<P>
The answer was to offer a single-style identity card worldwide. The language 
varies, but the ISIC looks the same whether it's issued in Hong Kong, New York, 
Iceland or France. 
</P>
<P>
The card is endorsed by the International Assn. of Universities, which has 900 
members in 122 countries. It's expected that by the end of 1990 about 2 million 
ISIC cards will be in circulation. Even the Union of Mongolian Students has 
ordered 8,000. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 version of the ISIC also has a new look. It's a plastic, credit 
card-size photocard. This new version, which is already on sale, will remain 
valid until the end of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The weak link of the ISIC system has always been Eastern Europe. Students have 
had to buy a second card, issued by the International Union of Students, to 
take advantage of student discounts there. Now the two cards have joined 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
There will be discounts covering such areas as transportation, museums and 
accommodations in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
When buying the card in your home country you are issued a booklet that 
includes the addresses of the affiliated student travel services, along with 
outlines of some of the key discounts in the participating countries. 
</P>
<P>
For example, you'll find that Almatur, the student travel service of Poland, 
sells vouchers for $7 U.S. that are valid for a night's accommodation (with 
breakfast) in 19 Polish cities during the summer months. You don't have to make 
reservations, and unused vouchers are refundable in Polish currency. 
</P>
<P>
You'll also learn that many Eastern European countries offer special discounts 
to students for rail travel to other socialist countries. 
</P>
<P>
In Yugoslavia, student visitors are eligible for 50% discounts on museum and 
gallery entrance fees. In Hungary (now included in the popular Eurail train 
ticket system), your ISIC is honored in Budapest for a 25% discount on 
student-style accommodations and for a four-hour city tour at a reduced price 
of $3 U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Finland's student travel service, Travela, offers special budget trips from 
Helsinki to Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev during summer. 
</P>

<P>
The Museum of Broadcasting offers guests more than 10,000 "oldie" radio 
programs and about 10,000 television shows from the so-called Golden Age. It is 
the only museum of its kind in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Opened in 1975, the museum also has a massive collection of about 3,000 rare 
radio-production scripts (with handwritten alterations) available on 
microfiche. 
</P>
<P>
Shows include classic radio programs by Fred Allen, Jack Benny and Eddie 
Cantor. Television features include Jackie Gleason, Sid Caesar, Imogene Coca 
and Milton Berle. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most popular radio shows are Edward R. Murrow's "This is London" 
World War II broadcasts, former President Franklin D. Roosevelt's "Fireside 
Chats," the famous eyewitness account of the Hindenburg explosion and Arthur 
Godfrey's morning disc-jockey shows on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Top TV Choices 
</P>
<P>
Topping the TV list are such dramas as "Marty" and "Requiem for a Heavyweight," 
the NBC Symphony Orchestra concerts (under Arturo Toscanini's exacting baton) 
and the Ed Sullivan shows. Also ranked high are "Fibber McGee &amp; Molly," 
"Gunsmoke" and "Dragnet." 
</P>
<P>
Museum president Robert Batscha said: "You probably can't name a show we don't 
have. We are constantly adding several thousand hours of programming every 
year. What the public sees are copies of master tapes that are in permanent 
storage someplace else." 
</P>
<P>
The library on the third floor contains programs cross-referenced in 25 ways, 
including title, subject, cast, network and time period. 
</P>
<P>
On a first-come, first-served basis, visitors can use one of the 23 
videocassette consoles. Although there is no admission charge for the museum at 
1 East 53rd St., suggested contributions are $3 for adults and $1.50 for senior 
citizens and children. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is open Wednesday to Saturday from noon to 5 p.m., Tuesday from noon 
to 8 p.m. (closed Sunday and Monday). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Membership's Privileges 
</P>
<P>
Membership, open to everyone, gives you a priority on the consoles. You also 
receive a monthly journal of museum activities. Cost is $30 a year. People 
living outside a 50-mile radius of New York City pay $25. 
</P>
<P>
The museum has a 63-seat auditorium and two video rooms with seats for 40. 
There are often special shows or public lectures featuring famous stars and 
directors. The presentations include the work of one comedian, one writer or 
one series. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago the museum drew 1,000 people a day after several "lost" episodes 
of "The Honeymooners" were unearthed. 
</P>
<P>
To dig out such lost treasures, museum officers put up a poster listing vintage 
programs that are still being sought: 
</P>
<P>
"The Kate Smith Hour" from 1953 or 1954; Damon Runyon Memorial Fund Telethon of 
1949; opening of the 1939 New York World's Fair with President Roosevelt; 
Texaco Star Theater from June to December, 1948; first Super Bowl (1967); 
original production of Gian Carlo Menotti's opera, "Amahl and the Night 
Visitors"; Ernie Kovacs' first TV series, originating from station WPTZ in 
Philadelphia (1950-51), and some of the running banter between Bing Crosby and 
Bob Hope on various shows in the 1940s, '50s and '60s.

HER WORLD: THE EBB AND FLOW OF HISTORY ALONG THE THAMES

<TEXT>
<P>
Londoner John White has played many roles as Pan Am's man-on-the-spot at 
Heathrow Airport, aiding Sultans and chief executives and tracking the odd 
royal pet. They say his knack for problem solving is so keen that he once was 
offered a coin as a tip by a grateful Armand Hammer. 
</P>
<P>
I started a conversation with White as we stood side by side, waiting for the 
luggage carrousel to move. He politely inquired if I would be long in London. I 
said that I was sailing down the River Thames the next afternoon on my way to 
cruise the Norwegian coast. 
</P>
<P>
"Ah, on the Seabourn Pride," he said, identifying my ship. "A magnificent 
sight. She's the only one small enough to sail up the Thames. And the Tower 
Bridge opens for her." 
</P>
<P>
His face was awash with nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
"May I tell you a memory?" he asked. "When we were boys, my friends and I would 
ride seven or eight miles on our bikes to see the Tower Bridge open. It was 
always a thrill." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Breeze From River 
</P>
<P>
With just 24 hours in London, I had decided to stay in the neighborhood where 
the ship would be docked. I checked into the Tower Hotel, across the moat from 
the Tower of London and in the shadow of its Gothic namesake bridge. My room 
was efficient and convenient, with a small view of history and the river. 
</P>
<P>
After a hot bath, I walked to the Tower complex. The breeze from the river was 
an eye-opener, as were the sun-splashed turrets. Hawkers were selling souvenirs 
of the 800th anniversary of the city of London. 
</P>
<P>
Children were climbing on cannons that pointed toward the Thames. These guns 
are fired on special occasions: 62 times for the queen's birthday, 41 times for 
the birth of a royal infant. 
</P>
<P>
But now they were silent and I was glad. My ship would be tying up out in the 
Thames, a state-of-the-art beauty next to the basic gray H. M. S. Belfast, a 
hero of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
At the visitors' gate to the Tower -- around the corner and uphill from the 
infamous Traitor's Gate -- I watched two ebullient Yeoman Warders in their blue 
Tudor uniforms, emblazoned with the queen's scarlet letters: E II R. 
</P>
<P>
One beefeater had a curly black beard and ruddy cheeks. The other had a 
handlebar mustache of the red that the British call ginger. They took turns 
giving directions and posing for photographs. 
</P>
<P>
They helped a Japanese teen-ager who could not get the film to advance in her 
instant camera. They returned the salutes of schoolchildren. I remembered that 
I had a question, so I joined the line. 
</P>
<P>
According to legend -- one of my favorite sources -- the ancient Tower of 
London will fall if its ravens die out. 
</P>
<P>
"Pardon me," I said to the guard with the ginger mustache, "but how many ravens 
live here now?" 
</P>
<P>
"Nine," he replied, as he ticked them off on his glove. "Six official 
residents, two visitors at the moment and a wee one -- just hatched last month. 
Not to worry, my dear. The Tower will hold." 
</P>
<P>
As he stood there, resplendent in Her Majesty's gilt, I felt wonderfully 
secure. My home was just across the street. These guards were my neighborhood 
watch. 
</P>
<P>
If they could be entrusted with locking up the Tower and its bounty of Crown 
Jewels -- including the world's largest diamond, set in the royal scepter -- 
they could certainly protect my neck and purse. 
</P>
<P>
I left them surrounded by a family of Swiss and hiked uphill to the stone 
church called All Hallows. A church has stood on this site for 1,300 years. In 
addition to Roman pavement, it boasts of American links: William Penn was 
baptized here; John Quincy Adams was married within its walls. 
</P>
<P>
This day it was busy with youngsters pressing wax on paper in the brass rubbing 
center. A gritty-voiced matron was describing the tunnelers font, a granite 
memorial to the miners who excavated chambers in the Rock of Gibralter as a 
defense in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The hour was getting thirsty. I repaired to a neighborhood pub -- the cozy 
Dickens Inn on a cobbled courtyard by a lightship relic -- and then back to my 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
At dawn I slipped into the corridor to peek from a Thames-side window and see 
if my ship had come in. She was there, all right, nestled like a young white 
dove beside its plump, gray, war-weary mother. 
</P>
<P>
After last-minute shopping (a taxi pause for "vintage character" Delaforce port 
at the Peter Dominic wine merchant), I made for the dock. 
</P>
<P>
Excitement hung in the air like confetti. Cameras veered from the gleaming 
White Tower to the Gothic drawbridge ahead. Cheers erupted as the mighty span 
split and began to rise into parentheses of iron. 
</P>
<P>
The sleek prow of the Seabourn Pride slid through the gap. I thought of John 
White out at Heathrow, and knew why he and his boyhood pals had pedaled so 
hard.

Since the earthquake hit, our phone has been continuously busy with friends 
ringing from Europe or Japan, wanting to be reassured that we are all right, 
but we are so unharmed that I found myself a little apologetic, not able to 
repel their anxiety with a single story of personal peril. They've seen on 
television the horrendous collapsing bridge, the smashed cars, the fiery 
Victorian apartments, bodies, sobbing bystanders. We have seen neither the 
reality nor even the television -- our electricity was still out Thursday. In a 
sense, we are farther away from the disaster than they. Our situation at the 
center (luckily not the epicenter) is one of curious calm. It is odd having to 
infer peril from the agitative voices elsewhere, and hard to feel scared. 
</P>
<P>
Here on Telegraph Hill, halfway between the financial district and the Marina, 
which were both heavily damaged, nothing much happened, perhaps because 
Telegraph Hill is a rock. We were sitting companionably in the kitchen. There 
was a shaking. My husband and son, trained Californians, got up to stand in a 
doorway (leaving no room for me, as I afterward admonished). Nothing fell, but 
the cat vanished like lightning to secret cat caves. The lights went out. We 
found a battery-powered radio, and tried to hear what we had just been through. 
We opened a bottle of wine. 
</P>
<P>
I hadn't realized before that disasters don't strike, they develop. You have to 
piece them together from the fragmented reports before you know how to respond. 
There is no immediate occasion for panic, so you stand by, prepared to panic 
later, and in the meantime, feel the curious elation that an unexpected event 
seems to give everyone. Anyone who has ever been caught up in events that are 
reported in the media will have been struck by the discrepancy between being in 
them, and reading about them later. The details of the disaster, concentrated 
into words and pictures, do not communicate the feeling of boredom and 
cheerfulness that most San Franciscans seem to be feeling now. 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake came just past 5 o'clock. For a time, we marveled at the plume 
of smoke rising into the sunset sky from the flaming Marina a half-mile away. 
Some resourceful neighbors started a gasoline generator, and their lights went 
on while the rest of the city lay under gathering darkness. We opened another 
bottle of wine and decided to risk using our gas stove. We had veal scaloppine. 
When it got too dark to read by candlelight, we went to bed early like 
pioneers. By bedtime, we hadn't heard how many people had died. The big effect 
of tragedy was lost in momentary imperatives: fix dinner, check on the 
children, reassure the cat. The next day our cat, Walter, refused to come out 
from under his tablecloth cave. We wondered if he knew something we didn't. 
Outside things seemed so normal one almost resented it. 
</P>
<P>
I took a walk. Most stores were closed except in Chinatown, where an everyday 
throb of commerce reassured the dazed-looking tourists who wandered with a 
homeless air among the fruit stands and curio shops. About half the people on 
the street were Chinese, imperturbably going about their business; the rest 
were dog-walkers. The high proportion of dogs on the street lent a sense of 
feral menace, for the real significance is, of course, that no matter what 
happens, dogs must be walked. The drone of helicopters overhead recalled war, 
but the pizza place was open; it must have gas-fired ovens. No newspapers to be 
had, but people who got up early and had gone as far as the downtown bus 
station, found a little thin Chronicle with its late-breaking horror photos. 
</P>
<P>
The radio last night spoke of "bands of roving toughs," but everyone looked to 
be full of neighborly love. In the mom-and- pop grocery, a line of people 
prepared to hoard. I hoarded two cans of corned beef hash but forgot to buy 
bottled water; in any case, water still flowed freely from our tap. My Italian 
neighbor warned that the heat still portended "earthquake weather." There was a 
pleasant silence and a freedom from traffic and a cheery camaraderie among the 
people I met. Like me, all were unable to bring themselves to a sense of the 
occasion. We are in a disaster. This is a disaster area. The President is 
coming. But what on earth was he going to see? By now most of the glass had 
been swept up, windows were neatly boarded, nothing appeared out of the 
ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
I imagine this must be the experience of people in, say, Belfast or Beirut. 
From afar you wonder how anyone could live there; if you are there it must seem 
normal, like this, until the real horror comes right to your door. A column of 
smoke rises somewhere else. Distant sirens wail but nearby a pleasant air of 
good will. The festivity of disaster, a phenomenon often remarked upon. 
</P>
<P>
What good is going through a devastating earthquake if you can't quite feel it? 
On the street people stop to ask for everyone else's story, because no one has 
one of his own. But everyone knows someone who was seconds or minutes away from 
the big crack in the Bay Bridge. By midweek I have talked to four different 
friends who were on the bridge at various places and they are really 
frightened. 
</P>
<P>
But the rest of us can't shake off a bemused sense of fraudulence. We haven't 
done our share of suffering. It's more than sensation-seeking that impels us 
out here on the street talking to others. I think it's right that people want 
to share in the disaster that so narrowly missed them, as a way of making it up 
to the people who have really suffered or died, and as a gesture to fortune, in 
order to appear to her calculating eye not as a lucky person, ripe for a blow, 
but as someone who has already been through something and who should be spared 
next time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
San Francisco, 1906 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkable as it may seem, Wednesday night, while the whole city crashed and 
roared into ruin, was a quiet night. There were no crowds. There was no 
shouting and yelling. There was no hysteria, no disorder. . . . In all those 
terrible hours I saw not one woman who wept, not one man who was excited, not 
one person who was in the slightest degree panic-stricken. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the flames, throughout the night, fled tens of thousands of homeless 
ones. Some were wrapped in blankets. Others carried bundles of bedding and dear 
household treasures. Sometimes a whole family was harnessed to a carriage or 
delivery wagon that was weighted down with their possessions. Baby buggies, toy 
wagons, and go-carts were used as trucks, while every other person was dragging 
a trunk. Yet everybody was gracious. The most perfect courtesy obtained. Never 
in all San Francisco's history were her people so kind and courteous as on this 
night of terror.

October talk about the Democratic Party having one foot -- its presidential 
foot -- in the grave is hitting levels unmatched since the late 1920s, 
exceeding even the morbidity following Walter F. Mondale's 1984 defeat. And the 
odor of embalming fluid is all the stronger because so much of it is coming 
from Democrats themselves. 
</P>
<P>
But do they really understand their current circumstances? Part of the national 
Democratic malaise is a familiar myopia displayed by previous Democrats during 
similar Republican economic boom years of the Roaring '20s and the Gilded Age 
of the late-19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
The current Democratic case of the tactical and philosophic shakes has to do 
with the cumulative loss of skills and confidence over the last two decades of 
national politics. Unlike the famous Confederate general, Bedford Forrest, who 
got there "fustest with the mostest," latter-day Democrats have gotten there 
latest with the leastest. 
</P>
<P>
These disadvantages, then, suggest that perhaps we should pay less attention to 
Democrats' own self-analysis and more to where they stand amid the evolution of 
the GOP issues and stratagems that, save for Watergate, have been the winning 
national dynamic for almost a quarter-century. In some ways Democrats are 
probably worse off than they think, but other aspects of their predicament have 
a chronological silver lining of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats' central problem is that their national tide went out 21 years 
ago in a 1968 presidential election that now stacks up alongside America's 
prior national political watersheds. The enormous scope of the collapse was 
decisive -- the Democrats' share of the presidential vote dropped from 61% in 
1964 to 43% in 1968 (and then to 39% in 1972 as party fortunes soured further 
and George Wallace's 1968 third-party support lined up with Richard M. Nixon 
and the GOP). Then there is the subsequent Republican domination of the White 
House, which by January, 1993, will have run 24 years with only a four-year 
interruption. Such lopsided White House control has occurred after each past 
watershed, and has come no other way. What made the partisan upheaval confusing 
at first, of course, was the temporary 1970s dislocation of Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
But for Democratic strategists, confronting this reality is still only the 
beginning of comprehension. Their decline has, in fact, happened in stages. 
</P>
<P>
The disastrous national losses of 1968-72 were largely rooted in racial, social 
and patriotic issues -- the sort of Democratic thematic vulnerabilities 
Republicans still enjoy resurrecting with campaigns against flag-desecration 
and TV commercials about furloughed murderers. More than anything else, these 
GOP themes and Democratic failures destroyed the old New Deal coalition on the 
national level. 
</P>
<P>
Stage two came in the late 1970s, when inflation, fanned by Lyndon B. Johnson's 
1960s "borrow, don't tax" Vietnam War buildup, began to roar. All three of 
20th-Century America's big inflation waves -- during and after World Wars I, II 
and Vietnam -- originated under Democratic regimes. Worse still, they rode in 
tandem with excessive growth of government and bureaucracy, increased taxes and 
bracket creep. Attacks on the inflationary state scored heavily for 
conservatives in the 1980 elections, stoking tax-revolt fires and piling more 
wood on the funeral pyre of New Deal ideology. 
</P>
<P>
Big government's embarrassment was the private sector's opportunity under 
Ronald Reagan; tax reduction and market economics went into overdrive. Within a 
few years, converging deregulation, Horatio Alger entrepreneurialism, 
disinflation, tax cuts and soaring stock markets brought stage three, more or 
less replicating the go-go spirit and success of the two previous Republican 
capitalist heydays -- the late-19th Century and the 1920s. This threw the final 
kerosene on fires burning away the old economic and ideological self-confidence 
among Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
The result hasn't been impressive. Despite conservatives' glum assessments of 
periods like Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal and Johnson's half-baked "Great 
Society," the Democratic Party -- certainly no left or socialist party -- is 
not even a reliably liberal party. On the contrary, it is middle-class and 
capitalist enough that in times of great Republican prosperity, the Democrats 
become conformist, even me-tooish, in their intermittent courtship of business 
and finance. 
</P>
<P>
Because this is such a far cry from the Democrats' activist role under the 
Andrew Jacksons, William Jennings Bryans and Franklin D. Roosevelts, the party 
seems at these moments to have lost its soul, wandering aimlessly (and not 
quite acceptably) in the waiting rooms of Rotary clubs and stock exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
During the late 19th Century, the sole Democratic President, Grover Cleveland, 
was as conservative as his GOP predecessors, and the pattern held nearly as 
well in the 1920s. No Democratic Presidents sat in the Oval Office, but 
congressional Democrats -- just as in the 1980s -- often tried to outdo 
Republicans in proposing tax cuts for business and finance, causing cynical 
chuckles in GOP circles. 
</P>
<P>
To review these 1920s episodes after watching 1980s Democrats is to experience 
deja vu. Last year, Michael S. Dukakis proclaimed to the Democratic Convention 
that the election was about "competence, not ideology," in part because his 
chief fund-raiser, a former Republican, was collecting record sums of money in 
business and financial circles. 
</P>
<P>
That fund-raiser, Robert A. Farmer, now Democratic Party treasurer, recently 
supported giving ambassadorships to campaign contributors because, he said, a 
U.S. ambassador's secondary job is to promote U.S. business interests. And 
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) was quoted in 
one 1988 bestseller as saying, "What atmosphere do I ever expect to live in 
when I leave Congress? I want to mingle in this community of business 
activities." 
</P>
<P>
This attitude may have promoted the economy at times, and as a Democratic 
survival posture it has also displayed elements of realism. Historically, 
however, such periods have been Democratic low points, eras of lost 
philosophical moorings when even sympathizers begin to wonder if the party 
still has a future. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, that is where the Democrats are today -- enmeshed in much of the 
same me-tooism they often displayed during the 1920s. If anything, the party's 
continuing control of Congress has only strengthened its general conformity to 
the mood of the decade. The better news for the Democrats is that me-tooism has 
often characterized the darkness before the dawn. Calvin Coolidge-era 
Democrats, as well as Republicans during their own beaten, me-tooist Nelson 
Rockefeller progressive period in the mid-1960s, were actually on the threshold 
of major event-driven revivals. The mea culpas and funeral notices turned out, 
in later hindsight, to be auspicious contrarian indicators. 
</P>
<P>
The further irony is that today's national Democratic disarray may not be 
critical. If Democrats truly had to deserve national power to win it, they'd be 
in trouble; but that isn't the American way. The great watershed changes of 
U.S. national politics have been largely event-driven. After a generation or 
so, the existing presidential majority runs out of cohesion, and events -- from 
Civil War to a stock market crash and a depression -- serve to unravel the old 
coalition and force the creation of a new one. 
</P>
<P>
For Republicans, economic weakness has been the historic Achilles' heel. A 
strong Democrat might have won by tapping national nervousness in 1988 -- even 
Dukakis carried four dozen Midwestern counties that hadn't voted Democratic 
since 1964 -- and the volatile stock markets of the last 10 days serve to 
remind that 1992 or 1996 could be an opportunity in the historic Democratic 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Democrats who remember better and prouder days won't want to 
look in the mirror too often. It's not a flattering sight.

ABORTION DEBATE AT STATE LEVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even if McDowell is correct that debate of the abortion issue on a 
state-by-state basis is desirable to achieve grass-roots involvement, I find 
the entire process as absurd and wasteful as the 13th-Century obsession with 
how many angels can fit on the head of a pin. 
</P>
<P>
We can never resolve, to everyone's satisfaction, when a fetus achieves 
personhood nor under what circumstances a woman has the right to decide to 
terminate her pregnancy. These are tough moral questions which will be answered 
in different ways by persons holding different beliefs within our religiously 
diverse culture. If the Supreme Court had abided by the constitutional 
restraint separating church views from state authority, it would have upheld 
the wisdom of Roe vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
As the majority of Americans can envision some situation in which abortion 
should be allowed, the wise legislator will refuse to curtail the right of any 
woman to make her decision with whatever spiritual advice she may choose. 
</P>
<P>
Let legislators and all of us who are concerned with the right to life direct 
our energies and our tax dollars toward providing children, whom we all agree 
are persons, with their right to quality care, educational opportunities, and 
protection from abuse.

WHY NOT A POLICE CORPS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police departments in big cities are fighting a losing battle against a tide of 
drugs, violence and other crimes. Putting more cops on the streets is one way 
to cope. At the very least, the law-abiding citizens would feel safer. But it 
is precisely the big cities whose budgets are too tight to pay for bigger 
police forces. In the few cities where the dollars are available, large numbers 
of well-qualified police recruits are hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation sponsored by Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) in the Senate and Robert K. 
Dornan (R-Garden Grove) in the House would create a national Police Corps, 
patterned after the military's Reserve Officer Training Corps, to encourage 
college graduates to serve on local police departments. Under the proposal, the 
federal government would provide college scholarships for men and women who 
agreed to serve as police officers for four years after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Corps would recruit a maximum of 25,000 students a year. At full 
strength, 100,000 would participate at a federal cost of $500 million. Each of 
the 50 states would get a share, but no formula has been worked out. 
</P>
<P>
Participants, primarily high school seniors and college undergraduates, would 
be selected on a competitive basis. The students would take out 
government-insured loans of up to $10,000 a year for tuition and other costs. 
Payment would be deferred. After the students completed college, the federal 
government would repay their debt and local governments would pay their 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
During college, participants would complete two federal law-enforcement 
training programs, each lasting eight weeks. After college, they would complete 
their department's training requirements, for example a demanding session at 
the Police Academy. Functioning as sworn members of the department, they would 
earn entry-level pay, but they would not earn pension benefits and thus would 
cost a city less than other recruits. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Corps, which is based on a concept developed by Adam Walinsky, a New 
York lawyer who was once Robert F. Kennedy's chief aide, enjoys strong 
bipartisan support in Congress. Although several national police labor groups 
and management organizations approve, some big-city officers argue that the 
program is elitist and will produce officers who have no commitment to public 
safety. There will be a trade-off -- youthful enthusiasm for years of 
experience -- but the local departments can put the energetic new recruits to 
good use for as long as they stay -- and for at least four years. 
</P>
<P>
Recruiting in big cities gets harder and harder. The Police Corps would 
encourage thousands to join and reward them for their public service. It is 
well worth a try.

ABORTION DEBATE AT STATE LEVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With all the controversy going on in the press and elsewhere about women's 
right to have an abortion, there is very little thought being given to the 
probability that, within a relatively short time in history, the controversy 
will not be over the right to have one but over the government's right to make 
a woman have one -- throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
This will be the inevitable result of the burgeoning population growth 
worldwide and its effect on the pollution of our water, our air, the 
destruction of our rain forests and ozone layer, the disposal of human waste 
and the untold number of other problems that will arise as the human population 
begins to strain the Earth's ability to handle it. This may seem like a voice 
in the wilderness but don't be surprised if many of us live to see it.

I read with interest Carol McGraw's article ("Abortion Protest Cases May Swamp 
Courts," Metro, Oct. 3) but unfortunately it totally misses the point. Our 
criminal justice system is already swamped, and every day dangerous felons are 
either never arrested or never brought to trial because of this. 
</P>
<P>
The real question in the light of this situation is how Los Angeles police 
found the time to make over 800 arrests, while using arm-breaking force, of 
peaceful demonstrators and how the prosecutor's office finds the time to try 
each case. Either a judgment has been made that those who would peacefully 
sacrifice their personal freedom to save the lives of innocent babies represent 
more of a threat to you and me than the car thieves and drug pushers who they 
could have jailed otherwise, or the radical pro-abortionists who dominate our 
local political establishment are out to punish their opponents and make us all 
pay in the process. Which do you think is more likely the case?

DESIGN ARGUMENT AND EINSTEIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The letter by Dean A. Ohlman (Oct. 11), bringing up the ancient and 
long-refuted "design argument" for a creator, as an attempt to refute 
evolution, recalls to me a 45-year-old exchange of letters I had with Albert 
Einstein. 
</P>
<P>
During a shipboard discussion in the Pacific on June 9, 1945, this "design" 
argument (with others) was presented to me with the claim that the argument had 
convinced Einstein of the existence of a supernatural creator. Personally 
doubting this claim, I wrote a letter to Einstein the next day, addressed to 
Princeton University, where he then taught. 
</P>
<P>
In my letter, I pointed out among other things that "I questioned the universe 
being a design; in evolution I see an explanation of the complexity of plant 
and animal life . . . But even if there was a 'designer' that would give only a 
re-arranger, not a creator, and again assuming a designer, you are back where 
you started by being forced to admit a designer of the designer, etc., etc. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
To my surprise, I received a reply from Einstein dated July 2. Said he: ". . . 
I am astonished by the audacity to tell such lies about me. . . . Your 
counter-arguments seem to me very correct and could hardly be better 
formulated. It is always misleading to use anthropomorphical concepts in 
dealing with things outside the human sphere -- childish analogies. We have to 
admire in humility the beautiful harmony of the structure of the world -- as 
far as we can grasp it. And that is all. With best wishes, yours sincerely, A. 
Einstein." 
</P>
<P>
I fear that Mr. Ohlman suffers, as probably most people do, from a grievous 
lack of education in the history of science, if he believes that traditional 
myths of creation found in many religions should be taught in science 
departments. The primary place for the teachingof such myths should be in the 
temples and churches of the various religions which advocate them. 
</P>
<P>
However, the courts are willing for them to be taught (not advocated) in 
literature or other departments if schools and colleges wish; but few would 
agree that public schools should teach only one religion's version of creation. 
If it is to be included somewhere in the curriculum, it must in fairness teach 
what a range of religions believe on the subject: Christian, Hindu, Shinto, 
Taoist and others.

ABORTION DEBATE AT STATE LEVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I found Gary McDowell's column ("Abortion Debate Finds the Appropriate Stage," 
Op-Ed Page, Oct. 15) to be a starry-eyed view of the state legislatures' role 
in the anticipated upcoming abortion battles. The fact of the matter is that 
the majority of our legislators are upper middle-class white males who will 
never be affected by the outcome of their "moral debate." The only effect the 
outcome of this debate has on these gentleman is whether or not they keep their 
jobs. Can McDowell really believe that men who have their financial and 
political futures at stake will argue this issue on "moral" grounds? 
</P>
<P>
To say that our state legislatures are an appropriate place to hammer out this 
issue is to overlook the fact that women in this country should be as equally 
assured of their basic human rights as men are. A poor woman in Pennsylvania 
should have the same rights as a rich woman in New York, regardless of what the 
men who should, but don't, represent her believe is morally correct. 
</P>
<P>
I say let the women of this country decide, since it is they who must face the 
consequences. Let's have a special female-only referendum on this issue.

BAD DREAM UNDER A PANAMA HAT; 
</P>
<P>
NORIEGA: IF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT DID SNATCH THE GENERAL, COULD HE TURN INTO 
GEORGE BUSH'S TAR BABY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL SCHORR, Daniel Schorr is senior news analyst for National Public 
Radio in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I had a dream -- a bad one. 
</P>
<P>
In it, Manuel Noriega was turned over to the American authorities after a coup 
in Panama, flown to Miami and clapped into jail. 
</P>
<P>
At a crowded hearing the next morning, the prosecutor read the two indictments 
charging the strongman with drug trafficking and money-laundering. The 
prosecutor also asked that Noriega be held without bail. Nevertheless, the 
magistrate set bail at $5 million, which was promptly paid in cash, in 
hundred-dollar bills, by a lawyer known for defending drug kingpins. 
</P>
<P>
At a pretrial hearing, a battery of Miami, Washington and New York lawyers 
appeared and asserted that Noriega had been kidnaped in violation of Panamian 
sovereignty. The U.S. attorney presented a Justice Department opinion that 
jurisdiction of foreign states could be overridden to apprehend violators of 
American law. 
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian government charged a violation of international law, and a 
famous Harvard Law School professor volunteered to argue the case before the 
International Court of Justice in The Hague. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said 
the United States would not accept the World Court's jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Noriega, free on bail, traveled the country, with a bevy of FBI 
agents, lecturing for $25,000 a pop, giving news conferences and appearing on 
television. He broke the one-month record for number of appearances on ABC's 
"Nightline" previously held by the Rev. Jim Bakker. 
</P>
<P>
After six months of uproar, the U.S. district court judge in Miami ordered that 
the case proceed to trial. Thereupon Noriega's lawyers announced that they 
would introduce the "Ollie North defense" -- they asserted that the general's 
drug activities had been known and sanctioned at the highest levels of the 
United States government in the superior interest of combating the Sandinistas 
in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
The defense demanded that a subpoena be issued for President Bush who, as vice 
president, had met with Noriega, and they asked for the records of the CIA 
about Noriega's services for the agency and his dealings with the late 
director, William J. Casey. Several counts of the indictments were quashed when 
the CIA refused to release its files. 
</P>
<P>
A year after Noriega's capture, the court was still hearing arguments on 
whether Bush could be subpoenaed and the World Court was in preliminary 
hearings on Panama's complaint. 
</P>
<P>
By now, Noriega had his own television talk show, called "Miami Advice." Drug 
Czar William J. Bennett was a frequent guest. 
</P>
<P>
I awoke from my dream about the time President Bush was offering Noriega a 
pardon on condition he go back to Panama.

LATINO LEADERS SHOULD DECIDE WHO HAS CLAIM TO THEIR ALLEGIANCE;

<P>
The next time you attend a Cinco de Mayo ceremony, or practically any other 
public Latino celebration, don't be surprised if you think you've stumbled onto 
a beer convention. You're likely to see as many banners promoting Bud, Miller 
Lite, Corona and who knows what other brew as you are to see the Mexican or 
Puerto Rican flag. 
</P>
<P>
Those banners symbolize how Latino organizations have allowed themselves to be 
used by major beer and tobacco companies in exchange for corporate donations. 
Earlier this month, a controversial new report on the negative effects this 
alliance of convenience may have in the Latino community -- where alcohol abuse 
has long been a neglected problem -- revived the debate over whether groups 
like the League of United Latin American Citizens and the National Council of 
La Raza should take money from companies like Coors and Phillip Morris. But 
don't expect things to change any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
Among the charges made in "Marketing Disease to Hispanics" a 100-page report 
published by the Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest, is 
that increased advertising in Spanish by cigarette companies may contribute to 
an increase in lung cancer among Latinas. The report also restates the many 
grim statistics that illustrate how prevalent alcohol abuse is among Latino 
males. 
</P>
<P>
The authors of the report would prefer that Latino groups stop accepting 
financial aid from brewery and tobacco companies, but they acknowledge it won't 
be easy. They estimate Latino groups get at least $1 million a year, and 
probably more, from alcohol and tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
Like other self-help organizations that once looked to the government for 
support, Latino groups now have to get money wherever they can find it. For 
that, we can thank the Reagan Administration's penny-pinching on social 
programs, a policy President Bush seems unlikely to change any time soon. So 
the ties between Latino groups and liquor and tobacco companies are likely to 
grow stronger. 
</P>
<P>
But if it's naive to expect Latino groups to give up money they get from 
Anheuser-Busch, Philip Morris and the like, that still doesn't mean they should 
surrender themselves to their corporate benefactors. And some of the activities 
documented in the report do seem to reflect an almost ingenuous attitude on the 
part of Latino leaders. 
</P>
<P>
For example, is it really necessary for leaders of important national 
organizations like the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce to be photographed 
holding cans and bottles of Miller beer? That may get them more donations from 
Philip Morris, Miller's parent company, but it doesn't enhance the serious and 
(dare I add) sober image Latino business leaders should be trying to project. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the agreement that several Latino organizations negotiated with 
Coors a few years ago that linked company donations to increased consumption of 
its beer by Latinos. Many people criticized that pact when it was signed, 
although it seems to have worked for both sides. Latinos continue to imbibe 
Coors, and the company continues to donate about $500,000 a year to Latino 
causes. But with the growth in Latino population and buying power, their 
consumption of Coors would probably have gone up anyway. So why did otherwise 
respected Latino leaders have to become shills by seeming to declare Coors the 
"official" Latino beer? 
</P>
<P>
Again, given the financial realities, this new report is not likely to get any 
Latino group to change its policy on outside donations. But maybe it will prod 
large national organizations like LULAC, the La Raza council and the GI Forum 
to put more money into programs designed to deal with Latino health issues -- 
not just old problems like alcohol abuse, but frightening new ones like AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
As of now, only one major Latino organization deals strictly with health 
issues, the National Coalition of Hispanic Health and Human Services 
Organizations. Although it it has accepted small grants from tobacco and liquor 
companies in the past, its officers recently decided that they will no longer 
do so. One good way to make up the predictable budget shortfall would be for 
every Latino group that does accept money from a beer or cigarette company to 
set aside some funds for the health coalition. 
</P>
<P>
And if that's asking too much, here's a more modest proposal for Latino 
leaders: stop pimping booze and smokes. The leadership positions they hold -- 
not to mention their own dignity -- demands at least that much of them.

RESTAURANT REVIEW: AT LORETTA'S, THEY'RE SERIOUS ABOUT CHINESE FOOD -- AND 
DESSERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What do you say about a Chinese restaurant named Loretta's? 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't the real question. Here's the real question: What do you say about 
a Chinese restaurant -- whatever its name may be -- that makes good desserts? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the answer is mazel tov, bienvenidos and so on, unless you're someone who 
spends dinner positively looking forward to an almond cookie. Loretta's does 
bring out almond cookies at the end of the meal, fortune cookies, 
(unfortunately, with exceptionally vague and boring fortunes) and orange 
slices. But that isn't necessarily the end of the meal. 
</P>
<P>
Not at all. You can order real American desserts: a powerful bitter-chocolate 
cake, a rich lemon cake or even chocolate mousse. There are also semi-Oriental 
ice creams such as candied ginger or mango. The green tea entry stands out from 
most other green tea ice creams in town because it really tastes of tea. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, come to think of it, there's something in the name after all, something 
in the lack of reference to emperors, dragons or palaces. Maybe the same thing 
that has emboldened a Chinese restaurant to get serious about dessert is even 
behind the strict avoidance of MSG. 
</P>
<P>
Loretta's recently moved from a nearby site onto a fairly high-powered block of 
La Cienega that seems to be rejustifying the street's name as Restaurant Row. 
Two doors down is Bice Pomodoro, and across the street are King Dragon and Ed 
Debevic's. The room -- small by the standards of its famous neighbors -- is in 
the classic early-'60s steakhouse style with flagstone in the walls (now 
painted over). The chef is S.K. Ng, formerly of Chinese Friends, in Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
The food is Szechwan and Peking: in other words, the dishes Americans have 
favored in Chinese restaurants for the last 20 years or so. You can get mu shu 
anything, kung pao anything, anything with snow peas or black bean sauce or 
green pepper. Loretta's seems to do a good job on these familiar dishes. In 
particular, the ones involving spicy tomato sauce are very good, essentially 
because the kitchen makes fresh tomato sauce rather than just doctoring the 
ketchup. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the house special shrimp: crisp fried shrimp in a spicy 
sweet-and-sour sauce with hot pepper oil added (it has a spicy smell 
reminiscent of cloves.) Braised lobster in tomato-based garlic hot sauce is 
much the same thing with a more expensive crustacean, and you can get 
sweet-and-sour fish of the day in the same sort of sauce. 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of starred hot dishes on the menu, such as orange peel spicy 
beef, with a snappy, full-bodied hot sauce on the chunks of fried beef. There's 
another dish simply called spicy beef, and if it is ordered extra spicy, you 
can scarcely see the bell peppers and bamboo shoots for blackened pepper pods. 
</P>
<P>
The house specialties seem good, if not unusual. The minced chicken mixed with 
mushrooms and water chestnuts, served with hoisin sauce, which you roll up in 
lettuce taco-fashion, is everything it should be, and the crispy chicken is 
definitely crisp. There are two good dishes of fried eggplant with shredded 
chicken, one in hot sauce and the other (chiang pao eggplant) in rich brown 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Among the appetizers you find spicy pickled cabbage, a sort of mildly pickled 
cabbage salad, sweetened and made a tiny bit hot -- there's one little pepper 
pod resting on top of it. The combination appetizer platter includes nicely 
cooked vegetarian egg rolls with cabbage filling, spare ribs with the usual 
steamed taste and a good sweet-and-sour sauce, chicken satays, the usual fried 
wontons and the traditionally puffy fried shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
The list of soups is slightly longer than usual, 10 altogether, including a 
spinach soup that is steaming chicken broth with practically raw spinach 
floating in it. Egg drop soup, which I think of as a way of consuming 
cornstarch, is rather more eggy than usual at Loretta's. 
</P>
<P>
Monday through Friday special lunches are available, unfortunately 
concentrating on what are some of the duller dishes. The double-cooked pork -- 
briefly tossed with cabbage and bell pepper in a brown sauce with red pepper 
and ginger in it -- is the sort of perfunctory dish I actually stay away from 
Chinese restaurants to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, there's always dessert. I could almost imagine coming to 
Loretta's just for that chocolate cake. 
</P>
<P>
Suggested dishes: spiced cabbage, $6.50; house special shrimp, $10.95; braised 
lobster, $19.95; chocolate cake, $3.25.

PRESIDENT SEES QUAKE DEVASTATION AS SEARCH FOR BODIES CONTINUES;

<P>
Workers zeroed in on remaining bodies buried under tons of freeway concrete 
Friday and scientists pinpointed the epicenter of the mammoth earthquake 
beneath a mountain creek. President Bush toured ravaged areas to offer sympathy 
and aid. 
</P>
<P>
Damage estimates climbed to more than $5.5 billion throughout the 75-mile-long 
region. Officials declared the ornate 78-year-old Oakland City Hall unusable, 
and 26 buildings were closed indefinitely at Stanford University near Palo 
Alto, 35 miles south of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
So far, 54 bodies of quake victims have been recovered. Dozens remain listed as 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, rain and temperatures in the 30s were forecast for the 
area over the weekend. Authorities said that could hamper rescue efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on how hard the rain is. If it's not too hard we hope to be able to 
work through it," said Bob Jacobs, deputy district director of the California 
Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Rain also heightened the threat of additional landslides in the mountains north 
of Santa Cruz, where 60 homes already have been destroyed in Boulder Creek, a 
town of 6,800. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 residents were ignoring evacuation warnings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a dangerous area, but all my stuff is here. My dogs are here. I figured 
you go down with the ship. Where do you go?" said Todd Viele, 27. 
</P>
<P>
Bush walked over chunks of concrete beside the 1 1/4-mile crumpled stretch of 
Interstate 880 in Oakland where scores of people were feared entombed and 
talked with rescue workers. He said he hoped to offer encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
"I am deeply moved by this, saddened in some ways, yet very stimulated by this 
team effort," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironworker Joe Carter said the President asked him how his rescue crew felt. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him . . . we're beat, we're tired, but we're still going at it," Carter 
said. Bush "let me know the eyes of the world are on us right now." 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials worked on a program of aid as the President made his 
trip. Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner offered no price tag but said 
the federal government would take on "a very, very major role in helping 
California." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the State Department said California officials have turned down 
offers of earthquake help from 20 countries because they believe they have 
enough resources at hand. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the San Francisco Giants, participants in baseball's suspended World 
Series, visited a downtown shelter Friday to hand out souvenir balls, caps and 
T-shirts to families left homeless by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
A moderate aftershock measuring magnitude 4.0 struck near Santa Cruz at 
5:50p.m., according to the Seismagraphic Station at the University of 
California at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
The epicenter was located in the Santa Cruz mountains, but there was no 
immediate information on an exact location, and no immediate reports of damage. 
</P>
<P>
At 1:13 a.m. Friday, an aftershock of magnitude 3.9 was centered about seven 
miles southwest of Los Gatos, Berkeley seismologists said. It was felt north 
and south of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,500 aftershocks have hit since Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists roaming through mountains southeast of San Francisco pinpointed the 
epicenter of Tuesday's 5:04 p.m. killer quake in the northeast corner of the 
Nisene Marks State Park, near the top of Aptos Creek, said Joseph Cotton with 
the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park. 
</P>
<P>
That's about 57 miles from San Francisco atop the San Andreas Fault, and just 
14 miles northeast of hard-hit Santa Cruz, where 10,000 people were displaced 
from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
By late Friday, rescuers had pulled out 33 bodies from the wreckage of the 
collapsed double-deck section of Interstate 880 across the bay in Oakland. 
About 2,000 people were injured, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Searchers have found 52 cars in the lower section of the freeway, but there may 
be more still buried in the rubble, California Highway Patrol Sgt. John Silva 
said. Authorities believe there are fewer than 30 cars remaining buried with 
bodies inside, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You see a car that's crushed, a lot of debris, you usually find the people 
slumped over the steering wheel," said Alameda firefighter Matt Tunney, who 
spent the night helping remove five bodies. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd thought I'd seen everything. This is devastation, the worst disaster I've 
ever seen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One firefighter had tears in his eyes after crawling into an 18-inch-high 
opening to pull out the bodies of a 6-year-old girl and her mother. 
</P>
<P>
"It kills you. It just kills you," said the firefighter, Lee Kraft. "The adults 
are no problem. But the kids. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Five psychologists are at the scene for the rescue workers. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, authorities had estimated that 253 people were buried -- based on an 
assumption that cars stretched bumper-to-bumper on the stretch of crushed lower 
level. The third game of the World Series, which was scheduled to begin shortly 
after the quake struck, may have kept commuters by televisions rather than on 
freeways, they said. 
</P>
<P>
No new official estimate of fatalities was made. Oakland police gave estimates 
of missing people Friday varying from 97 to 167. 
</P>
<P>
Electricity was restored to about 98% of the area, utility spokesman Greg 
Pruett said. A fleet of boats assembled to ferry commuters across the San 
Francisco Bay as business got closer to normal. The main lifeline between San 
Francisco and Oakland, the Bay Bridge, was closed with a 50-foot section 
collapsed. Estimates for its reopening have grown more pessimistic, with some 
officials saying it could take as long as two months. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers hoped to use a floating crane to lift the fallen 200-ton, five-lane 
highway span onto a barge over the weekend and begin repairs, the 
transportation department said. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation to waive the $100-million cap on emergency federal highway funds 
was introduced in the U.S. Senate Friday so that California could receive extra 
money for repairing the Bay Bridge and other federal highways. 
</P>
<P>
In downtown Oakland, the quake ruined 13 commercial buildings and 1,400 
residential units, including housing for 100 elderly residents now in shelters, 
officials said. More than 200 other buildings were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Only one case of looting was reported in Oakland, however, deputy Dist. Atty. 
John Adams said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Crucial city services were moved from City Hall to the Fire Department, and 
judges were conducting routine court business in jails because of damage to the 
courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
The historic Amtrak railroad station in west Oakland incurred three big cracks 
and may have to be razed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"One more good shake and the whole thing would have come down," said Amtrak 
employee Ron Young. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Mayor Lionel Wilson estimated damages in Oakland at $1.3 billion -- not 
including the Nimitz collapse. 
</P>
<P>
At Stanford, 26 building were closed indefinitely, and university President 
Donald Kennedy said the destruction "certainly is going to add up in the many 
tens of millions of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, Mayor Art Agnos said the city's $5.9-million reserve fund has 
been depleted. 
</P>
<P>
"On paper," he said, "the city is broke." 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian said he would not hesitate to propose temporarily 
raising state sales taxes if more money is needed to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said there is precedent for such a temporary tax hike, adding that 
gasoline taxes sometimes have been increased to pay for road repairs from 
natural disasters.

FALL OF NIMITZ WAS POSSIBLY PREVENTABLE, ENGINEER SAYS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A top State Department of Transportation engineer told The Times Friday that 
technology exists -- and has existed for nearly 20 years -- that might have 
prevented the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland, where at least 33 
people were killed during Tuesday's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The engineer, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, 
contradicted Caltrans chief engineer William E. Schaefer, who has repeatedly 
claimed that no such technology exists. 
</P>
<P>
The engineer, a high-ranking seismic expert familiar with the Nimitz Freeway, 
is the first such expert within the transportation department to confirm claims 
made by private structural engineers that state highway officials failed to 
take adequate steps to strengthen roadway overpasses after the 1971 Sylmar 
quake, which collapsed freeway bridges in the San Fernando Valley and took 58 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
"The technology has been around since San Fernando," said the engineer, who 
said the freeway columns were not strengthened because of "budget limitations" 
and "priority" considerations. 
</P>
<P>
"There is only so much money," said the engineer. "You just get caught in 
trying to spread the money to where it is best used." The engineer estimated 
that it would cost $100,000 a column to strengthen the Nimitz Freeway. The 
roadway has more than 100 columns. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans is planning to bolster newer single-column freeway supports by 
wrapping the uprights with steel reinforcement bars, but Schaefer maintains 
that it is not known whether this method will work for the older 
multiple-column supports -- such as those used on the double-deck Cypress 
Viaduct of the Nimitz Freeway that collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the technical knowledge, nor does it exist anywhere in the 
world," Schaefer said earlier last week. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Schaefer said the state has developed a steel jacket that can be 
wrapped around concrete columns to provide earthquake resistance for newer 
freeways. But that technique works only on those highways that are supported by 
rows of single columns, not roadways, such as the Nimitz, that rest upon 
multiple columns, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we understood how to put those same steel jackets on the multiple-column 
structures, that probably would have worked," Schaefer said. "We don't know how 
to do that yet." 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer acknowledged that the problem of reinforcing multiple columns could 
have been solved by now -- probably preventing the collapse on the Nimitz -- if 
the department had made that dilemma its top priority after the Sylmar quake. 
</P>
<P>
But with limited funds, giving first priority to structures such as the Nimitz 
would have meant delaying another project aimed at ensuring that roadbed 
sections on other elevated highways did not separate during quakes. That 
project, recently completed, prevented the collapse of an untold number of 
freeways during the 1987 Whittier earthquake, said James Roberts, chief of 
Caltrans' structures division. 
</P>
<P>
This roadbed project, costing $53.6 million, was envisioned as the first phase 
of a larger program to strengthen highway overpasses. It entailed tying roadbed 
sections of bridges together with steel cables. Caltrans said that roadbed work 
included the Nimitz. 
</P>
<P>
A second phase, which is just beginning, called for strengthening single-column 
supports of freeway spans. Overpasses supported by multiple-column supports 
were to be done later. 
</P>
<P>
But even as the first phase of the plan neared completion in 1985, and long 
before the second phase began, Caltrans assured the public that California's 
bridges were safe. 
</P>
<P>
Ray J. Zelinski, design engineer in charge of seismic concerns and reinforced 
concrete for Caltrans, said in an Aug. 8, 1985, news story: "We feel all the 
bridges will go through an event (earthquake) without collapsing." Zelinski 
went on to say, according to the article, that even older bridges would 
withstand a catastrophic 8.3 earthquake -- more than 30 times stronger than 
Tuesday's temblor. 
</P>
<P>
"I made the quote and I don't deny it," Zelinsky said Friday. "I felt very 
confident at the time." He said that he had been instructed by superiors and 
attorneys not to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukemjian expressed anger when he learned of the the Nimitz 
Freeway collapse, and his spokesman said the governor was assured by Caltrans 
that the freeways would withstand an earthquake of Tuesday's magnitude. On 
Friday, Deukmejian's chief of staff said the governor would have ordered the 
structure closed if he had known of the danger. 
</P>
<P>
"But we were never told that," Michael R. Frost said. "There was no indication 
ever that something like this would occur. Something obviously went very, very 
wrong and we're determined to find out what it is, so we can prevent it from 
happening again." 
</P>
<P>
But the Professional Engineers in California Government said Friday in a 
scathing news release that if Deukmejian is looking for someone to blame, "he 
needn't look any further than his own bathroom mirror." 
</P>
<P>
"Year after year, Caltrans requested funding to hire the staff needed to do its 
work," said the organization, which represents state government engineers in 
salary negotiations. "Instead, the governor imposed hiring freezes and budget 
cutbacks. . . . No wonder that now, 18 years after the Sylmar quake, a . . . 
project to strengthen these bridges is only one-third complete."

PRIEST WHO FIRES NUCLEAR WEAPONS COMES TO TERMS WITH A DOUBLE LIFE 
</P>

<P>
As a nuclear test controller at the Nevada Test Site, Bob Nelson's job is to 
safely detonate the most powerful and horrifying weapons known to mankind. 
</P>
<P>
As an ordained Episcopal priest, he prays that the nuclear weapons which could 
obliterate life as it is known today never meet their intended use. 
</P>
<P>
Although other priests may lead protesters demonstrating against nuclear 
weapons, Nelson leads the teams of workers and scientists who actually explode 
the weapons deep underground at the Nevada Test Site. 
</P>
<P>
It's an unusual contradiction, Nelson admits, being "the only priest I know who 
fires nuclear weapons." 
</P>
<P>
And it's one that forces him in some way almost every day to reconcile the 
differences between his occupation and his calling. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no right or wrong answers," said Nelson, who firmly believes that 
nuclear weapons have played a role as a deterrent to war. "I would like to be 
in a situation where there are no nuclear weapons. But I would also like a 
situation where we maintain the system of freedom and justice we have in our 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, deputy manager of Nevada operations for the Energy Department, is a 
veteran of the nuclear industry, beginning his career in the Navy with a stint 
on the staff of Adm. Hyman Rickover. 
</P>
<P>
As one of three rotating test controllers at the Nevada Test Site, he has given 
the final authority for the detonation of more than 30 underground nuclear 
tests in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"People like to think you push a button to blow them up but there is no 
button," Nelson said. "It's all done by computers now." 
</P>
<P>
A relative newcomer to the priesthood, the 48-year-old father of two said he 
cast aside earlier thoughts of becoming a priest, rationalizing the task to be 
impossible because of his commitments to his work and family. 
</P>
<P>
But he finally heeded a bishop's advice that a true calling would not go away, 
and was ordained into the priesthood two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The way God works, he just doesn't follow the rules at all," Nelson said. 
"With my family, work and other commitments, I thought becoming a priest was 
something that just couldn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, a lifelong Episcopalian, was nominated into the priesthood by the 
congregation at All Saints Episcopal Church under a church canon that allows 
the elevation of parishioners to priests in remote parishes. 
</P>
<P>
It was the culmination of many years of work in the church, first in a 
Washington parish and later in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob is just an exceptional priest and a very humble person," said the Rev. 
Stewart C. Zabriskie, the church's Nevada bishop. "I wish I had more like him." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said he takes pains to separate his role as a priest from his job 
directing the testing of nuclear weapons. But he also believes his experiences 
in the weapons program have given him an insight into the everyday world that 
is useful in his role as a priest. 
</P>
<P>
"I find I can do a different kind of job in that environment because I deal 
with a lot of real-world things here that perhaps the clergy who have been 
clergy for their whole careers don't see," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson doesn't shy away from defending his beliefs on continued nuclear testing 
and he is often asked to go before anti-nuclear groups and explain the 
government's position that nuclear testing is vital to the nation's security. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think in any of these discussions I change anybody's mind or they 
change mine, but we come away from honest and direct discussions the better for 
it," Nelson said. "The best comment I ever got from one anti-nuclear activist 
was, 'I don't agree with what you're doing, but I'm glad you're the one doing 
it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Nick Aquilina, Nelson's boss and the manager of the sprawling nuclear testing 
facility, credits Nelson's honesty with allowing him to gain the respect of 
both his co-workers and the protesters on the other side of the fence. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the kind of guy I'd admire and respect whether he worked for me or was on 
the other side," Aquilina said. "I believe he comes across in a very credible 
way because he's so honest. I've never second-guessed his motives on anything 
because he's always so honest." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, Nelson said, both he and groups that oppose nuclear testing have 
the same goal in mind -- the elimination of nuclear weapons -- but go about it 
in different ways. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always probably the first person to say I would like to see a world 
without nuclear weapons," he said. "But I would also like a situation where we 
maintain the system of freedom and justice in our country." 
</P>
<P>
Zabriskie, who said the Episcopal Church has taken no firm stand on nuclear 
testing, said he views Nelson as a "bridge builder" who is able to communicate 
with both sides on an emotional issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's a peacemaker; I really do," Zabriskie said. "He takes a lot of 
risks and is very vulnerable when he stands up before the hostility of some 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson goes out of his way not to criticize anti-nuclear protesters who often 
congregate at the gates of the Nevada Test Site. Many, in fact, are his 
friends, including the wife of another Episcopal priest in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson and the priest's wife are founding board members and work closely 
together on a project to build a shelter for homeless women and children in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"We just don't talk about nuclear weapons when we're working together," Nelson 
said. "She and I have the same ultimate aim. We'd both like not to have nuclear 
weapons. The difference is how we get there."

Of all the enigmas in astronomy, the most perplexing is the invisible-mass 
mystery. Scientists now believe that more than 90% of the matter in the 
universe may be in a strange unseen form. It can't be detected directly, but 
its effects are plainly evident. 
</P>
<P>
For example, spiral galaxies (systems of stars like our Milky Way), do not 
rotate as they should. Photographs show that the density in a spiral is highest 
near the center, dropping off toward the outer fringes. The gravitational pull 
on a given star, which results from all the other stars, should therefore be 
much less in the outer regions. 
</P>
<P>
This means that stars in these regions should move slower than those closer to 
the center. But they don't. And the only explanation astronomers have come up 
with is that there is considerable mass that we can't see. 
</P>
<P>
Studies of clusters (groups) of galaxies indicate a similar problem. They don't 
have enough mass to hold them together; they should be flying apart. But they 
aren't. 
</P>
<P>
There obviously has to be a lot of invisible mass in them -- in some cases 600 
times as much as we see. Furthermore, the problem applies not only to galaxies 
and clusters, but also to the largest known structures in the cosmos -- 
super-clusters (clusters of clusters). 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet, there are difficulties with the universe itself: Without the missing 
mass, there does not appear to be enough matter to stop its expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Where and what is this "dark matter," as it is sometimes called? The problem is 
so serious that it has been given top priority in cosmology. Thousands of 
astronomers around the world are working on some aspect of it, and numerous 
candidates for dark matter have been nominated. 
</P>
<P>
The latest arrived only a few weeks ago from Harvard: electrically charged 
massive particles (CHAMPS) left over from the Big Bang that created the 
universe about 18 billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The problem first came to the attention of astronomers in 1932 when Dutch 
astronomer Jan Oort decided to measure the mass of the Milky Way. He noticed 
that stars occasionally travel high above or below its disk but are eventually 
pulled back by the combined gravitational pull of all the stars in the disk. 
</P>
<P>
By the time they get back to the center, however, they have considerable speed 
and pass right through. 
</P>
<P>
Their overall motion, therefore, is a slow oscillation about the center of the 
disk. Oort measured the speeds of the stars as a function of their distance 
above or below the center. This allowed him to determine the net force acting 
on them, and therefore the mass of the region. 
</P>
<P>
He then added the masses of the visible stars in the same region and was 
surprised when it was about 50% smaller than the overall mass. There was 
obviously a lot of matter that was not accounted for. Or, looking at it another 
way: for the amount of light visible, there was too much mass. 
</P>
<P>
About a year later Fritz Zwicky of Mt. Wilson Observatory in California began a 
similar study of a group of galaxies called the Coma Cluster. After determining 
the total mass of the cluster by measuring the motions of the galaxies within 
it, he added up the masses of the individual galaxies and found that the 
overall mass was several hundred times larger than the sum of the individual 
masses. Something was obviously wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Either there was a lot of unseen mass, or -- since mass and energy are related 
through Einstein's famous formula E=mc 22, the mass was in the form of energy 
and the cluster was in a state of explosion. Since it didn't appear to be 
exploding, Zwicky assumed that some of the mass was in an invisible form -- gas 
or dust or perhaps dim stars. 
</P>
<P>
Further progress didn't come until 1974, when a group from Princeton University 
published a computer study of galaxies. Assuming that the stars were 
distributed according to the galaxy's brightness, they concluded that spiral 
galaxies could not be stable. But there was no evidence that they were breaking 
up or flying apart. 
</P>
<P>
The only way galaxies could be stable, the researchers showed, was if they were 
surrounded by a massive halo providing sufficient gravitational pull to keep 
the stars in orbit. The halo's mass, in fact, had to be considerably greater 
than the mass of the visible material. 
</P>
<P>
Was this possible? Strangely, observations had already indicated that it might 
be. In 1969, researchers at Carnegie Institution published the results of a 
study of a nearby galaxy in the constellation Andromeda. 
</P>
<P>
Using an instrument called a spectrograph that splits the light from stars into 
its component colors, they were able to plot the speed of the stars as a 
function of their distance from the center of the galaxy, called a "rotation 
curve." 
</P>
<P>
(Determining stars' velocity through their spectra is possible because of the 
Doppler effect: When a moving object is generating waves, they tend to bunch up 
when the object is approaching and to space out as it recedes. Thus a train 
whistle sounds higher-pitched as it get nearer, and lower as it moves away. The 
same is true of light waves: The faster a star is receding, the more its 
spectral lines move toward the long-wavelength, or red side of the spectrum. 
The phenomenon is called "red shift.") 
</P>
<P>
The Carnegie scientists expected the stars to move in much the same way the 
planets in the solar system do: The farther from the sun, the weaker the 
gravitational field; thus, the outermost planets travel slower in their orbits. 
</P>
<P>
This is called Keplerian motion, after the astronomer who discovered it. But 
when their results were calculated, they found that the stars' speeds were 
equal no matter how far they were from the galaxy's center. 
</P>
<P>
But when the plot was made, they were surprised to find that they didn't. This 
was impossible unless there was considerable mass in the outer regions that 
couldn't be seen. They subsequently extended the study to many different types 
of galaxies, and in all cases the pattern was the same. 
</P>
<P>
This leads to the question: Does the entire universe contain a large amount of 
invisible matter? Maybe and maybe not. For this reason we call it the "missing 
mass," although in fact it may not be missing. 
</P>
<P>
Our universe is in a state of expansion. All galaxies are moving away from one 
another, and the farther away the faster they go. There are two possible 
outcomes: Expansion can continue, or the universe can stop and collapse back on 
itself. It all depends on the average density of matter. If it is greater than 
critical density (about one proton per cubic meter) the expansion rate of the 
universe will eventually decrease to zero, and a collapse will occur. If it is 
less, expansion will go on forever. 
</P>
<P>
Astronomers now have a good estimate for the average density of the visible 
matter in the universe, and it is only about 1% of the critical density. Even 
making allowances for matter they suspect is there but can't see directly, they 
still only have a few percentage points more. 
</P>
<P>
This suggests that the universe is "open" and will keep expanding. But a 
"closed" or collapsing universe is a more scientifically satisfying scenario to 
most astronomers. That, however, requires a lot of missing mass. 
</P>
<P>
What form does this "dark matter" take? There are several possibilities. One is 
dim stars beyond the range of telescopes. Our nearest neighbor, Proxima 
Centaurus, for example, is so dim that despite its proximity it was not 
discovered until 1915. 
</P>
<P>
It is of a type called "red dwarf" -- stars ranging in mass from about one-half 
to one-tenth the mass of the sun. (Stars are classed by the wavelength they 
emit, which in turn reflect their masses and chemical makeup. 
</P>
<P>
Lower-energy, "cool" stars tend toward the red end of the spectrum, 
high-intensity "hot" stars toward the blue. Dwarfs result from the collapse of 
larger stars, giants from expansion and cooling.) 
</P>
<P>
Large numbers of red dwarfs have been observed, and most astronomers believe 
that there are many we can't see. Indeed, the general trend throughout the 
galaxy is known to be thus: the smaller the mass of the star, the greater the 
number. In the Milky Way region of space there are almost as many red dwarfs as 
there are all other types of stars put together. But does this pattern extend 
to extremely small stars of, say, one-tenth the solar mass? Research indicates 
that the number of dim stars falls off rapidly below about one-fifth solar 
mass. 
</P>
<P>
The major problems with red dwarfs, however, is the enormous number it would 
take to account for the dark matter. Also, since red dwarfs occur along with 
brighter stars throughout the visible part of the galaxy, it is reasonable to 
assume that if they make up the halo of the galaxy, a few bright stars would 
also be present. So far, though, there is no evidence of them. 
</P>
<P>
Another candidate is the brown dwarf. Such stars, if they exist at all, range 
from about one-tenth solar mass down to slightly more than that of Jupiter. 
Since there are a large number of red dwarfs, it seems likely that there are 
also many brown dwarfs. 
</P>
<P>
There may even be more. They are not stars in the proper sense of the word, but 
gaseous clouds that weren't massive enough to become stars. They heated as they 
condensed, but their central temperature never rose high enough to trigger 
nuclear reactions. Nevertheless, the compression of the gas is sufficient to 
cause them to glow for a while. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, scientists have considerable difficulty detecting them, although 
there have been several possible sightings in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Other types of stars are also possibilities. When a star such as the sun runs 
out of fuel, it slowly collapses, eventually becoming a white dwarf -- a small, 
extremely dense object only a little larger than Earth. They are so dense that 
if they existed in large numbers, they would be excellent candidates. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 are visible within the range of our telescopes. But if this is 
typical of how they are distributed throughout our galaxy, there are only 
enough to account for about 10% of the dark matter. Then there are neutron 
stars -- smaller, even denser objects produced in the collapse of massive 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
But stars large enough to make neutron stars are rare. So are the even more 
massive stars that collapse to form another dark-matter candidate, black 
holes-entities so dense that even light cannot escape them. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the search for dark matter has turned to various exotic 
subatomic particles -- most of which exist only as mathematical concepts. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few that we know exists is the elusive neutrino, which has no charge 
and travels at or near the speed of light. It was not taken seriously for many 
years because it was assumed that, like the photon (the particle of light), it 
had zero rest mass. 
</P>
<P>
But in the mid-1970s Soviet scientists showed that it might have a small mass. 
Astronomers suddenly took another look at it. The neutrino is so abundant that 
it would make an excellent candidate. But so far, experiments haven't proved 
that it has mass. 
</P>
<P>
Other exotics include magnetic monopoles (formed in the first infinitesimal 
sub-fraction of a second of the Big Bang, each would have a mass 10 times that 
of a proton); the so-called super-symmetric particles (hypothesized to be the 
massive "super-partners" of known particles); and axions, presumed to be a 
trillion times lighter than electrons and to cluster around galaxies. So far, 
however, no one has detected any of them. 
</P>
<P>
In short, none of the candidates is satisfactory. And even in combination, they 
would account for only a small fraction of the missing matter. 
</P>
<P>
Were this not baffling enough, the cosmos contains yet another vast anomaly. 
"Echoes" of the Big Bang still reverberate through the universe in the form of 
loose photon-particles of light or other electromagnetic radiation. 
</P>
<P>
During the first half-million years of expansion, it is believed, photons were 
mixed in with everything else in the seething primordial plasma. As the 
exploding universe expanded and cooled, photons "decoupled" and flew off into 
space, leaving protons and electrons to form the elements we know today. These 
photons (the "background noise" of the universe) are easily detectable. 
</P>
<P>
And that's the problem: Point an instrument in any direction, and this 
background radiation is the same, suggesting that the universe expanded in 
perfect symmetry. Thus it follows that the distribution of galaxies should also 
be perfectly uniform. 
</P>
<P>
And so astronomers believed until the 1930s, when Fritz Zwicky showed that many 
galaxies were grouped in clusters. As the years passed, researchers found 
further asymmetries: clusters of clusters, and on a larger scale "bubbles" 
containing chains of clusters. 
</P>
<P>
But if the universe was created by smoothly uniform expansion in all 
directions, why would there be clumps of matter in certain areas and voids in 
others? The answer, again, is dark matter, which we now know to be intimately 
tied to the large-scale structure of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
It is impossible to say how this riddle will be solved. Perhaps we will need a 
new theory of gravity. Newton's laws of motion are perfectly valid for the 
everyday momentum of cars, billiard balls and rockets, but break down at the 
microcosmic level of atoms and particles. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, when we deal with huge macrocosmic structures such as galaxies -- as 
far removed from the normal dimensions of human perception as are subatomic 
particles -- it is possible that traditional laws break down there too. 
</P>
<P>
Mordehai Milgrom of Israel's Weizmann Institute believes that Newton's rules of 
gravity are invalid when attraction becomes exceedingly weak, and that a new 
definition takes care of the dark-matter problem by eliminating it. 
</P>
<P>
Or the breakthrough may be as radical as the revolution that shook physics when 
Niels Bohr's concept of the atom replaced Rutherford's earlier in this century. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, we have galaxies that do not rotate right, a universe that may be 
missing 99% of its mass and a stupendous amount to learn.

ARKANSAS TOWN WAITING FOR EPA TO CLEAN UP 'PRIORITY' WASTE SITES;

ENVIRONMENT: SOME RESIDENTS BLAME THE POLLUTION FROM THE THREE TOWN DUMPS FOR 
PHYSICAL AILMENTS. TEN YEARS AFTER AN EPA INVESTIGATION BEGAN, CLEANUP HAS YET 
TO START.

<P>
Don Bailey remembers hunting rabbits as a boy down by the town dump, how the 
frisky rabbits would jump when you sneaked up and run for half a mile. They 
made good eating. 
</P>
<P>
He also remembers swimming in nearby Lake Dupree, always curious about the 
wind-whipped orange foam that lathered its banks. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey is now 39. He is so ill he cannot work and has lost all feeling in one 
arm. His brother and sister also have strange allergies and ailments the 
doctors cannot seem to correct. 
</P>
<P>
Today the dump has a chain-link fence around it with a red sign that says: 
"KEEP OUT. HAZARDOUS WASTE AREA." As for the rabbits, Bailey remembers when 
their always reliable numbers began to dwindle and you had to walk up and kick 
one to get it to move. 
</P>
<P>
"I killed one, took it home, cut it open and it was yellow as a lemon inside," 
he recalls. "It stank." 
</P>
<P>
Jacksonville, a town of 30,000 just north of Little Rock, is the location of 
three toxic waste sites on the Environmental Protection Agency's "priority" 
list -- Superfund sites. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of drums containing waste byproducts of now-banned herbicides sit on 
a covered concrete slab where four chemical companies operated for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 10 years, since the EPA first started investigating, some of the 
town's citizens have been raising a stink of their own. They fear they are 
being poisoned by dioxin. 
</P>
<P>
Among more than 30,000 cleanup sites across the country -- including 1,194 
priority sites -- three may not seem like many. But these citizens believe that 
in a town this size it is quite a distinction, though dubious, and 10 years is 
a long time to wait to get it cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
"This town is a chemical soup," said Claudette Hazlett, "and I'm angry about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Hazlett is Bailey's sister, which would explain her anger, not to mention her 
own constant headaches and back problems. She is also vice president of a group 
called People Against a Chemically Contaminated Environment. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Jacksonville boosters say that the town has confronted its 
problem and is supporting a cleanup, and that notoriety hurts the town's image. 
</P>
<P>
"We are left with a legacy that requires remediation," said state Rep. Mike 
Wilson. "Fortunately, that contamination is confined to a very small area that 
affects no one that we can see. There's a lot of sex appeal for the media in 
dead-baby stories." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson is spokesman for a group called Jacksonville People With Pride. 
</P>
<P>
A third group, Jacksonville People With Pride Cleanup Coalition, was awarded 
three EPA grants of $50,000 to hire technical advisers to monitor cleanup at 
all three sites: Reasor-Hill Chemical Corp. and successors Hercules Powder Co., 
Transvaal Inc. and Vertac Chemical Corp. 
</P>
<P>
That is when the dispute boiled over. Hazlett's group, furious, told the EPA 
that Hercules was a member of the opposition group, People With Pride. The 
government, she maintained, would be paying a transgressor to monitor the 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
EPA withdrew the grants. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson acknowledges that Hercules was a member of People With Pride and that 
People With Pride Cleanup Coalition has many of the same members, but he says 
Hercules was not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we had told EPA from the very beginning that Hercules was a contributor 
to Jacksonville People With Pride and they knew it, I can't understand why they 
changed their mind," Wilson said. "Now that they have changed their mind, we 
are going to find out why." 
</P>
<P>
With the grants up for grabs, enter a fourth group: the Jacksonville 
Environmental Network, which encompasses Hazlett's group and others who are 
angry. That group has applied for the grants and has vowed to oppose any 
attempt by the coalition group to try again for the money by "sanitizing" its 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
At least, Hazlett said, the EPA's withdrawal of the grants should inspire 
people nationwide to fight regulatory decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The president of the coalition, Ruby Brown, said the group did indeed intend to 
use the technical advisers to play down publicity about the contamination, but 
Wilson said that is not so. 
</P>
<P>
"We have got a proven record," Wilson said. "The big picture in all this is not 
whether we or someone else receives a grant. The purpose of the grant is to 
educate and inform, and we are doing that anyway. The big picture is solving 
the problem, and that is cleaning up this chemical contamination." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, those barrels of toxic waste remain. 
</P>
<P>
MRK, an incineration firm in Zachary, La., received a contract in July to do a 
trial burn next March at the 93-acre Vertac site. If tests go well, it could 
start incinerating 2.5 million tons an hour a month later, Richard Merritt of 
the Arkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology said. 
</P>
<P>
Vertac, which began as a World War II ordnance plant, produced the herbicide 
known as Agent Orange. To incinerate about 28,000 barrels of the ingredients of 
that herbicide would take about six months, Merrill estimates. If the EPA 
judges the ash to be non-hazardous, it will be put in drums and buried in a 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson says there is no medical evidence to link the chemicals and the 
illnesses, which Hazlett concedes -- for now. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the chemicals are burned and buried, she said, it will not slow her 
crusade. She said her group plans to make a door-to-door health survey to 
document community illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
She has her own, and her brother, Don Bailey, has his, and Bailey said he had a 
friend who worked at Vertac and died of cancer. Bailey said his friend told him 
that the company sent home a letter telling his family to wash his clothes 
separately. 
</P>
<P>
But Bailey, a slight, bearded man with a useless arm, hands that tremble, 
asthma, allergies and chronic headaches, said no one ever warned him about 
swimming in the lake with the orange foam or about eating the rabbits and the 
fish he brought home for the family table. 
</P>
<P>
"They were doing this to people and they knew about it and they didn't tell the 
people about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But when he opened up a rabbit and it stank, didn't he suspect? 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't dawn on people what was what," he said. After all, those companies 
provided good jobs for good pay. 
</P>
<P>
The only other big employer in Jacksonville is an Air Force base. 
</P>
<P>
Only retribution against the polluters, it seems, will satisfy Hazlett. 
</P>
<P>
"Don's life is ruined," she said. "His future is gone. And a 
multibillion-dollar industry is reaping the profits at the expense of somebody 
like this. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's time our government officials stood up and took a stand and said: 
'That's enough.' "

NORSE CAUGHT ON HORNS OF ALCOHOL DILEMMA; 
</P>

MAKE DRINKING DIFFICULT, BUT SHOULD THEY PROFIT FROM WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO

<TEXT>
<P>
The crowds begin to gather at noon on Fridays. By 3 p.m. customers are spilling 
into the street. 
</P>
<P>
By closing time at 6 p.m. the waiting lines run into the hundreds as people try 
to buy their weekend ration of wine, beer or hard liquor at the state-run 
store. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't a matter of shortage but of government attempts to make drinking 
difficult -- and to make a lot of money in the process. 
</P>
<P>
"Swedes have a hedonistic way of drinking," said Hans Klette, a law professor 
at Lund University. "It's part of the northern culture." 
</P>
<P>
Bjorn Hibell, director of the Swedish Council for Information on Alcohol and 
Other Drugs, said: "We drink in the Scandinavian way -- not too often, but a 
lot. We drink more to get intoxicated than in other countries." 
</P>
<P>
Though Scandinavian governments try to control the consumption of alcohol, at 
the same time they profit from it through taxes that boost the price to the 
consumer to 10 times the cost. 
</P>
<P>
In Sweden, Finland and Norway, alcohol is sold legally only in state stores at 
government-set prices. Only the Soviet Union has a similar system in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Prices are meant to be prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
Finland raised liquor prices twice last year to discourage heavy drinkers, 
pushing up the cost of a bottle of Scotch to $36.40. Sales dipped briefly but 
quickly returned to normal. 
</P>
<P>
Sweden's Parliament is considering legislation to reduce the level of alcohol 
tolerated for drivers to virtually nil. The legal limit in Scandinavia already 
is lower than in most of Europe, at 0.05% alcohol in the blood. 
</P>
<P>
Courts in the three countries link fines for drunk driving to an offender's 
income. A Norwegian lawyer set the record this year after failing a breath test 
in a spot road check: He was fined $16,000. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to other countries, alcohol consumption per person is low. Finland 
rates 26th in the world, Sweden 31st and Norway 33rd. 
</P>
<P>
But Scandinavians rarely have a casual glass of wine with dinner, a cold beer 
to just quench a hot thirst or a sole pre-dinner aperitif. 
</P>
<P>
"A small percentage of the people, maybe 10%, drink about half the alcohol 
sold," Hibell said. 
</P>
<P>
Drinking is ingrained in national customs, from the protocol of a formal 
evening party to the celebrations of Crayfish Day, which falls on Aug. 10. 
</P>
<P>
On that day, Swedes wear party hats, tie red napkins below their chins, sing 
boisterous drinking songs and plunder a bowl of the small lobster-like 
shellfish. Custom dictates that each claw is washed down with a glass of 
schnapps. About 20 crayfish make a meal. 
</P>
<P>
The culture of alcohol may have its origins in the chilly climate and the long, 
dreary winters. The Vikings were said to have an affinity for mead and other 
strong drink. Some social observers say the normally shy Scandinavians need 
alcohol to open up. 
</P>
<P>
As early as the 18th Century, Sweden's King Gustav III saw liquor as a main 
source of income, and he urged drinking as an act of patriotism. In the 19th 
Century, Swedish companies often paid their workers in booze. 
</P>
<P>
Excessive drinking led to a powerful temperance movement, now 150 years old. 
Sweden imposed rationing in 1917, limiting men to three liters of spirits a 
month, women less. Ration books lasted until 1955. 
</P>
<P>
Prohibition was introduced in Norway and Finland, with as little success as it 
had in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Today, advertising alcoholic beverages is forbidden. Unlike other stores, 
liquor outlets are closed evenings and weekends. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is that alcohol shouldn't be too available or too cheap," Hibell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The cheapest Scotch is sold in Sweden at $24 for a fifth; it's $32 in Norway. 
In Finland, a bottle of good 12-year-old Scotch is now up to $60. 
</P>
<P>
Tight regulation on liquor supplies created an underground market for 
moonshine. In Norway, police arrested two men last March who claimed to be 
horse breeders but who were accused of building stills in their stalls 
producing 1,000 liters a day. 
</P>
<P>
Figures published in Sweden say about 10% of the alcohol sold is moonshine. 
</P>
<P>
Swedish statistics say 3,274 people died in 1986 from alcoholism, cirrhosis of 
the liver and other diseases in which alcohol was a probable factor. That 
figure compares to 1,256 alcohol-related deaths in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
About 9% of fatal traffic accidents are linked to drinking, according to 
figures compiled by Hibell's organization. 
</P>
<P>
There is some evidence of a long-term improvement. Surveys of drinking habits 
among conscripted soldiers show that those who reported getting drunk at least 
several times a month dropped from 68% in 1971 to 42% in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The willingness to drink at any price means enormous tax income for the 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Finland earned 8.5% of its national budget from its alcohol tax, 
almost enough to pay its entire health-care bill, including medical research. 
</P>
<P>
Sweden reckoned on $1.31 billion in alcohol revenue in its 1989 budget and 
plowed back $8.6 million to fight alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
Of the $24 a Swede pays for a bottle of whiskey, the state-owned importer takes 
$1.46 for buying, bottling, labeling and distributing the drink to the 
retailer. The state-owned retailer, Systembolaget, takes 93 cents. The rest, 
$21.61, is tax. 
</P>
<P>
Drinking habits are changing, largely due to government efforts steering people 
away from the brutally strong locally distilled spirits and vodkas to wine and 
beer. 
</P>
<P>
"We have become a wine-drinking country in the last 10 years," said Goran 
Sandberg, a director of the Wine and Spirit Corp., Sweden's state-owned 
importer. "We have grown up gastronomically." 
</P>
<P>
As the sole importer for an entire nation, the company wields power in the 
wine-making world far outstripping Sweden's comparative size. The Swedes helped 
establish Australian vineyards, buying half the wine exports of that country. 
</P>
<P>
The company boasts being the world's largest customer of wine, importing 100 
million liters a year from 27 countries. The wine is stored in caverns 
originally built as bomb shelters.

MUSLIM URGES FAITHFUL TO READ 'SATANIC VERSES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCUS ELIASON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After chants of "Allahu Akbar!" echoed in the cavernous Royal Albert Hall, the 
audience was told that passages from "The Satanic Verses" would be read aloud 
and that those who couldn't take it had two minutes to leave. 
</P>
<P>
No one stirred. Then a tall man with a white beard and skullcap took the podium 
and fired the latest salvo in the yearlong Islamic campaign against the novel 
and its Indian-born Muslim author, Salman Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
In a worldwide effort to suppress a novel they consider blasphemous, Muslims 
have rioted, burned books, gone to court and threatened to kill Rushdie. The 
author now lives in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Many who condemn him have turned to Ahmed Deedat, a 72-year-old Muslim scholar 
from South Africa with a simple message: Read the book. 
</P>
<P>
It may be a painful experience, Deedat said, but Muslims who know what the 
novel says have a much better chance of persuading Westerners their cause is 
just. 
</P>
<P>
He does not feel the blasphemy argument will persuade Westerners that "The 
Satanic Verses" should be suppressed, but he believes they would be more 
responsive if they knew what the book says about Britain, Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher and the West in general. 
</P>
<P>
To prove his point, he regaled the 6,000 Muslims in the Royal Albert Hall with 
four-letter words extracted from the 547-page novel. 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie is abusing his adopted country, Deedat declared, so the Muslim argument 
should go like this: "Admitted that Rushdie has many filthy, dirty and obscene 
things to say about Islam and its heroes and heroines; but sir, do you know 
what he has to say about you, his benefactors and protectors?" 
</P>
<P>
Deedat has an engaging, folksy manner and the voice and vigor of a man half his 
age. He argues cogently, in simple language, and has a keen eye for Western 
hypocrisies. 
</P>
<P>
Citing a newspaper report about British lawmakers demanding that American actor 
Mickey Rourke be barred from Britain for using a four-letter word to describe 
Thatcher's policies, Deedat expressed confidence they would feel the same about 
Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
Applause greeted his presentation, but at least one listener spotted an 
apparent flaw and expressed it during question time. The young man said Britain 
would not ban the book, however insulting, because its "people are tolerant." 
</P>
<P>
Another troubling matter for questioners was the death sentence imposed on 
Rushdie by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Iranian revolutionary patriarch who 
died in June. Rushdie went into hiding after Khomeini issued his declaration 
Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Deedat deflected questions on that subject, saying it required an entire 
two-hour lecture by itself. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview afterward, he said the death threat had become a political 
issue. "One group wants to take a certain stand which is against another group. 
I'm not interested in groupings. I'm interested in the best way to solve a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
To many questioners, the problem was how to interpret the death sentence. A 
young woman described hardships encountered at school because of her attempts 
to defend the Muslim attitude toward Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
Someone else suggested that Deedat is in conflict with the Koran, the Muslim 
holy book, if he did not support killing Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
The gathering underscored contrasts in modern, multicultural Britain: 
</P>
<P>
Arabic chants of "God is Great!" in a hall built as a monument to the 
traditional British way of life; young men in jeans and T-shirts kneeling on 
the lawn at the foot of the ornate Albert Memorial across the road, praying to 
Mecca; stalls selling prayer mats, Korans, alcohol-free perfumes and cassettes 
of Deedat's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
It was a placid scene, but a Muslim weekly distributed outside the Albert Hall 
had expressed the undercurrent of unease. 
</P>
<P>
"Peace-loving Muslims fear that a time shall come when the British public would 
begin to identify an average Muslim as a terrorist, and feelings of hate could 
ruin the otherwise peaceful coexistence," it said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Last February, Iran's late supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, 
called on Muslims to execute author Salman Rushdie because his novel, 'The 
Satanic Verses,' allegedly blasphemes Islam. Rushdie and his wife, who live in 
Britain, went into hiding shortly afterward, where they remain.

4 SAILORS' 118 DAYS AT SEA: SURVIVAL TALE OR HOAX? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Four sailors' survival at sea for 118 days in an upturned trimaran ranks as one 
of the world's greatest survival stories -- or one of its greatest hoaxes. 
</P>
<P>
If the tale is to be believed, the trimaran Rose-Noelle was flipped over on 
June 4 by a huge wave in a 60-knot gale three days out of New Zealand's South 
Island. It made land on Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Despite losing up to 40 pounds each, the three New Zealanders and an American 
survived the stormy southern winter in good shape -- such good shape that some 
people doubt their story. 
</P>
<P>
An official investigation into whether the sailors' story checks out -- and if 
so, why search and rescue efforts were so far astray -- is not expected to be 
completed for another three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The investigator has declined comment until his inquiry is completed. But Capt. 
Melvyn Bowen, who conducted an initial investigation, is convinced that the 
four are telling the truth. 
</P>
<P>
After visiting the wreckage on isolated Great Barrier Island north of Auckland 
where the Rose-Noelle drifted ashore, Bowen said he found convincing evidence, 
such as marine growth on the boat's topside. "Personally I don't feel it is a 
hoax," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But some questions linger. Local yachtsmen ask why, after such a long time at 
sea in appalling conditions, the men had no pressure-point or salt sores, which 
are almost universal for a long sea voyage. 
</P>
<P>
Other points baffling investigators are how two radio messages were supposedly 
received from the Rose-Noelle by another yacht after the flip and how the 
Rose-Noelle drifted from 140 miles off the east coast of New Zealand around the 
top of the island to the west coast. 
</P>
<P>
The pattern of the currents should have taken it farther east toward South 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Plausible explanations to these mysteries have been suggested and, although 
skepticism remains, it is hard to imagine a motive for a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
Skipper John Glennie has signed contracts for his story but the payments are 
hardly likely to compensate for the $145,000 loss of his 40-foot trimaran, 
which was smashed to bits on rocks. 
</P>
<P>
"All those who think it's a hoax are bloody idiots," said crewman Phillip 
Hofman. Asked if there was any conclusive evidence, he said: "Yeah, the fact 
that I know we did it and three other people did it." 
</P>
<P>
The story as they tell it is a remarkable one. 
</P>
<P>
Their 118 days adrift exactly equals the time Maurice and Maralyn Bailey of 
England spent in a tiny life raft and dinghy after their yacht was pierced by a 
whale off the Galapagos Islands in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Other than the undocumented story of a Hong Kong seaman who was reported to 
have been picked up during World War II after 133 days adrift, it is a record 
for survival at sea. 
</P>
<P>
Here is their story: 
</P>
<P>
After the boat capsized, they spent their first day trapped in the cabin. Then 
they hacked a hole in the hull and spent a nightmare four months crammed in a 
space the size of a double mattress. 
</P>
<P>
For the first month water was desperately short, augmented by soft drinks and 
meager rations. 
</P>
<P>
But after they rigged a system for collecting rain water, conditions improved 
and were considerably better, although colder, than those experienced by the 
Baileys. 
</P>
<P>
Marine growth on the boat attracted more and more fish, and a large grouper 
even swam into the cabin one day. 
</P>
<P>
"Toward the end we were eating better than you guys at home," crewman Rick 
Hellriegel told a news conference on his return. 
</P>
<P>
Glennie dived into the main cabin to retrieve more and more equipment. They had 
a gas cooker and even rigged up a barbecue on fine days. 
</P>
<P>
But relations were strained. American Jim Nalepka said tension seethed among 
the four, who barely knew each other before the voyage. He and Hellriegel said 
they never wanted to see Glennie again. Glennie said the feeling is mutual. 
</P>
<P>
Battles, not physical, were fought over half a biscuit or over who could sit on 
the well-lit side of the makeshift cabin where reading was possible. 
</P>
<P>
"At one time, one of us, I won't mention the person, was a liability, but we 
worked really hard to get that person out of that position. We thought the 
worst, you know, slitting his throat and pushing him overboard. But we did that 
in jest," Nalepka said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the friction, the four knew they had to depend on each other and 
gradually jelled into a team. Hellriegel said it was a great help just having 
the body heat of four people during freezing winter weather. 
</P>
<P>
Five or six times they were forced by the weather to stay below for days on 
end. That's when spirits sagged and tensions ran high. 
</P>
<P>
"Cabin fever, we called it. That's a real condition," Nalepka said. "Fighting 
over a half a biscuit seems trivial but no, it was too real. It was classic 
what we went through."

RESEARCHER DESIGNS TOURIST SUBMARINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three decades after he and a U.S. Navy officer set a world record by diving as 
deep in the sea as jetliners fly high in the sky, the Swiss researcher Jacques 
Piccard has designed a submarine for tourists. 
</P>
<P>
It will be launched in the spring by a private company and will offer 
passengers "an uncommon way to share the riches of the sea." 
</P>
<P>
The $4-million craft, which will seat 16 people and a crew of two, is nearing 
completion at a Swiss plant in Winterthur. 
</P>
<P>
It will be somewhat roomier than the bathyscaph Trieste that went down 32,748 
feet to Challenger Deep at the bottom of the Marianas Trench in the Pacific on 
Jan. 23, 1960, with Piccard and Lt. Don Walsh on board. 
</P>
<P>
Exploring life underwater has since filled most of the 67-year-old Piccard's 
life. He has done research for universities, governments, and the police, 
collecting marine samples and checking up on underwater pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
"We have found everything from automobile tires to aircraft down there," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He still boards his small "working sub" about twice a week, diving in Lake 
Geneva, Western Europe's largest freshwater body. 
</P>
<P>
Launched in 1979, the sub named after the Swiss scientist F.A. Forel has been 
used on scientific, industrial, and recovery missions in many European lakes as 
well as in the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
In 1969, Piccard and five other scientists spent a month exploring the Gulf 
Stream in the mesoscaph Ben Franklin, also designed by him. But he says none 
matched the experience he had on his world record dive. 
</P>
<P>
"By far the most interesting find was the fish that came floating by our 
porthole at the bottom of the Challenger Deep," he said in an interview. "We 
were astounded to find higher marine life forms down there at all." 
</P>
<P>
Having more people share the riches of the sea is an idea initiated by his 
father, Auguste Piccard, who also made scientific history in the stratosphere 
in the early 1930s, ascending 50,400 feet in a balloon of his own design. 
</P>
<P>
"I came up with the idea of sending tourists underwater and it was my father 
who designed the world's first tourist submarine," Piccard said. 
</P>
<P>
During the Swiss National Exhibition in 1964, the father's submarine carried 
more than 30,000 people to the depths of Lake Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
Jacques Piccard's new 33-ton, 40-foot PX44 has several more sophisticated 
features and more advanced electronic equipment than his father's. 
</P>
<P>
It will cruise at 3 m.p.h. and be capable of diving to 300 feet on tours of up 
to 40 minutes, Piccard said. 
</P>
<P>
Powerful searchlights and large portholes will bring the depths of the sea to 
brilliant life for the passengers entering the world of scuba divers in 
relaxed, first-class comfort. 
</P>
<P>
But for Piccard, the PX44 will also help bring greater awareness of the 
environmental threats to the world's seas. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, the more people discover the sea, the greater the chance of bringing 
marine issues into public view and the better off we will all be," he said.

PYRAMIDS PULL FAITHFUL SEEKING MYSTICAL VIBES TO EGYPT'S GIZA PLATEAU; 
</P>
<P>
OCCULT: HUNDREDS OF DEVOTEES TRAVELING TO GIZA WILL NOW HAVE TO PAY A LOT MORE 
TO GET THEIR BLAST OF PYRAMID POWER.

GIZA PLATEAU, Egypt 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some chant. Some meditate. Some dance. Some sit in the lotus position and hum. 
</P>
<P>
Every year hundreds of devotees of the occult travel to Giza Plateau near Cairo 
to absorb mystical vibes said to be trapped inside the pyramids of the Pharaohs 
Cheops, Chephren and Mycerinus. 
</P>
<P>
Pyramid power is said to cure a host of ills, give glimpses into the future, 
provide a better night's sleep, even halt aging -- all for the price of 
admission, three Egyptian pounds ($1.20). 
</P>
<P>
Until now. 
</P>
<P>
Under new rules, pyramid groupies are going to have to pay more -- a lot more. 
</P>
<P>
Zahi Hawass, Giza Plateau's director general, said groups of up to 15 now are 
allowed "to meditate or seek extrasensory powers" in the pyramids for 1,000 
Egyptian pounds ($400) and only outside normal tourist hours. Each extra 
participant pays 50 pounds ($20). 
</P>
<P>
Hawass said seven to eight groups ask permission each month to conduct seances 
inside the pyramids. Most want either to spend the night inside or to enter at 
the first rays of dawn. 
</P>
<P>
"In the U.S. and elsewhere you have a lot of people with problems, and these 
people are seeking solutions. They look to the supernatural, and they think of 
the pyramids," Hawass said. 
</P>
<P>
"But we can't let these groups interfere with tourists wanting to look at the 
pyramids from a historical or architectural standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
Hawass said the most active pyramid-visiting mystical groups in the United 
States are several from Santa Barbara, Calif., and from the Edgar Cayce 
Foundation of Virginia Beach, Va., named after the American psychic who died in 
1945. Cayce taught that the secrets of Atlantis and knowledge of the future are 
buried under the right front paw of the Sphinx at the foot of Giza Plateau. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Americans, theme cruises are organized in Europe and growing 
numbers of Japanese tours come to Giza especially to "tap pyramid power," 
Hawass said. 
</P>
<P>
"This pyramid power stuff is really big," he said. "People want to believe in 
magic, and big structures give an air of magic. I'm sure if I called myself the 
Pyramid Prophet I could have a following larger than the most famous Indian 
guru." 
</P>
<P>
Built about 4,600 years ago, the pyramids remain enigmas to scientists as well 
as to seekers of the unknown. 
</P>
<P>
The first person to enter the Great Pyramid of Cheops in post-Pharaonic times 
was the caliph of Baghdad, Abdullah al-Ma'mun, in AD 820. He forced his way in 
by heating rocks, then breaking them by pouring on vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
As generations of scientists and tourists, eccentrics and treasure hunters 
followed him, pyramid mystique grew over the ages. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most famous personality to enter in search of the occult was 
Napoleon Bonaparte, who spent the night of Aug. 12, 1799, inside Cheops' 
pyramid and emerged ashen and shaken. 
</P>
<P>
He went to his grave in 1821 without telling what he experienced. 
</P>
<P>
"No! What's the use," Napoleon was said to have told a friend. "You wouldn't 
believe me anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Hawass said many people, especially in the United States, have ideas and 
theories about the Giza pyramids, particularly Cheops' Great Pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
"They read that Cheops is made of 2.3 million blocks, each one weighing 2 1/2 
tons to 15 tons, each side at an angle of 51 degrees, 50 minutes and 35 
seconds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They think nobody on Earth could have built this. That the pyramids were built 
by people from outer space, or survivors from the lost continent of Atlantis. 
</P>
<P>
"They never look at what's attached to the pyramids, the structures, the 
organization necessary to build them, the cult of the king." 
</P>
<P>
He said more than 200 books about pyramid power have been published in the 
United States, "but fewer than half a dozen contain any science of value." 
</P>
<P>
Hawass, who has a doctorate in Egyptology from the University of Pennsylvania 
and has lectured throughout North America about the pyramids, said he had never 
heard of pyramid power until he went there in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"I was speaking to an audience in Hartford, Conn., and as I began to talk 
everyone in the front row held a pyramid above his head. I asked, 'What are you 
doing?' and they explained about power trapped inside the shape of a pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
"OK. I try to be open-minded. When I returned, I tried some experiments." 
</P>
<P>
The first was to test the theory that pyramids can preserve bodies. 
</P>
<P>
"I bought some meat and put part of it in my office, part inside Cheops. The 
meat inside my office lasted longer than inside the pyramid. That was one 
(myth) down. 
</P>
<P>
"If the ancient Egyptians knew that flesh could be preserved by placing a 
corpse under a pyramid, then why did they invent mummification?"

IOWA HAMLETS CURB RIVALRY IN CRISIS; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: SOME RURAL TOWNS ARE TEAMING UP TO FACE ECONOMIC ADVERSITY. ALTHOUGH 
THEY RETAIN THEIR SEPARATE IDENTITIES FOR SUCH TRADITIONS AS FOOTBALL GAMES, 
THEY ARE TRYING TO SHARE RESOURCES TO ATTRACT BUSINESSES AND TO HOUSE WORKERS.

<P>
When it comes to a football or basketball game, Rockwell is the enemy around 
here. But, when it comes to a more critical issue -- survival -- old rivals are 
new allies. 
</P>
<P>
These two communities have decided that united they stand, divided they fall 
into the bleak landscape of ghost towns littering America's heartland. 
</P>
<P>
So Thornton, Rockwell and five other hamlets have formed a "cluster" called the 
Area Community Commonwealth, one of a growing number of such programs in Iowa 
that aim to keep small towns alive by sharing classrooms, workers or equipment 
and pooling resources to attract business. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take a joint effort to save our schools and save our Main 
Streets," said Chris Nannenga, the commonwealth's founder. "We realized we've 
got to do something to stop our erosion. Basically, our only solution is to 
work together." 
</P>
<P>
About 17 Iowa "clusters" have been or are being formed -- one along Interstate 
80, others within counties -- to offset the 1980s' rural economic decline that 
has seen farmers lose their land, merchants lose their stores and hard-working 
people lose their dreams. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're sitting in a town of 500, and you start talking about economic and 
community development, your options are so limited," said Tim Borich, an Iowa 
State University rural development specialist working with some of the 
clusters. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're really doing is redefining what community is . . . and dispelling 
some of the fatalism. Maybe, if we work together, we can keep the boat afloat 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
The Area Community Commonwealth, the first cluster, was formed in 1986. Besides 
Thornton and Rockwell, the group's towns are Sheffield, Dougherty, Swaledale, 
Chapin and Meservey. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the communities were divided by athletic and economic rivalries, 
vying for trophies and business dollars. "There was not a sense of common 
good," Nannenga said. "It was all for you, none for me." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the towns had struggled with shrinking school enrollments, the 
domino-like closings of hardware stores, factories and taverns and the shopping 
exodus to Mason City, which is large enough to support K mart and Wal-Mart 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
"Young people left," said Gene Persons, a grocer and the commonwealth 
treasurer. "Unemployment was high. People's attitudes were down." 
</P>
<P>
It happened all across Iowa. Almost half of the gasoline stations and nearly a 
third of the state's groceries closed between 1976 and 1988, said Ken Stone, an 
Iowa State economist. 
</P>
<P>
One big obstacle is that most small towns do not have enough money to hire 
experts to lure industry or enough voters to wield much political influence. 
</P>
<P>
The commonwealth towns' separate populations, for example, range from 128 to 
about 1,200. But, as a group, 6,500 people "give us a little more leverage to 
be listened to in the Legislature," Persons said. 
</P>
<P>
The group's biggest coup was last year's 60th birthday celebration for Mickey 
Mouse, organized with the Walt Disney Co. A much-publicized giant silhouette of 
Mickey's head, visible from the air, was created by meticulous surveying and 
planting in a 530-acre corn and oat field between Sheffield and Dougherty. 
Transcontinental airline pilots pointed it out to their surprised passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Disney worked with the towns to hold a two-day party in August in Sheffield, 
which drew 45,000 people. The commonwealth netted about $48,000 in profits from 
T-shirts and hats and other concessions. 
</P>
<P>
Other projects are much smaller, such as a grade-sharing program in which two 
school districts exchange junior high and high school students, filling 
classrooms and saving money. 
</P>
<P>
Two towns share a police officer, and some small retail outlets have set up 
satellite stores so residents do not have to travel 20 miles to get film 
developed or buy vegetables or hardware. 
</P>
<P>
There's no more Us vs. Them. 
</P>
<P>
"We've turned a win-lose situation into a win-win situation," Nannenga said. 
</P>
<P>
An industrial park was established in Rockwell in 1988 and a small 
water-bottling company has opened, receiving a $30,000 loan from a $50,000 
state grant that the commonwealth received. A company that makes equipment that 
picks up recyclable products is considering moving there. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't handle the industries that are going to employ 150 to 200 people," 
Nannenga admitted. "We don't have the housing. We don't have the 
infrastructure. We may not be able to sell washing machines, but we can fix 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Practicality is an important part of a cluster's success, said Kathy Beery, 
Iowa's rural development coordinator. "If you have some unrealistic goals, it's 
going to be very frustrating. You don't want to come together just because 
you're desperate. Perhaps there's some natural resource they can build on . . . 
or perhaps some existing business." 
</P>
<P>
Five communities in a cluster north of Des Moines are doing that, developing a 
nature trail-biking corridor.

BENJAMIN B. SMITH, 82; LAWYER AND PHILANTHROPIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Benjamin B. Smith, a retired lawyer, industrialist, philanthropist and art 
collector who started out in business at age 8 by hawking ice cream to patrons 
of the opera in St. Louis, died Friday night in his Beverly Hills home, his 
family said. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who put himself through college and law school on the proceeds of a 
bicycle factory he established in his teen years, prospered in real estate in 
Missouri and retired to Southern California at age 40 in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
He owned movie theaters, produced an early television series, "Dangerous 
Assignment," arranged land development deals and put together an electronics 
conglomerate, Monogram Precision Industries. He retired for the second time in 
1961 to devote much of his time to good works including the Watts Writers 
Workshop and the Interracial Business Council, which was set up after the Watts 
riots of 1965. 
</P>
<P>
He was one of the first three volunteers for the International Executive 
Service Corps, a private group that was established during the Administration 
of President Lyndon B. Johnson as a business counterpart of the Peace Corps. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who had taken part in big and small business deals in Los Angeles, said 
at the time that he "became bored playing golf three or four times a week and 
started looking for something that I could get involved in." 
</P>
<P>
He counseled businessmen in Ethiopia, Uganda, Pakistan and Israel, where he 
traveled with his wife, Dorothy Jane Smith. She died in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The Smiths donated large portions of their collection of modern art to the 
National Gallery in Washington and to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 
where they sponsored a gallery in the Robert L. Anderson Building. 
</P>
<P>
They were early benefactors of the Music Center, the Contemporary Arts Council 
and Jewish, Catholic and Protestant charities. They also donated the land for a 
pocket park in Hollywood, which was named in their honor. 
</P>
<P>
"My father always said he could see no proof of heaven or hell so he focused in 
on this world and tried to do the best he could," said their son, Frederick. 
</P>
<P>
Death was attributed to heart failure. Other survivors include a daughter, 
Ellen Smith Graff; her husband, Richard Graff; a brother, Dr. Sidney Smith, and 
two grandsons, John Segal and Roger Segal. 
</P>
<P>
Services were set for noon Monday at Hillside Cemetery in Culver City.

PRICE, PURITY OF COCAINE VARY WIDELY ACROSS NATION; 
</P>
<P>
DRUGS: ESTIMATED 'STREET VALUES' CAN DIFFER BASED ON THE FORM OF COCAINE -- 
ROCK OR POWDER, THE AMOUNT PURCHASED AND THE CITY WHERE IT IS BOUGHT.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Narcotics officers seize a mound of cocaine and say it's worth $300,000 on the 
street. But whose street? 
</P>
<P>
A crack dealer is arrested carrying dozens of crack rocks worth $1,000, 
officials say. But what is a rock? 
</P>
<P>
An informal survey by the Associated Press of narcotics officers nationwide 
found that a kilo of cocaine ranges from $10,000 in Los Angeles to $35,000 in 
Iowa City, Iowa, to almost $70,000 in Shreveport, La. 
</P>
<P>
The street price of powdered cocaine, meanwhile, ranges from $16 per gram in 
Los Angeles to $20 for poor quality powder in Yakima, Wash., to $35 in New York 
City to as much as $125 in Iowa City and Shreveport. 
</P>
<P>
A "rock" of crack cocaine, meanwhile, generally runs about $20 nationwide, but 
the size of the rock varies tremendously, even within one city. 
</P>
<P>
Drug Enforcement Administration officials often get wary when asked the street 
value of cocaine. Spokesman Frank Shults cites "the extreme variations in major 
cities across the country, the widespread variation in purity level and the 
frequent, regular market fluctuations." 
</P>
<P>
The street value also doesn't reflect the wholesaler's loss, a crucial factor 
when law enforcement is trying to cripple drug trafficking organizations. 
</P>
<P>
When officials do try to estimate the street value of drugs seized, they 
sometimes trip over themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agents in Los Angeles seized about 20 tons of cocaine from a warehouse 
Sept. 29, the largest such seizure in history. Local DEA spokesman Ralph 
Lochridge issued the first "very conservative" estimate of street value -- $2 
billion. The DEA special agent heading the Los Angeles office, John M. Zienter, 
later placed the street value at $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Los Angeles police calculate the street value of cocaine at $170,250 
per pound, making the haul worth $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But the people who bought that cocaine lost far less than even $2 billion. Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Tim Beard said the price per kilo runs about 
$10,000 to $15,000, depending on the quantity and buyer. Based on the $10,000 
price, the 20 tons would have cost $181 million. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of Colombia's crackdown on drug traffickers, launched in August, 
remains unclear. Cocaine prices have gone up in some areas while declining in 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials say some of the increase may be due to entrepreneurs 
taking advantage of fears that supplies may dry up. 
</P>
<P>
Wholesale prices of kilos around the country are $14,000 to $15,000 in far 
South Texas near the Mexican border; $14,000 to $18,000 in New York; $16,000 to 
$18,000 in Dallas; $16,000 to $20,000 in Seattle and in the Northeast region 
including Boston; $18,000 to $20,000 in New Orleans; $18,000 to $24,000 in 
Colorado; and about $20,000 in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials say kilo and street prices are determined by several 
factors. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
* Proximity to foreign suppliers or direct connections to them. 
</P>
<P>
Miami had the lowest price per kilo -- $9,000 to $10,000 -- before the 
crackdown, but that has shot up to $20,000, said Metro-Dade Police Detective 
George Reyes. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, one of the lowest prices found in the survey -- $11,000 -- was 
found in Montana, which is not considered a major cocaine center. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Carrell of Montana's Justice Department said the cocaine was almost 100% 
pure and the sellers apparently had "good connections" to suppliers in 
Medellin, Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
* Quantity purchased. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're only buying one or two kilos, it could cost you $20,000 to $23,000, 
but five to 10 kilos would only cost $18,000 to $19,000" per kilo, said John 
Fernandes of the DEA in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, an "eight track," or eighth of an ounce of cocaine in Los Angeles 
costs $100 to $120, a per-gram price of $28 to $34 on the street, said 
Detective Dennis Zeuner, chief of the narcotics unit in the Hollywood Division. 
An ounce of powdered cocaine costs $450 to $500, reducing the per-gram price to 
$16 to $18. To buy by the gram, the price would be $60 to $100, said Beard of 
the county sheriff's office. 
</P>
<P>
* The customer. 
</P>
<P>
Sellers sometimes offer discounts to regular or potential customers. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican sellers are the only source of cocaine in central Washington state, and 
if the customer is another Mexican, the price per kilo ranges from $13,000 to 
$15,000, said Robert Dreisbach, the DEA agent in charge of the Yakima office. 
If the buyer is a non-Mexican, the price ranges from $17,000 to $19,000. 
</P>
<P>
A $20 "rock" of crack can mean anything from one-sixteenth of a gram in Tacoma, 
Wash., to one-tenth of a gram in Minneapolis, to one-fifth of a gram in San 
Diego, to one-fourth of a gram in Washington, D.C. In Los Angeles, one official 
said a $20 rock is one-tenth of a gram, another said it's one-fifth of a gram. 
Smaller rocks in each place can sell for less, depending on the customer's 
savvy. 
</P>
<P>
Some enterprising juveniles in Miami "get together $10, buy one rock from a 
dealer, break that in two and sell each piece for $10 elsewhere and go back to 
the dealer to buy another," said James N. Hall of the Miami-based Up Front Drug 
Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
Powdered cocaine prices also vary widely. 
</P>
<P>
In Miami, a gram costs $55 to $60, up from $35 to $40 a year ago, Reyes said. 
</P>
<P>
The price in Yakima ranges from $40 to $60, although a gram of extremely low 
quality cocaine can be bought for as little as $20, said Capt. Don Biasio of 
the local narcotics unit. 
</P>
<P>
In New York City, police spokesman Sgt. Joseph McConville said the price of a 
gram is $35 to $55. In Iowa City and Shreveport, powdered cocaine can cost as 
much as $125 per gram. 
</P>
<P>
Other typical street prices for a gram of cocaine: $50 to $75 in San Diego; $60 
to $80 in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., and Seattle; $80 in Chicago and San Bernardino; 
$80 to $100 in Dallas, Philadelphia, Montana and Louisiana; $100 in Harlingen, 
Tex.; $100 to $120 in Minneapolis and $120 in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
The purity of the cocaine, 80% to 95% in most areas, also is dependent on 
location and market conditions. Low prices don't always reflect poor quality 
cocaine.

ARGENTINE OKTOBERFEST PUTS FIRST THINGS FIRST -- BEER, DANCING, BEER, FOOD,

VILLA GENERAL BELGRANO, Argentina 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shouts of prost and salud rang through the mountain village as Spanish-speaking 
men in lederhosen and Tirolean hats knocked back steins of beer at the "Fiesta 
de la Cerveza," the Southern Hemisphere's Oktoberfest. 
</P>
<P>
At Argentina's annual "fiesta of beer" Latin warmth mixes with European 
tradition during the first two weekends of October. The celebration has become 
a tradition in Villa General Belgrano, a village nestling in the Cordoba hills 
380 miles northwest of Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
Although celebrated in flower-scented spring mountain air instead of the cool 
autumn of Munich, the Argentines maintain the basics of Oktoberfest -- 
plentiful food, drink and fun. 
</P>
<P>
The all-important beer, a lighter version of traditional German lager, flows 
from hundreds of kegs while revelers waltz, two-step, salsa and samba to street 
bands. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after Villa General Belgrano was founded in 1932, local families began 
holding an annual party in remembrance of the old country. Even today, 70% of 
the 5,000 residents trace their origins to central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
With the arrival of more than 100 German soldiers interned there after 
Germany's Graff Spee battleship was sunk by the British in the River Plate 
during World War II, the annual festivities won acclaim and grew in size. In 
1964 they were recognized as the first provincial Fiesta de la Cerveza. 
</P>
<P>
The mix of cultures and traditions adds to the charm as party-goers chatter and 
sing in a mix of German and Spanish while munching huge portions of barbecued 
beef washed down by mug after mug of beer. 
</P>
<P>
Now a national celebration that grows each year, organizers calculated this 
year's attendance at a record 120,000 -- about 50% more than just a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Beer consumption -- though a far cry from the 5 million liters downed by 5.7 
million visitors in Munich's Oktoberfest grounds last year -- was a healthy 
60,000 liters during five days. 
</P>
<P>
Festivals are no small matter for Villa General Belgrano, according to its 
mayor, Ramon Hector Graneros. 
</P>
<P>
"We have four annual festivals, and the rest of the year is dedicated to 
preparations and improvements for the next year's events," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the village and the fiesta have grown, the old spirit remains intact, 
at least according to Mabel de Hoss, elected in 1964 as the first "Beer Queen." 
</P>
<P>
"Of course things have changed," she said. "When it began, the Fiesta was just 
a party between families. The event is on a much bigger scale now, and requires 
a lot more planning. But basically it's the same -- everyone comes together to 
have fun, dance and drink a lot of beer."

COOL, WET WEATHER HELPS FIREFIGHTERS GET HANDLE ON BLAZE 
</P>

<P>
A light early-morning drizzle and an overcast sky Saturday brought relief to 
the 1,100 firefighters who have been battling a raging brush fire that has 
ravaged the rugged countryside in San Diego, Orange and Riverside Counties 
since Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which was sparked by military maneuvers in the northernmost portion 
of Camp Pendleton, burned more than 11,000 acres by midday Saturday and was 
only 48% contained, U.S. Forest Service spokesman Norm Machado said. Four 
firemen suffered minor injuries fighting the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
Machado said that the fall-like weather that developed in the Southland slowed 
the fire's progress and allowed firefighters to regain a measure of control 
that was lost on Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze has been confined largely to uninhabited regions of Camp Pendleton, 
the Cleveland National Forest and South Orange County. So far, fire officials 
said, there has been no loss of property and no civilian injuries. 
</P>
<P>
But two U.S. Forest Service firefighters were taken to Samaritan Hospital in 
San Clemente Friday, Forest Service dispatcher Dolores Fremter said. One was 
suffering chest pains, while the other had dislocated a shoulder. Their names 
and conditions were not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, one Orange County firefighter cut a knee and was taken to Mission 
Community Hospital in Mission Viejo where he was treated and released. A fourth 
firefighter was treated at the scene for a minor burn, Fremter said. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, the fire advanced more than three miles into the deep canyon, burning 
up acres of dry brush before the wind died down again. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been no increase in the size of the perimeter since then," Machado 
said. "The light rain and high humidity has really helped us a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials predicted that they would not contain the widespread brush fire 
for at least the next 48 hours. The two hottest spots continue to be in the 
Bluewater Canyon and the La Paz Canyon in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Machado said that the often steep and inaccessible terrain has made it nearly 
impossible to move heavy firefighting equipment and men near the fire line to 
clear away dry chaparral.

JAILINGS CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The civil rights of a segment of our state's population are in jeopardy as we 
watch them being sentenced to jail for their defense of life. These good 
citizens of the state of California are being told by the court system in San 
Diego County that believing in the right to life and defending the right to 
life is wrong and punishable action. 
</P>
<P>
Recent events within the court systems of Los Angeles, San Diego, Vista and El 
Cajon make it apparent that justice has a different set of norms that are 
dependent on those dispensing it. It has been judged that the descriptive 
expressions used in protesting what is unquestionably killing of the unborn 
(abortion) -- words like conscience, murder, killing, police brutality, etc. -- 
are prohibited. What has happened to the right to free speech? Are we to 
believe it is for some and not for all? Who makes that choice? 
</P>
<P>
Innocent lives are being destroyed and good people are going to jail just for 
acting and speaking in the defense of the unborn child. Where is justice for 
those who defend life? Who is to defend the right of the unborn?

PARANOIA AND SOVIETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was so proud of San Diego and our mayor for organizing the Russian festival 
of arts. To me it was an opportunity to experience the culture of the U.S.S.R. 
and to get to know its people. A step toward the ending of the cold war and 
madness of the arms race. 
</P>
<P>
However, what I didn't realize, until the FBI warning, was that I have 
information Russian tourists are after. Could it be that my daily activities 
(shopping, cooking, cleaning and watching TV) make me a vessel for espionage? 
Maybe it's the gardening, reading or the movies. The FBI warning is an example 
of the paranoia that exists in this country about the Soviet Union.

It serves no useful purpose to sabotage all efforts toward achieving peace and 
understanding.

TUCSON MERGER IS THE LOGICAL ONE; 
</P>
<P>
UTILITIES: SEVERAL FEATURES OF THE ARIZONA POWER COMPANY MAKE IT, NOT EDISON, A 
GOOD MATCH FOR SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER NAVARRO, Peter Navarro is an assistant professor of economics at the 
University of San Diego and the University of California, Irvine, and is the 
author of a book on electric utility regulation, The Dimming of America. He was 
recently honored for his work on the subject by the International Assn. of 
Energy Economics. Navarro is also chairman of the group Prevent Los 
Angelization Now.

<P>
The most glaring omission in the regulatory review of the proposed merger 
between San Diego Gas &amp; Electric and Southern California Edison is the 
failure to compare the Edison merger with the now-abandoned merger between 
SDG&amp;E and Tucson Electric Power. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the ink was dry on the cooperative Tucson merger, the plan was 
scuttled by Edison's hostile takeover tactics. Today, under the gun of Edison 
lobbyists, both the California Public Utility Commission and the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission have rejected entreaties by the city of San Diego, the 
Utility Consumers Action Network and other intervenors to compare the Edison 
and Tucson merger plans before passing judgment on Edison's application. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Tucson merger is the far superior alternative, both for San 
Diegans and for electricity customers in the broader Southwest region. If the 
Tucson merger, rather than the Edison merger, were consummated, San Diego 
electricity consumers would pay lower rates for more reliable service, and the 
San Diego air basin would probably suffer far less pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Electricity rates would be lower under the Tucson merger for several reasons. 
First, Edison's electricity rates for all customer classes -- commercial, 
industrial and residential -- are higher than SDG&amp;E's, and the current 9% 
rate gap is projected to continue over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Because Edison is forbidden by the PUC to charge different rates to customers 
in different service territories, San Diego ratepayers will see their rates 
rise inexorably to Edison's much higher levels over time. Moreover, even if 
Edison is allowed to temporarily lower rates for San Diego customers (as per 
its public promises), our rates will inevitably climb. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Tucson's rates are more than 20% below SDG&amp;E's. Under the 
Tucson merger, San Diego rates would either remain low or drop even further 
below Edison's. 
</P>
<P>
Second, Tucson affords SDG&amp;E a more economically diverse generation mix 
than the Edison merger. Ninety-four percent of Tucson's power is 
coal-generated. This coal power perfectly complements SDG&amp;E's reliance on 
gas, oil and nuclear generation and provides SDG&amp;E with a resource 
diversity that is a strong buffer against future oil shocks. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the generation synergies offered by the Edison merger are 
virtually nil because Edison's resource mix is almost identical to SDG&amp;E's. 
</P>
<P>
Third, both Tucson and SDG&amp;E are small compared to Edison, but together 
they could be a potent countervailing market force to Edison's attempted 
monopolization of the Southern California and Southwest electricity markets. 
The resultant competitive pressures in purchased power markets would save 
ratepayers throughout the region hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, many knowledgeable observers believe that the primary motive behind 
Edison's hostile takeover was foreclosing competition in this market and 
preserving its hegemony. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the rate issue, the Tucson merger provides San Diego electricity 
customers with much more reliable service. Whereas SDG&amp;E has warned that it 
may run short on power by the mid-1990s, Tucson seriously overbuilt during the 
'70s and '80s and has substantial power reserves that could be used by 
SDG&amp;E through the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Tucson possesses an excellent, under-utilitized transmission network 
that would give SDG&amp;E access to 37 additional utilities throughout the 
Southwest, Midwest and Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the only excess power that Edison has to offer SDG&amp;E is very 
high-cost generation from one of its unregulated subsidiaries, Mission Energy. 
Mission Energy is a "money pump" formed to exploit a loophole in a federal law 
designed to stimulate small power production through inflated prices. Edison 
buys Mission Energy power, passes the high prices on to its ratepayers and 
passes the profits from its unregulated subsidiary on to its shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
The Edison merger might also significantly increase air pollution in San Diego, 
while, under the Tucson merger, pollution would be reduced. As the San Diego 
County Air Pollution Control District has documented, the Edison merger could 
raise pollution levels significantly, ranging from 119% for carbon monoxide to 
an astounding 6,947% for sulfur oxides. Edison would do this by cutting down 
generation at some of its polluting plants in the Los Angeles air basin and 
replacing it with generation from San Diego plants. 
</P>
<P>
The Edison merger would also have several additional unwanted side effects. 
They include the loss of jobs and local control, as well as reduced charitable 
contributions from the resulting utility. 
</P>
<P>
Last, but not least, the Edison merger would prove an unwelcome stimulant to 
the ongoing "Los Angelization" of San Diego by provoking an equally unwelcome 
"political merger." This merger between an Edison seeking new customers and an 
already-too-powerful development industry would have as its aim continued rapid 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Tucson merger was abandoned, Tucson Electric Power has undergone 
considerable internal controversy. Its chief executive officer resigned under 
fire, the company has experienced large losses in both its unregulated holdings 
and power operations, and its stock price has fallen. All of these events 
suggest that there is now an even better economic opportunity for SDG&amp;E to 
pursue a cooperative merger with Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, the San Diego City Council or Board of Supervisors should send 
an emissary to Tucson to explore the reopening of merger talks. The council 
should also pass a nonbinding resolution recommending that SDG&amp;E reopen 
discussions and reaffirm to both the PUC and the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission the desire to see the Tucson merger included as part of the 
regulatory review. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1990, Chairman Tom Page and the SDG&amp;E board of directors will be 
free to terminate the Edison merger agreement without penalty, because of a 
"drop dead" clause in the contract. If Mr. Page and the board would simply 
discard their "golden parachutes" and put the interests of San Diego above 
their own, there would be no obstacle to renewed discussion between Tucson and 
SDG&amp;E about a merger that is founded in common sense and mutual benefit 
rather than in Edison's exploitative power play.

ENCINITAS PARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Sept. 30, I participated in a focus group, costing the taxpayers $35,000, 
concerning the $25-million Proposition A bond issue for Encinitas parks, to be 
voted on Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Those running the study group gave us very little information on where or how 
our money would be spent, but seemed anxious to elicit our approval of the bond 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
According to our hosts, 150 acres are to be acquired for parks in Encinitas. 
These 150 acres are all to be developed, though to what extent they could be 
after land acquisition was paid for was not made clear. 
</P>
<P>
"Improvements" to the recreational facilities of six elementary schools are 
also scheduled. I question the use of park money to improve school facilities 
when the schools have their own budgets. Of course, if such expansion and 
improvements were so that school parks would have an after-school life, in lieu 
of the other park development in the bond issue, it would cost less, probably 
not require an expensive bond issue and make more sense. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, no demographic or other studies were produced to show the 
projected use of these parks. Meanwhile, residents of areas such as Village 
Park, where parks were included as part of the land development, would be 
expected to pay again for parks in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
The city government has embarked on a program to expand the city government. 
More money seems to be spent on surveys than on real action, while the city 
government has grown from 10 employees to 110 employees in the short time since 
incorporation. We residents are being saddled with a new layer of government 
bureaucracy that has a life of its own. This was foreseen before incorporation 
by many of us. It is now coming true.

SCAM TAKES TOLL IN STOLEN DREAMS, MISSING MILLIONS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: INVESTIGATORS SAY DAVID AND KAREN MISSMAN MAY HAVE BILKED AS MANY AS 
5,000 VICTIMS OUT OF UP TO $30 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Nell Greene wasn't looking to get rich quick. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, the legal secretary invested $3,963 in a real estate deal offered by 
Missman-Kaplan Associates Ltd., a thriving San Fernando Valley-based company 
recommended by a friend. Greene, now 68, saw it as a financial seed. Nothing 
spectacular, she thought, as the money apparently grew and she invested more. 
Just enough for a modest retirement. 
</P>
<P>
She was wrong. Last week, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office 
filed a 117-count complaint against former Missman-Kaplan owners David and 
Karen Missman of Lancaster, charging them with grand theft, forgery and 
securities violations in defrauding Greene and 34 other investors. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators say a two-year investigation shows that the Missmans may have 
bilked as many as 5,000 victims out of up to $30 million using fraudulent real 
estate loans and promissory notes. The Missmans, who are accused by a former 
associate of using investor money for luxury cars, property and far-flung 
travel, each face up to 10 years in prison and $250,000 in fines. They and 
their attorney have been unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Some victims lost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Beverly Hills resident Jack 
Schaps, the retired former owner of a number of Midwestern department stores, 
has filed a $5-million damage suit accusing the Missmans of bilking him, his 
wife and others out of at least $500,000 over about four years. 
</P>
<P>
Other investors, many of them active or retired schoolteachers and San Fernando 
Valley residents, lost much less than Schaps. But in cases such as Greene's, 
the losses meant much more. 
</P>
<P>
The experiences of Greene and Schaps, authorities say, demonstrate how the 
Missmans operated during nine reckless years of running a massive "Ponzi" 
scheme, paying new investors with money from previous investors. Investigators 
say the Missmans exploited gullibility and in some cases greed to convince 
victims that they were earning handsome returns when, in reality, the money 
existed only on paper. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing the cases of Schaps and Greene, Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert M. 
Youngdahl of the office's Major Fraud Unit said: "Missman was a snake-oil 
salesman, and he was good at it. . . . It shows you that someone who can earn 
millions of dollars in a business and retire to California can be just as much 
of a sucker" as a financial neophyte. 
</P>
<P>
Greene lost $49,000 that she was led to believe that she had accumulated when 
she retired in 1987. She has been forced to return to work part time. She has 
taken in a boarder to help pay rent on her first-floor apartment with burglar 
bars in a graffiti-splattered neighborhood near Lafayette Park in Los Angeles. 
She can't afford the new car that she needs to go to work. Her dreams of 
frequent travel have dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I got started off on the wrong foot in Sunday school when they taught 
me that if you are nice to people, they will be nice to you," said Greene, a 
divorcee and Kentucky native. "Money has not been a subject I've found 
fascinating. I always thought it was one of the least interesting things to 
talk about. I didn't even start saving until I was 50." 
</P>
<P>
Youngdahl said many victims were drawn in because they trusted the Missmans' 
top salesman and company secretary-treasurer, Henry Springer, a former United 
Teachers-Los Angeles president. Springer has not been charged and has 
cooperated with authorities, detailing the Missmans' activities in a sworn 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Greene was introduced to Springer in 1981 by a longtime friend, a teacher who 
suggested that she and Greene invest in second deeds of trust at the 15% 
interest offered by Missman-Kaplan. The company acted as a broker for investors 
whose loans for home improvements were backed by the deeds, according to the 
criminal complaint. 
</P>
<P>
"Betty said Hank's got this great outfit going," Greene said. "He was a very 
charming guy. Don't forget he had convinced the teachers to elect him union 
president." 
</P>
<P>
Greene never met Missman, who she said had a reputation as "the money expert." 
She said Springer told her that Missman-Kaplan offered a high rate of return 
because the company dealt with borrowers who might not qualify for loans with 
large banks, but who were not risks because their real estate backed the loans. 
</P>
<P>
And the monthly checks came regularly during the first years. Greene was 
pleased enough that, over the next several years, she invested another $12,000 
in two more deeds of trust. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after encouragement from the company, she decided not to touch the money. 
She reinvested her earnings, along with money she had saved for retirement, 
into promissory notes for "factoring" accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Factoring was a practice in which Missman-Kaplan purchased and paid off debts 
owed to contractors by Southern California Gas Co. for energy conservation 
work. The work was financed by company loans to consumers. Missman-Kaplan used 
investor money to purchase the debts at a discount and was subsequently 
reimbursed by the gas company. It was to credit investors each month with the 
principal and interest agreed to in a promissory note. 
</P>
<P>
Greene said her monthly statements showed that her money was making money. She 
planned to retire in 1987, and she was counting on augmenting her Social 
Security checks with monthly interest checks of $500 from Missman-Kaplan. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't even going to touch the principal," she said. "I was going to leave 
it to my daughter." 
</P>
<P>
Like Greene, Schaps was introduced to the Missmans in 1983 by a friend who knew 
Springer and Nathan Glazer, another company officer and former teacher. Like 
Greene, Schaps invested in deeds of trust. But he operated on a grander scale, 
investing $50,000 during the first year and purchasing at least 19 deeds of 
trust. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not experienced in second-trust deeds, but I did check out their track 
record," said Schaps, who retired and came to California eight years ago. "As 
far as I could ascertain, it was excellent. I believe it was a fairly 
legitimate enterprise in the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
After several years, Schaps bought the sales pitch and began reinvesting the 
bulk of his earnings on trust deeds into the factoring of utility loans. 
Hundreds of other investors reported similar experiences. Investigators say the 
Missmans cultivated investors by paying them promptly at first, then urging 
them to reinvest the earnings. 
</P>
<P>
The illusion of a well-run, prosperous company crumbled after May, 1987, when 
the state Department of Corporations cracked down on the Missmans. Authorities 
say they discovered that company employees, including Missman relatives and 
in-laws, were forging investor names to resell deeds of trust repeatedly, 
rendering the loans worthless. Missman-Kaplan was running out of cash, 
according to a sworn declaration filed by Springer. 
</P>
<P>
Greene said the first sign of trouble came shortly after she retired in April, 
1987. The monthly checks from her retirement account began arriving late, then 
began to bounce. Her phone calls to the Northridge offices of Missman-Kaplan 
were answered by a harassed secretary who was being deluged by angry callers. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared," Greene said. "Something was going terribly wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Schaps had similar difficulty with monthly payments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The minute that the first check doesn't come, you begin to worry," he said. He 
said his questions did not get answers, so he made numerous visits to the 
company offices, confronting David and Karen Missman. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a million excuses," he said. "I did manage to collect some monies, 
but there was a lot missing." 
</P>
<P>
During this period, Missman was living in a $1.3-million Chatsworth house and 
driving a Rolls-Royce, a Maserati and a Ferrari, according to court records. 
But Springer said Missman told him in January, 1988, that lawsuits by investors 
were piling up and might force the company into bankruptcy, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterward, investigators from the Department of Corporations and the 
district attorney's office raided offices belonging to several Missman 
companies. The couple were forced into involuntary bankruptcy proceedings by 
creditors. Angry investors held group meetings to discuss legal action as they 
realized that their money was gone. 
</P>
<P>
"I went into a deep depression," Greene said. "I felt like such an idiot. You 
blame yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Youngdahl said a bankruptcy trustee who has seized the Missmans' assets reports 
that there is only about $300,000 left to distribute among victims. But if the 
amount stolen from investors approaches $30 million, as investigators theorize, 
Green believes that authorities may discover more money if they dig. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the considerable loss Schaps alleges in his lawsuit, the retired 
businessman said, "my life hasn't changed." 
</P>
<P>
Greene cannot say the same. Still, she was philosophical, even good-humored, as 
she sat in her apartment last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been gullible," she said. "But you can't sit and moan and groan forever. 
I wouldn't want to change places with anybody named Missman. Not now and not 
ever." 
</P>

RACE FOCUSES ON SLOW GROWTH, LOW-COST HOUSING; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: THE THOUSAND OAKS CITY COUNCIL IS TOO CLOSELY TIED TO DEVELOPERS, SAY 
SEVERAL CANDIDATES AMONG THE EIGHT CONTENDERS IN THE NOV. 7 RACE TO FILL A 
VACATED SEAT. 
</P>

<P>
Creating affordable housing amid affluence and preserving pristine hills among 
suburban sprawl are premier issues as Thousand Oaks prepares for a special City 
Council election Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Eight candidates are running for the council seat vacated over the summer by 
Lee Laxdal, who moved to Australia for his job in the aerospace industry. 
Laxdal's term runs through 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The five council members are elected at-large to four-year terms. They are paid 
$7,200 a year plus a monthly mileage allowance of $150. 
</P>
<P>
Of the eight candidates, five named some aspect of development as their chief 
concern, and several said they believe that the present City Council has become 
too accommodating of developers at the expense of the residents' quality of 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the candidates calling for further limits on growth -- Bob Lewis and K. 
Reed Harrison -- have been members of the Planning Commission and have ties to 
the existing council. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, a 45-year-old attorney whose Los Angeles-based firm specializes in 
business law, has been a planning commissioner nine years. He was appointed by 
Laxdal. He takes credit with Laxdal for initiating the city's slow-growth 
ordinance, which was adopted by voters in 1980 and limits building to 500 
residential units a year. He said he favors adoption of an ordinance limiting 
growth on ridgelines or hilltops. The city only has a policy discouraging 
ridgeline development, but the zoning code regulates development on hillsides, 
according to the Planning Department. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis also cited affordable housing as a key concern but said he favors 
recycling the city's existing stock of older, more modest homes before building 
new ones. He proposed that when the smaller homes are put up for sale, the city 
should subsidize down payments and provide low-interest loans to first-time 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis raised $7,386 in campaign contributions by Sept. 28, the most recent 
deadline for financial reports to be filed with the city clerk. Three $100 
contributions came from companies that provide services to the city: Falcon 
Cablevision, which holds one of two cable television franchises in Thousand 
Oaks and last year received $810,000 in revenue; Valley Commercial Disposal 
Co., whose garbage-collecting franchise with the city last year reaped $1.3 
million, and Pruner Health Services, which is under contract with Ventura 
County to provide ambulance service. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison, a 50-year-old attorney with a local civil practice, served on the 
Planning Commission from 1984 through 1987. He has served on the boards of 
Ventura County National Bank and Many Mansions, a private, nonprofit group in 
Thousand Oaks that provides rent subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison cited a need to preserve hillsides and hilltops, and also supports 
adoption of an ordinance protecting ridgelines. He said he would favor making 
such a measure especially strict, with a provision requiring a four-fifths vote 
of the council for an exemption instead of the usual three-fifths. Harrison 
also cited a need to build more apartments to provide housing for employees of 
the city's service industry. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison had raised $14,468 by the Sept. 28 reporting deadline -- by far the 
largest campaign fund in this election and reportedly the largest amount ever 
raised so early in a Thousand Oaks council race. 
</P>
<P>
Several contributors to his campaign listed occupations in the development and 
housing industries. The largest contributions of $500 each came from Newbury 
Park plumber Ted Lebarron, whom Harrison called a longtime client, and Thousand 
Oaks realtor Ralph Mahan, whom Harrison described as a fellow parent in their 
children's parochial school. 
</P>
<P>
Candidate Elois Zeanah, a 47-year-old homemaker, has turned her property 
owner's activism and concern for the city's environment into a full-time job. 
She is president of the League of Conejo Homeowners Assns., a coalition that 
represents about 5,000 homeowners in greater Thousand Oaks. An unsuccessful 
candidate last year, she said she is trying again because she believes that the 
council "has strayed from the course of good planning" and needs a fresh voice. 
</P>
<P>
Zeanah cited the 2,350-unit Dos Vientos development proposed for Newbury Park 
as an example of a project that received Planning Commission and City Council 
approval despite ill effects on traffic and air quality. 
</P>
<P>
She also cited the Jungleland civic and cultural center -- a long-planned 
project to be built along the Ventura Freeway on the site of the former theme 
park -- as a project that is too large. She also objects to the city's role as 
a partner in a joint venture in the project. "How can they sit up there and 
deny other developers without being hypocrites?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
Zeanah said the city needs to build more affordable housing for young families 
and should provide down-payment subsidies and low-interest loans to help them 
buy their first home. 
</P>
<P>
She raised $5,422 as of Sept. 28. Her largest contribution, $560, came from 
Arco manager Kenneth Bauer, whom Zeanah described as a colleague in the 
homeowners league. 
</P>
<P>
Candidate Phyllis Ellis, 62, is a technical processor at Litton Data Command in 
Agoura Hills and a real estate broker but is known around Thousand Oaks as an 
outspoken advocate for the handicapped. Ellis has walked with canes since she 
had polio at age 2. She said a broken hand three years ago forced her into a 
wheelchair, which opened her eyes to the lack of wheelchair accessibility. 
</P>
<P>
Now Ellis claims credit for forcing the city to install wheelchair ramps 
throughout public facilities and for initiating a recent revision of the state 
law regulating handicapped parking spaces; the amendment makes it easier for 
police to ticket violators by relaxing standards on how the spaces are marked. 
</P>
<P>
She said her involvement with the City Council over the handicapped issue 
exposed her to the workings of city government and what she described as an 
attitude of "Go away and let us run the city; we know what's best for you." 
</P>
<P>
Ellis also cited a need for starter homes for young families, saying, "In 10, 
20 years, the city will be all retired people with no young people." 
</P>
<P>
Grant W. Peterson, 46, a retired sales manager who said he hopes to start his 
own business, said the main reason he is running is to fight drug abuse. He 
also said he fears overdevelopment of the city and accused the City Council of 
ignoring citizens' concerns.

Peterson said the City Council needs to allocate more money for police officers 
to visit schools as part of the DARE drug-abuse education program. The city has 
only one such officer, which he said is not enough. He also cited crime in 
general and gang-related crime as growing problems. Peterson said he became 
interested in drug abuse and gang problems because of his children, ages 16 and 
12, who are involved in scouting. He said he is active as a leader in the 
Conejo Valley District of Boy Scouts of America. He has reported no 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Lance Spencer, 36 -- a construction manager who considers his three 
children, ages 14, 11 and 10, to be the biggest accomplishment of his life -- 
said he is running for the council because "I tell my children all the time if 
you don't like something, do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
Spencer said he considers affordable housing the most important issue in the 
city and predicted that a continued lack of affordable houses will create a 
two-class society -- those who own real estate and those who don't. He said he 
believes that the city should allow developers to build higher density projects 
instead of the large, single-family luxury homes that the city is known for. 
Spencer has reported no contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Candidate Jim Donovan, 40, is a self-employed financial consultant who said he 
is chiefly concerned with drug abuse. He too cited the need for an expanded 
drug-abuse awareness program in schools and said that as a councilman, he would 
favor spending the money needed to support such a program. "Hiring more police 
is a Band-Aid measure, we need to change the attitude of the people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Donovan supports the Jungleland center, saying it could only benefit the city, 
and said affordable housing is society's problem, not the city's. He has 
reported no contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Candidate Norm (Blackie) Jackson, 34, is an auto repairman and amateur singer. 
Jackson, who was an unsuccessful council candidate last year, said he believes 
that he is Jesus Christ.

SHIP ROCKED BY BLAST IS DUE IN S.D. AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A Greek cargo ship was expected to arrive in the San Diego area sometime before 
dawn today, two days after an explosion aboard the vessel killed two crewmen 
and left two others injured. 
</P>
<P>
The freighter, which was not disabled by the blast, was to be inspected by 
Coast Guard officials before proceeding into the San Diego area, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred aboard the M/V Explorer about 2 p.m. Friday while it was 
off the Baja coastline, about 600 miles south of San Diego, a Coast Guard 
spokesman said. The precise cause of the blast, which occurred near the back 
section of the 600-foot ship, remained unknown, a Coast Guard spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard, U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard rescue aircraft responded to 
the scene, as did the USS Jouett, a Navy ship that was in the area, a Coast 
Guard spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
An Air National Guard helicopter evacuated two injured sailors to San Diego, 
where they were rushed by ambulance to UC San Diego Medical Center. The two, 
who were listed in fair condition, were identified as Pavlos Manusakis, 40, who 
experienced burns over 29% of his body; and Din Burhanudin, 31, who had burns 
on 12% of his body. 
</P>
<P>
The identities of the dead sailors were not available. One was killed in the 
initial blast while the other succumbed from burns.

SEOUL OF THE VALLEY; 
</P>
<P>
FLAVOR OF HOMELAND IS CLOSER TO HOME AS SECTION OF VAN NUYS BOULEVARD BECOMES A 
LITTLE KOREATOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Van Nuys resident Choon Ja Kim used to drive half an hour to Koreatown in Los 
Angeles to rent videotapes of such South Korean soap operas as "History Flows" 
or "Life Is a Merry-Go-Round." 
</P>
<P>
But now a small version of Koreatown, with video shops and other stores that 
carry imported products, has sprung up in Van Nuys, saving Kim and many of the 
San Fernando Valley's about 50,000 Koreans a trip downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The most visible indication that a 12-block section of Van Nuys Boulevard 
between Saticoy and Vanowen streets has become an offshoot of the downtown 
Korean commercial district is the plethora of signs using the Korean alphabet, 
hangul. 
</P>
<P>
 The newest one is the big, blue sign for California Korea Bank, which recently 
opened the largest of its eight branches on the boulevard because its officers 
believe that the area is destined to become a center of Korean commerce in the 
Valley. The bank has received $12 million in deposits since it opened in April. 
</P>
<P>
By June, an aging strip center south of Sherman Way is to be torn down and 
replaced by a $2.2-million shopping mall that will contain about 35 businesses 
catering to Korean tastes for such items as dried seaweed and a spicy, bottled 
salad called kim chee. 
</P>
<P>
Now there are at least 25 businesses in the area that depend largely on a 
Korean clientele, including computer stores, auto repair shops and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
But the business that matters most to Kim is a video rental store near Sherman 
Way that opened about a year ago and stocks South Korean soap operas. Kim's 
condominium is just a short drive away. 
</P>
<P>
"I can come every day if I want," said Kim, a slight woman in her 40s who works 
in a coffee shop. 
</P>
<P>
Many Korean-Americans feel most comfortable shopping in stores where they can 
converse with the owners in their native language, according to a survey 
conducted by business leaders in the Korean community. The studies further 
indicate that Valley residents would prefer to shop locally instead of 
commuting to the downtown Korean business district, which is roughly bounded by 
Vermont Avenue, 8th Street and Olympic and Crenshaw boulevards. The same goes 
for banking, said Duke Chi, general manager of California Korea Bank. 
</P>
<P>
"Van Nuys Boulevard is a good place to form a little Koreatown because it is in 
the hub of the Valley," Chi said. "We planned this almost five years ago, but 
we needed to get permission from the South Korean government, which owns most 
of the stocks in the bank." 
</P>
<P>
The 1980 census reported that 60,000 people of Korean origin resided in Los 
Angeles. But Los Angeles officials and Korean leaders say the census did not 
take into account the many undocumented Koreans living in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Today "there are at least 50,000 Koreans living in the Valley" alone, estimated 
Sohyun Chang, publisher of Valley Korean Community News, a 28-page monthly 
tabloid. "If I wasn't sure there were so many people, I wouldn't have started 
my newspaper two years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Chang's estimate is corroborated by other Korean business leaders; meanwhile, 
city officials say there is no way to accurately assess the number. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District, which collects data on the number of 
minorities, reported that in the spring Korean children were the second-largest 
minority group enrolled in Valley schools, after Latinos. (There were 1,967 
elementary and junior high school children of Korean extraction enrolled in 
Valley schools contrasted with 53,439 Hispanic children. Five years earlier, 
Koreans also were the second-largest group with 1,495 children, contrasted with 
34,144 Latinos.) 
</P>
<P>
But the district's figures include children bused in from elsewhere in the city 
and do not provide an accurate profile of Valley residential patterns, said 
Miyeko Heishi, the district's coordinator of bilingual evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
Koreans have moved to the Valley because of its reputation for good schools and 
have established more than 45 churches, Chang said. They live in most Valley 
communities, but are heavily concentrated in the Van Nuys and Granada Hills 
areas, he said. There is also a heavy concentration in Glendale, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chang also publishes an annual directory of Korean businesses in Los Angeles. 
This year, he put out a separate Valley edition with more than 500 listings. 
Although the businesses are scattered throughout the Valley, the largest 
commercial districts are in Reseda and Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
But the shops in Reseda generally cater to other groups besides Koreans and do 
not feature prominent signs in Korean, said Seon Hong Kim, an official with 
Hanmi Bank. The bank is considering opening a branch in the Valley and is 
favoring Van Nuys Boulevard over Reseda, Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
One reason Van Nuys Boulevard has developed is that small business owners can 
lease property there for about $1.50 a foot, said Steve Kim, a real estate 
agent in Van Nuys. In contrast, property rents for about $2.50 per square foot 
in Koreatown, said Suk Goon Han, a Koreatown real estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Specker, a commercial realty agent who has handled properties along the 
boulevard for the past nine years, said: "Based on the Korean community's track 
record downtown, it's clear that their presence is going to upgrade the area. 
It's already gotten better." 
</P>
<P>
Sang Hui Park and her husband opened a small grocery store about a year ago in 
a building that used to house two massage parlors and a bar. They sell such 
items as salted radishes, Asian pears, hot bean paste and fresh tuna for sushi. 
On a recent afternoon, while women browsed in the aisles, stopping to chat near 
piles of imported lacquer ware and bags of rice, Park said business was 
improving steadily. 
</P>
<P>
Sung K. Chung, who opened a Korean restaurant near Valerio Street last month, 
said her husband decided to start the business because he couldn't find fresh 
soybean curd that met his exacting standards outside of downtown Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought that if we offered the food closer to the Valley, people would 
come," Chung said. 
</P>
<P>
Down the street, Chris Kim said her family opened the doors of their restaurant 
a year ago because "we heard there were a lot of Korean businesses here." In 
her spare time, "I can get my hair done, get a video, have something to eat at 
Korean businesses," said Kim, 19, who is studying to be a pharmacist. 
</P>
<P>
Patrons of the area may also buy two major Korean newspapers from news racks 
along the boulevard. Andrew Chang, director of market research for the Korea 
Times' L.A. Edition, said his newspaper has about 30 racks in the Valley, 10 of 
which are in the Van Nuys business district. Published daily except Mondays, 
the paper is transmitted by satellite from Seoul to Los Angeles. A second 
section contains Los Angeles-area news. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers from the West Valley say the trip across town is worth it. Cho Jung, 
of Northridge, who recently brought her children to a Korean dentist on the 
boulevard, said she still enjoys shopping in downtown Koreatown but finds Van 
Nuys very convenient. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here because American doctors are not as kind, and it's difficult to talk 
with them," she said while waiting for the dentist. 
</P>
<P>
Behind Park's grocery store, workers are building the Valley Koreatown Plaza, 
the shopping center that will replace the older strip center that now houses 
the market. Although rents are expected to go up from about $1.60 to at least 
$2 per square foot, video store owner Young Lee said most owners are looking 
forward to the move because it is expected to improve business. 
</P>
<P>
There is already a waiting list of Korean businesses eager to get into the 
center, said Jason Hong, manager of the property for the owner, Yong Sul, who 
lives in Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
Sul has "a vision about Van Nuys Boulevard. He is trying to make it like a 
little Korean village," Hong said.

3 CANDIDATES VIE FOR 2 SEATS ON POLICY-SETTING LIBRARY BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three candidates are vying Nov. 7 for two vacancies on the Palos Verdes 
Library District Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
The library board serves without salary and sets policy for the three-library 
system serving the Palos Verdes Peninsula cities of Rolling Hills Estates, 
Rolling Hills, Palos Verdes Estates and Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking the two seats on the board are incumbent trustee Janet C. Smith, 55, a 
community volunteer; Frances M. Bolton, 46, a demographer, and Teresa Sun, 54, 
also a community volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Robin Hinchliffe is not seeking reelection, so there will be at least 
one new face on the five-member library board. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Rennie, 72, a retired general contractor, will be on the ballot, but he 
has withdrawn from the race because a business venture may take him out of the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
All three candidates say the quality of the library is not an issue in the 
election, nor are there major problems to tackle. The biggest community gripe 
-- no Sunday hours -- was largely resolved last fall when the main library at 
Peninsula Center was opened Sunday afternoons during the school year. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates -- and the library -- are awaiting the results of a study 
examining library use with an eye toward the changing peninsula population and 
whether modifications in services are needed. Library district Director Linda 
Elliott said the study, which is to be completed this month, was authorized by 
the trustees. Among the changes on the peninsula is that its youth population 
is declining, the older population is increasing and there is a burgeoning 
Asian community that now accounts for 20% of the population, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although she is seeking a second term, Smith is facing an election for the 
first time because she and Hinchliffe were declared winners four years ago as 
the only contenders for the two seats. 
</P>
<P>
A Rancho Palos Verdes resident, Smith is emphasizing her experience and 
knowledge of the community. "I've lived for 26 years in the community and have 
been fairly active in groups since 1980," she said. "I have a pretty good feel 
for the community." She added that she is "open to change . . . and responsive 
to the changing demographics" of the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Bolton, a resident on the Rancho Palos Verdes east side for three years, 
believes that her activity on area issues -- particularly her membership on the 
board of the East Peninsula Educational Council -- gives her name recognition. 
The council has been at the center of a bitter fight over keeping Miraleste 
High School open despite a decision by the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified 
School District to close it because of declining enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
A first-time seeker of public office, Bolton said: "I think I'd be a good 
representative for the public. I do believe the taxpaying public's opinion is 
very important. We need to listen and serve." 
</P>
<P>
Sun, who came to the United States 30 years ago from Taiwan and has lived in 
Rancho Palos Verdes since 1971, believes that she could provide the board with 
the perspective of the peninsula's growing immigrant population -- particularly 
its Asian residents. The former college professor has been involved in several 
community groups, and has served on the multicultural committee of CAP, the 
Community Assn. of the Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
While praising the present quality of the library, Sun said she would like to 
see the collection and programs provide "a wider view of the world and of 
different cultures." She said the library could be instrumental not only in 
helping immigrant people become a part of the community, but in making the 
community more receptive to them. 
</P>
<P>
Both Smith and Sun are working on advanced degrees, Smith a master's in English 
and Sun a doctorate in education.

CONTRASTS ARE SHARP IN CENTINELA DISTRICT RACE; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS: INCUMBENTS AND WOULD-BE BOARD MEMBERS CLASH OVER THE QUALITY OF 
EDUCATION, DROPOUT RATES, GANGS AND THE PERFORMANCE OF ADMINSTRATORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The dropout rate, growing gang influence and communications between 
administrators and teachers are the major issues raised by three incumbents and 
three challengers who are vying for seats on the Centinela Valley Union High 
School District board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
In the Nov. 7 race, incumbent Ann Birdsall, a part-time clerk at El Camino 
College, and Pam Sturgeon, president of the Lawndale Chamber of Commerce and 
chairwoman of the Lawndale Planning Commission, will face each other for the 
Area 1 seat. 
</P>
<P>
For the Area 2 seat, incumbent Herbert D. Bartelt, a retired dairy industry 
consultant, faces a challenge by Amparo Font, a bilingual teacher at St. 
Joseph's School, a private elementary school in Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Aleta Collins, an elementary school teacher in the Los Angeles 
Unified School District, is being challenged for the Area 5 seat by Jacqueline 
Carrera, an accountant who has lived in Lennox for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Area 1 consists of Lawndale, Area 2 includes Hawthorne east of Hawthorne 
Boulevard and Area 5 includes Lennox. 
</P>
<P>
Board members must live in the areas they represent, but they are elected 
at-large by the district's voters. The district serves graduates from the 
Hawthorne, Lawndale, Lennox and Wiseburn elementary systems. 
</P>
<P>
The district of about 6,000 students includes Hawthorne and Leuzinger high 
schools, a continuation school and an adult school. It has a budget of about 
$26 million and employs 240 teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Among some of the challenges facing the district is a 28% dropout rate. The 
high schools serve mostly working-class families in an area identified by 
sheriff's deputies as home turf to several black and Latino street gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Scores on the California Assessment Program (CAP) test, which was given to 
223,912 seniors statewide last year, rank Centinela in the bottom third of all 
districts in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
All three incumbents said the district has improved the quality of education in 
the schools, while the three challengers criticized the current board members, 
saying they have failed to improve communications between administrators, 
teachers and parents. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months the district has been plagued with several incidents of racial 
tension, which administrators attribute to a handful of white teachers who are 
having difficulty accepting some minority administrators. 
</P>
<P>
All six candidates said they regret that racial relations have become a problem 
in the district and said they intend to keep racial issues out their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
In the race to raise funds, Birdsall estimates that she has $3,100. Sturgeon 
said she has raised $3,000. Carrera estimates her war chest at $2,000. Collins 
and Bartelt have each raised $1,100, and Font said she has raised $500. 
</P>
<P>
The 200-member teacher's union has endorsed Sturgeon and Carrera and gave each 
a $500 donation. Nancy Nuesseler, president of the Centinela Valley Secondary 
Teachers Assn., said the union supports Sturgeon and Carrera because it feels 
that they are the candidates who would be the most willing to address the 
teachers' concerns. Among those concerns, Nuesseler cited the dropout rate, 
growing gang influence, and communications between administrators and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Sturgeon, 43, who graduated from Hawthorne in 1964, is an account analyst at 
TRW. She has one son attending Leuzinger and another who graduated last year. 
</P>
<P>
She said the district has tried to deal with too many social problems and said 
that if elected she would like to help restore an emphasis on the basics of 
education. 
</P>
<P>
Sturgeon also said the board has failed to question the recommendations made by 
district Supt. McKinley Nash, who she said does not handle himself 
professionally. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally don't like the man," she said. "I personally don't think he's a 
good superintendent." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Sturgeon said that if elected she would seek to increase the board's 
control over Nash rather than remove him from his position. 
</P>
<P>
Sturgeon said she believes she has the skills to improve communications between 
administrators, teachers and parents. She said, however, that she has no 
specific criticism of her opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Birdsall, 49, who is defending her seat against Sturgeon, has lived in Lawndale 
for 30 years and has a son who graduated from Hawthorne in 1978 and a daughter 
who graduated from Leuzinger in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
She was elected in 1983 to complete half of a four-year term left vacant when a 
board member resigned because of illness. She was unopposed when she ran for 
reelection in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Birdsall said the district has worked hard to increase the educational 
standards of the schools and cited a list of special programs the district has 
implemented in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't save the world, but we can do the best we can," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said that if reelected her goal will be to review and update the district's 
curriculum to make sure it is current with districts around the state. 
</P>
<P>
Birdsall defended the board, saying it regularly studies the recommendations 
made by Nash, who she said "has done a good job." 
</P>
<P>
Font, 48, who has a master's degree in multicultural education, said she has 
attended a few school board meetings and has noticed what she called a lack of 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
She said that if elected her main goal would be to improve communication among 
teachers, parents and the administration. 
</P>
<P>
Font said she would like the district to increase the number of bilingual 
classes for Latino parents to assist them in helping their children succeed in 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the desire and I want to do a lot for the children because they deserve 
it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bartelt, 75, who is being challenged by Font, was appointed to the Lennox 
Elementary School District board in 1950 and then won three consecutive 
four-year terms. He was then appointed to fill a vacancy on the Centinela 
Valley board of trustees in 1965 and again won three consecutive elections. 
</P>
<P>
He praised the district for providing special college preparatory programs and 
programs that provide vocational training for students who want to enter the 
job market immediately after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
Bartelt said that if reelected he will seek greater participation in the 
educational process by parents of students who are at risk of dropping out. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is disturbed by the recent racial tension and predicted that it 
would "go away in a while." 
</P>
<P>
Carrera, 24, who hopes to unseat Collins, graduated from Lennox High School a 
year before it was closed in 1984 and then went on to receive a bachelor's 
degree in accounting from Loyola Marymount University. 
</P>
<P>
She said the district needs to raise the students' CAP scores by placing more 
emphasis on basic education. She said that if elected she would like the 
district to evaluate many of its special education and job-training programs to 
see if they are cost-effective. 
</P>
<P>
She said she is concerned about the dropout rate and would like the district to 
study ways to reduce it. Carrera said she would like to be elected because 
"there has to be a change. I mean, the district is falling apart." 
</P>
<P>
Carrera called Nash a "very dominant man" and said she sometimes wonders "who 
is the employer? Is it Nash or the board?" 
</P>
<P>
Carrera, who is of Cuban descent, said she believes her cultural background and 
ability to speak Spanish will help her improve communication between the 
district and Latino parents. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me, I'm willing to listen to everyone," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, 53, who has taught fifth grade for 12 years at Woodcrest Elementary 
School in the Athens area, was elected in 1982 to complete three years of a 
four-year term left vacant after a board member resigned because of illness. 
She was unopposed when she ran for the board in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Collins defended the board, saying its members are always willing to listen to 
the concerns of parents and teachers. "My number is in the phone book, and I go 
places to talk to people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the district is fighting the dropout rate by supporting a truancy

"But I don't think we will ever completely solve (the dropout) problem," she

A man shot by a supermarket security guard in an argument over a 10-cent lime 
was awarded $440,000 by a Dade County Circuit Court jury. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Climpson, 35, sued the market, the guard and the Nationwide Personal 
Security Corp. In a four-day trial, six jurors found all three responsible last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 7, 1987, Climpson went to the Food Giant store to buy 10 limes for $1. 
In the parking lot outside, he counted his purchase and found only nine limes. 
</P>
<P>
He returned, demanded another one and got into an argument with the cashier. 
Then he stalked out with a 10th lime in hand. 
</P>
<P>
Convinced that the cashier had made an accurate count, security guard Hugo Lino 
Salazar, 40, followed Climpson outside. The guard unholstered his gun and fired 
twice.

PICUS DECISION ON SYNAGOGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The entire West Valley should be deeply grateful to 3rd District Councilwoman 
Joy Picus for her heroic efforts over the past year in successfully obtaining a 
conditional-use permit for a Jewish day school and synagogue in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Her efforts were not based on popularity polls but on a firm commitment to 
education and spiritual growth in the West Valley and in her own neighborhood. 
Her work was boosted by Councilman Hal Bernson, whose subcommittee (consisting 
of Councilmen Mike Woo, John Farrell and Bernson) voted unanimously in support 
of the project. Mayor Tom Bradley, who has a long record of commitment to 
Jewish education in Los Angeles, signed the ordinance immediately so that those 
who attended the synagogue for Yom Kippur could be informed. The only Orthodox 
synagogue in Woodland Hills, West Hills or Canoga Park, Beit Hamidrash of 
Woodland Hills, or as it is fondly called by some "the Little House of the 
Prayer," has made major strides in its brief history. It boasts a day school 
that goes up to third grade as well as a thriving synagogue. Our congregation 
of dedicated, concerned people will be a major benefit to the community. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council vote affirmed the importance of this institution's growth for 
the entire West Valley.

However, Padilla failed to note the very questionable legality of these church

RACIAL TENSIONS FLARE IN DISTRICT WHERE ETHNIC MAKEUP IS CHANGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Hugo Martin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the last 10 to 15 years, the ethnic makeup of the Centinela Valley Union 
High School District has changed dramatically. For example, in 1976 the 
district had about 7,000 students and was 65% white, 21% Latino, 7% Asian, 6% 
black and 1% American Indian or Alaskan. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the district is 52% Latino, 19% white, 17% black, 8% Asian and 4% 
American Indian or Alaskan. Eighty-one percent of the teaching staff and 64% of 
the administrative staff is white. 
</P>
<P>
McKinley Nash, who became superintendent of the district in 1984, said he has 
worked to recruit and promote black, Latino and Asian administrators, including 
two black high school principals. 
</P>
<P>
However, in recent months there have been several examples of racial tension 
between members of the predominantly white teaching staff and minority 
administrators. During a press conference Oct. 13, Nash said the district 
"enjoys unusual racial harmony," yet he cited several racial incidents, which 
he attributed to a handful of teachers who are having difficulty accepting 
minority administrators. 
</P>
<P>
* In April, administrators confiscated a black mannequin from a Hawthorne High 
School teacher who said he was using it to teach makeup techniques to a 
literature class. The mannequin, which is timeworn and has exaggerated 
features, was criticized by Nash as being inflammatory. 
</P>
<P>
* Also in April, Charles Prater, a black English teacher at Hawthorne High 
School, received a threatening note in his mailbox after he asked 
administrators to include at least one book by a minority author on the English 
reading list. 
</P>
<P>
* In September, Nancy Nuesseler, president of the Centinela Valley Secondary 
Teachers Assn., referred to Nash as a "Stepin Fetchit," referring to a black 
character in early 1930s films who fawned over his white bosses. In an 
interview last week, Nuesseler said she did not intend the comment to be racist 
and that she apologized for it at a meeting of teachers representatives. Hugo

IN THE AFTERMATH, ATHLETICS ARE DRIVEN BY DIFFERENT RESOLVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SMITH, HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
OAKLAND, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If anyone believes there is the slightest vacillation among the majority of 
Oakland Athletics preparing to resume the World Series after a deadly 
earthquake in the Bay Area Tuesday, one need only look at the faces. 
</P>
<P>
Grim determination would be too mild a phrase. The A's, to a man, endorsed 
Commissioner Fay Vincent's decision to keep the Series alive and in the Bay, if 
safety and the cities of San Francisco and Oakland allow. They passionately 
defended it as something that each player must do for himself, his teammates, 
his franchise and, most important, for the devastated city around him. 
</P>
<P>
"I am absolutely supportive of this decision," Manager Tony La Russa said. 
"There should have been a break, which there is. I think it's a real good 
call." 
</P>
<P>
And it is. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent did not move the Series to a neutral site, a decision that would have 
been an insult to both sides of the ravaged Bay because it would signal the 
game, not the inhabitants or their fans, stand above all and must be played no 
matter what. The A's heard the rumors that the games might be moved and not one 
who spoke out Thursday could endorse that in any way. 
</P>
<P>
"The World Series is between the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland 
Athletics," Dave Stewart said. "If the games cannot be played here, they 
shouldn't be played." 
</P>
<P>
That latter alternative is not acceptable, either, because life, no matter how 
painful, must go on. It has on both sides of the Bay since the tragedy struck. 
Baseball did the right thing in allowing a time for families to care for their 
injured, to bury their loved ones. It could well have found more support if 
Vincent stretched it beyond Tuesday to 10 days or even two weeks. It's not 
perfect at a week, but it's more than acceptable. And, by the time the Series 
rolls around, this town as well as San Francisco may be ready to have attention 
diverted from sadness to the Series. 
</P>
<P>
Such diversions play important parts in all lives. It's why Franklin Roosevelt 
asked baseball to continue its Series during World War II. It's why baseball, 
and Vincent, were wise to follow the same path in the wake of this tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
La Russa agreed wholly. 
</P>
<P>
"I was out all day yesterday and I talked to a lot of people," La Russa said. 
"A great majority wanted to know when it would start. They were looking forward 
to it starting again." 
</P>
<P>
It's about diversions, something positive to latch onto, La Russa believes. 
"Those are some of the things this game is supposed to provide," he said, "a 
reprieve, a distraction." 
</P>
<P>
So, even though the A's feel a sadness they know even a sweep won't undo, they 
are prepared to carry on. 
</P>
<P>
"There's really a hollow feeling when you think about the people who were lost 
and the people affected by the earthquake," A's designated hitter Dave Parker 
said. "But from the people I've talked to just out and around on the streets, I 
think they want to know when the games will be played. I think the city could 
use a shot in the arm behind this. Hopefully, our winning would give them that 
shot in the arm they need." 
</P>
<P>
It will not be easy for some. Many an A's player feared for his life and those 
of his loved ones when they and 62,000 others sat horrified in Candlestick Park 
Tuesday as the earth buckled and jumped beneath the ballpark. Although 
engineers appear on the verge of saying that the stadium will be safe to 
withstand another seven-pointer on the Richter scale, some A's players already 
have made an important decision. They will play, because that's their job. But, 
said second baseman Tony Phillips, "My family's not going to be there." 
</P>
<P>
"I know I don't want my family there, either," Parker said. "A lot of players 
feel that way." 
</P>
<P>
And if the A's win, they will not celebrate with champagne. Not under these 
circumstances. Already, they have decided to contribute to a relief fund for 
the earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
So don't believe for a second that the A's go gladly back into this battle with 
the cross-bay rival Giants. Don't believe that whatever high this club derived 
from being ahead in the Series, 2-0, still exists. There is extreme sadness and 
not a small amount of fear. But do believe there is more, much more, burning at 
this team. 
</P>
<P>
Individually, it has a lot to do with the people who play alongside each other. 
But their emotions are not confined to a clubhouse, a league, but, perhaps for 
the first time, truly to a city itself. 
</P>
<P>
"I think California is not a safe place for me or my family to be, but I'm a 
professional athlete and I have an obligation to the team, my teammates and the 
city of Oakland," Phillips said. "I feel for the people who suffered in this 
tragedy. It's a no-win situation for baseball. But the only thing for us to do 
is to go out and try to win." 
</P>
<P>
That feel for the city runs so deep that Parker even lashed out at one too many 
questions involving Candlestick. For that park is in San Francisco, a city that 
overshadows Oakland in peaceful times and is doing so, rather unfairly, in this 
disaster. For, as Parker angrily pointed out, "The focus is not Candlestick. I 
know the cameras show the (Bay) bridge and its collapse. They show fires 
burning in San Francisco. But the tragedy was in Oakland." 
</P>
<P>
So the team is drawing a certain amount of inspiration from its city and hopes 
to give some of that back just by its presence, by its actions. It's why 
Stewart stands near the rescue area at the Nimitz freeway collapse every day 
and will until someone says he's not needed. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to be there in case there's anything I can do," the Oakland-born 
pitcher said. "Maybe it's just that I can give moral support. But, if there is 
something I could do more than that, I want to be there and be a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Other Athletics such as Mark McGwire have expressed the same desire to help, 
even if it means digging in the rubble. There is more that drives this team. 
The A's need to finish what they started, not only for the city, but for 
themselves, as well. 
</P>
<P>
"There's tragedy and adversity everywhere, at many times in one's life," La 
Russa said. "Many times it's not of this magnitude you're finding this week, 
but no matter how large, you have to deal with it. One way of dealing with it 
is to latch on to one thing you've always felt was a worthy goal. And I don't 
think that's anything to be ashamed of, if you're not shutting down, but 
carrying on."

ANDRE REED IN CLASS BY HIMSELF IN AFC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY LARIMER, ALLENTOWN MORNING CALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Andre Reed played in the National Football Conference, he would be keeping 
company statistically with some of football's biggest names -- the San 
Francisco 49ers' Jerry Rice and the Phoenix Cardinals' J.T. Smith. But Reed 
plays in the AFC, and there he simply has no peer this season. 
</P>
<P>
At his present pace he'll own most of the Buffalo Bills' career and 
single-season receiving records by the end of 1989, but Reed knows his numbers 
are a product of the efforts of 45 Buffalo Bills. That point was clearly driven 
home last Sunday when starting quarterback Jim Kelly went down with a shoulder 
separation. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Kelly's absence jeopardizes Reed's productivity remains to be seen, but 
Reed thinks he's already established himself as one of the game's best wide 
receivers and has his sights set on other goals -- a second straight appearance 
in the Pro Bowl and a couple of more wins in postseason play than the Bills 
posted last year. 
</P>
<P>
Reed realizes that he's just a small part of the Bills despite his impressive 
numbers this season -- 35 catches for 539 yards. 
</P>
<P>
He said, "This is a team sport. Those things wouldn't happen if the defense 
didn't turn the ball over to us, if the guys up front don't pick up their 
blocks and if the quarterback doesn't read the defense and get the ball to me." 
</P>
<P>
No one in the AFC has numbers close to Reed's, but overall in the National 
Football League he trails only Smith in catches, 44-35, and only Rice and Smith 
in yardage. 
</P>
<P>
"I put myself up there with the best of them," Reed said in assessing his five 
years in the league. Last year he signed a three-year contract with the Bills 
that places him among the top receivers financially. 
</P>
<P>
"There are incentives in it (the contract) and a clause that I can go in and 
renegotiate next year. I'm going to do OK," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Already this season he's tied two team records. He had a streak of three 
100-yard receiving games snapped last Sunday, but that streak ties him with 
Elbert Dubenion. He also caught 13 passes in a game this year, which tied the 
one-game record set by Greg Bell. Last year he had a single-season club record 
of 71 catches. 
</P>
<P>
He's currently fifth on the Bills' all-time list of receivers with 260 catches, 
but he should start to pass people like Frank Lewis, Jerry Butler and Bob 
Chandler in the next few weeks and should catch Dubenion in four or five games. 
Dubenion, playing in the old AFL from 1960-67, had 296 catches. 
</P>
<P>
Dubenion's team record of 5,309 yards seems safe for at least another year 
because Reed has 3,635 at this point. Reed also is 11 short of Dubenion's 
record of 35 TD catches. But Dubenion's mark of receptions in 42 straight games 
is in immediate jeopardy. Reed now has caught a pass in 40 straight games. 
</P>
<P>
Reed said, "I actually met him (Dubenion) once. He's on the staff of the 
Falcons and he scouted me my rookie season." Neither had any idea at the time 
what Reed might accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
Reed added, "It's a goal you never think about until someone mentions it. It's 
an honor since he was one of the best." 
</P>
<P>
Reed said he plans to play at least five more years in the NFL, barring 
injuries, and at his current pace of about 60 catches per year, the numbers add 
up to a strong candidacy for the Hall of Fame. It would mean about 600 catches. 
By comparison, the top three pass catchers for their career in the NFL are 
Steve Largent (792 and holding), Charlie Joiner (750) and Charley Taylor (649) 
. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm blessed with no injuries and stay healthy, I should have some big 
numbers," he figured. 
</P>
<P>
But he's aware he is not going to do it alone. He's not sure what Kelly's 
absence is going to mean, for instance. The shoulder separation is on Kelly's 
left, non-throwing side, and Kelly has a reputation of being a tough guy who 
plays hurt. "I don't think it'll be the three or four weeks they're saying," 
Reed said of Kelly's expected absence. 
</P>
<P>
Backup Frank Reich came in last week and hit on 11 of 19 passes, including a 
few to Reed. The Bills have confidence in Reich, Reed said. "He wouldn't be 
here if we didn't. I work with him every day in practice." 
</P>
<P>
Reed has a reputation as being a "possession receiver," which is both a 
compliment and a criticism. The expression means a receiver can catch, but 
can't run. But Reed has broken some big plays, including a 78-yard touchdown 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I can do just about anything," Reed said of his receiving ability. 
"I'm just out there trying to attain as many catches and get as many yards as I 
can."

VIRGINIA'S GEORGE WELSH PROVES TO BE AN ENDURING COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM GILDEA, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's fitting George Welsh found his way here to Mr. Jefferson's University. 
Jefferson said, "Those who labor in the earth are the chosen people," and 
that's precisely how it came to be that Welsh won for the 100th time as a 
college football coach last Saturday. How else but with sheer effort could he 
win that many games at academically oriented Navy and Virginia, two places, a 
coaching colleague once marveled, "Where it couldn't be done"? 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't by gimmicks. Can anyone remember George Welsh cooking up a scheme to 
win a football game? A self-promoter he isn't. Think of a college football 
coach and chances are he'll never come to mind. Charismatic? He's never given a 
Gipper speech, although playing to a good part of his audience he has quoted 
Solzhenitsyn at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
At 56 he's college coaching's marathon man. 
</P>
<P>
Obstacles don't daunt him. His teams have been blown off the field by Goliaths 
such as Notre Dame and Clemson, kicked in the shins by a David, William and 
Mary. Setbacks, his wife Sandra says, turn him from quiet to "very, very 
quiet." But like a long-distance runner, he shakes off the hole he stepped into 
and soon can be seen coming over the next ridge, dirty-kneed, perhaps, but 
relentless. 
</P>
<P>
The book on Welsh, a trim man with a hawk's nose, is this: bright, 
hard-working, knows his X's and O's, up-to-date with an increasingly wide-open 
offense. His day begins at 5 a.m. when he starts writing out a detailed daily 
practice schedule. No dinosaur in his thinking, he is "constantly changing, 
constantly looking for new ideas and methods," according to Penn State Coach 
Joe Paterno. Alabama Coach Bill Curry has said, "George Welsh can beat you with 
his brain." 
</P>
<P>
Welsh and Paterno are friends from way back, when both were assistants at Penn 
State under Rip Engle. By mutual agreement they virtually stopped speaking to 
one another several years ago when Penn State-Virginia games for 1988 and 1989 
were scheduled. (Typically of Welsh's determination, Virginia lost to Penn 
State 42-14 last season at home, then this season stunned an improved Nittany 
Lions team up there, 14-6.) As soon as he has time, Welsh wants to resume 
talking football with Paterno -- and read Solzhenitsyn's "August 1914." 
</P>
<P>
"It's out now," Welsh said eagerly, but as a man with priorities, he won't get 
to the book until after the season. After all, it's 857 pages. 
</P>
<P>
First comes football and to Welsh that means practice. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to emphasize getting better in practice," he said, "to improve 
individually and collectively." If players don't practice, they don't play. If 
they don't practice well, they may learn their coach isn't as laid-back as some 
people say. He's been known to chase a player off the practice field, or throw 
his cap down and stomp on it. Jefferson also said it was all right to stir 
things up occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
Once Welsh overdid it. Illustrating a move, he broke his ankle and had to coach 
the final game of 1986 in a wheelchair. But on better afternoons on the 
practice field out behind University Hall, Welsh is like a professor lecturing 
to a large group, making his points. Football men who believe he has something 
to impart entrust their sons to him. The current roster includes former Georgia 
coach Vince Dooley's son Derek, former Dolphins quarterback Bob Griese's son 
Scott and Curry's son Bill. 
</P>
<P>
Welsh seems suited to Virginia. "Virginia promotes a kind of exploring among 
its students in terms of outside interests," said Athletic Director Jim 
Copeland, "and he doesn't stymie that. Just be a football player when you're 
supposed to be a football player. But he thinks you can be something else, and 
that's a great lesson for anybody to learn." 
</P>
<P>
Virginia won the College Football Association Academic Achievement Award for 
the highest graduation of scholarship football players in 1985 (92.6 percent) 
and 1986 (88.9 percent) and received honorable mention in 1984, 1987, 1988 and 
1989. Welsh is as proud of his quarterback who went to medical school as the 
one he sent to the Green Bay Packers. (Virginia's fifth-year students with 
playing eligibility usually aren't stringing out their courses; last season one 
already was in law school and a captain this year, Roy Brown is studying for 
his master's in international relations.) 
</P>
<P>
Welsh said: "I didn't necessarily come to Virginia because it was a good 
academic school. It didn't deter me, though." 
</P>
<P>
It just happened that way. Virginia was looking for a coach just when Welsh 
turned 48 and thought that if he ever was going to move it was about time. As 
thoroughly as he plans football games and seasons, he seems to have had no game 
plan for his career. He doesn't like to change jobs, and the times he has he's 
done it pretty much on instinct. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a matter of timing with George," Sandra Welsh said. "I don't think he 
plans. He didn't get into football until he was 30." 
</P>
<P>
He was an officer before he was a Virginia gentleman. Eight years in the Navy 
after graduating from the academy probably had something to do with his decorum 
and officer-enlisted man relationship with his players. He's sometimes 
described as aloof. He isn't; he's just not pals with the players. 
</P>
<P>
"I never have been, even when I was younger," he said. "When I was an assistant 
coach, in my early 30s, I tried to keep a professional relationship. I've tried 
to encourage the idea that the door is open. I've tried to be available. But 
there's a line there that I never wanted to cross." 
</P>
<P>
One of his former Navy players once likened him to "the captain of a ship. You 
certainly get the feeling he's off by himself." 
</P>
<P>
What he is, is organized. He may have learned about that from Engle. "Rip knew 
how to handle a staff," Welsh said. "One of Rip's great strengths was that he'd 
allow everybody to talk in a meeting and he would sit and not say much, maybe 
for a couple of hours. Then he'd pull it all together and make the decision. He 
was good at that." 
</P>
<P>
So is Welsh, his peers say. "He's an intelligent person, probably able to 
analyze things as well as anybody and make deductions and then implement from 
there," said Gary Tranquill, Welsh's assistant at Navy and again here. "He may 
not say much, but when he does, it's exactly what he wants." 
</P>
<P>
Welsh was high in leadership qualities as a Midshipman, a small but instinctive 
and winning quarterback. He came out of Coaldale, Pa., with "no idea" what he 
was getting into at the academy. Yale and Columbia were among his 
possibilities, but his father was a Navy fan and had taken him to Baltimore a 
couple of times to see the Midshipmen play. As a 162-pound field general, he 
became the heart of Navy's 1954 "Team of Desire," which had a 7-2 record and 
upset Mississippi, 21-0, in the Sugar Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"The '54 team was one of the great Navy teams," he said. "Maybe not as good as 
the (Roger) Staubach teams, but almost. Because I was no Staubach." 
</P>
<P>
In 1955 Welsh led the nation in total offense, and when he speaks of that 
season he can't help mentioning the Army game. "We probably had a better team 
than Army that year, but they were better than us that day and we just didn't 
win. We turned the ball over six or seven times." 
</P>
<P>
As a Midshipman he met his wife on a blind date. As a young officer, he was 
assigned for a while to the academy and helped out coaching football in 1960 
and 1961. Sandra remembered him saying one day, "I could be very good at this." 
</P>
<P>
Still he went back to sea. He stayed in the Navy eight years. "I didn't get out 
of the Navy to coach. I got out to change a profession. I just decided it was 
not the thing for me," he said of what was hardly a snap decision. He thought 
of going to law school ("Maybe I wouldn't have gotten in anyway," he added). 
"But I had two small children and I didn't seem to be able to do it." (He has 
four grown children now.) He applied for a few assistant coaching jobs, but 
appeared headed for business when Engle hired him for Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
From 1963 through 1972 he worked under Engle, then Paterno. Sue Paterno and 
Sandra Welsh became like sisters. Disappointed that the Welshes would be 
leaving when Navy came looking for a coach, Sue Paterno said to her husband, 
"You didn't recommend him, did you?" 
</P>
<P>
Welsh had been content to be an assistant, just as he would become content as 
Navy's coach. In that job he proved unsinkable. "It took me five years," he 
said, "to get my head above water." 
</P>
<P>
Again he minimizes his accomplishments; unlike many coaches, he doesn't have a 
big ego. His wife told him recently, "With all those losses, you deserve a 
hundred wins." 
</P>
<P>
But even Welsh's early losing teams at Navy beat Army (he was 7-1-1 against the 
Cadets in all). He finished with four winning seasons (55-46-1 for nine years) 
and took Navy to three bowl games. Often his name came up when there were 
coaching vacancies elsewhere. But stories invariably followed that he was 
staying, usually accompanied by speculation as to what motivated him to remain 
put. He simply wasn't aggressive about leaving, and even when he accepted 
Virginia in December 1981, he said, "My family didn't particularly want to 
leave." 
</P>
<P>
He laughed gently. "But I had worked in a military organization as a 
Midshipman, seven years as a commissioned officer, nine years as a coach there. 
That was my 20, I figured. I'd paid the government back." 
</P>
<P>
This is his eighth season at Virginia. He's had winning teams five of the last 
six seasons. He's 5-2 this year, 45-39-2 overall, including two bowl victories 
in two appearances. Yet in the 29 years before he came, Virginia had only two 
winning seasons. It had never been to a bowl. (Navy has had only one winning 
season since he left, and that was the year after.) Welsh thought he could win 
at Virginia, but confesses to underestimating the climb during that first 2-9 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball coach Terry Holland and his wife Ann were among those welcoming the 
Welsh family. Sandra Welsh said, "They were the first people on our doorstep." 
</P>
<P>
"He came with a good attitude," Terry Holland said. "People by and large try to 
make excuses. I've seen coaches come through here and after a year or two they 
say this is the reason we can't be successful. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a fierce competitor. He takes what he does seriously. He has a good staff 
that's loyal and been with him for a while. He's been an effective recruiter, 
especially in the last few years. But he also coaches players to be better than 
maybe their press clippings are. And that's what you have to do at a place like 
Virginia. He always has a walk-on or two." 
</P>
<P>
Lately Welsh has been keeping more good in-state players in state. His most 
heralded recruit has been freshman Terry Kirby, who had been perhaps the most 
sought-after running back in the nation and who also will play basketball. 
"Recruiting is hell," Kirby said the other day, but he appreciated Welsh and 
his assistants "for being kind of laid-back. ... He came in and told me exactly 
what they had. He said you're going to have to work your butt off to get your 
position. Nothing's promised you. And that really impressed me." 
</P>
<P>
Welsh believes freshmen should be ineligible for varsity football because they 
need a chance to mature while facing the new demands of college. He's also "not 
sure players now have as much fun. We never spent 10 to 11 months of the year 
on football." 
</P>
<P>
He believes everyone should have time off. He squeezes in vacation at the home 
he had built on Nantucket a couple of years ago. He takes one week in February 
and three weeks in the summer. He fishes, he reads (his interest in Russian 
literature began with a college course), he runs. He began running long before 
it was popular. 
</P>
<P>
"I still want to have a third career," Welsh said. That's after coaching, and 
no time soon. It could be athletic administration, business; he isn't sure. He 
wouldn't mind a six-month sabbatical at sea to think about it, but after that 
it should come as no surprise that anyone so indefatigable would want to keep 
on running.

MOGILNY MAKES WAY INTO NHL AT TENDER AGE OF 20 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN GREENBERG, HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alexander Mogilny is a pale-faced, 20-year-old manwith acne on his cheek and an 
ache in his heart. He is lonely and a long way from home. 
</P>
<P>
He misses his parents. He misses his friends. He wonders what happens to some 
of the packages he sends. He wonders if the secret police are listening when he 
calls home. He wonders what will happen to his loved ones. He wonders what will 
happen to him. 
</P>
<P>
"KGB is everywhere," he said of the Soviet secret police and intelligence 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
He is living and traveling in a strange new culture, struggling to speak a 
strange new language his awkwardness with which often shames him into silence. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything else in the world, Alexander Mogilny wishes his parents 
could see him play. For that, he knows, he may have to wait many years. 
</P>
<P>
For that, he may have to wait forever. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of printers ink has been spilled celebrating the nine Soviet hockey 
players who have joined the National Hockey League this season, many of them 
superstars from the Soviet national team here to ply their trade in the spirit 
of glasnost, and in the spirit of the Soviet government receiving hundreds of 
thousands of U.S. dollars in exchange for their services. 
</P>
<P>
They have won Olympic gold medals and world championships and much glory for 
Mother Russia. At or past their playing prime, they come to the National Hockey 
League as a reward, with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's blessing. 
</P>
<P>
Except for one. Except for Alexander Mogilny. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Mogilny is a defector. Six months ago, the Soviets billed him as 
their brightest young hockey star, the youngest-ever member of the national 
team, the youngest Soviet athlete to be awarded the prized Order of Merit. 
Today, they remember him as the first member of the Soviet national hockey team 
to defect. Like the others, he was expected to bring glory to Mother Russia. 
Instead, he has brought shame. 
</P>
<P>
Like his eight countrymen, like all the Europeans who have flooded the NHL in 
recent years, Mogilny comes here to play hockey. Like all of them, he comes 
here facing loneliness and culture shock and the chance that he might fail and 
wish to go home. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike them, he is very young. 
</P>
<P>
And unlike them, Alexander Mogilny cannot go home. 
</P>
<P>
That, he says, is the hardest thing of all. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, he had seen "Moscow On The Hudson" several times -- in which Robin 
Williams' character defects in Bloomingdale's -- but no, that is not where he 
got the idea. Life does not imitate art to that extent. 
</P>
<P>
Mogilny defected the first week of May, when he left the Soviet national team 
at the world championships in Stockholm, Sweden. Mogilny declines to discuss 
specifics, but people who know Mogilny's story say his decision probably 
resulted from an an accumulation of things. 
</P>
<P>
Mogilny resented being drafted into the Soviet army just so he could play 
hockey for Central Red Army, the best team in the Soviet Union and the team 
that supplies the nucleus of the Soviet national team. Central Red Army is 
based in Moscow. Mogilny is from Khabrovsk, a city of 600,000 located just 
north of Manchuria, along the Pacific coast of Siberia. Given the incredible 
land mass of the Soviet Union -- it has 11 time zones and the continental 
United States has five -- Khabarovsk is virtually as close to Los Angeles as it 
is to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Far from home, Mogilny chafed under the Central Red Army regimen -- it plays an 
11-month season -- and its dictatorial coach, Viktor Tikhonov, who also coaches 
the national team. A private in the Army -- most veteran Soviet stars are 
officers -- Mogilny was reportedly ticked off when he was unable to get a nice 
apartment in Moscow, an important perk available to many Soviet sports stars. 
</P>
<P>
An astonishing skater with great natural skills and loose regard for the 
strictures of team play, Mogilny was generally regarded as a hot dog and a 
hothead. When he got into a fight in a game -- most un-Soviet-like -- he was 
stripped of his Order of Merit. 
</P>
<P>
Using a pick they had acquired in a trade with former General Manager Phil 
Esposito and the New York Rangers, the Buffalo Sabres had made Mogilny their 
second choice of the fifth round in the June 1988 draft -- the 89th player 
selected overall. 
</P>
<P>
Given Mogilny's stubbornness and independent streak, the Soviets knew that if 
they had a potential defector, it was he. When Central Red Army was set to tour 
the United States -- with a stop in Buffalo, N.Y., Mogilny was demoted to the 
Soviet junior team, which played in the world junior championships in 
Anchorage, Alaska. The Soviets did not want Mogilny in Buffalo or on the U.S. 
mainland. They did not want him to get any ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Mogilny was miffed. Sabres General Manager Gerry Meehan and Don Luce, the 
club's director of amateur player development, flew to Anchorage to meet 
Mogilny and to tell him they had drafted him. One year later, when the Soviets 
were in Stockholm for the world championships, Mogilny's friend, Sergei 
Fomichev, called the Sabres and said Mogilny was interested. 
</P>
<P>
Meehan and Luce flew to Stockholm. Mogilny, having ducked out on his teammates, 
flew home with them, but not before calling his parents from Sweden to tell 
them what he was about to do. His mother cried and begged him to come home. 
</P>
<P>
But Alexander Mogilny did what he felt he had to do. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI interviewed Mogilny when he landed in New York, as it does all 
defectors. Tass, the official Soviet news agency, accused the Sabres of 
"piracy." As a soldier in the Soviet army, Mogilny was granted political 
asylum. On Oct. 4, the eve of the NHL season, he received a visa, so he could 
travel freely between the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very proud of his visa," said Rip Simonick, the Sabres trainer for 20 
years. "Once he had it, he showed it to everyone. It meant something to him, 
like a birth certificate. A birth certificate to the Free World." 
</P>
<P>
"I want to play here," Mogilny said after the Sabres' Wednesday morning skate 
before their game with the Hartford Whalers. "NHL best league in the world. 
Make money. Make my life. Russian system, I didn't see a future in my life. 
U.S., this is good life. People are very friendly." 
</P>
<P>
It was a hockey move, not a political move. A move that could only have been 
made by a fiercely independent, confident guy with a self-assurance well beyond 
his years. 
</P>
<P>
How self-assured? When the Sabres took the bus to Toronto -- it is 100 miles 
from Buffalo -- for their first road game of the season, Mogilny went to the 
wrong hotel and missed the bus. Although he had never driven into Canada on his 
own, he got into his beige Jeep Laredo and began the journey. A friend of 
Sabres teammate Christian Ruuttu who was going to the game spotted Mogilny's 
vehicle on the bridge that connects Buffalo with Canada and drove him the rest 
of the way. He was not even late. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a guy that will take care of himself," says Ruuttu, a Finn, Mogilny's 
linemate and next-door neighbor. "He will rise to the occasion. Otherwise, he 
would never be here today." 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't make the adjustment any easier. Mogilny rents a townhouse that 
he shares, temporarily, with Sergei and Sergei's Swedish-born, Soviet-educated 
wife, Lena. They are his confidantes, his "family," but they are here on 
visitors' visas. They will be going home soon, leaving Mogilny to fend for 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to shopping for clothes, he fends pretty well. Thoroughly modern 
Mogilny reads Gentleman's Quarterly and loves Armani fashions. In New York, he 
bought a $400 shirt. No ill-fitting Soviet issue for him. Strictly chic Western 
European clothes. 
</P>
<P>
"I like clothes," he said, "but not American clothes." 
</P>
<P>
This is no rube who just got off the Trans-Siberian Railroad. As a budding 
Soviet star, Mogilny had been to Montreal and New York by the time he was 16; 
he has been to Los Angeles and Disney World. He was tossing down Pepsi Cola and 
pepperoni pizza and watching HBO with the zest of any 1980s capitalist kid. 
</P>
<P>
It is the size and variety of North American supermarkets that overwhelms him. 
</P>
<P>
But when Mogilny puts on the skates, he does the overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not even trying and he skates faster than these guys," Simonick said. 
</P>
<P>
First-year Sabres Coach Rick Dudley compares Mogilny's speed and grace to that 
of a young Gilbert Perrault, and says of his new wing, "he hasn't even begun to 
use the speed he's got. Nobody's seen him turn it on. When he does, it's 
awesome." 
</P>
<P>
You could also compare Mogilny's grasp of English to the young Perrault's. 
Thanks to a six-week, six-hours-a-day summer school course at the University of 
Buffalo, Mogilny's English is probably better than the French-Canadian star's 
was when he was breaking in. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen more confused French-Canadians than Alex Mogilny is," Simonick said. 
</P>
<P>
But Perreault had other French-Canadians to hang out with. And he could still 
go home. 
</P>
<P>
"In this team, people don't understand me," Mogilny said. "They don't 
understand my play, my style. Central Red Army, offensive. This team, 
defensive. I got little problem. I'm nervous." 
</P>
<P>
That did not keep him from scoring 20 seconds into his first NHL game, his and 
the Sabres' first shot of the season. That did not keep him from making several 
plays in an exhibition game against the Chicago Blackhawks that left Sabres 
brass drooling at what is to come. 
</P>
<P>
Sabres fans love him, roaring every time he touches the puck. When he scored 
his first goal of the exhibition season, they gave him a standing ovation. 
Except for a few isolated shouts of "Dirty Commie" in Detroit, road crowds have 
been kind. Only the hardest heart in America would not soften at what Alexander 
Mogilny has done, and the adjustment he must make. 
</P>
<P>
Very shy off the ice because of his broken English, he is hardly shy on it. 
With his end-to-end dashes and devastating speed and puck-handling, Mogilny is 
a born showman. 
</P>
<P>
"They all know who I am," he told the Buffalo Evening News. "They expect much." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Mogilny intends to give it to them. Bet that he will. For men like 
him, men who dare to do what he did, there is no such thing as a half-hearted 
effort.

NHL NOTES;

<P>
AN EXPANDED VIEW MUST INCLUDE REFEREES

<P>
When the National Hockey League expands in the next two years or so, the 
players that stock the new teams will come from the systems of existing 
organizations. But where will new officials be found? 
</P>
<P>
"The moment hockey expands, we will be ready," said Bryan Lewis, the NHL 
director of officiating. "For each two new teams we need one referee and two 
linesmen. This has to be an ongoing process or we would really get caught." 
</P>
<P>
The league lost veteran referees Bob Myers and Bob Hall to retirement this 
season and were short another, Don Koharski, who was assigned minor-league duty 
for missing curfew during the playoffs last season. That is why unfamiliar 
names such as Paul Devorski, Dave Jackson and Ron Martell may show up in 
black-and-white stripes some nights. They are products of the NHL's search. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike hockey teams, which rely on an organized system of scouting pulled 
together by the comprehensive Central Scouting Bureau, the system of scouting 
officials is less defined. Lewis believes it is just as thorough. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't a day goes by that we don't hear from some coach at some level of 
hockey telling us about someone who works a pretty good game," Lewis said. "Our 
supervisory staff acts as scouts. We have in our file about 300 names and we 
check them all out. There will be times when I'm assigned to watch an NHL game 
in Pittsburgh, and then I'll go to Johnstown, Pa., and be in Montreal to watch 
a midget game the next night." 
</P>
<P>
Officiating hopefuls often hold down full- or part-time jobs or are students, 
so the NHL often helps with travel expenses so they may gain experience. "We 
want to advance careers as quickly as possible," Lewis said. "With expansion, 
the job opportunities will be fantastic. There are never enough good, talented 
officials, but we do the best we can." 
</P>
<P>
Petty larceny or grand theft? 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the outcome of the Devils' trade of defenseman Tom Kurvers to the 
Maple Leafs for their first-round draft pick in 1991, General Manager Lou 
Lamoriello is guilty as charged with robbing the Maple Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
The price of a first-round pick is prize enough, but the top prospect of 1991 
is a 16-year-old center out of Toronto, Eric Lindros, who is 6-4 and 210 
pounds. Lindros had scouts raving last year that he would be the next big 
impact player in the NHL. Lindros is playing for the Windsor Spitfires of the 
Ontario Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
Kurvers, who reported to the Maple Leafs in Pittsburgh to speak with coach Doug 
Carpenter, left the team Tuesday and is said to be contemplating retirement. 
Lamoriello said the deal became complete under NHL bylaws because Kurvers 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
If the deal holds and if the Maple Leafs continue to flounder in the cellar, 
the Devils could have landed themselves a franchise player for a talented, 
although spare part. 
</P>
<P>
The Devils actually ended up trading center Mel Bridgman for the No. 1 pick. On 
March 9, 1987, the Devils traded Bridgman to Detroit for a third-round pick. On 
June 13, 1987, the Devils traded the Detroit pick to Buffalo for Kurvers, and 
this week wheeled him to Toronto for the No. 1. Bridgman for Lindros? A steal.

ADAMS STATE'S VIGIL BUILDING DYNASTY IN CROSS-COUNTRY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Coach Joe Vigil believes people in small towns can do giant things. 
</P>
<P>
Vigil has proved it by building a college sports dynasty in his depressed home 
town in the high desert of southern Colorado's San Luis Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"There are bigger schools and jobs where you can make more money, but this is 
what makes the man or the woman," Vigil says, driving his pickup truck to one 
of his favorite watering holes for an iced tea following afternoon practice. 
</P>
<P>
The wind had been blowing so hard off the San Juan Mountains that Vigil's 
runners could barely hear his shouts. In the distance hung dust clouds as high 
as skyscrapers. 
</P>
<P>
"Why go someplace else when you think you are in Utopia?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
Just staying home, Vigil has led Adams State College to 11 NAIA cross-country 
championships since 1971 and 20 Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
Only UCLA has amassed more national championships in any one sport -- 12 in 
volleyball. Iowa State has 11 national wrestling championships but under two 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
And Adams State, which doesn't offer any full-ride athletic scholarships, has 
churned out 39 individual national track and field champions. 
</P>
<P>
Vigil has been named NAIA Coach of the Year 13 times and coached distance 
runners in the 1988 Olympics. He resigned as Adams State track coach three 
years ago but stays on to work virtually every day, year-round, with the 
distance runners. 
</P>
<P>
In March, he'll coach the U.S. team at the World Cross Country Championships in 
France for the sixth time. 
</P>
<P>
World-class runners frequently visit Alamosa to altitude-train with Vigil, and 
many of his student athletes stay on after graduation for the same reason. The 
combination of Alamosa's 7,546-foot altitude and the flat terrain of the huge 
valley is a rare and powerful one for distance runners. 
</P>
<P>
But when a group of Vigil's runners at the school track are asked the secret of 
their success, they shake their heads as if it's obvious. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach." 
</P>
<P>
In town, too, "Coach" means Vigil. (His mother, who works at a clothing store 
on Main Street and wears an Olympic button he brought her from Seoul, is 
affectionately and widely known as "Coach's mom.") 
</P>
<P>
The homegrown dynasty is guided by what the coach calls "Vigilosophy" 
(pronounced "Vee-hilosophy"): a mix of his favorite qualities, discipline and 
commitment, with a large dose of compassion. 
</P>
<P>
Vigil sends a copy of his six-page "Philosophical Dimension for Cross Country" 
to prospective Adams State runners, and any that want on the team can be on it. 
</P>
<P>
"A kid'll come in that's very sub-par, and most programs wouldn't even let them 
work out with the varsity team. We let them so they get motivated," says Vigil. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not just concerned about the ones that I think are good. Do you know what 
it means to go away from home and go to school and then be cast out? It breaks 
their hearts, their spirits." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Vigil has found that often it's the runners who didn't shine in high 
school that become champions under his training. 
</P>
<P>
Take Rick Robirds, 22, a two-time national cross-country champion and the 1987 
10,000-meter champion, who is running for Adams State this fall. In high school 
at Sterling, Robirds was sixth in Colorado in the 3,200-meter and "a lot of 
people thought I was really shooting in the dark as far as ASC and becoming a 
good runner." 
</P>
<P>
Vigil, says Robirds, "has an ability to take people like myself -- the no names 
-- and turn them into national champions." 
</P>
<P>
Or Pat Porter, a four-time national cross-country champion and two-time 
Olympian from Evergreen, who still lives in Alamosa and works with Vigil. 
</P>
<P>
Porter was a modest success in high school and transferred to Adams State his 
sophomore year from Metropolitan State College in Denver because he wanted to 
be in the NAIA and had heard of Vigil. 
</P>
<P>
Porter still insists he isn't very talented, just a hard worker. 
</P>
<P>
Says Vigil: "Running takes time, and eventually the motivated one is 
contributing to the team." 
</P>
<P>
He should know about motivation. Vigil is a workaholic who rises at 4 a.m. 
daily to have time to study and write. 
</P>
<P>
He holds three master's degrees, and a Ph.D. in exercise physiologyfrom the 
University of New Mexico -- the only place he ever has lived outside of 
Alamosa. 
</P>
<P>
Vigil, 59, grew up on the poor, Hispanic south side of Alamosa, the town at the 
heart of what traditionally has been Colorado's poorest region, and was an 
all-RMAC football lineman for Adams State in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
He got serious about exercise physiology when he was coaching at Alamosa High 
School in 1958 and a student shotputter asked how he could become better. Vigil 
didn't know the answer, and has devoted himself since then to finding out. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to school 13 straight summers after that," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Now Vigil uses computer models to track his athletes' progress. His training 
method alternates aerobic and anaerobic days, but doesn't allow for days off. 
His athletes generally run 70 to 80 miles a week, up and down the giant sand 
dunes at nearby Great Sand Dunes National Monument, through the mountains or 
along the straight, flat, seemingly endless roads on the valley floor. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they have the most adverse conditions that they possibly can find, 
because that carries over into life," says Vigil. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no excuses for not being successful in this country that has 
everything," he says. "I try to set an example for them. . . . Somewhere or 
other I was taught discipline and commitment as I was growing up. I was an 
Eagle Scout." 
</P>
<P>
One chapter of his life Vigil doesn't like talking about is the fall of 1987, 
when his Olympic appointment had to be reviewed after a magazine attributed 
discriminatory comments to him. 
</P>
<P>
Vigil said San Francico-based City Sports Magazine misquoted him and took his 
comments out of context in its story about why there aren't more minorities 
competing in long-distance running. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine quoted Vigil as saying, among other things, "Minorities don't want 
to pay the price to be long-distance runners. They're not engrained with the 
work ethic it takes to be a long-distance runner. Being a sprinter is the easy 
way out." 
</P>
<P>
Vigil denied saying that, and hundreds of Alamosans and numerous 
track-and-field colleagues came to his defense. The national governing body for 
track and field -- The Athletics Congress -- took Vigil's word over the 
magazine's and gave him its full endorsement for the Olympic job. 
</P>
<P>
"That ordeal was very hard on me," he says now. "I've come out a lot stronger 
-- people know who I am and they respect it." 
</P>
<P>
In his "Philosophical Dimension" mini-tract, Vigil tells his runners to take 
their time -- to train their will so its builds and doesn't break them. He 
tells them to be arrogant on the track and quiet off of it. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he tells them to be "well rounded, sensitive, literate human being(s)" 
who keeps athletics "in its place, behind your family, your concern for the 
general welfare of the world, and your education." 
</P>
<P>
Vigil holds a half-hour team meeting daily, mainly to build camaraderie and 
motivation, his athletes say. 
</P>
<P>
Robirds says Vigil knows how to talk to his runners and inspire them. "The 
stories he'll tell -- his travels around the world. His little stories kind of 
get you pumped," says Robirds. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason I'm here is him, overall as a person," says Marco Ochoa, 24, of 
Anaheim, an Adams State graduate now studying teaching to become a coach. He 
still trains at the track with Vigil. 
</P>
<P>
"He helped me so much -- I don't think I'd be in school otherwise," Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa says Vigil helped him through the administrative tangles of college, and 
personally paid his way to a track meet or two when Ochoa first arrived at 
Adams State. 
</P>
<P>
"Other coaches tried to recruit me, offering me money. But they didn't mention 
they'd help me in school," Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
Vigil has no regrets at giving gave up his full professorship three years ago 
to concentrate on long-distance running. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy -- I'm in charge of this little domain and I'll try to handle it to 
the best of my ability," he says. "I consider my job very, very important, and 
I'm just a coach. But you can influence a kid in so many ways as a coach." 
</P>
<P>
Vigil also sees coaching as a way of helping the community that has helped him. 
"People wherever they're at should give something back to the place where 
they're at." 
</P>
<P>
"I want to give track back so much for the wonderful experience I've had in it. 
I want to help make this institution the best institution in the world," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Being home means being free of "artificial stimuli." 
</P>
<P>
"All great work has been done in environments where you're able to find peace 
of mind," says Vigil.

<P>
Determination resounds in Adam Schwindt's voice when he says he will be 
pitching again for the University of San Diego baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
There is a chance he will never throw a ball again, but you believe him when he 
tells you he will. You believe in part because of that spirited attitude, but 
mostly because it is amazing that he can even utter the words. Or would want 
to. 
</P>
<P>
Four weeks ago, Schwindt, a 20-year-old junior, was hit in the head by a batted 
ball in a pickup game at USD. After three hours of surgery at Sharp Memorial 
Hospital to help alleviate a blood clot near his brain, Schwindt was in a coma 
and in critical condition for 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
When he came out of the coma doctors feared that he would never read or write 
again and that his high-level thought processes might be lost for good. 
</P>
<P>
A week and a half ago, a neurosurgeon told his father, John Schwindt, he 
thought Adam would be in the intensive care unit for another three weeks. After 
that, his hospital stay was expected to last into the holiday season. But 
Schwindt has, in his own words, "bounced back." 
</P>
<P>
He was released from Sharp Friday and was expected to be in his parent's Rancho 
Palos Verdes home before dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"I had two seizures, and they thought I was going to fall back into (the coma). 
But I bounced back," Schwindt said. "In just one week, I just all of a sudden 
shot up. I've just gotten so much better." 
</P>
<P>
He spoke those words without a slur, though he initially had speech problems. 
</P>
<P>
"People tell me how bad I was at the start," he said. "They tell me I'm lucky. 
It showed me how close I came to falling apart." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Zawalnicki, a Sharp Hospital rehabilitation specialist said, "In an 
accident like this, cognitive areas are really important -- things like memory, 
personality, higher level functions, as well as the ability to eat, sometimes 
even to breath. In his case he was very lucky that it probably will not affect 
him long term in areas of thinking and thought process." 
</P>
<P>
Schwindt was in great spirits, laughing and joking with his father and his 
brother, Andy, just before his release from Sharp. 
</P>
<P>
Schwindt can read, write, walk, talk, and amazingly, remember what happened. 
</P>
<P>
"Freak accident," Schwindt said. "I should have got the hell out of the way, or 
I should have caught it. But I remember it all. It was a three-and-two change 
up. It was low and outside. Actually, it was a good pitch. Apparently, the 
freshman who hit it has a knack for hitting the ball up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the team closed in pretty quick. . . . And I said my head hurt and 
my legs started to give out. I felt dizzy and faint, and then I don't remember 
anything until I woke up from the coma." 
</P>
<P>
Said USD Coach John Cunningham, "It's kind of a remarkable story. It's not over 
yet by any means, but you can tell there's an inner something in him driving 
him to get better. Other than losing (25 pounds), he seemed totally normal to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
And Schwindt has not lost his appetite for the game, nor his sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
"I just love the game so much," he said. "I understand that it was such a freak 
accident. I really don't think the dice are going to come up like that again. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't have any fear about getting out there. I can't wait to face the 
kid that hit me. He's going to see a little brush back." 
</P>
<P>
He laughs hardest at that comment, because he knows it was his teammates who 
may have saved his life. 
</P>
<P>
"They really responded amazingly well," he said. "They ran out to the street 
and found a cop and called for help. They wrapped me in a tarp to help keep me 
warm. They really did a great job, and I have a great deal of respect for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Schwindt, one of two biology majors on the team, said, "I used to rag on all 
the other guys because they were business majors. But not any more. No more 
rags. They basically saved my life." 
</P>
<P>
Schwindt's dream of becoming a doctor has been intensified by the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives me more incentive," he said, "because I've seen the way they've put 
me back together. It's inspiring. I'd like someday to return the favor to 
someone. 
</P>
<P>
"As for now, I'm just trying to keep my spirits up. The support I've gotten has 
really helped. I've gotten about 200 cards, (some) from people I haven't talk 
to in five years." 
</P>
<P>
Minutes after Zawalnicki told him baseball was out for at least a year, 
Schwindt made his own prediction: "On Jan. 6, I'll be out on that baseball 
field ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
A short silence in the room was interrupted by his father. "We'll talk," John 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, Adam Schwindt feels fortunate just to be able to talk baseball.

HOW TO TRAIN AN 1,800-POUND MOVIE STAR; 
</P>
<P>
WHAT IT TAKES TO TURN A KODIAK INTO A SCREEN SENSATION

HEBER CITY, Utah 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A breath of frosty morning air gently sweeps through the valley, rustling 
brittle autumn leaves and sending a flurry tumbling down the mountainside in an 
orange, yellow and red waterfall. They settle at the base of a mountain, not 
far from a log cabin that was hand-framed by Mormon pioneers in 1879. 
</P>
<P>
Doug and Lynne Seus are relaxing inside the restored cabin as their son Clint 
Youngreen prepares a fire in a blackened pot-belly stove. Together, the three 
raise and train wild animals for the movie industry on a seven-acre spread 
located about an hour's drive east of Salt Lake City -- and civilization. 
</P>
<P>
A timber wolf howling outside is soon joined by a chorus of a dozen more. The 
wolves are being prepared by another trainer for director Chris Menges' film 
version of Jack London's novel "White Fang." Doug Seus peers through a window 
and motions to the majestic landscape outside. "This is all spiritless, silent 
scenery," he says, a tinge of sorrow in his husky voice. "The true magic is not 
here any more." 
</P>
<P>
The missing element Doug Seus is talking about is the endangered brown bear, 
specifically the grizzly, an animal that roamed the countryside freely until it 
was hunted down as vermin by settlers with repeating rifles in the early 1920s. 
"We become placid, mechanical robots in land that does not have that great 
bear," he continues. "You use senses in grizzly country that you never used 
before. Your sense of smell, your eyes, everything is more acute." 
</P>
<P>
"The natural man takes over," Lynne Seus says. 
</P>
<P>
But there is at least one brown bear left in Utah. A tremendous cage with heavy 
steel bars sits in the center of the family's animal compound. It is home to 
Bart, a shaggy 12-year-old behemoth who tops the scale at 1,800 pounds and, 
when standing, towers nearly 10 feet. Bart is a Kodiak bear -- cousin to the 
grizzly -- and the world's largest land-dwelling carnivore. The custom-built 
cage is the only way that Bart is allowed to legally live in the state of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Seus family's tutelage, Bart stars opposite a baby bear cub in "The 
Bear," a Tri-Star release that opens Wednesday. The film is the personal 
project of French director Jean-Jacques Annaud, who artfully demonstrated that 
spoken language is not a necessary component of modern cinema in 1981's "Quest 
for Fire." 
</P>
<P>
In "The Bear," Annaud carries the idea of nonverbal communication a step 
further with a motion picture shot entirely from an animal's point of view. 
Based on James Oliver Curwood's 1916 novel "The Grizzly King," it tells of an 
orphan bear cub who befriends a solitary grizzly, and the two hunters who 
relentlessly pursue them. 
</P>
<P>
The $25-million European production reached epic proportions in the wilds of 
the Italian Dolomites and the Bavarian Alps as the 200-man crew battled nature. 
Director of photography Philippe Rousselot ("Dangerous Liaisons") shot 1 
million feet of footage for a film that required seven years to plan and 
execute. The project employed three full-grown bears, a dozen bear cubs, one 
golden eagle, two cougars, four deer, five grass snakes, 10 Dobermans, 18 
turtle doves, 20 newts, 100 frogs, 300 trout, 900,000 bees -- the list 
stretches on. After shooting, a cacophony of animal roars, grunts, squeaks, 
squawks, yawns and whimpers was digitally sampled and recorded, then carefully 
laid onto an intricate sound track, consuming the manpower of 30 technicians 
over 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
For his part in the film, Doug Seus achieved what was believed to be 
biologically impossible. Adult brown bears are inherently cannibalistic and 
commonly eat bear cubs that they encounter in the woods. Because of this, 
Annaud commissioned Muppets creator Jim Henson to design remote-control 
animatronic bears to double for the big bear and the little bear. But with 
positive conditioning, Seus broke through Bart's predatory instincts, enabling 
the bears to work side-by-side and opening the door for an unexpected offscreen 
friendship to develop. The synthetic bears were used only in scenes that 
depicted violence. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bear" opened on 400 French screens late last year, one week after "Who 
Framed Roger Rabbit." The antics of Disney's animated rabbit were no match for 
Annaud's hometown popularity and the real-life charm of a bear cub and his 
adult companion. "The Bear" swatted aside "Roger Rabbit" in its route to a 
$100-million-plus worldwide gross. Meanwhile, folks at Tri-Star -- which is 
distributing the film in the United States and Canada -- set their sights for a 
fall release, when the box office is generally slower. 
</P>
<P>
"November seemed to be a fairly clear period of time, before the big crunch of 
Christmas product," said former Columbia chief Frank Price, whose newly formed 
Price Entertainment acquired "The Bear" for Tri-Star. "We have a wonderful film 
starring bears, and as appealing as our stars are, I think some of the press 
would prefer to interview Robert Redford. So we have to make sure we open at a 
time when we can get the attention of the press and the public." 
</P>
<P>
This week, "The Bear" will be unleashed on 800 screens across the nation. The 
question is, will American movie audiences take the bait? 
</P>
<P>
"When people ask what the film is about, and I say that bears are the stars, 
they cannot think of what it is, they think maybe it is a documentary or a 
cartoon," Annaud said last week from his room at a Bel-Air hotel. "I see 
puzzlement in their eyes. Because people like categories. They like to be 
reassured with a formula." 
</P>

The 47-year-old Annaud, who directed some 500 television commercials in Europe 
before turning to films, spoke with measured words. In France, his movies are 
national treasures, but in America they are curious baubles. His first one, 
"Black and White in Color," was released in 1976 and received an Oscar for best 
foreign-language film. The prehistory adventure "Quest for Fire" was a modest 
success in the United States. His next film was 1986's "The Name of the Rose," 
a medieval mystery story starring Sean Connery. It was a blockbuster in Europe, 
but failed to generate much box office in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Annaud's confidence in "The Bear" is unwavering. "Nobody is prepared for what 
they see when they come to see the film," he said. "This is the whole problem 
of the film -- at the same time it is the fun of it. My pleasure is to think 
that I am trying to push to the very limit the possibilities of film drama." 
</P>
<P>
Having delved into the feelings of primitive man in "Quest for Fire," Annaud 
wanted to explore the deeper currents of human emotion that he believes are 
common to superior species of animals. Annaud enlisted the services of "Quest 
for Fire" screenwriter Gerard Brach, an agoraphobic who once spent 20 years 
without leaving the confines of his apartment. Brach sent Annaud a copy of "The 
Grizzly King," one of his favorite books as a child. Annaud was enthralled by 
the rich details he found in the adventure story. 
</P>
<P>
Brach wrote a screenplay and Annaud met with Seus in 1984 to make sure that 
Bart could perform what would be required of him -- to limp down a rocky ravine 
on three legs, wallow in the mud, catch trout with his paws, climb steep 
slopes, rub his back against trees. After that, Brach's screen adaptation of 
"The Grizzly King" was turned into a 382-page story board with 1,700 images, 
mapping out the fine points of each scene. The pictorial script also served as 
a communications tool on location for the international film crew comprising 
technicians from France, Germany, Italy and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Once the intricate details of the production were worked out, the film's 
proposed budget began to notch steadily skyward. Fortunately, Annaud was 
cushioned from a fall by the deep pockets of French producer Claude Berri, the 
founder of RENN Productions. Berri, who felt a passion for "The Bear," fronted 
the film with money he made producing and directing the successful "Jean de 
Florette" and "Manon of the Spring." Berri's dictum: "What is important is not 
what a movie costs, but what it grosses." 
</P>
<P>
"We were afforded the luxury to wait as long as we wanted and roll the film as 
long as we needed to treat the animals like star actors," Annaud said. "I was 
very proud of the moments when the little bear falls asleep in front of the 
camera or wakes up in front of the camera. Those moments cannot be cheated. You 
need a little bear who is tired. 
</P>
<P>
"In one scene, the little bear snuggles up to her dead mother (which was 
actually a stuffed bear)," he continued. "To get the cub used to that, we would 
spray dew all around the stuffed bear, and then we would put a little warming 
device under its fur. So for weeks the little bear would cuddle up to that 
space to sleep. My trainers would say, 'We're going to play with the little 
bear. When she's fed up we will give her double portions of rice and raisins, 
and then she will be tired.' But we had to play with her for almost 10 hours. 
It wasn't until the end of the day, at sunset, when she felt like yawning. Then 
it was magic." 
</P>
<P>
After spending almost six months shooting with bears, Annaud grew to suspect 
that "The Grizzly King" was rooted in an actual encounter with a grizzly. When 
he arrived in Los Angeles last week, Annaud's belief was confirmed in a letter 
sent to him by the author's granddaughter, Amy Bajakian. It read: "The book 
'The Grizzly King' was based on the real-life experience my grandfather had 
while hunting in British Columbia. While tracking a bear he had wounded, he 
lost his rifle down a cliff. The bear returned, confronted him and then left 
him alone. This resulted in a soul-searching reassessment of the meaning of his 
life, and life in general." 
</P>
<P>
That letter had a special meaning for Annaud, who experienced a similar tense 
moment on the set. While posing in front of Bart for a publicity photo, Annaud 
suddenly swung around and pointed the viewfinder hanging around his neck at the 
Kodiak. Annaud thought it would make a good photograph. Bart perceived the 
action as a threat. 
</P>
<P>
"I blame myself for being too confident and making that sudden move," Annaud 
said. "The bear struck me a strong blow with his right paw. I was thrown flat 
on my face. Then he was on me. I just protected my ears, and eyes, and played 
dead as best I could. For a few seconds, I had the impression that I was living 
the climax of my own movie." Seus called Bart off in seconds, but Annaud wound 
up with a nasty puncture wound in his rear end. It was the only incident on an 
otherwise safe shoot. 
</P>
<P>
"Easy kisses! Don't touch! Easy kisses!" Doug Seus shouted to Bart, who earned 
more than $500,000 for his role, not including feeding and transportation 
costs. His resume includes "The Great Outdoors" and "Clan of the Cave Bear." 
</P>
<P>
Bart's 47-year-old trainer, who prefers to be called a behaviorist, was in the 
field in back of his house demonstrating one of the 45 commands that Bart has 
mastered -- in this case, gingerly lowering his head and nuzzling a fuzzy teddy 
bear on the ground beside him. Seus raised his arms high in the air, and the 
Kodiak lifted his mighty bulk and squatted on his haunches, the small teddy 
bear tucked protectively under his arm. Bart looked at Seus and smiled. Or so 
it seemed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's called transference," Seus said a few moments later, huffing and puffing 
as he wrestled with the nearly 1-ton Kodiak. Seus, a sturdy man who was a 
halfback at Notre Dame, was playfully batted about like a toy soldier by paws 
at least a foot in diameter. "We work on a positive rapport basis. This job is 
all about back scratches and ear rubs. We taught the big bear to do easy kisses 
on this thing," he picked up the dog-eared teddy, "and then we transferred that 
behavior to one of the animatronic bears, and finally to a real cub." 
</P>
<P>
The bear cubs used in the movie were not as cute and harmless as one might 
suspect. Their fangs are as sharp as pike teeth and their jaws pack the power 
of a bulldog's. Only the trainers and nurses, whose hands were insured for the 
film, were allowed to handle them. The cubs were raised from infancy in a 
nursery in France by a staff of nurses, who kept careful records to track their 
growth and development. The cubs received bottles every three hours, were 
weighed twice a day and checked weekly by veterinarians. 
</P>
<P>
Seus' 26-year-old son Youngreen trained the primary bear cub used in the film. 
Her name was Douce, meaning sweet in French. Douce was chosen because she had 
the best attitude of the 19 bear cubs recruited from European zoos (all brown 
bears are born in January, so they were approximately the same age) and dyed a 
similar muted brownish gray. In a few short weeks, Youngreen had imparted to 
the young Douce many of Bart's trained behaviors, including a miniature, 
less-than-ferocious version of Bart's erect bipedal stance. Douce also did some 
improvising -- hopping after a frog in one scene, and rubbing her back against 
a tiny tree in imitation of Bart's knotty-pine back scratches in another. 
</P>
<P>
The significance of the trainers' accomplishment in bringing the two bears 
together is not lost on the followers of the brown bear community. "I'm not 
aware of a cub ever taking up with an adult male, because it would surely 
become bear food," said Colin Gillin, grizzly bear biologist for the state of 
Wyoming. "It's hard to say behaviorally why that happens. Quite often with 
predatory species, the adult male will kill the young in order to breed with 
its mother. Even yearling bears that weigh as much as 100 pounds will be killed 
and eaten by an adult." 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest shot we faced was getting the big bear and the little bear to eat 
together off the same carcass," Youngreen said after the back-yard workout 
session with Bart was over. Father and son exercise the Kodiak at least an hour 
each day. "It was a fake carcass stuffed with real meat, but it was real enough 
to the bears. There's a natural tendency for one animal to usurp the carcass 
from the other. To get them eating this far apart" -- he stretched his arms 
about three feet -- "on the same carcass was probably the epitome of our 
training." 
</P>
<P>
"They became friends," Seus said. "Through a training process, they learned 
initially to tolerate each other and eventually they formed a camaraderie. They 
would walk together, put out a paw to touch the other one and even lick each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
It was a good thing that the bears could be trusted -- alone or together. At 
times, their trainers were as far as 100 yards away from their animals, 
shouting commands at the top of their lungs and hurling food rewards at them 
like football passes. In one scene, Douce runs after her departing friends, 
stops and stands up straight to get a better look at them. Her shoulders drop 
in sorrow, she slowly sits back down and rubs her eyes with a paw, then swipes 
at empty air as if to say goodby. "When a shot like that works, it brings tears 
to your eyes," Lynne Seus said. 
</P>
<P>
There were a couple of times when Annaud and Doug Seus, two headstrong 
perfectionists striving for the same goal, clashed on the set. On a rocky 
mountain shot when the bears were heading into their winter den, with biting 
winds blowing snow sideways, Seus sensed an uneasiness in the air. Keying into 
the bears' mood, he thought it best to keep them a safe distance apart. 
</P>
<P>
"I was worried about the safety of the bears," Seus said. "Jean-Jacques said to 
me, 'I can't live with the shot that way.' And I said, 'Well, you will have to 
live with it that way because that's the way it's going to be.' He said, 'You 
can't talk to me that way. I'm not one of your bears.' And I said, 'I'm not one 
of your subjects.' So we packed it in and walked off the set." 
</P>
<P>
"Everything had worked beautifully up to that point, so Jean-Jacques naturally 
wanted the bears right next to each other," Lynne Seus said. "He said he had to 
have that shot, when a few months earlier he didn't even have two bears in the 
same frame together." 
</P>
<P>
Annaud supported Doug Seus in most situations. The two believe in 
anthropomorphism -- attributing human characteristics and feelings to animals. 
In Brach's script, the bear cub ingests hallucinogenic mushrooms -- presumably 
because he likes it. He also spends nights dreaming, a nocturnal activity 
carnivorous animals are believed to engage in for 20%-30% of their sleep time. 
Using handmade puppets, it took Czech artist Bretislav Pojar six months to 
create the psychedelic images used in those sequences. 
</P>
<P>
"The old school of biology teaches that anthropomorphism is incorrect, that 
animals don't dream or cry or mourn," Doug Seus said. "One biologist witnessed 
a bear sliding down a snow bank, and he said it was called 'thermal regulatory 
behavior.' Absurd! The bear was having fun. If he was merely trying to reduce 
his body heat, why did he go up the hill six more times, and make six more 
passes at the slide, and then prance around at the bottom?" 
</P>
<P>
"What the film did to me as a human being, it humbled me," Annaud said. "I had 
the privilege to spend time with people who are zoologists, veterinarians and 
animal trainers. They have a totally different approach to man. They don't see 
man as something different, a creature from another world. They see a strong 
continuity between man and animal, physically and psychologically. That's like 
telling some people in the middle ages that the Earth is not the center of 
universe. They take it as a personal blow. It reduces their status." 
</P>
<P>
There are currently believed to be fewer than 1,000 grizzlies living in the 
lower 48 states. Since 1975, all grizzly bears in the United States south of 
Alaska have been listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. 
"Hopefully, this film will encourage people to support the existing 
environmental laws," Seus said. "I think the bear is the canary of the mine 
shaft. It's the barometer by which we judge the health of our environment. If 
it goes, then what?"

MAURICE TUCHMAN: STILL THE ENFANT TERRIBLE; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER 25 YEARS, LACMA'S FIERY CURATOR IS NOT YET OLD NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was swinging '64. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam was boiling over again, there were riots in Harlem, Stanley Kubrick 
made "Dr. Strangelove" and Bob Dylan was singing "It Ain't Me, Babe." Maurice 
Tuchman -- a 27-year-old research fellow at New York's Guggenheim Museum -- was 
considering an offer to become the first full-time curator of modern art at the 
new Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Awesome LACMA board members Norton Simon 
and Taft Schreiber had interviewed him and he was impressed by their "sharp, 
shrewd ambition." Big job for a guy just out of the art history program at 
Columbia University, but for somebody bred in the Bronx the decision to leave 
New York was a tough one. He needed advice. 
</P>
<P>
The critic Clement Greenberg, the reigning aesthetic guru of the time, was his 
logical counselor. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me to turn it down," Tuchman recalls. Greenberg, it seems, was not so 
much against the West Coast as he was against intellectuals working for 
institutions. He told Tuchman that the system would eventually grind him down, 
compromise his independence and turn him into a gray bureaucrat. 
</P>
<P>
Fat chance. Tuchman took the job anyway. Excitement crackled through La 
Cienega's gallery row and word was getting around that L.A. had spawned a 
school of major significance in the artists of the Ferus Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
That was 25 years ago. Recently, Tuchman's supporters celebrated his first 
quarter-century at the museum, a remarkable feat of longevity. There was no 
sign of the graying of the senior curator of modern and contemporary art. At 
52, he is still a dashing fellow and health buff who works out thrice weekly on 
Nautilus equipment. Weekly, not weakly. It is almost as if he has remained 
mindful of Greenberg's prediction and determined to prove it wrong. He has been 
nothing if not colorful with his dandy's designer duds, Buffalo Bill mustache, 
long auburn hair and habit of appearing in chic precincts with interchangeable 
leggy blondes half a head taller than he. Back in the beginning when the 
standard curatorial image was that of a scholarly mouse, Tuchman's style was 
anoffense to convention. 
</P>
<P>
"He may look like a Wunderkind to the museum but he'll never last. He loves 
Hollywood glamour. He should be a movie producer," judged an influential critic 
of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Today, museum professionals are all but required to be handsome and stylish -- 
celebrities in their own right. When New York's Museum of Modern Art named Kirk 
Varnedoe its new curator of painting, his first public act was to pose for a 
fashion ad in the New York Times Magazine. By that standard, Tuchman was simply 
ahead of the game. 
</P>
<P>
There remains, however, a large and aggravated contingent of artniks who wish 
Tuchman had stood in the Big A. The bill of particulars against him heads off 
with the eternal lament that he has not done enough for local artists -- an 
accusation leveled at every curator in every major museum in the civilized 
world. Every serious observer hereabouts has two lists in his mental Maurice 
file. One sets out "Those Artists I Cannot Understand Why Maurice Has Not 
Shown," while the other chronicles "All Those Turkeys Maurice Has Put in the 
Museum." 
</P>
<P>
A more refined complaint has it that he lacks the insight to spot unknown 
talent, and a less refined one just involves general suspicion of his motives 
and values. It says he is a social butterfly and an influence-broker. As a 
noted European artist remarked when Tuchman's name popped up in conversation, 
"Oh yes, he's the one who opens every conversation by asking 'Where is the 
party?' " 
</P>
<P>
Asked about all this, Tuchman shrugs like a centaur shaking off familiar flies. 
He was born Nov. 30, 1936 in Jacksonville, Fla. "That makes me a Sagittarius," 
he says as if recalling the old "What's your sign?" pickup ploy. 
</P>
<P>
Funny. The sign is known for its love of the good life, a thick skin and a 
straightforwardness that can appear downright insensitive. Astrology buffs say 
the archer symbolizes the human being's struggle to overcome its animal nature. 
One is reminded that it was playboy Maurice who organized "The Spiritual in 
Art," a landmark exhibition investigating the role of occult metaphysics in 
modern art. This is not an uncomplicated guy. 
</P>
<P>
"Only time can tell whether or not I made the right choices," Tuchman said. 
"Being a curator is a long-haul job. You help collectors for years in the hope 
they'll finally leave their works to the museum. You don't know the outcome of 
your efforts for decades. You just keep at it every day like brushing your 
teeth. We've never had an endowment for acquiring art for the collection. I've 
had to raise every penny and solicit every donation. Have we done anything? 
Look at the permanent collection. It's respectable now. Sure, there are 
horrible lacunae like there is no Brancusi but if somebody comes from out of 
town they see it's something. It's solid. 
</P>
<P>
"I am by nature a matchmaker. I've always seen it as part of my function to 
introduce artists to dealers and dealers to collectors and museum people. I 
like to put people together." 
</P>
<P>
This appears to be true. He organized his support group, the Contemporary Art 
Council, years ago. It now has more than 500 members. He recently put together 
an additional group composed of people from the entertainment industry, the 
Entertainment Alliance Committee. He conducts about 40 educational meetings a 
year and still leads tours around Europe every other summer. He has acted as 
mentor to a string of junior curators including Jane Livingston, Stephanie 
Barron and Howard Fox, among many others. He worries about single acquaintances 
and is forever trying to fix them up. Parties at his house in the Hollywood 
hills are populated with stunning young women. They have, he says, nothing to 
do with his professional function, he just likes women and prefers their 
company. He has no close male friends in Los Angeles. Lonely at the top. 
</P>
<P>
He's tirelessly enthusiastic about everything from new cars to "Who Framed 
Roger Rabbit." His staccato speech is pleasant but waxes vaguely testy -- the 
delivery of a guy who can't get no respect, but who is determined to tough it 
out. He's been at the flash point of controversy since his first contemporary 
one-man show at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
1966: THE KEINHOLZ RETROSPECTIVE 
</P>
<P>
The show is barely open before the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors 
wants it shut down. It includes a big tableau called "Roxies" made of 
chimerical manikins that depict a brothel. "Backseat Dodge '38" is half a real 
car where chicken-wire figures are up to heavy petting and drinking beer. A 
standard headline scandal about censorship and the corruption of public morals 
ensues. Tuchman and the museum win. On the whole, the '60s were palmy for 
Tuchman. The darling of the board of trustees, he was given a free hand to 
produce such exhibitions as "The New York School" in 1965. The show surveyed 
the Abstract Expressionists before New York itself got around to it. A 
veritable coup. 
</P>
<P>
The decade blended popular culture and fine art in an unprecedented way. It 
felt like one long party with guests wandering through a culture palace where 
the Beatles were hip to Bach, the ballet incorporated rock light shows and 
everybody ate Mexican in the royal dining room. La Dolce Video. 
</P>
<P>
Tuchman married Blossom Plumb, a New York soap-opera actress who was every bit 
as amusing, attractive and likable as the burlesque-queen name implies. The 
pair counted as local beautiful people. The marriage ended in divorce after 
seven years. 
</P>
<P>
1971: ART AND TECHNOLOGY 
</P>
<P>
Tuchman launches the decade with an expensive and time-consuming epic 
exhibition called "Art and Technology." In a way it's another manifestation of 
his matchmaker syndrome. He has the idea that if artists are matched with 
high-tech industry, a creative cross-fertilization will result, spawning fresh 
ideas all round. 
</P>
<P>
Five years and endless exercise of the museum's prestige and influence paid off 
with an interesting catalogue that mainly chronicled a huge communications gap 
between corporate types and artists. 
</P>
<P>
There were exceptions. L.A. artists Robert Irwin and James Turrell worked at 
the Garrett Corp. with Ed Wortz, an experimental psychologist who shared the 
artist's interest in perceptual phenomena. The experience crystallized the art 
that came to be known as "California Light and Space" -- today considered among 
the most original and influential of contemporary artistic innovations. Tuchman 
brokered the match that made it. 
</P>
<P>
In the long haul, that alone made "A&amp;T" worthwhile. In the short term, the 
resulting exhibition was uneven and indifferent in quality. The word on the 
street was that Tuchman's reach had exceeded his grasp. He had produced a white 
elephant and crunched a lot of important toes in the process. For the rest of 
the decade, LACMA's modern and contemporary art department lay fallow. 
</P>
<P>
Tuchman shrugs. "I was never aware of any problem with 'A&amp;T' other than 
some protest over linking artists with corporations that were involved in 
Vietnam. 'A&amp;T' had the highest attendance of any show we'd done. There were 
hard setbacks at the time. Art was sluggish, Artforum left town. County support 
was down, there was no real corporate support and the National Endowment wasn't 
in place. Everybody floundered. I didn't take it personally." 
</P>
<P>
1971: THE CATFISH AFFAIR 
</P>
<P>
Tuchman and curator Jane Livingston organize an exhibition of L.A. artists for 
London's Hayward Gallery. It includes an ecological project by Newton Harrison 
involving live fish in large tanks. Somehow the tabloid press gets wind of the 
fact that catfish will be killed and served to viewers during the course of the 
show. A real Gilbert &amp; Sullivan scandal erupts over the wanton 
electrocution of the catfish. Certain little old ladies confuse them with 
pussycats. For a while it looks as though the show will be closed down but an 
11th-hour compromise is reached. The fish are humanely filleted. 
</P>
<P>
1976: THE POLLACK INTRIGUE 
</P>
<P>
In a bizarre incident, former gallery owner Clark Pollack launches an "oust 
Tuchman" campaign in the L.A. Free Press. During one taped interview session, 
Pollack confesses that he sees the series as his last chance to make a name for 
himself in the art world and that if it fails he will kill himself. Shortly 
thereafter, he is found dead -- a suicide. A tragic coda to the incident came 
in 1985 when artist Andrew Wilf, a former member of the Pollack gallery stable, 
died in grim circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Tuchman went about his business but there was so little in the way of 
significant exhibitions that it looked to the scene as if Greenberg's 
prediction had fulfilled itself. Tuchman had become another faceless 
functionary blended with the filing cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
What a mess. And all he ever really wanted was to be a comic strip artist. 
</P>
<P>
Tuchman grew up in the Pelham Parkway district of the Bronx, a Jewish enclave 
noted for spawning artistic talent. His parents had emigrated from Izbesta -- a 
village in eastern Poland -- fleeing the rising tide of Nazi anti-Semitism. His 
father had been a furrier, a skill of little use in Depression America. He 
became a matzo baker. 
</P>
<P>
Pelham Parkway was lower middle class at best, but it was all the Tuchman 
family could do to hang in there at the bottom of the social scale. They were 
the last family in the neighborhood to buy a television set. 
</P>
<P>
Maurice won a scholarship to Manhattan's legendary High School of Music and Art 
but his mother refused to let him go, fearing he'd be mugged on the subway. He 
wound up at an ordinary Bronx school where the boredom quotient was so high, 
all he could find to do was play sports and escape into the imaginative world 
of his strips. He worshiped the artists of Superman, Mary Worth and Rex Morgan, 
managing to meet them all. They encouraged his own efforts. 
</P>
<P>
He felt he had found his calling but attended City College of New York (as it 
was then called) to please the ambitions of his mother. In college, he had the 
epiphany of discovering his own brain. A smart chum introduced him to politics, 
literature and women. He finished his undergraduate work in three years and at 
about the same time came to the dismal realization that he was a good 
cartoonist but not a great one. 
</P>
<P>
"My desire just crashed. It was a black moment," he said. "I felt shipwrecked 
with absolutely no prospects." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing is bleaker than being 19 and feeling your life is over. For a year, 
Tuchman pursued a vocational guidance course at the Federation of Jewish 
Philanthropies. Finally, his largely silent counselor looked at him and said, 
"Art history?" 
</P>
<P>
Tuchman, whose life seems to follow a depressive-manic, bust-and-boom pattern, 
went straight to the library. He found a facsimile copy of the legendary Celtic 
illuminated manuscript, "The Book of Kells." Poring over it, he was gripped by 
a revelation. He saw for the the first time how a work of art can reinvent 
itself for succeeding generations. For the first time, he had what he calls "an 
out-of-self experience." 
</P>
<P>
Art history seemed to be the answer, but he knew it was the province of refined 
scholarship and that -- compared to his cultured middle-class preppie friends 
-- he was seriously one-down. In 1956, he took a crash 10-week course at the 
University of Mexico -- then reknowned for its art-history program. He was, of 
course, blown away by the the murals of Rivera, Siqueiros, Orozco and the 
mosaic murals of Pablo O'Higgins. (Something in Tuchman is attracted to art 
that incorporates complex craftsmanship and natural materials. He has a 
polished rock that thrills him like an artwork and is currently fascinated by 
Australian aboriginal art and Haitian voodoo objects like bottles encrusted in 
glass gems.) 
</P>
<P>
Back home, he got a night job at the post office and enrolled at Columbia's 
graduate school. Its principal aesthetic intellectual eminence was, at the 
time, Meyer Schapiro. Tuchman calls him "a passionate humanist" -- a medieval 
scholar also interested in contemporary art. His early writings on artists like 
Jasper Johns helped illuminate and legitimize the seriousness of works like 
Johns' "Target With Four Faces." 
</P>
<P>
Tuchman wanted to study medieval art but -- having no Latin -- turned to his 
own times. Schapiro instilled many interests in him including a fascination 
with the Russian avant-garde and a love for Chaim Soutine, the Expressionist 
painter from Lithuania. Soutine became the subject of Tuchman's doctorate 
dissertation. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no one looking after his posterity. He died intestate in Paris 
during the Nazi occupation," Tuchman said. 
</P>
<P>
By luck, Tuchman joined the Schapiro circle at one of those golden moments when 
everybody in the class was destined to play a significant role in the art 
world. Guest seminar lecturers included the likes of Adolph Gottlieb and 
Barnett Newman. Fellow students were William Rubin, who would become the Museum 
of Modern Art's powerful curator of painting, artists Donald Judd and Lucas 
Samaras and the budding critic Barbara Rose. 
</P>
<P>
"She was beautiful and feisty in those days. We got involved and for a while we 
were going to get married," Tuchman said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuchman thrived in the bracing environment until he was gripped by another 
black patch. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my family had been killed in the Holocaust but somehow my parents 
didn't tell us about it. Lots of Jewish parents didn't tell their kids what had 
happened. Sometimes my mother would just start crying, but she wouldn't tell us 
why." 
</P>
<P>
Tuchman says his dawning consciousness of the horrors of The Final Solution -- 
Der Endlosung -- affected his stability. "My mind felt threatened by the rising 
intensity of my hatred for the Germans. There was only one way out." 
</P>
<P>
Tuchman's solution was to apply for a $90-a-month Fulbright grant to study in 
Berlin. Rose was already there. Tuchman moved in with her and they led the life 
of bohemian students during one of Germany's coldest winters. They parted and 
Tuchman took a room in a professor's house -- saturating himself in German 
culture. He learned the language, hitchhiked around and haunted the clubs and 
Bierstubes. 
</P>
<P>
He met Erwin Leiser who made the classic documentary film on the Holocaust, 
"Mein Kampf." He saw it one night in a kino filled with a German audience. 
Together, they watched the spectacle of piled corpses and skeletal survivors at 
Dachau and Buchenwald. 
</P>
<P>
"That did it," he says. "The catharsis of confrontation. No matter how bad 
reality is, it is better than the specters of the imagination." 
</P>
<P>
It was over. 
</P>
<P>
Tuchman returned to New York, promptly forgot his German and started that dicey 
process followed by every young person just out of college -- finding a place 
in the world. Most art historians of the day became teachers. Tuchman decidedly 
did not want to teach. He kept body and soul together by writing entries on art 
for the Columbia Encyclopedia. He's still proud of that. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the chance to be a research fellow at the Guggenheim, where he would 
meet its director, Thomas Messer, and work 60- and 70-hour weeks. "He was a 
great teacher, demanding and giving." Tuchman remembers. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time people barely knew what a curator was. But on the first day I 
walked through the boiler-room entrance at the Guggenheim, my path was clear. A 
museum is a place where it all happens -- a confluence of art and power, 
scholarship and money." We know what happened then. What happened now? 
</P>
<P>
1981: 17 ARTISTS OF THE '60s 
</P>
<P>
Tuchman's modern and contemporary department is just beginning to snap out of 
its coma with an exhibition of L.A. heavyweights including everybody from Larry 
Bell to Peter Voulkos -- all the boys. On the gala opening night, 100 women 
artists mass in front of the museum wearing tuxes and carrying placards 
reading, "White Boys Ain't the Only Ones Making Art in L.A." Everybody in the 
crowd wears a mask of Tuchman's face. 
</P>
<P>
For a minute it looked like double deja vu. 
</P>
<P>
A new decade and new hostility against the veteran curator. 
</P>
<P>
Once again he shrugs. His glasses are fairly powerful and his eyebrows almost 
nonexistent so he always looks a trifle surprised. He confesses the protest was 
mildly upsetting but "conceptually it was quite a good artwork in itself." 
</P>
<P>
He keeps a photo of the crowd with his memorabilia collection on the bathroom 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982 he married Sari Shapiro, a Hollywood agent. Again, the liaison lasted 
seven years. "No, that was probably not my last marriage," Tuchman says. "The 
closeness of marriage is wonderful and it's a great growth experience." 
</P>
<P>
Omens notwithstanding and dissatisfaction being eternal, the '80s have 
nonetheless proved a vintage decade for Tuchman and his team. The opening of 
the Robert O. Anderson Building for Modern and Contemporary Art provided a 
stable and available showcase. Even before it opened, the department proved 
itself an idea-tank of international significance with exhibitions like "The 
Avant-Garde in Russia" -- a landmark exhibition hailed for reviving a crucial 
lost chapter in modern art. 
</P>
<P>
Tuchman's colleague Stephanie Barron has become a curatorial star in her own 
right with exhibitions like "German Expressionist Sculpture" and "German 
Expressionism: the Second Generation." Everyone is waiting for her revival of 
Hitler's notorious "Degenerate Art" exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
As the departmental exec, Tuchman basks in the glow of every show he signs off 
on, including an epic Max Beckmann retrospective that no New York museum had 
the sense to take and, of course, his own "The Spiritual in Art" which had the 
gumption to assert that modern art was inspired by spiritual as well as formal 
and historical considerations. 
</P>
<P>
His current big project is a sequel to be called, "Outsider/Insider: A History 
of Visionary Art and Modernism." Why this recurrent fascination with the 
mystical? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a mystic but it interests me because so many great people are. I hope 
this exhibition will confront the big challenges of the '90s and beyond -- 
ecology and mental health. I hope it will cast some light on questions of why 
is there so much anxiety in the society, why we are so neurotic, crazed and 
drug-ridden. It will deal with larger issues. I'm a citizen and I feel it's the 
responsible thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Sounds admirable. On the other hand what about that artist I like that he never 
shows?

MUSIC MAKERS OF THE L.A. CONCERT SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The local big-budget musical organizations may get the lion's share of the 
attention, but they are only the high-profile tip of a very broad and 
diversified base. Nearly 100 local orchestras, bands, festivals and presenting 
societies of all sizes and musical perspectives offer concerts this season, and 
that doesn't include the active musical life on campuses and in churches. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these groups confront numerous problems as they try to secure a niche 
in the community musical consciousness. By the same token, those that have put 
down roots may remain in place for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the process includes young artists who may later turn up at the Music 
Center. New work by local composers gets premieres. And some of these ensembles 
exist as much for the musicians' joy in the playing as for their audience's joy 
in the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 In this article, Calendar surveys some of the organizations that make up the 
Southland musical mix. 
</P>
<P>
 LOS ANGELES MOZART ORCHESTRA -- When the Academy Award-winning film "Amadeus" 
scored a hit at the box office, business also picked up for the Los Angeles 
Mozart Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Fascination with the life and difficult times of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 
continues, and audience attendance at the orchestra's three-concert series at 
the 1,200-seat Wilshire Ebell Theatre has reached near capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Performing the repertory of "Beethoven and before," the ensemble generally 
numbers 25, drawn from a pool of professional musicians paid union scale. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989/90 season, budgeted under $100,000, opens Saturday under the direction 
of David Keith, who founded the orchestra in 1975 "as a tribute to the towering 
genius of Mozart." Ticket sales account for approximately 30% of income earned, 
the rest comes from individual supporters and foundations. The orchestra also 
is a recipient of a $3,000 grant from the Cultural Affairs Department of the 
city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In his second appearance with the group, actor Walter Matthau -- a "real Mozart 
fan," according to orchestra officials -- will conduct an encore at the closing 
concert in May, marking his second appearance with the group. 
</P>
<P>
PASADENA COMMUNITY ORCHESTRA -- "If this type of group didn't exist, the 
biggest loss would be the lack of opportunity for non-professional musicians to 
play really good music literature," said Wayne Reinecke, music director. "There 
are lots of amateur student orchestra groups, but not many for adults." 
</P>
<P>
The 5-year-old Pasadena Community Orchestra manages to draw 500 to 800 people 
for each concert, said Reinecke. "We do have kind of a community feeling, and I 
think people enjoy that -- it's kind of relaxed," he said. "People also really 
liked coming to our former location (a Methodist church in Pasadena) because it 
was aesthetically pleasant." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, presenting concerts makes the rehearsal time worthwhile for the 
60-odd musicians who will play five free concerts in the Pasadena Community 
Orchestra's 1989-1990 season, which opens Friday. A new location, First Church 
of the Nazarene in Pasadena, will provide better lighting, more possibilities 
for staging and vital room for a piano. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a very successful group. They play well, and I try to program music 
that's enjoyable for the listeners, mostly from the late Classical-early 
Romantic period, with the occasional piece from a later period. I guess it 
appeals to people," Reinecke said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the orchestra's musicians live in the Pasadena-Altadena-Arcadia area, 
but one musical couple treks in from Chatsworth and another member commutes 
from Canyon Country for the weekly rehearsals. None of the musicians are paid, 
which means the orchestra is able to operate on an annual budget of less than 
$20,000, raised largely through at-the-door contributions and some modest 
fund-raising campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are more potential players on a waiting list than Reinecke can 
use. "At least 50% of the group have probably been with us for five years," he 
said. "They have all kinds of occupations, from teachers to Jet Propulsion Lab 
technicians to homemakers. They play music simply for the the joy of playing." 
</P>
<P>
THE MUSIC CIRCLE -- Since its inception 16 years ago, the Music Circle has been 
a major force in importing classical music from India, drawing audiences as 
large as 2,000 for a performance by sitarist Ravi Shankar. Founded by Shankar 
and his student Harihar Rao, the Music Circle's season runs through June, 
usually at Occidental College, and encompasses six to 12 concerts. 
</P>
<P>
"All our performers are native Indian and acknowledged artists, on the same 
level of recognition as Van Cliburn," Rao said. But getting them into the 
United States is so big a headache that concerts can be announced only four to 
six weeks in advance. 
</P>
<P>
The Music Circle does not directly sponsor and invite individuals to perform. 
As Rao said, "We have the money and the lawyers, but bringing artists and 
trying to obtain H1 (temporary performing artists) visas on our own is an 
ulcer-producing situation. It is easier to be the local sponsor instead of 
having to worry about missed planes and lost contracts." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, artists are invited to perform by the Amir Khusro Society of America, 
a nonprofit cultural organization based in Chicago. Also, the Indian music 
program at the University of Pittsburgh provides artists for the concerts in 
Southern California, said Rao. 
</P>
<P>
"Indian classical music is similar to New Age music -- it is disciplined and 
ritualistic. It is improvised and does not have a definite composition," said 
Rao, the executive director of the Music Circle. 
</P>
<P>
A volunteer and self-sufficient organization, the Music Circle boasts a 
membership of 1,500 who pay a fee ranging from $10 to $1,000, which covers 
administrative costs. Ticket receipts, at $10 to $12, go to the artists. 
</P>
<P>
SAN FERNANDO VALLEY SYMPHONY -- At San Fernando Valley Symphony, one of the 
emphases is to attract the young. Evening concerts admit children under the age 
of 12 for free, and the symphony stages a series of concerts just for young 
people, in which characters like Andante the Space Alien introduce children to 
the "rad" new world of symphony music. The symphony welcomes listeners of all 
ages and pours considerable effort into wooing families. 
</P>
<P>
"We do want to provide alternative entertainment for families. We'd like to 
interest young people in something besides television," said Maryann 
Mendenhall, general manager of the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old ensemble of free-lance professional musicians fell on hard 
times in the early '80s due to a stream of conductors and decreasing audience 
interest. In 1985, young conductor Lois Johnson stepped to the podium, and with 
the help of her attorney husband began to court corporate sponsors for the 
group. Those annual donations total about $13,000, and with city grants, season 
subscriber funds and ticket sales, barely allow the orchestra to cover its 
$80,000 annual expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Increasing individual subscriber support is a main goal of the group. "We need 
to intensify and upgrade our marketing program, to let other people know about 
us," Mendenhall said. One of the orchestra's biggest challenges is convincing 
people they can have a pleasurable and professional musical experience in the 
auditorium of Birmingham High School in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
The symphony also provides variety: one program last year included Brahms 
Symphony No. 2, film composer Bruce Broughton's music from "Silverado" and 
"Young Sherlock Holmes," and the world premiere of a Broughton violin concerto 
titled "Three Incongruities." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of music out there is not audience-friendly. We do want to expose people 
to new things, but we want them to enjoy themselves even as we try to lift 
their level of understanding," Mendenhall said. 
</P>
<P>
FULLERTON FRIENDS OF MUSIC -- The Fullerton Friends of Music operates on a 
meager $10,000 budget, but it is the oldest chamber music series in Orange 
County -- and still the only professional chamber music organization offering a 
regular series of concerts in north Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1958 by harpsichordist Beulah Strickler, the Friends present five 
free concerts at Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Audiences are now at the hall's capacity -- approximately 350. But Strickler 
resists the idea of moving the concerts to a larger auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the way chamber music should be heard -- in a small venue," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Groups appearing on the series are a mix of local, national and international 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining 1989-90 concerts include the Angeles Quartet, Dec. 3; a 
Baroque-styled orchestra, including members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, 
Jan. 21; I Cantori, March 4, and the New York-based Leonardo Trio, April 8. 
</P>
<P>
The Friends raise the budget money from memberships (ranging from $15 to $500), 
matching funds from corporations and a $1,250 grant from the city of Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"Because our concerts are admission-free, some people think that either we 
don't pay the artists -- which is not true -- or that they are less valuable 
than something people have paid for," Strickler says. "That's one thing I've 
always been bothered by." 
</P>
<P>
BEVERLY HILLS SYMPHONY -- "Having an identity, an individuality, is essential 
for an orchestra to survive," says Bulgarian-born Bogidar Avramov, conductor of 
the Beverly Hills Symphony. (Founded in 1963, the orchestra was formerly known 
as the Westside Symphony. Avramov took over the helm in 1970). 
</P>
<P>
Avramov, a professor of music at Loyola Marymount University and a resident of 
Beverly Hills, strives to program neglected and unusual works, not an easy task 
in a city "more interested in glamour and glitz than serious art," he says. 
</P>
<P>
For the winter season's opening concert on Dec. 2 at the Wilshire Ebell 
Theatre, he has scheduled Olivier Messiaen's "Hymne au Saint Sacrement." In the 
summer of '88, he scheduled Igor Stravinsky's Concerto in E-flat, "Dumbarton 
Oaks," at Greystone Park, the orchestra's summer home in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989-90 season is budgeted at $200,000. Fifty percent of income is derived 
from the Beverly Hills Symphony Assn., numbering 1,500 supporters. The City of 
Beverly Hills has awarded the orchestra a $40,000 grant. 
</P>
<P>
The 65-member professional ensemble also presents an annual Christmas concert 
at a supporter's home. 
</P>
<P>
LOS ANGELES POPS ORCHESTRA -- It thrives on variety. 
</P>
<P>
For July 4, the musicians took their places at 3:30 a.m. on Santa Monica Beach 
and played "patriotic" music by Aaron Copland and John Williams for more than 
200,000 celebrants. 
</P>
<P>
Each winter -- this year's season begins Dec. 15 -- the 60-member professional 
ensemble gives five performances at the downtown Biltmore Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Summers, the orchestra sets up shop on the tennis exhibition court of the 
Warner Center in Woodland Hills to present six to eight concerts for a maximum 
crowd of 1,500. Programs include works by Leonard Bernstein, Richard Rodgers 
and Michel Legrand, interspersed with the war horses of Liszt, Tchaikovsky and 
Rachmaninoff. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's dates at private clubs and on behalf of charitable organizations. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1977 by Carlo Spiga, then a violinist with the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic, the orchestra has an annual operating budget of $800,000 and 
carries a yearly deficit of approximately $300,000. Major support comes from 
corporate sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
"Our audiences are not socialites," says Victor Wong, the orchestra's general 
manager. "Rather, they're everyday and corporate types."

JIM HALL LETS HIS GUITAR DO THE TALKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Hall speaks softly and carries an electric guitar. If he has never attained 
the fame many fellow musicians feel he has earned, it could be due to the lack 
of any aggressive trait in his personality. 
</P>
<P>
He is nevertheless secure, having been sought out by some of the most eminent 
soloists in jazz. At present he has his own quartet, has managed to bring it 
with him from New York, and will be appearing tonight at McCabe's in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy with this group," Hall said during a recent visit to Los Angeles 
with his wife, Jane, a psychoanalyst. "Gil Goldstein, who plays piano and 
synthesizer, was the synth player in Gil Evans' last band. Terry Clarke is a 
drummer from Canada -- I've worked with him off and on for years -- and Steve 
La Spina is an incredible bass player. We have an album out on Concorde." ("All 
Across the City," CCD 4384.) 
</P>
<P>
When Hall talks about himself, you have the feeling that he might rather be 
dealing with some other topic. Tennis, for instance, inspired some of his 
compositions ("Cross Court," "Down the Line" and, on the new album, "Drop 
Shot"); among his friends he numbers Don Budge and several other kings of the 
court, as well as the cartoonist Gary Larson, who took guitar lessons from him 
all summer and became a good pal. ("We're going up to see him in Seattle -- 
he's doing the cover for a new book I'm writing, a combination instruction and 
personal reflection book.") 
</P>
<P>
When the conversation drifts to musicians, he finds succinct comments on some 
of the giants with whom he has worked: 
</P>
<P>
* On Ben Webster, the legendary ex-Ellington saxophonist: "I was living out 
here in Los Angeles; Ben didn't have a car and was a bachelor. I was the only 
other bachelor in the group and always had to chauffeur him around, which was 
an honor. The others were Jimmy Rowles, Red Mitchell and Frank Butler; in fact, 
Contemporary just put out an album we made with that band." ("Ben Webster at 
the Renaissance," OJCCD 390-2). 
</P>
<P>
* On pianist Bill Evans: "He was a friend of mine in New York and was a big 
influence on my playing before he made that duo album in 1959." 
</P>
<P>
* On Paul Desmond: "He was one of our closest friends. He used to come over and 
play Scrabble with Jane all the time, and he was just as brilliant at that as 
he was playing the saxophone. I just sat there and watched them." 
</P>
<P>
* On saxophonist Lee Konitz: "I did some duet work with Lee, which at times was 
fantastic, but at other times it was difficult, because if he didn't feel like 
playing he'd just stand there and pout. But it was a great experience." 
</P>
<P>
* On Sonny Rollins: "Joining Sonny was probably the best move I ever made. 
During that year and a half with him a lot of people came to accept me who 
might not even have heard me otherwise. I came to the attention of Art Blakey, 
Max Roach, people like that who put their stamp of approval on me. John 
Coltrane used to come in; he influences me tremendously with his use of 
thematic material, his ability to take a tune apart and just sort of examine 
it. But Sonny himself was a prime force -- an incredible virtuoso." 
</P>
<P>
* Art Farmer: "I was with Art right after I left Sonny. He had just switched 
from trumpet to fluegelhorn. I loved Art's lyricism, just as I did Miles' 
playing." 
</P>
<P>
"Which Miles do you mean?" 
</P>
<P>
Hall laughed. "Well, let's say especially the group he had with Coltrane, Bill 
Evans and Cannonball Adderley. I worked opposite that band at one time and had 
wonderful opportunities to appreciate what they were doing." 
</P>
<P>
To these names, Hall added those of Chico Hamilton, the drummer in whose unique 
chamber jazz quintet he played in 1959, and Jimmy Giuffre, of whom he observes: 
"Jimmy was a sort of father figure to me. He helped me in many ways, 
influencing my phrasing, showing me how to blend with his sax or clarinet, and 
how to get rid of picking noises." 
</P>
<P>
Hall has often been compared to Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt, whose 
records he listened to as a young man in Cleveland. Not surprisingly, he still 
attempts to achieve a sound quality that is not hampered by electronics. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have my old Gibson guitar and my old tube amplifier. I try to keep 
that sound going, but it gets harder all the time, because the equipment falls 
apart and the engineers' ears have changed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so rough to go into a studio -- and this happened to me in Argentina just 
as it happens here -- and find some emissary coming out from the control booth 
and saying 'Can't you get more highs on that amp?' That's just the opposite of 
what I want, of course." 
</P>
<P>
In one small Italian town, he says, at an attractive hall that had been built 
for intimate recitals, "we walked in and found these stacks of speakers on the 
stage hissing away. It was like defiling the place. I just said, 'Get those 
things out of here!' and we wound up doing the concert almost acoustically." 
</P>
<P>
Another contretemps was avoided when Hall went to Rio two years ago. "There was 
an ironic touch here, because it was advertised as 'Free Jazz Festival,' and of 
course I assumed they expected to hear me play free jazz; but that turned out 
to be just the name of the cigarette company that was sponsoring what was 
actually a rather loud, electric fusion kind of festival. Well, I just came 
onstage with my guitar and my little amp, and I think I won the critics over 
with a sort of reverse psychology. 
</P>
<P>
"In general, I love Brazilian music; one musician I greatly admire is Egberto 
Gismonti, the guitarist, composer and pianist. I love Bill Frisell's work, too; 
and there are a couple of students at the Parsons School of Design in New York, 
where I'm a teacher, who show great promise. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, I'd say yes, I have hope for the future, including my own. It's sort 
of come full circle, to where I'm learning from the younger guys; and that's 
fine with me." 
</P>

THE D.O.C.

"Calling Dr. Dre.... Calling Dr. Dre.... Calling Dr. Dre," the young record 
producer known as Dr. Dre droned mockingly as he sat in a Westside deli one 
recent morning. 
</P>
<P>
Dre, wearing a Raiders cap, jacket and warm-up pants, was hoping to dig into 
his hefty ham-and-cheese omelet, but his pager kept going off, signaling 
another call -- probably one more record executive trying to get in touch with 
this suddenly hot producer. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, Dr. Dre (real name: Andre Young) has produced hit albums for 
N.W.A, Eazy-E, J.J. Fad and the D.O.C., and there's nothing like success in the 
record business to get the phone ringing. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, a producer in black music has been considered as crucial to the 
success of a record as a songwriter is in country music. The list of celebrated 
producers ranges from Bumps Blackwell and Sam Phillips to Phil Spector to 
Motown's Holland-Dozier-Holland and Philadelphia International's Gamble &amp; 
Huff to the omnipotent Quincy Jones to Richard Perry and Willie Mitchell to 
such contemporary hotshots as Prince, Teddy Riley, Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis, 
L.A. &amp; Babyface and Matt Dike and Mike Ross. 
</P>
<P>
Just joining the pack: Dr. Dre. 
</P>
<P>
That's why his beeper keeps beeping -- even at the breakfast table. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Dre picked up a portable phone and snapped, "Yo! Make it quick." 
</P>
<P>
After the conversation, he put down the phone and returned to his omelet. 
</P>
<P>
"Where were we?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Before the phone call, Dr. Dre, who's also a composer and a member of the 
controversial rap group N.W.A, had begun to explain how he helps create all 
those hits. 
</P>
<P>
From his quizzical frowning, you'd have thought he'd been asked a question 
about nuclear physics. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what I do, I just do it," he said. "I don't know how to explain 
it, because I learned how to be a producer myself through trial and error. It's 
instinct. It's feel. It's knowing what's happening on the street. It's judgment 
-- what I think will work and what won't. A lot of it is very spontaneous. A 
lot of D.O.C.'s album was done on the spot in the studio." 
</P>
<P>
What's his biggest asset as a producer? 
</P>
<P>
"My ear," he replied. "I have a good ear for what's authentic, for what people 
will like. For street rap, it has to sound real, like the kids were overhearing 
somebody talk on the street. A lot of rap is phony -- talking about stuff 
people don't care about and talking about it in a way that doesn't sound real. 
Our stuff is hip because it's real. The fans can tell right away." 
</P>
<P>
Along with Dike and Ross, the team behind Tone Loc, Dr. Dre, 24, is one of the 
reasons Los Angeles rap has hit the mainstream in a big way this year. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the stereotypical rapper, Dr. Dre doesn't come across as an egomaniac. 
During the interview, he was fairly aloof and serious -- a bit nervous, in 
fact, at least initially. Doing interviews clearly isn't one of his favorite 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Dre works for Ruthless Records, a record label and production company 
founded by Eazy-E, who grew up with him in Compton. He calls it one big happy 
musical family, with Dr. Dre, the D.O.C, Ice Cube and the various artists 
writing for all the albums, and with Dr. Dre guiding the productions, with 
assistance from D. J. Yella. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to popular belief, Eazy-E isn't the company's primary creative force, 
though he's listed as executive producer on the albums. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the main creative force in the company," Dr. Dre insisted 
matter-of-factly. "Eazy is business-oriented. He knows street rap, but not the 
pop side of things. He doesn't have the final say in terms of production; I do. 
He's the business man, but I'm the music man, the production man." 
</P>
<P>
"Versatility is my middle name," Dr. Dre said -- one of the few times he blew 
his own horn. It's not a idle boast. There is remarkable diversity in his 
productions. Those electric, hip-hop rhythms -- the sound of the street, 
according to Dre -- are a common denominator in his four hit albums. But 
they're all different, covering the rap spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
N.W.A's "Straight Outta Compton" is a dark, explosive album full of anger and 
rage about ghetto life. Its most famous song is "---- Tha Police," which 
includes such savage, anti-law-enforcement commentary that it inspired an FBI 
representative to write a letter of complaint to Priority Records, which 
distributes Ruthless. 
</P>
<P>
"N.W.A is nasty and hard-core," Dr. Dre said. "N.W.A is about what the kids in 
Compton are feeling. That's how they feel about the cops. That's why they can 
relate to that song. We didn't make this stuff up. It's right there. Get any 
kid out of Compton and put a mike in his hand and tell him to rap. What you'll 
get is the same kind of stuff as on the N.W.A album. The next N.W.A album is 
going to be even more hard-core." 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the spectrum is J.J. Fad, the female trio that offers 
clean-cut raps about romance. Eazy-E's album is what Dr. Dre calls street 
funny, mostly ribald and good-natured. "Eazy tells funny stories and makes you 
laugh," Dr. Dre said. 
</P>
<P>
The D.O.C.'s album is also clean-cut rap -- but with a hard edge. "There's 
strong, street beats and strong delivery, but no profanity," Dr. Dre said. "We 
tried to put a hard-core song on it, but Atlantic Records (which distributes 
the album) took it off. This song could have been on an N.W.A album but 
Atlantic didn't want anything like that for the D.O.C. album." 
</P>
<P>
The D.O.C. is a 21-year-old rapper that Dr. Dre discovered in Texas. "I liked 
the fact that he has a tight delivery and a strong voice," Dr. Dre said. "He's 
also a fast writer. He was raw, but I was sure he could be shaped into a good 
rapper." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Dre's next album, due out soon, features R&amp;B singer Michel'le -- who 
doesn't rap. "I wanted to try something a little different," he explained. "Her 
album has a rap feel. The songs have rap music tracks -- the kind you'd hear on 
a rap album -- but Michel'le is doing vocals, not rap. A lot of radio stations 
won't play rap but would play a song with vocals that has a rap feel." 
</P>
<P>
You'd think a producer who's had such great pop success -- mainly with J.J. Fad 
and the D.O.C -- would be gearing songs to radio when he's at work in the 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care about radio," he said. "When I'm working on records, I don't try 
to make anything for radio. What radio does is makes records sell faster. Rap 
can sell without radio. Look at N.W.A. That album sold without radio airplay." 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, he's not big on sampling either. Sampling -- using snippets of 
old records as musical building blocks -- is the backbone of rap. Dr. Dre, 
though, is critical of this practice. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't sample like you used to," he pointed out. "The problem is the 
popularity of CDs. When you use parts of those old records, you get a lot of 
hiss. Now that CDs are so popular, you need a clean sound. The thing to do is 
to not use the originals but to re-record what you want to use so you'll have 
good sound and no hiss. 
</P>
<P>
"But I've been trying to get away from sampling. I won't do it unless I have 
to. There are other ways." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Dre spent most of his life in the ghettos of Compton and Paramount. "I'm 
from the streets," he said. "That's important. I know what street rap sounds 
like. I've lived it. I stay in touch with it." 
</P>
<P>
But with all that money he's making, these days Dr. Dre can afford to sample 
street life only when he has to. He's graduated from the ghetto -- having moved 
to to Westlake. After breakfast, he had to rush home because some new furniture 
was being delivered. 
</P>
<P>
"After all those years I like being somewhere where I don't have to worry about 
walking outside and getting shot," he said. "I can leave the key under the mat 
in the place in Westlake. If you do that where I used to live, it's an 
invitation to be ripped off." 
</P>
<P>
A recent theft was, for him, unofficial affirmation of his decision to move. 
While being driven by Michel'le, an R&amp;B singer whose album he just 
produced, his Mercedes was stolen at gunpoint in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had enough of that kind of stuff," he said. "Living in these dangerous 
places gets to you. You have to get out to keep your sanity. The peaceful life 
is nice." 
</P>
<P>
But, while he was living in those dangerous places, Dr. Dre acquired the source 
material for the rap records that have turned him into a prominent 
record-industry figure. Working as a deejay in Compton clubs in the mid-'80s, 
Dr. Dre -- who has no musical training and, he admitted, can't even carry a 
tune -- developed an interest in producing. 
</P>
<P>
"Me and D.J. Yella would copy other people's records and make the changes we 
wanted to make," he recalled. "We set up a demo studio in back of this one club 
and worked on demos all week. Then we'd play them on the weekends at the clubs. 
I knew how I wanted those records to sound. Then I decided I wanted to produce 
my own records." 
</P>
<P>
That's where his old buddy Eazy-E came in. Dr. Dre approached Eazy-E, who has 
said that he financed his company with proceeds from his drug dealing, to 
invest in a group called HBO. That deal fizzled because the group balked at 
doing a song that later became the first single for Eazy. That single, 
"Boyz-N-the-Hood," and N.W.A's "Dopeman" single, launched Dr. Dre's career as a 
producer in late 1986. By early this year, those artists had hit albums, 
produced by Dr. Dre. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Dre is a rapper too, working with N.W.A. He's quite modest about his 
rapping skills -- though he's very effective on "Express Yourself," a cut on 
the N.W.A album. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a great rapper," he said. "I'm not as good as D.O.C. or Cube. I know 
what it should sound like, but I can't quite do it myself as well as I'd like 
to. As a producer I know what it's supposed to sound like -- and my raps aren't 
quite strong enough. That's why my future is in producing and writing -- not 
rapping."

INDIFFERENCE TOWARD INDIGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes it takes a cataclysm to remind us that we depend on each other more 
than we often take time to acknowledge. San Francisco's 15-second earthquake 
Tuesday is such an event, one that reaches out even as far as Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Here, however, a crisis of a different sort is evolving, one that has been 
building up pressure over the last 15 or 20 years. It has to do with the 
county's indifference to its indigent. Partly because of the county's very 
affluence, many who have lived on the economic edge have slipped over and are 
finding it harder and harder to get back into the mainstream. What is needed 
now is something that has not been provided to this point: leadership and 
vision on the part of the Board of Supervisors in the areas of welfare, housing 
and health. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, the workfare program, part of the General Relief program for 
indigent adults that is fully funded at the county level. As Supervisor Roger 
R. Stanton pointed out in The Times' series last week: "Does Orange County 
Care?" it is politic to support workfare as a way to keep laggards off the 
welfare rolls. If cost savings is the goal, however, it is a failure. The 
county itself has done no cost studies since 1982, but a Times analysis 
indicated the program is actually losing money for the county. As for 
instilling the work ethic in recipients, the lesson is lost on opportunists 
while those who really want jobs find it virtually impossible to fulfill their 
work assignments while looking for a job. 
</P>
<P>
The series also pointed out that the county's health care crisis is worsening, 
particularly in two areas: the closing of trauma centers, which are 
money-losing operations for hospitals, and obstetrical care for indigent 
mothers. The Orange County Health Care Task Force compared the obstetrical 
problem to a "3.5 Richter scale precursor to a 9.5 health-care earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the health crisis has to do with state funding formulas that heavily 
favor urban counties. But also the county spends fewer dollars per capita on 
health care for the poor than other counties. 
</P>
<P>
As for housing, the board six years ago caved into pressure from builders whom 
it had earlier required to build low- and moderate-income housing as a part of 
all new housing projects. The board had counted on free-market forces to 
provide affordable housing, but so far that has failed. Combined with few 
efforts by cities to build low-cost housing, and the county's overheated 
housing market, it is no surprise that the homeless now number 10,000, half of 
them children. 
</P>
<P>
There are some indications the board is beginning to register the seriousness 
of the problems. Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder helped organize a health 
conference last week focusing on indigent health care. And more attention is 
being paid to advocates for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
What is needed now is leadership, and that is something that the board has a 
unique responsibility to provide.

VOTE YES ON MEASURE M: TAX IS WORTH THE BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those who drive around Orange County don't need a public opinion poll to tell 
them what they already know: traffic is terrible. Measure M, on the ballot Nov. 
7, would provide $3.1 billion over 20 years -- financed by a half-cent sales 
tax -- to begin to alleviate the bumper-to-bumper traffic that mars the county 
as a place to live and work. We support the measure. 
</P>
<P>
A half-cent increase would raise the current sales tax to 6 1/2 cents per 
dollar and cost the average consumer $50 to $75 per year -- not an 
insignificant amount. But when weighed against the benefits, it seems well 
worth it. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would earmark 42% of the money for freeway improvements and most of 
the rest for regional, transit and other road improvements. Among the projects 
are speeding completion of the Santa Ana Freeway widening, rebuilding the El 
Toro "Y" interchange of the Santa Ana and the San Diego freeways, building a 
220-mile network of "super-streets," expanding rail service and coordinating 
traffic signals, and adding lanes to stretches of Interstate 5 and the 
Riverside, Orange and Costa Mesa freeways. 
</P>
<P>
It sounds like a wish list for every weary traveler in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The Yes on Measure M campaign, backed by developers to the tune of $1 million, 
has the unanimous support of the Board of Supervisors. But, surprisingly, the 
measure has also drawn support from several prominent slow-growth advocates who 
usually find themselves on the opposite side of the board and developers. This 
is primarily because the measure also would require cities to adopt 
growth-management plans. There is little organized opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, 11 counties in California have half-cent sales taxes for 
transportation, including every county contiguous to Orange County except for 
San Bernardino, which now has a similar tax before voters. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Countians soundly defeated a one-cent tax increase for transportation in 
1984. A poll conducted for The Times Orange County Edition late last year found 
that people are very skeptical of government's ability to use the money wisely. 
</P>
<P>
But now, traffic is even worse and people's frustration levels are higher. And 
surely we realize that in these battened-down days, the billions of dollars 
needed to begin to have an impact on traffic are not sitting around unspent. 
The money must come from somewhere. And the support of slow-growth leaders 
indicates that Measure M has met one important standard that residents said 
they wanted if they provide new tax money for transportation -- strict growth 
management. 
</P>
<P>
A half-cent sales tax increase, while unpleasant, seems the least painful way 
to finance these vitally needed transportation improvements.

STATISTIC BECOMES A REAL PERSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As we stood by our Food for All display in front of a market in Costa Mesa last 
week trying to encourage participation in Food for All by raising awareness of 
hunger, a poignant encounter took place. A young woman showed interest in our 
information. 
</P>
<P>
The young woman commented that she hoped people would help soon because she was 
looking for a place to find food on Saturday and Sunday. She told us she was 
homeless, living in some bushes near a building, and had recently had a baby. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly this young mother was no longer a statistic to us, but a real person 
with hurting eyes and an immediate problem of finding diapers and food on the 
weekend, when most emergency feeding programs are shut down. We felt a little 
better that at least we were able to tell her our church was preparing a dinner 
at the Orange Coast Interfaith Shelter that evening. One meal would help, but 
her problem remains. 
</P>
<P>
This young woman is only one of the thousands who do not have a decent shelter 
at night, and who, with her baby, is in need of food and help. With all the 
rich blessings that many in Orange County enjoy, it is time for us as a society 
to open our hearts. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, Food for All has funded 16 agencies in Orange County who help the 
hungry, with a total of $49,250 (a figure which is close to the median income 
of just one Orange County household). While these contributions have helped, 
when you consider our population of more than 2 million, it does seem we have 
the potential for more giving to help the 360,000 who are at daily risk of not 
having enough to eat.

IRVINE'S HUMAN RIGHTS ORDINANCE; 
</P>
<P>
NO: LAW WOULD BE A SETBACK -- NO ONE'S RIGHTS ARE SECURE UNLESS EVERYONE'S 
RIGHTS ARE SECURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAULA WERNER, Paula Werner is a member of the Irvine City Council and the 
advisory board of Irvine Citizens United Against Discrimination. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's happening in Irvine? Apparently a host of accomplishments. Business 
leaders rank Irvine as No. 1. Irvine's schools are judged best in the county 
and nation, and UCI boasts prestigious scholars and growing research 
endowments. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Irvine's city government is being acclaimed statewide and 
nationwide for its model programs in child care, recycling, open-space 
preservation, protection of the ozone layer, and for its public/private 
partnerships in building a theater, creating a new transportation authority, 
and establishing international trade opportunities and exchanges. And, of 
special importance to me, Irvine is applauded for its comprehensive human 
rights ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of us choose to live in Irvine because of these exemplary programs 
and innovations. We know our city is a special place because we've worked and 
learned and legislated to make it so. I'm proud of all that Irvine is and of 
the diverse, multi-ethnic, multi-religious gathering of citizens who call 
Irvine home. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this pride in what Irvine is and who we are, I am disturbed by the 
small group of misguided neighbors who have placed an initiative on our 
November ballot -- known as Measure N -- that seeks to legalize discrimination 
and destroy the human rights advances we've worked so hard to secure. 
</P>
<P>
The Human Rights Ordinance is very simple and easy to understand. It outlaws 
discrimination based on "race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, 
sexual orientation, marital status and physical handicap" in the business of 
housing, employment and commercial transactions. Churches, small businesses and 
homeowners who rent rooms are granted exemption. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance is a simple and beautiful statement of the right of all persons 
to be free from discrimination. In addition, it tells all citizens that they 
are needed and welcomed and are encouraged to participate in the life of the 
city. It is supported by both the previous and current City Council members, by 
ministers, rabbis, congregational leaders, community volunteers, our 
award-winning teachers of the year, and by civic, cultural, educational and 
business people who are the builders and keepers of the Irvine dream. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance bestows no special rights on anyone, only the right to be free 
from discrimination. Let me state emphatically that this human rights ordinance 
is not about gay pride festivals, homosexual hiring quotas or imposing a San 
Francisco gay culture on Irvine. It is not about AIDS or any other sexual or 
health issue, or about promoting gay role models for our children. The Irvine 
Human Rights Ordinance does not apply to schools, since they already follow 
state education codes regarding non-discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Quite simply, this election is about keeping Irvine's year-old human rights 
ordinance in place. Proponents of Measure N seek to destroy the ordinance by 
legalizing discrimination against one specific group of people -- gays and 
lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote on Measure N means that gays and lesbians will be singled out for 
discrimination in jobs and housing. We can't permit this to happen. We can't 
permit discrimination that denies our neighbors their right to a job or to keep 
a roof over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
If we allow certain fear-mongers to pick and choose who belongs in Irvine, 
where does their discrimination stop? What about Latinos, Japanese, blacks, 
Jews, Koreans or unmarried couples living together? We must not surrender to a 
campaign of rejection and intolerance. As we have learned in Nazi Germany, 
South Africa and China, no one's rights are secure unless everyone's rights are 
secure. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors of Measure N contend that the City Council has a "homosexual agenda." 
There is absolutely no truth in that charge. The Irvine City Council has no 
racial agenda, or homosexual agenda, or religious agenda. In fact, the agenda 
before the City Council is non-ideological and plain for all to see. We seek to 
maintain the current high level of services and programs, providing for 
expected growth while meeting our need for roads, open space, cultural 
activities and human services. The goal of the City Council is a city of 
inclusion, not exclusion; a city free from discrimination for all who live or 
work in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
As American citizens, we can't permit a few misguided extremists to turn back 
the clock on human rights. We must continue to reaffirm our heritage of 
democratic inclusiveness, building an even better community. 
</P>
<P>
I've found that my religious beliefs and commitment to democratic principles 
influence the actions I take as a public official. Accordingly, I have joined 
with Irvine Citizens United Against Discrimination to work for the defeat of 
Measure N. I encourage my friends and neighbors -- builders and keepers of the 
Irvine dream -- to join me on Nov. 7 in voting no on Measure N.

while they're young), I wish Irvine's Mayor Larry Agran every success in 
getting the same liquor companies to pay for a forum investigating alcohol 
abuse among the young.

WAGE HIKE FOR TRANSIT DISTRICT MECHANICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How interesting to learn about the generous 12% wage boost afforded the 
mechanics and service workers at Orange County Transit District (Oct. 17) 
through auspices of the Teamsters Union. 
</P>
<P>
While the Teamsters are not yet in power as a representative of OCTD, they have 
negotiated a contract by simply ignoring the United Transportation Union, which 
is currently the bargaining agent with some months remaining on its contract. 
</P>
<P>
What is even more difficult to understand is the clause in this new contract 
that calls for pay bonuses for employees who meet attendance and productivity 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
Once again the OCTD management shows us how it "manages" the bottomless pit of 
money that taxpayers continue to throw at it. Strange as it may seem, I always 
felt that it was up to the management to see to it that the employees showed up 
at the job every day, otherwise they are fired. 
</P>
<P>
And as far as bonuses for productivity goals, again, they either produce as the 
standards require or, again, we fire them. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to have the OCTD explain the details of this $500 pay bonus plan 
to coerce employees to show up for their jobs and/or to perform to the work 
standards as established.

TEENS AND ALCOHOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I protest your headlines and the survey questions about alcohol use in the Oct. 
10 edition as alarmist and as planting a distorted view of teen-agers in the 
minds of the general public. A "frequent" user was one who reported drinking or 
smoking on at least 20 days in the last six months. That means that on one of 
nine days the youngster had a cup of beer or had three cups of beer at one 
party one time in a month. Do you really believe that realistically defines a 
"frequent" drinker? I vehemently disagree. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-agers are maligned by this kind of writing and reporting. What about a 
similar survey of your employees or the Task Force, stepping up your limits 
even slightly. Would your employees or the committee itself not appear to be 
depraved? Give the kids a break. Use headlines responsibly.

MEASURE M: '2 VIEWS ON SALES TAX HIKE FOR ROADS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sherry Lee Meddick (Oct. 8) isn't looking for traffic solutions; she's looking 
for an excuse not to vote for the one-half cent increase in the sales tax, a 
provision in Measure M, the Orange County Traffic Improvement and Growth 
Management Program. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't cause the problems," Sherry stated. It is too easy to fix the blame 
on wealthy developers for the traffic mess. If you live in Orange County, work 
here, go shopping, visit friends and relatives, or go to a show, you have to 
drive a car or take a bus. All of us have caused the problems. Shouldn't the 
people who use the system support it? Everyone in Orange County will benefit 
from a local tax that provides relief for a local problem. 
</P>
<P>
We have relied too long on the 9-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax to provide what 
we need. Nine cents (California has raised its gas tax only once in 20 years) 
doesn't provide much in 1989 dollars, due to inflation and the increase in auto 
efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
It is analogous to your boss saying that he gave you a raise 10 years ago; now, 
make do. Look folks, we are talking about one-half-cent on every dollar we 
spend (not on food or medicine). That's one-half of a penny. Considering it's 
almost impossible to buy anything for a penny, I'm impressed that the 
accumulation of the one-half cents will provide so much!

OREGON ST. LATEST TO EMBARRASS BRUINS; 
</P>
<P>
UCLA: IT FAILS TO CONTAIN OREGON STATE'S RUNNING ATTACK IN 18-17 DEFEAT. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before its exuberant fans tore down the goalposts Saturday, Oregon State 
stripped away a little bit more of UCLA's prestige. 
</P>
<P>
The Beavers all but eliminated the Bruins from the Rose Bowl race, rallying for 
an 18-17 victory in front of a rain-soaked crowd of 21,510 at Parker Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
After its second consecutive loss dropped UCLA to 3-4 overall and 2-2 in the 
Pacific 10 Conference, Coach Terry Donahue said that the Bruins were "obviously 
in a rebuilding-type process." 
</P>
<P>
Wasn't it only a year ago that UCLA was ranked No. 1? 
</P>
<P>
"We did not expect to be 3-4," Donahue said. "Obviously, the players and 
coaches and myself are really disappointed with our record and our performance 
to date. Right now, our season's not good." 
</P>
<P>
It got a lot worse with 1 minute 20 seconds left Saturday, when sophomore guard 
Scott Spalding was called for holding as the Bruins attempted to position 
Alfredo Velasco for a game-winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, which trailed throughout the game, rallied behind reserve quarterback Jim 
Bonds to open a 17-10 lead with 7:47 left, only to have Oregon State drive down 
the field to score and make it 18-17. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds rallied the Bruins again, moving them to the Beavers' 28-yard line, where 
tailback Kevin Williams gained two yards through the middle. 
</P>
<P>
But, instead of facing third-and-four at that point, UCLA faced second-and-16 
because Spalding was called for holding. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a couple of chances there to overcome the call and to do it anyway, but 
we were unable to do it," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds overthrew tight end Randy Austin on second down, then was belted by 
defensive end Pellom McDaniels and cornerback Torey Overstreet on third down. 
The ball fell harmlessly to the ground, an incomplete pass. 
</P>
<P>
Velasco was called upon for a 55-yard field-goal attempt, which fell short of 
the soon-to-be uprooted south goalpost. 
</P>
<P>
"The (holding) penalty was the whole ballgame," Oregon State Coach Dave 
Kragthorpe said. "Without it, he makes the kick." 
</P>
<P>
Spalding, fighting back tears, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
The call "influenced the game dramatically," said Donahue, who seemed to 
question the timing of it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's holding that goes on every single play," said Donahue, a former Bruin 
defensive lineman. "If you get too sloppy with your hands and too free with 
your hands, they're going to call it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm assuming he got too sloppy or free with his hands." 
</P>
<P>
If the officials hadn't made the call, Donahue said, "we'd be talking about a 
hell of a UCLA comeback." 
</P>
<P>
Forgotten, perhaps, would be Oregon State's surprisingly easy drive to the 
game-winning points. 
</P>
<P>
A fumble by quarterback Matt Booher, who had the ball knocked out of his hands 
by linebacker Craig Davis, set up a 19-yard drive by UCLA that resulted in a 
two-yard touchdown run by Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Williams swept around the left end and trotted into the end zone after a block 
by fullback Mark Estwick cut down linebacker Todd McKinney, who was knocked 
head over heels and had to be helped off the field. 
</P>
<P>
Ahead at that point, 15-10, the Bruins went for two points and Bonds rifled a 
pass to tight end Corwin Anthony in the right corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
But, as has been the case so often this season, the Bruins were not up to the 
task that awaited them in the game's most crucial moments. 
</P>
<P>
Booher, who completed 13 of 24 passes for 145 yards and directed an offense 
that generated 284 total yards to UCLA's 266, was perfect on his last five 
passes, including a 16-yard pass to Jason Kent on third-and-eight at Oregon 
State's 35-yard line, which got the winning drive moving. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA blitzed when the Beavers faced second-and-seven at the Bruins' 24, but 
Oregon State picked it up and Kent, facing man-to-man coverage, worked himself 
free behind cornerback Carlton Gray and Booher found him. 
</P>
<P>
"He just beat me," Gray said of Kent. "There's really no excuse. Sometimes it 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
The 23-yard pass put the Beavers at the one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Chaffey, who ran for a career-high 118 yards and two touchdowns in 27 carries, 
scored on the next play to make it 17-16. 
</P>
<P>
"They went right through us and I can't tell you why," Donahue said of the 
Beavers' 67-yard game-winning drive. "It's kind of the nature of our football 
team this year. 
</P>
<P>
"When we've had to play great defense to stop them, we've been unable to, and 
when we've had to play great offense to score, we've been unable to." 
</P>
<P>
The worst, though, was yet to come for the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
On the two-point conversion attempt that followed, Reggie Pitchford drifted out 
of the backfield and no Bruin defender picked him up. 
</P>
<P>
Booher lofted the ball to him in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State aligned two wideouts to the left and they slanted inside, clearing 
the left flat for Pitchford. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't get lined up in time," Donahue said. "It looked like our defensive 
backs were just really slow getting lined up on the overloaded play and we 
never got it covered properly. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy was so wide open, it was a joke." 
</P>
<P>
It was no joke that, when the gun sounded 3 1/2 minutes later, Oregon State had 
improved to 3-3-1, its best record at this stage of the season since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider this the greatest win since I've been at OSU," said Kragthorpe, who 
arrived from Idaho State in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The game began under dark skies and in a heavy downpour and Oregon State took 
advantage of the first of four first-quarter turnovers, opening an early 7-0 
lead after nose tackle Esera Tuaolo ripped through the Bruin line and knocked 
the ball loose from quarterback Bret Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive tackle Mike Maggiore recovered at UCLA's 18-yard line and, two plays 
later, Chaffey scored his first touchdown on a 10-yard run, bursting through 
the right side and veering toward the outside. 
</P>
<P>
Velasco was wide to the right on a 40-yard field-goal attempt midway through 
the quarter, but a fumble recovery by Dion Lambert, who fell on the ball after 
Davis jarred it loose from tailback Jerrell Waddell, set up a 26-yard field 
goal by UCLA's senior kicker only a few minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA produced only another field goal through the first 30 minutes and, with 
the Bruins trailing at halftime, 10-6.

TITANS PAY PRICE FOR MISSED OPPORTUNITIES

<TEXT>
<P>
The chance Cal State Fullerton wasn't supposed to have was right there in front 
of the Titans in the fourth quarter Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State's Bulldogs, undefeated this season -- undefeated in their past 13 
games, in fact -- had a seven-point lead over Fullerton. But Fullerton added a 
chapter to a legacy of bungled opportunities, killing their own chances with a 
penalty-ridden defensive series that ended in a Fresno touchdown and a 33-19 
Big West Conference loss in front of 32,135 in Bulldog Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
After trailing, 26-3, in the third quarter, Fullerton scored two touchdowns, 
both times going for the two-point conversion, and both times making it. After 
the second successful conversion, the Titans had cut the lead to 26-19 with 
9:21 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans then forced Fresno to punt, but were held on four downs themselves. 
</P>
<P>
On the next possession, Fullerton backed Fresno into a fourth-and-three 
situation and the Bulldogs set up to punt. 
</P>
<P>
But Fullerton's Darrell Bruce ran into the kicker, giving Fresno an automatic 
first down. As if that weren't enough, punt receiver Nuygen Pendleton was 
penalized for signaling a fair catch and then returning the kick, adding an 
extra five yards to Fresno's windfall. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans nursed the Fresno State drive along with repeated penalties -- 
including a personal foul call on second-and-27 that gave Fresno another first 
down. Fresno finally scored on Aaron Craver's 14-yard run with 2:25 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
With that, Fresno won its 14th consecutive game, breaking a school record set 
in 1960-62, and Coach Jim Sweeney had his 150th career victory. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Coach Gene Murphy said Fresno is "definitely" a top 20 team. 
</P>
<P>
"We played a hell of a football team," Murphy said. "You can't take anything 
away from Fresno State. They are the best football team we've played to this 
point." 
</P>
<P>
But there was complaining from Fullerton about some calls -- including a fumble 
on Fresno's final scoring drive that the Titans' Terry Tramble covered. 
Officials ruled that the runner was already down. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to look at the films, of course," Murphy said. "But I really think 
there were poor calls. We'll find out because (the camera) doesn't lie." 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney said the fumble recovery was on his sideline. 
</P>
<P>
"The first official saw a Fullerton player reach for the ball and assumed they 
recovered it. But the the referee saw (a Fresno player) recover it." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Pringle, who finished with 116 yards rushing, also complained. 
</P>
<P>
"It was flagrant bad calls in my opinion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But aside from the early and late going, Fresno State dominated, out-gaining 
Fullerton, 408 yards to 238. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton quarterback Dan Speltz was sacked 10 times, six times by Ron Cox. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've ever seen a football player dominate a game like Ron Cox 
did tonight," Sweeney said. "He was in Speltz's face all night." 
</P>
<P>
It was a game that figured to be high-scoring. Fresno State came into the game 
averaging 42 points a game and Fullerton was scoring 27 a game. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, however, Fullerton led, 3-0, after the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
For the fifth game in a row, the Titans scored on their first possession, this 
time settling for a 42-yard field goal by Phil Nevin. The drive was thwarted -- 
as many others would be -- by a sack by Cox, the Fresno State outside 
linebacker who is one of 14 finalists for the Butkus Award, given to the 
nation's top linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (3-4-1, 2-2) had other chances in the first half, many of them served 
up by Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Barsotti, the Bulldog quarterback, threw an interception on Fresno's first 
play of the game, giving the Titans the ball at their own 29. But Fullerton 
wasted the opportunity, losing 14 yards in its next three plays and had to 
punt. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton intercepted Barsotti twice more in the first half, but didn't score 
either time. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno didn't drive deeper than the Titan 24 in the first quarter, failing to 
score when Steve Loop missed a 41-yard field-goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
By the second quarter, Fresno State had gathered itself, however and scored 
three touchdowns, two on sustained drives and the third after the Bulldogs 
recovered a fumble at the Titan 18 caused -- how else? -- by another Cox sack. 
</P>
<P>
Myron Jones' plowed into the end zone after a swing pass on the next play. The 
point failed, leaving the score, 20-3, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tight end Bill Brennan tore ligaments in his knee and is out for the season. . 
. . Receiver Mark Hill suffered a shoulder injury in the first half and did not 
return. . . . Mike Pringle pulled a muscle and missed several plays. "He played 
with pain," Coach Gene Murphy said.

ORANGE COUNTY CHAMPIONSHIPS; 
</P>
<P>
WITH SADDLEBACK AWAY, SAN CLEMENTE WINS

<P>
The question was inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Would Bill Hartman's San Clemente High School boys' cross-country team still 
have been able to win the Orange County Cross-Country Championships Saturday if 
Saddleback, the county's top-ranked team, had participated? 
</P>
<P>
Few, including Coach Hartman, wanted to venture a guess. "I'm just glad we were 
able to prove ourselves today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the county's top teams competed in the county championships at Irvine 
Park in Orange, but Saddleback chose to compete in the Mt. SAC Invitational in 
Walnut. There, the Roadrunners placed fifth in the team sweepstakes division. 
</P>
<P>
But as it turned out, neither Saddleback's absence nor the light morning 
drizzle could dampen the spirit of county competition in the boys' and girls' 
seeded varsity races. 
</P>
<P>
In the boys' division, San Clemente, the county's second-ranked team, placed 
five runners in the top 40 to win, with 101 points. El Toro, ranked ninth, was 
second with 123, followed by Huntington Beach (134), Santa Ana (138) and Corona 
del Mar (139). 
</P>
<P>
The race started in a fury, with Jeff Matsumoto and Tom McCauley of Mater Dei 
leading a tight pack through the first half-mile in a near sprint. Once the 
runners hit the first steep, dirt hill, though, San Clemente's Mike Farrell 
surged to the front. 
</P>
<P>
Sweeping down the hill, past hundreds of fans roaring their approval, the 
runners nearly tumbled on the soft, steep turf as they headed back toward the 
flats. At 1 1/2 miles, Farrell ran with Matsumoto and Dana Hills' Daniel 
Niednagel at his side and five other runners a half-step behind. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at the two-mile mark, Farrell made his move, quickly leaving 
Niednagel, his South Coast League rival, and the others 10 yards behind. Over 
the final mile, the 6-foot-2, 145-pound Farrell let his lanky stride do the 
rest as he cruised in to win in 15:20, the fastest time of the day and six 
seconds ahead of Niednagel. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was gonna be me and Dan, me and Dan," said Farrell, who two weeks 
ago was outkicked by Niednagel in a South Coast League dual meet. The two will 
meet again Friday in the league finals, also at Irvine Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I got him by five seconds last time, he got me by six today," Niednagel said. 
"The only way to beat him is to stick with him and outkick him. I couldn't do 
it today." 
</P>
<P>
Those running against Katella's Martha Pinto know the feeling. 
</P>
<P>
Pinto, a junior, won the girls' varsity race four, one that highlighted teams 
with particularly talented individuals, in the fastest time of the day for 
girls, 17:35. 
</P>
<P>
Pinto now has run the fastest girls' time at the past three county 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
"This is her race every year," said Huntington Beach's Natalie Adam, who 
finished fourth in 18:23. "Martha's incredible." 
</P>
<P>
Pinto went out very fast -- as usual -- and didn't let up until she passed the 
first mile in 5:41 with a comfortable lead. Villa Park's Susannah Thrasher, 
second in 18:06, and Ocean View's Christie Engesser, third in 18:15, ran the 
second- and fourth-fastest times of the day. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were first starting, we were sprinting," Pinto said. "My coach said, 
'OK, slow it down,' but I was afraid to. I didn't want them to get ahead. After 
I got ahead, it was hard to keep up the pace because I was all alone." 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' seeded team race, No.1-ranked Woodbridge placed five runners in 
the top 25 to win, with 69 points. Fourth-ranked Irvine was second with 108, 
followed by Los Alamitos (153), Newport Harbor (159) and Capistrano Valley 
(168). 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor's Kim Robinson had little trouble winning the race in 18:10, as 
runner-up Tracy Fatone, a Los Alamitos sophomore, could attest. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the hardest race of my life," Fatone said. Then, pointing to 
Robinson, Fatone added: "She was always in front. Makes me sick! Do you realize 
how good you are?" 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, who won the same race last year in 18:22, said: "Coming down the last 
hill, I was afraid because they're all sprinters. I thought they were gonna get 
me. Especially Terri Smythers (third in 18:28) because she's really fast." 
</P>
<P>
The seeded girls' race featured 13 runners who finished in less than 19 minutes 
(five more than last year), and 40 girls under 20 minutes (eight more than last 
year). Kaci Keffer (sixth) and Cathi Peck (seventh) both ran 18:52 to lead 
Woodbridge to its first county title. 
</P>
<P>
"I had one wish today: that every team would do their best, because I wanted us 
to win it with everyone strong," Woodbridge Coach George Varvas said. "Today 
was kind of scary for me, but for my girls it was just another day in the park; 
you know, business as usual."

EDISON'S TAYLOR PICKS OFF NEVADA FRESHMAN TO WIN

When Edison High School sophomore Shelley Taylor got her first view of Miesha 
Marzell, Taylor was 80 meters behind her. 
</P>
<P>
Marzell, a freshman from Sparks, Nev., who is considered the nation's best 
freshman girls' runner, took off from the starting line in the girls' team 
sweepstakes race at the Mt. SAC Invitational Saturday and took an 80-meter lead 
over Taylor and Agoura's Deena Drossin in the first half mile. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I thought she'd die 'cause she doesn't know the course," Taylor 
said. "Then my coach said 'Catch her.' " 
</P>
<P>
Edison Coach Stan Stauble's words were enough for Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, undefeated this season, picked off Marzell at the 2 1/4-mile mark and 
built a 120-meter lead to win in a personal-best 17:50.3. Marzell (18:44.2) 
faded to fourth behind Drossin (18:15.2) and Kim Orlando (18:21.2) of Carson 
City, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm used to running hard hills in practice and (Marzell) slowed down a lot in 
the switchbacks," Taylor said. "She lost her stride completely." 
</P>
<P>
While Marzell was trying to maintain a tremendous lead over Taylor, Stauble had 
complete confidence in his runner. 
</P>
<P>
"(Marzell) didn't know who she had behind her," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura placed five runners in the top 28, including three in the top 10, to win 
the team sweepstakes title with 72 points. San Diego Mt. Carmel (116) finished 
second and Ventura Buena (126) was third. 
</P>
<P>
In the boys' sweepstakes race, Saddleback finished fifth behind Camarillo, the 
No. 1-ranked team in the state, which routed No. 2 Concord De La Salle, 65-117. 
</P>
<P>
The Roadrunners' defeat of Arroyo Grande (sixth, 204), the fourth-ranked team 
in the state, assured their place in the state rankings. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives the kids a feeling that they belong where they're ranked," Coach Mel 
Silva said. "Coming in to today, we knew we had a shot at (Arroyo Grande) 
because a couple of our kids were sick at the Stanford (Invitational)."

Riverside College sent a less-than-subtle message to the rest of the Mission 
Conference Central Division teams Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside, the only non-Orange County team in the division, defeated Rancho 
Santiago, the best the county has to offer, 34-24, in front of about 6,000 at 
Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside (6-0 overall and 5-0 in conference play) handled Rancho Santiago 
despite four turnovers, three fumbles and an interception. It was the first 
loss for Rancho Santiago (5-1, 4-1), which was ranked second the Southland 
Poll. Riverside was ranked third. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers led, 20-7, at the half, but turned the ball over three consecutive 
times in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Rancho Santiago managed only 10 points from the gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside fumbled the second-half kickoff and Rancho Santiago scored eight 
plays later on one-yard run by Ziad Khozam to cut the lead to 20-14. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Feldman kicked a 27-yard field goal for Rancho Santiago to cut the lead 
to 20-17 with 4:24 left in the third quarter. The Dons had a first down at the 
Riverside two on that series, but after an offsides penalty, running back 
Estrus Crayton lost a yard. After a third-down incomplete pass, Feldman was 
forced to kick the field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago got the ball right back on a fumble recovery by Ralph 
Henderson. But Rancho Santiago's drive stalled, and the Dons turned the ball 
over on downs at the Riverside 33. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have gotten at least 14 points, and probably 17," Rancho Santiago 
Coach Dave Ogas said. "We just didn't execute on offense like we have all 
season." 
</P>
<P>
Riverside took a 27-17 lead on a three-yard pass from Randy Payne to Daryl 
McChristian with 11:37 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Crayton returned the ensuing kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown to cut the lead 
to 27-24 eight seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
McChristian came back with a one-yard run for a touchdown with 8:41 left to 
give Riverside a 34-24 lead. 
</P>
<P>
McChristian led all rushers with 194 yards in 23 carries. He had eight runs of 
10 or more yards, including a 45-yarder. Riverside rushed for 234 yards and 
passed for 172 more. 
</P>
<P>
The Riverside defense held Rancho Santiago to a season-low 24 points and 308 
yards. "Blame it on good defense," Ogas said. "We just weren't settled down and 
made too many mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago quarterback Scott Wood was 17 of 34 for 162 yards but missed on 
eight of his final 10 attempts and also was intercepted twice. 
</P>
<P>
"They have the best offense we've faced all season," Riverside Coach Barry 
Meier said. "We just wanted to keep it simple and make sure we were in the 
right places at the right times and took it from there." 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago opened with a 76-yard touchdown run on the second play of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time a team has scored on Riverside in the first quarter this 
season. Riverside tied it on a 32-yard pass from Payne to Joe Dantuono with 
11:56 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Riveside took the lead, 14-7, when Steve Stokes recovered a Maund fumble in the 
end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Darren Goodman added field goals of 41 and 32 yards in the second quarter as 
Riverside took a 20-7 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
In another Mission Conference football game: 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast 27, Saddleback 14 -- Greg Angelovic completed 15 of 30 passes for 
281 yards and two touchdowns -- including a school-record 92-yard completion to 
Melvin Johnson -- to lead visiting Orange Coast. 
</P>
<P>
OCC improved to 5-1 overall, 4-1 in the Mission Conference and 1-0 in the 
Central Division. For OCC, Jason McGehee had 91 yards in 23 carries and a 
touchdown, Mark Craig had seven catches for 113 yards and Shane Talbert had 
five catches for 97 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
For Saddleback (1-5, 1-4, 0-1), John Burns had 109 yards in 24 carries and Jeff 
Bailey completed 17 of 32 passes for 267 yards with two touchdowns and three 
interceptions.

THE FRESHMAN-LADEN CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ HILLS TOROS ARE LOOKING TO THE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dan Guerrero, the athletic director at Cal State Dominguez Hills, was strolling 
through the Toro gymnasium recently when a loose basketball rolled past his 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
What Guerrero saw after that amazed him. Two freshman basketball players 
hustled after the ambling orb on its path through a door and into the athletic 
training room, all the while jostling for position, each intent on getting 
control of the ball first. 
</P>
<P>
Athletes trying to impress coaches in early season basketball practices is 
nothing new, but Guerrero, who wants Dominguez Hills to become a perennial 
national Division II power by the early 1990s, was excited to see the extent to 
which the newcomers carried their enthusiasm for Coach Dave Yanai conducting 
practice nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"Dave had a great recruiting class and I look for him to have another good one 
next year," said Guerrero. 
</P>
<P>
True, Yanai had a very good recruiting season, thanks in part of a cash influx 
on the part of Guerrero's administration. Some of the money helped Yanai make 
increased scholarship offers. Three newcomers on this year's team were selected 
to The Times' All-South Bay high school team and one of those was an All-City 
Section selection. 
</P>
<P>
But, as with many new things, this team will take time to develop. In the 
meantime, maybe a year or two, its performances are expected to be uneven at 
best. Yet, there are people like Guerrero who believe that a few more key 
additions next year will help the Toros mature into a very good basketball team 
in the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
With nine new players and only one bona fide starter returning, Yanai admitted 
that this year may be "an adventure." Hustle, then, is a quality Yanai is 
looking for this season in his freshman-laden club, which follows a group that 
went 20-10 and advanced to the Western Regionals. Yanai brings a 186-137 record 
into the season. 
</P>
<P>
Without 6-foot-7 center Anthony Blackmon, now playing in Japan, the Toros 
figure to be a much different-looking team, shorter and perhaps quicker. How 
quickly they can adapt to the loss of a big man in the middle who produced 20 
points and 10 rebounds a game will determine their fate. 
</P>
<P>
"We have so many young players. They've got to buckle up and get better," Yanai 
said. "We'll be slower starting in terms of winning in the early going. Our 
concern is progress and getting ready for the conference." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Yanai bristles at the thought of a "rebuilding year." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't ever like to use that term. This is not a rebuilding year. Every year 
we prepare our players to compete for the championship." 
</P>
<P>
A rugged preseason schedule that includes games with sectional powers Cal State 
Hayward, Sonoma State, Washburn U., West Texas State, North Central Illinois, 
Grand Canyon College, Quincy College and a pair of games with Biola University 
all but guarantees a not so hot won-loss record going into California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. play in January. In fact, this may be the toughest 
preseason slate Dominguez Hills has had, all part of Guerrero's wishes to 
upgrade the Toro schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"This schedule is very, very tough for this club," Yanai said. "It's tough for 
any club in any given year." 
</P>
<P>
Yanai said the Toros will run a bit more than last year, because, without 
Blackmon, the CCAA's Athlete of the Year, a half-court offense might not be as 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
Look for junior guard Robert Barksdale from Hawthorne to spur the fast-breaking 
Toros from the point. Last year he averaged 13.4 points and 3.5 assists per 
game. From the free throw line he made 84% of his attempts. He also made 40% of 
his three-point tries. A streaky shooter, he seldom misses when he is on a 
roll. 
</P>
<P>
"Robert has to give us a great deal of leadership," Yanai said. "From a scoring 
standpoint, the loss of Blackmon will hurt, but Robert is very capable." 
</P>
<P>
Six-foot-2 sophomore Mike Bell (2.6 points per game), a strong defensive player 
in a substitute role last year, figures to get the initial start at the 
off-guard spot, but look for freshman Raymond Bennett, who averaged 16.5 points 
a game at Carson High School, to see plenty of playing time. Senior swing Kevin 
Shaw will probably see more time off the bench at the guard spot, although 
newcomers John Brown (Montebello), Anthony Gonzales (Garfield), Shelton Hill 
(Bishop Montgomery) and Eddie Wilson (Manual Arts) have a shot. 
</P>
<P>
The front line is "in limbo," according to Yanai. Freshmen Vincent Washington 
from Carson, the Pacific League's Most Valuable Player last spring, will play a 
role. He averaged 17 points a game. Shaw, who grabbed 11 rebounds in the 
consolation game of the Western Regional, could move up front if he has too, 
but more likely look for newcomers Joseph Janney from Ghana and walk-on Norman 
Francis from Fairfax, on-again, off-again starters Segaro Bozart (6.4 points 
per game) and Brian Johnson (3.9) and red-shirt junior Michael Rudberg (1.9) to 
battle for front-line jobs. Curtis Wright, a 6-foot-8 freshman from Modesto, 
hopes to walk on. In the wings is Damon Estelle, also of Carson, who did not 
qualify academically according to NCAA rules (Proposition 48), will be eligible 
to play in December if he finishes 12 units in the fall semester. In 1988 at 
Carson he averaged 12.3 points and 8.9 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
"We're basically starting with two guards and everything else is up for grabs," 
Yanai said. "This is a nice group of kids, a hard-working bunch." 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Clark, last year's point guard, is finishing his quest for a college 
degree, now that his playing days are over. He will assist Yanai this season, 
as will Bart Yamachika. Those are familiar faces for Yanai, who hopes desire 
and hustle from a new group of players will counter inexperience. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want for competition," he said with a smile. "They don't know what 
they are doing yet, but they are trying very, very hard."

TUNNEY'S FIGHTING CHANCE; 
</P>
<P>
BOXING: JERRY QUARRY RETURNS TO THE SPORT TO ASSIST THE KIN OF A LEGENDARY 
HEAVYWEIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Normally, a guy making his professional boxing debut is not exactly riding herd 
over a powerful management group. 
</P>
<P>
The fighter's manager tends to be a guy looking only to make a fast buck. And 
the trainers at that level are nearly always guys with U-turn noses and 
bad-looking ears who were, dozens of years ago, well on their way to world 
championships until it was discovered that when another fighter punched them on 
the chin, they would fall and remain prone for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
But they loved the game, so they stayed in it. Which is another way of saying 
that, in some cases, they couldn't do anything else. And now they spend their 
days showing young kids how to get pounded on the chin. 
</P>
<P>
So just why in the name of broken ribs is Jim Tunney heading into his very 
first professional fight, a middleweight bout Tuesday night at the Country Club 
in Reseda, with someone as famous as former heavyweight standout Jerry Quarry 
in his corner? 
</P>
<P>
Well, it was a case of love at first left hook. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone introduced me to this kid three months ago," Quarry said. "I asked him 
to step outside with me and I watched his stance and I watched him throw a few 
punches. What a hook this kid has. And I decided right then that this would be 
the kid who would bring me back into boxing." 
</P>
<P>
Until Quarry met Tunney, he had not been around boxing gyms for six years. 
After a two-fight return to boxing in 1983, the man who duked it out during the 
1970s with some of the very best heavyweights in history -- including Muhammad 
Ali and Joe Frazier -- decided that he didn't want any part of what he felt 
were the unscrupulous promoters who rule the sport today. 
</P>
<P>
But in the 24-year-old Tunney, Quarry found something that he missed. 
</P>
<P>
"My son wanted to be a fighter years ago and I got him started," Quarry said. 
"But he burned out on it pretty quickly, which is exactly what I wanted him to 
do. Boxing is just too tough. 
</P>
<P>
"But when I met Jim, he reminded me so much of my own son. The same size, the 
same movements. And this kid wanted so much to be a fighter that I just 
couldn't resist." 
</P>
<P>
What Quarry has is a 160-pound slugger who came to him as a pure street fighter 
with only 12 amateur fights. What he has become under Quarry's guidance will be 
unveiled Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Quarry promises big things. 
</P>
<P>
"This kid hits like a mule," said Quarry, who was on both ends of many 
mule-force blows during his career. "I spar with him, and he is one heavy 
puncher. I know a heavy puncher when I feel one, and this guy is one." 
</P>
<P>
One of the first things Quarry has tried to teach Tunney is the value of body 
punching. Quarry scored dozens of knockouts during his career behind a crushing 
right hand to an opponent's midsection. And he makes no apologies about the 
fact that he enjoyed that aspect of fighting. 
</P>
<P>
"That was my game," Quarry said. "There was no greater feeling than reaching in 
and grabbing a man's liver." 
</P>
<P>
Into such a sophisticated sport stepped Tunney, who graduated from Newbury Park 
High in 1983 and lives in Thousand Oaks. And just how did a kid from a land of 
manicured lawns and the "Hey, dude" mentality come to love boxing? 
</P>
<P>
Well, has the name Tunney jingled any bells yet? 
</P>
<P>
Gene Tunney, the legendary heavyweight champion of the 1920s and the man who 
whipped Jack Dempsey twice, the second time in the famed "Long Count" fight of 
1927, was the uncle of Jim Tunney's father. Gene Tunney's real name also was 
Jim. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up knowing about my granduncle," Tunney said. "My dad talked about him 
a lot, about what he had done. And I have watched all the old films of him 
fighting, including the two great fights with Dempsey. That's what got me 
interested in boxing." 
</P>
<P>
Tunney asked his mother for a punching bag on his 15th birthday, and he said 
that he spent an hour or so every day for the next year hammering away at it. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean every day," he said. "I had a calendar near the bag and I marked off 
each day. I didn't miss a single day of beating on that bag, covering my hands 
with old socks. I just couldn't stop." 
</P>
<P>
Tunney fought his first amateur bout at the age of 16 1/2 and remembered 
something about that now-worn punching bag: It never slammed him in the chops. 
</P>
<P>
But his first opponent did. 
</P>
<P>
"As I recall, the fight was nothing like what I thought it would be," Tunney 
said. "I won a decision, but I got hit a lot too, and my overall impression the 
next day was, 'Do you really want to do this?' I found out that it is a really 
brutal sport. But I decided to keep at it. And I started to like it." 
</P>
<P>
And the more he liked it, the less his opponents did. 
</P>
<P>
Quarry says that after working with Tunney for just a few months, he has a 
hunch that Fred Thomas of Los Angeles, who has had just three professional 
fights, is going to have a tough time during their bout Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim is ready for a big career," Quarry said. "He has all the skills and all 
the power that he needs." 
</P>
<P>
Tunney's debut is scheduled for five rounds. 
</P>
<P>
In the main event, former national amateur heavyweight champion Alex Garcia of 
San Fernando (12-1 with nine knockouts) will meet Eddie Gonzalez of Houston 
(25-7-1 with 14 knockouts) in a scheduled 10-round fight. 
</P>
<P>
In other scheduled fights, unbeaten featherweight Gabriel Ruelas of Pacoima 
will take on Freddie Santos of Tijuana. Ruelas is 16-0 with nine knockouts. 
Santos is 23-10 with 16 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Rafael Ruelas, 10-0 with eight knockouts, will fight Margarito Ruiz, 9-4, 
of Tijuana, in a junior featherweight bout. 
</P>
<P>
In a heavyweight bout scheduled for four rounds featuring a pair of brawlers, 
Rocky Pepeli of Van Nuys, 5-2 with five knockouts, will meet J.R. Frye of 
Phoenix (2-0, with two knockouts). 
</P>
<P>
The card begins at 7:30 p.m.

NORTHRIDGE OPENS UP OFFENSE IN SOCCER WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has taken awhile, but the Cal State Northridge soccer team appears to have 
finally adjusted to Coach Marwan Ass'ad's new faster-paced, attacking offense. 
</P>
<P>
After struggling offensively for much of the season, the Matadors shifted into 
high gear Saturday and defeated Cal Poly Pomona, 3-1, in a California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. match before 773 at North Campus Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
After a scoreless first half, Northridge scored three goals during an 18-minute 
span to improve its record to 8-3-3 overall, 5-1-1 in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Reyes scored the Matadors' first goal at the 60:37 mark on assists from 
Scott Piri and German Laverde, then assisted on two Jim Hofferber scores to 
lead Northridge, the 12th-ranked team in NCAA Division II. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been frustrating, but we feel like we're finally starting to click 
offensively," Hofferber said. "It's taken us awhile to adjust to the new 
offense, but we're playing well now." 
</P>
<P>
Reyes, who has scored a goal in three of the past four matches, took Piri's 
lead pass, dribbled for 10 yards, then blasted a shot past Pomona goalie 
Timothy Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Hofferber scored his goals during a 1 minute, 35 second span, twice getting 
behind the Bronco defense where Reyes fed him with passes. 
</P>
<P>
"They had been giving us that play all night, but we hadn't been taking 
advantage of it," said Hofferber, who has a team-high seven goals and 18 
points. "Their defense was playing us straight across, so it was there." 
</P>
<P>
On his first goal, at 76:26, Hofferber took Reyes' pass, fought off defender 
Darrin Sennott, then fired a left-footed shot that forced its way through 
Miller's legs from 25 yards. And on the second, at 78:01, he fought off Brian 
Wendel and lobbed a soft shot past an onrushing Miller. 
</P>
<P>
C. J. Hester scored Pomona's (3-11-1, 1-5) goal with 10 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
The victory extended Northridge's home unbeaten streak in CCAA play to 31 
matches. The Matadors' last conference defeat was a 2-1 loss to Pomona on Oct. 
12, 1983. They are 27-0-4 since then. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel like we've got to win every game left to win conference," Hofferber 
said. "It would be rare to lose two games in (conference) and win it." 
</P>
<P>
The CCAA champion is granted an automatic berth in the Division II playoffs.

BANNING COACH THINKS HIS WINNING TEAM HAS LOST ITS DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the coach of a winning team berates his own athletes, one should always 
use caution interpreting the message. 
</P>
<P>
Is the tirade an honest opinion, or merely an attempt to fire up the troops 
after a lackluster performance? 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it is hard to tell, but Banning High School football Coach Joe 
Dominguez seemed genuinely disgusted Friday after the Pilots' 14-0 win over 
visiting Washington. 
</P>
<P>
And for good reason. Banning looked awful. 
</P>
<P>
Facing a less-than-imposing opponent (Washington is 1-4 and was hammered by 
Carson, 52-0, two weeks ago), the unbeaten Pilots (5-0-1) struggled. They were 
outgained in total yards, 232-205, and sustained only one scoring drive. 
</P>
<P>
Could this be the No. 2-ranked team in the state? 
</P>
<P>
"I laugh at that," Dominguez said, referring to Banning's lofty rating by 
Cal-Hi Sports. "If we're No. 2 in the state, it must be a down year for (high 
school) football in California. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the worst undefeated team in the state. Instead of being ranked No. 1 or 
2 in the polls, we should be ranked 99 or 100." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't always like this. Banning opened the season impressively with a 21-9 
win over Long Beach Poly, ranked No. 2 in the Southern Section Division I poll, 
and followed that with a 7-7 tie against Muir, which was rated No. 1 in the 
Division II poll at the time. 
</P>
<P>
But since then, Dominguez said, the Pilots have played poorly in wins over a 
string of second-rate L. A. City Section opponents -- Locke, Narbonne, San 
Pedro and Washington -- all of whom sport losing records. 
</P>
<P>
Before Friday's game Dominguez believed injuries were to blame for his team's 
poor play. For example, middle linebacker John Herrera, Banning's best 
defensive player, has been sidelined with a knee injury. But after watching his 
team stumble against Washington, Dominguez now believes the problem is a lack 
of desire. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 65 guys on this team who don't want to play football," he said. "It's 
a tremendous disappointment. I thought we were a good football team, but we're 
not. We haven't had a good practice this year, and we're six games into the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our team reflects society in general. We seem to be content with 
mediocrity." 
</P>
<P>
Banning led only 7-0 at halftime, the result of a Washington fumble recovered 
by the Pilots in the end zone. Dominguez was so disgusted with his team that he 
stayed in the locker room only long enough to deliver a sarcastic speech. 
</P>
<P>
"I lied to them," he said. "I told them they were doing a great job: 'You're 
beating one of the poorer teams in the City (Section), 7-0.' " 
</P>
<P>
Banning did come out in the second half and march 63 yards to score on a 
28-yard pass from quarterback John Ma'ae to wide receiver Sheldon Butler. But 
for the remainder of the game the Pilots seemed content to sit on the lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been so embarrassed," Dominguez said. "I've only been a head coach 
for 1 1/2 years, but this was my most embarrassing moment. And that includes 
the City championship game. We were just totally inept. We stunk." 
</P>
<P>
(Carson defeated Banning, 55-7, in last year's City Section 4A title game.) 
</P>
<P>
Asked about his team's meeting with Carson in three weeks, Dominguez said: "I 
think they might have to put three digits on the scoreboard for Carson. Maybe 
I'll ask (Carson Coach) Gene Vollnogle if we can play their B team." 
</P>
<P>
At least Dominguez has managed to keep his sense of humor. His sense of pride 
is in considerable trouble. 
</P>
<P>
One football coach with few complaints these days is Serra's Leo Hand. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, Hand watched the Cavaliers dismantle visiting St. Anthony, 56-2, 
in a Camino Real League game that reinforced Serra's position as one of the 
favorites for the Southern Section Division VII title. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a powerful outfit," St. Anthony Coach Ralph Godfrey said. "I think 
they ought to be (ranked) No. 1 in our division." 
</P>
<P>
Serra (7-0 overall, 2-0 in league play) is ranked second in Division VII behind 
Lompoc, but it would be difficult to find a team in the entire section that has 
been more dominating than the Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
Serra has outscored its opponents, 276-39, an average score of 39-5 per game. 
And the Cavaliers have done it in basic football style -- running the ball down 
their opponents' throats. They entered this week with 1,749 yards rushing and 
only 220 passing. It was more of the same against St. Anthony, as Serra rushed 
for 336 yards and attempted only two passes, both incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers' full-house backfield of fullback Dennis Gerard, halfbacks Jerald 
Henry and Lamont Daniel and quarterback Fred Safford combined for all but three 
of the team's rushing yards. They also accounted for every point the team 
scored: seven touchdowns and five two-point conversions. 
</P>
<P>
Gerard, a powerful 5-foot-7, 185-pound senior, led the way with 145 yards on 
eight carries. He had three touchdowns covering 65, 33 and 10 yards. Henry, a 
junior, rushed for 101 yards and one TD on seven carries and Daniel finished 
with 79 yards and one TD on nine carries. The trio gained 325 yards on 24 
carries, an average of 13.5 yards per carry. 
</P>
<P>
Hand complained that his team committed too many penalties, but admitted that 
under the circumstances it was impossible to be upset. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, we're very pleased," he said. "We have talented backs and a good 
offensive line, and they've all worked very hard together."

LADY TOROS 'POUND' CHAPMAN COLLEGE, 8-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Dominguez Hills soccer Coach Marine Cano was fuming when his 
second-rated Division II women's team played poorly in a 4-1 home field loss 
last Tuesday against Division I powerhouse UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"This really hurts us. We've got to go out and pound some goals Saturday. I 
mean, pound some goals," Cano said. 
</P>
<P>
And pound some goals they did, racking up a single game school record in 
shutting out Chapman College, 8-0, in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's game: 
</P>
<P>
Pat Fitzgerald made good on a penalty kick in the 84th minute of play as 
Dominguez Hills defeated Chapman, 3-2, in a California Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. game. The Toros (8-6-1 overall, 2-3-1) also got goals from Willie Ayala 
and Mark Merino.

MOORPARK TROUNCES HARBOR, 44-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL OLSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everything that Moorpark College did worked well for them. Conversely, nothing 
Harbor College attempted to execute on the football field seemed to work. 
</P>
<P>
The proof was in the final score. With Moorpark holding back the offense, the 
host Raiders rolled to a 44-0 Western State Conference, Northern Division 
victory over Harbor on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Said Harbor Coach Don Weems: "I don't have anything to say. Moorpark is a good 
team, just take a look at the scoreboard." 
</P>
<P>
The game statistics show the frustration of Harbor (2-4, 1-4 in conference 
play). The Seahawks had 39 rushes for a net gain of only 56 yards, and this 
season's leading rusher, running back Bill Harris, managed only one net yard in 
12 carries against a torrid Moorpark defense. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark (5-1, 4-1 in conference play), however, rushed 42 times for 278 yards, 
with running back Freddie Bradley gaining 126 yards in only eight carries, 
including an 83-yard touchdown run in the second quarter and backfield mate 
Marc Monestime adding another 100 yards in 19 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark quarterback Jayson Merrill completed 11 of 20 passes for 165 yards and 
two touchdowns, while seeing action in only the first half of play. Merrill 
tossed scoring strikes of 49 and 11 yards to wide receiver Peter Marine in the 
second quarter to give the Raiders a 30-0 halftime lead.

Loyola 49, St. Francis 0 -- Loyola overwhelmed St. Francis on both sides of the 
ball and rolled to the top of the Del Rey League standings with a lopsided win 
at Glendale High. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Kahlil McAlpin scored four touchdowns in 11 carries and finished with 
101 rushing yards.

<P>
McAlpin got the first two Loyola touchdowns on runs of four and 10 yards, added 
a six-yard scoring jaunt in the second quarter, then finished his night with a 
40-yard scoring run 1:37 into the third quarter. 
</P>

Loyola's defense held St. Francis to 25 yards in total offense as quarterback

ANTELOPE VALLEY FAILS TO OVERCOME EARLY MISTAKES IN 31-20 LOSS

<P>
Antelope Valley College's excursion Saturday night onto the synthetic turf at 
East Los Angeles College was hardly what one would call a magic carpet ride. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley turned the ball over three times in the first quarter, fell 
behind, 21-0, and spent the remainder of the game playing catch-up in a 31-20 
Foothill Conference loss. 
</P>
<P>
East Los Angeles (3-3, 3-1 in conference play), the Foothill's top offensive 
team, piled up 408 yards against the conference's second-best defensive unit. 
But the Huskies turned the ball over six times, allowing Antelope Valley 
(3-3-1, 2-2-1) to stay close in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
ELAC's Adan Avina, the conference's leading rusher, gained 201 yards in 36 
carries and scored on runs of 10 and two yards. Avina also scored from 28 yards 
on a screen pass in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies' defense, ranked sixth in the conference, held Antelope Valley to 
two yards rushing and 146 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley quarterback Cole Speer threw a nine-yard touchdown pass to Abe 
Ivory late in the second quarter, and the Marauders trailed, 24-6, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley closed to within 24-12 when Ivory scored on a one-yard run 
after Birk Sopsher's interception of a Larry Razo pass in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
But Avina's two-yard touchdown run on the ensuing possession gave the Marauders 
a 19-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Razo threw another interception, at the Huskies' two, and Ivory scored his 
third touchdown on a two-yard run late in the third quarter. JIM COLEMAN

Pierce 30, West L.A. 15 -- The Brahmas, who had allowed an average of 37 points 
and a WSC-high 470.4 yards per game, turned in their best defensive effort of 
the season, snapping a four-game losing streak in a game at West Los Angeles 
College. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce (2-4, 1-4), which had not allowed fewer than 28 points in a game, 
limited the Oilers to 283 yards while using its second defensive unit for much 
of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Brahmas' offense also snapped out of its slump. Pierce, held to 17 points 
in its past two games combined, equaled that amount in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jamie Grossman led the Brahmas to scores on their first two 
possessions, hitting Shannon Culver with a 27-yard touchdown pass 4:03 into the 
game and Chad Zeigler with a 14-yard pass 5:26 later. Andrew Munoz's 23-yard 
field goal 1:49 before halftime gave Pierce a 17-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
West Los Angeles scored four minutes into the third quarter. Wymon Henson 
caught a pass from Ruanada Manuel that had been deflected to him at the Pierce 
40-yard line and sprinted untouched into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
The game's final 15 points came in a 15-second span. Manuel tossed a 10-yard 
touchdown pass to Jeff Epps with 3:33 left, then Culver returned the ensuing 
kickoff 91 yards for a score. 
</P>
<P>
Holder Mike Knieriem bobbled the snap on the conversion attempt, and his pass 
was intercepted by Demetrius Jennett. The 5-foot-10, 230-pound freshman nose 
guard ran 95 yards for two West Los Angeles points, under a rule instituted 
last season. STEVEN HERBERT

<TEXT>
<P>
With a last, longing look at a picture of her dead son, Beverly Godinez fled 
the earthquake-ravaged low-rent hotel she called home and joined the ranks of 
the Bay Area's homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Her home had made it through Tuesday's initial quake, but 23 hours later, a 
terse voice burst over the hotel intercom and ordered its residents out. She 
grabbed a few clothes and a few dollars and rushed outside with her husband, 
Ferman Malbrough. 
</P>
<P>
"I stared at that room and just felt lousy," Malbrough said. "We left 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
Theirs are swelling ranks these days. At last count, more than 6,500 Bay Area 
residents were displaced by the earth's fury, and the number is sure to grow as 
more homes are inspected and declared uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
The great quake was a leveler in more ways than one. It wrenched aside the 
elegant mansions of San Francisco's Marina District and their less extravagant 
yuppie counterparts; it cast apart the middle-class homes of people who, even 
before the quake, were without much financial cushion. It wrenched the poor of 
Oakland from their threadbare refuges; it made the already homeless even more 
so, ruining the cheap rooms that governments occasionally gave them to spend 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
The rich and the poor, business people and laborers, city dwellers and urban 
homesteaders alike find themselves cast into a refugee's life of uncertainty. 
They nest in Red Cross shelters, in the living rooms of friends, in campers 
parked in front of their teetering homes. Few, if any, have any firm notion 
just yet of where they will go, or what life has yet to toss them. 
</P>
<P>
A building inspector declared Oakland's low-income Hotel Hamilton unsafe and 
ordered out the 165 guests, a quarter of whom were long-term residents of the 
hotel into which Jacqueline Tolman and a group of investors had poured $750,000 
in the last four years. Tolman had just begun to turn a profit a few months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
And she has more than an emotional sense of kinship with the hotel's displaced 
dozens -- Tolman's own apartment, across the bay in the fractured Marina 
District, was destroyed. She is without a home and without a source of 
employment. She borrowed against a credit card to meet this week's payroll. 
</P>
<P>
"Monday, I was worth $400,000," she said Saturday, smoking nervously and clad 
in a borrowed sweat shirt. "Today, I'm homeless and broke and I'm minus on my 
Visa card." 
</P>
<P>
She laughed and cracked a joke. "What's that old saying? What man hath wrought 
God shall put asunder?" 
</P>
<P>
If things are uncertain and roiling today, history suggests that the quake's 
homeless face even more heartbreak. Their brethren in the luckless fraternity 
of earthquake victims, the survivors of Coalinga and Whittier, predict for them 
months of dismaying journeys through myriad bureaucracies of federal and state 
aid, inspections and reconstruction -- if they can even afford it. 
</P>
<P>
"They've gone through the heroic phase," said Bob Semple, the assistant city 
manager in Coalinga when a devastating earthquake struck there in May, 1983. 
"Then there's a disillusionment phase. . . . Then they'll get into the 
rebuilding phase pretty soon -- and that will last a lot longer." 
</P>
<P>
In Coalinga, trailers sent by the federal government for temporary housing were 
occupied, in some cases, up to 18 months. The city's public services director 
said that only last year -- five years after the quake -- did Coalinga truly 
get back on its feet. 
</P>
<P>
In Whittier, where the earth rebelled two years ago, some residents are still 
waiting for federal rebuilding loans -- and others are just a little closer to 
normalcy after battling insurance companies, governments and construction 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's damage is far from isolated: San Francisco reported $2 billion in 
property losses, including the destruction of 60 homes and apartment buildings 
in the Marina District. In Oakland, Mayor Lionel Wilson said 1,400 homes were 
damaged or destroyed and estimated the loss at $29.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Cruz County, building inspectors said 63 residences were destroyed and 
138 were damaged in unincorporated territory alone. Watsonville estimated $1 
million in damage was done to 100 homes, many of which were destroyed. Of the 
450 homes in the hamlet of Loma Prieta in the Santa Cruz Mountains, near the 
quake's epicenter, 120 were destroyed or severely damaged. Only 141 escaped 
with minimal structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
The number of people who might ultimately have to rebuild or adopt major 
repairs is not yet firm, although it is certain to remain in the thousands. For 
now, the Red Cross has opened 31 shelters across north-central California and 
has housed more than 5,000 people nightly. The rest are finding other forms of 
shelter. But in Whittier, the number of homeless peaked on the ninth day after 
the quake -- a notch on the calendar not yet marked by those suffering in the 
Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
"What you're going to see is the refugee population slowly increase by virtue 
of building inspections being done and condemnations," said Robert Bolin, a New 
Mexico State University sociologist who is one of the leading researchers on 
disaster recovery. 
</P>
<P>
The future is almost too daunting for the shellshocked survivors to consider. 
For now, they live day to day, coping with varying degrees of success. 
</P>
<P>
Like any disaster, it has united those whose lives might have passed parallel, 
never interceding. There was Joe DiMaggio, Joltin' Joe, standing about 200th in 
line at a shelter in the Marina District on Friday to find out the fate of his 
house. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just like anybody else," said the legendary New York Yankees center 
fielder, looking sadly regal in pressed pants and a sports coat. "I'm just 
waiting in line." 
</P>
<P>
That is the clarion call of all of the victims, but it is even more poignant 
for those who were slip-sliding toward financial disaster even before Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Alejandra Martinez, a 26-year-old Watsonville farm worker, was already homeless 
when the earthquake struck. She and her husband were laid off from their jobs 
recently, as the harvest season came to a close. Unable to afford their 
apartment, they found refuge with their two small children in St. Patrick's 
Catholic Church. Until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The century-old brick church, with its tall spires one of the city's best-known 
landmarks, was hard hit. Cracked and near collapse, the church will be 
demolished. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez and her family are homeless again -- and they are not alone. Among the 
2,000 residents left homeless in Watsonville were Martinez's two brothers and 
their families. The three families have a total of 14 children, ranging in age 
from 1 month to 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we would take refuge with my brothers, but now we're all homeless," 
she said in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
While they camp outdoors on a Watsonville High School field, Martinez and her 
husband are reeling. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no work, no money and no homes," she said. "Who can we turn to? Who 
will listen to us? The adults can take it, but what about the children?" 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred of the homeless remained camped in city parks and on the high 
school playing field Saturday despite a drenching rain that doubled to 1,200 
the number of people seeking cots in the Red Cross shelter. The National Guard 
brought in tents that house 600 people. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the compassion that has marked this expansive disaster was much in evidence 
in Watsonville. Maria Valdivia returned to her damaged home Saturday -- 
bringing with her 10 people she had invited from the outdoor camp. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a sin to return to my comfortable home while they are suffering on 
the street," she said. 
</P>
<P>
To the north, in the Santa Cruz Mountains, where the showers threaten to 
undermine already shaky hillsides, tent cities began to spring up. In seaside 
Santa Cruz, city officials Friday asked a visiting President Bush to send 
federally owned mobile homes -- among other things -- to shield the homeless 
from the elements. On Saturday, the mayor announced that a donor from the East 
had offered to send 5,000 trailers. 
</P>
<P>
Across from the boardwalk, the Casa Del Rey retirement home was evacuated after 
the temblor. Many of the 150 residents, who range up to age 97, spent the night 
on mattresses laid out in the parking lot. By week's end, half had moved in 
with friends or family and the rest into shelters and a nearby motel. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the motel, Fran Morse, 83, pondered the future. Where would she live? 
"That's the $64,000 question," she quipped. 
</P>
<P>
To the north in San Francisco, the disparate elements of a city that typically 
celebrates its diversity have found shared homelessness a somewhat shaky 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after Tuesday's earthquake, the Red Cross opened Moscone Convention 
Center, located in a gritty section of the city, as a shelter for thousands of 
commuters stranded far from their East Bay homes. At least that was the theory. 
</P>
<P>
When word circulated that the center was offering warm food and blankets, 
Moscone was flooded with about 1,000 people, some forced out of damaged 
low-rent hotels and some the chronically homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The move hit relief workers who were unprepared to handle people with chronic 
medical and psychiatric needs. Many who flocked to the center were forced to 
quit -- cold turkey -- their alcohol and drug habits, and some were 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are detoxing because they can't do their drugs," said Susan 
Bennett, a Red Cross coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of some troubled residents added to the literal jitters already 
felt by the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Terri Watson, her husband and their 11-month-old daughter came to the Moscone 
shelter after learning that their apartment building was roped off by police. 
The apartment was close to the Marina District shelter, but Watson was too 
nervous about aftershocks to take cover there. When she got to Moscone, she was 
stunned by the homeless men stretched out in the reception area. 
</P>
<P>
"I was bawling out loud," said Watson, 29, "and said to my husband, 'You can't 
leave me here.' " 
</P>
<P>
But the center, which has a separate room set aside for women and children, has 
earned her reluctant praise. 
</P>
<P>
"They supplied me with diapers, baby food, even stuffed animals," Watson said. 
"But I don't have a watch. Hardly anyone does around here. I'm losing track of 
time." 
</P>
<P>
The Watsons are trying to move their belongings to her sister's home in Oregon. 
For them, San Francisco has lost its charm. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to chance going through another earthquake," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Paz and his wife Charlene are facing a more uncertain future. The 
couple and their three young children were moving to a new apartment when the 
quake hit. They have few financial reserves -- both are unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what we're going to do. I have no idea," said Richard Paz, 
absently pushing a baby stroller. "It's scary with the kids." 
</P>
<P>
But the children have been shielded from at least some of the horror. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday morning, the Moscone children awakened to find a magic castle in the 
banquet room, built from tables and butcher paper. They crawled inside and 
staged spontaneous puppet shows. Later that day, about 15 members of the San 
Francisco Giants baseball team stopped by, dropping off toys and food and 
drawing eye-shining applause. 
</P>
<P>
The same homeless people who terrified Terri Watson are at the center of a 
major dilemma in San Francisco. Bob Prentice, the coordinator of homeless 
programs for San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos, said Friday that as many as 1,000 
hotel rooms the city used to shelter the homeless had been lost. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect the numbers will keep inching up," Prentice said. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands more who lived in low-cost apartments could also find themselves on 
the streets if structural engineers condemn their buildings, he said. "A lot of 
people living on the margins have lost their place to stay," said Prentice. 
</P>
<P>
In Oakland, where spirits soared temporarily Saturday with the rescue of a man 
trapped for four days in the Nimitz Freeway rubble, things were no better for 
the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Half a block from the collapsed viaduct, Marjorie and John Anderson continued 
to stand guard over the bungalow where they lived for 45 years, the home where 
they raised three children. In 15 seconds of terror Tuesday, the white 
clapboard house built in 1867 slipped four feet off its foundation and slid 
into its own basement. The floors buckled upward, jamming shut all the doors. 
Front and back porches cracked off the house, and tidy balusters were strewn 
about the front yard. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors rescued Marjorie Anderson, her son and a granddaughter by kicking in 
the front door. And now, when they should be enjoying their retirement, the 
Andersons are sleeping in a donated camper and contemplating razing the house. 
The other day, utility workers came and tore away the electrical wires. One of 
the workers apologized. 
</P>
<P>
An affable man with salt-and-pepper hair, John Anderson has to scoot under the 
wreckage a few times a day to retrieve his trembling, eight-month-old German 
shepherd puppy, Sparky. Anderson hopes to rebuild. At least he has insurance, 
and no one died -- that makes him lucky, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're gonna tear it down, haul it off and build another one," he said, as a 
chill breeze snapped nastily. "What else can you do? If the wind don't blow 
this sucker down tonight." 
</P>
<P>
His wife spends much of her time sitting in the camper outside her home -- "her 
whole life," as her daughter called it. "When things like this happen, 
sometimes they don't dawn on you for a few days," Anderson said. "It's just 
starting to dawn on my wife that she could have gotten crushed inside." 
</P>
<P>
Their fellow Oakland refugees, Beverly Godinez and Ferman Malbrough, spend 
their days at a shelter at Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School, two of 
nearly 190 people packed into the school auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
The days are filled with the din of humanity, a haze of conversations overlaid 
by fear and frustration and uncertainty. Only after the lights go off at 11 
p.m. does the roar subside. 
</P>
<P>
Even then, there are reminders of the horror. The other night, a woman woke up 
screaming from a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
"You get that hopeless feeling sitting here," Malbrough said, resting on a cot. 
"It's hard not knowing what's going to happen. 
</P>

COLOMBIA DRUG LORDS FIND FUGITIVE LIFE ERODES POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
BOGOTA, Colombia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pablo Escobar and Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha have joined the notorious ranks of 
Billy the Kid and Al Capone. After years on the rampage, the two Colombian drug 
lords seem bigger than life and as bad as bandits come. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes magazine estimates the pair's wealth in the billions of dollars. In 
addition to buying the compliance of countless Colombian officials, they are 
known to finance paramilitary platoons in rural areas and squads of hired 
killers in the cities. They have been accused of ordering hundreds of killings, 
including those of government ministers, presidential candidates, police 
officials, judges and journalists. 
</P>
<P>
Escobar, 39, and Rodriguez Gacha, 42, have come close to cowing a nation of 30 
million people with bullets and bribes. The ruthless methods that made them 
infamous have even added a new word to Colombia's lexicon of violence: 
narcoterrorismo. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two months, however, the dreaded cartel barons have lost much of 
the fearsome power that their guns and money gave them. Beleaguered by 
government security forces, the two have suspended most of their drug 
operations in Colombia to concentrate on avoiding capture, Colombian and 
American officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Their trafficking organization, known as the Medellin cartel, has been hit hard 
by an onslaught of government raids and the arrests of key associates. Escobar 
and Rodriguez Gacha are said to move from hide-out to hide-out, staying just a 
jump ahead of investigators and security forces. 
</P>
<P>
"Reportedly, they came very close to being captured several times and managed 
to escape," a senior American official said the other day. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to intimidate the society and undermine the government's declared 
goal of seizing them for extradition to the United States, the narcoterrorists 
are pressing a campaign of dynamite bombings. At least 150 bombs, most of them 
blamed on Escobar and Rodriguez Gacha, have exploded during the last two 
months, killing a total of 10 people. 
</P>
<P>
In the deadliest blast so far, more than 100 pounds of dynamite set off in a 
parked car Monday killed four employees of the pro-government Vanguardia 
Liberal newspaper in Bucaramanga, 190 miles north of Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
The official anti-drug blitz has concentrated on Escobar, Rodriguez Gacha and 
their associates rather than other trafficking groups. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a war against Escobar and (Rodriguez) Gacha, obviously," said Juan 
Carlos Pastrana, editor of the Bogota newspaper La Prensa. "I haven't seen any 
war against the others." 
</P>
<P>
Security forces have raided scores of ranches, urban apartments, offices and 
other properties. Authorities have seized hundreds of airplanes and 
automobiles, and large stockpiles of weapons and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Not since 1984, when the Medellin cartel was accused of assassinating 
Colombia's justice minister, has the pressure to capture Escobar and Rodriguez 
Gacha been so strong. That year, the two took temporary refuge in neighboring 
Panama, but now they are known to be hiding in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
The government has issued "wanted" posters bearing photos of the two men and 
offering a $250,000 reward for information leading to their arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have announced the arrests of nearly a dozen key members of 
Escobar's and Rodriguez Gacha's organizations, including Jose Rafael Abello, 
identified by police as the No. 4 man in the Medellin cartel. Four other 
accused Colombian traffickers have been sent to the United States for trial 
since President Virgilio Barco Vargas, using his powers under a longstanding 
state of siege, issued a decree Aug. 18 permitting extradition 
</P>
<P>
Still, the most important Colombian traffickers remain at large. They include 
Jorge Luis Ochoa, another leader in the Medellin-based network, and Gilberto 
Rodriguez Orejuela and Jose Santacruz Londono, reputedly the top leaders of a 
rival cartel based in the city of Cali. 
</P>
<P>
The most-wanted bandits of all are Escobar and Rodriguez Gacha; no other 
traffickers have come close to combining cunning, greed and open violence with 
such frightening force as those two. 
</P>
<P>
"Their power arises from the fact that they have the biggest enterprises, the 
richest and the most brutal," said the senior U.S. official, who asked not to 
be further identified. 
</P>
<P>
"They are very mobile," the official added. "These guys have been on the lam 
now for some time. Their operations, their life style, have been geared to 
keeping moving." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the official blitz, Colombian traffickers have "closed down large 
portions of their cocaine production," the American official said. "They are 
transiting very little cocaine out of Colombia." As a result, Escobar and 
Rodriguez Gacha can keep a lower profile. 
</P>
<P>
"When they close down, then it becomes much more difficult to find them because 
they are not doing their usual things." he said. "They are not out taking care 
of their trafficking empire." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, the confiscation of many ranches and offices, 
communications equipment and other property belonging to the two has limited 
their resources and hiding places, said a high Colombian police official. 
</P>
<P>
"They are feeling seriously wounded," he said. The official, who asked to 
remain anonymous for security reasons, confirmed that Escobar and Rodriguez 
Gacha have evaded capture in more than one close call recently. 
</P>
<P>
"Those operations generally fail because there are so many people who are their 
friends," he said. But he added that the two are starting to lose the 
collaboration of Colombians who once aided them out of fear or friendship, 
especially in rural areas where they hide. 
</P>
<P>
"They are now more alone," the official said. "They are disoriented and scared. 
They see that the authorities are really after them, and they see that money no 
longer works." 
</P>
<P>
He speculated that Escobar and Rodriguez Gacha must be getting nervous, more 
prone to make mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"We know more or less in what area they are hiding," he said. "We are looking 
for the right moment and the right opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, cocaine traffic out of Colombia has been reduced to "small 
shipments" by lesser-known traffickers. He also said that Escobar, Rodriguez 
Gacha and other drug lords are stashing their cocaine stocks, which are 
appreciating in value as the reduced flow pushes up prices in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"They might be producing, but very little, maybe 20%," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Both this official and the American disagreed with speculation from U.S. law 
enforcement officers that large cargoes of cocaine recently seized, such as the 
19.8 tons discovered Sept. 29 in a Sylmar warehouse, had been shipped since the 
Colombian crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
An officer in another police agency said the continuing government campaign is 
digging up a growing body of information, which is being collected and 
constantly analyzed in computers. Greater knowledge about the operations of 
Escobar and Rodriguez Gacha is putting them in an increasingly vulnerable 
position and giving authorities a moral boost, according to the official. 
</P>
<P>
"The intelligence is producing more and more results every day," he said. "We 
are stronger today, much more capable. The personnel is much more eager." 
</P>
<P>
The Medellin cartel is not a true cartel in the business sense, but rather a 
loose association of drug makers, distributors, transportation specialists and 
others. Although Escobar is regarded as the richest and most powerful of them 
all, there is no structure with formal hierarchy and chains of command. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts say the trafficking organizations are more of a Mafia than a 
cartel. In fact, Escobar is sometimes called "El Padrino," Spanish for "the 
Godfather." 
</P>
<P>
Short and pudgy, with curly black hair and hazel eyes, he went to high school 
in a blue-collar district of Medellin, now a city of 2 million people. His 
first known business venture was stealing gravestones so that they could be 
resurfaced and resold. 
</P>
<P>
Later he became a car thief and a bodyguard for an electronics smuggler. He 
made a quick $100,000 in the early 1970s by kidnaping and ransoming a Medellin 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, police arrested him for possession of 39 pounds of cocaine. Typically, 
Escobar never went to trial. A year after the bust, gunmen killed the two 
arresting officers. 
</P>
<P>
By then, Escobar's cocaine-smuggling gang was known on the streets of Medellin 
as Los Pablos. Business boomed in the late 1970s, and by the early 1980s, the 
newly rich kingpin was investing heavily in real estate, including an 
$8-million apartment complex in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
His $60-million Colombian ranch, called Napoles, boasted a spacious zoo with 
African animals and a bullet-riddled sedan that was said to have belonged to 
John Dillinger or Al Capone. 
</P>
<P>
Escobar won election as an alternate member of the Colombian Congress in 1982, 
filling in on the floor when the full member was absent. In Medellin, he sought 
respectability with his own radio show, newspaper and a civic program called 
"Medellin Without Slums." In his most famous act of philanthropy, he financed 
Barrio Pablo Escobar, a hillside housing development for former slum dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
But those who are familiar with Escobar's business methods were undeceived by 
the Mr. Nice Guy image. 
</P>
<P>
"More than anybody in the Medellin cartel, Escobar was known as an enforcer," 
wrote Miami Herald reporter Guy Gugliotta in "Kings of Cocaine," an 
authoritative 1989 book on the cartel. "He never forgot an insult; he held 
grudges; he took revenge." 
</P>
<P>
Among killings Escobar has been charged with or accused of are the 
assassinations of Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla in April, 1984; 
Superior Court Judge Tulio Castro Gil in July, 1985; former anti-narcotics 
police Col. Jaime Ramirez in November, 1986; Editor-in-Chief Guillermo Cano of 
the Bogota newspaper El Espectador in December, 1986, and Atty. Gen. Carlos 
Mauro Hoyos in January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Escobar's partner, Rodriguez Gacha, is equally ruthless and vindictive. He has 
been charged in some of the same killings and in others, including the 
assassination of former leftist presidential candidate Jaime Pardo Leal in 
October, 1987. Both Escobar and Rodriguez Gacha are implicated in the slaying 
of presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan on Aug. 18, the act that prompted 
President Barco to launch his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
And both have been charged with issuing orders to kill dozens of rural workers 
in massacres by "paramilitary" commandos. Escobar and Rodriguez Gacha, who own 
numerous ranches, are believed to have financed dozens of armed groups that 
originally were formed to protect ranchers against guerrillas but became tools 
for narcoterrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez Gacha also has marshaled groups of gunmen this year in a violent 
campaign to take over rich emerald mines in a mountainous area north of Bogota. 
The so-called "Emerald War" began in February when gunmen killed emerald tycoon 
Gilberto Molina, who was once known as Rodriguez Gacha's friend and mentor, 
along with 16 other persons at a party in Molina's home. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez Gacha's hometown is Pacho, on the southern edge of the emerald 
fields. He grew up poor, and like many Colombian campesinos, his formal 
education did not go beyond grade school. 
</P>
<P>
His friendly country manners and his fabulous financial success made him a 
popular celebrity for miles around. In the town of La Dorada, west of Pacho, 
Rodriguez Gacha celebrated his birthday in May, 1986, with a three-day party 
that has became famous throughout Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
Escobar, Ochoa and other drug lords attended the public bash, highlighted by a 
horse parade through the town, according to press reports. Even though 
Rodriguez Gacha had more than 100 bodyguards on hand for the occasion, a local 
police commander provided officers for security. 
</P>
<P>
Known as "El Mexicano" because of his fascination with Mexico, Rodriguez Gacha 
owns a string of ranches in the Pacho area with Mexican names such as 
Cuernavaca, Chihuahua, Sonora and Mazatlan. 
</P>
<P>
"He ran the Pacho area," an intelligence official told The Times in September. 
In a later interview, the same official said security forces were about to 
close in on Rodriguez Gacha more than two months ago at a discotheque he owns 
in Pacho, but residents tipped him off in time to escape. 
</P>
<P>
"He had the sympathy of the majority of the town," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
His friends also apparently included military officers. A 1988 investigation of 
the kingpin's telephone bills in Pacho revealed calls to several military 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Escobar and Rodriguez Gacha, apparently weary of their life on 
the run, have issued repeated messages calling for a "dialogue" with 
authorities to negotiate a peace settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what I propose," Escobar was quoted as saying in an interview 
published in late August by the French newspaper Liberation. "We will give the 
government all of the confiscated properties and also the airplanes. Our only 
desire is to integrate into society, legal society, but it is the government 
that doesn't want it." 
</P>
<P>
Liberation said he added: "If total war must be waged, we will do it until the 
end." 
</P>
<P>
Also in late August, Rodriguez Gacha told a Colombian television journalist by 
telephone that the traffickers would give up their drug business in exchange 
for amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
"We are fighting, trying to be heard so that they will dialogue with us," 
Rodriguez Gacha said. Authorities barred Colombian media from airing the taped 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
In late September, both Escobar and Rodriguez Gacha renewed their proposals for 
a dialogue in telephone calls to Norberto Morales, chairman of the Colombian 
House of Representatives. Morales said that they both offered to "put an end to 
the war and bring several million dollars into the country." 
</P>
<P>
Barco vows that he will not relent in his "crusade" against traffickers, but 
Colombian political scientist Rodrigo Losada says the narcoterrorists are also 
unlikely to relent. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going down a blind alley, in a sense," Losada said. "I don't believe we 
have the means to guarantee that we will free ourselves of this problem. It is 
a very terrible situation." 
</P>
<P>
Losada said he fears that Escobar and Rodriguez Gacha will escalate their 
terror campaign, targeting important political figures for more of what the 
press here describes as "magnicides." 
</P>
<P>
"If the narcoterrorism stays at the current level, the country can tolerate 
that for a long time," said Losada, a researcher with the Bogota think tank 
named Instituto SER. "But if the narcotraficantes are able to strike very 
strong blows, such as killing a former president, the government might give 
in."

CRANSTON PIONEERS TAX AID TECHNIQUE FOR CONTRIBUTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is the inescapable spiral of modern political campaigns: Costs mount, rules 
grow tighter on fund raising and spending, politicians develop ever more 
ingenious ways to skirt restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
And, when it comes to ingenious fund-raising devices, Democratic Sen. Alan 
Cranston of California is in the vanguard. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston, who is seeking reelection to a fourth Senate term in 1992, has 
pioneered the development of a new system for raising money to strengthen his 
own voter base, help his party do likewise and make the whole thing tax 
deductible to boot. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last four years, Cranston has established six organizations that 
raised a whopping $7 million to register citizens to vote. Although ostensibly 
nonpartisan, the groups have concentrated overwhelmingly on registering 
potential Democrats -- especially potential Cranston supporters. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing novel about voter registration drives as such. The League of 
Women Voters has This article was reported by Dan Morain in San Francisco, 
Kenneth Reich in Los Angeles, James S. Granelli in Orange County and Paul 
Houston in Washington. It was written by Houston. 
</P>
<P>
been running them for years. So have civil rights groups, the major political 
parties and others. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the Cranston-backed organizations stand out is that, apparently 
alone among such groups that have been supported by political officeholders, 
five of the six have gained tax-exempt status by pledging to act on a 
nonpartisan basis. 
</P>
<P>
That status makes it easier to raise money because the contributions are tax 
deductible; in effect, part of the donations are underwritten by the 
government. In addition, the severe legal limits on contributions to political 
candidates do not apply to the nonpartisan voter registration groups. 
</P>
<P>
But interviews, public records and even some of the working documents of the 
voter registration organizations associated with Cranston show that they have 
taken special pains to register voters who would be likely to vote Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in a 1986 letter soliciting funds for one of the tax-exempt groups, 
Cranston cited "keeping my Senate seat in the Democratic column" as the first 
of four issues of "great national significance" at stake in the 1986 elections. 
</P>
<P>
The groups do not refuse to register individuals as Republicans if that is 
their desire -- state law and Internal Revenue Service regulations would 
prohibit such refusals -- but, in searching for unregistered voters, they 
target areas and segments of the population most likely to yield high 
proportions of new Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders "got upset if too many Republicans" were registered, recalled Terrie 
Monaghan, a former business manager at the Center for Participation in 
Democracy, a tax-exempt California-based group affiliated with Cranston that 
registered at least 233,000 voters in the state last year. 
</P>
<P>
Center for Participation in Democracy leaders expected that Democrats would 
make up about three-quarters of the names that each worker collected, said 
Monaghan, herself a Democrat. Carl Pope, a board member of the center, said 
that about 70% of the voters it registered were Democrats, with the rest 
divided among Republicans, independents and those who refused to state their 
affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS has raised no objections to Cranston's voter registration efforts. 
Without discussing Cranston's groups directly, IRS spokesman Larry Wright said: 
"There's nothing in the law that says you can't target certain areas, even if 
you know they are preponderantly of one party or another. But if, while you are 
there, someone wants to register in another party, then you are obligated to 
accept that registration." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Getting Out the Vote 
</P>
<P>
The California Fair Political Practices Commission is considering ways to 
regulate voter registration drives without frustrating "the laudable purpose of 
getting out the vote," John Larson, executive director of the agency, said. He 
said the commission's decision to look into the matter was prompted by the 
activities of a variety of groups, not just those linked to Cranston. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the tax-exemption issue, the voter registration groups enable 
Cranston to raise funds unfettered by limits on giving to particular 
candidates. Donors to the voter registration groups, unlike contributors to 
political campaigns, are not restricted by the $2,000 federal limit on campaign 
contributions by individuals and the $10,000 ceiling on contributions by the 
political action committees of special interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, unlike most political contributors, the identities of donors to the 
tax-exempt voter registration groups do not have to be disclosed, although 
three of the Cranston-backed groups allowed their donations to be listed in 
California public records. 
</P>
<P>
Among the donations shown in these records was a total of $850,000 from Charles 
H. Keating Jr., the former head of bankrupt Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has since tried to distance himself from Keating, Cranston and 
three other senators met with Edwin J. Gray, then chairman of the Federal Home 
Loan Bank Board, in 1987 about the bank board's lengthy investigation of 
Lincoln and about a proposed regulation of S&amp;L investments that Keating 
opposed, Gray has said. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln has since been seized by federal regulators, and Keating has been 
subpoenaed to testify before the House Banking Committee on Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston recently acknowledged that he did "a pretty stupid thing politically" 
in creating at least the appearance of a conflict of interest in his 
relationship with Keating. 
</P>
<P>
Common Cause, the citizens' lobbying group, recently called for investigations 
by the Justice Department and the Senate Ethics Committee of the help provided 
to Keating by Cranston and Sens. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), John Glenn 
(D-Ohio), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.). 
</P>
<P>
Common Cause President Fred Wertheimer said in an interview that Cranston's use 
of tax-exempt voter registration groups opened up new opportunities for abusing 
fund-raising limitations. 
</P>
<P>
"We see another avenue where large contributions can be made at the request of, 
and to the benefit of, public officials, with the possibility that the money 
can be used to buy access and influence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston, responding to the Common Cause action, said he had merely tried to 
accelerate federal regulators' decisions on what to do about Lincoln S&amp;L. 
"I did not violate any ethics rules or standards," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Records in Sacramento show that other major donations to the Cranston-backed 
voter registration groups include $100,000 each from Hollywood producer 
Frederick (Ted) Field, the E&amp;J Gallo Winery, the Teamsters Union and the 
Assn. of Trial Lawyers of America. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Sheet Metal Workers International Assn. gave $125,000, Drexel Burnham 
Lambert Inc. gave $35,000, a company owned by Beverly Hills developer Albert H. 
Gersten contributed $25,000 and $20,000 came from a foundation set up by Walt 
Disney Co. President Frank G. Wells. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Helping Hand 
</P>
<P>
In addition to assisting Keating, Cranston intervened with federal regulators 
on behalf of Drexel Burnham. He asked the Securities and Exchange Commission in 
a letter to drop its effort to force Drexel Burnham to move its junk bond 
department from Beverly Hills to New York; the SEC ultimately abandoned that 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
Before Cranston interceded on Drexel Burnham's behalf, he solicited $35,000 for 
two of his voter groups from Michael Milken, the then-head of the investment 
house's junk bond department, who has since been indicted on insider-trading 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston and his aides said that the senator extended no favors in return for 
contributions. And interviews with several federal officials found no 
indication that Cranston had interceded on behalf of any of his contributors 
other than Keating and Drexel Burnham. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, some of the major donors said they hoped for less tangible 
benefits as a result of their contributions. Several said they expected 
improved access to Cranston and perhaps extra help on legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt we'd do something good for the country as well as something helpful 
for us," said Alan Parker of the trial lawyers' association. "He's always been 
friendly to us." Parker helped Cranston with voter registration drives in the 
late 1950s when Cranston was president of the California Democratic Council and 
Parker was treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston described his interest in voter participation as a "major driving 
force in my life," one with deep roots. He said he recently found an old 
newspaper clipping in which his father, William Cranston, called in 1909 for 
changing voter registration laws. 
</P>
<P>
The senator said he created the six voter registration groups to offset the 
efforts of Vote America, a tax-exempt organization that, he argued, was 
designed to sign up mostly Republicans. However, Vote America was prominently 
endorsed last year by the then-chairman of the Democratic Party, Paul G. Kirk 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston and his aides said the organizations set up under Cranston's 
sponsorship were nonpartisan in the critical sense that, although they targeted 
areas likely to produce mostly new Democratic voters, they accepted Republican 
registrants also. 
</P>
<P>
The Center for Participation in Democracy's board of directors met late last 
month in Los Angeles and, after questioning Kim Cranston, the senator's son, 
and other organizers for the center, found "no evidence" that the effort was 
unduly skewed toward potentially Democratic voters, board member Pope said. 
</P>
<P>
However, there are allegations that efforts were made to discourage Republican 
registrants. A paid worker of the Center for Participation in Democracy, a 
Democrat, said that it was common for new voters in low-income areas to be 
given registration forms with the word "Democrat" already entered on the line 
for party affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Cranston, who helped organize and run the center, said that, if its 
supervisors and workers engaged in such practices, they did so on their own. 
There was no direction from the top, he said, to slant the registration drive 
toward Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
The first tax-exempt group that Cranston helped start was the California Center 
for Voter Education and Participation in 1985. Later, it was renamed the 
Western Center for Voter Education to satisfy an IRS requirement that such 
tax-exempt groups must be active in more than one state, said board member 
James C. Gross, who said the center "interacted with a group in Colorado or the 
Midwest." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter soliciting donations for the California Center, Cranston cited 
"keeping my Senate seat in the Democratic column" as the first of four issues 
of "great national significance" at stake in the 1986 elections. The others 
were protecting the state's 27-member House Democratic delegation, preserving 
the Democratic majorities in the state Legislature and reclaiming the 
governorship of California for his party. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Greenaway, Cranston's top Senate aide, said it was legal to make a partisan 
fund-raising appeal as long as the actual registration of voters was 
nonpartisan. 
</P>
<P>
"You can target areas," he said, "but you can't influence registrants. You 
can't fill in a party affiliation for them." 
</P>
<P>
The group wound up raising $327,500, including $100,000 from Field, $80,000 
from labor unions, $25,000 from Drexel Burnham and $10,000 from a foundation 
set up by Maurice H. Stans, a Pasadena business consultant and, as a 
Republican, a former Richard M. Nixon fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Where Money Went 
</P>
<P>
At least one board member of the group was a Republican, and the Sacramento law 
firm that incorporated the group long has served as counsel to the GOP in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
When the California Center, renamed the Western Center, folded in 1987, after 
Cranston's reelection, it donated its remaining cash -- $32,000 -- to a new 
tax-exempt Cranston group, the Center for Participation in Democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston aggressively sought contributors. Donations went not only to the 
Center for Participation in Democracy directly but also to three other groups 
based in Washington. Those groups, in turn, distributed large sums to the 
center, as well as to about 40 voter registration organizations in 20 states. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington groups were the Forum Institute and the Citizens Participation 
Project -- both tax-exempt -- and USA Votes, a taxable organization. All three 
were formed by Rob Stein, a political consultant and philanthropist who 
contributes heavily to Democratic causes. 
</P>
<P>
The Center for Participation in Democracy and USA Votes reimbursed Cranston for 
25 fund-raising trips he made on their behalf to Atlanta, New York, Chicago, 
San Antonio, Minneapolis, Phoenix, Seattle, Denver and Jackson, Miss., in 1987 
and 1988, records show. On a trip to Phoenix, he picked up a $400,000 check 
from Keating. 
</P>
<P>
But another group, the Organizing Institute of Pacific Grove, Calif., received 
nearly $800,000 from the Forum Institute and trained registrars for its biggest 
client, the Center for Participation in Democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's son, Kim, a longtime worker in liberal political movements who is 
now a top aide to California Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, helped 
organize and run both the center and the Organizing Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Both the center and the Organizing Institute were helped by a political 
fund-raising firm that assisted Cranston's reelection campaign in 1986 and is 
now aiding his 1992 campaign. The groups each paid Lucille A. McCoy more than 
$32,000 to consult on fund raising. She served as a fund-raiser for Cranston's 
1986 reelection campaign and now is working out of the senator's Los Angeles 
headquarters on his 1992 campaign. The campaign committee paid her firm, McCoy 
Associates, more than $25,000 in the first six months of this year, records at 
the Federal Election Commission show. 
</P>
<P>
A Center for Participation in Democracy training manual contained guidelines 
for registrars working in the field, mostly in low-income areas. It instructed 
registrars to tell people who were declaring party affiliation on a 
registration form: "Please mark your political party right here, like 
Democrat." If the person hesitated, the manual added, "explain (that) if you 
are for Nixon and Reagan, that's the Republicans. If you are for Kennedy or 
Jesse Jackson, that's the Democrats." 
</P>
<P>
The center sought to raise $3 million and register a million new voters in 
California and four other Western states, Kim Cranston said in an interview. It 
targeted minorities, the poor and low-income young people in an effort to 
"empower" the disenfranchised. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the group raised about half the hoped-for money and 
registered between 233,000 and 365,000 new voters in California (county and 
state estimates differed), the younger Cranston said. No party breakdown was 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Some workers charged that the effort was a highly partisan attempt to help 
Democrats in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't being honest. They weren't saying who they were," said a worker 
at the center, who requested anonymity. She said directors of the group never 
explicitly stated that registrars were to home in on Democrats, "but it was 
certainly implied. It was an unwritten truth." 
</P>
<P>
Another worker, who also requested anonymity, said that he had worked in every 
election since 1972 but had never found a campaign as distasteful as the one 
run by the Center for Participation in Democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"It was supposed to be nonpartisan, but they told me they wanted Democrats," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Who Was Targeted? 
</P>
<P>
Some workers were told they would get jobs with the Democratic presidential 
nominee after the registration drive concluded in October, a third worker said. 
</P>
<P>
Several contributors to Cranston-backed groups assumed that the registration 
efforts would be partisan. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Scott, a spokeswoman for the Sheet Metal Workers International Assn., 
said that the union gave $75,000 to two groups last year because "the senator 
is always in the forefront of getting more people interested in voting for the 
Democratic Party. It is very hard to catch up with the Republicans as far as 
money spent on grass-roots campaigning." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Kim Cranston said that any implication that the center or the 
Organizing Institute were actually campaign organizations is false. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that a few disgruntled employees can cast a shadow on what 
the center accomplished," he said, noting that some critics were fired and that 
others had persisted in disagreeing with the targeting of low-income areas. "I 
attended three training programs and told them what nonpartisan meant. With 
over 400 employees, a few people aren't going to pay attention." 
</P>
<P>
"We never refused to register anybody," said Lance King, who ran the San 
Francisco office of the center. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz Reynoso, a former California Supreme Court justice who is chairman of the 
Center for Participation in Democracy, said that the group "targeted areas 
where we could find young people and minorities." In general, he said, blacks 
tend to register as Democrats, Latinos less so and young people "about even." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Activities Applauded 
</P>
<P>
Several voter-participation activists applauded the senator's activities, 
contending that his fund raising helped several nonpartisan registration groups 
outside California and that a bill of his to allow registration by mail would 
probably have a neutral political impact. 
</P>
<P>
"We need more people like Cranston who are dedicated to strengthening the 
democratic process," said Sandy Newman, head of Project Vote, a tax-exempt 
group that registers voters in 15 states outside California. 
</P>
<P>
Tax-exempt groups offer contributors the advantage of writing off their 
donations on income tax returns. To a wealthy contributor, the federal tax 
deduction is worth as much as 33 cents for every dollar donated, and state 
income taxes increase the value. 
</P>
<P>
"The money is easier to raise because it is tax-deductible," observed Herbert 
E. Alexander, a campaign finance expert at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Donations to the groups offer another opportunity, too: access to a powerful 
figure in Washington. Cranston acknowledges this. "Obviously, people who make 
huge contributions do have some advantage over those who don't," he said. "It 
gives them access."

MARGARET THATCHER AND JACQUES DELORS ARE ALMOST PERFECTLY INCOMPATIBLE. THEIR 
STORMY POLITICAL RELATIONSHIP MAY SHAPE THE CONTINENT'S FUTURE.

<P>
He is the most powerful nonelected figure in Western Europe. She is the prime 
minister who has dominated the region's politics as no other figure of her 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
They clash openly and often and agree on little. 
</P>
<P>
They are Western Europe's odd couple. 
</P>
<P>
In ideas, philosophy and personality, Jacques Delors, president of the European 
Community's Executive Commission, and Britain's Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher are almost totally incompatible. In the genteel club of Europe's 
democratic leaders, they engage in a rare, highly visible struggle of personal 
wills. 
</P>
<P>
But there is more than personal pyrotechnics to this battle. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher and Delors personify a broader struggle over the central question of 
what Europe should become as the 12 member nations of the European Community 
push toward greater unity. 
</P>
<P>
Should the 12 be merely a glorified free-trade zone of like-minded states a la 
Thatcher, or, in Delors' vision, a fully integrated union -- the continent's 
economic and political epicenter, bound as much by a common social ethos as by 
commercial necessity? 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with The Times, Delors sketched his vision of the 
European Community's potential. He proposes regular summits between American 
and European Community presidents, envisions extensive community support to 
help East Bloc countries nurture democracy and suggests the community as the 
framework for a rapprochement between the two Germanys. 
</P>

That such talk is taken seriously is largely due to Delors' success in a job 
many now see as the closest thing Western Europe has to a president. 
</P>
<P>
From the day that the former French finance minister settled into his top-floor 
office at the European Community's Brussels headquarters nearly five years ago, 
Western Europe has never been quite the same. 
</P>
<P>
Delors took a demoralized community, paralyzed by budget disputes and 
ballooning farm subsidies, and gave it such momentum that Thatcher and her 
followers today fret that its growing power could overwhelm that of the member 
states. 
</P>
<P>
Delors' blueprint is radical, calling on member states to dismantle age-old 
frontiers and build the world's single largest consumer market. 
</P>
<P>
He set a deadline of Dec. 31, 1992, for achieving this internal market, then, 
like some pinstripe-suited pitchman, sold his dream to a Western Europe eager 
to escape the years of "Euro-pessimism" and "Euro-sclerosis." 
</P>
<P>
His message was simple: unify or decline. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, all 12 heads of government had agreed to the historic process. 
</P>
<P>
Even Thatcher, isolated and apparently off-guard at the speed of it all, was 
swept along. 
</P>
<P>
Delors' plan, incorporated in what became the Single European Act, pledged the 
leaders not just to the single internal market by 1992, but to the larger idea 
of eventual full economic, monetary, and political union. 
</P>
<P>
But as Delors presses, encourages and cajoles the European countries toward 
greater unity, Thatcher mounts a series of delaying actions. 
</P>
<P>
"She sees herself as some kind of resistance fighter in the mountains that's 
simply not going to let Big Brother take over from Brussels," said Britain's 
opposition Labor Party leader, Neil Kinnock. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, Thatcher and Delors, who are both 64, personify their respective 
traditions. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher stems from a Protestant, individualist tradition. She imbibed English 
pragmatism, is first and foremost a British patriot, an ardent Atlanticist and 
instinctively skeptical of the rhetoric of grand ideas -- especially those 
emanating from across the English Channel. 
</P>
<P>
As a teen-ager from a northern English town, she felt only the distant 
rumblings of World War II, which so decimated the continent and led the 
European Community's founding fathers to see their creation first and foremost 
as a means to ensure that war never again comes to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Delors, a teen-ager in Nazi-occupied France, personifies a 
continental, postwar wariness of nationalism, a need to seek consensus and the 
ability to nurture a dream. 
</P>
<P>
"She is Anglican; I am Catholic. So, we believe in the same God, but in this 
life, we don't have the same views," Delors said of the British prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
When asked why she has problems getting along with Delors, Thatcher seemed 
surprised by the question. 
</P>
<P>
"But he's a socialist," she exclaimed. "and from the extreme wing of 
socialists." 
</P>
<P>
Although Thatcher supports community efforts to remove commercial barriers, she 
is the most outspoken advocate of an important body of opinion that believes 
European unity should stop there. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, her vision of a fully unified European Community is bleak. 
</P>
<P>
She warns of a Europe ruled by gray Brussels technocrats intent on crushing 
national sovereignties and cultures into some European Pablum. 
</P>
<P>
Talk of political, monetary and economic union, Thatcher proclaims, is "airy 
fairy and absurd." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Delors buoyantly predicted the beginnings of an "embryonic" European 
government in Brussels and said that within 10 years 80% of all economic and 
perhaps tax and social legislation would be handled at community rather than 
national levels. Thatcher bristled. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was wrong and went over the top," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in a speech in October, 1988, in Bruges, Belgium, she elaborated: 
</P>
<P>
"We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain 
only to see them reimposed at a European level, with a European superstate 
exercising a new dominance from Brussels." 
</P>
<P>
Exactly one year later, at the same Bruges platform, Delors answered Thatcher 
with a plea to quicken the unifying process. 
</P>
<P>
"History is accelerating," he said. "We must also accelerate." 
</P>
<P>
Their clashes proliferate. 
</P>
<P>
As Delors pushes to abolish border controls, Thatcher insists they are 
essential to fight terrorism, drugs and illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
A so-called social charter of workers' rights assuring decent wages and working 
conditions -- a charter seen by Delors as an important statement of common 
European values -- is dismissed by Thatcher as Marxist. 
</P>
<P>
While Delors talks of monetary union, Thatcher scoffs at the idea of a single 
currency and one European central bank. 
</P>
<P>
"I neither want nor expect ever to see such a bank in my lifetime, nor, if I'm 
twanging a harp, for quite a long time afterwards," she declared. 
</P>
<P>
Even on minor issues, she fights. 
</P>
<P>
When European Community health ministers tried to regulate the size of health 
warnings on cigarette packages, Thatcher was enraged that the organization 
should even consider such trivia. 
</P>
<P>
"They will soon be telling you how many minutes you should have for a (TV) 
program," she huffed. "Goodness gracious me." 
</P>
<P>
Despite such carping, advocates of greater European unity admit, Thatcher has 
made positive contributions. For example, she has led a fight for greater 
fiscal discipline in the community and frequently focuses on practicalities 
rather than the grand plans outlined by other leaders. 
</P>
<P>
But increasingly, she swims against the tide. 
</P>
<P>
Even in Britain, where anti-Brussels rhetoric was once a sure vote-getter, 
Thatcher's stridently nationalist views sound off-key with a more pro-community 
mood. 
</P>
<P>
Often outnumbered 11 to 1 in community votes, Thatcher has been forced into a 
series of tactical retreats. 
</P>
<P>
Her most recent step back came last June when she agreed to join the 11 others 
in the first tentative steps toward monetary union. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing of her insistence that she had only committed herself to the 
initial step, Delors couldn't resist. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand a political striptease contains a number of stages . . . ," he 
commented wryly. 
</P>
<P>
Soft-spoken, intense, precise and serious in personal discussions, Delors is a 
highly respected financial wizard, credited with turning around a struggling 
French economy in the early 1980s before tackling the European Community as 
none of his predecessors had. 
</P>
<P>
"He now stands as the most creative, effective leader that the European 
Community has ever had," said Dick Leonard, a former British member of 
Parliament and a respected observer of community affairs in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Thatcher is an extrovert who breezily dismisses tough problems as 
simple and is quick to lecture those who disagree. 
</P>
<P>
Still, despite their differences, the two leaders have some remarkable 
similarities. 
</P>
<P>
Each springs from modest beginnings. Delors, the son of a minor bank official, 
was reared in a working-class Paris suburb. Thatcher, a grocer's daughter, 
lived over the family shop. 
</P>
<P>
They remain largely untouched by the trappings of power. 
</P>
<P>
Delors walks to work from a modest apartment in central Brussels and will dine 
with his chauffeur on the road, while Thatcher has been known to cook supper 
for flagging aides toiling into the night. 
</P>
<P>
They are both high-achieving political loners, devoid of the cronies that 
surround many leaders. 
</P>
<P>
They are also distanced from their respective national and party elites. 
Thatcher is a woman in a man's world; her undistinguished roots run counter to 
her Conservative Party's blueblood tradition. Delors is a Roman Catholic 
socialist, educated at night school rather than the exclusive Ecole Nationale 
d'Administration. He didn't join the French Socialist Party until he was in his 
40s. 
</P>
<P>
Both keep punishing schedules. 
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, community officials joke that Delors comes to work with the Danes 
at 8 in the morning and leaves with the Spaniards at 10 at night. Thatcher 
works a similar schedule and fails to distinguish between leisure and laziness. 
</P>
<P>
Neither suffers fools. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher's scorn for a minister uncertain of his ground is legendary, while 
Delors harangues his commissioners, frequently with a sense of exasperation. 
</P>
<P>
On one legendary occasion in late 1987, as the community's momentum seemed to 
be slipping, an exasperated Delors tore into his colleagues, reportedly at one 
point telling Greek commissioner Grigoris Varsis that he was incapable of 
running a bar. 
</P>
<P>
It was an incident uncharacteristic in its intensity, according to one former 
commissioner, for which Delors later apologized. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a quick temper. He's outspoken and sometimes gets excited faster than 
he needs to," said one diplomat who knows him well. "Combine those three 
things, and you get a person who can be explosive." 
</P>
<P>
But Delors' genius is his ability to combine his vision of European unity with 
a negotiator's skill to blend 12 diverse views into realistic, workable 
compromises. 
</P>
<P>
His efforts to get the central bankers from all 12 member countries to agree to 
a three-step plan for European monetary union is seen both as a tribute to his 
personal prestige in the field of finance and to his negotiating skills. 
</P>
<P>
Although Thatcher and Delors each exhibit a degree of grudging respect for the 
other's sense of purpose, their personal relationship is marked by a strained 
politeness. 
</P>
<P>
It is said to have nose-dived after Thatcher forgot -- or decided not -- to 
introduce Delors at a 1986 post-community summit news conference that she 
hosted in London. 
</P>
<P>
When Delors later refused to answer a reporter's question, Thatcher's 
light-hearted quip that he must be the strong, silent type merely exacerbated 
the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Their next major clash is expected to come at the community summit in 
Strasbourg, France, in December, when the 12 leaders are scheduled to debate 
the social charter of basic workers' rights so important to Delors. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, Thatcher remains skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a social charter," she sniffed. "It's a socialist charter."

EARTHQUAKE JUST ADDS TO ANGER IN 'DOG TOWN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cathy Johnson, 35, was ready to fight back. 
</P>
<P>
When an Oakland police officer set a cup of coffee on the hood of her 1987 Geo 
Spectrum, Johnson, sitting on the steps of her rented house a block from the 
collapsed Nimitz Freeway, leaped to her feet in anger. 
</P>
<P>
"Get it off my car!" she screamed at the officer. "Get it off." 
</P>
<P>
Only when the officer removed the cup did she sit back down. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want to treat us like animals, we can do the same thing to them," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is one of hundreds of residents of a poor run-down minority 
neighborhood that borders the shattered freeway. Police derisively refer to the 
neighborhood as "Dog Town." 
</P>
<P>
Since the collapse that left more than 30 people dead, anger and frustration 
have been running high among those living around the block-long media 
encampment beside the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and others say they have been harassed by police trying to keep 
spectators away from the disaster site. It was the same treatment they had 
received before the earthquake, she said, made harder to tolerate now that 
water and electrical power are out in some homes and the community has been 
invaded by news people, gawkers and others. 
</P>
<P>
Her car ended up inside an area cordoned off by police and, now that it's 
considered "off limits," Johnson will have to get a special permit to remove 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Officers have talked rudely to her when she inquired about it, Johnson said, 
and now won't even allow her to remove personal belongings from the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
The police indifference is especially galling to Johnson and others because it 
was the people of Dog Town who first rushed forward to try to save victims of 
the freeway collapse, even when it meant endangering their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
Dwayne McDougle, 30, who lives about three blocks from the freeway, said that 
when police first arrived at the disaster site, they actually pulled guns on 
would-be rescuers and accused them of looting the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Although there were early reports that some of the trapped victims were robbed, 
police now say that these reports are unconfirmed. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would we steal from dead people?" McDougle asked. "That's like putting a 
curse on yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Another resident said that police seem to believe that "everybody around here 
steals." 
</P>
<P>
And another said he doubted police would feel that way "if this was a white 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood is part of a district known as West Oakland, which has the 
largest concentration of blacks in the city. A working-class district, it 
includes heavy industry, neighborhood stores, low-income housing projects and 
Victorian-era homes, some of which are run-down and have been converted into 
apartments, others of which are being restored by affluent black families. 
</P>
<P>
The district also includes the bustling Port of Oakland, which has led Tom 
Berkley, publisher of a string of minority newspapers in the Bay Area, to call 
West Oakland "The richest area of the city, and the poorest." 
</P>
<P>
Well-known blacks who grew up in the neighborhood have included Rep. Ronald V. 
Dellums (D-Berkeley), civil rights figure A. Philip Randolph, Black Panther 
co-founder Huey P. Newton and basketball great Bill Russell. 
</P>
<P>
Berkley says the construction of the freeway through the heart of West Oakland 
between 1955 and 1957 tore an irreparable wound in the community. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a big hullabaloo at the time," he said, "but it was a fait accompli 
because the poor and the weak could not stand up to the powerful."

QUAKE FINGERPRINTS PROVIDE PERPLEXING CLUES FOR SCIENTISTS

<DATELINE>
<P>
LOMA PRIETA, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Geologist David Schwartz strides slowly along the four-foot-wide gash through 
Freda and John Tranbarger's lawn just off Summit Drive in the Santa Cruz 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
It's chilly here, this Friday morning after the great earthquake of 1989, and 
gathering clouds portend an afternoon storm that may wash away some traces of 
the temblor. Already, Schwartz's search for clues to the quake's nature has 
been interrupted by three television crews and numerous reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz has been exceptionally patient answering the questions. But now, as he 
follows the rapidly narrowing crack along a fire road, down a gully, back up 
the steep slope and through a heavily wooded area back to Summit Drive, a note 
of tension enters his voice -- and a much larger amount of perplexity. This 
quake is just not behaving the way they expected it to. 
</P>
<P>
In a magnitude 7 temblor along the San Andreas fault, like the Loma Prieta 
quake, geologists would expect to see a 30-mile-long gash here, near the 
quake's epicenter, with perhaps 3 to 6 feet of what they call right lateral 
movement. Standing on one side of the crack, it should look like the ground on 
the other side has moved three feet or more to the right as the giant Pacific 
tectonic plate slipped northwestward relative to the North American plate. 
</P>
<P>
But what they have found instead is a 250-yard-long gash -- as well as much 
narrower cracks that continue into the distance -- and if there is any lateral 
movement, it unexplainably is mostly in the wrong direction. "To have this 
degree of cracking without a lateral event is just . . . well, it's just not 
what we expected." 
</P>
<P>
The team will eventually conclude that the quake certainly did occur on the San 
Andreas fault, but they will probably be trying to explain the mystifying 
features for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz is one of a team of eight U.S. Geological Survey researchers who are 
clambering through the Santa Cruz Mountains, measuring the width of cracks, 
charting their lateral movement, surveying their lengths -- trying, in effect, 
to take the earthquake's fingerprints. At least a dozen others from the 
survey's office in Menlo Park are out scouting other locations in the Bay Area, 
as they have been every day since the Tuesday quake, questioning witnesses and 
looking for evidence of the quake's appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence, witnesses, fingerprints. It sounds like a police investigation, and 
in many ways it is. Tracking down the evidence after a quake "is really like a 
detective story," says geologist Manuel G. Bonilla, who has been on the 
survey's beat since 1947. "You have just a few clues, and you have to make 
inferences about things. That's true of geology in general. You have a limited 
amount of information and you have to make the most reasonable interpretation. 
That's partly why it's so much fun." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, just like in a murder case, the clues are disappearing rapidly. 
Caltrans has already repaired breaks in Summit Drive that would have provided 
clues, TV crews and print reporters are trampling over cracks and fissures, 
farmers south of Watsonville are already plowing fields where good evidence had 
been spotted in an aerial survey, and the impending rain threatens to destroy 
much of the evidence that's still left. 
</P>
<P>
This one is going to be difficult. At lunch outside the devastated Summit 
Market, where broken bottles and cans still litter the aisles and flies are 
beginning to collect, Schwartz observes that tracking a typical San Andreas 
quake with a pronounced surface fissure "is like solving a jigsaw puzzle with 
10 pieces. This is like a puzzle with a thousand pieces." And in this case, 
someone else observes, "most of the pieces are blank." 
</P>
<P>
But if they can put all the pieces together and learn exactly what happened in 
the Loma Prieta quake and why, it will give them crucial insights about how to 
prepare for future earthquakes and to minimize damage. Eventually, every 
geologist dreams, such information may lead them to a technique for predicting 
temblors before they occur. 
</P>
<P>
Survey headquarters have been a beehive of activity since the quake occurred at 
5:04 p.m. Tuesday, knocking power out and taking most of their instruments 
off-line. Photographers and TV news crews are disappointed Tuesday evening and 
Wednesday when they arrive at Menlo Park to take the now-de rigueur pictures of 
the seismograph's squiggly record of the temblor's shaking. The charts show 
only a quarter-inch blip before the seismographs died: No visuals. 
</P>
<P>
Senior scientists are on the phone all day, trying to compare their information 
with that collected by other field stations like those in Pasadena and at USC. 
Allan Lindh, who had, in effect, predicted Tuesday's quake, is on the phone 
virtually all day. Over a year ago, the survey had predicted a 30% chance that 
a quake this size would appear at this location within the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
With his stringy brown full beard and his long hair, Lindh looks the part of a 
campus guru from the 60s. But on the phone, he is the voice of calm reason, 
telling first a New York City reporter, then a Toronto reporter that "not many 
people would have predicted the deaths and destruction" in San Francisco, so 
far away from the quake's epicenter eight miles outside of Santa Cruz. "It 
clearly raises our level of concern about the Hayward and other faults in the 
area." 
</P>
<P>
Lindh refuses to exult in the success of the prediction because of the death 
and damage, but there is some satisfaction in his voice when he later says, 
"For once, we seem to have been right." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Lindh and others are perturbed by reports that Lucile Jones of 
the survey's Caltech office is contradicting them. The Menlo Park geologists 
are calling the Loma Prieta quake a classical slip-strike quake on the San 
Andreas fault. In a slip-strike quake, the two tectonic plates scrape sideways 
against each other. But Jones is saying in Pasadena that it's a thrust quake, 
in which one plate tries to climb over the top of its neighbor, and that it may 
not be on the San Andreas. 
</P>
<P>
"Lucy is a wonderful lady, but she's a long way from here and talk is cheap," 
Lindh says. "If we had done the same thing and contradicted her account of the 
Palm Springs quake, she would have blown her top." By the end of the week, the 
quake is definitely pinpointed on the San Andreas, although it may have some 
thrust components, but Jones' comments still rankle. 
</P>
<P>
While senior officials are collating data and fending off the press, everyone 
else is pressed into service, scattering throughout the region searching for 
evidence of the quake activity. One team walks through the devastated Marina 
District, searching for evidence of liquefaction -- ground failure that turned 
the filled-in soil to a form of "instant quicksand" incapable of supporting 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
They find plenty of evidence, mostly in the form of "sand boils," volcano-like 
mounds of sand that are forced to the surface when the soil goes through 
liquefaction. They chart the locations of each boil and collect samples of the 
sand. 
</P>
<P>
Another team goes to check the base of the Bay Bridge, where a collapsed 
segment promises to foul Bay Area traffic for weeks. They search for evidence 
of ground failure around the bridge supports like that in the Marina, but find 
none. They conclude that simple shaking did in the bridge. Another team checks 
the ground at the Cypress structure, the now-infamous section of Interstate 880 
where the upper level of roadway collapsed, crushing 50 or more cars 
underneath. Again, no ground failure. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Lajoie and Dan Ponti charter a single-engined plane and cruise at low 
altitude around the entire fringe of the bay. "Even flying at 500 feet and 100 
m.p.h.," signs of liquefaction and surface damage are clearly visible, he 
reports later. They are surprised that liquefaction has not occurred in many 
areas where they thought it might. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the Marina, most of the liquefaction seems to have occurred in the 
northwest corner of the bay under the Naval Air Station in Alameda and Oakland 
Airport. Both are built on reclaimed areas over a Pleistocene-era formation 
called the Merritt Sands. The formation itself has settled firmly into place by 
now, but the sand was used to fill in the airports' land and has liquefied 
badly. 
</P>
<P>
Lajoie notes that he once worked for PG&amp;E, excavating trenches in that 
area, and they excavated hundreds of Indian skeletons. "People always bury 
their dead where it's easiest to dig," he notes. 
</P>
<P>
Every lab has a "Doc," a senior scientist respected or even revered by other 
researchers for his or her experience and knowledge. At Menlo Park, it's 
Bonilla, who has been there since 1947. Thursday afternoon, Doc Bonilla takes a 
reporter along as he goes to check damage in Foster City. 
</P>
<P>
Developer T. Jack Foster built Foster City on bottom land that had been 
reclaimed by building a levee around it. The construction of Foster City was 
controversial because it is built on fill like that in the Marina District and 
is thus susceptible to liquefaction. 
</P>
<P>
And the whole extent of Foster City is lower than the Bay at high tide. If the 
levees were to break, Doc said, the flooding would be "devastating." 
</P>
<P>
Local reporters have persistently been asking why there wasn't more damage in 
Foster City, and survey officials are clearly concerned about its fate in 
future temblors. But after visiting there, Doc said: "It doesn't appear that 
much happened (in Foster City) this time. Still, that doesn't mean it won't 
happen in the big one." Nonetheless, Doc is now "more confident" about Foster 
City's fate in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's Friday, and Schwartz and his colleagues are tramping along Summit 
Drive -- in part because the news media and one or two geologists have 
identified the Tranbarger's yard as the site of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
But work is difficult because of the distractions. Airplanes and helicopters 
are flying overhead, news crews are filming, tourists and neighbors are 
gawking. 
</P>
<P>
As Schwartz examines one crack on the side of Summit Drive, a taxi pulls up and 
three Japanese scientists emerge. With gestures and a little English, Prof. 
Moriya of Nihon University explains that he has just flown in and has come to 
see the quake. He shows Schwartz a book he prepared about the Spitak quake in 
Armenia and indicates he will do the same here. Clutching a newspaper map, he 
asks for directions to the epicenter. Another team of Japanese are subsequently 
spotted in a dark blue limousine. 
</P>
<P>
Other geologists abound, from the University of Nevada, UC Berkeley, Cornell, 
the state geologist's office. Schwartz sees two men carefully mapping the 
cracks near the Tranbargers' house, a process that he is just starting. One is 
young Burt Hardin, who works for a geological consulting company. They don't 
have a contract to study the quake, he says, but "it's a once-in-a-lifetime 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
Gently, perhaps resignedly, Schwartz assures him: "There'll be other chances." 
</P>
<P>
As the day wears on, the geologists carefully measure and plot the cracks, 
drawing each site in their notebooks and recording their observations. Schwartz 
says he plotted 3,400 sites along a fault in Guatemala for his doctoral thesis: 
"Looking back at my notebooks, I can visualize every one of them." 
</P>
<P>
On the roadways, they spray-paint sharp-edged stripes across the cracks so 
subsequent movements can be detected. At other sites, they force a row of 
18-penny galvanized nails into the ground across the cracks. 
</P>
<P>
The team is putting in benchmarks so they'll know if further movement occurs. 
Sometimes, slipping along the fault continues for weeks. Sometimes, from a 
deep-centered quake like this one, the surface doesn't rupture until days or 
even weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the following week, the media will be gone, the repair crews will 
have finished along Summit Drive, life will go on pretty much as usual. Despite 
the extensive ground cracking, damage has not been severe. 
</P>
<P>
But Schwartz and his brothers-at-arms will be back, daily at first, then less 
frequently. They will continue returning until they know the quake has 
finished. Then they'll write up their report and wait for the next earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Geologists say there's a 50% chance of another magnitude 7 quake in the Bay 
Area in the next 30 years, and there are always lots of smaller temblors to 
chase. They probably won't have to wait long.

BLOOD DONATIONS ARE GENEROUS; NEW GIFTS DISCOURAGED FOR NOW

Southern Californians donated so much blood in the days after Tuesday's 
earthquake in Northern California that Los Angeles area Red Cross officials are 
asking people to delay further donations until later in the year, when 
shortages often occur. 
</P>
<P>
"I am really so proud of Southern California. They responded in such a 
fantastic way," said Barbara Wilks, a Red Cross spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
By Friday, donations from Southern California had doubly replenished supplies 
of some blood types the Red Cross had sent to the San Francisco area, Wilks 
said. She said the Red Cross never turns away potential donors, but said that 
with supplies of blood for the earthquake crisis under control, donors would be 
better off helping the local supply later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco area hospitals had anticipated a huge demand for blood after the 
quake, but actual injuries were fewer than expected.

DELORS -- VIEWS ON EUROPE, TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tyler Marshall 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here are excerpts of comments made by Jacques Delors, president of the European 
Community Executive Commission, during an interview in his Brussels office: 
</P>
<P>
 On the trade disputes between the United States and the European Community and 
managing American concern: 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a close link between the spirit of the overall relationship between 
the U.S. and Europe on one side and the process of solving commercial disputes 
on the other. . . . It seems to me that if the president of the European 
Council plus the president of the European Commission would have the 
opportunity to meet the President of the United States and the secretary of 
state two times a year for a global assessment of the situation . . . this 
would be a good solution." 
</P>
<P>
 On European Community relations with Japan: 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan has refused its world responsibilities. It manages, and very 
intelligently from my point of view, a global strategy in the world economy, 
but in a (secretive) fashion -- and that explains the worry of many Americans 
and why they watch Japan. It's a real political problem to pursue, to convince, 
to press Japan to accept the burden-sharing of the world. My desire is that we 
won't have the same attitude toward the United States as to Japan. A more open 
attitude toward the U.S. (is possible) because history, the spirit and (our 
common) experience is very good. But vis-a-vis Japan, Europe must become 
tougher and tougher." 
</P>
<P>
 On meeting the December, 1992, deadline for completion of the community's 
internal market: 
</P>
<P>
 "The speed is good. The political will is very good also. (There is) no 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 On the issue of a single European currency: 
</P>
<P>
 "We've made progress toward a consensus on the first stage of European 
monetary union. It is very important that the British prime minister has 
accepted the first stage. . . . I have a vision, but to fulfill this vision 
it's necessary to become more pragmatic and to pay attention to the national 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 On the EC's political role in Eastern Europe: 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is . . . how to avoid a return to totalitarianism and the Cold 
War. One way -- not the only one -- is to offer a very solid front of the 12 EC 
countries and the possibility for each Communist country to have close 
cooperation with the 12 to modernize their economies and consolidate their 
steps toward more freedom and democracy. . . . We must accelerate the political 
construction of (the community) to offer solid ground." 
</P>
<P>
 On the answer to the so-called German question and a possible European 
Community role in it: 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way to convince the Russians, the Americans, the other European 
countries to find a good, acceptable solution to the two German nations is 
inside the community -- within the framework of the community. I don't speak of 
reunification but . . . of closer relations between the two German peoples 
because the framework of the community, with a touch of federalism, offers a 
possible solution." Tyler Marshall

E. GERMAN CHIEF HINTS AT MORE MODERATE LINE; 
</P>
<P>
EAST BLOC: EGON KRENZ IS CONGRATULATED BY GORBACHEV IN A PHONE CALL THAT COULD 
PRESAGE A NEW POLICY DIRECTION. 
</P>

<P>
East Germany's new leader, Egon Krenz, spoke to Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev by telephone Saturday and received the Kremlin leader's personal 
congratulations on his new post. 
</P>
<P>
ADN, the official East German news agency, reported that the two leaders talked 
for the first time since Krenz replaced Communist veteran Erich Honecker on 
Wednesday. Krenz, a reputed hard-liner like Honecker, apparently took a 
moderate line with Gorbachev, who in the past had unsuccessfully urged Honecker 
to consider reforms in his regime. 
</P>
<P>
The telephone call took place at the same time Saturday that thousands of East 
Berliners were marching silently in a pro-democracy demonstration that ended 
without incident. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators formed a human chain and marched through the center of East 
Berlin from the Palace of the Republic, the modern seat of Parliament, to the 
heart of old Berlin, the huge open square known as the Alexanderplatz. 
</P>
<P>
The marchers were mainly young people. They chanted no slogans and carried no 
banners. They simply walked in silence while police stood by and made no 
attempt to break up the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile here in Bonn, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Saturday urged 
the new East German leadership to permit free elections. 
</P>
<P>
"Our compatriots in East Germany must finally be allowed to express for 
themselves which road they want to take in the future," Kohl said. 
</P>
<P>
"The unity of the German nation could not be destroyed during decades of state 
division," he said in a speech to an organization of Germans expelled from 
Eastern Europe after the war. 
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, prospects for self-determination, freedom and respect for human 
rights always also mean a chance for reunification of our fatherland. It is our 
national mission to seize this chance." 
</P>
<P>
In his telephone conversation with Gorbachev -- the news agency did not say who 
originated the call -- the 52-year-old Krenz, who in his first few days as 
leader has seemed to try to shed his Communist hard-liner image, received an 
invitation to visit the Soviet Union in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
The 77-year-old Honecker, who stepped down because of ill health and his 
failure to control a crisis that in recent weeks spurred tens of thousands of 
East German citizens to find refuge in the West, was not personally close to 
Gorbachev. More than once he said publicly that the kinds of reforms that 
Gorbachev is undertaking in the Soviet Union are not necessary in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
According to ADN, Krenz appeared to be more sympathetic to Gorbachev's position 
on political and economic changes than Honecker. 
</P>
<P>
ADN quoted Krenz as saying: "The experiences of the Soviet Communists in the 
restructuring in their country are also significant for the GDR (German 
Democratic Republic, East Germany's formal name)." 
</P>
<P>
In reply, Gorbachev was quoted as telling Krenz: "The most important thing is 
the strengthening of socialism and the safeguarding of peace." 
</P>
<P>
The news agency said that Krenz accepted Gorbachev's invitation to visit the 
Soviet Union and that, in Moscow, he would gain an understanding of Soviet 
developments and outline his own plans for the future course of East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Krenz, said ADN, told Gorbachev that he would speak about "the policy of 
renewal and continuity in East Germany." 
</P>
<P>
According to reports from East Berlin, the city's Communist Party chief, 
Guenter Schabowski, met several hundred demonstrators on the street outside the 
Palace of the Republic before Saturday's protest and tried to persuade the 
young people not to march. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the way to go about things," he told the gathering. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators paid him no heed, and, as they moved away, Schabowski 
reportedly placed his arms across a man's chest as if to dissuade him from 
marching. 
</P>
<P>
"Leave me alone," said the East Berliner, and walked off with the 
demonstrators.

LEBANESE CHRISTIANS' FIGHT TO OUST SYRIAN TROOPS SEEMS FRUITLESS

TAIF, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fighting for their political life and the hope of salvaging three weeks of 
peace talks, Lebanon's Christian majority dug in for a last stand Saturday amid 
growing signs that their fight to eject Syria from Lebanon is doomed to fail. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly isolated even from their own nominal Christian government in 
Beirut, Christian Parliament leaders met through the night in this Saudi 
mountain resort for the second straight day in an attempt to end 14 years of 
civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Their talks, conference sources said, could also amount to a political crisis 
point for Christian army commander Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, whose threats to 
ignore any peace plan that doesn't end Syrian occupation have prompted even his 
strongest supporters in Parliament to consider breaking ranks and moving 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to sway Aoun during telephone conversations Saturday morning about a 
compromise political reform plan, hard-line Christian leader Georges Saade 
"couldn't face" another telephone call Saturday afternoon and asked other 
Christian leaders to talk with Aoun, one conference source said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a kind of tension in the air. Not very good," said another source 
close to the talks, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
The late-night meetings came amid growing pressure to end three weeks of 
negotiations on a proposed national reconciliation charter that would end the 
Christians' historic dominance in Lebanon and disband the feuding militias that 
now constitute the nation's government. 
</P>
<P>
Stalled for weeks over the Christians' refusal to endorse political reforms 
without a pledge for withdrawal of the Syrian forces that now control 
two-thirds of the country, the talks came to a head Friday night when Arab 
League mediators announced a series of new concessions to the Christians that 
pointedly did not contain any firm schedule for Syrian troop withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
In two long days of meetings since Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al 
Faisal's return from consultations in Damascus, Christian deputies have been 
cornered between continued threats from Aoun in Beirut and the certainty of 
renewed civil war if they do not sign the political reform pact. 
</P>
<P>
Turning up the political heat even further, diplomats from the United States, 
France and Britain arrived in Taif on Saturday in yet another attempt to 
pressure Christian leaders into signing the pact that Arab League mediators 
have described as the last chance for peace in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the Christian camp said it is likely that a majority will, 
within the coming day, endorse the reform plan, which would divide Lebanon's 
Parliament evenly between Christians and Muslims, despite last-minute 
statements of opposition from Aoun and top Christian politician M. Dany 
Chamoun. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the talks, being sponsored by a tripartite Arab League committee 
that negotiated the current cease-fire in Lebanon, Christian deputies have 
sought a stepped-up timetable for withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian troops that 
first entered Lebanon in 1976 as a peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
Muslim deputies have urged against a speedy pullout, arguing that the Syrian 
forces are all that stand against further chaos in a country that is literally 
governed by warring militias. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to break the logjam, Prince Saud held two days of meetings with 
Syrian President Hafez Assad and other top Syrian officials, returning Friday 
with some new concessions that would limit the points at which Syrian troops 
could be stationed after an initial two-year redeployment. 
</P>
<P>
The charter proposed by the tripartite committee calls for Syrian troops, after 
establishment of a new reform government in Lebanon, to assist Lebanese forces 
in reestablishing control over the country and then, within a maximum of two 
years, pulling back to the Bekaa Valley and "other positions" nearby. The 
charter provides that the Syrian government, "in agreement" with the new 
government in Lebanon, would decide the exact configuration of the redeployment 
and how long Syria would remain there. 
</P>
<P>
For the Christians, the wording of the charter has been unacceptable both 
because it gives the Syrians the upper hand in decision-making and because it 
contains no firm schedule for a complete Syrian pullout. Moreover, they have 
been alarmed at its provisions allowing Syrian troops in "other positions" in 
the Bekaa region, language that the Christians believe could leave the way open 
for Syrian troops to remain in the mountains above Beirut, within artillery 
range of Christian enclaves. 
</P>
<P>
Syria has been reluctant to relinquish its strategic positions in the hills and 
along the critical Beirut-to-Damascus highway. 
</P>
<P>
But Saud, in a series of meetings with Lebanese deputies Friday and Saturday, 
reported that Syria has agreed that troop deployment in those "other positions" 
will be permitted only if agreed on by a joint Syrian-Lebanese military 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
The Syrians also agreed that discussions about the Syrian redeployment would be 
determined jointly by the Lebanese and Syrian governments, and that either 
party could call in the Arab League committee to mediate should trouble arise. 
</P>
<P>
As a final concession, Assad reportedly endorsed a Christian demand to 
establish a security zone free of Syrian troops around the Lebanese Parliament 
building while deliberations to elect a new president are under way. 
</P>
<P>
The concessions were clearly not enough for Aoun, whose spokesman Saturday 
night called the proposed agreement "a trap for all Lebanese . . . (that) will 
not be any more than a surrender to the Syrian will."

ABORTION FUNDING LEGISLATION VETOED BY BUSH; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: REP. DORNAN SUGGESTS THAT A MORE STRINGENT BILL COULD HELP LEAD TO 
A COMPROMISE. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush vetoed legislation Saturday authorizing federal abortion funding 
for rape and incest victims, but one of the leaders of the anti-abortion 
movement in Congress said he sees a subsequent compromise in the cards. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), who is involved in congressional 
discussions with the White House, said that if an attempt to override the veto 
fails, even the most strident opponents of abortion in Congress are likely to 
join Bush in accepting a law providing funds to end pregnancies in rape or 
incest cases under certain conditions. 
</P>
<P>
First, Dornan said, a sexual assault would have to be reported to law 
enforcement officials. The landmark abortion legislation that Bush vetoed 
Saturday would have allowed reporting to health clinics in addition to law 
enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan said that a rape victim would be required to report the attack to police 
within 48 hours, and an incest victim would have to name her assailant. The 
legislation Congress had approved called only for "prompt" reporting and 
required no identification in incest cases. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County conservative said the new provisions would prevent women who 
are not victims of rape or incest from fraudulently using the law to obtain 
abortions financed by Medicaid or other federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
It also would rule out use of federal funds in all but a handful of abortions, 
perhaps as few as 100 each year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can live with this," Dornan said. "We're a pluralistic government here with 
lots of viewpoints, and if they (pro-choice forces) are willing to give us 
tight laws . . . (to prevent) fraud and abuse, and we start putting fathers in 
jail who are . . . drunken rapists, and we get more rapes reported, we've 
accomplished a goal that all of us, liberals and conservatives, can agree on. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is, it's still taking a human life," Dornan said. "I'm not 
conceding anything . . . (but) I'm trying to tell the pro-lifers who are 
single-issue people, God bless them, I love them, but they don't have to sit 
here and make a government run." 
</P>
<P>
Dornan's comments are significant because he and Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) 
and a handful of others have been the point men for the national anti-abortion 
movement in the House of Representatives. Both Hyde and Dornan have huddled 
regularly on the issue in recent weeks with White House Chief of Staff John H. 
Sununu. 
</P>
<P>
After Saturday's veto, Bush issued a statement from the presidential retreat at 
Camp David, Md., saying: "I have informed Congress on numerous occasions that I 
would veto legislation if it permitted the use of appropriated funds to pay for 
abortions other than those in which the life of the mother would be in danger 
of a fetus carried to term." 
</P>
<P>
Asked earlier Saturday about Dornan's assessment of the prospects for a 
compromise, a White House spokesman said: "We will have no comment at this 
time." 
</P>
<P>
But Dornan said the White House is open to considering another measure 
authorizing funding for abortion in cases of rape and incest under restricted 
provisions. "I think they're expecting that language to come back (in a new 
bill)," Dornan said. "And if it does, this (controversy) will disappear 
overnight." 
</P>
<P>
The bill vetoed by Bush contains 1990 fiscal year funding for the Labor 
Department as well as the Department of Health and Human Services. The funding 
for both departments will continue temporarily under a continuing resolution 
that keeps current law in effect. 
</P>
<P>
An amendment providing for expanded federal funding of abortions had been added 
to the appropriations measure by Congress. In every previous year since 1981, 
Congress had adopted an amendment offered by Hyde that bans federal funding of 
any abortions except those to save the life of the mother. 
</P>
<P>
The national debate over abortion heated up after the Supreme Court earlier 
this year chipped away at the landmark 1972 case, Roe vs. Wade, that legalized 
abortions through the first three months of pregnancy. In a Missouri case, the 
high court held that states have the right to restrict abortions. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling was hailed by abortion opponents and denounced by pro-choice groups 
and feminist organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Partisans on both sides of the current debate have said that they expect the 
Senate and House to attempt to override the President's veto, which requires a 
two-thirds vote. The fight is expected to be close in the Senate, but Dornan 
said an override would fail in the House. 
</P>
<P>
"Those 206 votes are solid," he said, referring to the House members who voted 
against expanded funding. 
</P>
<P>
Even Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae), who led the House fight to permit 
federal funding of rape and incest abortions, conceded that the override 
attempt in the House "very well may" fail. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we'll decide what we're going to do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said she was surprised by Dornan's suggestion that conservative 
anti-abortionists are willing to accept some type of federal funding for 
abortions for victims of rape and incest. 
</P>
<P>
"That's news," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Boxer said she believes that pro-choice forces already have compromised 
enough. "For . . . years, the Hyde amendment stood in that bill, and for as 
many years I voted for the bill even though it had the Hyde amendment in it. 
</P>
<P>
"I say to my friends who may not agree with me on this issue, to do what I did. 
Swallow your pride, and accept the fact that it is the will of the House that 
there be an exception for rape and incest, and vote for the bill the way it 
is." 
</P>
<P>
But Dornan said he believes liberals like Boxer who back federal funding for 
rape and incest abortions will be under increasing pressure from constituents 
to tighten the bill's language to make it acceptable to conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
White House officials have told some in the anti-abortion movement that after 
initially considering the possibility of a compromise, Bush decided to veto the 
measure, in part, because Boxer and others had painted him as indecisive on the 
issue, Dornan said. 
</P>
<P>
"Barbara Boxer went on one or two (television) shows too many, and pushed her 
line: 'He (Bush) has more positions on this issue than Imelda Marcos (former 
Philippines First Lady) has shoes.' Somebody down at the White House told a 
pro-lifer, 'We're sick of hearing that line.' 
</P>
<P>
"It was being shoved in his face that he was all over the place," Dornan said. 
"So they said, 'OK, that's it. We veto. And we'll build after that.' " 
</P>
<P>
Dornan said he counseled a veto, based on the current language of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan, a Roman Catholic, allowed that he has another trick up his sleeve to 
ensure that the current language does not survive. He said he has compiled a 
list of Roman Catholic representatives who voted against him on the abortion 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
When Roman Catholic bishops from across the country gather in Washington next 
month for their annual meeting, Dornan said he will make a suggestion to the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Individual bishops should invite for dinner those Roman Catholic 
representatives who voted for the current language in the HHS bill, Dornan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know a Catholic who is worthy of the name who would ever turn down his 
bishop," Dornan said.

A Smyrna man infected with the AIDS virus was convicted of attempted murder for 
biting a police officer and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Gregory Scott 
Scroggins, 27, bit David Crook as the officer was investigating a dispute 
between Scroggins and his roommate in January. Crook said he has tested 
negative for the virus twice. Scroggins said he bit because the officer had him 
in a chokehold and he could not breathe. An Emory University medical school 
professor said there have been no confirmed cases of the virus being 
transmitted through saliva.

About three dozen parachutists leaped off the country's second tallest bridge 
at Fayetteville, W. Va., in defiance of official warnings that flooding of 
landing sites made the jump too dangerous on the one day a year it is allowed. 
No injuries were reported in the jumps from the New River Gorge National 
Bridge. Police cited one parachutist who landed in a parking lot for 
parachuting onto federal property without a permit.

Five railroad cars full of rotting refuse were on their way back to

the four firms involved in carting the trash lacked a permit allowing garbage 
to be transferred from railroad cars to dump trucks. The cars headed back after 
the state obtained a restraining order against the dumping and threatened to 
fine the companies $25,000 for each day the garbage was parked at a rail yard.

The Soviet economic growth rate was cut almost in half this year by lower 
production, strikes and ethnic unrest, while foreign trade and consumer prices 
were higher, a government official said in a report published Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Growth was 2.4% in the first nine months of 1989, compared to 4.7% in the same 
period last year, said Nikolai G. Belov, deputy chairman of the State Committee 
for Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
"Negative tendencies were notably on an increase from July to September, caused 
mostly by the weakening of production discipline, ethnic conflicts and 
strikes," the official Tass news agency quoted Belov as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Many Soviet coal miners walked off their jobs this summer demanding better 
working conditions. Ethnic disputes brought on strikes in factories in the 
republics of Azerbaijan, Moldavia and Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
Last month Armenia's economy was largely shut down after an Azerbaijani rail 
blockade cut off supplies of fuel, food and building materials in a dispute 
over a territory both republics claim. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices rose 2.6% so far this year and demand remains greater than 
supply, Belov said. 
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months, foreign trade grew by 2.8% and all but 0.5% of it was 
increased imports, Belov said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the number of foreign companies forming joint ventures with Soviet 
companies grew to 936, involving 53 different countries and employing 15,000 
people, Soviet and foreign.

SOUTH AFRICA: THE FAMED BLACK LEADER PRESSURES PRETORIA TO RELEASE PRISONERS 
AND ACCEPT THE BANNED ANC AS A FORCE IT CANNOT IGNORE.

<P>
Nelson R. Mandela and four anti-apartheid leaders dined on steak, fries and 
politics in his prison house one evening early this month, then repaired to the 
lounge and switched on the government's nightly news. 
</P>
<P>
When the newscaster announced the decision to free several of Mandela's closest 
colleagues from prison, a look of satisfaction crossed the face of the 
71-year-old leader, according to those present. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Mandela," the newscaster added, "was fully apprised of the decision." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to the best sleep of my life," Mandela told his dinner 
guests. 
</P>
<P>
That extraordinary dinner party in Mandela's house on the grounds of a prison 
farm near Cape Town, and Mandela's clearly crucial role in pressing the 
government to free his associates after a quarter century in jail, illustrate 
the considerable power and influence that the aging leader of the outlawed 
African National Congress is wielding today from prison. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who has not been seen or heard publicly for 27 years, is not running 
the anti-apartheid struggle from inside prison, nor has he entered negotiations 
with the government. But to a remarkable extent, he has been able to maintain a 
dialogue with the government and apply pressure on it to release political 
prisoners and accept the ANC as a force it cannot ignore in South Africa's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela has gained a larger-than-life status while in prison, and millions of 
blacks, most born after he went on trial for treason and sabotage in 1963, 
consider him their true leader. Upon meeting him for the first time, visitors 
are often struck by his booming voice and regal bearing. 
</P>
<P>
"When you are in the room with him, you sense you are with a person of unique 
greatness," said Cyril Ramaphosa, leader of the National Union of Mineworkers. 
"He has a magnetic presence." 
</P>
<P>
The government moved Mandela last year to a three-bedroom house, ordinarily 
reserved for prison officials, on prison grounds in lush wine country. He 
cannot place or receive phone calls, but his jailers have allowed him 
increasing numbers of visitors, frequently over lunch or dinner, and placed no 
time restrictions on those visits. 
</P>
<P>
At Mandela's request, four leaders of the Mass Democratic Movement, a newly 
formed coalition of the country's leading anti-apartheid groups, came for 
dinner Oct. 10, the night the government announced that it would release 
Mandela's closest confidant, Walter Sisulu, and seven others. 
</P>
<P>
The delegation, including Ramaphosa, Sisulu's wife, Albertina, Murphy Morobe 
and Cassim Saloojee, arrived about 6 p.m., minutes after Sisulu and several 
other inmates had ended a five-hour visit. 
</P>
<P>
Saloojee said he found it "grandly exciting" but also "a weird experience" to 
be sitting in a comfortable home behind prison fences and being served dinner 
by a white guard who called Mandela "sir." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, dressed in a suit and tie and looking fit, cautioned them that their 
conversations might be overheard. 
</P>
<P>
"You must assume we are not alone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the guests recalled later, everyone spoke fairly freely, 
discussing the seriousness of the government's pledge to negotiate with black 
leaders and the successful defiance campaign launched in August by the Mass 
Democratic Movement. Mandela praised the MDM campaign and disclosed that the 
government intended to free the senior ANC leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"He had told us about the releases, but when we heard it on television it made 
the whole thing so real," said Saloojee, president of the Transvaal Indian 
Congress. "We could feel he was deeply moved. He hugged Ma Sisulu. It was a 
great moment for him because he knew he had played a role." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the evening, Mandela had read to them from his own handwritten 
document, outlining his thoughts on the current challenges facing the black 
liberation struggle. None of the visitors would reveal the contents of that 
document, but Saloojee said it showed Mandela to be "remarkably well-informed. 
His knowledge of what is happening in the country was such that you would not 
believe he had been cut off for all these years." 
</P>
<P>
Senior government officials have been paying Mandela private visits since 
before 1982, when he was moved from Robben Island to Pollsmoor Prison. In 
recent months, he has met many times with Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee and 
Constitutional Development Minister Gerrit Viljoen, whom President Frederik W. 
de Klerk has appointed to get negotiations going with the black majority. 
</P>
<P>
Being in jail has put Mandela in a unique position to talk with the government, 
which refuses to meet publicly with leaders of the ANC in exile until the 
guerrilla group renounces violence or at least expresses a commitment to a 
peaceful solution in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela told his visitors that the meetings were an attempt to persuade the 
government to release its political prisoners and negotiate with the ANC 
leaders in exile. Anti-apartheid sources say he entered into no agreements with 
the government about his colleagues' release and made no promises about how 
they might behave once they were free. 
</P>
<P>
The government's decision to release Sisulu and the others was welcomed in 
world capitals and was widely seen as an effort to buy time for De Klerk's 
reform program and test the waters for Mandela's own release. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he made no promises about how his fellow ANC leaders would behave 
once they were free, but he had told government officials that the released men 
would need to meet current leaders of the ANC in exile, as well as internal 
leaders, to seek their orders. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the freed prisoners have stressed the need for "order and discipline" 
in the anti-apartheid movement and sought to defuse potential clashes with the 
authorities. The police, meanwhile, have allowed the ANC leaders considerable 
latitude, effectively lifting the 29-year ban on the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela said his own release is not an issue under consideration now, while 400 
people remain jailed for political crimes, 15 of them like himself serving life 
sentences. Government officials have said Mandela may be released sometime next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"The release of his colleagues has always been paramount in his mind," said 
Morobe, acting publicity secretary of the United Democratic Front. "He sees 
himself as having an obligation to them." 
</P>
<P>
When Mandela is released, anti-apartheid leaders say, he will not fade into the 
background as an aging elder statesman. 
</P>
<P>
"From the way he thinks and discusses things, I believe he has an enormous role 
to play in shaping the future," Saloojee said. "He's going to make quite an 
impact as the leader of the ANC."

ISRAELI POLICE INVESTIGATING CASE OF TEL AVIV STRANGLER, 7 VICTIMS

<P>
Police are searching for a Palestinian suspected of strangling seven people in 
Tel Aviv, and the case has led officials to reevaluate the policy that allows 
workers from the occupied territories to stay overnight in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the murders apparently stemmed from financial disputes between the 
suspect and his victims over drugs and prostitution, but they would not rule 
out that the motive might have been political. 
</P>
<P>
The victims included prostitutes and drug dealers. Some were Jews and some 
Arabs from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation began Friday when residents of an impoverished Tel Aviv 
neighborhood reported a smell coming from an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrived to discover the decomposing bodies of two women and one man 
hidden under mattresses in the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
They said the investigation led them to the Arab-Jewish Tel Aviv suburb of 
Jaffa, where the bodies of three women and one man were found in another 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Asst. Inspector Gen. Yigal Markus, the Tel Aviv police chief, said the prime 
suspect is a Palestinian from the occupied territories who had a permit to 
spend the night in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
Israel army radio said the victims apparently were strangled with a nylon 
string. 
</P>
<P>
Police Commissioner David Krauss said Saturday that the policy of granting 
permits to Palestinian workers to spend the night will be re-examined. 
</P>
<P>
"Tel Aviv should not serve as a haven for criminals from the (occupied) 
territories," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Palestinian workers travel each morning to Tel Aviv but need a 
special permit to stay the night. Many hide in apartments, warehouses or 
shelters to avoid the journey back home. 
</P>
<P>
In the continuing unrest in the occupied territories, a gang of masked men 
believed to be Palestinians attacked the Gaza Strip home of a suspected 
collaborator Saturday, wounding a brother and sister, Palestinian sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Also Saturday, an 18-year-old Palestinian youth shot during a confrontation 
with Israeli soldiers Friday died of his wounds at an Israeli hospital, the 
military said.

Leaders of the African National Congress plan to address a rally in South 
Africa for the first time since the organization was banned in 1960, activists 
said Saturday. The government has granted permission. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time for the ANC leaders to address the nation," said Cyril Ramaphosa, 
general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers. 
</P>
<P>
Seven ANC leaders freed from prison last Sunday will speak at the rally Oct. 29 
in the black township of Soweto outside Johannesburg, the activists said. 
</P>
<P>
"Apart from being a welcoming party, the rally is going to be an occasion at 
which our leaders will be making a major address to the nation on a whole range 
of issues," said Ramaphosa. 
</P>
<P>

CORONADO AWAKENS -- MAYBE -- TO A NEW THREAT; 
</P>
<P>
GANGS: THE POLICE CHIEF SAYS THE CORONADO WHITE BOYS, OR CWBS, ARE THE ISLAND'S 
FIRST GANG, BUT SOME RESIDENTS -- AND CWB MEMBERS -- CONTEND IT'S ALL AN 
OVERREACTION.

<TEXT>
<P>
The police chief of Coronado Island, Jerry Boyd, has no doubt that there are 
dangerous forces at work on his orderly, tree-lined streets across the bay from 
San Diego. They are the Coronado White Boys, the island's first gang, he says, 
and their message is "Crips, get out of town." 
</P>
<P>
Coronado parents aren't so sure. Yes, some have begun hearing about a new club, 
the CWBs. And yes, it's been hard to ignore the new teen-age fashion trend: 
white baseball caps worn askew. But, don't kids always dress funny? 
</P>
<P>
Self-proclaimed CWBs, a bunch of skateboard-riding adolescents with a penchant 
for video games, say they are the victims of gang hysteria. They have no 
intention, they say, of doing harm to anyone, especially street gangs. They say 
they're being harassed by the law, and recently they have won support from the 
island newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"Police Chief Jerry Boyd has taken what may have been a student's private joke 
and made it into something terrifying," an editorial proclaimed two weeks ago 
in the Coronado Journal. "Minors need to be protected from themselves and 
outside influences. Let us hope they do not need to be protected from the 
police." 
</P>
<P>
Local residents, many of whom settled on the six square miles of manicured 
lawns to escape big-city problems, say the furor surrounding the White Boys is 
just not Coronado's style. The exclusive community enjoys the lowest crime rate 
in San Diego County. Its phone book is littered with retired admirals and 
colonels, and more of its high school students try out for water polo than for 
football. When school lets out on a sunny day, the fresh faces of local 
teen-agers look capable of nothing more ominous than under-tipping. 
</P>
<P>
But Boyd says that, although most CWBs are law-abiding boys and girls looking 
for the social prestige of an in crowd, about eight members are out to protect 
their beach from outsiders -- and to use force if necessary. Lately, Boyd, a 
tough-talking veteran of the Los Angeles police force, has been warning parents 
that inner-city gangs may retaliate if they feel threatened by the CWBs. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll go looking for the ones who did them. If they can't find them, they'll 
go after anyone in a white baseball cap. Or worse yet, at noon, at lunchtime, 
when there's 150 kids out in the park, they'll open fire," Boyd told 45 parents 
at a meeting last week. "People say that's sensationalism, but it happens 2 1/2 
miles from here every night of the week. It's just a matter of geography." 
</P>
<P>
CWB members who agreed to talk last week said Boyd is grandstanding. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just a group of friends, not a gang," said Jamie Johnson, an articulate 
17-year-old who helped found the CWBs. "The first we heard of trying to reclaim 
the beach was what we read in the paper." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a negative influence, he said, the group has helped some of its 
members get off drugs. The CWB name, he said, was a joke, coined as an 
alternative to what other students called them: Grits, or cigarette smokers. 
</P>
<P>
"White is a neutral color, and we were trying to be neutral," said Aaron 
Renshaw, a 15-year-old sophomore with a skateboard under his arm, who said the 
name was never intended to provoke minority gangs. "We have black kids and 
Mexicans in the group, too." 
</P>
<P>
The controversy began about a month ago, when Boyd says he first heard from his 
officers that the CWBs were mixing with the 16 out-of-town gangs -- "bona fide, 
righteous gangs" -- that frequent the sparkling waters of North Beach. Then, a 
few Saturdays ago, Boyd said, there was a "push-and-shove confrontation" 
between the CWBs and the Crips, a black street gang -- a confrontation CWBs 
deny. On several nights afterward, Boyd claims, police identified cars of Crips 
cruising the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd ask, 'Hey, there's no party tonight. Why are you over here?' They said, 
'We're here looking for the white boys,' " Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
So Boyd wrote a letter to the Coronado Journal cautioning residents to keep an 
eye out for gang activity. The Coronado School District responded with both 
barrels: a gang expert was brought in to address a joint faculty meeting of the 
middle and high schools; parents of "known" CWBs received phone calls from 
school administrators; the superintendent of schools sent a letter to parents 
warning that Coronado gang activity was in the "formative" stage. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the weekly newspaper's edition two weeks ago, which suggested that 
Boyd was blowing things out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the editor, Suzanne K. Larsen, Aaron Renshaw's mother, urged her 
neighbors to "dispel the myth" surrounding the CWBs. Writing on behalf of 12 
CWBs, she made what many CWBs say is their first actual challenge: They invited 
the Coronado Police Department to a friendly game of flag football. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd says that about 15 of his officers have agreed to play in early November. 
Around the same time, however, Boyd is scheduling a gang symposium for parents 
and students. In addition to photos of Crips, Bloods, B-Down Boys and other 
gangs, Boyd plans to exhibit a collection of weapons confiscated in Coronado 
and to invite a special guest -- "a real gang member." 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to open some eyes. We'll have weapons on display. And I promise 
you, we didn't go across the bridge, seize them and bring them back over here," 
Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd says there are 50 CWBs, while the teen-agers put the number at less than 
20. 
</P>
<P>
Judging by attendance at last Tuesday parents' meeting, the public debate has 
only made some parents more curious -- and frightened. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have spray paint on my garage in a symbol, should I be worried?" one 
woman asked Boyd after hearing about the placas, or graffiti symbols, that 
gangs often leave behind. 
</P>
<P>
A concerned father wondered if it would help to publish identifying information 
about the CWBs in community watch newsletters. "Like when you go to Florida, 
(there are signs) that say, 'This is an alligator. Don't pet it.' " 
</P>
<P>
And another parent asked if the free car-pool lane on the San Diego-Coronado 
Bay Toll Bridge is to blame for increased gang activity. "I'd go back to paying 
if it means keeping people like that out of here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the CWBs have responded to the outcry by taking off their white 
hats, and they are considering dropping their name. 
</P>
<P>
"If we break the mold, it's because they're trying to mold us into trendy 
little people who wear slacks and play tennis," said Brian Wentz, 16. "But we 
aren't naive. We know gangs have guns."

THIS OLD HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
FORMER DRUG HUB DRAWS ATTENTION ON TOUR OF HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The center of attention when several historic Los Angeles homes were opened to 
the public Saturday was not an exquisite Tiffany lamp or a polished 90-year-old 
oak stairway. 
</P>
<P>
Those touring several streets in the West Adams area were intrigued instead by 
a newly restored turn-of-the-century showplace that was famous as the 
neighborhood rock house until last year, when neighbors rallied to drive the 
drug dealers out. 
</P>
<P>
"The front door had been knocked in by police battering rams," homeowner Jodi 
Siegner told wide-eyed visitors to the seventh-annual West Adams Heritage Assn. 
tour. "The living room was used for the storage of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"There were bloodstains on the walls and floor. We collected buckets of 
hypodermic needles when we moved in. The garage had been partitioned into three 
rooms for prostitution. They didn't miss a trick." 
</P>
<P>
The house sits near the end of the 2600 block of Van Buren Place, a carefully 
manicured, tree-lined street of large Craftsman-style homes built between 1904 
and 1910. 
</P>
<P>
Although some houses on surrounding streets are in disrepair, residents of the 
area have banded together to protect the area's unique architecture and view 
restoration of the home as a symbol of what neighbors can do to reclaim their 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1904, the two-story clapboard house was days away from being 
demolished by the city early last year when residents of Van Buren Place took 
action. They told local real estate agent Jane Harrington that the owner of the 
house was willing to sell -- but that no buyers were in sight. 
</P>
<P>
Preservation-minded Harrington persuaded her boss, real estate broker David 
Raposa, to purchase the house and finance its partial cleanup. She then set out 
to evict the 30 or so drug users and transients that were using the place as a 
flop house. 
</P>
<P>
There was no electricity and the toilets didn't work the day that Harrington 
and Raposa gathered their courage and walked in to inspect their $90,000 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
"One man was swinging from the original chandelier in the front entry. Another 
man under the influence of something was staggering around trying to steady 
himself. He grabbed onto one of the leaded-glass doors to the dining room 
cabinet and sent it crashing to the floor right in front of us," Harrington 
recalled Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
When Raposa checked the darkened basement, he discovered the cellar stairs had 
been used as an impromptu outhouse by occupants of the house. 
</P>
<P>
"I slipped on the steps and slid down the staircase and landed in about eight 
inches of stuff at the bottom," Raposa said. "I said, 'This can't be what I 
think it is.' But it was. A neighbor let me use his garden hose to wash myself 
off." 
</P>
<P>
Harrington paid some of occupants to clean the basement and the living area and 
hired off-duty Los Angeles police to guard the house around the clock. She 
helped move some of the occupants into drug treatment centers and rented a 
U-Haul truck to drive others to new homes around Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Siegner and husband Tom McCurnin, both of whom are attorneys, purchased the 
house 14 months ago for $200,000 when the $75,000 first phase of the renovation 
was about half finished. Since moving in, the two have spent another $30,000 on 
repairs, McCurnin said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've turned the garden hose on people out front selling crack," he said. "Two 
months ago, everyone on the street chipped in to pay for a fence across the end 
of the street that the city let us put up. That helps keep the drug dealers 
out. Neighborhoods like this have to stand up for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Some of those who spent $12 each to visit McCurnin's home and 10 other 
carefully restored residences in the area said they admire that kind of 
determination. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I thought he was crazy to move here" said Tom Shuck, a co-worker who 
lives in Agoura Hills. "He's got a lot or courage. What he has done here is 
unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Said Manhattan Beach resident Kathi Boone: "It's unbelievable the amount of 
work that has to be done on a restoration. I think anyone who undertakes it has 
to have a lot of guts." 
</P>
<P>
Lauren Schlau, president of the West Adams Historical Assn., said profits from 
the tour -- which continues today near the intersection of 27th Street and Van 
Buren Place -- will be used to expand the cleanup of the 12-square-mile 
district. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time someone starts painting their house and planting their garden, 
others around them do too," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
That's community pride, not gentrification, Schlau said.

NO QUICK END LIKELY FOR U.S. PROBE OF BRADLEY; 
</P>
<P>
MAYOR: FINANCIAL RECORDS SUBPOENAED BY A FEDERAL GRAND JURY COVER ALL OF HIS 
CONTROVERSIAL DEALINGS IN RECENT YEARS AND THE INVESTIGATION COULD TAKE MONTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM OVEREND and HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal investigation into Mayor Tom Bradley's financial dealings could 
continue for six months or longer before a decision is made on whether to 
charge him with any criminal misconduct, a government official familiar with 
the probe has told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the pace of the investigation is accelerated because of pleas from 
Bradley and his lawyers to conclude it as quickly as possible, the federal 
official said it is doubtful that investigators can finish their work until 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
That rough timetable comes as investigators are just beginning what is expected 
to be a lengthy examination of financial records detailing Bradley's business 
ties to eight banks and savings and loan associations, and brokerage firms. 
</P>
<P>
The financial records -- subpoenaed last month by a federal grand jury as part 
of an investigation by the U.S. attorney's office and the Justice Department -- 
cover all of Bradley's controversial dealings in recent years, from serving as 
an adviser to a bank doing business with the city, to his relationship with 
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., a brokerage firm that sold him junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
While the grand jury probe of Bradley has been surrounded by an unusual degree 
of secrecy from most government officials, sources said one major focus of the 
investigation is to determine whether Bradley's substantial stock and bond 
purchases may have violated federal insider trading laws. 
</P>
<P>
The wide-ranging sweep of last month's subpoenas, however, has made it clear 
that federal officials are not limiting their investigation to possible insider 
trading violations, but also are exploring whether Bradley may have violated 
other federal laws specifically aimed at political corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Under scrutiny in the continuing probe are Bradley's service as an 
$18,000-a-year adviser to Far East National Bank in 1988 and his appointment to 
the board of directors of Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan, as well as his 
relationships with Abraham Spiegel, chairman of Colombia Savings &amp; Loan 
Assn., and investment broker Ira Distenfield. 
</P>
<P>
The federal investigation of Bradley, which began last spring, showed little 
movement until the completion last month of an investigation by City Atty. 
James K. Hahn. The city probe concluded there was insufficient evidence to 
prosecute Bradley on any state conflict-of-interest charges. 
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities have since emphasized moving forward with their own 
investigation. The Times was told last week by a federal source that FBI 
officials in Washington had urged their counterparts in Los Angeles to speed up 
the probe because of Bradley's position as mayor of one of the nation's largest 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
Dismissing the issuance of grand jury subpoenaes as a "routine step" and 
proclaiming his innocence of any wrongdoing, Bradley called on federal 
officials earlier this month to conclude the investigation as "expeditiously as 
possible" to prevent any further damage to his reputation. His lawyers made a 
similar plea, citing the city's need to "put this behind the mayor." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Stephen D. Miller, representing Bradley in the federal probe, declined 
comment last week on the predictions that the grand jury investigation could 
last much longer than Bradley had hoped. Miller also has strongly urged a quick 
conclusion of the investigation, expressing confidence that Bradley eventually 
will be cleared of any criminal misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury used by the U.S. attorney's office in gathering records relating 
to Bradley is also investigating the financial dealings of former House 
Majority Whip Tony Coelho (D-Merced), The Times has learned. Both 
investigations are being supervised by the U.S. attorney's office and the 
Justice Department's Public Integrity Section. 
</P>
<P>
While the use of grand juries to obtain indictments is constitutionally 
required in all federal felony cases, ex-prosecutors said grand juries 
themselves are little more than a tool for federal prosecutors in subpoenaing 
documents and compelling witnesses to testify. U.S. officials said it is rare 
for a grand jury to contradict a prosecutor on whether to indict. 
</P>
<P>
In the Bradley investigation, according to several leading former prosecutors 
and defense lawyers interviewed by The Times, one of the biggest obstacles 
confronting the federal government in the investigation will be establishing 
whether Bradley had any criminal intent or knowledge of criminality to violate 
securities statutes or any other federal laws. 
</P>
<P>
One area of investigation, for example, is Bradley's trading in high-yield 
bonds through Drexel Burnham Lambert. While the government is seeking to 
determine if there is any pattern of insider knowledge to Bradley's dealings, 
lawyers familiar with such investigations say proof may be difficult to obtain 
and that such investigations frequently do not lead to indictments. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from possible securities trading violations, the government, sources 
said, is reviewing the gamut of Bradley's financial dealings to ascertain if 
any other federal laws have been violated. 
</P>
<P>
"I get the feeling that they are going slow because they want to look at 
everything," one source familiar with the case told The Times. "That way, if 
they do close it out eventually without indicting, they won't be accused of 
having overlooked any possibility." 
</P>
<P>
Legal experts say prosecutors in previous political corruption cases have 
relied on relatively few federal laws, among them the Hobbs Act, the mail fraud 
statutes and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. 
</P>
<P>
G. Robert Blakey, a University of Notre Dame law professor who helped write the 
RICO Act, said it has been used to prosecute corrupted officials when the 
government can establish a "pattern of racketeering" based on at least two 
criminal acts. But Blakey stressed that there has to be proof of criminal 
intent. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that protects an honest public official is that he has to act in bad 
faith to be indicted," Blakey said. "Using bad judgement is not enough." 
</P>
<P>
Some prominent Los Angeles lawyers, who asked not to be identified, said that 
among Bradley's financial activities, those most likely to raise questions -- 
particularly of personal judgement -- involve the mayor's work as an adviser to 
Far East National Bank in 1988 and his possible links to a $2-million deposit 
of city funds with the bank early this year. 
</P>
<P>
The same lawyers, however, said they are not sure if there are any applicable 
federal laws covering the Far East situation other than the Hobbs Act, which 
was enacted to combat flagrant extortion by corrupt unions. It was successfully 
used in 1969 to convict Newark Mayor Hugh Addonizio in an extortion plot 
involving kickbacks from a contracting firm. 
</P>
<P>
The Hobbs Act states that the term "extortion" means the obtaining of property 
from someone by "actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color 
of official right." 
</P>
<P>
That definition would appear to limit the law's applicability in the Bradley 
case. But Blakey said a series of cases have established that a public official 
can be guilty of extortion if he takes money from someone even though no 
threats have been made. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Far East National Bank, City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg 
deposited $2 million of city funds in the bank, without competitive bidding, 
after receiving a telephone call from Bradley. Although Bradley was a paid 
adviser to the bank at the time, both he and Rittenberg have denied that the 
mayor attempted to influence the investment decision. 
</P>
<P>
The federal laws most commonly used to prosecute political corruption cases 
have been the mail fraud statutes. A 1987 Supreme Court decision, however, 
struck down the law's use in political corruption cases. A law passed last year 
by Congress to reinstate the mail fraud statutes cannot be used to prosecute 
acts that occurred before Nov. 18, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said he terminated his relationship with Far East on Dec. 31, 1988, but 
did not return the $18,000 he had been paid by the bank until March 23 of this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Former Chief U.S. Atty. Richard E. Drooyan, who successfully prosecuted Orange 
County businessman W. Patrick Moriarty and a dozen political and business 
figures in one of California's major political corruption scandals, relied 
heavily on mail fraud statutes at the time. But he expressed doubt that they or 
other statutes would be useful in the Bradley case. 
</P>
<P>
Drooyan said that federal courts have interpreted the Hobbs Act to encompass 
the bribery of a public official as well as extortion. But he noted that a 1988 
decision by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals raised the standard of proof 
required to show the public figure offered some inducements to obtain a bribe. 
</P>
<P>
In view of that decision, Drooyan, who is now in private practice, said: 
</P>
<P>
"I would be less confident of using the Hobbs Act to prosecute public 
corruption in California now. . . . Using the federal statutes, I think it is 
extremely difficult to prosecute public corruption in California, which is not 
under-the-table cash bribery, which you have in Chicago or other Eastern 
cities."

JIM MURRAY: A FEW REASONS WHY THE SERIES SHOULD GO ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY

<TEXT>
<P>
In the 1964 Indianapolis 500 auto race, a rookie driver, Dave MacDonald, 
skidded into the most terrible accident ever visited on the Speedway. He 
crashed into the inside wall on Turn 4 of Lap 1 and exploded into flames, which 
also engulfed the car of veteran Eddie Sachs. Sachs was incinerated. So was 
MacDonald. So were seven other cars that were wiped out in the holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
And they stopped the race. For 1 hour 42 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the race had been stopped. When I asked a race reporter 
there why they were restarting it, she looked startled. "Why not?" she 
responded. "The track's been cleaned." 
</P>
<P>
In 1972 during the Munich Olympics, a hit squad of assassins broke into the 
Olympic Village, murdered a wrestling coach and took 11 Israeli athletes 
hostage. By nightfall, they were all killed in an airport shootout along with 
five Arab terrorists and a West German policeman. 
</P>
<P>
And they delayed the Games a day. 
</P>
<P>
History does not record whether there was any period of mourning for the 
Christians eaten by the lions, but you have to remember the lions were the home 
team, the sentimental favorites. 
</P>
<P>
World War II was not enough to darken the ballparks or interrupt the games 
people play. The Rose Bowl moved to Durham, N.C., to make it hard on the 
Japanese pilots, but it soon came back and by 1945, even though there was still 
a war going on, it was restored as an intersectional rivalry (USC vs. 
Tennessee). 
</P>
<P>
President Franklin Roosevelt himself decreed that major league baseball should 
keep open in war. It was important to national morale, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Super Bowl XXIII was played in Miami in the midst of a full-scale 
municipal riot. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the instances above, the disaster was caused by the sport itself. In 
1972, the Games were the target of the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
It is therefore somewhat difficult to comprehend why there is any orchestrated 
opposition to the continuation of the 1989 World Series at all or, at least, in 
the city where it was interrupted. San Francisco, so the reasoning goes, has 
disqualified itself. It's hard to figure why. It didn't start the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
In 1906, almost the second thing the city of San Francisco did was bid for a 
World's Fair. The city fathers thought their town needed a diversion, a quick 
new image. They got one nine years later, an audacious undertaking for a town 
that had been all but wiped off the map a short time before. 
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 people were killed in the earthquake of 1906. Far fewer perished in 
the one of '89. More than 28,000 buildings were destroyed in '06. Within three 
years, they were replaced. The argument is advanced that it is unfair to San 
Francisco to call upon it to play host to a World Series in the midst of a 
terrible eruption. 
</P>
<P>
It would seem that the opposite is true. San Francisco needs immediately to 
reassure itself -- and the rest of the world -- that it is still here and here 
to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Would it help San Francisco if its World Series were moved to Kansas City or 
Chicago? How? 
</P>
<P>
Look at it this way: Do you know of a community more in need of a dollar influx 
right now than the Bay Area? 
</P>
<P>
The World Series should be kept there if it has to be played in a tent. 
</P>
<P>
You see, you can't bid on a World Series. If you want to minister to municipal 
esteem, you can lobby for a World's Fair (or even an Olympic Games or a Super 
Bowl). You can't buy a World Series. You make the World Series the old- 
fashioned way. You earn it. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco gets in one only every 27 years. And some people want them to 
pass on it. Throw it back. 
</P>
<P>
The cynics say greed is motivating the powers into a business-as-usual policy: 
The show must go on because the tickets and the sponsorships are sold. I don't 
buy it. In the first place, the clubs do not share in the revenues until the 
Series goes more than four games. This one may not make it. 
</P>
<P>
The players' share can be in the $80,000 range. But this is pocket money to the 
stars making upward of $1.5 million to $2 million. It's not even another 
Porsche. 
</P>
<P>
ABC? The network gets the World Series wherever it is played. And if it is not 
played, it doesn't just go to black. It puts on movies. Soap operas. It 
survives. 
</P>
<P>
No, San Francisco needs a World Series more than a World Series needs it. It 
needs to erase that image of swaying stands and screaming people and the 
endless backdrops of that flattened elevated freeway. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a nice gesture if baseball could find a way for the Series to 
contribute to earthquake relief, as players from both teams have already 
promised to do. But just by being there, the Series does contribute. A World 
Series is a bonanza for hostelries, restaurants, even tourist haunts, taxis, 
limos, department stores and souvenir shops. You don't let loose of a World 
Series. San Francisco is crippled but not prostrate. No need to take it out of 
the lineup just yet. 
</P>
<P>
World Series have been played through two World Wars, floods, financial panics, 
street riots. They didn't even stop one that was fixed. The last time it was 
played in San Francisco, it rained for five days in a row. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco can cope. It can handle anything but for you to call it 'Frisco. 
That makes it want to sit down and have a good cry.

BRUINS GO FROM BAD TO WORSE; 
</P>
<P>
UCLA: IT FAILS TO CONTAIN OREGON STATE'S RUNNING ATTACK IN 18-17 DEFEAT.

<TEXT>
<P>
Before its exuberant fans tore down the goalposts Saturday, Oregon State 
stripped away a little bit more of UCLA's prestige. 
</P>
<P>
The Beavers all but eliminated the Bruins from the Rose Bowl race, rallying for 
an 18-17 victory in front of a rain-soaked crowd of 21,510 at Parker Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
After its second consecutive loss dropped UCLA to 3-4 overall and 2-2 in the 
Pacific 10 Conference, Coach Terry Donahue said that the Bruins were "obviously 
in a rebuilding-type process." 
</P>
<P>
Wasn't it only a year ago that UCLA was ranked No. 1? 
</P>
<P>
"We did not expect to be 3-4," Donahue said. "Obviously, the players and 
coaches and myself are really disappointed with our record and our performance 
to date. Right now, our season's not good." 
</P>
<P>
It got a lot worse with 1 minute 20 seconds left Saturday, when sophomore guard 
Scott Spalding was called for holding as the Bruins attempted to position 
Alfredo Velasco for a game-winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, which trailed throughout the game, rallied behind reserve quarterback Jim 
Bonds to open a 17-10 lead with 7:47 left, only to have Oregon State drive down 
the field to score and make it 18-17. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds rallied the Bruins again, moving them to the Beavers' 28-yard line, where 
tailback Kevin Williams gained two yards through the middle. 
</P>
<P>
But, instead of facing third-and-four at that point, UCLA faced second-and-16 
because Spalding was called for holding. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a couple of chances there to overcome the call and to do it anyway, but 
we were unable to do it," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds overthrew tight end Randy Austin on second down, then was belted by 
defensive end Pellom McDaniels and cornerback Torey Overstreet on third down. 
The ball fell harmlessly to the ground, an incomplete pass. 
</P>
<P>
Velasco was called upon for a 55-yard field-goal attempt, which fell short of 
the soon-to-be uprooted south goalpost. 
</P>
<P>
"The (holding) penalty was the whole ballgame," Oregon State Coach Dave 
Kragthorpe said. "Without it, he makes the kick." 
</P>
<P>
Spalding, fighting back tears, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
The call "influenced the game dramatically," said Donahue, who seemed to 
question the timing of it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's holding that goes on every single play," said Donahue, a former Bruin 
defensive lineman. "If you get too sloppy with your hands and too free with 
your hands, they're going to call it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm assuming he got too sloppy or free with his hands." 
</P>
<P>
If the officials hadn't made the call, Donahue said, "we'd be talking about a 
hell of a UCLA comeback." 
</P>
<P>
Forgotten, perhaps, would be Oregon State's surprisingly easy drive to the 
game-winning points. 
</P>
<P>
A fumble by quarterback Matt Booher, who had the ball knocked out of his hands 
by linebacker Craig Davis, set up a 19-yard drive by UCLA that resulted in a 
two-yard touchdown run by Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Williams swept around the left end and trotted into the end zone after a block 
by fullback Mark Estwick cut down linebacker Todd McKinney, who was knocked 
head over heels and had to be helped off the field. 
</P>
<P>
Ahead at that point, 15-10, the Bruins went for two points and Bonds rifled a 
pass to tight end Corwin Anthony in the right corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
But, as has been the case so often this season, the Bruins were not up to the 
task that awaited them in the game's most crucial moments. 
</P>
<P>
Booher, who completed 13 of 24 passes for 145 yards and directed an offense 
that generated 284 total yards to UCLA's 266, was perfect on his last five 
passes, including a 16-yard pass to Jason Kent on third-and-eight at Oregon 
State's 35-yard line, which got the winning drive moving. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA blitzed when the Beavers faced second-and-seven at the Bruins' 24, but 
Oregon State picked it up and Kent, facing man-to-man coverage, worked himself 
free behind cornerback Carlton Gray and Booher found him. 
</P>
<P>
"He just beat me," Gray said of Kent. "There's really no excuse. Sometimes it 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
The 23-yard pass put the Beavers at the one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Chaffey, who ran for a career-high 118 yards and two touchdowns in 27 
carries, scored on the next play to make it 17-16. 
</P>
<P>
"They went right through us and I can't tell you why," Donahue said of the 
Beavers' 67-yard game-winning drive. "It's kind of the nature of our football 
team this year. 
</P>
<P>
"When we've had to play great defense to stop them, we've been unable to, and 
when we've had to play great offense to score, we've been unable to." 
</P>
<P>
The worst, though, was yet to come for the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
On the two-point conversion attempt that followed, Reggie Pitchford drifted out 
of the backfield and no Bruin defender picked him up. 
</P>
<P>
Booher lofted the ball to him in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State aligned two wideouts to the left and they slanted inside, clearing 
the left flat for Pitchford. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't get lined up in time," Donahue said. "It looked like our defensive 
backs were just really slow getting lined up on the overloaded play and we 
never got it covered properly. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy was so wide open, it was a joke." 
</P>
<P>
It was no joke that, when the gun sounded 3 1/2 minutes later, Oregon State had 
improved to 3-3-1, its best record at this stage of the season since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider this the greatest win since I've been at OSU," said Kragthorpe, who 
arrived from Idaho State in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The game began under dark skies and in a heavy downpour and Oregon State took 
advantage of the first of four first-quarter turnovers, opening an early 7-0 
lead after nose tackle Esera Tuaolo ripped through the Bruin line and knocked 
the ball loose from quarterback Bret Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive tackle Mike Maggiore recovered at UCLA's 18-yard line and, two plays 
later, Chaffey scored his first touchdown on a 10-yard run, bursting through 
the right side and veering toward the outside. 
</P>
<P>
Velasco was wide to the right on a 40-yard field-goal attempt midway through 
the quarter, but a fumble recovery by Dion Lambert, who fell on the ball after 
Davis jarred it loose from tailback Jerrell Waddell, set up a 26-yard field 
goal by UCLA's senior kicker only a few minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA produced only another field goal through the first 30 minutes and, with 
the Bruins trailing at halftime, 10-6, Donahue lifted Johnson, who completed 
only four of 15 pass attempts, in favor of Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were a better team in the second half with Jim Bonds at 
quarterback," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds completed seven of 14 passes for 99 yards and, in the Bruins' first 
possession of the second half, drove them to another field goal. Velasco's 
20-yard kick with 9:18 left in the third quarter cut UCLA's deficit to 10-9. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end, Bonds positioned the Bruins to win, completing a 28-yard pass 
to Reggie Moore, an 18-yard pass to Mike Farr and driving UCLA to within 26 
yards of the Oregon State goal line. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in field-goal position," Bonds said of the Bruins' last possession. 
"We were just trying to get the ball to the middle and, hopefully, bust through 
and get a touchdown out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Or, at worst, a reasonable game-winning try by Velasco. 
</P>
<P>
But the holding call against Spalding, Bonds said wistfully, "forced us to 
throw when we already had three points on the board." 
</P>
<P>
Or thought they did, anyway.

WOOLRIDGE IS HAPPY DESPITE INJURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Optimism radiates from Laker forward Orlando Woolridge, despite the fact that 
his right knee still is swollen four days after arthroscopic surgery to remove 
bone fragments. 
</P>
<P>
Woolridge said he is not concerned that he has missed nearly all of training 
camp because of his knee problem and that he probably will begin the National 
Basketball Assn. regular season on the injured list. 
</P>
<P>
His mood can be attributed to the fact that the arthroscopic procedure could 
have detected serious cartilage damage and that, if this had been last season, 
his spot in Coach Pat Riley's substitution pattern would have been in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to look at any situation, whether negative or positive, and see what I 
can learn from it," said Woolridge, who watched from the bench as the Lakers 
beat the Philadelphia 76ers, 114-102, Saturday night at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to dwell on the negativity of things, and that's what I'm trying 
to do with this situation." 
</P>
<P>
Woolridge's attitude was shaped last season, when he languished on the bench 
until getting a chance in the playoffs. He came into training camp happy that 
Riley had decided to play him almost exclusively at small forward, rather than 
at power forward. 
</P>
<P>
But Woolridge's training camp was aborted almost before it began. What he 
thought was only the "normal" training camp knee soreness turned into a serious 
condition, in which fluid had to be twice drained from the knee. Swelling 
persisted, however, and surgery was required. He will be examined by Dr. 
Stephen Lombardo again Monday and probably will begin rehabilitation after 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"It would come and leave in previous years, but I guess this time my knee said, 
'That's enough,' " Woolridge said. "I didn't want to have surgery -- nobody 
does -- but I'm happy because the doctors said there is nothing structurally 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Only once in his nine-season career has Woolridge had to rehabilitate an 
injury, and he is not dreading the task this time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm actually looking forward to it," Woolridge said. "I don't want to rush it, 
but I'll work as hard as I can rehabing it, so when I come back, I'll be back. 
I've got to get the leg strong again, because atrophy sets in. Whatever is 
asked of me to do, I'll gladly do it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's going to be that long. Once you've played the game as long 
as I have, you have a natural rhythm and you just jump back in." 
</P>
<P>
Even if Woolridge's knee regains strength in three weeks -- the minimum goal 
doctors have set for his return -- it surely will take him more to be in proper 
playing shape. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, who play the Cleveland Cavaliers tonight at 7:30 at the Forum in 
the championship game of this exhibition tournament, are 7-0 in the exhibition 
season and have yet to be challenged. Coach Pat Riley said he is pleased by the 
play of his first seven players, including new backup point guard Larry Drew, 
but sees a drop-off in effort and performance by other Laker reserves. "They 
are playing very hard, and you're looking at six guys who know how to play 
together," Riley said after the 12-point victory over the 76ers. "Larry is 
playing well with them, but we have to get our second unit to play as hard as 
the first." . . . Magic Johnson looked in regular-season form, scoring 24 
points and passing for 11 assists. James Worthy had 16 points and 12 rebounds, 
and Byron Scott had 18 points. Mike Gminski had 17 points and 11 rebounds for 
the 76ers.

KINGS RALLY IN THIRD TO BEAT BLUES, 6-4 
</P>

<P>
Wayne Gretzky was too sick for the warmup skate. He was so weak from the flu 
that he had to skate short shifts throughout the game. After the game, his 
laryngitis was so bad he could barely croak out the admission, between coughs, 
that the last few weeks have left him run down. 
</P>
<P>
Still he somehow managed to score the Kings' final goal in a 6-4 victory over 
the St. Louis Blues Saturday night in front of 17,204. 
</P>
<P>
For the first few weeks of the season, all of the Kings were caught up in the 
excitement of Gretzky's pursuit of the National Hockey League's scoring record. 
Gretzky himself was overwhelmed -- by the games, the entourage, the media, the 
extra appearances . . . 
</P>
<P>
"That was a big part of it," Gretzky whispered. "It's been a tough week for me. 
We've played a lot of hockey games. I've had a lot of family and friends 
around. I probably ran myself into the ground." 
</P>
<P>
So why did he play? 
</P>
<P>
Jim Fox said it best: "Wayne Gretzky at 50% is better than most players at 
100%. His being on the ice gets the other team stepping back. I think whether 
you're too sick to play depends a lot on how valuable you are." 
</P>
<P>
Fox was valuable himself, getting the eventual winning goal -- his first in 
this comeback season -- as the Kings came on strong in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Fox gave a lot of credit for the goal, and the big comeback, to defenseman Tom 
Laidlaw. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings were down, 3-2, after the second period. And Laidlaw didn't like what 
he was seeing. So between periods, he spoke up. 
</P>
<P>
Laidlaw said: "I just said that, as a team, we have a great opportunity here. 
The organization, the coaches, the general manager, have brought together a lot 
of talent, and I felt like we were wasting it away . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like we weren't working together. . . . Like we were waiting around 
for playoff time. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of expectations for this team, and it seemed like we were 
waiting for it to happen. We needed to make it happen." 
</P>
<P>
When the gate opened, Bernie Nicholls came out and tied the score, 3-3, only 1 
minute 1 second into the third period. He carried the puck into the Blues' zone 
to beat goalie Greg Millen at close range on the play. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls also assisted on the go-ahead goal three minutes later, giving John 
Tonelli a perfect pass from the right side to the spot on the left side where 
Tonelli could knock it in. 
</P>
<P>
Less than two minutes later, Fox scored what turned out to be the game-winner 
after Laidlaw sent the puck deep, giving Fox and Craig Duncanson a two-on-one 
break against defenseman Gordie Roberts. Fox scored on a sharp angle from the 
right as he skated past the net. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Hull's second goal of the night brought the Blues back to within a goal 
at 9:02. But Gretzky iced it for the Kings, waiting just to the right of the 
crease for a pass from defenseman Larry Robinson that he put past Millen. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big question before the game whether (Gretzky) was even going to 
play," King Coach Tom Webster said. "That's why I dressed an extra player." 
</P>
<P>
Jay Miller skated in warmups but was scratched when Gretzky decided he could 
go. 
</P>
<P>
"We went with four lines, and I think that helped us at the end," Webster said. 
"We have two games in two nights, and we had a few guys under the weather. 
</P>
<P>
"Bernie jumped forward when we needed him. It was great to see that. He picked 
up the whole hockey team. And Jim Fox. It was nice to get a contribution from 
everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Luc Robitaille had a goal for the Kings and John Tonelli had two goals after 
they switched lines -- Robitaille going with the checking line of Steve Kasper 
and Keith Crowder, and Tonelli going with Robitaille's regular line of Nicholls 
and Dave Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Tonelli's goal was scored with the Nicholls' line. Robitaille scored on the 
power play. All four of his goals this season have been on power play. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to change things around a little," Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings are 5-3 overall, 3-0 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky is expected to play at Chicago tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have the zip or the extra legs I would have if I felt good," Gretzky 
said. "I just have to play within the limits of what I can do. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody, over the course of 80 games, is going to play sick. That's 
professional hockey. I think I should play if I can. I think I give (my 
teammates) some room to work." 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Vincent Schoemehl proclaimed it Wayne Gretzky Day in St. Louis in honor 
of his recent breaking of Gordie Howe's scoring record. . . . Jim Fox, who sat 
out all last season after having surgery on both knees, scored his first goal 
Saturday night and said that he would give the puck to his therapists -- Clive 
Brewster and Judy Seto of the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopedic Clinic. . . . The Blues 
held Denis Savard, Mario Lemieux and Steve Yzerman scoreless in consecutive 
games this week. They came within 2 minutes 13 seconds of shutting out Gretzky. 
. . . King Coach Tom Webster was wearing his lucky purple socks Saturday night. 
The socks are 3-0. Asked why he hadn't worn them when the Kings lost to Boston 
Tuesday night, he said: "I wore my purple tie -- I've chucked that sucker."

RAIDERS TO GET DOSE OF REALITY TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reality check off the starboard bow. Undefeated Art Shell and the Raider era of 
good feeling sail into stormy seas today to see who they are in this latest 
incarnation. 
</P>
<P>
They are 6 1/2-point underdogs to the Philadelphia Eagles who are at once 
fearsome but beatable. 
</P>
<P>
If the Raiders are truly back, they could win this game and make a run in their 
division. If they don't have themselves together for Reggie White and that 
howling pass rush, they'll be leaving town with their smiles upside down and 
their quarterbacks bandaged. 
</P>
<P>
Great tests await: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Of the Raider offensive line. The Eagles have 26 sacks -- by comparison, 
the Raiders have 11 -- of which the awesome White has only 4 1/2. But don't 
waste time worrying about him. He's coming back after having been double-teamed 
and blanked in the first two games. White has an unheard of 1.2 sacks a game in 
his five-year career and almost single-handedly retired Henry Lawrence in the 
teams' last meeting in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
White trails teammates Clyde Simmons, who has 6 1/2 sacks, and Jerome Brown, 
three last week and six overall. Eagle Coach Buddy Ryan likes to blitz, too, so 
if you're going to worry about anyone, let it be Jay Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Of the offense, particularly Schroeder and the Raider passing game. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles will challenge and the Raider offensive unit will have the answer, 
or wish it did. 
</P>
<P>
The offense is coming off two sub-par performances, but in Mervyn Fernandez and 
Willie Gault, the Raiders have the kind of receivers that no one, but no one, 
should be able to cover man to man. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll come after you," Shell said. "Buddy believes in coming after you. He 
hasn't changed since he left Chicago (where Ryan built the great Bear Super 
Bowl defense) and he won't change. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to attack us. I know that and our team knows that. By challenging 
you, sometimes they leave themselves open. It's one of those things: 'I'm going 
to get to you before you get the ball off,' that type of thing. It's going to 
be a fun game. It really is. They're going to come out with all barrels firing. 
We're just going to have to take our time and do what we have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Of Bo Jackson. He had a vintage debut last week, but he's been at this 
point before, where he shows off a world of talent and then when it looks as if 
the world is spread out before him, and the Raiders will receive the benefits 
of his romp through it, he fades, or gets hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Having repeatedly passed tests of flash greatness, can he pass the test of 
consistency? 
</P>
<P>
Just how good are these Eagles, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
They have the dreaded Reggie, and Randall Cunningham, the new most- 
dangerous-quarterback-in-the-game, succeeding John Elway. They are defending 
NFC East champions and supposed Super Bowl contenders. They are No. 7 in total 
offense but, ominously, No. 25 in defense. 
</P>
<P>
If the officials hadn't let them get away with a forward lateral on a fumble 
recovery against the Washington Redskins, they would be an inglorious 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
How to describe them? 
</P>
<P>
Inconsistent? 
</P>
<P>
"We don't feel like we're inconsistent," said the courtly-in-victory Ryan, 
curtly. "I don't know what you're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, those skeptics. 
</P>
<P>
Take his own Eagle publicist, who said this in his press release: 
</P>
<P>
" . . . The running game has been inconsistent thus far. . . . The offensive 
line has allowed 16 sacks over the first six weeks of '89. . . . Although not 
piling up huge numbers in recent weeks, the Eagle wideouts have come up with 
key receptions. . . . After being the victims of several big plays through the 
first four weeks, the Eagles' secondary was able to contain the Giants' and 
Cardinals' receivers for the most part. . . . Randall Cunningham is off to a 
typical start in 1989: starting slow in games as a passer. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Buddy's right, inconsistent is the wrong word. 
</P>
<P>
Erratic, like their coach, is better. 
</P>
<P>
This is a club that can't run the ball, except when the quarterback doesn't 
hand the ball off. Cunningham, the No. 1 rusher, is also the only back with an 
average of better than 3.5 yards. He's at 5.6. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to establish the run, unsuccessfully, Ryan is slowing down his offense . 
. . and irritating his superstars? 
</P>
<P>
Both Cunningham and Mike Quick are chafing under the rein. Cunningham masks it 
with his stellar play late in games, but he's actually off to a quiet bad 
start, with 11 touchdown passes and nine interceptions. In the last two 
seasons, his totals were 47 and 28. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, he completed 10 of 24 passes against the Giants -- and won the 
game with a somersault into the end zone and two fourth-quarter scoring drives. 
Last week in Phoenix, he threw three first-half interceptions -- and two 
touchdown passes in the third quarter, bailing the Eagles out again. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham has also just lost his top receiver, Quick, to knee surgery. The man 
he went to in a similar emergency last season, tight end Keith Jackson, has had 
back problems. 
</P>
<P>
As always, or more than ever, the load descends upon Cunningham's shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
History: the Los Angeles Raiders have never played in Philadelphia. Their last 
meeting was in 1986, the game that started the Raider decline. The Raiders were 
8-4 and seemed a playoff lock. The Eagles were a shambles, en route to taking a 
record 104 sacks, but they beat the Raiders in overtime, when Andre Waters 
returned Marcus Allen's fumble 81 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders lost the rest of their games, missed the playoffs, went 5-10 in 
1987, saw Tom Flores leave, hired Mike Shanahan, went 7-9, started 1-3 and 
fired Shanahan. . . . Art Shell is hoping that center Don Mosebar, out except 
for one game with a knee injury, can make it back. Reggie White often lines up 
over center, and one of his favorite tricks is throwing the center at the 
quarterback.

<P>
Denver (5-1) at Seattle (3-3), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks will try to bring Denver back to the pack in the AFC West, and 
history gives Chuck Knox's squad a good chance. Seattle has won four of the 
last five games in the series, 21-14 and 42-14 last season, and the Broncos 
haven't won at the Kingdome since 1985. Bronco quarterback John Elway continues 
to struggle but has Mike Shanahan, late of the Raiders, back to help him figure 
things out. The Seahawks are 30-11 in the Kingdome in the last five seasons but 
are 0-2 this season. Seattle has not lost three straight at home since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
INTERCONFERENCE GAMES 
</P>
<P>
New England (2-4) at San Francisco (5-1), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana's passing arm is better and he's expected to be back at 
quarterback. Steve Young led the 49ers past Dallas last week. The Patriots are 
going with 36-year-old Steve Grogan at quarterback, since Doug Flutie struggled 
last week for the second consecutive game. San Francisco is undefeated on the 
road and lost its only home game to the Rams, but this game has been moved to 
Stanford Stadium because of earthquake damage at Candlestick Park. The 49ers 
have won only four of their last nine games at home, where they will play five 
of the next six. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas (0-6) at Kansas City (2-4), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Steve Walsh, the rookie out of Miami, gave the Cowboys reason to 
hope last week against San Francisco, but the yards are harder to come by 
against the Chiefs' outstanding secondary. However, with running back Darryl 
Clack replacing Herschel Walker, who was traded to Minnesota, the Dallas ground 
game was nonexistent. The Chiefs aren't fancy, relying on the running of 
Christian Okoye and a sound defense. The Cowboys' worst start was 0-10 in 1960, 
their first season, when they finished 0-11-1. 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay (3-3) at Miami (3-3), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the way Miami played earlier this season, the Dolphins' turnaround 
is probably a combination of another superb coaching job by Don Shula and the 
greatness of quarterback Dan Marino. Just when it seemed this might be Shula's 
worst team, the Dolphins beat Cleveland and Cincinnati. Miami also has its best 
defender, linebacker John Offerdahl, back after a long holdout. Quarterback Don 
Majkowski and the Green Bay offense were slowed by Minnesota last week, but 
still rank No. 2 in the NFL. Miami beat the Packers last season, 24-17. 
</P>
<P>
AFC GAMES 
</P>
<P>
Indianapolis (3-3) at Cincinnati (4-2), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts, their three-game winning streak snapped by Denver, need to have Eric 
Dickerson completely recovered from his hamstring injury or get Albert Bentley 
more involved to take the pressure off quarterback Jack Trudeau. If Chip Banks, 
the newly acquired linebacker, is in shape, he could be a big help to the Colt 
defense. Cincinnati hasn't been overpowering, barely getting past Cleveland, 
Kansas City and Pittsburgh. Despite the running of James Brooks, the Bengals 
aren't nearly as explosive as they were last season. 
</P>
<P>
New York Jets (1-5) at Buffalo (4-2), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills are hoping that Frank Reich is for real after beating the Rams Monday 
night, because Jim Kelly won't be back for a while. The Jets can't seem to 
decide on a quarterback, going with Kyle Mackey and Ken O'Brien in last week's 
loss to New Orleans. It hasn't helped that receivers Al Toon and Wesley Walker 
are out. Buffalo swept the Jets last season, 37-14 and 9-6 in overtime, but 
five of the last six games between these old AFL rivals have been decided by 
four points or fewer. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh (3-3) at Houston (3-3), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Houston may have finally gotten itself together when quarterback Warren Moon 
directed two touchdown drives in the final minutes last week at Chicago and the 
Oilers intercepted four passes. The Steelers have won three of four but didn't 
have much offense last week with quarterback Todd Blackledge replacing injured 
Bubby Brister. Houston has won three of the last four games with Pittsburgh, 
including a split last season, but Pittsburgh is 5-2 at the Astrodome since 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
NFC GAMES 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay (3-3) at Washington (3-3), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Buccaneers learned last week that they can't win without Vinny Testaverde, 
who is expected to start today, and that Joe Ferguson is too old for this game. 
The Redskins lead the NFL in total offense on the running of Gerald Riggs and 
the passing of Mark Rypien, but it wasn't enough to save their three-game 
winning streak last week against the Giants. Washington's three defeats have 
been by a total of 11 points, including two three-pointers against the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota (4-2) at Detroit (1-5), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Herschel Walker played against Green Bay two consecutive weeks, gaining 44 
yards for Dallas and 148 after his trade to Minnesota. Detroit has found that a 
healthy Rodney Peete makes a big difference in Mouse Davis' Silver Stretch 
offense. He passed for 268 yards and ran for 78 in a victory over Tampa Bay. 
Minnesota has won six in a row from the Lions, including a 24-17 victory two 
weeks ago, and five consecutive games in Michigan, but has lost four road games 
in a row dating to last season. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta (2-4) at Phoenix (2-4), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals were down to their third-string quarterback, Tom Tupa, when Gary 
Hogeboom missed last week's loss to Philadelphia with an elbow injury. Tupa had 
six passes intercepted and was sacked six times. Quarterback Chris Miller 
carries the Falcons and has had only two passes intercepted all season. Atlanta 
rookie Deion Sanders leads the NFC in punt returns, had a 60-yard kickoff 
return last week and is making himself at home in the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
MONDAY NIGHT 
</P>
<P>
Chicago (4-2) at Cleveland (3-3) 
</P>
<P>
TV: Channel 7, 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams have uncharacteristically lost two in a row, the Bears allowing 75 
points and the Browns scoring only 17. Bernie Kosar had his worst game as a pro 
last week against Pittsburgh and, surprisingly, there were cries in Cleveland 
for Mike Pagel. Chicago, which has never lost three straight with Mike Ditka as 
coach, also has had problems at quarterback lately, but Mike Tomczak -- despite 
four interceptions against Houston -- remains the starter ahead of Jim 
Harbaugh. Injuries to the defense -- Dan Hampton, Jim Morrissey -- have been 
the biggest problem.

BIG TEN ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
WITH TAYLOR BACK AT HELM, MICHIGAN DEFEATS IOWA, 26-12 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Taylor, playing for the first time since the season opener, passed for 
two touchdowns and ran for another to lead No. 5 Michigan to a 26-12 Big Ten 
victory over Iowa Saturday at Iowa City, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman quarterback Elvis Grbac led Michigan to four victories while Taylor 
was recovering from a back injury suffered in a Sept. 18 loss to Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
But Taylor started Saturday and made his presence felt, completing 11 of 15 
passes for 179 yards and keeping the Hawkeyes off balance with his quickness 
and running ability. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I did all right," said Taylor, who played the entire game. "I took 
what the defense gave me. Except for one bad pass and one bad read, I think I 
was able to take what they gave me and go from there." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who returned to practice two weeks ago, helped Michigan to its first 
victory at Iowa since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines improved to 5-1 overall and remained tied with Illinois for 
first place in the Big Ten at 3-0. Iowa is 3-3 and 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler said last week that Taylor probably would play 
Saturday, although it was thought that Grbac would start. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know whether Taylor would be ready or not," Schembechler said. 
"You've got to understand that Taylor had very little preseason practice. He 
played the Notre Dame game and was rusty and turned the ball over twice and had 
a bad arm, then got hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought at the end of the second week (of practice) if he had sufficiently 
developed, we wanted to play him. Frankly, I told him he'd start this morning." 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler said Taylor played well, but he would have felt comfortable with 
Grbac playing. 
</P>
<P>
"But the experience for Michael Taylor will pay off in the long run," he said, 
"if we can get him back to where he was before he got hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 9-6, at halftime, Michigan got touchdowns 3:24 apart in the third 
quarter. Taylor scored on a two-yard, fourth-down run with 5:49 left in the 
quarter to cap a 10-play, 63-yard drive. He flipped a screen pass that Tony 
Boles turned into a 45-yard touchdown play at the 2:25 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Boles weaved his way through the Iowa defense down the right side of the field 
and dragged safety Eddie Polly the final three yards into the end zone as the 
Wolverines moved ahead, 23-6. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa cut the deficit to 23-12 on Matt Rodgers' 18-yard pass to Peter Marciano. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan, which punted only once, then controlled the ball for more than six 
minutes before J.D. Carlson kicked a 22-yard field goal with 8:58 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State 21, Purdue 3 -- Carlos Snow rushed for 149 yards and two touchdowns 
as the Buckeyes beat the Boilermakers in an error-filled game at Columbus, 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Snow, a junior, carried 18 times and scored on touchdown runs of one yard and 
three yards as Ohio State improved to 4-2 and 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
The victory marked the first time Ohio State has won two games in a row in John 
Cooper's two seasons as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
The Boilermakers (1-5 and 0-3) had seven fumbles and lost one, while Ohio State 
fumbled three times and lost all of them. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 28, Minnesota 18 -- Anthony Thompson rushed for a career-high 216 yards 
and three touchdowns, moving within one touchdown of the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. career record, to lead the Hoosiers at Bloomington, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, the nation's rushing and scoring leader this season, had both of 
Indiana's first-half touchdowns and scored again on a 16-yard run with 29 
seconds to go. 
</P>
<P>
His 58 regular-season touchdowns is one short of the record set by Army's Glenn 
Davis in 1946 and tied by Pittsburgh's Tony Dorsett in 1976. Overall, including 
bowl games which are not counted in NCAA statistics, Thompson has 61 career 
touchdowns and a Big Ten record 370 points. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams are 4-2 and 2-1.

<P>
Wisconsin 35, Northwestern 31 -- Running back Leon Hunt rushed for a 
career-high 116 yards and scored three touchdowns as the Badgers held off a 
late charge by the Wildcats at Madison, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin is 2-4 and 1-2; Northwestern 0-6 and 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin quarterback Lionell Crawford, benched after the first two games this 
season, got the start and scored two touchdowns and rushed for 73 yards before 
hurting his knee late in the game.

IT'S A BIG VICTORY FOR ILLINOIS, BY GEORGE

Jeff George threw a nine-yard touchdown pass to Mike Ballamy with 1 minute 8 
seconds to play to give Illinois a 14-10 Big Ten victory over Michigan State 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw Jeff George take over," Illini Coach John Mackovic said. "I think he's 
shown he's one of those exceptional quarterbacks." 
</P>
<P>
The winning pass came after John Langeloh kicked a 21-yard field goal that put 
Michigan State ahead with 4:18 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans appeared to have the game wrapped up after stopping Illinois' next 
drive and forcing a punt. But on the first play after the punt, Highland 
Hickson fumbled, and defensive back Quintin Parker recovered, setting up the 
winning drive. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois went 35 yards in three plays, taking only 28 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough one to lose," Michigan State Coach George Perles said. "I guess 
you have to give them credit for not giving up and for causing a fumble and 
putting it in the end zone." 
</P>
<P>
Of the fumble, Perles said: "I would probably have to call the same play again. 
Obviously it was the turning point of the game." 
</P>
<P>
After the fumble, George completed two quick passes, one to running back Kameno 
Bell and one to tight end Jeff Finke, each for a gain of 13 yards, before 
finding Bellamy for the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
Langeloh kicked his field goal after Michigan State, which hadn't mounted much 
of an offense all day, moved 91 yards in 16 plays. 
</P>
<P>
Neither team was able to generate much of an offense, with stubborn defenses 
and offensive miscues combining to stop drives and force both sides into 
exchanging punts. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois is 5-1 overall and 3-0 in Big Ten play. Michigan is 2-4 and 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
On the game's first possession, Illinois went 75 yards in eight plays to score, 
with George rolling to the right and hitting tight end Dan Donovan from one 
yard away. 
</P>
<P>
The touchdown was set up by a 53-yard pass play from George to Bellamy on the 
second play of the game. With plenty of time to throw, George hit Bellamy over 
the middle, and Bellamy raced to the Michigan State 20 before being forced out 
of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State tied the score in the opening moments of the third quarter. 
Flanker Courtney Hawkins broke loose up the middle with the half's opening 
kickoff and ran 85 yards to the Illinois seven. Two plays later, tailback Tico 
Duckett scored from the one.

Senior tailback J.J. Flannigan, substituting for injured starter Eric Bieniemy, 
rushed for 178 yards in 10 carries and scored three touchdowns to lead 
third-ranked Colorado past Kansas, 49-17, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Darian Hagan added 118 yards rushing and two more touchdowns as the 
Buffaloes raised their Big Eight record to 3-0 and overall mark to 7-0 -- the 
first time a Colorado team has won its first seven games since 1937. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas, unable to score a touchdown until the fourth quarter, fell to 2-5 
overall and 0-3 in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Flannigan, getting his first start of the season because leading-rusher 
Bieniemy suffered a broken leg last week, had scoring runs of four, 41 and 64 
yards to give the Buffaloes a 42-3 lead early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Hagan put the Buffaloes ahead, 7-0, with a 13-yard run on Colorado's first 
possession, and Flannigan's second-effort from four yards made it 14-0 with 
5:44 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
After a Jayhawk fumble, Hagan and Flannigan combined on a 41-yard scoring play, 
with Flannigan taking Hagan's delayed pitchout at the 25-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas cut the deficit to 21-3 on the final play of the half when Brad Fleeman 
kicked a 42-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado then scored on three of its first four possessions of the second half, 
highlighted by Flannigan's 64-yarder late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas got two touchdowns in the final period, on two-yard runs by John Henry 
Johnson and Tony Sands.

Gerry Gdowski ran for a career-high 125 yards and threw for 170 Saturday as 
fourth-ranked Nebraska defeated Big Eight rival Oklahoma State for the 16th 
consecutive time, 48-23, at Stillwater, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
Gdowski scored one touchdown and threw two touchdown passes to split end Jon 
Bostick in compiling a career-high 295 yards of total offense. I-back Ken Clark 
rushed for 85 yards and two touchdowns as Nebraska improved to 7-0 overall, 3-0 
in the conference. Oklahoma State is 2-5 and 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma State trailed 20-16 early in the third quarter after Cary Blanchard 
kicked his third field goal, a 38-yarder. The Cowboys then held Nebraska and 
were driving again when Mike Gundy's pass was intercepted in the end zone by 
safety Reggie Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
Gundy became the Big Eight's career total-offense leader during the game, but 
midway through the third quarter he fumbled after being blind-sided by 
cornerback Bruce Pickens, who recovered at the Cowboys' 27. Gdowski then ran 
for 26 yards and scored from the one to give the Cornhuskers a 27-16 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska moved 62 yards in four plays on its next possession, which ended when 
Gdowski threw a 35-yard touchdown pass to Bostick. 
</P>
<P>
A 45-yard punt return by Tyrone Hughes gave Nebraska the ball at the Cowboys' 
25 on its next possession. Gdowski threw a 20-yard pass to Bostick to make it 
41-16. 
</P>
<P>
Gundy had 172 yards of offense, giving him 6,559 for his four-year career. That 
surpasses the record of 6,459 set by Phil Bradley of Missouri from 1977-80. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma State's Curtis Mayfield caught six passes for a school-record 208 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma 43, Iowa State 40 -- The Sooners' Eric Bross returned an on-side kick 
42 yards for a touchdown to end the Cyclones' upset bid at Ames, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Bross' run put the No. 25 Sooners ahead, 43-34, with 1:54 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa State quarterback Bret Oberg, who set a school record with 411 yards 
passing, then directed a six-play, 76-yard scoring drive, capped by a 46-yard 
touchdown pass to John Glotfelty. A two-point conversion attempt failed. 
</P>
<P>
Oberg, who broke the record of 346 yards set by David Archer against Nebraska 
in 1983, had cut the deficit to 36-34 with 1:57 to play with a five-yard 
touchdown pass to Glotfelty. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa State (3-4 and 1-2) had 609 yards in total offense, the most ever against 
an Oklahoma team; the Sooners (5-2 and 3-0) had 313. 
</P>
<P>
"Defensively, it was the worst performance we have had since I've been at 
Oklahoma," Sooner Coach Gary Gibbs said. "If we play like that next week, we'll 
get beat by 100 points by Colorado." 
</P>
<P>
Missouri 21, Kansas State 9 -- Michael Jones ran 67 yards for a fourth-quarter 
touchdown to stop a Wildcat rally as the Tigers ended a five-game losing streak 
at Manhattan, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
Ted LePage returned an interception 64 yards, and Kent Kiefer threw a 41-yard 
touchdown pass to Byron Chamberlain for Missouri (2-5 and 1-2). Kansas State is 
1-6 and 0-3.

Chris Gardocki kicked three field goals as Clemson upset No. 12 North Carolina 
State, 30-10, Saturday at Clemson, S.C., keeping alive its hopes of winning an 
unprecedented fourth consecutive Atlantic Coast Conference title. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers, 6-2 overall and 3-2 in the conference, defeated the Wolfpack for 
the first time since 1985. N.C. State is 6-1 and 4-1, falling into a 
first-place tie with Virginia, which defeated Wake Forest, 47-28, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson, which had lost its last two ACC games, grabbed a 17-0 halftime lead, 
holding N.C. State to a season-low 99 yards total offense. 
</P>
<P>
After the teams traded field goals in the third period, N.C. State cut the lead 
to 20-10 with 41 seconds left in the quarter on a five-yard run by Todd Varn. 
Shane Montgomery keyed the 77-yard, 12-play drive, hitting seven of nine passes 
for 69 yards. 
</P>
<P>
N.C. State drove to the Clemson 38-yard line on its next possession, but ACC 
interception leader Robert O'Neal picked off a pass from Montgomery to end the 
threat. It was the freshman's fifth interception. 
</P>
<P>
N.C. State turned the ball over again on its next possession. Linebacker Wayne 
Simmons stripped split end Chris Corders of the ball and then recovered the 
fumble at the N.C. State 12 to set up a 23-yard field goal by Gardocki with 
7:15 left. 
</P>
<P>
Duke 46, Maryland 25 -- The Blue Devils beat the Terrapins for the first time 
since 1972 when quarterback Billy Ray threw for three touchdowns and ran for 
another in an ACC game at College Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Clarkston Hines, Dave Colonna and Mark Hayes each caught touchdown passes, 
Randy Cuthbert ran for a touchdown and Wyatt Smith returned an interception for 
a touchdown as the Blue Devils snapped a 15-game losing streak to the 
Terrapins. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, which raised Duke's record to 4-3 overall and 2-1 in the 
conference, was the Blue Devils' first at Maryland's Byrd Stadium since 1960. 
</P>
<P>
The Terrapins fell to 2-6 and 1-4. 
</P>
<P>
Hines scored on a 19-yard pass to the left corner of the end zone from Ray 5:52 
into the first quarter for his ninth touchdown of the season, giving Duke a 7-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
The touchdown gives Hines 30 in his career, four shy of the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. record of 34 set by Elmo Wright from 1968-70. 
</P>
<P>
Hines' seven catches gave him 166 career receptions, breaking the ACC record of 
164 set by Wes Chesson of Duke. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech 17, North Carolina 14 -- Quarterback Shawn Jones ran 30 yards for 
a touchdown with 51 seconds remaining give the Yellow Jackets the victory at 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina's Clint Gwaltney attempted a 52-yard field goal as time ran, but 
it fell short. 
</P>
<P>
The victory extended Georgia Tech's ACC winning streak to three after the 
Yellow Jackets had dropped 16 league games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, a redshirt freshman who also scored on a five-yard broken play in the 
second period, guided the Yellow Jackets on a 60-yard, eight-play drive in the 
final two minutes to lift Georgia Tech (3-3 and 3-2). 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina (1-6 and 0-4), lost its sixth consecutive game and eighth in a 
row in the ACC. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech's Jerry Mays, the ACC's leading rusher, ran for 169 yards in 27 
carries, but the Yellow Jackets had to overcome four turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
East Carolina 14, Virginia Tech 10 -- Travis Hunter ran for one touchdown and 
passed for a tie-breaking touchdown in the second quarter as the Pirates held 
off two fourth-quarter threats by the Hokies for the victory at Greenville, 
S.C. 
</P>
<P>
A fumbled punt recovered by East Carolina with 4:16 left helped preserve the 
victory. East Carolina is 4-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Hokies (3-3-1) had two chances to score within a three-minute span. A 
50-yard run on a broken play by Vaughan Hebron to the East Carolina 25 led 
Virginia Tech down to the Pirate eight-yard line. But Hebron was stopped on 
fourth and one at the East Carolina five with 12:53 left. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina 24, West Carolina 3 -- Harold Green ran for 150 yards and a 
touchdown and Mike Dingle scored twice as the 24th-ranked Gamecocks won at 
Columbia, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
Dingle, who had 63 yards rushing, gave the Gamecocks (5-1-1) a 7-0 lead late in 
the second quarter. The Catamounts dropped to 3-3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia 47, Wake Forest 28 -- Shawn Moore, who entered the game as the NCAA's 
Division I-A passing efficiency leader, threw three touchdown passes and ran 
for a fourth as the Cavaliers won the ACC game at Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Moore completed 15 of 30 passes for 280 yards as Virginia, 6-2 overall and 4-1 
in the ACC, beat the Demon Deacons for the sixth consecutive time. Moore, a 
redshirt junior, also had two passes intercepted, both on deflected passes, and 
ran for 77 yards in 12 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Wake Forest is 1-5-1 and 1-3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Jake McInerney tied a Virginia record with four field goals. 
</P>
<P>
Southwestern Louisiana 24, Southern Mississippi 21 -- Mike Lemoine kicked a

Peter Gardere completed seven consecutive passes in two third-quarter scoring 
drives as Texas took over the Southwest Conference lead with a 24-20 victory 
over seventh-ranked Arkansas Saturday at Fayetteville, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
Gardere, a redshirt freshman who sparked an upset of Oklahoma last week, is 3-0 
as a starter. Texas is 4-2 overall and 3-0 in the conference. Arkansas is 5-1 
and 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Texas, trailing 14-13 at the half and facing a wind that gusted to 19 m.p.h., 
dominated the third quarter. During the period, the Longhorns held a 7-1 edge 
in first downs and outgained Arkansas, 130-26. 
</P>
<P>
Gardere completed four consecutive passes for 48 yards as the Longhorns took

</P>
<P>
Winfred Tubbs covered the final yard, and Chris Samuels scored on a two-point 
conversion that made it 21-14. 
</P>
<P>
The Longhorns started their next possession from their 39-yard line. Gardere 
completed passes of 17 and 18 yards to Tony Jones as the Longhorns reached the 
Arkansas 13. But Patrick Williams blitzed Gardere into an 11-yard loss, and the 
Longhorns settled for Wayne Clements' 42-yard field goal with 13:04 to play. 
</P>

Reserve quarterback Leon Clay threw two touchdown passes to freshman wide 
receiver Stephen Shipley, and the Texas Christian defense shut down Air Force 
quarterback Dee Dowis as the Horned Frogs upset the 19th-ranked Falcons, 27-9, 
Saturday in a non-conference game. 
</P>
<P>
"We now know we can play with the best of them," said TCU linebacker Jason 
Cauble. 
</P>
<P>
The Horned Frogs (4-3) held Dowis to 28 yards in eight carries. He completed 
five of 19 passes for 69 yards and one interception. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force Coach Fisher DeBerry was disappointed with the Falcons (6-2). 
</P>
<P>
"Our pride is tarnished and hurt, but I don't think the goals of our program 
have diminished," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an expensive way to learn a valuable lesson. This proves you have got 
to be ready to play every Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
Clay broke the game open with an 86-yard touchdown pass play to Shipley in the 
third period. He threw a 23-yard touchdown pass to Shipley in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I was in a dream running down the sideline," Shipley said of the 
second-longest pass play in TCU history. 
</P>
<P>
Clay completed 10 of 11 passes for 165 yards. He entered the game in the second 
quarter after starting quarterback Ron Jiles suffered a sprained wrist. 
</P>
<P>
"I was nervous," said Clay, a redshirt freshman. "I had big butterflies. I was 
just trying to keep our momentum going. This is Ron's team." 
</P>
<P>
Running back Tommy Palmer ran for a career-high 177 yards in 22 carries as the 
Horned Frogs pinned the Falcons with their second loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
TCU had two long drives on its first two possessions and took a 13-3 lead that 
stood until Clay threw his first touchdown pass to Shipley 6:46 into the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Jiles drove the Horned Frogs 87 yards in 10 plays and scored on a three-yard 
run to give TCU a 6-0 lead. Randle Bradley blocked the extra-point try. 
</P>
<P>
After a 27-yard field goal by the Falcons' Joe Wood, Palmer wrapped up a 
64-yard scoring drive with a one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons scored when Bill Wosilius slipped in from the two-yard line with 
1:31 remaining in the game.

A 53-yard run by Washington State's Steve Broussard may have been the game's 
big play -- for Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Broussard raced down the sideline on the first play of the second quarter after 
Alvin Dunn intercepted a George Malauulu pass. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive back Richard Holt dragged down Broussard 10 yards from the goal line 
and the Cougars had to settle for a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest key for the defense was stopping the run," Arizona Coach Dick 
Tomey said after No. 22 Arizona held off the No. 15 Cougars, 23-21, Saturday in 
a Pacific 10 Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
Washington State "did some damage late and had two key plays, but Richard Holt 
did an unbelievable job of running Steve Broussard down from behind." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona, 5-2 overall and 4-1 in the conference, kept its Rose Bowl hopes alive 
by holding the Cougars (6-2 and 3-2) to 67 yards rushing and intercepting four 
passes from Aaron Garcia, who was sacked six times. 
</P>
<P>
Darryl Lewis had two interceptions, and the second came with 1:37 left in the 
game after the Cougars had driven to a first down at the Arizona 27. Garcia was 
sacked the play before and hit by a blitz when he threw the interception on 
third and 20. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hammerschmidt's interception set up Doug Pfaff's third field goal, a 
28-yarder that put the Wildcats ahead 23-19 with 5:03 left. Washington State 
registered a safety with seven seconds remaining when Arizona punter John Nies 
ran out of the end zone.

<P>
John Brady of 7-Eleven sprinted away from a pack of riders Saturday to win the 
75-mile second stage of the Tour of Palm Springs bicycle race in 2 hours 45 
minutes 29 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Mike McCarthy of Celestial Seasonings was second and David Farmer of Team Crest 
was third. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Vonderahe of Team Montgomery, who was fourth, is the overall leader going 
into today's criterium finale. Norm Alvis of 7-Eleven is second and Scott 
Moninger of Team Crest is third. 
</P>
<P>
Brady, 24, of Dublin, credited teammate Alvis for helping him into position to 
win. A group of cyclists, fighting strong desert winds, were bunched through 
most of the race. Breakaways were short-lived, and leaders were quickly 
swallowed by the group. Brady, regarded as an excellent sprinter, followed 
Alvis through the pack, then sprinted about 50 yards from the finish. 
</P>
<P>
Brady finished second in road races in St. Louis and Ohio the last two 
weekends, but just ahead of Greg LeMond, last summer's winner of the Tour de 
France. LeMond was scheduled to race in Palm Springs, but canceled to remain 
with his wife in Minnesota, where she is expecting. 
</P>
<P>
Today's criterium begins at 11:45 a.m. in downtown Palm Springs. The final will 
be preceded by a women's race at 10 a.m.

<TEXT>
<P>
Tim Simpson capitalized on playing partner Donnie Hammond's bogey on the 18th 
hole Saturday for a one-shot victory in the Disney tournament at Lake Buena 
Vista, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond, seeking his second consecutive PGA Tour victory, hit his drive on the 
par-4 final hole behind a tree. He put his second shot into a bunker, chipped 
up 20 feet short of the pin and two-putted. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson, who saved his share of the lead with a 12-foot par putt on No. 17, 
tapped in for a par on the final hole for a two-under-par 70 and a 72-hole 
score of 272. Hammond had a 71 for 273. 
</P>
<P>
It was Simpson's second victory this year and he collected $144,000. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Azinger, who began the day four strokes back, made nine birdies on the 
first 12 holes to take a two-stroke lead at 17-under. 
</P>
<P>
But Azinger bogeyed three of the next four holes and finished with a 68 and a 
tie for third at 274 with Kenny Knox and Fred Couples, who each had 70s. 
</P>
<P>
Al Geiberger, Dave Hill, Charles Coody and Billy Casper shared the lead at 
five-under-par 139 after two rounds of the TransAmerica seniors tournament at 
Napa, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Ferree, who shot the day's low round of 68, and Bob Charles were one stroke 
behind at 140. 
</P>
<P>
Hill and Casper, playing in the same threesome, both eagled the par-5 18th hole 
to finish with rounds of 70. 
</P>
<P>
Geiberger shot a 69, and Coody matched par of 72.

<TEXT>
<P>
Third-seeded Aaron Krickstein outlasted top-seeded Stefan Edberg of Sweden, 
2-6, 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-3), in a 2 1/2-hour semifinal match of the Seiko 
tournament Saturday at Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg had a 5-2 lead in the third set before Krickstein took three consecutive 
games and eventually forced the tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not winning important points in the first set, and I was not aggressive 
enough at the beginning," Krickstein said. "When I get behind, I go for broke." 
</P>
<P>
Edberg, who has lost to Krickstein all three times they have met, said, "He is 
always very, very good against me." 
</P>
<P>
In today's final, Krickstein will meet fifth-seeded Carl-Uwe Steeb of West 
Germany, who beat Darren Cahill of Australia, 6-4, 6-4, in the other semifinal 
match. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Steffi Graf advanced to the final of the European Indoor with a 6-1, 
6-3 victory over third-seeded Helena Sukova of Czechoslovakia that took only 47 
minutes at Zurich, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
In the other semifinal, fifth-seeded Jana Novotna of Czechoslovakia downed 
Monica Seles of Yugoslavia, 7-6, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Revitalized Jimmy Connors defeated Gilad Blum of Israel, 2-6, 6-2, 6-1, at Tel 
Aviv to win the Riklis Grand Prix tournament, his second victory in as many 
weeks and the 109th of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Connors donated his $20,000 first prize to the Israeli Tennis Center.

ENVIRONMENT: A SCORE OF SOUTHLAND ENTREPRENEURS PIONEERED THE SCIENCE OF 
REDUCING AIR POLLUTION AT UTILITY AND INDUSTRIAL PLANTS AND HAVE BUILT THEIR 
EXPERTISE INTO THRIVING BUSINESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inside a nondescript office building in Irvine, Energy and Environmental 
Research Corp. engineers putter about a cavernous laboratory, fiddling with an 
angular, tube-filled, 10-foot-high plexiglass model. 
</P>
<P>
They watch closely as smoke- and helium-filled bubbles swirl through the 
structure, mimicking the behavior of gases inside a power-plant boiler and 
yielding valuable clues to the mysteries of pollution formation. 
</P>
<P>
Similar work is under way in office parks across Southern California. EER is 
one of a handful of small but highly regarded local firms that, together with 
major research programs at UC Irvine, make the area -- particularly Orange 
County -- a national center of expertise in certain air pollution control 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"These companies as a whole stand at the cutting edge of technology, not only 
nationally but internationally," said Scott Samuelsen, professor of mechanical 
and environmental engineering and director of the combustion laboratory at UCI. 
"In other places there's a lab or two or a company or two, but this is really 
unique." 
</P>
<P>
And for all of these enterprises -- whose expertise lies in reducing the 
quantities of smog-causing nitrogen oxides (NOx) produced by utilities, 
refineries, and factories -- business is booming as regulatory authorities 
adopt ever-more-stringent pollution restrictions. The new Air Quality 
Management Plan for Southern California means more work locally, and renewed 
concern about acid rain is bringing new business nationally. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMP rules are "having a very significant impact on our business, and the 
future impact will be even greater," said M. N. Mansour, founder and president 
of Applied Utility Systems Inc., a Santa Ana company that specializes in 
industrial applications of NOx-reduction methods. 
</P>
<P>
"Business certainly seems to be picking up," echoed Lawrence J. Muzio, 
co-founder of Fossil Energy Research Corp., a Laguna Hills firm involved in the 
development of basic anti-NOx technologies. "There's more interest in the 
environment, and we've profited from the new legislation." 
</P>
<P>
In certain respects, it is only natural that Southern California companies 
would be leaders in air pollution control. The area has the worst smog problem 
in the country, and local utilities -- including Southern California Edison 
Co., Southern California Gas Co., and the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power -- have long been leaders in finding ways to cut emissions from power 
plants, the biggest stationary sources of pollution. 
</P>
<P>
But to understand why Orange County, specifically, became the world center for 
NOx-control technology, one has to look at the history of two firms, Dynamic 
Science and KVB. Together, they gave birth to an alphabet soup of air pollution 
firms: EER, AUS, FERCO, Energy Systems Associates, Energy Technology 
Consultants, and Sierra Environmental Engineering. 
</P>
<P>
The story begins in the 1960s with the unlikely link between power plant 
emissions and the aerospace industry. A group of engineers working at Dynamic 
Science, a Marshall Industries subsidiary that had recently moved from Monrovia 
to Irvine, were using NASA computer models developed from research on 
vaporization to analyze combustion processes inside rocket engines. 
</P>
<P>
It became clear in the course of the research that the formation of nitrogen 
oxides was dependent on how quickly and at what temperature fuels were burned. 
Using the same computer models, the combustion process in a commercial boiler 
could be analyzed with an eye toward modifications that would reduce the 
amounts of these gases produced. 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time, Southern California Edison and the Los Angeles Air 
Pollution Control District -- the predecessor of the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District -- were zeroing in on the link, first discovered at 
CalTech, between nitrogen oxides and smog. 
</P>
<P>
NOx, which refers collectively to nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide, occurs 
naturally any time heated nitrogen and oxygen come in contact with one another 
-- in other words, any time there is a fire. When it is released into the air, 
it reacts with other elements and sunlight to form ozone, the main ingredient 
in photochemical smog. (Nitrogen dioxide also poses a health hazard in itself, 
and contributes to acid rain.) 
</P>
<P>
Dynamic Science researchers, including James R. Kliegel, Bernard P. Breen, 
Stephen Kerho and Nick Bayard de Volo, realized that they had found a useful 
commercial application for their work. "What we did was to understand that the 
production of nitric oxide in a utility flame could be lowered by two to three 
times without adding any equipment, and that was a very important thing for the 
utilities," recalled Kliegel. 
</P>
<P>
Kliegel, who was president of Dynamic Science, sought to arrange a buyout of 
the small division from Marshall Industries in 1970, in conjunction with 
employees and a company called Ultrasystems. The parent company's response was 
to fire him. 
</P>
<P>
So he and his colleagues started a firm called KVB. And the new company quickly 
emerged as the worldwide leader in NOx emissions control. 
</P>
<P>
"They were the original air pollution company in the L.A. basin, and perhaps 
the country, in terms of reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides, improving 
boiler efficiency, and developing the standard emissions monitor," noted George 
Offen, a scientist with the Palo Alto-based Electric Power Research Institute, 
an industry organization that has been an important source of funds for 
pollution researchers. 
</P>
<P>
The critical technologies included development of two-stage combustion 
processes and the use of exhaust gas recirculation to lower flame temperatures 
and thus reduce NOx formation. While many of the modifications were in 
themselves relatively simple, they required additional work to assure that 
boilers continued to operate safely and efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
A key stimulus to KVB's growth was a set of stringent emissions standards 
imposed by the Air Quality Management District in the early 1970s: The 
regulations virtually required operators of large boilers -- utilities, oil 
companies, and other big industrial firms -- to implement anti-NOx 
modifications. 
</P>
<P>
"They were very stringent rules, requiring a reduction of 80% in NOx 
emissions," recalled Bayard de Volo, who now heads Energy Technology 
Consultants in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Breen, the B in KVB and now president of Tustin-based ESA, tells with pride how 
KVB successfully modified the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power's 
Scattergood 3 unit to meet the requirements, thus saving the utility from 
abandoning a $100-million project. Breen said KVB technologies implemented in 
the 1970s reduced the production of NOx in the Los Angeles area by 300 tons to 
400 tons per day. 
</P>
<P>
At its peak, KVB employed 250 people and had a wide range of contracts from 
utilities, industry and public and private research organizations. But 
personality conflicts and the desire of some of the founders to get their money 
out put strains on the company, former KVB people said, and the firm was sold 
in 1978 for $7 million to New Jersey-based Research-Cottrell. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Dynamic Science was purchased by Ultrasystems, and later the 
combustion research branch was spun off and became EER. While KVB had focused 
on industrial applications of NOx-control technologies, EER kept its focus on 
basic research, thriving primarily on government- and industry-sponsored 
research and development projects, explained Blair A. Folsom, vice president at 
EER. 
</P>
<P>
The founders stayed with KVB immediately following the sale, but eventually a 
clash of cultures led to the departure of nearly all the executives and key 
engineers. By 1983, KVB was moving out of NOx-control engineering and into 
manufacturing emissions monitoring equipment, which is its primary business 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the air pollution control business as a whole was in a trough. The 
early years of the Ronald Reagan Administration, with its combination of 
recession and cuts in Environmental Protection Agency funds, were not a 
profitable time. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of this work was really phased out during the Reagan Administration," 
lamented Robert Hall, chief of the combustion research branch at the federal 
Environmental Protection Agency. "In the mid-1970s, the budget for NOx research 
was about $15 million -- now it's $300,000 to $500,000." 
</P>
<P>
But that didn't stop the KVB veterans from forming their own companies. In 
1981, Breen founded ESA, which now employs about 50 people divided between its 
Tustin headquarters and an office in Pittsburgh. In 1984, Mansour launched AUS 
-- which has grown to 15 people -- and Bayard de Volo started ETEC that same 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Also in 1984, Richard E. Thompson and Lawrence J. Muzio founded Fossil Energy 
Research, which -- like EER -- has more of a basic research and technology bent 
than do ESA or AUS, which focus on applied engineering. The next year, George 
L. Moilanen, a refugee of both KVB and ESA (he said he still owns a piece of 
the latter) founded Sierra Environmental Engineering, also an applied 
engineering firm. 
</P>
<P>
Some of companies struggled at first, but they are beginning to find their 
footing. "There was no work then," Moilanen said of the time when he started 
his company. "But it has come back even stronger than it was. This is the 
business of the 1990s in this basin." 
</P>
<P>
Samuelsen of UCI agreed that there was a plateau in the early 1980s. And while 
UCI maintained strong programs throughout the period, the university is now 
making further efforts to capitalize on its expertise with a new, 
interdepartmental center for combustion and propulsion science and technology. 
</P>
<P>
Contributors to the new center include the renowned atmospheric chemist F. 
Sherwood Rowland, who discovered the environmental damage caused by 
chlorofluorocarbons. 
</P>
<P>
And the town-and-gown links between UCI and local air pollution firms are 
growing as well. In the past several years, the university has teamed with 
local firms several times to bid on research contracts, Samuelsen said. An ESA 
official sits on the board of the combustion research lab, and Muzio of FERCO 
is an adjunct professor at the university. UCI engineering students often go to 
work for the local companies. 
</P>
<P>
The link with the university may become even more important for local industry 
in the future. Technologies for NOx reduction have in recent years moved beyond 
basic boiler modification to include more elaborate techniques, such as 
injecting ammonia or other compounds into boilers and exhaust gas streams to 
absorb NOx before it reaches the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"The easy stuff has been taken care of," said Anthony Occhionero, research 
manager at Southern California Gas. The new AQMP rules call for NOx emissions 
from 60 large boilers and 114 gas turbines in the South Coast area to be cut 
from 44.4 tons per day to 15 tons a day by the end of the decade, and meeting 
those standards will in some cases require far more sophisticated techniques 
than are commonly used today. 
</P>
<P>
That could be a mixed blessing for local companies. As pollution control 
becomes an ever more important consideration in the design and construction of 
boilers, the major manufacturers -- all located in the East -- are doing more 
of the emissions control engineering for both new and existing plants in-house 
rather than sub-contracting to specialized pollution engineering firms. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese companies, moreover, may have a competitive edge in extremely 
effective -- and very expensive -- technologies which fall under the umbrella 
of catalytic reduction. Some local air pollution engineers fear that the 
biggest boiler operators -- utilities and oil companies -- will be required to 
use the expensive Japanese technologies, and thus freeze out local firms. 
</P>
<P>
But Mansour, for one, observed that industrial firms that operate smaller 
boilers and face new but less severe restrictions will all be scrambling for 
technical assistance over the next several years. His company has formed a 
joint venture with a British firm to expand its capabilities. And the local air 
pollution control industry works for clients outside Southern California that 
can still benefit from the simpler NOx-reduction technologies. Nationally, a 
great deal of work today focuses on cutting the huge quantities of NOx produced 
by coal-burning power plants, which are virtually banned from the South Coast 
air basin. 
</P>
<P>
NOx accounts for about 30% of the acid rain problem, and utilities produce 30% 
of all NOx. Coal-burning power plants account for 75% of all utility-produced 
NOx, according to pollution studies. 
</P>
<P>
EER has contracts worth $30 million under the Department of Energy's huge clean 
coal technology program, and much of ESA's work is for coal-burning utilities 
in the Midwest. Both companies have major offices in the East and Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
Samuelsen suggested that local companies stand to gain from the national 
movement toward standards as strict as those which prevail in Southern 
California. "They are postured to respond to national needs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Orange County's NOx specialists maintain their edge in a growing 
business, however, don't look for them to build empires. Not only is the niche 
relatively small, but most of the founders consider themselves scientists or 
engineers first and entrepreneurs second. They would much rather talk about 
in-furnace sorbent injection then return on equity. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, the local firms are competitive. Brimming with professional pride, 
the owner/engineers say their neighbors really aren't doing the same type -- 
meaning the same quality -- of work that they are. 
</P>
<P>
But they cooperate a great deal, and form something of a club. Stephen Kerho, a 
KVB founder who lives in Mission Viejo and works with a Bay Area KVB spin-off 
called Electric Power Technologies, said the Environmental Protection Agency's 
biannual NOx conference "is like old home week." 
</P>
<P>
And in reflecting on the glory days of KVB, when an engineering fraternity ran 
its own, successful company and solved some important problems, many share 
George Moilanen's sentiment, almost unheard of among successful entrepreneurs: 
"I would have been just as happy to have worked the rest of my career and 
retired there."

ARE STOCKS FOR GAMBLERS ONLY?;

The 190-point slide in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday the 13th -- 
coming less than two years after the 1987 crash -- made many individual 
investors wonder again whether stocks are worth it. 
</P>
<P>
They see the market as too volatile and risky, a crap shoot primarily for 
gamblers and professional traders in which small investors don't get a fair 
shake. 
</P>
<P>
"The poor individual investor thinks there's no hope for him," says Peter 
Lynch, portfolio manager of the Fidelity Magellan mutual fund and one of the 
nation's most successful money managers. "These violent declines are terrible," 
because they make individual investors think that investing in stocks is like 
"owning a lottery ticket." 
</P>
<P>
Yet a close look at market trends reveals that although stock investing is 
indeed risky and no one knows for sure how well equities will do in the future, 
many fears of individual investors are largely unjustified.

<P>
Despite greater hour-to-hour price swings caused by computerized program 
trading, the market on a month-to-month basis has actually gotten less 
volatile, statistics show. Stocks -- although risky over short periods -- 
generally have continued to outperform other investments. 
</P>
<P>
And while individuals perceive that professionals have an advantage, most pros 
on average fail to beat the major market indexes. Small investors who simply 
buy and hold stocks often beat many pros. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, however, is that many small investors aren't disciplined. They 
invest emotionally, buying when stocks are expensive and selling when they are 
cheap -- just the opposite of prudent strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"People go in for the wrong reasons," says Kenneth L. Fisher, president of 
Fisher Investments, a Woodside, Calif., money management firm. 
</P>
<P>
Here are answers to many of the questions asked by individual investors about 
whether stocks make sense for them: 
</P>
<P>
Are stocks more volatile? 
</P>
<P>
Not really. People think that they're more volatile because daily point swings 
are greater and occur faster. Before October, 1987, the Dow Jones industrial 
average had never moved 100 points in a day, not to mention in an hour, which 
was the case again in the 190-point free fall earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
But looked at in percentage terms, the volatility story is mixed. 
</P>
<P>
True, minute by minute or hour by hour, the market is more volatile that it 
used to be, according to studies by Ibbotson Associates, an investment research 
firm in Chicago. (Ibbotson compares price movements of the Standard &amp; 
Poor's 500-stock index using statistical measures called standard deviations.) 
That is largely because of computerized trading programs, which allow big 
pension funds and other institutional investors to trade millions of dollars of 
stocks quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"Before computer trading, the market changed slowly, and minute-to-minute 
volatility was much less," says Larry Siegel, a managing director at Ibbotson. 
</P>
<P>
Measured day to day, however, volatility in recent years is only slightly above 
historic averages, Siegel says. Month to month, it is about the same -- except 
for October, 1987 -- and year to year, it has been less volatile in the 1980s 
than in any other decade of the 20th Century, he says. In effect, 
minute-to-minute or hour-to-hour moves cancel each other out, except in unusual 
situations such as that of October, 1987, and Friday the 13th, Siegel says. 
</P>
<P>
Using a different measure, volatility has actually declined this year. The 
average daily change in the Dow industrials has been only 0.61% so far this 
year, even including the 190-point plunge, says Norman Mains, director of 
research at Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, a Los Angeles brokerage. That 
compares to 0.76% in 1988 and 1.19% in 1987. The average for this century so 
far has been 0.71%, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Money manager Fisher adds that daily trading volume is much higher now than 
ever before. "It takes more trading to move the market than 15 years ago. So 
the market is not nearly as volatile as people think it is." 
</P>
<P>
Do professionals have 
</P>
<P>
unfair advantages? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, but managers of pension funds, mutual funds and insurance company 
portfolios have disadvantages, too. Sure, they hear about economic or company 
news first, watch their investments more closely and can more easily analyze 
company financial statements or technical stock data. 
</P>
<P>
But because of the millions of dollars that they must invest, they often lack 
flexibility. They often cannot buy or sell their entire holdings of one stock 
at once. And their transactions are so big that they run the risk of moving the 
prices of stocks that they buy or sell. 
</P>
<P>
Also, even with their ready access to information and other advantages, most 
professionals do not consistently beat market indexes such as the S&amp;P 500, 
says Spero Kripotos, executive vice president of CDA Investment Technologies, a 
Rockville, Md., firm that tracks money managers. When transaction costs, 
management fees and other expenses are added in, at least 60% of managers don't 
beat the market over a period of at least five years, he says. 
</P>
<P>
That is why more and more institutions and individuals are using index funds 
that simply buy all the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 or other indexes. "If you 
can't beat it, join it," Kripotos says. 
</P>
<P>
Do stocks outperform other investments? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, over the long run. Since 1926, stocks as measured by the S&amp;P 500 have 
gained an average of 6.7% per year, adjusted for inflation and including 
reinvested dividends as well as price appreciation, Ibbotson says. Riskier 
small-company stocks have gained even more: 8.9% per year. By contrast, 
long-term corporate bonds have gained only 1.9%; long-term government bonds, 
1.2%; five-year governments, 1.7%, and Treasury bills, 0.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Put another way, a dollar invested in 1926 in stocks would be worth $75.19 now, 
adjusted for inflation. That same dollar invested in small-company stocks would 
be worth $253.54. But in long-term corporate bonds, it would be worth only 
$3.50; in long-term government bonds, $2.38; in intermediate-term governments, 
$2.99, and in Treasury bills, $1.36. In residential real estate, it would have 
been worth $20.25 at the end of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks have outperformed all other investments during any 20-year period 
between 1926 and now, Ibbotson's Siegel says. 
</P>
<P>
But over shorter time periods, stocks are not always superior, he says. Over 
the decades of the 1970s and 1930s, for example, stocks actually lost money on 
average each year. On Oct. 19, 1987, the Dow fell 22.6%. Between September, 
1929, and July, 1932, the Dow lost a whopping 89%. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson: The longer you hold stocks, the greater the chance you have of 
earning superior returns. Over the long run, greater risk will be rewarded with 
greater returns. 
</P>
<P>
When do stocks perform best? 
</P>
<P>
The evidence shows that stocks generally like periods of low or decreasing 
interest rates. They also love a declining rate of inflation (although not 
deflation, as in the early 1930s). In times of inflation equities perform 
better when the inflation rate is low, rather than high. 
</P>
<P>
The proof: In the low-inflation 1950s and 1980s, stocks earned average annual 
returns (appreciation plus dividends) of 17.2% and 7.8%, respectively, Ibbotson 
says. But in the high-inflation 1970s, stocks fell an average of 0.4% per year. 
</P>
<P>
How can the small investor reduce risk in stocks? 
</P>
<P>
Several ways: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Take a long-term perspective and avoid emotions. Learn to accept short-term 
volatility as part of the territory. Realize that violent, hour-to-hour swings 
often cancel each other out in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
"Like the earthquake in San Francisco, individuals should stay indoors until 
it's over and not run out on the street and panic," says Sharon Gamsin, a 
spokeswoman for the New York Stock Exchange. "Those individuals who acted as 
investors rather than traders over the long run have done extremely well and 
often outperformed professionals." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't invest money you can't afford to lose. "If you need money next April 
15 to pay taxes, you shouldn't buy stocks with it," Ibbotson's Siegel says. 
Many advisers say the amateur investor should view stocks or stock mutual funds 
as at least a two-year commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Buy low, sell high. This is a basic principle of investing, but many don't 
follow it because it goes against their basic emotions. 
</P>
<P>
"When things look bleakest, you're supposed to be buying, and when it's good 
you're supposed to be selling," Fisher says. But instead, people tend to hold 
stocks until the market gets terrible, and then sell. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Diversify. Just because stocks have generally outperformed other 
investments in the past doesn't guarantee that they will do so in the future. 
So don't put all your money into stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Divide your investments among stocks, bonds, real estate, and money market 
funds or savings accounts. If stocks and bonds do poorly because of high 
inflation, real estate will do well. One of the best decades for housing was 
the 1970s -- one of the worst for stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Also, diversify your stock portfolio. Don't put all of your money into one or 
two issues or one or two industries. If you don't have at least $50,000 to 
invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, then consider mutual funds. They 
provide instant diversification for far less money.

INSURERS CUT BACK ON MENTAL HEALTH COVERAGE; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: HMOS AND OTHER PLANS ARE DECIDING WHO REALLY NEEDS THERAPY AND FOR HOW 
LONG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Marilyn came in from the rain but sat at home in her coat for three hours. She 
was paralyzed with anguish over a sick child who had been hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Often overwhelmed by the problems of parenthood, she had seen a psychologist 
last fall and winter and believed that he could help her cope with this latest 
crisis. But Marilyn's health maintenance organization won't pay for her to 
visits to that psychologist any more, and she can't afford to pay the whole 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, she is stuck with several hundred dollars' worth of bills for previous 
visits that may not be paid either, despite many frustrating calls to the HMO. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like beating your head against a wall," said Marilyn, who did not want 
her real name used. "It's the most horrible thing." 
</P>
<P>
Many users of mental health services are quickly learning that insurance 
companies and HMOs, under pressure from employers trying to cut costs, more and 
more are calling the shots. They are trying to reduce spending on therapy for 
people such as Marilyn, as well as for those seeking help for alcoholism and 
other drug abuse problems. 
</P>
<P>
For many years, insurers have tried to limit hospital stays, which typically 
cost between $350 and $700 a day. Now the focus is also on the cost of office 
visits to psychiatrists, who charge $100 an hour and up, and psychologists, 
whose fees run to $95 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Some patients tell of their insurers curtailing benefits, delaying payments for 
months and leaving them in a stressful limbo, not knowing if coverage will 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
And doctors and psychologists say that patients are often not getting the type 
or duration of treatment they need because of HMO rules. Some people, deterred 
by HMO screening procedures, are not seeking help at all, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a disaster," said Dr. James Bozzuto, a Hartford psychiatrist and 
assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
"HMOs are involved in the rape of the mentally ill in a way that hasn't been 
done since the turn of the century," said Bozzuto, who is under contract with 
Cigna Healthplan of Connecticut Inc., an HMO. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Kahn, a professor of psychology at University of Hartford who has a 
private practice, said: "These organizations set up machinery to discourage 
both the provider and the consumer from getting the quality of service that's 
needed. Many patients deny (that they have a) problem. If machinery is set up 
to discourage people, they'll happily fold their tents and go away." 
</P>
<P>
The HMOs and other insurers that offer coverage for prepaid fees say they are 
cutting out needless spending in the fastest growing segment of employers' 
health-care costs. They say they are improving the quality of mental care by 
channeling people into appropriate treatment. They say they are protecting them 
from overkill and dependency on therapists. 
</P>
<P>
The companies have hired mental health professionals to decide whether people 
seeking such treatment really need it, who will provide the treatment and for 
how long. Some have changed their rules on payment to discourage what they 
regard as unneeded treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Cigna Healthplan this year further restricted the way its members can get such 
help by narrowing the choice of therapists and tightening control over duration 
of therapy. Scores of patients had to switch therapists or face paying the 
whole bill themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers Corp. has introduced in five cities an employer plan that will 
require employees seeking therapy to be evaluated in person by a representative 
of the insurer. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Psychiatric Systems Initiative program, Travelers refers people to 
therapists who are members of its own network. The company avoids using 
therapists it believes provide treatment when it is not needed, and expects the 
program to cut employers' costs for mental health care and substance abuse 
treatment between 5% and 35%. 
</P>
<P>
Aetna Life Insurance Co., one of the first insurers to limit psychiatric 
hospital stays, last year bought Human Affairs International Inc. to improve 
its ability to review all types of mental claims. 
</P>
<P>
Constitution Health Network, an HMO, stopped giving members their first 10 
mental health sessions free, hoping to discourage unneeded therapy. The HMO 
wanted to avoid paying for counseling for stress that might be alleviated 
through changing jobs, exercising or a "change of perspective on the 
situation," spokeswoman Leslie Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
The HMO now requires members to pay 50% of all mental health visits, up to $40 
a visit. 
</P>
<P>
The efforts to curb these costs are being spurred by employers who see group 
medical coverage costs skyrocketing and decide what benefits they want to 
offer, said Dr. Richard Kunnes, a psychiatrist and medical director for product 
management and development at Travelers Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole area of psychiatric care and substance abuse is an explosive area" 
of group insurance, Kunnes said. "I think most companies are scared to death by 
the whole problem." 
</P>
<P>
Insurers say that U.S. employers spend up to 30% of their health-care dollars 
on mental health and substance abuse treatment for employees, compared to 6% 
five years ago. The industry, however, doesn't keep data on how much insurers 
are paying out. 
</P>
<P>
While the overall cost of medical claims rose 18.6% for U.S. employers in 1987 
and 1988, the cost of substance abuse treatment and other mental care climbed 
27%, according to a survey by A. Foster Higgins &amp; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Many insurers believe that these claims are rising because therapy has become 
socially acceptable. "Yesterday's stigma is today's red badge of courage," 
Aetna's public relations material reads. "Now, a generation of baby-boomers 
willingly seeks professional help for a variety of life's problems." 
</P>
<P>
To curb these costs, most HMOs now offer only the minimum mental health 
coverage required by state law. Conventional insurance plans may provide more 
coverage if the employer so desires. 
</P>
<P>
Yet decisions about what treatment is necessary are often subjective, and the 
penny-pinching by insurers and HMOs may backfire, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
An HMO or insurer should pay at least $5,000 a year for outpatient mental 
health care to avoid more serious and costly problems later, advises Lafe H. 
Myers, medical director of mental health services at Aetna Life, which has 
interests in HMOs nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
In controlling the expenses of general medical claims, insurers and HMOs in the 
past have applied objective medical criteria, but the definition of mental 
health is largely subjective, Bozzuto said. "HMOs have learned the game of 
making believe mental illness doesn't exist." 
</P>
<P>
Cigna, Aetna and others, however, said they use American Psychiatric Assn. 
criteria in assessing diagnoses to determine how much treatment they will pay 
for. The companies said that their own mental health professionals often 
negotiate treatment with the patients' therapists. 
</P>
<P>
Yet many people complain about the way an HMO will authorize a certain number 
of therapy sessions, and no more, according to the diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
People build up patterns of behavior and emotions over a lifetime, said one 
Cigna Healthplan member who was in therapy. "I think it's ridiculous to assume 
you're going to handle this in two sessions, or nine, or whatever," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Cigna Healthplan has been the most aggressive HMO in efforts to reduce mental 
health claims. Previously, Cigna had informal arrangements with dozens of 
psychologists whom it paid to treat members referred by their medical doctors. 
The HMO dropped that system this year and now has formal contracts with 
psychological clinics and independent psychologists. Cigna kept its contracts 
with psychiatrists. 
</P>
<P>
For people whose therapists were dropped, Cigna Healthplan paid for transition 
sessions so patients could see them a few more times before switching to 
HMO-sanctioned therapists. 
</P>
<P>
Now, members who feel they need counseling must be screened and referred.

WOOLWORTH GROWS FROM ITS DIME-STORE ROOTS; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: WHILE SOME DEPARTMENT STORE CHAINS ARE FLOUNDERING, THIS CENTURY-OLD 
CHAIN IS BUILDING A COLLECTION OF SPECIALTY STORES.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For many shoppers, stepping into a Woolworth store is like passing through a 
time tunnel and entering a cozy and dependable world. 
</P>
<P>
Cramped aisles display the kind of inexpensive candies, sponges and note pads 
that have been sold for a century at Woolworth stores around the country. Many 
of the outlets still house the familiar luncheonettes serving coffee, sodas and 
hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
Such consistency has bred generations of loyal shoppers, who have been weaned 
on Woolworth's historic image as a surviving five-and-dime store, the kind of 
operation where the incidentals of life can be purchased at low prices. 
</P>
<P>
"Wherever I've lived, there was always a Woolworth's," said Wilma Roman, a 
dental assistant from Riverdale, N.Y., who spent a recent lunch hour filling a 
basket with items from a mid-town Manhattan Woolworth store. "I can buy all my 
bathroom and kitchen needs here. I've been shopping here for years." 
</P>
<P>
Despite repeat business, Woolworth Corp. isn't betting its future on variety 
stores, many of which are dowdy and yielding fewer profits. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to aggressive experimenting and a few select acquisitions, Woolworth 
actually makes more money by running a multitude of specialty chains -- stores 
selling shoes, sneakers, women's clothing, sportswear, costume jewelry and 
party doodads. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based retailer oversees 43 chains numbering 8,000 outlets 
worldwide, although fewer than 1,700 are variety stores. They boast names such 
as Kinney Shoes, Foot Locker, Kids Mart, Susie's, Afterthoughts and Athletic 
X-Press. Consumers would never know that they belong to Woolworth. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the company created Woolworth Express, a miniature version of the 
variety store that sells only items with high profit margins. Like many of its 
other chains, Woolworth Express is being expanded with Woolworth's own funds. 
</P>
<P>
Woolworth's success contrasts with other retailers losing money or sagging 
under debt. From the brink of bankruptcy in the early 1980s -- when the company 
closed hundreds of unprofitable variety stores operated under its Woolco alter 
ego -- Woolworth has used specialty chains to expand into an $8.1-billion 
behemoth. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, Woolworth has become America's most diversified retailer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a world of evolving merchandising," said Harold E. Sells, Woolworth's 
chairman and chief executive, in a recent interview in the company's 
76-year-old headquarters in lower Manhattan, once known as the Cathedral of 
Commerce, thanks to its gothic-style architecture. 
</P>
<P>
"Each year, new things pop up that we didn't even think of years ago. It's 
never-ending," said Sells, who began his career in 1945 as a Kinney shoe 
salesman in Fort Smith, Ark. "Ten years from today, there'll be whole new 
fields to explore." 
</P>
<P>
The willingness to explore has made Woolworth a Wall Street favorite. The 
merchandise mix and scattered store sites -- including West Germany and 
Australia -- help to weather economic downturns. Attentive investors have 
pumped up the stock nearly 35% in the past year, and sometimes fueled takeover 
talk. 
</P>
<P>
Woolworth's make-over began in earnest in 1982, when management decided to 
close nearly 400 Woolco stores in the United States. (Woolco still operates in 
Canada.) 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine closing a $1-billion business?" said Howard Davidowitz, a New 
York-based retailing consultant. "A lot of people thought Woolworth would never 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, there was precedent for Woolworth's gambit. Years earlier, Woolworth 
had acquired Kinney Shoes and Richman, a clothing chain. Both helped provide 
the expertise needed to guide other highly focused efforts. 
</P>
<P>
And Woolworth executives recalled the success of Foot Locker, their 1974 
experiment with sneakers that today numbers more than 1,000 stores and even 
spawned two of its own spin-offs -- Lady Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker. 
</P>
<P>
It also helps that Woolworth managers knew their way around commercial real 
estate, and were trying to change the company just as downtown shopping 
districts were yielding to the growing number of suburban shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
Woolworth made itself a desirable tenant by opening several of its different 
specialty stores in malls. The strategy provided important leverage with 
developers and allowed the company to test new concepts. 
</P>
<P>
"The malls are our laboratories," Sells said. With roughly 1,500 major shopping 
malls around the country, Woolworth has a large number of locations in which to 
try new ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"The customer is the judge," Sells said. "If one (idea for a new store) doesn't 
work, we'll close it up and go on to something else." 
</P>
<P>
The company's flexibility can help Woolworth find workable strategies even as 
its venerable Kinney chain suffers sluggish sales and concern mounts that 
sneakers are a maturing market. 
</P>
<P>
"They have an enormous challenge because variety stores aren't that 
profitable," Davidowitz said. "If Kinney and Foot Locker get sick, they'd be in 
big trouble. So they're trying almost everything." 
</P>
<P>
Sells stressed that Woolworth isn't waiting for disasters. New ideas are 
dreamed up either by the chairman's group of top five officials or by division 
presidents, who are encouraged to think like entrepreneurs. He hopes to have 60 
different chains by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Not all ideas work. The company is giving up on two unprofitable concepts: 
Frame Scene, which sells picture frames, and Face Fantasies, a cosmetics store. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Woolworth Express is being heralded as the Woolworth of the future, 
because the profitability of the older variety stores is waning and leases are 
expiring. In 10 years, the older chain will drop to 800 stores in the United 
States from today's 1,100. 
</P>
<P>
Woolworth expects to expand the current 20 or so Express stores to 1,000 in the 
same period. Some will open in rejuvenated downtowns, but most will be in 
malls. 
</P>
<P>
Why? "It's a matter of economics," Sells said. The older stores produce $110 in 
sales per square foot, on average, versus $275 in the Express outlets. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can't get more than $200 in sales per square foot" in a mall, Sells 
said, "Any new venture can't make money."

South Africa -- In Sheila Benson's Oct. 15 commentary, the director of 
"Mapantsula" was identified as a black South African. Oliver Schmitz is a white 
South African who collaborated on the screenplay with Thomas Mogotlane, the 
black South African who starred in the film. The two used a mixed crew to shoot 
the movie in the black township of Soweto and in Johannesburg.

MUSIC &amp; DANCE NEWS: JOHN CLIFFORD IS EYEING A COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These days, John Clifford travels a lot, both as a free-lance choreographer and 
as an official representative of the George Balanchine Trust. 
</P>
<P>
He has lately been in Milan, Italy, staging Balanchine works on the La Scala 
Ballet. This week, following a fortnight of heavy Balanchine activity at UC 
Irvine, Clifford goes to France, to stage three more Balanchine works on the 
Paris Opera Ballet. In December, he is in residence at Ballet British Columbia 
in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
But the old days -- the 10 years (1975-85) Clifford was artistic director of 
Los Angeles Ballet -- are not forgotten. In conversation, the 42-year-old 
Californian, who spent much of his youth as a protege of Balanchine at New York 
City Ballet, still refers to his Los Angeles decade. Now he puts it in a 
particular context. 
</P>
<P>
With some heat, he says, "As always, the question remains, does Los Angeles 
want a truly resident ballet company, one locally based and fully professional? 
Up to now, other cities have supported their own ballet, and L.A. has not." 
</P>
<P>
On the phone from Orange County, Clifford, referring to the Joffrey Ballet's 
bi-coastal status as a resident company at the Music Center, says: "I don't 
think it's a secret that sharing one company between two or more cities just 
doesn't work. A lot of cities have tried it, and it's not successful in the 
long run. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference is in having dancers who have been trained in this place, pay 
taxes in this place, make this their base and participate in a kind of 
inbreeding with the community." There is a bottom line, Clifford feels. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes a city a cultural center is having a symphony orchestra, an opera 
company and a ballet. Until Los Angeles has all three, it can't pretend to be 
such a center." 
</P>
<P>
The dance company Clifford travels with these days is called Ballet of Los 
Angeles (BOLA). It was formed hastily, two years ago, to take over tour dates 
for the engaged-but-defunct Chicago City Ballet. In the spring of 1990, it will 
embark on a third national tour -- but one which will still not see the 
16-member troupe dancing in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Does Clifford envision BOLA as the company Los Angeles is waiting for? 
</P>
<P>
"Look," he says, friendly but firm, "I don't need to put together a company for 
Los Angeles. I've done that. But we do have this group -- we have dancers, a 
budget, a repertory. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The dark-haired dancer/choreographer says his company has not been avoiding 
Southern California, but that the right kinds of engagements have not 
materialized. They might just come together in the spring, he says, when BOLA 
undertakes its latest transcontinental tour. 
</P>
<P>
According to the booking agent for Ballet of Los Angeles, Gary Lindsey of Gary 
Lindsey Artistic Services in San Francisco, the tour begins in McAllen, Tex., 
March 28, moves cross-country to New York, South Carolina, Pennsylvania and 
Michigan, and closes in Fresno April 14. 
</P>
<P>
Clifford says "Since we are touring anyway, and if we can incorporate some 
Southern California performances into the itinerary, why not? We're willing. 
The important thing is to do them with no deficits." 
</P>
<P>
The choreographer claims, "I haven't signed anything, but I am talking to the 
people at the Keck Theater (at Occidental College in Eagle Rock)." 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Warshaw, the impresario at Occidental, says "We have told them 
(Clifford and Lindsey) that our facilities are available." 
</P>
<P>
Lindsey says he does not book Southern California engagements for BOLA, but 
handles only tour dates away from Los Angeles. He does confirm, however, that 
the possible dates in Keck Theater are Feb. 23 and 25, a month before the 
national tour begins. Clifford mentions also that BOLA might dance at Irvine in 
late April, after the tour. 
</P>
<P>
This tour is considerably shorter than the seven-week itinerary the 16-dancer 
company followed last spring, Clifford acknowledges. 
</P>
<P>
"It was planned that way on purpose, because of my other commitments. We didn't 
want a long tour," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"These days, my income comes entirely from working in Europe," he insists. 
"What I do here is extra, and usually in between those other jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Clifford says he realizes what a far cry the present organization is from the 
company that disbanded in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"At our peak, we had a budget of $2 million, employed 36 dancers, gave more 
than 100 performances a year, plus extras, and did five years of 'Nutcrackers.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
In 1989-90, the company's budget is down from the $480,000 it took to run the 
two-month tour last spring. The roster of 16 dancers still includes two former 
members of the Bolshoi Ballet, Alla Kaniashvili-Artiushkina and Vitaly 
Artiushkin, and associate company director Allegra Kent and Antonio Lopez. 
Clifford says a European tour in 1991 is now being booked for the troupe. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, we are breaking even. If we continue to do so, and increase our 
size, our budget and our repertory, we will be in a position to come back." 
</P>
<P>
'AIDA' APPROACHES: A much-ballyhooed touring production of Verdi's "Aida" as 
mounted by the International Opera Festival will reach Los Angeles Memorial 
Coliseum, May 4 and 5. At a cost of a reported $7 million, this production 
boasts "the Sphinx and three pyramids . . . a cast of thousands as Egyptian and 
Ethiopian spear holders and soldiers in 1,500 costumes, 5,000 props, 100-person 
ballet, full 100-piece orchestra, as well as lions, tigers, bears, camels and 
even a python." 
</P>
<P>
With the announcement comes a toll-free phone number, a so-called "Aida Hot 
Line": (800) 365-6560. Last week, one caller dialed it but found only an 
operator willing to "have someone call you back." 
</P>
<P>
The touring extravaganza was first given in 1987 in Giza, Egypt (to decidedly 
mixed reviews), hard by the Sphinx and pyramids. It has since traveled to 
Montreal, Sydney, Melbourne, Vancouver and Tokyo. The Los Angeles performances 
will mark the production's first visit to this country. 
</P>
<P>
Giuseppe Raffa will conduct; among the promised singers are Grace Bumbry, Ruza 
Baldani, Gordon Hawkins and Bruno Sebastian. 
</P>
<P>
SALAMUNOVICH: In celebration of his 40 years of service at St. Charles Borromeo 
Church, veteran choral conductor Paul Salamunovich was feted, toasted and 
roasted last Sunday at the North Hollywood church. As a longtime associate of 
Roger Wagner, Salamunovich worked with professional and academic choirs for 
more than 30 years; as his own choral musician, he has been on the faculty of 
Loyola Marymount University since 1964. As a choral clinician, he continues to 
cover the globe: In 1990, his travels include professional stops in West 
Germany, Australia and Canada.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE

Broader Abortion Policy 
</P>
<P>
The House adopted, 216 to 206, an amendment to broaden federal abortion policy 
by permitting Medicaid funding of the medical procedure when a pregnancy 
results from rape or incest. The language was attached to a fiscal 1990 
appropriations bill (HR 2990). Medicaid now covers only those abortions 
necessary to save the mother's life. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.) said, "Congress cannot and must not turn its 
back on the poorest victims of rape and incest who become pregnant." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) said: "Rape and incest are tragedies.... But 
why visit on the second victim, the unborn child that is the product of (the) 
criminal act, capital punishment?" 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported Medicaid funding of abortion if the pregnancy is 
by reason of rape or incest.

Desecration of the Flag 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 371 to 43, the House sent to President Bush a bill (HR 2978) 
making it a federal crime to physically damage the American flag. Also due for 
congressional votes this year are proposals backed by conservatives to protect 
the flag by constitutional amendment. The legislative activity is in response 
to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling this year that flag desecration is political 
expression protected by the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Don Edwards (D-San Jose), said it is better "to protect the flag by a 
simple statute than to go through the mammoth and dangerous procedure of 
weakening for the first time in our history the free speech provisions of the 
Bill of Rights." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) said, "If you really want to protect the 
flag, if you really want to do something more than make a gesture, then given 
the court's decision you have to support our bipartisan constitutional 
amendment to save the flag." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to protect the flag by statute.

CLEANUP ADDS TO SHIPYARD'S TROUBLES; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: AFTER CLOSING ITS DOORS AND FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY IN JULY, TODD 
SHIPYARDS IS BATTLING WITH THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES OVER WHO SHOULD CLEAN UP THE 
WATERFRONT PROPERTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Todd Shipyards Corp., which is struggling to bring itself out of Chapter 11 
bankruptcy and to sell the assets of its defunct San Pedro operation, faces a 
new problem: a battle with the Port of Los Angeles over an expensive 
environmental cleanup of the waterfront property it has leased for four 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Todd and the Harbor Department are at odds over how they will 
split the bill for the cleanup, which port officials estimate will cost "tens 
of millions" of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the Harbor Department has spent more than $100,000 on preliminary 
testing at the 112-acre facility leased by Todd, and the shipyard has spent the 
same amount cleaning up contamination it has discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Todd officials, meanwhile, say the way the environmental issue is resolved 
could have a serious effect on the company's reorganization plan, filed last 
month in federal bankruptcy court in New Jersey, and could also delay their 
efforts to sell the San Pedro yard. 
</P>
<P>
"This environmental matter has just shelved everything," said Tom O'Toole, who 
is assistant manager of the San Pedro yard and is among a group of Todd 
managers who have proposed a leveraged buyout of the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Since the yard shut down in July, O'Toole said, Todd has been keeping a core 
crew of 87 employees -- including managers, secretaries, accountants and 
purchasing staff -- in San Pedro so a new owner could immediately restart 
operations. But if negotiations over the environmental cleanup drag on, he 
said, it might be too expensive for Todd to keep the team in place. 
</P>
<P>
The other potential buyer of the yard said his company, Intercontinental 
Logistics Inc., had hoped to purchase the shipyard assets and begin operations 
Nov. 1.

<P>
Jim Dobson, a principal in the Agoura-based investment group, said 
Intercontinental proposes to take over the entire Todd property, possibly in a 
joint venture with the union that represents shipyard workers. In addition to 
operating a scaled-down ship repair business, he said, Intercontinental hopes 
to establish a training school that would teach trades used in ship repair and 
other industries, such as aircraft manufacturing, to as many as 1,800 
apprentices. 
</P>
<P>
But neither the Intercontinental plan, nor that of the Todd managers, can be 
presented to the bankruptcy court for approval until the environmental issue is 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Although the environmental problems are not likely to keep a new owner from 
moving into the yard, the prospective buyers want assurances that they will not 
be liable for the contamination. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dobson: "I think the problem is between the Harbor Department and Todd, 
and we are sort of stuck in the middle." 
</P>
<P>
The dispute between Todd and the port revolves around the shipyard's lease for 
its facility. The lease has a so-called restoration clause that requires Todd 
to return the property to its condition in 1970, when the agreement was 
negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
In part, that means a physical restoration. Todd is required to remove 
buildings and equipment that it built after 1970, a requirement that may become 
moot if a new owner continues to operate the entire 112 acres as a shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
But the lease also calls for environmental restoration -- removal of toxins 
that may have contaminated the soil or the sediment in the waters where Todd 
built and repaired hundreds of ships since the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Source Hard to Determine 
</P>
<P>
Chris Foley, the port environmental scientist who is supervising testing at the 
Todd site, said consultants are checking for petroleum hydrocarbons, perhaps 
from underground fuel tanks that may have leaked, and for heavy metals, such as 
lead, zinc and mercury. 
</P>
<P>
But in Todd's case, determining responsibility for such contamination is 
complicated because the site has been home to a shipyard since World War I. 
Thus, consultants are reviewing Todd's records, as well as those of state and 
county agencies, to check for possible toxic spills or accidents for which Todd 
has liability. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if you find contamination, how do you determine what was as a result of 
Todd's operation or was it a result of a previous operation?" asked Lillian 
Kawasaki, director of environmental management for the port. "We're trying to 
determine how you allocate those responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Todd and the port have disagreed not only on the extent of the 
contamination but also on how heavy a burden the shipyard must bear for 
cleaning it up. Todd has also hired consultants to do testing, and its test 
results conflict with those of the port. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, Todd Shipyards President Hans Schaefer said that during 
a meeting last month, port officials handed company representatives a report 
that estimated Todd's cost for the restoration would be $35 million, with $20 
million devoted to environmental cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about his response, Schaefer said: "What could we say? We terminated the 
meeting." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Last Resort Procedure 
</P>
<P>
And on Oct. 4, Todd said in a press release that the port had threatened to 
file a claim for that amount with the bankruptcy court. The release said "any 
allowance of a claim of this magnitude could" ruin the reorganization plan. 
</P>
<P>
Port officials did not acknowledge the $35-million figure, but said they would 
file a claim with the bankruptcy court as a last resort, if Todd and the Harbor 
Department cannot come to an agreement. "If everything breaks down we would 
have a very significant claim," said Winston Tyler, the senior assistant city 
attorney who handles port legal matters. 
</P>
<P>
According to Schaefer, the reorganization plan calls for Todd to pay its 
creditors in full, in part by selling off the San Pedro assets as well as the 
highly profitable Aro Corp., a Todd subsidiary that manufactures air-powered 
machinery and lifesaving equipment. The bankruptcy judge has approved the 
proposed sale of Aro. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer said that although paying creditors 100 cents on the dollar is unusual 
in a bankruptcy proceeding, Todd officials feel that is necessary for the 
company "to survive outside of bankruptcy as an ongoing business." 
</P>
<P>
Although he said a $35-million claim would put a serious dent in that plan, 
Schaefer declined to say how much Todd is willing to pay. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Tests Ordered 
</P>
<P>
As part of the continuing negotiations, the port recently authorized its 
consultant, Ebasco Environmental of Santa Ana, to conduct a second round of 
testing at Todd. 
</P>
<P>
Kawasaki said those tests covered only certain areas where contamination is 
suspected, and will be used to establish a short-term cleanup plan and to draft 
an agreement that is acceptable to both sides.

DON'T BLAME KELL FOR COAST CLUB LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This letter is in response to the letter of Joe Galliani (Times, Oct. 12), 
which attempts to lay the blame for the demolition of the Pacific Coast Club at 
the feet of Mayor Ernie Kell. The Coalition to Preserve Historic Long Beach 
devoted countless hours and thousands of dollars to try and find a way to 
preserve this local landmark. As chairpersons of the coalition since its 
inception, we would like to set the record straight. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Coast Club fell to the wrecker's ball because of unsolvable 
economic problems and the legal complications of building a private hotel on a 
public beach. When local preservationists were working with developer Rob 
Bellevue to find a way to save this important part of Long Beach history, Mayor 
Kell directed the city manager and staff to work with us and to do whatever was 
necessary to preserve the club. Alas, it was hard economics and not a lack of 
will that caused the club's demise. 
</P>
<P>
Galliani's broadside attack on the insensitivity of the mayor to preservation 
issues is also misplaced. In addition to the creation and staffing of the 
Office of Neighborhood and Historic Preservation, other pro-preservation 
measures have been supported by the mayor. He has directed the drafting of two 
ordinances for consideration by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The first would prevent the demolition of landmarks until approved plans and 
financing agreements for replacement projects are in place. The second would 
require developers of historic sites to pay for adaptive reuse feasibility 
studies as part of the environmental review process. 
</P>
<P>
Also, surveys have been ordered to identify buildings worthy of recognition to 
put both preservationists and owners on notice that these structures have 
special meaning to our citizens and that their demolition will be permitted 
only after exhaustive review and attempts to incorporate them into the city's 
urban fabric. The list of successes goes on; preservationists have never had it 
so good. 
</P>
<P>
All this is not to say that we have not had our unconsolable losses, the 
Pacific Coast Club and Jergins Trust Building among them, and that the battle 
has been won. Eternal vigilance is the price we must pay if we wish to 
incorporate the most evocative of our city's past into its future. The 
stewardship of Mayor Kell and City Manager Jim Hankla have made that watch 
easier.

ORANGE COUNTY BLOOD DONORS HELP SATISFY NEED BY BAY AREA

A flood of good will from blood donors in Orange County and other areas of the 
state has given the Red Cross more than enough blood to send to the 
earthquake-stricken San Francisco Bay Area, officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Mueller, a spokeswoman for the Orange County chapter of the Red Cross, 
said that the county's three blood collection centers in Santa Ana, Anaheim and 
Huntington Beach were flooded with donors after Tuesday's 6.9-magnitude 
temblor. 
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 people were injured in the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday and Thursday, Red Cross workers collected 1,906 pints of blood, 
far surpassing a normal two-day total of 600 pints. Red Cross also collected 
more than $114,000 in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"The reports we have received indicated that the blood needs have been met in 
San Francisco," Mueller said. "It was a critical time, but the need has been 
met." 
</P>
<P>
Mueller said she was elated by the response. She said that on Wednesday, an 
Anaheim computer store owner closed his business and accompanied his employees 
to the nearest center to give blood. JAMES M. GOMEZ

ELATED O.C. FIRE CREW PULLS LIFE FROM CARNAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

One small movement of life lifted Orange County Fire Department Battalion Chief 
Chuck Nicola Saturday from a deep gloom that overcame him after three days of 
dealing only with the dead. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like the highest high I could experience," Nicola said after he and 
Orange County firefighter Dan Mackay led a dramatic rescue of a 57-year-old 
dock supervisor buried for 90 hours in the rubble of the Nimitz Freeway in 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Buck Helm of Weaverville was pulled from the wreckage of his car by the two 
firefighters, who are part of a Heavy Rescue Flash Fire unit stationed in the 
department's Seal Beach fire station, said Fire Capt. Hank Raymond. 
</P>
<P>
Working feverishly in a dusty crawl space that threatened to collapse at any 
time, Nicola and Mackay tore with a Jaws of Life tool at the mangled door of 
Helm's car until they could finally free him. Then they and five others pulled 
Helm to safety. Helm had been trapped since a 6.9-magnitude earthquake 
collapsed the double-decker freeway at 5:04 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The rescue "was really a boost to us all," Nicola said. 
</P>
<P>
News of the involvement of the two firefighters spread quickly Saturday at 
their station on Beverly Manor Road and Seal Beach Boulevard, where fellow 
firefighters eagerly watched local television reports throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
"They were watching for them all day," Raymond said. "It was good news to hear 
that our local guys played a big part in this. It's exciting for our guys to 
see our own people in a faraway place like that." 
</P>
<P>
Raymond said that the rescue began after someone scouting among the wreckage 
noticed a hand moving. California Department of Transportation workers and 
private contractors rushed to shore up the section of overpass that had 
collapsed on Helm's car. 
</P>
<P>
"It was real tricky work," Raymond said. "A lot was going on. The structure had 
been shifting. But when they knew a guy was alive in there, they all shifted in 
gear." 
</P>
<P>
Nicola, who arrived in Oakland on Thursday morning with four other members of 
the Seal Beach heavy rescue workers, crawled into the three-foot-high space 
that was left after the top of the double-decker freeway collapsed onto the 
lower level during Tuesday's temblor. 
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't much headroom," Raymond said the men told him. 
</P>
<P>
As Nicola reached Helm's flattened car, Nicola said he felt a rush of 
adrenaline when he saw the victim's head and feet moving slightly. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an emotional roller-coaster when you go from retrieving dead people and 
body parts to actually seeing a live human being in pretty good spirits," 
Nicola said. 
</P>
<P>
Nicola then ordered firefighter Mackay to bring in a Jaws of Life tool to pry 
the car door open, Raymond said. Working in the tight, enclosed space, rescuers 
took seven hours to extricate Helm from the flattened car, Raymond said. Helm 
talked to workers throughout the operation, he added, and was finally passed to 
safety by a human chain of workers. 
</P>
<P>
The special operations team has been involved in major rescues since its 
inception in 1983. Nicola and other members of the team rescued victims after 
the devastating Mexico City earthquake, Raymond said. "He's sort of getting 
used to this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was Mackay's first dramatic rescue as part of the team, however, Raymond 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mackay has proposed renaming the heavy power tool that saved Helms' life the 
"Spirit of Buck" and putting a nameplate in Helm's honor on the housing.

WHAT SOME FORMER COUNTY EMPLOYEES ARE DOING NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jeffrey A. Perlman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following are some of the county employees or elected officials who now 
seek to influence county government either on their own behalf, for their new 
employers or for their clients. 
</P>
<P>
BRIAN MAY, a former aide to Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder. He is a lobbyist who 
recently won a county contract for a civil engineering firm. Until recently, 
May's wife, Ruby, also a former Wieder aide, worked with her husband as a 
lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
BRYAN SPEEGLE, former director of advance planning for the county. Joined 
Culbertson &amp; Adams, a consulting firm founded by former county employees, 
in June, 1987. According to county records, just before Speegle left, he 
received a letter from Culbertson &amp; Adams thanking him for suggestions 
later incorporated in a development agreement between the county and the firm's 
client -- the Santa Margarita Co. However, county officials say such letters 
are received routinely from consultants and developers. Speegle was until July 
a registered "influence broker" under the county regulations applying to anyone 
contributing more than $452 over a 12-mont period to any Supervisor and who is 
employed or contracts with others as a lobbyist. Culbertson and Adams has two 
County Environmental Management Agency consulting contracts totaling $70,053. 
</P>
<P>
TOM DALY, former aide to Supervisor Don R. Roth. He quit in June to become 
executive director of the Orange County Building Industry Assn., a major donor 
to the campaigns of county supervisors. He recently began lobbying county 
officials to reject Orange County Fire Chief Larry J. Holms' proposal to 
require fire sprinklers in all new residential construction, which the building 
industry says adds unnecessarily to the high cost of housing. Daly, who also is 
an Anaheim city councilman, said he has only talked to members of the county 
staff so far about Holms' proposal, but adds that he intends to lobby the 
supervisors, including Roth, his former boss. 
</P>
<P>
NANCY COSS-FITZWATER, formerly in charge of government relations at the County 
Transportation Commission. She now works in a similar capacity at the Irvine 
Co. According to commission Executive Director Stanley Oftelie, she continues 
to exchange information and views about pending state and federal legislation 
with her successor at commission, Monte Ward. Coss-Fitzwater was Ward's boss at 
the Transportation Commission. Oftelie contends that there is no conflict of 
interest in such contacts, because anyone can write or call the commission to 
submit views on legislation, and because the transportation agency already has 
frequent contact with the Irvine Co., which helps fund some transportation 
improvements sought by the commission. (Oftelie himself is a former aide to 
retired supervisor Ralph Clark.) 
</P>
<P>
RALPH CLARK, who retired from the Board of Supervisors in 1984. He occasionally 
has lobbied for companies seeking local government contracts, including a firm 
that bid on the contract for the county's freeway emergency call boxes. 
Supervisor Roger R. Stanton said Clark called him recently about a matter 
involving the Orange County Transit District, which Clark helped found and 
chaired for many years, but Stanton said he could not recall whether Clark was 
acting on behalf of a client or not. Clark did not return a reporter's phone 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
BRUCE NESTANDE, former state assemblyman and county supervisor. He is now vice 
president of Costa Mesa-based Arnel Development Co., continues to serve as an 
influential member of the California Transportation Commission. Nestande 
attempted to broker a last-minute settlement last year between slow-growth 
activists and the supervisors that would have avoided the costly, bitter 
election battle in which a slow-growth ballot measure was defeated 56% to 44%. 
He also lobbied supervisors on behalf of the proposed half-cent sales tax for 
traffic improvements that is now Measure M on the Nov. 7 ballot countywide. 
Nestande chaired a growth management committee created by the supervisors and 
now chairs the pro-Measure M campaign. 
</P>
<P>
PETER HERMAN, who currently works for Hon Development Co. He once was 
considered so powerful while an aide to Board Chairman Thomas F. Riley that he 
was dubbed the "sixth supervisor." Herman has talked to Riley and his staff 
about a planned Hon development in South County, but was recently asked by 
Riley aide Tom Matthews to stop coming around. "I told him in person that I 
didn't appreciate him coming in like that and that certainly the company had 
others who could talk to us instead." Herman says he believed that he was best 
suited to talk to Riley because of his familiarity with the supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
DAN MILLER, former aide to Supervisor Roger R. Stanton. He now works for the 
management consulting firm of Deloitte, Haskins &amp; Sells, which has had 
several contracts with the county, its transportation agencies, the county 
grand jury and city governments. 
</P>
<P>
Miller also is a former member of the county administrative staff, where he 
dealt with county budget and financial matters. Miller said he has met with 
county supervisors or their staffs several times to discuss his firm's 
business. He doesn't consider that lobbying, however, because he said such 
contacts are usually initiated by county officials who have various questions 
about current or pending work. 
</P>
<P>
May, Clark, and Speegle could not be reached for comment. Gibson deferred to 
his boss, who told The Times that an interview with Gibson would be OK, but 
then Gibson did not return The Times' phone calls.

EARTHQUAKE: MANY OF THOSE WHO LIVE AND WORK ON THE NEWPORT-INGLEWOOD FAULT ARE 
RESIGNED TO BEING NEAR A HARBINGER OF MAYHEM ON A STAGGERING SCALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
From the regulars who frequent Paula's palm, Tarot-card and psychic readings 
shop in Sunset Beach came a single recurring question in the last few days: 
"When will the Big One come?" 
</P>
<P>
It's a question that even Paula -- a woman who does her futuristic gazing from 
a two-room shop that sits virtually atop one of the area's most potentially 
destructive fault lines -- dares not touch. 
</P>
<P>
"That's God's business. I don't mess around with predictions like that," she 
says. "There's not much you can do about it." 
</P>
<P>
Such is the attitude -- a mixture of resignation and optimism -- held by many 
of the devout and the non-religious alike who live and work along the 
Newport-Inglewood Fault, a powerful harbinger of destruction that runs through 
much of the Orange County coastal area. 
</P>
<P>
School playgrounds and retirement communities, century-old Huntington Beach 
homes and gleaming new, multimillion-dollar condominiums, quaint old fishing 
piers and intimidating power plants and weapons stations -- all lie in the path 
of the fault, subject to its spasmodic whims. 
</P>
<P>
While relatively small in size, the Newport-Inglewood Fault threatens mayhem of 
staggering proportions largely because it runs through some of the most densely 
populated areas in Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
A myriad of other variables -- among them soil composition, building structure, 
and the type of quake -- can also help determine which areas will be hit 
hardest by a temblor, regardless of how close they are to the epicenter, 
seismological experts say. 
</P>
<P>
That is primarily why the massive 6.3 quake of 1933, centered in Huntington 
Beach, vented its most destructive wrath in Long Beach. And on Tuesday, San 
Francisco's Marina District suffered the region's worst damage even though it 
was more than 50 miles from the quake's origin near Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, proximity to a fault is more than just a psychological fear. "As a 
general rule," said Christine Boyd, manager of the county's disaster planning 
unit, "the closer you get to the center, the more at-risk you are." 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Arnold knows that. A science teacher at Huntington Beach's Ethel Dwyer 
Middle School, he says that his house, directly on the fault line, "is probably 
the last place you'd want to be in a quake." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's All Over' 
</P>
<P>
Besides its location on the fault, he says: "The place is sunk in Jell-O. That 
point 10,000 years ago was a swamp. In a good-sized quake, it's all over." 
</P>
<P>
Arnold, who talked with some of his students about earthquakes this week after 
the San Francisco quake, takes unusual precautions at home by bolting down wall 
pictures and some household items, in addition to keeping on hand more 
traditional emergency supplies. Such items as a first-aid kit, a flashlight, 
canned and dried food, and a supply of water are recommended. 
</P>
<P>
Some local residents -- about 20% statewide by informal estimates -- take out 
quake insurance on their homes, often requiring large deductibles that can 
reach into the tens of thousands of dollars even on modest houses. 
</P>
<P>
But more common seems to be the fatalistic attitude of people such as Isadore 
(Pop) Greenbaum, a longtime fisherman who says he has felt the Newport Beach 
pier rumble ominously underneath him four times during his four decades in the 
area, including the 4.5 quake on April 7 that was centered in the city. The 
fault runs directly through the Newport beachfront area on its way into the 
Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes, it comes. Not much use worrying about it," the 78-year-old 
Greenbaum said. "I remember when one hit a ways back, some of the people didn't 
know what it was, and I told 'em it was just a whale scratching its back." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Connection 
</P>
<P>
With few physical remnants in the area from past jolts, the threat of the Big 
One seems for many along Orange County's major fault to have little connection 
to daily life. It is an abstract concern that takes on tangible form only 
during and immediately after minor temblors -- or events such as Tuesday's 
major quake in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
"After (the San Francisco quake), we're all earthquake-minded right now," said 
Vera Pate of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Even in past minor quakes in the local area, the first few instants were 
terrifying, fisherman Greenbaum says. "The whole place starts to shake, and I'd 
be thinking, 'Why was I so bad to my wife? I love her. I gotta repent.' . . . 
But what can you do about it?" 
</P>
<P>
Added Bill Pitts, 35, another fishing regular on the Newport pier: "I always 
figured that if the Big One came, I'd just jump into the ocean and stick it out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Pitts, a defense industry engineer, said that the Newport-Inglewood fault 
"really scares me. . . . I think it's a much greater danger than most people 
realize." 
</P>
<P>
Some people living and working on the fault itself are apparently unaware of 
their precarious position. 
</P>
<P>
Sara Topolewski, 14, a Huntington Beach High School freshman, said she was 
"really freaked out" when she first learned from a science teacher a few years 
ago that her school sat near a major quake zone and that an elementary school 
on the very site had in fact been demolished in the 1933 quake. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scary Thing 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, dear! That is a scary thing," Ginni Ris, who just took over as general 
manager of the Huntington Landmark Senior Adult Community, said upon learning 
of the 1,238-unit complex's positioning, which is in the fault zone. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure if people know that, but I'm afraid it would terrify everyone if 
they did," Ris said. "If something like that were to come out, it could panic 
the elderly people who live here . . . and it could jeopardize property 
values." 
</P>
<P>
State law requires realtors to inform potential buyers if they are looking in 
an area that has a history of seismological problems. 
</P>
<P>
But even some in the realty industry acknowledge that this requirement may be 
routinely ignored. And some homeowners interviewed along the Newport Inglewood 
Fault said that they don't recall being told of the fault's location in advance 
and learned of it only after the purchase. They added, however, that such 
information probably would not have affected their decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"We get a lot of people just coming into this area who are deathly afraid of 
the earthquakes and ask a lot about it," said Steve Ward, a Century 21 
franchise owner whose region includes the fault zone in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"But for anybody who's been here a while, it's not an issue." Ward said his 
agents are required by company policy to notify potential buyers of fault 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Really Care 
</P>
<P>
Added Audra Kunf, a program manager with the county's disaster planning unit, 
"When people are in the market for a house, they usually don't think to ask 
about Newport-Inglewood or any other fault, or don't really care." 
</P>
<P>
Back in 1933, Helen Tarbox didn't know either that the Victorian farmhouse in 
Huntington Beach that she grew up in lay directly on the Newport-Inglewood 
Fault. But when row upon row of marmalade jars "just began tumbling off the 
cupboards to the floor" early one evening, she knew it meant only one thing: an 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
By the time it was over, the major quake had carved a trench -- now gone -- by 
a hilltop in the back yard. Although only a few feet in diameter, the earthen 
opening seemed bottomless. "We'd throw rocks down there, and you couldn't even 
hear them hit bottom," said Tarbox, now 89, of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The home itself -- built in 1898 by Tarbox's father, William Newland, a 
Huntington Beach businessman who helped shape the city in its early days -- was 
left remarkably unscathed by the jolt and stands today as a nationally 
registered historic landmark on Beach Boulevard.

ANNUAL EAGLE FLIGHT HELPS GIVES DISABLED A NEW PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Before takeoff on his first small-plane flight Saturday, 6-year-old Richard 
Grasse looked out at the single-engine airplanes lined up on the runway and 
said, "I don't think they order dinner on these planes." 
</P>
<P>
Richard was one of about 400 physically and developmentally disabled children 
and adults who got free 15-minute plane rides Saturday at Fullerton Municipal 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Their rides were part of Eagle Flight, an annual event sponsored by the city of 
Fullerton, International Wheelchair Aviators and about a dozen other 
organizations. The idea is to give disabled people what often is their first 
ride in an airplane, organizer Beverly Guido-Deutsch said. 
</P>
<P>
Guido-Deutsch, 35, began the Eagle Flight project in 1981, the International 
Year of the Disabled. It grew from its modest beginings to the all-day event it 
was Saturday, when more than 100 volunteers, clowns, jugglers and musicians 
were on hand. 
</P>
<P>
After waiting his turn, Richard, a kindergartner at John O. Tynes Elementary 
School in Placentia, clutched his blue balloon and walked onto the taxiway. 
Richard, who has cerebral palsy, was helped by a volunteer to climb over the 
wing and into the cockpit of Bill Blackwood's Cherokee 180. 
</P>
<P>
Blackwood, 67, of Escondido, is secretary of International Wheelchair Aviators. 
He was one of about 25 pilots, both wheelchair-bound and ambulatory, who 
provided the airplanes and fuel for the rides. 
</P>
<P>
"Eagle Three-Charlie, ready for takeoff," co-pilot John Earle radioed to the 
tower. After a short wait behind five other planes, Blackwood steered onto the 
runway and hit the throttle. "And away we go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The engine speed soon reached 65 m.p.h. and the plane was airborne heading 
toward Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the engine doesn't quit," Richard said as they were ascending over the 
Santa Ana Freeway. Flying in a small plane feels different, he said. "Louder 
too." 
</P>
<P>
The plane circled counterclockwise at 1,500 feet over Buena Park, Anaheim and 
Fullerton. As Blackwood guided the craft over Knott's Berry Farm, Disneyland 
and Anaheim Stadium, Richard propped himself up in his seat to see past the 
left wing. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen Disneyland from the sky before," he said as the plane few over 
Harbor Boulevard. "Can I see Magic Mountain?" 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen minutes later, the plane was slowing, making its descent toward the 
airport. Richard's sole comment as the wheels struck the runway: "Whoa!" Earle 
turned in his seat and asked, "You liked that, Richard?" Richard smiled and 
nodded. 
</P>
<P>
Back on the ground and back with his parents, Richard said he was not too 
certain that he wanted to go up again. Not that the flight scared him, he said, 
but "it's funner to go to a carnival and stay on the ground," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard's flight was Blackwood's second of the day. He probably would take five 
or six more groups up before the event ended, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a chance to help out some people who would never fly if we didn't do 
this," Blackwood said. "You give somebody a break who would normally not get 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The International Wheelchair Aviators, a fraternal organization whose purpose 
is to encourage the physically handicapped to fly, provides about five planes 
and pilots for Eagle Flight, Blackwood said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably easier for us in wheelchairs to fly these people than other 
pilots because we can recognize some of the problems these kids face." 
</P>
<P>
Many of his passengers have had severe mental handicaps, he said, so he doesn't 
hear many thank yous. "But you can tell by their eyes that they liked it," he 
said. "It makes you feel better at the end of the day." 
</P>
<P>
Also helping Saturday were Marines from the Tustin Marine Corps Air Station, 
employees of Beckman Instruments Inc. and members of the Civil Air Patrol, the 
Fullerton Sunrise Rotary and the Fullerton Radio clubs.

UCI OFFICIAL WILL ADDRESS RACISM INCIDENT

A top UC Irvine official will meet with students at the campus Cross-Cultural 
Center on Monday to try and ease tensions over racial epithets that were typed 
on a library computer, a campus spokeswoman said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Horace Mitchell, vice chancellor of student affairs, will discuss Friday's 
incident in which an unknown person added extra phrases to a computerized book 
search and then left a computer printout of the transaction behind. 
</P>
<P>
The library's Melville computer system is available to anyone, and no trace of 
the computer user has been found, officials said. Computer terminals are 
located throughout the facility, on several floors. 
</P>
<P>
Campus spokeswoman Linda Grannell said she did not know who found the printout, 
which used a racial slur and suggested that blacks were inferior to whites. 
</P>
<P>
Colleen Bentley-Adler, another spokeswoman, said the printout consisted of 
three pages of recorded book searches. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever did it just typed in the extra phrases, printed out a record of it, 
and then either deliberately or accidentally left it behind." 
</P>
<P>
Grannell and Adler said they knew of no other similar incidents at UCI, even 
though there are easily accessed computer bulletin boards available. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford University and colleges on the East Coast have had major controversies 
involving the use of racial epithets via computer bulletin boards, telephone 
calls and in personal confrontations.

DRIZZLE HELPS FIREFIGHTERS IN BATTLE TO CURB BLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
A light early-morning drizzle and an overcast sky Saturday brought relief to 
the 1,100 firefighters who have been battling a raging brush fire that has 
ravaged the rugged countryside in Orange, Riverside and San Diego counties 
since Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, sparked by military maneuvers in the northernmost portion of Camp 
Pendleton, burned more than 11,000 acres by midday Saturday and was only 48% 
contained, U.S. Forest Service spokesman Norm Machado said. Four firefighters 
suffered minor injuries battling the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
Machado said the fall-like weather that developed in the Southland slowed the 
fire's progress and allowed firefighters to regain a measure of control that 
was lost Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze has been confined largely to uninhabited regions of Camp Pendleton, 
Cleveland National Forest and South Orange County. There has been no loss of 
property and no civilian injuries, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But two U.S. Forest Service firefighters were taken to Samaritan Medical 
Center-San Clemente on Friday, Forest Service dispatcher Dolores Fremter said. 
One was suffering chest pains, while the other suffered a dislocated shoulder. 
Their names and conditions were not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, one Orange County firefighter cut a knee and was taken to Mission 
Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo where he was treated and 
released. A fourth firefighter was treated at the scene for a minor burn, 
Fremter said. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, the fire advanced more than three miles into the deep canyon, 
destroying acres of dry brush before the wind died down again. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been no increase in the size of the perimeter since then," Machado 
said. "The light rain and high humidity have really helped us a lot." 
</P>
<P>
The blaze probably won't be contained for at least the next 48 hours, officials 
said. The two hottest spots continue to be in the Bluewater Canyon and La Paz 
Canyon in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Machado said the often steep and inaccessible terrain has made it nearly 
impossible to move firefighters and heavy equipment near the fire line to clear 
away dry chaparral in the path of the advancing flames. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's weather, which helped in one way, hindered in another. Machado said 
that all eight air tankers were grounded because of low-lying fog that draped 
much of the area. 
</P>
<P>
"The weather was great, but it made it tough for us logistically," Machado 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire started Wednesday afternoon after Marine Corps troops began operating 
in the firing ranges near the San Mateo Canyon area of the sprawling Marine 
base. Marine Lt. Patrick Gibbons said an investigation was under way.

1 KILLED, 3 HURT IN SEPARATE CRASHES AT SAME PLACE

<TEXT>
<P>
Two separate drunk-driving accidents at the same intersection in Costa Mesa 
about an hour apart early Saturday claimed the life of one man and injured 
three others, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A tractor-trailer truck slammed into the side of a car whose driver allegedly 
was drunk and had run a red light at Harbor Boulevard and Victoria Street. A 
passenger in the car was fatally injured, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
As officers arrived to direct traffic, another driver, who was later arrested 
on suspicion of drunk driving, plowed into the side of a parked police car, 
said Costa Mesa Police traffic investigator Steven Rautus. The driver was 
injured but a police officer and a police dog in the patrol car were not 
seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Hector Esparza-Campos, 21, of Santa Ana, died shortly after the car in which he 
was riding was struck by the tractor-trailer truck. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car, Miguel Viornery, 23, also of Santa Ana, was seen weaving 
as he headed along Harbor Boulevard. Witnesses told police he speeded up and 
ran a red light at Victoria Street. 
</P>
<P>
The truck struck with such force that the car was sent across the intersection, 
ending up on the sidewalk in front of a coffee shop, Rautus said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the truck, Gilberto Nunez, 37, suffered neck and back pain and 
was treated at College Hospital Costa Mesa after his truck, which had been 
hauling bread, jackknifed. 
</P>
<P>
Esparza-Campos was taken to Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical 
Center, where he died about 4 a.m. Viornery was taken to United Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana with minor to moderate injuries. Neither of the two men was 
wearing seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
About an hour after the crash, Officer Del Gadillo was sitting in his police 
car in the intersection with the overhead emergency lights flashing when a car 
driven by Eddie Valle, 28, of Santa Ana, rammed into him. Gadillo saw Valle's 
car coming and tried to move the police car out of the way. Valle was 
hospitalized and held on suspicion of drunk driving.
