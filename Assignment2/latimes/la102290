<P>
As an old male chauvinist, the article by Lutdke caused me a pain in my limited 
thinking processes. 
</P>
<P>
Since I have been consistently pro-choice on the abortion issue and feel this 
is a gender issue that should be decided by women, I have to believe that the 
right to privacy is valid. 
</P>
<P>
Now we have the locker room issue. Do these athletes have a right to privacy? 
</P>
<P>
You missed the obvious solution to the problem. Throw all of the reporters out 
of the locker rooms -- male and female. Women have many fights to win in the 
battle of the sexes. This one should end in a draw.

DETECTIVE'S DEATH AND GUN CONTROL

<P>
In response to "Veteran L.A. Detective Dies in Restaurant Shoot-Out," Part A, 
Oct. 11:

Russell Kuster was a casualty of war. Anyone who crossed his path, as I did on 
a newspaper story back in 1979, quickly recognized that he was devoted to his 
job and, more than many, he loved being alive. 
</P>
<P>
Flying the city's flags at half-staff for 30 days is an appropriate reminder of 
his passing, but a more fitting memorial would be a genuinely tough handgun 
control law, a swifter, surer criminal justice system (six weeks from arrest to 
jail in England!) and a national computer to keep track of career criminals 
such as Kuster's assailant. Kuster will be remembered as long as there are 
police and people who care about them.

There appear to be three logical alternative to resolve the current controversy 
over women reporters conducting their interviews in the men's locker room. 
</P>
<P>
1. Provide an interview room for all reporters; 2. Install a communications 
system that women can use from outside of the locker room, or 3. Require all 
reporters to disrobe before entering the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, a compromise will be reached before we find Barbara Walters 
interviewing Mike Tyson in the men's room at Los Angeles International Airport!

I am a Marine currently deployed in the Persian Gulf. First, let me say that 
all the support that we have received from everyone at home is outstanding! 
Every letter written reaches a Marine, soldier or sailor who is lonely and far 
from home, and shows him or her that someone cares. 
</P>
<P>
One of our major problems during our off-time is boredom. Invariably, talk 
turns to home. Then the competition factor sets in. Friendly arguments become 
loud arguments. The most popular subject, by far, is women, and this always 
leads to the question "where do the best looking women come from?" As a native 
Californian, stationed at El Toro for most of the year, I have maintained that 
the best-looking women in the world are all from California. However, those 
poor souls who are not lucky enough to have seen for themselves keep asking for 
proof. Thus I come to you for help. Photos, to be exact. The more that I, and 
the other Marines I work with receive, the higher our morale will get. Any help 
(letters or photos) can be sent to the following address: HQ 3rd MAW G-2, FPO 
San Francisco, CA 96608-6001.

As I read Ludtke's argument, I could see Procrustes smiling in vindication of 
his simple-minded system of achieving equality. 
</P>
<P>
Her approach is Procrustean in its attempt to fit the logic of democracy into 
the domain of biology. 
</P>
<P>
I want to suggest that equal civil rights will not suffer if the sexes remain 
separate in locker rooms. Surely a less juvenile way can be found that allows 
reporters to get sports news on an equal basis.

EVER-PRESENT DANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK NUNLEY, Officer CHUCK NUNLEY of the Los Angeles Police Department was 
shot and wounded in April, 1984, while investigating a family dispute. He 
talked to The Times about police fears of being shot: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We do have a fear that anything can go wrong at any given point. When you are 
confronting people -- whether it be a car full of five or six gang-bangers or 
people fighting -- there is always a fear. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think there are people running around waiting to blow away police 
officers, but there is always the present danger. For us to hear of something 
like the shooting of Detective Russell Kuster affects us all personally. April, 
1984, automatically clicks in my head. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't know (Kuster), but it's still like losing a family member. We've all 
run around on that same track, done push-ups on the same field and been taught 
pretty much the same things. It's devastating, but we know we have to keep 
pushing. If we don't, this city could go to hell. Steps are being taken to help 
make sure officers aren't wounded in the line of duty. Hopefully, the new 
gun-control law that Chief (Daryl Gates) is pushing will help. We are running 
into kids on the street with much more sophisticated weapons than we have.

A GRAND OLD PARTY, IN TWO PARTS; 
</P>
<P>
ONE SIDE STANDS FOR REFORM, THE OTHER FOR REELECTION. THE SPLIT MAY BECOME 
PERMANENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL M. WEYRICH, Paul M. Weyrich is president of the Free Congress Research 
and Education Foundation, Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ongoing fracas over the budget and tax policy has revealed to the public 
what insiders have long known: there are two different Republican parties. 
Until now, they have managed to get along, at least in public. But the tax 
question has sent them after each other's throats, creating an open split that 
may become permanent. 
</P>
<P>
The two groups are the Reform Republicans and the Party Republicans. The Reform 
Republicans put their agenda above loyalty to the party institution. That 
agenda has two parts. In policy, it visualizes an America made prosperous 
through a revitalized free market, which requires big cuts in taxes and reduced 
government spending and absorption of capital through borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
Reform Republicans see the deficit and Gramm-Rudman as opportunities, not 
dangers. They would use them as leverage to reduce federal spending and 
borrowing through a total freeze on spending (including entitlements) or by 
letting the Gramm-Rudman ceilings take effect. Reform Republicans see the 
rising tide of anger at Washington now manifesting itself across the country, 
and want to run as critics of the Establishment, not members of it. 
</P>
<P>
Party Republicans have fundamentally different perceptions. They have no real 
policy agenda; their focus instead is on "making deals." They are process men, 
concerned much more with keeping things on an even keel than with pushing any 
particular set of policies. They seek harmony between the Congress and the 
President, looking to the White House for leadership and guidance; they are 
uncomfortable with partisanship, and they find any public bloodletting 
distasteful. "No new taxes" has little policy or political importance in the 
their eyes, especially when compared with the need to make a deal, and they 
view Gramm-Rudman as a grave danger, not an opportunity to reduce the size of 
government dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Politically, the Party Republicans are establishmentarians. Their "real world" 
lies inside the beltway, and their political barometers are the White House, 
Wall Street and one another. They have little feel for what is happening back 
in Kansas, and not much interest in it either. They have no ambition to become 
a majority party in the House; reelection of incumbents (themselves), not party 
growth, is their goal. 
</P>
<P>
When House Republican whip Newt Gingrich announced his opposition to the budget 
deal, the Reform Republicans crossed their Rubicon. Now, if they go back to the 
sort of "deal for a deal's sake" the Party Republicans want, they will find 
they have alienated their own base. Having put their agenda above their party 
loyalty once, they will find they must consistently do so or shatter and turn 
upon themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Where does this leave the Republican Party? The Reform Republicans are right in 
sensing a growing wave of popular indignation against politicians. Their 
populist, "outsider" message could enable the party to ride this wave to power. 
Politicians who in effect come out against themselves with support for measures 
like term limitation can still be credible with the public. 
</P>
<P>
But the Republicans most visible to the public through the budget fiasco have 
been the Party Republicans. They come across like what they are, professional 
politicians without an agenda beyond staying in office, and the public reaction 
has been strongly negative. They represent the Establishment of wealth and 
privilege that average Americans have come to resent deeply. Not only are they 
out of touch with their constituents, the constituents know they are out of 
touch with them. 
</P>
<P>
Their image shaped by the Party Republicans, Republican incumbents may take a 
severe drubbing in November. In the long run, that could be good for the party, 
because it could open the door to ascendancy of the Reform Republicans, who 
have far greater potential public appeal. But there is also a danger that the 
public will not be able to distinguish clearly between Reform and Party 
Republicans, and will slaughter both indiscriminately. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge facing Reform Republicans at this point is getting their 
difference from Party Republicans across to their constituents. The next 
proposed "deal" on the budget should give them another opportunity to do so. 
But the hour is late, and courage may be waning. Will the Reformers see that 
their only hope lies in separation? We will soon find out.

By HAROLD WILLENS, Harold Willens, a Los Angeles business executive, serves as 
senior adviser to the Washington-based Center for Defense Information, a 
nonpartisan educational organization. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This month marks the centennial of Dwight D. Eisenhower's birth and at this 
moment in history, America sorely misses the courage and common sense of this 
remarkable soldier and statesman: the supreme allied commander who led us to 
victory in World War II, the U.S. President who called for a "total war upon 
the brute forces of poverty" -- a war whose victory would bring the benefits of 
better "roads and schools, hospitals and homes, food and health." 
</P>
<P>
Today's softheaded hard-liners urge us to keep throwing money at the Pentagon's 
attempts to snow the American people with slogans like "peace through 
strength." Ike, the quintessential hard-headed soft-liner, taught us to value 
strength through peace: "There is no way in which a country can satisfy the 
craving for absolute security -- but it can bankrupt itself, morally and 
economically, in attempting to reach that illusory goal through arms alone. The 
military Establishment, not productive of itself, necessarily must feed on the 
energy, productivity and brain power of the country, and if it takes too much, 
our total strength declines." 
</P>
<P>
Americans are at a point in our history that makes these words of wisdom 
relevant. We are confronted by a fateful choice: Will our preeminent national 
priorities be slanted toward the Pentagon or the people? To be specific, will 
billions of dollars continue to be spent on nonsense, such as the so-called 
Stealth bomber or the pie-in-the-sky fantasy called Star Wars? Shall we keep on 
putting our money where our myths are, simply because of the political power of 
the military-industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us about? The Pentagon's 
wish list or the people's genuine needs? 
</P>
<P>
As we consider and debate the profound implications of the question, we must 
keep in mind this fact: During Ronald Reagan's first four years in office, 
military spending doubled, reaching nearly $300 million a year. As David 
Stockman, Reagan's director of management and budget, said at the time: "They 
were squealing with delight" ("they" being the military-industrial complex). 
</P>
<P>
When we add this scandalous figure to the military-related corruption of recent 
years, it becomes evident that in the last nine years American taxpayers have 
paid hundreds of billions of dollars more than necessary for any reasonable 
definition of national security. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Adm. William Crowe, recently retired chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, said, "The threat of a surprise attack on Western Europe is 
gone." In a more general sense there is widespread acceptance of the fact that 
the Cold War has finally ended. So when do we get a clear-cut national-security 
scenario that reflects new realities rather than one that looks at the world 
through a rear-view mirror? 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, American adults behaved like children beguiled by a Pied Piper 
named Reagan, who led us to assume that budget deficits do not matter. But now 
we know that they do and that every dollar counts. Consistent with that 
awareness, we must demand that our "leaders" justify spending many billions of 
dollars on a bomber without a purpose, the B-2 Stealth (whose name implies, as 
its only possible target, raids on our national Treasury). 
</P>
<P>
We have been given no reasonable rationale for this astronomically priced 
Edsel, no description of a mission that fits the new world around us. Although 
beset by severe malfunctions and interminable delays, our government continues 
to pour good money after bad. This, despite the added fact that cost overruns 
remain concealed, as do the terms of the Air Force's contract with Northrop. 
Talk about stealth! 
</P>
<P>
Star Wars and Stealth bombers are but the tip of a gargantuan iceberg. The 
totality drains the lifeblood out of our economic body politic. 
</P>
<P>
Like all realistic Americans, I understand the importance of national security 
and I support an adequate military component. The point here is to stress the 
failure of our government to redefine national security in ways that reflect 
new realities rather than old myths -- and to remind our fellow citizens that, 
in the words of Dwight Eisenhower's January, 1960, farewell address: "We must 
guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or 
unsought, by the military-industrial complex."

PLAIN AS THE NOSE ON YOUR FACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA AKGULIAN, Laura Akgulian is a Washington essayist who writes regularly 
about ethnicity in America. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Are you from the Middle East?" the woman inquired, her voice thick with 
accent. She seemed hellbent on conversation during my quiet bus ride home. I 
scrutinized her alert eyes and deeply lined face, trying to discern whether she 
was merely curious or spoiling for a fight. 
</P>
<P>
When I said I was born in Wisconsin, she became impatient. "But your 
grandparents; where were they from?" When she discovered that her guess was 
reasonably accurate, she sat back, relieved. "I knew it!" she announced 
proudly. "I'm an anthropologist." 
</P>
<P>
Then she added the six little words that struck fear in my heart. "I could tell 
by your nose," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Under other circumstances I might have pondered why strangers feel compelled to 
comment on such things. Or I might have wondered how reliable an ethnic 
indicator one's nose is. But there wasn't time. She hurtled into an impassioned 
(and remarkably loud) speech about the beauty of "unusual" noses -- how mine 
had so much character, how it wasn't like everyone else's, how nose jobs were 
despicable. By now every passenger in the front half of the bus was studying my 
nose and assessing its character. 
</P>
<P>
This woman's sister had urged her to get her nose fixed, and she was still 
fuming. "This is America!" she shouted. "What is this infatuation with noses 
that all look alike? You have such a gorgeous nose -- you'd never think of 
getting a nose job, would you?" 
</P>
<P>
I felt a sharp pain. My neighbor faded away and there I was, standing by my 
high school locker, listening uncomprehendingly as a "good friend" was telling 
me how another "friend" secretly hated me because of my excessively curly hair 
and my big, ugly nose. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, I did think about having a nose job. In fact, I almost got one. I remember 
so clearly planning to have that operation -- what had intervened? Perhaps my 
features had evened out. Maybe the issue had receded at college, where 
intellectual rather than facial aesthetics were stressed and where distinctive 
ethnic schnozzes far outnumbered WASPish, regular features. 
</P>
<P>
Regular features -- what, after all, did that mean? Western literature is 
replete with heroes and heroines sporting fine, elegant noses. Elegant, I 
understood, meant small, noble, straight. Everyone calls it a "nice" nose. 
</P>
<P>
Those of us who passed through the birth canal without first packing the 
requisite designer genes found ourselves less fashionably attired. Our noses 
wore frumpy labels like pug or prominent, hawk or hook, flat or broad, bumpy or 
ski jump. "Elegant" meant first-class travel; the others were pay-as-you-go. 
</P>
<P>
I'd never begrudge anyone the option of resculpting a nose to alleviate 
anguish. But by buying into the American penchant for "nice" and "normal" 
(read, familiar and upper-class European) as opposed to "distinctive" and 
"ethnic" (less familiar, hence frightening or declasse), we help perpetuate the 
absurd notion that "regular features" exist in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"Regular" in our multicultural nation comprises whatever our ancestral lineage 
has bestowed upon each of us. It's a fact as plain as that lovely appendage 
they call the nose on your face.

Dallas Cowboy wide receiver Michael Irvin missed the final 10 weeks of the 1989 
season and the first four weeks of this season because he was recovering from 
knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The third-year pro from Miami got his first reception of 1990 in the fourth 
quarter of Sunday's game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
He also caught a 28-yard touchdown pass from Troy Aikman with 23 seconds left 
to give the Cowboys a 17-13 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where I get my nickname, 'The Playmaker,' " Irvin said. "It was just a 
chance to make a play." 
</P>
<P>
Aikman, who completed 13 of 29 passes for 159 yards, scrambled 20 yards to the 
Buccaneers' 28 to set up the go-ahead points. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Aikman directed a 14-10 victory over Tampa Bay (4-3) but didn't 
think the Cowboys (3-4) earned the respect they deserved. 
</P>
<P>
"All week long (the Buccaneers) were saying we were just lucky to win, and that 
they were a much better team," Aikman said. "They weren't giving us any credit, 
and that was on our minds." 
</P>
<P>
Irvin's touchdown catch came less than two minutes after a 32-yard field goal 
by Steve Christie appeared to thwart the Cowboys' effort to overcome a 10-point 
halftime deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Issiac Holt of the Cowboys intercepted two passes thrown by Tampa Bay 
quarterback Vinny Testaverde, returning one 64 yards for a touchdown in the 
fourth quarter to tie the score, 10-10. 
</P>
<P>
"After (Holt) made that play, I said, 'This gives me a chance to really do 
something -- to get out there and win the game in two minutes,' " Irvin said. 
"That's what football is all about. It's a wide receiver's dream." 
</P>
<P>
Irvin's first reception came on a 14-yard pass from Aikman, who also connected 
with Jay Novacek on an 18-yard pass play before his 20-yard run gave Dallas a 
first down at the Buccaneer 28 with 31 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
After a timeout, Irvin ran past cornerback Rodney Rice to the left corner of 
the end zone where he made his touchdown catch just beyond the reach of safety 
Mark Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"I just said, 'Get it to me. get it to me,' and he did," Irvin said. "Troy made 
a perfect pass." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Bates intercepted a pass by Chris Chandler with six seconds left, securing 
the victory for the Cowboys, who sacked Testaverde five times and Chandler once 
to remain one of eight teams that have never lost to the Buccaneers in a 
regular season or playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
"This team has gone through some difficult times and we're trying to fight 
through it," said Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson, who watched his team generate 
only 100 yards of total offense in a 20-3 loss to the Phoenix Cardinals last 
week. "We had a very disappointing game a week ago and it's really good to see 
them bounce back the way they did." 
</P>
<P>
Testaverde completed 21 of 32 passes for 271 yards and one touchdown before 
leaving the game with a toe injury on the drive that produced Christie's field 
goal and a 13-10 lead with 1:56 left. 
</P>
<P>
The loss prevented Tampa Bay, which is off to its best start since 1982, from 
moving to within one game of first-place Chicago (5-1) in the NFC Central 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Buccaneers took a 3-0 lead on a 23-yard field goal by Christie. Testaverde, 
whose streak of 97 consecutive passes without an interception was stopped by 
Holt on Tampa Bay's first possession, made it 10-0 with a three-yard touchdown 
pass to Danny Peebles.

OILERS' RUSH PARTY INITIATES WALSH AND STOPS SAINTS, 23-10;

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Walsh got his initiation rite as a starting quarterback from the Houston 
Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, who came off the bench last week and led New Orleans to victory in his 
first game with the Saints, passed for 292 yards but was harried all game 
Sunday by the Oilers, who ended up with a 23-10 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Houston (4-3) sacked Walsh four times, forced a fumble and made an interception 
after the quarterback had taken the Saints (2-4) to an early 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"The line kept constant pressure on him after that first drive and then he 
started to feel the pressure more," defensive end William Fuller said. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo White, who fumbled away a chance for Houston at the New Orleans 
one-yard-line on the first drive of the game, later scored on a one-yard run 
and a six-yard pass from Warren Moon as the Oilers built a 17-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Moon completed 23 of 37 passes for 202 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Houston's Tony Zendejas kicked field goals of 43, 45 and 33 yards. However, 
Zendejas suffered a broken left leg while planting his foot on the kickoff 
after his third field goal. Zendejas will be out from four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
After the early fumble by White, Walsh led the Saints 97 yards in 15 plays, 
completing six of his first seven passes. The Oilers stiffened at the two and 
Morten Andersen kicked a 20-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
After that, nothing came easy for Walsh, who had a short stint as a starter 
last season for the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressure was good," Walsh said. "The only time they were able to get a lot 
of heat on me was on obvious passing situations late in the game. They get good 
pressure on the quarterback. They get in the passing lanes and give you a lot 
of trouble when you're trying to make some reads. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still not where I'd like to be, but I feel like I'm making progress. I've 
learned the system. I just need more experience with it." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh completed 22 of 39 passes, including a 31-yard touchdown throw to Hoby 
Brenner. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints had a chance to increase their 3-0 lead when Walsh drove them 
downfield again in the second quarter, but the drive stalled and Sean Jones 
blocked Andersen's field-goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
After Moon's touchdown pass to White, Walsh tried to bring the Saints back 
before halftime, but his pass for Dalton Hilliard was intercepted by Johnny 
Meads, who returned it 32 yards to the New Orleans 26 with 12 seconds left. 
Zendejas kicked a field on the last play of the half to make it 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve had a good game," Saints' Coach Jim Mora said. "It wasn't a perfect game 
by any means, but I'm encouraged by his performance. Houston has an outstanding 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said his short time with the Saints was a factor. 
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the Oilers' defensive players were talking a lot and it 
upset some of his rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
"That hurt us on some of the snap counts," Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
The loss ended the Saints' NFL record-tying streak of 13 consecutive victories 
against AFC teams, dating to 1986. Miami won 13 consecutive games from NFC 
teams from 1978-81.

Defenseman Chris Chelios, benched earlier in the week for poor play, had a goal 
and three assists for a personal-high four points as the Chicago Blackhawks 
beat the Minnesota North Stars, 7-1, Sunday night at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Goalie Jacques Cloutier, also in Coach Mike Keenan's doghouse for ineffective 
play, stopped 24 shots for his first victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Cloutier lost his shutout with 2:47 remaining on a goal by Mike Modano. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago improved to 6-4-0. Minnesota is 0-6-1 in its last seven games, and 
0-7-2 at Chicago Stadium since March 28, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
After Keith Brown scored his first goal of the season 2:12 into the game, 
Chelios scored his third of the season at 13:04. It was one of four power-play 
goals by the Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
Chelios also set up Jeremy Roenick's power-play goal at 17:29 and fed Steve 
Larmer, who scored his seventh of the season 40 seconds into the second period 
for a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Chelios, who was benched on Tuesday in Detroit by Keenan, added his third 
assist at 7:49 of the middle period, setting up Trent Yawney's power-play goal. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary 2, Edmonton 1 -- Brian MacLellan and Theoren Fleury scored 
second-period goals and the Flames limited the Oilers to 16 shots on goal at 
Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames controlled the tempo and outshot Edmonton, 31-16. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver 3, Quebec 2 -- Steve Bozek, the Canucks' fourth-line center, scored 
at 10:51 of the third period to break a 1-1 tie and scored again five minutes 
later for Vancouver at Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
Bozek took a shovel pass and beat goalie Ron Tugnutt with a low shot, and then 
made the score 3-1 at 16:11 by putting a loose puck into the net.

CHANG WINS FIRST SET, BUT LENDL TAKES THE NEXT THREE

<P>
Top-seeded Ivan Lendl rallied to beat Michael Chang, 1-6, 6-2, 6-1, 6-2, Sunday 
and win the Hong Kong Tennis Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Chang, 18, had a fast start, breaking Lendl twice in the opening set, but 
Lendl, ranked third in the world, rallied to take the next two sets with ease. 
Chang won only one of five service games in the third set. 
</P>
<P>
The third-seeded Chang, who beat Lendl in a five-set match in the fourth round 
of last year's French Open, could not duplicate that performance. 
</P>
<P>
He lost his serve in the fifth and seventh games of the fourth set, helping 
Lendl win the set and the match. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, who also won the Super Seiko tournament at Tokyo last week, collected 
$200,000. Chang, ranked 14th, received $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second year in a row that Chang lost in the final. Last year, he was 
beaten by Miloslav Mecir of Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Mary Joe Fernandez beat Barbara Paulus of Austria, 6-1, 6-3, and 
won the Porsche Cup tournament at Filderstadt, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Fernandez, 19, lost the final to Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina. 
Paulus, 20, beat Sabatini in Saturday's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Paulus appeared nervous in the first set of the final and never found the 
rhythm she displayed against Sabatini. Paulus, ranked 16th in the world, 
started with a double fault and lost her first four service games. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez moved Paulus around the court throughout the 68-minute match. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the second set, when Paulus tried to step up the pace, Fernandez had 
little trouble controlling the play and converted her first match point chance 
for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, ranked eighth in the world, received $70,000 from the purse of 
$350,000. Paulus earned $31,500. 
</P>
<P>
Unseeded Swede Anders Jarryd capped a week of upsets by defeating fourth-seeded 
Austrian Horst Skoff, 6-3, 6-3, 6-1, in the final of the ATP CA Trophy 
tournament at Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
It was Jarryd's first major victory since 1986. Because of injury, he had 
dropped to 175th in the ATP rankings from fifth in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Goran Ivanisevic of Yugoslavia used big serves and strong groundstrokes to beat 
Henri Leconte of France, 6-2, 7-6 (8-6), 4-6, 4-6, 6-1, and win the 
$1.1-million European Community Championship at Antwerp, Belgium. Ivanisevic, 
19, received $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Rosset of Switzerland won his first indoor title, defeating Mats Wilander 
of Sweden, 6-3, 6-2, in a $500,000 Grand Prix tournament in Lyon, France. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to win a tournament before the end of the year and today I've made 
it," Rosset said.

COLT'S BUDDY SYSTEM PAYS OFF 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Thanks to In Excess, it wasn't a totally bad weekend for Bruce Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
After he watched Native Twine finish last at Keeneland Saturday and Aksar run 
eighth in the Budweiser International Sunday, the trainer was saved on the home 
front. 
</P>
<P>
With Jack Carava saddling the colt in Jackson's place, In Excess took advantage 
of a perfect trip to easily win the $110,300 Volante Handicap Sunday at Santa 
Anita. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-1 second choice, In Excess tracked pacesetter Pro For Sure for six 
furlongs, then came away under Gary Stevens. The final margin was 2 1/4 lengths 
over favored Warcraft with Barton Dene another half-length back in third. 
</P>
<P>
In winning his second consecutive race, the son of Siberian Express covered the 
1 1/8 miles on turf in 1:46 3/5. 
</P>
<P>
Overly nervous in his two races at Del Mar, In Excess has calmed down since he 
started having company on the track. 
</P>
<P>
"In his first two races in the United States, he went to the gate without a 
pony," Stevens said after completing a weekend stakes sweep. He won the Linda 
Vista on Saturday aboard A Wild Ride. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Del Mar, he got uncontrollable in the post parade and in the race. He 
just burned himself out. He's gone to the post with a pony in his last two 
races and he's become much more relaxed. He's got a nice turn of foot when he 
relaxes and he relaxed today. He's a nice colt and I like him a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Purchased in England by bloodstock agent Richard Duggan for owner Jack Munari, 
In Excess now has five victories in 10 lifetime starts and the $65,300 he won 
Sunday pushed his earnings to $179,293. 
</P>
<P>
Warcraft, who had some traffic trouble when a tiring Pro For Sure raced a bit 
erratically through the stretch, has now been second in three of his four turf 
starts and still is seeking his first stakes success. 
</P>
<P>
"My colt ran hard and he felt just fine on the footing," jockey Chris McCarron 
said. "He's such a hard doer in the morning. It feels like he's just breezing 
in the morning, but he might not be able to go much faster than that. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a feeling Gary was on the horse to beat. I rode against him in his last 
race in Louisiana (the Temperence Hill Handicap) and Gary was riding him in the 
stretch like he had to go around another time." 
</P>
<P>
A 9-1 shot, Barton Dene finished third despite a bad break and being wide 
early. He was followed by Balla Cove, Pro For Sure, Dachi's Folly, Green's 
Leader and Mehmetori, who bowed a tendon in his right front leg and had to be 
vanned off the track. 
</P>
<P>
Best Pal isn't owner John Mabee's only talented 2-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
The man behind Golden Eagle Farm has another promising prospect named General 
Meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The son of Seattle Slew beat another highly regarded Seattle Slew colt, Cien 
Fuegos, in Sunday's fourth race. Trained by David Hofmans and ridden by Chris 
McCarron, the Kentucky-bred General Meeting covered the six furlongs in 1:09 
1/5 and performed like a seasoned veteran in his debut. 
</P>
<P>
Outrun by Cien Fuegos and two others early, General Meeting slipped through 
along the rail when room developed, and unlike many inexperienced horses, 
wasn't hesitant about being on the inside. 
</P>
<P>
"He seems like he's got some potential," said McCarron after the three-length 
victory. "I worked him the other day and David told me he liked him. David did 
a tremendous job getting him to the races. The colt was very professional and 
didn't mind being on the inside."

DANA HILLS' SULLIVAN ADDS PLENTY OF DISTANCE TO HIS DRIVES;

<P>
CROSS-COUNTRY: AFTER LEAVING GOLF BEHIND, RUNNER GAINS CONFIDENCE AND PICKS UP 
THE PACE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brendan Sullivan of Dana Hills High School is a champion cross-country runner, 
but nobody expected him to be one, including himself. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan set out to be a golfer, having played the sport since he was 7. After 
all, Sullivan and others thought he didn't have any running ability -- that he 
was too slow. 
</P>
<P>
At the Orange County Cross-Country Championships on Oct. 13, Sullivan, a 
senior, placed fifth in the boys' seeded race. He covered the three-mile course 
in 15 minutes 39 seconds, 20 seconds behind the race-winner, teammate Daniel 
Niednagel. Niednagel is one of the best runners in the state. Sullivan is no 
longer considered slow. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan's transformation from golfer to runner began four years ago -- before 
his freshman year of high school -- when he moved to California from New 
Jersey. He ended up in a spring physical education class taught by Tim Butler, 
Dana Hills' cross-country and track coach. Sullivan ran a 6:07 mile in the 
class and Butler invited him to try out for the cross-country team, which would 
compete in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to encourage all the kids in my P.E. class to come out for 
cross-country," Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan was "bored" and looking for a team sport, but didn't know anything 
about cross-country. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought I'd be a good runner," said Sullivan, 17. "That wasn't my 
motive for going out. I just did it because I wanted to do a sport and I 
figured if the coach thought I could make the team, I might as well try it." 
</P>
<P>
When Sullivan told his family he was going to join the cross-country team, he 
received a less-than-enthusiastic response. 
</P>
<P>
"They (my sisters and mother) laughed at me," Sullivan said. "But my dad 
didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan's father, Kevin, competed for the state championship team at New 
Canaan High School in Connecticut in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the one who came up with the idea of running cross-country and I 
encouraged him to do so because I knew the sport required as much mental 
toughness as fitness," Kevin Sullivan said. "But his sisters and mom didn't 
think it was the sport for him." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan's sisters, Molly, 18, and Brigid, 21, who is a coxswain for the 
University of San Diego crew team, were athletic in high school but didn't 
think their brother could run well. 
</P>
<P>
"They just said, 'You aren't cut out to be a runner,' " he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps his family was mindful of the time when, as a toddler, Sullivan broke 
two bones in his right foot. He was sitting on his uncle's lap on the family's 
porch when the two fell off the porch, his uncle landing on top of him. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan says the injury didn't affect his mobility, but his parents disagree. 
</P>
<P>
"It made him slow as far as learning to walk and run," his father said. 
</P>
<P>
But after Sullivan made the cross-country team, he made up for the slow start. 
He started on the junior varsity team, steadily improving each week in the 1988 
season. Although he was a lot slower than others on the team, it didn't bother 
him much. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really get down on myself because each race I was running 30 seconds 
faster than the previous one. I just kept picking it up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So much so that Sullivan ended the season as the fifth man on Dana Hills' 
Division I state championship team. But Sullivan, who ran a personal best of 
16:42 over the 5,000-meter course at Fresno's Woodward Park, finished in 89th 
place -- far behind the team's other runners. In contrast, Dana Hills' No. 1 
runner, Mike Tansley, was fifth in 15:21, more than a minute faster. Sullivan 
proved he was a good runner, though far from great. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan made little progress his junior year when the Dana Hills' team 
finished ninth in the 4-A Southern Section Finals. Sullivan, who competed on 
the junior varsity golf team his freshman and sophomore years, attended a 
tryout for the varsity team, but failed to make it. Butler convinced him that 
putting some extra mileage in on the track team would improve his running. 
</P>
<P>
During the spring, Sullivan ran 4:27 for 1,600 meters, finishing second in the 
South Coast League finals. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan's new-found confidence carried over to this year's cross-country 
season. At the Dana Hills Invitational on Sept. 29, Sullivan surprised Butler 
again. He finished second in a time of 15:00, nine seconds behind Niednagel, 
moving to sixth on Dana Hills' all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
"I simply didn't think of Brendan as a guy who could run with the top four or 
five guys on our all-time list," Butler said. "I didn't think he was in the 
same class." 
</P>
<P>
Neither did Niednagel. 
</P>
<P>
"I finished the race, turned around and he was right behind me," Niednagel 
said. "I knew he was good and he was getting better, but not that much better." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, who holds a 3.5 grade-point average, is the senior class president 
and wants to attend an Ivy League school. He has also caught the eye of college 
coaches. Bob Rothenberg, the men's cross-country and track coach at Brown 
University, is one. 
</P>
<P>
"He seems to have improved an awful lot since last year -- the difference is 
considerable and I think part of that is due to training with good people," 
Rothenberg said. "That is an advantage he has." 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg, who coached former University High runner Greg Whiteley, a 
five-time National Collegiate Athletic Assn. All-American in cross-country and 
track, said he prefers working with a "late bloomer." 
</P>
<P>
"There are two ends of the spectrum," he said. "For instance, take a runner who 
has worked many years and has been doing double workouts for years. He knows 
how to train hard, but is he a finished project? Or there's the runner who is 
just starting to improve and it's exciting to see. I would rather see someone 
who has a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg sees Sullivan as such a prospect. 
</P>
<P>
"Cross-country is the type of sport that if you work hard, you will improve," 
Rothenberg said. "If your heart is big and you are into running, you will be 
successful. And I have a feeling that Brendan has an awful big heart." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan's goals this year include helping Dana Hills, which has won six 
consecutive South Coast League championships, qualify for the Nov. 10 Southern 
Section prelims in Walnut. He hopes to run faster than his best time of 16:41.

TOM CARVEL; ICE CREAM MAGNATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
PINE PLAINS, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Carvel, founder of the Carvel chain of ice cream stores who was widely 
known for his gravel-voiced pitches for his product in TV and radio ads, died 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Carvel, 84, sold the Carvel Corp. chain for more than $80 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
He died about 1:30 p.m. at his home in Pine Plains, a rural community about 100 
miles north of New York City. The cause of death was not immediately available, 
but authorities in Dutchess County said Carvel had a history of heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
Carvel, who founded Carvel Corp. in 1938, sold his 99% share to an investment 
bank, Investcorp, in November. 
</P>
<P>
Based on annual sales, Carvel is the third-largest ice cream store chain in the 
country after Dairy Queen and Haagen-Dazs. The Yonkers, N.Y.-based Carvel has 
more than 700 stores, most of them in New York, Florida, Connecticut, 
Massachusetts, New Jersey and other East Coast states. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Greece on July 14, 1906, Carvel emigrated to the United States with his 
family when he was 4 and settled in New York. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1920s, Carvel played drums in a Dixieland band, worked as an auto 
mechanic and drove an ice cream truck before opening his first ice cream store 
in Westchester County. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1920s, Carvel developed the first machine for making soft ice cream, 
and later sold the machine to store owners. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Agnes. They had no children. Funeral arrangements 
are pending.

13-YEAR-OLD MAKES VALIANT BUT FUTILE EFFORT TO SAVE A LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An elderly Tierrasanta woman died Sunday, despite the efforts of a 13-year-old 
girl who performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation while receiving instructions 
over the telephone from a 911 dispatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Jessica Dale, whose father is a radioman on the aircraft carrier Independence, 
was selling magazine subscriptions near her home in the Murphy Canyon military 
housing complex at 3:20 p.m. when she knocked on the door of a house on Fino 
Drive, a San Diego Fire Department spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Jessica heard the television on and looked through the screen door to see a 
76-year-old woman lying unconscious on the floor, the spokeswoman said. The 
woman's name was being withheld pending notification of her relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Jessica said an 8-year-old friend with her became frightened and ran home, but 
that she went inside and called 911. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought she had just passed out, so I patted her hand to try and wake her 
up," Jessica said. "But she wasn't moving . . . " 
</P>
<P>
With the emergency dispatcher instructing her, Jessica said, she pulled a piece 
of apple from the woman's mouth and performed CPR, which she had never done 
before. 
</P>
<P>
"She wasn't breathing and she was bleeding (from striking her head when she 
fell) and tangled in her walker, so I couldn't get her turned over right away," 
Jessica said. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics and police arrived two minutes later and took over the life-saving 
efforts, but the woman, who regained a pulse in the ambulance, died of cardiac 
arrest at Sharp Memorial Hospital, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics were so impressed with Jessica's maturity and calm behavior in 
performing CPR that they nominated her for a Fire Department lifesaving award, 
the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still shaking," Jessica said six hours after the incident. "I was thinking 
only about trying to help her." 
</P>
<P>
Jessica's mother, Mary, said she was not surprised by her daughter's actions. 
</P>
<P>
"She is very assertive and aggressive and eager to help," Dale said. "I told 
her God wanted her to be there for a reason, to try to help that woman." 
</P>
<P>
Jessica, who attends Gasper DePortola Junior High School, was visibly shaken 
when police took her home after the incident, but Dale said the kind words of 
police, paramedics and the elderly's woman's daughter and grandson, who also is 
a paramedic, had reassured her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she needed to know that she did her best," Dale said. "She is very 
upset the woman died, but she knows she did all she could."

SAVINGS PLANS CALLED SAFE BET FOR MIGRANTS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: A LEGAL ASSISTANCE GROUP IS URGING WORKERS TO TRUST THEIR MONEY TO BANKS 
RATHER THAN LOSE IT TO ROBBERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Vicente Morales died angry. A bullet pierced his chest less than two weeks ago 
during an armed robbery of six North County migrant laborers. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives say a man and woman surprised the group inside a darkened barn in 
rural Valley Center. As two fellow workers nervously emptied their pockets, the 
35-year-old Mexican native got mad. He took one small, fateful step toward the 
robbers. 
</P>
<P>
The man opened fire. Morales died almost instantly as the thieves sped off into 
the night with their take: $90. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 35 miles away in a small Oceanside office, Claudia Smith has grown 
weary of such violence -- the robberies, stabbings and the deaths -- that 
authorities say are on the increase in isolated migrant camps across the North 
County. 
</P>
<P>
And she knows why the crimes are happening. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for California Rural Legal Assistance, or CRLA, a migrants rights 
group, Smith and her small staff have visited countless local laborer camps. 
She's seen the way many workers spirit away their hard-earned pay -- stashed in 
mattresses, sewn into the lining of clothes or buried in spider holes. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Smith escorted a handful of workers on a mission she hopes others 
will follow, one that might spread the word to would-be thieves that migrant 
camps aren't going to be such lucrative territory from now on: 
</P>
<P>
They opened savings accounts. 
</P>
<P>
With the cooperation of two local banks, Smith has embarked on a program to 
persuade the county's estimated 12,000 migrant laborers that there are much 
safer ways to keep their cash than stuffed in their pants pockets. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of our clients have told us about being robbed, ambushed by people who 
seem to know when they get paid," Smith said. "And there were all those people 
who lost their savings when their camp burned to the ground last year in Rancho 
Penasquitos. We figured something had to be done." 
</P>
<P>
The banking campaign is being waged on two fronts, Smith said. She wants to 
clear up the confusion many laborers have about how banks operate -- as well as 
persuade North County bank branches that migrants are loyal customers whose 
business is worth recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these workers don't trust banks because they've never dealt with 
them," she said. "Many are from deep in the heart of Mexico, from little 
villages where people pay cash, where they have their money in hand." 
</P>
<P>
CRLA community worker Gloria Soto added: "And many smaller banks in North 
County don't have bilingual tellers. Many haven't felt that the migrant dollar 
was worth the effort. That's the attitude we're trying to change." 
</P>
<P>
With the help of a $15,000 grant from the Bank of America Consumer Education 
Fund, CRLA workers have distributed 3,000 comic books throughout Oceanside, 
Carlsbad and Encinitas, using humorous cartoon characters such as Chucho the 
thinking dog to spread their banking message: "It's preferable to prevent than 
to lament." 
</P>
<P>
Public service announcements also have been broadcast on two Spanish-language 
North County radio stations. And a local theater group has performed skits 
before several migrant audiences to drive the point home. 
</P>
<P>
In each case, in the lively slang used by most migrants, the characters tell 
how robberies have stripped them of the necessary cash to return home to see 
their families or send them gifts. 
</P>
<P>
The spots also stress the requirements most banks have for opening accounts -- 
such as valid identification and, often, a post office box or permanent 
address. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said North County's migrant population is unique because most live in 
isolated encampments -- and are considered homeless by most bankers -- instead 
of living in apartments like workers in other parts of the state. 
</P>
<P>
CRLA workers have gone to camps to answer the questions laborers have about 
placing their savings into the hands of others. The hope, Smith says, is that 
respected migrant leaders will take the initiative and that, in time, the rest 
will follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
But, for many workers, questions remain. Although most are amused by Chucho the 
talking dog's remarks in the comic book, they nonetheless have concerns over 
how they could reach their savings on nights or weekends. And just who gets 
their money if they're ever killed? 
</P>
<P>
"A few were afraid that they were going to be sent off to war and that the bank 
would keep their money," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"So, before we talked about banking, we had to convince them that a whole 
battalion of North County migrant workers wasn't going to be sent off to Iraq 
as a secret weapon against Saddam Hussein." 
</P>
<P>
Smith's campaign has gone beyond migrant campfires -- to the board rooms of 
area banks as well. 
</P>
<P>
CRLA has sent letters to eight North County bank branches near large migrant 
encampments to explain the need for providing Spanish-speaking employees who 
can communicate with the functionally illiterate. 
</P>
<P>
So far, three local branches of Union Bank and Bank of America have agreed to 
take part in the program to encourage migrant customers by such methods as 
providing passbooks and reducing the initial deposit needed to open an account 
from $100 to $25. They also have agreed to accept post-office boxes as an 
address. 
</P>
<P>
Smith hopes other banks will show compassion for workers who might want to use 
their services but don't understand how they work. 
</P>
<P>
"Not surprisingly," her letter says, "opening a new account is the most 
daunting barrier our clients encounter." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, she said, several local bank branches have refused to cash 
migrants' checks -- sometimes even those drawn on the bank itself. 
</P>
<P>
"A big problem was communication," Smith said. "Or the worker didn't have a 
street address. Or the teller wasn't familiar with the resident alien card the 
worker was using for identification. 
</P>
<P>
"She may look at him and say 'How did this man get this much money?' I had to 
put some workers in the car and take them down there to work it out. Sometimes, 
I had to give the bank my address to get the check cashed." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Bliesner, reinvestment director for a city-county task force that recently 
examined area banking practices, said many banks have simply chosen to ignore 
the migrant customer. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't provided a service to that segment of the population in the same 
way they have to others," he said. "The banks have been inadequate. But 
migrants also need some education about the services available. It's a two-way 
street." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Petermann, a district administrator for Bank of America, said local 
branch managers have always been aware of the unique circumstances of the 
migrant customer. 
</P>
<P>
"But there hasn't been attention focused on the issue from high-level 
management," he said. "Some people in the industry probably have concluded that 
the migrant dollar wasn't worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"But our banks are doing what they can to serve their areas, even if it is a 
small market niche. The way we look at it, it's not only the moral thing to do, 
it's good business." 
</P>
<P>
Support for the banking program has come from law enforcement as well. 
</P>
<P>
While statistics are hard to come by, authorities say that violent crimes 
against migrant workers are on the rise in the county. Opportunists have often 
raided isolated migrant camps after paydays and made off with huge hauls. 
</P>
<P>
Savings accounts for migrants might discourage such crimes, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the perfect victims," Lt. Bill Flores, commander of the San Diego 
County Sheriff Department's Fallbrook substation, said of the migrant workers. 
"They set up camps in the middle of nowhere with no access to telephones. 
They're in areas where it's hard for patrol cars to reach. 
</P>
<P>
"Many robbers know when they get paid. They raid the camps -- it's just been 
too easy for them. But we don't hear about most of these crimes because the 
workers don't report them due to the language barrier and concern over their 
immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in support of any program that would take the attention away from these 
people as easy marks." 
</P>
<P>
For Smith and her staff, however, the going has not been easy. They have been 
forced to return several times to some encampments to reason with skittish 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
Many workers are more concerned with trips home for the holidays than opening 
accounts. But Smith hopes that many will return with a new plan for protecting 
their savings. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not kidding ourselves," she said. "It's a long-term project to change 
the way people think -- and to wait for the message to spread by word of mouth. 
We just never dreamed we'd have to make so many visits to the camps. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're getting the workers to mull it over. And that's a first step." 
</P>
<P>
In time, Smith hopes that banks countywide will take part in her program. "We 
want to make the point with them that these people are worth their time. 
They're very loyal customers. I see it as a real opportunity for the banks." 
</P>
<P>
And possibly someday, she says, North County migrant workers will be served by 
their own credit union. 
</P>
<P>
"For now it's only whimsy, but we'd like to have things like bus transportation 
to credit union offices. And maybe loans for small businesses migrant workers 
might decide to launch and money we could offer if emergencies occur back home. 
</P>
<P>
"It'd be a way for these workers to feel that they, too, had a piece of the 
rock."

ELECTIONS 21ST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
FREIMAN NEEDS A FLURRY OF GOP DEFECTIONS TO UPSET GALLEGLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAYERENE BARKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democrat Richard D. Freiman is counting on a voters' revolt in his race against 
Rep. Elton Gallegly in the 21st Congressional District. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of crossover support," said Freiman, 42, who is running an 
energetic, but low-budget, campaign. "There's an anti-incumbency feeling out 
there. This is a year for challengers. People out there are fed up with the 
status quo." 
</P>
<P>
However, even at a time when pollsters say voters are growing increasingly 
dissatisfied with their congressional representatives, Freiman will have to win 
the support of several thousand GOP voters if he is to unseat Republican 
Gallegly, a former mayor of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The 21st District, one of the heaviest Republican strongholds in California, 
stretches from Ojai to Sunland-Tujunga and covers some of the most conservative 
suburbs in northern and western Los Angeles County and southern and eastern 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 339,252 voters, only 36.83% are Democrats, while 52.5% are Republicans, 
and Gallegly easily defeated Democratic challengers in the last two general 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Freiman, who is conducting what he calls a "real, old-fashioned, 
get-out-to-the-people campaign," remains optimistic about his chances. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've got a shot at it," he said. "I've been campaigning full time 
since May. I'm going from one end of the district to the other, door-to-door, 
standing in front of K mart, meeting the people. And they like it." 
</P>
<P>
Freiman quit his job as a tax attorney with a Camarillo firm last spring after 
his bosses told him to choose between working or campaigning full time. 
</P>
<P>
To support his family, Freiman, who is married and has two young sons, returned 
to his previous vocation as a television writer. His earnings helped him pay 
for a cable television commercial that will air before the election. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote the whole thing and shot it myself," he said. "It only cost me $250." 
</P>
<P>
In all, Freiman said he has raised about $11,300 for his campaign, a far cry 
from the more than $200,000 his opponent has amassed for the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Gallegly, 46, has campaigned very little, preferring to remain in 
the nation's capital where lawmakers are wrestling with the complexities of the 
federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly, who was first elected in 1986, has good reason to be complacent about 
his chances of retaining his job. In the 1988 general election, he trounced his 
Democratic opponent, Donald E. Stevens, 69% to 29%. 
</P>
<P>
In the June primary, Gallegly fought back a challenge from wealthy developer 
Sang Korman for a second time, even though Korman spent about $250,000. After 
campaigning hardly at all, Gallegly spent $14,800 on last-minute cable 
television commercials to counter Korman's TV spots attacking the incumbent's 
voting record. In the end, Gallegly received 68.4% of the vote to Korman's 
31.6%. 
</P>
<P>
But the congressman, who has a solid conservative voting record, has revealed 
no plans for any similar eleventh-hour efforts in his campaign against Freiman. 
So far, he has declined to appear at any candidates' forums with his opponent. 
</P>
<P>
The two candidates differ on many issues and Freiman has attempted to 
capitalize on those differences. For example, Freiman favors abortion rights 
unconditionally. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly said the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion makes 
abortions too freely available. He also said that he "will continue to oppose 
measures that would encourage or facilitate abortion through federal funding." 
</P>
<P>
"He's out of the mainstream," Freiman said of his opponent. "As we approach the 
21st Century, my opponent's still living in the 19th Century." 
</P>
<P>
The issue closest to home on which the candidates differ is the controversial 
proposal to exchange National Park Service land in Cheeseboro Canyon for 
private land owned by entertainer Bob Hope so developers can build an expensive 
housing project. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly repeatedly has refused to take a stand on the issue, saying he doesn't 
believe federal officials should become involved in local land-use planning. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the ballot is Libertarian Peggy Christensen, a cardiovascular care 
consultant from Granada Hills.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: 21ST DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Questionnaires were distributed to candidates this month. Answers have been 
edited to fit the available space. 
</P>
<P>
Mideast Crisis 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you generally support President Bush's handling of the Mideast crisis 
precipitated by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait? Briefly 
explain any differences you have with Bush's actions. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman: Yes. President Bush has hinted at linking settlement of the 
Israeli-Palestinian situation with the settlement of the Persian Gulf crisis. I 
am opposed to any such linkage. I would also like to see Saudi Arabia pick up 
more of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimate Goal 
</P>
<P>
Q. Should the ultimate goal of the United States be to force Iraq to withdraw 
from Kuwait? Or should it be to remove Saddam Hussein from power or at least 
greatly reduce his military capacity, either through war or negotiations? 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly: I support the President's call for Iraq's unconditional withdrawal 
from Kuwait. Ultimately, as long as Hussein remains a threat to world peace and 
stability, efforts should be made to see to it that he doesn't remain in power. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman: Hussein is a threat to the entire region. Were it not for Israel, he 
would be threatening the region with the use of nuclear weapons. In conjunction 
with the United Nations, we must either try to remove him from power or make 
sure he is not capable of developing nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Weapons Sale 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support the Bush Administration's proposal to sell billions of 
dollars of additional weapons, including F-15 fighters, TOW missiles and Apache 
helicopters, to Saudi Arabia? 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly: I am closely studying this proposal. I recognize that the Saudis have 
legitimate security considerations, but at the same time, I believe we must be 
selective in arms sales to Arab nations. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman: No. We should just provide, either by sale or lease, Saudi Arabia with 
the weapons that are absolutely essential to them in this current crisis. We 
must remember that Saudi Arabia maintains a state of belligerency toward 
Israel, our staunchest ally in the region. 
</P>
<P>
B-2 Bomber Production 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you favor continued production of the B-2 Stealth bomber beyond the 15 
already in production? 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman: No. With our deficit problems, the B-2 must be adequately tested 
before increasing production. 
</P>
<P>
Deficit Reduction 
</P>
<P>
Q. President Bush and congressional leaders recently agreed to a compromise 
package of tax increases and spending cuts designed to reduce the federal 
budget deficit by $40 billion this fiscal year and $500 billion over the next 
five years. This deal, if it gains final congressional approval, would increase 
taxes on gasoline, cigarettes and alcohol; raise Medicare premiums; impose a 
new tax on luxury goods, and reduce itemized deductions that can be taken by 
taxpayers with incomes over $100,000. Do you support his plan? If no, why not? 
What specific actions would you support to cut the federal budget deficit? 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly: No. I voted against the budget resolution because it was the largest 
peacetime tax increase in U.S. history and because the elderly bore too great a 
burden. I support the "4% solution" limiting government spending increases to 
4% a year with no new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman: No. It's unfair to lower-, middle- and upper-middle income taxpayers, 
as well as senior citizens. I would restore progressivity to the tax code so 
that the richest 1% pay their fair share of taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign Spending 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support efforts to restrict campaign spending and reduce the amount 
of contributions that can be made by special interest groups? 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly: Yes. I support reducing the amount that political action committees 
can give, and I also support requiring candidates to raise at least half of 
their funds from individuals living within their districts. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman: Yes. However, the Supreme Court has stated that spending limits in 
congressional races are unconstitutional unless tied to public financing. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign Financing 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support full or partial taxpayer financing of political campaigns? 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly: No. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Capital Punishment 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support capital punishment? If so, do you think it should be imposed 
on those convicted of importing or selling drugs? 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly: Yes. Yes for drug kin-pins. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman: Yes. No on drugs offenses. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support a woman's unrestricted right to an abortion within the first 
three months of pregnancy? 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly: The Supreme Court, for 1973, essentially legalized abortion at any 
time during a pregnancy. I oppose the scope of that decision, and I will 
continue to oppose measures that would encourage or facilitate abortion through 
federal funding. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion Funding 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support federal funding of abortions for women who cannot afford 
them? 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly: No. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Unpaid Leave 
</P>
<P>
Q. President Bush in July vetoed legislation that would have required 
businesses employing at least 50 people to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid 
leave per year for childbirth, adoption or serious illness to employees or 
immediate family members. Do you favor this or similar legislation? 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly: No. While well-intentioned, this issue should best be resolved 
through the employer-employee bargaining process. It would cost thousands of 
jobs by forcing many small firms out of business. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman: No. A woman should not be forced to choose between terminating her 
pregnancy and keeping her job. Similarly, a woman or a man should not have to 
choose between taking care of an ill child, spouse or parent or adopting a 
child and losing his or her job. 
</P>
<P>
Oil Exploration 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think the present Mideast crisis justifies opening up additional 
parts of the California coastline to oil exploration? 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly: No. At this time, I do not believe the Persian Gulf situation 
warrants opening up the California coast to more oil drilling. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman: No. We have adequate supplies. Instead of using this crisis as an 
excuse to drill in environmentally sensitive areas, we should realize that it's 
time to develop a sound energy policy incorporating conservation and 
development of alternative sources of energy. 
</P>
<P>
Assault Rifle Ban 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you favor extending President Bush's ban on the import of semiautomatic 
assault rifles to the domestic production of such weapons? 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly: No. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting Period 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you favor a seven-day waiting period on the purchase of handguns to 
permit background checks on buyers' criminal and mental health records? 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly: Yes. It is a moot issue in California, which already has a 15-day 
waiting period. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Endowment Restrictions 
</P>
<P>
Q. Should Congress impose any content restrictions on obscene or indecent 
materials in reauthorizing the National Endowment for the Arts? 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly: Yes. The issue is not censorship, it's how tax dollars are spent. I 
do not believe that tax dollars should be used to support obscene or indecent 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman: No. 
</P>
<P>
Arts Support 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think the federal government should continue to support the arts 
through the NEA? 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly: Yes. There is a limited federal role in the arts, but only so long as 
the process is cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman: Yes. The NEA provides support to nonprofit organizations and 
individuals in dance, design arts, folk arts, literature, media arts, museums, 
opera and musical theater and visual arts. 
</P>
<P>
Civil Rights Legislation 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support civil rights legislation passed last month by the House that 
would give women and blacks who are victims of sexual or racial harassment in 
the workplace the right to sue their employer in federal court? 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly: No. There is no place for sexual or racial harassment, and I fully 
support criminal and civil statutes against such actions. This bill, however, 
mainly deals with discrimination issues. As the attorney general has indicated, 
it would force businesses and other organizations to impose de facto quotas in 
order to avoid being sued on discrimination charges. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman: Yes. As I am opposed to any type of discrimination or harassment, I 
believe that employees must have the opportunity to bring an action in federal 
court against their employer. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-Crime Legislation 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support anti-crime legislation passed by the Senate in July that 
would re-establish the federal death penalty, limit Death-Row inmates' appeals 
and relax the exclusionary rule that prohibits the use of illegally seized 
evidence in criminal trials? 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly: Absolutely. I believe the death penalty is a deterrent, and more 
importantly, is a just sentence for particularly heinous criminals. I also 
believe that while society should take all reasonable steps to ensure that a 
capital sentence is justified, there are reasonable limits to the right to 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman: Yes. The biggest crime in America is the amount of crime in America 
and we should be as tough on criminals as they are on us. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration Reform 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support immigration reform that would increase the number of visas 
allowed for family members of those who are already in the United States as 
well as skilled workers? 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly: No. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Reducing Drug Use 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you believe our present strategy of criminal prosecution, interdiction of 
supplies and imprisonment of users and dealers is significantly reducing the 
level of drug use in the United States? If no, what should be done? 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman: No. We should continue to enforce our laws strictly, but we should 
also provide sufficient funding for drug education, treatment and prevention 
programs. The best way to cut supplies is to cut demand. 
</P>
<P>
Drug Decriminalization 
</P>
<P>
Q. Would you consider supporting the decriminalization of drug use? 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly: Never. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman No. 
</P>
<P>
Limiting Terms 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support limiting the number of terms members of Congress can serve? 
If yes, what should limits be for members of the House and Senate? 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly: Because of the near impossibility of changing the makeup of Congress, 
I am reluctantly becoming convinced that some form of term limitation may be 
needed. I have not yet determined what those limits should be. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman: No. 
</P>
<P>
China Trade Status 
</P>
<P>
Q. Should the United States revoke China's most-favored-nation trading status 
until the president certifies that China has made specific human rights 
progress? 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly: No. Because the ban on military sales and technical cooperation 
continues, I am supporting legislation to recertify China's most-favored-nation 
status, but only for a limited period of time and tied to substantial future 
progress in human rights standards. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman: Yes. Most-favored-nation trading status is a benefit to China. China 
must earn this by giving the people of China basic human rights. 
</P>
<P>
Land Exchange 
</P>
<P>
Q. Should the National Park Service exchange 59 acres in Ventura County for 
about 1,100 acres of the neighboring Jordan Ranch owned by entertainer Bob 
Hope, permitting park agencies to buy another 4,600 acres of Hope's land in the 
Santa Monica and Santa Susana mountains for $10 million? 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly: Although this in many ways appears to be a positive exchange, I 
believe it is at this point a local land-use planning issue. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman: No. 
</P>
<P>
Income Tax Returns 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are you willing to publicly release your income tax returns and those of 
your spouse prior to the November election? 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly: No. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman: Yes, provided the incumbent does. 
</P>
<P>
Mandatory Ride-Sharing 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you favor mandatory ride-sharing as a way of meeting federal air 
pollution standards? 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly: No. I fully support voluntary ride-sharing programs, along with other 
responsible programs to clean up the air in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman: No. However, I would encourage ride-sharing through the use of tax 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>

A SUBDUED SANTA ANA WARMS THINGS UP A BIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The slightly cooler weather that came to San Diego Friday and Saturday 
disappeared Sunday with the arrival of a weak Santa Ana that brought warmth and 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
A cold front late Thursday caused chilly nights, cloudy days and some gusting 
winds in San Diego, but the front, which earlier in the week had dropped some 
rain on the San Francisco Bay area, moved east out of the San Diego area late 
Saturday, according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
The incoming Santa Ana, although weak and fleeting, raised Sunday's high 
temperature downtown to 80 degrees, 6 above normal, and to 70 to 75 at the 
beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Other warm sites across the county Sunday included Spring Valley and Fallbrook, 
90 degrees; Santee 88; Escondido, La Mesa, Lemon Grove, Miramar, Poway, Vista 
and the Wild Animal Park 87; Alpine and Chula Vista 85. 
</P>
<P>
NWS forecaster Wilbur Shigehara predicted continued sunshine and days in the 
high 70s through midweek, and clear and cool nights as the Santa Ana slowly 
dissipates. 
</P>
<P>
Today is expected to be sunny and warm, with a high of 79. Tuesday's forecast 
calls for more sunshine and a high of 77. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight and Tuesday night are expected to be clear and cool with a low 
temperature of 57. 
</P>
<P>
Hurricane Trudy south of Baja California will stir up the ocean surf slightly 
near San Diego for the next few days, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
At the beaches, the weather is expected to be clear though Tuesday, with the 
day temperature from 70 to 76 today, 69 to 73 Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean winds are expected to be from 8 to 16 m.p.h., and the ocean temperature 
68 degrees, with the surf peaking at 4 feet at 10-second intervals, Shigehara 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the coastal strip, the temperature will reach 77 to 84 Monday and 75 to 80 
Tuesday, Shigehara said. Overnight temperatures will be from 53 to 62, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Inland valleys will have high temperatures of 88 Monday and 86 Tuesday with 
overnight lows dipping to between 42 and 52, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
The mountains are expected to have temperatures from 64 to 72 through Tuesday 
as overnight lows fall into the low 30s, bringing frost in the coldest areas. 
</P>
<P>
Desert high temperatures will be 85 to 90 through Tuesday, the lows 50 to 60, 
Shigehara said.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;

<P>
RISKY BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There now are only six Orange County cities that allow the use and sale of 
fireworks, and if voters make the right choice Nov. 6, the number could be down 
to three. It should be zero. 
</P>
<P>
On Measure L in Orange and Measure Z in Fullerton, voters can ban fireworks 
directly by voting yes. They should. 
</P>
<P>
In Costa Mesa, the ballot issue is advisory, and the wording is confusing. 
Measure W asks residents if the city should continue to allow the sale and 
discharge of "safety" approved fireworks by "nonprofit organizations within the 
city." 
</P>
<P>
Fireworks, even the so-called state-designated "safe and sane" ones, are 
anything but safe. Last year, 85% of fireworks-related injuries in Orange 
County occurred in the cities that still allowed them. Historically, cities 
where all fireworks have been banned have significantly fewer fireworks-caused 
injuries and fires. 
</P>
<P>
The other part of Costa Mesa's loaded ballot question is equally misleading. 
The fact that some community groups sell fireworks strictly to bring in extra 
money doesn't make them any safer. Youngsters are the main victims of fireworks 
injuries, whatever the legitimate fund-raising motives of youth groups. Vote no 
on Measure W. 
</P>
<P>
Outlawing fireworks in all cities, except for public displays, makes it easier 
to enforce existing bans. We hope efforts to do that will ignite similar moves 
in Santa Ana, Garden Grove and Buena Park. Finally, fireworks sales would be 
illegal countywide.

OVERTIME GOAL KEYS UCLA WIN OVER WAKE FOREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Freshman Joe-Max Moore's goal in the seventh minute of overtime Sunday sparked 
third-ranked UCLA to a 2-0 victory over Wake Forest for the championship of the 
sixth annual UCLA-Met Life Classic soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The shot by midfielder Moore from 15 yards in front of the goal came after the 
teams were scoreless in regulation. Freshman Sean Henderson's header in the 
100th minute provided the final goal. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA improved to 13-1-3. Wake Forest fell to 8-6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, who had three assists in the Bruins' 3-0 victory over Air Force Friday 
night, was named the tournament's offensive most valuable player. Wake Forest's 
Craig Conger was defensive MVP.

SENNA SEALS FORMULA ONE TITLE ON THE FIRST TURN IN JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Victory for race driver Ayrton Senna came suddenly Sunday at Suzuka, Japan. 
Even before he turned the first corner, he was the Formula One driving 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian's rival, Alain Prost of France, crashed his red Ferrari into 
Senna's McLaren-Honda, sending parts flying only seconds after the start of the 
Japanese Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
Because neither driver could finish, Senna walked away with the title. His 
points lead is big enough that even if Prost wins the season's final race at 
Adelaide, Australia, on Nov. 4, he can't overtake Senna. 
</P>
<P>
It was a turnabout. Prost won his third Formula One championship in the 
Japanese race last season when Senna was disqualified after a crash between the 
two. Winning Sunday's race, the 15th of the 16-race Formula One season, was 
Brazil's Nelson Piquet, a three-time champion who prevailed in a Benetton-Ford. 
Piquet averaged 123.077 m.p.h. for 53 laps of the 3.64-mile Suzuka layout. 
</P>
<P>
Prost blamed Senna for the crash. Senna said it could have been avoided if the 
pole position had been changed from the right to the left side of the track as 
he had requested before the race. 
</P>
<P>
Senna argued that the right side was dirtier and more difficult for a right 
turn soon after the start. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Kulwicki, taking advantage of a last-minute caution flag, outlasted Bill 
Elliott to break a two-year winless streak and capture the AC-Delco 500 NASCAR 
race at Rockingham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
In the race for the season driving championship, second-place Dale Earnhardt 
gained only four points on leader Mark Martin, who leads, 4,120-4,075, with two 
races to run. 
</P>
<P>
Earnhardt was 10th Sunday and Martin was 11th. 
</P>
<P>
Kulwicki won $53,300 and averaged 125.378 m.p.h. for the 492-lap race.

BUTTS HELPS OFFENSE GET OFF GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PATTERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Strong fellow, this Marion Butts. 
</P>
<P>
He takes 248 pounds with him wherever he goes. And, as if it isn't enough that 
he's as big as a soda pop machine, he also will be responsible for lugging the 
Chargers' offense, if their 24-9 loss on Sunday to the Raiders was an 
indication. 
</P>
<P>
The reason? Simple. The Chargers' passing game is about as smooth as the top of 
Bart Simpson's head. Quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver repeatedly drove the 
Chargers close to the end zone, then extinguished the drives with (take your 
pick) 1) overthrown passes, 2) underthrown passes, 3) throwaways. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, there was Butts, the sturdiest running back this side of 
Christian Okoye, upholding the 4.8-yard average that placed him second in the 
AFC in rushing behind Denver's Bobby Humphrey entering the game. 
</P>
<P>
Butts finished with 76 yards in 16 carries Sunday, and he did it in a manner 
that supports his contention that he's more than a 
get-in-my-way-and-I'll-flatten-you running back. He swerved around a stray 
linebacker here and there, and he frequently spun for extra yardage when he 
appeared to be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not my intention just to run over individuals," Butts said. "Sometimes 
you get caught in a situation and you have no other way out. That's like a 
person in the corner. What can you do? You can't go through the wall." 
</P>
<P>
What, then, do you do? 
</P>
<P>
"If you feel there is no way out but to go through them, then that's something 
you have to be prepared to do," he said. "It's best to be the hitter instead of 
the hittee." 
</P>
<P>
And nobody worries too much about Butts getting up from a head-on collision. 
</P>
<P>
"He's solid, he's accountable, he's durable," Charger Coach Dan Henning said. 
"We've got to go to him more, but to do that you've got to be ahead in the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to believe that the team that once had Fouts to Joiner, Fouts to J.J. 
and Fouts to Chandler is now relying on three yards and a cloud of Butts. Of 
course, the statistics don't mean a lot if the team doesn't win, and nobody is 
more aware of that than Butts. 
</P>
<P>
"My productivity comes with the team," he said. "Every loss is very 
disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
Butts isn't one to hoot and holler about his accomplishments. Asked what he 
does outside of football, he once said he stays home, because that keeps him 
out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Along with maintaining a low profile, Butts refuses to take a lot of credit for 
the Chargers' successful running game. 
</P>
<P>
"The offensive line is coming around and I'm behind them," he said. "They do a 
great job. It makes me do a great job." 
</P>
<P>
Also, he has help. Rod Bernstine is still around. Glad to be here, even. 
Bernstine, remember, mentioned a week and a half ago that he would be agreeable 
to a trade. He was the Chargers' top draft pick in 1987, and he was getting a 
little tired of carrying the ball only a handful of times in each game. But 
there was a feeling that he wasn't durable enough to be a full-timer such as 
Butts. 
</P>
<P>
If the past two games are an indication, Bernstine's situation is improving. In 
last week's 39-3 victory over the New York Jets, he carried 11 times for 80 
yards. Sunday, he carried eight times for 45 yards. 
</P>
<P>
So, for now, he's not complaining. 
</P>
<P>
"I put frustrating things aside," Bernstine said. "As long as I can go out and 
perform well, I'll get more and more time. That's all I can do." 
</P>
<P>
What the Chargers will do to make this a more balanced attack remains to be 
seen. Clearly, if they are to compete with teams in the Raiders' class, they 
will need a snappier passing game to complement Butts and Bernstine. 
</P>
<P>
As Tolliver points out, it helps to put the ball in the end zone once in a 
while. 
</P>
<P>
"In this league," he said, "you get down there and keep getting field goals, 
sooner or later it's going to beat you." 
</P>
<P>
And that's what happened Sunday.

Again?: Ron Kovic, the war hero whose story inspired the movie "Born on the 
Fourth of July," wants the United States out of the Middle East. Kovic, who 
turned against the Vietnam War after coming home in a wheelchair, has given 
copies of a 30-second TV commercial to members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
He says in the ad that U.S. troops are in the Persian Gulf "not to defend 
democracy but to protect the big oil companies . . . . We don't want another 
Vietnam . . . . Didn't we promise ourselves that we would never let this happen 
again?"

Trump Card: Donald Trump took in the opening of Jackie Mason's new one-man 
Broadway show last week and had to endure a few jokes about his friend Marla 
Maples. "Women call Marla cheap," Mason said. "Men say, 'Really? How cheap? 
Where is she?' " Maples was not in the audience, but others in the crowd 
included Alan Alda, Michael Douglas, Joan Rivers and Mike Wallace.

Wallflower: Dancing with new Supreme Court Justice David Souter may be cruel 
and unusual punishment. The quiet bachelor attended a White House dinner, but 
did not take a date. When journalist Naomi Nover asked him to dance, Souter 
politely declined. She persisted, prompting him to say, "I wouldn't put anyone 
through the torture." 
</P>

Close to the Chest: Former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, 58, who failed in his 
bid to become the first black governor of Georgia in the summer's primary 
elections, says he will "continue to be involved in the political and economic 
development of Georgia . . . . Whether that leads to another bid for governor 
would probably be determined way down the road." Young was a top aide to the 
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and a United Nations ambassador.

ANN CONWAY: SHE'S STILL COOKING; 
</P>
<P>
LUCY LUHAN'S HAPPY TO SERVE AT BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All the time, people ask her the same question: "Why don't you relax and stop 
working?" 
</P>
<P>
And all the time, Lucy Luhan -- resident of exclusive Linda Isle and wife of 
plastic surgeon Dr. Jorge Luhan -- tells them: "What would I do?" 
</P>
<P>
She'd be lost, says Luhan, operator of two Italian bistros and a 15th-Century 
farmhouse-turned-bed-and-breakfast in Tuscany. 
</P>
<P>
"People tell me I could relax -- sit back in the sun!" she says, brown eyes 
flashing. 
</P>
<P>
No way. "I think that's the biggest problem around here. People are bored to 
death. There's too much affluence and too much leisure time," Luhan says. 
</P>
<P>
Superstars like Madonna and Cher are glad Luhan likes life in the hurried lane. 
So are David Letterman and O.J. Simpson. All have caught a bite of Luhan's 
famous pasta at Luciana's Ristorante, her sizzling-hot bistro in Dana Point. 
Ditto television newscasters Bree Walker and Jim Lampley. The couple staged 
their wedding rehearsal dinner at Luciana's a few months ago. Not to mention 
local social celebs such as Judie and George Argyros, Mary and James Roosevelt, 
and Margaret and Carl Karcher. All have enjoyed cooking supervised by Luhan. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, Luhan combined the best of her other venues -- her What's 
Cooking? eatery in Newport Beach and her Italian podere (farmhouse) in 
Montevettolini -- when she hosted a benefit for the Orange Coast Interfaith 
Shelter for homeless families. 
</P>
<P>
Not only were guests able to feast al fresco on pizza, lamb, chicken and pork, 
they got to savor the kind of pasta Luhan is famous for: stuffed ravioli -- 
1,000 of them -- whipped up by Luhan and her mother. ("Mother says the warmth 
of our hands makes the pasta taste better than a machine does," she whispers. ) 
And, guests got to bid on a stay at Luhan's seven-bedroom farmhouse, with its 
14-acre olive grove and its proximity to Florence, Pisa, Vinci, and Montecatini 
Terme -- probably Europe's most popular spa town. 
</P>
<P>
Luhan starts to giggle when she recalls the day she told Jorge about the 
farmhouse. She'd been to Italy for a restaurant convention and learned the old 
house was for sale. Since her three children -- Michelle, Jorge and Jason -- 
were studying in Europe at the time, Luhan was hungering for a "European base," 
she says. She put a deposit on the place. 
</P>
<P>
When she returned to Newport Beach, Jorge asked if she'd done any shopping. She 
had, she answered, but she'd left it in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how Jorge found out about the farmhouse," Luhan says, smiling. "He 
didn't believe me. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we both love having the farmhouse in our life. The farmers there have 
taught us that the simple and natural life can be a beautiful life." 
</P>
<P>
When she bought the place, Luhan thought Montevettolini was a town occupied 
only by olive and grape harvesters. She soon learned it was the spot where the 
famous Borghese family holes up in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
And now, Sylvester Stallone is dating a member of the Borghese clan and 
celebrities are beginning to haunt Montevettolini, Luhan says. 
</P>
<P>
And, thanks to her bed-and-breakfast, so are some of Orange County's most 
discerning travelers. Chapman College activists Rusty and Bill Hood recently 
spent two weeks there. Furniture mogul Jim Glabman and his wife, Barbara, 
visited last spring. Orange County Performing Arts Center board member Timothy 
Strader and his wife, Susan, have spent a few nights. So has Irvine Co. 
executive Carol Hoffman and her husband, developer Larry Hoffman. And so has 
Irvine Co. Vice President Barbara Roppolo and her husband, Domenick. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, social activist Molly Lyon and her husband, Leon, were among 
guests dining at What's Cooking? on behalf of the Interfaith Shelter, located 
in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'll really be happy until I know that everybody has food in 
their mouths and a roof over their heads," Molly said during the wine 
reception. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Schulein, president of the shelter board, agreed, adding that the 
shelter's goal is to keep families together. The shelter, which can house 20 
families per night, helped 2,000 people last year. "We can accommodate homeless 
families for 60 days," Schulein said. "Often, we help single parents and their 
children. Once, we had a single mom come to us with her 10 children. The 
shelter makes a tremendous difference in their lives." Sixty percent of the 
shelter's funding comes from private donations, Schulein said. The remainder 
comes from grants. Dorothy Leshner and Joan Torres were co-chairwomen. 
</P>
<P>
All shook up: "They laid on an earthquake for me!" British couture fashion 
designer Zandra Rhodes was still all shook up about last week's Costa Mesa 
quake when she dined with supporters of the Mozart Camerata orchestra at the 
Center Club on Thursday night. "I was on the fourth floor at Nordstrom when it 
hit," she said, blinding in a dress smothered in glittering beads. "It packed 
quite a jolt. I said: 'What's happening?' " 
</P>
<P>
Rhodes, whose glamour-rags often grace the backs of royals such as Princess 
Diana, Princess Alexandra and Princess Margaret, was in town to help celebrate 
the Festival of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Camerata supporters, including board president James Baker III, sipped 
champagne before they settled down to a fashion show by Rhodes and a dinner of 
salmon en croute and fresh strawberries served up in a praline shell. 
</P>
<P>
Dining with Rhodes were Baker and his friend, Nancy Sorosky -- event chairwoman 
-- and Hal and Jeanette Segerstrom, Gayle Anderson and Ruth and Dr. Lock Ding. 
</P>
<P>
Guests also included committee members LaDorna Eichenberg, Wanda Egly, Eve 
Foussard, Lillie Hinde, Charles Paap (creator of the lovely floral 
centerpieces), Jerry Schroeder and Phylis Willats. 
</P>
<P>
Ami Porat is musical director of the orchestra, which kicks off its season on 
Friday at the new Irvine Barclay Theatre. Up for classical listening: Mozart's 
"Linz" symphony No. 36 and works by Rossini and Beethoven. 
</P>
<P>
"This season, Mozart is in almost every concert," Porat promised guests. "See 
you on the downbeat!"

JACK SMITH: WEEKEND TRIP TO DESERT PROVES PRIORITIES ARE IN ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In keeping with our new policy of taking mini-vacations of one or two days, 
instead of arduous global treks, my wife and I drove up to the high desert on a 
recent weekend. 
</P>
<P>
I had been invited to talk to the Friends of Copper Mountain College at Yucca 
Valley, in the Little San Bernardino Mountains above the Coachella Valley. 
</P>
<P>
On a Saturday morning the San Bernardino Freeway was easy going. We stopped for 
lunch at the Farm House in Beaumont. It turned out to be an excellent 
restaurant full of farm house implements and charm. I had a forbidden chili 
dog. When one is on holiday one is entitled to break a few rules. 
</P>
<P>
Turning north on the Twentynine Palms Highway (California 62) we began to climb 
a desert valley between hills that were covered with thousands of 
power-generating windmills, their silver tri-blades turning in the wind. There 
is something eerie about the sight of these machines working silently to reward 
investors, though I'm told they haven't reduced power bills in the area yet. It 
would take a thousand Don Quixotes to vanquish them. 
</P>
<P>
Morongo Valley was the first settlement. A wide place in the road. As I 
remember, it didn't even have a stop sign. It soon vanished in the desert. 
Eight miles farther on we came to Yucca Valley. Forty years ago Yucca Valley 
was a gas station and a bar. It is still hardly more than a wide place in the 
road -- a five-mile stretch of highway with houses and other structures making 
an urban corridor of about a quarter mile on either side. 
</P>
<P>
Within those five miles Yucca Valley offers most of the institutions that 
sustain life. Doctors', lawyers' and real estate offices, hardware stores, 
liquor stores, shoe stores, a K mart, a McDonald's, a Taco Bell, Vons, Home 
Savings, Pomona First Federal, Carl's Jr., Bank of America, World Savings, a 
Sizzler, Bob's Big Boy, Burger King, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Denny's, Pic 'n 
Save, American Savings and a motel (one of several) called Oasis of Eden. 
</P>
<P>
The residential structures spread out on either side of this lifeline and are 
sustained by it as the settlements of the Egyptian desert are sustained by the 
Nile. The housing frenzy that has seized the coastal towns has not reached 
these high desert communities. Residences are modest, and I saw no signs of 
massive new construction. 
</P>
<P>
Nine miles beyond Yucca Valley, Joshua Tree also clings to the highway. It is 
only a mile long, and its biggest enterprise is a K mart. All of a sudden 
Joshua Tree ends, and the land beyond the last street reverts to desert brush 
and Joshua trees. 
</P>
<P>
We took the last street and drove to the home of our hostess, Leota Bell, in 
whose guest house we were to spend the night. Her friend, photographer Harry 
Laugharn, drove us three miles farther on to the Copper Mountain College. 
</P>
<P>
The college is a campus of College of the Desert, a community college at Palm 
Desert in the Coachella Valley. It stands on a rise below Copper Mountain, 
utterly isolated in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
It is a handsome group of low, dark brown block buildings surrounding grass 
courtyards planted with sycamore trees. It is an educational and geographic 
oasis. 
</P>
<P>
We were given a tour by Owen Gillick, executive director of development, and 
Jim Pulliam, provost of the college. (While technically it is a campus of the 
mother college, everybody in the valley calls it Copper Mountain College.) 
</P>
<P>
Their pride is understandable. Against every kind of odds, including the 
devasting effect of Proposition 13, the people of the high desert towns, 
including Twentynine Palms, 12 miles farther east, got the college built. At 
the outset, they raised $1 million in gifts and pledges for the initial 
construction in 1983. A second classroom unit was built in 1988; a library and 
student center are on the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
The supporting communities number only about 45,000 people, but the college has 
3,600 students. Many are older people who have returned to complete their 
educations. Many are Marines from the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center at 
Twentynine Palms. Marines graded the 120-acre site free. (The transfer of 4,000 
Marines to Saudi Arabia has hurt business in the desert towns.) 
</P>
<P>
The college offers not only a liberal arts program but also Registered Nursing 
and automobile technology programs that are among the best in the state. 
(Graduate nurses are recruited like star athletes.) 
</P>
<P>
The building of this college, especially in times like these when funds are 
scarce and 60 million Americans are illiterate, seems to me to be an 
inspirational accomplishment. It sustains my faith that the American spirit 
still lives, and that some of us still have our priorities right. Education 
should be a primary goal of a democracy. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday morning we had breakfast with some locals at Joshua Tree's finest -- 
the Bull 'n Spear -- and drove back to the metropolis past thousands of new 
houses that looked as multitudinous as windmills.

CHINA PUSHES CLIFFIE OVER EDGE; 
</P>
<P>
THE EARLY ARRIVAL OF DREAMS, BY ROSEMARY MAHONEY. FAWCETT. $18.95, 256 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLYN SEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Henry Miller once said that an American is never more American than when he 
arrives in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Surely Rosemary Mahoney, author of "The Early Arrival of Dreams," was never 
more East Coast, more Bostonian, more Radcliffian, than when she went, in the 
school year before the Tian An Men Square uprising in Beijing, to teach English 
as part of an exchange program at Hangzhou University in the People's Republic 
of China. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes you can't escape the thought: God help China. Bogged down by 
governmental corruption, still engaged in throwing off a feudal system that has 
endured for thousands of years, still -- at some level -- dealing with 
after-effects of World War II, and still fitfully fiddling with a "Communist" 
system that "works" far better in some years than it does in others. 
</P>
<P>
And if all that weren't enough, having to endure the cool appraisals of 
26-year-old ladies from Radcliffe who come into the country and begin totting 
up judgments. 
</P>
<P>
The "Foreign Languages Department in Hangzhou University fills Mahoney with 
"horror and fascination . . . there were gaping holes in the ceiling where 
light fixtures should have been, door knobs hadn't been put into place . . . " 
-- things like that. 
</P>
<P>
When Mahoney journeys to Shanghai, she finds that there too, the Foreign 
Language School is a "brutal concrete compound." On a train trip, she's 
scandalized to find that she's traveling on a single-track system. And of 
course, in Hangzhou, although she and her fellow American English teacher are 
issued a two-bedroom apartment, one of the bedrooms is used for storage, so one 
has to sleep in the living room. Not only that, the air conditioning doesn't 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Things are tough. Potholes in the streets. Chunks of concrete lying around. 
Workers teetering on bamboo scaffolds. Inefficiency is rampant. People don't 
proofread their exams before they hand them out. Some of the English teachers 
don't even really speak English. Those toilets the Chinese are using are really 
just holes in the floor, and they smell bad. Not Boston. Not Boston at all 
(except maybe in the crummier parts of Boston, but forget that!) 
</P>
<P>
Mahoney finds fault with the English texts for her classes: "They subtly 
illustrated that the lifestyle of the West was undesirable and unjust. . . . 
One essay dwelt on the virtual slave status of the Chinese in 19th-Century 
America, on their role as cooks and launderers in gold-mining villages." 
(Where's the propaganda here? Who is getting defamed? What are you trying to 
say -- that Americans treated Chinese well? Why sure! That's why Chinese 
wife-smuggling was a growth industry in the American West up through the 1930s. 
That's why Chinese weren't allowed to "breed" in California. That's why Chinese 
couldn't marry Americans until after the end of World War II. Of course, 
Mahoney might take an equally dim Bostonian view of that eventual California 
folly, too.) 
</P>
<P>
Heavy Hitters on the back of this book seemed to love it a lot: John Barth, 
Doris Grumbach, even Robert Coles, who must have seen a few tin cans in the 
mean American streets he writes about. 
</P>
<P>
I don't get it. Hangzhou is one of the most beautiful cities in China, along 
the banks of one of the most beautiful lakes in the world. But the author just 
can't get past those brimming spittoons she finds everywhere. She is 
scandalized at every turn. She does have two extremely endearing qualities: 
She's fiercely loyal to her own students, who return the compliment, and she 
works hard on her own command of the Chinese language, so that by the end of 
the school year she can read and speak a great deal. 
</P>
<P>
It's just the Larger China that irritates her. It doesn't come up to her 
standards! It isn't clean enough! It's too disorganized! 
</P>
<P>
Blurb information on this book tries to tie it to the democracy movement, but 
it's dust bunnies, not totalitarianism, that gets on Mahoney's nerves. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of her year, she's "speechless with anger." Nice, then, to get home 
to an America where the railroads are double-track (forget who gave their lives 
to make them that way) and spit-and-polish is the order of the day -- at least 
in the environs of the East Coast upper middle-class.

Florida Sheriff vs. Crew: The Ft. Lauderdale sheriff who arrested three members 
of 2 Live Crew said the rappers would be arrested again if they gave another 
performance like the one a jury ruled Saturday was not obscene. 
</P>
<P>
Although a Broward County jury found three group members innocent of giving an 
obscene performance at Hollywood's Club Futura on June 10, Sheriff Nick Navarro 
said the verdict did not change Florida's law banning obscene performances. 
"It's against the law. Nothing has changed," Navarro said. The group said it 
plans to perform again in Broward County, although no date has been set.

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: 'PICTURES': TIRING BUT TANTALIZING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Filmforum presents tonight at 8 at LACE Richard Myers' "Moving Pictures," the 
latest work from the outstanding Ohio surrealist filmmaker. Myers' "Akran" 
(1971) was biographical, his "Deathstyles" (1972) apocalyptic and his 
"Floorshow" (1975) an attempt to break down the barriers between the conscious 
and subconscious, the making of the film and the film itself, and in turn, the 
filmmaker and the audience. 
</P>
<P>
As it tries to make film and dream one and the same, "Moving Pictures" is at 
once one of the simplest of his films and one of the toughest, alternately 
tantalizing and wearying. 
</P>
<P>
For 90 minutes Myers keeps his camera continually moving slowly from right to 
left, capturing his usual images of Midwestern Americana, considering the 
nature of mime and spectacle, contrasting the beauty of nature and of derelict 
urban structures. 
</P>
<P>
Myers will appear in person. (213) 276-7452. KEVIN THOMAS

MOVIE REVIEW;

<P>
'NIGHT ANGEL' PRETTY TO LOOK AT BUT HAS ECLIPSE OF HUMOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The moral of "Night Angel" (at selected theaters), a fast-paced, elegant 
thriller of the supernatural for the viewer is: Beware lunar eclipses. 
</P>
<P>
For filmmakers it is this: When you're spinning lush, erotic horror stories 
don't forget your sense of humor -- or to weigh the implications of what you're 
evoking. Visually, "Night Angel" is terrific, but director Dominique 
Othenin-Girard and writers Joe Augustyn and Walter Josten take themselves both 
too seriously and too thoughtlessly. 
</P>
<P>
According to Talmudic fable, Adam had a first wife named Lilith, who refused to 
submit to him. She left Paradise and haunts the night to this day. The 
filmmakers' Lilith is a standard issue horror movie monster who emerges from a 
bog during a prolonged eclipse and takes the form of a beautiful woman (Isa 
Andersen) who proceeds to wreak destruction on the staff of a fashion magazine 
through her irresistible sexual allure. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, she figures that getting her picture on the cover on a trendy mag 
-- before that eclipse is over -- is somehow the perfect way to spread evil for 
evil's sake. What the film gives us is yet another myth of Woman as the 
Destroyer, with the inference that in this instance she is a lesbian who 
pretends to have a feminist agenda. In any case, neither lesbians nor feminists 
nor women in general deserve to be given this retrograde image. 
</P>
<P>
Andersen comes on with the solemnity of Theda Bara, the original screen vamp, 
or the campy '40s movie goddess Maria Montez. Having led two male Siren 
Magazine staffers to grisly deaths, Andersen's Lilith zeroes in on art director 
Linden Ashby and his jewelry designer girlfriend Debra Feuer, whose sister 
Karen Black is Siren's publisher. 
</P>
<P>
Ashby, Feuer and especially Black acquit themselves as real pros, throwing 
themselves wholeheartedly into this hokum, as does Helen Martin as an elderly 
lady who is the one person who has Lilith's number. Available credits for 
"Night Angel" (rated R for sex and violence) are scant, but among its various 
skilled craftsmen cinematographer David Lewis deserves singling out for his 
virtuoso contribution in making the film look better than it is.

Barber and Edwards in One Studio: Sportscaster Red Barber and National Public 
Radio host Bob Edwards finally spoke face to face Friday after nearly 10 years 
of conversing over the phone on NPR's popular sports segment. Millions of 
listeners hear Barber in his distinctive Florida drawl talk by telephone with 
Edwards at 7:35 every Friday morning on the "Morning Edition" program. 
</P>
<P>
But the pair has never done a broadcast in person. Edwards was in Tallahassee, 
which is Barber's home, for a fund-raiser to benefit an NPR affiliate. Barber, 
82, has been in broadcasting for 60 years and is best known as the voice of the 
Brooklyn Dodgers from 1939 to 1953 and his trademark "Oh Doctor!" marking big 
plays. CLAUDIA PUIG

COUNTERPUNCH: SOUTHWEST MUSEUM SHOULD REMAIN IN MT. WASHINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SELMA HOLO, Holo, the director of the graduate museum studies program and 
the Fisher Gallery at USC, is a resident of Mt. Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The arrogance of the decision by the board of directors of the Southwest Museum 
to move from its beautiful and significant site in Mt. Washington demonstrates 
its ignorance of the history of museums and the various roles they play in 
society. A museum is more than a collection of works of art. It is a point of 
pride and self-definition for the community it serves, that very community 
which serves it in return. Mt. Washington and Highland Park are culturally and 
visually identified with the Southwest Museum while the museum is certainly 
enhanced by its location. 
</P>
<P>
It is, I emphasize, the arrogance of the board's decision -- not the decision 
itself -- which is so deplorable. We, the general public and members alike, 
learned unceremoniously of it through The Times. It was reported that storage 
is inadequate, parking difficult, the building not earthquake-safe and that the 
elevator is antiquated. Therefore, the article stated, the board assumed it was 
obvious that this civic treasure must be transferred elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Who, though, would ever believe in this day and age that it is cheaper to 
purchase a large plot of land, erect a new state-of-the-art building and move a 
whole institution than to remodel? No information has been released showing 
that the finances have even been researched, let alone what the conclusions 
might have been. We do know for sure that it is a more glamorous, dramatic and 
exciting job for the board to raise money for a new building than it is to 
raise money for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the problems, streams of schoolchildren climb that hill every day 
to visit the superb collections, to see and study the Indian baskets, pots and 
beads. Furthermore, membership is up and, with a sophisticated development 
campaign, could soar even higher. 
</P>
<P>
Could it possibly be that the neighborhoods of Mt. Washington and Highland 
Park, with their diverse and often low-income populations, are not the 
audiences the board wants for its parties and fund-raising events? Are these 
neighborhoods frankly not chic enough? 
</P>
<P>
One alternative to the radical decision to move the Southwest Museum would be 
for the board to bring together an ad-hoc committee made up of residents, 
students, teachers, artists, museum directors and journalists who love and 
support the place. Mt. Washington and Highland Park are filled with such 
people. The current director, not having any prior museum experience of his 
own, probably would find the advice and expertise of these people refreshing 
and insightful. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the committee could brainstorm with the director, the staff and the 
board. Together they might discover some creative (without doubt more moderate) 
solutions than the arrogant one they have announced, which would cut the 
cultural heart out of our community.

COUNTERPUNCH: THE POET AS CROSS-CULTURAL TRANSLATOR; 
</P>
<P>
MYSTERIES OF PRE-COLUMBIAN ART UNLOCK THE CLUES TO A CULTURE FOR A NOBEL PRIZE 
WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By OCTAVIO PAZ, Paz, Mexico's most prominent poet and essayist, was named as 
winner of the 1990 Nobel Prize for Literature last week. This summer, Paz 
curated an exhibit at Mexico City's Museum of Contemporary Art entitled The 
Privileges of Vision. This article is excerpted from an article in the current 
issue of New Perspectives Quarterly. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Baudelaire said that poets are the universal translators because they translate 
the language of the universe -- stars, water, trees -- into the language of 
man. Though it was not my goal, in some ways it has been my destiny as a poet 
to be a translator. 
</P>
<P>
However, I do not think that the act of translation should imply the 
abandonment of personality or the culture into which we were born. In fact, in 
many ways I feel that my understanding of modern art is the product of the many 
years I spent trying to unlock the mysteries of my own culture, of 
pre-Columbian art. 
</P>
<P>
I worked to see pre-Columbian art through the eyes of a poet rather than 
through the eyes of archeology or anthropology. I needed to see it from another 
point of view and then take what I learned from it into the world of modern 
art. Without the lessons I learned from pre-Columbian art, I could not have 
understood Cubism, Expressionism or Surrealism. Picasso, for instance, offers 
thousands of references to primitive art. 
</P>
<P>
Another invaluable lesson came with my discovery of "the other" during my 
ambassadorship to India in the 1960s. By studying a radically different art and 
culture, I was able to gain an entirely new perspective on the ancient art of 
Meso-America. 
</P>
<P>
These discoveries also helped in great measure with my poetry, since 
contemplation of "the other" is more than just frightening or challenging. It 
is often exciting and erotic. 
</P>
<P>
My initiation into the art of watching began during my childhood, in a village 
which was then one hour by train from Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
One day, while on a picnic with my friends, we found a small pyramid. We ran 
home through streets lined with 17th-Century convents and 19th-Century 
buildings to tell our parents of our amazing discovery. This was the Mexico of 
my childhood, a Mexico rich in pre-Columbian art, the art of the Colonialists, 
and the flowering of modern Mexican art. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three, pre-Columbian art was the most enigmatic to me, the most 
difficult to translate. It was only later that I learned to penetrate and 
appreciate the mysteries of pre-Columbian art. 
</P>
<P>
Meso-America was separated from the rest of mankind for thousands of years. 
Because of this, its art forms, social organization, cosmological conception 
and ethics were original: It began and ended with itself. 
</P>
<P>
Pre-Columbian art is a perfect example of this originality: It is an amazing 
fusion between the literal and the symbolic, the material and the idea, natural 
and supernatural. But isolation does not foster beauty and originality alone. I 
also believe that the isolation of Meso-America became the seed of its 
destruction. When the Indians had to face "the other" -- the Spanish -- they 
were technologically and socially unprepared. They confused their enemy with 
demigods. 
</P>
<P>
This invasion was the beginning of plurality in the Americas, the beginning of 
a history in which the people ceased to be one. But in nearly all societies, 
there is a similar story. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the first story, that of Babel, explains the shattering of the original 
unity into a multitude of languages and dialects. Babel is the Hebrew version 
of Babylon, and the condemnation of that city, probably the first cosmopolitan 
city in history, is the condemnation of cosmopolitanism, of a plural and 
pluralist society that acknowledges the existence of "the other" and of others. 
</P>
<P>
But the Babelian malediction is in some ways the Babelian benediction. 
Plurality of cultures means history, war and domination, but it also means 
communication and translation, a reconciliation of languages, a reunion of "the 
other" and others in the unity of understanding. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to speak a foreign tongue, understand it, and translate it into 
one's own is to restore the unity of the beginning. And in today's plural world 
it is the challenge all of us must face.

<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Allen's hard to figure. 
</P>
<P>
Despite writing enough hit ballads -- from "Don't Cry Out Loud" to "I Honestly 
Love You" -- to retire most songwriters to beachfront pads in Malibu, he still 
seems determined to prove that he is a world-class entertainer. 
</P>
<P>
By this point, surely, whatever doubts he may have had are long resolved. Even 
though his concert at the Wilshire Theatre Friday night was a bit smaller 
scaled than some past appearances (only a 10-piece band this time), it buzzed 
and crackled with the familiar supercharged gestures of Allen's obsessively 
energetic performing style.

Seated at the piano, lying on top of it, dancing and high-kicking from one side 
of the stage to the other, pacing nervously as he unfolded hilarious, 
stream-of-consciousness tales about life in the upper echelons of show biz, 
Allen must have burnt calories at the rate of 1,000 a minute. 
</P>
<P>
He sang all his hits, of course, but he was best when using numbers from his 
new "Making Every Moment Count" album as the real text of his performance. 
Songs like "I Could Marry the Rain" and "Love Don't Need a Reason" revealed 
surprisingly darker aspects of his songwriting skills. 
</P>
<P>
The failure of Allen's Broadway musical, "Legs Diamond," appears to have 
generated a more world-weary and complex expression of his muse in his songs. 
And, appealing as his high-voltage performances may be, the new pieces suggest 
that Allen has wisely chosen to allow his songs to take him wherever they may 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the performance was undercut by a sound mix that kept losing the 
vocals in the instrumental backgrounds, as well as by a scruffy-looking set and 
threadbare scrim. Fortunately, the quality and quantity of Allen's entertaining 
more than made up for the tattiness of the setting. DON HECKMAN

REQUIEM SUFFERS IN MOVE TO CONCERT HALL

Although Gabriel Faure's Requiem is a staple of church choirs, it is less 
frequently performed in the concert hall. With the combined resources of the 
San Diego Symphony and the La Jolla Civic-University Chorus at his disposal, 
music director Yoav Talmi did not make a convincing case for extracting the 
devotional work from its customary stained-glass surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there were some rewarding moments in Friday night's concert at 
Copley Symphony Hall. In the quiet opening movements, the highly disciplined 
chorus floated its dulcet, well-blanced sonorities, and the orchestra's lower 
strings sympathetically indulged the work's intimate counterpoint. Talmi's 
approach to the work stressed its reflective side, although the orchestra 
provided a wider range of emotions when asked. 
</P>
<P>
Soprano Sivan Rotem brought vocal purity to her "Pie Jesu" solo, but her 
brittle, studied phrasing muted her contribution. In his crucial solos, 
baritone Hector Vasquez displayed abundant vocal assurance. His musical virtues 
-- graceful phrasing, natural declamation, and above all a sense of conviction 
about the meaning of the text -- included everything the chorus failed to 
achieve. The 78-voice chorus, trained by resident conductor David Chase, sang 
cool, precise syllables and monochromatic phrases that sounded as if all 
expression had been eliminated by crafty computer engineering. 
</P>
<P>
Just because Faure did not include the apocalyptic "Dies Irae" text does not 
mean he eliminated the drama from his Requiem. The composer subtly worked drama 
and urgency into the musical fabric, expressing it in sudden dynamic explosions 
and unexpected modulations, the same technique he employed in his esteemed art 
songs. But when Talmi asked for an ardent forte, for example, at the "Hosanna" 
in the "Sanctus," their pallid response was all too easily overpowered by the 
orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
The Requiem performance was dedicated to Zoltan Rozsnyai, the former symphony 
music director who died last month, and to conductor and composer Leonard 
Bernstein, who died last week. 
</P>
<P>
Talmi preceded the Requiem with three shorter French works. Berlioz's highly 
pictorial "Royal Hunt and Tempest" from his opera "Les Troyens" received an 
appropriately atmospheric treatment. But in Ravel's "Le Tombeau de Couperin," 
mannered articulations and uneven tempos marred this usually charming 
program-opener. The orchestra offered a festive, light-hearted run through 
Berlioz's "Le Corsaire" Overture, giving the concert's first half the rousing 
ending denied by the ethereal final strains of the Requiem.

WATERED-DOWN SURREALISM IN S.D.; 
</P>
<P>
A SHOW OF 12 CALIFORNIA ARTISTS CONTAINS WORKS THAT DO JUSTICE TO ORIGINATORS 
OF MOVEMENT BUT ALSO INCLUDES PIECES THAT EXPLOIT ITS POPULARITY.

In a 1924 manifesto, Andre Breton introduced surrealism as "a new vice," 
delivering ecstatic freedoms to its addicts -- freedom from the contamination 
of reality, freedom from the entangling skeins of logic, freedom for the mind, 
the heart, the unconscious to roam at leisure. 
</P>
<P>
Surrealism's "mysterious effects and special pleasures" continue to tempt many 
an artist and seduce many a curator. This year's abundance of shows related to 
surrealism -- locally and elsewhere -- has turned the surrealist label into a 
catch-all of instant virtue. Certainly the heady conceptualism that reigns in 
today's art scene begs a more intuitive, sensuous antidote, but what is being 
passed off as contemporary surrealism doesn't always fit the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"Echoes of Surrealism" (at UC San Diego's Mandeville Gallery through Oct. 28) 
is a show of 12 contemporary California artists, and contains several 
resounding voices that do justice to the ghosts of Breton, et al., but also 
includes some weak, derivative whimpers that exploit the movement's popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Surrealism, from its inception, has always been less a style than a frame of 
mind. Defined as pure psychic automatism by Breton, surrealism suggests a 
sensibility devoid of reason, "exempt from any aesthetic or moral concern." 
Black humor, rebellious pride, fidelity to chance and a disdain for the 
regimental social order all made surrealism a potent postscript to the 
anarchism of Dada. Political critique was rarely spelled out in the art itself 
but was present in the artists' own revolutionary acts, in their defiance of 
convention, their poetic poison arrows sent to the guardians of the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
Given this heritage, it is surprising how overt and literal much of the imagery 
is in the Mandeville show. Carolyn Cardenas paints a painstakingly detailed 
chronicle of decadence and despair in her hinged triptych, "West of Eden." An 
updated version of Hieronymus Bosch's "Garden of Earthly Delights," Cardenas' 
painting takes Southern California as its target, particularly its inhabitants' 
indulgences in carnal pleasures and material diversions. A couple soaks in a 
hot tub while the world around them erodes -- physically, ethically, socially. 
</P>
<P>
Like Cardenas, Deborah F. Lawrence engages in slick social satire that has 
little to do with surrealism's poetic subterfuge, but much to do with decaying 
value systems and art's impotent, though highly visible, role in this process. 
Lawrence's painted montages twist familiar icons of art and popular culture, 
from the Mona Lisa to Marilyn Monroe, into humorous, irreverent positions. 
</P>
<P>
Other artists in the show have pledged a little too much allegiance to 
individual members of the original surrealist circle. Mark Bryan aligns himself 
uncomfortably close to Rene Magritte, while Phyllis Shafer borrows heavily from 
Yves Tanguy. Their efforts are overly stylized. They haven't the freshness and 
startling oddity of their precedents from 60 years ago.

AN UNSETTLING BLAIR BROWN BUOYS 'EXTREME CLOSE-UP' ON NBC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The era of the flashback in movies may be coming to an end. Characters need no 
longer retreat within themselves and silently reminisce; instead, for better or 
worse, directors can now sit them down in front of a VCR and show them watching 
their own old home videos. 
</P>
<P>
"Extreme Close-Up" (tonight at 9 on Channels 4, 36 and 39) operates out of a 
potentially gimmicky premise -- that its troubled 17-year-old protagonist, who 
is almost Oedipally obsessed with his recently deceased mother, will learn 
something startling about both her life and his from wading through the stacks 
of family videotapes he shot in happier times. The mother, played by Blair 
Brown, is already dead as the film begins and is seen only as the boy 
worshipfully studies her VHS image. It has the potential to turn into an 
unwitting pilot for "America's Most Maudlin Home Videos." 
</P>
<P>
This riveting film, though -- created by several members of the 
"thirtysomething" team -- transcends its novelty with almost shocking emotional 
clarity and believable revelations both big and small. As the teen-aged 
would-be documentarian sticks another tape in the deck and "Close-Up" shifts 
from the glossiness of film stock to the immediacy of videotape, it's as 
chilling for us as it is for him to watch these past events unfold so 
texturally close yet so far away. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Brown is seen only as preternaturally vibrant, the world's most hip 
and cheerful mom. Soon, though, in these flashbacks we see the intimations of 
an unbalanced personality that the children bore witness to but were usually 
encouraged to deny by Dad, Craig T. Nelson. The boy, Morgan Weisser, is 
expected to have worked through his grief, but he's increasingly haunted by the 
idea that he might be all too much like his mother -- whose tortured psyche he 
hasn't begun to understand. 
</P>
<P>
Part of what makes "Extreme Close-Up" so unusually perceptive is the way that 
characters come to understand how each other ticks in small and meaningful ways 
well before the climax, but then go on to behave selfishly or protectively for 
a while yet anyway, just like in life. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's performance is a brilliantly unsettling anchor, as she goes from 
supermom into some mostly suggested scary shifts. Weisser and Samantha Mathis, 
as a girl he befriends at school, make for two of the most credible teens 
you're likely to see adults dream up. Director Peter Horton (co-star and 
occasional director on "thirtysomething") and scenarist/executive producers Ed 
Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz (of the same show) have done TV proud again with 
the kind of close-up that could only work on the small screen. CHRIS WILLMAN

IRAQI SHIP FAILS TO HALT DESPITE WARNING SHOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
An Iraqi merchant ship ignored more than 40 warning shots blasted across its 
bow by an American destroyer Sunday in an act of defiance that raises the 
prospect of a new confrontation at sea. 
</P>
<P>
The tense situation in the Persian Gulf continued after daybreak today as the 
Iraqi vessel sailed toward the Yemeni port of Aden after its captain made clear 
to the Navy destroyer O'Brien that he does not intend to return to Iraq, 
military officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the Iraqi ship, the Al Bahar al Arabi, had been 
shadowed overnight by an Italian frigate. The Navy said it could not discuss 
"future U.S. involvement in this intercept." 
</P>
<P>
But one U.S. official noted that American warships were positioning themselves 
in front of the Iraqi ship and could seek to block its path this morning. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi ship's refusal to halt, despite a fierce display of American 
firepower, marks the first time since the very first weeks of the U.N.-imposed 
embargo in August that a ship has refused to halt when warning shots have been 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
The incident comes in the wake of indications that masters of Iraqi ships have 
received new orders from their companies -- and perhaps from the Iraqi 
government -- to refuse to heed the orders of foreign navies, according to 
senior American commanders. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi ship initially submitted to a search of its cargo by a U.S. Navy 
boarding party after first being challenged by the O'Brien on Saturday, 
according to Lt. Cmdr. J. D. Van Sickle, a Navy spokesman here. 
</P>
<P>
The vessel was found to be carrying prohibited cargo and was ordered to either 
return to Iraq or be diverted to another port for unloading. According to the 
Navy account, the Iraqi master agreed to return to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
After the boarding party departed, however, the vessel instead continued on its 
southward course toward the Strait of Hormuz and ignored repeated radio 
requests to halt. 
</P>
<P>
The American destroyer Sunday fired the first of 40 warning shots, including 15 
shells from a 25-millimeter cannon and two larger projectiles from the ship's 
five-inch deck gun -- its largest -- in what the Navy described as an effort to 
"gain (the Iraqi ship's) attention." 
</P>
<P>
But the 400-foot-long Iraqi vessel stayed on its course. In radio 
communications with the American vessel, the ship's master "indicated he did 
not intend to adhere to O'Brien's directions to return to Iraq," the Navy said. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent new instructions to Iraqi captains to refuse orders to halt would 
mark a reversal from what U.S. officials have described as earlier orders that 
they cooperate. The American commanders who described the turnabout said in 
recent interviews that Iraqi captains now fear retribution against their 
families if they submit to a search. 
</P>
<P>
Since Aug. 2, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, the United States has fired warning 
shots at half a dozen Iraqi vessels to force them to halt and submit to a 
search. The only other incidents in which Iraqi vessels ignored warning shots 
came on Aug. 18, about two weeks after the U.N.-imposed embargo began, when 
U.S. ships fired warning shots over two Iraqi tankers in the Persian Gulf and 
the Gulf of Oman. 
</P>
<P>
The degree of tension in Sunday's incident was indicated by the heavy volume of 
fire from the U.S. warship in its effort to stop the Iraqi vessel. Military 
officials said U.S. and other naval ships enforcing the sanctions generally 
rely exclusively on smaller, 50-caliber machine guns. 
</P>
<P>
A report from a British journalist aboard a warship in the gulf indicated that 
ships in the region have been placed on a higher level of alert, but the 
account could not be immediately confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
As the Iraqi ship continued toward the Strait of Hormuz on Sunday night, the 
Navy said that it was being tailed by the Italian vessel Libeccio. 
</P>
<P>
A Navy spokesman said this morning that the 7,000-ton Al Bahar al Arabi passed 
through the strait overnight and was now in the Gulf of Oman. He said that the 
boarding party found the vessel was carrying steel pipe and plywood from Iraq 
to Aden. 
</P>
<P>
The Libeccio and O'Brien are among nearly 100 ships participating in the 
multinational operation to enforce the economic sanctions against Iraq. So far, 
more than 2,500 ships have been intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
Of those vessels, 240 have been boarded, 191 of those by the United States, the 
Navy said Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
In another development Sunday in the gulf crisis, former British Prime Minister 
Edward Heath met for three hours with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Heath 
said he won agreement for the release of a number of sick and elderly Britons 
held by Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Also, motorists in Iraq waited in long lines at gas stations for a second day 
in a row, trying to beat the deadline for gasoline rationing, scheduled to 
start Tuesday. But Iraq's official media denounced the trade embargo as a 
failure.

DESPITE TINKERING WITH RATES, WHAT PEOPLE END UP PAYING AS A PORTION OF INCOME

<P>
"Taxes," said Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., the distinguished Supreme Court 
justice, "are the price we pay for a civilized society." 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Abraham Lincoln imposed the first U.S. income tax to help pay for 
the Civil War, however, Americans often have been at each others' throats over 
just who should pay to keep us civilized. 
</P>
<P>
Now we're at it again. This year's battle of the budget has turned into a 
highly visible fight over the issue of fairness, with Democrats promising to 
"tax the rich" while avoiding harsh tax increases on the middle class. 
Meanwhile, President Bush's flip-flops on whether to trade a lower tax on 
capital gains for higher income-tax rates on the rich have convinced many 
voters that the White House is interested more in protecting the interests of 
the wealthy than in ensuring that the burden of deficit reduction is equitably 
shared. 
</P>
<P>
And just Sunday evening, the budget negotiations broke down again over taxing 
the rich. The White House insisted that the current top rate of 28% should go 
no higher than 31%, but Democrats held out for a package that would raise tax 
rates on those with incomes above roughly $200,000 to 32% while imposing an 
additional surtax on the superrich with incomes above $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
But for all the current political firestorm over taxes, one unsettling fact 
remains: The tax system has proven largely ineffective in overcoming widespread 
disparities of wealth and income among Americans. 
</P>
<P>
It's true there was an erosion of some of the mild progressivity built into the 
overall U.S. system -- which exacts a slightly greater share of taxes from the 
most affluent than from the middle class -- throughout the 1970s and into the 
early 1980s. That trend was only partly reversed in the sweeping tax revision 
of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But from the beginning of the 1950s through 1963, when the top rate was set at 
91%, to the late 1980s, when tax rates on top incomes fell to 28% even as 
Social Security taxes bit harder into middle- and lower-income salaries, what 
people really end up paying in federal and state taxes has changed remarkably 
little. 
</P>
<P>
For example, middle-income families paid 24% of their income in taxes in 1988, 
slightly more than the roughly 23% share they paid in the mid-1960s. Although 
the top 10% face a somewhat lower tax burden of roughly 28%, compared with 30% 
in the mid-1960s, they are also now paying a greater share of overall tax 
collections. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, income inequality has risen significantly over the last two decades, 
but largely as a result of deep underlying currents in the economy rather than 
shifts in tax burdens. 
</P>
<P>
"The tax system never did -- and doesn't now -- redistribute income very much," 
says Henry Aaron, a Brookings Institution economist who is one of the nation's 
leading tax scholars. 
</P>
<P>
There are strong political and economic reasons why raising taxes usually fails 
to help narrow the income gap. 
</P>
<P>
Politically, wealthy individuals and special interest groups have great 
influence over the shaping of tax legislation. In the past, the higher rates 
moved, the more loopholes were added on the grounds that they would help 
stimulate certain desirable activities, such as erecting new buildings, 
investing in new factories and developing alternative energy sources. 
</P>
<P>
And economically, the affluent enjoy such a wide variety of ways to escape 
taxation that efforts to "soak the rich" through sharply higher rates usually 
end up losing more revenue than they gain. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what happens in the current political debate over taxes, the tax 
system's effect on income distribution isn't likely to change. Both Democrats 
and Republicans have staked out positions that are triumphs of symbolism over 
substance. 
</P>
<P>
For liberal Democrats, their crucial goal throughout the budget negotiations 
this year has been to burst the so-called "bubble" by pushing the tax rate on 
families with annual incomes of more than about $200,000 from 28% to the hidden 
33% rate paid by some who earn less. 
</P>
<P>
But in hopes of luring Republicans to make a deal and to win essential support 
from Southern and Western lawmakers in their own party closely tied to timber 
interests, most Democrats have been willing to accept lower taxes on capital 
gains, profits on investments earned overwhelmingly by the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
"Raising the top rate to 33% and giving a big capital gains cut takes from the 
wealthy with one hand but gives with the other," complains Sen. Bill Bradley 
(D-N.J.). "And it gives a lot more than it takes." 
</P>
<P>
Why would Democrats, trying to recapture their image as the party of average 
Americans, be prepared to make such an apparently unfavorable trade? 
</P>
<P>
"I take the cynical view that most Democrats would like to have their cake and 
eat it too," confesses one longtime Democratic tax reformer. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to be perceived as restoring progressivity through a higher rate on 
the rich," she says, "while winking at the same time at the party's wealthy 
contributors by saying, 'Look, I got this capital gains tax break for you.' " 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the aisle, Republicans have also talked one game while 
ending up playing another. Bush defends his effort to hold down the top income 
tax rate as necessary to prevent Congress from raising taxes on everyone else 
as well. But Bush was quite willing as part of the budget agreement negotiated 
by White House officials and congressional leaders and rejected by the House to 
impose a higher tax burden on middle- and lower-income Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, under former President Ronald Reagan, the GOP promoted income-tax 
cuts as a benefit to all, arguing that the overall economy would gain as the 
wealthy took advantage of lower marginal tax rates that would allow them to 
keep more of their income to make productive investments in new enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
"To help the poor and middle classes," argued George Gilder in "Wealth and 
Poverty," his early-1980s encomium to supply-side economics, "one must cut the 
taxes of the rich." 
</P>
<P>
But it didn't work out that way. 
</P>
<P>
Average income, adjusted for inflation, grew by almost 16%, and the income of 
those in the top 1% soared by 87% to almost $400,000 from about $214,000. But 
despite the general prosperity of the decade, the lower-middle-class and 
working-class voters who provided the decisive edge for Reagan actually saw 
their real incomes stagnate or even shrink during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Changes in taxes, however, were only a small factor in the widening gap between 
the rich and the poor. While analysts still argue over the reasons why the 
post-World War II trend toward slightly more equal incomes reversed direction 
in the mid-1970s, the most common explanations revolve around the entry of the 
huge baby boom generation into the work force, the spread of two-earner 
families and the growing disparity between skilled and unskilled labor as the 
U.S. economy became more exposed to global competition. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reasons, voters who have not shared in the economic gains of the 
1980s now want revenge, argues Kevin Phillips, the iconoclastic Republican 
whose recent book, "The Politics of Rich and Poor," helped galvanize Democrats 
to rally under the fairness banner in this year's budget wars. 
</P>
<P>
"The 1980s were the triumph of upper America," Phillips wrote, "an ostentatious 
celebration of wealth, the political ascendancy of the richest third of the 
population and a glorification of capitalism, free markets and finance." 
</P>
<P>
But the current debate reflects the widespread confusion over what role the tax 
system can realistically play in curbing such excesses. At the same time, it 
continues to mirror the power of well-connected individuals and 
special-interest groups to shape the tax code to their own benefit. 
</P>
<P>
While most Americans, in theory, favor a progressive tax system that imposes 
higher taxes as income rises, in practice lawmakers repeatedly have undermined 
that goal by inserting a wide variety of tax incentives that were designed to 
encourage certain types of investments or economic behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"Congress doesn't like to hand out explicit subsidies," says Alan Reynolds, 
chief economist at the conservative Hudson Institute in Indianapolis. "But 
handing out tax breaks provides a hidden subsidy without having to acknowledge 
the cost." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, whenever rates have risen in the past in an effort to force the 
wealthy to pay more, rich taxpayers have invariably managed to escape such 
burdens through a host of perfectly legal loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s and early 1960s, for example, when the top rate was 91%, the 
richest 1% of America's taxpayers ended up paying little more than 25% of their 
income in federal taxes. The wealthy learned to divert their income to tax 
shelters, invest in tax-free municipal bonds, buy luxuries for themselves by 
running up business expenses and take advantage of popular deductions such as 
those for home mortgages and charitable contributions to avoid facing an 
oppressive tax burden. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in the one significant effort in history to reverse the expansion of 
tax breaks, Congress agreed to eliminate many such loopholes in 1986, finding 
that the wider tax base actually forced the rich to pay more despite sharply 
lower rates. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people think the only way to improve progressivity is to raise the rates 
on the rich," says Joseph Minarik, staff director of the Joint Economic 
Committee in Congress. "But tax reform in 1986, even though it was not intended 
as a soak-the-rich plan, shows that you can improve fairness by closing 
loopholes even when you're lowering the top rate." 
</P>
<P>
It all depends on how tax rates are cut. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, the top tax rate was cut from 70% to 50%, corporate taxes 
were slashed, and capital gains rates reduced further to 20%, but Social 
Security taxes rose dramatically. As a result, the rich paid a smaller share of 
their income in taxes while the middle class and poor paid more. 
</P>
<P>
But when the top rate was slashed even further in 1986 to 28%, the wealthy 
began to bear a bigger tax burden because tax shelters were closed and the poor 
were largely exempted from federal income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Although the level of progressivity in the U.S. tax system has diminished from 
the mid-1960s, it has returned to almost what it was in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, for example, the effective rate of federal, state and local taxes on 
the top 10% of all taxpayers was 28.5%, according to detailed estimates 
prepared by Brookings Institution tax experts. By 1985, that burden had fallen 
to 26.4%, but it has now rebounded back to 27.7%. 
</P>
<P>
The overall tax system, assuming that corporate taxes are paid by shareholders 
rather than consumers, is at best only mildly progressive today. And to the 
extent that corporate taxes are passed on to consumers in the form of higher 
prices, the real tax burden of different income groups is just about the same. 
</P>
<P>
House Democrats, in moving to reshape their own budget proposal last week to 
ensure that the wealthy pay a greater share of the added tax burden, tried to 
craft a capital gains tax cut that would prevent many rich investors from 
taking advantage of it. It was targeted at small businesses, homeowners, and 
owners of assets such as timber that take years to earn a profit. 
</P>
<P>
But even longtime tax reformers question whether the House Democratic approach, 
which excludes stocks and bonds and limits the tax advantage to $100,000 over a 
lifetime, makes economic sense. 
</P>
<P>
"Politically, it may be a clever move but it's a lousy Rube Goldberg tax 
policy," says Bruce Fisher of Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-supported group 
that advocates higher taxes for corporations and the wealthy. "The whole idea 
is to get the Southern 'timbercrats' on board behind a Democratic plan. But all 
it really does is open up a Pandora's box to more abuses of the tax code." 
</P>
<P>
History bears Fisher out. Take the oil and gas percentage depletion allowance, 
a generous tax break that was first proposed in 1918 -- largely as an emergency 
World War I measure to encourage the drilling of new oil wells to fuel the war 
effort. By the time Congress finally approved the bill in 1919, the war was 
over. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the depletion allowance, although scaled back in size in recent 
years and limited to smaller oil producers, lives on today. Moreover, says Sen. 
Bradley, "the oil depletion allowance encouraged other special interests to 
seek comparable relief, which the legislators from the oil states supported for 
fear that otherwise the non-oil states (would) oppose oil depletion." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, more than 100 different "minerals" -- including such diverse 
products as oyster and clam shells, gravel, talc, sand and corundum -- have 
been granted special tax breaks over the years. There is even a tax break 
applying to clay used to make flowerpots. 
</P>
<P>
That's why proposals to create new tax breaks or revive some old ones, even 
under a new rubric and promoted as only having a limited impact, are likely to 
open the door to even greater loopholes in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"People like low rates," says Brookings' Henry Aaron, "but they don't often 
recognize that the only way to keep them low is to prevent loopholes from 
creeping back into the tax code."

<P>
House and Senate negotiators, resolving their last major differences over new 
air pollution laws, reached an agreement on new acid rain controls Sunday as 
they put the finishing touches on a sweeping revision of the Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
Working around the clock, negotiators completed work on the broad outlines of 
legislation that aims to cleanse the nation's skies of smog, acid rain and 
cancer-causing pollutants by the early part of the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
The omnibus legislation, which President Bush is expected to sign as soon as 
the House and Senate give their final approval, reduces urban smog through 
tougher controls on automobile pollution and the use of cleaner-burning fuels 
and expands the regulation of toxic emissions from factories to lessen cancer 
risks. It combats acid rain by making utilities cut sulfur emissions and seeks 
to safeguard the Earth's protective ozone layer by phasing out the use of 
ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
"We have finally put in place policies for the next decade that are going to 
clean up the pollution that harms people's health and threatens the ecosystem 
of our planet," said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), one of the principal 
authors of the legislation. "It is the most far-reaching and aggressive program 
to clean up pollution anywhere in the world." 
</P>
<P>
The bill requires 107 dirty utility plants clustered in the Midwest and the 
Southeast to cut their emissions of sulfur dioxide by almost 10 million tons or 
half the current amount by the year 2000. Emissions thereafter would be capped 
at 1980 levels, but an innovative trading system will let utilities that cannot 
meet the limits buy "pollution credits" from utilities that make extra 
reductions. 
</P>
<P>
The acid rain agreement was reached just before dawn Sunday after a nightlong 
argument over whether the Midwest, which bears the brunt of the reductions, was 
being treated fairly. In the end, the negotiators agreed to delay some of the 
reductions that Midwestern utilities must make until the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
They also accepted a provision that California lawmakers lobbied to get to 
regulate offshore pollution along the Outer Continental Shelf. Sponsored by 
Reps. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ojai) and Bill 
Lowery (R-San Diego), the provision obliges the Environmental Protection Agency 
to regulate offshore sources of air pollution, such as oil rigs in the same 
manner as onshore sources. 
</P>
<P>
That left only a handful of smaller issues on the table, the most contentious 
being a provision to provide $250 million in relief for workers who lose their 
jobs because of the legislation. The Administration opposes the provision on 
cost grounds but negotiators said they were confident a compromise would be 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
Congress must still approve the final accord and a few conservative senators 
have hinted that they may try to mount a filibuster. Supporters clearly have 
enough votes, however, to block any last-minute attempt to kill the bill, thus 
assuring passage this year. 
</P>
<P>
The culmination of a decade-long struggle to revise the nation's outdated air 
pollution laws, the bill has been described by congressional leaders as the 
most important piece of regulatory legislation Congress will pass this year. 
</P>
<P>
Its impact will be enormous, as will its price. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is disagreement over its cost, $20 billion a year is a 
conservative estimate for legislation that imposes a complex web of regulations 
on everything from giant steel mills and Midwestern utility companies to corner 
gas stations and neighborhood dry cleaners. 
</P>
<P>
Industry spokesmen warn the price may be far higher. But clean air advocates 
and health officials say the benefits -- in both lower health care costs and in 
the lives that will be saved by detoxifying the air Americans breathe -- will 
be incalculable. 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably with a bill this broad, the legislation that finally emerged from 
more than a year of committee hearings, floor debates and in recent weeks 
nearly around the clock conference negotiations was a compendium of compromises 
crafted by lawmakers representing the various industries, regions and other 
special interests affected by the regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a patchwork of provisions that, while described as very strict by 
industry lobbyists, falls short of what some environmentalists and state air 
quality control officials said is necessary to meet new turn-of-the-century 
deadlines for cleaning up the air in America's most polluted cities. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, this bill is a net plus for the environment, but it also contains 
unnecessary delays and the auto standards are not as tight as they could have 
been," said Gene Karpinski, an environmentalist with the Public Interest 
Research Group. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by the White House and key allies such as Rep. John D. Dingell 
(D-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, oil and auto 
industry lobbyists succeeded in getting the conferees to stretch out some 
deadlines and to adopt the generally more lenient motor vehicle provisions of 
the House-passed version of the bill. But industry officials declined to 
portray these compromises as victories for their side. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no clear winners and no clear losers here. Everybody gave a pound 
of flesh," said Tim MacCarthy, a lobbyist for the Motor Vehicles Manufacturers 
Assn. "We're not totally happy either, but then we did not expect to be." 
</P>
<P>
The bill sets deadlines, ranging from three to 17 years, for cities to 
eliminate smog by lowering the ozone level in their areas to the national 
standard of 0.12 parts per million. Los Angeles, with the worst smog in the 
nation, will have an additional three years, until 2010, to attain the 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
To achieve these goals, the legislation tightens federal controls on major 
sources of industrial pollution and for the first time extends them in severely 
polluted areas to small sources, such as printing plants and automobile paint 
shops. 
</P>
<P>
To control the largest single source of smog-forming pollution -- the 
automobile -- the bill takes a triple-track approach. It tightens tailpipe 
emission standards, mandates the use of cleaner-burning "reformulated gasoline" 
in the nation's nine smoggiest cities and establishes in California a pilot 
program for ultra-clean cars and fuels -- a plan that other states may use and 
that eventually could set standards for the entire nation. 
</P>
<P>
The tailpipe standards for new cars and light duty trucks will be phased in 
starting in 1994, with the aim of reducing emissions of hydrocarbons and 
nitrogen oxides, the main ingredients of smog, by nearly 40% and 60%, 
respectively, by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
A second round of 50% emission cuts will go into effect after the year 2000, 
unless the EPA determines that they are not needed or are too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
California has already adopted these standards for cars sold in the state. But 
extending them to the rest of the nation means that the one in four cars in 
California that come from out of state now will also have to be cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the bill also tackles the problem of acid rain and 
dramatically expands federal regulation of airborne toxins that can cause 
cancer, birth defects or other serious diseases. Only seven of these hazardous 
pollutants emitted by the chemical, oil and steel industries are currently 
regulated. 
</P>
<P>
The bill expands that number to 189, leaving it up to the EPA to set specific 
limits for each industry, with the aim of achieving a 90% overall reduction in 
toxic emissions by early in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
Although environmentalists had hoped for an even stronger bill, they conceded 
that the legislation represents a major breakthrough in a decade-long deadlock 
in Congress over revising the 1977 Clean Air Act. 
</P>

Bush helped to break the logjam last year when, reversing the Ronald Reagan 
Administration's opposition to environmental regulation, he proposed a clean 
air package. It later became the basis for negotiations with clean air 
advocates in Congress, led in the House by Waxman and in the Senate by Majority 
Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and Environment and Public Works Committee 
Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CLEAN AIR ACCORD 
</P>
<P>
The House-Senate clean air agreement represents a far-reaching rewrite of the 
nation's air pollution laws. This table compares current federal regulations 
with the new laws. 
</P>
<P>
Smog 
</P>
<P>
Current law: Restricts automobile tailpipe emissions to 0.41 grams per mile for 
hydrocarbons and 1.0 g.p.m. for nitrogen oxides. 
</P>
<P>
Clean Air Agreement: Lowers hydrocarbon emissions to 0.25 g.p.m. by 1998 over 
four-year phase-in; drops to 0.125 in 2003, unless EPA says it is unnecessary 
or unfeasible. Restricts nitrogen oxides to 0.4 g.p.m. by 1998 and 0.2 g.p.m. 
in 2003, unless EPA rules against. 
</P>
<P>
Clean Cars and Fuels 
</P>
<P>
Current law: No requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Clean Air Agreement: Reformulated gasoline to be sold in the nine smoggiest 
cities by 1995. Some new fleet vehicles like taxis and delivery vans in 25 
dirty-air cities must meet California standards for low emission vehicles 
starting in 1998. Additionally, a pilot program for California mandates clean 
car and fuel production beginning in 1996. Cars would have to be 50% cleaner 
than conventional vehicles through model year 2000 and 70% cleaner after that. 
Although mandated only for California, other states can opt into the program. 
</P>
<P>
Air Toxics 
</P>
<P>
Current law: Controls the emission of seven chemicals classified as toxic, but 
enforcement has been lax. 
</P>
<P>
Clean Air Agreement: Expands controls to 189 hazardous chemicals, with the aim 
of reducing toxic emissions by 75% to 90% over the next 20 years. EPA will set 
the specific reductions for each industry, taking health risks and 
technological feasibility into account. 
</P>
<P>
Acid Rain 
</P>
<P>
Current law: No requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Clean Air Agreement: Requires utility companies to cut sulfur dioxide emissions 
by nearly 10 million tons by the year 2000 and cap them at 1980 levels. The 
Midwest bears the brunt of the reductions but can delay some cuts until the 
year 2000. Allowance system also lets utilities that make extra reductions sell 
"pollution credits" to others.

<TEXT>
<P>
When classes started in September at Duracza High School in Warsaw, Elzbieta 
Domanska and Agnieszka Rostkowska, both 16, were among many of the 800 students 
at the school stunned over a new feature of the curriculum: religious 
instruction, one hour weekly, taught by a Roman Catholic priest. 
</P>
<P>
"No one expected to see this," said Agnieszka. "It seemed out of place here." 
</P>
<P>
"It is more normal to have religious instruction in a holy place," said 
Elzbieta. "It seems like religion should be taught in a church." 
</P>
<P>
Similar surprise, with varying degrees of dismay or satisfaction, was common 
across the country when the first genuinely post-Communist public school 
classes convened in Poland this fall. Catholic priests turned up at every 
school from kindergarten through high school, catechisms in hand, eager to 
repair what they regard as the spiritual neglect imposed by a 40-year Communist 
ban on religious teaching in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
Participation is voluntary, but parents say the pressure to attend, especially 
on primary school students, is prevalent and effective. 
</P>
<P>
Now, on the heels of that development, the upper house of the Polish National 
Assembly has passed a controversial anti-abortion bill that, if it is passed by 
the lower house and signed into law, would provide for two-year prison 
sentences for physicians or others convicted of performing abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the proposed law say the measure would also ban virtually all oral 
contraceptives from sale in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
The driving force behind the anti-abortion bill and the resumption of religious 
teaching in public schools is the powerful Roman Catholic Church of Poland. In 
a country where 95% of the population is baptized in the church, and where 65% 
remain observant Catholics throughout their lives, such measures have unusually 
widespread support. 
</P>
<P>
But there are others who see the church, victorious in the aftermath of the 
rout of the Communists from power here, as acting in a newly high-handed and 
dictatorial manner, in effect substituting religious authority for that once 
wielded by the Communists, all in the name of higher morality. To some critics, 
it is as if the church, after years of providing shelter against the 
Communists, has decided to come forward and claim its reward. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, the church is a more obvious presence than ever before. When a new 
consignment of police vans went into service in Gdansk, a priest was there to 
bless them, an event shown on the television news. Virtually no official event 
takes place without clerical benediction. 
</P>
<P>
And recently, Archbishop Jerzy Dabrowski of Warsaw attacked Polish television 
for showing protesters demonstrating over the abortion vote. Critics say the 
complaint was an attempt to intimidate the news media. 
</P>
<P>
Church officials decline to comment on the subject of the church's new 
political assertiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing going on," said Bishop Alojzy Orsulik, the church spokesman. 
"If some persons are using all this for political purposes, it is not our 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
In the face of the church's massive political and social clout, many with 
misgivings are wary of expressing their doubts publicly. 
</P>
<P>
Parents who object to religious teaching in the schools, particularly parents 
of children in primary schools, are reluctant to make any protest that might 
single out their children among their classmates. Most say they are not 
anti-religion or anti-Catholic, but they say they prefer for religion to be 
confined to the church. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians who oppose the church's position on the abortion issue are either 
cowed into submission or, if defiant, clearly prepared for defeat in any future 
election, certain that the church will work against them. The vote in the 
100-member Senate was 50 to 17 in favor of passage, the high number of 
absentees suggesting the delicacy of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"The church has become a leading political power here," said Anna 
Bogucka-Skowronska, a Solidarity senator who cast one of 17 votes against the 
bill. She said she has no doubt that the church will one day work against her 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
"The church can destroy any politician," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"For years the church has been for Poles a bastion of freedom," she said. "You 
could go to the church and feel free. Now the church has entered into a 
dangerous period. It is now an institution concerned with power." 
</P>
<P>
The church, she said, has promoted "a stereotype that a good Pole is also a 
good Catholic. This is bound not only to moral issues, but to public issues as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
The decision to introduce religious teaching in schools, she points out, was 
reached in negotiations between the church and the government's Ministry of 
Education, then simply announced to the public. The steamroller approach, she 
believes, is not in harmony with Poland's new democracy. "This was done outside 
any public discussion," she said. "Our nation has so long fought to be able to 
decide for itself that it should not allow anything to be imposed on it, even 
if it is a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
Her reason for opposing the anti-abortion bill, she said, is simple: "Women 
will die because of this legislation." 
</P>
<P>
Studies have shown, she said, that most abortions in Poland have been performed 
on women who have already given birth to two or three or four children. 
</P>
<P>
"The number of abortions is not due to the moral collapse of women," she said. 
"It is due to the economic conditions, to the fact people have very small 
apartments and no hope of finding larger ones, to situations that are beyond 
their control. If the state cannot make life easier for women, it certainly has 
no right to penalize women or to deprive them of making a free choice over 
their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Zofia Kuratowska, a leading Solidarity senator and a deputy minister of 
health, also voted against the bill. As a physician and a medical school 
professor, Kuratowska said she is aware that the medical profession is against 
the new law, but she admits that "the doctors have been very quiet." 
</P>
<P>
"Many have spoken to me privately," she said, "but they are intimidated as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Not just individuals but governmental bodies can be intimidated, the church's 
critics say. Some town councils, which in some cases are responsible for 
funding local hospitals and clinics, can be pressured by local church officials 
to withdraw financial support if doctors publicly oppose the law. In its 
extreme, observers say, the system of control is able to function in a style 
remarkably similar to the one devised by the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very worried about the church taking over public life," said Ivona Osuch, 
37, a free-lance journalist who has volunteered to work with a new group called 
Neutrum, which defines itself as an "organization for an ideologically free 
Poland." 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be grateful for what the church has done for Poland in recent 
years," she said. "But we have to avoid the situation where there is an 
extra-political force that influences government. We used to think, in the 
'80s, that if we could only have our country back, then our problems would be 
over. But that is precisely where our problems are beginning, and we are too 
tired now. I shouldn't be saying this, but I am a pessimist on these two issues 
-- religion and abortion. I think these are lost issues now." 
</P>
<P>
Sens. Kuratowska and Bogucka-Skowronska are also pessimistic. Although there 
are signs that the important vote on the issue by the Sejm, or lower house, 
will be postponed as long as possible, both feel that the issue will inevitably 
come up for a vote. As was evident in the Senate, where 99 of 100 members are 
from Solidarity, the church is on safe ground with the country's leading 
political movement. 
</P>
<P>
The two leading presidential candidates, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and 
Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, have not yet been pressed on whether they 
would sign the bill into law as it now stands. Walesa, father of eight, has 
declared himself against abortion. Both men are famously devout Catholics. 
Feminists say they believe their chances are better with the more liberal 
Mazowiecki, but they say the pressure on him will be enormous. 
</P>
<P>
"I think any Polish president would be forced to sign it," said Jolanta 
Plakwicz of the Polish Feminists Assn., a group that has only 70 members but 
has suddenly begun to attract new interest. During debate on the anti-abortion 
bill, Plakwicz stalked the corridors of the National Assembly daily, 
campaigning, vainly, along with a handful of other activists. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very male-oriented society," she said, "and it has been hard to 
attract women to a feminist organization. In Poland, people think that being 
feminist is being anti-male, and that is the No. 1 crime here. Women are still 
not interested in questions such as why women get laid off their jobs before 
men, although we have tried to get them interested. 
</P>
<P>
"But on this abortion issue, people are learning quickly that this is 
dangerous. They sense that what was a tendency a year ago is now a reality. We 
are not organized, but we are furious, so there is hope." 
</P>
<P>
One hope that Plakwicz and some others see is that the church's assertiveness 
may, in the end, work against it. Some say dissident groups are likely to form 
in the church, although there is no outward sign of this yet. More likely, they 
say, some adherents may simply be driven away. 
</P>
<P>
A Warsaw high school is not necessarily an accurate reflection of the whole 
society, but the students at Duracza High School noted that attendance at the 
religion classes has fallen off dramatically. According to Father Jan Ujma, the 
priest teaching the classes, 81% of the students signed up to take the course. 
Students interviewed outside the school last week indicated that less than half 
of those enrolled actually show up.

RARELY SEEN GIANT SHARK IS BROUGHT TO SHORE ALIVE

<P>
A 15-foot megamouth shark, the first of this mysterious species to survive 
after being brought to shore, was captured early Sunday in a commercial 
fisherman's net and hauled by its tail into Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Marine biologists were amazed by the rare catch seven miles off Dana Point, 
since only four other megamouths have been reported found anywhere in the 
world. The others were dead or dying when found, but the shark caught Sunday 
appeared to scientists to be healthy. 
</P>
<P>
With its large bulbous snout, the megamouth looks something like a whale. It is 
one of the largest sharks in the world and intrigues scientists. Little is 
known about the species because it thrives in deep waters, and specimens have 
not been studied or filmed except as corpses. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a really incredible find," said Robert Lavenberg, curator of fishes at 
the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History. "To see it swimming around 
like that for the first time, it's mind blowing. It looks like a whale. It's 
quite a very odd shark." 
</P>
<P>
Otto Elliott, a commercial fisherman and skipper of the Moonshiner, said he 
caught the megamouth in a gill net about 2:30 a.m. while fishing for swordfish 
and thrasher shark in his 38-foot boat. 
</P>
<P>
Marine experts at the museum hope to film the shark underwater today in the 
harbor. But they worry that it may not survive in the shallow waters where it 
has been tied to the Moonshiner since early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like an alien coming out of the depths," said Dennis Kelly, a marine 
biologist at Orange Coast College. "It's one in a million. We didn't even know 
that they existed until they caught the first one in Hawaii in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a fabulous opportunity for us, but the animal comes first. You hate to 
see something like this die," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
Disappointed marine experts worry that they might have to set the deep-sea 
animal free after videotaping it because there is no place to keep it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been calling my colleagues around the world trying to see if they can 
save this animal," Lavenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Sea World officials in San Diego declined to keep the shark, saying they do not 
have an available tank large enough and that little is known about what it 
needs to survive. 
</P>
<P>
"We wouldn't know how to keep it alive, what food to give it or what kind of 
lighting is needed," said Sea World spokesman Dan LeBlanc. "It would take years 
of research just to accommodate it." 
</P>
<P>
Megamouths have unusual, cavernous mouths with silvery tissue that might 
generate light to attract plankton in the dark ocean water that is called the 
"deep scattering layer." One mystery shark experts hope to solve by studying 
the Dana Point creature is whether the tissues actually glow in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
The sharks thrive in ocean waters so deep -- at least 700 feet to several 
thousand feet -- that few humans have seen them. 
</P>
<P>
Since the first megamouth was caught off Hawaii in 1976, scientists have been 
at a loss to explain how such a large creature escaped detection for so long 
and why they are appearing now. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are puzzled since the shark caught Sunday was swimming in less than 
100 feet of water when trapped in the net. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's coming to the surface, is it dying? Is it acclimated to those waters? 
Is it feeding? We just don't know," Lavenberg said. "We don't even know how it 
swims with that big head. Is it whale-like or porpoise-like in its swimming? 
The cartilage of the snout is formed like a big bulbous head instead of pointed 
like a typical shark, so it obviously is not a speed demon." 
</P>
<P>
The one caught off Hawaii was the only other megamouth taken alive, but it died 
within hours of swallowing a Navy port anchor, before biologists could see it 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
The second catch -- a 14 1/2-foot megamouth taken off Santa Catalina Island in 
1984 -- is on display at the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History. It 
was caught alive, but was dead by the time the boat returned to port. 
</P>
<P>
Two others have washed ashore, one south of Perth, Australia, that was alive 
but died within hours, and one decomposed carcass found in Japan. All four were 
about the same size, around 14 1/2 feet, and all were males.

<P>
Although President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has won his mandate to develop a market 
economy, bringing some of the most fundamental changes in Soviet history, he 
now faces a major struggle over the shape of that transformation. 
</P>
<P>
With the authority to rule by decree for the next year and a half, Gorbachev 
has the power to move the Soviet economy from a system in which state ownership 
and central planning ruled for 70 years to one radically different, in which 
private enterprise and market forces become the engine of growth. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Gorbachev's goals are distant and vague. His approaches to key issues, 
such as price reform, privatization and the ownership of land are still 
unresolved. And the prospects for ultimate success are uncertain despite the 66 
pages of "guidelines" that Soviet lawmakers have endorsed as the basis for 
establishing a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
Fierce battles, first of all between Gorbachev and Boris N. Yeltsin, the 
populist president of the Russian Federation, the largest Soviet republic, are 
inevitable because the nation's future will be shaped in this transformation. 
</P>
<P>
"To say that we are at a historic crossroads is already a cliche," Roy A. 
Medvedev, a longtime dissident who now sits in both the Supreme Soviet and the 
Communist Party Central Committee, said last week. "But what other way is there 
to sum up this endeavor? And we are undertaking it with little more than faith 
in Gorbachev and the last hopes we have for a better future." 
</P>
<P>
The urgent need for action was again underscored over the weekend by the report 
of the State Statistics Committee on the country's further economic decline in 
the first nine months of the year. The gross national product declined 1.5% 
from the same period last year. Industrial production, exports and the 
availability of consumer goods all declined, while inflation, unemployment and 
the time lost to strikes all were up sharply. 
</P>
<P>
"The country has approached the line beyond which it would be plunged into 
socioeconomic chaos and complete disintegration of political and state 
structures," Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov said over the weekend. "The 
system of power already is practically paralyzed, and I dare say this because I 
myself am part of this system." 
</P>
<P>
What Gorbachev had asked the Supreme Soviet for, and was reluctantly granted, 
was a further political mandate. It was an expression of confidence in his 
leadership that, in fact, is not reflected in recent opinion polls or among the 
consumers, factory workers, coal miners and the country's diverse minorities 
that vie with one another in their frustration and anger. 
</P>
<P>
In one of his most important political victories, Gorbachev won that mandate by 
outlining a compromise between a radical proposal to transform the economy in a 
500-day, forced march to the market and a cautious proposal by the government 
for a gradual transition that might require a decade to achieve the same goals. 
</P>
<P>
The four-step program would impose emergency measures such as increasing 
consumer goods, followed by financial controls, establishment of a market 
system and a final stabilization period that would end the government monopoly 
in many industries. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the bargain, which was endorsed by top economists on both sides of 
the controversy, was a Gorbachev commitment to use his sweeping powers and the 
old bureaucracy -- despite its proven inefficiency and lack of vision -- to 
build a new economic system based on the radicals' pro-market principles. 
</P>
<P>
But can veteran central planners -- people whose vision has been shaped by 
years deep in the Soviet bureaucracy and for whom free enterprise has always 
signified economic chaos and the evils of capitalism -- manage a transition to 
a market economy? 
</P>
<P>
The varied experience of Eastern Europe's smaller socialist economies suggests 
that such a strategy is unworkable. But Gorbachev accepted Ryzhkov's argument 
that the old bureaucratic methods of a planned economy must be used in the 
transition because the alternative -- a year or more of near chaos -- is too 
dangerous for a country of 290 million with global responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin had argued that combining the two approaches, as Gorbachev has done, is 
like "mating a hedgehog and a snake." The radicals contend that the present 
economic structure must be virtually destroyed so that a natural market economy 
can develop. The moderates argue that such an approach would bring unacceptable 
suffering for most people and would even risk civil war. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who today oppose social concord and who fan up passions," Ryzhkov said, 
defending his moderation and implicitly criticizing Yeltsin's radicalism, "are 
actually gambling with the fate of our people for the sake of their own 
personal ambitions. If the changes turn into chaos, violence becomes very 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
The solution to this contradiction of a market economy designed by central 
planners will be the emergency powers granted Gorbachev by the Supreme Soviet, 
the country's legislature, to rule by decree until March 31, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, it is suggested, will use this authority, which is greater in law 
than that of any previous Soviet leader, to put into place the proposals of his 
economic advisers, all of them market advocates. At the same time, he is 
supposed to control the inflation, unemployment and social disorder that 
Ryzhkov and others fear. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Gorbachev has neither a blueprint for this new economic system nor specific 
plans on how it will be achieved. While Nikolai Y. Petrakov, one of his top 
advisers, said that Gorbachev has dozens of reform decrees already drafted and 
ready to issue, he acknowledged that most of the major decisions will be made 
along the way. 
</P>
<P>
In retreating from the "500-Day Plan" advocated by Stanislav S. Shatalin, a 
member of the policy-making Presidential Council, Gorbachev freed himself of 
its stern timetable of unequivocal steps to establish a market economy through 
the virtual destruction of the present system. 
</P>
<P>
What he substituted were measures that Ryzhkov felt he could employ to achieve 
most of the same goals, but in a longer time period and with less disruption. 
</P>
<P>
These guidelines leave unresolved crucial questions, which will likely 
determine the success of the transformation and the future political as well as 
economic character of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Although the privatization of state-owned enterprises will play a major role in 
the transformation of the economy, great differences remain over how much of 
industry and agriculture should be sold off and to whom and for how much. What 
will be done, for example, with the tens of thousands of enterprises, some of 
them vast industrial complexes amounting to virtual cities, that will never be 
profitable? 
</P>
<P>
The question of private ownership of land remains so controversial that 
Gorbachev has called for a nationwide referendum on it. Without land reform, 
Yeltsin and his supporters contend, there can be no revival of agriculture in 
Russia, for farmers simply refuse to grow more for so little return on their 
labor. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's plan calls for price reforms on a step-by-step basis without fully 
recognizing it as the key to the active interplay of the market forces of 
supply and demand -- and without outlining how it will be achieved. Every 
economic reform in the Soviet Union in the last four decades has foundered on 
this point. 
</P>
<P>
The program takes as its starting point a strong federal structure for the 
Soviet Union in the future. However, virtually all the constituent republics, 
including Russia, have declared their "sovereignty."

BUSH BLITZ READIED: President Bush is planning a last-minute campaign blitz to 
help GOP candidates just before the Nov. 6 election. The White House has 
reserved the last five days before the balloting for political travel by the 
President, but will not decide which states he will visit until almost the last 
minute. Poll-watchers will be sifting through the data to see where Bush can 
help most. 
</P>
<P>
High on Bush's likely list are two races for governor -- the Pete Wilson-Dianne 
Feinstein campaign in California , which polls show is a dead heat, and the 
Lawton Chiles-Bob Martinez contest in Florida, where Republican Martinez, the 
incumbent, is believed to be catching up with Chiles, a former Democratic 
senator. 
</P>
<P>
A WHITE HOUSE DIVIDED?: John H. Sununu's unspoken prohibition against public 
backbiting by staffers in the executive mansion may be about to backfire -- on 
the President's chief of staff himself. There's growing resentment among White 
House staffers that the former New Hampshire governor didn't warn Bush in 
advance about the likely unpopularity of the budget summit agreement that he 
and Budget Director Richard G. Darman negotiated. Critics say the 
often-irascible chief of staff -- himself sold on the merits of the agreement 
-- kept opposing views away from the President. Sununu has publicly rejected 
such charges, blaming Congress for shying away from a meritorious package. And 
Bush has expressed confidence in his staff chief. But restoring the 
once-vaunted harmony in the staff will be a difficult task. 
</P>
<P>
GOLDEN VIC: Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento) has had a change of heart and will 
accept a job as head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee after 
the November election, Capitol insiders say. Fazio, the respected vice chairman 
of the party's House caucus, initially had forsworn any interest in the post, 
but sources said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) has persuaded him to 
reconsider. The stakes are high as the party approaches the redrawing of new 
congressional districts after the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
Fazio is the Democratic point man on reapportionment. As such, his political 
action committee, IMPAC 2000, has raised millions of dollars to assist party 
candidates nationwide and defeat redistricting initiatives in California that 
were anathema to Democrats. "You need a prolific fund-raiser, an expert on 
redistricting and somebody with some stature," says a Hill staffer familiar 
with the behind-the-scenes machinations. "Vic is golden." 
</P>
<P>
JAPAN REPORTEDLY IRKED: Japan is said to be fuming because President Bush has 
appointed Vice President Dan Quayle to be the head of the U.S. delegation 
attending the coronation of Emperor Akihito in mid-November. Although Quayle 
technically has sufficient rank, Tokyo had been hoping for someone more 
"substantial" -- such as Secretary of State James A. Baker III -- Japanese 
sources say. 
</P>
<P>
EVENHANDED: Newly installed Supreme Court Associate Justice David H. Souter 
sends senators shaking their heads in wonder by visiting each member of the 
Senate Judiciary Committee -- even those who opposed his nomination -- to thank 
them for considering him. Souter tells former adversaries that he hopes to earn 
their confidence in the months ahead.

AMERICAN ALBUM: TOWN SEES TRUCKS AS ROADBLOCK TO TOURIST TRADETHE REDISCOVERED 
FAILED UTOPIA WANTS TO DETOUR 18-WHEELERS TO CLEAR PATH FOR VISITORS.

<P>
You can hear it miles before you see it -- a giant hum that tumbles through the 
still mountain air. 
</P>
<P>
Then the hum becomes a roar, and, VROOOMMMM! there goes another 18-wheeler. 
</P>
<P>
For residents here, it is a constant reminder that utopia is no more. 
</P>
<P>
Danger and just plain frustration with the noise are driving townsfolk and 
their supporters to lobby to get the trucks off Highway 52, which cuts through 
town. But in a larger sense, their effort is just the latest of many in Rugby's 
110-year struggle to survive. 
</P>
<P>
Rugby was founded in 1880 by British author and social reformer Thomas Hughes, 
who named it after the noted English school where he studied and about which he 
wrote in the novel "Tom Brown's School Days." Like hundreds of other would-be 
utopias in this country, this one was rooted in the ideals of cooperative 
living, improving conditions for working people and wiping out elitism. 
</P>
<P>
And Rugby, like many other model towns, failed to thrive as its settlers had 
envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
As John Egerton, grandson of one of the Rugby settlers, wrote in his book, 
"Visions of Utopia": "One of the common characteristics of utopias is their 
impermanence." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes established Rugby to provide a haven for younger sons of upper-crust 
Britons. He believed the younger sons were trapped between two conventions: 
inadequate allowances from their parents, who gave the eldest sons most of 
their wealth, and the social prohibition against their earning a living through 
ordinary work. 
</P>
<P>
Rugby, tucked away in the Cumberland Mountains of east Tennessee, would be a 
haven for these young men and others. "Our wish is to preserve the natural 
beauties of this place for the people who live and visit here, and make them a 
constant means of educating the eye and mind," Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
The town grew to a peak population of about 450 in 1884, but a host of problems 
-- including poor management, fires, disease, drought and continuing losses 
suffered by financial backers -- rode Rugby into the ground. Even before Hughes 
died in 1896, his dream clearly was shattered. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after several reorganizations and land deals, the town, current population 
about 75, has emerged as a tourist attraction. Rugby drew 75,000 visitors last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
They come to see what remains of Hughes' utopia: 22 of the 70 original 
English-style structures, including restored Victorian cottages, a library 
bearing Hughes' name, a Carpenter Gothic-style church and a "public house" 
called Newbury House, where guests are greeted by a bob-tailed cat on a porch 
full of rocking chairs. 
</P>
<P>
The streets have names such as Parringdon Road, Donnington Road and Newbury 
Road. Several of the current residents were born in England, making the town 
sound a bit British. 
</P>
<P>
Not far from Newbury House is Highway 52, also called Central Avenue. It runs 
right past the library, the commissary, the church and the visitors' center. 
Residents, afraid that Rugby's ambience will be crushed under truck wheels, 
have appealed to state and federal officials to build a bypass for the heavy 
vehicles. The project's cost is estimated at $7.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the busy two-lane road exists because a community leader campaigned 
for it back in the 1930s as a way of breathing life into the town. 
</P>
<P>
Now, said Barbara Stagg, executive director of Historic Rugby Inc., rerouting 
trucks around the town -- while leaving the road open to visitors -- would 
amount to "saving the village." 
</P>
<P>
Stagg worries that tourists, enthralled and distracted by the sights, will 
wander into the path of an oncoming truck. Also, she said: "Truck traffic is 
the only thing today that detracts from the 19th-Century atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Lobbying efforts to move the truck route have included a resolution by the 
Morgan County Commission, as well as an appeal to Gov. Ned McWherter from a 
group of visitors to Rugby. 
</P>
<P>
That group, an elder hostel tour made up of people from around the country, 
spent a week in Rugby last spring, then wrote the governor that the "numerous 
large coal-hauling, construction and commercial trucks powered by loud and 
sometimes smoke-emitting diesel engines" affected the "tranquility and safety 
of Rugby visitors" day and night. 
</P>
<P>
Stagg, herself a lobbying machine, believes the efforts will pay off. She said 
that state officials "continue to be interested and concerned about the 
long-term future of Rugby." 
</P>

A DAILY BRIEFING PAPER ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CRISIS; 
</P>
<P>
HOSTAGE FRONT: 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a meeting with Saddam Hussein, former British Prime Minister Edward Heath 
announced that he has arranged for a number of sick and elderly British 
hostages to be released Tuesday. The list is being drawn up by Heath's advisers 
and Iraqi authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Six German nationals recently released by Iraq sharply criticized their 
government for not doing enough to help the 400 remaining German hostages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi merchant vessel ignored more than 40 warning shots across its bow by 
an American destroyer. A tense standoff continued into the night as the Iraqi 
vessel sailed toward the Yemeni port of Aden. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan, about 23,000 leftists and pacifists protested their government's 
proposal to send Japanese troops to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
From Paris, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the United States believes it 
has all the authority it needs from the United Nations to justify an attack on 
Iraq and Iraqi forces in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sanctions Front: 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi military is suffering from critical shortages of tires and 
lubricants, limiting the mobility of ground troops and forcing the curtailment 
of training flights, U.S. intelligence reports said. 
</P>
<P>
Gas shortages are also expected to hurt Iraq's military. Average motorists in 
Iraq waited in long lines Sunday, filling up before rationing starts Tuesday. 
But Iraq's official press declared the economic blockade a failure and pledged 
to fight the "battle of all battles." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, under pressure to apply U.N. sanctions more rigorously, halted sales of 
medicine to Iraq, customs officials said.

TIGHT SENATE RACE COULD UPROOT OREGON POLITICAL GIANT; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGN: CHALLENGER HARRY LONSDALE HAS BEEN ABLE TO USE TIMELY ISSUES AND 
VOTER DISCONTENT TO UNDERCUT SEN. MARK HATFIELD.

<P>
In this unsettled political year with clouds of voter rebellion thickening 
overhead, we visit Oregon, where gasps and whispers carry word that a giant of 
Northwestern politics may be in giant trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Mark O. Hatfield, who has never lost an election for public office, is on 
the run, chased by crafty upstart eco-businessman Harry Lonsdale, who has never 
won an election or, for that matter, even stood for one. 
</P>
<P>
It is an election that could rock the U.S. Senate and quite likely mark a 
crossroads in the rough-hewn environmental politics of the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few months ago, hardly anyone gave the race a second thought. Few 
individuals are as towering in the political hierarchy of their states as 
Hatfield is in Oregon. A progressive, independent-minded Republican, known as a 
champion of peace and disarmament, he has held one office or another here for 
39 years. 
</P>
<P>
Twice he was elected governor. A marble bust of him is displayed today in the 
state Capitol. He has been in the Senate 24 years, is second in Republican 
seniority and is the ranking GOP member of the Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
His style, even in the face of random campaign scares in the past, has been to 
come home and, as they say, "stand for reelection." As little fuss and 
fireworks as possible, please, and of course never mention your opponent. 
</P>
<P>
But not now. 
</P>
<P>
In the final weeks of the campaign, opinion polls and survival instinct told 
Hatfield that his once commanding position was slipping away. One poll found 
Hatfield's lead dropping from 36% to 6% with a month left before the election, 
and some political experts think the race has grown much tighter since. 
</P>
<P>
His voice shaking and his fist hammering the lectern at a recent Portland news 
conference, the 68-year-old Hatfield said: "I'm prepared to fight." Of the 
campaign against him, he said: "Political pollution at its foulest." 
</P>
<P>
Lonsdale is a 58-year-old Ph.D. chemist who built a research business in Bend, 
in the central part of the state, devising nonpoisonous pesticides and 
technologies for cleaning up toxic wastes. 
</P>
<P>
Politics came late but seemingly easily to Lonsdale, who has been both skillful 
and lucky at driving wedges between Oregon and its senior senator. 
</P>
<P>
First, was timber. Lonsdale began his campaign objecting to the continued 
felling of what remains of unprotected old-growth trees in the state. He 
branded Hatfield a compromiser on the issue and accused the senator of favoring 
timber barons over the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Luck came along and dropped the spotted owl controversy into the campaign, 
adding an air of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Lonsdale began shifting his emphasis to abortion. He favors abortion 
rights; Hatfield has supported a constitutional amendment to ban all abortions. 
</P>
<P>
As fate would have it, two citizen initiatives to restrict abortions made their 
way to the November ballot here, making the issue more than abstract. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, Lonsdale has pursued a well-executed strategy of trying to paint 
Hatfield not as a senior senator bringing home the bacon for Oregon but a 
professional Washingtonian who has become a willing servant of privileged 
interests, whether the savings and loans or toxic polluters. 
</P>
<P>
Underlying the campaign is a belief that voters in Oregon, like other states, 
have had a bellyful of entrenched incumbents, even once popular ones, and are 
restless to shake things up. In the argot of campaign politics, it's sometimes 
known as the gold-watch strategy when deployed against someone of high 
standing. 
</P>
<P>
"Like many of you, I've voted for Mark Hatfield in the past," Lonsdale says in 
his television commercials. But the announcer adds: "Twenty-four years back in 
Washington really has changed Mark Hatfield." 
</P>
<P>
The Oregonian newspaper in Portland says that while other states have become 
accustomed to campaigns of this type, driven by polls and focus groups and 
tested strategies plotted by out-of-state professional consultants, Oregon has 
seen nothing like it in at least a decade.

One person was killed and three others injured Sunday evening when a small 
plane crashed while attempting to land at Santa Barbara Municipal Airport, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The single-engine Cessna 172 hit power lines before crashing about one mile 
east of the UC Santa Barbara campus in the community of Goleta, the California 
Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
The crash, which occurred shortly after 6 p.m., came after the Cessna had been 
cleared for landing, said a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A woman believed to have been a UCSB student was dead on arrival at Goleta 
Valley Community Hospital, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Another woman, about 26, possibly a student, was in critical condition with 
massive head and internal injuries, said hospital spokeswoman Melissa Seawards. 
A man about 24 was in very critical condition with massive head and internal 
injuries, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Another man, about 35 to 40, sustained multiple fractures. He was taken to 
Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital where he was in serious condition, said Bobbie 
Kline, a nursing supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
The victims' names were withheld pending notification of relatives.

A congregation wants to put a little separation between its church and the 
state of its neighborhood. St. Andrew's Roman Catholic Church plans to build a 
6-foot-tall, 1,000-foot-long fence around church grounds to keep out 
prostitutes who have been bringing customers there. The Rev. John Maxwell said 
that even his 92-year-old mother has found used condoms and wrappers on the 
steps in front of the rectory where the priests live and in the foliage around 
the church. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always had sporadic prostitution, but now it's gotten way out of hand," 
Maxwell said. Vera Brown, a parishioner who works at the church added: 
"Sometimes they leave clothes, underwear and even stockings out there." Church 
members have raised $8,000 so far to put up the $11,000 fence.

The Navy has a serious problem with rapes, sexual assaults and violations of 
fraternization rules at its sprawling Orlando Naval Training Center in Florida, 
but often has failed to seek appropriate punishment for offenders, a Pentagon 
investigation concluded. 
</P>
<P>
In the 18 months ended June 30, the Navy's inspector general reported there 
were at least six rapes of female students or recruits, but no one has been 
prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
During the same 18 months, female recruits at Orlando -- which includes the 
Navy's only boot camp for women -- reported 24 rapes or sexual assaults. Navy 
law enforcement officials "substantiated or resolved" eight of the rape cases 
and five instances of sexual assault, the report said. Investigators concluded 
that two of those who said they were raped had made false statements. Only one 
of the 13 cases, an assault, resulted in court-martial proceedings.

A 4TH BRUSH FIRE BLAMED ON ARSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hot east winds fanned an arsonist-set fire east of Santa Paula on Sunday, but 
crews who were on standby in the area quickly contained the brush fire before 
it approached nearby houses, Ventura County Fire Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,000-square-foot blaze just north of California 126 was deliberately set, 
but no evidence was found to link it to the three fires of Oct. 8 and 9 started 
by arson in the Santa Paula and Fillmore areas, county fire investigator David 
Chovanec said. 
</P>
<P>
The Oct. 8 and 9 fires consumed 2,200 acres north and south of Santa Paula and 
south of Fillmore during similar weather conditions that included blustery 
Santa Ana winds, dry hillsides from the fourth year of drought and low humidity 
in the air and brush. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's small blaze was quickly knocked down as a water truck from the 
county's Fillmore station arrived soon after a Telegraph Road resident reported 
the flames at 1:22 p.m., Capt. Christopher Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston said the department was ready over the weekend, waiting for an 
arsonist's attack with extra trucks and crews on standby status. 
</P>
<P>
"The arsonist we have has been doing things on a regular basis and today is a 
typical day for him to light a fire," Johnston said Sunday as his fire crew 
drenched the area to squelch any smoldering brush or wood. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's dry winds also fueled a Simi Valley house fire, causing nearly 
$150,000 damage, fire dispatcher Dennis Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
The 2:33 a.m. fire at the Tapo Street home of William and Dawn Smith and their 
two children began in a pool supply shed attached to the two-story house with a 
flammable shake roof. Two firefighters were injured, but the family escaped the 
house unharmed. The family dog died in the fire in a downstairs bedroom, Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A second small brush fire, spotted at 6:05 p.m. Sunday in the rural canyon area 
along Yerba Buena Road two miles north of Circle X Ranch near the Los Angeles 
County line, was nearly out by 7 p.m., a county fire dispatcher said. The cause 
of the fire, which was held to a 10th of an acre by the dirt roads that 
surrounded it, was also under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Fire danger was expected to diminish today as cool, moist ocean breezes replace 
dry Santa Ana winds and humidity levels rise slightly to 12% to 18% in the 
inland valleys, Ventura County Fire Department officials said. Temperatures 
were expected to fall slightly to the low- to mid-70s on the coast and to 70 to 
80 degrees inland, the National Weather Service reported. 
</P>
<P>
But hot winds from the east are expected to return Tuesday night along with a 
so-called red-flag warning of fire danger from the National Weather Service, 
County Fire Dispatch Supervisor Sam Meier said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana winds will continue intermittently through March, with December being 
the peak month for the hot easterly winds, said meteorologist Rae Strange.

SHE'S A LIVE WIRE FOR A LABOR CAUSE; 
</P>
<P>
CRUSADE WAGED FOR MORE WOMEN ELECTRICIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER, TIMES LABOR WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During most of her working life, Lynn Dabney, a 36-year-old Los Angeles 
journeyman electrician, has groused about being the only woman on the job. 
</P>
<P>
Most women in construction know the feeling. In an era of countless feminist 
advances, the proportion of women in the building trades has lingered at around 
2% for at least a decade. Contractors are still sexist and unions are still 
clannish, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
Dabney thinks she has found an answer, though. It lies in the 
earn-while-you-learn apprenticeship programs that operate in unionized trades 
like hers. These programs, she says, have to stop waiting for women to apply 
and instead begin aggressively recruiting them. 
</P>
<P>
That is what Dabney spent most of the year trying to do in a one-woman campaign 
that coincides with burgeoning federal government efforts to put more females 
in construction jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with a grant from a university labor-management program, Dabney spent the 
summer beating the bushes of Los Angeles, looking for women who might be lured 
into electrical work. 
</P>
<P>
She hit YWCAs. She hit layoff-plagued aerospace plants. She hit agencies that 
offer temporary work to young people. She hit the docks where loads of women 
applied for a sparse number of longshoremen's jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Everywhere she went she spread the gospel of the five-year apprenticeship 
program jointly operated by a group of Los Angeles County electrical 
contractors and her union, Local 11 of the International Brotherhood of 
Electrical Workers. 
</P>
<P>
Apprentice electricians work for about $8 an hour during the day, take classes 
at night and eventually graduate to journeyman status, which pays $24 an hour 
on unionized projects. While the bulk of electrical work in Los Angeles 
construction is performed by non-union workers, who are paid in the $14-an-hour 
range, union workers claim a substantial share of large commercial projects. 
</P>
<P>
The results of Dabney's labors: In August, 24 women applied to the Los Angeles 
electrician apprenticeship program. By contrast, in March there had been just 
five. The number of minorities rose from 53 in March to 113 in August. 
</P>
<P>
In the greater scheme of things, this was small potatoes. The 24 women who 
applied in August represented less than 7% of the 357 total applicants. And 
only three of the 24 passed the exam to qualify for apprenticeship. 
</P>
<P>
Still, in the world of women and construction, even baby steps are appreciated 
-- a point Dabney will make today in New York when she presents a report on her 
efforts to the Samuel Gompers Union Leadership Award Forum, which funded her 
work. The program, which encourages union members to study labor issues, is 
sponsored by the City University of New York's center for labor-management 
policy studies. 
</P>
<P>
Dabney, who grew up in Minnesota, began working as an apprentice electrician at 
a Pennsylvania steel plant at age 24 and came to California when the plant shut 
down. She said that studying the issue of female and minority participation in 
the building trades made her more conscious of the relationship between sagging 
union membership and a lack of union "outreach" efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people say to me, after I've told them about the apprenticeship 
program: Why didn't I know about this? I say, well, most people who hear about 
it already know somebody who is in the local. Now we're trying to reach out. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the labor community, the skilled trades, have been based on keeping 
within ourselves, keeping our trade secrets to ourselves to make ourselves 
strong. Now the opposite is true: We need to reach out to the community to make 
us strong. It goes perfectly with the union rallying cry of the '90s, which is 
organizing the unorganized." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Dabney, this concern happens to also be close to the heart of 
Elizabeth Dole, the secretary of labor. Within weeks, Dole is expected to 
release new Labor Department regulations strengthening requirements for more 
female participation in apprenticeship programs and in major construction 
projects performed by builders who receive federal funding. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Congress is close to approving an amendment to the federal Job 
Training Partnership Act which would allocate $6 million over four years to 
create a network of demonstration programs aimed at training and employing 
women in non-traditional jobs. 
</P>
<P>
These efforts are a welcome recognition that most job training segregates women 
into lower-paying jobs, keeping single women with children trapped in or near 
poverty, said Kim Otis, a staff member of Non-Traditional Employment for Women, 
a New York organization. 
</P>
<P>
"If you take a woman on welfare and teach her how to be a secretary, you're not 
doing anything for her," said Otis. "When you teach her how to be a 
construction worker you're leading her to a job that pays $40,000 a year." 
</P>
<P>
Dabney's report said the Los Angeles electrical apprenticeship program is 
relying mainly on applicants who come through the door, or meet staff members 
at school and community presentations or happen to see the limited brochures 
that the program mails out to about 250 local organizations. While the 
apprenticeship process is far more open than it was a decade ago, most new 
apprentices still come to the program through a family or friend contact who is 
an electrician, she wrote 
</P>
<P>
The program needs to hire a recruiter, broaden the literature it distributes, 
sponsor classes to help increase the exam passing rate, provide sensitivity 
training sessions for management and union staff members and organize more 
appearances before community groups, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Manning, senior consultant to the Los Angeles office of the state Division 
of Apprenticeship Standards, said Dabney's suggestions for more outreach were 
appropriate. "The electricians are doing it, but they have no one assigned to 
it full time," he said. According to the most recent state survey, 21 of the 
570 electrical apprentices in Los Angeles -- 3.6% -- were women. Blacks made up 
6% of the apprentices, Latinos 23%. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Hunt, the head of the labor-management electrician training trust, said 
he disagreed with many of Dabney's criticisms. "I think we've made some great 
strides in trying to get people interested," he said. But he acknowledged that 
the industry is desperate for more trained electricians because union members 
are retiring faster than new apprentices are signing up. 
</P>
<P>
That was a point Dabney wanted to drive home one day last month when she drove 
to Main Street, south of downtown Los Angeles, to try to sell the notion of 
apprenticeship to members of the Los Angeles Conservation Corps, which employs 
young, jobless adults temporarily in community cleanup projects. 
</P>
<P>
"I might not look like an electrician," Dabney said as she stood in front of 
five men and three women, one holding a baby, "but I am." 
</P>
<P>
She was wearing a hard hat and overalls filled with pliers, a screwdriver, tape 
measure and a line tester. She showed her audience how to strip a No. 12-width 
wire and cap the ends with a wire nut. She had them use a pipe-bender to make a 
90-degree bend in a half-inch piece of insulation pipe. She bemoaned the fact 
that only the men asked questions. 
</P>
<P>
Finally a woman raised her hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it real hard for a woman to do that work?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
Dabney sighed, weary of being asked the same old question but glad to step onto 
the soapbox. 
</P>
<P>
"You have special problems," she said. "It does take more effort for a woman, 
but the rewards are greater. When you make a decent wage, you have choices you 
don't have right now. There are other options besides college or working at 
McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
"Any woman can do it because I did it." 
</P>

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTY ISSUE WHO SHOULD TAX WHOM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County supervisors voted to charge cities to book prisoners in the jail 
and to charge schools and special districts to collect property taxes. State 
cuts left the county budget $5.8 million short, and the Legislature allowed the 
fees. Are there alternatives to the fees imposed on cities, schools and special 
districts? 
</P>
<P>
Maggie Erickson 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County supervisor 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know. One of the things that we have done is to put together a 
coalition of all those entities to sit down with the county and to try to see 
if there are alternatives. We met a week or so ago and brainstormed all the 
ideas we could think of. Some of them were financial solutions like finding 
another tax. Some of them were "cut services" alternatives like: Close the 
medical center or contract out for it. We also talked about legislative changes 
where we would look at ways the Legislature could work with us to make more 
money available. We also looked at restructuring. Is there another way for 
local government to utilize the money available to us in better ways? Counties 
are the only entities created by the state and given a mandate by the state for 
the health, welfare and public safety and then given some money by the state 
but not enough to carry out the mandate. I think that if we didn't charge the 
fees, the state would say why are you coming back to us for more money? Go and 
do what we gave you permission to do! 
</P>
<P>
Nina Shelley 
</P>
<P>
Ojai mayor 
</P>
<P>
 The cities and the county met within the last week to discuss that particular 
question. I suggested early on that the other two provisions of Senate Bill 
2557 (the legislation allowing the fees) should be explored by the Board of 
Supervisors. One is the provision for setting a business license fee for 
businesses operating in the unincorporated area of the county. The second 
provision could raise quite a political issue. That provision makes it possible 
for the county to levy a utility tax on those in the unincorporated area. Some 
of my other suggestions may or may not be feasible, but one was to explore a 
fee on real estate sales. Also, inasmuch as our roadways in Ventura County are 
used by many who do not live in this county, it may be interesting to explore 
the idea of toll road charges. That was presented somewhat in a tongue-in-cheek 
fashion; nevertheless, we're up against it. So those are just a few of the 
alternatives that came from Ojai, not necessarily popular but neither is the 
booking fee and certainly not the charge for collecting taxes, which many feel 
is a double payment. 
</P>
<P>
James F. Cowan 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County superintendent of schools 
</P>
<P>
 No. I believe the issue is a state issue and not a local issue really, in that 
I believe the Legislature and the government, by allowing counties to charge 
this fee, were really shifting a state problem to the local people. Just as 
counties are short of money, so are the schools. And to allow the county to 
acquire $3.5 million dollars from the school districts in Ventura County 
creates an unanticipated shortfall for the schools. The alternative would have 
been, and may be in the future, for the state to have established priorities 
and provided the funding to meet those priorities. The alternative for school 
districts is to do the only thing we can do at the moment, and that is to file 
a lawsuit, which we will be doing collectively, statewide. We're trying to make 
the case that the fees are not a logical charge. Then along with it, of course, 
we'll be trying to work with our legislators to see if we can push a 
legislative proposal to exempt the schools from the fees. How successful we'll 
be, I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
Madge L. Schaefer 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County supervisor 
</P>
<P>
 The state Legislature did not consult with the counties when they determined 
these new fees. Counties certainly recognize that local governments have been 
penalized over and over by the tricks of the state Legislature. The county has 
taken a very responsible alternative position. We have formed a coalition of 
cities and special districts to work together for a stable source of funding 
for all these agencies. Just today I asked the six labor unions involved in 
county government to join us in a unified voice, demanding that the Legislature 
stop this kind of activity. The point is the Legislature did not address the 
problem of mandate with no money. They simply tried to pit one group against 
another. Instead, those groups are going to join together and take on the 
Legislature. We're calling this task force the Ventura Model. Ventura is the 
only place where the various entities are meeting to work together on this. We 
have identified the enemy and it is not one another, it is the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Grant R. Brimhall 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks city manager 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, there are alternatives. The most important is that what the state 
mandates, it ought to pay for. Honestly, openly and completely. That's why our 
county is $5 million short or whatever it is. If the state fulfilled its 
obligation to provide revenues consistent with requirements, then the county 
really wouldn't have to balance its budget by taking money from the cities. The 
state created 457 unbalanced city budgets, because every city in this state had 
an adopted budget, and two or three months later, guess what folks? Better 
local cannibalism than the state taking full responsibility. If you look at 
what was taken away from us in booking fees and costs charged to us in terms of 
property tax collection, and then on top of that what the state did not provide 
to the counties -- all together you're talking a chunk of bucks. Fortunately, 
our city is prudent and is financially solvent. We're being penalized for our 
solvency and being adversely affected because we do pay as we go, and 
unfortunately the state does not.

CANDIDATE'S OLD WORLD SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As more and more political signs appear it becomes increasingly clear that one 
of our Moorpark mayoral candidates has his feet firmly planted on the green 
hills of his Old World birthplace. Is Clint Harper still living, in his heart, 
in those misty isles where the days are soft and where the green hills will 
stay that way because they were hunting preserves owned by the monarch? 
</P>
<P>
This is not a soft land; it is by nature harsh and arid. It becomes green and 
benevolent only when man goes to the time and expense to develop it. And we 
have no monarch who will give us vast tracts of green hills just so we can look 
at them. 
</P>
<P>
Sir, your signs are beautiful and no doubt expensive, but that hill is nowhere 
to be found in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps I have been unfair. Perhaps that sign is not your Old World birthplace. 
It could be a New World hill. In Patagonia, perhaps?

HUBBLE TO VIEW HUGE SATURN STORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The space agency is preparing to use the Hubble Space Telescope to observe a 
celestial spectacle: a gargantuan storm on Saturn that is 1 1/2 times wider 
than the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
"It's creating a lot of excitement. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the space telescope people heard about it, they wanted to point the 
telescope at it," said Daniel Green of the International Astronomical Union's 
Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, a reporting agency for discoveries 
in space. The bureau notified Hubble scientists about the storm. 
</P>
<P>
The oval-shaped white spot on the solar system's second-largest planet is 
growing, and now measures 12,500 miles wide by 3,100 miles long, New Mexico 
State University astronomer Reta Beebe said last week. By comparison, Earth has 
a diameter of about 7,900 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Beebe said Saturn's new storm has formed a disturbance that includes two 
smaller white spots. The disturbance stretches 50,000 miles east to west -- 
about one-fifth of the way around the equatorial region of the ringed planet -- 
and 3,100 miles north to south, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Such storms appear on Saturn roughly once every 30 Earth years -- the length of 
a single year on Saturn. They are probably created by a sudden upwelling of 
Saturn's internal heat that carries ammonia gas high into the planet's 
atmosphere, where it freezes into white crystals of ammonia ice, Beebe said.

STAR FOUND TO BE KILLING NEIGHBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Astronomers have discovered a tiny, rapidly rotating neutron star that appears 
to be murdering a companion sun in a case of celestial fratricide that promises 
to shed light on stellar evolution and death. The "eclipsing millisecond 
pulsar," the massive remnant of an exploded sun, and its companion white dwarf 
star are located in Terzan 5, a globular star cluster near the center of the 
Milky Way galaxy at a distance of about 24,000 light years. 
</P>
<P>
The newly discovered pulsar, known as PSR 1744-24, and its white dwarf 
companion whirl about each other every 109 minutes at a distance of just 18,600 
miles -- 1/13th the distance from the Earth to the moon -- according to a 
report in the British journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
The pulsar, about six miles wide, has 1 1/2 times the mass of our sun. The 
white dwarf, a small star in the final stages of its life, is about the size of 
the Earth. The two stars are so close to each other that the pulsar's intense 
radiation is blowing away the atmosphere of the white dwarf so that it will 
eventually dwindle to nothing, researchers said.

VOTES CAST COST MONEY

<TEXT>
<P>
The voters of California on Nov. 6 will face one of the longest, most 
complicated, and surely one of the most costly ballots ever. With 28 
propositions and a potential cost of nearly $20 billion, restraint is urged. 
</P>
<P>
The voter must use the same caution with his vote as he would with his personal 
credit card. There will always be items that we think we want, but can't afford 
and we must say "NO." 
</P>
<P>
Before the June primary election, the state had a bonded indebtedness of $4.8 
billion, with an additional $7.4 billion in bonds approved but not sold. In 
June the voters approved every bond issue on the ballot for an additional $5 
billion, bringing the total state debt to $17.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
How much debt can California afford? At what point will the state lose its 
favorable credit rating? Perhaps we need an initiative to limit the number of 
initiatives allowed on one ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Taxpayers Assn. urges allvoters to think about the debt, 
which is their debt, when they mark their ballot.

15,000 TURN OUT FOR 1ST HARVEST FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
More than 15,000 people turned out over the weekend for what is expected to be 
an annual Harvest Festival at the Ventura County Fairgrounds, spokeswoman Kaye 
Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a phenomenal response. 
</P>
<P>
This has broken by several thousand people what we had anticipated," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The event, which featured arts, crafts and holiday gifts from about 220 
exhibitors, included booths filled with everything from incense to batik, and 
from wooden toys to corn-husk dolls. Most of the goods were handmade by 
professional artists. 
</P>
<P>
Even though thousands of people wandered through the two large Quonset huts and 
the tented area in between, some of the vendors said sales were not as brisk as 
they would have liked. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Leprone traveled from Santa Cruz to offer her whimsical ceramic animals 
for sale. She attributed the slow business to the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
"Friday was really slow here, and I think it was because people were home 
watching baseball," she said. Saturday and Sunday were busier, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We all know it's a risk to come to a first show like this one in Ventura. We 
have more lookers than buyers, but even if you don't do gangbusters with sales, 
it's good advertising," Leprone said. 
</P>
<P>
The Harvest Festival got its start in San Francisco in 1973 and now includes 16 
shows nationwide through the fall. The show is likely to return to Ventura next 
year, Chandler said. KAREN McKEAN

AREA CONGRESSMEN'S NEWSLETTERS COST $619,802; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: SEVEN LAWMAKERS SENT 4.3 MILLION PIECES OF MAIL TO CONSTITUENTS IN 
1989. REP. JERRY LEWIS SPENT THE MOST -- $214,549 FOR FIVE MAILINGS.

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) used them to stress his opposition to military 
base closings and support for a constitutional amendment outlawing flag 
burning. Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) used them to talk about health 
fairs and long-term medical care. 
</P>
<P>
Across the country, lawmakers are using congressional newsletters to tell their 
constituents about pressing issues, pending legislation and personal concerns 
-- all at taxpayer expense and with minimal public reporting. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Valley area congressmen say these mass mailings are a valuable way 
to communicate with constituents about federal benefits and their 
representatives' priorities. Congressional watchdog groups, on the other hand, 
contend that they are the equivalent of publicly funded campaign pieces. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley area's seven House members sent 17 districtwide newsletters -- or 
about 4.3 million pieces of mail -- to their constituents at a cost of $619,802 
in 1989, according to a recent study by the National Taxpayers Union, a 
Washington-based group dedicated to reducing government spending. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the local members spent an average of 32 cents on each household in 
their districts for postage and printing costs, matching the national average. 
The figures were obtained by dividing a lawmaker's total newsletter spending by 
the number of households in his district. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the list among area legislators was Lewis, whose sprawling 35th 
District includes part of Palmdale. He sent five newsletters at an estimated 
cost of $214,549. He was followed by Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), who 
mailed five at a cost of $185,179, the study found. Each spent 71 cents per 
household in his respective district. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly used his newsletters to emphasize his support for an expanded federal 
death penalty, a constitutional amendment against flag burning and tough 
anti-drug measures. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers were permitted to send a maximum of six newsletters last year; 
Congress cut the figure to three this year. The House voted Sunday to limit a 
member's spending on official mail to $178,000 a year and require individual 
lawmakers to disclose mailing costs on a quarterly basis. 
</P>
<P>
The newsletters -- which often contain multiple photos of lawmakers and portray 
them as champions of their constituents and pet causes -- have long been 
lambasted by congressional critics as a waste of tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the guise of so-called official mailings, the American taxpayer is being 
asked to fund what often amounts to political campaigning," said James 
Davidson, chairman of the 200,000-member Taxpayers Union. 
</P>
<P>
The nonpartisan group said that its figures represent "just the tip of the 
iceberg of congressional franking costs for 1989" because it is difficult to 
obtain information about many of the mailing expenses for individual members. 
The group estimated that House members spent $30 million to send out 215 
million newsletter pieces last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Taxpayers Union gleaned its figures from the files of the congressional 
franking commission, which must approve each newsletter to determine that it 
does not violate House rules, including a prohibition on overtly partisan 
material. The Senate keeps records of individual members' spending on mail; the 
House does not. 
</P>
<P>
Most elusive are the public costs for letters or mailings that are addressed to 
individual constituents with particular interests, such as senior citizens or 
veterans. These sophisticated, and costly, targeted mailings were not included 
in the Taxpayers Union survey. 
</P>
<P>
Most lawmakers who send many newsletters, which are mailed to postal patrons, 
also send numerous individually addressed pieces, said David Keating, the 
Taxpayers Union's executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
This was not the case, however, with Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), 
who did not send any newsletters last year but mailed tens of thousands of 
individually addressed pieces to various groups in his 26th District. 
</P>
<P>
Berman sent 14 different targeted mailings in 1989, an aide said. Those living 
near Burbank airport were informed about an airplane noise study; residents in 
the vicinity of Hansen Dam were briefed about revitalization plans; and Jewish 
constituents were told about the growing number of Soviet refugees unable to 
come to the United States because of caps on immigration. 
</P>
<P>
"Inevitably, a lot of information in the newsletter is not going to be of 
interest to a lot of those people and it just becomes enormously self-serving," 
said Gene Smith, Berman's administrative assistant, in explaining why Berman 
sends targeted mailings rather than newsletters. 
</P>
<P>
The Taxpayers Union survey also did not include complete figures for postcards 
sent to constituents to alert them to town meetings with their elected 
representative. Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles), who mailed only one 
newsletter, on the federal budget deficit (at a cost of $36,249), also 
distributed tens of thousands of town meeting notices. 
</P>
<P>
Keating of the Taxpayers Union said that some lawmakers may wind up spending as 
much as $800,000 in 1989 and 1990 for direct printing and postage costs for all 
their mailings. In addition, congressional staffers spend much time planning, 
writing and laying out the newsletters. 
</P>
<P>
The newsletter cost figures for other Valley area lawmakers, each of whom sent 
two districtwide mailings, were: $74,184 for Waxman; $71,841 for Rep. Carlos J. 
Moorhead (R-Glendale); and $37,800 for Rep. William M. Thomas (R-Bakersfield), 
whose 20th District includes much of the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
A favorite newsletter technique is to survey constituents about issues. In 
1989, Beilenson asked about the federal budget deficit, Moorhead asked about 
air pollution problems and Gallegly and Lewis inquired about major issues in 
general. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly and Lewis also asked about the value of congressional newsletters in 
their surveys. Spokesmen for each lawmaker cited the favorable response as 
support for using tax dollars for the mailings. 
</P>
<P>
"Our constituents do tell us they enjoy receiving the newsletters and we get 
very, very little mail from our constituents saying they don't," said John 
Frith, Gallegly's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Professional pollsters, however, say that the response rates for these surveys 
are so low that the tallies should not be considered a valid measure of public 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the two lawmakers also noted that Lewis and Gallegly voted for 
the measure that cut in half the maximum number of newsletters permitted this 
year and support the latest reform proposal that is pending before Congress. 
Lewis, in fact, sponsored last year's bill to cut the maximum number of 
newsletters in half. 
</P>
<P>
"Responding to constituent mail and sending occasional newsletters are a 
legitimate means of communicating to my constituents," Lewis said. "Anything 
beyond that . . . is excessive." 
</P>
<P>
Waxman also defended the mailings to constituents. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps me tell them what I'm doing," he said. "It gives them a sense of what 
my priorities are." 
</P>
<P>
And what about the political benefits? 
</P>
<P>
"There are political benefits in doing a good job," Waxman replied.

2 CRITICALLY INJURED IN TRUCK ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One man was near death and a second was in critical condition with head 
injuries at a Ventura hospital Sunday after they were thrown from the bed of a 
pickup truck on California 150 near Lake Casitas. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the truck and two passengers in the cab left the accident scene 
on foot before officers arrived shortly after 3:30 p.m. Saturday, the 
California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
Esteven Lopez, 30, of Santa Barbara was being kept on life-support systems in 
the intensive care unit at Ventura County Medical Center, a nursing supervisor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Raoul Teran, 20, of Santa Barbara, suffered major head injuries and was also in 
the hospital's intensive care unit on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The two men were airlifted to the hospital following the accident. 
</P>
<P>
A third passenger who was ejected from the truck bed, Juan Echevarria, 17, of 
Santa Barbara, was treated for minor injuries and released, a hospital nurse 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The truck was headed west on California 150 five miles west of Santa Ana Road 
and about five miles east of the Ventura-Santa Barbara County line when the 
truck ran off the road and hit a rock embankment, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers did not know the cause of the accident.

SURGERY SAVES LIFE OF FETUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the latest of a series of daring operations, UC San Francisco surgeons saved 
the life of one of two fetuses with a deformed lung by performing surgery in 
the womb, it was reported last week in the British medical journal The Lancet. 
</P>
<P>
Although doctors have performed successful operations on fetuses for other 
ailments, the new cases are the first in which surgery was done for a condition 
called congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, or CCAM, the researchers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
CCAM is a rare disorder in which damaging cysts grow in the lungs of developing 
fetuses. 
</P>
<P>
The 72-minute procedure involved making an incision in the mother's uterus and 
pulling the left arm and chest of the fetus through the opening. Surgeons then 
cut open the chest of the fetus, surgically removed the malformed lung lobe, 
put the fetus back in the womb and closed the incision. 
</P>
<P>
The baby was delivered through Caesarean section seven weeks later and was 
doing well five months later, the doctors reported.

SPOTLIGHT / A GLANCE AT THIS WEEK IN THE NFL; 
</P>
<P>
DIRTY WATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Philadelphia safety Andre Waters has been accused by many of taking cheap 
shots. Sunday, he said the NFL had taken one at him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a raw deal," an angry Waters said after Philadelphia's 13-7 loss to the 
Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
Waters was fined an undisclosed amount by the league for going after Minnesota 
quarterback Rich Gannon's knees in last week's Monday night game. ABC announcer 
Dan Dierdorf called Waters a dirty player. 
</P>
<P>
Waters chased TV cameramen away from his locker after Sunday's game, waving his 
arms and shouting, "Philadelphia cameras get away, all of them! No Philadelphia 
cameras!" 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles were victimized twice by roughing penalties Sunday that helped the 
Redskins drive to two fourth-quarter field goals. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Byron Evans was called for a personal foul two minutes into the 
fourth quarter when he fell over Washington quarterback Stan Humphries and 
elbowed him in the head as Humphries threw a long pass incomplete. The 15-yard 
penalty moved the ball to the Eagles' 23 and Chip Lohmiller eventually kicked a 
33-yard field goal for a 10-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Izel Jenkins was called for unsportsmanlike conduct with about five minutes 
left when he got into a shoving match with tackle Ed Simmons after a short 
gain. The gain and penalty combined for 19 yards, putting the ball on 
Philadelphia's 30 and Lohmiller later kicked a 39-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to sound like a crybaby, but they're watching us more closely 
than they are the Redskins," Waters said. "I'm not out there trying to hurt 
nobody. I'm just an aggressive, physical player. That's my game. I enjoy mixing 
it up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SWEPT AWAY 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland Athletics, swept out of the World Series by the Cincinnati Reds, 
have plenty of company in the NFL these days. Of nine two-game series completed 
this season, each has been swept. 
</P>
<P>
The Buffalo Bills and Dallas Cowboys were the latest to finish off an opponent 
for the second time. The Bills rallied in the final minute to defeat the New 
York Jets, 30-27, after winning by a 30-7 decision in their first meeting. 
Dallas also scored in the last minute to beat Tampa Bay, 17-13, and defeated 
the Buccaneers, 14-10, earlier in the season. 
</P>
<P>
Other sweeps this season have been accomplished by the Raiders over the Seattle 
Seahawks (17-13 and 24-17), the San Francisco 49ers over the Atlanta Falcons 
(19-13 and 45-35), the Chicago Bears over the Green Bay Packers (31-13 and

New York Giants over the Cowboys (28-7 and 31-17) and the Washington Redskins 
over the Phoenix Cardinals (31-0 and 38-10). 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay Coach Ray Perkins expected a breakthrough against the Cowboys. 
"Dallas is a team that we definitely felt like we should've won against both 
times," he said. "I guess somebody else has their own ideas of what is supposed 
to happen this year. We set out to break the trend." 
</P>
<P>
BIG PLAYS 
</P>
<P>
Matt Bahr converted a 40-yard field goal on the final play, capping a 10-point 
rally in the final 3:21 and lifting the New York Giants to a 20-19 victory over 
the Phoenix Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Troy Aikman threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to Michael Irvin with 23 seconds 
remaining to lead the Dallas Cowboys to a 17-13 victory over the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Kelly threw four touchdown passes, including the go-ahead score to Jamie 
Mueller with 19 seconds left, as the Buffalo Bills defeated the New York Jets, 
30-27. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Jackson ran for two touchdowns in his 1990 football debut to lead the 
Raiders to a 24-9 victory over the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NAMES AND NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana of the San Francisco 49ers passed for only 157 yards against 
Pittsburgh, ending his streak of 300-yard passing games at four, one short of 
his own NFL record. . . . The 49ers rushed for more than 100 yards for the 
first time this season and Tom Rathman scored the team's first two rushing 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas Cowboys are now 8-0 in games against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 
including two postseason victories. . . . Kicker Steve Christie of Tampa Bay 
missed a 37-yard attempt in the first quarter, ending his streak of 11 field 
goals in a row. . . . Vinny Testaverde of Tampa Bay has thrown at least one 
touchdown pass in each game this season. 
</P>
<P>
The New Orleans Saints, 23-10 losers to the Houston Oilers, last lost to an 
American Conference team on Dec. 7, 1986 when the Miami Dolphins beat them 
31-27. With 13 consecutive interconference victories, they share the NFL record 
with the Dolphins, whose streak went from 1978 to 1981. . . . New Orleans 
kicker Morten Andersen, who had a field goal and conversion against Houston, 
has scored in 100 consecutive 
</P>
<P>
games. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Ellard became the Rams' all-time leader in receiving yardage with six 
receptions for 109 yards against the Atlanta Falcons. That gave the nine-year 
veteran out of Fresno State 6,311 yards for his career, bettering Elroy 
Hirsch's club record of 6,289. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's Art Monk caught three passes for 62 yards, giving him at least one 
reception in 106 consecutive games. That pushes him past Danny Abramowicz for 
the fourth-longest streak in NFL history. Steve Largent retired from the 
Seattle Seahawks after last season with a streak of 177 games. . . . Despite 
four misses Sunday, the Redskins' Chip Lohmiller has kicked field goals in 26 
consecutive games, five short of the NFL record. 
</P>
<P>
Indianapolis' Stanley Morgan caught two passes against Denver, giving him 542 
career receptions, which moved him past Kellen Winslow and into a tie for 14th 
place on the NFL all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT 
</P>
<P>
Eric Dickerson, playing his first game since December after a prolonged 
dispute, was greeted by a chorus of boos on the Colts' first offensive series. 
He quickly turned them into cheers, gaining 11 yards on his first carry to 
become the NFL's sixth-leading rusher and picking up 20 on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson, the only back in NFL history to rush for 1,000 yards in seven 
consecutive years, passed O.J. Simpson's 11,236-yard rushing total and he also 
moved into 10th place on the NFL career list for combined yardage on his first 
rush, moving past Ollie Matson's 12,884-yard total. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson, recalled from the non-football injured list after signing a 
four-year contract extension earlier in the week, is 71 yards short of tying 
John Riggins for fifth place on the career rushing list. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOGGING THE SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
<P>
Former Redskin John Riggins stole the show at a halftime ceremony of the 
Philadelphia-Washington game in which four athletes were inducted into 
Washington's Hall of Stars. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins ran onto the field in his old No. 44 uniform and carrying a bouquet of 
roses to the sound of a diesel horn that used to accompany some of his 
punishing runs. He looked almost ready to play as he bowed deeply to the crowd, 
recalling the bow he took after a record-setting performance in a 1983 playoff 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Riggins in the local hall of fame were quarterback Joe Theismann -- 
Riggins' teammate on two Super Bowl teams -- former Bullet basketball star 
Elvin Hayes, former Redskin trainer Joe Kuczo and the late Joe Judge, a first 
baseman for the Washington Senators who batted .299 from 1915-32. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IN QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh Coach Chuck Noll on San Francisco defensive end Charles Haley, who 
had six tackles and two consecutive sacks, the second of which forced a fumble 
that set up a touchdown: "We all took turns not being able to block him." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Irvin, who caught a 28-yard touchdown pass to give the Cowboys a 
last-minute victory: "That's what football is all about. It's a wide receiver's 
dream." 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans quarterback Steve Walsh, on his debut (22 of 39, 292 yards) as a 
starter: "I'm still not where I'd like to be, but I feel like I'm making 
progress. I've learned the system. I just need more experience with it." 
</P>
<P>
New York Jet defensive tackle Dennis Byrd on 30-27 loss to Buffalo: "We don't 
deal in moral victories." 
</P>
<P>
Seattle's Norm Johnson, who kicked four field goals in a victory over Kansas 
City: "People talk about having stress on the job. But I don't think people can 
know what stress is until they've been in my shoes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
Kicker Tony Zendejas of the Houston Oilers sustained a broken leg on his 
planting foot while kicking off following his third field goal. Zendejas broke 
his left fibula and will be out of action from four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo lost running back Thurman Thomas when he suffered a bruised knee in the 
first quarter against the New York Jets. Thomas will undergo a magnetic 
resonance imaging examination today. 
</P>
<P>
Denver's Bobby Humphrey, who went into Sunday's game at Indianapolis as the 
NFL's leading rusher despite missing his last game with a sprained ankle, 
reinjured the ankle on the second play, a 37-yard gain on a screen pass that 
was nullified because of a penalty. He returned briefly, but gained just five 
yards in three carries. 
</P>
<P>
New York's Phil Simms, the NFL's top-rated quarterback coming into the Giants' 
game against Phoenix, hurt his left ankle late in the first quarter and did not 
return. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Joe Montana left the game against Pittsburgh midway through the 
fourth quarter with a sprained finger on his throwing hand. . . . Receiver John 
Taylor of the 49ers bruised a knee in the first quarter and did not return.

CROSS-TRAINING JUST A SNAP AS BO STARTS IN MIDSEASON FORM; 
</P>
<P>
RAIDERS: JACKSON'S ONLY PROBLEM IN 1990 FOOTBALL DEBUT IS KEEPING HIS HELMET ON 
AGAINST CHARGERS. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bo Jackson's helmet was rolling on the field like a bowling ball after San 
Diego safety Martin Bayless welcomed the Raider tailback back to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
But Jackson was smiling when he got up after Bayless knocked his helmet off 
with a jarring hit. 
</P>
<P>
"That's part of my game plan," Jackson explained later. "The object of it is to 
have three of your four (helmet) buttons fastened and let the last one stay 
open so when they hit you your helmet flies off and it makes them think they're 
hitting you hard, which they're really not. Then you put your helmet on and go 
do it again. It's just a little psychology." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson lost his helmet twice that way against the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Is Jackson's psychological ploy effective? 
</P>
<P>
"Of course," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
But Bayless thought it wasn't a ploy. 
</P>
<P>
"If you see his helmet flying 10 yards you know what happened," Bayless said. 
"All I know is that his helmet came off. That's like a person driving a car 
without a seat belt." 
</P>
<P>
But Raider nose tackle Bob Golic joked that Jackson didn't fasten his helmet 
because Jackson, playing his first football game this season after spending 
nine months with the Kansas City Royals, was so confused that he thought he was 
wearing a baseball helmet. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter how bad I talk about Golic, he'll take it as a compliment," 
Jackson said 
</P>
<P>
Said Golic: "I just told him to buckle up because this ain't baseball any more. 
He's a tough guy." 
</P>
<P>
Switching sports as quickly as Diana Ross changes costumes, Jackson rushed for 
53 yards in 12 carries and scored two touchdowns as the Raiders defeated the 
Chargers, 24-9. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got some bruises," Jackson said, maintaining that it took only one hit 
for him to get reacclimated. "But they'll only last for a day or so. Luckily 
we've got a week off and I'll be healed before we go to Kansas City." 
</P>
<P>
It was the third most productive opening game of Jackson's four NFL seasons. He 
rushed for 37 yards and no touchdowns against New England in his first game of 
the 1987 season and gained 70 yards in 20 carries and scored a touchdown 
against the Kansas City Chiefs in his first game of the 1988 season. Jackson 
rushed for 85 yards in 11 carries and scored a touchdown against the Chiefs in 
his first game last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo did basically what I thought he would do," Raider Coach Art Shell said. "He 
came in and ran hard and scored a couple of touchdowns. That's Bo Jackson. He's 
a big play guy. Bo did all right for the first time out." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson did most of the work in the Raiders' first touchdown drive, rushing for 
28 yards on five carries as the Raiders went 35 yards in six plays to take a 
10-3 lead on Jackson's five-yard touchdown run with 8:51 left in the first 
half. Although the play was designed to go inside, he cut it to the outside and 
carried linebacker Henry Rolling into the end zone on his back like a sack of 
flour. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter if someone's on my back," Jackson said. "If I've got the 
strength to pull them into the end zone, that's what I'm going to do. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun playing football because you can't hit anybody in baseball without 
getting thrown out of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Like most smart running backs, Jackson credited his offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
"The line blocked their (butts) off and gave me a crack and I took it," Jackson 
said. "It was just hard-nosed blocking. Whenever they give you holes like they 
were giving you this afternoon you can't do anything but run for daylight." 
</P>
<P>
With Greg Bell sidelined with a sprained ankle, Jackson replaced Bell in the 
Raiders' tailback rotation. He alternated with starting tailback Marcus Allen, 
who rushed for 45 yards in eight carries and caught three passes for 50 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Is it a problem for Jackson to alternate with Allen? 
</P>
<P>
"I think we do a good job splitting time," Jackson said. "I don't think we have 
any selfish players on the team. Whether it's Marcus and (fullback Steve Smith) 
back there or Steve and Bo or Vance (Mueller) and Steve, we go out there and we 
play to win, not to go out and say, 'Hey, I am the starting tailback here and I 
run the show.' It's not like that because whenever you start to have 
individuals on a team, that's when you start going downhill." 
</P>
<P>
Although Allen opened the game in the Raider backfield, Jackson started the 
second half. Jackson culminated the Raiders' first drive of the third quarter 
by scoring on a seven-yard run to give the Raiders a 17-6 lead. This play was 
designed to go outside, but Jackson cut inside at the two and ran over Charger 
cornerback Sam Seale at the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
Although Jackson practiced for just one week after playing baseball for nine 
months, he appeared in superb football shape. 
</P>
<P>
Raider quarterback Jay Schroeder, who played in the Toronto Blue Jays' farm 
system before deciding to concentrate on football, marvels at Jackson's ability 
to play major league baseball and pro football. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a credit to Bo," Schroeder said. "To be able to come in after 
playing baseball for nine months, take 10 days off and play in a big-time 
football game is just phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
Raider defensive end Howie Long, whom Jackson describes as his closest friend 
on the Raiders, loves to watch Jackson run. 
</P>
<P>
"He has so much power that he just drags two or three people three or four 
yards," Long said of Jackson. "You better buckle it up when you tackle him. 
Just ask those cornerbacks." 
</P>
<P>
But Jackson's speed enables him to outrun cornerbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you ever been behind a Porsche when the turbo kicks in and it's like an 
explosion and it jets from 80 to (110)?" Long asked.

EVERETT GETS HIS REVENGE ON GLANVILLE; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: QUARTERBACK HASN'T FORGOTTEN WHAT COACH HAS SAID ABOUT HIM DURING HIS 
HOLDOUT DAYS IN HOUSTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Twice Sunday afternoon, Jim Everett had that look on his face, the look in 
which the eyes inflate like miniature blimps and the smile shifts into spread 
formation. 
</P>
<P>
The first time came in the third quarter, when Everett spotted the Atlanta 
Falcons in a full-on safety blitz, which left Flipper Anderson twiddling his 
thumbs far downfield, awaiting the re-entry of Everett's 37-yard touchdown lob. 
</P>
<P>
The second time came in the locker room, when someone asked Everett about the 
personal satisfaction derived by beating Jerry Glanville at his own game, in a 
rout, by a final score of 44-24. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good," Everett said without a moment's hesitation. "It's nice to even the 
series with him. 
</P>
<P>
"But we still have another one. I'm sure we haven't heard the last of Jerry 
Glanville." 
</P>
<P>
Everett hasn't. Ever since he refused to sign with Glanville's Houston Oilers 
in 1986, forcing his eventual trade to the Rams, he's had to handle an earful. 
</P>
<P>
Everett can't take a hit, Jerry jabbed. 
</P>
<P>
Everett has chicken legs . . . and a heart to go with it. 
</P>
<P>
Everett sure looks like he could use some real coaching. 
</P>
<P>
Hell hath no fury like a football coach scorned. 
</P>
<P>
Glanville had the opportunity to rub it in in 1987, when the Oilers upset the 
Rams on opening day, 20-16, under the Astrodome. And you know Glanville. He has 
never been one to let an opportunity go to waste. 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, Glanville was back in black, Atlanta Falcon black, and 
Everett turned the reunion into a dark affair, completing 24 of 38 passes for 
302 yards, three touchdowns and a Ram triumph. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-four points, counterpoint? 
</P>
<P>
"I just like to win, period," Everett said. "It goes beyond anything between 
two people. It great to see your teammates with smiles on their faces. It's 
good to see the light in their eyes. We've been through some damn hard times 
the past five weeks." 
</P>
<P>
The past five weeks, Everett's Rams were 1-4. That put them behind everyone 
else in the NFC West, including Glanville's Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
Everett admitted waiting for this one with special anticipation. The sensation 
first struck about the same time the Glanville-to-Atlanta story first hit the 
wires. 
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to playing him," Everett said. "There are some things that 
happened down there (in Houston) that were the cause of Jerry Glanville, but 
it's his style to be the voice of the team. He has a very aggressive attitude, 
and it's his way of trying to rally a team around him." 
</P>
<P>
More than that, Everett believes Glanville rallied an entire city around him -- 
and against Everett -- during the embittered holdout days of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"Here I was," Everett said, "a 22-year old man who just wants to play the game 
of football, and here's Houston, wanting to pay me second-round money when I 
was the third guy taken in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to live with being trade bait. It's tough on a young guy. . . . Jerry 
was saying things about me during the holdout and, basically, he had the ear of 
everyone in Houston. He's calling me a greedy young kid. All I wanted was to be 
treated the way I was supposed to be." 
</P>
<P>
Everett has found it in Anaheim, where the Rams not only rolled out the red 
carpet, but had it dry-cleaned and lined with rose petals. The Rams gave him a 
$14-million contract, an impenetrable offensive line, the fleetest fleet of 
receivers this side of the Golden Gate. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything turned out for the best," Everett notes. 
</P>
<P>
Now in his fifth NFL season, Everett has the benefit of perspective and time's 
passage. Today, he says, "I don't know if that was really Jerry talking then. 
He might have been pressured. We were just two pawns on the board." 
</P>
<P>
If Glanville won't publicly reveal any new respect for Everett, his actions 
Sunday spoke loudly enough. If Everett still rattled in the pocket under 
pressure, Glanville would have sent his linebackers and safeties blitzing from 
kickoff to sundown. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Atlanta's defense came out backpedaling, choosing containment over 
derailment, which Everett claimed was one reason he needed a quarter -- and a 
10-0 deficit -- before he got jump-started. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially, we were prepared for the blitz all the time," Everett said. "But 
they came out in a loose zone. They were playing a scheme designed not to give 
up the big play. It took me a little time to adjust." 
</P>
<P>
The adjustment took Everett from a five-for-14 start to 14 completions in his 
next 16 attempts. Along the way, the Rams scored on eight consecutive 
possessions, outpointing the Falcons in the process, 44-7. 
</P>
<P>
And for Everett, no points were sweeter than the ones Anderson produced on one 
of the very few times Glanville called for the blitz. 
</P>
<P>
"We were prepared for that," Everett said, grinning again. "I saw 'em coming 
right away and I was yelling to (fullback) Buford (McGee) -- 'Buford, Buford, 
here he comes, pick him up!' 
</P>
<P>
"Buford made the block and all I had to do was pick a spot and throw to it. 
Flipper just ran it down." 
</P>
<P>
Now the scoreboard reads: Everett 1, Glanville 1. The two still haven't spoken 
since Everett left Houston. After Sunday's game, Everett shook hands with 
several Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
But not Glanville. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe if he has something pertinent to say someday, I'll respond," Everett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Glanville was too busy assessing his own damage to address old battle lines 
with old quarterbacks, so Everett got the last word, on the field and off. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to respect Jerry as a coach," Everett said. "He knows how to 
motivate a team. But he doesn't put on a helmet. He doesn't put on the pads. 
We're in two different realms." 
</P>
<P>
Kind of sounds as if Everett wouldn't mind seeing Jerry lining up at free 
safety the next time their paths cross. 
</P>
<P>
Everett laughed at the suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't say that."

Southern California harness horsemen began moving many of their standardbreds 
to Del Mar Sunday after a 42-night stand concluded Saturday at Los Alamitos 
Race Course. 
</P>
<P>
The horsemen were rescued from limbo Saturday by the Western Standardbred 
Assn., which had been negotiating for the state-owned Del Mar site during the 
week with the California Horse Racing Board, California Thoroughbred Breeders 
Assn. and the 22nd Agricultural District of Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Standardbreds will be allowed to use the Del Mar race track through Feb. 2 and 
remain in the barn area through Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Quarter horses take over Los Alamitos this week for a meet to begin Friday and 
run through Feb. 2. Harness horses return the following week for a 10-week meet 
through mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably 600 to 700 horses from here will go down, plus another 300 yearlings 
from the East," said Lloyd Arnold, president and general manager of Los 
Alamitos. "The Del Mar training site is very critical. Without it, we'd be in 
trouble. Horses have to be ready for opening day here. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, we won't open here in February unless we can put on a first-class meet. 
If we don't get the Pomona dates we've requested from April to August, the 
horses at Del Mar will leave. Del Mar is just a holding pen until we find out 
what the CHRB is going to do with our dates." 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos has applied to lease dates from Fairplex Park in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Alamitos meet concluded with an average nightly attendance of 4,495 and 
an average nightly handle of $773,985.

IS NEW YORK'S BAN ON LASIX A SHAM?; 
</P>
<P>
HORSE RACING: BLEEDER MEDICATION WON'T BE ALLOWED FOR BREEDERS' CUP RACES, BUT 
HORSES MIGHT BE GETTING 'BLEEDER THERAPY.'

<P>
Four years ago, a California trainer brought a horse to Belmont Park to run in 
a stake race. 
</P>
<P>
The horse was a bleeder, a thoroughbred who sometimes suffers from pulmonary 
hemorrhaging because of the stress of running. The trainer, who asked that his 
name not be used in this story, knew that the horse wouldn't be able to run on 
Lasix because of New York racing rules. Lasix is a diuretic that is commonly 
given to bleeders in all other major American racing jurisdictions, but is 
banned here as well as in Canada and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The morning of the stake, the veteran New York veterinarian hired by the 
trainer visited the California horse's barn. 
</P>
<P>
"The state vet been here yet?" the veterinarian asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No, not yet," an assistant trainer told him. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I'll be back later," the veterinarian said. 
</P>
<P>
New York, which prohibits horses from racing with medication, is one of the few 
states that takes blood tests of horses on their race days, and a horse is 
scratched and the trainer usually fined if the test turns up positive. 
</P>
<P>
Later that morning, after the state veterinarian had taken his blood sample and 
left, the private veterinarian returned to the barn and treated the California 
horse. The horse finished fourth, and eight days later, back in California, the 
trainer received his veterinarian's bill. He was surprised to see this race-day 
item: 
</P>
<P>
"Bleeder therapy injection . . . $15." 
</P>
<P>
The trainer told the story to suggest, as others have, that while New York 
preaches about running its horses on only hay, water and oats and advises that 
the rest of the country to do the same, the reality of racing here is that 
horses are somehow pharmaceutically treated for bleeding and still pass their 
post-race tests. 
</P>
<P>
Racing's medication controversy simmers most of the year, while industry 
leaders mull inconclusive surveys and equine bleeder research goes 
under-funded, but during the Triple Crown series and at Breeders' Cup time in 
New York, the issue moves to the front burner. This Saturday, at Belmont, the 
Breeders' Cup -- seven races worth $10 million -- will be run in New York for 
the second time, and the leading topics for conversation will be the general 
weakness of the injury-riddled fields and how horses who bleed will run without 
medication that they have been given elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Of the quality horses that remain from a season with a staggering attrition 
rate, many are bleeders. They include Dispersal, who could wind up being 
favored in the $3-million Classic; Bayakoa, who is trying to win the $1-million 
Distaff for the second year in a row; Steinlen, the defending champion in the 
$1-million Mile; Best Pal, California's best hope to win the $1-million 
Juvenile; and Safely Kept, the filly in the $1-million Sprint who is trying to 
improve on her second-place finish a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall, a horse who could have added some much-needed interest to the 
Classic, will not run solely because of a serious bleeding problem. Second in 
the Kentucky Derby and winner of the Preakness, Summer Squall skipped the 
Belmont Stakes and the chance to win a $1-million Triple Crown bonus, because 
he wouldn't be able to run on Lasix here. His owners were leaning toward 
running the colt in the Breeders' Cup until Summer Squall bled profusely 
despite being treated with Lasix in the Meadowlands Cup in New Jersey Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the Daily Racing Form began publishing Lasix information in 
past-performance records, and of the 110 horses who were pre-entered for the 
Breeders' Cup a week ago, at least 35 have run while being treated with the 
diuretic in the second half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Of these bleeders, many -- including Dispersal, Bayakoa, Steinlen and Safely 
Kept -- have won races in New York without apparent problems. Unbridled, the 
bleeder who with Lasix won the Kentucky Derby and finished second in the 
Preakness, still ran in the Belmont, partly because Summer Squall's absence 
virtually assured his owner of the $1-million Triple Crown bonus. Unbridled 
underwent dehydration as a bleeding preventive for the Belmont, and while he 
didn't bleed, he ran a poor fourth while still earning the bonus. Winless in a 
stake race since the Derby, Unbridled will run Saturday in the Classic. 
</P>
<P>
When the Breeders' Cup was held at nearby Aqueduct in 1985, bleeder information 
was not published. At least eight starters in the seven races were bleeders, 
and while Smile was second in the Sprint and Gate Dancer ran second in the 
Classic, none of the other bleeders won while running without Lasix. 
</P>
<P>
Some horsemen from outside New York say many New York horses run on medication, 
but that the legal drug levels here are high enough to prevent most post-race 
tests from being positive. Dinny Phipps, chairman of the New York Jockey Club, 
has said that testing in most states, including New York, needs to be improved. 
</P>
<P>
The Jockey Club, after a much-criticized survey that it commissioned from the 
University of Pennsylvania in 1988-89, believes that Lasix makes some horses 
run faster and should be banned on those grounds alone. There is also a theory 
that extended use of Lasix can be harmful to a horse's system, and John 
Giovanni, national manager of the Jockeys' Guild, is among those who questions 
whether Lasix has masking properties that interfere with post-race testing for 
stronger illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The California Horse Racing Board has scheduled a two-day Lasix seminar for Los 
Angeles next month. Polls of various segments of the industry have brought 
resounding results in favor of Lasix, but many of the reasons behind the 
responses are self-serving: Veterinarians like Lasix, but of course the more of 
the drug they use, the higher their bills to trainers will be; trainers favor 
Lasix because they feel it alleviates bleeding and extends horses' careers. 
</P>
<P>
A high percentage of New York trainers favor Lasix, too, but they are no match 
for the Jockey Club on this issue. Nick Zito, a Belmont trainer who will run 
Thirty Six Red in the $2-million Breeders' Cup Turf Saturday, is especially 
vocal. 
</P>
<P>
"Not using Lasix will mean the end of New York racing some day," Zito said. 
"Using Lasix is the humane thing to do when a horse is a bleeder. You see 
horses bleeding (from the nostrils) in front of the stands here, and it's 
terrible. 
</P>
<P>
"They have trouble (getting full fields for races) here all the time, and Lasix 
is the big reason. If they let trainers use Lasix, we'd be getting a lot more 
horses from New England than we do. So what do we do? We send our bleeders to 
New Jersey to run. But I don't think it's going to change. Trying to talk to 
the establishment about this is as tough as trying to talk to Gorbachev. I'll 
probably be working at Finger Lakes (a small track near Rochester, N.Y.) after 
I've said this." 
</P>
<P>
Ron McAnally is a California trainer who handles Bayakoa, whose only New York 
appearance was one of the best races of her career, a victory in the Ruffian 
Handicap at Belmont a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Asked the alternative to giving Lasix to Bayakoa for Saturday's Distaff, 
McAnally said: "I have a vet, Dr. William Reed, who's well-regarded in New York 
and I've used him on my horses here for years. I don't know what he's going to 
do, and I don't even ask him. All I know is that he told me not to worry."

<P>
You have to get the whole picture: 
</P>
<P>
This rather large lady lives on an island in the South Pacific that is said to 
be more perfect than paradise. The island is three miles long and five miles 
wide. Her husband, 6-foot-3 and 270 pounds, farms palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
She dresses in billowing cotton pajamas. She eats glorious fresh fruit. She has 
a swimming pool, a garden and a house with, the last time she counted, 30 
rooms. And every day, this lady, Colleen McCullough, surrounds herself with 
acquaintances who have been dead for 2,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
Cicero: "I was reading the letters of Cicero, those marvelous letters of Cicero 
to Atticus," McCullough said. "It is so extraordinary to read them. In one 
letter, Cicero says: 'That woman has finally quit Rome.' " McCullough looked 
jubilant. "He was talking about Cleopatra!" 
</P>
<P>
Julius Caesar: "It is rare in history to be lucky enough to read the words of 
the man who ran the place." Unfortunately, said McCullough, "Caesar never put a 
foot wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Caesar's apparent faultlessness knocked him out of the running for the role of 
hero in McCullough's latest literary endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard to make a hero who does nothing wrong," the author of "The 
Thorn Birds" and four other novels said. 
</P>
<P>
So there on Norfolk Island, not far from where the mutiny on the Bounty took 
place, McCullough crafted new heroes to fill six volumes of fiction about life 
in republican Rome. The debut novel in the series, "The First Man in Rome" 
(William Morrow &amp; Co., $22.95), was published Oct. 1, arrived on the Los 
Angeles Times best-seller list on Oct. 14, and on Sunday moved on to the New 
York Times national best-seller list. 
</P>
<P>
Men and women run around in togas in McCullough's new novel. Their names and 
the places they live and visit are so complicated that McCullough has included 
a 15-page glossary. The research took 13 years -- "10 years of dabbling and 
three years of sitting down and doing nothing else." 
</P>
<P>
It probably would have been easier, and undoubtedly less risky, to write a 
sequel to "The Thorn Birds," McCullough's best-selling contemporary family saga 
of 1977. But, she said, "I had always wanted to do a really fat historical 
novel." 
</P>
<P>
No two of her books are in the same genre, she explained. "I mean, I'm 
hopeless," she pronounced, plopping herself down in a chair in her hotel suite 
here. McCullough has hair that seems to march to its own brush. Her 
black-patent leather shoes have fake leopard-skin trim. Instead of lunch, 
McCullough takes a swig of paregoric, because her stomach is bothering her, and 
lights the first of an endless, unapologetic chain of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
"I read anything," McCullough said. "Everything." 
</P>
<P>
Thwarted in her search for an ashtray, she commandeers a candy bowl. "I can 
still tell you what is written on the toilet paper in the public bathrooms in 
London." On the top of each sheet, said McCullough, are the words "London 
County Council." On the bottom, "Now please wash your hands." 
</P>
<P>
"I like to read in every genre," she said -- and also, to write in them. "So 
anyway, a historical novel I knew I couldn't do until I had enough money not to 
have to work for a living." Fortunately, "I have not since 'Thorn Birds.' " To 
emphasize her point, McCullough threw back her head and laughed. "I ain't 
hurting for a quid," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But to do an historical novel, McCullough knew she needed to find a period that 
had not been done. "I like to be fresh," she said. "And I really came across it 
when I was reading the letters of Cicero and Julius Caesar." 
</P>
<P>
Now McCullough is just the kind of person who would be reading ancient letters 
for recreation. A science major at the University of Sydney, McCullough became 
concerned that she "had never acquired much culture," and signed up for a 
classics course. "We read everything," she said. "It was wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Years later, after the publication of "The Thorn Birds," McCullough decided to 
reread the classics. "I thought I would love to do it again." Unmarried well 
into her 40s, McCullough thought it seemed an appropriate pastime -- "life 
being serious when you are a spinster, and expecting to remain a spinster." 
</P>
<P>
Early on in the years after "The Thorn Birds," McCullough began to feel unsafe. 
She had lived alone since she was 18, but with the fame of "The Thorn Birds," 
she said, "there were threats, and all sorts of weirdos popping out." 
</P>
<P>
A friend suggested Norfolk Island, where the mutineers from the Bounty were 
resettled in 1856. Residency was by permission only, but McCullough quickly 
qualified. 
</P>
<P>
"I was at the time in my early 40s, therefore I wasn't going to be a strain on 
the local hospital," she said. "I was wealthy enough that I wasn't going to be 
a strain on the economy. No. 3, I had no children, so I wasn't going to be a 
strain on the school." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after she arrived on Norfolk Island, "I was lucky enough to meet, for want 
of a better word, one of the natives." 
</P>
<P>
Cedric Newton Ion-Robinson, a.k.a. Ric, "had just sunk all his money into 
palms." Since "all those palm trees that you see in hotel foyers all over the 
world started life as seeds on Norfolk Island," palm farming can be "very, 
very, very" lucrative. 
</P>
<P>
Just then, Robinson's wife "packed up and left him," McCullough said. 
</P>
<P>
"She let him go." 
</P>
<P>
"Really," she added, "that's the trouble with women. They never know when 
they're well off." 
</P>
<P>
But things worked out well for McCullough and Robinson, a descendant of the 
Bounty mutineers. "The next thing you knew, we were married." Another toss of 
the head, and another big laugh. Since Ric is 13 years her junior, "I am Mrs. 
Robinson." 
</P>
<P>
To guarantee the new book's historical accuracy, McCullough employed a 
multilingual research assistant. "She traveled around the world, interviewing 
people on my behalf," locating, for example, "the world's expert on the Roman 
saddle." McCullough herself drew sketches of all of her characters as she wrote 
about them. 
</P>
<P>
Historical fiction can be chancy, McCullough conceded. Academics in particular 
are often quick to attack the credibility of these novels. 
</P>
<P>
But "times are changing," McCullough said. Money is tight and attendance is 
down at many universities, and "history departments are one of the first to 
feel that economic crunch," McCullough said. 
</P>
<P>
"So anything that popularizes ancient history" is seen as a good thing. She 
flashed a big smile. "So, I will popularize ancient history." 
</P>
<P>
Ancient Rome was a jumping place, McCullough said. "It's so interesting and 
juicy and meaty that I would love the whole world to know what went on there." 
</P>
<P>
McCullough's total-immersion approach to writing this series gave her an edge 
on some historical novelists, she said. "The thing that I object to in many 
historical novels is that the characters think in the present." By contrast, 
McCullough's characters "think like Romans." This is possible, she said, 
"because when I was writing, I was a Roman." 
</P>
<P>
Six volumes on ancient Rome seemed no more daunting to McCullough than any 
other work of fiction. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always written novels, always, since I was 5 years old," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But as a Depression child, "You never announced to anyone that you were going 
to write novels." McCullough made science, neurophysiology, her "bread and 
butter." It was during her 10 years as a research associate at the Department 
of Neurology at Yale University that McCullough wrote her first novel, "Tim," 
and completed the manuscript for "The Thorn Birds." 
</P>
<P>
The success of "The Thorn Birds" made science "impossible," McCullough said. 
"To do useful work, I needed to be faceless, anonymous." Suddenly, at dinner 
parties, "I was being introduced as 'our novelist.' " 
</P>
<P>
So McCullough fled to the sanctity of Norfolk Island, where, she said, "This is 
what I do. I just sit down and write books." 
</P>
<P>
There in her tropical Eden, hard-core workaholic McCullough writes at least 
eight to 10 hours each day. 
</P>
<P>
Having written her love story ("Tim," 1974); her family saga ("The Thorn 
Birds," 1977); her whodunit ("An Indecent Obsession," 1981); her novella ("The 
Ladies of Missalonghi," 1987), and her future tale ("A Creed for the Third 
Millennium," 1985). McCullough can now add history to her dance of the genres. 
She is two-thirds finished with the second in the Roman series, and promises 
that "it's even better than the first." 
</P>
<P>
And so, next? 
</P>
<P>
"Next I think I will do something contemporary, nasty, bitter and steamy," 
McCullough said. She thought for a moment and decided she liked that idea. 
"Yes, something steamy, after the Romans."

NET LOSS? During Charles Keating's 33-day stay in Los Angeles County Jail, he 
lost 20% of his net worth. . . . Along with the shirt off his back and the rest 
of the clothes he came in with -- which the Sheriff's Department misplaced -- 
the former head of Irvine's Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan had $25 in his wallet 
when he arrived -- but only $20 when he left. . . . No word from Keating on 
where the money went. Dan Weikel and Kris Lindgren

POLICE FIND LITTLE THINGS MEAN A LOT TO S.E. ASIANS; 
</P>
<P>
CULTURAL RIFT: OFFICERS IN ORANGE COUNTY'S LITTLE SAIGON MUST LEARN NEW SYSTEM 
OF VALUES TO BE EFFECTIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
On the streets of Orange County's Little Saigon, it's the little things that 
can close the rift between an American police officer trying to get to the 
bottom of a crime and a Vietnamese-American caught between two cultures. 
</P>
<P>
It is disrespectful to touch a Vietnamese man on the head, summon him with an 
index finger or show him the bottom of one's shoe while sitting. So is shaking 
hands with a Vietnamese woman unless she is Americanized. If she is not, a 
simple bow will do. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of little things to be aware of with newcomers," said Santa 
Ana Police Officer Di Au, a Vietnam War refugee. "In Vietnam, for example, it's 
customary when stopped by police to get out of your car and walk to the 
officer. Here, you don't do that. It can cause tensions if police don't know 
what to expect." 
</P>
<P>
Today, peace officers assigned to Southeast Asian communities in Orange County 
and other parts of the nation receive cultural training to overcome a 
traditional mistrust of law enforcement that impedes efforts to protect 
Southeast Asian communities. 
</P>
<P>
"As police officers, you have to learn to work in Asian communities in a 
different way," said San Francisco Police Sgt. Tom Perdue, of the city's Asian 
gang detail. "You subtly approach people and learn to function from their 
perspective. Our concepts of right and wrong are the same, but we are 180 
degrees apart in the way we act." 
</P>
<P>
Influenced by Buddhism, Taoism and Confucian thought, say Southeast Asian 
historians, Southeast Asians dislike confrontation, and often try to take an 
indirect approach to problems on their own. If a crime befalls them, they tend 
to blame themselves for letting it happen. 
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asians also are less likely than other Americans to talk about their 
feelings in public or with someone they do not know, such as a police officer 
who tries to question them about an incident. 
</P>
<P>
"Saving face," the act of avoiding shameful or embarrassing situations, comes 
into play strongly when a crime has occurred. Police say Southeast Asians are 
especially reluctant to report or talk about drug use, gang involvement, child 
abuse, rape and other sexual assaults because of the risk of embarrassment to 
their families. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't volunteer things. They only answer your questions, so you have to 
dig a lot more to get any information," said Thien N. Cao, a Vietnamese refugee 
who is now a police liaison officer in Garden Grove's Vietnamese community. 
</P>
<P>
Further distancing police from the Southeast Asian community are customs that 
are not accepted or legal in the United States, a situation that can lead to 
misunderstandings with law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
For example, "nickeling," a Vietnamese home remedy in which a coin is rubbed 
hard on the side of a sick child's neck, could be misinterpreted as child abuse 
by educators or social workers because it often leaves bruises. 
</P>
<P>
Corporal punishment by parents is accepted as well, and many Southeast Asians 
believe domestic violence should be solved within the family and without the 
help of police or social service agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The hesitancy to get involved, specifically for the Vietnamese and Cambodians, 
is exacerbated by their experience with law enforcement in their home 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Officers were often low paid, uneducated and corrupt. They often employed 
methods such as coerced confessions, beatings and immediate jailings. After the 
fall of Saigon in 1975, police were used by the communists to enforce the 
regime and to jail political dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
"You need to sit back and ask, 'Where do these people come from?' You will see 
they were brought up in an era of violence and not knowing who to trust, not 
even the police," Perdue said. 
</P>
<P>
Police and sheriff's departments have tried to close the culture gap with a 
variety of training techniques ranging from 45-minute videotapes to 
full-fledged classes at police academies. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Vietnamese Community of Orange County Inc., a social service 
agency that provides counseling and crime-prevention information, offers 
quarterly seminars to police, probation officers and schoolteachers to teach 
them how to cope with cultural differences. 
</P>
<P>
"Law enforcement officials are becoming more effective in communications," said 
Nhu-hao Duong, a refugee coordinator for the Orange County Social Services 
Agency. "They are now careful about body language, their voices and hand 
gestures." 
</P>
<P>
Duong said officers often misinterpret innocuous behavior, such as lack of eye 
contact, as indications of deceit. Vietnamese, she said, look at the ground to 
show respect and put their hands on their belts, one hand covering the other. 
</P>
<P>
"Police feel this can be shifty. They ask more questions and things can get 
worse," Duong said. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Officer Au said he has seen police get upset with Vietnamese who 
were smiling when detained. The smile also can be a sign of respect. " 'What, 
do you think it's funny?' " Au quoted officers as saying. 
</P>
<P>
At the Orange County Sheriff's Academy, Westminster Detective Marcus Frank, who 
specializes in Southeast Asian crime, teaches an eight-hour course. Videotapes 
also have been produced by the Anaheim Police Department and the Orange County 
Human Relations Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Officers learn that they should, when practical, get permission from the head 
of the household before talking to anyone else in the family. Out of respect, 
men should be addressed as ong and women as ba. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't see there is a cultural difference, you won't get anywhere," said 
Garden Grove Sgt. Frank Hauptmann, who is assigned to the Asian detail. "Just 
the way you summon people can get you in trouble. Don't use your finger. That 
is how a dog is summoned in Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
Westminster Officer Robert Trotter, who is assigned to the Little Saigon 
substation, said Vietnamese are more sensitive than others to being embarrassed 
in front of their friends. So he tries to separate everyone at a crime scene 
and question witnesses privately as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Police officers in other communities have learned similar lessons over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Al Lotz, a Vietnam War veteran who specializes in Southeast Asian crime 
in Houston and teaches the culture to his fellow officers, said working in 
Houston's Southeast Asian community demands patience and empathy. 
</P>
<P>
"I have developed compassion for them," Lotz said. "They are being ripped off 
by their own people, and they went through hell to get to this country, and all 
they want to do is live in freedom. In my class, I try to explain how lost they 
are and what it is like living between two cultures." 
</P>
<P>
Because Southeast Asians like to know whom they are dealing with, police soon 
find out that they have to spend a great deal of time getting to know victims 
and witnesses on a personal level before they will cooperate. On a social 
level, they must attend merchant association meetings and cultural events. 
</P>
<P>
Many times, officers say, they have to serve subpoenas in person and then drive 
the witnesses to court to assure that they show up. Police also have to 
re-interview witnesses and victims repeatedly before they begin to get usable 
information. 
</P>
<P>
On their rounds, officers try to explain that being a crime victim, even of 
rape or sexual abuse, is not something to be so ashamed of that nothing should 
done about it. 
</P>
<P>
A few departments have created permanent community liaisons, usually a 
Vietnamese, who stays in constant contact with the city's Southeast Asian 
merchants and civic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"If they don't know you, they won't talk to you," Garden Grove Police Chief 
John Robertson said. "We try to make regular rounds, but it takes years and 
years to develop relationships. You have got to be in it for the long run." 
</P>
<P>
Cao, who fled Vietnam in 1975, has been the Garden Grove Police Department's 
emissary of good will since 1981. Every week he goes door to door, covering 
miles of pavement at scores of strip malls that are home to the county's 
Vietnamese retailers. 
</P>
<P>
His weapons are crime-prevention pamphlets in English and Vietnamese. It is a 
treadmill of hair salons, groceries, bakeries, restaurants, jewelers, 
clothiers, billiard parlors and drug stores. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like a sales job, only I am selling security," Cao said. "At the 
beginning, it was really humiliating. They didn't even want us in the store. 
They'd look away or ignore us or ease us out the door." 
</P>
<P>
Cao said he did not wear his white and blue uniform for a while to make 
merchants more comfortable when he dropped by to see them. Today, he leaves his 
uniform on, testimony to some of the department's progress. 
</P>
<P>
More Southeast Asians are reporting crime, but there are still difficulties 
getting them to testify in court and cooperate with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson said he repeatedly gets critical mail from citizens complaining that 
the Southeast Asian community is getting special attention. He recently 
received a batch of letters after his department sent out a bilingual 
crime-prevention brochure in the city water bills. 
</P>
<P>
"I call this bigotry," Robertson said. "If people could only understand that 
everything is reversed for them -- culture, food, speech, clothes. They don't 
know what to expect. They are fearful and wonder why it is held against them 
for being here."

STREET SMART: IF NEED FAILS TO MOTIVATE CAR-POOLING, GREED JUST MIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
As a behavioral psychologist and frequent freeway flier, I have developed an 
idea designed to increase the motivation of Californians to use the car-pool 
lane: the Diamond-Lane Lottery. 
</P>
<P>
In view of the success of the state lottery, it is an idea whose time has come. 
The proposal is simply that drivers could buy a sticker (either monthly or 
yearly) that would make them eligible to be Diamond-Lane Lottery winners while 
driving in the car-pool lane. 
</P>
<P>
Some type of detection or selection system could be developed to select daily 
winners on various California freeways -- particularly at peak traffic hours. 
Winners would receive notification of prizes (cash, gasoline or coupons) or 
eligibility for prizes. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal rests on the assumption that at least some additional proportion 
of California drivers will put aside the conveniences of driving alone in order 
to "win big" just by commuting back and forth to work. Hopefully, there would 
be additional incentive to use the often under-utilized diamond lane. 
</P>
<P>
Dean D.E. Alexander, Diamond Bar 
</P>
<P>
Car-pool lane meets Big Spin? Once I stopped chuckling, I began to think maybe 
this wasn't such a bad idea. Hey, stranger things have happened. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever thought Orange County would put in toll roads? Lo and behold, the 
county will probably soon be the toll-road capital of the universe, with five 
(count 'em: five) toll roads on the drawing boards. The Diamond-Lane Lottery 
could work in much the same way. But instead of you paying to use the freeway, 
the freeway would be paying you. 
</P>
<P>
I took the idea to the California Department of Transportation in Orange 
County. Once officials there stopped laughing, they suggested that the idea 
could best be addressed by the state Legislature. It's a policy thing that 
requires action by state lawmakers, they said. 
</P>
<P>
There could be legal hitches, of course. Lawyers have a funny way of taking the 
fun out of life. But the Legislature could probably figure some tricky way 
around any problems. 
</P>
<P>
So there it is. If you like the idea, call your duly elected state 
representative. Demand the Diamond-Lane Lottery. Goodness knows, if it could 
reduce freeway congestion, it certainly would be welcome.

ANAHEIM POLICE HAVE TAKEN A PERSONAL, HIGH-PROFILE APPROACH TO CUTTING CRIME IN 
10 AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

ANAHEIM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first time officers Tim Wylie and Karen Schroepfer saw an outdoor card game 
on Sabina Street, they thought it was a harmless way for some laborers to relax 
after work. 
</P>
<P>
But after a few weeks of watching the area up close as part of the Anaheim 
Police Department's new Community Action Policing team, the two officers soon 
realized that some card parties actually were ploys to conceal drug 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
"The card games and the drinking are fronts," Schroepfer said recently as she 
broke up one such congregation, dispersing the crowd and emptying beer bottles. 
"This is where the contacts are made. A guy walks up to the table like he's 
part of the game and a (drug) deal is made." 
</P>
<P>
Whether it's breaking up clandestine narcotics operations or knocking on 
residents' doors to ask them about the problems in their neighborhoods, Anaheim 
police are trying a personal and concentrated approach of policing the city's 
10 worst crime areas. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it," said Leopoldo Gonzalez, a nine-year resident of Sabina Street. "We 
really need their help." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez watched from his yard as Wylie and Schroepfer detained a convicted 
drug user who they suspected was trying to buy drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad the police are making an effort to come around here more," said the 
37-year-old father of two. "There's a lot of drinking, drugs, and fighting 
around here. It's very unsafe." 
</P>
<P>
For years, similar programs have been used by other departments in the county 
with varying degrees of success. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very vogue form of policing right now," said James Lasley, an assistant 
professor of criminal justice at Cal State Fullerton who helped the Los Angeles 
Police Department form a community policing program called Operation 
Cul-de-sac. "It's the wave of the future . . . it can be very effective." 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim's $360,000, two-year program is staffed by four officers, a sergeant 
and a lieutenant. It is modeled after a successful pilot program in the 
Jeffrey-Lynne area earlier this year which incorporated several city 
departments, including code enforcement, community services and other sections 
within the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The unit uses foot, bike and vehicle patrols to comb through certain parts of 
the city to make their presence known to residents as well as miscreants. 
</P>
<P>
After breaking up the card game, Wylie and Schroepfer continued to walk around 
the predominantly Latino neighborhood, greeting residents and asking them if 
anybody was out to sell drogas. 
</P>
<P>
Schroepfer, who was followed around by several barefoot children as she walked 
toward an alley on Sabina Street, found a discarded hypodermic needle lying on 
the ground near some trash cans. 
</P>
<P>
"This is why parents around here are afraid to let their children out," she 
said as she picked up the needle and threw it away. 
</P>
<P>
A short distance away, she stopped and questioned a suspected drunk who had 
just urinated in an alley in a spot where it appeared others had done the same. 
Using a neighborhood teen-ager to translate in Spanish, she told the man to go 
home or face being arrested. 
</P>
<P>
He left. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the night, the officers walked and drove through Sabina, Rose and 
Bush streets, stopping suspected gang members, drug dealers and users and beer 
drinkers. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of going from one call to another across the city like regular patrol 
officers, we're afforded the opportunity to really take the time and talk with 
the people," Wylie said. "It goes a long way toward getting them to trust us." 
</P>
<P>
Developing a good relationship with the business owners, community groups and 
residents will determine the success of the program, according to Lt. Ray Welch 
and Sgt. Mike Hannah, the two men who run the month-old unit. 
</P>
<P>
Once residents begin to trust the officers, they will be more likely to call 
the police when problems develop, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to go from crisis management to a long-range proactive service," Welch 
said. "We need to educate them on the system so they can use us to help them 
better." 
</P>
<P>
The trust the officers are seeking may be tough to develop because of cultural 
and language barriers, Welch and Hannah admit. All four officers in the unit 
have some working knowledge of Spanish, but only one is fluent. 
</P>
<P>
One recent weekend night, Wylie and Schroepfer went door to door with the other 
two officers in the unit, Hank Fantes and Fred Pittington, and did some good 
old-fashioned handshaking with residents and listened to their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the families told us they don't let their children go outside to play, 
or want their wives to go by the stores themselves" because of drug dealers and 
gang members loitering in the neighborhood, Pittington said. 
</P>
<P>
After talking with the residents, Pittington said he felt "a certain 
indignation and outrage" at their plight that he didn't get while "working 
regular patrol." 
</P>
<P>
"You simply don't have that same reaction, the same feelings, because you can't 
allow yourself the time to do that," he said. "I think we're finally talking to 
people and finding some way to get a link across between the Police Department 
and the citizens that just wasn't here before." 
</P>
<P>
In the Jeffrey-Lynne pilot program, crime dropped significantly as police made 
230 arrests for such crimes as drug possession, drunkenness and urinating in 
public. The police are hoping to see the same results in the target areas. 
</P>
<P>
Crime in Jeffrey-Lynne has increased somewhat since the program was stopped, 
but not to the level it was before the community policing began, police 
officials said. No comparative statistics were available. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Police Chief Joseph T. Molloy said the program should work, but results 
won't occur overnight. "I think we can have an impact in all (10) of the 
(target) areas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of community policing is an old idea that "got lost somewhere" when 
officers became more mobilized and more demands were made on their time, Molloy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We kind of lost touch," he said. "We're revisiting these programs . . . we 
want to show the people they can take control of their neighborhoods."

FAREWELL SALUTE PLANNED FOR PIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The city will hold a nostalgic "farewell salute to the old pier" Thursday. City 
officials said the razing of the pier will be in full swing by Thursday, and 
the ceremonies on that date will mark the death of the old structure. 
</P>
<P>
The pier has been closed since July, 1988 because of age and storm damage. 
</P>
<P>
The farewell ceremonies will feature live music, small pieces of the pier given 
away as souvenirs and an update on fund raising for the replacement pier. 
</P>
<P>
The end of the new pier will be 12 feet higher than that of the old pier, 
enabling it to better withstand winter storms. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Thomas J. Mays said everybody is invited to the farewell salute. He noted 
that the pier attracted about 1 million visitors a year from all over the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up in this city, and I've surfed around that pier many, many times, and 
it has many memories for me," Mays said. "I think everyone who lives in this 
city is going to have some emotional moments about seeing the old pier come 
down." 
</P>
<P>
The new pier, which is estimated to cost $11.7 million, is scheduled to be 
completed by spring, 1992. The city still lacks about $2.8 million, and a 
private fund-raising drive is under way. 
</P>
<P>
The farewell will begin at 11:30 a.m. Thursday at the entrance of the pier, 
Main Street at Pacific Coast Highway. BILL BILLITER

SAVE OUR PARKS WARNS OF IMPOSTORS

<P>
An unidentified group is operating a phone bank and fraudulently calling itself 
"Save Our Parks," according to Debbie Cook, spokeswoman for the actual Save Our 
Parks citizens' organization. 
</P>
<P>
The real Save Our Parks was formed last year and led the effort to place an 
initiative on the Nov. 6 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
This initiative, called Measure C, would prohibit the city from selling or 
leasing park or beach land without a citywide vote. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council majority placed an alternative on the ballot, Measure D, which 
would also prohibit sale of park and beach land but would still allow lease of 
those lands. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said the phone bank operation in Huntington Beach has been telling 
residents that Save Our Parks favors Measure D, which the group opposes. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who are using this phone bank are trying to use our good name to 
confuse the voters," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Duchene, spokesman for the Huntington Beach Committee for Parks and Youth 
Sports/Yes on D, said Sunday that he knows nothing about the phone bank calls. 
</P>
<P>
"The only calls we're making are to people as a follow-up to our efforts to 
distribute absentee ballots," Duchene said. "I don't know what the origin of 
these other calls are, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was someone from Save 
Our Parks just trying to make an issue." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Grace Winchell, who is seeking reelection Nov. 6 and who is a 
supporter of Save Our Parks and Measure C, said she had received one of the 
phone bank calls. Winchell said the message said those interested in saving the 
parks should vote for council candidates Earle Robitaille, Jack Kelly and Ed 
Mountford. 
</P>
<P>
Winchell noted that the real Save Our Parks actually has endorsed her and 
council candidates Linda Moulton-Patterson and Mark Porter. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO HOSTS U.N. DAY FESTIVITIES

<P>
During a celebration of the United Nations' 45th anniversary, Mission Viejo 
Mayor Christian W. Keena said Sunday that protection of the environment is a 
matter of worldwide, and thus U.N., concern. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the United Nations is really in focus now, especially with the Persian 
Gulf situation," Keena said. "The Persian Gulf situation has shown that nations 
can come together in matters of common concern, and I think a matter of common 
concern in the world now is the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"The water and the air we depend on know no boundaries. And we're all trustees 
of this planet. We all have the same duties. Be it the United States, be it 
Brazil, be it Japan -- we all have the same duties to preserve this planet, not 
only for the generation that is here, but for future generations." 
</P>
<P>
Keena spoke at ceremonies at Mount of Olives Lutheran Church in Mission Viejo. 
United Nations Day celebrations also were held Sunday in Laguna Beach and 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
U.N. Day in Mission Viejo focused on the topic "Saving the Environment." During 
a press conference, Keena and Jerry Yudelson, a director of the statewide Clean 
Air Coalition, predicted that protecting the world from environmental ruin will 
become an increasing concern of the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Yudelson, of Garden Grove, also said he would be 
urging the audience to support Proposition 128, the so-called "Big Green" 
environmental initiative on the Nov. 6 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pushing very strongly for this measure to pass because it addresses so 
many of the global environmental issues, particularly the greenhouse effect and 
preserving the oceans," Yudelson said. "It's always about a generation between 
the time a problem is first identified and the time that effective action takes 
place." 
</P>
<P>
Students from Mission Viejo High School presented a mock U.N. session during 
Sunday's program. The discussion topic was environmental concern, and the 
students represented various countries, giving speeches about those nations' 
points of view. 
</P>

COUNCIL CONSIDERS SUPPLEMENTAL PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Brea is exploring whether to increase the salary and benefits offered to city 
employees who, as military reservists, are called to duty. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, cities must pay such employees full salary for the first 30 
days of leave for military duty and offer re-employment, vacation, sick leave 
and holiday privileges for 180 days. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the council directed the city's finance committee to look into 
increasing the length of time a city employee would remain salaried and 
maintaining certain benefits not offered to active-duty reservists. 
</P>
<P>
Brea proposed making up the difference between an employee's base salary and 
the military salary, specialty assignment pay and housing subsidies. The 
supplemental pay would take effect after the federally mandated 30 days of full 
salary expires and would continue for the duration of the employee's active 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
The city also proposed continuing medical and dental benefits for employees and 
their families, and employees would continue to accrue retirement benefits 
during the active-duty period. 
</P>
<P>
According to Scott Malkemus, personnel director, Brea has just one employee, a 
maintenance services worker, who is a reservist. 
</P>
<P>
"But that could change," Malkemus said. "This might encourage some employees to 
join the reserves." 
</P>
<P>
Council members were generally supportive of the plan, despite the increased 
cost to the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Brea can say we stood up and were counted," said Councilman Ron Isles. 
</P>
<P>
The matter is expected to go before the council for approval at its Nov. 6 
meeting, Malkemus said. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ART AFFORDS INSIGHT INTO ALZHEIMER'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gertrude Frazier had never picked up a paintbrush before this year. Now, at 85, 
her watercolor "Through These Fields to School" will tour the county as part of 
"Memories in the Making," a show of artworks by patients with Alzheimer's 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's fantastic," said Phyllis Garrett, Frazier's daughter. "This has 
just thrilled her to death. She still understands that something special is 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
The second annual "Memories" show, which opened at the Guggenheim Gallery of 
Chapman College last week, features works by 26 Alzheimer's patients from three 
Orange County adult care centers. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning later this month and continuing through Dec. 11, the 33 paintings and 
pastel and pencil drawings will tour 16 Home Savings of America branches 
throughout the county. The show was curated by the Alzheimer's Assn. of Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Alzheimer's, an incurable, degenerative disease that attacks the brain, 
afflicts about 40,000 people in Orange County and 4 million nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Selly Jenny, the show's organizer, said painting gives the patients a hard-won 
sense of accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
"For years and years, they may have been struggling with inner humiliation and 
embarrassment because they carry this consciousness that they are losing it," 
Jenny said. "But the art world is a totally non-threatening world. You can't 
make a mistake when you're doing a picture." 
</P>
<P>
The show is also a public information tool, Jenny said, and provides a rare 
positive profile of Alzheimer's patients. 
</P>
<P>
The artworks, figurative and impressionistic, childlike and sophisticated, were 
created without assistance, Jenny said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Carl Cotman, director of the UCI Brain Aging and Alzheimer's Center, 
believes that the works have the "signature" of Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask a person with a migraine headache to do a painting, it looks like a 
migraine headache," Cotman explained. "Alzheimer's paintings are humanistic, 
colorful and refreshing. They're telling you that's what's in there . . . a 
certain youthful vigor and enthusiasm." 
</P>
<P>
The art may offer a key to understanding a patient's capacity for memory and 
comprehension, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"To be able to say what's there and what's not will tell us a lot about what 
people are, really," Cotman said. 
</P>
<P>
The art may also provide a "conceptual breakthrough" in the way the public and 
medical experts look at Alzheimer's patients in the future, he said, adding 
that he plans to study the condition of several artists in the show. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got a glimmer that something is doable, positive and uplifting," Cotman 
said, "and that's what we need to work with." 
</P>
<P>

MAN, 36, DIES OF ALCOHOL POISONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 36-year-old Los Angeles County man died of apparent alcohol poisoning after 
attending a weekend bachelor's party near Balboa Pier, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Alamo of Cudahy was found dead Sunday morning by several people who had 
rented the beach house where the party was held, Police Lt. Mike Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Alamo was a casual acquaintance of one of the guests, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Police say the party-goers had rented the four-room bungalow in the 500 block 
of East Ocean Front for the weekend. The guests had brought several cases of 
beer and ouzo and began drinking Saturday afternoon, Jackson said. Ouzo is a 
potent Greek liqueur that is 45 proof alcohol. Beer, by comparison, is 4.5 
proof. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a drinking party that lasted quite a while," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Alamo apparently fell asleep at about 1:30 a.m. Sunday while the party 
continued for another hour and a half. When the rest of the guests tried to 
wake Alamo later in the morning, they found him dead, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary cause of death is acute alcohol poisoning, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert DiLorenzo, a physician at UCI Medical Center emergency room, said 
alcohol poisoning is rare. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens with these kinds of deaths is that the alcohol affects either the 
person's heart or brain," DiLorenzo said. "But it is not common at all." It 
tends to happen to people who have a low tolerance for alcohol, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors say the party-goers had rented the house, which is off the Balboa 
boardwalk, just for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"They were partying pretty good," said Jim Vaughan, who lives two doors away. 
"They were drinking beer in the yard." 
</P>
<P>
A woman, who lives next door to the bungalow, said up to 25 people had attended 
the party.

ANNIVERSARY: ALUMNI OF EL TORO GRAMMAR SCHOOL, AT A RE-ENACTMENT OF THE 
SCHOOL'S DEDICATION IN 1890, REMEMBER THE OLD DAYS.

<P>
Alumni, gathering to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the original El Toro 
Grammar School, the oldest public school in Orange County, recalled a time when 
things were not so gentle. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember when the teacher swatted a boy over a piano bench, it upset me so 
bad, I can't even tell you," recalled Ida Ashbeck, 75, who graduated in 1929. 
</P>
<P>
Another student, 1912 graduate George Osterman, also remembered the discipline 
dished out by a series of young schoolmarms -- but said it was nothing compared 
to how strict parents were. 
</P>
<P>
"If you got into trouble at school, chances were you would be in a lot more 
trouble when you got home," said Osterman, who at 90 is the school's oldest 
living graduate. 
</P>
<P>
Alumni and relatives of the oldest families in the Saddleback Valley gathered 
Sunday for the schoolhouse anniversary and a re-enactment of the school's 
dedication. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1890, the one-room schoolhouse was used by the original Saddleback 
Valley School District until 1914, when overcrowding forced district officials 
to build a two-room brick school about a mile away. The schoolhouse was turned 
into a Catholic church and then left to deteriorate in the 1970s. But by the 
early 1980s, the Friends of Heritage Hill volunteer group refurbished the house 
and moved it to the Heritage Hill Historical Park, where it now sits next to 
several other historic monuments. 
</P>
<P>
The grammar school has been restored to look exactly as it did in the early 
1900s, but some graduates recalled features missing from the Heritage Hill 
exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a bottle of water in the middle, it was brought in, like today's 
bottled water, because you couldn't drink the water in El Toro back then," said 
Cedric Serrano, who attended the school in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
And according to Osterman, the school also had its own stable, so students who 
rode donkeys and horses would have a place for their animals while they sat in 
school for seven hours. 
</P>
<P>
Other graduates remembered how enrollment at the school would shrink during 
harvest season. Graduating classes became progressively smaller as boys left to 
work on family farms or girls departed to get married. 
</P>
<P>
"One year we only had two students in our graduating class," said George 
Osterman Jr., 70. "One (student) moved away and the other one got married so 
they canceled graduation." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers also would quit each year, discouraged by the district's strict rules 
that prohibited female teachers from smoking, drinking, marrying or "joining 
any feminist movement, such as the Suffragettes," according to a copy of the 
rules posted in the schoolhouse.

SUSPECT RESCUED FROM FREEWAY LEDGE

<TEXT>
<P>
A 21-year-old man fleeing police jumped over a freeway guardrail early Sunday 
morning and then clung to a ledge above a 100-foot drop while officers pulled 
him to safety. 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol and Santa Ana police officers were pursuing a suspect 
in a stolen car southbound on the Costa Mesa Freeway about 2:30 a.m. At the 
point where the freeway merges with the southbound San Diego Freeway, the car 
crashed into a guardrail and the driver, Erik Aquino of Santa Ana, jumped over 
it, Police Sgt. Bob Ensley said. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino apparently did not realize that the rail was 100 feet above ground, 
Ensley said. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino somehow managed to grab onto a four-inch concrete ledge about three feet 
down. Santa Ana Police Sgt. Dan Beaumarchais hung over the railing, his legs 
held by CHP officers Al Montoya and Barry Batsford, and pulled Aquino back up. 
</P>
<P>
Ensley said Aquino clung to the ledge for several minutes before officers were 
able to rescue him. He was uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
"He was quite lucky to get out of that alive," Ensley said. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino was arrested on suspicion of possession of a stolen vehicle. His three 
passengers were detained for questioning.

So far, the campaign contributions received by City Council candidates have 
matched the size of this bedroom community, with the largest single donation so 
far reaching only $300, campaign documents show. 
</P>
<P>
Loans from their own bank accounts have been the main source of revenue for the 
11 candidates vying for three seats in the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Brian J. Rice, who topped the fund-raising list with $5,041, also 
loaned his campaign the most money -- $4,000, according to the documents. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Anderson, a former president of the city Chamber of Commerce, received the 
most contributions, pulling in $3,896. About $3,297 of that total was in 
contributions of less than $100. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson has spent $2,912, the most of any of the candidates. He was followed 
closely by incumbent Councilman Thomas Lorch, who spent $2,786, and Planning 
Commissioner George Key, whose expenses totaled $2,671. 
</P>
<P>
Lorch also received the largest single contribution -- $300 from W.J. Morison, 
a county official. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates Carol Hamilton, Scott Walker and Charles Seward filed short forms 
indicating that they will not be raising or spending over $1,000 in their 
campaigns.

Q&amp;A: ROGER PALLEY; 
</P>
<P>
A TASTE FOR 'PLAIN VANILLA'; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTMENT MANAGER PREFERS THE SAFE, STEADY APPROACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John O'Dell, staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The economy is slumping, the stock market is anemic, real estate is losing 
value and the days of high-yield bank and savings and loan deposits are gone. 
So what's left on the investment front? 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Palley thinks there still are opportunities out there. It is not the 
best of times, says the founding partner of Palley-Needleman Asset Management, 
but neither is it the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach investment firm, one of a handful of independent money 
managers in the county, was founded in 1985, just after the last recession, and 
since has weathered record ups and downs on Wall Street and other investment 
channels. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-described "plain vanilla" investment manager, Palley-Needleman has 
grown in just five years into a significant regional presence, handling a 
portfolio of $693 million for hundreds of individual, corporate and 
institutional clients, including the Orange County Performing Arts Center, Girl 
Scouts of Orange County, Chrysler Corp. and the Louisiana Teachers Retirement 
System. 
</P>
<P>
 Palley, 48, started the firm after 23 years as an investment manager and 
analyst with companies like Title Insurance and Trust and Oppenheimer &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
 A transplanted New Yorker, he picked Orange County for his headquarters 
because "people here don't understand what we do. Orange County has only about 
five bona fide, good quality firms that do what we do. But if you go to L.A., 
there are 25 or 30, and if you go to New York, there are hundreds. So what a 
golden opportunity to be in this business in a county with all of this money." 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview with staff writer John O'Dell, Palley shared his 
thoughts on investing, the economy and Orange County's reputation as a hot spot 
of investment fraud. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. An investment counselor operates within a certain base philosophy. What's 
yours? 
</P>
<P>
A. To manage assets in a conservative fashion, to have our clients stay ahead 
of inflation and taxes, and to do it with quality securities. The majority of 
our clients already have their money, so they're not asking us to make them 
rich. They just want to preserve what they have. We aim for a reasonable rate 
of return on investments. We don't buy stock in new companies or in volatile 
technology companies, we don't trade in commodities or on margin or do option 
trading or currency hedging. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You said that people don't understand what you do. Here's your chance to 
explain. 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, first of all, we are independent investment advisers, we're not 
brokers. We do not make any money on transactions. We charge a fee just like an 
attorney or an accountant. We bill quarterly. There's no contract and we don't 
make any money when we buy and sell something for you. Our fee is a function of 
the value of your portfolio. We want to see the value go up because then our 
fee will become a little bit greater. 
</P>
<P>
Q. And what does a firm like yours charge? 
</P>
<P>
A. It's only 1% a year. So if you had a million dollar account, you'd pay us 
$10,000 a year, or $2,500 a quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The economy is lousy these days, but good or bad, where are you putting 
clients' money? 
</P>
<P>
A. There are only three broad classes of assets when you invest the way we do: 
cash equivalents, fixed income and equities. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How about some plain vanilla definitions. 
</P>
<P>
A. Cash equivalents would be money market funds, usually investments in 
government securities maturing in one year or less, or in direct purchase of 
treasury bills that mature in a year or less. For clients with taxable 
accounts, however, we buy short-term California tax-exempt funds so the clients 
don't pay any tax on that part of their portfolio earnings. Then in the 
fixed-income area, we buy bonds. They can either be municipal bonds or federal 
government bonds, which would also include agency bonds and government-backed 
mortgage bonds. On the equity side of the portfolio, we're very well 
diversified by industries. Our tendency is to invest in industries that are 
somewhat more stable than the average, so historically our largest investments 
have been in food, tobacco, beverages, utilities, things of that nature that 
are less cyclical. We have very small exposure to technology. We don't buy 
small companies and we don't buy emerging growth companies. Our tendency is to 
buy stocks that have good dividends, excellent balance sheets and good 
long-term records. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You mentioned tobacco companies as an investment. Do you invest with any 
sort of political or social ethic? 
</P>
<P>
A. As a firm, our only philosophy is that we are capitalists first. No one in 
our office smokes and we don't have an ashtray here. But we've made the 
decision that if tobacco companies are indeed good investments -- and we think 
they are -- we will invest in them. As far as being socially responsible goes, 
we let the client make that decision. We have some clients who are socially 
responsible and provide us with a list of restrictions that we abide by. For 
some clients, we cannot invest in liquor companies, nuclear utilities, defense 
companies, tobacco or firms dealing in South Africa. But that probably 
comprises less than 10% of our client base. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Back to the economy. Where is it going? 
</P>
<P>
A. The economy for the last several months has been in a slow-growth mode. Some 
industries are doing OK, some are doing poorly. When you look at the aggregate 
national account numbers, it's about flat. It's likely that later this year and 
into next year, we'll start seeing some negative readings, especially on 
industrial production. Unemployment is likely to rise somewhat and inflation 
will probably go higher for a while but is likely to flatten out if not go down 
next year. So, our outlook right now is for a slow economy. 
</P>
<P>
Q. And how do you invest clients' money in a slow economy? 
</P>
<P>
A. We still think that a good mix of cash, bonds and stock is the best way to 
go for the individual investor who needs a reasonable rate of return above 
inflation and taxes. The exact mix will depend on the particular client. In the 
cash area, we have money in government money market funds for safety, liquidity 
and income. In the bond area, we have U.S. government bonds or good quality 
municipal bonds, with short-term maturity, to take some of the risk out of 
inflation. If inflation were to rise a lot, the bonds would be protected on 
price. In stock, we are in quality income-type stocks. In the technology area 
we've been very light, although we still think larger companies like IBM will 
do well and have good growth rates. The last segment is foreign stocks, where 
we have some investments. They are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, 
however, in the form of an ADR, or American Depository Receipt. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The benefit of foreign stocks? 
</P>
<P>
A. Foreign stocks are a play on currency if the dollar continues weak, and a 
play on the diversification taking place in different countries and businesses 
because of what's going to happen in Europe with economic unification in 1992. 
And also the changes in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You say the mix varies, but what would be typical in a climate like we are 
in now? 
</P>
<P>
A. In most cases, it's a balanced portfolio. We might have 50% to 55% in stock, 
30 to 35% in intermediate government bonds and the balance in money market 
funds. If interest rates were to drop significantly, and if we felt the economy 
was going to improve, then somewhere down the line we would increase our equity 
exposure by 10% or 15% to take advantage of a rising economic environment, good 
corporate profits, rising dividends and probably a rising market. Conversely, 
when things go the other way, we're going to reduce our equities, but never to 
the point where we're totally out. We don't feel we're that smart. More 
important than how much you have in stocks is the kinds of stocks that you own. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The Orange County economy has tended to be affected less than other regions 
by national recessions. Has there been any change in the economy here that 
could change that? 
</P>
<P>
A. No. I don't think so. If anything, the economy here has probably tended to 
be more diversified in the last five years. We continue to have more upscale 
people moving to this area. So we continue to have fairly good income levels. 
The only area that would concern me, and I think the jury's still out, is the 
number of people involved directly or indirectly in residential construction, 
mortgage-related and real estate development businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Q. That's a lot of people in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
A. And there are many people I've talked to who are no longer employed by those 
companies. There have been some very quiet layoffs. All the way from home 
builders to major commercial developers to interior design firms. Many have 
laid off anywhere from 10 to 20% of their staff because of the slowdown. And 
it's not that people aren't buying because interest rates are high. It's 
because home prices got too high and people couldn't afford it. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How long do you see that lasting? 
</P>
<P>
A. One could make the case that housing, for the next five years, may not be a 
very good investment. In fact, some people have suggested that you're better 
off renting now, letting the landlord worry about all the expenses like 
insurance and taxes, and taking the savings and investing your money elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Let's take some people whom you probably don't deal with, members of the 
middle class who might have an extra $5,000 or $10,000 at the end of the year 
to do something with. What should they be doing? 
</P>
<P>
A. Let's just put that in perspective. Our minimum-size individual account is 
$500,000. Somebody with $5,000 or $10,000 or $15,000 doesn't need an investment 
counselor. What they should be doing is sitting down and making a financial 
plan with a financial planner or their own accountant. In that plan, they would 
decide what to do with the liquid portion of their asset base. Assuming they 
have their house, some insurance and a car, then they may want to diversify the 
rest of their assets. The most inexpensive way to do it, and the most 
diversified way to do it, I think, would be to buy some good no-load mutual 
funds. But there are a lot of factors to consider, including the person's age, 
marital status, whether there are children . . . 
</P>
<P>
Q. But in general, for a limited amount of money, you would not look first to 
the stock market? 
</P>
<P>
A. It depends. If the person has emergency money put away, and everything else 
taken care of, then I think you have to look at extra money as investment 
money. And investment money to me means money you can buy real estate with, you 
can go into a limited partnership with, you can buy mutual funds with. Some 
people may want to invest their money in coins and stamps, which I don't know 
anything about, or in artwork. But it's very hard to do that with a limited 
amount of money and a limited amount of knowledge. So, giving your money to an 
investment firm makes the most sense. 
</P>
<P>
Q. We always hear about the guy who bought yesterday and made a million today 
in the market. 
</P>
<P>
A. He probably lost $2 million the day before yesterday. Our investment 
philosophy, and we try to educate our clients to this attitude, is that you 
have to be a long-term investor. And we like to think in terms of a three- to 
five-year outlook. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You left out of your list of investment channels things like precious 
metals. 
</P>
<P>
A. I mentioned earlier that we don't invest in any of that. We don't invest in 
any commodities. Nothing tangible, like real estate or diamonds or cemetery 
plots. It's not our area of expertise. It's too volatile, and we can't be all 
things to all people. So we have limited ourselves to be, as I mentioned, plain 
vanilla investment counselors dealing in cash, bonds and stock. If people want 
to invest in those other things, they need to find an expert in that area, or 
try and do it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you find with your individual clients that most are in real estate on 
their own? 
</P>
<P>
A. I'd say, generally speaking, that people who live in Orange County who are 
in their 50s or 60s, probably own their own home, maybe two homes, and probably 
have made one or two or three real estate investments along the way. What we 
have seen the last several years is people selling their real estate, when 
they've been able to, and putting the money into more liquid assets and 
generating more income than they were getting before. We've seen a lot of money 
come out of real estate in recent years. We've also seen a lot of new money 
generated in the last several years by individuals selling their companies. 
There's been a lot of that going on in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Q. If people are selling real estate and businesses, then someone else must be 
buying them. Where is that money coming from? 
</P>
<P>
A. In real estate you have a new element of buyers who are younger and willing 
to take the management time and effort to reconstruct a project or property. 
With companies, we're seeing buyers doing leveraged purchases with the 
company's assets pledged for bank loans. In the last year there have been a lot 
of local companies sold to other companies for strategic reasons. I think we 
will continue to see that -- the strong strategic buyer, domestic or foreign, 
buying up good companies with good names and good operations here in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Orange County is known far and wide as the investment scam capital of the 
universe. Why do we seem to have so many gullible people in our community who 
are willing to throw money away at people who promise them the moon? 
</P>
<P>
A. If you think about the communities that have this problem, they all have a 
couple of things in common. The other areas that are most known for scams are 
Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., and Phoenix and Scottsdale, Ariz. And what do they have 
in common? Retired people who are not highly educated, and people of all ages 
who want to live a certain lifestyle. They all go where the weather's nice, and 
they typically have higher incomes. They're more speculative; they're more 
aggressive; they're people who would take a flier on something -- and they 
usually get burned. In Orange County, I think -- and this is a pure conjecture 
on my part -- there are many divorced women who have a lot of money from their 
settlements and feel that they need to make more money. So they're willing to 
take more risk. I see it all the time. And so scam people set up shop here. 
They prey on people who are uneducated, greedy, who watch TV and think 
everybody should have all those things. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is there really that much wealth in the county? 
</P>
<P>
A. There is a lot. But there is a lot of flash too. You see all the people on 
boats at Newport and don't realize that a lot of those people have probably 
borrowed the boats. I used to say that we'd see the same fancy cars in Newport 
Beach all the time, but the people driving them would change frequently. I've 
met a lot of people who live well but have no money and are actually living 
from month to month. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How do you protect yourself against scams? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think you need to seek advice from people you trust. If you don't have a 
CPA or a law firm or somebody you can go to for help in checking out an 
investment opportunity, then you need to either talk to other clients of the 
firm or ask for certified records and background information. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Sounds like a lot of work, but I guess the bottom line is it's your money, 
you worked hard to make it. 
</P>
<P>
A. As they say, caveat emptor. You've got to do your homework because it's 
"buyer beware." These frauds are very frustrating to me personally. You read in 
the paper that $30 million was raised by some firm, some boiler room operation, 
and that they've run off with the money. Look what happened in Irvine recently 
with (FundAmerica). When they were active, investors couldn't get in the door 
the lines were so long. They had these meetings every week and the place was 
packed. You just knew that was coming.

SHORT CUTS TO FASHION FOR THOSE OVER 40 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
Thierry Mugler has a motto: "Too much is just enough." And he pushes it to the 
limit in his spring 1991 fashion collection. His show was the first to get 
people talking during a week of ready-to-wear collections that ends Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
With Madonna and Grace Jones in the audiences Thursday night, and with Diana 
Ross and Mick Jaggar's daughter, Jade, modeling, Mugler's newest styles had 
some tough competition. 
</P>
<P>
But they were up to the challenge. Steel-tip bra tops, bikini pant suits, 
towering platform shoes, patent leather short shorts, stretch vinyl leggings 
and itsy-bitsy body suits are just the start of this over-the-top collection. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrity models Lauren Hutton and Iman proved just how good these body 
grippers can look on women older than 40 who stay in shape. 
</P>
<P>
Before the show, Mugler announced that he will launch his first new fragrance. 
Too bad he didn't have a few bottles on hand to bribe his show's security 
guards, who somehow managed to keep ticket-holders outside but let 
gate-crashers in. Even Mugler's designer chum, Azzedine Alaia, didn't make the 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
This was the first of several fights to break out during fashion week. Another 
started Saturday at the Claude Montana show, when Elsa Klensch, whose cable 
television fashion show is a favorite among fashion buffs, found someone 
sitting in her assigned seat. The noisy exhibition tent fell silent as a 
security guard was called. Klensch and her adversary both refused to budge. 
Finally, an usher brought in an extra chair and set it up in the aisle. Klensch 
got her seat, the other woman moved to the new one. 
</P>
<P>
That same day, New York magazine reporter Michael Gross made headlines in 
Women's Wear Daily for having switched the seating chart at the John Galiano 
show earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
Gross had moved his place card to the first row and moved WWD publisher John 
Fairchild's back to row two. A story about it appeared on WWD's gossip page. 
Headline: "Grossed Out." 
</P>
<P>
Montana's show was one of the best so far. He showed satin evening dresses with 
asymmetric hems and silver hard wear that were perfect. An ivory-colored trench 
coat, short in front and long in back, has wide sashes at the cuff that prove 
glamorous and romantic at the same time. A series of beaded body suits with 
white linen skirts or shorts is the best answer of the season for day or night 
dressing. There was not one mistake or disappointment in this show. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, there were a few ideas basic to many collections. Body suits and 
leggings, short shorts and short dresses were the main ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Yohji Yamamoto calls his little black slip dresses with the split skirts, 
"nighties for the '90s." And they double as underwear. 
</P>
<P>
His black body suits that extend to the knee are also a type of underwear, 
because he treats them as a first layer of clothing. Over some he puts white 
linen skirts or apron dresses suspended from strings reminiscent of 
clothesline; over others he puts open-weave dresses, nipped at the waist and 
worn several inches shorter than the body suit beneath that shows through like 
a graceful shadow. 
</P>
<P>
Yamamoto's female fashion counterpart, Rei Kawakubo for comme Des Garcons, who 
is also Japanese-born and Paris-based, shows ankle-grazing shift dresses in 
semi-sheer print fabric over red or blue body suits. Hers are more like jump 
suits; they don't fit like a second skin. 
</P>
<P>
Happily, the surreal details Kawakubo adds in most of her collections are not 
part of her new spring line. No sleeves dangling from skirts, no hoods 
suspended from bodices. This new direction is toward more wearable feminine 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Lagerfeld, first to lift leggings to haute couture status with his Chanel 
collections of last year, features leggings again this season in his own 
signature line. 
</P>
<P>
They look newest when he puts them under sequined evening wear, especially his 
body-conscious T-shirt dresses, or open-back trapeze-shape tops and mini 
skirts. They are always thick, usually black or navy, Capri length and worn 
with the heel-less ankle boots that Lagerfeld uses throughout his spring 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
Other current-minded looks for night are pastel print leggings cut to mid-calf, 
topped with multilayer shirts or tunics in sheer versions of the same print 
fabric. It is an energetic collection that blends Lagerfeld's strong sense of 
street fashion with his sure-handed use of couture details. 
</P>
<P>
Lagerfeld uses cycle shorts as suit bottoms to go with fitted jackets cut waist 
length in front, dipping longer in back. 
</P>
<P>
Nino Cerruti builds pant suits from cycle shorts, too. He adds a tunic and long 
swing jacket. Jacqueline Jacobson, the Dorothee Bis designer, puts shorts under 
knee-baring trapeze dresses made of semi-sheer fabric so the shorts show 
through. 
</P>
<P>
Mugler and Alaia had a chance to make up at the Jean Paul Gaultier show Friday 
night. They talked across the aisle to each other. (It's not unusual for 
designers to attend each other's shows in Paris, although in New York, it's 
all-but-unheard of; somehow, in the Big Apple, it's implied, you're there to 
steal ideas, not show support.) 
</P>
<P>
Romantic love was the theme at Gaultier's show, attend by Madonna and Catherine 
Deneuve. There were rose pedals scattered on the floor, bird calls filled the 
air, and the first models were an Adam and Eve of the '90s. He wore sheer 
tights and a fig leaf, she wore a serpent bra. 
</P>
<P>
Things got really rowdy after that. Clothes were modeled by couples or 
sometimes ambiguously related trios. Men wore wigs -- black dreadlocks or pink 
Louis XIV styles. And they wore daffodil-yellow suits with matching 
cowboy-style neck kerchiefs, or sarong-skirted suits in men's wear fabrics, an 
idea Gaultier has played with for years. 
</P>
<P>
Women wore sarong skirts in men's wear fabric, too -- or men's wear fabric 
jackets over ruffled cyclist shorts. 
</P>
<P>
The '60s revival styles in the collection look right, updated with newer 
fabrics and shapes. White vinyl T-shirts and banker gray suits are winners. 
</P>
<P>
Showpieces include a coat for romantic-minded career women, which was navy blue 
pin stripe to the waist with a burst of navy blue tulle from there to the 
floor. The clear vinyl matador's jacket embroidered in gold and jewels was the 
men's wear item of flamboyant choice. 
</P>
<P>
"We have sold four of them at $10,000 each, and we don't even have them in the 
store yet, only photographs," said Barbara Weiser after the Gaultier show. 
Weiser, an owner of Charivari, the New York boutique chain, and other retailers 
visiting Paris admit to being worried. 
</P>
<P>
Recession talk has them debating whether to stock up on classic clothes with 
long-wearing life spans or choose the more extraordinary items. 
</P>
<P>
"Not everyone wants classic clothes, cutting-edge avant garde is what goes with 
some peoples' personality," said Tommy Perse, who owns Maxfield in Los Angeles, 
with his wife, Ann Marie. Maxfield will carry a certain amount of modern 
classic clothing, Perse said. But more than that, he added, "We're looking for 
the new." 
</P>
<P>
Joan Kaner, senior vice president and fashion director of Nieman Marcus, said, 
"We'll buy the show pieces," then added, "We're likely to cut back and buy 
less." 
</P>
<P>
Kal Ruttenstein of Bloomingdales said, "I need impulse buys at $1,500. The 
economy is frightening, but to buy classics for our customers doesn't work. 
They want fashion." 
</P>
<P>
At the Issey Miyake show, there was some of both. Classic Miyake are shaped 
dresses in tiny-pleat fabric. This time, the sleeves are shaped like question 
marks until the wearer pushes them up, to find that they wrap and pleat around 
the arm like modern sculpture. The "dinosaur" jacket of wire-framed fabric has 
an armor-plate appearance. It folds into a reptile shape you can put on the 
coffee table. 
</P>
<P>
Black rubber tank tops, ruffled body suits teamed with vests made entirely of 
canvas pouches, and a honeycomb evening outfit that Miyake compares to ribbon, 
established the designer's unique vision. Yet the clothes in this collection 
are completely wearable. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly there is a recession," Miyake said after his show. 
</P>
<P>
"You see it all over the world. And yes, store owners are worried. But I am a 
designer, my duty is to show what is contemporary and what is the future. If 
designers look back, we get left behind."

<TEXT>
<P>
Like the world champion Cincinnati Reds sweeping the heavily favored Oakland 
Athletics, CBS' World Series telecasts did the same to the competition in the 
prime time ratings race. 
</P>
<P>
On both Friday and Saturday evenings, CBS was the most watched network, 
according to overnight ratings from 24 metered major markets released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The network had also won Tuesday and Wednesday nights. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's fourth game drew a 22.5 rating and was seen by 38% of all households 
watching television during its time slot. CBS received a 20.6 rating for the 
entire prime-time block, which also included the World Series pregame show. 
</P>
<P>
NBC averaged an 11.8 for its normally high-rating comedy lineup of 
"Parenthood," "Working It Out," "The Golden Girls," "Empty Nest," "Carol &amp; 
Company" and "American Dreamer." ABC was last at 9.5 with the 1987 movie 
"Adventures in Babysitting," and "Twin Peaks." 
</P>
<P>
CBS averaged an 18.6 rating Friday night, as Cincinnati's 8-3 victory received 
a 20.8. Friday night's usual ratings winner, ABC, trailed with a 15.1, with NBC 
last at 8.9. ABC and NBC both aired their regularly scheduled Friday lineups. 
</P>
<P>
National ratings will be announced today. STEVEN HERBERT

HORTON'S SHAGGY DIRECTOR STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four years ago, before they created "thirtysomething," Edward Zwick and 
Marshall Herskovitz wrote a TV movie in which home-video footage was used to 
tell the story of an adolescent filmmaker trying to make sense of his mother's 
fatal bout with manic depression. But they couldn't agree on which of them 
would direct it. 
</P>
<P>
When they finally sold it to NBC, still arguing over who should direct, they 
struck a compromise and gave the job to Peter Horton. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Horton? The shaggy-maned actor who plays Gary, the I'll-never-grow-up 
English professor on "thirtysomething"? The blond guy who looked perfect for 
his part in that forgettable beach volleyball movie "Side Out"? The man who 
used to be married to Michelle Pfeiffer? 
</P>
<P>
Yep. And, according to Zwick and Herskovitz, who had hired Horton to direct six 
episodes of "thirtysomething" before handing him the reins of "Extreme 
Close-Up" (airing at 9 tonight), he's a formidable one. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel quite old enough to be a mentor," said Zwick, now 38 and the 
director of last year's feature film "Glory." "But I know there is a great 
pride in having devoted real time and collaboration with someone and to see 
their mastery just bubble up." 
</P>
<P>
It's not unusual for actors to move behind the camera. But Horton's ambition 
was to direct even before his acting role on "thirty-something" made his 
feathery long hair and scruffy beard famous among women aged 18 to 
thirty-something. In fact, he turned down the part three times before finally 
signing up on the condition that he be allowed to direct episodes as well as 
act in them. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't love acting anymore," explained Horton, who before 
"thirtysomething" had appeared in such TV and feature films as "Freedom," 
"Children of the Corn" and "The Men's Club." "The roles I was getting weren't 
very good. I was fed up with it. I was really ready to be a director, and the 
notion of being commited to a series as an actor seemed like it would obviate 
that." 
</P>
<P>
But taking the part not only rekindled his interest in acting, Horton said, it 
bolstered his directing career -- maybe even saved it before it began. Unlike 
most other series, "thirtysomething" permits the director of each episode to 
experiment, to risk, to strut his or her stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"Because Ed and Marshall are directors themselves, they really encourage other 
directors to come on the show and really direct," Horton said. "They don't try 
to put the show in a straitjacket by saying, 'This is how we shoot. This is our 
lighting, this is how we cut. Now do it.' It's an incredibly unique laboratory 
in which to learn the craft." 
</P>
<P>
Horton, who gives his age only as thirtysomething, actually had directed 
before, a 1984 "Afterschool Special" for ABC called "One Too Many" that starred 
Pfeiffer, Mare Winningham and Val Kilmer. He persuaded the network to give him 
that chance on the strength of a home video he'd made of an F. Scott Fitzgerald 
short story, which starred friends from his acting class. He shot it in his 
living room with '40s period props left over from the movie "Swing Shift." 
</P>
<P>
"Initially I had a college degree in music and I wanted someday to become a 
conductor," Horton said. "So I had that leaning to begin with -- that need for 
control and that need to be the boss, not an employee." 
</P>
<P>
"Extreme Close-Up," starring Blair Brown, Craig T. Nelson and Morgan Weisser, 
is Horton's first chance to deploy some of the directorial expertise he's 
picked up on "thirtysomething" in a full-length film. Made for about $3 
million, it depicts the deterioration of a family of five as the mother's 
mental illness sinks them all into despair and alienation from one another. 
</P>
<P>
"Peter's real gift is that he knows exactly what he wants, but you really have 
the feeling that you have a great deal of latitude to try things in your job, 
whatever it is," said Brown, the amiable star of TV's "The Days and Nights of 
Molly Dodd" and the manic-depressive catalyst for the emotional wallop of 
Horton's TV film. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who directed the final two episodes of "Molly Dodd" that will air on the 
Lifetime cable channel next year, said that what lures actors to directing is 
simply that "you get tired of being the thing. The hair and makeup and all that 
other stuff is important, but it's not very interesting. And finally you are so 
limited by your own package -- who you are, what you look like, how you appear 
to other people. As a director you are limited only by your own imagination. 
You're freed to create and imagine, and you truly do feel more solidly yourself 
than you ever do as an actor." 
</P>
<P>
What Horton imagines now is moving into the Wonderland of feature film 
directing, where the production lasts three months instead of three weeks and 
the budgets are routinely six times more than what he had for "Extreme 
Close-Up." The problem, as he sees it, is that unless the director is someone 
like Martin Scorsese or Milos Forman, Hollywood is rarely open to serious, 
personal films like "Extreme Close-Up" or his "thirtysome-thing" episodes. 
Whatever their merits, such seriocomic movies as "When Harry Met Sally . . ." 
or "Ghost" are, Horton says, "a little too safe for me. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really hoping they give me a shot at 'Die Hard 3,' " he jokes. "But no, 
the key for me is finding something that really hits you, that is more than 
entertainment. Like in (Forman's) 'Loves of a Blonde,' there's a whole texture 
of feeling in there that gives you a whole new perspective on things. I'd love 
to do something like that." 
</P>
<P>
Isn't that a bit pretentious coming from someone who still has a long way to go 
before anyone compares him to Leonard Nimoy, let alone Forman? 
</P>
<P>
"Of course I can be pretentious," Horton answers, tugging at a strand of his 
hair. "I still have this beach thing to overcome."

A CHEAPER DOLLAR MAY NOT HELP A LOT OF U.S. EXPORTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
With the dollar plunging against the Japanese yen, Hannah Kirschner would love 
to be shipping her U.S.-made men's neckties across the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
The fine silk ties produced by her firm, Los Angeles-based Jacobs &amp; Roberts 
Ltd., should be more of a bargain than ever for Japanese buyers -- and thus 
more appealing. 
</P>
<P>
But Kirschner has looked into the export business, only to decide that "it's 
just too much hassle." In particular, though the dollar's slide may give her a 
price advantage, she has found that "the Japanese look for brand names only" -- 
so price often becomes meaningless if you aren't selling a well-known name. 
</P>
<P>
Kirschner's experience illustrates why the dollar's steep decline isn't the 
export panacea that it is frequently touted to be these days. As the dollar 
reaches near-record lows against the yen and other major currencies, many Bush 
Administration officials and private economists are practically cheering the 
slide, arguing that it will spark a new American export boom. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the drop in the dollar so far isn't translating into immediate new business 
for many exporters, especially small and mid-sized companies. Many of those 
firms in Southern California say they expect to benefit over the long term, but 
they don't anticipate the easy business that some economists seem to see. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll see it (the benefit) more in 1991 -- if the trend keeps up," says Mark 
Ryvola, manager of international business for communications equipment maker 
Emulex Corp. in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
In theory, the American exporter's advantage from the dollar's sinking value 
should work like this: At the start of the year, it took 1.69 German marks to 
buy one dollar. Now, it takes only 1.50 marks, as currency traders' faith in 
the United States economy -- and in our investments -- has plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
Say an American firm was selling a product in Germany for a price of 1.69 marks 
early this year. Each sale thus brought the exporter $1 when the firm exchanged 
currencies. Today, if the exporter sells the product for 1.69 marks in Germany, 
it reaps $1.13 when it exchanges currencies, because each mark buys more 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than take the windfall, the firm could cut its product price in Germany 
to 1.50 marks, and still bring home the same $1 it received early in the year. 
The advantage in cutting the price, of course, is that it should gain market 
share over competitors. 
</P>
<P>
But the pricing equation rarely is that simple, experts say. Stanley Epstein, 
who heads American Export Trading Co. in North Hollywood, says the immediate 
benefit of a falling dollar goes to "the items that the U.S. has been strongest 
in -- the items not available from other countries." For example, aerospace 
companies may gain because a dollar-driven cut in prices could attract buyers 
who have long wanted certain products but couldn't afford them. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of U.S. manufacturers, however, face a much tougher time 
exporting, even with the lower dollar, Epstein says. His firm has been 
assisting exporters for years, and he says many American businesses still don't 
understand the highly competitive nature of world markets. Prices that American 
companies think are fair won't fly in many markets, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pretty much of a screwed-up nation when it comes to export," Epstein 
says. "We still think in terms of being the sole source for the world," when 
that simply isn't true anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Even savvy exporters face tall hurdles today, despite the dollar advantage: 
</P>
<P>
* Many companies are unsure how frequently they ought to be changing prices, 
fearful that the dollar could backtrack on them. Personal computer maker AST 
Research in Irvine has stuck with a quarterly price-change system because "in 
the short term it's very difficult to adjust prices to the dollar's 
fluctuations," says Chief Executive Safi Qureshey. 
</P>
<P>
Even then, many companies are at the mercy of overseas middlemen-distributors, 
who may pad their own pockets by paying less for U.S. products as the dollar 
falls -- without cutting the price to their retail buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"It happens," says Qureshey. "Sometimes the middlemen say there is no need to 
cut the price." 
</P>
<P>
* Consumer-product exporters often face the same aggravation that Jacobs &amp; 
Roberts experienced with its neckties: Foreign buyers can be extremely 
brand-conscious, not responding to price. That's particularly true in Germany 
and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
* Currencies of some of the most aggressive young exporters -- such as Hong 
Kong and Taiwan -- move in concert with the dollar. Thus, those competitors 
never worry about American firms gaining a price advantage. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, given the potential for more manufacturing to shift to 
low-labor-cost markets, such as China and Eastern Europe, Epstein questions 
whether any currency advantage will be enough to make many U.S. firms 
competitive. "How cheap can we make the dollar?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
Still, many Southland companies are eager to sell more of their lines overseas, 
and more than a few are succeeding. For them, the falling dollar can only be a 
plus in the long run, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Emulex's Ryvola expects a boost for the firm's most competitive 
computer-communications products in Europe in 1991. The bulk of them are made 
in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Malouf, licensing director of beach clothing maker Sideout Sport in 
Pasadena, says a big European distributor has decided to have more of his line 
manufactured here for shipment to Europe, thanks to the cheaper dollar. The 
merchandise would have been manufactured in the Far East, Malouf said. 
</P>
<P>
And AST Research should benefit directly from the dollar's slide if one of its 
new computer systems -- which combines Japanese kanji characters and English -- 
takes off in Japan. The system will be made here for sale there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE DOLLAR: AN UNEVEN SLIDE WORLDWIDE 
</P>
<P>
The dollar is down more than 10% so far this year against most major 
currencies. But against currencies of most young U.S. trading partners in the 
Far East, the dollar is higher or unchanged -- a result of those countries' 
exchange-rate control strategies.

TURNER BOOSTS PATHE'S BID TO FINANCE MERGER; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: THE ATLANTA BROADCASTING FIRM LICENSES 1,000 FILMS FOR 10 YEARS. 
THE FEES COULD PROVIDE 15% OF THE CASH NEEDED FOR PATHE TO COMBINE WITH MGM/UA.

<P>
Pathe Communications' long search for financing to complete its proposed 
$1.3-billion merger with MGM/UA Communications got a boost Sunday as Turner 
Broadcasting System Inc. announced licensing agreements with MGM that could 
provide 15% of the cash for the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Pathe and Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting announced licensing agreements that 
will give Turner exclusive English-language television rights in the United 
States to broadcast nearly 1,000 films in the MGM/UA feature film library for 
10 years. Turner would not disclose how much the deal was worth. Analysts have 
valued the film library at $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which is contingent upon Pathe consummating a merger with 
MGM/UA, helps Pathe because the Beverly Hills-based company can use the license 
fees owed MGM/UA as an asset to secure funds to help pay for the deal. 
</P>
<P>
The Pathe-MGM/UA merger, which is scheduled to close tomorrow, was delayed 
earlier this year because of financial problems. Pathe has already made 
non-refundable payments totaling $353 million to MGM/UA and its shareholders, 
and has also pledged $75 million in securities. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the British newspaper The Independent -- citing an Italian source 
-- reported Sunday that Pathe Co-President Giancarlo Parretti has come up with 
$750 million for the merger through the sale of assets in Europe. The assets 
were not identified. 
</P>
<P>
Parretti has extensive holdings in Europe, including the British theater chain 
Cannon Cinemas. But there have been widespread doubts about whether Parretti's 
overseas assets could bring enough cash to finance the merger with MGM/UA. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the Parretti report, Pathe spokesman Craig Parson said: "We have 
long maintained a policy of not commenting on the source of financing." 
</P>
<P>
Kitsie Riggall, a spokeswoman for Turner Broadcasting, said the licensing deal 
was one of the largest in the company's history, far surpassing a $20-million, 
two-year licensing pact in December, 1989, for 1,000 Columbia Pictures films. 
</P>
<P>
Turner said it will pay the first installation of the license fees today. 
</P>
<P>
Financial experts said Pathe will probably need the entire amount owed by 
Turner Broadcasting to finance its $21.50-a-share purchase of MGM/UA. 
</P>
<P>
Among the films covered by the licensing agreement are: the first 16 James Bond 
movies, "Rocky I" through "Rocky IV" and the Pink Panther films. The deal also 
includes contemporary movies such as "Rainman" and "A Fish Called Wanda," as 
well as classic titles such as "West Side Story" and "The Good, the Bad and the 
Ugly." 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement issued Sunday, R. E. Turner III, chairman and president 
of Turner Broadcasting, praised the MGM/UA film library as "the finest 
collection of contemporary and classic movies available for license in the 
market today." 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA also will license to TBS SuperStation and another Turner broadcasting 
network the exclusive U.S. television rights to the Pink Panther cartoons, "The 
New Twilight Zone" and the science fiction series "Outer Limits." Each license 
period is about 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The agreements do not include any future MGM/UA productions. 
</P>
<P>
In another transaction, MGM/UA will license 300 films from the MGM/UA library 
for use on Turner Broadcasting's recently announced satellite-delivered, 
English-language feed to Latin America. The service is scheduled to begin 
operation in 1991.

KAISER STEEL'S COMEBACK BID; 
</P>
<P>
MANUFACTURING: THE ONCE-AILING COMPANY, NOW CONCENTRATING ON ENVIRONMENTAL 
OPERATIONS, RE-ENTERS THE PUBLIC STOCK MARKET. THE MOVE RENEWS HOPE FOR 
THOUSANDS OF THE FIRM'S SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RETIREES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA K. H. WALTERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The old Kaiser Steel Co. could be called a classic victim of the business 
excesses of the 1980s. Savvy investors walked into a vulnerable company and 
waltzed away with more money than they had brought; the company's assets were 
leveraged, exchanged and liquidated, and a debt-crippled company limped into 
bankruptcy court, its pockets bulging with lawyers' bills. 
</P>
<P>
Now, nearly two years after emerging from bankruptcy protection, a reorganized 
Kaiser Steel Resources is trying to build a future from the underpinnings of 
the old company -- its land, mines and water rights. Meanwhile, its KSC 
Recovery subsidiary pursues the old battles in a series of lawsuits against 
former officers, directors and shareholders whom it accuses of looting Kaiser 
Steel. 
</P>
<P>
Caught up in this turmoil have been thousands of former Kaiser employees 
throughout Southern California, who watched first their steel-making jobs, then 
their pensions and guaranteed lifetime medical insurance disappear. What they 
got in exchange was a half interest in a bankrupt company already torn by a 
protracted shareholder battle for control. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, last week, that half interest seemed to have some palpable worth when 
Kaiser Steel Resources, now concentrating on environmental businesses, 
re-entered the public stock market. Even in its very modest trading, the 
retirees saw prospects for funding their restored, but sharply reduced, medical 
benefits plan for as long as there still are Kaiser Steel retirees who need it. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the retirees have been depending on the lawsuits to keep the benefit 
plan going, but it has been "operating hand to mouth," said Nicholas Rickard, 
who retired from Kaiser Steel in 1983 and now serves on the board of the 
Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Assn., which administers the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuits have netted about $28 million in settlements -- a mere lick of 
water in a desert of debt. Less than one-third of the settlement proceeds so 
far have gone to the employee association, which got an initial $7 million in 
funding when the bankruptcy court ordered yet more Kaiser assets to be sold 
off. An even smaller amount has gone to repay the federal government, which 
took over the Kaiser Steel pension fund. Attorney and administrative fees ate 
up most of the rest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sad, sad tale," said Daniel M. Larson, president of KSC Recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Still pending are suits that will lead the recovery unit through a thicket of 
curious business decisions to the doorsteps of a curiouser group of players, 
including investors Irwin Jacobs and Joseph A. Frates, Drexel Burnham Lambert, 
First Boston Corp. -- and even the Resolution Trust Corp., as inheritors of a 
failed Oklahoma savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
Some former directors and officers feel stung by accusations that they abetted 
what current management calls the looting of Kaiser Steel. 
</P>
<P>
Among them is Stephen A. Girard, who as chairman of Kaiser Steel began the 
shutdown of its mill operations in 1981, oversaw its transfer to new owners in 
1984 and remained on the board until early 1987. His attorney, Daniel Schwab, 
said the oil price collapse in the mid-1980s -- not looting -- caused troubles 
for Kaiser, which had refocused itself on energy-related business. Schwab said 
Girard and other directors of that period did not enrich themselves at Kaiser's 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
Yet some people clearly did profit. They include Jacobs' investment group, 
which earned $14 million in "greenmail" in 1983 when it bought Kaiser Steel 
stock, made a bid for the company, then agreed to back out -- for a premium -- 
when other suitors bid higher. Jacobs is among hundreds of individuals, 
brokerages and professional advisers being sued -- and suing -- in a round of 
charges and countercharges that Jacobs' attorney, Joseph Meyer, calls "dizzying 
and bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
KSC Recovery also sued the group that won the bidding war for Kaiser Steel -- 
the partnership of Denver coal man Monty Rial and Frates. 
</P>
<P>
Rial's Perma Resources and Frates' Tulsa, Okla., investment group went 50-50 in 
their 1984 leveraged buyout of Kaiser. A year later, Rial used the company's 
assets to buy out Frates. Rial was ousted in 1986, when he lost a battle for 
control of Kaiser to dissident shareholder Bruce Hendry. 
</P>
<P>
Hendry took the company into bankruptcy in 1987 and oversaw the transition to 
new management, including current Chairman Richard E. Stoddard, in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Girard's attorney Schwab said it was the Hendry team and not the former 
directors and executives who abrogated Kaiser's responsibilities to its 
retirees. He suggested that the bankruptcy filing was motivated not by the 
company's condition but by a desire to eliminate those responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the retirees strongly disagree. "If it wasn't for Hendry, we wouldn't 
have had anything," said Ronald Bitonti of Fontana, who represents fellow 
Kaiser Steel retirees on the benefits association board and is an international 
representative for the United Steelworkers of America. "The people who caused 
the company to go bankrupt were Monty Rial and Frates and that gang. They raped 
the company." 
</P>
<P>
Though the company has settled with Rial, it is still suing Frates, contending 
that he fraudulently made $40 million on his original $1-million investment. 
Part of Frates' take was a valuable piece of Fontana real estate which he later 
used as collateral to buy failing State Federal Savings &amp; Loan and its 
development subsidiary in Tulsa. KSC Recovery hopes to at least get back $11 
million from the sale of that property being held in escrow by the Resolution 
Trust Corp., which now controls the savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
Also pending are actions against a number of shareholders, their brokers, 
investment bankers and other professional advisers, including Drexel Burnham 
and First Boston. KSC Recovery wants to recoup some of the gains investors 
realized during the rapid succession of takeovers, as well as fees Kaiser Steel 
paid to consultants for what KSC Recovery now believes was bad advice. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the number of lawsuits, few expect the settlements or proceeds to 
return Kaiser to the days when it was cash-healthy and asset-wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
But nearly everyone involved in the drama believes that there's a gold mine in 
the assets of Kaiser Steel Resources. 
</P>
<P>
The "gold mine" is actually Eagle Mountain, the iron ore mine about 60 miles 
due east of Palm Springs that, in 40 years of operation, yielded millions of 
tons of ore for use in Kaiser's steel-making operations. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser, now based in Rancho Cucamonga, plans to turn the Eagle Mountain site 
into a landfill. "We made some extremely large holes in the ground there. It 
could take care of Los Angeles County and surrounding areas' landfill problems 
for the next 100 years," said retiree Rickard. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser's own Eagle Mountain train, which used to ship the ore to the Fontana 
plant, would be used to transport the refuse over Southern Pacific railroad 
lines to the site. 
</P>
<P>
The plan for Eagle Mountain, which still has some regulatory hurdles to 
overcome, is one of four primary focus areas for Kaiser Steel Resources, all of 
which rely on assets that once were devoted to steel-making operations. 
</P>
<P>
The others: 
</P>
<P>
* An industrial park at the former steel plant in Fontana. The company owns 
nearly 1,000 acres of land there, in prime Inland Empire industrial country. 
That figure includes a 288-acre parcel reclaimed by KSC Recovery as part of the 
settlement of its suit against Rial, but not the nearby parcel that Frates got. 
</P>
<P>
* Fontana Union Water Co., which provides water to the Fontana area. 
</P>
<P>
* A waste treatment plant in Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
Where the old Kaiser Steel was a struggling company in a declining industry, 
the reorganized firm views itself as being in growth businesses. And most 
observers agree. 
</P>
<P>
"Kaiser is a gold mine for its present owners (because of) assets it had all 
along," said attorney Schwab. 
</P>
<P>
The problem for many retirees is waiting for those assets to start producing a 
flow of cash. The benefits group estimates it will cost $4 million to $5 
million annually to provide what amounts to half the former health benefits, 
with insurance costs still taking double-digit leaps each year. 
</P>
<P>
Some retirees who were young enough at the time of the bankruptcy found jobs 
and benefits elsewhere. Some have died. And others suffered through many months 
without benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some older people on small pensions who were ill when we lost 
hospitalization (benefits), and their doctors were giving them prescriptions 
they couldn't afford to have filled," said Thomas Rabone, who after 33 years at 
Kaiser retired when the mill was shut down 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the retirees' portfolio is all Kaiser stock. "They need cash to fund 
their liabilities," said Scott L. Beiser, managing director of Houlihan, Lokey, 
Howard &amp; Zukin, a Los Angeles-based banking firm that is advising the 
employee benefits association about managing its assets. Beiser said the 
company's return to the public stock market will give retirees the option of 
liquidating some of their assets and diversifying into a more traditional 
portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
For the roughly 6,000 retirees still being served by the medical and pension 
plans, that option is a welcome relief. 
</P>
<P>
"A little bit of the bitterness has worn off," said Rabone. "All we have left 
now is the company and the success of the company to subsidize retirees with 
health and medical needs. We've promised to get as much as we can and as soon 
as we can, but it's unrealistic to think we'll recover a major portion of what 
(we) lost."

'Terminator' Figures Sue Hemdale Film Corp.: Loan-out companies for the star, 
producer, writer and special effects coordinator on the film "The Terminator" 
sued Hemdale Film Corp. and Orion Pictures alleging they breached a contract 
for distribution of profits from the film. The Los Angeles Superior Court 
lawsuit said the film's producer, Gale Anne Hurd, star Arnold Schwarzenegger, 
writer James Cameron and special effects coordinator Stan Winston had 
agreements with Hemdale, which financed the movie, to split profits from the 
film. 
</P>
<P>
The suit said Hemdale breached the agreement by entering into unauthorized 
transactions with other companies, such as Eurofilm Funding Limited, Interlink 
Group and Orbis Communications, and granting them a percentage of the film's 
profits and various fees. The suit seeks unspecified damages and an accounting 
of profits owed. (Case No. BC012873. Filed Oct. 16, 1990).

MCDONNELL DOUGLAS' SPACE UNIT IS EXPANDING; 
</P>
<P>
AEROSPACE: THE HUNTINGTON BEACH-BASED SUBSIDIARY IS A BRIGHT SPOT FOR THE 
RETRENCHING COMPANY. FUTURE GROWTH IS TIED TO THE SPACE STATION.

<P>
While other units of aerospace and defense giant McDonnell Douglas Corp. are 
cutting back, McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. is growing. 
</P>
<P>
Employment at the Huntington Beach-based space center division has increased 
from about 1,600 to 1,900 this year, officials say. If Congress decides to go 
all out in funding the space station Freedom, the unit could add up to 1,000 
more workers at its Kennedy Space Center facility in the next three to five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The optimistic employment report came Friday from Ken Francis, president of the 
space systems division. He spoke at the dedication of an 82,000-square-foot, 
$9-million building at the Kennedy Space Center facility. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking forward to real good growth in this area -- if Congress gets it 
act together," Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
The space systems unit is a bright spot for the St. Louis-based parent. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the company announced plans to cut up to 11% of its 130,000-member 
work force. It said declining aerospace business and dwindling government 
contracts left it with no choice but to cut costs by $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas has contracts to process payloads for the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Defense Department. It also 
launches commercial Delta rockets from Cape Canaveral and has other space 
projects in Brevard County. 
</P>
<P>
The space division's workload has picked up this year because employees work on 
payloads months or even years ahead of scheduled launches. 
</P>
<P>
As for the future, company officials are watching funding decisions on the 
space station. A compromise between the House and Senate cut $600 million from 
the station budget, leaving NASA with $1.9 billion for the project in the 
fiscal year that started Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The economic health of space companies hinges on the space station budget, said 
Bob Allen, executive director of the Space Coast Development Commission in 
Titusville. The space station program would provide work for the space shuttle 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
"If the space station doesn't get funded, we're not going to be flying 
shuttles," Allen said. "I believe that the space station is still a very viable 
project."

PHILIPPINE AIRLINES WILL BE TAKEN PRIVATE NEXT YEAR

The Philippines plans to privatize flag-carrier Philippine Airlines next year, 
officials said over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman said the government wants to sell up to 35% of the carrier 
to a foreign airline and 45% to employees and the public. That would leave the 
government with a 20% holding. 
</P>
<P>
The airline is now about 99% government-owned. 
</P>
<P>
PAL is among 300 government properties that President Corazon Aquino targeted 
for privatization under an ambitious program launched in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
PAL Chairman Feliciano Belmonte said the foreign investor would be limited to a 
35% interest so PAL could maintain its status as the official flag carrier. 
</P>
<P>
The carrier's spokesman declined to say what foreign airlines PAL would 
negotiate with. 
</P>
<P>
Belmonte said the company is raising funds to buy back foreign debt of $650 
million as the first step toward privatization. 
</P>
<P>
This will be followed by the sale of equity to a foreign carrier. The final 
step will be sale of equity to employees and the public through the stock 
exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Belmonte said, 51% of the airline will be sold by the middle of 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
Officials announced the privatization plan at the company's annual meeting 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
To cope with increasing passenger demand and to make itself attractive to 
buyers, PAL began an expansion and modernization plan last year. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the company now has 14 wide-body aircraft -- seven Boeing 747s, 
two DC10-30s and five A300-B4s. 
</P>
<P>
Two more 747s will be added by February of next year. 
</P>
<P>
The company posted a profit of $22.4 million in the fiscal year ending in 
March, 1990, the highest in its 50-year history. That was 90% more than the 
previous year's $11.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Balancing the good news about profit are alleged corruption problems at the 
carrier. Two top PAL executives were suspended this summer while the company 
investigates alleged fraud amounting to about $77 million.

Domestic vehicle production by Japan's top two auto makers, Toyota Motor Corp. 
and Nissan Motor Co., continued to decrease in September amid signs of slowing 
exports and domestic sales. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota said its production was down 1.5% from a year ago to 334,373 units, the 
third consecutive year-to-year fall. 
</P>
<P>
Production of passenger cars increased 3% to 265,100 units, but trucks and 
buses fell 3.9% to 69,273 units. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota said domestic sales decreased 1.6% to 192,823 units. It was the first 
year-to-year drop in 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Exports decreased 4.9% to 134,001 units, the first fall in four months, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan said its production decreased 2.1% to 203,025 units. Passenger cars, 
which accounted for 170,614 units, were down 3%, while commercial vehicles were 
up 3.2% to 32,411 units. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo-based company said its domestic sales increased 1.3% to 127,225 
units. Sales of passenger cars, however, declined 1.8% to 96,959 units. 
Commercial vehicle sales soared 12.5% to 30,266 units, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Exports plunged 12.2% to 88,254 units, the 13th consecutive year-to-year fall, 
the company said.

A subsidiary of U.S. computer maker Atari Corp. has been indicted in Taiwan on 
charges of using pirated copies of software programs. 
</P>
<P>
A criminal indictment for copyright infringement was handed down against Atari 
Taiwan Manufacturing Corp. and two employees this month, according to the 
Business Software Alliance, a coalition of U.S. software companies. 
</P>
<P>
A court-ordered search of the company in April turned up what prosecutors 
allege were unauthorized copies of Ashton Tate's dBase III Plus software and 
Lotus Development Corp.'s Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet program. 
</P>
<P>
Atari said the programs were used by the two employees against company policy. 
Since the case involved only about a dozen allegedly pirated copies, the 
company accused the Business Software Alliance of blowing it out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
"We fight this kind of (piracy) all the time," said August Liguori, vice 
president of finance. "It would be foolish for us to cheat our own peers over a 
few hundred dollars." 
</P>
<P>
The case is part of a high-profile campaign by the alliance to crack down on 
those who illegally copy programs for their own use or for sale. Software 
piracy, which is particularly bad overseas, costs developers $16 billion a year 
in lost revenue, according to the alliance.

<P>
To Chung Ju Yung, founder of the massive Hyundai group, the Soviet Union's 
recent diplomatic recognition of South Korea was a simple matter. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed each other economically," he said in an interview. "If there is an 
economic need, politics will follow." 
</P>
<P>
Chung, 74, South Korean business's self-appointed ambassador to the Soviet 
Union, did more than any other executive to persuade Moscow to establish ties 
with Seoul, archenemy of Moscow ally North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Now he is pioneering a new form of economic cooperation: trilateral projects 
involving China, the Soviet Union and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, he suggested, such projects could include North Korea as well. 
</P>
<P>
Hyundai has put up $30 million to start a joint Soviet-South Korean forestry 
operation at Svetlaya, north of Vladivostok, that will employ 500 Chinese and 
500 Chinese of Korean ancestry by next spring, he said. Three hundred of the 
workers from China are already on the job, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Exports of timber to South Korea, which are expected to amount to around $100 
million a year when the project is fully developed, will start as early as next 
January, he said. 
</P>
<P>
How multinational cooperation in Northeast Asian development progresses, Chung 
said, "will largely depend on how China's policy changes." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how many (multinational) projects will emerge, but there 
certainly will be some projects forthcoming," he predicted. "Eventually, North 
Korea will join." 
</P>
<P>
On his first trip to Beijing last month to attend the Asian Games, Chung said, 
he found "Chinese authorities very enthusiastic about sending their workers" to 
such projects as the Svetlaya forestry undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that Chinese authorities had urged Hyundai to join in the 
bidding for offshore oil and gas drilling in Pohai Bay, the first such offer 
reported to have been made to a South Korean businessman. Chung told the 
Chinese that he would consider the offer. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, Chinese officials were reluctant to meet (South) Korean officials and 
businessmen," he said. "But this time we had no trouble meeting Chinese 
officials in charge of economic affairs." 
</P>
<P>
He said he met both China's construction minister and the president of the 
state corporation in charge of petroleum development. 
</P>
<P>
Chung indicated that he was not interested in Japanese participation in 
multinational Northeast Asian projects, an idea that has gained some support 
among Japanese businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
"Japanese have their own vested interests in China and are focusing on 
commodity sales to the Soviet Union," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chung is now "honorary chairman" of the $32-billion Hyundai empire of firms 
that manufacture everything from automobiles and ships to semiconductors and 
has made an international imprint in the construction business. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, South Korea's prime minister, Kang Young Hoon, made the first-ever 
trip by a head of the South Korean Cabinet to North Korea's capital of 
Pyongyang for talks with his Communist counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
The visit, made to reciprocate North Korean Prime Minister Yon Hyong Muk's 
September trip to Seoul, came in the wake of Pyongyang's decision to seek 
diplomatic ties with Japan and the announcement of the Seoul-Moscow diplomatic 
ties. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Chung said, he sees little prospect of change in North Korea in the next 
year. "Change in North Korea will probably be more gradual," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he made it clear that promoting change in North Korea, where he was born, 
has been the prime goal of his six trips to the Soviet Union and the nine 
development projects he has promised to consider with the nation that has been 
North Korea's chief supplier of weapons since before the 1950-53 Korean war. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always been interested in normalization of North-South Korea 
relations," he said. "I thought the Soviet Union could be a significant factor 
in making that happen (and that) it would be the key to making South Korea be 
not in conflict with the North." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, a reunified Korea "would be a self-sufficient economy," he said. 
"We would no longer need exports to grow." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years or so after reunification, a single Korea would be a giant on the 
world scene, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
If the North and South were reunified within two or three years, "the 
per-capita gross national product would be very comparable to Japan's" by the 
year 2010, he said. That would translate into a GNP half the size of Japan's by 
2010. 
</P>
<P>
North and South Korea have a combined population of about 60 million, compared 
to Japan's 120 million. 
</P>
<P>
Chung said he will make his seventh trip to the Soviet Union next month in an 
attempt to firm up a list of eight other possible joint ventures that Hyundai 
is considering. Among them are ship repair facilities, coal mining and natural 
gas development and a factory to build personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
He said he expects about half the targeted projects to come to fruition after 
feasibility studies are conducted. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of the investment that the South Korean conglomerate would make, the 
projects would range in value from tens of millions to hundreds of millions of 
dollars, he said.

Foreign companies are leaving South Korea to escape rising wages, which have 
weakened the country's competitive edge, the nation's central bank says. 
</P>
<P>
After rapid economic growth between 1986 and 1988, the economy has been hit 
hard by labor strife. 
</P>
<P>
Strikes have mushroomed since 1987, when democratic reforms began allowing 
labor activism. As a result, wages have risen more than 60%. 
</P>
<P>
"Foreigners are now seeking cheaper laborers in Asian countries like Thailand," 
said Im Jae-ho of the Bank of Korea. 
</P>
<P>
The central bank said 111 foreign companies left in the first nine months of 
this year, compared to 27 in the same period of 1989. Meanwhile, only 177 
opened new offices the first nine months -- against 254 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"Companies dealing in low value-added goods like garments and shoes seem to 
want to switch to other Asian countries," Im said.

Two "boot camps" for young drug abusers opened today in the San Gabriel 
Mountains as Los Angeles County joined a debated national trend toward 
quasi-military programs for delinquents. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-age drug abusers who are made wards of the court will get heavy doses of 
exercise, military drills and drug counseling in addition to full days of 
classes, said Harold Garrison, director of one of the facilities, Camp 
Mendenhall. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Anhalt, director of Camp Munz, the other facility, said the program is 
intended to instill discipline and self-esteem. "Some of these kids have never 
been part of a team other than a gang," he said. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, the sponsor of the idea, said 214 juveniles 
already have arrived at the camps.

A man was in custody this morning, booked as a suspect in the fatal 
gang-related shooting of a 20-year-old Corona man, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Police declined to identify the suspect, saying the investigation is 
continuing. 
</P>
<P>
According to a police account, the victim, Roberto Gonzalez, was walking down 
Tustin Avenue when several men on bicycles approached him. Soon, the group 
began arguing and one suspect pulled a handgun, shooting Gonzalez in the chest, 
police said. Gonzalez was pronounced dead shortly after the shooting at 4 p.m. 
Sunday. Police said they do not know what prompted the argument.

A humpback whale was found beached on mud flats south of Candlestick Park 
today, snarling traffic as commuters on a bayside freeway slowed to watch the 
stranded creature, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Marine biologists were trying to learn why the whale was stuck in three feet of 
water near the edge of San Francisco Bay, about half a mile south of the 
stadium. The whale may have been the same one seen swimming in the bay south of 
Candlestick on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard said it was sending out two boats with biologists from the 
Marine Mammal Center and National Marine Fisheries Service to see if they could 
help the whale.

GENETIC PARENTS GET BABY;

Declaring that surrogate mother Anna L. Johnson has no parental rights to the 
baby she was hired to bear, a judge today granted full rights to the infant's 
genetic parents, Mark and Crispina Calvert. 
</P>
<P>
In a sweeping affirmation of surrogate mother contracts, Orange County Superior 
Court Judge Richard N. Parslow Jr. also refused to continue Johnson's 
visitation rights to the 5-week-old baby boy while Johnson's lawyers appeal the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I decline to split the child emotionally between two mothers," Parslow said, 
adding that the genetic parents "should not have to live for the next 18 years 
waiting for the other shoe to drop." 
</P>
<P>
To a mob of reporters outside the courtroom, Mark Calvert said, "The time will 
come when our son will be aware of (his origins) and that we wanted him so much 
that we went through this ordeal." Bitter about Johnson's role, Calvert added, 
"The only bonding Anna Johnson has is with your television cameras." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who spent the morning in church rather than the courtroom, said at a 
press conference later that she was devastated. 
</P>
<P>
"To sum up, in one word, heartbroken. . . . I'm in a deep state of mourning for 
my son," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her lawyer, Richard C. Gilbert, said he will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"When the judge screws up at the trial level, it's the baby that takes the 
fall," he said. "And he screwed up." 
</P>
<P>
In a half-hour oral decision delivered to a packed courtroom, the judge 
compared Johnson's role to that of a foster mother, who feeds, nurtures and may 
grow attached to the baby but may be required to relinquish the child to the 
natural mother. 
</P>
<P>
In reaching his decision, Parslow said he relied heavily on the proven genetic 
link between the Calverts and the child, and he emphasized the importance of 
heredity. He said he found evidence about the bonding of the baby to the 
gestational mother to be less clear. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not an adoption ruling case. It's not a baby-selling case. It's not a 
Baby M case where we had natural mothers on both sides," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he believes there is nothing illegal about surrogacy contracts 
like the one signed between Johnson and the Calverts, in which Johnson promised 
to carry the baby created from the Calverts' egg and sperm in exchange for 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The in vitro fertilization genie is out of the bottle, and you're not going to 
be able to put it back," Parslow said. Such contracts are enforceable, he said, 
adding, "Altruism aside, there's nothing wrong with getting paid for nine 
months of what I understand to be a lot of misery and a lot of bad days." 
</P>
<P>
In a sweeping repudiation of Johnson, 29, the judge noted that she is an 
educated, articulate professional who had had multiple pregnancies and "offered 
to serve" the Calverts. "I cannot remember having seen a cooler witness 
testifying in court," Parslow added. 
</P>
<P>
The Calverts call the baby Christopher Michael, but he could not be legally 
named until the legal questions surrounding his birth were resolved. The baby's 
guardian, William Steiner, said, "The first thing I'm going to do is put this 
baby's name on a birth certificate."

<P>
KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov said today that organized crime in the Soviet 
Union is booming with the help of foreign-backed private companies. 
</P>
<P>
"Organized crime has assumed a scale we could never have expected a couple of 
years ago. . . . Brutality, violence and sadism have become widespread," he 
told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The head of the Soviet security police said criminals are taking advantage of 
political disarray as the country tries to move to a market economy. Chronic 
shortages have bred a thriving black market controlled by organized bands 
operating across frontiers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Joint ventures -- private enterprises set up with foreign backing under 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform program -- have become a front for 
large-scale crime, Kryuchkov said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are young businessmen, we don't have experience, our firms don't have their 
own intelligence and counterintelligence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But we've got to come to grips with them (joint ventures) because our state 
suffers great losses. You just can't imagine how much. I estimate it runs into 
billions of dollars," he added. The formulation of tight laws regulating the 
activity of joint enterprises must be a high priority, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of joint ventures have been set up, largely with West European and 
North American companies. 
</P>
<P>
Interior Ministry officials say raids on some private companies have yielded 
vast hauls of contraband goods, guns, flak jackets and even explosives. 
</P>
<P>
Interior Ministry officials say some joint enterprises and purely Soviet-owned 
private cooperatives are used as fronts to smuggle abroad valuable Soviet goods 
such as caviar. Computers and other scarce equipment are then smuggled into the 
country where they fetch high black market prices. 
</P>
<P>
The operations drain the country of much-needed foreign currency. 
</P>
<P>
Kryuchkov said the Soviet Union's recent entry into the international police 
organization Interpol could help the battle against organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
"We are working very badly in this battle against organized crime," Interior 
Minister Vadim Bakatin told the same news conference.

President Suharto ranked first in the poll. The founder of Islam came 11th,

COCAINE FOUND TO SPUR GROWTH OF AIDS VIRUS;

Cocaine has been found to speed the growth of the AIDS virus in laboratory 
tests, prompting concern that it could increase infected people's chances of 
developing the deadly disease, microbiology researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the University of Minnesota Medical School took cells known as 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells -- the primary target for HIV, the AIDS 
virus -- and exposed them to doses of cocaine in laboratory testing. 
</P>
<P>
HIV was found to grow as much as three times faster in the cocaine-laced tests 
than in control studies. 
</P>
<P>
If what happened in the test tube happens in HIV-infected cocaine users, it 
could increase their risk of developing AIDS, said Dr. Ronald Schut, lead 
researcher in the Minnesota study. 
</P>
<P>
"In persons who are infected, if they continue to abuse this drug it may have a 
significant impact on the development of clinical AIDS," Schut said. 
</P>
<P>
Test-tube tests, however, don't always mimic what happens in the human body. 
The question now for researchers is whether drug use somehow modifies the 
immune system to enhance HIV growth in humans. 
</P>
<P>
Further studies are under way.

Parliament today ousted the Communist Party chief from its upper house after 
his criticisms of government reforms prompted nationwide anti-Communist 
protests. 
</P>

The dismissal of Vasil Mohorita followed President Vaclav Havel's firing last 
week of Gen. Miroslav Vacek as defense minister -- to regain civilian control 
of the military after four decades of Communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
Mohorita was dismissed today from the 40-member Parliament Presidium, the upper 
house in the 300-seat bicameral national assembly. Presidium members are chosen 
by the lower house in proportion to the popular vote for each party in the 
lower chamber. Legislators in the lower chamber, the House of the People, voted 
117 to 86 to replace him, the state news agency CTK reported. Mohorita will 
remain a deputy in the lower house. CTK did not say who would replace him in 
the Presidium.

Egypt reopened the third and smallest pyramid of Giza today after 18 months of

intensive efforts to expand the famous site to tourism.

<P>
Eventually, Minister of Culture Farouk Hosni hopes to build a huge museum 
complex at Giza to house the extensive collection of ancient artifacts now 
crammed into the elegant but aging national Egyptian Antiquities Museum in 
Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
The third pyramid of Giza was the last of the great pyramids to be built on the 
desert plateau outside of Cairo and the last of the three to be renovated. The 
204-foot-high structure was built as the tomb of the ancient king Menkaure, 
called Mycerinus by the Greeks, around 2620 BC.

Ashland Oil today reported that a strong fourth quarter from its oil group 
resulted in the company having its second-best year ever. 
</P>
<P>
In its fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, Ashland said it had earnings of $59 
million on revenues of $2.5 billion, compared to a net loss of $39 million on 
revenues of $2.3 billion in last year's quarter. 
</P>
<P>
For its fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the Ashland, Ky.-based company had net 
income of $182 million on sales of $9 billion, compared to net income of $86 
million on sales of $8.5 billion in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"These excellent results were due primarily to a strong performance by Ashland 
Petroleum Co., improved results from APAC construction operations and Ashland 
Exploration, and higher equity income from Arch Mineral Corp. and Ashland Coal 
Inc.," John R. Hall, Ashland chairman and chief executive officer, said.

</P>
<P>
Prices have risen more than 40 cents a gallon since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait 
on Aug. 2, according to the biweekly Lundberg Survey of 13,500 gas stations. 
</P>
<P>
The dealers' margin stands at about 11 cents a gallon, down 2 cents a gallon 
from before the Middle East crisis, analyst Trilby Lundberg said.

<P>
Stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange surged today as momentum from last 
week's rally boosted the market 2.4%. 
</P>
<P>
The key Nikkei Average of 225 selective issues, which surged 2,091.33 points 
last week including 114.41 points Friday, climbed 589.35 points, or 2.4%, to 
25,070.86. 
</P>
<P>
Volume continued to be stronger than the average of the past several months. An 
estimated 600 million shares changed hands, compared to 1.08 billion shares 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Advances topped declines 886 to 133, while 96 issues remained unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said lower oil prices and talk of an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait drew 
in large financial institutions, which had trailed behind the rally last week. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign investors continued to pump funds into the market, they 
said.

The Soviet Union's declining oil output will show another drop in 1991, a 
senior government official said in an interview published today. 
</P>
<P>
Old-fashioned equipment and supply problems are increasingly hampering the oil 
industry in the Soviet Union, the world's largest producer of crude oil, at a 
time when prices are high. 
</P>
<P>
Artem Troitsky, state planning commission deputy chairman, told the Communist 
Party daily Pravda that only massive amounts of new investment in the oil 
industry could avert continuing production declines. 
</P>
<P>
Official figures released Friday showed Soviet oil production dropped 3.35 
million barrels to 61.85 million barrels in the first nine months of 1990, 
compared to the year-ago period.

Mike Tyson reached an out-of-court settlement with a parking attendant who 
claimed that the boxing champion punched him when he refused to let Tyson's 
white Mercedes-Benz park in a particular spot. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Devine, 35, said the terms of the settlement reached Friday prevent him 
from disclosing how much money he received. 
</P>
<P>
But it was less than the $250,000 he was seeking, he said, and too small to 
make up for his suffering. 
</P>
<P>
"It was lousy, lousy," Devine said Saturday. "The settlement was a lousy amount 
for all the trauma I've been through. I'm not fussy when it comes to money, but 
that was lousy." 
</P>
<P>
Devine said Tyson hit him three times in the stomach with the back of his hand. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney declined to prosecute Tyson on misdemeanor assault charges, 
saying there was not enough evidence for a conviction. Tyson has denied hitting 
Devine.

Former actor Fred Grandy, now a Republican representing Iowa in the U.S. House 
of Representatives, said today that the National Endowment for the Arts is 
being "held hostage by some extremist groups." 
</P>
<P>
Grandy, who appeared in the TV series "The Love Boat," said it is "ridiculous" 
that Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) is blocking passage of the NEA reauthorization 
bill on censorship in the arts. 
</P>
<P>
He said Helms will "be opposed by members of his own party in the Senate." 
</P>
<P>
Helms added language to the NEA appropriation bill that prohibits funding works 
that depict a variety of named sexual activities and are deemed to have no 
redeeming social value. 
</P>
<P>
Grant recipients would be required to declare that they would comply with the 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Grandy was interviewed on the "Fox Morning News."

NEA'S CHIEF REJECTS GRANT TO BOSTON MUSEUM; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS: AN AWARD IS DENIED FOR AN EXHIBIT WITH SEXUAL THEMES BY A LOS ANGELES 
ARTIST, DESPITE APPROVAL BY A PEER REVIEW PANEL.

<P>
The chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts has rejected a $40,000 
grant to support an exhibit at a Boston museum by an artist whose work includes 
sexual themes, a museum official said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Institute of Contemporary Art received formal notification last week that 
NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer had rejected the grant, which had been 
recommended for approval by a review committee, said Arthur Cohen, the 
institute's marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
The money was earmarked for an exhibition by Mike Kelley, a mixed-media artist 
from Los Angeles, museum officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is almost unprecedented in the history of the NEA that an application for a 
gallery is approved by a peer review panel and then gets rejected by the 
director," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
The art institute's director, David A. Ross, said Kelley's work "deals with 
serious and critical issues in our culture, some of which deal with the 
pathology of our times, some of which deal with the body and references to 
sexuality and sociology, some of which deal with nationality and nationalism, 
some of which deal with madness and particular forms of modern schizophrenic 
behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Ross said it is unlikely that Frohnmayer will reverse his decision. He said he 
did not know why the director objected to Kelley's exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Frohnmayer rejected four other grants that had been 
recommended by review panels. Those grants were to individual artists involved 
in controversial works, not a museum or gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that about two-thirds of all applications submitted to the NEA are 
rejected by the peer panels and that the artists approved for grants are 
heavily scrutinized. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a show about a very important artist," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
The NEA controversy began last year when Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and other 
conservatives in Congress objected to NEA funding of works by photographer 
Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano. 
</P>
<P>
"They start with the easiest things first -- photography and performance, where 
there is less of a historical precedent -- and then they get down to censorship 
of other kinds of work," Kelley told the Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
The peer panel recommended the $40,000 grant after reviewing the Institute of 
Contemporary Art's application for $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Kelley exhibit was scheduled to originate in Boston and tour other museums 
across the nation and in Europe. "We're going to do the show no matter what," 
said curator Elizabeth Sussman.

Action star Steven Seagal again stood his ground at the box office, as his 
action-thriller "Marked for Death" took the No. 1 spot for the third 
consecutive week. 
</P>
<P>
With ticket sales of approximately $5.1 million, the 20th Century Fox film has 
grossed more than $28 million. 
</P>
<P>
Second place went to Warner Bros.' World War II drama "Memphis Belle," which 
had ticket sales of about $4.3 million in its second week -- a drop of only 14% 
from its premiere weekend. Based on a true story about a celebrated bomber 
crew, "Memphis Belle" has grossed about $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
In third place, with ticket sales of about $3.8 million, was MGM/UA's just-out 
"Quigley Down Under," starring Tom Selleck as a sharpshooter in 1860s 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount Pictures' "Ghost" materialized in fourth place, with receipts of 
about $3.6 million. Walt Disney Pictures' "Fantasia" was fifth with ticket 
sales of about $2.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
In its premiere weekend, Columbia Pictures' "Night of the Living Dead" -- the 
George Romero-produced remake of his 1968 shocker -- scared up ticket sales of 
about $2.8 million for sixth place. 
</P>
<P>
Tri-Star Pictures' "Avalon," which had previously been in limited release at a 
handful of theaters, widened to about 630 screens to earn approximately $2.8 
million for seventh place. 
</P>
<P>
Eighth place went to Warner Bros.' gangster saga, "GoodFellas," which had 
receipts of about $2.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
In ninth place, following its debut weekend (in which it ranked seventh) was 
Touchstone Pictures' "Mr. Destiny," which earned about $2.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Fox's Yuppie thriller "Pacific Heights" was 10th, with receipts of about $2.4 
million.

LIZ SMITH: CELEBRITIES CONTINUE TO BE THE MAIN ACT AT LE CIRQUE

NEW YORK'S Le Cirque shows no sign of the impending recession. For two days 
last week, Le Cirque provided not only bread (fine French bread) but sent in 
the clowns and stars so all three rings could continue for celebrity-watchers. 
</P>
<P>
One night, Johnny and Alex Carson came in to dine. They found the former Mrs. 
Carson, the beautiful brunette Joanna, on the premises. Johnny went to Joanna's 
table and gave her a sweet kiss. 
</P>
<P>
This is the woman he has made thousands of finance-divorce-alimony jokes about 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
The next noon, Marla Maples was the cynosure of all eyes, sitting at a table 
against the back wall with TV producer Gary Pudney, her press agent, Chuck 
Jones, and her mother, Ann Ogletree. 
</P>
<P>
Pudney, whom I've known since he was in knee pants, came over to ask me to meet 
Marla. 
</P>
<P>
We had a brief but cordial chat, and I told Mrs. Ogletree what everyone in Le 
Cirque was saying about her -- that she must be "a plant" since she looked too 
young to be anyone's mama. 
</P>
<P>
Marla chirped up that her mother "has never had any plastic surgery." (Well, 
some of us aren't as lucky as others.) 
</P>
<P>
PRODUCER PUDNEY has known Marla for three years, since back when he was still 
the Veep in charge of ABC talent and specials. 
</P>
<P>
He says, "She impressed our casting department and was screen-tested to very 
positive response." 
</P>
<P>
Now Pudney's company, Paradigm Entertainment, wants to put Marla into a TV 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
Gary says Marla will seek "supporting comic or dramatic roles and continue 
studying acting. She realizes she must spend more time in Los Angeles where 
most of the TV opportunities are. 
</P>
<P>
"She is a terrific girl, devoted to her family, and I am very fond of her. I 
hope to help her achieve her goals." 
</P>
<P>
This was Marla's first visit to Le Cirque, a spot often frequented by Ivana 
Trump. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Sirio Macchioni sent Marla four different desserts to try. 
</P>
<P>
And, nearby, it is said man-about-town Dennis Stein and the world-famous, 
world-class actor Sidney Poitier, lunching together, changed tables to get a 
better look at Marla.

the maternity ward while your secretary is pounding it out and you're hoping 
the messenger gets there on time." 
</P>
<P>
Smaller court clerks' offices across the state receive documents directly on 
their own fax machines. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the most clogged court system in the state with more than 
10,000 documents filed daily in Los Angeles County Superior Court alone, the 
clerk's office is not equipped to receive a flood of fax transmissions. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Fax Court Filings Inc., a company formed by 30 attorney service firms 
in the area, accepts fax transmissions of documents to its office, then walks 
them over to the Los Angeles County Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Estin, president of Fax Court Filings Inc., said fax filings have saved 
attorneys from missing the statutory deadline for suing. In one case, he said, 
a lawyer faxed a petition for a stay of execution. 
</P>
<P>
"The realities of filing documents in metropolitan areas of California are 
traffic and parking," he said. "It's often difficult to get a document to the 
court by the filing deadline." 
</P>
<P>
Fax filings must meet specific requirements, including the type of paper used. 
Fax Court Filings receives the documents on 20 laser printing fax machines 
using bond paper instead of the slippery thermal stuff. 
</P>
<P>
The filing of certain documents such as wills and codicils by fax is 
prohibited. Otherwise, signatures on faxed documents generally are acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the experiment, the Legislature will decide whether to make the 
program permanent. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota was the first to try fax machines in such a way, and after a yearlong 
experiment machines were ordered installed in all state courts. 
</P>
<P>
Other states that have fax transmission in at least some courts include 
Colorado, Idaho, Florida, Nevada, New York, Oregon and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Nevarez, former lobbyist for the California State Bar, said faxing was 
seen as a way to save clients and lawyers money by eliminating messengers. He 
said the only opposition came from process servers who feared losing business. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Zolin, Los Angeles County clerk and executive officer of the Superior 
Court, said services such as Estin's are working well but that less than 1% of 
documents are being filed by fax. 
</P>
<P>
"People are slow to adapt to change," Zolin said. "I see it as a real 
convenience. But it's not a revolutionary change. It's mainly a convenience to 
the litigants and attorneys." 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, Zolin said, judges and lawyers will continue to demand original 
documents. But he said the fax is a boon for out-of-state firms. 
</P>
<P>
Estin, whose service was launched in June, said business has been slow but that 
"in five years, everybody's going to be doing it."
