I am retired, after 30 years in the auto industry as a salesman, general 
manager, dealer and auto trade association manager. 
</P>
<P>
Criticism runs high against the salesman and dealer, but how about dishonest 
customers? Many times I have seen cars traded in with bald-headed tires, 
switched after the car was appraised with good tires; spare wheels missing, 
radios taken out and cheap batteries replacing new ones; heavy oil in engines 
to cut out noise -- just to mention a few. 
</P>
<P>
Customers also lie about car condition, their credit and the competition's 
prices. They get the best cash price and then expect retail for their car. 
</P>
<P>
Then they forget all the good things done for them by a dealer when they get 
ready to trade -- will drive a hundred miles to save $50, then expect the local 
dealer to give them service under warranty. I had one expect me to buy 
white-wall tires off his car, purchased from another dealer, because he had a 
set in his garage.

REMEMBERING BETTE DAVIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My acquaintance with her started almost 50 years ago, on her stopover in 
Chicago while en route from Hollywood to New York. As a young press agent in my 
20s, working for Warner Bros. Pictures, I introduced her to the Chicago press 
and theater owners. An exciting day it was, for even at that early stage of her 
career, she was an outstanding actress, a brilliant conversationalist who 
enchanted those who met her. 
</P>
<P>
My association with her continued at Warner Bros. studios after World War II on 
such outstanding pictures as "Watch On the Rhine," "Mr. Skeffington," "The Corn 
Is Green," "Deception" and others. At that time I was in charge of the photo 
department. What particularly stands out in my memory over the years is that 
the working crew of whatever picture she was making always held her in awe and 
regarded her as the "queen." 
</P>
<P>
Bette Davis has departed from this earth and is now a bright star among the 
brightest of stars.

I read your article about car salesmen with great interest. The "victory" 
stories of these successful car salesmen in Los Angeles are most enlightening. 
Few consumers realize the salesman's determination in profit-taking. By 
complicating the car-buying experience, these verbal "bait and switch" sellers 
are assured "easy" money. 
</P>
<P>
It is most entertaining for me to expose the seller's trade secrets over radio 
and television. 
</P>
<P>
The public opinion of car salesmen is a strong one. Theirs are considered the 
least trusted of professions. Recent news indicates car salesmen have risen to 
tie with the second least trusted profession -- lawyers. This landmark 
improvement in public opinion, reminds one of the Big Three's car-quality 
successes in recent years.

</P>
<P>
HONG KONG: A 'SAFETY NET' OF VISAS WON'T COVER THOSE WHO WILL STAY BEHIND. 
PRESERVING A STRONG ECONOMY WILL HELP.

The local geomancers insisted that a small willow be planted in the grassy lawn 
behind the governor's residence in downtown Hong Kong last year to protect it 
from the knife-edge of the new Bank of China building rising a thousand feet 
high just down the hill, slashing like a sword at the residence's center. The 
willow is growing well but its magic has faltered. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, it seemed promising that reforms in China and a spirited 
give-and-take between Beijing and the Hong Kong Chinese might produce agreement 
on the "basic law" to guide an autonomous Hong Kong after 1997. By early 1989, 
the Chinese had improved sections on human rights and judicial review. Further 
revisions seemed attainable. 
</P>
<P>
Then came June in Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the people in Hong Kong, this event convinced them that for the 
foreseeable future, Beijing is not likely to accept any behavior that it 
perceives as damaging to China's vital interests. Those who believe that Hong 
Kong can still survive and grow -- even under the present harsh Chinese 
leadership -- say it can be pulled off only if the territory isolates itself 
from political movements on the mainland. Many in Hong Kong are not willing to 
pay that price. 
</P>
<P>
Young professional and business elites with an eye to the future are leaving -- 
55,000 to 60,000 this year, up nearly 50% from 1988. This outflow cannot rise 
much more, however, and could shrink if employment demand in Australia and 
Canada (destinations for 60% of emigrants) declines. There are 3.2 million Hong 
Kong citizens with some claim on British nationality. Political opposition at 
home has kept Britain from issuing passports that would give this group the 
eventual right to reside in England, thus providing the real reassurance that 
they need not flee Hong Kong quickly. International pressure may force Downing 
Street to back down, but probably not for more than 50,000 to 100,000 
passports. 
</P>
<P>
What should America do? Congressional proposals merely ask the President to 
convey to Beijing our government's concern about democracy and the colony's 
future. Some members want to go much further, linking future Sino-U.S. 
relations explicitly to Beijing's respect for human rights and democracy in 
Hong Kong. The Administration will not easily be persuaded to handcuff its 
China policy irrevocably to Hong Kong. There is also bipartisan support for 
calling an international conference to "express concern" about Hong Kong, exert 
pressure on Beijing and offer strong assurances to local citizens of a "safety 
net" -- promises of British passports or visas from America, Canada, Australia 
and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
The reality is that the more the United States and others actively encourage 
emigration, the more we risk eroding the Hong Kong economy and long-term 
prospects for the territory. No "safety net" is likely to cover much more than 
a million of the nearly 6 million Hong Kong Chinese. The strongest protection 
for those who do not or cannot leave will be a strong and vital Hong Kong 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong citizens are divided over whether intensified international focus 
will help or hurt the colony. There is a big risk of forcing the Chinese hand, 
intensifying the confrontation. But others argue that Beijing must be warned of 
paying a stiff cost internationally if it leans too heavily on the territory. 
Those who are single-mindedly committed to a change in the character of the 
regime go further and welcome any pressures that focus opprobrium on China, 
regardless of the impact on Hong Kong itself. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps at some point in the 1990s a stronger American posture on Hong Kong may 
be needed. American officials must continue to make private expressions of 
concern to the Chinese. So must the major international banks and other 
corporations doing business in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
But at this time, a high profile on the part of Washington is more likely to 
weaken confidence, increase business uncertainty and accelerate emigration. By 
arousing unrealistic expectations of U.S. policy toward future Hong Kong 
"refu-gees," Washington would be further aggravating Sino-U.S. relations. And 
all this in turn would damage the delicate position of officials in those 
Chinese coastal provinces who are most committed to long-term reform in China 
itself and to working cooperatively with Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Not every problem has or needs an American solution. Hong Kong is one of these.

THE 'PROBLEM' TURNS OUT TO BE THE SOLUTION; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: UNDER ATTACK AND UNDERFUNDED, OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS PROVIDED THE 
HEROICS AFTER THE BAY AREA QUAKE.

<P>
Responding to criticism of the Deukmejian Administration's earthquake 
preparedness policies, the governor's press secretary said it was "shameful" to 
talk politics in a time of disaster. 
</P>
<P>
But politics is central when the public sector is put so rigorously to the 
test. What is shameful has been the long-term, unrelenting ideological attack 
on the very public institutions on which our health and prosperity so clearly 
depend. 
</P>
<P>
That dependence was never more obvious than last week in Northern California. 
The test of our government went beyond the obvious emergency responses such as 
police and fire. Transit was particularly heroic. The Bay Area Rapid Transit 
District quickly became the vital heart of the transportation system, while 
buses and ferries rescued the stranded and geared up for a commuter crunch. 
Transit systems that have long been criticized instead turn out to be critical 
to our economy in the light of bridge and highway collapses. The usually 
invisible corps of building inspectors, public-works engineers and 
water-district workers was also out in force struggling with broken buildings, 
roads, sewers and water mains. And, of course, the disasters on the highways 
put the state Department of Transportation at center stage. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of years of austerity, Northern California's public sector has 
performed well so far -- with the exception of highways. California's 
progressive-era legacy of a relatively competent, reasonably paid and generally 
honest government has not been lost; those building inspectors, bus drivers and 
highway maintenance workers we like to complain about turn out to be vital to 
our safety. In New York, a freeway collapse would have stemmed from a 
contracting scandal. Here, the scandal is ideological -- an anti-tax, 
anti-government ideology that has denied adequate funding for vital public 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
For 11 years since Proposition 13 generated a political earthquake and slashed 
public funding, California conservatives have maligned government as "the 
problem, not the solution." Local government in particular has borne the brunt 
of spending cuts. Fortunately, the locals have muddled through. Where would 
Northern California be now without a relatively effective, honest and competent 
set of public institutions? The private and nonprofit sectors certainly pitched 
in, but the heaviest responsibilities fall on the mayors, supervisors and city 
and county managers. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush promoted another version of the same false ideology by stating, 
before even setting foot in California, "Thank God for the volunteers." 
Actually, thank God (or progressive Bay Area citizens) that a government that 
has been attacked for years is competent enough to utilize those volunteers 
while responding to a myriad of problems. Nor does Sen. Pete Wilson seem to 
understand when he proclaims the problem of the collapsed Nimitz Freeway to be 
technological, not fiscal: If he wants to be governor, he better learn that 
having the right technology is useless unless you're willing to pay to put it 
in place. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, California voters will soon have the opportunity to shed two of 
the legacies of the anti-government ideology that have compounded the problems 
of the quake. One is the state spending limit, which in its absurd current form 
requires that emergency spending incurred beyond the limit be paid back by 
service cuts in future years, effectively denying real spending increases even 
for emergencies. The other is a low gas tax that places California 50th among 
states in our highway funding effort, making sure that freeway safety, among 
other needs, receives short shrift. 
</P>
<P>
A measure heading for the June ballot corrects the inflexible and outdated 
spending limit, including its harmful emergency provisions, while permitting a 
gas-tax increase. The Legislature and governor knew that this increase was 
necessary, but the spending limit did not permit it. Now, in a special session, 
the Legislature should enact a temporary emergency increase in the gas tax to 
resolve the immediate uncertainty in highway funding. Not incidentally, such an 
action will improve the chance of passage of the measure concerning the 
spending limit by giving voters the opportunity to ratify a gas tax already in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, the quake should provide the occasion for a reaffirmation of the 
traditional California relationship between healthy public and healthy private 
sectors. Our health and prosperity depend on public investment and private 
investment taken together, but the public side of the equation has been ignored 
for too long. That's obvious when a bridge and highway go down and no one can 
get to work. It's less obvious when our human and physical infrastructure decay 
slowly, but it's no less true. The adequacy of our underfinanced local 
institutions will be sorely taxed in coming months. We might even consider 
giving them some more resources to work with.

EVOLUTION: ATTEMPTS TO DRESS UP BIBLICAL CREATIONISM AS "CREATION SCIENCE" DO 
NOT CIRCUMVENT A BASIC PRINCIPLE.

<P>
People across America who care about the quality of our children's education 
are waiting to see how California resolves the "Great Scopes Monkey 
Controversy" of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
By early November, the state Board of Education will decide on new science 
textbook guidelines, amid a mounting clamor from religious-right 
fundamentalists still intent on forcing the inclusion of biblical creationist 
beliefs into science teaching. The board's public hearings on Wednesday 
represent the anti-evolution forces' major opportunity to twist the outcome in 
their favor. 
</P>
<P>
The creationists are threatening one of America's most cherished values -- our 
shared belief that, whatever our private religious faith, the public schools 
should not be used to promote sectarian religious doctrine. Transparent 
attempts to dress up biblical creationism as "creation science" and parade it 
as a "rival scientific theory" to evolution do not circumvent this basic 
principle. Science is science, and faith is faith -- a crucial distinction that 
has been repeatedly underscored by the courts. Blurring this line would ill 
serve our children and our Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Yet extremist groups are on the march across America to do just that, using 
such tactics in other states as promoting legislation and influencing school 
board races. Leading the charge is a group calling itself the Citizens for 
Excellence in Education, the activist arm of the right-wing National Assn. of 
Christian Educators based in Costa Mesa. The group, along with the California 
Traditional Values Coalition, has spearheaded the California challenge. 
</P>
<P>
If the anti-evolution campaign wins even a partial victory in California, the 
reverberations will be felt around the nation. California and Texas dominate 
the textbook market, together accounting for more than 20% of total national 
sales. Books developed for use in California and Texas schools are often sold 
without modifications to the rest of the nation. Quite simply, the outcome of 
California's creationism controversy will help setthe standards for America's 
science instruction well into the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, California's education leadership has held firm. But the pressure is 
mounting. Last January, when the Board of Education drew a clear line between 
science instruction and religious teaching, the Traditional Values Coalition 
labeled their verdict a "gag order." 
</P>
<P>
When the science committee of the California Curriculum Commission reaffirmed 
this decision in July, fundamentalists stepped up their rhetoric. "If it's war 
they want, it's war they're going to get," warned the Rev. Louis Sheldon, 
chairman of the coalition. Robert Simonds, president of Citizens for Excellence 
in Education, threatened that "all hell's going to break loose" if the 
creationists don't get their way this fall. 
</P>
<P>
When the curriculum commission finally adopted a pro-evolution science 
framework at the end of September, the creationists lashed out again. With 
backward logic, Sheldon claimed that unless "credible competing views" are 
included in science teaching, "textbooks will present evolution dogmatically." 
It would certainly be news to Charles Darwin and legions of biologists who have 
tested this theory for more than 100 years that evolution is dogma. 
</P>
<P>
Alarmingly, the board has recently been sending signals that it may be backing 
away from its pro-evolution stance. A letter from the board to the curriculum 
commission faulted that panel's evolution discussion as "too defensive." 
</P>
<P>
Educators and mainstream religious leaders have been speaking up strongly in 
defense of evolution. Seven major educational and science organizations 
recently sent a joint letter urging the board to accept the pro-evolution 
guidelines. The Rev. Bruce Lundberg, a Lutheran bishop's associate from 
Sacramento, testified in earlier hearings that he believes "most of mainline 
Christendom" accepts evolution as the explanation of life's origins. "I . . . 
considered this to be a subject that was closed a long time ago," Lundberg 
remarked. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Education can finally close the subject at a hearing on Wednesday 
and in its vote Nov. 9. Members should endorse the excellent guidelines before 
them. Then schools in California -- and across the nation -- can get on with 
the job of imparting scientific knowledge that the next generation must have if 
our nation is to remain competitive.

FOSSILIZATION OF DARWIN'S PET;

EVOLUTION: SURELY THE CURRICULUM COMMISSION IS AWARE THAT MORE SCIENTISTS ARE 
OPENLY CRITICAL HIS THEORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's very odd that the California Curriculum Commission has voted to recommend 
to the state Board of Education that evolution be taught as uncontested fact -- 
just when more scientists than ever before are contesting it. 
</P>
<P>
By claiming that "there is no scientific dispute that evolution has occurred 
and continues to occur," the members of the curriculum commission are showing 
remarkable ignorance. Surely they can't be unaware that more and more 
scientists are openly critical of Darwinism. 
</P>
<P>
One among many is Australian biologist and agnostic Michael Denton, who claims 
that not one single discovery since 1859, when Charles Darwin published "On the 
Origin of Species," has supported Darwin's theory. Denton calls evolution "the 
great cosmogenic myth of the 20th Century." 
</P>
<P>
Where were the members of the commission in 1981 when Colin Patterson, senior 
paleontologist for the British Museum of Natural History, told biologists at 
the American Museum of Natural History in New York that belief in evolution is 
as much a commitment of faith as is belief in creation? 
</P>
<P>
"I woke up and realized that all my life I had been duped into taking 
evolutionism as revealed truth in some way," Patterson told his colleagues. He 
said that no real transitional forms have ever been found anywhere in the 
fossil record and "I don't think we shall ever have any access to any form of 
(evolutionary) tree which we can call factual." 
</P>
<P>
He challenged other scientists to tell him one thing they knew for sure about 
evolution. "I tried it on the members of the Evolutionary Morphology Seminar in 
the University of Chicago, a very prestigious body of evolutionists, and all I 
got there was silence for a very long time and eventually one person said, 'I 
do know one thing -- it ought not to be taught in high school.' " 
</P>
<P>
Still, the members of the curriculum commission are apparently so rigidly 
committed to the dogma of evolution that they are insisting that it be taught 
to the next generation anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the commission members have not read Denton's book, "Evolution: A 
Theory in Crisis." In it, he asks, "Is it really credible that random processes 
could have constructed a reality, the smallest element of which -- a functional 
protein or gene -- is complex beyond our own creative capacities, a reality 
which is the very antithesis of chance, which excels in every sense anything 
produced by the intelligence of man." 
</P>
<P>
The commission must have missed the comment by Murray Eden, professor emeritus 
at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, that Denton's book "should be made 
required reading for everyone who believes what he was taught in college about 
evolution." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe they have not read "The Mystery of Life's Origins: Reassessing Current 
Theories," by Charles B. Thaxton, Walter Bradley and Roger Olsen, former 
evolutionists with doctorates in chemistry, geochemistry and materials science, 
which concludes that a "creator beyond the cosmos" is the most plausible 
explanation for life's origin. 
</P>
<P>
Where has the curriculum commission been? Are the members blind and deaf to 
what is happening in the scientific community? Are they determined to maintain 
the status quo regardless of the facts, determined to make evolution true by a 
show of hands? Or, more likely, are they afraid of the theories that may have 
to be seriously considered if evolution doesn't have center stage? 
</P>
<P>
What if the best explanation for the data turns out to include a supernatural 
origin? Aren't we big enough to handle the possibility that truth may not fit 
within our pre-conceived and arbitrary naturalistic confines? 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the history of science, the most danger has come not from outside, 
from non-scientific theories, but from within, from the fossilization of 
attitude. As soon as science says, "our pet theory doesn't work, but we're 
going to advocate it anyway," or "well, the data may indicate we go in a new 
direction, but we refuse to because it may lead to something we don't like," 
then truth has been irreparably compromised. 
</P>
<P>
What the curriculum commission has done seems to confirm what evolutionist Dean 
Kenyon of San Francisco State University wrote after reading "The Mystery of 
Life's Origins," that many scientists hesitate to admit or study the theory's 
problems because they "would open the door to the possibility (or the 
necessity) of a supernatural origin of life." 
</P>
<P>
And we couldn't have that, could we?

AMC Entertainment Inc.: The movie theater chain posted a record profit of $7.3 
million, contrasted with a net loss of $3.3 million a year ago. Revenue for the 
Kansas City, Mo.-based company totaled $135 million, about the same as a year 
ago. Record summer box office results, combined with reduced debt and improved 
margins were credited for record profit, while revenue was affected by the sale 
of 375 theater screens to TPI Entertainment and the sale of AMC's United 
Kingdom operation. The TPIE theaters continue to be operated by AMC for a fee.

Bankers Trust: The banking company lost $1.42 billion in the third quarter, 
contrasted with net income of $162.1 million in the 1988 quarter. The loss 
resulted from the New York-based firm's $1.63-billion provision for credit 
losses related to refinancing outstanding foreign loans. Without that, 
third-quarter income would have improved 11% to $180 million. The special 
provision aside, the results benefited from increased non-interest revenue and 
a lower effective tax rate although these factors were partially offset by 
increased noninterest expenses and the provision for credit losses other than 
the special provision.

Capital Cities/ABC Inc.: The New York-based media company reported 
third-quarter profit of $80.8 million, an increase of 29% over a year ago. 
Revenue totaled $1.1 billion, up 9%, with the broadcasting operations recording 
an 11% gain in revenue. Stronger advertising demand was credited for the 
improvement. Results also reflect reductions in entertainment programming and 
sports rights at the ABC Television Network from historic costs to fair-market 
values recorded in connection with ABC's acquisition.

The stock market declined broadly in sluggish trading, showing no carry-over of 
the sharp rally that it staged last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, which had gained a record 119.88 points 
last week, dropped back 26.23 to 2,662.91. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 2 to 1 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 501 up, 1,012 down and 458 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume came to 135.86 million shares, down from 164.83 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said traders were expecting more evidence in the next several days of 
sluggish growth in the economy, perhaps setting the stage for lower interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
But many observers on the Street have also voiced increasing concern lately 
over what that prospect means for corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Jensen of MKI Securities said investors bought consumer issues likely 
to weather an economic downturn and sold stocks in industries prone to earnings 
disappointments during a downturn. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips Petroleum fell 1 1/8 to 23 1/8 following the news of explosions and 
fire at a Phillips plastics plant near the Houston Ship Channel in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Pinnacle West, the most active NYSE issue, dropped 1 5/8 to 9 1/8. The company 
said it might consider filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection if it can't 
work out a plan with regulators to help out its troubled Merabank subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo stock market rallied for the fifth straight day, buoyed by a stable 
Japanese yen and a recently steady Wall Street. The 225-share Nikkei index rose 
99.14 points to close at 35,585.52. Winners led losers by 7 to 5 on light 
volume of 600 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices remained firm on the London Stock Exchange in exceptionally quiet 
trading with many traders sidelined ahead of today's release of British trade 
data for September. The Financial Times 100-share index closed up 10.6 points 
at 2189.7.

Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices rose in tandem with the stock market's decline, following a pattern 
established in the Friday the 13th stock market tumble. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury bond prices rose about 1/2 point and the Dow fell 26 points. That was 
a faint echo of Oct. 13, when bonds rose 4 points and the Dow index fell about 
190 points. 
</P>
<P>
The late afternoon sag on Wall Street was the only big news in the bond market, 
which had been flat to slightly higher in light dealings for most of the 
session. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the day the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was up 9/16 point, 
or about $5.60 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which falls when prices rise, 
was at 7.93%, down from 7.98% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
were up 1/8 point to 1/4 point, intermediate maturities gained almost 1/2 point 
and long-term issues gained slightly more than 1/2 point, according to Telerate 
Inc., the financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, was up 3.44 to 1,191.07.

<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8.875%, down from 8.688% late Friday.

<P>
Amgen, a Thousand Oaks-based biotechnology firm that makes pharmaceutical 
products, reported that its net income surged to $3.9 million in the fiscal 
second quarter that ended September 30, more than 12 times the $320,000 in net 
income a year earlier. Revenue doubled to $42.5 million from $21.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Blinder, Amgen's chief executive officer, said the strong third quarter 
results reflected rising demand for the company's drug for treating anemia in 
kidney dialysis patients. The drug, Epogen, received licensing in June and has 
been purchased by 95% of the dialysis centers in the country, Blinder said. 
</P>
<P>
In the six months that ended in September, Amgen earned $4.7 million, more than 
seven times the $625,000 in net income a year earlier. Revenues totaled $72.6 
million, a 77% gain from $41 million.

Prince Charles, who banned aerosol sprays from his household out of concern for 
the ozone layer, will write and present a TV documentary on environmental 
threats, the British Broadcasting Corp. said Monday. On the 60-minute program, 
the heir to the throne is expected to focus on global issues such as the 
destruction of rain forests and the ozone layer, the high layer of the 
atmosphere that shields the Earth from most of the sun's ultraviolet radiation. 
Chemicals used in aerosol sprays are believed to be depleting the ozone layer. 
The BBC said the prince will tell viewers: "It has become apparent to me that 
we need to develop a new vision of the Earth and of the role we human beings 
have as stewards of the Earth." The program is to be broadcast in May as part 
of a weeklong collaboration between European stations to report on world 
problems. ALEENE MacMINN

SAN DIEGO CENTER TO MONITOR SKIES OVER SOUTHLAND

In an effort to make the Southern California skies safer, federal aviation 
officials announced Monday that they will use Miramar Naval Air Station in San 
Diego as the location for a radar approach center for air traffic control, 
consolidating four facilities in Los Angeles, Burbank, Ontario and El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
The new 100,000-square-foot center, which will be built on Navy land, will 
direct air traffic in a 30,000-square-mile area from Ontario to Santa Catalina 
and Burbank to Oceanside. The planned facility will monitor about 2 million 
flights annually, at altitudes up to 13,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, controllers and pilots were generally receptive to the 
consolidation plan at Miramar. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Terminal Radar Approach Control, or TRACON, at El Toro has drawn 
heavy criticism from controllers and congressional investigators in recent 
years because of its antiquated radar and computer equipment. In addition, 
Federal Aviation Administration officials say the building doesn't meet 
earthquake standards. 
</P>
<P>
Coast controllers also have complained of chronic understaffing. The facility 
is currently staffed with 60 controllers when it is allotted a total of 78, 
said a controller there. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's existing TRACON at Miramar will remain separate, though it may be 
combined with the proposed Southern California facility after 1995, said FAA 
spokeswoman Elly Brekke. 
</P>
<P>
"You now have four facilities that separately control airspace in the L.A. 
Basin -- now we're going to have one facility. When you manage a single 
facility you have much better control and that will enhance safety," Jerry 
Chavkin, the FAA Western-Pacific regional administrator, said. 
</P>
<P>
The radar center, expected to cost $114 million and open in late 1993, will use 
a new telecommunications system as well as equipment from the other four 
facilities, Chavkin said. There will be no immediate increase in the number of 
air traffic controllers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the current system, a pilot might be in touch with several TRACON 
controllers in approaching an airport in the Los Angeles Basin. At the airport 
in Torrance, one-half of the airspace is controlled by the Los Angeles TRACON, 
the rest by the TRACON at El Toro, Chavkin said. Under the new system, the 
pilot would speak only with the Southern Californian TRACON at Miramar. 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board, some pilots and air traffic 
controllers have criticized the FAA for inadequate controller staffing and poor 
equipment in Southern California TRACONs. Several say these conditions have 
contributed to several near-misses. On Feb. 13, for example, a British Airways 
Boeing 747 carrying 286 passengers came within two miles of an American 
Airlines jet with 70 aboard. FAA rules require three miles of horizontal 
separation. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems foolhardy that they would go build a new installation and not stock 
it with more staffers and top quality equipment," said Richard D. Russell, a 
pilot and the regional air safety coordinator with the Airline Pilots 
Association in Los Angeles. "Unless they can staff it with an adequate number 
of controllers, they're not going to be able to handle the traffic. They 
certainly cannot handle it right now." 
</P>
<P>
Southern California skies are among the most congested in the United States. 
Orange County has 12,200 licensed commercial and general aviation pilots; Los 
Angeles County has 27,000. In 1988, there were 533,484 takeoffs and landings at 
John Wayne Airport in Orange County and 623,519 at Los Angeles International 
Airport. John Wayne Airport handles a heavy amount of general aviation traffic, 
while LAX handles almost all commercial traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Chavkin with the FAA says he is confident the existing facilities can handle 
the current air traffic using their current equipment and that they will 
continue to do so until the San Diego center opens. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego site was chosen after a yearlong search during which proposals 
were solicited from 21 airports and military bases in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles TRACON employees will be among the first to move to the new 
facility, which eventually will house about 400 controllers, technicians and 
other personnel, she said. 
</P>
<P>
At Miramar, the reaction to the new center was muted. 
</P>
<P>
"No agreement has been made," said Chief Bobbie Carlton. "The next step is for 
them to come to Miramar with a shopping list of what they would like to do." 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Mike Desrosiers, a Coast TRACON controller for the past eight 
years, said there will be better equipment and newer facilities than what he 
and about 60 other controllers have had in El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
Desrosiers said that working in one big radar center would not affect the way 
controllers handle airspace throughout the Southland. Jay Gassner, a flight 
instructor for Martin Aviation at John Wayne Airport, is not concerned with the 
controllers' location. 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is to have the airspace covered and to have enough guys 
covering the (radar) screens," Gassner said. "As far as being physically 
located in one place or another, I don't think that's the issue." 
</P>
<P>
Gassner compared the consolidation plan for Southland TRACONs to one that has 
long been in effect for coverage of the nation's high-altitude airspace. 
Controllers work out of one facility in Palmdale and cover airspace above 
13,000 feet over all of Southern California and parts of Nevada and Arizona, he 
said.

PLAN FOR FIRING OF INEPT UC PROFESSORS STIRS DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The University of California is considering a controversial proposal to deal 
with what critics say are skeletons in academia's back closets: incompetent 
tenured professors. 
</P>
<P>
Some UC faculty want to publicly set guidelines for the discipline and firing 
of "grossly incompetent" professors. Others, saying such cases are better 
handled informally, fear that any definition of incompetency could be used to 
harass dissident scholars and attack the concept of lifetime employment 
promised by tenure. 
</P>
<P>
"To many faculty, when you say something about possibly terminating a tenured 
person, all hell breaks loose," explained Richard Gable, the UC Davis political 
science professor who headed the entire UC system's faculty council last year. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal about firing the grossly incompetent passed the Faculty Senate at UC 
Berkeley last spring but is opposed by UCLA's professoriate. So, a 
university-wide panel has been formed to study the matter. 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine spokeswoman Colleen Bently-Adler said the school is "aware of the 
systemwide task force but . . . since we have seen no recommendations or 
statements it would be premature to comment." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the American Assn. of University Professors, wary of possible 
threats to academic freedom, also has expressed concern. The association says 
that a UC plan could start a trend throughout the country. Few other schools 
now specify incompetency as grounds for dismissal. Among those that do is 
Stanford University. No Stanford professor has been formally fired for 
incompetence in at least 20 years, officials said, although some may have been 
pressured into retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the UC Berkeley proposal say it probably would affect a tiny 
number -- Gabel estimated a dozen -- of the 6,700 tenured professors on the 
nine UC campuses. But they say it will be more important to define professorial 
incompetence as UC prepares at the end of 1993 to drop its mandatory retirement 
at age 70. 
</P>
<P>
"Removing the time of retirement might well increase the number of people 
unaware that they have ceased to function," said history professor John 
Heilbron, chairman of the Faculty Senate at UC Berkeley. All tenured 
professors, along with police officers and firefighters, were given a 
seven-year exemption when Congress abolished mandatory retirements in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
According to Heilbron, "gross incompetence" describes only professors "one cut 
above moribund" and "means that the party is a disaster in the classroom, has 
stopped research and just no longer functions as a professor." 
</P>
<P>
Firing for such a person "seems to me difficult to argue against," he added. 
</P>
<P>
However, Jordan Kurland, associate general secretary of the American Assn. of 
University Professors, objects to a hard-and-fast definition "No one is arguing 
that we should just wink at these (incompetent) people and carry them," he 
said. "But what is needed is not a specific procedure. What is needed is enough 
initiative, enough gumption to step in and deal with an unpleasant situation. 
</P>
<P>
"When you start writing criteria and procedures to deal with the most grossly 
unfit, it just opens the door to have another category not quite as bad and 
another category not quite as bad as that," Kurland added. 
</P>
<P>
Under UC rules, a professor can be disciplined or fired for plagiarism, taking 
undue advantage of a student, or a criminal conviction, among other things. 
Officials say that the university can take similar action against an 
incompetent under a general policy of "good cause" but that most such cases are 
handled informally. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Switkes, UC's director of academic personnel, estimated that three or 
four tenured professors a year leave the system because of their poor 
performance. Most are pressured into early retirement. "There are arrangements 
made for people to leave," Switkes said. She and other UC officials declined to 
give details about those cases, citing privacy rules. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of university tenure policies contend that professors are brutally 
scrutinized for their research and teaching abilities during the selection for 
tenure but that there is little follow-up once approval is granted. However, in 
1986 UC began formal performance reviews for professors every five years, 
linking it to promotions and salaries. That uncovered some cases of 
incompetency and raised questions about what to do with them, faculty leaders 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Some professors think the current policy is too vague and that the university 
needs to confront recent criticism on tenure. For example, state Supt. of 
Public Instruction Bill Honig in August complained that UC professors spend too 
little time in the classroom. And, some students and faculty were outraged that 
former UC Santa Barbara Chancellor Robert A. Huttenback remained on the payroll 
for a year after his conviction for embezzlement of university funds; the UC 
Board of Regents suspended his salary in July and said Huttenback would be the 
first professor in the history of UC to be formally stripped of his tenure if 
he loses court appeals. 
</P>
<P>
The "gross incompetency" proposal at UC Berkeley says that a professor must be 
a flop in both research and teaching to lose tenure. That is an important point 
because some older professors slack off on new research but remain wonderful 
lecturers. For possible dismissal under the plan, a professor must show no 
likelihood of renewed scholarship and be so poor a teacher "that it is a 
disservice to students." 
</P>
<P>
If counseling fails to bring improvement, action against such a professor would 
go through a complicated ladder of review by peers, the campus chancellor and 
possibly the UC system's president and regents. 
</P>
<P>
However, biological chemistry professor Sidney Roberts, chairman of the UCLA 
Faculty Senate, said any such plan would be very difficult to administer 
fairly. "Take someone in literature," Roberts suggested. "He might be working 
on a book for 10 years and would appear to accomplish nothing in the interim. 
He might not have been doing as good a job teaching as he might. But 10 years 
later, he may win the Nobel Prize." 
</P>
<P>
A seven-member panel of professors from around the UC system is to meet soon on 
the matter. "It's unlikely that any resolution will be easily forthcoming and 
certainly not without considerable study and discussion," said committee 
chairman Charles Nash, a UC Davis chemistry professor.

Jury selection began in the trial of Miami police officer William Lozano, 
accused of killing a black motorcyclist in an incident that sparked three days 
of racial violence. Lozano faces two manslaughter counts in the Jan. 16 
shooting of the motorcyclist, who was being chased by police, and the death of 
his passenger, who was fatally injured when the motorcycle crashed. A defense 
request to have the trial moved out of the county was rejected.

Exxon has filed a legal complaint against the state of Alaska, charging that 
the state prevented the oil company from using chemicals to disperse oil in the 
early days of the Exxon Valdez spill last March. The company's complaint was 
filed as a counterclaim to a state suit against Exxon and essentially seeks to 
shift the blame off the oil company for the damage caused by the spill and onto 
the state. State officials have insisted that Exxon had permission to use 
dispersants in most of the spill area, but that the oil company had an 
insufficient quantity of dispersant and was unable to muster the needed air 
support.

Exxon Corp. sued the state of Alaska, charging that the cleanup of the Prince 
William Sound oil spill was hindered because the state opposed the use of 
oil-dispersing chemicals. Exxon said it will seek reimbursement from the state 
for cleanup costs and damage claims that the company believes occurred because 
of the state's conduct. The amounts were not specified. The case, filed in 
Anchorage Superior Court, is a counterclaim to a lawsuit that the state filed 
in August against Exxon and Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., alleging negligence 
in the March 24 spill and subsequent cleanup.

The Justice Department asked a federal judge to sentence Jim Bakker to at least 
40 years in prison, saying that he "lived like a sultan" off donations from the 
PTL television ministry. The prosecution's 16-page memorandum to the U.S. 
District Court in Charlotte, N. C., said that Bakker, 49, "told his viewers 
half-truths, lies and concealed the truth from them to induce them to send 
money." Bakker, who founded the ministry but was forced out in a sex scandal in 
1987, has been convicted on 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy. He could receive 
up to 120 years in prison when he is sentenced today.

FDA BANS CHINESE MUSHROOMS AFTER FOOD POISONINGS 
</P>

<P>
The Food and Drug Administration announced Monday that it will indefinitely ban 
all shipments of canned mushrooms from China following what the FDA called "a 
significant and alarming" series of outbreaks of severe food poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
FDA officials said that they believed that contamination with staphylococcal 
enterotoxin "may be widespread" throughout the mushroom-processing industry in 
China and that the ban will continue "until satisfactory sanitation control 
measures" are implemented in China. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA action represents a major expansion of a ban that began last May with 
institutional-size cans following four outbreaks of illness in which about 100 
people became sick. No one died but 16 people were hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the FDA said, inspectors have identified contamination in 
additional smaller sizes of cans produced by 10 plants in China. Also, the 
agency said, the FDA has reason to believe that two processing plants in China 
that have not been approved by the United States may have used the codes of 
other, approved plants to try to export their products illegally. 
</P>
<P>
"The results of our investigation give us no reason to have confidence in the 
safety of any style or any size can of mushrooms processed in the PRC (People's 
Republic of China)," said Ronald G. Chessmore, the FDA's acting associate 
commissioner for regulatory affairs, in a letter to Chinese officials here. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, all of the illnesses have been linked to mushrooms shipped in 
68-ounce or No. 10 institutional-size cans. "This is not the size a consumer 
would be expected to buy," said Chris Lecos, a spokesman for the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
No cases of mushroom-related illness have been uncovered in Orange County, and 
representatives of several retail food chains said there is no indication that 
any food now on store shelves could be contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point there is nothing, absolutely nothing, to indicate that there is 
a problem with what's on the shelves," said Vickie Sanders, spokesman for Vons 
Grocery Co., which owns 342 supermarkets, 37 of them in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was a reason to think there was a problem with the existing shelf 
product, they (the FDA) would have asked for a recall on shelf product," 
Sanders added. "They have not done so." 
</P>
<P>
Vons does stock Green Giant label mushrooms that come from China, but only in 
the smaller sizes, Sanders said. Store executives will meet with the executives 
from the label owner, Pillsbury Co., today to discuss the product, she said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Alpha Beta Co. said the chain never stocked the large sizes and 
had pulled small sizes of canned mushrooms off the shelves when word of the 
problem reached them two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We had them tested, and it was negative," said Senior Vice President Bill 
Wade. 
</P>
<P>
Word of the ban was slower to reach Orange County Chinese restaurants and food 
stores. Random calls late Monday found owners unaware of the ban and unsure 
whether their mushrooms might be unsafe. Several said their brands were from 
Taiwan and thus not implicated in the mushroom scare. 
</P>
<P>
A major wholesaler of Oriental Foods, JFC International Inc. in Los Angeles, 
said it had stopped stocking Chinese canned mushrooms more than a year ago. 
General manager George Maruta said the contaminated lots had all showed up only 
on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"In China, they must have had some warning, and the canner in China quit 
shipping it," Maruta said. "We've been out of stock for at least a year and 
half, so we don't even have one can in the warehouse." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County epidemiologist Dr. Thomas Prendergast said he was not aware of 
any mushroom-associated illness locally. "Either we haven't been affected at 
all or we haven't heard about it," he said. "I'm unaware that we've had a 
problem here." 
</P>
<P>
Lecos, the FDA spokesman, said the agency last spring notified all state health 
and other regulatory officials responsible for retail food markets, as well as 
all major trade associations responsible for the distribution of these 
products, alerting them to potential contamination. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, the FDA has found toxin in size 5.5 and 16-ounce cans, 
which consumers can purchase in retail outlets. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot rule out the possibility that smaller size cans may have ended up on 
the retail food shelf and in someone's home," Lecos said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "any product produced by the PRC, from any one of the 
processing plants, would be so identified. It would be very clear that this 
product came from the PRC. It has to be labeled. That's one of the 
requirements." 
</P>
<P>
Symptoms of food poisoning involving staphylococcal toxins can develop rapidly 
after eating a contaminated product and include nausea, vomiting, retching, 
abdominal cramping and prostration. In more severe cases, headaches, muscle 
cramping and changes in blood pressure and pulse rate can also occur, the FDA 
said. In most cases, those stricken recover in two or three days.

BAIL IS DENIED LA HABRA MAN SOUGHT AS NAZI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A La Habra man sought by the West German government on charges of murdering 
World War II concentration camp prisoners while transporting them to a camp in 
Austria was denied bail Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Ronald G. Parker contended that one-time Nazi prison guard 
Bruno Karl Blach, 69, should remain free because the shootings he is accused of 
took place in Austria rather than West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney also maintained that Blach could not be prosecuted because he was 
born in Czechoslovakia and was not a German citizen. 
</P>
<P>
In denying bail, U.S. Magistrate Venetta S. Tassopoulos ruled that such issues 
can be debated at an extradition hearing next month. 
</P>
<P>
Blach said in an affidavit: "I have no intent nor motivation to flee this 
country or this area. In fact, I would have no country or other area to flee 
to, in that I am stateless." 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, however, a federal prosecutor disclosed that Blach recently 
applied for a West German passport that, if granted, would have allowed him to 
travel almost anywhere in the world.

STING OF L.A. DEPUTIES STUNNED BREA POLICE 
</P>

<P>
Police Chief Donald L. Forkus said he didn't have a clue. His subordinate, 
Capt. Jim Oman, said he saw no evil, and neither did the crack drug 
investigators under Oman's command. 
</P>
<P>
Then a unit of Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies who had worked with Brea 
two to three days a week for a year on major drug cases failed to show up for 
an Aug. 31 stakeout. The deputies never called to say that they would not be 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Oman said his department inquired to find out why and was stunned by the 
answer: Many of the deputies were targets of an enormous investigation into 
whether they had siphoned off hundreds of thousands of dollars in confiscated 
drug money. 
</P>
<P>
Just as distressing, Oman said, was this: Federal agents had videotaped some of 
the deputies during an Aug. 30 sting operation, a day before the no-show 
stakeout. Brea police had been backup help on Aug. 30 for the deputies who were 
filmed. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of our people were very shook up about how this (the alleged diversion of 
drug cash) could have happened literally under their noses," Oman said. "We 
really had no clue what was going on. Had we known anything, we would have 
exposed it." 
</P>
<P>
High-ranking Brea police administrators said none of their officers appear to 
be involved in the alleged wrongdoing engulfing the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department in one of the worst corruption cases in its history. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the widening Los Angeles investigation has affected Brea law 
enforcement operations. Shortly after learning about the inquiry, Forkus reined 
in his roving, four-man drug squad and restricted it to cases originating 
within city limits. 
</P>
<P>
Brea too ended its cooperative arrangement with the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department, which had provided the city with hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in drug forfeiture money -- and the potential for a lot more. 
</P>
<P>
"We're back to doing pretty much local stuff," Oman said. "We're kind of 
catching our breath and seeing what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
Brea police were among the first in Southern California to recognize the 
potential of the 1984 federal law that enabled local law enforcement agencies 
to claim up to 90% of the cash and other assets they confiscate in criminal 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
That year, the city formed a "special enforcement division," and one of its 
officers began using a seized red Corvette to help him infiltrate drug rings 
throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
The team spent much of its time on tedious stakeouts and backup assignments for 
Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators. They were sent all over, from the 
San Fernando Valley to Las Vegas -- and sometimes Florida. 
</P>
<P>
It was a cooperative effort that became common as drug trafficking in the area 
broadened, with suspects stashing their drugs and money in several communities 
and frequently moving from state to state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
90% of Role Was Backup 
</P>
<P>
"We had a couple of big cases (alone), but 90% of the stuff we were doing was 
backup," Oman said. 
</P>
<P>
Brea's aid paid off. The city is waiting for its share of $2.5 million that the 
unit helped Los Angeles County deputies seize in a year. In all, Brea has 
received $4 million from confiscated assets. The money is used for officers' 
salaries and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
But the gravy train of drug forfeiture money from Los Angeles derailed on Sept. 
1, when Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block announced that his elite drug 
squad was being disbanded in the aftermath of the Aug. 30 federal sting 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agents, attorneys for deputies and Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department sources gave this account of the Aug. 30 operation: 
</P>
<P>
While backup officers from Brea waited in a parking lot, an elite team of drug 
investigators from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department smelled a sting. 
</P>
<P>
As deputies secretly watched a suspected drug dealer at a hotel restaurant in 
Sherman Oaks, they thought it odd that he boldly flashed a wad of cash after 
his meal. In fact, little about the paunchy money-laundering suspect rang true. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Much Seemed Phony 
</P>
<P>
Although the Internal Revenue Service had given officers the tip, the suspect's 
name and address seemed phony, his penthouse room too flamboyant. His contact, 
wearing a ponytail and snakeskin boots with spurs, looked like a caricature of 
a Colombian drug dealer. The deputies thought that he might be a federal agent 
known as "snake." 
</P>
<P>
Their suspicions were confirmed when one of them recognized another federal 
agent, then found a government car, a telltale Volvo with tinted windows, in 
the hotel parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies figured that -- as sometimes happened in their undercover work for 
the Sheriff's Department -- they had tripped over a federal operation. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a sting," one commented. 
</P>
<P>
He was right. The Aug. 30 stakeout at the Valley Hilton Hotel was a videotaped 
federal sting. However, the targets were not the bogus drug traffickers but the 
sheriff's deputies themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The videotape of the 12-hour stakeout has become a crucial piece of evidence in 
the local and federal inquiry into allegations that deputies have stolen 
hundreds of thousands of dollars seized in drug raids. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three $10,000 Bundles 
</P>
<P>
Captured on the film is dramatic footage of one deputy in a suspect's hotel 
suite hurriedly taking three $10,000 bundles of $100 bills from the man's 
shoulder bag and putting them into his partner's leather briefcase, according 
to suspended deputies, their attorneys and other sources who have seen the 
videotape. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI had planted about $500,000 in cash at the Hilton, but thousands never 
made it to the evidence safe, deputies were told. 
</P>
<P>
The videotape was convincing enough for the FBI, IRS and Block to announce the 
inquiry at a press conference and subsequently to investigate a flood of tips 
from drug dealers who accused deputies of stealing cash in drug raids. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after the sting, nine Los Angeles County deputies -- an entire elite 
crew of investigators that handled only major drug cases -- were suspended from 
their jobs. Their homes were searched and their names were disclosed to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
Block, who began the inquiry one year ago, suspended nine more deputies Oct. 3, 
and the scandal now appears to be the worst in the history of the nation's 
largest sheriff's department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extent of Corruption 
</P>
<P>
No charges have been filed yet. But the 18 suspensions have raised questions 
about how far the alleged corruption has spread. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies in all four of the department's now-disbanded "major violators" drug 
squads have been suspended, as has a drug investigator at Industry Station, 
department sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Drug offices at stations in Industry, Lennox and Carson were temporarily 
padlocked during the second wave of suspensions and searches. 
</P>
<P>
The homes of a retired deputy and a Los Angeles Police Department drug officer 
were also searched, as was the Central California home of a deputy's mother. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, documents served in the most recent round of searches sought 
information on 28 deputies, including five who were not members of the major 
drug units. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the suspended deputies have denied wrongdoing by their clients, 
saying that what was captured on videotape has been misconstrued as attempts to 
steal money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not in Position to See 
</P>
<P>
"If all this happened, we didn't see it," Brea's Capt. Oman said. "I don't 
think our officers were ever in a position to see anything." 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath, Oman said he and Chief Forkus questioned their detectives and 
were satisfied that they had been isolated from any wrongdoing. Police said 
none of the Brea officers have been questioned by federal or Los Angeles County 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
According to Brea police, backup officers usually guarded perimeters or waited 
in parking lots or locations away from the deputies and suspects. They did not 
confiscate drug money as evidence, and neither did surveillance officers. 
</P>
<P>
In those cases where Brea officers helped to seize cash, Oman said, "it was our 
impression that the money was bagged up and given to the federal government. 
Now we learn that might not have been the case." 
</P>
<P>
Brea police said the seized assets that resulted from helping Los Angeles 
County deputies represented a large amount of money for a small police 
department. Officers said that although drug operations have been curtailed 
they are doing the best they can, and that other cooperative arrangements with 
Orange County law enforcement agencies are still in place. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decision of Police Alone 
</P>
<P>
Brea Mayor Gene A. Leyton said the decision to scale back Brea drug operations 
was made by the police alone. 
</P>
<P>
He noted, however: "As a city, we're not trying to become the narcotics 
enforcement against Southern California. We don't want them working in San 
Diego or Santa Barbara unless it has some relativity to us." 
</P>
<P>
Oman said the reduction in operations is necessary but unfortunate. 
</P>
<P>
"The trend on these cases, they seem to be getting bigger and bigger quantities 
of the drugs, and it takes some cooperation," he said. "Something like this, 
suspicions of theft . . . this sets the whole thing back."

CURTIS' FOES FALL SHORT ON RECALL PETITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A preliminary check of petitions demanding the recall of City Councilman Robert 
A. Curtis suggested Monday that his foes are several hundred signatures short, 
despite spending more than $124,000 to force an election. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said it is too early to predict how many more signatures will be 
declared valid after the petitions are reviewed more closely, but they agreed 
that the "first pass" turned up just 7,293 signatures, 477 short of the 7,770 
needed to force a vote on recalling Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
Those numbers, officials said, are tentative and were being rechecked late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Still, they are far short of those predicted by recall supporters, who turned 
in 12,001 signatures Sept. 28 and have confidently predicted ever since that 
more than 8,000 would be determined valid. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, however, City Clerk Ivy J. Zobel said county officials had tossed 
out hundreds of signatures because of mistakes made in the affidavits by some 
people circulating petitions. The exact number invalidated by affidavit 
mistakes is not known, Zobel said, but enough were discarded to leave the 
recall in doubt until county officials can scrutinize the petitions a second 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, a second run will produce significantly more valid signatures -- 
including, for instance, registered voters who signed a petition using a 
nickname rather than full name -- but Monday's count left a large gap. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd expect that more would be determined valid on the next run, but I don't 
know how many," Zobel said. "We'll have to wait and see what the whole picture 
looks like." 
</P>
<P>
At least for the time being, those numbers cast a shadow over the efforts of 
the well-financed recall coalition, giving the first hint that its popular 
support may be thinner than previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
Recall leaders were initially stunned by the low number of valid signatures. 
"Those numbers are very surprising to me," said Helen Monroe, chairwoman of the 
recall campaign. "This is the first I've heard of there being any problem." 
</P>
<P>
After checking the numbers, Monroe said she is less concerned, believing that 
enough valid signatures will emerge from the second round to force a vote on 
Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
While recall leaders reeled from the early numbers, Curtis rejoiced, calling 
the returns a vindication of his popularity and an indictment of his opponents' 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"This totally discredits them," Curtis said. "They spent a fortune, and they're 
still sweating out another recount." 
</P>
<P>
The recall coalition has raised $156,422, mostly from the Mission Viejo Co. and 
developers that do business with that company. Of those contributions, the 
campaign has spent $124,907 so far, more than $69,000 of it to circulate the 
petitions. 
</P>
<P>
Intense interest in the recall by local developers -- the Mission Viejo Co. 
alone has contributed $35,717 in money and in-kind support -- has turned early 
jockeying in the struggle into a referendum about developer influence, as much 
as about Curtis' performance. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis has cast his struggle as a populist battle to resist the powerful 
influence of the Mission Viejo Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Philip 
Morris Cos. Inc. The Mission Viejo Co. remains an active participant in the 
city's civic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mission Viejo Co. is trying to dominate the local affairs of this city," 
Curtis said. "If people are content with developer domination of local affairs, 
then they can vote my defeat." 
</P>
<P>
The company's executives have retorted that the councilman has ignored the 
wishes of his constituents and used the company as a diversion from the issues 
prompting his recall. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, company officials have condemned Curtis' support for the 
unsuccessful effort to annex Aegean Hills, a pie-shaped section of 
unincorporated county land. 
</P>
<P>
That issue is what first brought Curtis and the company into open combat. 
Curtis' effort, which has since been shelved, was called by the company "both 
fiscally unsound and divisive to the community." 
</P>
<P>
The company repeated its support for recall Monday. Ever since the Aegean Hills 
annexation effort, "it has been clear to us that he (Curtis) is not 
representing the people of Mission Viejo," said Wendy Wetzel, a spokeswoman for 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe defended the outspoken role of company officials. "I think it (the 
recall bid) is good business for them," she said. "I think it's good business 
to show the people of Mission Viejo that they care." 
</P>
<P>
Curtis acknowledged that he may still have to fight a recall battle, as more 
signatures are expected to be validated. But he and other observers agreed that 
the unexpectedly low numbers got the recall campaign off to a stumbling start, 
putting proponents on the defensive before the campaign begins in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
"Mission Viejo voters are not easily duped," he said. "And they're not going to 
be easily taken in by special interests." 
</P>
<P>
If the recall coalition's signatures are determined to be valid, the City 
Council would be forced to schedule a date for a special election. Observers 
indicated that such an election would probably be held early next year, most 
likely in or around March.

SPARE THE ROD AND SELF-ESTEEM, STUDY SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
DISCIPLINE: IF YOU ARE TRYING TO INSTILL CONFIDENCE IN YOUR CHILDREN, PUT THE 
HAIR BRUSH AWAY. PHYSICAL PUNISHMENT IS NOT THE WAY TO GO, ACCORDING TO A SAN 
DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY STUDY.

Children who are disciplined with a slap or a spanking are generally less 
competent -- and less confident -- than children who don't receive physical 
punishment in the home, according to a San Diego State University study 
released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted this spring and summer in several San Diego County 
elementary schools, examined the effect of physical punishment on a child's 
self-esteem. According to Dr. Anthony J. Urquiza, the study's author, the 
research focused on families that regularly use physical discipline as a 
parenting technique, but it intentionally excluded abusive families. 
</P>
<P>
After testing third-, fourth- and fifth-graders, ages 8 to 11 years old, for 
scholastic abilities, social acceptance, athletic skills, physical appearance, 
behavioral conduct and perceptions of self-worth, Urquiza concluded that the 
harsher and more frequent a parent's punishment, the lower their child's 
overall competence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Violence Begets Violence' 
</P>
<P>
"How much should you hit your child? You shouldn't, ever. When is it OK? It's 
not," Urquiza, an assistant professor in SDSU's Family Studies Department, said 
Monday after he presented his findings to the Eighth National Conference on 
Child Abuse and Neglect in Salt Lake City. "It is damaging to children to hurt 
them. Violence begets violence." 
</P>
<P>
According to Urquiza, recent studies show that 80% to 97% of all children are 
physically punished at some time in their childhood. He said most parents who 
raise a hand to their kids believe they are helping their children learn the 
difference between right and wrong. According to his research, however, they 
are mistaken. 
</P>
<P>
"They slap or hit with a paddle or belt while thinking, 'I'm teaching you 
something for your own good.' They think it is an effective means of dealing 
with a child," he said. "But it only provides a short-term solution. It doesn't 
help children in the long run learn what to do." 
</P>
<P>
He offered an example. A parent sees her child in a fight with another 
youngster. She intervenes, and slaps her child in order to let him know that 
fighting is not acceptable. But Urquiza maintains that, instead of learning not 
to fight, the child may interpret the slap this way: "If I am going to hit 
somebody, I have to be the most powerful person around." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expression of Anger 
</P>
<P>
According to Urquiza's results, families that use physical punishment are 
generally less organized, more chaotic and more likely to have strict, 
inflexible rules. Members of such families are more openly willing to express 
anger and hostility, Urquiza said. 
</P>
<P>
Parents in such families reported many more behavioral problems among their 
youngsters, like fighting with siblings or an angry attitude, than parents who 
did not hit their children. Children who are physically punished, meanwhile, 
often have a distorted view of their own bodies and their physical abilities, 
Urquiza found. "The kids may think of themselves as weaker or not as able to 
play on sports teams," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Urquiza said he believes the news of his research will not change most parents' 
disciplinary methods. "This is not something that the public at large appears 
to want to hear," he said. "A lot of parents will disbelieve it. They want to 
continue to have the right to discipline their children as they see fit. But 
many will be meeting only their needs, and not the needs of their children."

Orange County and 11 other government and private agencies joined in a practice 
emergency drill Monday at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station just south 
of San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Among those participating from Orange County were Board of Supervisors Chairman 
Thomas F. Riley and officials from the county's Fire Department and its 
division of emergency management. Some of the officials went to San Onofre 
while others manned the county's emergency communications center in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
San Onofre spokesman Jack Wallace said officials set up operation centers in 
the cities and county locations. A scenario depicting a malfunction at the 
plant was used for the seven-hour training drill. Wallace said between 600 and 
700 people participated in the drill. 
</P>
<P>
Also involved in the training and evaluation drill were the California Highway 
Patrol from San Diego and Orange counties, Marines from Camp Pendleton, 
officials from San Diego County, firefighters from Oceanside, as well as 
representatives from the state Department of Parks and Recreation, the Orange 
County chapter of the American Red Cross, the state Office of Emergency 
Services, and the cities of San Clemente, San Juan Capistrano and Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
The drill was evaluated by the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which 
will prepare a written report on Monday's drill. 
</P>
<P>
The nuclear plant, operated by the Southern California Edison Co., is in San 
Diego County. GEORGE FRANK

LOW-KEY CAMPAIGN WOOS SCHOOL BOND VOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vista Unified School District, the second-fastest-growing school district in 
the state, can expect 2,000 new students every year for at least the next six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
So district leaders have hired some professionals -- Price Research Consultants 
-- to do what the locals could not manage to do a year ago: pass a bond issue 
that will enable the district to build new schools and repair old ones. 
</P>
<P>
And the experts have embarked on a decidedly understated campaign. 
</P>
<P>
No Day-Glo signs urging YES for KIDS. No full-page ads in the local newspaper 
carrying the endorsements of the city's elite for Proposition C. The game plan 
is to alert the affirmative voters without arousing the negative crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, a presidential election year, about 75% of Vista's registered 
voters voted. Among other things, they turned down a $63-million school bond 
issue after a hard-sell campaign. 
</P>
<P>
So this year school officials have taken a less direct path to their goal by 
recruiting schoolchildren in a voter registration drive of their parents in 
hopes of coaxing the "yes" votes past the 66.6% margin necessary for victory. 
</P>
<P>
In coming days, local volunteers will begin telephone marathons aimed at both 
reminding known supporters and at rounding up the strays. Selective mailings to 
parents and other potential school bond supporters are scheduled as the days 
dwindle down to the Nov. 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
"We are within striking distance of victory," Kent Price, head of the 
consultant firm, asserted Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Price based his prediction on the quiet strengthening of pro-school voter rolls 
and a recent telephone survey taken by the firm that showed only a percentage 
point or two separating the district from its needed two-thirds majority. 
</P>
<P>
In the next two weeks, Price said, telephone, mail and door-to-door persuasion 
will be used in an attempt to swing the vote to the win column. 
</P>
<P>
There are no vocal opponents to the bond issue, but there are many who question 
why residents who have paid school taxes over the years must subsidize the 
newcomers' schools. 
</P>
<P>
Vista Mayor Gloria McClellan can answer that question without pausing for 
thought. 
</P>
<P>
"Vista's schools, like its streets and roads, are old and inadequate" she 
explained. "Despite what many people think, we can't charge developers anything 
we want in school fees. There is a limit, and that limit just about pays for 
providing portables for the new students." 
</P>
<P>
With the average Vista school more than 30 years old, and, until recent months, 
no new schools built in 15 years, the district faces the major cost of bringing 
the old buildings up to standard and building new ones, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The bond issue will cost the owner of a home assessed at $100,000 an average of 
$45.83 in yearly property taxes over the 20-year life of the bond issue, Manual 
Robles, communications coordinator for the school district, said. 
</P>
<P>
The first year's taxes on that $100,000 home would amount to about $110 for the 
bonds, but would go down each year to a low of $12.72 on the 20th year of the 
issue, Robles explained. School officials say they will use $27.6 million of 
the bond issue to build six schools, probably elementary schools, to 
accommodate the expected flood of youngsters from the new subdivisions in 
eastern Oceanside, which lie within the Vista Unified School District 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Another $9.5 million is earmarked for renovation of existing schools, including 
the 51-year-old Lincoln Middle School, which is limping along with an ancient 
boiler, flaking walls and leaky roof. A $1.5 million portion is set aside for 
classroom safety improvements, including rewiring, and $280,000 for library 
upgrading. 
</P>
<P>
The funds won't last as long as the bond payments, Robles acknowledges. With 
luck, he said, they will meet the district's most pressing needs for five to 
eight years.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CAB DRIVER ACCUSED OF SPENDING BANK ERROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A cab driver from Hawthorne has been charged with taking advantage of an error 
at a Bank of America branch to steal $10,000 and treated himself to a car and a 
gambling spree in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
One count of grand theft was filed against Hormoz Mahmoudi, 40, in South Bay 
Municipal Court. Police say the cab driver, who is free on his own 
recognizance, told them that he thought his rich father-in-law in London had 
deposited the money to his account at a Bank of America branch in Redondo 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, police said, an East Coast bank had wired $10,000 to the Bank of 
America branch and the money was mistakenly credited to Mahmoudi's account. The 
bank discovered its error and mailed a letter to Mahmoudi informing him of the 
mistake, but the cab driver told authorities he did not understand the letter. 
</P>
<P>
Mahmoudi said he traveled with an aunt to Las Vegas, where he lost $4,000 at 
the gaming tables, sent another $2,000 to his mother, paid $2,000 for a car, 
$550 for lodging and $500 for a car stereo. 
</P>
<P>
The cabbie has promised to repay the bank.

TEACHERS VOTING ON DISTRICT'S LATEST OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE BEL BRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teachers will finish voting on the school district's latest offer on Wednesday, 
capping four months of intense contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The results of the three-day advisory vote held at each of the city's 30 
schools will be released when both parties meet on Thursday. If teachers vote 
against the proposed contract, the school district will ask for a state 
mediator. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiators for the Irvine Teachers Assn. recommended last week that the 
district's 1,000 teachers reject the offer. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that they will support ITA wholeheartedly," union president Barbara 
Dresel said. "There will be a firm 'no' vote on the latest proposal by the 
school district. We are not that far off, but we are willing to take this as 
far as needed." 
</P>
<P>
If not approved this week, the following issues will be turned over to the 
state negotiator: 
</P>
<P>
* The proposal states that the three-year contract will include no reopener, 
but teachers want the option to renegotiate. 
</P>
<P>
* The district is offering a 6% raise for the next three years, with a 1% bonus 
this year. Teachers are asking for a 6% raise and 1% bonus this year, a 7% 
raise and 1% bonus next year, and a 6% raise the following year. 
</P>
<P>
* The teachers want certain medical benefits extended to teachers hired before 
1986, who do not now receive them. Teachers would help fund those benefits 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
* The teachers want to phase out use of teachers for playground supervision at 
grammar schools. Santa Ana Unified School District did so several years ago, 
hiring playground supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
* Union negotiators oppose a proposed schedule which would let all schools out 
at 12:30 to 1:30 p.m. one day each week, and make up the time the other four 
days. The union wants individual schools to make that choice. JOE BEL BRUNO

OFFICIALS CRITICIZE LOPEZ CANYON IMPACT REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Los Angeles city councilmen and a state assemblyman on Monday night blasted 
an environmental impact report supporting plans to expand the Lopez Canyon 
Landfill as biased, misleading and inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Ernarni Bernardi and Joel Wachs said the environmental impact report 
did not fully discuss the potential hazards the expansion would pose for people 
living near the dump above Lake View Terrace. They said the report -- prepared 
for the city Bureau of Sanitation by a consultant -- failed to explore 
alternatives, such as recycling, that would lessen the city's reliance on 
landfills to dispose of trash. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a report for people who have made their mind up already," Wachs said. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) said city sanitation officials should look 
elsewhere in Los Angeles for solutions to the city's mounting garbage crisis. 
"We have done more than our fair share in the northeast Valley for the city of 
Los Angeles," Katz said. "We will fight it every step of the way." 
</P>
<P>
Katz, Bernardi and Wachs testified before representatives of the Los Angeles 
Board of Public Works and Bureau of Sanitation at a hearing attended by about 
70 people at the Lake View Terrace Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Public Works will hold another hearing on the report Friday. If 
the proposal clears the board, it still must be approved by the city Planning 
Commission and City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The 600-page report responds to more than 1,400 comments from citizens and 
public agencies on the $16-million expansion plan. Overall, the report says, 
the expansion would not harm residents living near the dump. 
</P>
<P>
The city's permits to operate Lopez Canyon, which receives two-thirds of all 
residential waste in Los Angeles, expire in 1992. City sanitation officials 
hope to secure new permits and extend the life of the landfill to 2002. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, state officials ordered the city to curtail operations at Lopez 
Canyon, saying sanitation officials violated permits by dumping too much trash 
each day. Los Angeles officials said they would have to close the landfill 
within days if they complied with the order from the California Waste 
Management Board.

POLICE IDENTIFY MAN WOUNDED BY OFFICERS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man shot by two Anaheim police officers Sunday was identified Monday as Jose 
Arroyo Rodriguez, 24, who is believed to live in Anaheim, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said Rodriguez's identification had been delayed because he 
had been uncooperative in giving information about himself. Officers learned 
his name by checking fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was shot in the back, abdomen and side when he confronted officers in 
the courtyard of an apartment building on South Michelle Drive just after 
midnight Sunday, according to Lt. Marc Hedgpeth. Both officers opened fire when 
the man turned toward them while holding a handgun, Hedgpeth said. He said 
officers had demanded several times that Hedgpeth drop his weapon, a 
semiautomatic pistol. 
</P>
<P>
Officers had gone to the apartment building after receiving reports that 
Rodriguez had fired a shot in the air and was knocking on apartment doors. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was taken to UCI Medical Center where Hedgpeth said he was in stable 
condition Monday.

STRIPPER PARTY SPURS FORUM AT CHAPMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A campuswide forum on morals will be held today at Chapman College in response 
to an incident last month in which a stripper was hired to entertain at an 
off-campus fraternity party. 
</P>
<P>
The forum, entitled "A Question of Values," is set for 11 a.m. in Hashinger 
Hall on campus and will feature a discussion among students and faculty on 
values that Chapman College "stands for and should uphold," Pamela Ezell, the 
school's spokeswoman, said. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Bolger, director of residence life at the 2,200-student college, said the 
stripper incident involving members of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity "raised 
a larger issue of values on the campus." 
</P>
<P>
"We need to get together and discuss how we determine values," Bolger said 
Monday. "This is an issue across the country. Many campuses are wrestling with 
the issue of values." 
</P>
<P>
Two members of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity, Chapman College's largest, invited 
the topless stripper to a party at their off-campus apartment on Sept. 28, 
according to the fraternity's president. About 50 students, many of them 
fraternity members, attended. 
</P>
<P>
The school earlier this month punished the fraternity with a one-year 
suspension and a second year's probation. But Chapman officials decided to set 
the suspension aside and allow a student "Greek Judicial Board" review the 
incident and make recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Bolger said the board decided last Thursday to place the fraternity on 
probation for one year and to require its members to become involved in three 
educational projects on campus, such as holding a forum on the dangers of 
pornography. 
</P>
<P>
The student board consists of members from all the school's fraternities and 
sororities. JIM CARLTON

CLERK FATALLY INJURED AFTER PURSUING TEEN

LAGUNA NIGUEL CITYHOOD FOES CANCEL MEETINGS

LAGUNA NIGUEL 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The only group opposing cityhood for Laguna Niguel has canceled campaign 
appearances for the past two weeks, a lull following the release of a report 
predicting a $3.5-million budget surplus should voters approve incorporation 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Stop Cityhood, which had claimed that the area could not 
afford to become a city, confirmed Monday that the group has made no campaign 
appearances since Oct. 9. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not dead," said Debi Larsen of Stop Cityhood, "We're just researching 
(the report)." 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood backers said Monday that the lack of opposition in the final weeks of 
the campaign boosts their chances for victory on Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Denny Harris, a member of the executive committee of Citizens for Cityhood, 
said that "without a doubt" pro-cityhood prospects had been enhanced by the 
opposition's unexpected silence. The report is convincing skeptics that the 
finances of the proposed city would be sound, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always said that people would be won over if they got the correct 
information," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Larsen, who describes herself as a homemaker opposed to "rushing into 
cityhood," said Monday that she is not convinced by the report, but that she 
and the other 24 Stop Cityhood members will continue to review it. 
</P>
<P>
"We took some time to study the budget because we didn't want to go out there 
and make fools of ourselves," she said. "We have a meeting Tuesday night, and 
we'll be deciding what to do then." 
</P>
<P>
The Oct. 9 report, by Christensen &amp; Wallace Inc. of Oceanside, concluded 
that Laguna Niguel would operate comfortably in the black -- and even amass a 
$3.5-million surplus in its first year -- if the community becomes a city. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said Monday that Citizens for Cityhood will continue to mount a strong 
campaign as the election nears. "We have many speaking engagements, including 
(talks) to homeowner associations," Harris said. "We have not changed our 
schedule or slowed down one bit." 
</P>
<P>
Harris said that pro-cityhood workers and candidates for council seats in the 
proposed new city "are reporting at least 75% support from residents as they go 
door-to-door and talk to the voters." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel would become Orange County's 29th city if more than 50% of those 
voting Nov. 7 approve the proposal. Cityhood would be effective Dec. 1.

FAMILY SEEKS DAMAGES IN JAILED MAN'S DEATH; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: OFFICIALS DIDN'T CALL A DOCTOR DESPITE THE BIZARRE BEHAVIOR OF A MAN 
INJURED DURING HIS ARREST. 
</P>

Jail officials failed to summon a doctor to examine a North Hollywood man who 
died in jail although he was behaving bizarrely, had face and arm injuries, 
bruises on his back and stomach and dried blood in his ear, according to 
evidence introduced at a civil trial Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Malinovitz, 38, did not know where he was, a nurse wrote when 
Malinovitz arrived at the Men's Central Jail on Jan. 24, 1984. He was unable to 
give the date, laughed for no apparent reason, and was uncooperative when 
nurses tried to take his temperature and blood pressure, the record said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Malinovitz's injuries and strange behavior, jail staff members did not 
summon a doctor to examine him, but strapped him to a cot until they took him 
to court the next morning, according to jail medical records read in San 
Fernando Superior Court on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Malinovitz died from a blood clot in his lung four days after he arrived in 
jail. His wife and children are suing Los Angeles County for unspecified 
damages. They claim that the county never provided Malinovitz with medical 
care, despite obvious symptoms that something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy County Counsel Philip S. Miller said last week that Malinovitz's 
confusion stemmed from a mental illness and was not a symptom of the blood clot 
that killed him. Malinovitz's physical injuries were inflicted by the arresting 
officers who beat him with a baton and gripped him in a chokehold to subdue 
him, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Malinovitz, who had no previous criminal record, was arrested for pushing an 
elderly woman to the ground in a shopping mall for no apparent reason. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Arthur Golding, a vascular surgeon testifying Monday for the Malinovitz 
family, said a doctor should have examined Malinovitz to determine whether his 
behavior was related to his injuries, and to rule out other physical problems 
that can cause confusion, such as diabetes or a skull fracture. 
</P>
<P>
"It was critical that they make an examination to determine the underlying 
cause of the behavior," Golding said. "There is no question that a man in this 
situation needs immediate medical care." 
</P>
<P>
On his first night in jail, Malinovitz vomited on himself in bed, medical 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
Two days before Malinovitz's death, a judge ordered sheriff's deputies to take 
Malinovitz to County-USC Medical Center, but deputies returned him to jail. 
County lawyers have said that the judge's order was misplaced by a court clerk, 
and that deputies were not to blame. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Malinovitz had been taken to the hospital, Miller said last week, 
doctors could not have prevented his death because he had no symptoms of the 
embolism that killed him. 
</P>
<P>
But Golding testified that doctors could have found and treated the clotting, 
preventing the fatal embolism, if they had had an opportunity to take 
Malinovitz's history and examine him. Malinovitz had a history of blood clots. 
</P>
<P>
"If he had been transferred to a medical facility, a history would have been 
taken and doctors would have alerted to the possibility of deep venous 
thrombosis," Golding said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Malinovitz would still be alive if he had been taken to a hospital, 
Golding replied, "I believe that he would be." 
</P>
<P>
On cross-examination, Golding, who was brought in as an expert witness, said he 
has been paid $8,000 to testify in depositions and court proceedings in this 
case.

MORE DOCTORS SHUN MEDI-CAL PRENATAL COVERAGE; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: A MARCH OF DIMES STUDY OFFERS PERHAPS THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT 
TO DATE OF AN INCREASINGLY VISIBLE HEALTH-CARE PROBLEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The number of county doctors willing to accept Medi-Cal coverage of expectant 
mothers has decreased at a time when concern is growing over infant mortality, 
according to a new study. 
</P>
<P>
Warnings about the need to reverse that trend were included in the March of 
Dimes study, which area health specialists said offers perhaps the most 
comprehensive assessment to date of the increasingly visible problem of 
prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
Despite clear evidence that medical attention in the early stages of pregnancy 
reduces the risk of low birth weight and unhealthy infants, the study found 
that about 12% of Latino mothers and 15% of teens get little or no prenatal 
care, making them the two highest-risk groups. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, about 7% of the 38,730 county women who gave birth in 1987 received 
inadequate prenatal care, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing," said Dorothy Andrews of the Orange County branch of the March 
of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation, "a wider schism than ever before between 
those who are able to receive care and those who aren't, and the message is 
that we need to get the community excited about making mothers and babies a 
priority." 
</P>
<P>
She oversaw the study, completed last week. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of prenatal care among poor women was highlighted by UCI Medical 
Center's policy of diverting to other medical facilities women in labor who 
have not been treated previously at UCI. The diversion policy goes into effect 
only when the emergency room and maternity wards are full. 
</P>
<P>
The study's findings on the increasing strain created by indigent women on the 
health system "vindicates us," said Dr. Thomas Garite, head of the medical 
center's obstetrics and gynecology department. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first implemented our policy," he said, "we were looked upon as the 
perpetrator. But more and more lately -- and this study shows it -- we're being 
seen as the victim of a system that concentrates its indigent care on one 
hospital. We are not a county hospital." 
</P>
<P>
The study, several months in the making, concluded that public and private 
campaigns against infant mortality and health problems should focus on the 
poor, minorities, youths and substance abusers -- groups that have received 
inadequate care consistently in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Research has shown that babies born to mothers with no prenatal care are four 
times more likely to die at birth than those who received first-trimester care. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the problem locally, health experts said, is the increasing strain 
on the state's public health insurance program and government-sponsored 
programs for poor mothers. 
</P>
<P>
The March of Dimes study found that, since 1985, the number of private doctors 
in the perinatal field -- those providing service about the time of delivery -- 
who accepted Medi-Cal coverage decreased from 64 to 52. 
</P>
<P>
The decrease portends "an especially critical situation," the study said, 
because recent income changes in the state plan mean more women can get public 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
But the change "will make no difference" if a woman eligible for Medi-Cal 
"cannot find a provider who will accept her insurance," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
While the county provides prenatal care for poor women at four locations and 
offers additional referrals, it has no system to provide for actual delivery 
services, so women must make their own arrangements, the report noted. 
</P>
<P>
"Because most of these women (receiving county assistance) are low income, 
speak only Spanish and face severe financial and cultural barriers, 
arrangements for delivery prior to the onset of labor are rarely made," the 
report found. 
</P>
<P>
"Women usually wait until they go into labor and then proceed to a hospital 
emergency room, with the hope of finding one that will accept laboring patients 
for delivery." 
</P>
<P>
The study found that although Latino women account for just 35% of total births 
in the county, they make up 61% of the births to mothers who received 
inadequate prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
Marianne Maxwell, who heads the county's newly formed task force on perinatal 
care, said: "This is the first full report we have at this point and the most 
current, and it's certainly going to be vital information for us in our 
studies."

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 6 COURAGEOUS CITIZENS HONORED IN CEREMONY AT 
COURTHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steven Kelley was putting training wheels on his daughter's bike when he saw 
three men chasing an armed robber in his Sherman Oaks neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley, 32, who has been deaf since birth, jumped up and helped the men subdue 
the robber, who had just held up at gunpoint 65-year-old Samuel Luffman and his 
97-year-old father, Isaac. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley, a custodian and janitor for a local church, was among six people whose 
heroism was heralded Monday in a "Courageous Citizens Award" ceremony at the 
Van Nuys Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Also honored were Samuel Luffman, who chased the robber after being held up, 
and two employees of a Sun Valley termite extermination company, Antonio Perez 
and John Vallejo, who helped capture and disarm the bandit. 
</P>
<P>
"You are being recognized today for having a human trait that none of us know 
we have until we have been tested: courage," said Los Angeles County Dist. 
Atty. Ira Reiner, who gives the awards periodically in courthouses throughout 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the incident involving Kelley, the accused, John Leroy Moser, 
31, of Castaic, is facing criminal charges in Van Nuys Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Other people honored included Lee Bibbie, an Altadena man who saved a Los 
Angeles County sheriff's deputy last August after an assailant struck the 
deputy and tried to strangle him in a Palmdale bank. The attacker was convicted 
of forgery and sentenced to four years in prison, authorities said. Bibbie was 
not present Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth honoree was Evelyn Jones, 42, of Pasadena, who jumped into her car 
and chased a young man on a bicycle who had stolen her purse. Jones eventually 
flagged down a patrolman, who arrested the thief.

An armed man robbed a Point Loma check-cashing store Monday and escaped with 
about $25,000, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The robber entered Checks Cashed for Less at 1460 Rosecrans St. at 9 a.m. while 
a female worker, whom the store owner refused to identify, was unlocking the 
front door. He grabbed her from behind and threatened to shoot her, spokesman 
Bill Robinson said. The employee's feet were tied and her hands were bound with 
non-metal handcuffs, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
After the bandit fled with $25,000, the woman freed herself and ran across the 
street to a real estate office to call police, Robinson said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: DEL MAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A request for a change of venue in the trial of a man suspected of battering, 
molesting and abandoning twin boys at a Del Mar hotel was denied Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Rosenfeld, the attorney for Charles McCoy, 28, of Oceanside, requested 
that McCoy's trial be moved to another county because of pretrial publicity. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge Michael Wellington denied the motion, saying it 
was not necessary to have the trial transferred in order for McCoy to receive a 
fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
The twin boys, now 3 years old, were found bruised, crying and wandering the 
halls of the Del Mar Inn in their underwear March 25. McCoy, who is charged 
with child abuse, is believed to have checked in with them under another name, 
but checked out and left them there. 
</P>
<P>
His girlfriend and the boys' mother, Dorothy DeSimone, 26, of Oceanside, 
pleaded guilty May 9 to child endangerment and was sentenced July 5 to one year 
in jail and five years probation. 
</P>
<P>
DeSimone testified against McCoy at his preliminary hearing in July. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, McCoy received a new trial date of Nov. 30.

TITANS' COCHELL, TENNESSEE DISCUSS COACHING JOB 
</P>

<P>
Cal State Fullerton baseball Coach Larry Cochell has held discussions with 
University of Tennessee Athletic Director Doug Dickey about the school's vacant 
baseball coaching job and might travel to Knoxville for further talks, Cochell 
confirmed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Cochell, 49, has been at Fullerton for two seasons, guiding the Titans to the 
College World Series in his first season after replacing Augie Garrido, but 
finishing with the Titans' worst record since 1973 last year, 30-27. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been contacted by Tennessee," Cochell said. "I'm extremely happy where 
I am." 
</P>
<P>
The Tennessee position has been open about two months since the resignation of 
Mark Connor, who left a coaching job with the New York Yankees to take the 
Tennessee job two years ago and has now returned to the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee set school records for losses in a season in each of the past two, 
finishing 23-36 overall last season, 4-23 in the Southeastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Dickey has told the Knoxville News-Sentinel that the list of candidates has 
been narrowed to five. Other candidates mentioned prominently by the 
News-Sentinel include interim coach Mike Barnett, Florida State assistant Rob 
Delmonico, Western Carolina Coach Jack Leggett, Cleveland (Tenn.) State Coach 
Steve Longley and Miami assistant Turtle Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Cochell said he first talked with Dickey about two weeks ago, and that he had 
sought and received Fullerton Athletic Director Ed Carroll's permission to hold 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Cochell coached at Northwestern for one season and at Oral Roberts for 10 
before taking the job at Fullerton when Garrido resigned to become coach at 
Illinois. Cochell also has been a head coach at Emporia (Kan.) State, Creighton 
and Cal State Los Angeles.

TICKET SALES TO EARN ALMOST $300 MILLION; 
</P>
<P>
NBA: MEMO INDICATES THE LEAGUE HAS FOUND FINANCIAL STABILITY. LAKER AVERAGE 
PRICES ARE MORE THAN $8 HIGHER THAN THE LEAGUE AVERAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHERWA, TIMES ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Basketball Assn., which a few years ago was struggling for 
financial stability, has more than found it. In fact, it can collectively 
expect to bring in almost $300 million in ticket sales during the next regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
And again, the leader in ticket-sales revenue will be the Lakers, who have a 
league-leading average of $27.25 a ticket, more than $4 higher than the closest 
team, the New York Knicks. The Lakers can expect to make more than $20 million 
in ticket revenue before the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
A Laker ticket is more than $8 higher than the league average of $18.98. The 
ticket information, obtained by The Times from a memo distributed by the league 
to team marketing directors, indicates that the average ticket in the NBA has 
increased by about $2 from last season. Last season's average was $16.93. The 
average price of a Clipper ticket is $17.46, which is 20th in the 27-team 
league. 
</P>
<P>
In making the computations, the NBA does not count ticket blocks of fewer than 
200 seats. For example, the 128 celebrity courtside seats at Laker games, up 
from $250 to $350 a game, were not counted in determining the average. Neither 
were the two sets of 138 seats at Clipper games that sell for $125 and $100 a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The league memo listed an average ticket price of $19.21, but the figure was 
revised downward when errors were found in the ticket computations of the 
Minnesota Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
The memo showed several other interesting facets of ticket pricing. For 
example: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Orlando Magic, which has yet to play a game, has the sixth-highest 
ticket average at $21.42. Pat Williams, president of the Magic, said the team 
will freeze prices for three years, at which point the team's average will be 
in the league's lower half. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only the Lakers, Detroit Pistons and Chicago Bulls make more money from 
tickets than the Charlotte Hornets, who are in their second season. The size of 
Charlotte Coliseum, built in 1988 with a capacity of 23,343, brings the team 
more than $415,000 for a sellout. Last season, the Hornets sold out 36 of 41 
games and this season have stopped season sales at 21,000. Team officials say 
there are 4,500 people on a waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The most exclusive seats in the NBA are in Richfield, Ohio, where the 
Cleveland Cavaliers play. There are six floor seats next to the benches that 
sell for $100. According to a Cavalier spokeswoman, the six people are not 
celebrities, just ticket holders who upgraded when the seats became available. 
Those six seats make up the smallest ticket group anywhere in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Lakers, in addition to having the most expensive, also have the 
lowest-priced tickets in the NBA. They reserve 40 locations on the walkway 
between the loge and colonnade for fans in wheelchairs. Those tickets cost $2. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA does not have a policy on ticket prices and there is no revenue sharing 
among teams as there is in the National Football League. A team gets to keep as 
much as it can collect. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, it's all up to the individual teams," said Seth Sylvan, an NBA 
spokesman. "We think the teams know their market better than we do. They can 
set the price at whatever they like." 
</P>
<P>
The NBA has been playing at 85% capacity, with the Lakers enjoying the greatest 
success. They have a season-ticket base of 15,000 and a capacity of 17,505. 
However, the Lakers can't sell season packages for the remaining 2,505 seats 
because they couldn't guarantee playoff tickets to those ticket holders. In the 
playoffs, those tickets go to league officials, media representatives and 
sponsors. During the regular season and sometimes in the early playoff rounds, 
those tickets are sold to the public. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers sell out, or come within a few seats of capacity, in all their 
games. 
</P>
<P>
According to a Laker official, 7,000 seats in the Forum increased in price from 
last season. Most of those seats were located in the high-rent district, where 
people have been season-ticket holders for many years. In addition, the Senate 
seat program was expanded to 2,607 seats. A Senate seat is good for all events 
at the Forum, which include the Kings hockey team, boxing, concerts and 
specialty shows. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers, coming off their 13th consecutive season of missing the playoffs, 
increased prices for about 1,300 of their high-rent seats. Andy Roeser, 
executive vice president of business operations for the team, said that about 
85% of last season's 6,000 season-ticket holders renewed and it is expected 
that the team will get enough new season subscribers to keep the total about 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
Roeser said the Clippers plan to keep tickets "reasonably priced" and that it's 
unlikely prices will change drastically until the team gets better and moves to 
a new building in two years. The Clippers are currently working with 
MCA-Spectacor on building a new facility. Two years may be optimistic, however, 
because a site for the arena has not been chosen.

MORNING BRIEFING: CHANGE OF SEASON TAKES TOLL ON ALABAMA RACING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARR KLUENDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of Birmingham Race Course have learned the hard way that football is 
king in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
Their summer meeting was so profitable that track officials decided to seek 
permission to provide racing through December. Now they want to shut down Nov. 
19. 
</P>
<P>
"We will never race against football again," said Stanley Phillips, executive 
vice president of Delaware North, which manages the track. "We made a mistake 
by staying open after Sept. 9." 
</P>
<P>
During the summer meeting, the track averaged $450,000 a day in bets for 75 
days of racing. But during the first six racing days in October, the average 
fell to $197,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been trending downward and there's no sense fighting it," Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
Add horse racing: Ross Peddicord of the Baltimore Evening Sun on the beginning 
of Arabian horse racing at Laurel Race Course in Maryland: "In the first 
Arabian race, Burning Sand, one of the sport's top 3-year-olds (Arabians do not 
race as 2-year-olds), was scratched in the paddock because of discrepancies on 
his foal papers. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be comparable to saying that a top thoroughbred 2-year-old, such as 
Adjudicating, was not really Adjudicating, but a ringer, and finding it out 
after he had already won four of six races and broken a track record. 
</P>
<P>
"According to Patty Kolb, Laurel's identifier for both Arabians and 
thoroughbreds, the discrepancies were not minor, but ones that any 
conscientious official would easily pick up. 
</P>
<P>
" 'The horse was registered as having four dark feet, but one foot was 
striped,' Kolb said. 'He was listed as having three white snips on his nose, 
but only had one. An identifiable cowlick was missing on his left side.' " 
</P>
<P>
Last add horse racing: Birmingham wasn't the only track to feel an autumn 
chill. Paul Moran of Newsday on the recently completed thoroughbred meeting at 
Belmont Park: 
</P>
<P>
"On-track attendance, during a meeting that saw the most important races of 
autumn play to tiny live crowds, was down by about 5% to a disgraceful daily 
average of 10,938 for the 42-day session. Handle, more than $108 million for 
the meeting, was down by 7% on track. New York City OTB was off by about 2.5%." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who was the only pitcher to win at least one World Series game in 
five consecutive years? 
</P>
<P>
Summing it up: Before Sunday's news conference during which postponement of the 
World Series was announced, the Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants 
worked out. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Tony La Russa of the Athletics was saying that former USC star Mark 
McGwire might eventually win a Gold Glove, when a grounder rolled through the 
first baseman's legs. 
</P>
<P>
"Nice play, Mark," La Russa yelled. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 26 other managers I can play for," McGwire joked. 
</P>
<P>
"And I make 27," La Russa shot back. "USC math." 
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, 26 major league teams. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Allie Reynolds of the New York Yankees, 1949-1953. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Coach Buddy Ryan after his Philadelphia Eagles beat the Raiders 
Sunday for their third consecutive victory: "Good teams win three in a row. 
Great teams win four in a row." GARR KLUENDER

PARKER, PEREZ, FORUM WINNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARLY GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A boxing tournament winner made more money than the winner of a world title 
fight, and a clown from a Mexicali circus was a big hit in his Southern 
California debut in a strange boxing show at the Forum Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
In front of a crowd of 7,655, Edward Parker won a unanimous decision over Ken 
Baysmore to win the Forum's super-featherweight tournament, earning $75,000 
Monday night and raising his tournament total to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Later, World Boxing Council bantamweight champion Raul Perez of Tijuana 
defended his championship with a unanimous decision over rugged Diego Avila of 
Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
Then they brought in the clown. Jorge Paez, who works as a clown and an acrobat 
in his parents' Mexicali circus, is waging a campaign to bring pro boxing 
closer to pro wrestling. He entered the ring with a "1" shaved onto the back of 
his head, sweeping chevrons shaved on the sides of his head, and wearing a pony 
tail. 
</P>
<P>
Then he took his robe off, and if they'd turned out the lights you still could 
have seen Paez -- a glimmering, sequin creation that radiated green, orange, 
gold and red. 
</P>
<P>
Paez scored an easy sixth-round TKO over Alan Makatoki of the Philippines. But 
with Paez, winning isn't really his schtick. It's the show that counts, like 
performing mock staggers when his opponent lands an inconsequential blow, 
taunting, sticking out his chin . . . 
</P>
<P>
The crowd seemed to like his act. So, he will probably be back. And he will 
probably make more than the $20,000 he made Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Paez is the International Boxing Federation featherweight champion, but was 
boxing, to use the term loosely, at 135 pounds against Makatoki. 
</P>
<P>
Parker watched the Paez debut with some interest. With a Forum tournament 
championship, he will lobby now for a Forum championship fight against Paez. 
</P>
<P>
Parker seemed for a while to have been punched out after his all-out, 
haymakers-from-everywhere, early-rounds assault on the taller, quicker Baysmore 
failed to put him away. Baysmore (25-3-2) not only survived, but won most of 
the middle rounds. 
</P>
<P>
But Parker (19-3-2) turned the fight around in the eighth. With a minute left 
in the third round, he caught Baysmore with a solid combination and rocked him. 
He pounded Baysmore for the rest of the round but couldn't put him away. 
</P>
<P>
After that, however, what sharpness Baysmore had was gone, as was the crispness 
to his punches. And even when he was sharp, Baysmore never landed a solid right 
to Parker's jaw, which was exposed throughout by his left hand, which he 
carried waist-high. Parker, too, seemed nearly punched out again late in the 
fight, but in the 12th round he somehow pulled up sufficient energy from an 
unknown reservoir, and won the final round going away. When decision was 
announced, Baysmore offered no protest. 
</P>
<P>
Parker's margin was three points on two cards, four on the third. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the greatest moment of my life," Parker said. "I worked hard and 
believe I earned every penny." 
</P>
<P>
Perez (45-1-1), defending his WBC bantamweight title for the third time, was 
meeting an opponent he had barely beaten in 1986. This time, he won another 
unanimous decision over Avila (35-19-3), but with some breathing room. The 
scores were 119-111, 118-110, 115-113.

The Kentucky Supreme Court dealt a legal blow to the state's thoroughbred 
industry by allowing the government-owned lottery agency to proceed with a new 
betting game based on professional football. 
</P>
<P>
In a unanimous ruling, the court dissolved a lower court order won by the 
Kentucky Thoroughbred Assn. that blocked the lottery agency's plans for a game 
based on the results of National Football League games.

Jeff Fuller could move his right arm a little better, and doctors were 
cautiously optimistic that the San Francisco 49er safety's injury was not as 
bad as had been feared. 
</P>
<P>
Fuller was thought to have suffered three broken vertebrae in his neck during 
Sunday's game against New England, threatening his career. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. James Klint of Stanford Hospital said, however, that tests showed no broken 
vertebrae.

Meanwhile, quarterback Joe Montana, who suffered a knee injury against New 
England, is not expected to start Sunday against the New York Jets.

CLIPPERS HAVEN'T SIGNED BENJAMIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Benoit Benjamin's expected return to the National Basketball Assn. was delayed 
at least a day when the free-agent center did not sign a contract with the 
Clippers Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Rothenberg, the Clippers' general counsel, said there is a "decent chance" 
the fifth-year center could rejoin the team today. The sides met Monday but 
could not resolve the details that are preventing Benjamin from returning to 
the Clippers after his aborted move to the Italian League. 
</P>
<P>
No one would comment on the results of Benjamin's physical. Clipper physician 
Tony Daly said not all the information would be available until today. However, 
it is known that Benjamin, who played his best at 250 pounds late last season, 
weighed in at 283. Benjamin, who claims he can be effective at 260 or 265 
pounds after off-season workouts, did show stamina in a 75-minute workout with 
Todd Person, the Clippers' strength and conditioning coach. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Coach Don Casey announced that guard Fred Cofield and forward 
Derrick Gervin had been cut. That puts the roster at 14, not including Benjamin 
and injured Danny Manning. The opening-day limit is 12. The Clippers are 
considering putting rookie guard Jay Edwards, who has yet to play because of 
tendinitis in the knee, on the injured list. SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER

LEACH HOOKS RECORD, BUT FAILS TO LAND GATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jeremy Leach had just reeled in an impressive record, but he couldn't stop 
thinking about the big one that got away. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how the whole season has been going," said the quarterback of New 
Mexico's 1-7 Lobos. "It just hasn't been bouncing our way." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, in only his 17th collegiate game, Leach completed 26 of 38 passes 
for 275 yards and three touchdowns to become the Lobos' career leader in 
passing yardage. 
</P>
<P>
However, it was not cause for celebration. New Mexico dropped a 27-21 decision 
to 20th-ranked Florida in Gainesville. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico, which has lost six in a row, trailed 21-0 before rallying behind 
Leach, a sophomore from Granada Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
Leach hooked up with Terance Mathis for touchdown passes of 11 and 16 yards and 
hit Eric Morgan with a 59-yard scoring strike to cut Florida's lead to six with 
3:52 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The Lobos got the ball back with less than a minute left, but an interception 
by Florida's Will White near midfield secured the Gators' victory. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico gained 323 yards in offense, the most of any Florida opponent this 
season. The Gators had the nation's top-ranked defense entering the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It was nice to be in a game with a tough team," Leach said. "We like to play 
in these kinds of games because we seem to rise against tougher teams. But 
being close hurts because we should have won the game." 
</P>
<P>
The record, it seemed, was little consolation. In 621 career attempts at New 
Mexico, Leach has completed a school-record 327 passes for 4,030 yards. Steve 
Myer, the Lobos' quarterback from 1974-75, held the previous record for 
completions with 295. Billy Rucker, who called New Mexico's signals from 
1984-86, had the standard for yardage with 3,890. 
</P>
<P>
Add passing fancy: With both arms aching from being pounded into the artificial 
turf by Cal State Northridge the previous week, Portland State quarterback 
Darren Del'Andrae managed to set a Western Football Conference record for 
single-game passing yardage in the Vikings' 36-26 upset loss Saturday at 
Southern Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
Del'Andrae, who had been listed as a questionable starter after missing half of 
last week's practices with assorted arm injuries, completed 37 of 53 passes for 
419 yards but threw three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Portland combined with Southern Utah for 1,055 yards in total offense. The 
Vikings gained 615 yards but also had four turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Earthquake aftermath: Cal Lutheran football players were reportedly somewhat 
leery of staying in the earthquake-ravaged Bay Area for their Saturday night 
game at Santa Clara. An aftershock registering 4.8 on the Richter scale rumbled 
through the Peninsula Saturday afternoon, but the game itself was undisturbed 
by seismic activity. 
</P>
<P>
A moment of silence for the victims of the earthquake was observed prior to the 
start of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Passing phase: Claremont's defensive game plan Saturday against Occidental was 
obviously slanted toward stopping tailback Gary Little, the Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference's leading rusher. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental Coach Dale Widolff wasn't surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on this year, you have to say, 'Let's make them throw the ball. They 
haven't shown that they can throw it well,' " Widolff said. 
</P>
<P>
They have now. Tiger quarterback Tony Werbelow completed 11 of 14 passes for 
198 yards. He threw three touchdown passes to tight end David Grossklaus as 
Occidental defeated Claremont, 44-14. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we actually were under our average for attempts," Widolff said. "We 
threw it well. We didn't throw it a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Ups and downs: He has been a starter for only two games, but Glendale College's 
Ronnie Lopez already has experienced the peaks and valleys of junior college 
football. 
</P>
<P>
In his debut as a starter two weeks ago, Lopez passed for 271 yards and two 
touchdowns in a win over Santa Monica. Then, on Saturday, he completed only 
nine of 22 passes for 96 yards with two interceptions in a loss to Los Angeles 
Southwest. In the first half, he completed only two of nine passes. 
Unfortunately for Lopez, one of those completions was to Southwest defensive 
back Lorenzo Dickson, who returned the interception 60 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale receivers didn't help their beleaguered quarterback, either. By Coach 
John Cicuto's count, seven passes were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
"That was just indicative of what kind of game we played today," Lopez said. 
"We dropped some balls that should have been caught, but I also overthrew some 
receivers and misread some coverages. We just didn't have a good day." 
</P>
<P>
Battered and bowed: Cal State Northridge had the Western Football Conference's 
top-rated defense going into Saturday's nonconference game at UC Davis. The 
Matadors were allowing a total of 314.4 yards per game, and only 159.6 through 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
Davis easily surpassed both averages, passing for 253 yards and totaling 402. 
But the Matador defense didn't play that poorly considering the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN started the game without injured nose tackle Tom Gray and safety Dexter 
Byrd. Then, two more starters, corner back Reggie Williams and linebacker Ken 
Wallace, sustained injuries early in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Slow motion: When college football adopted a rule last year giving defenses the 
opportunity to score on intercepted or fumbled conversions, it assured that 
such plays would be memorable. 
</P>
<P>
Such was the case Saturday when West Los Angeles nose guard Demetrius Jennett 
intercepted Pierce holder Mike Knieriem's pass and returned it 95 yards for two 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"The snap was low, and I just followed the (holder) and watched his eyes," 
Jennett said. "When I saw the ball coming, I caught it and ran. I thought I 
would get caught from behind, but after I got a couple of good blocks, I knew 
no one would catch me." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Enger, Pierce's coach, was less than amused by the 5-foot-10, 230-pound 
freshman's lumbering run. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking that I'd like to go out and tackle him," Enger said. "I'm 
faster than he is." 
</P>
<P>
Double duty: Few quarterbacks return kickoffs, but then not many of them have a 
linebacker's mentality and ruggedness which Cal Lutheran freshman Eddie Hoffman 
seems to possess. Hoffman (6-1, 185), one of three quarterbacks Cal Lutheran 
rotates, is the Kingsmen's designated runner and short-yardage man. 
</P>
<P>
He frequently enters the game when Cal Lutheran moves inside the opponent's 
20-yard line, but Saturday night he also was one of the deep men on the kick 
return team. Hoffman returned one kick for 22 yards. He also ran for a 
touchdown and a two-point conversion and picked up 45 rushing yards in nine 
carries. 
</P>
<P>

Brendan Healey contributed to this notebook.

THINGS ONLY GET BETTER FOR WESTMONT SOCCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Fortosis, men's soccer coach at Westmont College, says that at the start of 
the season, he was preparing for the worst. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that he had an impressive record of 84-15-14 in his first six years 
as coach of the Santa Barbara school. Fortosis had a bad feeling about this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were going to be down this year," he said. "There were times 
during training camp when this group scared me. I was thinking this team might 
not win a game." 
</P>
<P>
The coach felt even worse after the team's leading scorer from a year ago, 
forward Rob Ring, broke his leg in training camp and was lost for the season. 
</P>
<P>
It was an ominous sign for Fortosis, who remembered the nightmare of the 1988 
season, when the Warriors lost five starters to knee injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"When he broke his leg, I was thinking, 'Oh no, here we go again,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
But where the Warriors have gone is up. 
</P>
<P>
Fortosis' team has a 13-1-3 record and is ranked No. 1 in the National Assn. of 
Intercollegiate Athletics heading into the final week of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
With a victory over Cal Baptist in its regular-season finale Saturday, the 
Warriors can also wrap up their fourth consecutive title in the 4-year-old 
Golden State Athletic Conference and would be seeded No. 1 in the NAIA District 
3 playoffs next week. 
</P>
<P>
That would also give Westmont an all-time conference record of 26-1. In fact, 
it has been nearly three seasons since the last time the Warriors even allowed 
a goal in a GSAC game. 
</P>
<P>
The team's only loss this season occurred in September against San Jose State, 
a National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division I team. Fortosis pointed out that 
his team scored all of the goals in that 2-1 game. 
</P>
<P>
"We scored both of their goals in that game," he said. "That's a game we should 
have won." 
</P>
<P>
But that was one of the few games about which Fortosis could say that this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors have won even though they have only two seniors and two juniors on 
an 18-player squad. 
</P>
<P>
The coach credits his team's success largely to the right mix. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some close-knit teams in the past, but the blend on this team has 
been very good," Fortosis said. "We've never had a team where their abilities 
and personalities have blended together so well." 
</P>
<P>
Just as important, he says, Westmont has managed to stay relatively unscathed 
by severe injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The team did lose its leading scorer, forward Peter Bourland, with a broken jaw 
early in the season. But Bourland was out of the lineup for only one game. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been able to duck serious injuries," Fortosis says. "I feel like we've 
been one step ahead of the posse when it comes to injuries. So we've been able 
to put lineups together and keep the team going well." 
</P>
<P>
Although the result has been successful, as usual, Fortosis said his approach 
has been a little different this season. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, Westmont was content to play in a defensive mode with a 1-0 lead, 
he said. This year, the Warriors are taking the offensive. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we're playing a lot faster and taking a few more chances," Fortosis said. 
</P>
<P>
That accounts for Westmont averaging about four goals a game, although the 
team's 0.80 goals-against average is a little higher than usual. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives us better balance than before this way," Fortosis said. "Last year it 
was the defense that got us through. I think the hallmark of our team in the 
past has always been defense. But I think this year it's been our ability to 
explode offensively." 
</P>
<P>
There is also more scoring balance, with 10 players who have scored at least 
one goal. 
</P>
<P>
The leader has been Bourland with 14 goals and five assists for 33 points; 
midfielder Darin Fishman with 10 goals and seven assists for 27 points and 
defender Patrik Persson with eight goals and two assists for 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
Another leader has been midfielder Mike Avery. He and Bourland are the only 
seniors on the team. 
</P>
<P>
The team's youth makes Fortosis wonder if the Warriors deserve to be ranked No. 
1 in the nation in the NAIA. 
</P>
<P>
Fortosis said that the team has been taking the middle ground when considering 
the lofty status. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not playing it down and we're not being real boastful about it," he 
said. "It's a nice honor. It's nice to be considered No. 1 by your peers and 
we're just trying to make the most of it." 
</P>
<P>
By the same token, Fortosis said that the ranking puts a heavy burden on his 
players, especially in district games. 
</P>
<P>
"In our district, the Westmont game is everyone's biggest game, anyway," he 
said. "Couple that with the fact that it's a chance to knock off the No. 1 team 
and it makes it very difficult for us." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Fortosis says he doesn't want to trade positions with anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about it after our last game and we'd still rather be the one 
they're chasing," he said. "We like the position we're in." 
</P>
<P>
The Occidental football team continued to make a big impression on the field 
last week with a 44-14 victory over Claremont-Mudd-Scripps. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the fifth in a row for the Tigers, including a forfeit victory 
over Azusa Pacific, and improved their record to 5-1 overall and 3-0 in the 
Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental has also defeated Pomona-Pitzer, La Verne and the University of San 
Diego in its last four games. 
</P>
<P>
The question is whether the Tigers, who were ranked No. 5 in the NCAA Division 
III West Region last week, can make a big enough impression in their last three 
games to earn a berth in the Division III playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers will visit Whittier Saturday night and finish the regular season 
with home games against Redlands on Nov. 4 and another game with Whittier on 
Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, the first-place Tigers are in a solid position to win their third 
consecutive SCIAC title. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa Pacific competes as an NAIA independent, but the Cougars could probably 
make a good case for claiming the SCIAC title, considering that they have 
played four SCIAC teams this season and beaten each of them. 
</P>
<P>
On the field, Azusa has defeated Redlands, La Verne, Whittier and Occidental -- 
although the Cougars forfeited that 14-0 victory over Occidental because they 
used an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
With a loss to the University of San Diego, the Cougars have a 3-2 record this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the Cougars, they do not have any more games this season 
against SCIAC teams. Azusa's final three games are on the road against Menlo, 
Cal Lutheran and UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State Dominguez Hills women's soccer team had a record-setting day in 
its 8-0 victory over Chapman last week. The Toros, ranked No. 2 in the NCAA 
Division II and No. 1 in the West, established team records for goals overall 
and for goals in a single half with seven in the second half. Senior forward 
Kristi White scored two goals and an assist, becoming the school leader in 
points and assists. She has scored 80 points in her career and 29 assists. 
Dominguez Hills, which outshot Chapman, 46-0, has a 15-2 record.

MURPHY CRIES FOUL, BUT FRESNO STATE COACH SAYS THAT'S A FAMILIAR SOUND

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gene Murphy asked his secretary to hold all calls Monday morning, closed his 
door and sat down with a projector and the reels of film that were to give him 
the answers he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
The play-by-play says Cal State Fullerton shot itself in the foot against 
Fresno State Saturday. Murphy says the referees pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
The film says his complaints have some merit. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute involves three plays that sustained a fourth-quarter Fresno State 
drive that ended in a touchdown, turning a seven-point lead into 14 and turning 
Fullerton's hopes of an upset into anger. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy complained after the game, and he was still complaining Monday, even 
though by doing so publicly he is courting a private reprimand from Big West 
Commissioner Jim Haney, even though nothing will change the outcome of the game 
-- a 33-19 Fresno State victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It does sound like sour grapes," Murphy said. "We lost the damn game. They 
beat us. . . . We lost the game in the first half. Period. Officials don't lose 
games for you, but they have something to do with the outcome. They certainly 
did in the fourth quarter." 
</P>
<P>
But Fresno State Coach Jim Sweeney says it's "the same old, same old." 
</P>
<P>
"They were going out of here moaning and crying about the officiating," Sweeney 
said. "Every time we beat them, every single time we beat them, it's 
officiating." 
</P>
<P>
Here are the critical plays, what the coaches say and what the film says: 
</P>
<P>
Roughing the Kicker: On fourth and three at its 47 with 5:28 left to play, 
Fresno State sent Lance Oberparleiter in to punt. The films show Fullerton's 
Darrell Bruce coming across from the left in an attempt to block the kick. 
Oberparleiter gets the kick off, but as he comes down his kicking foot brushes 
Bruce's back, and he falls, twisting to the right. A late flag signals the 
penalty -- 15 yards and a first down. Coupled with a five-yard penalty called 
on Nuygen Pendleton's reception, Fresno State has a first down at the Fullerton 
33. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not roughing the punter," Murphy said. "(Bruce's) body was past him." 
</P>
<P>
An alternative call would have been running into the kicker, which penalizes 
contact that is not blatant and carries a five-yard penalty. But even that 
would have been enough for the first down in this case. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think there should be a call at all," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Even Sweeney said his kicker drew the call by keeping his foot in the air 
longer than usual. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a Laurence Olivier performance," Sweeney said. "This guy, when he got 
hit in the foot, looked like he fell off the Empire State Building." 
</P>
<P>
The Fumble Recovery: The eye in the sky doesn't lie, Murphy likes to say. 
Unfortunately, the film does decline to answer some questions. Fresno State's 
Myron Jones fumbled at the Fullerton 45 with 5:12 left, but it's impossible to 
tell from the film who recovered. Fullerton claims that Terry Tramble recovered 
the fumble, but Sweeney says it was Rich Bartlewski. What is clear on the film 
is referee Tony Corrente's quick and decisive signal -- Fullerton's ball. 
Corrente was the closest official apparent, and signaled not just once, but 
three times immediately. The call was later changed. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as the ball was on the ground, the referee signaled our ball," Murphy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sweeney: "It was a bad call entirely on his part. He had no part doing 
that. All he saw was the ball get stripped. Then he saw Fullerton down on it. 
But the kid was on it with his rump. You don't recover a fumble with your 
rump." 
</P>
<P>
The Personal Foul: On second and 27 from the Fresno 45 with four minutes left, 
the Bulldogs ran a play for a gain of six, but as it ended, Fullerton 
cornerback Tramble was called for a personal foul -- a 15-yard penalty, giving 
Fresno a first down at the 34. Four plays later, the Bulldogs scored the 
touchdown that finalized a 33-19 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"The penalty on Tramble was bull. . . . " Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
The film shows Tramble being blocked as the play is blown dead. Tramble turns 
away, pushing off the blocker, who goes out of bounds forcefully. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a bad call; it was an excellent call," Sweeney said. "I saw the 
block and then (Tramble) slammed him out of bounds." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton had hoped to get the ball back, trailing by seven. A touchdown and a 
two-point conversion -- Fullerton already had made two-point conversions twice 
in the game -- could have given the Titans a very big upset. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we wouldn't score," Murphy said. "But what they did was they took the 
opportunity away." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy has requested a Big West observer to review the films, but the point is 
moot. The calls were made, Fresno scored and remained undefeated, and Fullerton 
is 3-4-1 and must win all three remaining games to have a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney, with all the swaggering confidence that his opponents find 
infuriating, says the dispute is pointless. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had to play them 10 times, we'd beat them 10 times," Sweeney said. "It 
wasn't a refereeing contest. It was a football contest." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Cox, the Fresno State outside linebacker who had 17 tackles, six sacks and 
caused two fumbles against Fullerton, was named the Big West defensive player 
of the week. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State running back Aaron Craver, who averaged 6.5 yards a carry in 
gaining 124 yards against the Titans, shared the offensive award with San Jose 
State running back Sheldon Canley, who had 164 yards in a 21-10 victory over 
Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton in NCAA statistics: Mike Pringle is first in all-purpose rushing, 
ninth in rushing, fourth in scoring and 17th in kickoff returns. Dan Speltz is 
sixth in passing efficiency and ninth in total offense. Rocky Palamara is 
eighth in receiving.

<P>
El Toro High School has replaced Mission Viejo as the top-ranked team in the 
Orange County Sportswriters' Assn. prep football poll after Mission Viejo's 
27-14 loss to Capistrano Valley last week. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo, ranked first for four consecutive weeks, dropped to fourth in 
the poll and Capistrano Valley moved from third to second. Only five teams -- 
El Toro, Capistrano Valley, Sunny Hills, Estancia and Whittier Christian -- are 
unbeaten and untied after seven weeks.

BROWNS SHOW DITKA THE FLIP SIDE, 27-7

<P>
Now Mike Ditka knows how the other half lives. 
</P>
<P>
Make that the other 99%. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in Ditka's seven years as head coach, the Chicago Bears are 
on a three-game losing streak, courtesy of a 27-7 drubbing administered Monday 
night by the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like a day of reckoning -- not a day of atonement, but a day of 
reckoning." Ditka said after Bernie Kosar completed 22 of 29 passes for 281 
yards, including a 97-yard touchdown pass to Webster Slaughter and a three-yard 
toss to Eric Metcalf, who also ran seven yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
It's the first such streak for the injury-ravaged Bears, who started four 
rookies on defense, since Nov. 15-26, 1981, the year before Ditka took over and 
turned the team into one of the National Football League's most dominant teams. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, their 4-3 record drops them a game behind Minnesota in the NFC Central 
Division, the first time they've been out of first place in the division since 
the final game of the 1983 season -- 85 games ago. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike last week, when he exploded after a loss to Houston and suggested 
the Bears might not win again, he was more optimistic, praising his defense, 
which has allowed 102 points the past three weeks after surrendering just 61 in 
the opening four wins. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in them and I believe we can turn it around," said Ditka, whose team 
plays the Rams at home next week in a game that could have huge playoff 
ramifications for a team that's made the playoffs the last five years. "I'm 
more encouraged today than I have been the last two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
They also have respect. 
</P>
<P>
"When you beat a team like Chicago on a Monday night, that's something," said 
Michael Dean Perry, who led the defensive effort for the Browns, who broke 
their own two-game losing streak and moved into a three-way tie at 4-3 with 
Cincinnati and Houston in the AFC Central. 
</P>
<P>
Perry, whose brother, William, plays for the Bears, led a defense that knocked 
Mike Tomczak from the game late in the third quarter after he went four of 14 
for 76 yards. They also stopped the Bears on Cleveland's two-yard line midway 
through the third quarter. One play later, Kosar hit Slaughter on the 97-yard 
scoring pass play that was the longest play from scrimmage in Brown history. 
</P>
<P>
The call was made by offensive coordinator Marc Trestman, who was under fire in 
the past two weeks as the Browns scored just 17 points in two defeats. And it 
redeemed Kosar, who last week had four passes intercepted in a 17-7 loss to 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter had eight catches for 186 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's only touchdown came on a five-yard pass from Jim Harbaugh to Wendell 
Davis with 3:47 left.

NFL OWNERS TO VOTE FOR COMMISSIONER

<P>
Team owners will try again today to elect Pete Rozelle's successor as 
commissioner of the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
Most of them believe that Jim Finks and Paul Tagliabue are the only viable 
candidates, and some believe that Tagliabue will win in what is scheduled as a 
two-day meeting here. 
</P>
<P>
An NFL lawyer, Tagliabue got 13 votes earlier this month when 13 others voted 
for Finks, general manager of the New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue has been coming up, and Finks has been going down after peaking with 
16 votes at the first meeting July 6 in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
At Dallas two weeks ago, Finks lost one vote on the first ballot and two more 
on the final ballot. 
</P>
<P>
It takes 19 to be elected. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue is the choice of most of the 11 owners who blocked Finks at the 
Chicago meeting, although they weren't so much for Tagliabue as they were 
voting against Finks. 
</P>
<P>
The 16 who supported Finks in Chicago were led by Wellington Mara of the New 
York Giants and Art Modell of the Cleveland Browns. Mara is still in Finks' 
corner but Modell seems to be wavering. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing now isn't just to elect a commissioner, it's to 
reunify the (owners)," Modell said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Other formerly strong Finks supporters -- Lamar Hunt of Kansas City and Mike 
McCaskey of Chicago -- may also be shifting their support. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have two very good candidates," Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
Said McCaskey: "We're lucky to have two such good candidates." 
</P>
<P>
If they have now decided to switch votes, Tagliabue will be elected on the 
first ballot today, possibly before noon. 
</P>
<P>
But with NFL owners, you never know. It took 26 ballots to elect Rozelle 30 
years ago. BOB OATES

GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: KURAGAMI SWEEPS HER WAY TO TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cindy Kuragami is the top singles player on the Savanna High School girls' 
tennis team. And that's right where she wants to be. 
</P>
<P>
But she has kept that part of her life in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"Tennis never gets in the way of studies, but not vice versa," Kuragami said. 
"Ever since I started playing, my family has emphasized studies." 
</P>
<P>
Kuragami, The Times' Athlete of the Week, is a rare athlete who considers 
sports an extra-curricular activity. 
</P>
<P>
Although there's great money to be had by young tennis players. There are 
chances to travel Europe, play tennis and get paid for it. 
</P>
<P>
But Kuragami says that such aspirations are a bit off in her case. She's not 
sure if she can go that far on her talent and she is concerned about a college 
education. 
</P>
<P>
She has been working off-and-on with a private coach and, more than anything 
else, has learned she must accept her limitations. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a strong serve -- and part of that is because of my size 
(5-foot-1 1/2, 107 pounds) -- but I try to make up for that in other ways. I'm 
working on placing my serves. I try to slice my serves, spin serves and I have 
a flat serve. It's coming along slowly." 
</P>
<P>
Which might come as a surprise to her Orange League opponents. Last week was a 
typical week for Kuragami. She swept her sets, 6-0, 6-0, 6-0, on Thursday in a 
13-5 victory over Magnolia, and swept 6-1, 6-0, 6-0 in a loss to Western 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
She also sweeps through her classes as exemplified by her 4.0 grade-point 
average. 
</P>
<P>
"I've talked with some of her teachers, and they say, 'She doesn't get most of 
the points in class -- she gets all of them,' " Savanna Coach Eric Hansen said. 
"At practice, she shares everything she knows and hits with anyone who wants to 
hit -- it's like having an extra coach out there." 
</P>
<P>
That is considerably high praise for a 15-year-old. Kuragami skipped the second 
grade and is still leaving her peers behind. 
</P>
<P>
Kuragami has been a standout player on a mediocre team. She has a set record of 
48-0 this season, while Savanna has a team record of 7-7 overall, 5-3 in league 
play. And the Orange League has an overall quality of tennis that tends to make 
Kuragami appear to be a big fish in a small pond. 
</P>
<P>
Kuragami is ranked ninth by the Southern California Tennis Assn. for ages 16 
and under and is 40th in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Including nonleague matches, Kuragami has lost only one set, when she was a 
freshman, at Savanna. In the past two years, her only other losses have been in 
the third round of the Southern Section tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps what really sets Kuragami apart is that she's not just another 
hard-working-athlete-student-robot type. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, she's outgoing and liked very well by, it seems like, everyone," Hansen 
said. "She really is a wonderful person." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Kuragami wants to attend Stanford because of its reputation 
for academics and for its top women's tennis program. "But I would weigh any 
offers I would get," Kuragami said. "I hope my grades will help me get some 
offers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Berkowitz of Fountain Valley swept her matches, 6-0, 6-0, 6-0, against 
Ocean View Tuesday and swept 6-1, 6-0, 6-0 against Huntington Beach Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Herb of Rosary had 31 blocks in a 14-16, 15-10, 9-15, 15-12, 15-10

QINTEX AUSTRALIA PLANS BIG SALE OF ASSETS TO CUT DEBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS , MICHAEL FLAGG,TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The drama mounted for the Australian Qintex group Monday with the announcement 
that the firm -- which failed two weeks ago to make good on its $1.5-billion 
bid for MGM/UA Communications -- now intends to sell off $600 million 
(Australian) in assets to reduce a crushing debt burden. 
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was listed at 77 cents on currency exchanges Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The financial restructuring was announced after trading was halted Monday on 
the Australian Stock Exchange while regulators awaited answers to their 
questions about the group's obligations to Qintex Entertainment Inc., a 
43%-owned affiliate that sought the protection of bankruptcy court in Los 
Angeles late last week. 
</P>
<P>
Before trading halted, shares of Qintex Australia had plunged to 16 cents 
(Australian) from 33 cents on Friday. The price of Qintex Ltd., which owns 55% 
of Qintex Australia, dropped to $1.50 (Australian) from $3.05 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, two outside Qintex directors resigned rather than 
approve payments to senior executives, Qintex Chairman Christopher C. Skase 
disclosed. The disagreement arose over certain fees claimed by a 
management-services company in which the executives have an interest. For the 
year ended July 31, Qintex Australia paid the management company $32.6 million 
(Australian). The resigning directors were identified as Fred Davey and Ted 
Harris. 
</P>
<P>
The assets marked for sale include three Australian television stations and 
Qintex's remaining 51% stake in Mirage Resorts in Australia and Hawaii, but a 
company official said the firm will press ahead with its Dana Point resort 
project in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex Australia Ltd. and Qintex Ltd. together have debt of about $1.4 billion 
(Australian), according to two analysts at Australian brokerage firms. With 
interest rates of 18% to 20% in Australia, the debt burden became intolerable 
to broadcasters such as Qintex, which acquired stations in a euphoric period 
two years ago only to be disappointed by slower-than-expected advertising 
growth and high programming costs. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex's resort business also has been hammered since Australian pilots began a 
strike in late August that reduced tourism revenue by as much as 32% in 
September from a year earlier, one analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too early to say whether (Skase) can survive," said Edward Falkiner, head 
of research in the New York office of Ord Minnett, an Australian securities 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
Skase "will certainly try," said Viktor Shvets, an analyst with Capel Court 
Powell Ltd. "One of the good things about Qintex is it certainly has 
top-quality assets." 
</P>
<P>
And -- until Skase bid for MGM/UA -- the Qintex chairman appeared to be a more 
frugal buyer of Australian assets, according to Shvets. Skase paid about $64 
per viewer for his television stations, in contrast to $90 to $100 paid by his 
two largest competitors, the analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
"Until he met (MGM/UA majority shareholder Kirk) Kerkorian, he was paying the 
right prices," Shvets said. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-September, Skase outbid Rupert Murdoch for MGM/UA by offering to pay $25 
per share. As part of the "irrevocable" deal, he promised to deliver a 
$50-million letter of credit by Sept. 22. The letter was never delivered, 
however, and on Oct. 10 the deal collapsed amid rancorous accusations and a 
MGM/UA lawsuit accusing the Australian Qintex firm of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the MGM/UA deal was one problem cited Monday by Skase, without 
elaboration. But analysts pointed out that Qintex had apparently counted on 
MGM/UA's cash -- estimated at $145 million -- to help address Qintex's 
short-term cash flow problems. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts were still reeling from the Qintex Entertainment bankruptcy 
filing last week, because they believed the U.S. company had the Australian's 
group full backing. When a $5.9-million payment to MCA Inc. came due, however, 
Qintex Entertainment sought the court's protection because -- even with the 
help of Qintex Australia -- financing could not be arranged, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
One of Qintex's most visible assets remains the Dana Point resort project in 
Orange County, which an official described as a top priority now that the 
MGM/UA deal has collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very important to the company," said a Qintex official. "It's an 
opportunity that can't be replaced at any price." 
</P>
<P>
The company said it is still negotiating for financial backing in Dana Point 
with two Japanese companies, Mitsui &amp; Co. and Nippon Shinpan Co., which 
already own 49% of the three resorts in Australia and Hawaii that Qintex says 
it's selling. The two companies paid $350 million for the three resorts in 
March. As part of the deal, they got first crack at buying half of the Dana 
Point resort. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex bought two sites in the beach town for about $247 million this summer 
and plans to build a resort for affluent guests.

PENTAGON CONCERNED ABOUT EFFECTS OF THE 'BIG ONE'; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: OFFICIALS, WORRIED ABOUT THE CONCENTRATION OF WEAPONS-MAKING PLANTS IN

<P>
Even as the Bay Area begins to recover from Tuesday's earthquake, some Pentagon 
officials are trembling at the prospect of a still-deadlier temblor in the 
heart of the nation's defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
Damage to most of the area's 900 defense contractors was relatively light, and 
weapons giants such as Lockheed Corp. and Ford Aerospace reported that 
employees are back at work and defense programs are back on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
But those responsible for ensuring the health of the nation's 
weapons-production capability point to the concentration of defense plants in 
earthquake-prone California and warn that quakes are not only human tragedies 
but a national security problem too. 
</P>
<P>
"If an 8.3 (magnitude) earthquake strikes California, it will not only be a 
California but a national disaster," Richard E. Donnelly, assistant secretary 
of defense for acquisition and logistics, told an industry group studying the 
problem in 1986. "It is conceivable the President would declare a national 
emergency and place U.S. forces on alert." 
</P>
<P>
Experts warn that California's more than 5,000 defense contractors -- 
representing more than 50% of the nation's missile and space business and about 
75% of the domestic microchip industry -- must take further precautions to 
prepare for the "big one" that scientists believe is likely to strike in the 
next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
A March, 1989, white paper prepared by the American Defense Preparedness Assn., 
a Washington-based industry group, concluded that "only 5% of the companies in 
earthquake-prone California are estimated to be adequately prepared to cope 
with earthquakes that could potentially wipe out their computer facilities and 
operational capabilities." 
</P>
<P>
"We industrial-base fanatics are never satisfied," Donnelly said in an 
interview. "But in the past decade, there's been a substantial improvement. . . 
. We think the system is working." 
</P>
<P>
Donnelly said the Pentagon, working with contractors through the Business and 
Industry Council on Earthquake Preparedness, has helped encourage and guide 
defense firms to take voluntary measures to protect their ability to produce in 
the wake of an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
But some, including the members of the ADPA, believe that the Defense 
Department should move more aggressively to protect the nation's weapon-making 
capacity, requiring earthquake preparations as a condition for doing business 
with the Pentagon and looking outside the vulnerable quake zone for alternative 
manufacturers for certain systems. 
</P>
<P>
Donnelly said such measures go beyond the Pentagon's existing power over 
contractors. He said the Pentagon's most effective earthquake initiative has 
been a system of monitoring the locations and activities of defense 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday evening, Donnelly's office used a new database called DINET -- 
short for defense industrial network -- to identify those companies and defense 
programs that might be affected by disasters. The database had been used in 
Pentagon "command post exercises" but was used for the first time in a real 
disaster when Hurricane Hugo struck the South Carolina coast. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, DINET gave defense officials the names of 900 Bay Area firms 
likely to be affected by the quake, as well as the defense programs that might 
first be delayed if production lines shut down. Donnelly said the Pentagon had 
not received reports of substantial disruptions in equipment deliveries as a 
result of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
But in Southern California, where the concentration of defense contractors is 
greater than in the Bay Area, the delays could be severe -- and costly -- in 
event of a major temblor, the ADPA group warned. 
</P>
<P>
A 1986 Defense Department survey of 32 major contractors in the Los Angeles 
quake zone indicated that an earthquake measuring more than 8 on the Richter 
scale would cause delays in the delivery of equipment ranging from two months 
to more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
Companies that rely heavily on robotics and automated production have the most 
urgent need to make earthquake preparations, warned the ADPA white paper, which 
was prepared under the direction of Northrop Corp. disaster planner Nelson Cyr. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, at FMC Corp.'s San Jose and Santa Clara production plants, where 
armored troop carriers and fighting vehicles are produced, engineers worked 
quickly to check and recalibrate automated equipment by Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But contractors who specialize in delicate, hand-assembled equipment have 
challenges of their own. At Ford Aerospace's satellite assembly facility in 
Palo Alto, satellites withstood the quake atop a 40-foot thick block of 
concrete set on pilings that are sunk deep into the bedrock, according to Ford 
spokesman Susan Pearce.

ASHTON-TATE TAKES IT ON THE CHIN BUT VOWS A COMEBACK; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: ONCE A SUPERSTAR IN SOFTWARE, THE TORRANCE-BASED FIRM IS BATTLING 
TO RECOUP LOSSES FROM A FLAWED DATABASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.

<P>
Ed Esber is sick of the comparisons and snide asides about his previous stint 
at a failed software publishing house. He is tired of Wall Street analysts who 
have made an art of second-guessing his management of Torrance-based software 
publisher Ashton-Tate. 
</P>
<P>
And he has no patience for those who automatically assume that just because a 
company has lost nearly $40 million in six months and is being squeezed by 
aggressive competitors, its days are numbered. 
</P>
<P>
"It's true we've been hit hard and we're down on the mat," concedes Edward 
Esber, Ashton-Tate's 37-year-old chairman and president. "But don't you dare 
for a minute think we're knocked out. We're just catching our breath. We'll be 
back." 
</P>
<P>
It's going to take more than Esber's tough talk and promises to persuade a 
growing number of skeptics that Ashton-Tate isn't a punch-drunk champ down for 
the count. There are just too many faded software superstars offering ample 
precedent. 
</P>
<P>
VisiCorp, the now-defunct software publisher for which Esber worked as a 
marketing manager in the early 1980s, dominated the early market for personal 
computer financial spreadsheets with its VisiCalc program, only to lose it all 
to rivals, notably Lotus Development Corp. MicroPro's WordStar was a leader 
among PC word processors early on until more aggressive and sophisticated 
programs stole the market, leaving the company to limp along. 
</P>
<P>
Ashton-Tate, a 10-year-old company that pioneered what is now a 
$500-million-a-year market for PC database management software, has recently 
slipped to fourth place among PC software publishers, and its share of the 
database market, once an enviable 80% or more, has dropped to 60%, analysts 
say. Sales last quarter fell to $53.9 million, 28% below those of the year-ago 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Ashton-Tate is retelling the classic story of high-technology companies," says 
Peter Rogers, an analyst at Robertson Stephens &amp; Co., a San Francisco 
brokerage. "A company has a good, solid franchise and then gets complacent. It 
doesn't serve its customers well and doesn't keep up with technology. Then the 
competition gets in and it loses big. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I see it, Ashton-Tate has neglected its franchise, and the competition 
is closing in," Rogers adds. "The future is very uncertain." 
</P>
<P>
Although many analysts say Ashton-Tate's problems have been building for years, 
events of the past year touched off its current woes. 
</P>
<P>
It started last Halloween with the release of dBase IV, an updated version of 
the database management program that has been the company's bedrock and source 
of the vast majority of its revenues since its inception. The program, 
initially released in 1982, allows personal computers to sort, index and store 
vast quantities of information. 
</P>
<P>
Although complaints about "bugs" -- computer lingo for mistakes -- seriously 
undermined acceptance of dBase IV, the company continued to push the product on 
its distributors in the mistaken notion that it would eventually gain a strong 
following. Instead, about six months worth of overstock piled up on 
distributors' shelves, where some still remains. The result: Losses totaling 
$39.2 million in the past six months and no immediate sign that the red ink has 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the company's problems is an increase in competition among database 
programs, particularly from low-cost imitators, and a slowing of the 
once-torrid sales pace of personal computer software during the past year. And 
at the same time, the introduction of more powerful desk-top computers is 
creating a need for more sophisticated database management software, a need, 
some analysts contend, that Ashton-Tate cannot serve. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they are becoming and will continue to be a slowly declining player in 
the database market," says Jeffrey Tarter, publisher of Soft* Letter, a 
software marketing publication. "And I don't see how they can turn it around." 
</P>
<P>
The problem, as Tarter and other see it, is that Ashton-Tate does not have the 
in-house technology to fend off competing products, which are either cheaper or 
more sophisticated, or both. Several analysts note that the company has never 
developed a new product from scratch in its labs. Its entire product lineup, 
including the original dBase program, have all been purchased from outside 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
"They do not have a technology development operation," Tarter argues. "They 
talk a good game, but it just isn't there. They are a marketing-driven company. 
Now they have some real competition, and their technology weaknesses are really 
showing." 
</P>
<P>
Other analysts suggest that Ashton-Tate, whose stock closed Monday on the 
over-the-counter market at $10.75, down 12.5 cents, might be an ideal merger 
partner for another software publisher. David Bayer of Montgomery Securities in 
San Francisco notes that the company's assets include $80 million in cash and 3 
million users of its dBase products. 
</P>
<P>
"For the right company, you could make the argument that there is value here 
that could be exploited," Bayer says. 
</P>
<P>
Esber, a Harvard-trained MBA who joined Ashton-Tate in 1984 and successfully 
steered it through similar problems three years ago, dismisses merger talk as 
meaningless speculation. He contends that the company has what it takes to 
remain the market leader, but has merely failed to communicate its message to 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
"Who cares if you develop your products in-house or you buy them from others, 
so long as they are successful?" he thunders. "What we have to do is better 
market our software and help our customers understand what our products do and 
what our competitors' products don't do." 
</P>
<P>
Esber is betting heavily that company fortunes will rebound early next year 
when it releases a new, improved version of dBase IV. The program is undergoing 
extensive quality control testing and evaluation, a step that the company 
acknowledges was omitted last year in the push to get the first dBase IV 
program out the door. 
</P>
<P>
As it has in the past, the company is also stepping up efforts to increase 
sales of its other software products, most of which have generally fared poorly 
in the market. The goal is to reduce the company's reliance on dBase as a 
source of revenue. However, similar efforts in the past have flopped; dBase 
still routinely accounts for 60% to 70% of the company's sales. 
</P>
<P>
Esber also notes that the company has already laid off about 300 employees and 
trimmed spending in a bid to restore profitability. Further, he contends that 
its $80-million bank account can tide the company over until his strategy takes 
hold. 
</P>
<P>
And when it works, he predicts, the analysts who have been bashing the company 
for the past several months will reverse themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll look back and say: 'Wasn't that a brilliant strategy,' " Esber 
predicts. "But all I ask for now is time. Give me a year. Be patient with me. 
And don't count me out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
This has been a tough year for many software publishers. Fast-moving personal 
computer technology, a shrinking number of distributors and customer confusion 
have combined to dramatically slow PC software sales. Ashton-Tate has 
compounded these problems with some missteps of its own.

UAL DIRECTORS CHILL ANY EFFORT TO REVIVE BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UAL Corp.'s non-management directors said Monday that the company should remain 
independent, ending efforts by an employee-management group to revive its bid 
for the parent of United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The directors, speaking for the entire board, said the group's failed 
$300-a-share offer had been in the best interests of shareholders -- a 
statement that suggests the board won't entertain a lower bid. UAL stock closed 
Monday at $178.36 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, up $9.88 on 
speculation about a new bid. The directors' statement came after the close of 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
Frederick C. Dubinsky, head of United's pilot union, said he was disappointed 
that UAL's board refused to negotiate a revised bid with the employee group. 
"Should the board change its views and be willing to discuss a transaction in 
which employees would obtain a significant majority ownership, we remain 
willing to participate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf on Monday indicated that his role in the takeover 
effort was over, at least for now. He said in a statement that he hoped the 
airline's workers would "now turn their full attention to operating the best 
airline in the world." 
</P>
<P>
United's flight attendants had no immediate comment on the board's decision, 
although its unlikely the attendants would pursue a bid without the pilots. The 
pilots and flight attendants could try to negotiate an ownership stake in 
contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The $6.75-billion bid for the nation's second-largest airline fell apart Oct. 
13, when United's pilots and top managers failed to come up with the financing 
needed to fund the takeover. The takeover group was dealt another, perhaps 
fatal, blow last week when its equity partner, British Airways, said it was 
pulling out of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
The buyout group worked with its advisers over the weekend to come up with a 
new, lower offer, but it was unable to find a partner willing to replace 
British Airways' $750-million equity contribution. The takeover would have 
created the nation's largest employee-owned company, with 85% of United's stock 
in employee hands. 
</P>
<P>
Though non-management directors, speaking for the entire board, clearly 
discouraged a sale of the company, they didn't close the door entirely. In a 
statement, the board said it intends to explore "all strategic and financial 
alternatives" to "maximize shareholder value." 
</P>
<P>
With the employee group in disarray, there was speculation that Los Angeles 
billionaire Marvin Davis might revive his effort to acquire the airline. Davis' 
original $240-a-share bid in August set in motion events that led to the 
proposed employee buyout. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Davis said he was exploring ways to finance a bid. A source 
close to Davis said it was possible that the failed employee bid "poisoned the 
well too badly" for anyone to raise cash quickly for another offer. Davis and 
the employee group share the same banker, Citibank. 
</P>
<P>
Others close to the situation doubted that Davis would make a new offer. 
"Marvin Davis wasn't real and isn't real," said Brian Freeman, an adviser to 
United's machinists union, a group that opposed the employee buyout. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf tried to put the best face on the failed takeover by citing a 
"substantially improved working relationship" between management and United's 
pilots union. Both groups had put aside old antagonisms to work on the buyout 
effort, and the pilots agreed to a tentative contract that included increased 
productivity. For example, pilots agreed to fly a Boeing 757 aircraft that had 
sat idle until the buyout effort got under way. 
</P>
<P>
There was speculation Monday that the failure of the Wolf-led buyout might 
undermine Wolf's relationship with employees. The pilots and flight attendants, 
who joined the buyout group last week, might blame him for the bid's failure, 
some said. When told that Wolf thought the takeover experience had strengthened 
his relationship with employees, Freeman said, "He should be a stand-up 
comedian."

GE UNIT UNVEILS HOUSE BUILT IN MATERIAL OF THE FUTURE -- PLASTIC 
</P>

The house that high-performance plastics helped build was unveiled Monday, a 
gracious Colonial dwelling with some decidedly 21st-Century, dream house 
technology tucked behind its facade. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very excited in sharing with you what we feel the future of home 
ownership is," Uwe Wascher, vice president of marketing for GE Plastics, said 
at the opening of the Living Environments Concept House at the division's 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
General Electric officials were quick to point out that the engineering 
plastics used in the house have little in common with the stuff of toys or with 
the highly futuristic, space-age type of plastic housing that has been 
experimented with during the past 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
About one-third of the light-beige house is plastic. The total cost is 
estimated at $10 million, but that includes research and model development. 
</P>
<P>
The engineering plastics used typically have high melting points, create little 
smoke when they burn and have good sound-deadening properties. But the home is 
so airtight it requires strong ventilating systems. 
</P>
<P>
The house has curved bay windows, generous decks and huge atrium windows in 
front and back. It is clearly in the dream house category, with such amenities 
as double showers that convert to steam rooms, power windows and movable walls. 
</P>
<P>
Tour guides showed off some of the features, such as a 50-gallon reservoir in 
the basement in case of drought, liquid quartz technology to make naked windows 
opaque and refrigeration systems set into the kitchen walls. 
</P>
<P>
Cutaway sections throughout the house showed the plastics molded into walls and 
floors and, in one bathroom, the tub was sliced in two, right down to a 
bisected rubber duck. 
</P>
<P>
GE officials say the house will be a laboratory for exploring the use of 
engineering polymers in construction markets but that it also contains some 
practical concepts already in use. Roof tile panels of high-performance 
plastics are already on the market, as are some of the window units, which 
feature snap-in moldings. 
</P>
<P>
"You get used to it. You don't paint it, you just replace it," said tour guide 
Rob Gillette. 
</P>
<P>
The 3,000-square-foot, two-story house, with a split-level basement, was built 
for a family of four, with a large master bedroom luxuriously appointed with a 
Jacuzzi, window seat and state-of-the-art Japanese toilets featuring a built-in 
exhaust fan and automatic bidet. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials conceded that it will be some time before all of the 
innovations in the concept house become commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think we can change the industry overnight," Dickens said. 
</P>
<P>
The plastics used in the building are now two to 10 times more expensive than 
traditional building materials, but GE expects them to become competitive as 
builders look toward prefabricated and component assembly to hold down costs. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the plastic construction, which may feature prefab wall panels 
complete with insulation and siding that snaps together, will provide a more 
efficient way of building, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 45,000 pounds of plastics are used in the house in such areas as the 
roof, windows, siding, plumbing, foundation and electrical and mechanical 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
But much of the visible material in the house is unabashedly traditional, such 
as the maple floors, and company officials said that was intentional. 
</P>
<P>
"We never intended to replace all wood, glass, stone and steel," Wascher said.

Five major oil companies reported mixed quarterly results Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Earnings were down at Exxon Corp., Phillips Petroleum Co. and Atlantic 
Richfield Co. Occidental Petroleum Corp. said earnings rose slightly. Amerada 
Hess Corp., bucking the trend, said earnings more than doubled. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said higher worldwide crude oil prices partly offset weaker refining 
margins due to a fall in gasoline prices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM 
</P>
<P>
Net Totals $108 Million 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based Occidental earned $108 million in the third quarter, up from 
$105 million a year earlier. Revenue declined 2% to $4.8 billion from $4.9 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental's nine-month earnings dropped 14% to $255 million, compared to $295 
million in the same 1988 period. Revenue rose 6% to $15 billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ARCO 
</P>
<P>
Profit Is Down 3% 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based Arco earned $379 million in the quarter, down 3% from $391 
million the year before. Arco's revenue totaled $3.7 billion, down 20% from 
$4.6 billion in the 1988 third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Arco's nine-month earnings rose 33% to $1.6 billion, compared to $1.2 billion a 
year earlier; revenue declined 13% to $12 billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PHILLIPS PETROLEUM 
</P>
<P>
Income Declines 60% 
</P>
<P>
Phillips Petroleum's earnings dropped 60% to $87 million from $215 million a 
year earlier. Revenue for the Bartlesville, Okla., company rose 7% to $3.1 
billion from $2.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
For the nine months, Phillips earned $474 million, down 8% from $515 million a 
year earlier. Revenue rose 10% to $9.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
EXXON 
</P>
<P>
Income Drops 9% 
</P>
<P>
New York-based Exxon, the nation's largest oil company, said it earned $1.1 
billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, down 9% from $1.2 billion a year 
earlier. Revenue totaled $23.6 billion, up 8% from last year's $21.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months, earnings fell 34.5% to $2.54 billion from $3.88 
billion. The lower nine-month earnings reflected the company's provision for 
the March 24 Alaska oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
AMERADA HESS 
</P>
<P>
Net More Than Triples 
</P>
<P>
New York-based Amerada Hess' third-quarter earnings jumped to $51.8 million 
from $15.8 million, reflecting much stronger refining and marketing segments 
that bucked the general trend in the industry. The company also benefited from 
unused tax credits of years past. 
</P>
<P>
The third-quarter results included a charge of $30 million, associated with 
expenses from a refinery shutdown in the Virgin Islands during Hurricane Hugo. 
</P>
<P>
Amerada Hess' third-quarter revenue rose to $1.2 billion, up 28% from $925 
million in the same 1988 period. 
</P>
<P>
Amerada Hess' nine-month earnings jumped to $406 million, from $57.9 million. 
Revenue totaled $4 billion, up 35%.

State Farm to Have Underwriting Loss: State Farm Insurance Group, the largest 
home insurer in California, said it will suffer an underwriting loss of about 
$1 billion after the twin disasters of the San Francisco earthquake and 
Hurricane Hugo. State Farm expects to pay out about $300 million to cover 
insured damage suffered in last Tuesday's earthquake, said Ed Rust, president 
and chief executive of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. But the total 
could go higher as damage appraisals continue over the coming weeks, he said.

TIME WARNER POSTS LOSS OF $176 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Time Warner Inc., reporting its earnings for the first time since Time Inc. 
acquired control of Warner Communications, said it lost $176 million on revenue 
of $2.2 billion for the third quarter ended Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner's loss was due in large part to interest expenses incurred as Time 
bought 100 million Warner shares, as well as the heavy costs of paying for 
Warner's executive compensation plans and the amortization of goodwill made as 
part of the acquisition. Under terms of the merger, Warner Chairman Steven J. 
Ross is entitled to receive compensation of up to $180 million over eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Included in Time Warner's numbers were two months of financial results for 
Warner, which was 59.3% owned by Time Inc. in August and September. Warner 
released separate financial results Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner's interest expense for the three months came to $216 million, while 
the amortization of goodwill amounted to $40 million. Goodwill is the 
difference between the purchase price of an asset such as Warner and its value 
as carried on the accounting books. The difference is amortized, or written off 
as a non-cash expense, by the acquiring company over many years. 
</P>
<P>
Warner's results include a $120-million charge related to the cost of the 
executive compensation plans. Overall, Warner reported a loss of $106 million 
for the period on revenue of $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
John Tinker, analyst with the New York investment bank Morgan Stanley &amp; 
Co., said while the results were not unexpected, the size of the loss "does 
take you a little aback." Warner officials met with stock analysts Monday night 
to discuss the figures and to explain their contention that the figures show 
the combined company will be able to comfortably pay its $12 billion in debt. 
</P>
<P>
To shed more light on the combined company's recent operating performance, Time 
Warner also calculated pro forma results that assume that Warner was 100% owned 
by Time Inc. on Jan. 1, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The pro forma results show that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation 
and amortization -- a category often called operating cash flow -- came to $526 
million in the third quarter. By comparison, the two companies' operating cash 
flow would have been $242 million in the hypothetical third period of 1988.

Prime Computer Inc. announced Monday that it would lay off 2,500 employees, or 
nearly 20% of its work force, as part of a restructuring designed to put the 
company back on its feet following a 10-month anti-takeover battle. 
</P>
<P>
The minicomputer maker also will divide its operations into four departments, 
or "profit centers," said spokesman Joe Gavaghan. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy by Prime, based in suburban Natick, Mass., is part of a plan to 
reduce the $1-billion debt it incurred when J. H. Whitney &amp; Co., a New York 
investment firm, purchased the company and ended its battle with hostile bidder 
MAI Basic Four Inc. of Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
The layoffs, which will occur worldwide, will take place as each department 
adopts the restructuring plan, Gavaghan said.

BUSH TO SEEK GLOBAL FARM SUBSIDY CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration is expected to unveil a formal proposal this week for a 
"substantial, progressive reduction" of farm subsidies worldwide over the next 
several years as part of the global trade liberalization talks under way in 
Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, it calls for all agriculture-producing countries to convert their 
quotas and other trade barriers into numerical tariffs -- which are easier to 
compare -- and phase out entirely within five years those that distort world 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
The United States also wants to muster support for revamping existing farm 
subsidies so that payments to farmers are made independently of the size of the 
crop that these farmers produce. U.S. officials charge that the links in place 
encourage overproduction. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, the Administration wants trading countries to eliminate export 
subsidies, which they say enable inefficient producers to export -- and often 
underprice efficient growers -- in global markets. The plan calls for phasing 
out export subsidies within five years. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which codifies earlier suggestions that the Administration has made 
in the agricultural trade field, is unchanged in scope and substance from the 
revised proposals outlined in early February by U.S. Trade Representative Carla 
A. Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would also allow countries to re-impose current tariffs or quotas 
in cases where surprise surges of imports threatened to jeopardize their 
domestic farming industries. And it would prohibit governments from blocking 
food exports in case of shortages at home. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals, which U.S. strategists will present formally in Geneva on 
Wednesday, are designed to speed up the negotiations on writing rules for trade 
in agriculture, which is not covered by global trade rules. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, which has been the major force behind the talks, has urged 
all countries to submit formal proposals on agriculture and other issues by 
year-end, so that a consensus is reached by the time the current talks end, in 
December, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have said Washington is willing to reduce or phase out America's 
farm subsidies and trade barriers if other countries agree to trim theirs as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
However, Washington's proposals on agricultural trade are expected to receive a 
cool reception -- particularly from European countries, whose governments face 
strong pressures from thousands of small, relatively inefficient farmers. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. farm groups are split over the Administration plan. John C. Baize, 
Washington director for the American Soybean Assn., said those organizations 
that represent large-scale crops such as corn and soybeans "strongly support" 
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
But those representing heavily subsidized U.S. crops -- such as peanuts, cotton 
and sugar -- are skeptical. Eiler C. Ravnholt, vice president of the Hawaiian 
Sugar Planters' Assn., said sugar growers have "concerns" about the plan, 
particularly converting quotas to tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We question whether that would allow continuation of the (current sugar 
subsidy) program without instability," Ravnholt said. 
</P>
<P>
All sides agree that the Administration faces an uphill battle in its fight to 
reduce farm subsidies worldwide. Even if other countries were to agree to go 
along, paring U.S. farm subsidies would require approval from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Congress will write a new farm bill next year, whether or not the 
United States is successful at the talks in Geneva. Congressional leaders have 
served notice that they do not intend to wait until the talks are over before 
starting work on the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. increased its own agricultural export-subsidy program in 1983, largely 
in retaliation for those maintained by European countries. Both sides have 
complained that they are spending too much for farm programs -- as much as $30 
billion a year each. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's reasoning behind the new effort is that although no country can 
"disarm" unilaterally and forgo its farm subsidies, both the industrial 
countries and developing nations can cut farm subsidies if all sides do so 
simultaneously.

UC IRVINE HOPES NEW SUPERCOMPUTER WILL DRAW TOP SCIENTISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by David Olmos, Times staff writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Hoping to boost its reputation as a leading research institution and to attract 
and retain top scientists, UC Irvine has purchased a high-powered supercomputer 
for campus researchers. 
</P>
<P>
The $2.3-million computer will be used for about 50 campus research projects 
and will be available to hundreds of UC Irvine researchers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"UCI's computing strategy is to provide a full range of computing resources for 
the needs of all users," said William Parker, UCI's associate executive vice 
chancellor and acting director of academic computing. "Our challenge is to 
continue to attract the finest faculty and students by providing the best 
possible environment for research." 
</P>
<P>
The supercomputer is many times more powerful than current computing facilities 
available at the university. In the past, UC Irvine researchers have used a 
national supercomputer center in San Diego, which is shared by numerous 
universities and other research institutions. However, access to the San Diego 
center is limited. 
</P>
<P>
Supercomputers are the fastest category of computers and are more powerful than 
the largest mainframe computers. They typically are used for complex tasks that 
require heavy computing power, such as simulating weather patterns or modeling 
the movements of a subatomic particle. 
</P>
<P>
The machine purchased by UC Irvine is made by Dallas-based Convex Computer 
Corp. The computer, called the Convex C240, has 1 gigabyte of memory, or the 
capacity to store about 1 billion characters. That is about 1,000 times the 
memory of the average Apple Macintosh. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Burke, a spokeswoman for Convex, said the company has sold supercomputers 
to the University of Notre Dame, Brigham Young University and the University of 
Illinois. But she said none is as powerful as UC Irvine's. 
</P>
<P>
"We filled what was a major gap in the resources available to our faculty," 
said Stephen D. Franklin, UC Irvine's coordinator for academic computing. "We 
have one of the largest systems, in terms of available memory, of any 
university in the country." 
</P>
<P>
"It will enable our faculty, which before essentially had the computer 
equivalent of a car, to now have a plane," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Universities are buying powerful computers to lure more talented scientists to 
their campuses, Franklin said. Although UC Irvine has access to the national 
computer centers, "one of the raps against us is that (the centers) are still 
not enough. You have to have your own (supercomputer). In trying to train and 
attract the faculty we want, this is sometimes as important as having a decent 
laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
"The faculty in certain departments pushed for this and made the case . . . 
that our retention, recruitment and status as a major public research 
university required providing, on campus, a capability far in excess of what we 
previously had. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been told by those involved in recruiting, the deans in engineering and 
the physical sciences, that there were situations where our lack of 
computational capability meant we weren't in the ballpark with certain (job) 
candidates," Franklin said.

TRAVEL FIRM'S CASH CRUNCH HURTS SOME TOURISTS' TRIPS

Financial problems at an Encino travel company left at least 70 Americans to 
fend for themselves in the Orient after hotels and other tour businesses 
refused to honor their prepayment vouchers, a company official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists arranged their luxury tours through Hemphill Harris Travel Corp. But 
because of Hemphill's problems, hotels in Hong Kong, Bali and other Oriental 
sites refused to accept vouchers from Hemphill, said Michael Jay, a vice 
president of marketing for Westar Acquisitions Corp., Hemphill's parent 
company. 
</P>
<P>
The tourists were forced to put up money out of their own pockets to return 
home, continue their trips at their own expense or seek the help of another 
travel company, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"My understanding is that nobody was stranded and left any place, that 
everybody is home or on their way home," Jay said. 
</P>
<P>
Jay said he thought that the only tourists affected were those on trips to the 
Orient. 
</P>
<P>
However, another tour operator, Abercrombie &amp; Kent, said it was asked by 
travel agents to help an eight-member American tour in Australia that had 
booked their trip through Hemphill. 
</P>
<P>
Hemphill has been struggling since the summer, when its business suffered a 
severe blow due to the civil strife in China in early June, Jay said. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to refund massive amounts of money to customers because we could no 
longer conduct those tours in China," he said. Since then, "we've had a severe 
cash shortage" and the company fell behind on some payments to hotel operators, 
Jay said.

MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: HOW THE FILMING OF THE FILMING OF ADS HELPS SELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While preparing its super-secret Super Bowl commercial, a Nike production crew 
spent several hours last week filming hockey great Wayne Gretzky on the ice. 
Next week, it plans to film the man of many sports, Bo Jackson, on the 
gridiron. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, this film crew is also being closely followed -- and filmed. But those 
following them aren't spies from Reebook. Nor are they Jackson or Gretzky 
groupies. Those in the second film crew are actually Nike employees. They are 
preparing a video about the making of the commercial. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, a commercial for a commercial. 
</P>
<P>
"America's heroes are in our commercials," said Liz Dolan, director of public 
relations at Nike. "So the outside world is intrigued by these ads. They want 
to see more than the 30-second commercial. They want to see every moment these 
guys are on camera." 
</P>
<P>
This seems to be the latest rage on Madison Avenue. For years, Hollywood has 
made "behind-the-scenes" films about the making of major motion pictures such 
as "Star Wars." Now the ad world is getting into the act in a big way. Nike 
also recently filmed a "behind-the-scenes" video of its popular "Bo Knows 
Baseball" commercial, in which Jackson appears to skate, play tennis and even 
strum an off-key tune with guitar legend Bo Diddley. 
</P>
<P>
The video about that ad, "The Making of Bo," is already being shown to 
customers at a number of Footlocker shoe stores. And portions of the video -- 
particularly the part in which Jackson knocks over the commercial's director, 
Joe Pytka -- have been aired during sports broadcasts on TV stations 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
A number of other big-time advertisers -- from Lee Jeans to Taco Bell -- have 
also recently discovered that videos about the making of TV commercials can 
become great marketing tools to inspire employees, impress retailers -- and in 
some cases, intrigue consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on a commercial -- and 
millions to buy broadcast time for it -- a couple thousand dollars a day more 
for a video crew is money well spent," Dolan said. Experts estimate that these 
videos can cost $20,000 to $100,000 to produce. 
</P>
<P>
Nike has even created an in-house production division to make the videos. 
Multimedia Presentations in Culver City, which specializes in making commercial 
videos, made some for Lee Jeans and Taco Bell. The videos were primarily used 
to motivate employees and, in the case of Lee, impress retailers. 
</P>
<P>
"There are lots of people in Middle America who have never seen how a 
commercial is made," said Christopher Raser, vice president and executive 
producer at Multimedia Group. "To them, this is very exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Advertising experts say this can be an extremely effective marketing tool. 
</P>
<P>
"It stresses to employees that the company is trying to include them as 
partners in everything they do," said John A. Czepiel, associate professor of 
marketing at New York University. "It's the closest thing you can do to 
inviting them along to the commercial shoot." 
</P>
<P>
Once the Lee Jeans salespeople have seen the video, they're sent out to show it 
to executives at department stores and clothing stores that might carry Lee 
Jeans. "Hopefully, it will motivate them to increase their orders," said Harish 
Bhandar, an account executive at the Minneapolis agency Fallon McElligott, 
which creates ads for Lee Jeans. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Taco Bell videotaped the making of its "Run for the Border" TV 
commercials. These ads feature a number of risky stunts, including one in which 
two guys jump off a fast-moving train. Taco Bell showed its behind-the-scenes 
video to 1,000 employees at a company meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"People are always interested in seeing how advertising is made," said Elliot 
Bloom, senior director of public affairs at Taco Bell. The same video was later 
shown to Taco Bell franchisees. "There's is no price you can place on the 
excitement you can help to build when a new ad campaign is just breaking," said 
Bloom. 
</P>
<P>
But to the crews filming these videos, it's often a race against time. 
</P>
<P>
The Lee Jeans video, for example, was filmed in Los Angeles in late January. 
Less than two weeks later, it was shown to 300 Lee Jeans sales executives at a 
meeting in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
And while some top commercial directors don't always enjoy the extra noise -- 
and extra people -- on their sets, they're beginning to accept these video 
crews as necessary evils. 
</P>
<P>
"With some commercials, the publicity can be as important as the commercials 
themselves," said Joe Pytka, who directed the recent Bo Jackson commercial and 
is directing Nike's upcoming Super Bowl ad. Pytka also directed the Lee Jeans 
ad that was featured in a recent video. 
</P>
<P>
Will these behind-the-scenes videos take the "magic" away from some ads? 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, perhaps. For example, the "Making of Bo" behind-the-scenes video 
reveals that Bo Jackson wasn't really wearing skates when he appeared on the 
ice. "That disappointed me a little," said Pytka, who never showed Jackson's 
feet during that sequence in his ad. 
</P>
<P>
Pepsi, which makes some of the most talked-about commercials of any company, 
says it doesn't see the value in these videos. "The problems of trying to get a 
second camera crew on to a set can be a real hinderance," said Tod Mackenzie, a 
Pepsi spokesman. "Everything else we do takes a back seat to the commercial 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Bozell Division Targets Entertainment 
</P>
<P>
Bozell, the Los Angeles agency that places broadcast ads for clients such as 
Warner Bros. and Lorimar Television, last week said it was setting up a special 
entertainment division. 
</P>
<P>
But the new division won't just handle TV and film spots. "When someone says 
entertainment, everyone thinks of movies and television," said Dick Porter, who 
has been named vice president and director of the entertainment division. "But 
it also includes other activities like theme parks, sporting events and even 
visitors bureaus." 
</P>
<P>
Those are the kind of businesses that Bozell's new division hopes to attract. 
</P>
<P>
Within the next year, Porter said he hopes to double the estimated $25 million 
in current billings of clients in Bozell's entertainment division. That may 
require some fancy footwork by Porter, who formerly worked at Bozell and most 
recently was vice president of media at MGM. Several years ago, Bozell lost 
DeLaurentiis Entertainment Group, one of its larger entertainment clients. 
</P>
<P>
But no matter how much advertising a film does, there's one form of marketing 
that usually works best of all, Porter said. "It's word of mouth that makes a 
picture a hit or miss." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contest Didn't Fly at First With Ad Chief 
</P>
<P>
What does American Airlines have in common with Harry's Bar &amp; American 
Grille? 
</P>
<P>
How about a "write-alike" contest? And one Los Angeles advertising executive 
isn't too thrilled about it. 
</P>
<P>
That executive is Paul Keye, chairman of Keye/Donna/Pearlstein. About 11 years 
ago, Keye came up with an idea to boost business at Harry's Bar in the ABC 
Entertainment Center. He proposed an International Imitation Hemingway 
Competition, in which writers were asked to compose short, original pieces that 
mimic Hemingway' prose. An ad for the contest was placed in the New Yorker 
magazine, and the winner was sent to the original Harry's Bar &amp; American 
Grille in Florence, Italy -- an old Hemingway haunt. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the contest has made national news and won international 
recognition, although it was discontinued in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Well, American Airlines recently announced a suspiciously similar competition 
in its publication, American Way. Except that this contest asks people to mimic 
the writing of author William Faulkner. The winner of the Faulkner Write-Alike 
Contest gets a round-trip ticket for two to any place in the U.S. that American 
flies. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt it was so derivative and so unoriginal that I wrote them a blistering 
letter," Keye said. "But the response I received from them was so gracious, 
that I've decided to let it go." 
</P>

Range Rover of North America Inc. said it will establish a Canadian subsidiary 
to market its British-built four-wheel-drive luxury vehicle by mid-1990. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to enter the Canadian market follows three years of sales in the 
United States, which has become the largest export market for Range Rover, the 
Lanham, Md., company said. 
</P>
<P>
Initial plans call for Range Rover to establish six dealers in major 
metropolitan areas across Canada, with the subsidiary headquartered in Toronto, 
the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Those dealers will most probably already be in the business of selling European 
luxury cars, said Roger J. Ball, named general manager of the new unit. 
</P>
<P>
No sales forecasts or pricing for the Canadian market were disclosed.

OSTRICHES FIND HOME ON THE RANGE, HELP RANCHERS FEATHER THEIR NESTS

<P>
A 9-foot-tall male ostrich is a strange sight in the West Texas oil fields, 
especially when it's trying to scare interlopers and attract females, but to 
Cooper Campbell, there's gold in them there quills. 
</P>
<P>
"Careful," he said, handing a visitor an off-white, pebbly surfaced, 3 
1/2-pound ostrich egg the size of a human baby's head. "That's worth $1,500." 
</P>
<P>
If the egg is fertile and the embryo survives its 42-day incubation and the 
chick survives the critical first three months -- the odds of everything going 
right are about 50% at best -- the 2-foot-tall baby bird can command more than 
$5,000. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of fertile, productive adults can bring $30,000 to $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell is manager of the Yellow Rose Ostrich Ranch south of Odessa, part of a 
business taking its first steps in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Potential profits attract ranchers all over the country, especially in Texas, 
Oklahoma and the Pacific Northwest, although the hardy birds can be raised in 
almost every state and even above the Arctic Circle in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few years ago, ostriches in the United States could be found only in 
zoos and in the pastures of exotic-animal collectors. Now the U.S. commercial 
ostrich population is 4,000 to 8,000, said Tom Mantzel, executive director of 
the Fort Worth-based American Ostrich Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"It's growing, growing, growing at a phenomenal clip," said Mantzel, who 
promotes the ostrich industry with a preacher's zeal. About 500 ranchers belong 
to the organization, three-quarters of them in Texas. Most of the rest are in 
Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
Mantzel estimated the country's adult ostrich population will have to reach at 
least 75,000 before it makes economic sense to slaughter them for their hide, 
feathers and meat. Until then, which he estimates will be in the mid-1990s, the 
birds are more valuable as breeders. 
</P>
<P>
The hide is used to make western boots, belts, other items of clothing and 
luggage. The feathers are used in dusters. South Africans and Europeans eat the 
meat, which looks, feels and tastes like beef and is low in cholesterol and 
fat. 
</P>
<P>
Ostriches are slaughtered at 12 to 14 months, when they weigh about 300 pounds 
and carry about 80 pounds of meat. The hide, feathers and meat are worth $400 
to $500, Mantzel said.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: COURT LIFTS UES EXCLUSION FROM LOAN PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Friday granted a temporary 
restraining order preventing the California Student Aid Commission from barring 
one of United Education &amp; Software's 26 trade schools from the federal 
student loan program until a hearing is held Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, a state agency that administers the federal student loan 
guarantee program, said last week that new students enrolling at National 
Technical Schools, a Los Angeles mail order school owned by the Encino-based 
United Education &amp; Software, wouldn't be eligible for government-guaranteed 
student loans because the school didn't meet the program's standards. 
</P>
<P>
The court ordered National Technical Schools to post a $250,000 bond as a 
condition for granting the temporary stay. 
</P>
<P>
However, the restraining order doesn't affect a separate decision announced 
Oct. 16 by the Higher Education Assistance Foundation, a private, nonprofit 
agency in St. Paul, Minn., that guarantees student loans, to suspend National 
Technical Schools from its loan guarantee program for a month. 
</P>
<P>
The commission banned National Technical Schools from the loan program because 
of problems uncovered during a U.S. Department of Education audit conducted 
from August, 1987, to November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the audit found that the school's computer training courses 
were too short to meet the federal minimum length of six months, the school 
admitted academically unprepared students, and it didn't make proper refunds on 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government said earlier that United Education &amp; Software might 
be liable to repay $21.8 million in government-backed student loans because of 
the audit findings.

THE RECORD INDUSTRY MOGUL IN THE AUDIENCE; 
</P>
<P>
JAZZ:THE SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY JAZZ ENSEMBLE WAS PLAYING ITS HEART OUT. 
AND THIS TIME SOMEONE OF NOTE TOOK NOTICE.

<P>
Musicians dream of being discovered, of a moment when a music industry power 
broker walks up after a show and says, "I love your stuff. How would you like 
to make an album?" 
</P>
<P>
For the San Diego State University Jazz Ensemble, that moment came last January 
at the National Assn. of Jazz Educators convention at the Town &amp; Country 
Hotel in Mission Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The ensemble had been selected to play the main stage in front of 3,000 jazz 
educators and industry insiders on opening night, a prestigious gig during a 
conference that included such top jazz pros as the Count Basie Orchestra, 
trombonist Bill Watrous and saxophonists Red Rodney and Michael Brecker. 
</P>
<P>
"The band played the best it's ever played," recalled band director Bill 
Yeager. 
</P>
<P>
One influential listener agreed. 
</P>
<P>
In the audience that night was Albert Marx, president of Los Angeles-based 
Discovery Records and a 60-year veteran of recording jazz. Art Tatum, Sarah 
Vaughan, Dizzy Gillespie and Duke Ellington are among the jazz giants Marx has 
worked with over the years. 
</P>
<P>
When he heard the SDSU ensemble at the convention, his reaction was immediate 
and uncomplicated. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they were great," Marx said. 
</P>
<P>
"He came up afterward and said, 'I want to record this band,' " Yeager said. 
</P>
<P>
The result is the 17-piece ensemble's first-ever album, "Don't Make Noise," due 
in record stores by early November. 
</P>
<P>
Although many collegiate jazz ensembles have produced albums on their own, it 
is rare for such a band to record for a major jazz label like Discovery, which 
issues about 40 albums a year. 
</P>
<P>
The group could have gone with safe, traditional material for the album, but 
Yeager chose a mix ranging from traditional big-band charts to tunes that show 
the rock 'n' roll side of many young jazz players. 
</P>
<P>
"There are eight absolutely different styles," Yeager said. "It's the sort of 
album that is extremely challenging for the musicians. They were asked to wear 
a lot of different hats. I don't think a person could say they didn't like it. 
If they didn't like one cut, they'll find something else: fusion, 
straight-ahead swing, jazz shuffle, rock shuffle, Latin, funk." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to big-band charts selected by Yeager, the album includes original 
tunes by Bill Macpherson, the band's guitarist, and by Rick Helzer, the 
associate director of jazz studies at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
Macpherson's title cut shows an eclectic mix of styles. Searing electric guitar 
lines played over a thumping rhythm section of electric bass and drums launch 
the song forcefully. Though Macpherson's guitar work shows influences ranging 
from Jimi Hendrix to contemporary electric jazz guitarists such as John 
McLaughlin, Al Dimeola and Lee Ritenour, his writing is testimony to his solid 
grasp of big-band history. 
</P>
<P>
Good dynamics and sophisticated interplay between the wind sections -- saxes 
and flutes, trombones and trumpets -- prove Macpherson has done his share of 
listening to Duke Ellington and other great big-band composers. 
</P>
<P>
"Just when you're thinking it's a fusion number, there's a sudden switch to 
straight-ahead up-tempo swing," Yeager said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, we come right back on the next cut with Don Menza's 'Tattoo,' " a 
medium-swing Basie-style number with upright bass." 
</P>
<P>
Most college jazz ensembles are made up of rosy-cheeked musicians barely out of 
their teens. But Yeager's crew boasts the kind of seasoning usually found in 
professional groups. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the members are in their late 20s or early 30s. Macpherson has been 
with the band three years. He earned a bachelor's in music from the revered 
Berklee School of Music in Boston before traveling west to work on a master's 
at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
"All the guys in the rhythm section are in their 30s," Yeager said. "Our bass 
player, Oliver Shirley, has been here as long as I have -- five years. This 
year we have four new members, and that's more than usual." 
</P>
<P>
And just because many of the players are older than your average college 
student doesn't mean they are career students. Most earn a living playing a 
variety of 
</P>
<P>
gigs outside the college jazz band. Macpherson's group, World Beat, appears in 
local clubs, and trumpeter Jeff Beck and sax man Les Jennings are members of 
the local rock band Dr. Feelgood and the Interns of Love. 
</P>
<P>
Other ensemble members perform with such local bands as Book of Colors, 
Borracho y Loco and Limbo Slam. 
</P>
<P>
Under Yeager, the jazz ensemble has become one of the top college bands in the 
country. In 1988, the group was selected as the top college jazz ensemble in 
the National Collegiate Jazz Competition at Epcot Center in Orlando, Fla. Last 
spring, the ensemble placed first in its division in the annual jazz festival 
at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Players in the ensemble devote serious time to the music. The group practices 
together twice a week for 90 minutes. Yeager also requires that each of the 
band's four sections -- trumpets, trombones, woodwinds and rhythm (guitar, 
bass, drums) -- practice together on their own. Of course, players spend a good 
portion of additional time learning their individual parts. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to see why the group has rallied around Yeager, a seasoned player and 
educator. 
</P>
<P>
He directed the instrumental program at the well-known Grove School of Music in 
Los Angeles, then founded the Los Angeles Jazz Workshop in 1979 before coming 
to San Diego State as director of jazz studies. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent practice session, he spurred his musicians on more like an 
enthusiastic peer than a seasoned academic. 
</P>
<P>
"Short notes . . . bite 'em," he emphasized to the horn players. "I want to 
hear silence on that eighth rest. That's what makes us sound tight. 
</P>
<P>
During another break, he and the trombonists debated a particular phrasing. 
</P>
<P>
"Overruled," Yeager exclaimed merrily, exercising the veto power that comes 
with the territory. 
</P>
<P>
The serious work was broken up by good-natured joking between Yeager and the 
musicians. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the humor, they are serious about their music. 
</P>
<P>
Macpherson hopes to get his own group recorded some day soon, and this album 
could be a stepping stone. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first jazz album I've played on," he said. "I've been in the 
studio before, but I consider it a milestone in my career that I've finally had 
something released, and I look forward to more opportunities opening up." 
</P>
<P>
 The jazz ensemble will perform Tuesday night Oct. 31 at 7 with San Diego 
saxophonist Charles McPherson in Smith Recital Hall on the university campus.

THEATER: ABRAMOV PLAY AT THE OLD GLOBE IS A STUNNING CENTERPIECE IN SAN DIEGO'S 
SOVIET ARTS FESTIVAL.

<P>
"How shall we live?" A familiar question in Russian drama, from Chekhov on. But 
the villagers portrayed in the Maly Theatre of Leningrad's "Brothers and 
Sisters" are not debating it over the tea-table. Five years after the defeat of 
the Nazis, these people are still feeding their children "bread" made of moss 
and sawdust. How shall we live? 
</P>
<P>
The surprise of this two-part, six-hour saga at the Old Globe Theatre, a 
centerpiece of San Diego's Soviet arts festival, is that it's not more of an 
ordeal. It would have a right to be, considering what the village in the story 
is going through. But director Lev Dodin and his company -- 41 actors! -- 
realize that a theater audience can only absorb so much suffering. 
</P>
<P>
So "Brothers and Sisters" is first of all, and quite consciously, a theater 
piece -- an entertainment. Indeed, there's so much gaiety and color on stage at 
times that the village in question might be named Anatevka. There is also a 
healthy amount of sex, observed far more frankly than used to be the case in 
Soviet theater. 
</P>
<P>
Without quite being a spectacular, "Brothers and Sisters" consistently rewards 
the eye and the ear. Anyone with the slightest sense of theater will respond to 
the great scene at the end of Part 1 when the soldiers of the village finally 
come home from the Great Patriotic War, and the play's teen-age hero, Mikhail 
(Pyotr Semak), gets to stand up at the marriage table with the woman of his 
dreams, Varvara (Natalya Fomenko.) 
</P>
<P>
And anyone who has been paying any attention to the story will realize that the 
scene is happening in Mikhail's head -- Mikhail who, up to now, has appeared to 
be about as fanciful as a plow horse: a young fellow who doesn't even have time 
to read the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The scene is not, however, the dreaded "dream sequence" that another director 
might have ordered. Dodin is much more sophisticated than that. He and his 
designers (Eduard Kochergin, setting; Oleg Kozlov, lights; Inna Gabai, 
costumes) fill the show with strong theatrical images, but they are arrived at 
the hard way, using the wood and the straw and the snow of the village. No 
smoke bombs, no glitz. The craft is all above the table, and the acting is just 
as honest. 
</P>
<P>
That's a matter of pride and also a matter of respecting the material. 
"Brothers and Sisters" is not to be confused with "Fiddler on the Roof." The 
suffering is there, because it did go on. And something in the faces of the 
actors -- even the children -- suggests that each of them has personal 
knowledge of it. The message is there as well. Life in the U.S.S.R. did have to 
be hard after the war, with 20 million dead and the cities in ruins. 
</P>
<P>
But it didn't have to be this hard. Choices were made that resulted in sawdust 
bread. And the men who made these choices -- men sitting at desks 1,000 miles 
from the villages -- didn't have to eat the results. 
</P>
<P>
An American viewer will naturally see "Brothers and Sisters" as a glasnost 
play. Actually it goes back a little before glasnost, to 1985. Its source, a 
trilogy of "village" novels by Fyodor Abramov (who grew up in just such a 
village), goes back farther than that, to the late 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing radical in the form of the play. It is rooted in the tradition 
of heroic Soviet drama, where a group of ordinary people make themselves into 
"one fist" in order to do their duty on the home front and beat the Nazis. It 
shows enormous respect for the effort and the victory. 
</P>
<P>
But a fist is not the normal condition of the human hand. (The observation is 
made by one of the play's strongest female characters, a former village leader 
now forced to take a back seat to the men -- Tatyana Shestakova.) Eventually a 
fist will cramp. The fingers will want to go back to being fingers. 
</P>
<P>
Having paid its respects to the the war effort, "Brothers and Sisters" (the 
title comes from Stalin's exhortation to the Russian people after the Nazi 
invasion) goes on to protest the notion that a nation's people can be ordered 
about like soldiers for 10, 20, 30 years on the excuse that the larger society 
is engaged in a heroic, warlike struggle that will one day transform the world. 
</P>
<P>
"I have only one life," a villager points out to a Party official arrogantly 
collecting for the latest "voluntary" national loan. The official (Sergei 
Bekhterev) naturally finds this a symptom of counterrevolutionary tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the men in the offices back in the city are watching -- and, human 
nature being what it is, believing -- the films that they themselves have 
commissioned about the happy life on the collective farms. When a nation's 
leadership gets this divorced from reality, something has to give. 
</P>
<P>
Part 2 of "Brothers and Sisters" ends with an image familiar in Russian 
literature and films -- that of a young man looking yearningly at the sky, as 
the cranes pass overhead. At one time, the sub-text of that image was: Hope. 
Endure. Today, the image perhaps something else. We have endured. Now we expect 
to live. 
</P>
<P>
All this without shaking a fist. Again, Dodin is above that sort of 
obviousness. It's clear, watching this play, that glasnost had to come. But 
it's equally clear that Dodin and his actors see their immediate job as telling 
a story. They are first-class storytellers. 
</P>
<P>
Some people have compared the play to "Nicholas Nickleby." No and yes. It is 
not as long a sit, for one thing -- six hours, as opposed to eight. Nor does it 
have the panache of Dickens' tale. There are few eccentric characters in 
"Brothers and Sisters," simply normal people trying to get their work done and 
have a little something with their tea. 
</P>
<P>
But there are similarities. Again, we have a conscientious young man (Semak) 
and his mild-eyed sister (Natalya Akimova) discovering, through various 
adventures, what a cold and deceiving world it can be. There are no conscious 
villains in the story, but there are certainly negative forces -- the prissy, 
revengeful party official (Sergei Bekhterev), the willful young hustler who 
marries the hero's sister (Igor Tupikin). (In the way of the theater, he is 
also one of the most entertaining people in the show -- rascals always are.) 
</P>
<P>
Though long, the story is not complicated. One can follow the spoken 
translation with one earphone, leaving the other ear free to pick up the 
actors' voices, and the voices and body language tell you exactly where you 
are. 
</P>
<P>
The acting is in the very best realistic Russian tradition, which is to say 
that when an actor touches a piece of cloth or wood, or hugs a child, the touch 
registers on the viewer's nervous system. This is all the translation that 
"Brothers and Sisters" needs to come across as an experience that we, with 
worse luck, might have undergone ourselves in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps there are moments when the acting becomes too detailed -- cadenzas 
where the actor is allowed to linger over a piece of business not strictly 
necessary to the story. (The playful business with the cigarette lighter when 
Vladimir Artemov's Grigori comes home from the war, for example.) 
</P>
<P>
There are also moments when the actor or actress gets too general. Natalya 
Fomenko establishes Varava's allure and devil-may-care ways, and it is all too 
easy to see why she is the scandal of the village. But do we also see her as 
the hardest worker in the village? I didn't. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. "Brothers and Sisters" is an uncommonly satisfying theatrical event, 
a banquet that doesn't allow us to forget the taste of that sawdust bread. 
Broadway couldn't afford to import this piece. San Diego has its priorities 
straight. Plays at the Old Globe Theatre, Balboa Park, San Diego, through Nov. 
19. Tickets: $75. Performances Tuesdays/Wednesdays and Thursdays/Fridays at 
7:30 p.m., with all-day performances Saturdays and Sundays, starting at 2:30 
p.m. (619) 239-2255.

VERDICT ON CONGRESS SERIES: A HOUSE DIVIDED; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: "TOP OF THE HILL" HAS BEEN CHIDED BY SOME REAL LAWMAKERS FOR NOT 
DEPICTING THE JOB MORE REALISTICALLY, BUT THE SHOW DOES HAVE ITS BACKERS ON 
CAPITOL HILL.

<TEXT>
<P>
No one has asked for a roll-call vote or suggested a filibuster, but the new 
CBS series "Top of the Hill," about the adventures of a freshman lawmaker, is 
sparking debate in the halls of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a marvelous idea," said Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport 
Beach), an attorney who is a first-term lawmaker. "If television can make a 
show about cops and robbers and cowboys and Indians, they can certainly make a 
show about the war zone here on Capitol Hill." 
</P>
<P>
The show, from Stephen J. Cannell Productions, features a handsome young 
California surfer named Thomas Bell Jr., played by William Katt, who arrives in 
Congress to fill the seat of his ailing father. Needless to say, Cox -- who 
maintains that his congressional district has some of the best surfing -- was 
curious about a television show focused on a freshman lawmaker representing a 
similar area. 
</P>
<P>
"I honestly believe that real life in the Capitol is more exciting and dramatic 
than the show gives it credit for," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
Similar complaints were voiced by two members of the House of Representatives 
who have appeared in television series. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Fred Grandy (D-Iowa), who played Gopher on "The Love Boat" and is now in 
his second term in Congress and a member of the House Agriculture Committee, 
watched the first episode Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
"Beyond the obvious inaccuracies and cliches, it was boring," Grandy said. "I 
was debating whether to watch the whole show or finish a report on crop 
insurance. Crop insurance won." 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't look like Congress and it didn't feel like Congress," said Rep. Ben 
Jones (D-Ga.), who appeared in "The Dukes of Hazzard" and is serving his first 
term in Congress. "It struck me that what they were doing was pretty silly. 
</P>
<P>
"The real experience has been much more interesting and substantive and more 
compelling that what they were doing on the show. I don't understand why they 
didn't try to present a more thoughtful and realistic portrayal of life in 
Congress." 
</P>
<P>
Attracting a congressional audience on Thursday night, when the show airs, is 
difficult because that is the night when many of the lawmakers leave Washington 
for their district offices. Some lawmakers, such as Rep. Jill Long (D-Ind.), 
say their schedules leave little time for television. "As a freshman member of 
Congress, I don't have time to watch situation comedies," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Glen Browder (D-Ala.), a former secretary of state in Alabama, came across 
"Top of the Hill" by accident when he happened to be watching television. He 
said he found it "entertaining from a personal standpoint -- being a new 
congressman (watching) a show about a new congressman. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's like everything else on TV," he said. "If they made it realistic, 
not even I would watch. No one wants to watch someone for 30 minutes to an hour 
signing papers or going over reports. It is a typical entertainment treatment 
of a government institution. 
</P>
<P>
"It may even improve the image of Congress," Browder said. "I've got a 
14-year-old daughter who comes down to the office a good bit and I don't think 
sees me running off to rescue any hostages. Maybe it will raise my status in 
her eyes." 
</P>
<P>
While Cox found the Katt character believable, he agreed that the show has 
skimped on realism. 
</P>
<P>
"For Washington insiders, the show lacks verisimilitude," he said. "As amply 
pointed out by reviewers, there were glitches from a roll-call vote to an L.A. 
Federal Building in place of the Capitol." (In the House of Representatives, 
members vote electronically and not as depicted by a voice roll call.) 
</P>
<P>
But Cox disagreed with the critics who charged that the gallivanting adventures 
of a freshman lawmaker, including a rescue attempt of a constituent in a 
foreign country, are far from the reality of day-to-day life in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I don't think that was so far off the mark," Cox said of the rescue 
episode. "I think members of Congress do things like that, but they may not get 
into such physical difficulties." He recalled a trip to observe elections in El 
Salvador where he and other members found themselves donning bulletproof vests 
for protection. 
</P>
<P>
"We suspect the show was modeled after our boss," said David Eisner, press 
spokesman for freshman lawmaker Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita), with a laugh. 
"He surfs all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher, an avid bodysurfer and a writer who just sold a screenplay of his 
own, said: "I think it's good to have a show about Congress as long as it tries 
to be accurate." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm worried that because you basically have people from the (political) left 
writing the scripts, you may end up with a show where the only heroic people 
are liberals," said Rohrabacher, who represents segments of L.A. and Orange 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher also said that "coming up with good ideas that are interesting and 
entertaining about politicians is very difficult. Most people want to turn the 
TV off when a politician's face comes on." 
</P>
<P>
Then, lightheartedly, he added, "It might have been better to make this a 
cartoon instead of a dramatic series. Having worked in Congress now, it looks 
like the Mad Hatter's tea party." If not a cartoon, he said with a laugh, then 
maybe an episode of "The Twilight Zone."

The Clash's "London Calling" and Prince and the Revolution's "Purple Rain" 
finished 1-2 on a list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s picked by the 
editors of Rolling Stone. The Clash, a now-defunct band whose lyrics featured 
aggressive working-class politics that became the staple of the punk movement, 
recorded "London Calling" in 1980. "Purple Rain," by Prince and the Revolution, 
dates back to 1984. The rest of the Top 10, in descending order: "The Joshua 
Tree" (by the Irish rock group U2), "Remain in Light" (Talking Heads), 
"Graceland" (Paul Simon), "Born in the U.S.A." (Bruce Springsteen), "Thriller" 
(Michael Jackson), "Murmur" (R.E.M.), "Shoot Out the Lights" (Richard and Linda 
Thompson) and "Tracy Chapman" (Tracy Chapman). The picks by 10 editors of the 
magazine appear in the Nov. 16 issue. ALEENE MacMINN

The Los Angeles City Council has unanimously approved a program to train 
economically disadvantaged residents and employ them in providing affordable 
in-home care for frail senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to avoid having to institutionalize the thousands of vulnerable 
seniors who are forced to leave their homes because they can't get the care 
necessary to permit them to remain at home," said Councilman Joel Wachs, who 
proposed the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs said $300,000 from federal Job Training Partnership Act funds will be 
used to train low-income residents at Cal State Los Angeles for eight weeks to 
help the elderly in areas including personal care and household management.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ROCKWELL TO CLOSE NUCLEAR 'HOT LAB' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rockwell International has announced plans to close its nuclear "hot lab" at 
the Santa Susana field laboratory west of Chatsworth, which had become a 
lightning rod for protests by neighborhood and anti-nuclear activists. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell, which has been seeking a 10-year extension of a special nuclear 
materials license to operate the hot lab, said it will instead request renewal 
of the license only through next October to complete current work and will file 
a decontamination plan with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Rockwell reiterated its contention -- backed by state 
and federal environmental agencies -- that the lab poses no immediate risk to 
the health of neighbors. But the company hopes "closure of the facility will 
allay concerns and will assure the public of our commitment to the community," 
Rocketdyne President Bob Paster said. 
</P>
<P>
The hot lab is a heavily shielded workshop where nuclear fuel and other 
radioactive materials are handled by remote control. The bulk of its work has 
been decladding -- taking apart -- nuclear fuel to remove the plutonium and 
uranium for recycling. The last decladding work was done in 1986.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 400 COUNTY PUBLIC WORKS EMPLOYEES STAGE 
SICKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 400 Los Angeles County building inspectors, engineers and flood control 
workers called in sick Monday to protest stalled contract talks, but county 
officials said the job action -- involving about 10% of the public works 
employees -- caused little disruption. 
</P>
<P>
Workers represented by the California Assn. of Professional Employees have been 
on the job without a contract since Sept. 30. The employees handle such jobs as 
inspecting private construction and overseeing public works projects. 
</P>
<P>
The job action caused county officials to send supervisory personnel to a 
building and safety office in East Los Angeles where only one worker out of a 
office staff of 12 showed up. 
</P>
<P>
The union did not call the sickout, a spokesman said, but "encouraged workers 
to express their displeasure" with stalled labor negotiations. The union is 
seeking an 8.5% pay raise for each year of a two-year contract. The county has 
offered 1.75% a year, but employee relations director Elliot Marcus said, 
"That, of course, is not the final offer." 
</P>
<P>
County officials told employees calling in sick that they would not be paid 
unless they present "proof satisfactory to the department" that the absence is 
linked to illness.

This is Judgment Day for the Beverly Hills Cop-Slapper. And to give you an 
inkling of what Zsa Zsa's fate in Beverly Hills Municipal Court may be, we 
offer some suggestions that the San Jose Mercury News recently received when it 
held a contest to find an appropriate sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Readers variously decreed that Gabor should be forced to: 
</P>
<P>
* "Sell her biography rights to Bob Woodward." 
</P>
<P>
* "Appear on a 'Hollywood Squares' reunion, with herself in the middle square 
surrounded by her ex-husbands." 
</P>
<P>
* "Be confused with Eva for the rest of her career by everyone she meets." 
</P>
<P>
One entrant rhapsodized: 
</P>
<P>
 Zsa Zsa in jail? 
</P>
<P>
 She'd soon grow too pale; 
</P>
<P>
 Public service's a must, 
</P>
<P>
 The Humane Society we can trust; 
</P>
<P>
 They've animals galore, 
</P>
<P>
 She can help clean up the store! 
</P>
<P>
And the envelope, please . . . 
</P>
<P>
The winner was Cindy Gum of Los Gatos, who wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"Recipe for Hungarian goulash: Toss Gabor, Imelda and Leona together into one 
cell. Add one toilet, a small cracked mirror with NO MAKEUP LIGHTS, and one 
half-sink. Wait for goulash to boil. For dessert, add Tammy Faye." 
</P>
<P>
Gum's prize was dinner for two at the Hungarian Huszar restaurant, the 
newspaper said, "in that Budapest by the Bay, otherwise known as Newark." 
</P>
<P>
From the streets of Beverly Hills to the lanes of the Harbor Freeway. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Motorists crawling along in jam-ups are pretty much limited in what they can do 
to pass the time -- listen to the radio, apply makeup or shave, talk on the 
phone, shake a fist at the maniac who cuts in front. 
</P>
<P>
But hostages of the Harbor Freeway the past few evenings near the Coliseum had 
another option. They could buy hats, T-shirts and tickets related to the

Vendors stood on the freeway hawking items. Not pleased by the service, the 
California Highway Patrol says about a dozen of them were cited. 
</P>
<P>
However, no charges were brought against service station operators near the 
Coliseum who charged $30 for parking. 
</P>
<P>
You wouldn't usually expect to find a church featuring (1) a stained-glass 
window depicting a soldier in a tank and (2) a statue of a uniformed soldier in 
front. 
</P>
<P>
But the Church of Our Saviour in San Gabriel has some unique pioneer roots. 
</P>
<P>
One of the founders of the 122-year-old Episcopalian church was Benjamin 
Wilson. An extensive landholder, he was mayor of Los Angeles from 1851-52 and 
later a state senator. Mt. Wilson is named for him. 
</P>
<P>
His grandson grew up on his rancho in San Gabriel and gained fame as a general 
during World War II. After the general's death in 1945, his sister dedicated a 
window to him in the church. And, in 1985, on the centenary of the general's 
birth, a statue was dedicated to him. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the unique testaments to Gen. George S. Patton (1885-1945).

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEPRESSION IN ELDERLY, NON-HEALTH ISSUES 
LINKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Depression in older people with chronic diseases seems to be linked more to 
unrelated problems such as lack of friends, unemployment or unfaithful spouses 
than to the illness itself, according to a USC study recently released in Los 
Angeles. The study suggests that elderly people afflicted with chronic diseases 
seek more information about a problem -- such as the loss of a loved one -- and 
take positive steps to surmount it. Patients also should try to throw 
themselves into other activities to keep their mind off troubles, the study 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The findings help us understand why some older persons get depressed when 
faced with major health problems and others do not," says Bryan Kemp, clinical 
associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the USC School of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The study was based on physical and psychological assessments of 73 patients, 
whose average age was 72. They had an average of four chronic illnesses each, 
including heart disease, arthritis and diabetes. Twenty-three of the patients 
were found to have significant symptoms of depression.

COUPLE PLEAD INNOCENT IN ALLEGED INVESTMENT SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Lancaster couple accused of bilking about 5,000 investors out of as much as 
$30 million pleaded innocent Monday to grand theft, forgery and securities 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
David and Karen Missman, owners of Missman-Kaplan Associates Ltd., a bankrupt 
real estate investment company in the San Fernando Valley, turned themselves in 
to authorities for arraignment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David Milton set a preliminary hearing date of 
Dec. 12 for the couple, who face a 118-count criminal complaint. The couple 
were released on $25,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
The Missmans are accused of working a "Ponzi" scheme starting in 1979 by 
offering a high rate of return on investments in two companies they owned, MKA 
Ltd. and S.C.S. Co., and then using money from new investors to pay off earlier 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the investors were schoolteachers, Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Youngdahl 
said. Much of the business was generated through endorsements by satisfied 
investors who told friends and colleagues that dealings with the companies had 
proven to be prudent, he said. The Missmans also used former teachers as sales 
representatives or company officers. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, Henry Springer, a former president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, 
provided authorities with sworn statements alleging that the Missmans used 
investor funds for extensive travel and to purchase a $1.3-million Chatsworth 
home and expensive cars, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Because the couple's companies were forced by creditors into involuntary 
bankruptcy proceedings, most of the recovered assests will go to creditors, 
Youngdahl said. Although the loss suffered by investors may reach $30 million, 
only $300,000 of the couple's assets will be left for the victims, he said.

COURT GRANTS MILLER BAIL; RELEASE ASSURED; 
</P>
<P>
ESPIONAGE: THE EX-FBI AGENT HELD IN A SOVIET SPYING CASE IS EXPECTED TO BE 
FREED SOON PENDING HIS THIRD TRIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A Los Angeles federal court judge Monday granted bail, and eventual freedom, to 
Richard W. Miller, the former FBI agent whose conviction for spying for the 
Soviet Union was overturned last April. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon ordered Miller released from a Minnesota 
prison on $337,757 bond pending his third trial. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who was not present for the hearing, is expected to return to Los 
Angeles by the weekend and will appear in court next Monday for the setting of 
a new trial date. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Greenberg, one of Miller's defense attorneys, said the 52-year-old 
former FBI agent was still being held in a federal medium-security prison in 
Rochester. Miller will not be released until he signs bail papers, a process 
that could take several days, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased he will be getting out," Greenberg said. "A little later 
than we would have liked, but better late than never." 
</P>
<P>
Miller's release was all but guaranteed Oct. 13, when the U.S. 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals ordered Kenyon to hold a bail hearing for the former FBI 
agent. The appeals court ruled that federal prosecutors had "failed to show by 
a preponderance of the evidence" that Miller was a flight risk and should be 
denied bail. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, the appeals court set in motion Miller's release when it overturned 
his 1986 espionage conviction. It was the first time a major U.S. spying 
conviction had been overturned since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Miller was found guilty by a federal court jury in Los Angeles in June, 1986, 
after a four-month trial. An earlier three-month trial in 1985 ended when 
jurors were unable to come to a verdict after three weeks of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
Accused of passing FBI secrets to the Soviet KGB during an adulterous affair 
with Soviet emigre Svetlana Ogorodnikova, Miller had originally been sentenced 
by Kenyon to two life terms plus 50 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Miller claimed that he had become involved with the Soviet woman as part of a 
secret effort to infiltrate the KGB. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors argued that he passed on intelligence information to Ogorodnikova 
in return for sex, $15,000 in cash, $50,000 in gold and a Burberry trench coat. 
</P>
<P>
Neither prosecutors nor FBI officials would comment Monday when asked if 
federal authorities had plans for keeping Miller under surveillance once he is 
freed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it would be productive to say whether the government intends to 
take its own additional steps," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Russell Hayman, the 
prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
Hayman had little reaction to Kenyon's decision, noting only that "we opposed 
bail in the first instance and all along." 
</P>
<P>
During Monday's hearing, Hayman urged Kenyon to allow him to interview several 
friends and relatives of Miller who had agreed to put up their property to meet 
his bond. 
</P>
<P>
"It is relevant for the government to hear their contact with Mr. Miller," 
Hayman said. "They must understand what the consequences (of posting bail) are 
so they will have a motive to stay in frequent contact with Mr. Miller." 
</P>
<P>
But after hearing from a court pretrial services official, who said that 
Miller's friends and relatives were already aware of those consequences, Kenyon 
ordered Miller's release. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Miller's sister, Maryann Deem, said she had no fear of losing her 
home if Miller fled the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no concerns," said the Downey resident, who put up her home as partial 
collateral for Miller's bond. "It is my dwelling." 
</P>
<P>
Miller's brother, Dewey, who lives in the Los Angeles area, and a family friend 
from Maine are also putting up their homes to help meet the former FBI agent's 
bail, Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the defense lawyer, Miller will live in the Rampart section of Los 
Angeles in an apartment rented by Albert Sayres, a private investigator who was 
once Miller's supervisor in the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
Sayres, who called Miller a "God-fearing, decent man," said he plans to hire 
the former FBI agent to "answer the phones and do a little legwork for me." 
</P>
<P>
When asked, however, if Miller would be working as a private investigator, 
Greenberg said: 
</P>
<P>
"Let's not make him from James Bond into Nick Charles (the fictional 'Thin Man' 
detective)."

TEACHERS, DISTRICT TAKE THEIR CASES TO BEVERLY HILLS PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Both sides in the Beverly Hills teachers strike took their cases to hundreds of 
frustrated parents Monday night after a second attempt at talks broke down late 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 people attended a forum at Beverly Hills High School, the first 
opportunity for parents to hear both sides present their positions in the 
strike, which entered its second week. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Robert French appealed to residents for financial support. With 
Proposition 13's ceiling on property taxes, a state Supreme Court ruling that 
the state must equalize funding to school districts and Beverly Hills' own 
declining enrollment, the city's schools have fallen on hard times, he said. 
</P>
<P>
French compared the district with its high-quality education to a "lighthouse" 
and told parents: "All we're asking you is to give us more fuel for that light 
. . . we can't do it alone. You're the controller of the purse strings." 
</P>
<P>
But Judy McIntire, president of the Beverly Hills Education Assn., the teachers 
union, charged that administrators and the Board of Education bear the 
responsibility for financing teacher demands. 
</P>
<P>
"When you don't have competitive salaries, you're not going to be able to keep 
good teachers and you're not going to be able to attract good teachers," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Spurred by parent pressure and with a state mediator acting as an intermediary, 
representatives of the teachers union and the district met for 5 1/2 hours 
before breaking off discussions shortly before midnight Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Although the union slightly lowered its pay demand -- by 1%, to 17% over two 
years -- the district refused to budge from an 11% salary increase over two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Gordon, chief negotiator for the Beverly Hills Education Assn., said 
Sunday's revised offer was "a tentative thing to see if (the district was) 
serious" about negotiating. He said that because the district refused to bend, 
the union is again seeking an 18% raise. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to disagreements over teacher salaries, the two sides are also at 
odds over medical benefits. Teachers want full medical and dental coverage, 
while the district wants to continue only partial coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Central to the dispute is how much the district has available to spend on 
salaries and health benefits for its 300 teachers, nurses, counselors and 
librarians. 
</P>
<P>
French said the district's $28.3-million budget for the current school year, 
including reserves of about $1.2 million, does not take into account any salary 
or benefit increases for district personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The district said every 1% increase in salaries would cost $195,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
The district's offer would cost about $3 million, French said, which would 
exhaust this year's reserve. 
</P>
<P>
To rebuild the reserve, the district would have to make $2 million in cuts in 
the 1990-91 budget, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The superintendent said the district is considering a new tax on all parcels of 
land in the city for the June ballot. If approved, it would generate about $2 
million for the 1990-91 school year but nothing for this year, French said. The 
district's last attempt to levy such a tax was turned down by voters in March, 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
French also said that about $6 million -- mainly income from renting out 
libraries and auditoriums, from private donations, from oil wells on the high 
school campus and from a line of Beverly Hills High School clothing -- goes 
toward keeping class sizes at an average of 25 students. The money is also used 
for music, art, computer and other specialized courses. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers, however, say the district could afford their demands by using 
reserves, funds allocated but not yet not spent, and through additional fund 
raising. 
</P>
<P>
The average teacher salary in Beverly Hills is $42,659 a year. In the Los 
Angeles district, teachers earn an average of $42,460 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, attendance districtwide rose Monday to 60%, up from Friday's 43%.

A SPECIAL SESSION, WITH SPEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian is right to call the Legislature into special session 
within the next two weeks to deal with the effects of last Tuesday's Northern 
California earthquake. With Congress already moving to grant up to $3 billion 
in relief, earthquake victims need to know that state officials are prepared to 
come up with the state's share of disaster and reconstruction aid as soon as 
possible, and as soon as is practical. Deukmejian should be commended, as well, 
for advising state officials to do all they can to expedite aid to earthquake 
victims without getting too tangled up in red tape. 
</P>
<P>
The governor is wrong, however, in his campaign to distance himself from the 
California Department of Transportation on the issue of what caused the Nimitz 
Freeway in Oakland to collapse, and what could or should have been done to have 
prevented it. While Deukmejian is not necessarily blaming Caltrans, he seems to 
be preparing himself for such investigatory questions as: "What did you know 
and when did you know it?" 
</P>
<P>
The governor's answer, which he has been repeating ever since the day of the 
quake, was that no one in Caltrans ever told him a freeway might collapse in an 
earthquake. He was shocked that such a thing would happen. This has the 
earmarks of a preemptive defense against any allegation that California stinted 
on highway reinforcement because transportation funds have been short during 
his administration, possibly because he had opposed a gasoline tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
There is keen interest, of course, in why the freeway collapsed, and whether 
something might have been done. The major reason is so that California can 
learn from the experience as it designs new roads and reinforces existing ones 
against the next quake. There has been no widespread outcry against the 
governor. While the Department of Transportation and the state Transportation 
Commission do exercise considerable control over the allocation of highway 
funds, the governor also sets general state priorities. 
</P>
<P>
The governor complained on Sunday that the highway engineers never came to him 
and told him that bridges or freeways might collapse in an earthquake. But no 
one who has lived in California more than a few months would rule out the 
chance that any bridge or freeway could collapse in the right kind of 
earthquake. California is on the edge of earthquake-related technology, but 
still does not know everything that needs to be known. The state learns more 
from every earthquake and a critical need now is to learn everything possible 
from Tuesday, Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
But it is also the time to concentrate on helping quake victims through these 
most trying days of their experience -- the period when the emergency response 
is over and people face the dreary details of restoring their life to some kind 
of normality. In the Bay Area, that includes hundreds of thousands of commuters 
who did not suffer personal damage, but face massive obstacles in getting to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
The governor and legislative leaders will meet again next Monday to determine 
the timing and agenda of a special session. It almost certainly would include a 
temporary gasoline-tax increase to deal with highway reconstruction and repair 
and possible general revenues for other forms of disaster relief. Existing law 
already gives the governor considerable discretion in diverting reserve funds 
on hand to the Office of Emergency Services for allocation to local 
governments. But the need could well exceed the present reserve. The scope of 
the disaster would seem to justify a temporary surcharge. 
</P>
<P>
The governor and Legislature should not wait too long to start the session, 
although they do not yet have precise damage estimates or know just how much 
the federal government will send to California. The Legislature can begin 
organizing its staff and committees now so the appropriate legislation can be 
passed as soon as that information is obtained.

HEALTH INSURERS PLANNING DOUBLE-DIGIT RATE HIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California health insurers are planning double-digit premium increases in 1990, 
putting renewed pressure on employers to either trim coverage or pass the added 
cost along to their workers. 
</P>
<P>
The giant Kaiser Foundation Health Plans has announced its largest increases in 
basic rates since 1980: 19.6% for the Northern California region and 17.5% for 
the Southern California region. Kaiser is the nation's largest health 
maintenance organization and by far the dominant HMO in California, with about 
4.5 million members, more than half of the California market. 
</P>
<P>
Blue Cross of California is planning a 20% increase for individual members. Its 
rate hike for group coverage may be even higher, but spokesmen declined to 
discuss that issue. Some other so-called "fee for service" insurers are 
expected to implement rate increases of up to 30%. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual factor behind Kaiser's rate increase is that the HMO is growing 
"extremely rapidly," said Dr. Michael J. Martin, the San Francisco-based 
director of project development for Mercer-Meidinger Hansen Inc., a benefits 
consulting firm. Kaiser operates its own clinics and hospitals. Its increased 
enrollment is forcing it to build more facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Last year Kaiser Northern California raised rates 12.9% and the Southern 
California region had a rate hike of 9.6%. Those increases were lower than 
those of most other HMOs last year. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the whopping rate increases in 1990, Kaiser will remain the 
lowest-cost HMO in California and most of the nation, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, HMO rate increases are expected to be in the range of 15% -- about 
the same as the rate hike in 1989, said Russell Nash, a consultant on health 
care and insurance for McKinsey &amp; Co. in Los Angeles. Cypress-based 
Pacificare, which has about 400,000 members in Southern California, said it 
expects to raise rates in the range of 14% to 18%. The rate of increase will 
vary with different employer groups, depending on the ages of group members, 
the geographic spread of the group and the benefits received, said Michael 
Lombardi, Pacificare's vice president for marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare Health Plans Inc., with about 150,000 members in Southern California, 
expects to raise rates in the range of 17%, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare, once the nation's largest for-profit HMO, filed for Chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection last March. The company recently won agreement from its 
creditors on a plan of reorganization and is expected to ask for the approval 
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana next month. 
</P>
<P>
About the only good news is that the 1990 increases for some HMOs will be lower 
than they were this year when organizations felt "an incredible need to play 
catch-up ball," said Charlie Schetter, a health care consultant with McKinsey 
&amp; Co. Some rates increased 25% to 30% in 1989 as HMOs tried to make up for 
the highly competitive years in the mid-1980s when they elected not to raise 
rates, or to keep increases very low, for fear of losing business. 
</P>
<P>
Lynda C. Badum, an associate with Fringe Benefit Planning of Newport Beach, 
said she expects that some of the smaller HMOs in California will still be 
playing catch-up in 1990 with increases higher than 20%. Small plans, like 
Metropolitan Life Insurance's HMO, "started at much lower rates and are now 
going higher to make up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the reasons that HMOs are continuing to raise rates is that they "are 
becoming more popular and are taking on a more diverse risk," Badum said, 
explaining that more HMOs are getting older members who are sicker and cost 
more to serve. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser's Northern California region gained 126,000 members in 1988, bringing 
total membership to about 2.3 million, said Bob Hughes, Kaiser's spokesman for 
that region. It expects to add about the same number this year, he said. The 
increased membership has forced the region to speed up its 10-year, 
$3.5-billion plan to build more facilities, he said. General inflation in 
medical costs has also contributed to the strain. 
</P>
<P>
"We have also made a concerted effort to improve our services. We are 
increasing our ratio of physicians to members," Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
The recruitment of physicians in itself is costly, said Janice Fowler-Seib, 
spokeswoman for Kaiser's 2.2-million member Southern California region. The 
region has added about 700 doctors in the last two years and expects that it 
will need another 500 in 1990. "That is the equivalent of three medical school 
graduating classes. There is a tremendous expense in recruiting competent 
physicians and we need medical support staff," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser has taken steps to control its growth in recent years. It no longer 
accepts individual members and has stopped advertising in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, Kaiser is a victim of its own success. It is gaining members, 
health care consultants say, because of its history of stability during a 
troubled period for HMOs and because of its low cost. Next year, Kaiser's rates 
will still be about 13% to 15% below its HMO competitors, Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite troubles in the industry, HMOs remain popular, health care consultants 
said, because their cost and rate increases have been less than those of 
indemnity -- fee for service -- insurers, who allow members to choose their own 
doctors and pay the bills after a certain deductible. 
</P>
<P>
While some experts expect indemnity insurers to increase rates by 20% or more 
again in 1990, a dissenting opinion came from McKinsey &amp; Co.'s Nash, who 
said he expects most indemnity insurance rate hikes to be less than 20%, 
because the profitability of most insurers has improved in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
Nash said he thinks the employers will react to the increased rates in several 
ways, including more aggressively negotiating for lower rates and studying more 
closely the factors that are driving up their particular premium costs and 
fine-tuning their plans as a result. For example, if employers find that 
offering drug and alcohol abuse recovery programs are driving up costs, they 
may redesign those plans. 
</P>
<P>
"They will also be asking employees to make trade-offs. If you want to have 
full access to providers instead of staying within the network (of specifically 
designated doctors and other providers) you will have to pay more," Nash said. 
Employers may continue to ask workers to pay more of the premium, he added.

HOUSE PANEL OKS $2.8 BILLION FOR QUAKE RELIEF

Congress on Monday took the first step toward approving federal aid for victims 
of last week's Bay Area earthquake, but only after unexpected opposition 
sidelined a package that had been put together by the California congressional 
delegation. 
</P>
<P>
The package approved by the House Appropriations Committee would provide $2.8 
billion to rebuild bridges and highways and provide emergency aid -- fully $1 
billion less than the California delegation had requested but close to the $2.5 
billion proposed by the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The package, still the largest ever approved for a single disaster, was passed 
on a voice vote as part of a stopgap spending bill to be taken up by the full 
House today. The California plan was killed earlier by a 27-7 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Among the provisions defeated was one that would have allowed Bay Area 
homeowners to receive disaster loans of up to $500,000 to rebuild their homes. 
Under current law, those loans are limited to $100,000. California lawmakers, 
who argued that the higher limit was needed because of the high cost of housing 
in the Bay Area, may try to restore the provision as Congress works on the 
emergency aid package this week. 
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Jamie L. Whitten (D-Miss.), who sponsored the bill and led 
the opposition to the more costly California request, called his proposal a 
"starter" package and said more money could be allocated to California, once 
its needs have been more carefully determined. 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento), leader of the state's effort in the 
committee, expressed disappointment that the lawmakers turned down his request 
for $3.8 billion in relief funds now. 
</P>
<P>
"We made our case. We didn't succeed in winning the support we need, but we 
hope we can in the future," Fazio said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Whitten's assurances that California will get more aid if it needs 
it, Fazio said he "appreciated the chairman's intent" but feared that Congress 
will be less disposed to help the victims of the quake once the initial shock 
of the disaster passes and media attention turns elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Out of sight, out of mind' is what operates around here," Fazio said. "I 
think it's going to be very difficult to get more money down the road after 
other problems have intervened." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had detected an anti-California bias, Fazio said: "California has 
always had certain problems in presenting its problems to the rest of the 
country. . . . We are the Golden State, and that leads to some jealousy." 
</P>
<P>
The package approved by the committee would provide $1.1 billion in Federal 
Emergency Management Agency disaster relief funds, $1 billion in federal 
highway aid to reconstruct damaged bridges and roads, $500 million in Small 
Business Administration loan funds that can be used to rebuild both businesses 
and homes and $250 million to be used at President Bush's discretion to aid 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
The California delegation had proposed a total of $400 million in discretionary 
funds for the President plus additional money for the SBA, in part to take into 
account the proposed larger loan limit for home reconstruction. The delegation 
plan also included $100 million in funds for the Economic Development 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
With polls showing that voters are no longer concerned about the federal 
deficit, neither the Administration nor the congressional leadership made even 
a pretense of proposing a way to pay for the aid, conceding that the extra 
spending will simply swell the existing deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"It will add to the deficit," White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. "Is 
that preferable to a tax increase? Yes." 
</P>
<P>
The new spending does not violate the increasingly irrelevant Gramm-Rudman law 
that is supposed to control the deficit, because its mechanism only looks at 
the deficit as of Oct. 15 of each year. Spending after that date does not count 
-- thus creating one of a series of loopholes that both Congress and the 
Administration have been taking advantage of with increasing abandon. 
</P>
<P>
But although Gramm-Rudman no longer seems to have much ability to control 
spending, congressional battles over turf still have the strength to slow 
legislation. That fact was dramatically on display Monday as committee Chairman 
Whitten stalled action on the California delegation's plan and then imposed his 
own, smaller alternative. 
</P>
<P>
While conceding that Whitten's package was better than the Administration's 
proposal, Fazio and other California legislators said they were concerned about 
the committee's refusal to waive all local matching requirements for highway 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course $2.8 billion is a lot of money, but what we really needed were some 
of the waivers," one California legislative aide said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee vote came after a somewhat contentious session in which other 
lawmakers questioned California's need for so much money. 
</P>
<P>
Saying he wanted to dramatize his concern that too much money was being spent, 
Rep. Bob Livingston (R-La.) introduced and then withdrew an amendment that 
would have allocated $5 billion to his state for damages suffered in hurricanes 
going back to 1900. 
</P>
<P>
Whitten denied the committee was showing an "anti-California" bias, saying 
legislators just needed more time to consider the magnitude of the request and 
the mechanisms by which California is proposing to use the money. 
</P>
<P>
"There are at least 10 committees that have jurisdiction here," he said, adding 
that it could take "a year and a half" to pass California's requests.

BUSH SEEKS TO FIGHT IT OUT FOR 'LINE-ITEM VETO' POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In a move that could set up a massive confrontation with Congress, President 
Bush is actively seeking to test his power to exercise a "line-item veto" over 
legislation and letting members of Congress take him to court if they object. 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle, speaking in Chicago, said Monday that Bush is 
"inclined to do so" if he can find an "appropriate" bill in which to veto 
individual provisions while signing the rest into law. 
</P>
<P>
Other Administration officials confirmed that Bush has ordered White House 
Counsel C. Boyden Gray and Budget Director Richard G. Darman to find a test 
case for a line-item veto. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that's under consideration," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
A second senior official added: "The President is determined to test this 
device. He's been pressing the staff lately to find an appropriate vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
Most state governors can veto parts of a bill and approve other parts, rather 
than having to approve or reject the whole thing. But the Constitution gives 
the President power only to sign a bill or veto it entirely. 
</P>
<P>
Some conservative legal scholars argue that many bills passed by Congress, 
including many spending measures, are so large and unwieldy, with so many 
unrelated provisions, that they are not what the Constitution's writers had in 
mind. The President should simply treat those bills as many separate pieces of 
legislation and veto the ones he does not like, these scholars contend. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and former President Ronald Reagan repeatedly sought line-item veto 
authority from Congress, and Congress just as consistently rebuffed them. A 
line-item veto would deny Congress one of its favorite stratagems -- attaching 
controversial measures that the President opposes to vital money bills that the 
President is reluctant to kill. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, for example, Bush vetoed a massive spending bill for government 
health and welfare programs because of a single provision that would have 
allowed public funds for abortions in cases of rape or incest. With a line-item 
veto, Bush could have approved the money bill while vetoing the abortion 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the President signed an $11.2-billion appropriations bill for the 
Department of Interior, saying its benefits "outweigh my reservations" about 
limitations it includes on offshore oil-drilling preparations. Now, however, 
Bush has decided that "if the Congress won't give it to him, he wants to see if 
he has the authority" to use piecemeal vetoes without further authorization, 
one of the Administration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Some White House aides have warned Bush that the expected furor on Capitol Hill 
would make "the battle not worth the trouble," the official said. But, he 
added: "If the President says, 'Go,' he's a consensus of one." 
</P>
<P>
Legally, experts on both sides of the issue say, the President's chances of 
success are, at best, dubious. 
</P>
<P>
"The Constitution does not, itself, define what a bill is," noted University of 
Chicago law professor Michael W. McConnell, who worked in the Justice 
Department and the Office of Management and Budget under the Reagan 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a gutsy move" if Bush tried to assert the power, McConnell said, 
but "I personally think it's rather unlikely" that the courts would uphold him. 
</P>
<P>
Early in American history, Congress limited bills to one subject at a time, 
McConnell noted, and when Congress began to tie unrelated items together, 
presidents strongly objected. Over the years, however, "the presidents by and 
large gave up," and it may be too late now to persuade the courts to change the 
status quo, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard Law School professor Laurence H. Tribe, who has advised several leading 
Democrats, offered a similar assessment. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that Congress doesn't really know what's in much of what it passes is 
a fact of political life," he said. The courts would be unlikely to allow the 
President to so greatly expand his power at Congress' expense, Tribe said.

SHELTER: THE NAVY BRINGS THREE SHIPS TO SAN FRANCISCO, WHERE SAILORS PITCH IN 
ASHORE AND THE VESSELS SERVE AS FLOATING SHELTERS.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Navy is under some peculiar sailing orders here, providing everything from 
a floating shelter for the homeless to amphibious mail delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Three San Diego-based vessels -- the Peleliu, an amphibious helicopter assault 
vessel; the Fort Fisher, a dock landing ship; and the Schenectady, a tank 
landing ship -- weighed anchor in San Francisco Bay on Friday with about 1,650 
Marines and sailors reporting for disaster duty. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the hulking gray ships have played a unique role in earthquake 
recovery, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The 39,300-ton Peleliu literally provided a safe harbor for hundreds of 
derelicts and other downtown denizens uprooted by the quake by turning its 
helicopter hangar into a huge dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
Rows of Red Cross cots were lined up in precise rows for the 325 men who 
trooped up the gangplank Sunday night with their few belongings in plastic 
trash bags. Urns of hot coffee took the edge off Monday's chill, and small 
television sets relieved the boredom for the new shipmates. 
</P>
<P>
The men were free to come and go until 10 p.m. curfew, but some expressed 
reservations about being on board. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the guys don't feel safe on the ship," said Joseph Bruno, 45, whose 
welfare hotel in the Tenderloin suffered extensive quake damage. "A lot say 
they don't know how to swim if anything happened, and others are Vietnam vets 
who don't like being around the military." 
</P>
<P>
Another man, standing barefoot in the rain alongside the ship, noted that the 
cavernous quarters were "too cold, but the food's great. We had steak last 
night." 
</P>
<P>
The Navy is providing the food, and the ship's mess is the only place on board 
where the sailors and the homeless mingle. 
</P>
<P>
Because many of the homeless have substance abuse problems, the Red Cross said, 
two fully equipped detoxification vans are parked at the bottom of the 
Peleliu's gangway. Ship doctors are available twice a day to the homeless for 
sick call. 
</P>
<P>
Military spokesmen said a few knives were confiscated from the homeless men, 
but there have been no incidents reported aboard the ship. 
</P>
<P>
Crew members from the three vessels are helping with earthquake recovery in 
hard-hit neighborhoods by strapping down water heaters in unstable homes, 
clearing fallen trees and helping senior citizens move out of condemned 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Sailors also have been making sandwiches for rescue workers at the collapsed 
section of the Nimitz Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy also agreed to lend a barge to the U.S. Postal Service to carry 40 
mail delivery trucks across the bay from Oakland to San Francisco, and 
helicopters from the Peleliu ferried food and water to stricken Santa Cruz, 
said Navy spokesman Chief Petty Officer Erik Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson said there are no estimates yet on the cost of military help in 
earthquake recovery efforts. "We'll sort that all out later with the wash," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Peleliu homeless were among nearly 1,000 evacuees forced to move from the 
Red Cross shelter at the city's main convention hall, the Moscone Center, which 
is getting ready for a meeting of 6,000 plastic surgeons next week. 
</P>
<P>
The other Moscone residents were sent to temporary quarters in barracks at the 
Presidio Army post. 
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted to provide a place that would offer everyone more comfort, more 
privacy and more dignity," said Red Cross spokeswoman Chris Garrett. She said 
the evacuees had been sleeping in the ballroom and lobby of the Moscone Center, 
which lacked showers and adequate dining facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't imagine what it was like sleeping with a thousand other people 
snoring and gritting their teeth," Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear how long the Peleliu would house earthquake victims. While the 
Navy said it would only be for three or four days, the Red Cross said it was 
under the impression that the stay would be for as long as necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The Peleliu was diverted to San Francisco for disaster duty after the 
helicopter carrier completed an exercise in the Aleutian Islands.

ABORTION RULING ON MINORS WILL NOT BE APPEALED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In a surprise action, the state attorney general's office said Monday it will 
not challenge an appeals court decision preventing enforcement of a state law 
requiring unmarried minors to get parental or judicial consent for an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
In a terse announcement, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp's office said that in 
the "best interests of the state" the ruling will not be appealed to the state 
Supreme Court. Instead, it said, the issue will be returned to San Francisco 
Superior Court for a trial. 
</P>
<P>
The state's decision not to appeal means that it could be months or even years 
before the law could take effect, provided its legality is eventually upheld in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
The unexpected move came in one of the two highly charged legal disputes that 
have emerged in the California courts after last July's ruling by the U.S. 
Supreme Court giving states more leeway in regulating abortion. The other case, 
pending before the state Supreme Court, tests the state's right to deny 
Medi-Cal funded abortions to low-income women. 
</P>
<P>
Under the consent law, unmarried minors -- those 17 or under -- must obtain the 
approval of a parent, guardian or judge for an abortion unless there is a 
medical emergency. 
</P>
<P>
The measure was passed by the Legislature in 1987 but was quickly challenged by 
opponents before it could take effect. In December of that year, San Francisco 
Superior Court Judge Morton R. Colvin issued a preliminary injunction barring 
implementation of the law pending trial. The judge concluded that the 
challengers were likely to prevail in their claims that the statute violated 
the state Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, named as a defendant because of his role as the state's chief 
lawyer, appealed the injunction, contending that the law is constitutional and 
urging that it be allowed to take effect pending trial. But on Oct. 12, a state 
Court of Appeal upheld the injunction, concluding that the plaintiffs in the 
suit had offered considerable evidence that the statute is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
It had been widely expected that the attorney general would take the issue to 
the state Supreme Court. But in Monday's brief announcement, made by an 
assistant to Van de Kamp, the state said it will await a trial instead. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than petition the Supreme Court to hear the case at this stage, we have 
concluded that the best interests of the state will be served by developing a 
full evidentiary record," said Chief Assistant Atty. Gen. Richard Martland. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Court of Appeal, at this stage of the proceedings, had 
considered only the evidence presented by the challengers to the law. At trial, 
he said, the state's position could be presented in more detail. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, a candidate for governor, has said that he is personally opposed 
to abortion but has publicly supported a woman's right to an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
An anti-abortion movement leader denounced the attorney general's action, 
noting that it will result in a lengthy delay before the law could take effect. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been in the courts for nearly two years already, and now we're going 
back to lowest level in the court system," said Janet B. Carroll, legislative 
director for the California Pro-Life Council. "We believe this frustrates the 
will of the 80% of the people who favor parental consent laws. 
</P>
<P>
The action, however, was welcomed as "entirely appropriate" by Dorothy Ehrlich, 
executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern 
California, whose attorneys represent opponents of the law in their suit 
against state officials.

SURVIVOR OF NIMITZ IS OFF CRITICAL LIST

Buck Helm, the beefy earthquake survivor who stunned the world by living nearly 
90 hours under an avalanche of concrete and steel, amazed his doctors once 
again Monday by signaling that he was feeling no pain despite severe injuries 
resulting from his ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to talk because of a breathing tube down his throat, the 57-year-old 
Helm still managed to move his head from side to side when asked if anything 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"He shook his head, and everyone was incredulous," said Dr. Floyd Huen, medical 
director at Highland General Hospital. Helm has been there since Saturday, when 
rescue workers pried him from the squashed remains of his tiny Chevrolet Sprint 
in the ruins of the Nimitz Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Though suffering from broken ribs, bruised lungs, a skull fracture and kidney 
failure, Helm was taken off the critical list Monday. His condition was 
upgraded to "serious but stable." 
</P>
<P>
Huen said his kidneys, which doctors at first feared had sustained permanent 
damage, appear to be regaining normal function. Still, Huen said that Helm will 
need to spend a few more days on a respirator and that his body still shows 
signs of infection. 
</P>
<P>
"In the next 24 to 48 hours, if he continues the way he is now, he will be out 
of the woods," Huen said. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors may have been surprised by Helm's resilience, but Lorene Helm, his 
ex-wife and still close friend, was not. "We've been divorced for four years, 
and he hasn't given up on me yet," she told reporters during a brief hospital 
news conference. "I guess you could say that's positive." 
</P>
<P>
Like Cecelia Cichan, the 4-year-old "miracle child" who was the lone survivor 
of a 1987 Northwest Airlines jet crash in Detroit that killed 156 others, Helm 
has become a source of inspiration for many in the Bay Area still reeling from 
the effects of last week's quake. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, at the New Orleans Room in the posh Fairmount Hotel on Monday, 
bandleader Jimmy Price premiered what he called "The Ballad of Buck Helm:" 
</P>
<P>
"Hey Buck, we're pulling for you. Your heart is pulling us through. Our hopes 
were down, but you opened our eyes to tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
"They call him Lucky Bucky," said Will Fry, another of Helm's physicians. "It 
seems appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
A burly, rough-edged eccentric, Helm would seem a ready-made candidate to fill 
the role of folk hero. 
</P>
<P>
Although he lives in Weaverville, 250 miles north of Oakland in rural Trinity 
County, he spends weekdays working at the docks in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
When in Oakland, he apparently slept in a rusty yellow panel truck parked at 
the docks and showered each morning at a nearby YMCA. The truck, with the words 
"Weaverville Flash" painted in orange on the side, was loaded with a mattress, 
a Snoopy sleeping bag, some clothes and pictures of his four children, the 
Associated Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
When the upper deck of the Nimitz collapsed around him last Tuesday, Helm was 
on his way to a legal gambling parlor in Emeryville for a night of poker. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his improving condition, doctors said Monday that they are monitoring 
Helm closely for any signs of a relapse of his kidney condition. Sometimes, 
they said, the kidneys of patients who suffer the kind of injuries that Helm 
did have trouble readjusting to solid food and water. 
</P>
<P>
Although Helm was being fed through a tube on Monday, doctors said they 
discontinued kidney dialysis. They said he was lapsing in and out of 
consciousness but that he occasionally smiled and wrote notes to friends from 
his bed in the hospital's fourth-floor intensive care unit.

BAY AREA QUAKE;

<P>
BART GIVES THOUSANDS SMOOTH BUT CROWDED LIFT TO WORK

As the jam-packed Bay Area Rapid Transit train descended early Monday into its 
tunnel under San Francisco Bay, the eyes of its passengers opened wide. A few 
exchanged nervous smiles, a silent acknowledgement of fear. 
</P>
<P>
But Ethel Oden spoke optimistically about the transportation system that linked 
her East Bay home to work in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not afraid of being trapped in the tunnel during a quake," she said. "It 
was the freeways that fell and the buildings that collapsed. The safest place 
to be is in the subway." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, anyway, it was also one of the most popular places to be, as the 
17-year-old transit system affirmed the faith of Ethel Oden and more than 
100,000 others. On the day that traffic experts looked to the Bay Area with 
dread, BART bore the brunt of residents' scrambling efforts to avoid gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted by slashing rain and a chill wind, a record number of commuters 
forced out of their cars by the earthquake's destruction deluged train stations 
and squeezed into rail cars. Hundreds lined up outside closed station gates as 
early as 4 a.m. to assure themselves of both a parking place -- which proved 
the toughest victory of the day -- and a seat on the rush-hour trains. Hours 
later, they crowded 20 deep at ticket stations to start the ride home. 
</P>
<P>
It was chaotic. BART and thousands of transit neophytes met for the first time 
Monday, and the union was not always pretty. First-time riders showed up with 
$20 bills, and when those wouldn't work in ticket machines, they had to beg 
money from others. Elsewhere, BART workers hawked tickets like carnival 
hucksters. In North Berkeley, they signed up Teresa Kennedy, the second alto in 
the East Bay Faith Center choir, to do to their bidding. "Tickets! BART 
tickets! $5! $10! $20! $30!" she sang. 
</P>
<P>
It was crowded. Each BART car holds 72 seats, and virtually all were filled 
Monday during the morning and evening rush hours, even though BART had added 
cars to each of its trains. Another 60 to 70 people jammed into each car as 
well, standing uncomfortably for the duration of their trip, a common plight in 
transit systems of other cities but rare for BART. According to BART officials, 
nearly 273,000 people had ridden the trains by 8:30 p.m. A typical day would 
have seen 220,000 passengers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"This morning, this afternoon -- I felt like a head of cattle," mourned 
commuter Jim Hampton. 
</P>
<P>
But BART officials were beaming, sure that the system's performance Monday 
would win them converts. Not that many commuters have much choice, with four 
major freeways in the Bay Area knocked out by the earthquake's wrath and 
unlikely to be repaired soon. 
</P>
<P>
"This is BART's shining hour," said Michael Healy, a transit system spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The trip in from Concord, the northernmost BART station on the East Bay, was 
typical. 
</P>
<P>
At 5:45 a.m., the sprawling parking lot surrounding the Concord BART station 
was filled to capacity. In the pre-dawn darkness, headlights turned toward the 
exits and drivers began parking along residential streets as far as half a mile 
away. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I got the last place in the lot," said a triumphant and smiling Alida 
Boonstra, a BART regular. "It was one tiny space hidden between two trucks." 
</P>
<P>
Subway novices abounded. Women in high heels slid about as they tried to 
maneuver across the station. Others fumbled with ticket machines and awkwardly 
bumped through turnstiles. 
</P>
<P>
The veterans, however, were prepared -- they arrived wearing rain boots and 
carrying monthly passes. 
</P>
<P>
"This is unbelievable. I've never seen it like this," Boonstra said. 
</P>
<P>
As commuters collapsed their soaking umbrellas and rushed toward escalators, 
the station manager blurted over the intercom: 
</P>
<P>
"Do not run! Do not run!" 
</P>
<P>
When the doors of the 6 a.m. Concord train slid closed, it was standing room 
only in all 10 cars. 
</P>
<P>
And the crowds built as the workday drew closer. By the third stop of 10 before 
San Francisco, not one additional person could slip onto the train. The windows 
fogged, blurring the masses of commuters waiting at other stations. 
</P>
<P>
One woman tried to sneak into a train car at one station, only to hear a stern 
warning from the intercom: "Please clear the door!" She backed away. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the steamy train, several passengers began to rethink their options. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I should start looking for a job on this side of the bay," Boonstra 
said. "I'm not sure how long I can keep up with this." 
</P>
<P>
But despite the crowded conditions and the hectic tenor of the day, several 
infrequent BART riders said they were impressed with the speed of subway 
travel. 
</P>
<P>
And some first-time riders were thinking of abandoning the Bay Bridge and the 
car commute altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"This is fabulous," said Ed Grochowsky, 64, who travels to San Francisco 
several times a week for medical treatment. "I had always thought it was easier 
to drive, but parking in San Francisco is harder than parking at the station." 
</P>
<P>
While the rain drew criticism from just about everyone, there were few 
complaints about the BART system itself, apart from the crush of the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Systemwide, only one temporary train breakdown was reported in the morning. A 
second delay, in the evening, was blamed on an impatient commuter who jammed a 
door trying to board. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was well-behaved," said BART spokesman Healy. "There were no 
altercations or reports of rude pushing."

NO REASON TO GET INVOLVED, RAFSANJANI SAYS OF LEBANON HOSTAGES;

<TEXT>
<P>
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani declared Monday that his government has no 
immediate interest in pursuing the release of foreign hostages in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any reason to get ourselves involved in this matter," he told 
reporters here. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, who pronounced himself willing to help in the midst of the hostage 
crisis two months ago, fell back on his subsequent position that "conditions 
are not right" for an effort on Tehran's part now. 
</P>
<P>
He repeated specifically his demand that the United States demonstrate "good 
will" by releasing impounded Iranian assets. 
</P>
<P>
His response to repeated questions on the hostage issue quashed speculation 
that Iran had invited foreign journalists to a press conference here to 
announce some development on the hostages. 
</P>
<P>
With more than 100 reporters and television crews crowded into a reception hall 
of a former royal palace, the brown-robed and white-turbaned president entered, 
took a chair, made no statement and fielded questions for nearly three hours. 
</P>
<P>
The first -- why has Iran not moved on the hostage issue? -- went directly to 
the point. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt if Western governments want to solve this problem," Rafsanjani 
responded. "I do have an interest in putting this at an end. We have already 
guided them (foreign capitals) to the clear ways, but they have never acted. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to us that they want this problem to exist. They want to use it for 
their special purposes." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the longstanding demand for release of the frozen assets, estimated at 
anywhere from $2 billion to $12 billion and impounded at the start of the 
Iran's Islamic revolution more than a decade ago, Rafsanjani repeated a second 
demand: release of three Iranians taken hostage in Lebanon in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"If you think that Iran's hostages are dead (according to some reports in 
Lebanon)," he said, addressing Western reporters in his audience, "you have to 
give us their bodies, give us the documents they were carrying, show us where 
they were buried and introduce us to their killers." 
</P>
<P>
And, he said, "if one day we are to get involved, we will act in such a way 
that the problems of all hostages -- Iranians in Lebanon, Lebanese in Israel 
and other hostages in Lebanon -- can be solved in a coordinated manner." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Bush Administration officials said Rafsanjani's linkage of 
hostages with the Iran claims issue was nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
"The hostage issue is a humanitarian one and is not linked to other issues," 
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is well-known on the hostages," she added. "We will not make 
deals, and we will not reward hostage takers. Anyone who has influence with the 
hostage takers should use it to obtain the immediate and unconditional release 
of all the hostages. . . . The matter of Iranian assets is pending before the 
Iran-United States Claim Tribunal. These matters are being resolved at the 
tribunal, which conducts its business in a legal and technical manner, and has 
no connection or linkage whatsoever with the hostage issue." 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here say there has been no sign of recent Iranian activity on the 
hostage issue, and despite the conditions raised Monday by Rafsanjani, there 
are also domestic political restraints on his making a unilateral move. 
</P>
<P>
Several times during the press conference, the president chided Western 
reporters and their governments for focusing on the 16 Western hostages, 
including eight Americans, held in Lebanon. "You have to have the same feelings 
and sentiment toward other people as you do to people in the West," he reproved 
one questioner. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking softly and deliberately, and fingering a chain of green worry beads, 
Rafsanjani appeared well-rehearsed on a range of subjects raised by reporters: 
the stalemate in peace talks with Iraq on the eight-year Persian Gulf War, 
halted by a truce in August, 1988; his five-year plan for reconstruction and 
development of the economy and relations with Iran's regional neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
But time and again the questions came back to the hostages. Among the 
observations of the 55-year-old cleric who has succeeded the late Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini as the nation's political leader: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The pro-Iranian Hezbollah organization in Lebanon, which he favorably 
labeled "the most combative and self-sacrificial in the region," has no 
connection with the hostages. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Those who take hostages are not known," he said. "We tried to find them 
through intermediaries. It is not easy. If it was, the United States, France 
and Britain would have done it before us." He denied that recent visits by 
Hezbollah leaders to Tehran involved the hostage issue. 
</P>
<P>
 -- While denying any knowledge of them, Rafsanjani characterized the kidnapers 
as "tyrannized" groups. "They are like a small child who cannot bear a 
difficulty," he lectured. "Who has made this small child to cry?" 
</P>
<P>
Iran, he said, does not blame small groups, it blames governments. "You have to 
condemn Israel," he insisted. "You have to condemn the United States, which has 
supported the Maronites (leaders of Lebanon's Christian community)." 
</P>
<P>
Several times during the press conference, Rafsanjani lashed out at the United 
States. American firms will have no role in potential foreign investment in 
Iran's economic plans, he said. The 10th anniversary of the seizure of the U.S. 
Embassy in Tehran by student militants will be celebrated Nov. 4 as an 
"important incident" in the history of the Islamic republic. 
</P>
<P>
Other than indirect contacts during last summer's hostage crisis, he said, he 
has not had any exchange with a U.S. official since Robert C. McFarlane's trip 
to Tehran during the Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
To give life to Tehran-Washington relations, he concluded, the United States 
should release the frozen funds: "You will have to do it eventually, so act 
now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Pawns on the Middle East chessboard, Western hostages in Lebanon now number 16 
-- eight Americans, three Britons, two Swiss kidnaped earlier this month, an 
Italian and two other unspecified Westerners seized in a West Beirut store in 
January, 1987. Probably the most prominent hostage -- and the subject of the 
most rumors -- is Terry Waite, envoy of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who has 
been missing since January, 1987. Longest-held hostage: American Terry A. 
Anderson of the Associated Press, abducted in March, 1985.

Iran can go to a United States court to enforce arbitration awards by a claims 
tribunal created when U.S. hostages were released in 1981, a federal appeals 
court ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower-court decision requiring a 
Los Angeles-area firm, Gould Marketing Inc., to pay $3.6 million to the Iranian 
government in a contract dispute over military communications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. lawyer for Iran said the ruling was the first by an appellate court on 
the issue.

EUROPE: THE COMMUNIST NATION'S FIRST INDEPENDENT TRADE UNION SHOWS THAT THE 
WAVE OF DISSENT HAS REACHED THE FACTORY FLOOR.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Workers in an East Berlin factory on Monday announced the formation of the 
country's first independent trade union. 
</P>
<P>
Hours later, more than 100,000 East Germans demonstrated in Leipzig, calling on 
the new government to institute political and economic reforms. It was the 
first big demonstration since Egon Krenz took over last Wednesday as East 
Germany's Communist leader. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for workers at the Wilhelm Pieck engineering and electronics plant 
in Teltow, on the outskirts of East Berlin, said many were leaving the official 
East German labor movement and joining the independent union, called Reform. He 
gave no number but said some entire departments had made the move. 
</P>
<P>
There was no comment from the government. Announcement of the formation of an 
independent union was the first sign that the present wave of dissent, the 
worst since the workers' uprising of 1953, had gone beyond students and 
intellectual leaders to the factory floor. 
</P>
<P>
For many, it recalled the beginnings of Solidarity, the independent trade union 
in Poland. Solidarity was outlawed soon after it was organized in 1980 but 
continued to struggle. Last summer, the Solidarity movement took over the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Ralf Boerger, a spokesman for the workers at the Teltow plant, said they were 
leaving the official labor federation because it "does not serve the interests 
of the majority of workers and does not enjoy the confidence of the workers." 
</P>
<P>
 He quoted from a statement that calls on the government to grant all workers 
the right to strike and the right to demonstrate, to guarantee freedom of the 
press, to remove all restrictions on foreign travel and to end official 
privileges. 
</P>
<P>
He said the statement has been handed out at factories all across the country 
through an opposition group called the Social Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
The new union, the statement said, "has obligations only to its own members and 
will not subordinate itself to the decisions of political parties or other 
organizations." 
</P>
<P>
"In today's critical situation," it went on, "we appeal to all colleagues in 
our enterprise and all workers in our republic to take on the responsibility 
for our common future." 
</P>
<P>
The Reform announcement came on the heels of a statment by labor official Harry 
Tisch, a member of the Politburo, who was quoted Monday in the union newspaper 
Tribuene as saying that trade unions must show more independence and must stop 
working so closely with management and the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
"It's better," he said, "if each union finds and represents its own position." 
</P>
<P>
In Leipzig, as occurred at a similar turnout last Monday night, police and 
security forces were present but made no attempt to interfere with the peaceful 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
East Germans also demonstrated in other cities Monday. In nearby Halle, more 
than 10,000 marched in a peaceful demonstration for economic and political 
reform. They shouted "Gorby! Gorby!" -- referring to Soviet President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev and the reforms he has introduced in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
In the northwestern city of Schwerin, several thousand people were reported to 
have attended an organized meeting to discuss with Communist officials such 
problems as shortages of consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
Here in East Berlin, several thousand gathered at the Gethsemane church to 
support a candlelight vigil that has been going on around the clock in behalf 
of people arrested in previous Leipzig demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Protestant Church sources said that Monday night's turnout in Leipzig was as 
large or larger than last week's. On that occasion, an estimated 100,000 to 
120,000 marched to protest the restrictive policies of Erich Honecker, the 
hard-line leader who resigned under pressure two days later. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's demonstrators called out, "Egon, what about free elections?" 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said the Leipzig march indicated that Krenz and his regime 
will have to move quickly to satisfy the pent-up frustrations of East Germans. 
One observed, "His police can't arrest 120,000 people for marching peacefully." 
</P>
<P>
The Leipzig march started, as has become customary in recent weeks, in Karl 
Marx Platz after Monday night church services. The demonstrators merged and 
marched 10 abreast along the ring road that surrounds the city center, some 
carrying banners urging "Power to New Forum," a reference to the largest 
opposition group. New Forum has signed up more than 26,000 followers in the 
past few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's developments suggested to many analysts in Berlin that Krenz's 
apparent effort to portray his new regime as more responsive to popular wishes 
has yet to win any broad acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
"He has to do more than talk about reform," a diplomat with long experience 
here said. "He has to do something."

HUNGARY OFFICIALLY DECLARED A REPUBLIC

<TEXT>
<P>
Forty years of Communist rule formally came to an end Monday as Hungary 
officially declared itself an independent republic. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a prelude to a new historical age," acting head of state Matyas Szuros 
said, declaring the republic at noon in a speech to tens of thousands packing 
Parliament Square in Budapest. "The Hungarian republic is going to be an 
independent, democratic and legal state in which the values of bourgeois 
democracy and democratic socialism are expressed equally." 
</P>
<P>
The Communist People's Republic of Hungary is dead, Szuros declared. "As of 
today, our nation's name is the Republic of Hungary." 
</P>
<P>
As Szuros pronounced the words "Republic of Hungary," the crowd erupted in 
cheers. Church bells throughout the country peeled at noon. 
</P>
<P>
The proclamation came on the 33rd anniversary of the Hungarian Uprising, the 
revolt against Communist rule that began on Oct. 23, 1956, and was crushed by 
Soviet tanks 12 days later, killing as many as 32,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
In the evening, a crowd bearing flashlights and estimated by organizers at more 
than 100,000 interrupted speeches before Parliament with shouts of "Russians 
Out! Russians Out!" 
</P>
<P>
Others tore the Communist hammer-and-sickle symbol from red, white and green 
Hungarian flags, as had the activists of the 1956 uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Announcement of Hungary's new status followed a purge by Parliament last week 
of all Stalinist elements from Hungary's 1949 constitution, which defined the 
country as a socialist people's republic according supreme power to the working 
class. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from East Germany, which calls itself a democratic republic, all of 
Hungary's East Bloc allies define themselves as either people's republics or 
socialist republics. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great day for Hungary," said one senior Western diplomat present in 
the square, where elderly people with moist eyes mingled with young people in a 
mainly festive mood. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the State Department congratulated Hungary, saying the choice of 
the day for the announcement was particularly significant. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary is well on the way to achieving the ambitions thwarted 33 years ago. 
And this time, as Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth said Sunday, Hungary does not 
have to fear defeat by a foreign power. 
</P>
<P>
"Our hands are not tied," he said in a televised speech. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary's first multi-party parliamentary elections since 1947 are due to take 
place by the middle of next year.

The absenteeism rate of Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) on Senate roll-call votes 
rose sharply this month as he campaigned for governor of California and 
remained in the state for a firsthand look at earthquake relief activities 
before returning to Washington Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Although he missed only three of 242 roll calls in the first nine months of 
this year, Wilson failed to vote 22 consecutive times because he has been out 
of town since Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, his voting absenteeism rate shot up from a near-perfect 1.24% 
through Oct. 7 to 9.4% for the year as a whole -- one of the worst records in 
the Senate for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
A Congressional Quarterly survey for the first nine months of this year 
indicated that the typical senator's voting absenteeism rate is 1% or 2%. At 
the time of the survey, which covered a period ending Sept. 28, the worst 
record was held by Sen. Spark M. Matsunaga (D-Hawaii), who was ill during the 
summer months and missed 24% of Senate votes. The second-worst record was held 
by Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.), who missed 16% of votes, and ranked 
third-worst was Sen. William L. Armstrong (R-Colo.) at 9%. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), however, did not miss a vote, although he joined 
members of the California delegation in the House for a one-day trip to 
Northern California to view the after-effects of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson, who is the leading GOP candidate for governor, already is under 
pressure by his supporters to spend more time in California to offset the 
constant presence in the state of Democratic Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, a 
potential opponent in the gubernatorial race. 
</P>
<P>
A review of Senate records shows that Wilson missed eight roll-call votes on a 
deficit reduction package and election aid to Nicaragua before the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
After the disaster occurred, he missed 14 other roll calls, including a vote on 
a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning, a $156-billion appropriations 
bill and a dozen roll calls in the Senate's historic impeachment trial of 
federal Judge Alcee L. Hastings.

PRESIDENT OKS NEW CURBS ON OFFSHORE DRILLING; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: DESPITE HIS RESERVATIONS ABOUT PRE-LEASING RESTRAINTS OFF 
CALIFORNIA, BUSH SIGNS THE $11.2-BILLION INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS BILL.

President Bush on Monday signed into law tough restrictions on offshore oil 
drilling and pre-lease preparation activities, temporarily settling another 
struggle between drilling interests and lawmakers stirred by the Exxon Valdez 
oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the far-reaching moratorium were worked out by House and Senate 
conferees last month as part of the $11.2-billion appropriations bill for the 
Department of the Interior. The President signed it in spite of reservations 
about pre-leasing restraints off the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
"Notwithstanding these reservations, I have signed the bill because its 
benefits -- particularly the treatment of many environmental, conservation and 
energy-related issues important to the nation -- outweigh my reservations," the 
President declared. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Bush set aside aggressive drilling plans for the outer 
continental shelf until a task force he created could complete studies of the 
impact of drilling off the coasts of Southern and Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
But the House went even further, extending the moratorium to the huge Lease 
Sale 119 off the central California coast. Language inserted into the bill also 
suspended pre-lease activity off the central coast. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the restraints on drilling and drilling preparation off 
California, the measure signed by Bush also temporarily prohibits drilling off 
the coast of Massachusetts, in an area of the outer shelf stretching along the 
Mid-Atlantic states, the eastern Gulf of Mexico and off the Florida Keys. 
</P>
<P>
The National Research Council is due to make a report to the President's 
drilling task force next week, giving its assessment of the impact of offshore 
drilling. Task force recommendations are due to be on the President's desk by 
Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., the task force chairman, has indicated 
that the panel may decide to give the President an outline of options in 
offshore drilling policy rather than presenting formal recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
When the Senate passed the Interior bill earlier this year, it placed no 
restraints upon pre-lease activities -- steps that include studies and paper 
work. But when the measure went to conference to work out differences with the 
House version of the bill, California congressmen pressed for a ban on any 
pre-leasing activity, including the preparation of environmental impact 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
A standoff threatened to send the offshore drilling provisions back to the 
floor of both houses unresolved. However, Rep. Bill Lowery (R-San Diego) struck 
a compromise banning pre-lease activity until five months after completion of 
the task force report to the President. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery said the compromise will effectively prevent any pre-lease activity off 
the central coast for the rest of the current fiscal year. Pre-lease activities 
were nearing completion and the preparations were proceeding toward leases off 
the northern and southern coasts when Bush's drilling moratorium was declared. 
</P>
<P>
The measure signed Monday also included compromise language attempting to 
protect the logging industry in the Pacific Northwest, while at the same time 
saving the habitat of the endangered spotted owl. 
</P>
<P>
Both the environmental questions and Congress' addition of more than $952 
million to the Administration's Interior budget request were lost in an uproar 
over the bill's funding for the National Endowment for the Humanities. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) tried to attach an amendment blocking funding for 
"obscene or indecent" art, but lawmakers managed to somewhat defuse the 
furiously debated issue with a compromise blocking federal funding of such 
material if it is without serious "literary artistic, political, or scientific 
value."

FDA BANS CHINESE MUSHROOMS AFTER FOOD POISONINGS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: U.S. OFFICIALS SAY THEY BELIEVE CONTAMINATION "MAY BE WIDESPREAD" IN 
THE ASIAN

<P>
The Food and Drug Administration announced Monday that it will indefinitely ban 
all shipments of canned mushrooms from China following what the FDA called "a 
significant and alarming" series of outbreaks of severe food poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
FDA officials said they believed that contamination with staphylococcal 
enterotoxin "may be widespread" throughout the mushroom processing industry in 
China, and the ban will continue "until satisfactory sanitation control 
measures" are implemented in China. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 -- the latest figures available -- the United States imported 158 
million pounds of mushrooms in containers, 41% of which came from China, 
according to the Assn. of Food Industries, a major importer of processed foods. 
</P>
<P>
"If prices were the same as they were in 1987, they've lost $41.5 million in 
trade," said Richard Sullivan, a spokesman for the importers' association. 
"That's a pretty significant loss in trade dollars for China." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan estimated that Chinese mushrooms accounted for about 25% of the canned 
mushrooms consumed in the United States last year. A statement from the Chinese 
Embassy in Washington said that the problem was confined to a few cases, and 
that effective corrective measures have already been taken. "This will not 
benefit China-U.S. trade," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA action represents a major expansion of a ban that began last May with 
institutional-size cans following four outbreaks of illness in which about 100 
people became sick. No one died, but 16 people were hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the FDA said, inspectors have identified contamination in 
additional smaller sizes of cans produced by 10 plants in China. Also, the 
agency said, the FDA has reason to believe that two processing plants in China 
that have not been approved by the United States may have used the codes of 
other, approved plants to try to export their products illegally. 
</P>
<P>
"The results of our investigation give us no reason to have confidence in the 
safety of any style or any size can of mushrooms processed in the PRC (People's 
Republic of China)," said Ronald G. Chessmore, the FDA's acting associate 
commissioner for regulatory affairs, in a letter to Chinese officials here. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, all of the illnesses have been linked to mushrooms shipped in 
68-ounce or No. 10 institutional-size cans. "This is not the size a consumer 
would be expected to buy," said Chris Lecos, a spokesman for the FDA. Last 
spring, Lecos said, the agency notified all state health and other regulatory 
officials responsible for retail food markets, as well as all major trade 
associations responsible for the distribution of these products, alerting them 
to potential contamination. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, the FDA has found toxin in size 5.5 and 16-ounce cans, 
which consumers can purchase in retail outlets. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot rule out the possibility that smaller size cans may have ended up on 
the retail food shelf and in someone's home," Lecos said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "any product produced by the PRC, from any one of the 
processing plants, would be so identified. It would be very clear that this 
product came from the PRC. It has to be labeled. That's one of the 
requirements." 
</P>
<P>
Lecos said that products shipped from now on either will remain at the port of 
entry or returned to China. Brined mushrooms, which are customarily shipped in 
bulk to U.S. plants for canning under a U.S. company's label, will have to be 
tested privately by importers before the FDA will allow their release, the 
agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Lecos said that "the burden is on the Chinese" to prove their processing plants 
are safe and sanitary and the FDA will not allow mushrooms into the United 
States until it is satisfied that this has been accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA said that 62 mushroom processing plants in China are currently 
registered with the FDA, as required of both domestic and foreign manufacturers 
of low-acid canned foods. 
</P>
<P>
"In all our previous dealings with representatives of the Chinese government we 
have not been satisfied with the information we have received," Lecos said. He 
said the agency has offered to send an FDA team to China but "it is up to the 
Chinese" to allow them to come. 
</P>
<P>
He added: "This is a very serious problem that is widespread. Obviously China 
has a lot of work to do." 
</P>
<P>
Symptoms of food poisoning involving staphylococcal toxins can develop rapidly 
after eating a contaminated product, and include nausea, vomiting, retching, 
abdominal cramping and prostration. In more severe cases, headaches, muscle 
cramping and changes in blood pressure and pulse rate can also occur, the FDA 
said. In most cases, those stricken recover in two or three days.

NEW FOCUS ON KEY TEST FOR CANCER; 
</P>
<P>
RADIOLOGY: MAMMOGRAMS CAN PROVIDE VITAL EARLY WARNINGS OF BREAST CANCER, BUT 
SOME INVESTIGATION OF FACILITIES IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THE TESTS ARE 
PROPERLY CONDUCTED AND RESULTS ARE RELIABLE.

Recent concern about the accuracy of Pap tests not only has underscored the 
need for greater care with that type of cancer detection. It also has given new 
relevance to a quiet effort to improve the accuracy of one of the few other 
mass-screening tools for cancer: mammography. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Pap test, the mammogram offers women choices and a competitive 
market in which to make them. 
</P>
<P>
But until recently there has been no easy way for a woman to know that the 
facility she chooses will detect problems early enough to prevent her from 
being among the 43,000 women who die every year from breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, radiologists concede, faulty procedures and inadequate quality control 
in some cases have resulted in poor-quality mammograms that miss small cancers. 
</P>
<P>
No one can say how many women may have been given a false sense of assurance 
when in fact they had cancer, but "we're certain" it has happened, said Dr. 
Lawrence W. Bassett, director of the Iris Cantor Center for Breast Imaging at 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
How can a woman know if her mammography facility is a good one? "The answer," 
he said "is that until recently we really had no mechanism. Women were told . . 
. that if they asked certain questions they could find out. But that puts an 
awful lot of burden on women. You shouldn't have to do an investigation on your 
own every time you use a service," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bassett is helping to lead a national push by radiologists, the government and 
the American Cancer Society to remedy the problem by setting standards for 
quality mammography. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous concerns over excessive radiation doses -- concerns focusing on 
old or poorly adjusted equipment -- the latest effort aims at improving the 
more subtle procedural aspects of X-raying a woman's breasts. 
</P>
<P>
Getting a quality image while keeping the radiation dose down requires: 
well-adjusted equipment dedicated solely to mammography; extended processing of 
the film separate from other X-rays; well-supervised technicians; and proper 
positioning of a woman's breast against the X-ray film, Bassett said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the image that comes out is good, it's not only because the equipment's 
good, but because the technologist positioned the patient properly, the 
compression (of the breast) was adequate, and the radiologist knew how to read 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The keystone of the new push is a voluntary certification program by the 
American College of Radiology. Since its inception two years ago, the program 
has certified about 2,000 facilities as meeting its standards for taking and 
interpreting mammograms; 52 of these are in California, with another 59 in the 
state in the process of certification, said Marie Zinninger, who directs the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"This is meant to be an educational effort, to raise a level of awareness about 
what needs to be done to have quality mammography," Zinninger emphasized. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, facilities that don't pass usually adjust procedures or equipment 
and reapply successfully, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The government also is getting into the act. In California, the radiologic 
health branch of the Department of Health Services has drafted rules to require 
mammography facilities to regularly test their work to assure quality control, 
said Edgar Bailey, branch chief. It also will adopt rules of good practice for 
mammography. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the Medicare catastrophic care bill passed by Congress last year 
would have extended mammography benefits for the first time under a federal 
program. It also set up strict standards for the procedure similar to those 
advanced by the American College of Radiology. 
</P>
<P>
Since Medicare regulations often become the norm throughout the health care 
industry, mammography advocates were elated at what they saw as a first step 
toward making the test a routine part of health care covered by private medical 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
But mammography coverage may be excluded in the current effort to repeal 
catastrophic health care. The House voted Oct. 4 to repeal the entire 
catastrophic care bill. Mammography coverage was one of a few provisions that 
the Senate voted Oct. 6 to retain, while repealing most of the bill, said Ray 
Gill, a spokesman for the Health Care Financing Administration. The difference 
is being resolved in a conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
For a woman seeking a mammogram, the national focus on quality will, in the 
future, make it easier to have confidence that her test will be properly 
conducted. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, there is still an element of investigation necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The American College of Radiology's program, so far, has certified only about a 
third of 6,400 mammography facilities known to be in existence in 1988. 
(Zinninger estimates the number may have risen now to as high as 8,000.) 
</P>
<P>
American Cancer Society offices have lists of accredited facilities in their 
areas. State-by-state lists of accredited facilities also are available from 
the federal Cancer Information Service, (800) 4-CANCER (800-422-6237). 
</P>
<P>
If there are no accredited facilities nearby, women still must do some 
investigating to ensure the quality of their mammogram. But by making some 
relatively simple inquiries, they can greatly increase their chances of 
undergoing a test that results in good-quality images with minimal radiation 
exposure, Bassett said. 
</P>
<P>
Radiologists note that the lowest dosage isn't always the best. That's because 
a dose that is too low means an inadequate X-ray, radiologists say. 
</P>
<P>
According to the federal Center for Devices and Radiological Health, the 
average radiation dose from a single mammogram has decreased from unacceptable 
levels as high as 6 1/2 rems in 1974 to averages of 1/4 to 1/2 of a rem in 
1985. (A rem is a measure of the biological effect of radiation; a chest X-ray 
is about 0.030 of a rem -- more commonly expressed as 30 millirems, or 
thousandths of a rem. By comparison, cosmic rays and other environmental 
sources of radiation deliver 100 to 200 millirems to each American annually.) 
</P>
<P>
In a 1988 national survey by the Food and Drug Administration's Center for 
Devices and Radiological Health, however, new imaging techniques that can spot 
smaller cancers had increased the average mammogram dosage very slightly. That 
is because these techniques require higher energy to produce an image. 
</P>
<P>
The same study found that the quality of American mammography facilities -- 
measured by having them X-ray "phantoms" embedded in opaque material -- had 
improved as much as 22% between 1985 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the American Cancer Society advises that a mammography test involving 
two views of the breast should deliver no more than 1 rem of radiation, notes 
Dr. Judy Dean, a Santa Monica radiologist. 
</P>
<P>
Dean said doses that are 20% of that can easily be achieved. Women needn't 
worry about radiation dose if the facility they or their doctor selects meets 
the American College of Radiology standards, she suggested. (Her own 
mammography center is undergoing certification.) 
</P>
<P>
More important is getting women to come in for mammograms at all, she said. 
Data from the 1987 National Health Interview Survey showed that only 37% of 
women 40 and older have ever had a mammogram. 
</P>
<P>
A coalition of 11 groups, including the National Cancer Institute and the 
American Cancer Society, united earlier this year to endorse mammograms every 
one to two years for all women ages 40 to 50, and annually for all women older 
than 50. 
</P>
<P>
There appears to be agreement on that as a minimum standard, but some doctors 
-- including Bassett and the 65,000-member American College of Physicians -- 
contend that mammograms should be done annually on all woman older than 40. 
</P>
<P>
This, they say, is necessary because cancers are harder to detect, yet more 
likely to be of the fast-growing type in a premenopausal woman's dense breast 
tissue. As women age, this glandular tissue is replaced by fatty tissue that is 
easier to image. 
</P>
<P>
Dean said she thinks she knows why women don't get mammograms: "In some ways, 
it's the same thing that keeps them from going to the dentist -- unpleasant, 
easy to put off. But if you go to the dentist what's the worst thing you can 
get? Maybe a root canal. If you go to get a mammogram what's the worst thing 
you can hear? 'You have breast cancer. You might die.' It's a big anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
"I get patients in here so nervous, sometimes they arrive and they've been 
drinking. They're half-drunk because they couldn't face up to it otherwise," 
Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
What does she tell women who are fearful? "Getting a mammogram 99% of the time 
means getting good news. And if you're coming regularly, in my opinion you're 
never going to get the worst news. You're going to at most find out that you 
have something early that needs attention but is probably curable." 
</P>
<P>
HOW TO CHOOSE A MAMMOGRAPHY FACILITY 
</P>
<P>
The American College of Radiology's program has certified only about a third of 
6,400 mammography facilities known to be in existence in 1988. To get the list, 
call the Federal Cancer Information Service at (800) 4-CANCER. 
</P>
<P>
If there are no accredited facilities nearby, the American College of Radiology 
advises women to choose one that can answer "yes" to all the following 
questions, because such a facility is likely to produce good images with 
minimal radiation exposure. 
</P>
<P>
* Is the radiologist certified by the American Board of Radiology? 
</P>
<P>
* Are technologists certified by either the American Registry of Radiological 
Technologists or the state licensing board? 
</P>
<P>
* Is the X-ray equipment dedicated solely to mammography or specifically 
designed for it? 
</P>
<P>
* Is the equipment calibrated regularly by a certified radiological physicist? 
(Once a year is considered minimum.) 
</P>
<P>
* Have the radiologist and the technologist taken special courses or had 
additional training in mammography? 
</P>
<P>
* Does the radiologist do mammography as part of his or her regular practice? 
</P>

THE RAIN BRINGS QUIPS AND ANOTHER SOLID SET BY STONES

Gimme shelter, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody was ready with rain quips as the Rolling Stones' four-night stand 
came to a soggy, soggy end Sunday night at the umbrella-filled Coliseum: 
</P>
<P>
* "Why do you think they call it a wet suit?" asked Living Colour lead singer 
Corey Glover, whose customary bright, skin-tight bodywear came in handy when 
the downpour started halfway through his band's opening set. (Surprise Colour 
highlight: A soaked, climactic, metallic "Johnny B. Goode" in honor of Chuck 
Berry's 63rd birthday.) 
</P>
<P>
* "I wasn't planning on taking my shower till after the show," quipped Guns N' 
Roses' Axl Rose. (Surprise GNR highlight: Once the rain stopped, Rose 
celebrated by taking a mid-song jog around the Coliseum track.) 
</P>
<P>
* "Watch out for the acid rain," jested Mick Jagger, weakly, though the storm 
-- no respecter of audience persons, but deferential to true stardom, no doubt 
-- had moved along well before the Stones started themselves up. (Surprise 
Stones highlight: None. This was their usual solid, 25-song, 2 1/2-hour set, on 
which neither rain nor spontaneity intruded.) 
</P>
<P>
Those who waited until the fourth and final night to catch the triple bill -- 
which really has seemed at times like a battle of the bands (Guns N' Roses vs. 
Living Colour) or a battle within the band (GNR, again) -- missed out on any 
sense of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Rose was in a conciliatory, if still childishly foul-mouthed, mood. He 
apologized for stereotyping police as the enemy when introducing "Out of My 
Way" earlier in the week, praised the Coliseum security forces and bid adieu by 
casting his vote for the Stones as indeed "the world's greatest band." 
</P>
<P>
The tour now heads to New York's Shea Stadium for shows Wednesday, Thursday, 
Saturday and Sunday. The tour is scheduled to return to the West Coast on Nov. 
4 and 5 for concerts at the Oakland Coliseum stadium.

STONES QUIET THINGS DOWN; FANS ARE ON BEST BEHAVIOR

If you went back to see the Rolling Stones a second time after opening night at 
the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, you might have thought your hearing was 
failing. Don't worry -- it was louder Wednesday than on Thursday, Saturday and 
Sunday. The Stones turned down the volume by 15 decibels after the Los Angeles 
Police Department South Bureau received more than 300 complaints from area 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Chris Berglund, special events coordinator for the bureau, said Monday 
that his office asked City Attorney James Hahn to approach the Stones about the 
noise after Wednesday's opening-night show. The band and its production company 
agreed to turn the sound down, and only four more complaints were received 
during the three remaining concerts. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a lot of calls thanking us for our actions," Berglund said, adding that 
atmospheric conditions on Wednesday contributed to the excessive noise in the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Berglund reported that the Stones fans were well-behaved too. An average of 
fewer than 80 arrests were made at each concert, which drew approximately 
72,000 fans each. Sunday, with 122 arrests, was the busiest day for the police 
department, which for the first time at a Coliseum concert used its mobile jail 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
Berglund said that about 90% of the arrests were for narcotics, mostly 
marijuana possession. Given the six-hour length of the concerts, which also 
featured Guns N' Roses and Living Colour, Berglund said the crowds were less 
trouble than those at Raiders football games. "For the amount of people it was 
a very orderly crowd," he said. STEVE HOCHMAN

CRITIC AT LARGE: SOMMARS ESCAPED WITH HER YOUTH INTACT; 
</P>
<P>
ACTING: BEING TOO YOUNG FOR THE ROLE THAT BROUGHT JEAN SEBERG OVERNIGHT STARDOM 
TURNS OUT TO BE A BLESSING.

<P>
There are plenty of cautionary tales in the Hollywood chronicles: careers that 
rose and fell like rockets, careers that never quite got going, careers cut 
short by mischance. 
</P>
<P>
Few stories have seemed to me more bitterly sad than Jean Seberg's. The robust 
and beautiful young woman from Marshalltown, Iowa, had won an audition to be 
Otto Preminger's Joan of Arc in "Saint Joan," and you would have said, as the 
press releases did, that it was an updated Cinderella story. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out to be a nightmare of scathing, humiliating reviews that in effect 
drove Seberg to exile. And while the career resumed, after a fashion, and there 
were periods of happiness, the ending -- suicide in a car parked on a Paris 
street -- seemed as inevitable as anything in classic tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
I've often talked about the other side of the coin -- the disappointments that 
can later be seen as blessings in disguise -- with another actress from Iowa, 
Julie Sommars of Onawa, who shared a fateful afternoon with Seberg. 
</P>
<P>
Sommars, who currently plays the assistant district attorney and love interest 
opposite Andy Griffith on the "Matlock" series, knew Seberg because they were 
fellow competitors in Iowa state oratorical contests. "She was a senior and I 
was in ninth or tenth grade. She was doing 'Joan of Lorraine,' I was doing 
'Sorry, Wrong Number,' " Sommars said over lunch recently. 
</P>
<P>
The two young women -- and some 300 others -- went to Chicago to audition for 
Preminger for "Saint Joan" and, the seating being alphabetical, Seberg and 
Sommars found themselves sitting side by side. They sweated out the long parade 
of girls reciting, or starting to recite, the two speeches Preminger had had 
them memorize. 
</P>
<P>
"She dumped her street shoes in my lap and told me to watch them when she went 
in to see him," Sommars says. "She was in there what seemed like forever. When 
she came out she grabbed the shoes and said, 'He listened to both my speeches,' 
and marched away." 
</P>
<P>
Preminger listened to both of Sommars' recitations too, and then chatted with 
her. Would she like to go to New York? he asked her. "Not if it's anything like 
Chicago," she said, innocently, and Preminger roared with laughter. He asked 
how old she was. When she said 15, he said, "Thank you very much" and dismissed 
her. 
</P>
<P>
Sommars went back to Iowa, finished high school, came to California and studied 
at San Bernardino Valley College. She moved into the now-legendary Studio Club 
in Hollywood where many an aspiring actress lived. (Marilyn Monroe, another 
cautionary tale, was one of them.) 
</P>
<P>
Sommars got a job as a receptionist and began making the rounds, landing a job 
understudying the lead in a small theater production of "Our Town." In the 
useful show business tradition, the lead became ill, and Sommars went on and 
got good reviews. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't acting," she says. "Believe me, I was right out of Grover's Corners, 
and it was me." 
</P>
<P>
An agent saw her and two weeks later Sommars was playing Loretta Young's 
daughter in one of the playlets on "The Loretta Young Show." She was 19. She 
found more work in episodic television but felt she needed better training. 
</P>
<P>
On money she'd saved she flew to London and enrolled at the Actors Workshop, 
working briefly as a telephone operator but defeated by accents she found 
incomprehensible. She subsisted, she once told me, on tomato salad, cheese and 
warm Pepsis. 
</P>
<P>
After a year she quit London for New York, where she did off-Broadway plays and 
summer stock and toured with Edward Everett Horton, who told her she was the 
second-best ingenue he'd ever worked with. The best, he said consolingly, was 
Colleen Dewhurst. 
</P>
<P>
The Horton play, "Miss Pell Is Missing," brought her back to Hollywood, where 
she won an audition, this one with Ross Hunter for the lead opposite Brian 
Bedford in "The Pad, and How to Use It," a pleasant, modest entertainment based 
on Peter Shaffer's one-act play "The Private Ear." 
</P>
<P>
Since then she has made other films, including "Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo" at 
Disney and a now-you-see-her-now-you- don't appearance opposite Gene Hackman in 
"Bat 21." But essentially Sommars has made a comfortable, successful career in 
television movies ("The Harness") and series, including a run as the J. J. in 
"The Governor and J. J.," playing Dan Dailey's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
What began as a guest appearance on "Matlock," as a bright, flame-haired 
assistant D.A. who keeps losing to Griffith, turned into a continuing role. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sommars is happily married to a lawyer and has a daughter who will 
shortly be 17. Hers can be thought of as one of those non-cautionary Hollywood 
tales in which an actress's public and private lives are both eminently 
satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
What seems clear is that she escaped -- and it's the only way to say it -- the 
blinding light of overnight stardom that fell upon Jean Seberg and that proved 
in the end to be cruel, cold and fatal. 
</P>
<P>
There are worse things than being too young for a part.

KABC-AM TALKS A GOOD GAME BEFORE COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the latest round of radio moniker wars, a federal court judge has ruled that 
talk radio is not a generic term and that KABC-AM (790) has a right to use it 
as an identifying slogan while rival talk station KFI-AM (640) does not. 
</P>
<P>
In an order handed down late Friday but not received by the stations' attorneys 
until Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Richard A. Gadbois ruled against talk 
station KFI-AM (640), which had claimed that the term was generic. The judge's 
decision upheld a May ruling that enjoined KFI from using the term talk radio 
in conjunction with its call letters and dial position. 
</P>
<P>
"KABC has offered evidence that listeners in the Los Angeles AM radio market 
primarily associate talk radio with KABC, not with a program format," Gadbois 
wrote. "This evidence is sufficient such that a reasonable fact finder could 
find that talk radio is not a generic term." 
</P>
<P>
"All of us are delighted with the decision," KABC attorney Steven M. Perry said 
Monday. "This concludes the litigation at the trial court level." 
</P>
<P>
KFI attorneys said they probably will appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
KABC filed a trademark infringement suit against KFI in April, saying that it 
had the sole right to use the talk radio label in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In court papers, KABC said it adopted its all-talk format in 1960 and, in 1972, 
"invented and adopted the trademark and trade name 'KABC Talk Radio.' " The 
suit said KABC was the only station to use the term for 17 years until KFI 
began using the slogan in March, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The two stations argued in federal court Sept. 28 before Gadbois.

81 INJURED, 22 MISSING IN BLAST AT TEXAS PLANT; 
</P>
<P>
FIREBALL: DEBRIS IS HURLED FOR MILES. THE HOUSTON SHIP CHANNEL AND A HIGHWAY 
ARE CLOSED.

<P>
Explosions rocked a Phillips Petroleum Co. plastics plant Monday, hurling 
chunks of metal and other debris miles away and creating a fireball visible for 
15 miles. More than 80 people were known injured, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor John Ray Harrison said fire officials had told him that 22 people had not 
been accounted for more than four hours after the first explosion, and there 
were fears that at least some had died. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . How many, we don't know," said Dr. Paul Pepe, director of emergency 
services for Houston. "It could be three or four, or it could be more." 
</P>
<P>
Flames and intense heat were keeping rescue workers from getting close enough 
to investigate, Pepe said. 
</P>
<P>
At least 81 people were injured and were being treated at several hospitals for 
burns, breathing problems and cuts from flying debris, Pepe said. Seventy-two 
were plant workers. Nine non-employees suffered breathing difficulties or 
injuries from flying debris. Two burned women were described as being in 
critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
The blasts buckled a ceiling and blew out windows at an elementary school 
cafeteria about a mile away. None of the more than 700 pupils were injured, and 
they were all sent home, a school employee said. 
</P>
<P>
The explosions also shook buildings and broke glass at a nearby shopping mall, 
knocked out telephone lines in Pasadena and broke windows at Pasadena City 
Hall, 3 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
At the plant, leaking gas and broken water lines hampered firefighters, 
Phillips environmental director Bill Stoltz, who was at the scene, said. 
Firefighters were pumping water from a sewage treatment plant and the nearby 
Houston Ship Channel. At least five fire departments sent firemen to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Ambulances lined roadways to the complex, which sprawls over 800 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Several fires were visible beneath columns of dense smoke in the plant complex, 
and patches of grass smoldered outside. 
</P>
<P>
"A siren went off and, as we were evacuating . . . you could see a low fire 
coming down through the unit . . . and then the whole thing went up," said Bill 
Mann, who works at the facility and was about 150 yards from the explosions. 
"The compression came our way and knocked everybody down." 
</P>
<P>
Another witness, Joe Baccus, said: "When I came out of my office, I could see a 
huge explosion. It looked like an atomic bomb going off." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Manerly, a pipe fitter at the plant, said he heard hissing for about five 
minutes, then saw a white cloud. 
</P>
<P>
"I told a safety man I saw nothing but gas. Then it exploded. I ran. There were 
a lot of people running and screaming to get out. It's like nothing I've felt 
in my life," Manerly said. "I'm real lucky. Thank God for that." 
</P>
<P>
Maintenance worker Roby Clemons said that a warning message had been broadcast 
over the plant's emergency radio 20 seconds before the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
"I never saw people run so fast," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stoltz said the explosion occurred when a seal blew out on an ethylene loop 
reactor, releasing ethylene-isobutane, a compound used in making plastics. The 
plant manufactures plastics like those used in milk jugs and toys. 
</P>
<P>
He said firefighters were staying back from the main fires because of fears of 
more explosions. 
</P>
<P>
Although the chemicals are not toxic, they are "highly explosive," Stoltz said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 900 people work in shifts at the plant, built in 1948 on the Houston 
Ship Channel, said Dave Dryden, Phillips spokesman at company headquarters in 
Bartlesville, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard, fearing that the blaze could set off fires on the fuel tankers 
that sail the channel, closed a 2-mile length of the waterway, Petty Officer 
Dawn Isbell said. No ships reported damage. 
</P>
<P>
About 2 million barrels of crude oil and petroleum products a day are moved up 
and down the 50-mile-long channel, which connects Houston with the Gulf of 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to the bank, which was several miles from the area, and I could feel it 
shake," said Betty Parks, a police spokeswoman in Pasadena, just outside 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
The first explosion at Phillips' Houston Chemical Complex, just off Texas 
Highway 225 less than 10 miles southeast of downtown Houston, occurred about 1 
p.m., Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
Several explosions ensued, witnesses reported. 
</P>
<P>
Seismologists at Rice University in Houston said the blast appeared to be the 
equivalent of 10 tons of TNT. 
</P>
<P>
Officials closed a section of Highway 225, Parks said, but thousands of people 
lined up along freeways to watch yellow and green flames shooting from the 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
Baccus said he felt the explosion at his business at least 15 miles away and 
could see the flames and smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"I just saw a few minutes ago a huge fireball that's plainly visible. I'm now 
looking at the smoke, and it appears like three different fire centers; one is 
gigantic and two off to the side of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The flames are very tall. You can see the flames above the horizon," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I could see all kinds of debris in the air," witness Roy Berry said. "There 
were sheets of aluminum about 4 to 6 feet long falling. The air is saturated 
with material. I knew immediately what it was." 
</P>
<P>
Glen Dickey, who lives 5 miles from the plant, said he found a 6-foot piece of 
metal in a tree at his home. 
</P>
<P>
"Pieces of stuff were falling out of the sky. I got over there to my house, and 
my neighbors . . . were walking out . . . picking up pieces of metal and 
insulation off the roads," Dickey said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he and his wife were at a restaurant eating lunch when "all of a 
sudden the whole building shook." 
</P>
<P>
"Some people started hollering: 'Earthquake!' "

SUPREME COURT TO REOPEN S.F. OFFICES

<P>
The state Supreme Court, which was forced to abandon its San Francisco 
headquarters because of damage from the quake, announced Monday that it will 
resume operations this morning. 
</P>
<P>
One portion of the court building, constructed in 1917, remains too dangerous 
to be used and will remain closed, according to Lynn Holton, a court 
spokeswoman. The the other half, built in 1957, has been inspected and judged 
safe and will serve as the base of operations at least temporarily, she said.

COUNTY TO SEND ENGINEERS TO HELP ASSESS QUAKE DAMAGE IN S.F.

Orange County will send a team of as many as 90 engineers to help assess 
earthquake damage in San Francisco so that relief aid for the Bay Area can be 
expedited, the Board of Supervisors was told this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Wood, director of the Emergency Management Division for the county, said 
10 engineers will leave today. As many as 80 more will be sent Thursday, he 
said. Emergency management officials worked through the night Monday rounding 
up civil and structural engineers from both the public and private sector. 
</P>
<P>
A team of four firefighters and an observer has been working in the Bay Area 
since last Thursday and assisted in the rescue Saturday of the last known 
survivor on the Nimitz Freeway. Wood said preliminary reports from the team 
indicate that communications among local, state and federal agencies have not 
worked as well as envisioned in the area's emergency plans. 
</P>
<P>
Wood said Orange County should re-evaluate its interagency communication plans 
in the light of the problems in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lack of effective communication" among various levels of 
government, Wood told the supervisors. "It didn't work as the plans said it 
should." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors' Chairman Thomas F. Riley has asked Wood to report back next week 
on the county's overall emergency planning. 
</P>
<P>
"It's essential for the Board of Supervisors to evaluate our current 
capabilities and take whatever steps are necessary to deal with the very real 
possibility of an earthquake here in Orange County," Riley said.

<P>
NBC was back on top of the Nielsen ratings and ABC was at the bottom in an 
unusual week in which the San Francisco earthquake rocked television schedules, 
according to figures released today. 
</P>
<P>
ABC seemed certain to repeat its victory of the week before, when it ended 
NBC's 68-week winning streak. But the earthquake last Tuesday forced 
postponement of the World Series just as the third game was getting under way 
in San Francisco's Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's "Cheers" was first for the week ended Oct. 22, closely followed by "The 
Cosby Show." ABC's highest-ranked show was its Monday Night Football game 
between the Los Angeles Rams and the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
The networks' special coverage of the earthquake was not ranked by Nielsen 
because it was unscheduled and not sponsored. The network evening news shows, 
however, had nearly 5 million extra viewers who tuned in because of the quake. 
ABC was first, followed by CBS and NBC.

ITT Sheraton Corp. and Pan American World Airways Inc. today signed an 
agreement with the Soviet Union to build two luxury hotels in the Soviet 
capital with the first Sheraton Moscow Hotel to be completed in 1992 for $75 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The hotels will be operated and owned by a joint venture formed by ITT 
Sheraton, with 40% of the investment; Pan Am with 10%, and two Soviet 
organizations with the other 50% of the investment -- Mossoviet, Moscow's City 
Council, and Aeroflot, the Soviet airline. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first joint venture of this nature in the history of the relations 
between the United States and the Soviet Union," Soviet Ambassador Yuly V. 
Dubinin noted. "It is an outstanding example of how the East and the West can 
work together for their mutual benefit and progress."

COUPLE ADMITS PAYING COLLEGE BOYS TO HAVE SEX

A doctor and his wife pleaded guilty to prostitution and were fined $2,500 each 
for paying college students to have sex with the woman. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of an agreement between the prosecution and the defense, neither 
Rodney Thorp Wood nor Nancy Steffen Wood will serve time in prison, perform 
community service or be placed on probation. 
</P>
<P>
The couple sat together Monday holding hands and exchanging smiles as they 
waited in court. When Lane County Circuit Judge Mattison asked if they had 
anything to say, both said, "No, your honor." 
</P>
<P>
The Woods, saying they were conducting research into the "sexual potential of 
the mature female," paid male students at the University of Oregon $10 for each 
orgasm they or the 44-year-old woman experienced. Police said Wood, 60, 
recorded the encounters and took photographs. 
</P>
<P>
The Southampton, N.Y., couple were cited by police Sept. 16 at a Eugene hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they had evidence that the couple intended to carry on their 
"research" at other West Coast campuses. 
</P>
<P>
Wood was suspended as director of anesthesiology at Southampton Hospital on 
Long Island, N.Y., after the incident became public. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Richard Urrutia said that the Woods never received money in 
the encounters and that paying a token fee to scientific research subjects is 
customary. 
</P>
<P>
Urrutia declined to discuss the origin of the research project and said he did 
not know why the Woods traveled across the country to conduct it.

U.S. Ambassador Henry Grunwald confirmed today he has resigned from his post, 
saying it is for purely personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Grunwald said he told the U.S. government he will end his duties in January and 
return to private life in the United States. "I did so with regret and purely 
personal reasons," said Grunwald, former editor-in-chief of Time magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Grunwald, a Viennese-born Jew, fled Austria with his family after its 
annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
At Time he worked his way from copy boy to foreign editor and finally to top 
management. He was appointed by former President Ronald Reagan to succeed 
Ronald Lauder as ambassador to Austria in 1988.

<TEXT>
<P>
East Germany's Parliament elected Egon Krenz president today in a ritual made 
dramatic when some members voted "no" for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Krenz then issued a tough warning against street demonstrations, saying 
continued agitation could cause a "worsening of the situation, or 
confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 people marched in Leipzig on Monday in the largest protest in 
the nation's 40-year history, and more pro-democracy demonstrations are 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
Krenz reaffirmed East Germany's allegiance to Communist orthodoxy, despite the 
reform sweeping through the Soviet Bloc, but promised to investigate charges of 
brutality against pro-democracy demonstrators earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
The new leader, who succeeded Erich Honecker as Communist Party chief last 
week, was in charge of police at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Officials admitted for the first time today that police had attacked peaceful 
protesters. In a report carried by the state news agency ADN, the government 
said: "There were instances where security officials exceeded their authority 
and illegal acts were committed against some of those detained." 
</P>
<P>
ADN said police commanders had apologized to victims of verifiable brutality. 
ADN said 83 complaints are under review and prosecutors have taken up four 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
Krenz said in his speech that "proper steps will be taken if the evidence 
warrants them. Anyone who was treated unjustly has the right to take advantage 
of their legal rights." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six members of the 500-seat People's Chamber voted against Krenz for 
president, although he was the only candidate, and 26 abstained, ADN reported. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in East German history that members of the 
Communist-controlled chamber had voted against the sole candidate for head of 
state. 
</P>
<P>
After his election, the 52-year-old leader declared to the legislators: 
</P>
<P>
"Demonstrations, however peacefully they may be planned and thought out, carry 
within themselves the danger of ending in a different way from how they 
started. 
</P>
<P>
"That is unsettling to many people, and rightly so. Our society, which has so 
many new things to tackle, is thus put under increasing tension."

Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto is expecting a second child, probably 
early next year, sources close to her family said today. 
</P>
<P>
If still in office -- the opposition announced plans Monday night for a vote of 
no-confidence -- she apparently will be the first serving modern head of 
government to give birth. 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto, 36, gave birth to a son, Bilawal, on Sept. 21, 1988, eight weeks before 
the partial election victory that brought her to power. 
</P>
<P>
She was the first woman to become prime minister of a Muslim country and one of 
the youngest heads of government of a major nation. Right-wing Muslim clerics 
objected to her nomination, saying it was "un-Islamic" for a woman to govern.

U.S. TOO SLOW ABOUT AUTO SAFETY, BUSH NOMINEE SAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
The federal government has been too slow to decide on proposals for stronger 
automobile safety standards, President Bush's choice to head the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration said today. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry R. Curry, a retired Army major general and former deputy assistant 
defense secretary, said at his Senate confirmation hearing that he would set a 
goal of 18 months for the agency to approve or reject new safety regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"One area where I have been disappointed is in the length of time it takes to 
complete a rule-making action -- two years on the average from start to 
finish," Curry told the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and 
Transportation, which took no vote on his confirmation. In some cases it has 
taken years longer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Curry, who has been a consultant to the agency since March, said its career 
employees are doing their jobs well. He backed the Bush Administration's 
opposition to pending legislation that would set time limits for rule making on 
some transportation-safety issues. 
</P>
<P>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, charged with ensuring that 
vehicles meet minimum safety standards, drew bipartisan accusations of laxity 
during the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed to us in the past that oftentimes NHTSA has been most subservient to 
. . . ideological positions which seemed to say, 'Why should safety stand in 
the way of profit?' " Sen. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.) said. 
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Richard H. Bryan (D-Nev.) described the agency in recent 
years as "lethargic . . . and some would say derelict." 
</P>
<P>
Senators closely questioned Curry about whether he had any philosophical 
aversion to government intervention in the automobile industry to promote 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
"I bring nothing in the ideological nature to this job," Curry said. "To me, 
this job has a very narrow focus. That focus is saving lives." 
</P>
<P>
Curry promised if confirmed to push the agency to conclude by next summer its 
decade-long consideration of an improved side-impact standard for passenger 
cars. Senators cited the delay as the most flagrant example of what they called 
the agency's foot-dragging.

General Electric Co. said today it will eliminate the jobs of 1,100 salaried 
employees in its major appliance group in seven states due to weakening sales. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it hoped to cut most of the affected jobs by offering early 
retirement and transfers, but a spokesman said some layoffs may be required. 
</P>
<P>
Affected are salaried workers at the company's major appliance manufacturing 
plant in Louisville as well as facilities in Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, 
Maryland, Tennessee and Georgia, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
The latest job cuts mark the fourth major round this year in GE's appliance 
group, which has cited changing markets, increased foreign competition and 
sluggish sales trends.

A real estate firm that set a city record last year by selling a mansion for 
$4.1 million is trying to beat its own mark with an asking price of $5.9 
million for a villa along Millionaires' Row. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, the market is pretty good at the high end," Spencer Potter, a 
broker for the Boston-based firm LandVest, said today. 
</P>
<P>
The firm is trying to sell Fairholme, a Tudor-style villa next to railroad 
magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt's former summer "cottage," The Breakers. 
</P>
<P>
Fairholme was once owned by the sister of artist Georgia O'Keeffe, and former 
President John F. Kennedy visited occasionally to swim in the heated pool when 
his back gave him trouble, Potter said. The mansion is now owned by John and 
Chandler Maschek Jr. of Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, LandVest set a city record by selling Clarendon Court, which is 
where socialite Martha (Sunny)von Bulow slipped into a coma that her husband, 
Claus, was later acquitted of causing.

BILL ON AIRLINE TAKEOVERS MAY HIT BUSH VETO

The Bush Administration today threatened to veto legislation due on the House 
floor later in the week to give the Transportation Department the power to 
reject the leveraged buyouts of domestic airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The warning from the Transportation Department was issued during a House Ways 
and Means oversight subcommittee session examining the tax implications of the 
buyouts -- often financed with heavy debt that can be deductible. The panel got 
conflicting advice on the issue of restricting the interest deduction on such 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation under direct veto threat would require that those who want to 
buy an airline get the department's approval before buying more than 15% of an 
airline's stock. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Murphy Jr., a Transportation Department policy official, told the 
panel's oversight subcommittee that the department "neither needs nor wants 
such authority" to block takeovers and said Secretary Samuel Skinner has 
recommended a veto for the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.) has proposed legislation to restrict the interest 
deduction on buyouts to the first $100 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
"I fear that putting major airlines 'in play' in this game of speculation as 
practiced by the fast-buck artist will seriously damage airline companies that 
so many people rely on for their transportation needs," Dorgan told the 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Morten Beyer, head of Avmark, an air transportation consulting firm, told the 
subcommittee that the takeovers "have no redeeming economic or service 
advantages to the airlines, their employees and . . . the traveling public," 
and takeovers of five strong airlines would load them down with $30 billion in 
debt that "will transform them into the equivalent of a Third World country." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Hoffman, secretary-treasurer of the Independent Federation of Flight 
Attendants, endorsed Dorgan's bill.

International Business Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. unveiled new 
mainframe computers today aimed at boosting demand in the sluggish $45-billion 
market. 
</P>
<P>
The new products will boost competition in a market dominated by IBM. 
</P>
<P>
The improved products may also win back customers to the big-sized computers, 
which have been surrounded on shop floors and offices by increasingly powerful 
minicomputers. 
</P>
<P>
Digital, which has been IBM's peer in the minicomputer market, is making a bold 
move with its mainframe effort. 
</P>
<P>
Digital's 9000 computer will be its first entry into mainframe-class computing 
while IBM's addition to its 3090 series and related software is geared to 
defend its dominant 70% share of the market, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
IBM introduced 16 new ES/3090 models, 13 of which are immediately available, 
ranging in price from $830,000 for the 110J to $12.9 million for the 600J.

Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. today announced a 15.6% drop in its third-quarter 
profit, reflecting sharply lower income from its retailing and Allstate 
Insurance Co. operations. 
</P>
<P>
Allstate's earnings were hit hard by damage claims after Hurricane Hugo. The 
hurricane, which battered the southeastern U.S. coast, caused the largest 
single storm-damage loss in Allstate's history, Sears said. 
</P>
<P>
Sears reported net income of $257.5 million, or 75 cents a share, for the three 
months ended Sept. 30, contrasted with $305 million, or 80 cents a share, in 
the same period a year earlier.

A Kentucky lottery betting game on professional football was discarded before 
it began when Gov. Wallace Wilkinson declared it "a bad idea" in the face of 
opposition from the horse racing industry. 
</P>
<P>
The SuperSports game was scheduled to begin last week, but a flurry of court 
activity on a lawsuit filed by horse racing groups delayed its kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Kentucky Supreme Court lifted an injunction that delayed the 
game, which involves pari-mutuel betting on National Football League games. 
</P>
<P>
Several hours later, Wilkinson announced he wanted the game discarded. 
</P>
<P>
"The lottery, I think, is being harmed by the controversy surrounding the 
SuperSports game," Wilkinson told reporters. "The fun of the on-line (lottery) 
game has all been lost in the media attention given the SuperSports game." 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky voters approved a state lottery earlier this year in a referendum. 
Oregon was the first state to introduce a lottery game based on NFL betting, 
but no court action was filed there and the game is under way. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky Lottery Corp. President Frank Keener and board Chairman William 
Sullivan said in a joint statement that they disagree with Wilkinson's decision 
but would comply and discard the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Kentucky Thoroughbred Assn., Kentucky Harness Horsemen's Assn. and the 
Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Assn. contended that the NFL game would 
steal patrons from Kentucky race tracks, the only places where pari-mutuel 
betting is legal in the state. 
</P>
<P>
The horse racing industry groups also said pari-mutuel betting on NFL games was 
not envisioned by voters who approved the state lottery, or by the Legislature, 
which approved legislation to set up the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
"Listening to people across this commonwealth, I think they are telling me this 
is a bad idea," said Wilkinson, who previously had told lottery officials he 
would support the SuperSports game.

Pat Durham, Colorado State's all-time leading scorer and rebounder, is to leave 
for Spain on Wednesday to play basketball for Seville. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the contract signed Sunday were not disclosed, but Durham is believed 
assured of more than the NBA minimum of $110,000, plus the use of a condominium 
and a car. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-8 Durham, who averaged 19 points and 7.8 rebounds a game last season 
to lead Colorado State to its first Western Athletic Conference championship 
and an NCAA Tournament berth, was drafted in the second round last June by the 
Dallas Mavericks, the 35th pick overall.

Former Raider John Matuszak, who died of a drug overdose, bequeathed his Super 
Bowl rings to nephews and the majority of his estimated $450,000 estate to his 
mother and three sisters. 
</P>
<P>
The former All-Pro defensive end known for his on-the-field aggression and 
off-the-field flamboyance named his mother, Audrey Matuszak, as his executor in 
the will formally filed in Superior Court on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In the will signed July 13, 1984, the standout player known to football fans by 
his nickname "The Tooz," left his championship ring from Super Bowl XI to a 
nephew, Justin Evancy, and his ring from Super Bowl XV to another nephew, Luke 
Evancy. 
</P>
<P>
Matuszak bequeathed the contents of his house in Franklin, Wis., to his sister, 
Christine Evancy. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of his estate, $230,000 in personal property, $217,000 in real 
property and $10,000 in income from that property, was left to his mother and 
his sisters, Karen and Dawn Matuszak. 
</P>
<P>
Matuszak, 38, died in June at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Burbank. The 
county coroner's office determined that his death resulted from an accidental 
overdose of a narcotic pain killer, aggravated by an enlarged heart and 
pneumonia.

Rockets center Akeem Olajuwon may not be ready to play at full speed in the 
regular season opener Nov. 3, Rockets Coach Don Chaney says. 
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon has been restricted to conditioning drills because of a blood clot in 
his leg. He cannot participate in contact drills until he stops taking blood 
thinners. 
</P>
<P>
"If he comes back two days before the season opener, I'm going to treat him as 
an injured player who's coming back," Chaney said Monday. "If they take him off 
the medication the night before we play, I might not start him. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be unfair to put him out there 30 or 40 minutes in the first few 
games if he hasn't been able to practice fully for a week before the season 
starts." 
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon was hospitalized for a week in July when the blood clot was discovered 
in his left calf. Doctors say his recovery is progressing on schedule. "We plan 
to take him off medication next week," Dr. David Rothschild said.
