AL MARTINEZ: KISS THE CILANTRO FOR ME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There are thousands of restaurants in L.A., including a few five-stars and an 
abundance of others whose collations require ketchup poured over them before 
the food is considered edible. Even the custard pudding needs help. 
</P>
<P>
I eat mostly at little Italian places on the corner, where a nameless red house 
wine is served in chipped glasses and one suspects the pasta may have been an 
uneaten portion off someone else's plate. 
</P>
<P>
I got used to chowing down like that in Oakland, where a food establishment is 
considered gourmet if nothing on the plate moves. Members of the Oakland A's 
still dine at such eateries, which results in a pathological condition that 
obviously impedes athletic performance. 
</P>
<P>
I mention this to stress that my background does not include the kind of 
training that would prepare me to write about food. I either like what I eat or 
I don't, whether it is foie de veau prepared by Wolfgang Puck or chili over 
eggs by Mama Consuela. 
</P>
<P>
Which is why I was somewhat surprised to receive a letter from Carlos Haro, 
owner of Venice's Casablanca restaurant, that began, "Dear Mr. Martinez. As a 
food and dining expert, you. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
It was an invitation to judge a new gourmet dish Carlos had created. Since I 
had never been asked to discuss anything I ate, I said to my wife, "I smell a 
column." She said, "Poor Carlos." 
</P>
<P>
It was a new experience. We found ourselves among people who could actually 
tell the difference between a clam and an oyster. There were restaurant critics 
not only from L.A., but from Mexico and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
They nibbled at their food and then smacked their lips ever so slightly, as 
though throwing baby kisses to the air. Then they'd look off to the middle 
distance, savoring the subtle tones of tangy sauces. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't that beautiful?" I said to Cinelli, watching them baby-kiss, then either 
nod in approval or make those squinty little faces food experts make when they 
aren't sure. "They're such cute little buggers." 
</P>
<P>
"You've learned something new," Cinelli said. "Now you can baby-kiss after your 
Big Macs." 
</P>
<P>
Carlos' new creation was something called an enchiLaCa. It's meant as kind of a 
hip Mexican joke, see, like the "La" stands for L.A. and the "Ca" means 
California. Hence, enchiLaCa. 
</P>
<P>
It's called that, Carlos explained, because L.A. people like to try new things, 
and also some enchiLaCas are filled with vegetables, which L.A. people like 
very much. 
</P>
<P>
At least that's what I think he said. Carlos has been up from Mexico only a few 
years, and doesn't speak good English. 
</P>
<P>
And since I don't speak Spanish at all, there was something of a communication 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, it took five minutes for us to work out that "angreliants" meant 
ingredients, as in they are composed of very selected angreliants. 
</P>
<P>
It took even longer to learn one of the enchiLaCas was filled with chayote. It 
is a tropical vine off of which grows a grotesque squash-like thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Is good," Carlos explained, "but skin is look ugly." 
</P>
<P>
"If you didn't drink martinis," Cinelli whispered, "you'd know what he's 
saying. Look at the food experts, they're only sipping a little champagne. It 
keeps their taste buds happy, but sober." 
</P>
<P>
Casablanca's decor is fashioned after Rick's Place in The Famous Movie of the 
same name, although its specialty is Mexican food with angreliants. A star of 
the evening was 75-year-old Dan Seymour, one of the last of the actors who was 
in "Casablanca." 
</P>
<P>
Dan is a big-bellied man who played the Arab guard at Rick's. He tells terrific 
stories about Bogart and the others, some of which last longer than the movie 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
One of the stories was about Ingrid Bergman riding a camel, or maybe it was a 
giraffe. Dan began telling the story during the soup and was still telling it 
when the food critics were baby-kissing the dessert. 
</P>
<P>
We were at the same table with David Westheimer, an owlish little Texan who 
wrote "Von Ryan's Express" and "My Sweet Charlie," among other best sellers. 
</P>
<P>
I guess he's something of a gourmet, which is why he was invited. He said the 
food was terrific, they didn't have things like that in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
You can bet your royalties on that. I've been to Houston and know for a fact 
that many of their chefs were trained in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
The food experts gave the enchiLaCas high marks. You could hear their taste 
buds singing vivacissimo in three languages as they left. 
</P>
<P>
I said to Cinelli as she drove us home, "I really liked that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
"Good," she said, "that will no doubt appear in subsequent ads. 'I really liked 
that stuff' -- Al Martinez, Gourmet-in-Training.' It's a shame you don't 
baby-kiss." 
</P>
<P>
I'm working on it.

Coming soon: The Umbrellas of Tejon. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,700 yellow umbrellas, each 20 feet tall and weighing 485 pounds, 
standing along Interstate 5 near Gorman. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Christo's at it again. 
</P>
<P>
The Belgian-born artist, whose previous pieces include a 24-mile fabric fence 
in California and pink fabric rings around 11 Florida islands, dropped in at 
USC the other night to talk about his latest creation. Simultaneous to the 
October, 1991, opening of the 18-mile line of umbrellas in Tejon, Christo also 
plans to unveil 1,300 umbrellas in a rice field in Ibaraki, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, he needs a bit of help. He's looking for 1,500 volunteers to 
participate in the 2 1/2-hour opening in Tejon. 
</P>
<P>
Christo told his USC audience that the project is "monumental only because it's 
irrational and totally irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
Perfect for Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of USC, college authorities everywhere are trying to keep students off 
drugs. Now comes a new habit-forming peril. Cast members of the soap opera, 
"The Young &amp; the Restless," will visit the Trojan campus today, seeking new 
viewers for their show. They'll offer free autographed photos and calendars. 
They'll invite students to perform a scene from the show and videotape them. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, young people: Just say no! 
</P>

"Single? Call Fax-A-Date," said the ad in L.A.'s Downtown News. 
</P>
<P>
We were confused, wondering whether fax machines had become so sophisticated 
that they could deliver human beings in the flesh. Alas, a call by us to 
Fax-A-Date -- for journalistic reasons, mind you -- produced nothing but a 
recording saying that "voice mail (or was it male?) service" was no longer 
available at that number. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Fax-A-Date has gone into Fax-A-Therapy.

The adventures of Humphrey in San Francisco Bay and the unnamed megamouth off 
Dana Point caused writer/photographer Bill Murphy to recall a whale story of 
his own. 
</P>
<P>
"Years ago, I ran into the general manager of (now defunct) Marineland at Palm 
Springs," Murphy said. "He was nervous as hell because he'd gotten a call that 
Bubbles the whale was very sick. Bubbles was their star attraction. People were 
afraid the animal might die. Then the GM got a phone call. Afterward he said, 
'Well, everything came out OK.' I asked him what he meant. He said: 
</P>
<P>
"Bubbles burped -- and he burped up an inner tube."

The last demographic census of Marina del Rey, reported in the "L.A. Book of

more than 8,000 people, 47 of whom were children.

GULF CRISIS EXPOSED U.S. DEPLOYMENT FLAWS, OFFICIAL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Persian Gulf crisis has exposed this nation's shortcomings in quickly 
deploying a sizable military sea lift without the considerable assistance of 
other nations, the head of the U.S. Maritime Administration said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Capt. Warren G. Leback warned that without the unprecedented 
commitment of foreign-flagged ships, it would have taken until now for the 
United States to muster enough cargo vessels to adequately supply the 250,000 
troops massing in the Middle East. And even now, he said, the U.S. sea lift 
would face a struggle supplying the troops if a conflict erupts. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as we don't start shooting, everything's fine," Leback told a Long 
Beach luncheon crowd. "But to go to the next step, we're short. There's no 
question." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Leback added that the lessons of the Middle East deployment, 
Operation Desert Shield, will certainly include a reassessment of the nation's 
military sea lift capability and the need for committing as much as $1 billion 
over the next four to five years for maintaining and testing a reserve fleet of 
cargo ships. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was not a global effort, we're not sure we would have had the 
availability of the vessels" needed for Operation Desert Shield, Leback said 
after his appearance before the local chapter of the Propeller Club of the 
United States, a nonprofit maritime association. 
</P>
<P>
Leback's remarks follow weeks of attention by Congress and the Bush 
Administration to the nation's sea lift capabilities and particularly the 
Maritime Administration's Ready Reserve Force. The 96-ship force was 
established in 1976 to support military operations and consists of retired 
commercial vessels maintained by the Transportation Department, which oversees 
the Maritime Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Since the crisis began there has been criticism of the reliance on 
foreign-flagged ships to support U.S. troops and of delays -- some as long as 
20 days -- in deploying the 45 Ready Reserve Force vessels that are taking 
supplies to the Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
Though Administration and Pentagon officials have emphasized the size of 
Operation Desert Shield, they have also acknowledged, as Leback did Thursday, 
that years of federal neglect of the nation's maritime readiness must end if 
the United States is to sufficiently support its military in a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Leback said, the Persian Gulf crisis demonstrated that the 
nation's Ready Reserve Force fleet did not meet its established goal of 
dispatching the vessels in as little as five days in a military deployment. 
Previously, officials reported that only 14 of the ships activated in Operation 
Desert Shield reached their ports for loading on schedule, with the remaining 
ships arriving one to 20 days late. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Leback pointed out the U.S. sea lift to the Persian Gulf relied 
heavily on foreign-flagged vessels whose support cannot be assured in the 
future. Had those 70 or so foreign vessels not been available, Leback said, the 
United States might have been forced not only to call up its remaining 51 Ready 
Reserve Force ships, with delays of up to 30 days, but other, older ships in 
the so-called National Defense Reserve Fleet, whose deployment could have taken 
two to four months. (Some of the National Defense Reserve Fleet vessels have 
been mothballed for 10 years.) 
</P>
<P>
And that scenario, Leback said, would have left the United States unable to 
swiftly provide the hundreds of thousands of tons of military equipment and 
cargo needed to support the nation's troops in Saudi Arabia. "We wouldn't have 
been able to put the armor and equipment needed to match the troop lift in 
order to deter the Iraqis," Leback said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the problems with the Ready Reserve Force became apparent, Leback and 
other Administration officials have emphasized the great demands on sea lift in 
the past three months. The operation has required, for example, the delivery of 
50% more equipment and supplies in the first month of operation than during the 
first month of the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, officials have acknowledged there can be no excuses for slow 
deployment in a military crisis. And that, Leback said Thursday, will be the 
argument for immediately increasing funds to the reserve fleet, whose budget 
was cut last year from $171 million to $89 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make sense in one year when we are in an emergency situation, or 
whatever you want to call it, to get all kinds of money," Leback said. "We need 
to put the ready back into the ready reserve."

RAPISTS GET 5-YEAR TERMS FOR ATTACK ON FRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Two former Marymount College basketball players, convicted of raping a fellow 
student from the small Rancho Palos Verdes campus, were sentenced Wednesday to 
five years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Bryon Flournoy, 23, and Warren Cox, 20, bowed their heads silently as Long 
Beach Superior Court Judge Michael G. Nott sentenced them to the minimum term 
allowed by state law. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the more than a dozen friends and relatives who appeared in court to 
show support for the men quietly wiped away tears as the pair were placed in 
custody. The men had remained free on $50,000 bail after their jury conviction 
last month on four counts of rape in concert. 
</P>
<P>
Nott, who called the case "one of the most difficult I've had to decide," said 
he has agonized over how to handle the sentencing, because of the particular 
circumstances of the crime and the clean records of the men. 
</P>
<P>
"I've spent every night since this case was decided trying to figure out what 
to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nott recommended that the state Department of Corrections place Flournoy and 
Cox in a fire camp facility or some other non-traditional prison setting. 
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old victim testified during the trial that she had been visiting 
Flournoy, Cox and three other acquaintances at the men's San Pedro apartment 
for several hours before the Feb. 23 rape. 
</P>
<P>
The entire group had been drinking large amounts of beer, she testified, and 
eventually she ended up in a playful wrestling match with Flournoy and Cox in 
the apartment's bedroom. She testified that during the game the men suddenly 
pinned her to the floor, removed her clothes and raped her repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
According to a probation report, the woman has required extensive psychiatric 
counseling because of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Flournoy and Cox, however, testified that the woman voluntarily had sex with 
them and did not become upset until after another person walked into the room, 
catching them in the act. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kenneth Lamb urged Nott to sentence the men, who faced as 
much as 36 years in prison, to at least 16 years for the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"When a stranger violates your life, you're terrified and abused," Lamb said. 
"But when a friend violates your trust, that causes more than that nightmare. 
They take away your ability to trust, your ability to have faith in a friend." 
</P>
<P>
Although state law does not allow a judge to grant probation in cases involving 
rape in concert, defense attorneys for both men argued that Nott should grant 
probation anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Both argued that the mandatory minimum sentence of five years is 
unconstitutional because it represents a cruel and unusual punishment for this 
particular crime. 
</P>
<P>
"My problem with the sentencing scheme in these cases is it doesn't take into 
consideration any of the factors or circumstances," attorney Stephen Peacock 
argued to the court. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a situation where the victim invited the whole group, five males and 
herself, to Palm Springs for the weekend, she bought a case and a half of beer 
for them, she danced in front of them, she initiated a wrestling match," 
according to Peacock, who represents Cox. "Of course, nothing that a woman does 
is going to justify a rape . . . but young people make mistakes in judgment 
when they're under the influence of alcohol, and I think that's what happened 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys said they plan to appeal the convictions. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Flournoy, who has been living with his parents in Bakersfield for the 
last five months, nor Cox, a native of the Bahamas who is in the United States 
on a student visa, had a criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen relatives and friends sent the judge letters of recommendation for 
the men, whom they described as dedicated students and outstanding athletes 
incapable of violence. 
</P>
<P>
"I strongly fear for them if they're sent to prison," wrote Belle Levinson, an 
associate English professor at the college. "The detrimental effect of 
incarceration on such gentle and impressive young men will indeed be severe."

WIFE ONLY A FOLLOWER IN DISAPPEARANCE, WITNESS SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Santa Monica teacher, charged with helping her husband steal a motor 
home and $120,000 from a Glendale accountant who mysteriously disappeared, is a 
timid woman with low self-esteem who did not question the actions of her 
husband, a psychologist said Wednesday during the final day of testimony in the 
couple's trial. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Vicki Fine, 38, and Stanley Alan Hershey, 46, are on trial in U.S. District 
Court in Las Vegas on 18 counts of conspiracy, transportation of stolen 
vehicles across state lines and illegal use of automated banking cards. 
</P>
<P>
The vehicles and money belonged to Gordon T. Johnson, 62, who sold his Glendale 
house after he retired last year, bought a $219,000 motor home and a 
four-wheel-drive Suzuki and took up a life of travel with his dog. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson and the dog have not been seen or heard from since he telephoned 
relatives Oct. 15, 1989, after leaving Bend, Ore. Authorities suspect that 
Johnson was killed on Oct. 15 or Oct. 16 and that his body may have been dumped 
in Lake Shasta in Northern California. No murder charges have been filed 
because murder is not a federal offense. But local authorities are still 
conducting a murder investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Fine and Hershey were arrested by the FBI March 1 in Las Vegas, where they were 
found with Johnson's Suzuki and banking cards. They had left the motor home at 
a recreation park in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Fine testified that her husband told her that Johnson gave them the vehicles 
and money for spiritual reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Hershey's only defense by his court-appointed attorney was that the government 
has no proof that Hershey and Fine did not have permission from Johnson to use 
his credit cards, checking account or his motor home and the Suzuki. He did not 
testify and no witnesses appeared in his defense. 
</P>
<P>
But Fine's attorney attempted during the six-day trial to separate her client 
from Hershey. Federal Public Defender Franny Forsman portrayed Fine, who is due 
to give birth to her first child Nov. 8, as emotionally insecure and 
subservient to the demands of others. 
</P>
<P>
Fine testified that she and her husband, both teachers with master's degrees, 
practiced "channeling," in which they relied on spirits to guide their destiny. 
She said she believed her husband had a special connection with a spirit guide. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to trust what Stan said to me," she told a jury. "He had no reason to 
lie to me. Our association with Gordon was spiritually directed. We didn't do 
anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Fine said in court on Tuesday that she was ill the day Johnson disappeared but 
admitted that she and her spouse had spent time with the man at Lake Shasta. 
</P>
<P>
Fine said she, her husband and Johnson stayed at the lake -- the couple in 
their motor home and Johnson in his -- but that she last saw Johnson on Oct. 14 
when they had dinner together. She said she stayed inside her camper on Oct. 
15. Johnson and his motor home were gone by Oct. 16, when Fine and Hershey went 
boating on the lake, Fine testified.

TORRANCE AMENDS REDEVELOPMENT PLAN DESPITE COUNTY'S OBJECTIONS 
</P>

Despite objections from Los Angeles County, Torrance officials decided Tuesday 
to double the spending limit for the city's industrial redevelopment project 
from $90 million to $180 million and to extend the project timetable 20 years, 
to the year 2033. 
</P>
<P>
A deputy county counsel said Wednesday the county may mount a legal challenge 
to the city's actions. In response, Torrance City Manager LeRoy Jackson said 
the city will continue to negotiate with the county to reach a compromise in 
the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not out to cause problems with the county," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
When the Torrance project was first conceived in 1983, the county agreed to 
limit its share of property taxes from the project area to 20% through the year 
2013. The county receives 57% from most areas not covered by a redevelopment 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have objected to the Torrance change because it would limit 
the county's share of tax revenues from the area for an additional 20 years. 
They want to return to the 57% rate now. 
</P>
<P>
The 1983 Torrance industrial redevelopment plan is aimed at improving 292 acres 
on the city's west side by clearing out old buildings to make room for new 
offices and industries. 
</P>
<P>
But the city underestimated the cost of the project, which officials blame on a 
variety of factors, including increased land values and costly cleanup of 
pollution left by departed industries. 
</P>
<P>
So city officials decided to raise the spending limit and add 20 more years to 
the project. That would allow time to remove some toxic waste, repave streets 
and install utility lines, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance City Council and the city Redevelopment Agency adopted the amended 
plan Tuesday night. The council approved the plan in the form of an ordinance 
on a 5-0 vote with Councilmen Dan Walker and George Nakano abstaining. Earlier, 
the council members, sitting as the Redevelopment Agency, had approved the plan 
5 to 0. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County officials have said that if the plan is changed, the county 
should receive 57% of the property taxes generated by the project. 
</P>
<P>
City and county representatives are still negotiating the tax-sharing 
arrangement, said Diane Shamhart, assistant division chief in the Los Angeles 
County chief administrative office. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the county is holding firm on its 57% request, Shamhart said: "It's 
what we would like to see, but it's all a matter of negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
The county has maintained that the city should conduct an environmental review 
of the project before changing it. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city Environmental Board concluded a review is not needed, the 
county appealed that decision Oct. 3 in a letter that calls the original 1983 
environmental review "stale." On Tuesday, the City Council and Redevelopment 
Agency rejected that appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel A. Valenzuela, deputy county counsel, said Wednesday that the county 
still believes a review is needed. The county has 30 days to file papers in 
Superior Court, asking the city to conduct a review, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the county has 60 days to contest the city's adoption of the 
amended redevelopment plan, he said.

PILOT BELIEVED TO BE LOST IS JUST VISITING ARIZONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 68-year-old Granada Hills pilot, whose disappearance from Whiteman Airport 
Monday touched off a massive Civil Air Patrol search, was located safe in 
Arizona, Los Angeles police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Robert Bell had apparently flown to Phoenix to visit friends for a 
few days without telling his wife and family. He did not realize that 14 planes 
were searching for him in California until he called Deer Valley Airport near 
Phoenix, Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
"He called in for a weather report and he was advised of the concern back 
here," said Detective Jim Lewis of the Los Angeles Police Department's missing 
persons unit. "It looks like it was a miscommunication with the family. He is 
alive and well. He contacted his family and said 'I thought I told you' and 
they said, 'No, you didn't.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bell, a retired carpenter, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Bell drove to Whiteman on Monday after telling family members he 
was going to look at a plane. When he failed to return home, police were called 
and discovered his plane, a single-engine Grumman, was missing. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believed that Bell might have taken off on an impromptu pleasure 
ride over the Mojave Desert, as he had done on previous occasions. The Civil 
Air Patrol was notified and on Tuesday 14 planes combed 740 square miles of the 
desert in search of Bell. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a massive search," Lewis said. "A lot of these people are civilians. 
They stop whatever they are doing and start looking. It kind of grinds on you" 
that the search was launched because of a miscommunication," he said. "But we 
are happy there was no crash." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said the Civil Air Patrol notified Deer Valley Airport to watch for Bell 
because he had flown there previously to visit friends. The missing pilot's 
plane was seen at the airport late Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Ellie Brekke, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration, said Bell 
was not required to file a flight plan and the agency would not investigate the 
matter.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WATER RATES TO RISE 12% IN NOVEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Palmdale Water District has approved its first rate increase in nearly two 
years, with most of the district's 17,000 customers expected to pay about 12% 
more for water starting in November. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member board of directors of the public water district, which serves 
the east side of Palmdale and surrounding unincorporated areas, adopted the 
increase Tuesday night in an attempt to cover a forecast deficit of about 
$800,000 for the current calendar year. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of increase varies by type of user. But district officials said a 
typical residential customer now paying about $31 a month to use about 30,000 
gallons would now pay about $35 a month. The district last increased rates in 
February, 1989.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: INTERIM BUILDING STANDARDS EXPIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Lawndale's interim development standards for apartments expired 
Monday, resurrecting a set of old standards that council members and others 
have long complained are too lenient. 
</P>
<P>
The interim standards were first imposed under an emergency ordinance last 
October and then extended for 10 1/2 months to give city officials a chance to 
develop permanent building guidelines for the construction of apartments. 
</P>
<P>
But John Chapman, Lawndale planning director, said his department has been too 
understaffed to develop a set of permanent guidelines, and he recommended that 
the council extend the interim standards another year. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 2 to 1 Monday to extend the interim standards, with 
Councilmen Larry Rudolph and William Johnson voting in favor and Councilwoman 
Carol Norman dissenting. Mayor Harold E. Hofmann was ill. A fifth council seat 
is vacant. 
</P>
<P>
But because state law requires a four-fifths vote by the council to extend an 
emergency ordinance of this type, the council's decision is invalid, Assistant 
City Atty. Bob Owen said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the interim apartment standards, developers were required to build larger 
parking spaces and more guest parking spots and to incorporate more open space 
into their projects. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a few apartment projects that were already pending when the interim 
development standards were imposed, no new apartment buildings have been built 
in the last year, Chapman said.

FOR STATE CONTROLLER: DAVIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the race for state controller, incumbent Democrat Gray Davis is under 
challenge from Republican newcomer Matthew Fong. 
</P>
<P>
The big difference between the two candidates who want to be California's chief 
fiscal officer is experience. Davis is better qualified to serve as watchdog 
over the state's $55.7-billion annual budget. We endorse Davis for this 
important post. 
</P>
<P>
During his four-year term, Davis has shown some creativity in fiscal matters, a 
doggedness in the job and a streak of independence. Davis, 47, is a 16-year 
veteran of state government. Prior to his election as controller, he served as 
chief of staff to Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. and later as a two-term assemblyman. 
As controller, he serves on 52 boards and commissions, including the State 
Lands Commission and Franchise Tax Board. 
</P>
<P>
He helped establish the 37,500-acre Dye Creek Wildlife Reserve in Northern 
California through an innovative debt-for-nature swap. He has aggressively 
pursued the state's suit against the federal government to recover California's 
share of millions of dollars in royalties from Kern County's Elk Hills Naval 
Petroleum Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
And in an act that raised a lot of eyebrows, Davis released millions of dollars 
to California schools in August against Gov. George Deukmejian's attempt to 
impound the money because of a political spat with state Supt. of Public 
Instruction Bill Honig. 
</P>
<P>
Fong's bid for controller is his first statewide and public office race. 
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old Los Angeles attorney specializes in Pacific Rim trade and 
business. He once served as campaign manager for his Democrat mother, Secretary 
of State March Fong Eu. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Fong switched parties. He has challenged Davis' squeaky-clean 
and straight-arrow image by questioning the incumbent's judgment on accepting 
certain political contributions and using state personnel and equipment for 
political purposes in 1986. (Davis reimbursed the state $28,000.) 
</P>
<P>
These are valid political points -- fair questions to raise in the heat of a 
political campaign. But Fong offers insufficient alternatives to the policies 
and programs of Davis.

GREEN LIGHT IS GIVEN TO MOTORCYCLE SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hermosa Beach's acrimonious debate over whether to open its doors to motorcycle 
shops sputtered to an end this week as the City Council quietly amended the 
zoning ordinance to allow the sale of motorcycles and motorcycle parts on the 
Pacific Coast Highway commercial strip. 
</P>
<P>
The unanimous vote was an anticlimactic finish to a controversy that began this 
summer, when the owners of an auto parts store at 640 Pacific Coast Highway 
asked the city to change their conditional-use permit so they could sell and 
repair Harley-Davidson motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
The plan set off a protest by the neighbors of the shop, South Bay Cycles, who 
feared they would be plagued day and night with the roar of revving engines. 
</P>
<P>
The zoning ordinance allowed motorcycle repairs in the area, along with the 
sale of automobiles and auto parts and supplies. But motorcycle sales were not 
mentioned, and the Planning Commission used that ambiguity as grounds to deny 
South Bay Cycles the permit it sought. 
</P>
<P>
After an emotional, hourlong public hearing last month, the City Council 
partially overrode the Planning Commission and gave South Bay Cycles a 
six-month permit to repair motorcycles. The owners were told to postpone 
selling the cycles until after the council clarified the zoning ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
But the fierce debate that had colored last month's hearing was absent at the 
council meeting Tuesday. Neither the owners nor the neighbors addressed the 
council. Members speculated afterward that the debate may have died down 
because the bulk of the noise from such enterprises is generated by motorcycle 
repair, which was dealt with at the earlier meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Campbell, a co-owner of South Bay Cycles, said the clarification now 
opens the way for the owners to seek permission to begin selling 
Harley-Davidsons. 
</P>
<P>
"We're happy," she said. "We just wish the whole process could have been taken 
care of all at once."

FOREIGN TAKEOVER?

<P>
It's finally possible to start compiling a list of those things and places that 
Americans treasure. Office buildings -- even venerable digs like Rockefeller 
Center and its skating rink -- don't make it. 
</P>
<P>
Neither do golf courses like Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But at the very top of the treasure list is Yosemite National Park, high in the 
Sierra Nevadas, whose tall trees and rugged slopes were spared by John Muir, 
California's pioneer environmentalist. 
</P>
<P>
This tidbit of cultural anthropology has emerged as a sidelight to the 
negotiations on a possible takeover of MCA Inc. by Japan's Matsushita Electric 
Industrial Co. 
</P>
<P>
Among MCA's global holdings is the Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co., which has the 
hotel and restaurant concession in Yosemite. And according to the National Park 
Service, the idea that a Japanese company might wind up running things at the 
park has provoked a deluge of angry mail from Americans. 
</P>
<P>
We suspect public reaction would be negative to the "sale" of a place like 
Yosemite to any foreign interest, but certainly the fact that a Japanese 
company is involved feeds the anxiety some Americans feel. Imagine the Japanese 
reaction if an American fast-food company were to announce plans to put a 
hamburger or pizza parlor at the base of Mt. Fuji. That probably wouldn't go 
over too well, either. 
</P>
<P>
But there are some indications that Matsushita is sensitive to national 
treasures and would not be interested in the Yosemite concession. Storms pass 
swiftly in Yosemite. This one probably will be no different.

WILSON, FEINSTEIN ON TERM LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How ironic that Dianne Feinstein continually voices her opposition to 
Proposition 140, which would limit political terms to two, on the grounds that 
political lobbyists will then be running the government. Yet, since the courts 
overturned Proposition 73, Feinstein has taken more than $750,000 from 
political lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
Since the court ruling she has accepted more than $300,000 from labor unions 
alone. She has also accepted more than $100,000 from five of her husband's 
friends and business associates (Oct. 10). Feinstein claims that she must take 
these large sums of money to counter Wilson's excessive war chest. While Pete 
Wilson could indulge in the same fund-raising tactics, he has stood by 
Proposition 73's restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Will these large donations affect Feinstein's political decisions if she is 
elected governor? That is the risk the voters will have to contemplate when 
casting their vote on Nov. 6. By following the restrictions imposed by both 
Propositions 73 and 140, candidates will be more inclined to vote for the 
public interest rather than for their major contributors' interests.

Wilson set priorities and cut property taxes. Meanwhile, Feinstein never set a 
long-term agenda, was reactive and raised taxes ("A Tale of Two Cities May 
Decide Governor's Race," Part A, Oct. 14). 
</P>
<P>
Yet the sewer system says it all. Feinstein had more foresight than Wilson. 
"Now San Diego is faced with a $2.8 billion tab for a new plant," with no help 
from the feds; but it could have been done for $500 million, largely with 
federal money, if Wilson hadn't thought that cutting taxes was an end unto 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson is like the CEO of a company who focuses on this quarter's results and 
doesn't worry about the long-term consequences of his shortsighted decisions.

IMMIGRATION BILL POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The column by Stephen Moore (Commentary, Sept. 28) and the editorial point up 
the economic possibilities, both positive and negative, of the the family unity 
bill. But we also need to address a number of provisions that can facilitate 
the reunification of immigrant families in an orderly and controlled manner. 
</P>
<P>
As an organization that has seen firsthand the frustration of U.S. families who 
for years have been separated, we strongly encouraged support of the family 
provisions of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
We note particularly that this act creates a special category 115,000 visas 
aimed at the reunion of permanent residents with their spouses and minor 
children. At present, newly legalized persons might have to wait up to 20 or 30 
years to live with their spouses and children. 
</P>
<P>
A further provision would provide 50,000 visas to ease some of the most 
unreasonable backlogs. Moreover, the bill would protect the spouses and 
children of legalized residents from deportation and would grant them work 
authorization. 
</P>
<P>
Family immigration has been and must remain the cornerstone of the American 
immigration system.

ELECTIONS 26TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
BERMAN'S GOP RIVAL RUNS ON MEAGER FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Incumbent Democrat Howard L. Berman of Panorama City, who is seeking a fifth 
term in the 26th Congressional District, faces an under-funded campaign 
challenge from Republican businessman Roy Dahlson of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Like his colleague Henry A. Waxman in the neighboring 24th District, Berman is 
regarded as a heavyweight in the House and in California politics. 
</P>
<P>
Before his election to Congress in 1982, he served 10 years in the state 
Assembly, where he lost a bitter fight for the speakership. 
</P>
<P>
In the House, Berman is a member of the Budget, Foreign Affairs and Judiciary 
committees, and is particularly influential on immigration matters. 
</P>
<P>
He also has been a leader in the effort to restore Hansen Dam in Lake View 
Terrace to being a regional recreation area that will include a lake, and has 
sponsored successful legislation to partially fund the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Berman had $285,040 on hand in May. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlson, a wholesale florist, reported campaign funds of just $513. He said his 
campaign is based generally on a conservative Republican philosophy of "peace 
through strength." He said he is opposed to tax increases of any kind and 
supportive of cutting government spending and waste. 
</P>
<P>
Berman is a leading advocate of a woman's right to choose an abortion, but 
Dahlson said he opposes abortion in most circumstances, though he stops short 
of advocating a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Libertarian Bernard Zimring of Van Nuys also is on the ballot. He opposes any 
tax increases and said he considers the income tax to be unconstitutional and 
an invasion of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
The district is heavily Democratic and, in 1988, Berman easily defeated his 
Republican challenger, G.C. Broderson, 70% to 29%.

IDEAS DRIVE POLITICS, AND BUSH HAS NONE; 
</P>
<P>
DEMOCRATS HAVE JERKED HIM ABOUT BECAUSE HE SIGNALED FLEXIBILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
President Bush's inept budget dealings will cost him dearly. He has lost 
credibility; the word will be given a workout in the weeks ahead. His feckless 
repudiation of his own positions, staked out only days earlier, will no doubt 
be assembled into a devastating videotape, to be cherished and circulated by 
the Democratic National Committee. Bush may nonetheless be consoling himself 
with the thought that he will at least come away with his five-year, 
$500-billion deficit reduction, if at high political cost. 
</P>
<P>
I'm told that earlier this year Budget Director Richard G. Darman reassured the 
President that if the deficit-reduction package became law, he would not have 
to worry his head about mundane fiscal matters for the remainder of his first 
term. Things are not likely to work out so easily. 
</P>
<P>
In his unsuccessful televised appeal earlier this month, President Bush 
remarked that "it's the toughest deficit reduction package ever," with "the 
largest spending savings ever -- more than $300 billion." For the first time, 
he boasted, Democratic leaders of Congress had agreed to "real cuts," with "no 
smoke, no mirrors, no magic act." 
</P>
<P>
Budget numbers are tedious, but I beg the reader's indulgence. To a surprising 
degree, the following figures have been overlooked in all the budget 
maneuvering. Notice the awkward phrase used by the President: "Spending 
savings." That suggests smoke and mirrors right there. 
</P>
<P>
In fiscal 1990, the year that ended on Sept. 30, total government spending was 
$1.26 billion. In the year just beginning, including the famed deficit 
reduction, projected government spending will be $1.36 billion. That is an 
increase of $100 billion, or 8%. For comparison purposes, the total federal 
budget at the time of John F. Kennedy's inaugural was $100 billion. Today, a 
one-year increase of that amount is called . . . deficit reduction! How can 
this be? 
</P>
<P>
The government was planning to increase spending by an even greater amount (by 
about $124 billion). But then the estimators lopped off $24 billion and said 
they had "cut" spending by that amount. That's called adjusted consolidated 
base-line budgeting, and you don't want to know anything more about it. In the 
next fiscal year, 1992, spending goes up again, to $1.392 billion, and in case 
you were wondering, that's another "cut" (because otherwise it would have been 
$1.442 billion). Smoke and mirrors, I would call it. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the news media have been very polite about all this and more or less 
have refrained from pointing out the embarrassing details, but any day now they 
will begin to do so. Bush will find out what "deficit reduction" really means: 
spending increases, with new taxes to pay for them. The "$500-billion deficit 
reduction" will be re-labeled the "1990 Bush tax increase.' 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, incidentally, President Reagan was hoodwinked in much the same way, 
with a promise by Congress that it would give him $3 in spending cuts for every 
$1 that taxes were increased. He delivered on the taxes, but Congress went on 
spending as before. In fiscal 1980, which ended just before Reagan was elected, 
total federal spending was $591 billion. Between 1981-91, tax revenues 
increased by 90%. But spending increased by 107%. That's why we have a deficit 
today. Spending is out of control. 
</P>
<P>
Revenues increased as much as they did because the economy was growing, and it 
was growing because tax rates were cut. Now they are being raised, and the 
effect on growth will not be good. Bush will be thwarted in his desire to 
forget about the budget. With tax increases, he will have to think about it 
endlessly. 
</P>
<P>
The President is about to discover one of the great Washington paradoxes: 
Pragmatism doesn't work. It didn't work for Jimmy Carter and it won't work for 
Bush. This seems odd, of course, because pragmatism means pursuing the workable 
rather than the ideal; being flexible rather than intransigent. But it has been 
noted in Washington that political appointees can cope with the bureaucracy 
more easily if they are academics with ideas rather than businessmen used to 
meeting a payroll. It's even more true at the presidential level. 
</P>
<P>
Ideas drive politics; call it ideology if you will. Without it, you're at sea. 
In recent weeks Bush has lamely pleaded that he would have liked a better deal, 
ideally, but those mean Democrats forced him to do what he had hoped to avoid. 
Once they saw that his point of compromise was movable, based on a desire to 
reach any agreement rather than a particular one, they kept moving that point 
further from his initial position. In short, they jerked him about, because he 
signaled flexibility. He has only himself to blame. 
</P>
<P>
Now Bush is in trouble. Watch for references to his "credibility."

FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
In Tom Bethell's commentary Oct. 25, several figures were incorrectly expressed 
in billions. The correct figures are: total government spending for fiscal 
1990-$1.26 trillion; projected government spending for the new fiscal 
year-$1.36 trillion; projected spending for fiscal year 1992-$1.392 trillion 
(which would have been $1.442 trillion if not for "cuts.")

BUSH'S VETO MEANS BLACK AMERICANS CONTINUE TO BE SHAFTED BY THE SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDER COCKBURN, Alexander Cockburn writes for the Nation and other 
publications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The substantial number of black Americans in the gulf facing war and maybe 
death hear that their commander in chief and President has vetoed the Civil 
Rights Act of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Black Americans already nurture considerable doubts about the wisdom of 
President Bush's seeming rush to war. In one poll taken a month ago nearly half 
of those polled disagreed with the huge deployment to the gulf. As one black 
community leader put it, his people have been fighting a war for 10 years 
already, against the economic onslaught launched by Ronald Reagan in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians (and pundits) are now discovering to their immense surprise just 
how angry Americans are at the way the nation's affairs have been conducted in 
recent years. Amid this surprise the anger of black Americans is probably less 
of a shock, if only because Bush and before him Reagan zealously taunted them 
for years, busily bootlicking the white conservative voter. Political 
Washington and its flunkys in the academies have invented a whole language to 
get round the simple fact that black Americans are being shafted by the system. 
The essential message in this language is that blacks have only themselves to 
blame, and if only they had proper families and didn't smoke crack, all would 
be well. 
</P>
<P>
I was in South-Central Los Angeles last week, visiting the Southern California 
Library for Social Studies and Research. A guest curator, Sophie Spalding, has 
mounted a photographic exhibition of the Watts rebellion whose 25th anniversary 
fell on August 11. Where the library now stands at 6120 So. Vermont there was 
once an appliance store. In those mid-August days of 1965 two black Americans 
were killed by either the LAPD or the National Guard in front of a store later 
burned out. 
</P>
<P>
What was particularly striking in the news clips and photo spreads on the 
library walls and in display cases was its emphasis on the irrationality of the 
rising across South-Central. Both journalists and cartoonists depicted the 
rioters as a bunch of simian drunks betraying the high purpose of such leaders 
as Martin Luther King. President Johnson took the same tack, saying the 
uprising bore no relation to the orderly struggle for civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
The almost reflexive stratagems of overdog propaganda were also indicated in 
the photos and captions of the Aug. 30, 1965, Life magazine. Here again the 
message of utter irrationality was strongly and often subtly stated. Life's 
cover showed a black man carrying furniture, with the caption "Los Angeles 
resident flees his home set afire in the riot." Implication: The rioters burned 
out their own people. But the rebellion was a response to years of brutality 
and commercial exploitation. The targets were therefore the police and 
businesses that South-Central folk knew had been ripping them off for years. 
Scarcely any homes were burned. 
</P>
<P>
Another Life photograph showed national guardsmen bending over a 
Mexican-American in an attitude of concern. The caption said he had been 
wounded by a black mob. Implication: blacks against whites and browns. It's 
possible the episode occurred, though there's no record of it. Records do show 
Mexican-Americans killed by the LAPD or the National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
When the peril had passed, came "understanding." On Aug. 19, 1965, the Los 
Angeles Times ran an editorial quoting the analysis of a "respected Negro 
psychiatrist," said analysis commencing with "Breakdown of Negro family life." 
Thus, making their appearance were two props of concerned editorialists 
pondering black rage at injustice: the helpful (and always "respected") black 
psychiatrist and the disintegrating black family, as explanatory pathology 
launched by Daniel Patrick Moynihan at exactly that time. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the rebellion there were, naturally, promises to rehab the area, 
address the grievances. Twenty years later Watts got a fortified shopping mall. 
Instead of Police Chief William Parker who said the rioters were like monkeys 
in a zoo, the city has Parker's former driver, Daryl Gates, who says casual 
drug users should be taken out and shot. In black communities the signs of 
poverty mount, in figures for infant mortality and kindred indexes. Once again 
there's a fake language to deal with such statistics and occlude the truth that 
blacks are being shafted. There's decorous talk about the "lack of prenatal 
care" and kindred verbal wallpaper over the ugly structure of inequality. 
</P>
<P>
Bush vetoed the civil-rights act and the Senate sustained him because they 
thought they could get away with it. Chief Parker's men beat up blacks 25 years 
ago because they thought they could get away with it. Politics is partly the 
business of knowing when you can't get away with it any more, and this is where 
President Bush may have misjudged his decade.

NEW 644-MILE SECTION OF GREAT WALL FOUND IN NORTHEAST CHINA

Archeologists have found a new section of China's famous Great Wall, extending 
its eastern end more than 600 miles to the border with North Korea, official 
reports said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The reports in the English-language China Daily and in the Beijing Daily said 
the finding coincided with historical records. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese archeologists conducted a field survey from February to July in 
northeast China's Liaoning province, where they found remnants of the wall, 
including 12 beacon towers, important tablets dating back to the 14th to 17th 
centuries, ceramics and weapons, the reports said. 
</P>
<P>
The new section adds 644 miles to the wall, which previously was said to be 
about 1,500 miles long. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the eastern end of the Great Wall was thought to be the seacoast 
town of Shanhaiguan, in Hebei province at the border with Liaoning. 
</P>
<P>
The new section of the wall continues from Shanhaiguan, zigzagging northeast 
through Liaoning province, passing through Shenyang and then south to the 
border city of Dandong. 
</P>
<P>
The report did not say what condition the new section of wall is in. Most of 
the rest of the Great Wall, except for sections that have been renovated as 
tourist sites, is little more than heaps of dirt and rubble.

PLUTONIUM WASTE CONTAMINATION FOUND NEAR PARIS

<P>
Concrete drums containing nuclear waste have leaked plutonium into the ground 
near an area where hundreds of children play each day, a newspaper reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Parisien said the discovery of plutonium in soil samples shows 
there is a radioactive threat to residents of Saint Aubin, a town on the 
outskirts of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
But the official Atomic Energy Commissariat, in charge of France's nuclear 
program, said the plutonium discovered measured well below minimum danger 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
Le Parisien reported that an independent German scientific team from the 
University of Bremen conducted random samples on about nine pounds of soil 
gathered near the site. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,500 concrete barrels containing nuclear waste have been stacked at the 
site since the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Le Parisien said at least 500 are cracked and have been leaking radioactive 
waste for years. 
</P>
<P>
The energy agency said that the maximum level of radioactive elements found by 
the researchers was less than 1/30th of the minimum considered to be dangerous.

San Diego State's midseason training camp continued on Wednesday with no game 
in sight. The Aztecs' next opponent, Utah, is still 10 days away. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Al Luginbill was asked how his team might handle the three-week layoff. 
"I have no more clue on this than you," he said. "I think (Arizona Coach) Dick 
Tomey when he was at Hawaii and (Air Force Coach) Fisher DeBerry are the only 
ones I can think of who have gone through it. But I'm sure they're not going to 
give San Diego State any pointers." 
</P>
<P>
Damon Pieri continued to work at free safety in place of the injured Johnny 
Walker. Luginbill said Pieri is likely to start at the position against Utah. 
Trainer Brian Barry said Walker (foot) will not play in the Utah game. 
Linebacker Derek Sang (neck sprain) is questionable. DAVE McKIBBEN

FISHING NOTES; 
</P>
<P>
OLD PORK RIND BAIT METHOD STILL EFFECTIVE FOR SALTWATER ANGLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
An old fishing method still brings good results, according to Henry Church of 
Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
Church has been fishing the ocean for more than six decades as a commercial 
fisherman with hook and line for albacore and tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Now retired, Church fishes only for the sport and releases most of his catch. 
</P>
<P>
Church said when he looks at an angler's tackle box today he sees all different 
types of jigs, feathers and trolling gadgets. 
</P>
<P>
Today's saltwater anglers may be blind to the merits of using pork as a 
versatile fish catcher, he said. 
</P>
<P>
To prove his point, Church said he used pork rind on a recent trip for sharks 
and hooked a mako during a slow troll. He estimated it to be 80 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Horsing it in, Church said the hook came out of the shark with the pork still 
on the hook. 
</P>
<P>
Another one of his theories is when fishing deep water, pork rind attached to a 
hook will net more strikes than bouncing a jig on the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Church said an angler will find it very useful to carry some rind in his tackle 
box. 
</P>
<P>
Tuna continue to be caught for quality, but not quantity. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Sportfishing's Aztec and Toronado returned last weekend with less 
than one tuna per rod. Yellowtail and rockfish made up most of the two-day 
Cortez Bank trip. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Filbach of Long Beach was the jackpot winner aboard the Aztec with a 
47-pound bluefin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Krepinovich of Lomita and Jay Akahashi of Gardena each caught jackpot 
contenders of 35 pounds apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Lomita fishermen Tom Simpson and Tom Marquez returned from fishing Buena Vista, 
Baja Mexico, and described the trip aboard the boat Mickey as one of the best 
they have had. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson and Marquez caught sailfish up to 75 pounds and broadbill of more than 
90 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Marquez said using cut bonito for bait, they hooked and released more than 60 
dorado on the three-day trip. 
</P>
<P>
Sonny Bennett of Marina del Rey worked Santa Monica Bay Monday in his skiff and 
drifted for a mile fishing for halibut. He said within an hour he had his 
five-fish limit. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett said he used herring for bait with a halibut rig. The five flatties 
weighed upwards of 15 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: Duane McCutheon of Redondo Beach caught the whopper of the 
week fishing aboard the Blackjack at Cortez Bank. He landed a 51-pound bluefin 
tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Herinance of Long Beach, fishing aboard the Toronado, caught a 50-pound 
bluefin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Mojuharan of Hawthorne, fishing aboard the Vagabond at Benites Island, 
caught a 39-pound yellowfin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Henderson of Lomita, fishing at Tanner Bank aboard the Pacifica, caught a 
36-pound bluefin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Gold of Gardena, fishing aboard the Hitless Miss at the horseshoe kelp, 
caught an 18-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Chase of San Pedro, fishing at San Clemente Island aboard the Diawa, 
caught a 16-pound lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
Fish Reports: Local fishing catches of barracuda have slowed, with bonito 
setting the pace for limit catches. Outer islands continue to be good for bass 
and yellowtail. 
</P>

MANU: 'I MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE'; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNITY COLLEGES: RIVERSIDE PLAYER'S PUNCHING OF OFFICIAL ON SATURDAY COULD 
END UP IN COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A football player strikes an official, and one wonders: 
</P>
<P>
How can this happen? What would cause a talented athlete to put his career in 
jeopardy by engaging in such a blatantly vicious act? What was he thinking? Was 
he thinking? 
</P>
<P>
The answers, it seem, won't come any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Manu, the Riverside City College linebacker who punched field judge Nick 
Van Lue during a game Saturday, isn't ready to talk. The former Carson High 
standout has been unavailable for comment, except for a brief statement 
released Monday by Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not trying to hide from the media," Manu said, according to the release. 
"But for several reasons, I cannot yet comment on my actions in last weekend's 
game against Golden West. As I have said through the college, I am sorry for my 
actions. I made a terrible mistake and have embarrassed the college, my coaches 
and teammates." 
</P>
<P>
Riverside dismissed Manu from the team Sunday, a decision that figures to 
weaken the Tigers. Manu, a 6-foot-1, 240-pound sophomore, entered Saturday's 
game leading Riverside in tackles and interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
But it remains to be seen if the dismissal is sufficient punishment to satisfy 
Van Lue. The 43-year-old teacher and coach at Narbonne High said he will decide 
whether to pursue legal action after meeting with Mission Conference 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a lawyer," Van Lue said. "I have to do what's best for other officials 
so this doesn't happen again. I'm sure (Manu) is sorry now, but he didn't think 
about it at the time." 
</P>
<P>
Van Lue spent four hours at Fountain Valley Hospital on Saturday night after he 
was punched on the chin by Manu in the third quarter of Golden West's 22-13 
victory over Riverside at Orange Coast College. Van Lue had just cited Manu for 
unsportsmanlike conduct, saying he saw the player take an open-handed swing at 
a Golden West player after a tackle. 
</P>
<P>
Van Lue, who doesn't remember hitting the ground, was unconscious for about a 
minute and remained on the ground for several minutes before being assisted to 
the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Fox, a Narbonne assistant football coach who accompanied Van Lue to the 
game, drove his friend to the hospital, where Van Lue said he passed out again 
for about 15 minutes. After tests and X-rays, Van Lue said doctors told him he 
had suffered a mild concussion. 
</P>
<P>
In his 20 years as an official, the last 14 on the college level, Van Lue said 
it was the first time a player had ever taken a swing at him. 
</P>
<P>
"You get players who bump into you, or spit at you, or curse at you," he said. 
"I've been through all that as an official. You do as much talking to those 
players, and most respond very well. Except this kid here. He just lost it." 
</P>
<P>
Riverside Coach Barry Meier and Gene Vollnogle, who coached Manu at Carson, 
said it was out of character for the player to act in such a violent manner. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel this is an isolated incident," Meier said. "Sam is a good kid. He 
realizes he made a terrible mistake. Right now we just want to help him recover 
from this incident and go on with his academic career." 
</P>
<P>
Meier said he will encourage Manu to stay in school and seek counseling to 
review the incident and explore ways to moderate his behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Vollnogle described Manu as a loner at Carson, where he played fullback and 
linebacker on the Colts' 1988 L.A. City Section 4-A championship team. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like him," Vollnogle said of the incident. "He's usually a controlled 
individual. His problem was not going to class (at Carson). I can't imagine him 
instigating anything. 
</P>
<P>
"He's real quiet; a really nice guy. I never even heard him cuss. He's the type 
of kid you would like to go out with your daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for me to believe that he would punch an official. But things 
happen. People go off." 
</P>
<P>
Exactly what set off Sam Manu on Saturday remains a mystery.

PADRES TO ALLOW RASMUSSEN, PAGLIARULO, LYNN TO FILE FOR FREE AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Padres have decided to allow starting pitcher Dennis Rasmussen, third 
baseman Mike Pagliarulo and outfielder Fred Lynn to file for free agency 
without making any contract offers before the Nov. 4 deadline, Joe McIlvaine, 
Padre general manager, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres also will offer salary arbitration today to first baseman Jack 
Clark, preventing him from becoming a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an easy decision," McIlvaine said. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, however, still could be declared a second-look free agent by an 
impending Collusion III ruling, which is expected within weeks. If Clark 
becomes a free agent and signs with another team, the Padres would not be 
compensated. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just waiting right now," said Clark, who led the Padres with 25 homers. 
"Everything hinges on that ruling. I just want a decision one way or another, 
to know what's going to happen to me." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres remain undecided about who they want to retain or seek in the free 
agent class. Privately, they've expressed interest in third baseman Terry 
Pendleton, center fielder Willie McGee and left-handed reliever Ken Dayley, but 
they have yet to publicly disclose their sentiments. They've also talked about 
free agent right fielder Darryl Strawberry, but Strawberry said three weeks ago 
he will not play for the Padres, chastising the organization and its fans. 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen, who earned $802,500 this past season, is one of nine left-handed 
starters eligible for free agency. He and his agent, Bob Teaff, have had 
preliminary discussions with the Padres, but no contractual numbers have been 
discussed. 
</P>
<P>
"The door's open, they know where they can start," said Rasmussen, who was 
11-15 with a 4.51 earned-run average. "But it's evident we'll have to be 
filing." 
</P>
<P>
Lynn, who like Clark had to be provided arbitration by today's deadline to 
avoid being eligible for free agency, is not expected to be offered that 
option. Yet, Lynn likely will return to the Padres as a reserve 
outfielder/first baseman since Manager Greg Riddoch says that he wants him 
back. Lynn, who earned $600,000 this past season, is expected to sign at about 
the same salary for the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
Pagliarulo, one of six third basemen eligible for free agency, said Wednesday 
he also wants to return to the Padres, but it's unknown whether the club want 
him. Pagliarulo batted .254 with seven homers and 38 runs batted in, and the 
Padres must determine whether they can improve by finding another third baseman 
or using Bip Roberts as an everyday player at that position. 
</P>
<P>
"They need a third baseman, that's very obvious," said Pagliarulo, who earned 
$605,000 this past season. "But I just don't know what the manager or 
organization wants to do. I'll give them every opportunity to sign me, but I 
want a commitment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to demand anything and I can't, not with my numbers. But I 
certainly can play better and I will, by playing every day. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a very loyal guy, but it's a two-way street, isn't it?"

Pacific Enterprises: The Los Angeles-based energy and retailing company 
reported net income of $60 million for the third quarter, up 22% from a year 
ago. Operating revenue was $1.63 billion, up 4%. "Third-quarter results were 
helped by the continued strong performance of our utility, Southern California 
Gas Co., and the higher oil prices realized by our oil and gas subsidiary," 
said Chairman James R. Ukropina.

Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.: The nation's largest retailer said its third-quarter 
profit fell 30% from a year ago to $179.2 million despite a 5.9% revenue 
increase to $13.96 billion. Sears cited sharply lower gains from sales of 
property in the Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group, reflecting the soft 
residential real estate market. Earnings from the Sears Merchandise and Dean 
Witter Financial Services groups improved while Allstate Insurance Group's 
earnings declined, the Chicago-based company said.

FDIC FILES A $560-MILLION SUIT FILED IN S&amp;L FRAUD CASE

<P>
Federal bank regulators have filed a $560-million lawsuit against the former 
owner of Western Savings Assn., contending that he defrauded the failed thrift 
of at least that much money. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. also accuses Jarrett E. Woods Jr. of 
spending $7 million of depositors' money on himself during the thrift's final 
months in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
No criminal charges have been filed against Woods. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit is one of the largest ever filed by the government against a 
savings and loan owner. It was filed Friday in Dallas but not released until 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The suit accuses Woods and Western Capital, a corporation he controlled, of 
engaging in fraud and violating contracts. The government alleges that in the 
four years Woods controlled the thrift, he squandered its deposits on high-risk 
and fraudulent investments and improper loans. 
</P>
<P>
"The losses suffered by the institution appear to exceed $1 billion, at least 
$560 million of which was the preventable result of the policies and practices 
implemented at Western by Jarrett E. Woods Jr. and Western Capital Corp.," the 
suit states. 
</P>
<P>
Woods is accused of using thrift money to refinance his home, funneling 
millions into his children's trust funds, paying off a personal loan and paying 
himself an $800,000 bonus and a $41,667 monthly salary. 
</P>
<P>
When federal regulators closed Western in September, 1986, examiners found 
"deficient or non-existent appraisals, inadequate loan documentation, 
inaccurate accounting and shoddy record-keeping," the lawsuit states. 
</P>
<P>
Woods disagreed with the regulators' contentions. He claimed that the thrift 
was not insolvent and that he had tried to find solutions to the examiners' 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Woods could not be reached for comment Wednesday.

SOCIETY: 39 'ELIGIBLES' ALL SET FOR BIDDING WAR 
</P>

As the competition for the charity dollar quickens, fund-raising tactics grow 
more and more inventive. 
</P>
<P>
If you happened to stroll past the terrace of the Golden Triangle's Paparazzi 
restaurant Monday evening, rest assured that your eyes did not deceive you -- 
there were indeed more than 30 masked men drinking beer and holding forth over 
a buffet of deviled eggs and stuffed endive leaves. 
</P>
<P>
The group represented nearly the full complement of 39 unattached but most 
eligible single men recruited by the local chapter of the March of Dimes to 
place their persons on the auction block at "Bid for Bachelors," a major event 
to be given Nov. 9 at the Hyatt Regency La Jolla hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The men, not only masked but also wearing identification tags bearing only 
their first names, were present to mingle with some of the single women who 
have anted $50 each for preferred seating at the bachelor sell-off. 
</P>
<P>
The event doesn't quite match Sadie Hawkins Day, but it comes close in spirit: 
In the case of each bachelor, the woman who makes the highest bid is entitled 
to a date. Nor are these rendezvous of the commonplace dinner-and-a-movie 
variety, because the men have put together "dream date" packages, most of which 
include travel and several of which head as far afield as the Utah snowfields, 
Mexico City and the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
High bids at previous bachelor auctions have exceeded $2,000, and this year 
women with constricted pocketbooks have been encouraged to invite sponsors -- 
just as at charity walk-a-thons -- to underwrite their efforts. Talk about 
novel twists. 
</P>
<P>
The group of men includes physicians, attorneys, photographers and real estate 
brokers, as well as an environmental scientist who specializes in pollution 
control, a firefighter and a Top Gun pilot. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's kickoff party, the bachelors, rather unsurprisingly, expressed 
unanimous enthusiasm over an upcoming experience that all described as 
unprecedented in their lives. Donn Marrin, a Del Mar scientist, said, "This 
will be the most unusual thing I've ever done, but I'm ready for it." His "San 
Diego by land, air and sea" package offers lunch in La Jolla, a helicopter tour 
and dinner and dancing on San Diego Bay aboard the Invader. 
</P>
<P>
To a degree, at least some of the date packages seem competitively designed. 
Photographer Vincent Andrewnas has assembled a weekend that will include a 
get-acquainted brunch, stays in different hotels each night (separate 
accommodations will be provided), three theatrical performances, three dinners, 
a "day of beauty" at a top salon, Sunday brunch and a Symphony matinee concert 
-- with a lim 
</P>
<P>
ousine always at hand to carry the couple on this sybaritic safari. Many 
honeymoons don't entail half as much. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the event will feature a runway jammed with tuxedoed men, it is 
being stage-managed by women. 
</P>
<P>
Local March of Dimes executive director Dani Montague, who worked for the same 
charity in San Francisco and Portland and assisted with bachelor auctions in 
both cities, said the organization founded the concept in Las Vegas in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been an excellent way for March of Dimes to recruit new volunteers," she 
said. " 'Bid for Bachelors' has been successful everywhere it has been held, 
and the men associated with the event are the kind we're proud to have 
associated with the March of Dimes." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what women should look forward to at the event, co-chair Penny Martin 
considered the question less than a moment before responding "Men!" This 
probably explained the presence at Paparazzi of the 40 or so women who thus far 
have paid $50 for preferred seating. In the words of March of Dimes spokeswoman 
Louise Nichols, the women were there to take advantage of "the chance to meet, 
interview and preview" the bachelors. Few seemed reticent. 
</P>
<P>
General admission tickets to "Bid for Bachelors" cost $25 in advance, or $30 at 
the door. The Nov. 9 event will begin with a 6 p.m. cocktail and "meet the 
bachelors" reception; the auction will commence at 7:15 p.m. For further 
information, call the March of Dimes. 
</P>
<P>
The passage of time has been of unusual importance to San Diego's Jessop 
family, which built the city's most prominent public clock -- now ensconced in 
Horton Plaza -- and sold watches to several generations of its citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The passage of the family's first century here (the centennial of the arrival 
from England of Joseph and Mary Jessop occurred in August) was both noted and 
celebrated at a Oct. 11 tribute in the Marina Ballroom of the San Diego 
Marriott. More than 2 dozen of the more than 100 Jessops living in Southern 
California attended the benefit for the Copley Family YMCA, along with 
representatives of many of the city's older families. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the clock struck 7 p.m., the ballroom's foyer was crowded with a 
long-acquainted group that included not only a heavy sprinkling of Jessops, but 
representatives of the Fletcher, Klauber, Clark, Gildred, Luce, Frost, 
Borthwick and Burnham families. 
</P>
<P>
It was, for most, a familiar get-together, or perhaps a dressy reand Liz 
Jessop; Mary and George Carter Jessop; Linda and Bill Fox; Jane and Richard 
Lynch; Helen and David Jessop; Mary and Alonzo Lynch; Klonie and Fritz Kunzel; 
Bill and Sylvia Luce Heitzmann; Detty June and Phil Klauber; Cathy and Bruce 
Frost; Georgia Borthwick with Tom Fleming; Lee and Larry Cox; Betty and Doug 
McElfresh; Virginia and Ferd Fletcher; Bobby and Norman Greene; Lyn and Phil 
Gildred; Louise and Steve Fletcher, and Mary and Dallas Clark.

Couturier Count Dracula 
</P>
<P>
If you can't stand putting little Bif and Missy in store-bought Halloween 
costumes, don't despair. Without having to slave over a hot sewing machine -- 
perish the thought -- you can provide designer duds for your darling duo. 
</P>
<P>
You can get a specially created fairy princess gown or a couturierish Count 
Dracula, an old-fashioned lady design or one of several hand-crafted clown 
costumes. 
</P>
<P>
The designer, CarLynn Clarke, says she spends most of the year making things 
ranging from wedding dresses to personally designed doll clothes, but her 
favorite time of year is Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
"Even when my husband and I had a bridal shop in Reseda, where I created 
one-of-a-kind wedding dresses or could copy them from a magazine picture, I 
still took time to do the Halloween things," she said. "I used to take the 
costumes out to a Simi swap meet. They were so popular, people would come back 
year after year for them." 
</P>
<P>
But after her husband died last year, Clarke said, she left the bridal business 
and moved from the Burbank house she had shared with him and in which she had 
raised 11 children. 
</P>
<P>
"The children were his, mine, ours and theirs . . . the theirs because we 
raised two children who were orphaned," Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
She is now selling her custom-made costumes from the front yard of her home at 
20802 Devonshire St., Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
"I love Halloween because it's so much fun seeing the kids so excited and 
expectant," Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
This year, she is looking forward to seeing some of her one-of-a-kind creations 
come trick or treating at her front door. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Tricks, Dubious Treats 
</P>
<P>
Thinking about decking yourself out for Halloween as an exotic snake charmer? 
</P>
<P>
We know where you can get the snake. 
</P>
<P>
The Sherman Oaks Casa de Pets, 13323 Ventura Blvd., has a large assortment of 
coiled cuties, although there are those who would think that these little 
darlings are neither cute, little or darling. 
</P>
<P>
And they don't do tricks. 
</P>
<P>
How would you feel about taking home a $149.99 baby reticulated python, or a 
$69.99 speckled king snake? There are other pythons that cost between $300 and 
$1,000, depending on size. Some are about 16 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
Those guys look fairly formidable coiled up in their cages. 
</P>
<P>
They also have a Tokay gecko, a Russian tortoise or any number of different 
kinds of tarantulas. 
</P>
<P>
When asked who on earth would want these things, manager Renee Borin said the 
shop's customers include Michael Jackson, Erik Estrada and Shelley Duvall. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, there are some fuzzy little chinchillas for sale for between $90 and 
$200, and some nice-looking birds like parakeets and parrots, and a medium 
sulfur-crested cockatoo named Reggie that sells for $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
There are also some sweet-looking little white mice and some pretty white rats, 
but we are not sure if they are there to be sold as pets or dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Mindful that a lot of pets, like snakes, end up at the Wildlife Waystation, we 
wondered what requirements the store makes for allowing people to buy these 
exotics. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't ask people what they are going to do with the animals or if they know 
what they are doing," store manager Renee Borin said. "We do offer them 
information about care and feeding, but you can't ask people if they are 
qualified to own the pets any more than you can ask someone if they will take 
care of a puppy or a cat or a baby, for that matter." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eschewing the Fat 
</P>
<P>
They're still chewing it over at the Canoga Park Ralphs across from the 
Fallbrook Mall. 
</P>
<P>
"If we ever doubted that people care about labeling food to make healthy 
decisions about buying, this has made us believers," said Jose Montes, the 
store's manager of operations. 
</P>
<P>
"This" was the turnout for the recent weekend cholesterol screening 
co-sponsored by Ralphs and the HMO Health Net. Montes estimated that 1,200 
people showed up for the two-day event, "which was pretty amazing since we are 
a relatively small store." 
</P>
<P>
People were queued up across the front of the store, and the line wrapped 
around the side, but once the people got inside, it took less than 15 minutes 
to get the results. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the free testing, people got some free literature, including a 
48-page booklet called Nutri Guide that gives tips on healthy eating and 
explains the store's coding system for foods low in calories, fat, cholesterol 
and salt. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Gray, a Woodland Hills housewife whose hair matches her name, said she 
had never been tested although her husband, a business executive, had been 
tested several times. She wanted to see if her count was within healthy limits. 
</P>
<P>
Ray and Bonnie Smithson from West Hills had both been tested before and knew 
what to expect. She said she watches her diet and has a healthy cholesterol 
level. He doesn't and doesn't. When asked why he was being tested again if he 
wasn't going to give up his evil eating ways, he rolled his eyes and pointed at 
his wife. 
</P>
<P>
A young man in his mid-20s, who wished to be known only as Smitty, waited 
patiently in the 20-minute line Sunday for his first test. 
</P>
<P>
When asked why he, at a somewhat youthful age, was so concerned about his 
cholesterol, he stared blankly at his questioner. "My what?" he asked, looking 
a little nervous. "I thought I was in a line to register to vote." 
</P>
<P>
Told the purpose of the line, he shook his head, trying to sort it all out. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I just think I'll do this cholesterol thing," Smitty finally decided. 
"It doesn't hurt and it's free." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Silver Foxes 
</P>
<P>
If you are male, between the age of 70 and 80, and have been watching your 
cholesterol and everything else, you might want to get into Theo Hasapes' 
contest for the best physique on an older man. 
</P>
<P>
That's not the name of the contest. 
</P>
<P>
Hasapes hasn't decided what to call it exactly. 
</P>
<P>
But he told some press people about his contest a few weeks ago and the 
entrants' pictures are pouring in. 
</P>
<P>
Four or five at last count. 
</P>
<P>
Hasapes is not discouraged by the slow start to the contest. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't take out ads or anything, so it's a little hard getting started," 
said the contest organizer, who says he is more than 70 and in pretty good 
shape himself. 
</P>
<P>
Hasapes, who says he was athletic coach at Juvenile Hall in Los Angeles for 
many years, decided to have the contest because more and more men are keeping 
in shape and they need something to look forward to. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to have these people just sitting around at the senior citizens 
centers doing nothing," Hasapes said. "I want to get them competing in 
something." 
</P>
<P>
Building on this idea, he said that if his contest gets really big, maybe 
people all over the country will keep in shape so they can enter. 
</P>
<P>
Hasapes said he set the age of the contestants between 70 and 80 because "over 
80 you either look terrible or are dead." 
</P>
<P>
Hasapes got his sisters, who own Encino Flowers With Charisma, to donate 
trophies for the winners. He thinks that if there are enough entrants, they 
should all have a banquet. 
</P>
<P>
"We could use my back yard and have a picnic," said Hasapes, who admits that he 
is not overcapitalized in this endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
Those wishing to enter the contest may send a picture and a letter explaining 
the health regimen they have followed to Hasapes at 23258 Burbank Blvd., 
Woodland Hills 91367. 
</P>
<P>
Judging will begin when there are enough entries, Hasapes said.

Knapp Ranch Park 
</P>
<P>
25000 Kittridge St., West Hills 
</P>
<P>
Size: 82 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Facilities: Three baseball diamonds, outdoor basketball court, children's play 
area, football field, picnic area, four tennis courts. 
</P>
<P>
Hours: 9 a.m. to dusk daily. 
</P>
<P>
Information: (818) 887-9800. 
</P>
<P>
The rolling hills that make up Knapp Ranch Park's trilevel facility once was 
the prize ranch of Walter Knapp. But in 1962, Knapp moved from the area and 
sold the land to the Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Department for roughly 
$200,000, with one stipulation -- that the park be dedicated to the memory of 
Knapp's son. Edwin Frank Knapp, who as a child loved playing on his father's 
wooded ranch, was 21 when he was killed during World War II. Today, a plaque 
stands at the park's entrance in memory of Edwin Knapp. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a quiet park, a very nice place to take a family or spend an afternoon," 
said Al Goldfarb, a spokesman for the department. "And that's how Walter Knapp 
wanted it to be used." 
</P>
<P>
Knapp Ranch Park, which is built on a hill that is graded into three flat 
planes, has an outdoor basketball court on its lowest level, tennis courts on 
its middle level and baseball diamonds at its peak. Nearly all the trees that 
made up the original ranch are still on the grounds, and there are picnic 
tables scattered among them. It does not have the community events that mark 
some parks, but it is one of the few places in the San Fernando Valley that 
still has the peace and tranquility of 20 years ago, Goldfarb said. KAREN

RIVAL'S CHANCES FADE AS INQUIRY CLEARS MOORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Running in a solidly Democratic district with scant campaign cash, Republican 
challenger Eric Givens has often said incumbent Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los 
Angeles) would have to be indicted in order for him to win. 
</P>
<P>
That possibility died Tuesday, when federal officials announced that Moore -- 
scrutinized for more than two years as part of an investigation into political 
corruption in Sacramento -- was cleared of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
For Givens, it's back to the political drawing board. After hearing of 
Tuesday's announcement, the 33-year-old home builder said: "I guess we'll just 
have to wait to see what 1992 brings." 
</P>
<P>
Moore's political territory, the 49th District, is one of two Assembly 
districts covering the northern portion of the South Bay. The other, the even 
more solidly Democratic 50th District, promises less competition than Moore's 
in the Nov. 6 general election. 
</P>
<P>
The 50th District incumbent, Curtis R. Tucker Jr. (D-Inglewood), drew no 
Republican opposition. His sole challenger, Peace and Freedom Party candidate 
Michael L. Long, has done virtually no campaigning and says his only reason for 
running is that no one else would enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he plans to reach voters, Long said simply: "Word of mouth. That's 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
In the 49th District, Moore, 49, is attempting to win a seventh term 
representing residents of Marina del Rey, Playa del Rey, Westchester, Culver 
City, Ladera Heights, Baldwin Hills and the Crenshaw area. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, she has lived in the shadow of the Capitol corruption 
investigation, which this year has resulted in the convictions of two elected 
officials and the indictments of a former Moore aide and a onetime lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
Unwittingly, Moore carried two bills for a bogus shrimp company set up by the 
FBI as part of an intricate sting operation. The dummy company had contributed 
money to her campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
The two elected officials, state Sen. Joseph Montoya (D-Whittier) and state 
Board of Equalization member Paul Carpenter, a former Democratic state senator 
from Norwalk, were convicted on extortion and racketeering charges for taking 
money in exchange for helping to move Moore's bills through the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, who is well-liked in Sacramento and generally given high marks for 
constituent service, has consistently denied wrongdoing and predicted that the 
investigation would not hurt her politically. 
</P>
<P>
She says voters have judged her on her legislative performance, which this year 
included the enactment of measures to curb loan swindles against homeowners and 
to prohibit the transport of food in trucks used on other occasions to 
transport garbage. 
</P>
<P>
"People evaluate me on the basis of my record, and they know I wouldn't do 
anything illegal," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
Listed on the ballot opposing Moore will be Givens, Libertarian Carin Rogers 
and Peace and Freedom Party member Alice Mae Miles, who said this week that she 
has dropped out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
None of the challengers had raised $1,000 in the first nine months of the year, 
according to recent campaign finance reports. By contrast, Moore reported 
$93,150 in contributions during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
Givens, whom Moore beat in 1988 by a ratio of more than 3 to 1, says his main 
priority as assemblyman would be to combat the severe unemployment and high 
school dropout rates plaguing minorities in his district. 
</P>
<P>
Such problems can be solved, he says, if political leaders and residents 
involve themselves more deeply in community programs and if government offers 
special tax incentives to attract businesses to minority areas. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Moore was cleared, Givens had admitted that his chances of an upset 
victory this year were slim. But he says he hopes that his 1988 and 1990 
campaigns will position him for a successful run for the Assembly should Moore 
seek higher office in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I've been looking at," Givens said. "I think I would have a real 
good shot at it if it was for an open seat." 
</P>
<P>
Rogers, the Libertarian challenger, says her main campaign proposal is to 
create a system under which Californians can decide how their tax dollars are 
spent by earmarking their tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
Like Givens, she acknowledges that her chances of victory are remote. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect to win," said Rogers, 41, a sound effects editor for the 
television show "Quantum Leap." "I just consider myself a citizen upset with 
the status quo." 
</P>
<P>
In the 50th District, Curtis Tucker Jr. is running for continued control of 
political territory spanning Inglewood, El Segundo, Lennox, parts of 
South-Central Los Angeles and Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker, 36, won his seat in a special election in February, 1989, four months 
after his father, a 14-year Assembly incumbent, died in office. Although Tucker 
is waging his first reelection campaign, he seems solidly entrenched in office. 
</P>
<P>
The freshman legislator has worked hard to consolidate the local political base 
he inherited from his father. Since taking office, he has made frequent 
community appearances, ranging from an El Segundo rally against the expansion 
of the Hyperion sewage plant to a march aimed at sparing an Inglewood Little 
League baseball diamond from development. 
</P>
<P>
His first-term legislative efforts included bills to ban the bulk use of toxic 
hydrofluoric acid in densely populated areas and to create a state office of 
minority health affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The hydrofluoric acid measure, which would would have forced refineries and 
other plants using the chemical to switch to substitutes or relocate, failed in 
committee. The health bill, intended to improve health care for minorities, 
cleared the Legislature but was vetoed by Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker says he plans to introduce both measures again next year. In the 
meantime, he will continue keeping in close touch with his district, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not changed my routine since Day One," Tucker said. "I will continue to 
go to everything and see everyone I can." 
</P>
<P>
Long, the challenger from the Peace and Freedom Party, declined to evaluate 
Tucker's record, saying he is not familiar with it. He said his purpose is 
simply to offer an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm running because other than me, there wasn't going to be anybody 
(challenging Tucker)," said Long, a 38-year-old mail clerk. "It's to give 
voters an alternative."

<TEXT>
<P>
Pete Cassidy, Cal State Northridge basketball coach, is making sure that the 
student part of the student-athlete description gets equal time. In addition to 
monitoring daily study-hall sessions, Cassidy and his staff check the 
classrooms on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge basketball players must be in class, in the first three rows of 
seats, and sitting upright in the front third portion of their chairs. 
</P>
<P>
Those who are either absent, sitting at the back of the room or slouching are 
required to join Cassidy at dawn for "cock-a-doodle-doo" runs. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want it to appear that we don't trust them," Cassidy said. "It is just 
that this is what has to be done for them to be students. It is best for their 
future." 
</P>
<P>
Quoteworthy: Todd Bowser, CSUN's 6-foot-7, 300-pound center, on his weight-loss 
program: "It is coming off as we speak, so to speak." 
</P>
<P>
Bowser attributes his loss, 25 pounds and counting, to the Loyola Marymount 
conditioning program that Cassidy adopted. 
</P>
<P>
"I do watch what I eat anyway," he said. "I guess it is hereditary." 
</P>
<P>
Since his days at Montclair Prep, Bowser has been told that he moves well for 
his size. He certainly will have to in the Matadors' run-and-gun offense. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be hard, but I'll just do it," Bowser said. "Isn't that the way the 
saying goes?" 
</P>
<P>
Rider on a storm: J. R. Rider, called the top returning junior college 
basketball player in the country by one preseason publication, has spirits 
soaring at Antelope Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a phenomenal talent," Coach Newton Chelette said of the 6-foot-5 Rider. 
"You can't stop him." 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, although numerous colleges have included Rider on their mailing 
lists, only a handful of coaches came by to see him during a recent contact 
period. Apparently they have been scared off by the sight of a Shark in the 
recruiting waters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pretty much known fact that, if everything is OK in Vegas, he's going 
there," Chelette said. 
</P>
<P>
Rider, who originally signed with Kansas State, is a transfer from Allen County 
(Kan.), where he averaged 31 points a game last season. 
</P>
<P>
He played for the North team in the Olympic Festival last summer. 
</P>
<P>
West Valley connection: With only Kirk Scott, Eugene Humphrey and Erik Cooper 
back from last season's team, the CSUN basketball team is short on familiarity, 
but Scott is well-acquainted with newcomers Keith Gibbs and Brian Kilian. All 
three attended West Valley College in Saratoga, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
When Scott was at West Valley, Gibbs attended Westmont High, just around the 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneer spirit: Scott has no delusions about how difficult it will be for the 
Matadors to be competitive this season. 
</P>
<P>
"First-year Division I programs have it tough," Scott said. "We got a bunch of 
pioneers here. We know it is going to be tough and we take it as a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"With the style of play we have it is going to be hard for other teams to keep 
up. This is the best shape I've ever been in." 
</P>
<P>
Saved by the bell: Former Cleveland High standout Andre Chevalier has avoided 
freshman initiation so far, but he has found college basketball at CSUN to be 
much more physical than the high school game. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't call those ticky-tack fouls," Chevalier said. "I have to get used 
to being held when I'm dribbling." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his freshman status, Chevalier isn't afraid to speak his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"The team has a positive attitude even though the media is saying we're not 
going to win many games," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stat watch: Football -- Northridge quarterback Sherdrick Bonner has attempted 
137 passes and completed 63 with only one touchdown and one interception. . . . 
Northridge leads the Western Football Conference in turnover ratio: The 
Matadors have committed only 14 turnovers while forcing 25. . . . Tailback 
Albert Fann needs 88 yards to become Northridge's first 4,000-yard rusher. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Bobby Webster of Glendale has played a major part in the Vaqueros' 
four-game winning streak. The freshman from Pasadena High has rushed for at 
least 143 yards and scored two or more touchdowns in every game during that 
stretch, including a 210-yard, three-touchdown performance against Ventura last 
week. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley held San Bernardino Valley to 90 yards in offense in the last 
three quarters of Saturday's 21-14 win after giving up 153 yards in the first 
quarter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Steve Miller of Antelope Valley is only 114 yards short of making the 
Marauders' all-time top 10 career rushing list. Miller, who leads Foothill 
Conference backs with 606 yards this season, has gained 1,053 during his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Soccer -- Forward Danny Daniels of Northridge ranks 11th in scoring in the 
21-team Division I Far West region. Daniels, a sophomore from the island of 
Cyprus, has eight goals and five assists. . . . Bobby Reyes of Northridge is 
tied for second in assists with nine and goalkeeper Joel Entreken ranks 13th 
with a 1.30 goals-against average. 
</P>
<P>
Bad break: Kevin Burt, special-teams center on the Northridge football team, 
broke the ring finger on his right hand during practice last week and is out 
for the season. The 6-1, 240-pound redshirt freshman is the son of Matador 
Coach Bob Burt. Ed Allum, CSUN's starting center, has taken over duties as the 
team's long-snapper. 
</P>
<P>
Injury report: Clayton Bamberg, CSUN's starting safety, is listed as probable 
for Saturday's Western Football Conference game at Santa Clara. Bamberg 
sustained a bruised left knee in the first half of Northridge's 24-13 win over 
Cal State Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Helping hand: Antelope Valley's football schedule has been a factor in the 
Marauders' 6-0-1 start this season. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that it has been loaded with pushovers, but the fact is that 
the Marauders have their toughest opponents at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"The conference schedule rotates, so we didn't have much to do with that," 
Coach Brent Carder said. "But it just happened that we play the best teams in 
our conference in the second half of the season. And with a young team like 
ours, that's the best possible set-up." 
</P>
<P>
The Marauders (4-0-1 in conference play) are currently third in the Foothill 
Conference standings behind co-leaders Mt. San Jacinto (6-0, 4-0) and Citrus 
(4-2, 4-0), and 1 1/2 games in front of fourth-place Desert (3-4, 3-2), 
Saturday's opponent. 
</P>
<P>
After a bye next week, Antelope Valley will play host to Mt. San Jacinto on 
Nov. 10 before traveling to meet Citrus in its regular-season finale the 
following week. 
</P>
<P>
Service ace: The Antelope Valley women's volleyball team (9-2, 7-2) was tied 
for second in the Foothill Conference standings heading into Wednesday night's 
match at Rio Hondo thanks largely to Lorna Sawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Sawyer, who had 31 service aces last season, set a school mark for career aces 
when she hit her 51st winner last week. She also has become the fourth Antelope 
Valley player to post more than 200 kills in her career. 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Heidi Roarty leads the Marauders with 80 kills and 27 aces this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Hitting the road: While most collegiate cross-country teams will be competing 
in their respective conference meets this weekend, Division I independent 
Northridge will run a road race, the Alhambra Moonlight 8K, on Saturday night 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
The race serves as a final tuneup before the NCAA Division I District 8 meet in 
Fresno on Nov. 10. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the downfalls of not being in (a) conference," Coach Don 
Strametz said. "Our top people haven't raced in two weeks and three weeks is 
too long of a layoff. (The Alhambra) course is flat, fast and it won't take as 
much out of them as a hilly cross-country course would." 
</P>
<P>
Staff writers Theresa Munoz, Mike Hiserman, John Ortega, Brendan Healey and 
Kirby Lee contributed to this notebook.

<P>
DISTANCE RUNNER 
</P>
<P>
Few would deny that Moorpark College running back Freddie Bradley is a big-play 
performer, considering how often the sophomore has had runs of more than 40 
yards in the past 1 1/2 seasons.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL OKS COUNTY DEAL TO BUY RIGHTS OF WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission gave its formal approval to 
the proposed $450-million purchase of Southern Pacific rights of way and other 
land and facilities. But Neil Peterson, the commission's executive director, 
cautioned that there are serious impedements before the deal can be consummated 
March 31. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson noted that the county plans to buy only a share of the ownership of 
two of the three lines it plans to use for commuter rail service. He said that 
before the county puts up any money, it will want assurance of immediate 
operating rights on the lines to both Santa Clarita and Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said Southern Pacific will continue to run freight trains on the Santa 
Clarita and Moorpark lines, and he told the commission the railroad so far is 
balking at allowing the county the kind of operating rights it wants.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ST. JOHN WINS DELAY IN DECISION ON TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A hearing on whether Juanita St. John should stand trial for allegedly stealing 
$178,000 from a city-funded Los Angeles-Africa trade program was continued 
until Nov. 27 to give the defense time to prepare final arguments. 
</P>
<P>
St. John's attorney, who has sought several delays, is attempting to persuade 
Municipal Judge David Doi that a trial is unwarranted, despite prosecution 
evidence that St. John withdrew large sums of task force money for house 
payments and other personal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
A former business associate of Mayor Tom Bradley, St. John has argued she was 
entitled to the money, saying that most of the money was actually salary. She 
drew a salary of about $75,000 -- nearly twice what investigators say was 
legal.

LOCAL ELECTIONS: DOWNEY MUNICIPAL COURT; 
</P>
<P>
CANDIDATE'S ILLEGITIMATE SON WORKS TO DEFEAT FATHER'S BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Leo R. Villa, candidate for Downey Municipal Court judge, has taken some hits 
from an unexpected opponent: a son, born out of wedlock 34 years ago, who has 
mounted his own campaign to derail Villa's election bid. 
</P>
<P>
The son, Richard L. Villa, said this week he is angry because his father has 
seen him only twice and barely acknowledges his existence. He has taken his ire 
onto the campaign trail, plastering Downey with more than 200 campaign signs 
that read, "Leo R. Villa's son says vote no on Villa." 
</P>
<P>
"How can someone who lacks such morals and compassion toward me judge others?" 
said the younger Villa, a computer book salesman. "After thinking about it a 
lot, I decided to go public." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Bar Assn. officials say they have never before heard of a 
child targeting a parent during a judicial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Villa, a part-time court commissioner, is battling trial lawyer David W. 
Perkins for the Downey judgeship. Villa, 62, declined to comment on his son's 
campaign. But his wife, Jennie, said Villa has no plans to try to stop his son. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Villa's brother Robert, a campaign worker, said the matter is personal and 
does not reflect on his brother's ability to be a judge. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Villa noted that his brother met his legal obligations by paying child 
support until Richard Villa turned 21. 
</P>
<P>
"It really has nothing to do with whether he's qualified as a judge or not," 
Robert Villa said. "If he didn't make the child support payments, then fine. 
(But) he paid." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond paying child support, Leo Villa was under no obligation to seek out his 
son, Robert Villa said. 
</P>
<P>
Perkins said he is staying away from the matter of Villa versus Villa. The 
younger Villa said he called Perkins, told his story and offered to work for 
his campaign. Perkins declined the offer. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Villa said he plans to continue his campaign -- he has 200 more signs 
ready to post. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen of Richard Villa's signs, along with some campaign posters from 
other candidates, were confiscated because they were posted on public property 
in violation of a city ordinance, Assistant City Manager Ken Farfsing said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Villa was born to Valma E. Vose in Orange on Jan. 28, 1956. Leo Villa, 
then 27, had ended his relationship with her months before, shortly after he 
found out she was pregnant, said Vose, who now lives in Las Vegas. They had 
been dating for more than a year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1958, a Superior Court judge officially declared that Villa was Richard's 
father and ordered him to pay $60 a month child support. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Villa, then a sheriff's deputy, married Jennie Villa the next year and 
raised two children. He became a deputy district attorney in 1966, a job he 
held until he retired in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Richard said he remembers seeing his father only once. 
</P>
<P>
Their first meeting was at the 1958 hearing, when Richard was too young to 
remember. The second meeting was in 1975, when Leo Villa asked a judge to 
eliminate his child-support payments. Instead, the payments were reduced from 
$60 to $40 a month, noting that Richard still was attending college, according 
to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
"I actually walked down to him and shook his hand," Richard Villa said. "My 
only words to him have been, 'Hello. I'm Richard your son,' and that was it. 
</P>
<P>
"He just shook my hand. There was no response to the best of my recollection." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Villa acknowledges that years of hurt-turned-anger prompted his 
campaign. But he maintains the disclosure is relevant to the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"We all make mistakes, but Leo has never come to have any feelings about what 
he has done," Richard Villa said.

PROGRAM FOR FREE RIDES ON LATE BUSES CALLED A SUCCESS; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSIT: THE RTD SAYS IT GAVE AWAY 59,000 PASSENGER TRIPS LAST MONTH, FAR FEWER 
THAN IT HAD EXPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The RTD's new program of letting passengers ride free if their buses are more 
than 15 minutes late was declared a major success Wednesday by bus system 
officials who say they gave 59,000 free rides last month -- far fewer than they 
expected when they adopted the novel policy. 
</P>
<P>
"We carried in September close to 34 million passengers and we only gave close 
to 60,000 free rides," boasted Nikolas Patsaouras, board president of the 
Southern California Rapid Transit District. "That translates to 0.18 of 1% -- 
phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
Before the free-ride program began Sept. 1, the RTD predicted that drivers 
might be handing out up to $600,000 a month in free fares, based on the 
percentage of bus runs that are typically more than 15 minutes late in the 
countywide system. By contrast, only about $61,000 worth of the $1.10 fares was 
claimed by passengers complaining of tardiness last month. 
</P>
<P>
But it was unclear whether the lower-than-expected free-ride rate could be 
attributed to more timely buses or to simple lack of interest on the part of 
passengers who, when questioned in press interviews about the program, often 
seemed ignorant of it or unsure how to take advantage of it. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many buses, I don't know which one is late," said one confused 
passenger last month after the new policy went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, passengers who would normally pay cash are allowed to board 
free if the bus is late. Those with monthly passes are supposed to get the 
driver to punch a warranty card for end-of-the-month cash refunds. 
</P>
<P>
A bus stop survey taken early this summer indicated that about 2.5% of the 
system's daily runs were at least 15 minutes late, said RTD spokesman Greg 
Davy. But no new numbers were available to show whether that figure had 
improved last month. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Davy defended the claims of success made at a downtown press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"Nick's main point today is that the perception that RTD buses are always late 
is incorrect and he feels the first month of this program shows that," Davy 
said. "He's not saying no buses are late." 
</P>
<P>
The free rides are part of a major public relations campaign on the part of 
Patsaouras, who in July unveiled a Transit Rider Bill of Rights, guaranteeing 
RTD passengers good service and a safe journey. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone has been impressed. Veteran RTD Director Charles Storing 
criticized the free-ride proposal when it was first made and said Wednesday 
that he still doesn't think it's a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to see anybody have to wait for a bus," Storing said. "But there are 
just so many situations that cause this that I don't feel RTD should be 
punished for circumstances beyond its control." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the bus drivers union, which had initially expressed concerns 
about the new policy, was more favorable. 
</P>
<P>
"So far it's gone fairly well," said Goldy Norton, public relations 
representative of the United Transportation Union. "It has not to our knowledge 
had any great impact on our drivers." 
</P>
<P>
Patsaouras said the cost of the free-fares program -- which will be continued 
until the end of the year on a trial basis -- has been offset by ridership 
increases. Yet while ridership rose by about 60,000 between August and 
September of this year, it is only up about 30,000, or 2%, when compared with 
September of last year. And that, district planners say, is statistically 
insignificant, since the numbers are subject to a 10% margin of error.

DRUG WAR IS PUTTING PRESSURE ON TRIAL, DEFENSE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration's war on drugs is pressuring prosecutors to gain 
convictions at any cost against six men arrested in connection with the record 
cocaine seizure at a Sylmar warehouse, defense attorneys charged in final 
arguments as the case went to the jury Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a drug war going on in this country," attorney Marlene Gerdts told 
jurors in federal court in Los Angeles. "There is pressure put on prosecutors . 
. . to get a conviction. . . . There are a lot of careers at stake here." 
</P>
<P>
Government investigators view the trial as a landmark prosecution in the 
international war on drug trafficking, not only because of the amount of 
cocaine seized -- 21.4 tons -- but because the government sees the case as a 
rare opportunity to penetrate the transportation apparatus of the Colombian 
drug cartels. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has charged defendants with operating a family-run cocaine 
trafficking organization, which stockpiled tons of cocaine at a warehouse in 
the San Fernando Valley community of Sylmar. The cache was discovered during a 
raid 13 months ago by federal and local agents. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the six defendants are charged with conspiracy to possess with intent 
to distribute narcotics. They are: Carlos Tapia Ponce, 69, a former Mexican 
customs official; his son, Hector Tapia Anchondo, 38; two of Carlos Tapia's 
sons-in-law, James Romero McTague, 42, of El Paso, and Jose Ignacio Monroy, 37; 
and Fernando Castillon, 32. A sixth defendant, Miguel Chavez, 34, is charged 
with possession with intent to distribute cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants, who have been denied bail and incarcerated in the Metropolitan 
Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles, have declared their innocence. All 
face 10 years to life in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the defendants -- Carlos Tapia, McTague and Monroy -- told 
investigators shortly after their arrests that they were participating in 
cocaine trafficking, according to Drug Enforcement Administration reports filed 
with the court. Their attorneys, however, argued the DEA and local police used 
coercive tactics to gain the admissions. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the cocaine, several ledgers and notebooks were seized in Los 
Angeles and El Paso, where Hector Tapia owned a house which prosecutors 
referred to as "the hub of the organization." 
</P>
<P>
Government evidence -- which defense attorneys challenged as inconclusive -- 
alleged that Carlos Tapia's handwriting was found on notes attached to 
cocaine-loaded pallets and on ledgers found in the Sylmar warehouse. The 
government also alleged that his son's handwriting was found in a cocaine 
ledger recovered from McTague's briefcase and that his fingerprints and palm 
prints were found on ledgers recovered from his El Paso home. 
</P>
<P>
In her closing argument, Special Assistant U.S. Atty. Susan Bryant-Deason 
referred to Carlos Tapia as the cocaine organization's "overseer (and) 
patriarch." 
</P>
<P>
"Who would suspect that a 69-year-old man (was) the head of the largest 
(cocaine) transportation network that would ever be discovered?" Bryant-Deason 
asked jurors. 
</P>
<P>
But Tapia's lawyer, Joseph Abraham, said his client had no knowledge of what 
was in the Sylmar warehouse, even though he signed the lease and paid the rent. 
"The only reason he's here is because the warehouse was in his name," he told 
the jury. 
</P>
<P>
As for Tapia's son, Bryant-Deason said he "ran the entire operation out of his 
(El Paso) house. . . . He has a tally sheet that matches Los Angeles kilo for 
kilo." 
</P>
<P>
However, the son's lawyer, David Z. Chesnoff, said, "There's no evidence that 
(Hector Tapia) has been anywhere but on a ranch in Mexico" where he runs a 
cattle operation. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said far more than the much-publicized 21 tons had been shipped to 
Los Angeles, hidden aboard big-rig trucks traveling the nation's interstate 
highway system. In one three-month period preceding the seizure, investigators 
found that the warehouse had been a conduit for 77 tons of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
In the final analysis, said Bryant-Deason, the government had "a paper chain" 
of evidence that proved the six defendants conspired to transport dozens of 
tons of cocaine to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just cocaine cowboys, that's all they are," said Bryant-Deason. 
"They're greedy men. They're merchants of destruction (who) moved thousands of 
kilos across the country with no conscience." 
</P>
<P>
The jury is scheduled to begin its deliberations today.

JUDGE FREES PROSTITUTE WITH AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge who also chairs the county AIDS Commission on Tuesday dismissed a case 
against a prostitute who faced three years in prison for allegedly continuing 
to solicit sex for money after being told he tested positive for AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The case was the first filed in Los Angeles County, and believed to be the 
first in the state, under a 1988 law designed to stem the spread of the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Rand Schrader, acting on a defense request on behalf of Demitri 
Santangelo, 29, of Hollywood, granted the dismissal, the prosecutor said, after 
concluding that Municipal Judge Jessica Silvers failed to properly inform 
Santangelo when she sentenced him last May on a misdemeanor prostitution 
conviction that if he was arrested again for the same offense, he would be 
charged with a felony. 
</P>
<P>
Hours after Schrader dismissed the case, however, Silvers sentenced Santangelo 
to 222 days in County Jail for violating probation on prostitution and 
joy-riding convictions. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Vivian Davidson said she would appeal Schrader's ruling, but 
not on the basis of his position with the AIDS Commission. "I think he 
(Schrader) just made an erroneous call on the law," Davidson said.

GIFTS TO HORSE CENTER DOUBLE ITS CAPACITY

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County Humane Society shelter will nearly double its capacity to 
care for neglected horses, thanks to $20,000 in materials and labor donated by 
oil businesses. 
</P>
<P>
David Cohen, Texaco Inc. field engineer, said his company became involved this 
summer after the Humane Society impounded 100 animals from property in Piru 
Canyon rented from Texaco. 
</P>
<P>
The company had already made a cash donation to help care for the animals, 
Cohen said. But after a tour of the shelter, "we realized that this volunteer 
organization needed more than just cash." 
</P>
<P>
The 1 1/2-acre horse area adjoining the shelter at 402 Bryant St. in Ojai is 
being refurbished through the efforts of Texaco and seven other oil businesses. 
Shelter Director Jolene Hoffman 1935763812improved. 
</P>
<P>
The improvements include a new fence for the pasture and three corrals sturdy 
enough for stallions. 
</P>
<P>
The new fence, made of several hundred feet of heavy metal pipe welded 
together, would have been too expensive for the humane society to build, Cohen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"What they've done here is just gorgeous," Hoffman said. She added that the 
donated repair work not only improves shelter, it allows the humane society to 
pay for other projects. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations for the work began in June. After assessing the shelter's needs, 
Cohen designed the project and asked the company's area manager, Gerry Oviatt, 
for materials. Construction engineer Bob McClenny organized work crews, and 
McClain Oil Field Maintenance provided a truck and crew when the work began 
Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really been uplifting to see how many people care about what we're doing 
here," Hoffman said. JANET BERGAMO

OWNER TO REOPEN SPRING TO THE PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that he's retired and has time to keep a watchful eye over the litter bugs, 
a Santa Paula resident is reopening a natural spring water source on his 
property for free public use. 
</P>
<P>
Ozzie Osborn met with California Department of Transportation officials this 
week to make sure that a new pump and faucet he plans to install at the side of 
the Santa Paula-Ojai Road will not interfere with highway safety. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, the roadside water supply, which Osborn is building at his 
own expense, should be open by the new year. 
</P>
<P>
Ozzie and Rhoda Osborn bought the Spring Water Ranch in 1971 and he used his 
skills as a plumber to install pipes transporting natural, spring water from 
the source to the side of the road where passersby could more easily stop and 
fill their containers. 
</P>
<P>
Osborn said it didn't bother him that some people showed up with 40-gallon 
jugs, leaving other thirsty folks, often including Osborn himself, waiting in 
line. But when visitors started holding small parties in the nearby creek and 
littering the property, the Osborns decided to nip the problem at its source. 
</P>
<P>
So in August, 1987, they blocked the spring. 
</P>
<P>
The Osborns said the main reason they are reopening the spring is to provide 
free, healthy water for the area's older population. 
</P>
<P>
"Water is scarce and money is tight, especially for the oldies," Rhoda Osborn 
said. "Plus some of these people grew up drinking this water. They get 
accustomed to something and then they don't want a change forced on them." 
</P>
<P>
This isn't the first time that Ozzie Osborn, 70, no relation to the rock star 
with the same name, has played a Samaritan's role. 
</P>
<P>
Osborn received national attention last year when he adopted Grunt the Pig, an 
800-pound porker that had been abandoned in the Los Angeles area and almost 
beaten to death by some men who wanted to eat him. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, he's doing fine," Osborn said. "We just finished building a house and pool 
for all the pigs. We have about 20." MAJA RADEVICH

SCHOOL DISTRICT OKS DRIVER TRAINING FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Following in the footsteps of other Ventura County districts, Oxnard Union High 
School District officials Wednesday recommended charging students for its 
driver training program. 
</P>
<P>
Under the recommendation, the behind-the-wheel training program would be 
transferred from the regular curriculum to the school's adult school program. 
</P>
<P>
A fee of $130 will be assessed. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal will come before the board for a vote on Nov. 14. 
</P>
<P>
The six-school Oxnard district, along with districts around the state and the 
county, was forced to suspend driver training after Gov. George Deukmejian cut 
$21.2 million for the program from the 1990-91 budget. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, boards from the Ventura Unified and Conejo Unified school 
districts have already approved fees for driver training. Ventura students who 
take the course will have to pay $115, while the Conejo district is offering 
the course for $120. 
</P>
<P>
In Oxnard, district officials said they are instituting the program on a pilot 
basis and will evaluate it in June, 1991, Assistant Supt. Gary Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
The classroom portion of the program, commonly referred to as driver's 
education, will continue to be offered, district officials said. ADRIANNE

MAN PLEADS GUILTY IN HIT-AND-RUN DEATH

<TEXT>
<P>
A Camarillo man has pleaded guilty in Ventura County Superior Court to 
vehicular manslaughter in the hit-and-run death of a Simi Valley assistant city 
planner in June. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Oseguera, 28, faces up to 12 years in state prison after pleading guilty 
on Tuesday to charges of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and 
felony hit-and-run in the accident that killed Steven Sugimoto, 28, west of 
Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Sugimoto was bicycling west along the paved shoulder of California 118 about 
4:15 p.m. June 10 when Oseguera approached from the rear in a 1979 Oldsmobile 
Cutlass, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Kim George Gibbons. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told investigators that Oseguera was speeding and passing cars on the 
right when he slammed into Sugimoto, throwing him to the ground, Gibbons said. 
Sugimoto suffered massive head and internal injuries and died later at Pleasant 
Valley Hospital, Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
Oseguera sped up after the impact and drove away, and police chased him for 5 
1/2 miles to Lewis Road in Somis, where a passenger in his car, 30-year-old 
David Rojas of Oxnard, grabbed the wheel and persuaded him to stop, Gibbons 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tests taken nearly two hours afterward showed that Oseguera had a blood-alcohol 
content of 0.17%, more than twice the legal 0.08% limit, Gibbons said. But he 
said there was no evidence that Oseguera had used drugs, despite his admission 
to police that he had injected heroin an hour before the accident. MACK REED

PLANS MADE TO TURN YULE TREES TO CHIPS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Before Christmas trees are even purchased, Ventura County is working on a plan 
to recycle them into wood chips that can be used in landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping that each city in the county will have two to three drop-off 
locations," said Victoria Hand, manager of the county's recycling division. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan -- the first countywide recycling program -- trees will either 
be picked up at curbsides and taken to a drop-off location at a city or county 
park, or residents will take their Christmas trees to drop-off locations, Hand 
said. A grinding machine will be on the site. "We don't want to transport the 
trees or the chips all over the county." 
</P>
<P>
The chips could be used for landscaping at the park, or a tree owner could take 
home a bag of chips after his tree has been ground up. 
</P>
<P>
"If we do get curbside pickups, we will have to make sure all the metal is off 
of the tree, such as metal tree stakes. Those stakes would ruin the grinders," 
Hand said. Hand will be asking for donations to get the project going. 
</P>
<P>
Using California Christmas Tree Growers Assn. figures, Hand estimates that 
about 90,000 Christmas trees will be purchased in Ventura County. At an average 
of 20 pounds per tree, the program would produce about 900 tons of chips. GERRY

Ventura County Grand Jury Foreman Lyle Wray announced Wednesday that the jury 
is not investigating Thousand Oaks' plans to develop the former Jungleland 
site. 
</P>
<P>
Wray said in a written statement that the jury "feels some members of the 
Thousand Oaks community, in an attempt to influence public opinion about the 
Jungleland project, may have given residents of the city of Thousand Oaks the 
impression that such an investigation was being conducted." 
</P>
<P>
Wray declined to elaborate on his statement or name the source of the 
information. 
</P>
<P>
A Thousand Oaks group has acknowledged that it distributed copies of a form 
letter urging citizens to sign it and send it to the grand jury. The letter 
requested an investigation of the city's handling of the $63-million project. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Booker, a spokesman for the Committee for Government by the People and for 
the People, which opposes construction of a civic center and arts auditorium at 
the former wild animal park, claimed that more than 200 letters were sent to 
the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
The committee is collecting signatures with the aim of placing a Jungleland 
measure on the ballot in a special election. 
</P>
<P>
Wray, in his statement, said he refused to allow the grand jury to get involved 
in a political campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Some city officials, including Mayor Alex Fiore, have been critical of the 
Committee for Government's tactics in its attempt to stop the Jungleland 
project. PSYCHE PASCUAL

CANDIDATES FOCUS ON BUDGET, GANGS

<TEXT>
<P>
Maintaining economic stability, deterring gang and drug activity and a regional 
mall were the primary topics Tuesday night at a forum for candidates running 
for two council seats and the mayor's post in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Greg Stratton, who is seeking his third term in the Nov. 6 election, said 
the city's biggest challenge will be to maintain and improve city services in 
the face of severe state budget cuts and the slowdown of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"The state budget crisis is trickling down to us very, very quickly," Stratton 
said. "We are going to need leadership to continue the policy of balancing our 
city budget and squeezing everything we can out of the money we have to provide 
the level of services we have grown accustomed to." 
</P>
<P>
Stratton's only challenger, Alfred J. Wilson, a retired Los Angeles bus driver, 
said the city's main priority should be deterring gang and drug activities 
among its youth. 
</P>
<P>
Several council candidates who participated in the question and answer session 
in the City Council Chambers agreed with Wilson that the city should help the 
Police Department expand its anti-drug programs in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, candidate John Etter criticized the current council for agreeing to 
lend more than $400,000 to Melvin Simon &amp; Associates, the developer 
proposing to build a shopping mall in the city. The loan, approved last week, 
is intended to cover the cost of completing the environmental impact report and 
other planning documentation associated with the project. 
</P>
<P>
Etter said a reimbursement agreement should have been drawn up before the loan 
was made. 
</P>
<P>
"That's absolutely poor business management," Etter said, adding that he was 
not opposed to the mall but rather was concerned that the developer was 
demanding too much financial assistance from the city. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ann Rock, who is seeking her third term, defended the council's 
action. 
</P>
<P>
"Melvin Simon doesn't have carte blanche," Rock said. "We will be reimbursed." 
Rock said the firm has a reputation for being one of the largest developers of 
shopping malls in the country and "we can count on their word." 
</P>
<P>
Other council candidates participating in Tuesday night's forum included Dave 
McCormick, Harold Lawrence Fick, Judy Mikels, Kenneth Wenning and Sandi Webb. 
Candidate Marilyn Maurer did not attend. 
</P>

Simi Valley City Councilwoman Vicky Howard's term expires in November. She is 
running for a county supervisor seat. CARLOS V. LOZANO

CARSON QB WALSH IS ON A RECORD-BREAKING PACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ROB FERNAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carson High's John Walsh is on pace to break the state record for passing yards 
in a season, but so far in 1990 he ranks second among California's prep 
quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Oliver, a sophomore from Monta Vista High in Cupertino, leads the state 
with 2,416 yards and 28 touchdowns passing in seven games. Walsh has 1,995 
yards and 22 TDs in six games. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, while Walsh was throwing for 311 yards and a Carson-record six 
touchdowns in a 48-7 victory over Narbonne, Oliver was outperforming him with 
398 yards and seven TDs in a 55-33 victory over Homestead of Cupertino. 
</P>
<P>
Reportedly, Monta Vista operates a wide-open, run-and-shoot offense, with 
Oliver lined up in a shotgun formation on every play. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody plays defense in that league," said Mark Tennis, editor of Cal-Hi 
Sports. 
</P>
<P>
Monta Vista, though, isn't very good. The team is 2-4-1 and isn't expected to 
reach the Central Coast Section playoffs. That means Walsh will probably play 
in more games, depending on how far Carson gets in the L.A. City Section 4-A 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The state and City records for most passing yards and touchdowns in a season 
were set last year by Santiago Alvarez of 3-A champion Franklin. Alvarez became 
the first player in state history to pass for more than 4,000 yards and 50 
touchdowns with 4,019 yards and 52 TDs in leading Franklin to a 13-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, at his current pace, will pass for 4,300 yards and 48 TDs if Carson 
plays 13 games by reaching the City 4-A final. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, the previous state yardage record was held by former Carson 
quarterback Perry Klein, who passed for 3,899 yards during his junior season at 
Palisades in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Klein and Walsh are coached privately by former San Jose State quarterback 
Steve Clarkson, a former assistant coach at Palisades and Carson who helped 
develop the double-wing, spread pass offense at each school. 
</P>
<P>
Although overshadowed by Walsh's passing exploits, the Carson defense has 
quietly enjoyed an outstanding season. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts rank second in the South Bay in team defense, allowing an average of 
162.3 yards a game, and lead the area with 18 interceptions. In last week's 
victory over Narbonne, Carson allowed 41 yards and cornerback Shawn Parnell 
tied a school record with three interceptions, giving him six on the season. 
</P>
<P>
All-City cornerback Clayvand Thomas, playing in his first game since suffering 
a broken kneecap in an off-season car accident, had four tackles. Coach Gene 
Vollnogle said Thomas might start Friday afternoon, when the Colts face 
Crenshaw in a rare game at Carson. The Colts' home field has a small seating 
capacity and no lights. 
</P>
<P>
Julius Coleman, the Palos Verdes basketball player who has been advised by 
doctors not to participate in physical activity because of a possible heart 
condition, is undergoing more tests this week. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman's father, also named Julius, said his son is being tested at Daniel 
Freeman Hospital in Inglewood by Dr. Michael Mellman, a doctor of internal 
medicine who works with the Lakers and Dodgers. Mellman treated Hank Gathers 
after the late Loyola Marymount basketball player's first fainting episode last 
season. Mellman also cleared Dodger outfielder Kal Daniels last spring after it 
was discovered that Daniels had an enlarged heart. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman, a 5-foot-10 junior guard who was named to the All-Bay League team last 
season, has not engaged in any physical activity since he passed out at a 
school dance Sept. 7. According to a cardiologist who treated Coleman at Little 
Company of Mary Hospital in Torrance, Coleman's fainting episode is a symptom 
of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy -- a thickening of the heart wall that could 
cause sudden death in a person participating in vigorous exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman's father said the tests conducted on his son will determine the size of 
the heart and thickness of the blood vessels. He said results should be known 
in a week or two. 
</P>
<P>
If there was an award given for the most cautious football coach in the South 
Bay, Leo Hand of Serra would be our choice. 
</P>
<P>
His team is 5-0, owns a 19-game winning streak and is ranked No. 1 in the 
CIF-Southern Section Division VII sportswriters' poll. Yet every opponent is a 
world-beater in Hands' eyes, regardless of its comparative strength. 
</P>
<P>
Here is what Hand said before Serra met St. Monica last week: "We scouted St. 
Monica and I think they're going to be a very tough opponent. That could end 
the winning streak right there." 
</P>
<P>
Serra won easily, 38-14. 
</P>
<P>
Now Hand is extolling the talents of Verbum Dei, which is 2-0 in the Camino 
Real League but is 2-5 overall and the only team to lose to Inglewood in three 
seasons. Serra faces Verbum Dei in its final league game Nov. 10. 
</P>
<P>
"Verb is very tough," Hand said. "They throw the ball real well, and we have to 
be good (to beat them)." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Hand came up with what might be the most ridiculous comment of the 
season: "I just take it one game at a time. I don't think about the playoffs. I 
don't even know that we'll be in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Let us say it for you, coach. Serra will be in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Don't count on it. 
</P>
<P>
That's our reaction to reports that the Palos Verdes school district is 
considering dropping spring sports as a cost-cutting measure. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the district decides to eliminate coaches' stipends, you can bet that 
booster clubs and parents will dig into their pockets to keep the teams from 
folding. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, the district is bringing to light the alarming need to carry 
through on plans to close Miraleste and consolidate high school operations at 
Rolling Hills and Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
There simply are not enough students in the district to finance or warrant 
having three high schools, regardless of what the good-intentioned parents on 
the east side of the peninsula believe. 
</P>
<P>
Notes

Get well: Former North Torrance football Coach Don Bohannon is recuperating at 
home after spending more than two weeks in the hospital because of a viral lung 
infection. Bohannon, a teacher at South Torrance, has not worked since school 
started in September. . . . Torrance has overtaken Fillmore as the No. 1 team 
in the CIF-Southern Section Division VIII football poll.

<P>
REFEREES: A GAME IN THE LIFE OF A FOOTBALL QUINTET PROVIDES A LOOK AT THE 
INTERACTION AMONG THE MEN IN STRIPED SHIRTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The receiver dives fully extended along the sideline and comes up with the ball 
at the goal line. Catch or trap? In or out of bounds? Touchdown or first down? 
</P>
<P>
Correct answers lie in teamwork and perfect coverage -- by the officials. 
</P>
<P>
This play occurred last Thursday night in a Marmonte League football game 
between Thousand Oaks and Camarillo highs. Field judge Joe Garces dashed up the 
sideline a few yards behind the receiver, Jeff Watts of Thousand Oaks. Back 
judge Bob Barrett hustled to the goal line between the hash marks. 
</P>
<P>
From his vantage, Garces saw Watts' arms slip under the ball for a catch less 
than a yard inbounds. From his angle, Barrett ascertained that Watts had 
crossed the goal line. The officials momentarily made eye contact, then their 
arms shot skyward: Touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
To most fans attending the game (won by host Thousand Oaks, 28-7), the five-man 
officiating crew was barely noticeable. And that is exactly the way the 
officials prefer it. But numerous details, many almost imperceptible, 
contributed to a job well-done. 
</P>
<P>
Not that anyone told them they had called a good game: Officiating is the wrong 
racket in which to find strokes. The work is thankless, yet it can be richly 
rewarding. Officiating enables grown men to participate in a kids' game. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got the best seat in the house," Barrett said. "A good official is a 
football fan. You have to love the game." 
</P>
<P>
Lots of people enjoy football. Few stuff their pockets full of yellow flags, 
don a striped shirt and take the field. 
</P>
<P>
How do high school officials operate? And what makes an effective crew? 
</P>
<P>
To gain insight, an evening was spent running with the zebras. 
</P>
<P>
In the dressing room an hour before the game, referee and crew chief John 
Stoney leads a painstaking discussion of officiating mechanics and unusual 
situations. They might whistle while they work, but officials dread being 
caught unprepared. Reviewing obscure rules, they sound like fraternity brothers 
cramming for an exam. 
</P>
<P>
And a fraternity it is. Each official -- Stoney, Barrett, Garces, umpire Bob 
Guillen and head linesman Jerry Nelson -- has at least 20 years experience in 
the Channel Coast Officials Assn., which supplies high school officials to 
games in all sports from Calabasas to Santa Barbara. The association also 
supplies college officials to the Western State and Western Football 
conferences. 
</P>
<P>
Officiating, of course, is not a primary source of income -- a high school game 
pays $45. Stoney is athletic director at San Marcos High; Guillen is a corn 
chips salesman; Garces is a civil service administrator at the Point Mugu naval 
station; Nelson is a teacher at the Camp Kilpatrick school for juvenile 
offenders in Malibu; Barrett owns a stationery store. 
</P>
<P>
Drawn from various walks of life, they are kindred spirits. While dressing 
Thursday, they offer friendly tips to the crew that had just completed the 
junior-varsity game and remind one another about the association's upcoming 
barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
"Officials are supportive of one another," Nelson said. "We take tests, we 
study the rules. But the primary way we learn is by watching fellow officials." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, both coaches informed Stoney and Guillen of trick plays the teams 
might use -- reverses, double reverses, halfback passes, fake punts and the 
like. Over a coach's boisterous speech before the Camarillo team in the 
adjoining locker room, Stoney relays the information to the rest of his crew, 
saying: "We don't want to get fooled by weird stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Before they head for the field, Guillen says, "Do we have a coin, Mr. Stoney?" 
The referee taps his pocket, nods and says, "Let's go." 
</P>
<P>
The officials are greeted cordially by team captains during the coin flip, but 
less than two minutes into the game smiles turn to frowns. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo runs a play-action pass down the left sideline, directly in front of 
the Scorpion bench. As the pass sails out of bounds and out of reach, a 
Thousand Oaks defensive back unloads on the receiver. 
</P>
<P>
No flag is thrown; the pass was judged uncatchable by Nelson and Barrett, the 
officials closest to the play. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo fans and coaches howl in disbelief. A Camarillo assistant angrily 
gestures, as if to throw a flag himself. "Where's the flag?" he demands. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson replies, "We've got two guys watching the play," and turns away. End of 
discussion. Later, Nelson explains that an official should not prolong a 
dispute: "I just said enough to relax the situation. You don't want to say 
antagonizing things. You don't ignore coaches, but we don't coach, we don't 
hold clinics, we just call the game." 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, Camarillo punts. Two Thousand Oaks players mildly lean 
into the punter after the ball is kicked. The punter, McLane Hansen, rolls on 
the field, turns up his palms and looks to Stoney in dismay. The referee slowly 
shakes his head -- the act is not convincing. 
</P>
<P>
On the ensuing possession, Thousand Oaks executes a screen pass to fullback 
Greg Buchanan, who dashes 26 yards down the right sideline in front of the 
Lancer bench. 
</P>
<P>
Garces spots a clip, however, and throws a flag. Most of the gain is nullified. 
Thousand Oaks coaches react as if someone had robbed their homes. "No way you 
can call that a clip," Coach Bob Richards tells Garces. "Hey, he turned on him. 
C'mon." 
</P>
<P>
Garces picks up the flag without a word. Later, he smiles and says, "(The 
blocker) pulled back as if he didn't touch him. But he did." 
</P>
<P>
Each official has a predetermined role in enforcing the penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Garces stands at the point of the infraction. Barrett stands where the ball 
should be placed after the penalty is marked off. Nelson makes sure the chains 
are set properly and that the down marker has not changed. 
</P>
<P>
Guillen takes the ball and steps off the yardage. Stoney signals that a clip 
has been called, and, once the chains are set, starts the clock by making a 
windmill motion with his arms. 
</P>
<P>
When Stoney informs the Camarillo team captain of the clip, he makes it clear 
that the team ought to accept the penalty. "We don't let him mess up on 
accepting or refusing an obvious penalty," Stoney says. "We say, 'You want 
this.' " 
</P>
<P>
Several points emphasized in the pregame discussion also come into play in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
Because Camarillo runs a wishbone that utilizes fake handoffs, Stoney reminded 
the crew to make certain a back is carrying the ball before blowing a whistle 
when he is tackled. "Be slow with the whistles," he warned. 
</P>
<P>
On a dive up the middle, Scorpion fullback Tag Johnson is hit and appears to go 
down. He barely keeps his feet by using his free hand to crawl, however, and 
gains an additional four yards. No whistles are heard until Johnson is indeed 
tackled. 
</P>
<P>
Also, a primary duty of flank officials -- Nelson and Garces, in this case -- 
is to mark the forward progress of ballcarriers. Stationed near the sideline, 
they have a better angle than the other three officials, who stand near the 
middle of the field. This is especially crucial on running plays near the goal 
line, when the field judge or head linesman should be the first to signal 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks scores on a five-yard run by Cory Bowen directly at the feet of 
Guillen, stationed behind the defensive line, but Guillen waits until Nelson 
raises his arms before signaling touchdown himself. 
</P>
<P>
With less than two minutes to play in the half, Thousand Oaks employs a 
hurry-up offense. Although the players move frantically to conserve precious 
seconds, the officials proceed methodically. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is anything I've learned from the college level, it's to slow down 
our mechanics," Barrett had said during the pregame discussion. "A team might 
be in a speed-up offense, but we still control the tempo, we can't get caught 
up in their rush." 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers need only 55 seconds to score, and they take a 21-7 lead after the 
point-after kick curls inches inside the left upright. Barrett, standing 
directly beneath the upright, watches the ball pass through, then steps forward 
with his arms raised. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire ball must pass entirely inside the upright," he explained later. 
</P>
<P>
The teams leave the field for halftime and Barrett, who as back judge is in 
charge of the game clock, tells the clock operator to begin running off 15 
minutes -- the duration of halftime. When the clock reaches zero, an additional 
three minutes tick off to allow the teams to warm up for the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't care if (the teams) actually warm up," Stoney said. "That's the 
coach's responsibility. But if a kid gets hurt on the first play, they can't 
say we didn't give them time to warm up." 
</P>
<P>
Emotions heat up in the third quarter as Camarillo tries in vain to score. Eric 
Bateman of Camarillo and David Acosta of Thousand Oaks continue hitting after a 
play is blown dead. They shove each other and words are exchanged. From 10 
yards away, Guillen screams to them, "Hey, hey," the players part and Guillen 
yells, "Thank you." 
</P>
<P>
He could have been speaking for the entire crew. The game is remarkably smooth 
from an officiating standpoint. Only three penalties are called -- the one for 
clipping and two for false starts by offensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
Crew members have 109 years of officiating experience among them, yet none has 
been involved in a penalty-free game. As high school football goes, this 
evening has been easy. 
</P>
<P>
The clock expires and Stoney holds up the ball to indicate the game is over. 
The officials leave the field in the same manner that they arrived -- together 
and without dallying. They came, they called, they called it a night.

TODD PRESTON HAS FOUND HIS NICHE LEADING WESTLAKE'S POTENT OFFENSE; NOW COLLEGE 
SCOUTS ARE FINDING HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

his mother Sue. "Were just a simple, blue-collar family,"says dad., TIMES STAFF

<TEXT>
<P>
At Westlake High, the football team sometimes shares its practice field with 
cheerleaders and the star tight end drives a Porsche. The school, neatly tucked 
into the hills along Lakeview Canyon Road, just looks too nice for football. 
</P>
<P>
BMWs are as common as textbooks. Boys aspire to be corporate lawyers and girls 
look as if they just walked off the cover of Teen magazine. 
</P>
<P>
A more mellow sport than football, such as golf, seems to fit this student body 
to a tee. In fact, the Westlake boys' golf team has finished among the top five 
Southern Section teams in five of the past six years. 
</P>
<P>
But the football team has begun to change perceptions. And it can thank Todd 
Preston, a shy quarterback who hails from a blue-collar family that lives in a 
modest, three-bedroom home. 
</P>
<P>
At school, Preston looks as out of place as his pickup truck, which has a 
cracked windshield and is missing a wiper. 
</P>
<P>
He's Opie Taylor in shoulder pads. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt he has ever offended anybody," his mother Sue said, "or that he ever 
will." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Preston is offensive on a football field. At 6-foot-3 and 180 pounds, he 
terrorizes defenses with an arm that can hurl a football 60 yards, and he runs 
the 40-yard sprint in 4.7 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"You really don't stop him," Camarillo Coach Carl Thompson said. "You can't 
stop him. You just hope to maybe slow him a little." 
</P>
<P>
Preston, a senior, has not been slowed much. He has thrown for a school-record 
4,685 yards in two-plus seasons and needs 14 yards against Simi Valley on 
Friday to move ahead of Royal's Ken Lutz (4,698) and into the No. 2 slot in 
Ventura County. It can be safely said that Preston will not surpass Tim 
Gutierrez of Santa Clara, who threw for 7,272 yards from 1987-89. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 12, with UCLA offensive coordinator Homer Smith in attendance, Preston 
threw for a school-record 327 yards against Channel Islands. A week later, USC 
quarterbacks coach Ray Dorr spent several hours in the Westlake coaches' office 
watching game film of Preston. Westlake is 7-0 -- the school's best start -- 
and is ranked No. 1 in The Times' Valley poll. 
</P>
<P>
The kid who throws footballs at trees in his parents' yard has become one of 
the hottest Division I quarterback prospects on the West Coast. He punts for an 
average of more than 40 yards, and Coach Jim Benkert says that Preston would be 
the team's best defensive back if he played that position. 
</P>
<P>
"He definitely makes us go," Benkert said. "If you take him away, we're an 
entirely different team. Obviously, one that isn't as talented, either." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Preston remains humble, and strolls through Westlake's fashion world 
wearing unlaced high-tops, a baseball cap, and a backpack slung over one 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
He looks as if he should be delivering groceries, not tight spirals. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Preston was a fullback, and a happy one. He never wanted to be a 
quarterback but his father Mike pushed him behind the center in the eighth 
grade. 
</P>
<P>
"I hated it," Todd said. "I liked to run with the ball, and all I did at 
quarterback was hand the ball off." 
</P>
<P>
Within two years, Preston was talented enough to challenge senior Chris Edwards 
for the right to run the Delaware Wing T offense. George Contreras, Westlake's 
coach at the time, alternated the two players during Westlake's first game, a 
17-14 loss to Buena. Preston started every game thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
"I took a lot of heat for that," Contreras said. "But it really didn't bother 
me. I knew we were going with the best kid that we had." 
</P>
<P>
Preston's inconsistency was frustrating. But it was expected of a sophomore. 
"He had good games, then he'd play just terrible," Contreras said. 
</P>
<P>
Preston ran behind a small and struggling offensive line, but he was as tough 
as a $2 steak. Defenses pounded him, then trampled him into the turf. Thousand 
Oaks, traditionally a hard-hitting team, thumped Preston during a 24-6 win. 
</P>
<P>
"He was heading out of bounds once and took just a tremendous shot," Contreras 
said. "I didn't think he was going to get up, but he got right up and jogged to 
the huddle." 
</P>
<P>
Preston finished the season with 1,167 passing yards, the third-highest total 
in school history, on a team that won only two of 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
Contreras retired at season's end, and Benkert was hired. Benkert, an assistant 
at Crespi, brought along Darryl Smith to coach Preston. Smith, a former 
receiver at Eastern Kentucky, is the father of Crespi quarterback Cody Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"Todd's arm impressed me right away, but the most important thing that 
impressed me was his ability to be coached," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
And Preston, lacking proper fundamentals, needed plenty of that. Thus began a 
two-year relationship that involved summer sessions with Cody and Darryl, three 
hours a day, five days a week. The biggest hurdle, according to Darryl, was 
breaking Preston's habit of throwing into crowded secondaries. 
</P>
<P>
"Like any young quarterback, he forced things," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
That was evident in Preston's statistics. He completed 44.8% of his passes and 
threw 30 interceptions during his first two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was first and 10 at our own 20 and we called a pass play, 'Foom!' that 
ball was thrown whether the receiver was open or not," Benkert said. "He was a 
great athlete, and he ran the offense well, but he forced the pass too much." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Preston threw for a school-record 2,014 yards last season when he 
was named the Marmonte League's most valuable player and led the Warriors to 
their first playoff berth since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
During a 24-20 upset of second-seeded Arcadia in the first round of the 
Division II playoffs, Preston showed he had come of age. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake trailed, 20-17, with less than two minutes remaining and Benkert 
wasn't sure which Preston was in the huddle. Was it the poised one? Or the one 
who panicked and had thrown interceptions during last-minute drives in losses 
to Ventura and Buena? 
</P>
<P>
"I had tried to do too much," Preston said. "I had tried to win games when I 
didn't have to." 
</P>
<P>
But Preston, who had completed only four of 15 passes against Arcadia, suddenly 
discovered patience. He drove Westlake toward Arcadia's end zone, completing 
five of seven passes, including two on fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
"We actually drove the football," Benkert said. "And I don't think he threw one 
pass more than 12 yards. He didn't try to get it all on one play." 
</P>
<P>
The clincher was a nine-yard strike to Erik Holcomb with 24 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"Todd was becoming a very good quarterback," Benkert said. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Preston added 15 pounds and improved his knowledge of Westlake's 
offense. He reads defenses well enough to call audibles, which he did twice for 
touchdowns in a come-from-behind, 36-28 win over Agoura on Sept. 27. 
</P>
<P>
Preston also has been the beneficiary of an overachieving offensive line that 
includes Gregg Crisp, Matt Volk, Jim Moffat, James Gillespie and Dave 
Russomanno. Reuben Allen, a senior who has rushed for 838 yards, has provided 
the spark for a running game that complements the passing attack -- a luxury 
Preston did not have last year. 
</P>
<P>
In his position of leadership, Preston has thrived under pressure this season. 
With Westlake and Ventura tied, 21-21, early in the fourth quarter, he 
completed three of four passes, the last a six-yard lob to tight end Dave 
Monheim that gave the Warriors a 28-21 win. 
</P>
<P>
The following week, Westlake trailed Agoura, 28-21, with 8 minutes 31 seconds 
left. Agoura, having helplessly watched Preston complete his first six passes 
and 11 of 13 for 211 yards, dropped eight defenders off the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Westlake introduced Allen, who carried the ball on six of Westlake's next 
seven plays for 111 yards and two touchdowns that keyed a 36-28 win. Preston 
finished 12 of 16 for 220 yards and three touchdowns. Twice he called audibles 
that resulted in touchdowns, on a 15-yard scoring pass to Holcomb and a 77-yard 
toss to Seamus Gibbons. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the kids afterward that a loss just never entered my mind," Benkert 
said. "Holcomb was standing in the back of the room and said, 'It never entered 
ours, either, coach.' " 
</P>
<P>
Benkert smiled. "That has a lot to do with Todd's confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Preston's pressure cooker also simmers in other athletic endeavors. Last 
spring, as a third baseman on Westlake's 28-2 baseball team, he batted just 
.205 but came up with four game-winning hits in late innings. And he saved both 
of his home runs for the Southern Section 5-A Division playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Preston shrugs. "I just don't like to let the team down." 
</P>
<P>
Preston has not disappointed many this season. He has completed 63% of his 
passes (99 of 156) for 1,504 yards, the second-best output in the Southern 
Section, and 12 touchdowns. He has thrown five interceptions, compared to 12 at 
this time a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel as if I'm going to have a good game every time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His passing-efficiency rating, using the NCAA's calculations, is 162.95, which 
ranks well ahead of highly regarded Bryan Martin of Granada Hills (118.62). 
Martin was considered, by the same magazines that neglected to mention Preston, 
as the area's finest prospect. 
</P>
<P>
But recruiters are staying on the 101 Freeway a little longer and getting off 
at Westlake Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"Not that Martin doesn't deserve it, because he's a very good quarterback," 
Benkert said. "But if Todd played at Granada Hills, he'd be in every one of 
those magazines because of what Granada Hills has built over the years." 
</P>
<P>
Preston doesn't worry about the lack of recognition. He just keeps passing and 
passing. And passing. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that Todd, no matter what, will get the ball to someone," said 
Monheim, who has caught 28 passes for 378 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbons, a three-year starter who has set a school record with 83 career 
receptions, has benefited fromPreston's development.Senior Todd Preston,

JACK SMITH: FREEDOM OF SPEECH: NOT CARTE BLANCHE FOR COLUMNISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In writing about words that I would not use in this newspaper (even if the 
paper were to allow them) I seem to have outraged at least one reader. 
</P>
<P>
John Kane of Rancho Palos Verdes writes that he was "quite disappointed" in me. 
"It seems to me that freedom of speech means freedom of speech, and that 
reporters and columnists should support it unhesitatingly and without any 
reservations or pussy-footing around for fear of hurting someone's feelings." 
</P>
<P>
I had written to commend Chicago columnist Mike Royko for demolishing "a bad 
word dictionary" published by the Multicultural Management Program at the 
University of Missouri School of Journalism. 
</P>
<P>
The dictionary listed words its authors considered offensive to various groups 
or individuals, and urged reporters and editors to avoid them. Among them were 
fried chicken (allegedly offensive to blacks); Dutch treat (allegedly offensive 
to the Dutch); and ugh (allegedly offensive to American Indians). 
</P>
<P>
Royko wrote: "Fried chicken, fried chicken, fried chicken. I said it and I'm 
glad. Sue me." 
</P>
<P>
I wrote that I agreed with the authors of the proscriptive list that newspapers 
must be careful not to use words that are offensive for reasons of race, gender 
or physical disability, but the list was loaded with harmless slang. 
</P>
<P>
However, I noted that Royko had used several words, quoting from the list, that 
I would not use. 
</P>
<P>
It was evidently this restraint that annoyed Kane. "Either we have freedom of 
speech or we do not," he said. "For any newspaper and any writer to agree that 
any pre-censorship is correct appalls me beyond belief. It seems to me that 
once we start saying 'You can say what you wish except for . . . ,' we are in 
serious trouble." 
</P>
<P>
When one is quoting taboo words in a scholarly paper, and not in their 
offensive context, surely one is excused for using them. However, a newspaper 
column can hardly be considered a scholarly paper, so I am not protected by 
that academic license. 
</P>
<P>
In the first place, I am restrained by The Times stylebook, which itself 
proscribes various words and phrases, especially those referring pejoratively 
to ethnic groups. While I do not think the stylebook's rules are perfect, I do 
not consider them onerous. It is hardly censorious for a newspaper to avoid 
words that are notoriously offensive to blacks, Latinos or Asians, for example. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, styles change, and a newspaper must keep up with changes in 
society's moral values. When I came to work at The Times we could not use the 
word rape. The proper euphemism was criminal attack. Consequently, we were 
obliged to write such fatuous sentences as "He kicked her down the stairs and 
beat her with a stick but he did not criminally attack her." 
</P>
<P>
We could not use the word abortion, improbable as that may seem to today's 
readers. The acceptable euphemism was "illegal surgery." Thus, if a woman had 
suffered an abortion, and that fact became pertinent to a criminal trial, we 
were allowed to say only that she had had "illegal surgery," though the word 
abortion was used in court and was legally privileged. Of course, we could not 
use the word condom nor even suggest that such things existed. There was no 
acceptable euphemism for condom. The other day we had a story about the failure 
of the networks to accept condom advertising, and the word was used in the 
headline. 
</P>
<P>
Having suffered such grotesque restrictions in the past, I might find today's 
equally oppressive. However, the euphemisms required for abortion and rape were 
not contrived to protect any minority group, but simply to appease the 
Victorian attitudes of our subscribers. The effect of those evasions was to 
suggest that such practices did not exist. 
</P>
<P>
I do not see the newspaper's desire to avoid inflammatory and painful epithets 
as censorship. If there were no such rules I'm sure I would impose them on 
myself. In fact, I observe, in general, higher standards of taste than those 
observed in the paper at large. 
</P>
<P>
I do not feel censored. I rarely concern myself with politics, but if I were to 
call our President a wimp, I'm sure that word would not be cut by our editors, 
though it reflected an entirely personal and prejudiced judgment. Just to prove 
the point I'll say it. Our President is a wimp. 
</P>
<P>
However, I have no doubt that my calling the President a wimp will provoke 
dozens of letters from outraged Republicans advising me to leave politics alone 
and stick to what I know about, like my dog. Many of them will suggest that I 
ought to be censored if I can't keep my opinions to myself. 
</P>
<P>
I might have called the President a WASP, which he surely is. But our stylebook 
is inconclusive on WASP. It says, "May be pejorative." 
</P>
<P>
Better not take a chance. I'll just stick with wimp.

MAGAZINES: TARNISHED VIEW OF CALIFORNIA IN FORBES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They're variations of the chicken-egg question we're likely to hear much more 
frequently as the country sinks into recession: which comes first, employers or 
jobs; prosperity or "livability?" 
</P>
<P>
In its Oct. 29 cover story, Forbes magazine asks "Is the Golden State Losing 
It?" The article argues that, indeed, California is casually kissing off its 
$150-billion-a-year manufacturing industry. Preoccupied with more and more 
foolish regulatory measures, the state's citizens and lawmakers remain 
oblivious to the increasing numbers of manufacturers who are packing up and 
heading north or east or to the Southern states, the article's authors assert. 
</P>
<P>
"Basking in the glow from decades of easy growth, Californians lost sight of 
the fact that in a free enterprise system, companies are not only free to come 
but also free to go," the article says. "They are going because the drawbacks 
of doing business in California are fast overwhelming the advantages of doing 
business there. The cost curve has finally overtaken the advantage curve." 
</P>
<P>
Those costs include housing that is beyond the reach of 82% of U.S. households 
or, alternatively, long commutes that translate into increased absenteeism; 
workers compensation rates that are as much as 50% higher than in other states; 
higher construction expenses; and schools that rank 49th among states for the 
ratio of students to teachers. 
</P>
<P>
But the real villain, in these authors' view, is California's "bewildering 
array of environmental regulations and anti-growth propositions." 
</P>
<P>
The economic impact of increased environmentalism demands close analysis. It 
doesn't get it in this old-fashioned business booster tract, which occasionally 
lapses into the sort of quaint diatribe that had been unfashionable since the 
days of Spiro Agnew. 
</P>
<P>
The article points out, for instance, that 3 million poor Latinos and Asians 
are likely to arrive in California in the next decade. "They are not likely to 
find work selling annuities in Santa Monica or real estate in Marin County. But 
none of this much bothers the state's small but visible and vociferous legion 
of limousine liberals, Hollywood headline grabbers and tree huggers, people who 
have never seen the inside of a manufacturing plant and have little real 
sympathy for the blue-collar types who are hurt by their activities." 
</P>
<P>
The article has nothing but sympathy for the beleaguered manufacturers, who in 
spite of what is portrayed as infinite concern for workers, move their 
companies out of state anyway. 
</P>
<P>
For all its legitimate hand-wringing over the loss of industry, Forbes offers 
no solutions to the underlying problems. In one paragraph the article chastises 
the South Coast Air Quality Management District for fining a business that 
failed to come up with a car pool plan. Two paragraphs later, it criticizes 
authorities for constraining industrial emissions rather than attacking the 
two-thirds of Southern California's pollution caused by car and truck 
emissions. 
</P>
<P>
What the article never mentions is that very few Southern Californians say 
they're leaving the state because they can't find work. Plenty say they would 
like to leave because they're sick of the pollution. 
</P>
<P>
It may or may not be coincidental that the following article in the magazine is 
titled "Tom Hayden, Meet Adam Smith and Thomas Aquinas." The premise of this 
piece is that environmentalism is a religion and so businessmen should not 
count on dealing with environmentalists in rational terms. 
</P>
<P>
The article is written by the author of a book called "Modern Economic 
Theology." But the author does not here acknowledge that bottom-line economics 
might also be considered a religion, or that the difference between his 
approach to the world and that of some environmentalists pivots on whether one 
chooses to worship trees, or the green icons made from their pulp: money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
REQUIRED READING 
</P>
<P>
In Saudi Arabia, journalists complain that the military's public relations 
machinery is making coverage of Operation Desert Shield about as credible as a 
fanzine's coverage of the New Kids on the Block. In October's The Washington 
Monthly, editor Scott Shuger reports on the F-117 Stealth fighter's performance 
in Panama. The Air Force has one public affairs specialist for every four 
planes it owns and, Shuger explains, these specialists specialty is the 
old-fashioned runaround. 
</P>
<P>
Initial reports from the military PR machine declared the Stealth's mission in 
Panama a complete success and trumpeted the plane's "pinpoint accuracy." In 
truth, Shuger reports, the planes were no more accurate than the military's 
statements to the press, missing one target completely and inadvertently 
blowing up a saloon. 
</P>
<P>
The mission succeeded anyway, but that's not the point, Shuger writes. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is not whether the mistakes (in Panama) kept that mission from 
achieving its objective. It's whether they easily could have kept it from 
achieving it -- if the Panamanians had been a little better trained, better 
organized, or better equipped; if they had been, say . . . the Iraqis. There 
are two ways of learning that the risk of military failure is too great. POWS, 
widows, and orphans know all about one of them. The press is the other." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEW ON NEWSSTANDS 
</P>
<P>
Western capitalists have not been meek about charging into the Soviet magazine 
market. Paris Match has just launched a new, all Russian-language general 
interest magazine, which is being test marketed in New York City after the 
250,000 press run sold out in the Soviet Union. Meanwhile the November Ladies' 
Home Journal features a Russian-language section, complete with illustrated 
exercise routines and Soviet models posing provocatively in perfume ads. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SHREDDER FODDER 
</P>
<P>
Last year, P.J. O'Rourke's acerbic "Joe McCarthy Memorial New Enemies List," 
with its red-baiting of everything and everyone liberal, was so tastelessly 
funny in parts it might have caused even Tom Hayden to involuntarily spout 
UFW-picked organic blush wine through his nose. 
</P>
<P>
For this year's version, in the November American Spectator, O'Rourke merely 
prints a rambling list of conservative complaints submitted by readers that 
even crackpot survivalist newsletters would reject -- not because of political 
content, but because they are banal, ham-handed and stupid.

Court Decision: Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall apparently is getting 
along well with his new colleague, David H. Souter, despite Marshall's biting 
comment about Souter's appointment. Justice Antonin Scalia, speaking to 
students at George Washington law school in Washington, D.C., Tuesday, said: 
"They're getting along . . . . They're both very likeable people." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall said in July he had never heard of Souter and said of Bush: "I think 
somebody's calling his shots." 
</P>
<P>
Fergie's Friends: The duchess of York says she once ran with a fast crowd that 
included drug abusers. The former Sarah Ferguson toured a drug rehabilitation 
clinic in New York Monday and told the patients that "a lot of my friends have 
been alcoholics and drug addicts. It's important that we stand together." The 
duchess is wife of Britain's Prince Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
Mind Games: Magician Doug Henning says he and Indian guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi 
will build a $1 billion theme park, practically in Walt Disney World's back 
yard, featuring magic and Eastern-style meditation. "Vedaland" will open in 
1993 in Orlando, Fla., with attractions on the themes of knowledge, 
enlightenment and entertainment and will include a building apparently 
suspended above water. Veda is an Eastern term meaning knowledge, Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
No Fig Newtons: For the third year in a row, Rep. Wayne Owens (D-Utah) has held 
a "Mrs. Fields Cookie Day" for his colleagues in the House. Debbi and Randy 
Fields, creators of the popular cookie franchise, are from back home in Park 
City, Utah. Owens had planned to give the chocolate chip treats to all the 
members except House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, but at the last minute, 
decided that in the hope of getting Congress adjourned, even Gingrich would get 
his cookies.

ART BUCHWALD: RECESSION: BLAME THE CONSUMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART BUCHWALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was driving into work the other morning when I heard this on the radio, 
"There will be a recession if the consumer doesn't shape up. Economists say 
that only the shopper can decide whether the country will go into a tailspin or 
not." 
</P>
<P>
I thought to myself, "If I could just get my hands around the consumer's 
throat, I would force him to buy twice as much as he needs." 
</P>
<P>
I turned to Sister Mary Louise, a nun who is in my car pool, and said, 
"Wouldn't you think that after all we've done for the consumer, the least he or 
she could do is keep us out of a recession?" 
</P>
<P>
Sister Mary Louise told me, "The problem for the consumer is that we gave him 
mixed signals. On the one hand we said that he was getting into too much debt 
and he should put his money into a savings and loan -- and, on the other, we 
urged him to go out and buy a new car. The consumer isn't to blame because the 
government economists don't know which end of the year is up and which is 
down." 
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, I don't want my future in the hands of people who are not sure 
whether this is a good time to spend any money." 
</P>
<P>
Sister Mary Louise added, "We must not be unkind to consumers. For the most 
part they are just like you and me. The only difference is that they have money 
to spend, and if they're going to sit on it I'm afraid that we will all be 
selling imitation Rolexes on Fifth Avenue. The problem as I see it is that the 
consumer is jittery and thinks that if he uses up his money, there won't be any 
left when the hard times roll by. He doesn't realize that by not spending it, 
he is actually causing the depression he lives in fear of." 
</P>
<P>
"Someone should tell the consumer that if he doesn't bring about prosperity, 
nobody will," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally know a lot of buyers," Sister Mary Louise informed me, "and 
they're nice people. It's just that there are times when they can be stubborn. 
If you want my opinion, their sin is that they blow hot when they should blow 
cold, and cold when they should blow hot." 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think that the reason they blow cold is because they have enough of 
everything?" 
</P>
<P>
"Not necessarily. Most people buy to prevent others from having more than they 
do. For example, kids will purchase T-shirts to look better than other kids, 
and girls will purchase flashy jeans to attract the boys. They may look young, 
but they are consumers too. If the kids stop acquiring clothes, then there'll 
be a recession." 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps we should do more to honor the shopper who spends money. For example, 
the Federal Reserve could have the Consumer-of-the-Month to lunch and give him 
a shopping cart for life," I suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Mary Louise had another idea. "The only solution is to create more 
consumers by issuing more credit cards -- 10 to a family -- and keep a supply 
of them at perfume counters in case somebody doesn't have one. The two things 
that go together are debt and plastic." 
</P>
<P>
I said, "Many consumers are lazy and don't like to shop." 
</P>
<P>
The sister said, "I know what you mean. This country is not going to make it 
when consumers buy just food. If we're to beat the doldrums -- and I'm not 
saying we will -- we have to make everybody who goes to Safeway stop off on 
their way home at Victoria's Secret."

SIMI VALLEY THEATER WILL COVER YOUR HANDS IN POPCORN BUTTER. AND BEWARE OF 
RESTROOM COLORS.

Dateline: Mann Sycamore Plaza 6, 3050 Cochrane St., Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
With this installment we have hit a milestone in our series of reviews of 
Ventura County theaters -- an even half-dozen. 
</P>
<P>
Food: Let's just say that the Tums family would be thrilled. The hot dog was 
the saltiest we have come across and the stale bun did nothing to dull the 
sting. The stomachache arrived before the opening credits. 
</P>
<P>
The buttered popcorn rated 10 napkins. That was about how many it took to dry 
our hands after finishing off only half a regular-size serving. The guy selling 
the food squirted in two streams of that "delicious golden flavoring" stuff 
that Mann seems to like to use in lieu of butter. One glob would have been more 
than sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
Restroom: Uuuglyyyyy. The color scheme is a mixture of white and a kind of 
blood cell red. The stall walls, the door and the sink counter are made to look 
like marble versions of these two "colors." 
</P>
<P>
On the up side, the place was clean (though a reliable source says the women's 
restroom gets messy late in the day). Also on the plus side -- the 
towel/blow-dry option. 
</P>
<P>
Pre-movie entertainment: One of those ad and trivia deals. Lots of ads for 
local businesses and upcoming movies. It was backed, not by the more common 
Muzak, but by a mix of hard rock and rhythm and blues. A nice change. 
</P>
<P>
Pre-movie ads: One. 
</P>
<P>
Previews: Three. 
</P>
<P>
Special feature: Your name in lights. Or at least your gender. The "Men" and 
"Women" signs above the restroom doors were outlined in marquee-like yellow 
light bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
Today is a big day for the local video stores, with "The Hunt for Red October" 
and "The Jetsons" both becoming available. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Hunt for Red October' will be a blockbuster," said Mick Thiesen, owner of 
Video City in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
And "The Jetsons"? "I don't think I ordered that dumb thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ojai Film Society feature of the week: "The Man With Two Brains" starring Steve 
Martin and Kathleen Turner. The 1983 film is the story of a surgeon who falls 
in love with a talking brain when his marriage fails. Voice of the brain 
belongs to Sissy Spacek. Showtime is 4:30 p.m. Sunday at the Ojai Playhouse.

The three protagonists of "Boys' Life" probably represent somebody's idea of a 
cross-section of contemporary American males in their 20s. 
</P>
<P>
Don is a handsome, somewhat thick-witted jock who wanted to be an astronaut 
when he grew up but now settles for reading science fiction. Phil is the 
nebbish, the socially insecure intellectual of the group, and Jack, a slick, 
would-be swinger, is the leader of the trio, if only because he's the only one 
with any initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The Howard Korder play, which examines a year in the lives of these three men, 
concludes a six-night run this weekend as an all-student production at Moorpark 
College, directed by Theater Department Prof. Katherine Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
"Boys' Life" is awkwardly written (everybody's constantly addressing one 
another by name: "What do you want, Phil?" "It's got nothing to do with you, 
Phil") and more than a bit superficial. But last week's youthful, largely 
female, opening-night crowd seemed to find plenty to identify with. 
</P>
<P>
That could be because virtually the entire play is about relationships -- 
between the "boys" and with the various women who pass through their lives. 
And, not surprisingly for a group of aging adolescents, the three interact with 
a lot more understanding than they use in relating to the womenfolk. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the encounters are amusing -- a couple downright funny -- and others 
are more poignant. Chances are that everybody in the audience will recognize, 
if not admit to, parallels with their own experiences. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Vandiver and Kent Patrick Hatch play the roles of Jack and Don rather 
broadly. Vandiver seems to be a cross between Steve Martin's "wild and crazy 
guy" and the Casey Kasem disc jockey paradigm (his brief quotation from Robert 
Frost comes as quite a shock; his taste for literature otherwise seems limited 
to Playboy pictorials). The Hatch character resembles someone who has seen too 
many Woody Allen movies. Gary Schaffner's Phil is more enigmatic, showing the 
most character when resorting to sci-fi novel imagery to chat up a woman. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Kershaw, Julie Burton, Julia C. Peacock, Kimberly Sumpter and Suzanne 
Perez portray the women who appear, however briefly, in the boys' lives; 
Peacock the most assured. 
</P>
<P>
One of the funniest moments is supplied by Dann Warick, who keeps intruding on 
a potentially tender moment between Hatch and Kershaw -- it's a well-paced 
scene, with a strong payoff. 
</P>
<P>
Certain aspects of this production ring false: The reference to '80s rock band 
Quiet Riot during a "remember the '70s" quiz, one woman's assertion that you 
see condoms on TV all the time, and the notion that this bunch would be hip 
enough to hire a Zydeco band to perform at a wedding -- apparently, the person 
who came up with the background music for this production assumed that all 
accordion music is pretty much alike. 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
"Boys' Life" continues tonight through Saturday at 8 p.m. at the Moorpark 
College Forum, 7075 Campus Road in Moorpark. General admission tickets are $7. 
Call (805) 378-1444 for further information.

The following are capsule reviews of some of the better restaurants recently 
visited by our critics: 
</P>
<P>
Waterfront dining is alive in -- of all places -- inland Ventura County, at New 
Orleans West. On the Westlake shore, NOW does best with its appetizers, such as 
the tangy chicken fingers, and the more elaborate Seafood Casa Dorata is 
certainly full of seafood. At either the patio or the bar, it's a lovely 
environment. New Orleans West, 32131 Lindero Canyon Blvd., Westlake Village, 
(818) 707-9378. Monday through Saturday 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday 11 a.m. to 
10 p.m. Sunday brunch. Full bar, credit cards accepted. Meal for two, food 
only, $20 to $50. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-page menu at Jack's Restaurant and Deli offers everything from Mexican 
and American to vegetarian and deli food. The beers come in 136 varieties. Try 
the sweet, tangy baby-back pork ribs or the Mexican dishes, which are 
particularly good. Jack's is in Westlake Plaza Shopping Center, Westlake 
Village; 495-8181. Open every day for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Monday 
through Thursday 7 a.m. to midnight; Friday 7 a.m. to 1:30 a.m.; Saturday 7:30 
a.m. to 1:30 a.m.; Sunday 7:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. Dinner for two, food only, 
$19 to $52. 
</P>
<P>
You can go to Santa Barbara's crown jewel, the Four Seasons Biltmore Hotel, for 
more than just the atmosphere or the Sunday brunch buffet. The kitchen is now 
among the best in town, turning out wonderful dishes from lobster sausages to a 
bittersweet chocolate souffle. Better at dinner than at lunch. Either the 
indoor La Marina or the sparkling outdoor Patio makes for romantic dining. The 
Four Seasons Biltmore is at 1260 Channel Drive, Santa Barbara; 969-2261. 
Serving in the Patio weekdays 6:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., weekends 6:30 a.m. to 11 
p.m. Serving in La Marina weekdays 6 to 10 p.m., weekends 6 to 11 p.m. Lunch 
for two, food only, $30 to $48. Dinner for two, food only, $50 to $70. 
</P>
<P>
The pub at Victoria Pub and Restaurant is a lively gathering place for English 
expatriates and pub lovers alike. It stays open until everyone goes home, and 
the dart games never stop. The more subdued restaurant serves an English menu, 
complete with steak and kidney pie, fish and chips and Cornish pasties. The 
soups, which are changed every day, are excellent, as is the lamb steak. The 
crumble of the day with hot fruit, sweet crumble and cream is particularly 
good. Victoria Pub and Restaurant is at 1413F S. Victoria Ave., Ventura; 
650-0060. Lunch is served every day from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Dinner is served 
from 5 to 9:30 p.m., and the pub is open until 2 a.m. Dinner for two, food 
only, $25 to $60.

NINJA TURTLE OUTFITS ARE THE BIG SELLERS THIS YEAR. HALLOWEEN WILL ALSO SEE

<P>
Cowabunga, dude! The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, those pizza-loving radical 
reptiles, won't be in their sewer home plotting against the evil Shredder on 
Halloween night. 
</P>
<P>
No way, dude. Those heroes in a half-shell will be out bagging candy 
door-to-door. That's right, Ninja Turtle costumes are the hottest Halloween 
outfits this year for kids. 
</P>
<P>
"Every boy wants to be a turtle," said Bonnie Mihalic, owner of Bonnie's 
costume and party stores in Ventura and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Last year it was Batman. "I couldn't get enough capes and I ordered 1,100," 
Mihalic said. This year it's the same story with the ninja turtles. 
</P>
<P>
By Oct. 1 she had sold the 180 official turtle costumes she ordered. When she 
called the manufacturer for more, they too were out. Since then, she has 
patched together a turtle outfit, getting a shell from one source and a mask 
from another. 
</P>
<P>
"They seem happy with the new ones," she said, "as long as you don't tell them 
it's not the official costume." 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie's Ventura store is a Halloween landmark. The store is crammed to the 
ceiling with costumes, wigs, ghoulish decorations and accessories -- everything 
from an assortment of Ninja Turtle weapons to pompons for costumed 
cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
Recently the store has been mobbed. At times a line forms at the front door and 
a security guard lets customers in as others leave. Often customers know what 
they want before they get in the store. 
</P>
<P>
For girls, the Little Mermaid costume is a hit thanks to the Disney movie of 
that name. But costume outfitters such as Mihalic were still caught off guard. 
</P>
<P>
"All the little girls want red wigs, and we weren't ready for that," she said, 
citing the long, flowing red hair of the movie's heroine. 
</P>
<P>
Other girl costumes in style this year are flappers, harem girls, Cleopatra and 
pirate girls, Mihalic said. Some are popular year after year, such as Snow 
White. Toddlers inevitably are angels or princesses. 
</P>
<P>
For boys, Bart Simpson's expansive head is a popular mask. Ninjas, of the 
non-turtle type, are big. And Dracula hasn't lost any appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Others are not so hot any more, such as the horrifying Freddie Krueger of 
"Nightmare on Elm Street." 
</P>
<P>
"Last year it was the 1950s poodle skirt," Mihalic said. Not so this year. She 
pointed to a clever costume that appeared to be a rabbit coming out of a black 
top hat. She thought it would catch on. It didn't. It was the same with the 
Arab headpiece and the Army costume. "Gas masks are selling well, though," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
There's no telling what will horrify parents, said Doug Yank, salesman at 
Halloween Adventures in the Oaks Mall in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
One mother steadfastly refused to let her 8-year-old son dress up as Jason, the 
knife-wielding killer from the horror movie "Friday the 13th." But they finally 
agreed on another character -- a crazed, machine-gun-toting soldier who had 
been shot in the head. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't say a word," Yank said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ninja Turtles costumes, as well as the horrible Jason, are selling well at 
Halloween Adventures, along with the Phantom of the Opera outfits and pirate 
duds. 
</P>
<P>
Just as popular are weapons -- machetes, swords, knives, nunchakus. "Anything 
that will maim someone," Yank said. For the girls, though, wands are big. "We 
get a shipment in and it's sold by the end of the day." 
</P>
<P>
At K mart in Camarillo, the big sellers were Bart Simpson, Barbie of teen-queen 
doll fame and the Ninja Turtles. 
</P>
<P>
It was turtle mania at Simi Valley's Target Stores. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone," said Pam Gast, operations manager, "wants to be a Teenage Mutant 
Ninja Turtle." 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
Costumes are available at many department stores. Other locations include 
Bonnie's costume stores at 294 E. Main St., Ventura, and 3636 Saviers Road, 
Oxnard, and Halloween Adventures in the Oaks Mall in Thousand Oaks.

CLOCK-SHOP OWNERS SAY SATURDAY WOULD BE A MAJOR SETBACK IF THEY HAD TO ADJUST 
THEIR PIECES.

<P>
Here's the first of probably many reminders: Before going to bed Saturday, set 
the clocks back for the resumption of Pacific Standard Time. 
</P>
<P>
Sure it's a hassle, but imagine owning a clock shop. 
</P>
<P>
An informal survey of local clock-store owners revealed that they don't reset 
their merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
"I just change one clock in the store -- for myself," said Kingo Uchida, owner 
of the Time Shop in Port Hueneme. "If I changed all of them, I'd have to change 
20 to 30 clocks and then 40 to 50 wristwatches." 
</P>
<P>
We recently received a letter from the Moorpark Woman's Fortnightly Club 
describing what the group is all about. We know now that the club is 85 years 
old and that members are involved with the arts, conservation, education and 
other social issues. 
</P>
<P>
We also know the organization is "nonprofit, nonpolitical, nondenominational 
and, of course, nonracist." 
</P>
<P>
That's a good thing. Racists traditionally make poor community service leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Like teacher, like student, and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
John Solem, a California Lutheran University art instructor, mand Jerry Sawitz, 
a student of his in the early 1970s, will show their artwork together in a 
ceramic show Saturday and Sunday at Images West Galleries in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
"John was what all the students wanted to be," said Sawitz, now an art 
instructor at Thousand Oaks High School. "I was told from an early age that if 
you're an artist, you're going to starve. Then I went to college and here's 
this instructor doing well financially." 
</P>
<P>
It was eventually the student who got the teacher to work in ceramics. Until 
about three years ago Solem had been involved solely with printing and 
painting. "Call it a midlife crisis. I just got burned out. I thought to really 
move ahead I'd start with something I didn't know anything about." 
</P>
<P>
Historical note in honor of the recently concluded Major League baseball 
season: 
</P>
<P>
The first baseball team in Ventura County, the Ventura Baseball Club, was 
organized 117 years ago last week. Just 35 days after the nine men officially 
became a team, they went out and played their first game against an assorted 
group of Ventura citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Final score: Baseball Club 56, Citizens 17. LEO SMITH

WHEN JUNK IS ART;

<P>
THIS ARTIST AND TEACHER IS WORKING ON SEVEN TOTEMS, EACH A PILLAR OF 
UNRECYCLABLE WASTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The year was 1983, the city was Santa Barbara, and the site was the bathroom of 
Kim Loucks, aspiring artist. Loucks, freshly made up, tossed a lipstick-smudged 
tissue into the toilet. 
</P>
<P>
"It just hung there," she recalled the other day. "It looked like a shout in 
the dark, and that's what I called the series." 
</P>
<P>
The series was a succession of artworks built around castoff lipstick smears. 
The works were a departure for Loucks, who until then had concentrated on 
figurative drawings and oil paintings. It was the beginning of her career as a 
creator of art from refuse. 
</P>
<P>
Now the 35-year-old artist and teacher does most of her work with castoff 
materials. She is by no means a big name, but in these days of heightened 
environmental awareness, she and many artists such as her are enjoying a small 
boom in public attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really intrigued with involvement art. I really like this project because 
it's involving me with people, instead of keeping me in my studio making pretty 
little boxes," said Loucks, waving her arm at the brightly colored detritus 
strewn about her studio. 
</P>
<P>
Since May, Loucks has been working on her largest and most explicitly 
trash-based artworks to date. Drawing on a grant of $2,500 from the Ventura 
Arts Council and $1,000 from the disposal firm Waste Management Inc., she plans 
to construct seven "trash totems." Each will be a pillar of unrecyclable waste, 
8 feet high, 2 feet wide and 2 feet deep, held together by a wood frame and 
metal fencing, and placed in a public venue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just such an obvious and natural way for people to be able to incorporate 
those concerns in their art-making," said Elizabeth Shepherd, curator at UCLA's 
Wight Art Gallery, which recently had a show dedicated to California assemblage 
artists of the past 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Making art from junk is a trick as old as this century, Shepherd and others are 
quick to note. And the medium doesn't necessarily have anything to do with 
environmental awareness. But, said Elizabeth Smith, an associate curator at the 
Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, with environmentalism such a 
widespread concern "there may indeed be more of a tendency toward that in 
artists' exploration of the issues." 
</P>
<P>
At the environmentally oriented Biota gallery on Los Angeles' arty Melrose 
Avenue, Director Kathy Biart said she has been seeing, and showing, more and 
more assemblages of recycled objects. 
</P>
<P>
"People really seem to respond to that more than they used to," Biart said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the city of Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department, meanwhile, 
have started planning a "Materials for the Arts" program, which will seek 
castoff materials from industry and business, collect them at a free materials 
bank, and hand them out to nonprofit arts organizations and artists with public 
projects in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Cultural officials, still seeking a city property to convert into headquarters, 
hope to have the bank up and running in about a year, in conjunction with a 
variety of educational programs linking arts and recycling. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be a boomlet now," said Barbara Goldstein, planning coordinator for 
the Cultural Affairs Department, "but there's going to be a real boom over the 
next few years." 
</P>
<P>
A finished trash totem stands at the door of the Loucks studio on North Palm 
Street in Ventura. Assembled from trash donated by friends and family, it 
confronts passing shoppers with a jumble of green, red and yellow plastic 
rising from a base of concrete chunks. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the studio, cardboard boxes are crowded with contributions for the other 
six totems. There is a cross-section of trash from the county dump, which 
Loucks hopes to place in the Oxnard Financial Plaza: a collection of musicians' 
castoff guitar picks and drum heads, destination unknown; and a gathering of 
discarded office supplies and defective low-flow shower nozzles from the city 
of Ventura, to be displayed on a city-owned lot off Figueroa Street. 
</P>
<P>
Loucks also plans a junk-mail totem, destination unknown; a high school totem 
she hopes to assemble and place during a monthlong stint at Ventura High School 
in November; and a "flotsam and jetsam" totem of trash collected from the 
Channel Islands. She hopes to display the island findings in the Ventura Harbor 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Her work habits are simple. Loucks rinses the unrecyclable trash in gray water, 
which leaves her work area no smellier than the typical artist's studio. She 
arranges the objects and then stacks them in rectangular frames of wood and 
metal fencing. But newcomers happening upon her studio are sometimes quizzical: 
Is this art, or is it a batch of irreparable toy cars, empty stain-remover 
jugs, cracked PVC piping and plastic six-pack rings? 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a tough project to sell," acknowledged Loucks, seated just inside 
the studio door. "People in Ventura have not seen this in their local museums." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the project won't have to sell: The works are temporary and will 
probably be dismantled. What Loucks more often sells are briefcase-size 
assemblage boxes holding thematically arranged materials. She usually asks $100 
to $400 for them. 
</P>
<P>
Loucks, who was born in Philadelphia, grew up in southern New Jersey and 
studied art at Glassboro State College there. Since coming to the West, she has 
made her way through a variety of other jobs to subsidize her art-making: 
substitute teaching, preparing disabled students for jobs and independent 
living, and playing country music in bars around the county. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, she married local musician Phil Salazar, and the two share a Ventura 
house full of musical instruments, albums, art equipment and formerly stray 
pets. The garage bulges with castoff items to be reused someday, and the grass 
in their yard is green-gray from limited watering -- hints of the household's 
waste consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
But while that consciousness has fueled much of her work over the past seven 
years, Loucks said, it also has made her think twice about the implications of 
making any kind of art. 
</P>
<P>
Oil paint, for instance, "is a real toxic hazard. But I still have a bunch. Do 
I throw it in a dump, or do I use it to make pretty pictures from it?" 
</P>
<P>
The sea shells she keeps in a box at her studio: "I feel really guilty about 
them, and there's a part of me that wants to go down to the beach and return 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the wood that goes into her totems. "Where does this stuff 
come from?" she asked half rhetorically. "I'm cutting down the trees that my 
beloved birds live in." 
</P>
<P>
If a boom in trash art is coming, then for at least one trash artist, a new 
round of conscience-searching may be as well. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Loucks wrote a song about all these worries and called it "Ignorance 
is Bliss." But that didn't quite solve the riddle: How does a serious artist 
reconcile the urge to leave something behind with her conscience's inclination 
to leave nothing behind? 
</P>
<P>
After a lot of thought, Loucks said, she has come to this conclusion: 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to think about it. . . . My whole persona is tied up in making 
objects, and extricating myself from that would be a long process." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UP CLOSE: KIM LOUCKS 
</P>
<P>
Game: Art. To pay the bills, the versatile 35-year-old also substitute teaches 
and works as a musician. 
</P>
<P>
Fame: Minor, so far. She's at work on her biggest project ever -- a $3,500 
commission to make seven "trash totems" for the public. The commission was made 
through the Ventura Arts Council. 
</P>
<P>
Came: To Ventura in 1978. Born in Philadelphia, raised in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Words to frame: "People in Ventura have not seen this in their local museums."

On Tuesdays you're likely to find two professors at California Lutheran 
University engaged in animated conversation over their lunch. 
</P>
<P>
"Kiu havas miajn librojn?" says Spanish professor James Fonseca. "Viaj libroj 
estas tie," responds his colleague, Myron Bondelid, an assistant professor in 
the math/physics/computer science department. 
</P>
<P>
"Who has my books?" 
</P>
<P>
"Your books are there." 
</P>
<P>
This mellifluous exchange sounds like Swedish spoken with a Spanish accent. It 
may stir Proustian memories of French class and bizarre snatches of 
conversation such as, "The pen of my aunt is in the garden." 
</P>
<P>
Or, if you are like my mother, it may remind you of the Latin you studied in 
high school but can't speak. In that case, you may associate learning a foreign 
language with "amo, amas, amat" ad nauseam. 
</P>
<P>
If so, you may be a linguaphobe in search of a language. You've tried French 
but the silent letters are deadly. Your copy of "501 Spanish Verbs" is still on 
the shelf. And you thought that Welsh village, Llanfairpwllgwyngyll, was tough 
to pronounce. Until you took German.

Like Fonseca and Bondelid, you might thrive on Esperanto. Devised in 1887 by a 
physician named Dr. Ludoviko Zamenhof, Esperanto offers a neutral, relatively 
simple foreign language that is considered an auxiliary language. It is not 
expected to replace a person's native language. However, because Esperanto is 
not tinged with cultural traditions or political ideology, it is proposed by 
many as a universal second language. Many Rotarians are keen advocates, and the 
British Post Office has recognized Esperanto for inland telegrams since 1908. 
</P>
<P>
For senior citizens thinking about learning a second language but daunted by 
the prospect of years of studying and nothing to show for it, Esperanto could 
be the answer. 
</P>
<P>
Fonseca, 66, became interested in Esperanto in 1979. A former board member of 
the Esperanto League of North America, he has taught beginning Esperanto at Cal 
Lutheran. He said that about ten million people know Esperanto, one million of 
whom he described as "strong speakers" of the language. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanto is a family affair for Fonseca. Both he and his wife have attended 
workshop courses and international conventions. Fonseca's daughter met her 
husband, who is fluent in Esperanto, while attending the Esperanto Cultural 
Center in Switzerland two years ago. Although the newlyweds speak French 
between them, Fonseca said that he communicates best with his son-in-law by 
using Esperanto. 
</P>
<P>
Bondelid and Fonseca met at Elwin Reed's Esperanto club in Camarillo. Reed, who 
retired from the civil service twelve years ago, taught himself Esperanto in 
the Navy. Recognizing its value, he has taught it over the years to adults and 
even to Boy Scouts. The 75-year-old Reed is listed in the "Dele Jarlibro 1990," 
a compendium of information about the Universal Esperanto Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason I got interested in Esperanto," Bondelid said, "was I had so much 
trouble with Latin and later German. My Latin teacher in high school 
recommended an Esperantist in my home town of Grand Forks, North Dakota." It 
only took Bondelid six weeks to learn Esperanto. 
</P>
<P>
Using Esperanto makes sense because the grammar is very regular. It contains 
only sixteen rules and there are no exceptions. Adjectives end in "a." Nouns 
end in "o." All the endings in a given verb tense are the same so you must use 
a subject pronoun. Esperanto is designed in such a way that speakers can invent 
new words. Your high school Latin might finally pay off because the vocabulary 
is mostly drawn from the Romance languages, which stem from Latin. Actual Latin 
words are used as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Esperanto also uses a considerable amount of Germanic words, including 
English," said Fonseca. For example, the Esperanto word for bird is birdo 
(pronounced BEER-doe). Some Greek words such as kaj (and) are employed, but 
Esperanto contains few Slavic words considering its originator was a Pole. 
</P>
<P>
Zamenhof first published his introductory treatise, La Internacia Lingvo (The 
International Language), in Russian. Zamenhof's secondary school experiences as 
a Polish Jew living in the mixed population on the Russian-Polish border 
motivated him to create a neutral, common language. Zamenhof hoped to avoid the 
violence and mistrust engendered by strong feelings of nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
People soon called the language Esperanto after Zamenhof's pen name, Dr. 
Esperanto, "one who hopes." Many people embraced the concept of a neutral, 
international second language that could be learned easily and could foster 
communication and understanding. Even the flag of Esperanto is green and white 
to represent hope and peace. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts are under way to introduce Esperanto into schools in the United States. 
Just imagine. In ten years we might be singing Reed's translation of the first 
verse of "Jingle Bells." 
</P>
<P>
"Glitveturas ni, 
</P>
<P>
Tirate de ceval', 
</P>
<P>
Ridas, kantas ni, 
</P>
<P>
Ce kamp', ce mont', ce val'."

<P>
NORTH COUNTY HOME TO NEW SOCCER TRENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Look around on any fall Saturday -- from Del Mar to Oceanside, Encinitas to 
Escondido -- and you'll see soccer uniforms. All day long, children scurry 
after black-and-white balls on every available field in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Having successfully competed with other traditional youth activities like 
Little League, soccer has firmly established itself in North County as 
elsewhere. The area also finds itself home to some new trends, decried by some 
and applauded by others. 
</P>
<P>
"The population in North County is growing fast, but the numbers of kids 
playing soccer are growing even faster," said Judith Wesling, a district 
commissioner for the United States Youth Soccer Assn., one of two national 
organizations overseeing soccer in the county. 
</P>
<P>
As the number of children playing increases, so do the options available and 
the confusion for many parents over the right choices for their own children. 
</P>
<P>
In most communities, boys and girls can choose to play purely recreational 
soccer in their own neighborhoods or try out for more competitive teams. For 
instance, the Encinitas Soccer Club offers three levels of play: A or 
recreational teams play locally; AA teams are more competitive and may travel 
to other communities for their games; AAA teams are the most competitive and 
travel far afield. Any child may sign up for a recreational team, but for the 
two competitive levels, team members must actually try out and be chosen. 
</P>
<P>
At the AAA level, soccer often becomes a 12-month commitment, especially when 
combined with high school soccer. In fact, this region has acquired a 
reputation as a hot bed for year-round soccer. 
</P>
<P>
On any given weekend, AAA teams like Poway Vaqueros, Escondido Heat, La Jolla 
Nomads and Rancho Bernardo Pegasus, may face each other or travel outside of 
the county for distant tournaments. For instance, the San Dieguito Surf 
under-17 boys team (and many of their family members) will spend Thanksgiving 
in Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Tryouts and traveling are not the only relatively new wrinkles in youth soccer. 
In many cases, the coaches of the AAA teams are not volunteer dads and moms; 
they're paid non-relatives who play soccer themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, paid coaches were not the case, but now there's a definite 
trend in that direction," Wesling said. "As the youth players get better and 
now have national role models in the pro players, they're looking for a higher 
level of coaching. The paid coaches have the expertise and skills that parents 
who didn't grow up playing soccer don't have." 
</P>
<P>
One of those coaches is Joseph Giacalone, who has played for a pro soccer team 
in San Bernadino and is trying out for the San Diego Soccers. 
</P>
<P>
This season he's coaching the Rancho Bernardo Hornets, a team of 10- and 
11-year-old girls. He said income from coaching and giving private lessons 
allows him the freedom to continue playing professional soccer. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids and parents at the AAA level are more motivated," Giacalone said. "I 
try to put as little pressure as possible on them and still try to teach them 
to be good soccer players." 
</P>
<P>
According to Robin Schultz, whose daughter, Jennifer, plays for the Hornets, 
the trend toward paid coaches seems to be working: "The kids are playing 
better, and, since this is the livelihood of these coaches, they have to be 
good with the kids." 
</P>
<P>
Paying coaches and traveling to distant tournaments do not come without a price 
tag. One mother whose son decided to try out for a AAA team after having played 
on recreational teams said she was ready to write a check for about $35 but 
found out that a check for 10 times that amount wouldn't cover the cost for the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The coaches' paychecks come out of the parents' checkbooks, as does the cost of 
team travel and uniforms. Each league collects the money differently, but a fee 
of several hundred dollars is not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
The United States Youth Soccer Assn.'s counterpart is the American Youth Soccer 
Organization, which emphasizes the recreational rather than competitive aspects 
of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
The American Youth Soccer Organization has leagues in Mira Mesa and the San 
Marcos area and plans to open a new region in Carlsbad next year. 
</P>
<P>
"Although we have some paid staff in the national office, every one else is a 
volunteer in our organizations, from the coaches to the registrars," says Eric 
Brummond, the national development coordinator for the organization. "We place 
an emphasis on having fun, staying fit and teaching skills." 
</P>
<P>
The organization's philosophy revolves around four principles, says Brummond: 
every child should play at least half of each game; each team should be 
balanced so children don't get discouraged; clubs should hold open reservations 
with no tryouts so that there is no discrimination on the basis of skill, and 
all coaches should practice positive coaching. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, all teams in the county, regardless of national or state affiliation 
start out at the recreational, nontraveling level. The competitive option kicks 
in around the age of 9. In most leagues, organized play begins at the age of 5. 
</P>
<P>
At the North County Soccer Park in Poway, many parents from surrounding 
neighborhoods have decided to take advantage of the soccer park's organized 
leagues for children as young as 4. The younger children play their games on a 
new kind of indoor-outdoor field designed by co-owners Mark Bentley and Tom 
Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
The soccer park's mini field measures about 85 feet by 50 feet and has been 
built with sand-filled turf and smooth walls with injury prevention in mind. 
The teams field four rather than the traditional 11 at one time, so each child 
gets more contact with the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Why sign up kids for organized sports before they even go to kindergarten? 
</P>
<P>
According to Bentley and the parents whose children participate, this early 
introduction to soccer will accelerate their development of skills. Besides, as 
one dad says, "the kids get to associate with other kids and just have fun." 
</P>
<P>
Although the adults involved in youth soccer may disagree about the right age 
for children to start playing and other fine points, there is almost universal 
agreement that soccer, on the whole, is a good sport for kids. 
</P>
<P>
"Soccer is definitely one of the better sports," said Dr. Howard Taras, a 
pediatrician at UC San Diego. "There are fewer injuries in soccer than there 
are in football, and, unlike baseball, it's an aerobic sport." 
</P>
<P>
The aerobic advantages of the sport come at a time when a number of studies 
have concluded that American children have become couch potatoes and are at 
risk of developing serious health problems because of their poor eating habits 
and poorer exercise regimens. 
</P>
<P>
When youth soccer was young it managed to avoid the scenario of adults reliving 
past glory or re-inventing their playing careers through children. Most 
Americans knew next to nothing about the game. 
</P>
<P>
As a sport, soccer came to this country late. Although Americans assaulted each 
other on the gridiron, the rest of the world played an entirely different kind 
of "football." Ethnic teams began playing this new kind of football in the '60s 
and, slowly, youth soccer teams sprang up around the United States. 
</P>
<P>
As the sport became more popular and familiar, the archetypal "Little League" 
parents -- the ones whose veins bulge as they shout abuse at players, coaches 
and officials -- have taken their places on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Many soccer leagues have tried to set standards to encourage appropriate 
conduct on the part of everyone involved. The American Youth Soccer 
Organization, for instance, has a bill of rights for young athletes as well as 
codes of conduct for coaches, referees, parents and players. 
</P>
<P>
Pediatrician Taras stresses that children need to learn how healthy competition 
differs from unhealthy competition, and that unhealthy competition should be 
guarded against at all ages. He also offers these recommendations for parents 
contemplating soccer for their children: 
</P>
<P>
* The younger the child, the less structured the activity should be. 
</P>
<P>
* Children should never be forced to play. 
</P>
<P>
* Younger children especially should be viewed as competing against themselves 
instead of other children. 
</P>
<P>
* Activities should be increased gradually to avoid injuries. 
</P>
<P>
* In hot, humid weather children, especially younger children, need to be 
encouraged to drink lots of water. 
</P>
<P>
* Children should never be told to continue playing if they say they are hurt. 
"If a child is hurt, he or she shouldn't stay in the game," Taras said. "If 
pretending to be hurt, the child really doesn't want to be playing at all."

HIGH SCORER IN SOCCER WINS NATIONAL RECOGNITION AT 7

In early September, a local soccer player gained national attention. Steven 
Schultz's photo graced the pages of none other than Sports Illustrated in its 
"Faces in the Crowd" department. 
</P>
<P>
Steven, just 7, scored seven goals in a single soccer game and led his team, 
the F.C. Peewees, to a 16-2 victory over the Blue Jays in the North County 
Soccer Park indoor championship. During the season, Steven averaged nearly five 
goals per game for a total of 40. 
</P>
<P>
When asked what he thought about being featured in a national magazine, Steven 
said, "It's OK." He also confided he's since scored 10 goals in one game. 
</P>
<P>
Steven is the second of four children in a soccer-committed family. Sisters 
Jennifer, 11, and Vanessa, 4, also play in organized leagues; father Robin 
coaches, and mother Mary plays in three different leagues. At 18 months, Ryan 
is still content to kick the ball along the sidelines or nap in the car. DIANE

THE MAIL QUEEN OF PEACEFUL PALOMAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Postmaster Jennifer Willis wears a blue smock of her own choosing. Because 
rural postal employees don't get a uniform allowance, they can pick their own 
work clothes, within reason. 
</P>
<P>
Her glasses are held together with a paper clip. She doesn't use much makeup, 
and she wears her brown hair long and straight. 
</P>
<P>
By noon, roughly a dozen people have visited the single window in the small 
cube of a building that serves as Palomar Mountain's post office. Willis, 47, 
knows every one of them. 
</P>
<P>
She has lived and worked on the mountain 22 years. After years as a clerk, she 
was made postmaster 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
There's no home mail delivery on Palomar Mountain. Willis' postal branch has 
228 post office boxes, two-thirds of which are rented. 
</P>
<P>
Palomar Mountain isn't a place for people who need to be entertained. There is 
no movie theater, although the local store rents videos. The only restaurant is 
a vegetarian place owned by the Spiritual World Society. The nearest pizza 
joint is 30 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
There's no cable television. "They just use our mountain to bounce their 
signals off of," Willis said. And there's no newspaper delivery. 
</P>
<P>
"My idea of a perfect day off is to spend the day at home," Willis said. 
"Sundays, I generally catch up on my sleep." 
</P>
<P>
Peace and quiet are the primary attractions here. 
</P>
<P>
Her job occasionally stretches to include tasks unknown to an urban postmaster, 
like the time she weighed a newborn baby on her postal scale. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll probably stay until I get too old to gather firewood," said Willis.

PLACES TO LOOK FOR THE RIGHT PUMPKIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Should you need a jack-o'-lantern to brighten your doorstep this Halloween, you 
will find plenty of North County growers ready to provide you with just the 
right ones. Besides being used as seasonal decorations however, locally grown 
pumpkins and squashes can also enliven humdrum fall menus. 
</P>
<P>
Robert and Peggy Torres of the Chestnut Produce Stand in Carlsbad are 
particularly excited this year about white pumpkins -- in all ways similar to a 
medium-sized jack-o'-lantern, except for their whitish tinge. 
</P>
<P>
"The flesh is bright orange and very thick," said Peggy Torres, adding that 
they make excellent pies. The unusual white specimens contrast with the bright 
orange sugar pumpkins next to them. "The sugar pumpkins are smaller than 
jack-o'-lanterns and they have a thicker flesh, which also makes them excellent 
for pies," said Torres, who with her husband farms in Carlsbad and Valley 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
The pink banana squash has a deep-orange flesh and tastes much like the 
butternut. Robert Torres recommends baking it with a little butter and a 
sprinkle of cinnamon. 
</P>
<P>
The Chestnut Produce Stand also features decorative miniature Indian ears of 
corn, and decorative lufa gourds as twisted as rattlesnakes. Around Halloween, 
the stand creates a "haunted house" for classes of grade-school children. The 
tours are already booked for this year, but teachers interested in arranging a 
tour next year should call by the end of next September. 
</P>
<P>
Madeline Maciel of the Maciel Family Farm in Bonsall sells pumpkins, squashes 
and a variety of seasonal produce at area farmers' markets. Her sister Irene 
sells flowers from the back of the family truck. At this time of year, bright 
orange mini-pumpkins, yellow sunbursts, dark green Hubbards and soft, golden 
Tahitian squash attract scores of regular customers. "The Tahitian is almost as 
sweet as a yam," said Maciel as she dispensed recipes along with her home-grown 
produce. "It caramelizes as it cooks." 
</P>
<P>
She also recommends the spaghetti squash: "It's great for people on a diet. 
Just bake it at 350 degrees for 40 minutes, and then separate the flesh with a 
fork. It's a delicious substitute for spaghetti." 
</P>
<P>
Howard Jewett, who also likes to experiment with exotic produce, swears by the 
kabocha, a squash of Japanese origin that looks a little like a large, 
malformed, acorn squash. "It doesn't look like much, but it's very juicy," he 
said. "Little beads of juice form as soon as you cut it open. It's succulent 
when you bake it." The lime-green opo squash, originally from Hawaii, is 
another of his favorites. The slender zucchini-like vegetable is ideal for 
grating and stuffing. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at this," said Don Picket, co-owner with Ron Wright of the Berry Patch 
Stand in Vista, as he breaks in half a yam the color of tangerine sherbet. "You 
won't find a sweeter yam anywhere." Picket, who has been farming in the county 
for 25 years, maintains that his yams can be baked and frozen for up to one 
year. The golden pride variety of yam grows in San Pasqual Valley, and attracts 
customers from as far as Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"I sold over 20,000 pounds of yams last year," Picket said proudly. "Many 
customers buy them by the 50-pound box." 
</P>
<P>
Pumpkins and squashes are very low in calories, and a good source of vitamin A. 
When buying pumpkins or squashes, avoid pumpkins with cracked shells and 
squashes with blemishes, or any that feel "mushy" to the touch. 
</P>
<P>
Textures and tastes vary. The small, sweet-tasting acorn squash has slightly 
fibrous texture and is ideal for stuffing. The banana squash's golden flesh is 
creamy and sweet, much like the butternut and the Hubbard. The kabocha's dark 
orange flesh boasts a nuttier flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Medium-sized hollowed-out pumpkins make a dramatic serving-dish for pumpkin 
soup or home-made stew. To warm the pumpkin shell, scoop out the seeds, pour in 
boiling water and let stand about 20 minutes. Discard the water, and pour in 
the soup or stew. 
</P>

JIM MURRAY: PROMOTION IS SECOND TO NONE

LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It all began with Tex Rickard. He took the fight game off the barges and put it 
on Park Avenue. He made it as In as polo with the upper classes. Unlettered, 
uneducated, he hunted for his gold in the Klondike with a deck of marked cards 
and the nerves of a guy who would bet it all on the color of the next cow. 
</P>
<P>
He made his fortune in the fight game, but there's no evidence he was otherwise 
interested in it one way or the other. He landed the biggest attraction of his 
day -- Jack Johnson and Jim Jeffries -- by the simple expedient of buying Mrs. 
Johnson a fur coat when no one else would even speak to her. He put a 
half-million dollars in gold in a store window in Goldfield, Nev., to promote 
his fight and he put the first million-dollar gate together in New Jersey 
because New York was too squeamish to permit it (Dempsey-Carpentier) in 1919. 
</P>
<P>
He was a hayseed, a rube, but he beat New York at its own game. He was the 
first to print gold-backed tickets and make a fight seem like an invitation to 
a palace. He was 50 years ahead of his time in hiring press agents and selling 
movie rights. His stock comment was, "I never seed anything like it!" He never 
got rich because he kept pushing the chips back out onto the table. 
</P>
<P>
He made Jack Dempsey and vice versa. In 1927, Gene Tunney got the unheard-of 
purse of $990,000, and he gave Rickard $10,000 so he could make out and 
photograph for posterity the boxing world's first million-dollar check. Rickard 
rolled high. He won or lost with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
He was a private man in a flamboyant business, and he fretted a lot. He was 
particularly frightened when he matched Luis Angel Firpo with Dempsey. He 
thought Dempsey might kill him, maybe literally, and cause a riot at the box 
office of fans wanting their money back. He went to the champ and asked him to 
take it easy. Dempsey went flying out of the ring in the first round, but 
Rickard needn't have worried -- the fight mob never squawks at a knockout. It's 
the 15-round bloodless gavottes that get them to throwing chairs. 
</P>
<P>
After Rickard and Dempsey, the fight game went into a decline. There was a 
series of boring artisans until Joe Louis and Mike Jacobs came along. Joe was 
the wrong color for those racist times, but boxing had been integrated long 
before the railroads were. Long before there was a Jackie Robinson, there was a 
Joe Gans and a Peter Godfrey. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Jacobs, like Rickard, wasn't a sportsman, either. He was a ticket 
speculator. And he knew a Broadway attraction when he saw one, and he knew Joe 
Louis was to sports what Bernhardt was to theater or Valentino to the movies: a 
sure-fire seat-filler. Jacobs didn't care for the fight game all that much. He 
interfered with the normal order of things only once: when Max Schmeling was 
entitled to a title shot at the champion James Braddock. Jacobs maneuvered him 
out of it and Louis into it. Jacobs did not want the heavyweight championship 
going to Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of their groundbreaking, it's unlikely either Tex Rickard or Mike 
Jacobs could have foreseen what their sport has turned into: a money pit that 
makes Tunney's million dollars look like a tip for the hatcheck girl. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at the Mirage hotel here in this improbable metropolis, two 
prizefighters who probably could not have warmed up Dempsey or Louis as 
sparring partners will divvy up more than $32 million for 36 minutes -- or less 
-- of fist-fighting. Buster Douglas, whom no one ever mixed up with Gene 
Tunney, will get more than $24 million. His opponent, Evander Holyfield, whom 
no one ever mixed up with even Floyd Patterson, will get in excess of $8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
That's what it has come to. Two guys who might be fighting the semi-main 25 
years ago -- one guy's too little, the other guy's too fat -- are going to get 
more money in half an hour than John Jacob Astor probably got out of furs in 
his lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
The successor to the Rickards and the Jacobses is an equally improbable 
character -- a brash, aggressive young casino operator who ignores a 
catastrophic eye condition, retinitis pigmentosa, to put on a fight that, for 
sheer weight of numbers, makes the Rickards and Jacobses look like tinhorns. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Wynn has hypothecated $40 million on this extravaganza. Rivals say he was 
crazy, that Wynn's nickname should be "No." Thirty-two million dollars was too 
much to ante up for these fighters. But Wynn points out the rival offer was $29 
million, adding: "And they have no casino to promote." 
</P>
<P>
Like Rickard and Jacobs before him, Wynn is not interested in promoting a sport 
-- just a casino. Numbers such as these boggle the mind, but Wynn says he saw 
money begin flying around because of a simple accident of fate, the one that 
saw Buster Douglas knock out Mike Tyson in Tokyo last February. "When I saw 
Buster knock out Tyson in Tokyo," Wynn says, "I came right up out of my chair. 
I thought, 'Holy geez! We've got a whole new ballgame here! This busts things 
wide open!' " 
</P>
<P>
Wynn saw the opportunities for his casino. This is what bigtime pugilism has 
become, a shill for a crap game. 
</P>
<P>
But if 10% of the nearly 15 million homes wired up for pay television in this 
country pony up $35-40 for Douglas-Holyfield, Wynn not only hypes the crap 
tables, he meets the nut. "I make the Mirage the most famous hotel in America," 
he says. "The fight is one day. We're open 365." 
</P>
<P>
Apart from that, Buster Douglas-Evander Holyfield, even though it's for the 
title, is just a kind of complicated elimination bout. Mike Tyson is the 
promoter's dream today, the logical successor to Rickard's Dempsey and Jacobs' 
Louis. At first blush, it would seem as if the two guys tonight were contesting 
for a stateroom on the Titanic. Because whoever wins here is going to run into 
the iceberg -- Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be a big fight because nobody knows who's going to win," says Steve 
Wynn. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, he's right. You go to a fight for the same reason you go to the 
opera -- you know how it's going to come out, but you go to hear Caruso sing or 
Toscanini conduct. A Muhammad Ali or Joe Louis fight is a case in point. Or you 
go because you can't decide who's the better man. 
</P>
<P>
This may be a contest to see who is worse. Buster Douglas, at 246 pounds, 
appears to be about as ready for a 12-round ordeal as Orson Welles would have 
been. Still, Holyfield may not have enough sense to stay away from him till he 
melts. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, it's as American as pie a la mode, which Buster slightly resembles. 
It's a slice of Americana. Rickard and Jacobs would understand perfectly. So 
would P.T. Barnum and any guy with a tent and a wagon load of snake oil. You 
used to have to own steel mills to pull down this kind of one-day money. As 
Rickard would say, "I never seed anything like it."

USC JOB IS OPEN AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
TROJANS: SMITH SAYS MARINOVICH WILL HAVE TO EARN BACK STARTING QUARTERBACK 
POSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Todd Marinovich, USC's sophomore quarterback, probably would have been demoted 
this week even if he hadn't been suspended for academic reasons, Coach Larry 
Smith said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say he would have been benched," Smith said, "but he would have had 
to have a hell of a week of practice (to start)." 
</P>
<P>
Smith also said that Marinovich will not be given the starting position but 
will have to earn it back in practice. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich apparently angered Smith when he complained of an earache Monday and 
begged out of practice after Smith had warned Marinovich and his teammates that 
such a move might cost them their starting positions. 
</P>
<P>
Smith gathered the players at a film session before Monday's practice and laid 
down ground rules in the aftermath of Saturday's 35-26 loss to Arizona. USC 
squandered a 17-7 halftime lead against the Wildcats and was all but eliminated 
from the Rose Bowl race. 
</P>
<P>
"I told every player in that room that . . . I needed four days of all-out 
practice," Smith said. "Guys with bumps, bruises, little aches and pains -- if 
they weren't told by a doctor not to be out there, (they should) be out there. 
</P>
<P>
"If they missed any part of a practice without something serious, then most 
likely they wouldn't start in the game (Saturday against Arizona State at 
Tempe.). 
</P>
<P>
"Monday during practice, about 40 minutes into it, Todd told Coach (Ray) Dorr 
(who coaches USC's quarterbacks) that he had an earache and he had to go see a 
trainer, which was fine. So, I went over there and said, 'Is your earache so 
severe that you don't think you can practice?' He said, 'I don't think I can.' 
I said, 'OK, then leave the field and go get treatment.' 
</P>
<P>
"I went over to the offense and said, 'We've got our first guy (out). Most 
likely, Shane (Foley) will start this week. Todd is sick and you know what I 
told you all, and I'm sticking to it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich's ailment, Smith said, was later diagnosed as a "minor" ear 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
But Marinovich's father, Marv, said that the infection, which spread in the 
last week from Todd's left index finger to his left ear, caused a severe 
headache for his son and affected his balance and equilibrium in the Arizona 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich completed 18 of 35 passes for 174 yards and a touchdown against the 
Wildcats, but threw three interceptions. And in the first three quarters, he 
completed only seven of 18 passes for 61 yards, with one interception. 
</P>
<P>
"As well as I know Todd's performance, I can tell when things are off," the 
elder Marinovich said. "You watch a guy as much as I've watched that guy -- I 
know when things aren't right. And I knew something was haywire." 
</P>
<P>
Marv Marinovich said that antibiotics have improved his son's condition this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Marinovich declined interview requests made through USC and his father. 
</P>
<P>
All that aside, Smith and Marinovich's father again stressed that Marinovich's 
suspension was related only to academics. Marinovich missed classes last week 
after making an agreement with Smith last month that if he didn't go to class, 
he would be suspended. 
</P>
<P>
He will be reinstated to the team next week, Smith said, if he attends all of 
his classes this week and meets his academic commitments. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich fell behind in his classwork, it has been learned, at a time when he 
was living with a teammate in what Smith described as a "small, dinky room." 
</P>
<P>
The players were assigned the room after they waited until the last minute to 
apply for student housing, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"It really wasn't the ideal situation for a guy playing football and trying to 
study," Smith said of the cramped conditions. 
</P>
<P>
When Marinovich tried to move to an off-campus apartment, he was told that he 
could not be reimbursed the scholarship money paid for his original room until 
housing officials could find other students to move into it. 
</P>
<P>
He lived for a time with friends, sleeping on couches, until moving to Torrance 
a few weeks ago to live with his father. 
</P>
<P>
"He did that so he could have his own room and his own schedule and could 
concentrate," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, when he missed classes, Marinovich spent time with his girlfriend, a 
graduate student at Georgetown and former USC student who was in town visiting. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some extenuating circumstances, but I don't want to let Todd off the 
hook because if he makes a deal with the coach, then that's what he's got to 
do," Marv Marinovich said. "If he didn't live up to his part of the deal, he's 
got to be (disciplined). That's part of growing up. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope he will learn something from it. I hope it will be a positive 
situation. If you take away his football, you've got his attention. 
</P>
<P>
". . . I feel horribly about it. He called the other day and it was very 
emotional. I really felt for him. But again, when you give your word, when you 
make an agreement -- Larry Smith had no other way to go." 
</P>
<P>
Smith has described Marinovich as a poor practice player, but he said that he 
has never questioned his desire to play. 
</P>
<P>
"Todd Marinovich wants to play," Smith said. "There's no question in my mind. 
He loves playing. I don't think he's tired of the game, or anything like that. 
He wants to play in the worst way. 
</P>
<P>
"Next week, if Todd is reinstated, they'll be competing to see who's the 
starting quarterback," Smith said.

FORCE IS FIERY, FUNNY AND NEARLY CHAMPION; 
</P>
<P>
DRAG RACING: AFTER BURNING UP THE TRACK ALL SEASON, HE NEEDS ONLY TO QUALIFY AT 
POMONA THIS WEEKEND FOR THE TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When John Force got off the plane from Texas at Los Angeles International a 
couple of weeks ago, his three daughters greeted him with signs that read, 
"Welcome Home, Champ." They also had empty soft drink cans tied to the back of 
his truck for the drive home to Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
Force was aghast. At least he pretended to be. 
</P>
<P>
"Hide those signs," he said. "It isn't over yet. This is drag racing. Nothing's 
for sure until it's done." 
</P>
<P>
He gathered up the signs and the cans and put them in the bed of the truck. 
They're still there, where they probably will be used very soon. 
</P>
<P>
Force, 18 years after launching his drag racing career as "Brute Force" in an 
old fuel-altered called the L.A. Hooker, is as close to being the National Hot 
Rod Assn.'s Winston funny car champion as he can be. 
</P>
<P>
All he needs is to qualify his Castrol Oldsmobile in the 16-car eliminations at 
the Pomona Fairplex in this weekend's Winston Finals. That will assure him 
enough points to beat Ed (Ace) McCulloch of Hemet for the $150,000 champion's 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the girls meant well, but like I told them, this is drag racing and it 
ain't over yet," Force insisted. "I've been burned before, and you know, I came 
to Pomona in '87 with a good car and didn't make the field. I had seven blower 
explosions in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no guarantees in drag racing." 
</P>
<P>
Force knows. He "guaranteed" Dallas writers earlier in the season that he would 
run under 5.20 seconds for the quarter-mile in the Coca-Cola Funny Car Classic 
at Texas Motorplex. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd run 5.22 at Phoenix and were fast qualifier at Pomona with a 5.26, and I 
knew the Motorplex was the fastest track around with its all-concrete strip, so 
it seemed like a cinch. I told them so. 
</P>
<P>
"When one of the writers challenged me, I told him I'd eat his paper if I 
didn't run in the teens. He printed that, too." 
</P>
<P>
Force strung together runs in the low 5.20s and beat Tom Hoover in a tense 
final, 5.25 to 5.28, but his best was a 5.21 in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have been out celebrating, but my trailer was surrounded by a bunch 
of newspaper guys and their friends who wanted to watch me eat my words," he 
said. "So instead of enjoying myself, I went to the press room and ate the 
article in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
"It tasted terrible. I'm not going to make that mistake again." 
</P>
<P>
Force, 41, has been the dominant force in drag racing this year. He has won 
seven races, equaling the single-season mark set by Don Prudhomme in 1976 and 
Kenny Bernstein in 1987. He has been the low qualifier in 10 of the 18 races. 
And he won the non-points Winston Invitational and the Big Bud Shootout. 
</P>
<P>
With a record like that, it's no wonder his daughters -- Ashley, 7; Brittany, 
4; and Courtney, 2 -- painted their "Welcome Home, Champ" signs, knowing he 
needed only qualify at Pomona to make it official. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, we've left a path of broken parts and burned cars laying in the dirt from 
here to Gainesville, (Fla.) this year and nothing we've done winning those 
seven races will mean a thing at Pomona," Force said. "I know Ace (McCulloch) 
will be trying to put the hex on us, so I'm not taking anything for granted 
until I pull my Olds into the lane for the first round." 
</P>
<P>
Fiery blower explosions have haunted Force all season. 
</P>
<P>
The most spectacular occurred during Saturday qualifying for the NorthStar 
Nationals at Brainerd, Minn. The engine blew and sent a connecting rod out of 
the side of the block, starting a small fire. Seconds later, a second fire 
engulfed the car. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going pretty quick, with one hand on the brakes and one trying to keep 
it off the wall," Force said. "Finally it got too hot, so I went out the escape 
hatch in the roof and fell on my head. That didn't hurt, but it hurt while I 
watched the fire burn the body to the ground. What kept it going was the fumes 
built up inside the clutch area, and friction ignited the titanium clutch 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
"The car was still hot when (crew chief) Austin Coil said we were going to fix 
it. No one could believe we were even going to try, but the crew worked nearly 
all night. All the wiring was burned, the seat was charred and the fiberglass 
was completely destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
"The next day when we showed up with the car still all burned black, the other 
teams figured we were just there to get first-round points. But you know 
something? The way those guys worked gave me such a motivational high that I 
drove better than I'd ever driven." 
</P>
<P>
Force beat McCulloch in the final round. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time we got to the semis, seeing our car all burned and still running 
strong probably psyched out the other guys because by then they knew we were 
serious." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, in the Big Bud Shootout at Indianapolis, Force won the $50,000 
final against Bruce Larson, but when Force let off the throttle at the finish 
line, the supercharger exploded and once again his Olds erupted into a ball of 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the scariest one for me because before I could get myself unhooked 
and out of there, I was running out of oxygen and I could feel the fire burning 
my butt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing you got to say about me, though, is that I leave 'em cheering. It's 
not every guy who goes through the (finish line) lights on fire and wins, too." 
</P>
<P>
After going through an engine during qualifying at Texas Motorplex two weeks 
ago, Force got on the public-address system and apologized to the fans: "I 
can't even get it far enough down the track to set it on fire for you." 
</P>
<P>
Being this close to the championship is a new experience for Force, although he 
has been driving funny cars since he left Bell Gardens High. 
</P>
<P>
"You ask most of the top drivers and they'll tell you they dreamed of winning 
the Winston championship when they were growing up. Not me. I used to watch 
through the fence at Orange County (dragstrip) and my dream was to do a burnout 
like Snake (Prudhomme)." 
</P>
<P>
A burnout is a spectacular pre-race rite in which the driver spins his rear 
wheels in water to heat and clean the tires for better traction. It also 
results in thunderous noise and a huge cloud of steam and smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought if the day ever came when I could smoke my tires that way, I'd be 
the happiest kid in B.G. (Bell Gardens). Then one day I was sitting in a car 
doing my own burnout. But even then I never dreamed of winning anything more 
than a race. It's a good thing I didn't have big dreams because it took me long 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
Force reached the final round nine times between 1979 and 1987 before he 
finally broke through for his first victory, in the '87 Grandnationals. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a career of letting other guys get their first win against me," Force 
said. "Kenny Bernstein, Raymond Beadle, John Lombardo, Tim Grose, John Collins 
all got their first win against me, and Mark Oswald got his first funny car win 
against me." 
</P>
<P>
Force credits Coil and Bob Fisher, his team manager, with the turnaround this 
season. Coil joined the Castrol team several years ago from the Chi-Town 
Hustler team for whom Frank Hawley won Winston funny car championships in 1982 
and '83. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the blowers don't go until we get to the finish line, Coil's doing 
his job," Force said. "He has the expertise, and he's always coming up with new 
ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Coil has always been innovative. A few years ago, when he ran the Chi-Town 
Hustler out of his garage in Chicago, the car was shorter than most other funny 
cars. When asked why, Coil replied that he couldn't make it any longer because 
it wouldn't fit in the garage. 
</P>
<P>
"As it was, the garage was so small that we couldn't put the body panels on the 
frame without moving it outside," Coil recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher is an old truck driver friend of Force who helped him get started in 
racing. They parted eight years ago, but Fisher returned this year shortly 
before the Houston Nationals, the third race of the NHRA season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to say just what Fisher does, but what he does seems to be what 
keeps the team winning," Force said. "Coil runs the team, I do the driving and 
Fisher's the guy who keeps everybody happy. It was the missing ingredient we 
needed to win. When he joined us at Houston we went on a streak. We fight all 
the time, just like we did 18 years ago, but we need his type of personality to 
see us through." 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, with nothing else to do while he waited for the Winston Finals, 
Force took his funny car to Firebird Raceway, near Phoenix, where he won a 
match race against Gary Densham. 
</P>
<P>
Why would he risk demolishing his car in an insignificant match race less than 
a week before he was preparing to win his first national championship? 
</P>

"I just love to drive and I couldn't stand the idea of sitting home when there 
was a race to run," he said. "It's magic for me to sit in a race car. That's 
about all I can say."

Then he added, "Besides, Austin had a few new ideas he wanted to work out."

DOUGLAS' WEIGHT IS OVER; 
</P>
<P>
BOXING: UNDERDOG CHAMPION IS 246 POUNDS FOR TONIGHT'S DEFENSE AGAINST EVANDER 
HOLYFIELD.

<P>
Buster Douglas will defend both his heavyweight championship and his honor here 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
You wouldn't think the man who beat up Mike Tyson for 10 rounds and then 
knocked him out would have to answer questions about his heart, his courage and 
his dedication, but that's the baggage this unlikely champion carries into the 
ring tonight against Evander Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
And that's not the only excess baggage he'll be toting. He weighed in at 246 
pounds Wednesday, far more than the 232-236 most had expected. 
</P>
<P>
Although Douglas will forever be known as the 42-1 shot who dethroned Tyson in 
Japan last February, he still is having to answer for the night of May 30, 
1987, when he suddenly surrendered in a fight he was winning against Tony 
Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
Lingering questions about Douglas' drive -- confirmed again by his weight 
Wednesday -- and his spotty pre-Tyson record had caused oddsmakers to make the 
smaller Holyfield as a narrow favorite. It's one of the few times in this 
century that the challenger has been favored against a heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
Several other aspects of this matchup merit close inspection: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Can a small heavyweight stand up to a big one? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Did Holyfield take too much punishment getting to this, his first 
championship opportunity? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Can this fight, with so much money at stake -- $24,075,000 for Douglas, 
$8,025,000 for Holyfield -- live up to expectations? 
</P>
<P>
Those favoring Douglas lean on the boxing cliche that big men beat up little 
men, other factors being roughly equal. Douglas, at 6-feet-4 and 230 1/2 when 
he won the championship, is the third-biggest heavyweight champion. Only Primo 
Carnera, 6-5 3/4 and 270, and Jess Willard, 6-6 and 245, were both taller and 
heavier when they won or defended heavyweight titles. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas' trainer, J. D. McCauley, has said: "Holyfield is going to find out 
Thursday night what the difference is between a big heavyweight and a little 
one, and he won't like it." 
</P>
<P>
McCauley, in Douglas' corner the day he beat Tyson, dismisses the criticism of 
those who say Douglas gained too much weight in the eight months he has been 
champion. "Buster's the kind of guy who gains weight just walking by a 
restaurant," he said. "But he took it off. He weighed 260 when he went into 
training for the Tyson fight. He's in great shape, believe me." 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield, a bronze medalist at the 1984 Olympics at 178 pounds, is a superbly 
conditioned athlete who has methodically added muscle to his 6-2 frame through 
one of the most sophisticated weight and exercise training programs ever seen 
in boxing. Holyfield had bulked up to cruiserweight, 195 pounds, by 1986 and 
had, by mid-1988, leveled off to about a 210-pound heavyweight with a 
statuesque, sculptured upper body rising over skinny legs. He weighed in at 208 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
So is he a manufactured heavyweight or a big cruiserweight? The jury is hung 
here. At times, he has seemed to possess the power in his busy punching style 
to stop anyone. When he knocked out Brazilian Adilson Rodrigues, a 220-pounder, 
with one punch, Rodrigues' unconscious form vibrated on the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
But Holyfield also landed torrid shots in every round against Michael Dokes and 
Alex Stewart. Dokes finally fell in the 10th round. Stewart never did go down, 
losing on a cut. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in both fights, Holyfield took more punishment than some fighters do 
in a career. He hasn't been knocked down since he was a 16-year-old amateur 
welterweight, though, and unlike Douglas, Holyfield's bravery in combat has 
never been questioned. For Holyfield to lose, they take him out of the ring 
feet first, many have said. 
</P>
<P>
When hurt by either Dokes or Stewart, in by far his two toughest fights, 
Holyfield simply raised his intensity, rather than back down. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, critics have never forgiven Douglas for his performance against 
Tucker in 1987. In a fight for the vacant International Boxing Federation 
heavyweight title, Douglas was ahead on all cards when he seemed to tire. 
Tucker drove him to the ropes with a flurry of punches. Douglas covered up, 
failing to punch back, and the fight was stopped. 
</P>
<P>
After that, even relatives asked him when he was going to forget about boxing. 
</P>
<P>
It was largely because of that performance that he went off at 42-1 against 
Tyson. When he won the championship that afternoon in Tokyo, Douglas said he 
understood the criticism after the Tucker debacle. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't blame any of you (reporters) for anything you said about me after that 
fight because you could only go by what you saw, and what you saw that night 
was not the real Buster Douglas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas blamed personal problems for hindering his preparation in his four 
losses: against Tucker, David Bey, Mike White and Jesse Ferguson. His record is 
30-4-1, but 7-0 since Tucker. This matchup appears to be a good one for style, 
one that should result in an exciting, free-swinging punch-out, given 
Holyfield's aggressiveness and Douglas' unquestioned hitting power. 
</P>
<P>
But this is also one of the richest prize fights. With so much money at stake, 
some free-swingers have been known to veer into the slow lane and pursue a 
safety-first fight. Roberto Duran made nearly everyone unhappy by spending an 
evening here last year against Ray Leonard basically keeping his chin hidden. 
</P>
<P>
Against Tyson, with nothing to lose, Douglas fought with abandon and 
aggressiveness. But he's really fighting for two more bouts tonight. His 
two-fight deal with Mirage owner Steve Wynn is worth $60 million, contingent 
upon beating Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
If he does, he gets Tyson in early 1991 for $36 million. And if Holyfield wins 
tonight, he's looking at either $19 million for a bout with George Foreman or a 
mandatory defense against Tyson for roughly the same purse. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, John Johnson, a former Ohio State graduate assistant football coach 
under Woody Hayes, took over as Douglas' manager. Douglas was 21-2 and had just 
been stopped by Mike White. Further, Douglas was an emotional wreck, having 
just fired his father, Bill Douglas, as his trainer. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and Douglas had their first manager-fighter meeting in Johnson's living 
room, and Johnson recalls it this way: 
</P>
<P>
"I put a paper plate in front of Buster that had nothing on it, and I said to 
him: 'Right now, that's what we got, partner. But if you work very hard, that 
plate will contain millions some day.' " 
</P>

ANGELS FIRE STUBING, BRING IN HINES, REBERGER AS COACHES

Moose Stubing, who was a minor league coach and manager for the Angels before 
becoming their third base coach for nearly six years, was released Wednesday in 
a shuffling of scouts and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Stubing, with the Angels' organization since 1968, most recently served as the 
Angels' first base coach after having been shifted from third base on Aug. 17. 
</P>
<P>
He was 0-8 as the interim manager in 1988 after Cookie Rojas was fired. 
</P>
<P>
Stubing will be replaced by Bruce Hines, who was a scout, rookie league manager 
and roving defensive instructor for the Angels. Hines is the son of Dodger 
batting instructor Ben Hines. 
</P>
<P>
Stubing, 52, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
One-time major league pitcher Frank Reberger, formerly a roving minor league 
pitching instructor for the Angels, was named bullpen coach, succeeding Joe 
Coleman, who became pitching coach for the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels also hired Bob Harrison, who was a major league special assignment 
scout for the Seattle Mariners, to perform the same role for them. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Max Venable filed for free agency Wednesday, one of 50 major league 
players to do so in the 15-day "window" after the World Series. Venable, who 
hit .259 in 93 games, had said before the season ended he that hoped to be 
re-signed.

<TEXT>
<P>
To the scales at the Mirage hotel Wednesday afternoon, it must have felt like 
George Foreman instead of Buster Douglas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's obvious what Buster has been doing since knocking out Mike Tyson in Tokyo 
Feb. 10. Eating. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And it's obvious what Evander Holyfield has been doing since knocking out 
Seamus McDonagh in Atlantic City June 1. Training. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What we may have here tonight is a classic matchup of the undertrained against 
the overtrained. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If you still like Douglas, you've got to like him by early knockout. Otherwise, 
his own flab -- and Holyfield -- figure to wear him down and out. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Before Douglas lost the battle of the bulge, Angelo Dundee, trainer of 
champions, picked Buster by an eighth-round knockout. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Douglas will dominate from the opening bell," Dundee said. "Oddly enough, 
here's a case of the bigger man being more mobile and having a better jab than 
the smaller man. In fact, Holyfield doesn't have a jab. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Holyfield will be standing there on a dime, and Douglas will unloosen his 
foundation," Dundee said. "Holyfield has a good right counter and fast hands, 
but he'll have to punch up. Very early, it will be apparent that Douglas is too 
strong for him. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Holyfield is a courageous guy who's in great shape, but he'll take too much 
punishment," Dundee said. "He'll go down from an uppercut in the fifth and then 
again in the eighth. . . . "The ref will have to stop it. Simply a case of a 
big man beating a small man." . . . 
</P>
<P>
However, those who spring colossal upsets to win heavyweight championships 
usually don't keep the title long. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ingemar Johansson was knocked out by Floyd Patterson in the rematch and in 
their third fight. James J. Braddock was knocked out by Joe Louis after 
shocking Max Baer. Jersey Joe Walcott beat Ezzard Charles again but was knocked 
out by Rocky Marciano in his next fight. Leon Spinks lost the rematch to 
Muhammad Ali. Michael Spinks won the rematch from Larry Holmes but was 
flattened by Mike Tyson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Then there was Cassius Marcellus Clay, who stunned Sonny Liston and 
successfully defended the title nine times before refusing induction into the 
armed services. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Eddie Futch is bullish on his Riddick Bowe, who will box Bert Cooper on 
the undercard tonight. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Bowe is the best young heavyweight in the world," Futch said. "He has 
everything you would want -- size, mobility and punching power in either hand. 
Within a year, he'll be ready for a title shot." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Frank Bruno, the erstwhile British challenger, is earning $1 million a year in 
endorsements and commercials and is being advised to stay out of the ring. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Ring announcer Sugar Ray Leonard's European tour is off and, instead, he will 
challenge World Boxing Council junior middleweight champion Terry Norris in Las 
Vegas or Reno in late January or early February. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Conspicuously absent from prefight ceremonies tonight will be Jose Sulaiman. 
The WBC long ago scheduled its annual convention in the Canary Islands for this 
week. But you can be sure el presidente will have a representative here to 
collect the sanction fee. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The ring at the Mirage looks small. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Douglas is being guaranteed $24 million, to $8 million for Holyfield, but often 
the ratio is even larger than 3-1 in favor of the champion over the challenger. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
I miss 15-round fights. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Between them, Douglas and Holyfield have had three fights in the past 15 
months. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It will be cool tonight at the outdoor arena, but there shouldn't be any need 
for blankets like the one Leonard wore over his shoulders between rounds of the 
Roberto Duran fight. . . . Both camps would like to return to Las Vegas in 
April -- for Douglas-Mike Tyson at the Mirage, Holyfield-George Foreman at 
Caesars Palace. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Until the weigh-in, this figured to be the closest betting for a heavyweight 
title fight since Larry Holmes-Ken Norton in 1978. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Mills Lane will be the referee, although a bigger man, Richard Steele, would be 
able to handle heavyweights better. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bob Arum says he's picking the favorite in the big fight tonight -- Michael 
Carbajal over Luis Monzote at Phoenix.

The FBI agent told him there would be no turning back and no guarantee of 
asylum, but Arsen Djavadian felt he had no choice. The Soviet diver fled the 
Goodwill Games in Seattle with the help of a stranger, then hid out in 
Hollywood with a boyhood friend from his native Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
Until last weekend, when he received employment authorization, Djavadian 
(Ja-VAD-ee-an) was afraid to tell his story for fear that he would be sent back 
to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Djavadian's defection was not without cost. Since he abandoned his country on 
Aug. 4, his father, Boris, was fired as a government economist, and his 
brother, Aram, was kicked out of the university he was attending. 
</P>
<P>
But the diver's defection came as no surprise to the Soviets. Djavadian, 23, 
was jailed twice last year for organizing and participating in demonstrations 
protesting the Soviet government's refusal to unite the Nagorno Karabakh 
district in Azerbaijan with the adjacent Soviet republic of Armenia, which 
borders Turkey and Iran. 
</P>
<P>
The Armenian residents of Nagorno Karabakh -- 80% of the population -- claim 
that they are discriminated against in Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
Djavadian, who once rejected a medal, throwing it to the ground in protest of 
Soviet treatment of Armenians, is one of many Armenians who want independence 
from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"I want it, so I'm not afraid to say it," Djavadian said. 
</P>
<P>
His outspokenness nearly cost him an indefinite period in jail. After three 
weeks of horrible treatment last October, he was bailed out by an Armenian 
coach who convinced police that the Soviet diving team needed him. Then the 
coach told Djavadian that if he ever joined the Armenian protest movement 
again, the KGB would leave him in jail to rot. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly, Djavadian, the 1989 World Cup bronze medalist, concluded that freedom 
would require more daring than the handstand dives he performs off the 10-meter 
platform. He decided to leave his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was to defect at the Goodwill Games, although Djavadian had no idea 
how he would do it. 
</P>
<P>
His non-Soviet competitors offered to help, engaging St. Louis sports promoter 
Joe Farrell, who agreed to facilitate Djavadian's escape from the athletes' 
village on the University of Washington campus in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to keep communication to an absolute minimum," Farrell said. "We didn't 
want to be seen together. They were already suspicious that (Djavadian) would 
seek political asylum, and he had been warned. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt his roommate was in some informing post, because he was the trainer 
instead of another diver." 
</P>
<P>
Farrell's initial contact with Djavadian was through a European diver who 
served as a messenger. A secret meeting was set up for Aug. 3 for Djavadian, 
Farrell, an FBI agent, an Immigration and Naturalization Service representative 
and an interpreter of Russian. An Armenian interpreter was available by phone. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was designed to answer Djavadian's questions while allowing him the 
opportunity to change his mind without the Soviets finding out that he had 
considered defecting. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell told Djavadian to put on a warmup suit and meet him at a drugstore 
three blocks from the athletes' village. Farrell watched Djavadian leave the 
village, made sure he was not followed, then met him. 
</P>
<P>
From there, they took a circuitous car ride to Farrell's hotel. 
</P>
<P>
After the three-hour meeting, Farrell gave Djavadian souvenirs to carry back to 
the village in case he was questioned about his whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
Later that day, Djavadian told the messenger to tell Farrell that he wanted to 
go through with the defection. It was planned for the day before the 
competition. "We were leaving the next day (after the competition)," Djavadian 
said. "Everybody knows about my (political) thinking. They would be watching 
me. Many people are KGB. They know about me." 
</P>
<P>
That night, Farrell and another diver took a rug that Djavadian had brought to 
sell from Djavadian's room. Farrell took the rug ahead of time so Djavadian 
would not look conspicuous carrying it out of the village. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, Djavadian walked to the drugstore with all he could stuff 
into a small duffel bag. He met Farrell and rode with him to Seattle-Tacoma 
International Airport. A friend of Farrell followed by car, making sure they 
weren't followed by anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared," Djavadian said. "I was thinking maybe some people are going to 
take me and give me back. I blocked everything out of my mind. All I was 
thinking about was coming to Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Farrell took Djavadian in through a side door at the airport and hid him in a 
men's room until the other passengers had boarded the plane bound for Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought there would be KGB at the airport," said Farrell, who had used his 
name to reserve Djavadian's ticket. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a lot of precautions because the stakes were pretty high. You could 
look at it from the outside and say it looked too spy-like, but the FBI agent 
and the immigration authority told us if they took him back he would probably 
be incarcerated." 
</P>
<P>
Djavadian was terrified on the flight. 
</P>
<P>
"People were looking at me on the plane," he said. "I was thinking, maybe they 
are KGB. When we landed I was feeling better." 
</P>
<P>
Hakop Adajian, the Armenian friend and former coach who met him at LAX, said 
Djavadian told him: "Take me out of here." 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'There is no problem. You are in America.' " 
</P>
<P>
When Djavadian missed practice later that day, the Soviet delegation began 
searching. But the search was called off when the coach found an unsigned note, 
written by Farrell, saying that Djavadian was safe but would be remaining in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The soft-spoken Djavadian is still on edge: "Not too much, but still a little 
bit scared," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Djavadian is guilt-stricken about the way his family has been treated but is 
hopeful that if he gains citizenship -- which normally requires a five-year 
wait -- his family will have a better chance of earning refugee status and 
joining him here. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility remains, however, that Djavadian will be sent back to the 
Soviet Union. In February, the INS is expected to decide whether to grant him 
immigrant status. 
</P>
<P>
In his application for political asylum, Djavadian claims to have been 
persecuted for being Armenian and for his political and religious beliefs -- he 
was not allowed to practice the Catholic faith in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Even within the Soviet diving team there was discrimination, according to 
Djavadian. He said that the Russian divers were given better food and sports 
clothing and a larger monthly stipend than Armenians. And when the team 
traveled, the Russians were given separate rooms, whereas the Armenians shared 
single, smaller rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Djavadian concludes the application by saying: "Armenia is presently in a state 
of turmoil with civil unrest. I believe the Soviets are using my relatives as 
an example and punishing them as a result of my staying in the United States. I 
fear that I will be imprisoned for the remainder of my life if forced to return 
to the Soviet Union or Armenia." 
</P>
<P>
According to Djavadian's attorney, William Bennett, this case would have been 
an "absolute slam dunk" two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"But now that the political winds have changed, it is now somewhat in 
question," Bennett said. "The history has been that a Soviet public figure who 
is successful defecting has been granted asylum freely. But the change in 
politics may affect his case. I hope not. He's suffered already and his family 
is suffering." 
</P>
<P>
If Djavadian's application is denied, there is a lengthy appeal process. 
Another alternative is an immigrant visa. 
</P>
<P>
Djavadian, who is now working as an assistant coach at Gymnastic Olympica in 
Van Nuys, would have to prove that his job requires exceptional qualifications. 
Certainly, Djavadian is uniquely versed in the Soviet diving method, which 
emphasizes trampoline work and gymnastic drills. 
</P>
<P>
But even if he is allowed to stay, Djavadian cannot compete internationally for 
five years under international rules. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a major decision for him because his whole life is diving," Farrell 
said. "He's given it up for now. For someone to achieve that talent level and 
(to have) had the success he's had, to give it all up is a major move. I don't 
know that I would have the guts." 
</P>
<P>
According to Don Leas of the U.S. Diving rules committee, the only exception to 
the five-year wait is if the Soviet Union releases him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure the Soviets won't do that right now," Leas said. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet diving officials were unavailable for comment, and Djavadian's former 
coach in Armenia, Hrach Chandirian, said he could not answer a question 
relating to Djavadian's status. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want any trouble," Chandirian said. "If he goes and lives there, that 
is very good. His life must be good and my life must be good." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the Soviets released Djavadian, he could not compete in the U.S. 
nationals or Olympic trials until he is a U.S. citizen, which requires at least 
a five-year wait unless Bennett and co-counsel Jodeane Barlow Farrell, Joe 
Farrell's sister-in-law, successfully petition Congress to pass a private law 
for Djavadian. 
</P>
<P>
"They've done that before, particularly for athletes," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Djavadian can compete in local, regional, invitational and 
exhibition meets for Gymnastic Olympica under Coach Dennis Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Although Djavadian has only competed in platform diving because the Soviets 
specialize, Taylor believes Djavadian can excel on the one-meter and 
three-meter springboards as well. 
</P>
<P>
"He's probably the best one-meter diver I've ever seen, and yet he's never 
practiced it," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford Coach Rick Schavone fears that five years away from international 
competition could be too much to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
"This sport is in such a dynamic stage, I don't know if he could stay up with 
the list," Schavone said of the more difficult dives that will develop. 
</P>
<P>
But after all Djavadian has been through, he might have the patience to survive 
a five-year delay. 
</P>
<P>
"I can wait," Djavadian said. "I want to dive in the Olympics because I have 
been 16 years in this sport and have never competed in the Olympic Games."

IS PALMER BIDDING ADIEU TO RANCHO PARK?; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF: COURSE HOLDS MANY MEMORIES FOR HIM, BUT TOURNAMENT NEXT WEEK MAY BE HIS 
LAST IN LOS ANGELES. 
</P>

<P>
He doesn't admit it and his legion of followers won't hear of it, but the man 
most responsible for making golf what it is today may be on his 
thanks-for-the-memory tour. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Palmer, 61, might have started the journey when he made his final 
appearance in the British Open in July. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer had revived interest in the dying tournament 30 years ago. And when he 
strode up the 18th fairway at St. Andrews this summer, there were tears and 
raucous cheers. Palmer was ending that phase of his life at the place where the 
sport began. 
</P>
<P>
There will be regrets, among players as well as fans, when he plays his last 
round in competition. He may postpone it a bit because Arnie's Army pleads with 
him to continue. 
</P>
<P>
After his contribution to the PGA Tour many years ago, Palmer's presence turned 
the senior tour into an unexpected bonanza for the 50-and-older set. 
</P>
<P>
As Chi Chi Rodriguez put it, long ago: "Every professional golfer should say a 
prayer of thanks for Arnold Palmer. That player also should give a portion of 
his earnings to him. Without Arnold, there isn't golf as we know it." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer, who won the Senior Skins last January but hasn't won a senior tour 
tournament since 1988 -- he last won on the regular tour in 1973 -- could be 
making his last appearance in a Los Angeles tournament next week. He will play 
in the $500,000 Security Pacific Senior Classic, benefiting Centinela 
Hospital's Childrens' Charity Fund. 
</P>
<P>
It will be played at Rancho Park where he has memories galore -- and not all 
good. 
</P>
<P>
Most memorable was a 12 he took on the 18th hole on Jan. 6, 1961, at the city 
public course that for years was the site of the Los Angeles Open. Palmer was 
near the peak of his colorful career, and his failure there was so unusual that 
a plaque was erected to commemorate the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
But there have been some outstanding moments there, too. 
</P>
<P>
Before the event moved to Riviera Country Club, Palmer won the Los Angeles Open 
three times at Rancho. He came from three strokes behind in the last round to 
win in 1963, and in 1966 he shot a course-record 62. In 1967 he had an 
incredible 267 total and won by five shots. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer followers will probably never forget the 1983 L.A. Open, held at Rancho 
because the PGA was being played at Riviera that year. It was Palmer's last 
real bid for victory on the regular PGA tour. 
</P>
<P>
After 54 holes, Palmer, then 53, was 10 under par and only one shot out of the 
lead. For the final round, 26,000 showed up, many to root him home. 
</P>
<P>
With a 30-foot birdie putt on the fifth hole Palmer went into the lead. But 
putting problems, which have plagued him much of his career since, slowly 
erased his hopes of a victory. 
</P>
<P>
He lost the lead on the ninth hole, and when it was obvious he couldn't win by 
the 14th, most of the gallery left Rancho. Gil Morgan was practically without 
an audience when he clinched the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to returning to Rancho," Palmer said. "The 12 I made 
doesn't come close to wiping out all the pleasant memories. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't played well this year, but it's mostly lack of concentration. I can 
still make all the shots. Physically, I am in better shape than in years. But I 
really do some strange things out there. Things you don't do if you have the 
proper concentration. 
</P>
<P>
"I am so busy these days, building golf courses all over the world, that I just 
don't have time to practice. I am taking off on a 10-country tour to inspect 
courses, so naturally I won't touch a golf club. 
</P>
<P>
"But I will have some time to work on my game before coming to Rancho, so maybe 
I'll do well. Physically, I am fine. One thing's for sure, I will play that 
hole at Rancho the same way I did in 1961." 
</P>
<P>
The 505-yard par-5, a slight dogleg left, is the 18th for regular patrons of 
Rancho. But for tournaments, the nines are switched and it becomes the ninth 
hole. There is a driving range with a high fence on the right and a road on the 
left. 
</P>
<P>
It was Palmer's last hole of the second round on Jan. 6, 1961. He drove the 
ball 275 yards up the middle of the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
"The plaque says it was the first round, but it was the second," Palmer 
recalled. "I knew that I needed a birdie for a 68, and an eagle would put me 
close to the lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I went for the green in two, using a three-wood. It soared over the fence into 
the driving range." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he didn't then play it safe, Palmer said, "Well, I still had a chance 
to make par." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer hit the next shot into the road on the left, then stubbornly hit two 
more out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to make a tough putt just to get my 12," he said, laughing. "Instead of 
being close to the lead, I missed the cut. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you could say there was no lasting effect. I won the next two 
tournaments on the tour and then had three winning tournaments at Rancho in 
future years. I've always enjoyed playing there." 
</P>
<P>
He admits to having an especially good feeling about 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a good tournament for us older guys," he said. "Gene Littler, who was 
52, led after 54 holes at 11 under par. George Archer, 43, broke the course 
record with a 61 and tied for the lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I never saw a more excited crowd for the final round. In fact, it was almost 
scary, trying to get from the ninth green to the 10th tee. There was a terrible 
jam." 
</P>
<P>
Littler, Archer and leading money winner Lee Trevino are expected to join 
Palmer at Rancho in one of the last senior tour events this year. 
</P>
<P>
As seniors, they have seen Palmer help change golf from a happy-go-lucky, 
elitist sport to big business for the masses, and now they see that raised 
social consciousness has accompanied that change. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the top names in professional golf tried to ignore the controversy over 
civil rights that erupted before the PGA championship this summer, but Palmer 
couldn't. After it was revealed that there were no black members at Shoal Creek 
where the PGA was scheduled, the senior and regular tours, the PGA and the USGA 
changed their rules governing selection of future tournament sites. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer conceded that some private clubs would probably continue to restrict 
membership if they don't hold public functions on their courses. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are doing a public golf tournament, you bring the issue to yourself," 
Palmer said. "If you have a golf tournament, you have to let the general public 
in. Such a course must make memberships available, no matter race or gender. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the issue will be with us for some time. But ultimately, I don't think 
it will affect the game that much. Golf will survive it." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer said he personally had never noticed much racism in golf, and had played 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess with so many more people playing golf, we're being made more aware of 
it," he said. "The game is growing rapidly in this country, but in Europe and 
the Pacific Rim, it is growing even faster."

THE TRUTH OF THE MOMENT IS THAT HYPE IS HUGE

<DATELINE>
<P>
LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am standing in a huge ballroom in a huge hotel in a city symbolized by a 
basketball coach nicknamed Tark the Shark. I am here, in the midst of perhaps 
2,000 other people, waiting for two large men to stand on a scale in their 
underwear and be weighed. 
</P>
<P>
Mothers, don't let your children grow up to be sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
This is the weigh-in for tonight's Buster Douglas-Evander Holyfield fight. Call 
it the little deal before the big deal. The fight has been billed as "The 
Moment of Truth." That makes the weigh-in "The Hour of Baloney." 
</P>
<P>
Much has been written about boxing's hype, but you have to really be there to 
appreciate it. Make that be disgusted by it. 
</P>
<P>
The marriage of boxing and Las Vegas was made in heaven. For every phony sport, 
there ought to be a phony city. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder why anybody even cares what these two large gladiators weigh. It's not 
like the other divisions in boxing, where it matters because they have a limit 
on what they can weigh before they are allowed to fight. No, these are 
heavyweights. In this category, sumo wrestlers may apply. 
</P>
<P>
Remember Tony Tubbs when he fought Mike Tyson for a minute or so in Tokyo? He 
was a heavyweight whose name fit his body. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder about my own business. There are cameras here, cameras there, cameras, 
cameras everywhere. Has our whole world been reduced to a sound bite? 
</P>
<P>
And my print media colleagues, why, some of them actually sprint to the phones 
when the weights of the two large men in their underwear are announced. Did 
Babe Ruth die? Is it huge news that one of the two huge men has turned out to 
be even huger than everybody thought he'd be? And is huger a word, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
I wonder, as I watch Douglas and Holyfield enter the room, why all these huge 
men who box in these matches never go anywhere without an entourage of about 15 
other huge men. Do these fighters really need extra protection? Who are they 
being protected from, 100 sportswriters with bad eyes? 
</P>
<P>
And what about those in the entourages? What do they list on their resumes 
under current occupation? Leech? Parasite? CEO for entourages? 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if I'm not actually enjoying this more than I care to admit. There are 
such great moments of high comedy. Holyfield weighs a predictable 208, but 
Douglas weighs 246. Goodyear can no longer claim exclusivity in the blimp 
market. 
</P>
<P>
So the aftermath of "Moment of Truth -- Weigh-In" begins. A man named Jeffrey 
Milgrom, who passes out business cards identifying himself as the director of 
marketing and promotions for Buster the Blimp, says: "He had a big breakfast." 
</P>
<P>
Lou Duva, Holyfield's trainer, says: "It's a good thing there's any food left 
at all in the hotel." 
</P>
<P>
And J. D. McCauley, Douglas' uncle and trainer, says: "As long as I've been 
around him, he's been 236. But we've never weighed him, not once. I know my 
nephew's body. He's 236. Somebody bumped the scale." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, I wonder if this isn't all just a grand scheme to further line the 
pockets of the people who really get fat from all this, the hotel and casino 
owners. In the hour after Douglas weighs in larger than life, $120,000 is bet 
on Holyfield in the Mirage hotel sports book alone. Two lines of bettors wait 
for as long as 15 minutes to pay homage, and dollars, to the sleekness of 
Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
Which makes me wonder if somebody did bump the scale. And that makes me wonder 
all sorts of other things that I don't want to even begin wondering about.

KULTI EARNS BIGGEST UPSET, BEATING AGASSI, 6-3, 7-5

Nicklas Kulti, the 1989 world junior champion, earned the biggest victory of 
his short career Wednesday, upsetting third-seeded Andre Agassi, 6-3, 7-5, in 
the second round of the Stockholm Open. 
</P>
<P>
"I played incredibly well, especially on my backhand," said Kulti, a 
19-year-old Swede ranked 76th in the world. "But I don't think he played 100%." 
</P>
<P>
Agassi, a finalist in both the French and U.S. Opens this year, did not. He was 
playing his first match in three weeks after straining his lower back in early 
October. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not as prepared as I could have been," said Agassi, ranked fourth in the 
world. "I was hoping to get through the early matches to get into the groove. 
But that's expecting a lot when you haven't played a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed, but he beat me fair and square."

Stefan Edberg, the world's top-ranked player, rallied from a slow start to beat 
Mats Wilander, 6-4, 6-3. Boris Becker, No. 2 seeded, dropped only two games, 
but John McEnroe was extended to three sets in other second-round matches. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander, meeting Edberg for the first time since losing to him in the 
Australian Open semifinals in January, raced to a 4-1 lead in the first set. 
</P>
<P>
But Edberg was only one service break down and "I was never really worried, 
although I was a little bit nervous early on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, the 1988 champion from Germany, defeated Darren Cahill of Australia, 
6-2, 6-0, winning 10 consecutive points to pull away from 2-2 in the opening 
set. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, playing in Stockholm for the first time since 1985 -- when he won a 
record fourth singles title -- beat Karel Novacek, 6-2, 6-7 (3-7), 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe said he didn't lose concentration in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
"I basically choked," he said. "He picked up on my serve and guessed pretty 
well. His confidence picked up and suddenly it was a totally different match." 
</P>
<P>
Steffi Graf advanced to the quarterfinals of the Brighton, England, WITA 
tournament with a 6-4, 6-2 victory over Nathalie Herreman of France.

Soviet player Viktoria Milvidskaia, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5), and fifth-seeded Nathalie 
Tauziat of France overwhelmed Britain's Sarah Loosemore, 6-1, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Unseeded Florencia Labat used a strong baseline game to oust fifth-seeded 
Raffaela Reggi, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4), for the second upset in two days at the 
$150,000 Puerto Rico Open at San Juan. 
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded Amy Frazier had fallen to South African Elna Reinach Tuesday 
night.

NEWSWIRE: AFTER 18 YEARS, RED SOX NO LONGER WANT EVANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dwight Evans, mainstay in right field at Fenway Park for almost all of his 18 
seasons, won't be back with the Boston Red Sox in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, one of the most popular Red Sox, has one of the most respected throwing 
arms in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
He learned Wednesday that Boston was not going to exercise an option on his 
contract at $1.3 million for next season. The buyout cost the Red Sox $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who turns 39 on Nov. 3, has been plagued by a persistent lower back 
problem for about a year, and it limited him to a designated-hitter role this 
season. He batted .249 in 123 games with 13 home runs and 63 runs batted in as 
the Red Sox won the American League East title. 
</P>
<P>
Evans' 2,505 games with Boston were second only to Hall of Famer Carl 
Yastrzemski. He has 379 home runs and 1,346 runs batted in.

BRIAN BROWN HAS RISEN FROM THE DEPTHS; 
</P>
<P>
UCLA: SENIOR HAS FIRM HOLD ON TAILBACK JOB, WITH THREE 100-YARD GAMES IN THE 
PAST FOUR WEEKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brian Brown knows all about the depth chart, which lists a football team's 
normal order of substitution. The UCLA tailback has been on the bottom, in the 
middle and at the top -- where he is now and intends to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Perseverance and unwavering faith in himself have motivated Brown when he 
apparently didn't fit into the plans of coaching staffs. A senior, Brown was 
listed behind Kevin Williams and ahead of Shawn Wills at the start of the 
season, but Williams hurt his ankle in the first game, then suffered a lower 
back injury and has been virtually inactive since. 
</P>
<P>
Brown has been the starting tailback since the third game against Michigan and 
has been effective and consistent on a team with a 3-4 record. 
</P>
<P>
He has gained 518 yards for an average of 4.9 yards a carry, and has scored 
five touchdowns. He rushed for 100 or more yards in three consecutive games and 
barely fell short with 93 yards in UCLA's 38-31 loss to California Saturday at 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
It would seem, finally, that Brown, a relatively small tailback at 5 feet 10 
and 186 pounds, has job security. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of in a do-or-die situation, because I had aspirations of going on 
to the next level (pro football)," Brown said of his outlook at the start of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
"Up to this point, I wasn't satisfied with my career. It was up and down more 
than it has been up. I just tried to take it week by week instead of looking 
into the future." 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore in 1987, Brown got an opportunity to play when Gaston Green was 
injured. He made the most of it, rushing for 421 yards, a 5.3 average, and 
scoring one of his four touchdowns on a 74-yard run against Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
Then in 1988, he missed the first five games because of a hamstring injury. 
However, he recovered to lead the team in rushing in each of the final three 
regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Wills was regarded as the tailback of the future after gaining 120 
yards against Arkansas in the Cotton Bowl. And when Williams came in last year 
as a redshirt freshman, Brown was seemingly the odd man out. 
</P>
<P>
"It was always like Wills, Williams and Brown, so I was kind of in the back 
spotlight," Brown said. "That didn't bother me because I knew I had to keep my 
head up and keep trying." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Brown started five games in 1989, sharing playing time with 
Williams and Wills. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in myself and that I can overcome any obstacles," Brown said. "When 
Shawn first came in (1988), I was hurt. Shawn got a chance to shine and he did 
real well. Kevin had a lot of buildup coming out of high school." 
</P>
<P>
Wills, probably the most elusive of the three tailbacks, has seen only spot 
duty this season. The position has been secured by Brown, at last. 
</P>
<P>
Brown graduated from Gardena High, the same school that produced Gaston Green. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to UCLA with Heisman (hopes) and to have all those yards rushing," 
Brown said. "It never works out the way you want it to. If it works out in the 
end, that's all that matters. . . . Things (happen), like getting hurt and not 
getting to start when you feel it's your chance. It kind of gets to you. As 
long as I improve and, hopefully, get better, I'll be satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
While praising Brown's effort and attitude, UCLA Coach Terry Donahue has said 
that the running back doesn't always fall forward when hit, because of his 
size. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think my size matters, as far as being big enough," Brown said. "I've 
never backed down from any defender, no matter how big they are. I seem to get 
stronger as I go through a game. As for falling forward, when you get hit by 
four people, it's kind of hard not to fall backward." 
</P>
<P>
There has been one constant in Brown's collegiate career. He is an outstanding 
kickoff return specialist, with a knack for finding the right lane and 
exploding through it even though he doesn't have a sprinter's speed. 
</P>
<P>
He is the all-time UCLA leader in kickoff returns with 1,416 yards. He needs 34 
yards to break the single-season record of 489 yards set by Wally Henry in 
1975. 
</P>
<P>
So, Brown has always been assured of playing, at least on the kickoff return 
team. Now he's also the tailback in the UCLA system, averaging 24.5 carries 
over the past four games. 
</P>
<P>
With a 2-2 Pacific 10 Conference record heading into Saturday's game against 
Oregon State at the Rose Bowl, the Bruins appear to be struggling. 
</P>
<P>
As for Brown, his career has finally stabilized just when time was running out.

JACKSON'S LUCK CHANGING AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bruce Jackson was hoping to make his New York training debut in the Breeders' 
Cup Mile on Saturday with the Irish colt In Excess. Unfortunately, In Excess 
was one of several horses locked out of the Mile because of the large number of 
entries. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend at Keeneland in Lexington, Ky., Jackson was brimming with 
confidence as he sent out the English filly Native Twine in the Queen Elizabeth 
Challenge Cup. But something went wrong, and Native Twine finished last. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the Jackson colt Jovial was considered the best 3-year-old in the West 
after consecutive victories in the Cinema and Swaps Stakes at Hollywood Park. 
Jovial was being pointed for the $1-million Travers Stakes and a host of other 
major events when he was stricken by a serious stomach ailment. 
</P>
<P>
Lumped together, the three incidents would provide most trainers with a good 
start on an ulcer. But Jackson, a veteran of the thoroughbred and quarter horse 
wars, simply shrugs and looks down his stable roster for the next batter. 
</P>
<P>
"Good horses make the difference," Jackson said at Santa Anita. "They answer a 
lot of worries." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, those three sad tales all have happy endings, in varying degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating the capacity Breeders' Cup Mile crowd, Jackson ran In Excess at 
Santa Anita last Sunday in the Volante Handicap. The colt won easily. 
</P>
<P>
Native Twine came out of her Keeneland race fine and will run at Santa Anita on 
Nov. 4 in the $400,000 Yellow Ribbon Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
And Jovial, after flirting with a dangerous case of colitis, is training again 
toward what could be a banner 4-year-old campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very sick horse," Jackson said as Jovial returned to the barn after a 
gallop. "It turned out something was killing all the bacteria in his stomach. 
They had to treat him with a lot of antibiotics, then pump him full of stuff 
that would restore his system -- dairy cultures, things like that. He's in good 
health now, but I'm not about to rush him. I want him feeling strong before we 
put any pressure on him." 
</P>
<P>
In Excess, also a 3-year-old, has been impressive. The Volante was his second 
stakes win in four starts since arriving from England in July. In Excess has 
run only on grass, but Jackson trains him on the dirt and claims he will be a 
better main-track horse than Jovial, who came to this country as a turf runner. 
</P>
<P>
"Jovial didn't like it at all," Jackson said of the dirt track. "We had to 
teach him to handle it. But In Excess loves it. Eddie Delahoussaye worked him a 
mile once at Del Mar in 1:34 and change. I asked him to guess the time and he 
said, 'Oh, about 1:38.' That's how easy he did it." 
</P>
<P>
As for Native Twine, Jackson took all the blame for her Keeneland failure. 
</P>
<P>
"When she got here from England she had a cut on the left side of her mouth," 
the trainer said. "I had it healed, but just in case there was still some 
tenderness I left the bit a little bit loose. So what happens? She flips her 
tongue over the bit and stops running." 
</P>
<P>
This year, Jackson has for the most part been successfully applying his 
know-how with American horses to a wave of foreign runners. Jackson and his 
primary patron, real estate developer Jack Munari of Palos Verdes, have tapped 
into the pipeline of British bloodstock agent Richard Duggan. 
</P>
<P>
Duggan has a reputation for finding potential European talent for American 
clients on a budget that does not require oil money or small fortunes. Jackson 
is a believer. 
</P>
<P>
"While most guys are watching replays from races around here, Richard is 
studying tapes from England and France," he said. "In Excess bolted in a race 
at Royal Ascot and embarrassed his owner, so he was up for sale. We've got a 
filly named Hunting Party who finished second to Salsabil -- before Salsabil 
became the best filly in Europe. The horses are there, and he knows where to 
look." 
</P>
<P>
Has Jackson changed his methods to accommodate his new brood of foreign-trained 
runners? 
</P>
<P>
"Not really," he said. "It's the ability of the horse that really makes the 
difference. I did make a whirlwind trip to England and France last spring, and 
that was valuable. I was able to see what horses go through earlier in their 
careers. That way, I can understand better how they might act later when they 
get over here." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of trainer Roger Stein's request to have a 976 handicapping line, 
the California Horse Racing Board is investigating all licensees (owners, 
trainers, etc.) who also make public selections in any form. CHRB Executive 
Secretary Dennis Hutcheson said the board plans to enforce a strict 
interpretation of the rule against such practices, but he left open the 
possibility of a rule change down the line.

"She suffered a stifle injury," trainer Chuck Jenda said from Bay Meadows. 
"Although it isn't a serious injury, it will interrupt her training, and since 
the Yellow Ribbon was going to be her last race anyway, we've retired her." 
</P>
<P>
Unbeaten in five races against her own sex last year, Brown Bess, won only one 
of six starts in 1990. In what turned out to be her 36th and final start, she 
was second in the California Jockey Club Handicap Oct. 6 at Bay Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
Brown Bess will be sent to Harris Farms in Coalinga. 
</P>
<P>
Ruhlmann, the 23-1 upset winner in the Santa Anita Handicap last winter, has 
also been retired. He will stand in California at Cardiff Stud Farm. 
</P>
<P>
Ruhlmann, a 5-year-old son of Mr. Leader, ended his career with a fifth-place 
finish as the favorite in the Goodwood Handicap Oct. 13. He finished with 10 
victories in 27 starts, earning more than $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sondeed, the even-money favorite, easily won the $100,000 Desert Wine Sales 
Stakes Wednesday at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Sondeed didn't have much to beat -- Play the Odds, a maiden claimer, was second 
-- as he covered the seven furlongs in 1:23 and paid $4.20. BOB MIESZERSKI

N. GEOGRAPHIC'S WONDROUS YEARS SHOWN IN EXHIBIT

You'll find them in almost every garage, stashed between the rusty garden tools 
and the old bowling trophies: chronicles of our planet's religions, political 
upheavals, tragedies and triumphs, all neatly stacked according to date and 
tucked into crumbling cardboard boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Literally and figuratively, the National Geographic magazine has staying power. 
Founded in 1888 by a covey of Washington's most influential folk, the National 
Geographic Society was established to facilitate "the increase and diffusion of 
geographical knowledge," and has since become the world's largest nonprofit 
scientific and educational institution. The society celebrates a century-plus 
of achievement in "National Geographic Society: 100 Years of Adventure and 
Discovery," a traveling exhibit on view through Nov. 11 at the Fullerton Museum 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
A product of the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES), 
the show features 161 color and black-and-white photographs that trace the 
society's work through the years, from its backing of Commander Peary's 
exploration of the North Pole to its ongoing funding of global conservation 
programs. Fullerton Museum exhibition administrator Lynn LaBate has 
supplemented the photos with artifacts from the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana and 
vintage cameras from the California Museum of Photography at UC Riverside, many 
of them similar to those used by early National Geographic photographers. In 
addition, on Nov. 3, the museum will present a program of international stories 
for grade-school children, and on Nov. 2 and 9, evenings of Andean folk tunes 
and Brazilian contemporary popular music. There is an additional charge for 
these events. 
</P>
<P>
In the museum's video room, some of the society's most popular television 
documentaries will run through the end of the show. Included are "National 
Parks: Playground or Paradise?" (through Saturday), "Bali, Masterpieces of the 
Gods" (Oct. 28 through Nov. 3) and "African Wildlife" (Nov. 4 through 11). 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the society has been bringing remote corners of the world into our 
living rooms long before the advent of television. In the late 1800s and early 
1900s, the group was instrumental in the exploration of the poles, as well as 
southern Alaska and Canada. Chronicled in murky black-and-white photos are the 
struggles of Commander Peary and his party as they tackled huge snowdrifts on 
their first expedition to the North Pole, and the first flight over the South 
Pole by Commander Richard Byrd, which was funded by society grants in 1928-30. 
To date, the National Geographic Society has funded more than 3,300 research 
projects worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Through the magazine, the society has helped readers keep pace with these 
advancements. The first issue, printed in October, 1888, was a highly technical 
journal sent to 165 members. Photographs first appeared in 1910, and in 1920, 
the now-familiar yellow border became standard on each cover. Today, the 
magazine reaches an estimated 40 million people. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, magazine readers have followed the group's wildlife preservation 
efforts, noted in the show by a large photo of African elephants resting in 
Namibia's Estoshe National Park; they've sighed over the wreckage of 100 
natural disasters, detailed here with dramatic shots of the 1906 San Francisco 
earthquake and an aerial view of Mt. St. Helen's, one year after its 1980 
eruption. They've traveled vicariously on far-flung expeditions, such as the 
1920s trip to Chinese and Tibetan borderlands, captured here in a tranquil shot 
of a Tibetan holy man calling his brother monks to prayer. Adventures into the 
greatest heights and depths are recalled with photographs of U.S. space travel 
and of the 1985 discovery of the ill-fated Titanic. 
</P>
<P>
The society's pioneering use of photography is outlined as well, ranging from a 
moody 1916 shot using Lumiere autochrome, the first commercial color photo 
process, to a series of holograms from the mid-1980s. Vintage cameras on view 
include a 1927 Tropice, a wood-and-metal model suitable for use in tropical 
climates, and a Revolving Back Auto Graflex, popular among traveling 
photographers between 1904 and 1940. 
</P>
<P>
But the most powerful photographs in the show can be found in two large photo 
montages in the museum's smaller gallery. Images here range from a 1968 shot of 
a Vietnamese mother pleading for her sick child, to a 1915 photo of an Ifugao 
headhunter showing off his latest prize. A chilling 1922 shot shows a Mongolian 
woman locked in a small wooden box, sentenced to die of starvation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton Museum Center, 301 N. Pomona Ave., presents "National Geographic 
Society: 100 Years of Adventure and Discovery," an exhibit of 161 color and 
black-and-white photographs, through Nov. 11. Museum hours are Tuesday, 
Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., Thursday and Friday from 
11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Admission: $1 to $2; free to children under 12 and to all

The Golden Peach Pit: "GoodFellas" led the list of movies, TV shows and 
commercials receiving "Golden Pit Awards" for ethnic insults. 
</P>
<P>
The awards, presented n the form of gold spray-painted peach pits, were 
presented by William Fugazy, chairman of the National Ethnic Coalition of 
Organizations. The parody record "As Kosher as They Wanna Be," by "2 Live Jews" 
was singled out for self-denigrating Jewish jokes. The NBC soap opera "Santa 
Barbara" was also recognized, and Fox's "In Living Color" was tapped for 
crossing "the fine line of comedy with its negative reinforcements of ethnic 
stereotypes." BETH KLEID

'GLORY' RIDES CIVIL WAR TREND 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Civil War drama "Glory" is clinging to the No. 1 position on the Billboard 
magazine rental chart, largely on the strength of the Civil War mania that 
swept the country after the recent PBS series. But "Glory" looks like it will 
be ingloriously blasted out of the top spot by "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles," 
which moved up two notches to No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"Fire Birds," the military-action, "Top Gun"-esque movie starring Nicolas Cage, 
is the surprise rental hit of the fall so far, winging up three more rungs to 
No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
* This blockbuster romantic comedy was one of the year's biggest hits, grossing 
more than $166 million. Starring Richard Gere and Julia Roberts, the twist in 
"Pretty Woman" is that the Cinderella-like character (Roberts) is a hooker. It 
debuted at No. 27, but could vault into the Top Five next week. However, its 
full rental potential may never be realized, since it's selling for a 
relatively inexpensive $20.

Wyeth at the White House: Artist Andrew Wyeth, 73, said it was "really wild" to 
receive a congressional gold medal from President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
At a White House ceremony Wednesday marking the first such presentation to an 
artist, Bush said, "As the legislative citation reads: We act today in 
recognition of Andrew Wyeth's outstanding and invaluable contributions to 
American art and culture. He is, of course, one of America's foremost artists." 
The medal was patterned after a portrait of Wyeth by his son Jamie. BETH KLEID

A COMPELLING 'ST. MATTHEW' AT BACH FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Bach Festival has been the pillar of local musical life since 
1934. The current edition ended Sunday with a "St. Matthew" Passion that 
clearly showed why -- a dramatically urgent, musically and spiritually 
compelling reading of a repertory monument. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Somerville presided with characteristic calm and incisive authority over 
the large forces filling the First Congregational Church chancel. He delineated 
the levels of action and meditation carefully, shaping the large-scale scenas 
as attentively as individual choruses and arias, and made sure that the 
ravishing music always carried forward the drama. 
</P>
<P>
The Passions, though, are essentially a musical version of readers' theater, 
and depend on -- demand -- a convincing narrator. In the case of "St. Matthew," 
this fluent storyteller must also cope with an awesome vocal challenge to 
stamina, range and finesse. 
</P>
<P>
Tenor Bruce Johnson did so with consistent glory. The strain could be heard by 
the end of Part I, but he remained an amazingly clear, astonishingly expressive 
Evangelist, one who sounded like an immediate witness to the events he 
described. 
</P>
<P>
As Christ, baritone Kenneth Knight proved equally adept vocally. But almost 
everything he sang was a little too slow for dramatic impact. Somerville may 
have wanted it to contrast with the swift surroundings, but the result sounded 
predicated on the time-dishonored cliche that sacred equals solemn. 
</P>
<P>
Holly Shaw Price supplied a sweet, fluid soprano, as completely committed to 
the textual points as to the sinuous music. Veteran mezzo Florine Hemmings had 
trouble with disappearing low notes, but rose convincingly to the demands of 
"Erbarme dich." 
</P>
<P>
Tenor Alvin Brightbill sang on the very edge of technical control, but with 
clarion sound and thrilling exigency. Bass Michael Gallup offered rich, ripe 
sounds, but did little to distinguish between the bluster of Pilate and the 
submissive sweetness of his arias. JOHN HENKEN

GANG WARS BRING SORROWS TO SCHOOL TURF; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: RECENT VIOLENCE IS PROMPTING SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS TO HEIGHTEN 
SECURITY AND CALL IN PSYCHOLOGISTS TO COUNSEL FRIGHTENED STUDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just months after a state report showed a decline in school crime, one 
gang-related death and a spate of arrests and confrontations at or near area 
schools have raised concerns that gang turf wars are bleeding from San Gabriel 
Valley streets onto school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
In districts from Pasadena to Rowland Heights to Pomona, concern over school 
safety has prompted administrators to beef up security, cancel a varsity 
football game, bring in psychologists to counsel students and form task forces 
to study campus violence. 
</P>
<P>
But administrators say it is often difficult to prevent incidents that occur 
off campus, even if they involve students. Earlier this year, for instance, 
there were several shootings close to Pomona schools, an official from Pomona 
Unified said. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 16, a 12-year-old boy from Marshall Junior High School, whom Pomona 
officials described as a "wanna-be" who hung out with gang members, was shot in 
the head and killed, apparently by a member of an opposing gang, as he rode 
home from school in the back of a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
No one has been arrested. The murder has traumatized students at the school, 
prompting the district to bring in psychologists to counsel the children. 
</P>
<P>
"Because we live in L.A. County and because society is what it is today, none 
of us are exempt from being exposed to that kind of violence," said Linda 
Harding, principal of Los Altos High School. 
</P>
<P>
The Hacienda Heights school had its own brush with violence late last month 
when a student from a rival high school was arrested at a football game, 
carrying a loaded gun. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena, which showed a drop in overall school crimes last year, according to 
the state report, has been hit by a number of potentially violent incidents in 
recent weeks. Students, parents and teachers feel especially vulnerable, since 
district cutbacks recently slashed security by half. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's board meeting, parents asked for increased security at Pasadena 
Alternative School, which lost its only security guard this year due to the 
budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to wait until something really bad happens," said Patty Sedlacko, 
whose children attend Pasadena Alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Several incidents at Pasadena schools in recent weeks underscore her concern. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, two young men entered a classroom at Blair High School, 
interrupted teacher Allen Perlstein and refused to leave when he asked them to. 
Pasadena officials say the two, who were not students, shouted gang-related 
slogans at class members before abruptly leaving. But they returned a few 
minutes later and demanded to be let in, pounding violently on the classroom 
door, which Perlstein had quickly locked. 
</P>
<P>
Perlstein, a 20-year veteran of Pasadena Unified, said he felt "absolutely 
endangered" by the young men, whose breath reeked of alcohol. He wrote a letter 
to the board, which read in part: 
</P>
<P>
"I will not give up my life nor my health because this financially strapped 
school district is having budget problems. Your students as well as your 
employees have a right to a safe, clean, sane environment and a quality 
education." 
</P>
<P>
In a second confrontation at Blair, Pasadena officials say a teacher and some 
students attending a "Back to School Night" in September were harassed and 
intimidated by two young men. The men refused the teacher's request that they 
leave and eventually were escorted off campus by security officers. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena officials say they have requested help from the Pasadena Police 
Department and that both the police and the district's own security are 
maintaining a higher profile on high school campuses during school hours. 
</P>
<P>
After an uproar among parents and at school over the Blair incidents, Pasadena 
assigned two additional officers to that school "to make sure outsiders do not 
penetrate the campus," said Charles W. Parcell, administrative chief of campus 
police for Pasadena Unified. 
</P>
<P>
The district is also studying long-range plans that could include bringing 
off-duty police officers onto campus and shifting some of the district's night 
security to daytime duty, said John Porter, the district's director of 
secondary instruction. 
</P>
<P>
Other districts have also taken steps to ward off gang activity. Earlier this 
year, Pomona Unified launched a day patrol of five armed security officers. The 
patrol is districtwide, but focuses on junior high and high school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the district long ago moved football games out of Pomona, to Mt. 
San Antonio College in Walnut. That campus is patrolled by L.A. County 
sheriff's deputies and the college's own security. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, after security officers at Hacienda La Puente Unified arrested a 
16-year-old Nogales High School student carrying a loaded gun at a football 
game, the district canceled one game and decided to increase the number of 
off-duty deputies at future football games. 
</P>
<P>
It has also set up fences to separate members of opposing schools, figuring 
that it will lower the risk for violence if it minimizes interaction between 
them.

CANDIDATES TUNE IN ON CABLE TV TO SELL THEMSELVES; 
</P>
<P>
ADVERTISING: THE GROWING POPULARITY AND AFFORDABILITY OF CABLE HAVE ATTRACTED 
POLITICIANS TO PROJECT THEIR IMAGE ON PAY TELEVISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cable television advertising has come of age in the San Gabriel Valley this 
political season, with candidates' commercials squeezing into spots usually 
occupied by car dealers and pizza parlors. 
</P>
<P>
The cable incursion represents a new trend in local campaigns for U.S. 
Congress, the state Senate and the Assembly, which traditionally depend on 
phone banks, mailers and precinct walking. But this year, attracted by the 
growing popularity and affordability of cable, at least five local candidates 
for state or federal office have added 30-second spots on CNN, ESPN and other 
channels to the mix. 
</P>
<P>
The commercials' tone ranges from sentimental to strident. Production quality 
runs the gamut from semi-pro to Madison Avenue slick. As in most political 
advertising, the main idea is image-making. 
</P>
<P>
In one commercial, for instance, state Sen. Ruben S. Ayala (D-Chino) appears on 
the screen as a twinkle-eyed grandfatherly sort, musing about his days as a 
Marine in the jungles of the South Pacific during World War II. In another, he 
recalls the advice his revered father gave him. "My father was a very proud 
individual, very honest with a lot of dignity," Ayala says. "He was very good 
at giving us good advice, telling us that when we're talking, we're not 
learning anything." 
</P>
<P>
South Pasadena Mayor Evelyn Fierro, who is running in the 42nd Assembly 
District, is shown striding through a park as she talks about her desire to 
reclaim greatness for California. "I want a California that is clean, where the 
air we breathe and the water we drink is safe and pure, a state where the 
people once again respect government and participate," she says. 
</P>
<P>
But in addition to commercials that showcase such lofty sentiments, Ayala and 
Fierro are also running ads that lambaste their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
So is Ron Aguirre, the Republican candidate trying to unseat Assemblywoman 
Sally Tanner (D-Baldwin Park) in the 60th Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
An Aguirre ad opens with a police siren and shows news clippings suggesting 
rampant crime in the San Gabriel Valley. Using an unflattering portrait of 
Tanner, he compares her work on bills involving fishing rights and video games 
with efforts by other legislators to deal with gangs, drugs and drive-by 
shootings, and his own pledge to be tough on crime. 
</P>
<P>
John Eastman, who is running against Rep. Esteban Torres (D-La Puente) in the 
34th Congressional District, manages to work attacks on Torres and a friendly 
hello into all three of his 30-second spots. 
</P>
<P>
His ads open with people talking to the camera about Torres. 
</P>
<P>
In one ad, the first person says: "I'm so disappointed in Congressman Torres." 
</P>
<P>
A second person adds: "Congressman Torres voted to cut our Medicare benefits." 
</P>
<P>
A third pipes in, "Congressman Torres voted to raise my taxes, but he made sure 
his own pay raise was exempt from cuts." 
</P>
<P>
Then, a middle-aged woman sums it up: "The nerve of the man!" 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the commercial, Eastman, coat slung over his shoulder, comes on 
the screen to say: "Hi, I'm John Eastman. Our Congress deserves a pay cut, not 
a pay raise. Help me repeal this huge congressional pay raise." 
</P>
<P>
Eastman was among the pioneers of such advertising in the San Gabriel Valley 
four years ago, when he managed the losing campaign of Republican Charles House 
against Torres. But the cable ads in that campaign were much more limited, 
running only the weekend before the election, Eastman said. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Eastman is putting a major emphasis on cable, spending up to $700 a 
day on ads he figures will reach 60% of the district's voters. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck DeVore, a 28-year-old campaign consultant who wrote Eastman's 
commercials, said the spots were designed to look more homespun than the 
commercials on network television. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't intended to be slick," he said. "We felt that people in the current 
anti-incumbent mood don't want someone who is slick and has big bucks. They 
want someone they can identify with." Thus, he said, instead of using trained 
actors, the ads employ campaign volunteers, including the woman who says the 
most memorable line in the spots: "The nerve of the man!" 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to make her famous," Eastman said. "That's the 'Where's the beef?' 
lady of 1990." 
</P>
<P>
(The volunteer is uncredited in the ad, but her name is Patricia Baker, and she 
lives in South El Monte.) 
</P>
<P>
DeVore said the ads are playing on a number of cable channels but will run most 
often in the final days of the campaign on the news channels, where he believes 
most of the viewers are likely to be voters. "We may even go into MTV the day 
before the election, figuring (MTV viewers) don't have much of a memory span," 
he joked. 
</P>
<P>
DeVore said the ads have been so effective that people are calling the campaign 
office to voice support for Eastman. 
</P>
<P>
But Carmen Garcia, who is Torres' daughter and is managing his reelection 
campaign, said the ads may backfire. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of people calling us who are real upset," she said. "They say, 
'I've seen the ads and they're horrible.' " 
</P>
<P>
Torres has his own cable commercial, which doesn't mention Eastman, but instead 
shows Torres talking with a group of people about his legislation to bring 
federal resources to bear against gang violence, and his willingness to meet 
with constituents at any time. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Sheingold, who is managing Ayala's campaign for reelection against a 
strong challenge from Assemblyman Charles W. Bader (R-Pomona), said cable ads 
are more effective in conveying feelings than facts. 
</P>
<P>
Ayala has been using cable ads and mailers to attack Bader for an incident in 
June when a Fresno assemblyman cast 69 votes in Bader's name while Bader was 
away at a political event. (Bader said the votes were cast without his 
permission). Half of Ayala's commercials are aimed at showcasing an image of 
who he is, rather than focusing on issues. 
</P>
<P>
Sheingold said his campaign philosophy is: "You put your soul on TV. You put 
your record in the mail." 
</P>
<P>
Patrice Painter, advertising sales manager for United Artists Cable, which 
sells ads for six cable systems in the San Gabriel Valley, said 19 political 
candidates have bought ads this year compared to one four years ago. The 19 
include statewide office-seekers, candidates in City Council elections last 
April and five congressional, state Senate and Assembly candidates on the 
November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the ads depends on the number of subscribers. Typical rates range 
from $2.85 for a 30-second spot on a system with 9,500 subscribers to $28.50 
for a system with 75,000 subscribers. The rates are the same whether the ad 
appears on CNN, ESPN, Prime Ticket or any other cable channel, Painter said. A 
commercial must run at least 100 times to reach its full audience, she added. 
</P>
<P>
The interest in cable advertising has risen with the growth in the number of 
cable subscribers in the San Gabriel Valley. In Pomona, for example, 
Continental Cablevision has 14,200 subscribers, compared to 4,200 five years 
ago. United Artists Cable, which serves Baldwin Park, La Puente, Hacienda 
Heights and neighboring areas, has grown from 19,000 subscribers four years ago 
to 28,000 today. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone is convinced that cable television ads are effective in 
political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ayala is spending $60,000 on cable television, Bader is spending 
nothing, putting most of his money into mailers. Bader said he doubts that 
cable channels reach enough voters to make the expenditure worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
But Fierro, who wrote and produced her own commercials, drawing on her 
background as a writer and producer at KNBC, said she thinks that cable ads 
will soon become a standard part of most local campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"People like to see what the candidate looks like," she said. "They like to get 
a feel of how the person speaks. I can't walk to every door in the district -- 
though I'm trying -- but for those people I don't walk to, at least they can 
get a glimpse of me on television."

FILM ON MONTEREY PARK CONFLICT PREVIEWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
MONTEREY PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 50 residents got their first glimpse Tuesday night of "America Becoming," 
a documentary that examines recent conflicts and controversies in the city 
widely dubbed the nation's first "suburban Chinatown." 
</P>
<P>
The film, the product of two years' research by filmmakers and scholars, looks 
at questions of American identity in the wake of increasing immigration. 
Directed by Charles Burnett, whose feature film "To Sleep With Anger" began 
limited release nationwide Wednesday, the documentary focuses on six cities and 
is tentatively scheduled to air on public television in April, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night's showing focused on Monterey Park's 15-minute segment of the 
film, although portions devoted to Chicago and to Garden City, Kan., were also 
aired. The program, part of the city's Harmony Week, was designed to give 
residents a chance to offer a critique of the portrayal of their city while the 
film is being edited, executive producer Dai Sil Kim Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Monterey Park segment concentrates on racial tensions generated by the 
massive influx of Chinese and other Asians into the city during the late 1970s 
and throughout the '80s, tensions that seeped subtly into the issue of slow 
growth and overtly into the issue of foreign languages on street and business 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to the documentary from an audience composed of whites, Asians and 
Latinos was mixed. Although favorable toward its intent, some viewers expressed 
disappointment that the film placed emphasis on the conflict and not on quiet, 
behind-the-scenes harmony. 
</P>
<P>
"I think when they filmed this, it was the high time of controversy," said 
Lucia Su, 56, who has lived in Monterey Park for 21 years. "We had some harmony 
in the schools and the community. It wasn't just the controversy with Barry 
Hatch," she said, referring to the former mayor known for his support of a 
short-lived council resolution designating English as the city's official 
language. 
</P>
<P>
Her comments were echoed by Ruth Willner, a 32-year resident. "Part of the 
problem with the film was that since it took you into a specific period of 
time; it didn't tell you what came before. It just gave you a microcosm," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The city, in fact, had enjoyed cultural diversity and harmony before any of the 
controversies erupted, said Marjorie Kemmerer, 77, who appeared in the film. 
"When we moved here in 1966, I thought I was in heaven," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But most agreed that, given the brief time allotted, the documentary did a fair 
job of depicting the rapidly growing city. The film relied primarily on 
interviews with community figures, including Hatch and Jose Calderon, a leader 
in the movement to rescind the official English resolution. 
</P>
<P>
But in one striking image, an old picture of a primarily white high school 
athletic team dissolved into a photo of a modern-day team composed mostly of 
Asians. 
</P>
<P>
The film "represented Monterey Park with all its conflicts, dreams, good points 
and bad points," Mayor Judy Chu said. "You were forced to see everybody in 
their own habitat, and there were no easy solutions. It was a real slice of 
life." 
</P>
<P>
And life, especially in this city of more than 60,000, means change, said 
Willner, 61. "No one promised me that Monterey Park would remain the same. When 
I moved here, I created change. When other people moved in, they created 
change. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing we can do in terms of stopping the change, so you do what you 
can to create a sense of community. That's the most important thing."

The council, on a 4-1 vote Tuesday, approved the funding. Councilman Curt 
Morris dissented. 
</P>
<P>
The money is in addition to the $27,000 the city approved last year for the

PARKING CONCERNS RAISED

<P>
The City Council, acting as the Community Redevelopment Agency, on Tuesday said 
there will not be enough parking at two new developments being proposed for 
14-24 W. Sierra Madre Blvd., the site of a fire in December. 
</P>
<P>
Property owners Fred Crocket and Helen Elliott, in a bid to persuade the city 
to allow them to continue with the project, have offered to give the city 16 
feet of their property for public access. 
</P>
<P>
If the deal is accepted by the city, officials could grant the project up to 10 
parking credits, allowing construction to move forward. However, City Manager 
James McRea said there are no immediate uses for the offered land. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations were continuing.

HOSPITAL STUDY COST SHARED

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council agreed Monday to split with Alhambra Community Hospital the 
cost of a $28,000 study to determine what can be done to make the hospital 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Kevin Murphy said earlier parts of the three-phase study blamed 
the hospital's money troubles on three factors: it is not a full-service 
hospital, which makes it difficult to obtain contracts with health maintenance 
organizations; it has a high proportion of Medicare and indigent patients, and 
it is in a low-visibility location. 
</P>
<P>
Julia Norris, city assistant finance director, said the hospital is behind in 
its lease payments to the city by more than $1 million.

SETTLEMENT IN SOIL REMOVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Redevelopment Agency accepted an out-of-court settlement totaling $1.3 
million from a national construction company for removal of contaminated soil 
at the firm's former branch. 
</P>
<P>
The city, which had sued Kiewit Pacific Co. for $10 million, has already 
received about two-thirds of the settlement amount. 
</P>
<P>
The agency bought the site at 301 E. Santa Clara St. in September, 1986, when 
Kiewit moved its offices to Santa Fe Springs. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1989, about 50 barrels containing toxic residue were discovered on 
the site. This past March, a Superior Court judge fined Kiewit $50,000. Two 
months later, a federal judge ordered the firm to pay the agency for removal of 
contaminated soil. So far, the agency has received $850,000 in cleanup costs.

REVISED BONELLI PARK PLAN RENEWS DISPUTE; 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIMAS: EXPANSION OF RAGING WATERS HAS BEEN ADDED TO CONTROVERSIAL COUNTY 
PLANS TO PERMIT COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE PARK.

<P>
County parks officials have revised a controversial plan that would raise money 
by permitting commercial development in Frank G. Bonelli Regional Park, 
bringing renewed opposition from a citizens group that has fought the project 
for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, an existing equestrian area and a park maintenance facility 
would be relocated so that the Raging Waters amusement park can be expanded. 
The new proposal retains the county's desire to build a cabin complex, 
restaurant and lounge in the park. 
</P>
<P>
The county's plans for development in Bonelli Park have generated disagreement 
and legal action since they were first proposed in 1986. Raging Waters Inc., a 
private company, leases land from the county, and the expansion of the water 
park is a new addition to development plans. 
</P>
<P>
Bonelli Park, most of which is in San Dimas but which stretches into Pomona and 
La Verne, is operated by the Los Angeles County Department of Parks and 
Recreation. Claremont, Covina and Glendora also are part of a joint powers 
authority that must be consulted on any park project. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Harvey of the parks department said the new plans would provide more 
recreational activities for park users and generate an additional $500,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The Coalition to Save Bonelli Park, however, is concerned that the development 
will harm plant and animal life. The group wants no further development in the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
San Dimas Councilman Denis Bertone, co-chairman of the coalition, accused 
county officials of allowing a desire to make money to override the needs of 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed development, he said, "is inappropriate for a public park. . . . 
If people want (theme park) recreation, they can go to Disneyland or Knott's 
Berry Farm." 
</P>
<P>
The new plans, including an environmental impact report, have been sent to the 
six cities that make up the joint powers authority. All interested parties have 
until Nov. 24 to object. The parks department then will make a recommendation 
to the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Coalition attorney Ronald Vera said the group plans to challenge the county for 
not including the authority in its latest planning process. But Harvey said a 
1989 judge's ruling that required the county to consult with the authority only 
applied to an earlier proposal for new golf and equestrian centers. 
</P>
<P>
Besides allowing the expansion of Raging Waters, which would use 119 acres to 
build new attractions and a parking lot for 4,000 cars, the county wants to 
construct a 150-room lodge, an 80-unit cabin complex and a 25,000-square-foot 
restaurant in a hillside area west of Puddingstone Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the county first proposed an expansion of development in Bonelli Park. 
In 1988, the Coalition to Preserve Bonelli Park sued the county, claiming that 
park officials violated state law by soliciting proposals from developers 
without first completing an environmental impact report. A judge ruled in 1989 
that the county must consult on projects with the park's joint powers 
authority.

ATLANTIC SQUARE IS AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have been reading with keen interest the recent articles and letters about 
Atlantic Square and in particular the letter written by Irv and Ruth Willner 
(Times, Sept. 30). 
</P>
<P>
Although I am sure of their genuine interest in our community, they have 
presented facts which in some cases are inaccurate and have failed to address 
other facts which are crucial to the future of Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
Although we must be fiscally responsible, the city and Redevelopment Agency are 
not embarking on this project as an investment standing on its own. We are 
taking the first crucial step in assuring the financial viability of our 
community as a whole in years to come. 
</P>
<P>
Our city operates substantially from the revenues generated by sales and 
property taxes. We have commissioned studies which indicate that, not only does 
a large portion of our community spend its sales dollars outside of the city, 
but our commercial districts are falling into disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
Our studies indicate that the best way to attract sales dollars back to our 
city and to encourage the repair and upgrading of our commercial districts is 
to bring major goods and services into our city. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing on Oct. 29 is not intended to approve or disapprove the Atlantic 
Square project. This project was approved last year after the council initiated 
the condemnation action and approved the developer's plans. This upcoming 
hearing is intended to provide a public forum to discuss the most recent 
changes in the project.

<TEXT>
<P>
Pasadena City Director Chris Holden took a break from city politics to get 
married Saturday in Pasadena's Westminster Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
Before more than 400 well-wishers, Holden married Michelle Watkins, a loan 
officer with Mortgage Link in Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
The reception was in Pasadena's Central Library on Walnut Street. It was the 
first wedding reception at the newly renovated library, which has begun renting 
out its space to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
The new bride and Holden, son of Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden, are 
vacationing in Europe for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
* L. Norman Howe, founder and chief executive officer of F &amp; P Inc., a 
Pasadena marketing company, has been named a regional winner of the 1990 
"Chivas Regal Extrapreneur Awards." 
</P>
<P>
Howe received the award for raising more than $11 million in the last 11 years 
for the City of Hope medical treatment center in Duarte by developing grocery 
store "Coupons of Hope." Food companies pay for advertising on the coupons, and 
that money goes to the City of Hope.

U.S. JOINS U.N. COUNCIL IN 2ND REBUKE OF ISRAEL; 
</P>
<P>
MIDEAST: THE RESOLUTION DEPLORES JERUSALEM'S REJECTION OF INVESTIGATION OF 
TEMPLE MOUNT KILLINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN J. GOLDMAN and NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Underscoring growing strains between traditional allies, the United States 
voted Wednesday to support a U.N. Security Council resolution deploring the 
refusal of Israel to allow a U.N. mission to visit Jerusalem to investigate the 
killing of 21 Palestinians earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in less than two weeks that the Bush Administration has 
sided against Israel in the Security Council. On Oct. 12 the United States, 
usually a staunch defender of Israel, joined in unanimously condemning that 
nation for the killings on the Temple Mount. 
</P>
<P>
The latest vote by the Administration against Israel came as the United States 
again was forced to decide between offending the Israelis or keeping the 
allegiance of Arab nations aligned against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's resolution, the council expressed alarm at the refusal of the 
government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to accept a mission from U.N. 
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. It also said it was "gravely 
concerned" about the continued deterioration of the situation in the occupied 
West Bank and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
The council urged Israel to reconsider its decision and insisted that it permit 
the mission. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very pleased to see that the unanimity that the council achieved when it 
adopted the original resolution has been maintained," said the Security 
Council's current president, British Ambassador David Hannay. " . . . I think 
it sends a stronger signal when the council adopts a resolution unanimously, 
particularly in this area, which so often has been the object of divisions in 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
"The principal loser in not receiving this mission will be Israel itself," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Before the vote, Israel's U.N. ambassador, Johanan Bein, charged that the Oct. 
8 rioting in Jerusalem -- in which Palestinians hurled rocks at Jews worshiping 
at the Western Wall and police and security forces opened fire -- was 
deliberately instigated by the Palestine Liberation Organization as a means of 
diverting world attention from the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"Something strange has happened. The momentum (against Iraq) has come to a 
screeching halt," Bein said during a nearly hourlong impassioned defense of his 
government's position. "For the moment, Saddam Hussein has been let off the 
hook. 
</P>
<P>
". . . It happens to be the oldest trick in the book: Blame the victim," Bein 
added. "(The PLO) managed to touch off a storm of violence on the Temple Mount 
for all the world to see. . . . They knew perfectly well that this was the last 
thing Israel needed and the last thing anyone hoping to dislodge Iraq's 
aggression could possibly hope for." 
</P>
<P>
Bein met briefly with reporters after the vote. "My basic reaction is we have 
seen this film before," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, after more than a week of intense behind-the-scenes discussions, 
Perez de Cuellar told the council that he would not send a mission to Jerusalem 
under the present circumstances. He rejected suggestions by Israeli diplomats 
that his report be based in good measure on an independent Israeli commission 
inquiry into the Temple Mount violence. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary general's statement set the stage for Wednesday's Security 
Council criticism. Colombia, Cuba, Malaysia and Yemen submitted a draft 
resolution demanding that the mission be allowed to travel to Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
In a last-ditch attempt to head off the Security Council vote, President Bush 
had urged Shamir to reverse his position and agree to accept the U.N. 
investigation, thus making the latest resolution moot. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Bush wrote "that our 
preference would be . . . to find a way to let the secretary general's mission 
come to Israel." She said the letter, sent from the White House on Tuesday, 
mirrored what Bush has said publicly on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler also confirmed that the Security Council's decision to take up the 
second Israel resolution at all was a defeat for U.S. diplomacy, which had 
sought an early vote on a resolution condemning Iraq for its attempt to starve 
out embassies in Kuwait. American officials considered the Israel debate to be 
a needless distraction. 
</P>
<P>
"We have got to grapple with this (Israel resolution) first, unfortunately," 
Tutwiler said. "The United States' position has been since last Friday that we 
would like to get the focus where it should be, back on the gulf." 
</P>
<P>
At one point in negotiations at the United Nations, the United States had 
backed a plan by Hannay that a milder Security Council statement be substituted 
for the resolution. But when the resolution's sponsors demanded a vote, the 
idea of the statement was scotched. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary general has until the end of the month to report on the violence 
in Jerusalem. And even as the council voted against Israel on Wednesday, 
diplomatic efforts to find a compromise were continuing. 
</P>
<P>
Some Israeli diplomats suggested that once the internal three-member commission 
reports on the events in Jerusalem, that report could be given to a top aide of 
Perez de Cuellar, or perhaps the secretary general could send an envoy to 
Israel for clarifications. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the slowing of momentum at the United Nations on the Persian Gulf 
issue was very much on some council members' minds. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to dispose of this problem of the mission to Jerusalem, and we have to 
return back to the main problem that confronts the Security Council," said Yuli 
M. Vorontsov, the Soviet ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials in Washington and at the United Nations said American diplomats 
are rounding up support for a new series of resolutions attacking Iraq that 
will be introduced as soon as the Israeli matter is disposed of. 
</P>
<P>
The first U.S. priority is a resolution condemning Iraq's refusal to permit 
embassies in Kuwait to receive food and water. All but three Western nations -- 
the United States, Britain and France -- have already succumbed to the pressure 
and closed their diplomatic missions in Kuwait. But those three nations are all 
permanent members of the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government hopes to follow the resupply resolution with measures 
setting the stage for war crimes trials of Hussein and his top aides and 
ordering Iraq to pay reparations to Kuwait. All three resolutions are purely 
symbolic because none could be enforced without the military defeat of the 
Iraqi army. But a senior U.S. official said that a Security Council vote to 
begin war crimes trials, for instance, might make Hussein think twice about 
additional aggression. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the United Nations said additional resolutions are being prepared 
to cut off telecommunications links between Iraq and the outside world and to 
order U.N. members to reduce the number of Iraqi diplomats at embassies 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials concede, however, that none of the proposed resolutions will 
hurt Iraq nearly as much as the trade embargo that was invoked in August.

BUSH'S VETO OF RIGHTS BILL SURVIVES IN SENATE BY 1 VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FULWOOD III, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate upheld President Bush's veto of the Civil Rights Act of 1990 
Wednesday, falling a single vote short of the two-thirds majority needed to 
override. 
</P>
<P>
The 66-34 vote ended months of often anguished negotiations and intense 
lobbying by civil rights groups, which had placed passage of the jobs 
discrimination bill at the top of their legislative agenda for this session. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), the state's GOP gubernatorial candidate, joined 
the victorious minority, all Republicans, in upholding the 16th veto of the 
Bush presidency, which has yet to suffer a reversal. All 55 Senate Democrats, 
including California's Alan Cranston, and 11 Republicans voted to override. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, which had passed both chambers by wide majorities, would have 
reversed or altered six recent Supreme Court decisions to make it easier for 
women and minorities to prove discrimination in the workplace. The Senate 
voted, 62 to 34, to pass a compromise version of the measure last week, while 
the House approved it, 273 to 154. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush vetoed the bill Monday, saying that he regretted doing so but 
feared that its enactment would force employers to "adopt quotas in order to 
avoid liability" from lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), who led the floor fight against the override, 
said that the President wanted to sign a civil rights bill but could not 
support the legislation sent to him by Congress because it would place undue 
emphasis on statistical analysis of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans want a piece of the American dream; they want no part of quotas," 
Hatch said. "This bill promises to move America away from its ideals, not 
toward them." 
</P>
<P>
While civil rights advocates and their Senate backers promised to carry their 
fight into the next session, opponents of the measure offered to continue 
working to produce a new bill that the President could sign before this 
legislative session ends.

<P>
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) proposed working into the night to 
reach agreement on an Administration-approved bill that would reverse some of 
the Supreme Court decisions, but leave others intact. He said that such a bill 
could be passed and signed by Bush at a Rose Garden ceremony before the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"The President is willing to go the extra mile" to sign a civil rights bill 
that would not foster quotas, Dole said. "But he's not going to go over the 
cliff." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), who supported the bill and voted to override the 
veto, said he was worried about the image projected by the Republican Party's 
opposition to the bill. He said that it is possible to compromise and urged his 
colleagues to vote to override. Failing that, he pleaded for more time so that 
civil rights supporters can try to win over "the 8, 10, 12 (Republican) members 
who want to sign the bill" but were reluctant to do so because they wanted to 
support the President. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), the key Senate sponsor of the bill, 
rejected all offers and declared the issue dead for this session. 
</P>
<P>
As the senators debated the override, groups of black and female House members 
-- all supporters of the legislation -- made rare appearances on the chamber 
floor. Seated in the visitors' gallery were both David Duke, the former Ku Klux 
Klan leader and defeated Louisiana Republican senatorial candidate, and the 
Rev. Jesse Jackson, a prominent civil rights advocate and "shadow" Senate 
candidate from the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
"The President and the Congress are getting my message," Duke said in a hallway 
interview. He said that he had met in "about a dozen offices" with unidentified 
congressional leaders to lobby against the override. "My message is equal 
rights for all Americans, including white Americans," he said. "I wish I was on 
the floor voting with them today." 
</P>
<P>
Dianne Feinstein, Wilson's Democratic opponent for governor, criticized him for 
casting "the deciding vote against this historic measure. Sen. Wilson's vote 
represents a major setback for the cause of equal opportunity for all 
Americans," she said in a statement to a senior citizens group. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, by voting against this anti-discrimination legislation, Sen. Wilson 
helped turn back the clock. Without this landmark legislation . . . it will be 
far more difficult for women and minorities who have been the victims of 
discrimination to win their case in court." 
</P>
<P>
Otto Bos, Wilson's campaign manager, defended the senator's record on civil 
rights. "For 24 years, he (Wilson) has voted for every piece of civil rights 
legislation," Bos said. "This is the first civil rights bill that he has voted 
against and this is because there is a segment in the bill that invites quotas. 
. . . The problem is a fundamental difference between Wilson and Feinstein over 
quotas, she supports them, he does not." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), who voted against the civil rights bill when it 
was approved by the Senate, switched sides on the override vote. Although his 
decision came after it was apparent that the measure would fail, Boschwitz said 
that he changed his position because "David Duke was sitting in the balcony. I 
couldn't vote against the bill with him sitting up there." 
</P>
<P>
Although Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) moved to preserve 
the right for a second vote to override the veto, Kennedy, floor manager of the 
bill, said that there would be no attempt to revive the legislation in this 
session.

CONFEREES OK INCREASE OF 45% IN IMMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Congressional negotiators agreed Wednesday to a major restructuring of national 
immigration policies, permitting at least 45% more foreigners to enter the 
country in each of the next three years and about 35% more in every year 
thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the deal, struck by a House-Senate conference committee, 700,000 
persons would be allowed to immigrate to this country each year from 1992 to 
1994, up from the current 500,000. In subsequent years, the United States would 
admit 675,000 immigrants. Neither figure includes refugees. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would open the nation's doors wider to Europeans, some Africans 
and other foreigners who have been virtually locked out of legal immigration by 
existing U.S. policy that gives preference to reuniting the families of current 
U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Present immigration law, enacted 25 years ago, emphasized family reunification 
to such an extent that about 85% of visas have gone to Asians and Latin 
Americans. The current bill retains an emphasis on family unity and increases 
the number of family-related visas. 
</P>
<P>
However, by raising the overall numbers substantially, it leaves room for 
20,000 "diversity visas" for natives of regions "adversely affected" by current 
law. In addition, the legislation seeks to make it easier for persons with 
special skills or education to enter the country. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has supported a Senate-passed version of the legislation that 
limited total immigration to 630,000 per year. However, he had warned House 
members that he would veto their version of the legislation, which provided for 
775,000 annual visas. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials declined to predict whether he would support or veto 
the legislation passed by the conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
Conferees, however, praised their agreement, saying that the compromise 
represents the best deal that could be reached to increase legal immigration 
from countries with low levels of immigrants, while preserving existing 
emphasis on family reunification. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good bill," said Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), a sponsor 
of the House bill and one of the conference negotiators. "It could have been a 
much better bill, but we did pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), another member of the conference committee, 
said that the bill would "open new opportunities for immigrants with skills and 
talents we need, while increasing opportunities for family reunification." 
</P>
<P>
Under the compromise, during the first three years 520,000 of the total 700,000 
visas would be used by families seeking to bring in family members. About 
140,000 visas would be used for those with special job skills and 20,000 for 
persons with special skills and talents. 
</P>
<P>
After 1995, the family visa allotment would fall to 480,000, with 140,000 
reserved for workers and 55,000 for persons from low-immigration regions. 
</P>
<P>
Technically there is no cap for the admission of minor children, spouses and 
parents of U.S. citizens. However immigration officials expect no more than 
200,000 "immediate relatives" to apply for visas. The remaining visas in the 
family category are thus assumed to be open to non-immediate family members 
such as siblings or aunts. 
</P>
<P>
But Latino and Asian American groups complained that if the number of immediate 
relatives seeking visas greatly exceeded expectations, non-immediate family 
members would be squeezed out. 
</P>
<P>
After the advocacy groups threatened to withdraw their support for the bill, 
the committee made a deal which guarantees that at least 226,000 non-immediate 
family members will be admitted. 
</P>
<P>
Another provision in the bill, which calls for a pilot program allowing two 
states to test the use of drivers' licenses as worker authorization documents, 
drew anger from the immigrant rights activists. The provision is intended to 
provide companies with a more tamper-proof method of verifying whether persons 
who appear to be foreign are legally in the country and eligible for 
employment. Civil libertarians have said that the proposal could lead to a 
national identity card for workers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a separate issue and a volatile one for us," said Cecilia Munoz, 
senior legislative assistant for the National Council of La Raza. "We go 
ballistic over the idea of a national identity card and we accept this under no 
circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also would establish a national policy for granting temporary 
haven to persons who are unable to return to their native countries because of 
civil war or domestic upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
Under a special provision crafted for natives of war-ravaged El Salvador living 
in the United States, the bill would require that they renew their work 
documents every six months. 
</P>
<P>
Another provision of the legislation would grant the secretary of health and 
human services the right to determine a list of communicable diseases that 
would bar persons from entering the country. This measure is expected to result 
in the removal of AIDS patients from the list of persons denied entry. Harvard 
University, which is slated to sponsor the 1992 International AIDS Conference, 
had threatened to drop its sponsorship of the world's premier annual AIDS 
meeting if AIDS patients remain on the list.

IMPASSE BROKEN ON TAXES ON RICH; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: MOST HOUSE DEMOCRATS ACCEPT A COMPROMISE. THE BREAKTHROUGH WARDS OFF A 
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. NOT ALL ISSUES IN DEFICIT REDUCTION PLAN ARE SETTLED. 
</P>

<P>
A threatened midnight shutdown of the federal government was averted Wednesday 
when most House Democrats accepted the outlines of a new budget compromise 
calling for tax increases aimed primarily at those making more than $100,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
While some issues remain to be negotiated, the Democrats' strong show of 
support for the most controversial provisions of the package signaled the 
possible conclusion of a months-long battle between President Bush and Congress 
over a $500-billion deficit reduction plan. 
</P>
<P>
The House, acting less than an hour before the deadline, extended the 
government's spending authority for three more days until Saturday midnight by 
a vote of 380 to 45 and sent it to the Senate where it was finally approved. 
The White House announced that President Bush would sign the measure today 
because congressional negotiators were making satisfactory progress. 
</P>
<P>
Congress was expected to finish work on the budget and other business and 
adjourn this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), who was rebuffed Tuesday by members of his 
own party on an alternative plan for raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans, 
said that he would try to bring the new agreement to a vote in the House today 
or Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking this as a green light, definitely," the Speaker told reporters 
after the hourlong Democratic caucus ended with a burst of applause for Foley 
and House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.). 
</P>
<P>
"We ought to do it and get out," said Rep. James H. Scheuer (D-N.Y.), 
reflecting a widespread belief among lawmakers that they must approve some kind 
of deficit-cutting plan before facing voters in the Nov. 6 elections. 
</P>
<P>
But there still are some skeptics among House Democrats, who must come up with 
at least 80% of the votes needed to pass a budget plan in that chamber, since 
most Republicans have indicated that they will vote against any bill imposing 
new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The package is expected to clear the Senate with fewer problems. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiators said that the package would increase the federal gasoline tax by 5 
cents a gallon, impose higher taxes on wine, beer and cigarettes and hike 
airline ticket taxes to 10% from 8%. For Californians the gas tax increase 
would come on top of a state increase of 5 cents a gallon last Aug. 1. The 
state tax will go up 1 cent each Jan. 1 for four years. 
</P>
<P>
The key compromise endorsed by House Democrats on Wednesday involves a 
combination of changes in income tax rates, exemptions and deductions that 
would have the combined effect of increasing the taxes paid by the most 
affluent Americans, a key goal of Democratic lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls for bursting the "bubble" contained in existing tax law by 
creating a new basic top tax rate of 31% -- an increase from the 28% now paid 
by the wealthiest taxpayers but a reduction for some upper-middle-income 
taxpayers who currently pay at a 33% rate. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiators also agreed in principle on a plan to further raise the top tax 
rate by 0.5% for every personal exemption claimed by individuals with income 
over $100,000 and by families with incomes over $150,000. An affected 
individual, for example, would have a top tax rate of 31.5%, while a childless 
couple would pay 32%. 
</P>
<P>
Higher-income taxpayers also would be hit with a provision reducing their 
itemized deductions by an amount equal to 3% of any income exceeding $100,000. 
For example, a taxpayer with income of $200,000 would be required to reduce his 
deductions by $3,000. The provision would have the same effect as an additional 
rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
In another provision affecting more affluent Americans, the final package would 
raise the ceiling on wages subject to the 1.45% Medicare payroll tax to 
$125,000 from the present $51,300 cutoff. 
</P>
<P>
The package also contains little-noticed but powerful restraints on future 
spending by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
For at least the next three years, the federal government will not be able to 
spend above certain separate limits on the military, domestic programs, foreign 
aid and benefit programs without triggering automatic cutbacks in those 
categories. In the final two years of the agreement, there would be some 
flexibility to boost domestic spending slightly as long as the Pentagon budget 
is cut by an equal amount. 
</P>
<P>
The spending limits are based on current expectations and will be changed each 
year to reflect updated technical changes and the performance of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The difference is that instead of establishing theoretical deficit targets far 
in advance that invariably were ignored in practice, the new approach would 
require Congress to follow through on its vow to curb spending by predetermined 
amounts. 
</P>
<P>
Bush canceled a scheduled trip to New Mexico and Arizona today so that he could 
monitor progress on the final budget package. Planned appearances in California 
on Friday remain on his schedule, however. 
</P>
<P>
Agreement on the outlines of the tax compromise came Wednesday morning in a 
meeting of Foley, Gephardt, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) 
and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
The session was convened after Dole and House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel 
(R-Ill.) paid a late-night call on Bush on Tuesday to review their options 
after House Democrats rejected an earlier plan that would have taxed the rich 
mainly through higher limits on tax deductions. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers from California, New York and other high-tax states protested that 
this approach would be unfair to their residents. 
</P>
<P>
The rate increase linked to the $2,050 personal exemption for the 
$100,000-and-up income group would amount to a disguised increase in tax rates. 
The President, however, had said that he would veto any rate increase above 
31%, forcing negotiators to seek the roundabout route to accomplish the same 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
In another move to get Democratic support for a deficit-reduction plan, the 
White House apparently agreed to reduce cutbacks in Medicare to the 
House-approved level of about $42 billion, compared to a $49 billion reduction 
approved by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush is expected to endorse the plan before it is presented to the 
House and Senate as part of a massive deficit-cutting measure including about 
$142 billion worth of tax increases and almost $300 billion worth of spending 
reductions. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Congressional leaders said that they doubt whether more than 40 of the 
175 House Republicans will vote for the compromise because of their dislike for 
higher taxes. As a result, approval of the measure may hinge on the support of 
180 of the 258 House Democrats in a roll-call vote less than two weeks before 
Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
While some Democrats reserved judgment on the latest compromise and others 
indicated that they could not support it, the majority of those leaving the 
party's caucus favored swift approval. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a moment of truth -- you've got to go with the leadership," said Rep. 
Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente). Others agreed with Foley that it was time to 
conclude the hard-fought bargaining that began with budget talks between White 
House officials and congressional leaders last May. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Carmel Valley), the House Budget Committee chairman who 
has played a key role in the talks, said that the agreement in principle sets 
the outer limits for a budget package and that hard negotiations still lie 
ahead.

PROSPECT OF 2ND TV DEBATE ALL BUT DEAD

<P>
Last-ditch efforts to arrange a second and final televised gubernatorial debate 
between Republican Pete Wilson and Democrat Dianne Feinstein failed on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the candidates apparently will have to rely on their own 
television commercials and any news coverage they can attract between now and 
Election Day on Nov. 6 to get their final campaign messages across to a 
critical bloc of undecided voters. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson early Wednesday accepted the offer of KNSD Channel 39 in San Diego to 
hold a debate tonight, with Wilson participating by satellite television feed 
from Washington, where he has been for more than a week for U.S. Senate 
sessions. Feinstein rejected the offer as not in keeping with the original 
agreement to have two face-to-face debates, one in Southern California and one 
in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein then accepted the offer of KPIX to air such a debate from its San 
Francisco studios next Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday evenings. Wilson, through 
his campaign manager, George Gorton, declared the proposal unacceptable because 
of other campaign commitments. 
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday evening, both sides acknowledged that the prospect of a second 
debate was dead unless one campaign or the other reconsidered its stance. That 
did not seem likely. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter faxed to Wilson in Washington, Feinstein said: "A hastily planned 
exchange in San Diego is no substitute for a second debate in Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"With the election just around the corner, a face-to-face discussion between 
the two candidates for governor would give Californians one last opportunity to 
compare our views and goals for the state," she said. 
</P>
<P>
KPIX had offered broadcast times on Saturday and Sunday afternoons and Tuesday, 
Wednesday and Thursday evenings. Acknowledging that Wilson would have 
difficulty returning from Washington for a weekend meeting, Feinstein opted for 
any of the weekday openings. But Gorton said that no longer was possible. 
</P>
<P>
"Nope," he said, "we're not going to. We've had to compress two weeks' events 
into one last week." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was forced to return to Washington for overtime sessions of Congress on 
the budget and other matters, in part because of campaign pressure from 
Feinstein, who criticized him for missing Senate votes. 
</P>
<P>
Gorton added: "We can't give up three of the last seven days of the campaign. 
Dianne Feinstein knows that." 
</P>
<P>
He rejected Feinstein's argument that the San Diego station could not have 
assembled a statewide network for a debate tonight on such short notice. He 
said KNSD could have taken over the linkup of other California stations that 
had already agreed to broadcast the KPIX debate. 
</P>
<P>
The first hourlong debate originated in Burbank on Oct. 7. The second was to 
have been in San Francisco last Thursday.

AT LONG LAST, HUMPHREY LEAVES BAY FOR OPEN SEA 
</P>

<P>
Humphrey the humpback whale swam out the Golden Gate to freedom Wednesday, once 
again ending a successful rescue effort to save the world's most celebrated 
cetacean. 
</P>
<P>
For the second time in five years, a flotilla of boats escorted the 40-foot 
marine mammal out of San Francisco Bay and into the Pacific as hundreds of 
people lined the shore to watch. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel wonderfully exhausted," said Patrick Brady, a rescue volunteer who, at 
one point, stayed up through the night to aid the trapped whale. "It was well 
worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey, who had been towed from the muddy bay bottom Tuesday by a U.S. Coast 
Guard boat, was discovered Wednesday morning still swimming in the bay south of 
the Bay Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers from the California Marine Mammal Center and members of the Coast 
Guard resumed their rescue efforts, banging on metal pipes dangling in the 
water. The noisy action drove the whale out of the bay at precisely 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The three-day rescue was just a brief reminder of Humphrey's 26-day sojourn 
into San Francisco Bay and up the Sacramento River five years ago this month. 
Frequently seen in the waters off Northern California since, he swam back into 
the bay on Sunday. Whale experts had no explanation for his unusual behavior, 
except to say that he is an unusual whale. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we'll ever figure out why he came back," said Marc Webber, a 
marine biologist with the Marine Mammal Center who helped coordinate the 
rescue. "Maybe he's got a screw -- or a flipper -- loose." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Webber said Humphrey had tremendous value to his endangered 
species as an envoy who touched the hearts of humans. 
</P>
<P>
"What he's done in his life has really galvanized a lot of interest in whales 
and drawn people closer to whales," Webber said. 
</P>
<P>
The rescue provided whale scientists with some of their closest contact ever 
with a live humpback -- including at one point standing on his flippers while 
he was beached near Candlestick Park for 24 hours Monday and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very gentle with us," said Jan Roletto, curator of the Marine Mammal 
Center. "He could easily have crushed us." 
</P>
<P>
Although rescuers coaxed Humprhey to within several miles of the Golden Gate 
before dark Tuesday, he swam back south of the Bay Bridge during the night and 
was discovered there Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-ton whale spent much of the day swimming back and forth in the channel 
between San Francisco and Yerba Buena Island -- in sight of the city's 
financial district. 
</P>
<P>
For more than three hours, he resisted the efforts of rescuers to herd him 
under the bridge. The team members pounded on their metal pipes with hammers -- 
the same technique used by Japanese fishermen to catch dolphins and by rescuers 
five years ago to herd Humphrey out of the Sacramento River. 
</P>
<P>
This time however, Humphrey repeatedly dived under water only to come up for 
air behind the line of boats. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at about 3 p.m., he swam slowly under the Bay Bridge, meandered past 
San Francisco, spouted once under the Golden Gate Bridge and headed out to sea. 
Half-a-dozen Coast Guard and private vessels followed him more than a mile, 
just before sunset, to make sure he did not come back. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey has shown remarkable resilience. Whale experts said he appeared to be 
healthy, despite spending 24 hours stranded in mud. 
</P>
<P>
"He seems to be swimming and diving pretty well," Webber said. "That's a good 
sign. So far, he doesn't seem to be showing any sign of ill-effects." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the rescue of Humphrey has been a low-budget effort made up 
primarily of volunteers from the Marine Mammal Center. Coast Guard Lt. Jim Cash 
said the only additional cost for his operations was the fuel for the boats, 
which so far had amounted to $170. 
</P>
<P>
However, a $17,000 underwater transmitter that was used in an attempt to lure 
Humphrey with whale sounds, was ruined after it was stuck in the mud Tuesday.

Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh will call an election over bitter 
religious and caste issues dividing India, senior officials of his Janata Dal 
party said Wednesday as tensions rose across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
At least 20 people were killed and many injured in religious violence after a 
Hindu revivalist party called a general strike in India to protest the arrest 
of its leader. 
</P>
<P>
Janata Dal officials said Singh is confident of winning elections likely to be 
held towards the end of December, little more than a year after he took power 
at the head of a minority government supported by a right-wing Hindu party and 
leftist groups. 
</P>
<P>
Singh said President Ramaswami Venkataraman agreed to call a special session of 
Parliament in early November for a vote of confidence after the Hindu 
revivalist group, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), withdrew its support from 
the minority government. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said Singh would call elections whether he wins or loses the 
confidence vote, convinced that there is no possibility of reconciliation with 
the BJP. 
</P>
<P>
The BJP withdrew its support Tuesday after authorities arrested party leader 
Lal Krisha Advani to halt his march to Ayodhya, about 300 miles southeast of 
New Delhi, where he had vowed to build a temple on land occupied by a 
16th-Century mosque.

IRA PROXY BOMBINGS KILL 6 TROOPS, CIVILIAN;

NORTHERN IRELAND: THE ATTACK BY THE TERRORIST GROUP IS THE DEADLIEST AGAINST 
BRITISH FORCES IN TWO YEARS.

The Irish Republican Army executed its most deadly attacks on British forces in 
two years Wednesday, forcing civilians to deliver car bombs that killed six 
soldiers in nearly simultaneous incidents at two border checkpoints. One 
civilian also died and at least 20 people were wounded, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the widow of the civilian victim, Patsy Gillespie, he was ordered 
by IRA gunmen to drive a car packed with an estimated 1,000 pounds of 
explosives into the Londonderry border post about 4 a.m. Gillespie and five 
soldiers were killed, and 10 people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
About 15 minutes later, a van exploded at a checkpoint south of Newry, although 
the driver, a 65-year-old man whose family was being held hostage by the IRA, 
was able to shout a warning before the bomb went off. One soldier died and 10 
others were wounded in that incident. 
</P>
<P>
The driver at Newry suffered a broken leg as he dashed from the car seconds 
before it blew up. 
</P>
<P>
The blasts at opposite ends of the province were believed to be in retaliation 
for the fatal shooting two weeks ago of Dessie Grew, a leading IRA gunman 
suspected of several killings in Northern Ireland and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The day's violence could have been even worse. A third car bomb, piloted by a 
man who had been beaten and tied to the driver's seat, failed to explode fully 
outside a police station in Omagh, about midway between the sites of the two 
other blasts. 
</P>
<P>
All three coerced drivers apparently were targeted by the IRA because they 
worked in British security installations -- an IRA tactic, in effect, to kill 
two birds with one stone. 
</P>
<P>
"All three of these people worked for . . . British forces," said Richard 
McAuley, a spokesman for Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal political wing. "In other 
circumstances, the IRA would have been trying to kill these people anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie, a cook at the Ft. George police barracks in Londonderry, four months 
ago had been ordered to drive his wife's car, packed with 200 pounds of 
explosives, to his work address. 
</P>
<P>
"But that time he came home," his tearful widow, Kathleen, said in an interview 
at her Londonderry home. The masked IRA gunman this time had said her husband 
would be returned home within half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so angry, so devastated," she said. "I just can't believe people could be 
so cruel to make somebody do this. . . . What am I going to do?" 
</P>
<P>
Peter Brooke, secretary of state for Northern Ireland, vowed before the House 
of Commons in London that the escalation of the IRA terror campaign would not 
derail his currently foundering efforts to forge talks between the 
predominantly Protestant Unionist parties, which favor continued unity with 
Britain, and the Catholic nationalist Social Democratic and Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
An array of British and Irish politicians condemned as "ghoulish" Wednesday's 
use of civilians in so-called "proxy" bomb attacks, part of the IRA's 20-year 
campaign to force a British troop withdrawal from the province. 
</P>
<P>
"Proxy bombing is the most lethal form of bombing because it is so hard to 
detect. It is also the most cowardly," said Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the 
Socialist party and the member of Parliament representing Newry. 
</P>
<P>
"To use a 65-year-old man to do this, to kill in this way," he said, "is not 
just an act of barbarity, it is an act of sheer cowardice." 
</P>
<P>
Police in the Republic of Ireland detained five men Wednesday in Letterkerny, 
just across the border from the bombed Londonderry checkpoint, on suspicion of 
participation in the bombing.

CHENEY, BAKER SILENT ON ATTACKING IRAQ; 
</P>
<P>
POLICY: ONE SENATOR SEES 'DRIFT, MUDDLE AND CONFUSION' IN PRESIDENT'S GULF 
PROGRAM.

<P>
Top Bush Administration officials refused Wednesday to indicate to lawmakers 
whether they would attack Iraq in the absence of further provocation, and one 
senator complained he was concerned that "drift, muddle and confusion" are 
seeping into the President's Persian Gulf policies. 
</P>
<P>
A closed-door congressional briefing by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III seemed to do little to allay the concerns 
of many lawmakers who complain that the Administration seems to have no clear 
plan, or at least is not willing to share it with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional anxiety over the imminent possibility of war has grown in recent 
days following statements by senior Administration officials that no further 
Iraqi provocations would be needed to justify military action by the United 
States and its allies in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, as well as new evidence that American hostages in 
Iraq are being mistreated by their captors, already constitute sufficient 
grounds for a military response, the officials have asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers at both briefings said that they sought assurances from Baker and 
Cheney that the United States would not launch an attack on Iraq without 
consulting first with Congress. But as they have in the past, the two men 
declined to give those assurances, arguing that to do so would tip off the 
Iraqis about U.S. plans. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned that war with Iraq could erupt after Congress adjourns for the year 
next week, House and Senate leaders formed a bipartisan committee of lawmakers 
to stay in consultation with the Administration during the adjournment. House 
Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.) also said Congress would be called into session if needed to deal with 
the gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
During the briefing, Baker and Cheney reportedly told lawmakers that as 
economic sanctions begin to inflict real hardships on Iraq, the danger of an 
Iraqi attack may also increase. Illinois Rep. Henry J. Hyde, the ranking 
Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the officials told the 
lawmakers that one possible scenario is an Iraqi attack against Israel as an 
"act of desperation" aimed at splitting the U.S.-Arab alliance against Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
However, most of the lawmakers who were briefed by Baker and Cheney complained 
that neither official would indicate what the Administration's next moves in 
the gulf crisis will be. 
</P>
<P>
"They just kept saying what they've been saying all along, that they're not 
ruling anything in and they're not ruling anything out," said Rep. Jolene 
Unsoeld (D-Wash.). "They added nothing new at all." 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a plain vanilla briefing," added Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), a 
member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who attended a separate session 
Baker and Cheney held for senators. "No new ground was broken." 
</P>
<P>
"If there is an Iraqi provocation and they decide to respond to it with force, 
my guess is they'll do it first and consult later," said Rep. Les Aspin 
(D-Wis.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
But Aspin added that neither official would indicate whether the Administration 
would resort to force in the absence of an Iraqi provocation. "They are just 
not answering those kinds of questions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hyde, who along with Aspin is a member of the group that will be 
consulting with the Administration on the gulf crisis during adjournment, said 
that there was "no saber-rattling" in the briefings by Baker and Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a holding action and our troops are still in a defensive posture. . . . 
There was no hint of initiating any military action against Saddam Hussein," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
While most lawmakers clearly are worried about the possibility that the 
Administration might decide to attack Iraq, concern also appears to be growing 
that the current stalemate is beginning to work against the alliance of Arab 
and Western forces aligned against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how long they can continue this policy, whether they can go 
through Thanksgiving and Christmas and have this policy last," said Rep. Larry 
Smith (D-Fla.), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. "At some 
point, the Rubicon (for military action) is going to have to be crossed." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.), arguing on the Senate floor that Congress should 
formally declare war on Iraq, said that, after a "skillful" beginning, the 
Administration's confrontation with Iraq now appears to be faltering. 
</P>
<P>
"I begin to see serious cracks in the edifice. Drift, muddle and confusion are 
beginning to replace the confident spirit of August. Now we seem uncertain what 
to do with the forces we have amassed," said Wallop, who also urged the 
Administration to decide on the course it plans to follow in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"Our Arab friends are fearful of being swamped by a wave of popular favor for 
Saddam that grows with each day of his successful defiance. If he offers the 
Arab states a deal, they just might take it and leave us holding the bag," 
Wallop warned. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers said Baker also raised concerns that Hussein was trying to undermine 
the anti-Iraqi alliance by using the Western hostages he holds as bargaining 
chips. 
</P>
<P>
"Saddam Hussein is making a lot of efforts to break up the coalition, and one 
of the things he is doing is inviting people to Baghdad, where they go through 
this dog-and-pony show, pose for some pictures and get some hostages out," 
Aspin said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Baker told the congressmen that Iraq recently invited the Canadian and 
German foreign ministers to Baghdad with the promise that some of their hostage 
nationals would be released if they accepted. The invitations were declined, 
but Iraq is still trying to use the hostages as levers to drive a wedge in the 
alliance, Aspin said. 
</P>
<P>
In another development reflecting congressional concern about the situation in 
the gulf, the Senate voted 76 to 23 Wednesday to approve a $15.5-billion 
foreign aid bill that forgives $6.7 billion in Egyptian military debt and 
authorizes up to $700 million in new arms transfers to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Passage of the bill had been stalled by a Republican filibuster over a 
provision granting aid to international family planning agencies that fund 
abortions. That issue was resolved when Sen. Tim Wirth (D-Colo.), the sponsor 
of the provision, agreed to remove it from the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The aid bill still faces a possible veto threat over a provision cutting 
military aid to El Salvador by 50%. But Democrats said they believe that Bush 
will withdraw the threat and accept the Salvador cut in return for getting the 
Egyptian debt forgiveness, which Baker has characterized as essential to the 
Administration's efforts to hold the U.S.-Arab alliance against Iraq together.

GUN SALES BRISK AS FEAR STALKS JERUSALEM; 
</P>
<P>
ISRAEL CRISIS: PROTECTION AND REVENGE ARE MUCH ON THE MINDS OF BOTH 
PALESTINIANS AND JEWS. 
</P>

JERUSALEM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The clientele at the Krav gun shop and shooting range in Jerusalem has grown 
more numerous and more demanding, a measure of the fear and tension that have 
gripped the city over the last three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli men came in Wednesday to trade their small-caliber weapons for 
something heavier. Women came to take up pistols for the first time in their 
lives. Young workers considered renewing a daily familiarity with guns they 
thought they had left behind with their army service. 
</P>
<P>
For Palestinians, too, protection is much on their minds, although they are 
prohibited by law from buying guns. So residents in Arab neighborhoods and the 
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip are shuttering windows and staying indoors 
for fear of reprisal attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Revenge is also much on the minds of Israeli and Palestinian alike: stabbings, 
beatings, roving bands of vigilante groups, threatening declarations from 
underground groups, police patrols -- all are on the rise. Ever since police 
killed 21 Palestinian rioters on the Temple Mount earlier this month, Jerusalem 
has been splitting at the seams. 
</P>
<P>
"No one knows how long this will go on," Shalom Uziel, manager of the Krav 
shop, said. "But people feel they must protect themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Israel's leaders are forecasting that the fever will pass -- some say sooner, 
some later. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir estimates that Jerusalem will return 
to a normal but still tense state of affairs in a few days' time, while Defense 
Minister Moshe Arens expects it to take a few months. 
</P>
<P>
There is no budging from an unwillingness to open peace talks with 
Palestinians, since in the government view, Palestinian violence is innate and 
hysterical. 
</P>
<P>
"What prevails among them," Arens said, "are the fanatic and brutal drives, the 
lack of respect for human lives, which is typical not only for some of the 
Palestinian population in the territories but also for some of the Arab 
countries." 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian analysts also believe the violence will subside. There is no 
tactical advantage, they say, to the risks of escalation of the Arab uprising, 
especially because the spotlight could shift suddenly to the Kuwait crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Yet of the many explosions of civil violence between Israelis and Palestinians 
in the past three years, this has been the longest and bitterest. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a 39-year-old Palestinian died of a beating at the hands of 
Israelis who caught him Tuesday in the act of stabbing two women soldiers near 
Haifa. The women were both hospitalized, one with a punctured lung. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, someone representing a shadowy group called Eye for an Eye 
telephoned television and radio stations to claim responsibility for the ambush 
shooting death of a Palestinian laborer. No arrests have been made; police and 
witnesses say Israeli civilians shot the Palestinian and three companions from 
a moving vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Arens called for an end to the revenge and vigilante attacks. 
</P>
<P>
"I call on the entire Israeli population, Jew and Arab, to avoid these acts," 
he said. "They break the law; they are against the interests of the state of 
Israel. There are security forces to deal with the people endangering our 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, all was quiet. Palestinians were barred from entering Israel from 
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. In Tel Aviv, Palestinians who 
customarily sleep in the city to avoid returning home from work each day were 
routed from their hiding places and sent to the territories. 
</P>
<P>
Strains in Jerusalem were evident mainly in the extra patrols of paired police 
officers at many intersections and the number of police vans moving through the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem has become a curious focus of two kinds of war fever -- worry about 
attack from abroad and worry about civil conflict at home. 
</P>
<P>
Residents are being issued gas masks in preparation for a possible attack from 
Iraq. What do the people consider the more worrisome, poison gas or revenge 
killings? 
</P>
<P>
"I think gas attack is less likely," said George Jamid, a plumber who was 
picking up masks for his wife and children at a school in East Jerusalem. 
"People here are afraid the Jews will come in and attack us. I used to work in 
Jewish neighborhoods. But not anymore. It is too dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Across town in Jewish West Jerusalem, two secretaries entered the Krav gun shop 
to buy a pistol. Manager Uziel recommended a .22-caliber Beretta, which is 
lighter than the 9-millimeter pistol he recommends for men. But on learning 
that the women are from Jerusalem, he told them they need special permission 
from the Interior Ministry to buy a gun and that they probably could not get 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Uziel estimates that more than 100 customers a day have come to his store to 
inquire about buying a gun since Sunday, when three Israelis were stabbed to 
death by a Palestinian laborer. Before Sunday, the average number was fewer 
than 20. 
</P>
<P>
In general, Israeli private citizens are not permitted to own guns unless they 
live or work in the occupied West Bank or Gaza Strip. Soldiers on active duty 
are often seen carrying rifles through the city; pistols are usually seen on 
police officers and settlers.

S. AFRICA PANEL PROPOSES BLACK VOTE, WHITE RIGHTS 
</P>

<P>
A parliamentary advisory body on Wednesday recommended a constitution for South 
Africa that would extend voting rights to the black majority but protect the 
political rights of whites. 
</P>
<P>
President Frederik W. de Klerk's government has yet to put forth a formal 
constitutional proposal. The plan recommended Wednesday loosely resembles other 
blueprints under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
These blueprints are likely to provide the guidelines for the government as it 
enters into constitutional negotiations with the African National Congress and 
other opposition groups, black and white, perhaps early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's proposal, which is not binding on the government, emerged from the 
constitutional committee of the President's Council. This is an advisory 
commission in which all the parties in the racially segregated Parliament are 
represented but which is controlled by De Klerk's National Party. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls for a two-chamber Parliament, with one house elected on the 
basis of proportional representation to satisfy black demands for one person, 
one vote, and the other elected on racial or regional lines. It also recommends 
a bill of rights. 
</P>
<P>
The council report, issued by Chairman Willie van Niekerk, warns that the 
success of a new political system in South Africa will depend on the protection 
of whites, who are outnumbered 5 to 1 by blacks. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC, which many analysts believe would win a popular election in South 
Africa, has strongly opposed enshrining minority rights in any future 
constitution. It argues that a bill of rights, enforced by a strong judiciary, 
would provide ample protection for minorities. 
</P>
<P>
"What we see being floated by the government shows they've still got a long way 
to go to reach any acceptable democratic position," Albie Sachs, a member of 
the African National Congress' constitutional committee, said in an interview 
Wednesday. "They don't want power sharing, they want power division, so they 
can hold on to power in crucial areas." 
</P>
<P>
The President's Council proposal resembles a blueprint suggested recently by 
the Broederbond (Brotherhood), the secret Afrikaner society that has helped 
draw up much of the government's reform program. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk has said he supports a constitution that contains checks and balances 
to prevent the 27 million blacks from dominating the 5 million whites.

WALSH ALLEGES THORNBURGH BLOCKED DATA; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITY: INDEPENDENT COUNSEL ACCUSES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF JOINING WITH THE 
CIA TO PREVENT DISCLOSURE OF AGENCY'S ROLE IN AIDING THE CONTRAS.

<P>
The Iran-Contra prosecutor Wednesday accused Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh of 
joining with the CIA to block public disclosure of the extent of the 
intelligence agency's involvement in illegal support of the Nicaraguan rebels. 
</P>
<P>
In a 12-page report to the chairmen and ranking minority members of the Senate 
and House Intelligence committees, independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh 
questioned "the power of intelligence agencies to frustrate investigations of 
their own misconduct by professing exaggerated concerns for the preservation of 
national security." 
</P>
<P>
A Justice Department official denied that Thornburgh and the CIA had attempted 
to cover up wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh's criticism marked his strongest attack yet on Thornburgh's Oct. 12 
decision blocking disclosure of classified information that led to the 
dismissal of false statement and obstructing investigation charges against 
Joseph F. Fernandez, former CIA station chief in Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
And the Justice Department, in a letter of its own to the lawmakers, said that 
the prosecution was dropped because of a tactical decision by Walsh early in 
the litigation and belittled the case as "a relatively weak one." 
</P>
<P>
W. Lee Rawls, assistant attorney general for legislative affairs, said that 
"those . . . familiar with the case" had said it would not have been brought 
"had Fernandez been willing to cooperate with the prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
While a criminal conviction of Fernandez might have spurred his cooperation, 
Rawls said, there are other mechanisms available to elicit it, an obvious 
reference to giving the former CIA official immunity from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
James Reynolds, a career Justice Department lawyer who has worked on its legal 
positions relating to Walsh's efforts, said: "Obviously, the attorney general 
and the CIA are not engaging in collusion to cover up wrongdoing." 
</P>
<P>
The CIA did not respond to a request for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual public exchange of criticism by two federal prosecutive arms could 
be a preview of the intense dispute expected in 1992 when the independent 
counsel statute comes up for renewal. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh promised "a more comprehensive presentation" on the power of intelligence 
agencies to block investigations when he makes his final report to Congress, 
expected next year. 
</P>
<P>
"But this brief supplemental report concerns the present capability of agency 
(CIA) lawyers to exhaust and frustrate courts and independent prosecutors 
confronted with problems of law enforcement," Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the move by Fernandez to disclose secret U.S. projects in Costa 
Rica and the location of CIA facilities in Central America to support his 
defense that CIA headquarters had detailed information about the program to 
resupply the Contras and that it encouraged the efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, in upholding the Fernandez position last 
month, said that the key to his defense "was to use the fact of massive CIA 
involvement in the resupply operation" to prove that he had not misrepresented 
his involvement. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said that 15 months elapsed between a federal judge's ruling favoring 
Fernandez and Thornburgh's final decision that the information could not be 
disclosed without grave damage to national security. 
</P>
<P>
"The attorney general and the CIA not only frustrated the public development of 
this proof, but did so in a manner that exasperated the district court and 
dragged out the resolution of this issue in unproductive litigation," Walsh 
said in his report.

POLICE PROBE CLUES LINKING VICTIMS OF S.F. SHOOT-OUT

A gunman who killed a prominent attorney and then was slain by police in an 
office shoot-out was closing his gospel ministry in the building after saying 
he was ill, a building spokeswoman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"He had given his notice a couple of weeks ago that he was going to be vacating 
the premises," said Denise Spisak, assistant manager of the James Flood 
Building, where the shooting occurred at about lunchtime Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he was not well -- that's why he was going," Spisak said. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Wadsworth's telephone service also had been cut off for his Living 
Gospel Outreach office on the third floor of the historic building. 
</P>
<P>
Police say Wadsworth shot Garfield Steward outside the attorney's sixth-floor 
office, then was killed in a gunfire exchange with police after he went back 
down to the third floor. Two officers received minor gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Police theorize that the 64-year-old Wadsworth, who lived in San Leandro, was a 
disgruntled casual friend of Steward, 75, of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently the relationship had soured when some legal settlement went awry," 
Police Inspector Earl Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
Jasmine Wadsworth, daughter of the gunman, didn't comment on her father's 
health. But she said he had been angry because he had paid Steward $13,000 to 
handle a 1983 divorce but then had to go to another lawyer to complete the 
case. Wadsworth had been unable to get back his money, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Steward's son, Daniel, said Wednesday that he wasn't aware of any dispute over 
money between the two.

BLUM'S MONEY RESCUED S&amp;L, RECORDS SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS FRANTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No business deal has drawn more fire during the gubernatorial campaign than 
Richard C. Blum's stake in a financially troubled savings and loan in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
A TV ad for Sen. Pete Wilson alleged that Blum and his wife, Dianne Feinstein, 
"own" the thrift and profited from a "sweetheart" government bailout in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But according to documents and sources familiar with the matter, Blum money 
helped rescue the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
First, records show the investment is held by Blum's firm, not by him and his 
wife. Second, outside accountants who recently evaluated the deal for 
regulators offered no criticism of its terms. In addition, the amount of 
government aid was decided months before Blum became involved. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 1988 thrift bailouts were negotiated between government regulators 
and private investors. Critics have argued that the government was outsmarted, 
resulting in deals that were too generous with taxpayer money. 
</P>
<P>
But with Jackson County Savings &amp; Loan in Medford, the rescue's terms were 
set in advance, before a purchaser was on the scene. The regulators determined 
that the government would provide $63 million in assistance and require $14 
million in cash from investors. The new money was to be raised by selling stock 
in the thrift to the public. 
</P>
<P>
A Columbus, Ohio, investment bank was hired by the regulators to sell the stock 
in October, 1988. Charles R. Webb, one of the Columbus bankers, said less than 
half of the stock was sold during the next two months and the deal was in 
danger of failing. 
</P>
<P>
Webb said he then contacted Carl D. Gustavson, a San Francisco bank executive 
and a Feinstein appointee to the city Redevelopment Commission, and Gustavson 
agreed to try to raise the remaining cash. 
</P>
<P>
Two San Francisco investment bankers said they turned down Gustavson's 
solicitation, but Blum eventually agreed to provide some of the needed cash. 
His investment firm wound up acquiring a 24.9% interest in Jackson County 
Savings and a seat on its board. 
</P>
<P>
If Blum had not stepped in, it would have cost the government an estimated 
$87.6 million to close the institution and pay off depositors, according to 
Webb and a regulatory executive familiar with the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the savings and loan reported a profit of $1.3 million, a figure that 
reflected $4.9 million in government assistance. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilson campaign has refused to back down from the ad's assertions. "Blum 
has a controlling stock interest and we're just saying that he was a 
beneficiary of the government's generosity," said Bill Livingstone, Wilson's 
campaign spokesman.

LABOR, WOMEN ADDING TO FEINSTEIN FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Democrat Dianne Feinstein is pulling in big money from organized labor, 
traditional party loyalists and women as she tries to become California's first 
woman governor. 
</P>
<P>
Together, she and her husband, Richard C. Blum, are the largest donor, having 
lent the campaign $3 million during the primary. And in the latest reporting 
period, ended Sept. 30, organized labor provided about $1 million, or roughly 
$1 of every $5 that Feinstein raised, campaign finance records show. 
</P>
<P>
A large number of her donors have been women, but with some exceptions, the 
size of their checks has been modest. Few women have given more than $1,000, 
and many have donated $100 or less, campaign finance reports show. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a lot to give," said Jane Hasler Henick, co-chair of a state 
political action committee of the National Women's Political Caucus, a 
Feinstein supporter. "We women are writing checks for $100. If we had more, 
we'd write checks for more." 
</P>
<P>
One exception is Deborah Castleman, 36, an electrical engineer and public 
policy analyst for the RAND Corp. in Santa Monica. Castleman is not wealthy, 
but she is a believer -- so much so that she raided her savings of $28,000 and 
donated it to Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care about money for retirement. This is more important," Castleman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Castleman became a believer after she heard Feinstein speak to a gathering of 
the Los Angeles Women's Campaign Fund in Beverly Hills in May, 1989. In 
addition to donating her own $28,000, Castleman has prodded family, friends and 
acquaintences to donate another $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I very much believe in the power of role models," she said. "They are a 
powerful influence. I have a lot of nieces. I want them to see that a woman can 
be governor." 
</P>
<P>
Feminist Beverly Hills attorney Gloria Allred also has been working hard for 
Feinstein, having raised $50,000 by early October. Allred expects to raise at 
least $40,000 more. 
</P>
<P>
"Our daughters should have an opportunity to see a woman at the highest 
position of our state government," Allred said, adding that Feinstein is the 
first candidate for whom she has sought donations. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein had raised about $10 million through Sept. 30, compared to $19.4 
million for Sen. Pete Wilson. Feinstein and Wilson both received about one of 
every three contributions from women, according to a random Times survey of 
5,000 contributions to each candidate during the most recent filing period. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, who hopes to raise at least another $4 million by the Nov. 6 
election, saw her fortunes change dramatically when a federal judge last month 
struck down a $1,000 limit on individual contributions. 
</P>
<P>
During the four days between the judge's ruling and Sept. 30, she raised more 
than $900,000. Her biggest single gift -- $150,000 -- came from the California 
Highway Patrol officers political action committee. 
</P>
<P>
Other six-figure donors listed in the latest report were the Los Angeles County 
District Council of Carpenters, which gave $110,000, and the United Food and 
Commercial Workers, which gave $106,000. 
</P>
<P>
John Plaxco, her chief fund-raiser, said the campaign made a "conscious effort" 
to avoid money from the insurance industry, tobacco concerns and oil companies. 
Her finance reports reflect little or no money coming from these sources. Nor 
is there money coming from sources identifiable as being affiliated with horse 
racing or other gambling interests. There are relatively minor amounts from the 
liquor industry. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein received $5,000 from the California Real Estate political action 
committee. Sacramento developer Angelo Tsakopoulous, a friend of San Francisco 
Mayor Art Agnos, gave $22,000. Concord developer Kenneth H. Hoffman gave 
$100,000. Tens of thousands more dollars have come from an array of San 
Francisco developers, companies that contracted with the city and political 
allies from Feinstein's days as mayor of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Several Democratic politicians are working hard for Feinstein. Rep. Nancy 
Pelosi (D-San Francisco) has given the most so far, $12,000, and has raised 
$33,500 more, the latest report showed.

CITY COUNCIL TO PUT OFF POLICE COMMISSION MEETING ON GATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unusual meeting between the Los Angeles City Council and the Police 
Commission will be put off indefinitely while the commission conducts an 
inquiry into recent statements by Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, requested last week by the City Council, had been tentatively set 
for Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was scheduled at the urging of Councilman Robert Farrell, who said 
he was dissatisfied with the commission's apparent lack of interest in Gates' 
statement last month that casual drug users should be shot. 
</P>
<P>
However, Farrell said Wednesday that because the commission has decided to look 
more closely at the matter, he will move to postpone the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
City Council President John Ferraro, whose office was organizing the session, 
said Wednesday that no new date will be selected until Farrell renews his 
request. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Commission, a five-member panel appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley, has 
ultimate policy authority over the Police Department. The City Council has the 
authority to approve or reject Bradley's nominees. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell said he is concerned whether the commission is exerting adequate 
authority over the Police Department in light of Gates' statement. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is whether there is a single standard of justice for people who wear 
police uniforms," Farrell said. The commission's inaction, he said, was a 
signal to lower-ranking members of the department that their superiors are 
"immune" from disciplinary action.

"The Crimson Pirate" (1952), directed by Robert Siodmak. 104 minutes. No 
rating. 
</P>
<P>
A spoof of those Errol Flynn pirate movies. The pirates say "Arrrgh!" a lot and 
get their peg-legs stuck in the grills over the hatches. And this time it's 
Burt Lancaster who gets to be gallant as hell. M.F.

intensely suspenseful psycho-thriller (from the director of "Miami Vice " and 
"Crime Story") about a cop tracking a bizarre serial killer by discovering the 
killer instinct within himself. With "Crime Story's" Dennis Farina and Stephen

"The Thing" (1951), directed by Christian Nyby. 87 minutes. No rating. 
</P>
<P>
Among the first in a spate of '50s sci-fi films, this black-and-white movie is 
said to have inspired many contemporary filmmakers and movies. It's 
intentionally spare and direct, but there's wit in the script: The alien turns 
out to be a vegetable. 
</P>
<P>
"Vampire's Kiss" (1989), directed by Robert Bierman. 96 minutes. Rated R. A 
contemporary spin on the vampire fantasy, with Nicolas Cage as a neurotic New 
Yorker who thinks a one-night stand (Jennifer Beals) has turned him into 
Dracula. May be too offbeat for horror fans, but this clever, cartoon-ish 
metaphor has bite.MARK CHALON SMITH

"Picnic at Hanging Rock" (1975), directed by Peter Weir. 115 minutes. Rated R. 
An early gem from the director of "Dead Poets' Society" and "Witness," this one 
is set in 1900 Australia, where three girls and their teacher vanish while on a 
school outing. 
</P>
<P>
A psychedelic/supernatural story supposedly based on an actual account. 
</P>
<P>
"Miracle Mile" (1989), directed by Steve DeJarnatt. 87 minutes. Rated R. Among 
the best of the nuclear apocalyptic films, the mood of this one resembles that 
of the quirky "After Midnight." A man races against time after mistakenly 
receiving a message that missiles have been launched and World War III is an 
hour away. "The Haunting" (1963), directed by Robert Wise. 112 minutes. No 
rating. This ghost story will give you sweaty palms, high blood pressure, just 
about everything a scary movie should, without fake decapitations and gallons 
of fake blood -- just a plot, some chilling sound effects and superb 
black-and-white photography. Not to mention a cast headed by Julie Harris and 
Claire Bloom. ERIK HAMILTON

THE CORNER BAR: ENDEARING SIMPLICITY AND HARLEY-DAVIDSONS MEET AT COOK'S CORNER

<P>
Its exterior and furnishings are as rough as the canyons that surround this 
South County establishment, which is on a fork where El Toro Road ends and 
Santiago Canyon and Live Oak Canyon roads begin. 
</P>
<P>
Cook's Corner is one of perhaps the last country bars in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
If you are looking for ferns, mineral water and yuppie snacks, then it's best 
to head out to El Toro, Mission Viejo or beyond. 
</P>
<P>
There is an endearing simplicity about this bar. It serves only beer (including 
European and Mexican labels) and wine. 
</P>
<P>
A short-order cook fries up burgers and the like. Recommended are the roast 
beef and turkey sandwiches, each for $3.50. Side orders of calorie-rich potato 
salad will fill you up. 
</P>
<P>
Two pool tables attract a steady stream of players at 50 cents a game. 
</P>
<P>
Customers can watch sports on a large TV screen and two smaller screens. During 
"Monday Night Football," the bar offers two rounds of draft beer for $1. 
</P>
<P>
The jukebox is heavy on nostalgia rock and country music. No piped-in Cocteau 
Twins or Joni Mitchell here. 
</P>
<P>
The place has a patio, and always nearby it seems are several Harley-Davidsons 
and their riders exchanging road talk. 
</P>
<P>
A historian once called Cook's Corner the "last rebel outpost" in Orange County 
because of the bikers who roar in and out of this place. 
</P>
<P>
It may look like a rough place to spend an evening, but it's strictly a 
live-and-let-live atmosphere. It's country, not urban; rustic, not 
sophisticated. The regulars are laid back and friendly. 
</P>
<P>
So if you are looking for hyper, fast-talking professional types, well . . . 
have you considered moving to Chicago? 
</P>
<P>
 Cook's Corner, 19122 El Toro Road, El Toro. Open daily 8 a.m. (bar opens at 
9:30 a.m.) to 2 a.m. (714) 858-0266.

By day it's just another pastel-colored Mexican restaurant. But after 9 p.m., 
the rather small dance floor is generally packed with a youthful mix ranging 
from long-haired rockers to close-shaved hip-hoppers. The sound system is good, 
meaning that the only place for intimate conversation is out in the parking 
lot. CHERYLANNE BEALER

HAPPY BIRTHDAY: Seal Beach, celebrating its 75th anniversary this weekend, was 
not always the upscale, upstanding town it is now. . . . In the Roaring '20s, 
it attracted hordes of actors for Cecil B. DeMille's "Ten Commandments" (look 
for oil wells behind the pursuing Egyptians), and drew carnival crowds to watch 
aviators loop the loop (and occasionally crash). . . . With prostitution and 
gambling, it was also the closest thing to a Sin City the county ever had.

BLUFF CALLED: A bronze sculpture, titled "The Hide Drogher," on Wednesday 
became the crowning piece to Dana Point's new Blufftop Trail, honoring 
19th-Century traders in skins. . . . And what better way to salute the city's 
first large commercial venture than with another commercial venture? The statue 
was paid for -- along with the two-block-long walkway, a bridge and a viewing 
area on the blufftop -- by a Newport Beach developer. In exchange, the company 
gets to build on the site. Chris Woodyard and Len Hall

Concrete drums containing nuclear waste have leaked plutonium into the ground 
near an area where hundreds of children play each day, a newspaper reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Parisien said the discovery of plutonium in soil samples shows 
there is a radioactive threat to residents of Saint Aubin, a town on the 
outskirts of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
But the official Atomic Energy Commissariat, in charge of France's nuclear 
program, said the plutonium discovered measured well below minimum danger 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
Le Parisien reported that an independent German scientific team from the 
University of Bremen conducted random samples on about nine pounds of soil 
gathered near the site.

Five former Persian Gulf hostages, including a Santa Ana construction worker, 
came home Wednesday night, with one praising his tough-talking President and 
all worrying about the fate of captives they left behind Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
They were among 14 Americans -- mostly ailing or elderly -- brought out of 
Baghdad on Wednesday through the efforts of an American-Iraqi group. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very elated to be at home," said Lloyd Graham, one of five American men 
who arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport at 8:10 p.m. aboard a 
Royal Jordanian flight. 
</P>
<P>
"The celebration won't start until all our friends and colleagues can come 
home, too," the 48-year-old Houston man told an airport news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, who suffers from arteriosclerosis and has undergone two quadruple 
bypass surgeries, appeared in good health, as did the others. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the flight was Jack Frazier, 53, of Santa Ana, who said he had been in 
Iraq doing construction work when the country invaded neighboring Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier told reporters that leaving the other hostages behind "was the hardest 
thing I've ever done in my life." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to be home. Morale is great," said a man who wouldn't give his name. 
He was identified by others at the news conference as Mark Ward of Middletown, 
N.J., a Marine sergeant attached to the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"George, keep up the good work," he said, apparently having heard of the 
President's statements about the crisis. "It's great to be back." 
</P>
<P>
After the invasion, the men stayed in private homes in the Baghdad area through 
U.S. Embassy arrangements. They said the Iraqis knew where they were. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier, Graham, Ward, Larry Murray and John Thompson were allowed to leave 
because either they or their relatives have medical problems, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Murray's wife, Sandy, who lives in the Houston area, said she "talked to him 
briefly and he seems to be doing very well. He's ready to come home." 
</P>
<P>
The trip was engineered by seven members of the American-Iraqi Foundation, a 
Washington, D.C.-based group of U.S. citizens of Iraqi descent, who met with 
Saddam Hussein for 2 1/2 hours Sunday.

CONGRESS VOTES $10 MILLION FOR NEW CHECKPOINT ON I-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Congress gave final approval Wednesday to a $10-million plan for the 
construction of a new Border Patrol checkpoint along Interstate 5, south of San 
Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
The action came as the Senate took final action on a spending bill for the 
Justice Department, which includes funds for the Border Patrol. The legislation 
already had cleared the House. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional approval all but assures that work on the long-sought expansion 
and relocation of the checkpoint will begin in the current fiscal year. 
President Bush is expected to sign the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The new, 16-lane checkpoint is not expected to be completed until 1995 and will 
cost an additional $20 million over the $10 million set aside Wednesday. 
Federal immigration authorities consider a new checkpoint to be vital in 
helping stem the flow of undocumented immigrants along Interstate 5, the 
region's busiest north-south artery. 
</P>
<P>
The San Clemente checkpoint is the busiest of 30 such Border Patrol 
installations from California to Texas, all on roads leading from the Mexican 
border. In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, agents based there made a 
record 75,000 arrests of undocumented migrants. Officers also regularly seize 
large caches of illicit drugs and other contraband. 
</P>
<P>
But authorities regard the current checkpoint, located about five miles south 
of San Clemente, as outdated and ill-suited to its mission. Plans call for 
redesigning the checkpoint and moving it three miles south. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the checkpoint say its presence on the heavily traveled corridor has 
contributed to accidents, chases and the deaths of undocumented immigrants who 
have tried to run across the interstate to elude authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, 12 people have died trying to cross the 
freeway near the checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
The Coalition for Immigrant Rights and Responsibilities, which is monitoring 
deaths near the checkpoint, says a new checkpoint is only part of the solution. 
The group has advocated placing more lights and warning signals along the 
freeways, along with launching a public awareness campaign directed at drivers 
and undocumented immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased that money is going to be expended to try to alleviate the 
obvious safety hazards at our existing checkpoint," said Lilia Powell, 
coalition executive director. "I hope they look at a whole package (of 
measures). This is a great opportunity to reshape that whole area."

SUNSET FOR HUNTINGTON PIER; 
</P>

REDEVELOPMENT: PASSAGE OF THE DECAYING 76-YEAR-OLD LANDMARK AND LOCAL

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Old age has been unkind to it. 
</P>
<P>
The once proud monarch of the town -- the Huntington Beach Pier -- now has a 
decayed and scabrous look. Bits of concrete fall off from time to time. 
Railings have not been repainted since the pier was closed two years ago for 
safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
This morning, the final destruction of the 76-year-old structure begins, but 
not before the city offers a "farewell salute to the old pier." A ceremonial 
bit of demolition will take place, with the major work to start Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Today's event is somewhat like an Irish wake, a gathering to cheer up the 
bereaved at the time of passing. The old pier is going to a resting place deep 
in the ocean; a new $11.9-million pier is coming, with construction to start in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
But even in its dying days, the old pier still dominates this bustling, rapidly 
changing community. Its image is everywhere: on drawings, paintings, T-shirts, 
business windows, sides of trucks and city publications. Most of all, though, 
the old pier is ingrained in the memories of Huntington Beach residents. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Thomas J. Mays, 36, recalls surfing at the pier in his teen-age years. 
</P>
<P>
"I also remember fishing on the pier," Mays said. "It's meant a lot to me. It 
means a lot to other people who have been around here for a long time. It's 
going to be a real emotional experience when they start taking it down." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John Erskine, who also surfs, said the pier is the essence of 
Huntington Beach. "Huntington Beach without its pier is like Paris without its 
Eiffel Tower," Erskine says. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the history of the pier is intertwined with the history of Huntington 
Beach. Barbara Milcovich, archivist for the Huntington Beach Historical 
Society, says that the first pier -- a wooden structure about 1,000 feet long 
-- was built in 1904, the same year that a land company changed the name of the 
village of Pacific City to Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
That land firm, the Huntington Beach Co., had big hopes for selling residential 
lots. So the company put up the money for that wooden pier, envisioning it as a 
scenic attraction for potential land purchasers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The wooden pier perished in a 1910 storm, Milcovich said. Undaunted, the 
village leaders launched plans for a new, stronger pier, and voters approved a 
$70,000 bond issue in 1912 to fund the project. 
</P>
<P>
Milcovich said the concrete structure, completed in 1914, originally spanned 
1,320 feet. It was extended 500 feet in 1930, when residents approved another 
bond issue for $190,000. The older portion of the existing pier thus dates back 
76 years, and the newer section is 60 years old. 
</P>
<P>
The 1914 pier had some intricate concrete work, including pilings and graceful 
arches. But time and tides have sapped the strength of those underpinnings, and 
in recent months steel mesh has been placed around the piling to shore up the 
decaying pier. 
</P>
<P>
Winter storms in January, 1988, sealed the fate of the aging structure. Raging 
ocean waters washed away about 250 feet from the end of the pier and carried 
off the pier's aptly named End Cafe. The cafe and the end of the pier had been 
rebuilt just three years before, after 1983 storms had demolished the original 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Milcovich notes that the ocean end of the pier served as a military post during 
World War II. Machine gun emplacements installed there at the time were part of 
California's defense against a possible Japanese attack. 
</P>
<P>
After the war, the pier and the city blossomed. The post-World War II boom in 
Southern California brought thousands of new residents to Huntington Beach. 
Surfing became a national phenomenon in the 1960s, and Huntington Beach's pier 
drew surfers from near and far. 
</P>
<P>
"People all over the world heard the Beach Boys sing about surfing," Mays said. 
"Huntington Beach became known as Surf City. Surfers loved to come to this 
pier." 
</P>
<P>
Dawn Huseman, a Huntington Beach resident, is typical of those grieving the 
passage of the old pier. 
</P>
<P>
"This pier has many memories for me and my family," she said on a visit to the 
structure. "My three sons have all surfed here. I'm here today to say goodby to 
this old pier." 
</P>
<P>
In much the same fashion as Huseman, scores of residents are expected for the 
11:30 a.m. ceremony at Pacific Coast Highway and Main Street to bid farewell to 
the 1914 pier. 
</P>
<P>
"We can take consolation in the fact that a beautiful new pier will soon be 
built," Mays said. 
</P>
<P>
But Milcovich added wistfully: "When this old pier is gone, then the old city 
of Huntington Beach is gone. We're literally losing our tie to the past."

FIREFIGHTERS VOW TO OUST INCUMBENTS

Frustrated that City Council members were unsympathetic to recent labor 
contract grievances, the city Firemen's Assn. has reluctantly agreed to a new 
three-year pact while also vowing to throw out of office two council incumbents 
seeking reelection Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping that if we can get politically active and educate the citizens 
about our situation and get some people onto the City Council that also 
understand where we are coming from, we might be able to make some headway," 
firefighters' spokesman Steen Jensen said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The firefighters union broke a long-standing tradition of impartiality in 
council races when it decided to endorse city Planning Commission members Norm 
Grossman and Wayne Peterson, and attorney Steven C. Leonard for three City 
Council seats, Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbents targeted by the firefighters are Mayor Lida Lenney and 
Councilman Robert F. Gentry. 
</P>
<P>
After working for more than three months without a contract and making no 
progress in negotiations with the city until an independent mediator stepped 
in, Jensen said the group accepted a wage and benefits package that includes 
five pay raises during the next three years totaling 18%. But he claimed that 
even with the new pay hikes, the city's 36 firefighters will still be the 
lowest paid in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We are kind of at the bottom of the barrel now, and when we come out of the 
contract in 1993 we are not even going to be in the barrel," Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
"How do they know that? Nobody knows what the rest of the cities are going to 
do," City Manager Kenneth C. Frank responded. 
</P>
<P>
Frank said the first pay raise, effective immediately, will bring the top 
firefighters up to a salary of $3,043 per month, placing the city fourth from 
the bottom among the 16 fire departments in the county. 
</P>
<P>
He added that Laguna Beach is in the same pay range as La Habra, Orange, San 
Clemente and Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange and San Clemente are due increases in January, but come July, we are 
going to go ahead of them, and we go back and forth," Frank said. GEBE MARTINEZ

The California League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club endorsed 
Assembly candidate Tom Umberg on Wednesday, accusing his opponent, incumbent 
Curt Pringle, of having one of the Legislature's worst voting records on 
environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Curt Pringle is on the bottom rung of legislators," said Doug Linney, 
political director for the 30,000-member, San-Francisco-based league. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody can look at Curt Pringle's voting record and tell he is not for the 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Linney distributed a 1989 list of environmental-related 
legislation that Pringle opposed. Linney said Pringle voted "correctly" 29% of 
the time on legislation backed by environmentalists, contrasted with the 
Assembly's average score of 70%. According to the list, Pringle opposed 
legislation that called for cities to implement plastic recycling plans and 
that required tougher penalties against toxic polluters. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle defended his voting record in an interview Wednesday and shrugged off 
the list of recommended legislation backed by the league and the Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to side with the ultra-liberal groups," Pringle said. "My votes 
reflect environmental sensibility." 
</P>
<P>
Linney and Dan Hayes, a member of the Sierra Club's political committee, said 
the two groups also backed Umberg for his support of Proposition 128, the broad 
environmental initiative known as Big Green. Pringle opposes the proposal. LILY

GOODS SOUGHT FOR GULF CARE PACKAGE

<TEXT>
<P>
While American military men and women linger in Middle East deserts, Joy 
Hallamore doesn't want them to be bored. 
</P>
<P>
So the Laguna Hills resident is organizing a drive to collect new and used 
recreational goods such as games, cards, magazines, books, balls, puzzles and 
audio cassettes, to help relieve the tedium in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"Operation Care Package" will be collecting donated goods from 10 a.m. to 7 
p.m. Saturday in front of the Laguna Hills Target Store at La Paz Road and 
Pacific Park Drive. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to do something," said Hallamore, whose cousin left recently for 
Saudi Arabia. She decided on the collection drive after hearing a radio 
announcement asking residents to send such items. And she figured that people 
were more likely to donate such goods if someone else -- such as her 
organization -- handles the task of shipping the items.

GAIDO WON'T RUN AS WRITE-IN CANDIDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After losing her legal battle to fill an open seat on the City Council, Mary 
Ann Gaido said this week she will not appeal last week's court decision or run 
as a write-in candidate in the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
With less than two weeks before the election, Gaido said there wouldn't be 
enough time for her to mount an effective publicity campaign to win as a 
write-in candidate. Instead, she will spend her time speaking out on city 
issues and preparing for the 1992 council election, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The state Court of Appeal ruled last Thursday that the open City Council seat 
should be filled by special election, overturning a Superior Court's decision 
in August that Gaido had a legal right to the seat. 
</P>
<P>
Gaido, 48, came in third place in the June 5 race for two open council seats. 
As the runner-up in the race, she was entitled to fill the council seat vacated 
when Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan resigned to become mayor. But the law 
also allows residents to petition for an election, which a group did 
immediately after the June election. 
</P>
<P>
After the City Council accepted the petitions and called an election, Gaido 
sued, saying the petitions probably misled some signers into believing an 
election was the only way to fill the seat. The petition, using wording 
required by city law, did not state that the seat automatically would have been 
filled without an election. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court judge agreed with Gaido and ordered her seated. But the 
appeals court said that an election was the least of two evils. Although the 
petition language was misleading, the appeals court said, voters probably also 
didn't know that Gaido, as the runner-up in the election, would have taken the 
seat automatically. 
</P>
<P>
On the Nov. 6 ballot will be five candidates who filed to run in the special 
election. They are Bill Vardoulis, an engineering consultant and former 
councilman; Carol Yocum, a former planning commissioner and community activist; 
Michael Tague, an assistant principal in Irvine; Albert E. Nasser, a 
semi-retired attorney; and Genovica Niculescu-Balteanu, a mechanical engineer. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of that race will fill the seat until its term expires in 1992. TOM

BALLOT MEASURE SEEN AS THREAT TO PIERSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because of the Planning Commission's deadlocked vote this week on Pierside 
Village, a city growth-limit initiative on the Nov. 6 ballot will now be 
perceived as a referendum on the controversial proposal, supporters and 
opponents of the project said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The commissions' 3-3 split late Tuesday on the planned restaurant complex 
postpones the City Council's final consideration of the project until after the 
election because the Planning Commission will not readdress the matter until 
its Nov. 6 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the project fear that passage of one of the two rival measures on 
the city ballot, Measure C, could jeopardize Pierside Village. 
</P>
<P>
Measure C is a proposed City Charter amendment that would prohibit the city 
from selling or leasing any beach or parkland without voter approval. If it 
passes, and the City Council next month approves the Pierside Village plan, the 
project would still probably require approval of city voters before it could be 
built. 
</P>
<P>
Planning Commission Chairwoman Geri Ortega, a longtime Pierside Village 
opponent, said, "Measure C is our hope now" for blocking the project. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Chodos, the project developer, said Tuesday that he had hoped that the 
council would approve his plans before the election, partly because of the 
potential threat Measure C might pose. 
</P>
<P>
Pierside Village calls for the city to lease 3.5 acres of the parking lot 
immediately south of the Municipal Pier to be developed as a complex of 
restaurants, plazas and promenades. 
</P>
<P>
The competing City Council-sponsored Measure D would require a popular vote 
before any sales but would permit leasing of beaches and parkland. Some voters 
may perceive that a vote for Measure D and against Measure C will be a nod of 
support for beachfront development, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"There certainly is a potential for (measures) C and D to pose a figurative 
referendum" on Pierside Village, Councilman John Erskine said Wednesday. 
Erskine, a proponent of the project, joined four other councilmen in placing 
Measure D on the ballot to compete with the citizens' initiative. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mayor Thomas J. Mays, a leading supporter of the project and Measure 
D, said he doubts that passage of Measure C would block Pierside Village. 
</P>
<P>
Mays said Measure C would not be binding on contracts involving park or beach 
land that were in place before Jan. 1, 1989, and the city agreed to a lease 
with the Pierside developer in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
However, because that lease has since been amended, many city officials, as 
well as Chodos, agree that approval of Measure C could throw a roadblock in the 
path of the development. 
</P>
<P>
If both the initiative and Pierside Village are approved, the fate of the 
project would probably have to be determined by the courts, leaders on both 
sides of the issue said. JOHN PENNER

COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN AREA SUGGESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A consultant has recommended that a community college be built in Yorba Linda 
in the next five years, giving a boost to long-awaited plans to add a third 
campus to North County. 
</P>
<P>
MGT, a national higher education consulting firm based in Sacramento, made the 
recommendation to state education officials in response to rapid and unexpected 
growth in the area, especially in east Yorba Linda and Anaheim Hills. The 
consulting firm also recommended that 13 other community colleges be opened at 
other sites in the state, including one in San Clemente that would be part of 
the Saddleback Community College District. 
</P>
<P>
The North Orange County Community College District, which now includes campuses 
in Fullerton and Cypress, bought 190 acres of land off Fairmont Boulevard north 
of Yorba Linda Boulevard in 1964 for a new community college. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s, population increases were less than expected in North 
County, and state education officials recommended that a campus not be 
constructed there until after the year 2000. But 10 years later, the area's 
population boomed beyond projections, and district officials once again saw the 
need to resubmit proposals for the site. 
</P>
<P>
The district's two campuses are now near capacity and there is little room for 
expansion, said Fred L. Head, the district's dean of institutional development. 
</P>
<P>
The college's service area, which includes areas within a half-hour's commute 
of the campus, would cover Yorba Linda and much of Placentia and Anaheim Hills. 
According to Head, population in that area will grow from 133,597 in 1988 to 
207,336 in 2010. 
</P>
<P>
According to the consultant's report, the entire district was projected to grow 
10%, or by 6,578 additional students, in the next 15 years, said Ann Reed, a 
spokeswoman for the state Community Colleges Chancellor's Office. 
</P>
<P>
Public hearings were held on the consultant's report Tuesday and Wednesday, and 
the state Community Colleges Board of Governors will discuss it at a meeting 
Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
The board is expected to vote on the proposed new campuses Jan. 10. After that, 
the matter goes to the California Post-Secondary Education Committee and the 
state Legislature for approval. TED JOHNSON

SCHOOL PUTS ON AIRS FOR HAM RADIO DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People from throughout the United States and Canada reached out over the 
airwaves Wednesday to touch students at Imperial Middle School during the 
school's annual Ham Radio Day. 
</P>
<P>
The event highlighted an unusual school course in amateur radio operation that 
is designed to turn children on to radio operation, as well as to electronics 
and geography. 
</P>
<P>
"We are one of the few schools with a ham radio course," Principal Betty 
Bidwell said. 
</P>
<P>
The school's 750 sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders were allowed to wander 
among the tarp-covered tables where volunteer radio enthusiasts, most of them 
retirees, chatted with ham radio operators in such far-flung places as Canada 
and Texas, as well as with other nearby operators. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very exciting to listen to other people and I think I would like to try 
the class," said eighth-grader Maria Garcia, 14. 
</P>
<P>
Since the program, open to seventh- and eighth-graders, began three years ago, 
27 students have received radio operators licenses from the Federal 
Communications Commission and can now broadcast and receive messages all over 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
"I like that I can talk to people in different states and countries," said 
seventh-grader Larry Miller, 11, who has been in the class since September and 
planned to take the FCC test for his license later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the broadcasting, other special equipment such as hand-held 
radios and a system to link computers by radio were on display Wednesday. But 
even an exhibit on Morse code, lacking the high-tech glamour of other 
equipment, piqued some students' interest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's seems exciting to learn, because I would like to know what all the 
beep-beep means," said sixth-grader Ricardo Reyes. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Barron, a retired chemicals company manager, and Floyd Nicholson, a 
retired radio broadcaster, organized the class and the annual event three years 
ago with the help of fellow hams from the Western Amateur Radio Assn. in 
Cerritos and the Downey Amateur Radio Club. The two men volunteered their time 
to teach the course at Imperial for the first two years before science teacher 
Granville Yoshina earned his FCC license last year. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshina, who now teaches the course, said he hopes Wednesday's event will 
attract more interest in the class, which has 11 students this semester. ROSE

TRAFFIC SNARLED, 1 TREATED IN SULFUR SPILL 
</P>

<P>
A truck-trailer rig carrying bags of sulfur dumped part of its load across 
three lanes of the eastbound Riverside Freeway on Wednesday, prompting a 
shutdown of the eastbound lanes and causing major delays for rush-hour 
commuters. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,200 pounds of powdery sulfur in 50-pound sacks tumbled from the 
truck's rear trailer and spilled onto the freeway, creating an irritating 
pungent cloud and sending one motorist to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred just east of the Santa Ana Freeway at 3:05 p.m., said 
Angel Johnson, a California Highway Patrol spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Eastbound traffic was stopped for more than six hours, causing "major" 
congestion on nearby surface streets as CHP officers rerouted motorists to the 
Santa Ana Freeway, Johnson said. Scores of other motorists were stranded behind 
the spilled load. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Bourcier of Anaheim, who lives about a block and a half from the accident 
scene, said she heard about it on her way home from Long Beach and got off the 
freeway earlier than usual -- but to no avail. The surface streets were 
clogged, too. 
</P>
<P>
"It still took me forever to get home," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters used water hoses to decontaminate two motorists and the 
tractor-trailer's driver, Paul Leroy Miller, 42, of Corvallis, Ore. Their 
vehicles also were hosed down. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who was hauling 150 50-pound bags of sulfur he had just picked up at a 
Buena Park chemical company, drives for Nix Transportation Inc. of Albany, Ore. 
He was cited for the spilled load, Johnson said. She said Miller was headed for 
Northwest Retreaders Co., in Portland, which uses the sulfur in a compound to 
retread tires. 
</P>
<P>
Miller told officers he was traveling about 45 m.p.h. on the connector from the 
Santa Ana to the Riverside Freeway when he noticed one bag falling, followed by 
nearly two dozen others. 
</P>
<P>
As the bags hit the pavement they burst open, sending up a cloud of sulfur that 
obscured the vision of Manoutchehi Ahmadi, 51, of Anaheim, who was following 
Miller's rig. Ahmadi braked after his air conditioning system filled the 
interior of his sedan with fine, yellow sulfur dust, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Ahmadi's car was then struck from behind by a pickup driven by Jeff Potter, 27, 
of Mira Loma, who told CHP officers his tires lost traction as they passed over 
the slick sulfur. 
</P>
<P>
Ahmadi was taken to Martin Luther Hospital in Anaheim for observation after he 
complained of breathing difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
Sulfur in powder form can cause eye and skin irritation and is highly 
flammable. 
</P>
<P>
"It could have caught fire just from the exhaust from (passing) cars because it 
ignites with heat," said Buena Park Fire Capt. Ed Endemano. 
</P>
<P>
The sulfur was swept into barrels and hauled away by a hazardous-materials 
company, which was dispatched by California Department of Transportation 
officials.

KEY FIGURES IN LAGUNA NIGUEL LAND TRANSFER TESTIFY BEFORE GRAND JURY 
</P>

<P>
Two key figures in the criminal investigation of a 1988 Laguna Niguel land 
transfer spent several hours Wednesday voluntarily testifying before the Orange 
County Grand Jury. 
</P>
<P>
Against the advice of their attorney, former Laguna Niguel Community Services 
District manager James S. Mocalis and former district board attorney James S. 
Okazaki carried enlarged copies of development maps and boxes of documents as 
they entered the grand jury witness room in the County Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
In warning that they are potential suspects in the investigation, prosecutors 
invited -- rather than subpoenaed -- both men. According to law, testimony from 
witnesses who appear by subpoena cannot be used against them. 
</P>
<P>
"I would rather not have a client go before the grand jury -- it is a tool for 
the prosecution," said attorney Marshall M. Schulman, who is assisting attorney 
Alan H. Stokke in representing Mocalis and Okazaki. "But they felt so strongly 
about their innocence that they wanted to appear." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anything is going to come of this," Schulman added. "I don't 
know why they are doing this." 
</P>
<P>
Although he looked tired upon emerging from his two-hour appearance before the 
19-member jury panel, Okazaki said, "I think they listened." 
</P>
<P>
After Mocalis spent much of the afternoon making his presentation to the jury 
and answering questions, he expressed optimism: 
</P>
<P>
"I am very comfortable with the way they treated me," Mocalis said. "They have 
allowed me to talk (uninterrupted). I am nervous in there because it is a 
difficult situation in my time alive, to appear to be accused of something like 
this. . . . I think they are listening to me very attentively, and I think they 
will give me a fair (hearing)." 
</P>
<P>
District attorney's investigators began the Laguna Niguel inquiry more than six 
months ago, after county officials expressed surprise that 96 acres of land set 
aside for public use had been deeded to a developer in February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The deed -- signed by then-community services district vice president James F. 
Krembas, witnessed by Mocalis and notarized by Okazaki -- relinquished public 
control over the land and opened the property to development by Taylor Woodrow 
Homes California Ltd. Now the land holds about 100 houses that are part of 
Taylor Woodrow's Marina Hills planned community. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday was the third day of grand jury hearings on the land transfer. Beside 
Morcalis and Okazaki, county parks official Eric Jessen was subpoenaed to 
appear for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
Jessen, a top official in the county Environmental Management Agency, has said 
in earlier interviews that county officials were "horrified" by the land 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
When the grand jury opened hearings last week, investigators subpoenaed Laguna 
Niguel Mayor Patricia C. Bates and City Councilmen Paul M. Christiansen and 
Krembas. Also called was Laguna Niguel City Clerk Juanita Zarilla.

An Orange County man pleaded guilty Wednesday to helping former South Lake 
Tahoe Mayor Terry A. Trupp launder drug money during an elaborate undercover 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
Richard D. Brokhausen, 42, admitted that he carried $250,000 to the Caribbean 
island of Antigua on Trupp's behalf in December, 1988, without filing a 
disclosure report with the U.S. Customs Service. 
</P>
<P>
Brokhausen and Trupp were among those charged in a 20-month undercover 
operation -- code-named Deep Snow -- into cocaine trafficking and money 
laundering in the Lake Tahoe area. 
</P>
<P>
Brokhausen was the last of 13 defendants to either plead guilty or be convicted 
in the case in U.S. District Court in Sacramento.

SUSPECT FACING 12 FELONY CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three Huntington Beach police officers testified Wednesday at a court hearing 
for David Edwin Wilson, 41, a tree-trimmer with a long record of drunk-driving 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was in West Orange County Municipal Court for a preliminary hearing to 
determine whether there was enough evidence of a crime to bind him over for 
trial in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
He is charged with 12 felonies and seven other offenses, including driving 
under the influence four times last summer, driving with a suspended license, 
giving a false name to police in order to escape prosecution, and leaving the 
scene of an accident. 
</P>
<P>
A tangle of police and court records indicate that Wilson has at least a dozen 
arrests for drunk driving and other crimes -- and possibly as many as 19 -- 
under several different aliases dating back to 1978. Wilson has served at least 
two terms in Orange County Jail, records show. 
</P>
<P>
But in this case, Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. James F. Bacin seeks to 
prove only four drunk-driving cases still pending against Wilson, as well as 
six prior offenses since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's hearing, the Huntington Beach officers testified that on May 13 
they spotted Wilson driving erratically, pulled him over and arrested him, 
Bacin said. 
</P>
<P>
Police have said Wilson was often released after arrest despite his long record 
and a revoked license because he gave them names of other people who had valid 
drivers' licenses, including his brothers.

10 YEARS AGO 
</P>
<P>
It was not just another day at the beach for Santa Ana Valley Coach Jim O'Hara. 
A week after quarterback Marvin Jones helped beat Santa Ana, 37-14, O'Hara 
explained why Jones was his quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"We were at the beach two summers ago, and Marvin was throwing a football with 
some friends," O'Hara said. "He could throw the ball 75 yards. Right then, I 
decided to move him to quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
O'Hara seemed to have a knack for identifying quarterbacks. Before the game, 
Santa Ana Coach Tom Meiss tried to disguise the fact that his starter, Scott 
Franklin, would not play; Meiss had another player wear Franklin's jersey 
during warm ups. 
</P>
<P>
O'Hara wasn't fooled. 
</P>
<P>
"We had an idea Friday morning that Scott wasn't going to play," O'Hara said. 
"To be honest, we didn't care who played quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5 YEARS AGO 
</P>
<P>
Rule changes were giving offensive linemen a new way of playing -- a hands-on 
approach -- and there were other, less-noticeable changes outside of the rules: 
Knee braces were being used down the line. 
</P>
<P>
Today, knee braces are common on the football field. But when Oakland Raider 
trainer George Anderson introduced a brace to stabilize Ken Stabler's knee in 
1979, the equipment was used solely for injured players. 
</P>
<P>
By 1985, the braces were being used as preventive medicine. Edison Coach Bill 
Workman made a team rule that all starting offensive lineman had to wear them 
during practices and games. 
</P>
<P>
But several studies and doctors didn't want the brace to be thought of as a 
protective device. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the American College of Sports Medicine came to the conclusion that 
there is no reason why the knee brace should work," Workman said, "but the 
practical application in four years at Edison is that they do work. We haven't 
had a surgical knee operation here in four years." 
</P>
<P>
Said Dr. Robert Cassidy of the Sports Medical Clinic of Orange County: 
"Basically, the jury is still out. There are more players wearing them this 
year, and we've certainly seen no difference in the number of knee injuries 
that we treat at this office." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1 YEAR AGO 
</P>
<P>
Better Late Than Never: Gary Bladow scored on a three-yard run with 1:53 left 
to play and Shawn Porter out-jumped two El Modena defenders for a two-point 
conversion pass from Jason Martian as Villa Park pulled out an 8-7 victory. 
</P>
<P>
It's All Perspective: "We made him look pretty good, I think," Corona del Mar 
Coach Dave Holland said of Tustin quarterback Andy Borza, who completed 11 of 
14 passes for 183 yards and two touchdowns in a 24-7 victory over the Sea 
Kings. 
</P>
<P>
On a Roll: Estancia won its eighth consecutive game and remained unbeaten 
behind the running of Josh Wojtkiewicz, who ran for a season-high 173 yards and 
two touchdowns in 21 carries as Estancia defeated Newport Harbor, 28-10.

NEWPORT HARBOR TACKLES UNBEATEN TUSTIN

<P>
The Newport Harbor High School football team has been lurking in the shadows of 
the Sea View League for the past four seasons. Neither a champion nor a patsy, 
the Sailors have walked the fine line between mediocrity and consistency. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been in the hunt just about every year," Sailor Coach Jeff Brinkley 
said. "There were a couple times we were either going to be in first or fourth 
after the last game of the season. We just haven't gotten that one big 
victory." 
</P>
<P>
The Sailors will have another chance to win the big one at 7:30 tonight when 
they play at Tustin in a crucial league game. The Tillers (7-0, 2-0 in league 
play) are ranked third in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
A victory tonight would keep Newport Harbor (5-2, 1-1) alive in the league 
race. But a loss not only would end those title hopes, but also put a playoff 
berth in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
The Sailors already have lost to Corona del Mar, the two-time defending 
Southern Section Division VI champion. They still have to play Saddleback, with 
which they are tied for third place. 
</P>
<P>
"To be champions, we know we have to beat Tustin," Brinkley said. "That's the 
bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor has not won a league championship since it shared the title with 
Saddleback in 1985, a year before Brinkley took over the program. 
</P>
<P>
The Sailors have reached the quarterfinals of the Division VI playoffs twice in 
the past three seasons. But they have come up short in the league race. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Newport Harbor needed only to beat Corona del Mar in the last 
regular-season game for the championship. The Sea Kings won, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the Sailors needed a victory in their final league game for a 
co-championship. They lost to Corona del Mar, 27-8. 
</P>
<P>
Even last season, the team's best since 1985, wasn't good enough. Newport 
Harbor finished 8-2 during the regular season, but lost twice in league play 
and finished tied for second with Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
"We kind of get overlooked now," Brinkley said. "We don't mind. In fact it's 
become our personality. We sneak in, do our job and get out." 
</P>
<P>
The Sailors have the talent for it. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Steve Walker has completed 70 of 124 passes for 764 yards and seven 
touchdowns. He has three solid receivers in George Greenwalt (26 receptions for 
313 yards), Michael Stripe (17 for 203) and Branon Coluccio (16 for 182). 
</P>
<P>
Running backs Russ Olshefski (575 yards) and Marc Tagliaferri (390) keep 
opponents from keying on the passing game. 
</P>
<P>
Even when the offense stalls, the Sailors have a formidable weapon. Kicker Josh 
Klein has six field goals, 18 in his career. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if someone overlooks us, we can come up and bite them," Brinkley said. 
</P>
<P>
Other games tonight: 
</P>
<P>
Century League: Canyon vs. Villa Park at El Modena High School; Empire League: 
Loara vs. Katella at Glover Stadium; Garden Grove League: Kennedy vs. Santiago 
at Garden Grove High School, Los Amigos vs. Rancho Alamitos at Bolsa Grande 
High School; Orange League: Anaheim vs. Savanna at Western High School; Pacific 
Coast League: Century vs. Laguna Hills at Mission Viejo High School; South 
Coast League: San Clemente at Irvine; Nonleague: Paramount vs. Mater Dei at 
Orange Coast College.

BOXING LIFEGUARD ARMIJO RETURNS TO IRVINE RING AGAINST DURHAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Middleweight John Armijo, a lifeguard from Huntington Beach, will fight for the 
first time after a five-month layoff in tonight's main event of the monthly 
boxing program at the Irvine Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
Armijo defeated Robert Jackson May 24 to improve to 10-0-1 but suffered a cut 
above his eye in training soon after and has been off since. Armijo will fight 
Vinson Durham of Los Angeles in an eight-round bout. Durham is 6-2 and probably 
the best opposition Armijo will have faced. 
</P>
<P>
The first of six scheduled bouts starts at 7:30 p.m. Tickets, priced at $30, 
$25 and $20, go on sale today at 10 a.m. in the hotel ballroom.

CHARITY MUSCLE;

BEEFCAKE GOES ON THE BLOCK FOR A GOOD CAUSE AND PREMIUM PRICE

By day they were loan officers, city planners, law students. But for this one 
night they were screamers, hundreds of women yelling for Orange County firemen 
who peeled off their yellow slickers like strippers and bumped, thrust and 
pranced their way down a runway. 
</P>
<P>
The shouts created a wall of sound that crested at the sight of bare, oiled, 
muscular chests and faded when the bodies were garbed in tuxedoes. Women rushed 
to the raised platform and thrust roses into the hands of the men who strutted 
before them. 
</P>
<P>
Some women took it farther. They held roses in their mouths like flamenco 
dancers and had the prancing hunks pluck them away with their own mouths. Other 
women stuffed dollar bills down the front of the uniform trousers, thrust their 
hands over their heads in uninhibited victory cheers and boogied back to their 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't Chippendales. It was charity. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday night in an Anaheim hotel, 20 firemen competed for 12 spots on next 
year's "Firefox" calendar. Tickets cost $20, calendars featuring last year's 
winning firemen cost $10, and dances with the firemen went for $1. The 
proceeds, $17,000, went to the Orange County Burn Assn., the UCI Burn Center 
and the Burn Survivors organization. 
</P>
<P>
This past Tuesday night, the stakes were higher, the flesh was older, the 
screams were as loud. Again, for charity. 
</P>
<P>
Women who paid anywhere from $25 to $100 per ticket crowded a Newport Beach 
hotel ballroom to bid for bachelors, shelling out thousands of dollars in some 
cases to head off to London, Madrid or Jamaica with the man of their choice. 
The beneficiary was the March of Dimes, which assists children with birth 
defects. 
</P>
<P>
Were the events tacky? Tawdry? Sexual come-ons of a sort that would bring 
screams of outrage if it were men bidding on women? Hey, this is charity. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole purpose (of the "Firefox" event) is to help the burn victims," said 
Msgr. John Sammon, chaplain for county firefighters. He and the chiefs of the 
Anaheim and Fountain Valley fire departments were on hand "to help make sure 
the whole procedure is under control," Sammon said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not Chippendales," where men strip way, way down to entertain women. "If 
it was, then we wouldn't be here and (the firemen) wouldn't be, either," Sammon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And although the disc jockey introducing the contestants did stoop to the 
occasional sexual innuendo, he also asked that the women "please don't touch 
the firemen." The plea went unheeded. 
</P>
<P>
Once upon a time, charities raised money with black-tie dinners and telephone 
and mail solicitations. Then came running, bicycling and walking events. And 
then came the calendars and bachelor auctions, with the auctions becoming 
popular enough to warrant their own episodes on television shows like "L.A. 
Law," "Cheers" and last Monday night's "Designing Women." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Wagschal, an official of the American Cancer Society's Orange County 
branch, said his organization hasn't produced bachelor auctions, but his former 
employer, the American Heart Assn. chapter in Montgomery County, Md., did two 
of them while he was there last year. 
</P>
<P>
"One was a little meat marketish, a little degrading, and the other one was 
classy," Wagschal said. At a classy event, typically held in a hotel ballroom 
with bachelors in formal wear, the man "gets up and talks about his business, 
hobbies, goals, what he reads." At the other, typically held in a bar with the 
men less well-dressed, the men "get up there, talk about a sexual fantasy and 
take their shirts off in a second," Wagschal said. 
</P>
<P>
Wagschal said that at the cheaper event his group ran, they came up short on 
bachelors "so they threw me up on the stage. I got picked by a female postal 
worker, and I went on the date. I know this firsthand; she was expecting a lot 
for her money. . . . I wasn't willing" to do anything but have dinner. 
</P>
<P>
An official of one Orange County charity, who declined to be identified by name 
because she didn't want to offend colleagues in the nonprofit field, said that 
some bachelor auctions "let the women drink and drink and drink so they'll bid 
higher. And they just make fools of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"At one, a woman in the parking lot was crying out loud and couldn't believe 
she made such a spectacle of herself," she said, adding that often "bachelors 
expect to get someone young and beautiful" and are disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Kavadas, owner of a Santa Ana business form company, said he wasn't 
disappointed when he went on the block last year at the March of Dimes event. 
</P>
<P>
He worried that it would be "like a meat-market type of a thing and all these 
screaming women in the audience would like more than just company," Kavadas 
said. "I just thought you'd run into all these crazy drunk women wanting more 
than they should." 
</P>
<P>
The event turned out to be "far superior and classier than I ever imagined it 
would be," he said. He was auctioned off to "one of the neatest of the girls 
who bid," but because of schedule problems they never did go on the date to 
Palm Springs, for which Cheryl Bouview had paid $900. 
</P>
<P>
Kavadas said that so far as he knew all the other men were as happy with the 
event as he, except for one who "was pretty unhappy with the girl who picked 
him because she was pretty drunk and staggering around the party afterward. I 
think that woman had other things in mind." 
</P>
<P>
Last year's March of Dimes event raised $150,000, the organization said. The 
take for Tuesday night's show was $121,500, and produced a record bid, $15,000 
for Mark C. Johnson, who promised the winner that "you will be picked up in my 
Ferrari Testarossa and taken to John Wayne Airport, where we will fly in my jet 
helicopter to LAX." 
</P>
<P>
Then it's on to London on Friday, a performance of "Miss Saigon," followed by a 
$1,000 shopping spree. Sunday brings a Concorde flight to New York and tickets 
to the play "Aspects of Love." Johnson and date will stay at the Helmsley 
Palace, the tower of glitz where Leona Helmsley presides. 
</P>
<P>
A teddy bearish 44-year-old with red hair, beard and mustache, Johnson said he 
was "exhilarated" by the size of the winning bid and "really happy for the 
kids" helped by the March of Dimes. Karen Elliott, owner of interior design and 
public relations firms in Tustin, wrote out the $15,000 check but declined to 
say who provided the money. (Only the difference between the bid and the cost 
of the trip is tax deductible.) 
</P>
<P>
Elliott said the event was "a good cause" and she hadn't met Johnson 
beforehand, though for an hour before the auction the more than two dozen 
tuxedoed bachelors gathered in another ballroom to meet bidders, most of them 
decked out in their finest cocktail dresses. 
</P>
<P>
The written instructions to the bachelors warned: "Do not give out your 
business card! Do not take anyone's business card! Do not drink alcohol! Do be 
pleasant and try to talk to as many women as you can about your package. This 
will increase your bidding!" 
</P>
<P>
The men were also warned they would be disqualified for drinking alcohol or 
"removing an article of clothing on stage." 
</P>
<P>
Robin Huffman did meet the man she bid on at the mingling session beforehand. 
She said Paul Driskell, 47-year-old chief executive officer of a leasing 
corporation and the only bachelor sporting an earring, was "extremely 
personable" and was dubbed "a nice man" by the spotters in the audience helping 
the auctioneer determine who was bidding. 
</P>
<P>
Huffman said she had attended the auction before, but didn't bid then because 
"I thought there were a lot of wealthy women" waving for the auctioneer's 
attention. Then she learned that many women solicit donations. She said she had 
80 checks from friends and clients of her interior design firm to help pay the 
$1,500 bid for a trip to San Francisco and environs. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of the folks inside clearly were moneyed. Outside, at the entrance to the 
hotel, the Mercedes lined up snout to snout looked like a Frankfurt car lot. 
Women bidders received $300 Gucci watches over and above the excursions 
promised by the bachelors. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Johnson, co-chairman of the March of Dimes event, said a major advantage 
that a function such as a bachelor auction has over a formal dinner is the 
lesser cost to the nonprofit group to stage the affair. 
</P>
<P>
With so much competition among charities for donors' dollars in Orange County, 
people who "spend $50, $100, $150 on events want to know they're done nicely," 
Johnson said. They read the labels of the wines that are served. They remember 
the souvenirs the charity provides. 
</P>
<P>
What do they remember about the bachelor auctions, though? Do the organizers 
get questions about the sexual overtones of the evening? 
</P>
<P>
"We get it constantly," Johnson said. "We can't ignore it, because of the fact 
that it's exactly the image or the ambience that's in the air." Johnson said 
the bachelors are warned not to shed any clothing or dance erotically, and to 
"try to keep this above board." 
</P>
<P>
"We know it's there, it has to be there, otherwise some of the jazz isn't in 
the event. . . . (But) if there are any sexual overtones, it's in the mind of 
whomever is looking onto the stage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Ko, publisher of Orange Coast magazine, was one of the judges at Friday's 
"Firefox" event and was co-chairwoman of Tuesday's bachelors' bid. 
</P>
<P>
"We as fund-raisers have to look for creative fund-raising, and we have to go 
for what the public wants," Ko said in explaining why charities sponsor events 
that some people criticize for being tacky. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll always have critics," Ko said. "If we sold pencils, they'd say we were 
taking money from the blind." She did say that after attending her first 
Firefox event, "I was a little shocked at some of what went on" and "a little 
embarrassed" by the firemen stripping. "But apparently the firemen think it's 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Allred, an attorney who has filed numerous lawsuits on behalf of women's 
rights and is an outspoken and prominent feminist, said that she sees nothing 
wrong with bachelor auctions, so long as it's men who are on the block.

"I don't feel it forces (men) into any kind of a subordinated role," Allred 
said. "I don't think it affects their image as a group. I do think it has an 
impact on women and their image and their status if they're portrayed as slaves 
or objects of property, because historically we were considered to be the 
property of men. Men were never considered as a matter of law to be the 
property of women." 
</P>
<P>
"I also know as a practical point of view that it's difficult for charities to 
raise funds and this is a possible way to do it," Allred said. "I also know 
it's difficult for single women to meet men, and I'm loathe to deprive them of 
any chances." 
</P>
<P>
Allred said a friend dragged her to a bachelor auction one time and she won a 
date with a football player, whose name she couldn't remember. "It was kind of 
a joke. We never connected to go out. The point was to make the donation" to 
charity, she said. 
</P>
<P>
As with the auction in Newport Beach on Tuesday night, the one Allred attended 
had a crowd made up largely of "working women, businesswomen," she said, all of 
whom "looked like they were having a wonderful time." 
</P>
<P>
Also having a wonderful time last Friday were the firemen competing to get on 
the calendar. The dressing room had the ambience of a high-school football 
team's locker room, with hootin' and hollerin' and quick shuffle steps by 
contestants trying to remember what the choreographer had taught them during 
the all-day preparations for the event. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, 21-year-old Vicki Lesch of Anaheim Hills said she was at the event "to 
have fun, check it out." Inside, as the parade up and down the runway hit full 
stride, Lesch was one of the women growing more enthusiastic. By the event's 
end, she had stuffed six one-dollar bills into the trousers of her favorite 
firemen. 
</P>
<P>
"It's totally fun, totally awesome," Lesch said. Would it be as much fun if the 
firemen stayed fully clothed? "Oh yeah," she said at first. But egged on by her 
friends, she laughingly admitted, "taking it off is better. Less is better. 
It's about time we have men doing it." 
</P>
<P>
The most jarring event of the evening came after three and a half hours of 
firemen prancing and dancing, when two burn victims were introduced. 
</P>
<P>
One was Vinnie Tanis, dressed in a tuxedo, who was one year old in 1979 when he 
was badly burned in a house fire. The other was Krystin Olson, 22, who in June 
of 1989 was in a car struck by a man fleeing police. The car exploded and she 
spent two months in the hospital, receiving treatment and skin grafts. She 
still faces three to five years of plastic surgery, she said, "but I'm just 
happy to be alive." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd, reminded by the master of ceremonies that helping burn victims was 
"the one reason that we're here tonight," applauded loudly for both survivors. 
</P>
<P>
After that 10-minute interlude, it was back to the firemen, stripped and 
dancing. "Come on guys, I want to hear the ladies scream," the MC urged. 
"Wiggle it, wiggle it." 
</P>
<P>
As the firemen went down the runway yet again, two women shoved dollar bills 
between their breasts, approached the platform and let firemen lean down and 
pluck the bills with their teeth. 
</P>
<P>
All for charity.

ANN CONWAY: 700 TO BREAKFAST WITH BUSH, BREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Wish you were here!" chirp telephone operators at the 
Irvine-Hilton-turned-Hyatt-Regency. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, President George Bush is going to take them up on it. He plans to 
arrive about 9 at the inn owned by GOP big spender, billionaire Donald Bren. 
</P>
<P>
The President, who will spend the night, is coming to Orange County to attend a 
fund-raising breakfast Friday for the California Republican Party. Afterward, 
say insiders, Bush is off to Los Angeles for lunch and then to Hawaii for a 
Pacific Rim mini-summit. (Rumors are flying that Bush will return to Orange 
County on Nov. 3 to help get the vote out for Republican gubernatorial 
candidate Sen. Pete Wilson. The White House will only confirm that he will 
return to California.) 
</P>
<P>
The price tag for the early-bird special? An eye-opening $500 per person. 
Seven-hundred guests are expected to crowd the Hyatt ballroom at 7:30. The 
breakfast, which begins at 8, will feature California fruit plate, orange 
juice, Danish pastries and croissants. (You never see mouthwatering items like 
eggs Benedict at these early-morning political powwows. Trims the profit.) 
</P>
<P>
Parties Plus of Los Angeles is whipping up the decor: red, white and blue 
balloon columns (flanking the dais where Bush is expected to hold court with 
event co-sponsors Bren and George Argyros) and Old Glory-themed centerpieces. 
</P>
<P>
Should you be thinking about spending the night in the same hotel as the 
President, forget it. Eighty-nine rooms are already reserved for the White 
House press alone. 
</P>
<P>
An afternoon with Helmut: Restaurateur Helmut Reiss threw open the carved door 
of his Munich-inspired Laguna Beach manse on Sunday to supporters of the Laguna 
Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Up for sampling: the fine wines and continental kind of fare that has made his 
Rothschild's restaurant in Corona del Mar a favorite of Orange County's smart 
set. (Just last weekend, Reiss catered a very posh sit-down affair for 
developer William Lyon at his Coto de Caza mansion.) 
</P>
<P>
Up for viewing: Reiss' vintage Mercedes-Benz automobile collection. "I thought 
this would be a fun party for the guys," said Dolores Milhous. Milhous -- the 
new president of the museum board -- and Marla Bird were co-chairwomen of the 
bash, the last hurrah in the "Perspectives" party series that poured about 
$40,000 into museum coffers. 
</P>
<P>
Next up for museum buffs: "Novel Ideas," a benefit auction where party-goers 
get to bid on paperback novels that have been incorporated into works of art by 
125 artists, including Laddie John Dill, Sam Francis and Jorg Dubin. The 
artworks will be previewed at the museum the week before the Nov. 17 auction. 
</P>
<P>
Encore: Watch for the Guilds of the Orange County Performing Arts Center to 
stage a video party in the Black Box Theatre of the Center on Nov. 9. Models 
who performed in the Guilds' recent fashion parade at the Center will finally 
get to see the show, which was filmed by professionals. The Guilds have already 
set the date for next year's "The Center of Fashion." Mark your calendar for 
Sept. 20. The gala will kick off the Center's fifth anniversary celebration. 
Carlton Burnett will produce and direct.

HOT, HIP &amp; HAPPENING: RED RIBBONS TALISMANS OF DRUG FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Schools across the country are winding up the fifth annual Red Ribbon Week, a 
national public-awareness campaign to promote drug-free choices and healthy 
lifestyles. This year's theme is "My Choice, Drug-Free." 
</P>
<P>
The Red Ribbon campaign was launched in 1985, after the killing of federal 
agent Enrique Camarena by drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
In the Tustin Unified School District, Foothill High School is handing out drug 
awareness folders, holding a Wear Red Day and encouraging students to tie red 
ribbons to their cars. Tustin High students are attaching bumper stickers and 
red ribbons to their cars. In addition, the district has formed a Drug-Free 
Advisory Council, a 10-member committee composed of professionals who have an 
interest or expertise in combatting substance abuse within the school district. 
</P>
<P>
Check with your local schools and school districts to find out about their 
various planned activities. Red Ribbon Week runs Oct. 21-28. 
</P>
<P>
On the Fullerton High School campus this month, yellow ribbons are tied around 
trees, teacher podiums and wrists. "We're just trying to make a statement 
during this Middle East crisis," said Aarie Loeb, a 16-year-old junior who 
started the project. 
</P>
<P>
"All we're trying to say is that we want the soldiers to come home safely," 
Loeb said. "We aren't advocating the situation or protesting it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Loeb's assistant, 17-year-old senior Theresa Bustamonte: "We've received a 
lot of support from the community. We're received donations of ribbon and our 
administration is behind us all the way. We are also trying to write letters to 
the soldiers and send them books." 
</P>
<P>
Both girls are members of the school's student body council, which sponsors the 
project. 
</P>

OINGO BOINGO'S A BIT MORE SERIOUS, BUT STILL UP FOR HALLOWEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Mike Boehm covers pop music for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At Irvine Meadows, things don't go bump in the night around Halloween. They go 
boing. 
</P>
<P>
For the fifth straight year, Oingo Boingo will be the Halloween season 
entertainment at the amphitheater, playing a three-night stand this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles rock band is eminently qualified to preside over a Halloween 
party. For one thing, leader Danny Elfman has a predilection for writing songs 
about the spooky, the paranormal and the just-plain-dead. 
</P>
<P>
It's a fascination that began in childhood, Elfman said in a recent interview. 
As a boy, he used to plaster his bedroom walls with all manner of horrific 
material from his favorite magazine, Famous Monsters of Filmland. 
</P>
<P>
"Every inch of wall space of my room was covered. It drove my mother crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Oingo Boingo's treatment of the strange and the macabre is very much in keeping 
with the spirit of Halloween. Elfman's songs tend not to brood and glower, but 
to percolate along with humor and a funky dance pulse (the African rhythms that 
bubble through Boingo's music can be traced in part to a year that Elfman spent 
in West Africa when he was 18). 
</P>
<P>
But Elfman and Oingo Boingo also have matured as they've gone along. Their 
early albums, starting with "Only a Lad" in 1980, were manic, frenetically 
paced affairs. More recently, the energy has been harnessed and focused in 
reliably melodic songs. The band's current album, "Dark at the End of the 
Tunnel," begins to examine seriously some of the darker themes that it formerly 
would treat jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
Oingo Boingo has the pleasure of being a hometown hero: With a style that fits 
readily into KROQ's rhythm-happy format, the band has the local popularity to 
play multiple-night stands at big amphitheaters. But it couldn't attempt the 
sort of cross-continental arena tour that is standard for pop's heavyweights. 
The band's appeal has been more localized -- a comforting notion, really, in an 
era of national, even global, standardization of entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
While rock fans in the Northeast may not quite be sure whether Oingo Boingo is 
a band or some new sort of superball (a situation Elfman attributes to lack of 
touring there), the band has strong support in the West, in Florida and in 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we played the single biggest concert of our career in a soccer 
stadium in Rio de Janeiro, with about 30,000 people," Elfman said. "Brazil -- 
who could figure that out? I gave up thinking or caring about the commercial 
side of the industry five or six years ago, right about the time we started to 
get bigger. I've never pretended to have an understanding of it." 
</P>
<P>
One area where Elfman has become a real heavy hitter is film scoring. Since 
being offered the job of scoring "Pee-wee's Big Adventure" in 1984, the rocker 
has had a side career composing music for some of the biggest Hollywood 
blockbusters, including "Beetlejuice," "Batman," "Darkman" and "Dick Tracy." He 
also wrote the score for the upcoming "Edward Scissorhands." 
</P>
<P>
While he sees film composing as a lifelong career that will outlast his 
involvement in Oingo Boingo, Elfman has no desire to combine film music with 
rock 'n' roll by writing pop songs geared toward the movies. 
</P>
<P>
"I avoid songs for movies these days like the plague," he said. "I think 95% of 
the songs in movies hurt the movies and have no point in being there." 
</P>
<P>
The last time Elfman allowed an Oingo Boingo rock song to be used in a film, he 
found the results dismaying. "Flesh 'N Blood," a track from "Dark at the End of 
the Tunnel," first appeared on the "Ghostbusters II" soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
Told that the song would suit a scene in the film perfectly, Elfman approved 
its use. "It was supposed to fit the scene, but it was in the background for no 
reason, coming out of a radio for 10 seconds. I was really (mad). I'd given up 
the song for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
With Elfman devoting much of his time to film scoring, Oingo Boingo has spun 
off a subsidiary in Food for Feet, a dance-rock trio built around Boingo's 
animated rhythm team, drummer Johnny (Vatos) Hernandez and bassist John Avila. 
The group records for Orange County-based Dr. Dream Records. 
</P>
<P>
As for Oingo Boingo's future, Elfman said, "We decided way back that we'd stay 
together just as long as we enjoyed it, and not a minute later. It may be three 
months, or three more years." 
</P>
<P>
Until then, he knows where to find a crowd around Halloween.

 When Peggy Gilbert put her group the Dixie Belles together 15 years ago, she 
says, "I never dreamed that we'd keep it up, because of our ages." 
</P>
<P>
She was 70 at the time. But at age 85, Gilbert is still going strong, and so is 
the rest of her six-piece all-female jazz band. Though the youngest member of 
the group is 69 years old, the Dixie Belles keep a busy schedule, averaging 
between two and three shows a week. Those can range from Palm Springs senior 
dances to the Monterey Jazz Festival to appearances on "The Tonight Show" and 
"Golden Girls." They will perform Saturday at the Yorba Linda Forum Theater. 
</P>
<P>
For all the Dixie Belles -- leader, tenor sax player and singer Gilbert, 
pianist Georgia Shilling, drummer and singer Jerrie Thill, clarinetist Natalie 
Robin, trumpeter Mariam Wells and bassist Pearl Powers -- the active gigging is 
merely a continuation of the life they've known for decades. According to 
Gilbert, most are veterans of name swing bands, including the all-female 
outfits of bandleaders Ina Ray Hutton, Ada Leonard and Gilbert's own L.A.-based 
band of the '30s. 
</P>
<P>
An 85-year-old lady blowing lively, Coleman Hawkins-influenced tenor sax is no 
more unusual than the idea of a woman playing jazz at all was in the late '20s, 
when Gilbert started. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking by phone from her Studio City home, Gilbert said she was set on a 
career playing jazz saxophone by the time she was out of high school in her 
native Sioux City, Iowa. Not that school was any help. Gilbert said girl 
players weren't allowed to play wind instruments in the school bands, being 
relegated instead to the "womanly" violin, piano and harp. 
</P>
<P>
She instead took sax lessons from a local bandleader and played her first 
professional gig in her brother Orville's band in 1926. Not long after, she 
started her own all-female band in Sioux City called the Melody Girls. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, women musicians were not accepted to play with male bands for a 
long time," she said, "and that was the reason in the first place for the 
all-girl orchestras. They had to get together and form their own bands because 
there was nowhere else to play. They were called 'all-girl' bands in those 
days, and that's why I keep using that term. Now they like to be called women 
musicians instead of girls." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert moved to Los Angeles in 1928 and promptly formed another band. Though 
she said she always got along well with male musicians, being accepted by club 
owners was another matter. Asked if the female musicians felt pressure to prove 
themselves to audiences, Gilbert said, "Always. We always had to be not 'as 
good as,' but better than the men to prove that we could play. And we did win 
audiences over. It wasn't until the '40s, though, that women musicians began to 
really be accepted." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the obstacles, Gilbert had a successful time. Her band found regular 
work in the ballrooms -- she recalls one show at L.A.'s Palomar Ballroom 
sharing the bill with Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey and other greats -- and such 
clubs as Ciros and the Club New Yorker, as well as touring nationally. 
</P>
<P>
"We were playing theaters coast to coast all the time. It was a great time in 
the music business," Gilbert said, though she also allowed, "Sometimes it was 
difficult. If you're doing one-nighters and playing ballrooms you have to 
travel during the day and sometimes would get in just in time to go on the 
bandstand." 
</P>
<P>
In 1938 she led the all-woman staff band at radio station KMPC and in 1942 was 
a weekly part of the wartime CBS Victory Belles program. She hasn't stopped 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
"Jazz has never really gone out," Gilbert maintains, "Of course, we don't make 
the money the rock bands do. They're the ones with the limos and we're the ones 
driving station wagons." 
</P>
<P>
Does she feel playing music helps keep one feeling young? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh my, I should say so. Do you ever happen to think what the world would be 
without it? I keep thinking 'How long can I last?' But as long as I can keep 
playing music, I want to. A while ago People magazine asked our trumpet player 
how long she would keep playing, and she said, 'As long as I have my teeth.' "

PAUL ZIMMERMAN CUTS UP WITH QUIPS INSTEAD OF MACHETES 
</P>

Comedian Paul Zimmerman knew it was time for a career change in 1985 when, as a 
juggler-magician, he ran out of new things to juggle. 
</P>
<P>
After all, how do you top a machete, a water balloon and a Twinkie? 
</P>
<P>
But by then the Miami native was already doing more comedy than anything else 
in his act, so he decided to switch to stand-up. 
</P>
<P>
He has since been the opening act for the Pointer Sisters ("One of my big highs 
was the first time I worked with them in Tahoe") and has written jokes for 
other comedians, including Jay Leno ("The writing high was seeing Jay do one of 
the jokes I sold him on the 'Tonight Show' "). 
</P>
<P>
In his own act, Zimmerman talks about relationships, digging into his own 
marriage and divorce for material: 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing about dating after a divorce is that you're gun-shy. Your date 
goes, 'Pick me up about 8 o'clock' and you're going, 'Oh, no. I'm not ready for 
that kind of commitment just yet.' " 
</P>
<P>
The L.A.-based comic, who has appeared on "L.A. Comic Strip Live," "Comedy 
Express" and "Showtime Comedy Club Network," also likes to do topical humor: 
</P>
<P>
"The nice thing I like about the Iraqi thing is the rest of the world is behind 
us for a change. The British are going crazy with this. But if the British 
really want to scare Iraq they should just threaten to go down there and hold a 
soccer game." 
</P>
<P>
Although he enjoys doing political humor, Zimmerman says, "it depends on if the 
crowd is going to let you do it or not." If he gauges that the audience is not 
too receptive to his digging further into the Iraqi situation, for example, 
he'll move on to something else. 
</P>
<P>
As a comedian, he says, "our job is to entertain, not to preach, so you just 
sort of bail out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman, a one-time aerospace engineering major who dropped out of the 
University of Texas in 1977 to go to mime school, writes all of his own 
material. 
</P>
<P>
He carries a notebook with him to jot down ideas that occur to him during the 
day and sets aside time to write every morning. 
</P>
<P>
As he sees it, there are basically two ways to write stand-up comedy. 
</P>
<P>
"You can sit down and wait for inspiration, or you can sit down and go, 'OK, 
married people sharing a bed,' and then think, 'What's funny about this?' -- 
basically brainstorm every word and phrase you can think of and write it on 
paper. Don't think about it, don't edit, just write it. Then go back and look 
at it (and say), here's the thoughts and what's funny about it. Before you know 
it, you've got a ton of jokes." 
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman, who is also writing sitcom scripts and a screenplay ("What comic 
isn't?"), recently started working with other performers who want to make the 
switch to stand-up. 
</P>
<P>
"What I do is write and also help them structure an entire act," he says. 
"There seems to actually be a demand for it." 
</P>
<P>
As for his own switch to stand-up, he says, "It's the greatest thing in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a lot of fun. It's so neat to take something you thought of and take 
it up on stage and make people laugh."

FROM PERSIA: 'MUSIC WHICH MAKES PEOPLE THINK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Chris Pasles covers music and dance for The Times Orange 
County Edition.

<P>
Persian music has been described as introverted and meditative, and Ali Reza 
Shajarian, who is presenting a concert of "Persian Music and Poetry" at the 
Performing Arts Center on Saturday, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"This is music which makes people think," Shajarian said in a phone 
conversation last week from San Jose, prior to a concert at UC Berkeley. "It 
has a great deal of spirituality. . . . You have to really, deeply listen to 
it. But if you let the music take you, it will take you very easily into deep 
thinking." 
</P>
<P>
Shajarian is managing the tour, which enlists his brother Mohamman Reza 
Shajarian as composer and vocalist. 
</P>
<P>
The other musicians -- all from Iran -- include Dariush Pirniakan, who plays 
the tar and setar; Jamshid Andalibi, who plays the nay, and Morteza Ayan, the 
tonbak. 
</P>
<P>
(A tar is a long-necked lute with eight strings; a setar also is a lute, but 
with four strings. A nay is a wooden flute. A tonbak is a goblet-shaped drum.) 
</P>
<P>
The players will be finishing up their 12-city tour in Costa Mesa. The tour 
began in July at UCLA and included Seattle, Chicago, New York, Boston, 
Washington and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the concert is to introduce the culture of Persia to the 
American people, and especially to Iranians, since they've been very long away 
from home," Shajarian said. 
</P>
<P>
But why call it "Persian" rather than Iranian? 
</P>
<P>
"Persian, Iranian -- it's the same thing," he said. "Here, they call it Persia. 
It's Iranian music and poetry." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the official freeze between the two countries, Shajarian said that he 
and his musicians had no trouble entering the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"They give visas very easily," Shajarian said. "People travel back and forth. 
There are no problems." 
</P>
<P>
While Shajarian said that he hopes such concerts as his will promote better 
relations between the United States and Iran, he steadfastly maintained, "I 
don't know anything about the politics." 
</P>
<P>
Classical music of Persia is a survivor. Ever since the Safavid dynasty 
(1501-1722), the attitude of Shiite religious leaders towards music has been 
generally hostile. 
</P>
<P>
They have regarded it as a form of frivolity, as an art form that can lead to 
impiety. Consequently from the 16th Century to the early 20th, Persian music 
was frowned upon. It fell into disgrace and declined. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in this century, however, the Iranian government initiated efforts to 
preserve and promote its musical culture. 
</P>
<P>
Those who don't understand Farsi may run into one problem at the concert, 
however. There will be no translations. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a brochure in English at the other concerts," said Shajarian, "but we 
ran out, and there is no time to print any more. We were not expecting so many 
people! People have been very grateful for this concert. Americans love this 
music so much." 
</P>
<P>
Any protests? 
</P>
<P>
"Not at all," he said.

SOUTHLAND HOME SALES HIT 3-YEAR LOW; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: THE 23.4% PLUNGE FROM AUGUST TO SEPTEMBER IS A REACTION TO THE GULF 
CRISIS. AND SOME BELIEVE THAT THE WORST IS YET TO COME.

Home sales in Southern California plunged 23.4% in September compared to August 
-- to their lowest levels in nearly three years -- in the first hard evidence 
of how badly Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has harmed the region's already-weak 
housing market, according to figures released Wednesday by TRW Real Estate 
Information Services. 
</P>
<P>
Sales plunged the most in San Diego County, down 27% from August, while Los 
Angeles County suffered a 22% tumble from the previous month and Orange County 
fell 24%. 
</P>
<P>
The worldwide economic turmoil caused by the Aug. 2 invasion has driven up 
gasoline prices, mortgage rates and inflation, while sending consumer 
confidence into a tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see a rise in inflation, you usually see a corresponding drop in 
consumer confidence when it comes to big-ticket items," said Mark H. Obrinsky, 
senior economist at the Federal National Mortgage Assn. in Washington. "And 
houses are about as big ticket as you get." 
</P>
<P>
TRW indicated that the worst is yet to come because the invasion's full impact 
is not reflected in the September sales figures. That's because many buyers 
whose homes closed escrow in September had agreed to the purchases before the 
invasion began, said Ed Setzer, general manager of TRW Information Services. 
TRW's data -- including sales of new and existing homes -- is derived from 
actual escrow closures filed with county recorders' offices. 
</P>
<P>
"October will be the first full month to show the negative effects that the 
current world unrest, higher oil prices and increased inflation rate have on 
Southern California home buyers," Setzer said. 
</P>
<P>
John Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Assn. of Realtors, said housing 
sales in September have been harmed more in southern and western states because 
that is where most U.S. troops sent to the Middle East are from. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have as many people looking for houses, and those that are left 
behind are feeling the pinch," Tuccillo said. He estimated that the national 
pace of housing sales in September and October will be 5% to 10% below August 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
The turmoil came at an inopportune time for the Southern California housing 
market, which has been in a tailspin for more than a year following nearly two 
years of explosive growth and inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Even prior to the Aug. 2 invasion, real estate sales were at their lowest 
levels in years, and housing prices were virtually flat. The market is expected 
to remain flat through next year, housing analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
TRW's monthly report tabulated the number of homes, including condominiums, 
sold in September in the counties of Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Riverside 
and San Bernardino. TRW Information Services, based in Anaheim, sells real 
estate information to investors, lenders and title insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
According to TRW, 19,331 homes were sold in Southern California in September, 
the lowest total since early 1988 and 28% lower than in September, 1989. The 
average price of a home in the five-county area was $208,215 in September, off 
1.6% from August and up just 1.5% from September, 1989, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
TRW's numbers reflect the actual number of homes sold, unlike the monthly 
survey from the California Assn. of Realtors due to be released today that 
reflects the pace of sales based on statewide surveys.

CONTINENTAL AIR PARENT RULED OUT CHAPTER 11; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: THE CARRIER SAYS IT HAS 'DECENT ALTERNATIVES.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The parent of Continental Airlines considered -- but rejected -- seeking 
bankruptcy protection from its creditors, a spokesman confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The board of Continental Airlines Holdings, formerly Texas Air, reviewed "its 
options and Chapter 11 was one of them," spokesman Ned Walker said. "It was 
rejected outright by a unanimous vote." 
</P>
<P>
Walker said Continental, based in Houston, would instead explore alternatives 
that would reduce costs and improve its financial condition. He ruled out a 
"major downsizing" but said the airline was holding "discussions with parties 
interested in investing" in Continental. 
</P>
<P>
The investment, he said, could take the form of debt or equity. He declined to 
name potential investors. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of decent alternatives to Chapter 11," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
Continental's consideration of a bankruptcy filing came as it dismissed four 
top officers -- including President Mickey Foret -- in what it described as a 
cost-cutting move. Observers said it appeared the executives were let go 
because they were closely aligned with ex-Chairman Frank Lorenzo. 
</P>
<P>
There were indications during the past two days that something was up at 
Continental. The airline canceled its reservations for the annual Wings Club 
dinner three hours before the industry event took place Tuesday in New York. It 
also canceled a meeting with industry analysts scheduled in Newark, N.J., for 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a group of Continental executives huddled in the North Parlor room 
at New York's Intercontinental Hotel Wednesday. The company had no comment on 
the purpose of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
That Continental would weigh a bankruptcy filing surprised industry analysts. 
Robert Decker, an analyst with the Duff &amp; Phelps investment firm in 
Chicago, said he viewed Continental as a long-term survivor. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not on my endangered species list" with Eastern Airlines, (a Continental 
Holdings subsidiary), Pan American World Airways and Trans World Airlines, 
Decker said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its difficulties, Decker added, Continental had a strong route system, 
with hubs in Newark, Houston and Denver. He said the non-union airline also 
benefited from a low-cost structure. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Daugherty, an analyst with Dean Witter in New York, said it did not strike 
him as unusual for a troubled company to examine the ramifications of a 
bankruptcy filing and that he did not expect Continental to file. 
</P>
<P>
Continental is apparently encountering difficulty because fuel costs are rising 
at a time traffic is slowing generally. The airline company also faces a large 
debt burden and is encumbered with obligations from Eastern, which is in 
bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's cited Continental's financial difficulties Wednesday when 
it downgraded $379 million of Continental Holdings' debt and $918 million of 
Continental Airlines' debt. 
</P>
<P>
The rating agency said the downgrades reflected "a heavy debt maturity 
schedule" with $1 billion due through 1994, as well as the impact of higher 
fuel prices and softening travel demand. 
</P>
<P>
Although it noted that the operating performance of Continental Airlines had 
improved, S&amp;P said Continental's parent assumed payment on $239 million of 
Eastern's preferred stock and will have to pay as much as $600 million to cover 
Eastern's pension funding gap. 
</P>
<P>
Walker said Continental was committed to "full employment and a full schedule" 
and didn't intend to makes cuts in those areas. Industry analysts Wednesday, 
however, expected that Continental would selectively reduce its flight 
schedule.

ACT III REPORTEDLY SEEKING SUITOR FOR PUBLISHING ARM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Act III Communications has contracted with the New York investment bank 
Veronis, Suhler &amp; Associates to find a buyer for Act III Publishing, 
according to industry sources. 
</P>
<P>
Act III Publishing, which owns 10 trade magazines, two newsletters and three 
directories, is losing millions of dollars annually, according to publishing 
industry executives. 
</P>
<P>
The trade magazines are principally in the television and communications field, 
and titles include Channels, Marketing &amp; Media Decisions, and Mix. 
</P>
<P>
The company declined to comment. Veronis Suhler did not return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Magazine industry executives said Act III Communications, which is based in Los 
Angeles, has held talks with a number of people during the past couple of 
months about buying the magazine group or individual titles. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said Act III has held discussions with Boston-based Affiliates 
Publications Inc., which also owns the trade magazines Billboard and the 
Hollywood Reporter, but the parties have been unable to agree upon a price. 
</P>
<P>
Act III Chairman Norman Lear recently decided to concentrate on writing and 
producing TV programs and is said to want to focus on a new series he is 
preparing for CBS titled "Sunday Dinner." 
</P>
<P>
A couple of months ago, he dismissed several Act III corporate executives, 
including the head of the publishing division, and is being advised on how he 
might sell or scale back his investment in the company. Act III's media 
holdings include TV stations, movie theaters and publishing. JOHN LIPPMAN

MEXICAN GLASS MAKER GETS FOREIGN LOAN; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: ONLY ONE U.S. FIRM IS PARTICIPATING IN THE $126-MILLION VITRO DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
MONTERREY, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the largest new commercial bank loan to a Mexican company since the Third 
World debt crisis began eight years ago, 16 international banks and an arm of 
the World Bank agreed Wednesday to lend glass-making giant Vitro $126 million 
for up to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the International Finance Corp., the World Bank unit that extends 
credit to private companies, said it will invest $10 million in the company's 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
The loan and new stock issue are expected to cover most of the approximately 
$150-million cost of a new plant that will double Vitro's production of glass 
for the automotive, construction and furniture industries. Plant construction 
in this northeastern Mexican city is scheduled to take two years. 
</P>
<P>
Vitro is Mexico's largest glass maker, with 1989 revenue of $1.7 billion, and 
owns Anchor Glass, a major U.S. bottle maker. From its Monterrey plant, Vitro 
also supplies about 8% of the glass used in the windshields and windows of 
U.S.-made cars. 
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Martens, Vitro president, said the expansion is needed to keep up with 
growing demand and would not have been possible without the international loan. 
Long-term credit is virtually unavailable in Mexico, and interest rates on 
short-term credit are 35% or more annually after conversion to dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Already among the strongest companies on the Mexican Stock Exchange, the 
corporation is considered a likely candidate to begin trading on U.S. markets 
through American Depository Receipts, the equivalent of shares for foreign 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
The loan was made to Vitro's flat-glass production company, Vitro Flotado, 
which is 35% owned by Pilkington PLC of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
The banks agreed to lend Vitro the money at a favorable interest rate of 2 
percentage points over the London Interbank Rate. 
</P>
<P>
The International Finance Corp., or IFC, which organized the loan, will supply 
$25 million from its own funds. The rest of the borrowed money will come from 
15 European banks and First City Texas-Houston. 
</P>
<P>
In the past eight years, U.S. banks have set up reserves and written off 
billions of dollars in Latin American debt, contributing to large losses. Last 
year, as part of debt renegotiations under an initiative of U.S. Treasury 
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, banks agreed to forgive 35% of the Mexican 
government's debts to them. 
</P>
<P>
Since January, Mexico's government-owned and private companies have sold over 
$1 billion worth of bonds on world markets. But this summer, John S. Reed, the 
chairman of Citicorp -- Mexico's largest bank creditor -- predicted that it 
would be a long time before international commercial banks would be willing to 
lend again to Mexico.

IFC participation in the loan made it more attractive to banks, said an agency 
official. However, he added that the IFC did not offer any guarantees to the 
banks.

Cable Provider Announces Spinoff: Tele-Communications Inc. said it would spin 
off its main programming interests into a separate company to stockholders. The 
Denver-based company, which provides service to one in four U.S. cable 
subscribers, said its board had approved a plan under which stockholders would 
get the right to exchange some of their stock for stock in the new company, 
Liberty Media Corp. The deal is subject to approval by federal and state 
authorities as well as some of the cable giant's equity partners and lenders.

Winnebago Industries Goes to 4-Day Week: With a gasoline rebate offer yet to 
recharge stalled motor-home sales, the Forest City, Iowa, company has cut back 
to a four-day work week and says it will begin laying off white-collar workers. 
Sheila Davis, a Winnebago spokeswoman, said company factories in the Iowa 
communities of Forest City, Hampton and Lorimor have been on Monday-to-Thursday 
schedules since last week. Later this week, an austerity program will be 
announced that will include layoffs among 800 office workers, supervisors and 
executives, she said.

Senate Acts on Czech Tariffs: The Senate approved normalizing trade relations 
with Czechoslovakia for the first time since World War II, reducing tariffs on 
its exports to the United States by up to 90%. On a voice vote with no 
opposition, it approved a trade agreement, signed last April by the Bush 
Administration, granting it "most-favored-nation" trade status. 
</P>
<P>
The House approved the agreement last week. The accord will effectively reduce 
by 90% the tariffs paid on about $82 million in Czech exports to the United 
States last year and open the way for increased business ties between the two 
countries. The effect will be to give Czechoslovakia a much broader U.S. market 
for its exports by cutting their prices to wholesalers, retailers and 
ultimately American consumers by as much as up to 40%.

MGM/UA Accepts Pathe Bid: The board of MGM/UA Communications Co., up for sale 
for two years, accepted Pathe Communication's $1.3-billion buyout offer, paving 
the way for yet another sale of a U.S. studio to a foreign owner. 
</P>
<P>
Pathe, controlled by Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti, is likely to take 
ownership of the venerable studio by Friday. It marks a big victory for 
Parretti, whose ability to secure financing to complete the deal was in doubt 
ever since an initial agreement was announced in March. MGM/UA is controlled by 
financier Kirk Kerkorian.

COMPUTER FILE: THIS KNOW-IT-ALL PROGRAM OFFERS ORDER FROM CHAOS 
</P>

Times.

The trouble with having so many choices among word processing, spreadsheet and 
database programs is that you end up with a wide variety of incompatible 
software. 
</P>
<P>
It's bad enough if you work alone and only have to contend with your own 
collection of text and data files created with different programs. But if you 
work in offices where competing brands of software are in use, the result can 
be chaos. 
</P>
<P>
One solution is yet another program: Outside In, at $99, from Systems 
Compatibility Corp. of Chicago. It runs on PC-compatible computers. 
</P>
<P>
The sole purpose of Outside In is to act as a translator, letting you insert 
text into word processing files directly from 33 different kinds of word 
processing file formats, three Macintosh word processing programs, 12 PC 
spreadsheet programs and eight PC database programs. 
</P>
<P>
Word processing files are complicated. Not only must they store the words in 
the document, they must also store the position of the page margins, tab stops, 
special character attributes such as boldface, underlines and italics, type 
styles and sizes, and often much more. Not surprisingly, most word processing 
publishers do all that differently than their competitors. As a result, their 
files are not compatible with each other. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, spreadsheet and database files are totally different from text 
files, so, unless they were designed by the manufacturer as part of an 
integrated system of programs, such as in Microsoft Works or Ashton-Tate's 
Framework, it is tough to bring such data into a text document. 
</P>
<P>
When it transfers text from one word processing program to another, Outside In 
preserves the tab settings and the character attributes of bold, underline and 
italic type. And for spreadsheet and database files, it transfers the data in a 
tabular structure, as it appears in a typical spreadsheet. 
</P>
<P>
A common need in business reports is the inclusion of numbers stored in a 
spreadsheet file. Without Outside In or integrated software that enables such 
transfers, you would have to plan ahead and prepare special "print files" of 
the portions of the spreadsheets you wished to incorporate in your document. It 
is not hard to do, but you can't do it while you are in the middle of the 
document where you want it to appear. 
</P>
<P>
Outside In makes the task much easier and gives you some options you would not 
otherwise have. 
</P>
<P>
The program is memory-resident, requiring about 70 kilobytes of your computer's 
operating memory. You must load it into memory before beginning to use your 
word processing software. 
</P>
<P>
Once loaded, you call Outside In from within the word processing document when 
you reach the spot where you would like to insert material. Pressing Control 
and I simultaneously does it. 
</P>
<P>
Then, following a menu of choices across the bottom of your screen, you tell 
Outside In which directory to search for the spreadsheet file. It will display 
the file names for you. As you move the cursor highlight down the list of 
names, you will see the top of each file in an adjacent window. 
</P>
<P>
Outside In automatically recognizes what program created the file and displays 
it just as it would look in the program. When the right one appears on the 
screen, tab over to that window and scroll side to side or up and down through 
the file to find the section you want. Then mark it with special keystrokes and 
press Insert to have the marked section copied into your word processing 
document. The original, of course, remains undisturbed. 
</P>
<P>
A particularly nice feature of Outside In is its ability to select 
non-contiguous sections of the spreadsheet for transfer. You could, for 
instance, just copy the labels along the left column of the spreadsheet and the 
summary data from a column farther to the right. You can even mark and copy a 
patchwork of data from every other row and every other column or any variation 
on that theme. 
</P>
<P>
The material you move into your word processing document will take on the 
margins and tab settings of that document, so be careful not to move in 
material too wide to fit. And take care with tab settings if you want numbers 
to line up. 
</P>
<P>
Database material is treated as if stored in a table, like a spreadsheet. If 
you have special entry or report forms for your data, they will not be 
recognized. The non-contiguous selection process works the same as for 
spreadsheets. 
</P>
<P>
Databases recognized are dBASE, Data Ease, dBXL, Enable, FoxBase, Framework, 
Works and SmartWare II. 
</P>
<P>
When you choose text created by other word processing programs, the rules are a 
little different. You must select contiguous text. If you want non-contiguous 
text, you must go back to the source file as many times as necessary to 
retrieve the separate segments. It's easy to keep going back for more, however, 
because Outside In takes you back to the last place you were in the last file 
you copied from each time you call it into use. 
</P>
<P>
The list of word processing programs supported is printed on the back of the 
package.

</P>
<P>
Features: Merge text and data into popular word processing documents from 33 
word processors, 12 spreadsheets and eight databases. Copy non-contiguous

</P>
<P>
Requirements: IBM PC or compatible with at least 70 kilobytes of spare memory 
beyond that required by your word processing software.

DURABLES REPORT SENDS OMINOUS SIGNAL

Factory orders for big-ticket durable goods fell a sharp 1.7% in September, the 
Commerce Department reported Wednesday. Analysts said the report foretells a 
further production and employment slump in the industrial sector, which has 
lost 500,000 jobs since January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Earlier indications of a September economic rebound are shot down by the 
month's durable goods orders," said William MacReynolds, an economist with the 
Chamber of Commerce. "The recent decline (in orders) shows that the slowdown 
will continue, leading to a recession in the current quarter." 
</P>
<P>
The main reason for last month's decline in orders was weaker demand for cars, 
as the 1990 model year ended and manufacturers boosted prices on 1991 cars, 
together with a drop in orders for military goods. 
</P>
<P>
"It was another report indicating the economy is slowing down, probably . . . 
that we're in a recession -- but probably indicating the recession will be 
mild," said Elliott Platt, director of economic research at Donaldson, Lufkin 
&amp; Jenrette, a New York securities dealer. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce said orders for durable goods -- items expected to last more than 
three years -- totaled a seasonally adjusted $124.9 billion last month. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation orders slid 6.8% to $32.8 billion, with declines in motor 
vehicles more than offsetting an increase in aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"The main message is that dealers are not ordering 1991 model cars," said 
economist Cynthia Latta of DRI McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Durable goods orders have fallen three times in the past four months and, 
Commerce said, the August decline was even steeper than previously reported: 
down 0.8% rather than 0.5%. For the year so far, it said, orders were off 0.5% 
compared to the first nine months of, 1989.

TINY SOFTWARE FIRM CRIPPLES GIANT REVLON IN PAY DISPUTE

A small software firm, using a high-tech guerrilla tactic to "repossess" its 
product from Revlon Inc. for non-payment, briefly crippled the cosmetic giant 
with a midnight phone call. 
</P>
<P>
Logisticon Inc., of Santa Clara, Calif., shut down two of Revlon's four 
national distribution centers for three days, according to a lawsuit Revlon 
filed this week in Santa Clara County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have any remedies left as a small company," said Donald Gallagher, 
president of Logisticon, which has annual sales of less than $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
Revlon, the nation's largest manufacturer of mass market cosmetics, with annual 
sales of $3 billion, hired Logisticon last year to develop inventory control 
software for warehouses in Phoenix and Edison, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Revlon contended that the software never worked properly and on Oct. 9 notified 
Logisticon that it wanted to cancel its $1.2-million contract and would 
withhold further payments until the software worked. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, Logisticon took its own action in the middle of the night, using 
a phone link and computer access codes to disable all of its software in Revlon 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
"During this period, Revlon could not process inventory or sales orders and was 
unable to identify and distribute products in the marketplace," Revlon said in 
its lawsuit. "Revlon's daily sales from its Edison and Phoenix distribution 
facilities, which are normally millions of dollars, were brought to a 
standstill."

EXXON PROFIT FLAT; UNOCAL INCOME UP 53% IN PERIOD;

Exxon Corp., the nation's largest oil company, posted flat third-quarter 
earnings Wednesday and said rising crude oil prices from the Persian Gulf 
crisis caused its refining and marketing operations to lose money. 
</P>
<P>
While revenue rose 23% from a year earlier to $29.0 billion, Exxon said net 
income was unchanged at $1.08 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The losses in refining and marketing were offset by increased income from oil 
exploration and production. 
</P>
<P>
"In the two-month period following the beginning of the current crisis in the 
Middle East, refining and marketing in the U.S. operated at a loss because 
marketplace competition prevented full recovery of crude price increases," 
Exxon Chairman Lawrence Rawl said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
Other oil companies in recent days have also said earnings were hurt because 
they were unable to pass through to consumers the entire increase in crude oil 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
While the higher oil prices since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait has 
generally helped oil producers, companies such as Exxon and Mobil with large 
refining and marketing operations have not benefited as much. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Unocal Corp. reported a 53% rise in earnings that it attributed 
largely to the higher prices for crude oil, which helped its production 
business. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based company posted net earnings for the third quarter of $121 
million on revenue that climbed 9% to $3.07 billion.

IS PHILANTHROPY'S CLOCK 'TICKING AWAY'?; 
</P>
<P>
STRATEGY: AS CHARITABLE GROUPS GATHERED IN L.A. TO DISCUSS AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE, 
THE BUZZWORD WAS DIVERSITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In a best-of-times, worst-of-times climate, representatives of more than 400 
grant makers and grant recipients nationwide gathered this week in Los Angeles 
to plot strategies for keeping philanthropy healthy in the face of federal 
budget cutbacks and staggering social problems. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the 10th-anniversary meeting of the Independent Sector were buoyed 
by some good news: A survey conducted for their coalition by the Gallup 
Organization shows that more Americans are contributing more money and time to 
causes and, significantly, those between the ages of 25 and 44, often depicted 
as me-first materialists, are leading the way in giving. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was a pessimistic edge to messages delivered by speakers during 
the four-day session. The buzzword was diversity -- the imperative for 
not-for-profit groups to diversify their boards and their programs to meet the 
needs of a population that is increasingly multiethnic, multiracial, and split 
into haves and have-nots. 
</P>
<P>
As Independent Sector President Brian O'Connell said in an interview, "We are 
doomed to failure when people who don't know the problems first-hand plan for 
'those poor folks.' " 
</P>
<P>
Those problems include escalating poverty, hunger, homelessness and crime. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Wong, president of California Tomorrow, addressing the opening session, 
described a society in which there is an urgent need to rethink social, 
economic and political values and, at the same time, growing fragmentation and 
separation. 
</P>
<P>
In California, she pointed out, the majority of voters are 40 or older, white, 
with incomes of at least $40,000, while 40% of the population are people of 
color, poorer and younger. 
</P>
<P>
Will existing organizations be able to retool themselves to respond to meet the 
needs of the latter? "The clock is ticking away," Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
Raul Yzaguirre, president of the National Council of La Raza, zeroed in on 
predictable consequences of "undereducation" of blacks and Latinos. In 1988, he 
pointed out, three of four whites were high school graduates, but only five of 
eight blacks and one of two Latinos were. But by the year 2,000, he noted, only 
one in seven jobs will not require a diploma. 
</P>
<P>
The United States faces "a major mismatch" between needs and skills in the work 
force, Yzaguirre said. 
</P>
<P>
He called on foundations and corporations to fund public-policy analysis 
leading to educational reform, quality day-care programs and job training, with 
efforts concentrated on "the working poor." 
</P>
<P>
Peter F. Drucker, author and management consultant and a professor at Claremont 
Graduate School, told the nonprofit groups that they must sharpen their 
management skills and run their organizations "better than businesses." Whereas 
good intentions once were thought to be enough, he said, "Somehow, the Good 
Lord likes competence." 
</P>
<P>
He announced the formation of the Peter F. Drucker Foundation for Nonprofit 
Management, headed by Frances Hesselbein, formerly chief executive officer of 
Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. The foundation, funded by private gifts and royalties 
from Drucker's books and book cassettes, will reward an innovative nonprofit 
organization with a $25,000 award each year, starting in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
For the nonprofit sector, Drucker told the conference, the "key to survival" is 
to make donors active partners in decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, he told a news conference, people would be urged: "Join our board. 
You'll never have to do any work." Today, he said, a prospective board member 
demands a clear understanding of the mission and of his or her role in that 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
By an economic yardstick, nonprofits "are a declining industry," still getting 
only 2% of the Gross National Product, a percentage unchanged since 1830. 
Because "the biggest givers are older people," he added, "we face a sharp 
decline. If we don't reverse this . . . we'll be in serious trouble." 
</P>
<P>
The overall disintegration of community has drastically affected traditional 
ways of fund raising, Drucker said. "Even in a small town in Nebraska," he 
observed, today "nobody raises an eyebrow if you don't go to church" -- and put 
something on the plate. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke of the specter of a cut in allowable deductions to charities, one of 
the federal budget deficit-trimming proposals: "This is basically a way to 
enable the rich to be richer . . . now (they) have an excellent reason for not 
giving." 
</P>
<P>
With 750 member groups -- about evenly divided between donors (foundations and 
corporations) and the nonprofit groups they fund -- Independent Sector 
represents a range of interests and causes that is, to say the least, eclectic. 
As one speaker put it, it ranges "all the way from soup kitchens to the Ford 
Foundation." 
</P>
<P>
There are strange bedfellows: the American Lung Assn. and the Philip Morris 
Cos., the Child Welfare League of America and the National Council of Senior 
Citizens, the Sierra Club and the Weyerhaeuser Co. Foundation, the Fresh Air 
Fund and Chevron U.S.A. Inc., the Heublein Foundation and Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving. 
</P>
<P>
With an annual budget of $4.4 million -- most of it from grants, gifts and 
membership dues -- Independent Sector has lobbied to protect tax deductions for 
charitable giving, published resource manuals for nonprofits and, in 1986, 
initiated a "Give Five" campaign, asking everyone to give five hours a week and 
5% of their income to the cause of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
Discussion topics at this annual meeting included the role of funders and 
nonprofits in fighting AIDS, how to combat youth gangs, new directions in 
community care of the chronically mentally ill and civil rights strategies for 
the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
There was a good turnout for a session on "Prime Media; Prime Messages; Prime 
Time: Building the Right Matches." It promised tips on how nonprofits can 
influence the entertainment industry and get their messages into prime time TV. 
</P>
<P>
Panelist Paul Allen, director of communications for the Natural Resources 
Defense Council, part of the L.A.-based Environmental Media Assn. Consortium, 
cited as a positive example an association-initiated "Murphy Brown" episode on 
recycling. 
</P>
<P>
He cautioned cause-oriented groups to remember, however, that there are times 
when their message may get muddled -- "You're going to have to yield to art . . 
. people who need to create conflict and drama and emotion." 
</P>
<P>
And, he added, if the cause is to be given attention, it must be compatible 
with commercial success -- "The environmental bad guys" might just be the 
show's sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
Coalitions are the best approach, said Jerry Michaud, executive director of the 
End Hunger Network in Los Angeles. Among the networks, he said, there is an 
apprehension that "if we say yes to you, we'll have to say yes to everybody 
else." 
</P>
<P>
The End Hunger Network scored a notable success in December, 1989, with "Prime 
Time to End Hunger," a week during which popular series -- including "Cheers" 
and "The Golden Girls" -- on the three major networks focused on such social 
issues as hunger and homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
Michaud described this marriage of cause and prime time as a "phenomenon" of 
the last few years, but added, "the jury's still out" on long-term impact on 
the public. And the fallout has been that celebrities have taken up the causes. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, addressing the question of how effective these celebrities are as 
spokesmen, said the public is now "a little bit inured to that" and the famous 
must have "some meaningful connection to the cause" -- like the late Yul 
Brynner, who died of lung cancer, and the anti-smoking crusade -- and not be 
there solely to promote their own careers. 
</P>
<P>
Marlene Goland of the Center for Population Options noted considerable success 
in its efforts to encourage prime time shows to promote safe sex. "Four years 
ago," she said, "you couldn't say the word contraception on network 
television." Now, even sitcoms are writing safe sex into the scripts. The 
center is pushing for contraceptive advertising on the networks. 
</P>
<P>
But, asked the impact of these shows on teen-age pregnancy, she replied, "Who 
knows?" Teens are skeptical, Goland said -- "Basketball stars tell you not to 
use drugs and then drop dead from cocaine addiction. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, the Independent Sector has been examining ethics for nonprofits. 
Concerns range from "poaching" on one another's territory to commercialism of 
nonprofits through their endorsement of products or services. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary report of the Independent Sector's values and ethics committee, 
presented at the meeting, is in part a response to a public questioning of 
nonprofits, fueled by media coverage of abuses, frauds and questionable 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
The offenders are "a tiny, tiny fraction," said president O'Connell, but any 
violation is "abhorrent" as charitable giving is "a transaction of trust and 
faith." 
</P>
<P>
The report addresses illegal acts, unethical behavior and what it defines as 
"ethical dilemmas." Examples of the latter: Is it acceptable to have a family 
member as paid head of the family foundation? Should grants be given to a 
corporation's potential detractors? Should a nonprofit dealing with a 
controversial cause publish its list of contributors? 
</P>
<P>
Ira S. Hirschfield, director of philanthropy for the Rockefeller Family &amp; 
Associates, who chairs the values and ethics committee, called this "gray 
domain" the major concern. 
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the report, Independent Sector members expressed their own ethical 
concerns: Do donors wield too much power over philanthropies? Are programs that 
"look sexy" funded at the expense of more valuable projects? Are some 
nonprofits guilty of designing programs whose major virtue is that a certain 
funder is sure to go for them? Should trustees of nonprofits be compensated? 
</P>
<P>
The biennial Independent Sector-Gallup survey, based on in-home interviews with 
2,727 Americans 18 and older from late March through late May, is the basis for 
the Independent Sector organization's talk of "a renaissance of philanthropy" 
in America. The study shows: 
</P>
<P>
* More than 98 million Americans -- up 23% from 1987 -- volunteered during 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
* 75% of households are contributing to charitable causes. The average 
contribution is $734, up 20%, after inflation, from 1987. 
</P>
<P>
* 86% of those between 35 and 44 years of age -- the baby boomers -- 
contributed to charities, the largest single group, while 64% of them 
volunteered time. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell observed with satisfaction that the baby-boomers "are finally 
starting to behave like their parents and grandparents did," a fact that gives 
him "great hope." 
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that the less affluent are more generous than the 
wealthy. In 1989, households with incomes under $10,000 gave 5.5% of their 
income to charities, while those with incomes of $50,000-$60,000 gave 1.7%, 
those earning $75,000-$100,000 gave 3.2% and those making more than $100,000 
contributed 2.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, contributions reflected growing concern about social problems, with 
more support going to environmental, health and education causes and to 
youth-oriented groups. The losers included arts groups, which suffered a 17% 
drop in contributions, and international organizations, down 38%. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia A. Hodgkinson, vice president of research for Independent Sector, 
analyzed the findings for the organization. In an interview, she attributed the 
dip in contributions to the arts to tax law changes -- "The Van Goghs are now 
being sold at auction instead of going to museums" -- and the declining support 
of international groups to deepening concerns "about what's going on 
domestically" and the absence of a Page 1 international horror story that 
attracted mass giving during 1989. 
</P>
<P>
As for the generosity of the baby boomers, Hodgkinson speculated that many of 
them now have children and therefore are concerned about issues such as 
education and "about others in the community." 
</P>
<P>
Independent Sector President O'Connell said of the survey, "However good the 
news is on giving and volunteers, it's far inadequate to the hopes and dreams" 
of the people who are served by nonprofits. 
</P>
<P>
For government to trim its programs and transfer some of the load to the 
independent sector while talking about imposing restrictive tax laws is 
"grossly unfair," he added. Any floor on allowable deductions presents a "real 
danger" to philanthropic organizations, O'Connell added. If the floor is 5% 
this time, he said, "next time they need money they'll go to 10%." 
</P>
<P>
(The Senate budget proposal this time called for a 5% floor for those with 
incomes in excess of $100,000 a year. That means the taxpayer would be 
permitted to take only those itemized deductions that exceed the floor.) 
</P>
<P>
Independent Sector recognizes that, while talking diversity, the organization 
itself has a way to go in that area. Women and minorities, especially Latinos, 
are under-represented on boards of many of its member groups. It's pretty much 
"status quo," said O'Connell -- those on boards "think of those they know who 
are likely to be of their same ilk." 
</P>
<P>
It also recognizes that international interests and women's organizations, as 
well as major religions, are under-represented in its membership. Women, noted 
O'Connell, have "been kind of suspicious of anything that smacks of 
Establishment." 
</P>
<P>
Churches get 45% of all charitable contributions. There is a lesson to be 
learned there, O'Connell says: This giving does not reflect some sort of hope 
for salvation but, rather, the fact that "religious institutions are at the 
forefront" in tackling community problems at the neighborhood level. (TV 
evangelism accounts for only a fraction of church giving.) 
</P>
<P>
Independent Sector is talking about the need to target donors more effectively. 
The United Way-type approach, which seeks broad-based employee support through 
corporations, is "not going to work as well as it has in the past," said 
Independent Sector board chairman Eugene C. Dorsey, adding that it is a 
reflection in part of the growing number of small businesses with few 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
"People who have a conviction about that college, that institution, that 
hospice . . . that's the core of fund raising," O'Connell said, "people talking 
to people." 
</P>
<P>
At the 10-year mark, Independent Sector has seen several changes that affect 
its mission. One, said O'Connell, is a decentralization of government, with 
state and local governments more and more making decisions on "who can march, 
who can picket, who can raise money." Another is a growing demand to involve 
itself in international matters, giving how-to advice. 
</P>
<P>
In an address to the annual meeting, Adele Simmons, president of the John D. 
and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, spoke of "a real interest in helping" 
groups in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe. The MacArthur Foundation is, 
for example, setting up a think tank in Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
In Dorsey's view, the volunteer sector was sobered and strengthened by its 
realization, in the wake of the 1980s "revolt against welfarism" and resulting 
budget cutbacks that "government hasn't done a very good job" of delivering 
social services. "That may have been a good thing to happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
More social problems, less federal money and a nonprofit sector that is 
one-tenth the size of the government bureaucracy struggling to fill the gap -- 
this is the outlook for the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not far from chaos," O'Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he believes that, increasingly, Americans are unwilling to tolerate 
poverty, illiteracy, homelessness, hunger. As they get involved in a single 
cause, he observed, "they begin to look at the systemic causes" and want to 
correct those. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey is also cautiously optimistic. The answer, he said, may come from "the 
incentive of business and industry, an economic impetus" to ensure that in the 
decades ahead, there is an educated, drug-free, stable labor force. "The 
highest councils of corporate executives are looking at this problem." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charitable Numbers 
</P>
<P>
The biennial IS-Gallup survey, based on in-home interviews with 2,727 Americans 
18 and older from late March through late May, determined that: 
</P>
<P>
* More than 98 million Americans -- up 23% from 1987 -- volunteered time for 
worthwhile causes during 1989. 
</P>
<P>
* 75% of households are contributing to charitable causes. The average 
contribution is $734, up 20%, after inflation, from 1987. 
</P>
<P>
* 86% of those between 35 and 44 years of age -- the "baby boomers" -- 
contributed to charities, the largest single group, while 64% of them 
volunteered time. 
</P>
<P>
* In 1989, households with incomes under $10,000 gave 5.5% of their income to 
charities, while those with incomes of $50,000 to $60,000 gave 1.7%, those 
earning $75,000 to $100,000 gave 3.2% and those making more than $100,000 
contributed 2.9%.

<P>
Catch a ghost. Greet a ghoul. Hear vampires read their bloody prose. All Hallow 
Even is nigh and the Southland is spooked with events fun and fearsome. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Undead Poet's Society 
</P>
<P>
The room is dark. A white-faced ghoul in deadly black reads poetry by 
candelabra-light. Her guests sip wine, blood red, and listen in silence as 
shadows dance on every wall. 
</P>
<P>
This is the "Undead Poet's Society," sponsored by the Los Angeles Poetry 
Festival and featuring readings "by and about vampires." Poets scheduled to 
read include Monica Brett Serle, Joel Marsden, Marguerite Garner, Chet 
Henseley, and Denise Dumars, "who has published extensively in the vampire 
vein," according to Meg Reed. Reed is producer of the event and a 
self-proclaimed 487-year-old vampire. 
</P>
<P>
"Vampires are very romantic," said Dumars, who writes of alabaster necks, the 
living dead and wolves' night cries. "They are part of a romantic fantasy. To 
describe them, we must think up the strangest things." 
</P>
<P>
The poets will articulate such things in a cobwebbed room in a darkened corner 
of the Fullerton Museum. "All performers will be dressed to kill," promised 
Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton Museum, 301 N. Pomona, Fullerton. Saturday, 8-10 p.m. $5.

Rude Dog Halloween Contest 
</P>
<P>
Rude or polite, terriers, golden retrievers, pit bulls and mixed shepherds will 
be dressed for largess at the "Rude Dog Halloween Contest." More than 100 
canines are expected to vie for top prizes of stuffed animals, T-shirts, mugs, 
visors and pencils. "We're looking for dogs with attitude," said contest 
organizer Joanne Thomson. 
</P>
<P>
"All contestants must be vaccinated and on a leash," said Thomson, who warned 
that masks, sharp objects and spray paint on bodies will not be permitted. A $5 
entry fee for all contestants will be donated to Canine Companions, a nonprofit 
organization that trains dogs to assist disabled individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Dog food, biscuits, shampoo and trick-or-treat bags will be distributed to all 
contestants. A howling-good time is promised.

Grave Line Tours 
</P>
<P>
"Dearly Beloved," begins a sinister voice as an unseen organ intones "The 
Funeral March," "you are about to view the remains of 80 of Hollywood's 
spookiest and kookiest attractions, most of which were dug up exclusively for 
this tour." 
</P>
<P>
So begins Grave Line's two-hour hearse tour of scenes of "death, sins, 
scandals, murders, suicides" that allegedly occurred in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's meticulously researched and very amusing," said Paul Hodges, 31, a London 
investment analyst, hearse-bound for the second time. "You've got to have some 
sense of humor to ride around in one of these, I believe." 
</P>
<P>
Mourners/tour-goers visit the death sites of notables like Janice Joplin, 
Truman Capote, Jean Harlow, William (Fred Mertz) Frawley and Carmen Miranda. A 
morning-suited driver reels off epitaphs, anecdotes and lurid Hollywood trivia 
between stops. 
</P>
<P>
Grave Line Tours is run by Greg Smith, 38, a former mortuary-academy student 
turned entrepreneur. "When I read biographies of the stars," said Smith, "I'd 
always turn to the end to see how they died." 
</P>
<P>
 Tours depart at dead noon from the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Orchid 
Avenue (the East wall of the Chinese Theater). Daily. $30 per person.

Knott's Scary Farm 
</P>
<P>
This fog-shrouded ghost town is home to 500 professionally costumed ghouls and 
goblins. The wind whistles a ghostly chorale as spirits roam the streets, 
leaping out at startled mortals. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning at 7 each night, Knott's Berry Farm is transformed into "Knott's 
Scary Farm," a nether world of werewolves, skeletons, Frankenstein Brides and 
zombies. Included in the frightdom are a ghostly train ride into the Threshold 
of Doom; a Psycho-inspired Uncle Ernie's Madhouse, where sadistic clowns twirl 
butcher knives, and Revenge of the Dead, a maze where preternatural gangsters, 
monsters and pirates terrorize passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
For those nights the farm is in its scary state, parents are asked not to bring 
children under the age of 13. 
</P>
<P>
According to Stuart Zanville, the farm's publicity director, as many as 200,000 
people are expected to attend the 10-day event. "We believe this to be the 
largest Halloween party in the world," said Zanville. 
</P>
<P>
 Knott's Berry Farm, 8039 Beach Blvd., Buena Park. Today, Sunday, Tuesday and 
Halloween: 7 p.m.-1 a.m.; Friday: 7 p.m.-2 a.m. $22 advance purchase; $25 (day 
of event). Information: (714) 740-2000, (805) 583-8700 or (619) 278-TIXS. Not 
recommended for children under 13.

Queen Mary "Room With a Boo" 
</P>
<P>
Is the Queen Mary haunted? Do ghosts really appear in her staterooms and boiler 
rooms? Starting Friday and continuing through Halloween night, private 
90-minute tours will take Queen Mary hotel guests into the most secluded areas 
of the ship -- where ghostly sightings allegedly have taken place. 
</P>
<P>
Tour-goers are handed flashlights, then led by a guide in captain's garb 
through darkened corridors and deserted operations rooms. Lights are lowered; 
ghost stories are retold. 
</P>
<P>
Featured on the tour is a former 1940s children's playroom, where ghostly 
crying can still be heard; a poolroom, where two women specters have appeared 
to ship employees, and the engine room, where an 18-year-old crewman lost his 
life . . . and purportedly reappeared in uniform 20 years later. 
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of the tour, guests enjoy a Halloween dessert reception in 
the Capstan and a good night's sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Queen Mary, southernmost point of 710 Freeway, Pier J, Long Beach. Friday

American Commerce National Bank "Pumpkin Poll" 
</P>
<P>
This could be the scariest event of all. 
</P>
<P>
At least 40 "Dianne Feinstein" and "Pete Wilson" pumpkins will be carved by the 
Anaheim bank's employees during its "Second Pumpkin Poll." Employees are asked 
to represent their choice for governor in carvings "silly to sublime." Pumpkin 
votes will be tallied and a projected winner announced on Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
"Keep in mind we are in Orange County and that gives us a kind of tilt," said 
bank Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gerald Garner. "But we expect to come 
pretty close percentage-wise." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, bank employees carved Michael Dukakis and George Bush pumpkins to 
represent their choices for President. An air-brushed green pumpkin of George 
Bush received highest honors. "The outside layer of skin was removed. It looked 
very realistic," recalled Garner. "And we came very close statistically (to the 
election results)." 
</P>
<P>
 American Commerce National Bank lobby, 3800 E. La Palma Blvd., Anaheim. Oct.

TUNING IN TO TODAY'S PETER FALK; 
</P>
<P>
FILM: THE MAN BEHIND 'COLUMBO' HAS A LIST OF MOVIE CREDITS THAT SHOW HIS 
AMBIVALENCE ABOUT COMMERCIAL SUCCESS. THE LATEST EXAMPLE: HE STARS IN THE 
QUIRKY NEW 'TUNE IN TOMORROW.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Mainstream world-famous TV Middle America," Peter Falk says slowly, arranging 
the words as if on a banner in his mind that might describe an actor identified 
with one of the most popular characters ever seen on television. "But he's an 
actor who has this kind of schizophrenic existence. A little bit like Charlie 
Chaplin. He's a millionaire by day and a drunk by night. He gets involved with 
things that. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The head shakes slightly, the sentence breaks off, and a brief silence fills 
the converted Beverly Hills garage. Falk drops a smoldering cigarette butt to 
the floor and steps on it while his visitor is left to fill in the blank -- 
most likely with memories of some of Falk's many feature films or at least with 
some of their titles. For, in fact, Peter Falk is talking about himself. 
</P>
<P>
"This disease of mine, it goes way back, back to when I first came to 
Hollywood," he says, referring to one of his early movies, 1963's "The 
Balcony," based on the absurdist play by Jean Genet. Around Falk are tables and 
easels bearing the charcoal figure drawings he does when he is not in front of 
a camera. "I did that with Shelley Winters and Lee Grant and the fellow from 
the spaceship (Leonard Nimoy). It was directed by Joe Strick. We all worked for 
nothin'." 
</P>
<P>
And where audiences were concerned, it came to nothin', which bode a pattern 
for his film career. Never mind the Oscar nominations Falk had received for his 
first two film roles -- in "Murder, Inc." (1960) and "Pocketful of Miracles" 
(1961) -- what followed were such offbeat, commercially lackluster films as 
"Robin and the Seven Hoods" (1964), "Penelope" (1966), "Luv" (1967), "Machine 
Gun McCain" (1970), "Husbands" (1970), "Mikey and Nicky" (1976) and, more 
recently, "Big Trouble," "Wings of Desire," "Happy New Year," "Vibes," "Cookie" 
and "In the Spirit." 
</P>
<P>
Falk runs a title check through his mind and observes, "These are not 
traditional, mainstream, big-budget action pictures. I don't know how you would 
characterize them. I guess you would say they're unusual." 
</P>
<P>
The newest addition to Falk's "unusual" filmography is "Tune in Tomorrow . . . 
" (which opens Friday), a radically altered adaptation of Mario Vargas Llosa's 
modern Peruvian novel "Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter," which has been reset 
in 1950 New Orleans and directed by the Englishman Jon Amiel from a script by 
the Scot William Boyd. 
</P>
<P>
In this transcultural comedy, Falk plays an eccentric Irish-Mexican writer of 
radio dramas, Pedro Carmichael, who is newly relocated to the Deep South, where 
he is packing his newest plot with details of a May-December romance between a 
20-year-old protege (Keanu Reeves) and the young writer's 35ish aunt (Barbara 
Hershey). 
</P>
<P>
"Tune in Tomorrow . . . " is a seriously odd movie that merges the real events 
going on in Pedro's New Orleans with lifelike dramatizations of Pedro's soap 
operas. It does offer Falk a chance to dress up like a rabbi, a surgeon and a 
French maid ("a very specific French maid"), since Pedro is a writer who needs 
to put on costumes to fully understand his characters. But is it going to 
change his luck on the big screen? 
</P>
<P>
"This guy was like the spiritual godfather of 'Dallas' and 'Dynasty,' " Falk 
says, explaining why he said yes to the role after once rejecting it. "David 
Lynch, 'Twin Peaks,' they owe a debt to Pedro Carmichael, who as early as 1950, 
before television, knew that people had a desire to know about other people's 
hidden sexual preferences." 
</P>
<P>
In Llosa's 1982 book, however, Pedro was less of a con man than he has become 
in the screen version, which has Falk playing him as a wacky sage who 
deliberately fuels the fire between Aunt Julia and the young scriptwriter for 
his own purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the Irish, the Blarney, the manipulator, that mischievous sense of 
humor, that flamboyant artistic thing," Falk says, citing the things he liked 
about Pedro Carmichael. When producer John Fiedler first sent him the script, 
he turned it down because "I knew that part was a terrific part, but I had a 
problem: I didn't know how to play it." 
</P>
<P>
When Fiedler, who had been working at Columbia, re-submitted the script to Falk 
a year later, Amiel was attached as the director and the project was looking 
for a studio (eventually landing at Cinecom). Amiel asked Falk to think about 
the character's name. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he's half Mexican and half Irish. When I heard he was Irish, that rang 
a bell. There were certain lines that I didn't know how to say, that if you 
said them with a trace of Irish or an Irish feeling, they worked. Then I said 
yes." 
</P>
<P>
Falk, born in New York in 1927, began acting off-Broadway in the 1950s. It was 
after the Oscar nominations and "The Balcony" and assorted other Hollywood 
ventures that he first put on the moldy raincoat and quizzical smiles of Lt. 
Columbo in a 1967 made-for-TV movie. In 1971, "Columbo" became a series, and in 
the years since -- including a 10-year layoff between 1978 and 1988 -- the show 
has brought him four Emmies and defined him to the world. He insists that he 
still enjoys it -- "In terms of playing the character, I still get a kick out 
of it. I love it when it works" -- but it has not contained his ambition. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the first year of 'Columbo,' 'Columbo' was Jesus Christ, No. 1, you 
know," he says in his raspy Long Island syntax, thrusting his arms skyward as 
if signaling a touchdown. "So during the day it was Charlie Chaplin, and at 
night I was with (John) Cassavetes and (Ben) Gazzara trying to get the money to 
make this picture 'Husbands.' And the second year of 'Columbo,' soon as I get a 
hiatus, I went and made 'Woman Under the Influence,' with Cassavetes and Gena 
Rowlands. The third year of 'Columbo,' the drunk came out and we made 'Mikey 
and Nicky' with Elaine May." 
</P>
<P>
Falk's kinship with Cassavetes, the late maverick director who relied heavily 
on improvisation and defied Hollywood conventions, is a clue that his instincts 
have never led him to play it safe. In 1963, he became the first American movie 
actor to work in the Soviet Union, traveling there against the advice of 
friends in Hollywood to make "Italiano Bravo Gente" because, he says, "I wanted 
to see Russia!" 
</P>
<P>
Falk acknowledges a debt to Cassavetes, whom he believes set "standards of 
immediacy" for acting and actors in his films. "He was concerned with emotional 
complexities and ambiguities that you don't find in movies." 
</P>
<P>
It was from seeing him in Cassavetes' pictures, as much as 'Columbo,' that 
German director Wim Wenders decided to cast Falk as an ex-angel in "Wings of 
Desire," his mostly black-and-white symphony on the unexamined joys of 
mortality. 
</P>
<P>
Falk never expected "Wings" to even reach the United States. "I was amazed it 
ever showed up here." It did not scratch the surface of Columbo's audience, but 
it was an art-house hit and easily the most critically respected movie Falk has 
had a sizable role in since 1974's "Woman Under the Influence." 
</P>
<P>
As for his other recent films, Falk has been, well, unlucky. They seem to be 
pictures that get held up in release, suffer from lack of promotion, are not 
widely seen or not very good. Among them, Elaine May's "In the Spirit," Susan 
Seidelman's "Cookie," John Avildsen's "Happy New Year." 
</P>
<P>
Have such misadventures been the result of deliberately sticking to "unusual" 
films, or are these the only movie offers that Falk gets? 
</P>
<P>
"I've said no," Falk says, lighting another in a long chain of smokes. "I also 
would have said yes if they had asked me for certain things. So we're talking 
about both. There are certain very popular pictures that I would die to be in, 
yet there were other very popular pictures that I didn't want to be in. And I 
don't want to get specific about naming them. But both things apply." 
</P>
<P>
Falk is looking ahead to another unusual project, "My Dog Stupid," based on the 
John Fante book and to be directed by France's Claude Berri. He will play the 
part of Fante, a late, neglected Hollywood novelist now being rediscovered. 
"It's about the relationship between John Fante and his kids during the '60s," 
Falk says, adding, somewhat superfluously, "It's not the same thing as 
'Columbo.' " 
</P>
<P>
On a table across the room, mostly covered with stacks of books on Degas, 
Matisse and other artists, two of Falk's Emmies can be seen. But only the lower 
halves of their golden torsos are visible, because they are currently serving 
as hat racks. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife found a use for them," Falk says.

<P>
FESTIVAL: WOMEN IN FILM MOUNTS ITS ANNUAL PROGRAM OF SCREENINGS AND SEMINARS AT 
THE DIRECTORS GUILD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A trio of French films, including the latest in director Diane Kurys' 
autobiographical series that began with "Peppermint Soda," highlight the sixth 
annual Women in Film Festival, which gets under way tonight with a premiere of 
Kurys' "C'est la Vie" at the Directors Guild of America in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The festival, which runs through Sunday, will also feature the American 
premieres of Bertrand Tavernier's "Daddy Nostalgia," a relationship drama 
written by Tavernier's ex-wife, Colo Tavernier O'Hagan, and first-time director 
Charlotte Brandstrom's "Stormy Summer." 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Los Angeles chapter of Women in Film, the festival offers 53 
programs in film and television that are written, produced or directed by 
women. Included are 16 feature films -- nine in official competition -- and 13 
documentaries. 
</P>
<P>
Also on view will be short films, music videos and animated shorts. Television 
will be represented by children's programs, TV movies, miniseries, specials, 
episodic comedies and dramas, documentaries and news shows. Last year's 
festival drew an audience of 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Tributes will be held for veteran casting director Ruth Burch, "Sesame Street" 
creator Joan Ganz Cooney, and comedian-actress Whoopi Goldberg, whose new film, 
"The Long Walk Home," will be shown. Special programs have been organized, 
including one that examines the lesbian experience in film. Master classes will 
be offered for professionals in producing and directing, and there will be 
seminars in independent producing, writing, selling docudramas, creating family 
shows and filmmaking in general. 
</P>
<P>
Among pre-screened films, Kurys' "C'est la Vie" stands out. The film, which 
concludes her poignant series that began with "Peppermint Soda" (1977) and 
continued with "Entre Nous" (1983), is a bittersweet recollection of a summer 
of adolescence. Set in 1958, it is the story of two sisters (Julie Bataille, 
Candice LeFranc) whose family vacation on the Brittany coast is disrupted by 
the decision of their mother (Nathalie Baye) to leave their father (Richard 
Berry). 
</P>
<P>
The intimacy of this film is echoed in "Daddy Nostalgia," which is based on 
events in writer Colo Tavernier O'Hagan's life. The film marks the return to 
the big screen, after an 8-year absence, of Dirk Bogarde, who is superb as a 
British businessman confronted with his own mortality in the wake of heart 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Married to a Frenchwoman (Odette Laure) and living in retirement in the South 
of France, he is visited by his screenwriter daughter (Jane Birkin), who is 
intent on getting to know the father who had little time for her while she was 
growing up. Bogarde is as gallant as Birkin is patient and tender, and this 
elegiac film is suffused with a father and daughter's belated discovery and 
appreciation of each other. 
</P>
<P>
"Stormy Summer" is a remarkably assured first film from L.A.-based Charlotte 
Brandstrom. Adapted by Brandstrom and Nicolas Bernheim from a novel by 
Pierre-Jean Remy, it is the story of a painful first love set during the 
occupation of France. The gradual interaction between its love triangle and the 
larger, increasingly dangerous circumstances of war is exceptionally complex, 
disturbing and illuminating. 
</P>
<P>
Stanislas Carre de Malberg stars as a teen-ager who falls hard for his 
beautiful, teasing cousin (Judith Godreche), who in turn is dazzled by a 
British airman (Murray Head) taking refuge in her family's provincial estate. 
</P>
<P>
Other festival features especially recommended: 
</P>
<P>
"One Thousand Pieces of Gold" (directed by Nancy Kelly and adapted by Anne 
Makepeace from Ruthanne Lum McCunn's novel), is the story of a young Chinese 
woman (Rosalind Chao) sold by her desperate peasant father during a terrible 
drought. She ends up the "property" of a fellow countryman in a 
rough-and-tumble Oregon gold-mining village, circa 1880. The film is short on 
style and pace but strong in conviction and performances. 
</P>
<P>
"The Long Walk Home" is a first-rate social-conscience drama, directed in 
straightforward TV-movie style by Richard Pearce, written by John Cork and 
acted with admirable understatement by Whoopi Goldberg and Sissy Spacek. Spacek 
is a well-off Montgomery, Ala., housewife and mother whose consciousness is 
gradually raised during the long and tense bus boycott by blacks, sparked by 
Rosa Parks' epic refusal. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg plays Spacek's housekeeper, a figure of dignity and self-control who 
must walk a great distance to and from work. She says little but her sheer 
presence and carefully chosen words at last have their impact upon her 
employer. Both stars are at their very best in "The Long Walk Home," based on a 
true story and notable for its revelation of how social and economic pressures 
threaten to stifle an individual's best instincts.

NAACP'S IMAGE AWARDS LACK BEST ACTRESS FOR FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the fourth time in the 23-year history of its Image Awards, the National 
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People said Wednesday that it was unable 
to field a category of best actress in a motion picture because there were too 
few candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"This appalling situation again highlights the imbalance and irresponsibility 
of the film industry," said Sandra Evers-Manly, president of the organization's 
Beverly Hills/Hollywood branch. The chapter presents the Image Awards, which 
honor positive portrayals of blacks in movies, television and music. "The 
industry has yet to show diversity or present realistic leading roles for 
African-American women," she said. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference to announce this year's Image nominees, Evers-Manly said 
that the NAACP has been meeting with the six major Hollywood studios this year, 
and believes that changes will be made to improve opportunities for minority 
actresses. 
</P>
<P>
The NAACP did come up with nominees for best supporting actress in a movie: 
Joie Lee and Cynda Williams for "Mo' Better Blues," Tisha Campbell for "House 
Party," Kimberly Russell for "Ghost Dad" and Whoopi Goldberg for "Ghost." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to that nomination, Goldberg was named to receive a special award 
as entertainer of the year. Dionne Warwick was selected for special recognition 
as a "crusader in the fight for human rights," and Katherine Dunham, James Earl 
Jones and the late Sarah Vaughan were chosen for the Hall of Fame Awards. 
</P>
<P>
They and other Image Award winners will be honored at a ceremony Dec. 1 at the 
Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles. The event will be broadcast on NBC Jan. 26. 
</P>
<P>
The women nominated as best actress in a TV drama were Anne Marie Johnson ("In 
the Heat of the Night"), C.C.H. Pounder ("Common Ground"), Holly Robinson ("21 
Jump Street"), Madge Sinclair ("Midnight Caller") and Alfre Woodard ("A 
Mother's Courage: The Mary Thomas Story"). 
</P>
<P>
On the TV comedy side, best actress nominees were Jasmine Guy and Cree Summer 
("A Different World"), Rosetta LeNoire and Jo Marie Payton-France ("Family 
Matters") and Marsha Warfield ("Night Court"). 
</P>
<P>
Nominated for best performance by an actor in a movie were Morgan Freeman for 
"Driving Miss Daisy," Richard Pryor for "Harlem Nights," Christopher Reid for 
"House Party" and Denzel Washington for "Mo' Better Blues."

NBC PULLS PLUG ON 'HULL HIGH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Hull High," one of the two new musical series on network television this fall, 
has been canceled, NBC confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Disney-produced show became the second series to be canned this season. 
</P>
<P>
CBS had previously canceled the drama "E.A.R.T.H. Force" while also placing the 
comedy "Lenny" on hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
"Hull High," which had primarily employed non-singing actors who lip-synced the 
musical numbers, ranked 86th among the 98 prime-time series that have been on 
the four networks this season. The show had been cursed with the 7 p.m. Sunday 
time slot against CBS' perennial ratings champ, "60 Minutes." 
</P>
<P>
A permanent replacement was not immediately named. This Sunday, NBC will move 
the medical series "Lifestories" to 7 p.m. and air "Sunday Night With Larry 
King," a celebrity special, at 8 p.m. On Nov. 4, the network will broadcast 
"The Story Behind the Story" at 7 p.m. and move "Lifestories" back to its 
regular 8 p.m. slot. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the other musical series, ABC's "Cop Rock," continues to flounder in 
the ratings as well. Airing Wednesdays at 10 p.m., the singing cop show is the 
74th-rated series so far this year, averaging only a 14% share of the audience 
on one of ABC's best-rated nights. STEVE WEINSTEIN

</P>
<P>
TRIVIA QUESTION: WHICH WESTERN INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRY HAS THE LOWEST RATE OF 
HEART DISEASE? CAN IT BE FRANCE, WHERE EGGS, CREAM, CHEESE AND BUTTER SEEM TO 
APPEAR ON EVERY PLATE? HOW CAN THIS BE? REPORTER EDWARD DOLNICK CROSSED THE 
ATLANTIC TO FIND OUT.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
La Coupole restaurant is jammed and, what with the noise and the difficulty of 
troweling just the right amount of pate onto my grilled bread, I'm having a 
hard time making out what Dr. Jacques Richard is saying. Richard, the reigning 
authority on heart disease rates in France, has his own problems. He can't seem 
to decide whether he wants yet another bite of lardons, the fatty bacon chunks 
that adorn his salad, or whether he should move on to the gooey, golden yolk of 
his poached egg. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to appearances, this is work. I've crossed the ocean to untangle a 
mystery, and if anyone can help, it's Richard. The question is best put as a 
riddle: Of the Western world's industrialized countries, which has the lowest 
rate of death from heart disease? 
</P>
<P>
Oui. C'est la France. The United States isn't even close. In France each year, 
143 of every 100,000 middle-aged men die of heart disease, according to the 
World Health Organization. In the United States, that figure is more than twice 
as high: 315. French women do even better, with the world's lowest rate of 
death from heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
If you look at all industrialized countries, only Japan beats France. Japan's 
good health is no surprise, since the Japanese diet is light on fat and heavy 
on rice and fish. But despite their bad habits the French seem to be thriving. 
</P>
<P>
How could it be, I'd come to ask Richard, that while Americans are dutifully 
downing bran muffins and the French are happily polishing off every butter 
flake of their croissants, they have healthier hearts than we do? This is, 
after all, the country that conceived bearnaise sauce -- three egg yolks and 
half a pound of butter -- and then thought to pour it over filet mignon. 
</P>
<P>
Richard, an epidemiologist, has spent 25 years compiling and verifying the 
figures. Their message is clear: The French should be having heart attacks 
everywhere you look. They're not. And French women actually outlive American 
women by a year. 
</P>
<P>
Richard, a researcher at INSERM, the French equivalent of our National 
Institutes of Health, is tall and thin, friendly, in a shy way, and 
extravagantly polite. He speaks quietly, almost apologizing as he replies to my 
nasty-minded question. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the French diagnose heart disease in some funny way that pretties up 
their statistics? No, he says, skeptics have checked and rechecked French death 
certificates, reworking the figures to include all the fuzzy diagnoses that 
just might have been heart disease deaths, and the same picture always emerges. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe some regions of France have high rates of heart disease but ride the 
coattails of regions that are especially healthy? I'm wondering about Normandy, 
famous for its butter and cream, and Richard grants me an indulgent smile. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, Normandy is doing poorly relative to France, but it's doing well" -- he 
pauses a moment trying vainly to come up with a delicate way to frame the 
comparison -- "but it's doing well relative to you." 
</P>
<P>
Another prominent French epidemiologist, Serge Renaud, had cackled cheerfully 
when I'd asked him about heart disease in different parts of France. "Do you 
know who has the lowest rate of death from heart disease in all of France?" he 
had asked me. "The least heart disease is in southwest France. That's the place 
where they have duck fat instead of butter, where they eat foie gras." 
</P>
<P>
As I sit at dinner, sipping my vintage Sauternes, Richard gestures toward the 
pinkish slab of pate on my plate. "That's fat," he warns. "Not so good for 
you." Then, with a conspiratorial grin as he indicates my wine glass. "You'd 
better drink your wine for protection." 
</P>
<P>
Richard may be joking, but it's not entirely a joke. One study after another 
has found that moderate wine drinkers -- those who drink about two glasses per 
day -- have far less heart disease than either teetotalers or heavy drinkers. 
Eight studies in the 1970s and 1980s, in the United States and abroad, reported 
that moderate drinkers had between 30% and 40% less heart disease than control 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Still another study looked at 18 countries and found "a strong and specific 
negative association between heart disease deaths and wine consumption." A 
chart spelled out the message: Finland, the United States and Scotland were in 
a group that drank the least wine and had the most deaths from heart disease: 
Belgium, West Germany and Austria drank more wine and had fewer deaths; 
Switzerland, Italy and France drank the most wine and had the fewest deaths. 
</P>
<P>
If wine should prove to have some ingredient that protects against heart 
disease, the authors concluded, "we consider it almost a sacrilege that this 
constituent should be isolated . . . the medicine is already in a highly 
palatable form." 
</P>
<P>
"Ah, Roquefort," Richard sighs. I've been inquiring about his customary diet, 
and he's been recalling the previous evening's after-dinner cheese at home. 
Richard is not a rhapsodic fellow -- he spends his days pondering mortality 
tables and calculating correlation coefficients -- but the contemplation of 
cheese seems to induce a brief reverie. 
</P>
<P>
He's hardly alone in that enthusiasm. Cheese shops are everywhere in France. 
The tiny, immaculate fromagerie nearest my hotel was always jammed with 
customers who brought to their marketing a seriousness that Americans might 
reserve for an art gallery. 
</P>
<P>
The French eat about 40 pounds of cheese per person each year, compared with 
about half that amount in the United States. That makes it all the more 
perplexing that France ranks so low in heart disease. Cheese is higher in 
cholesterol and saturated fat than even beef or pork. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best known of the anti-cheese preachers is William Connor, a doctor 
and a highly regarded nutritionist at Oregon Health Sciences University. 
Connor, engaged in a study of heart disease in 40 countries, has been analyzing 
the relationship between different countries' consumption of dairy fat -- milk, 
butter, cheese, and so on -- and their rate of heart disease. As he had 
expected, he found the higher the intake of dairy fat, the higher the rate of 
heart disease. It holds for cream, butter and milk, but there's yet to be shown 
any correlation between how much cheese a country eats and how much heart 
disease it has. That sounds like a cue to break out the party hats to me, but 
Connor dismisses his own finding. 
</P>
<P>
"Cheese is an awfully expensive food," he says, "and the amount of cheese 
consumed was probably too low for a correlation to show up." 
</P>
<P>
But Serge Renaud, an epidemiologist based in Lyon, has just visited Connor's 
lab and thinks Connor has given cheese a bad rap. "Even if you look only at 
countries that eat a lot of cheese, you see the same discrepancy," he says. 
"We've seen for years that if you want to get a nice correlation between dairy 
fat and heart disease in different countries, then you've got to remove the 
cheese." 
</P>
<P>
The theory is that calcium neutralizes fat by combining with it so that both 
are excreted rather than absorbed. Curiously, researchers studying the entirely 
different problem of colon cancer have come to similar, though tentative, 
conclusion: Their patients seemed to benefit by supplementing their diet with 
calcium, presumably because it helped neutralize the cancer-promoting fat. 
</P>
<P>
But if calcium makes cheese OK, shouldn't regular whole milk be OK too? It's 
not -- Renaud agrees with nutritionists' "steer clear" warnings -- and he 
concedes he has no real answer to the question. He suspects that whole milk 
promotes heart disease because the calcium binds not to fat, as in cheese, but 
to protein, leaving the fat free to be efficiently absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, cheese remains on every American nutritionist's warning list, 
but not on Renaud's. "It's better to have cheeses that are lower in fat, like 
goat cheese, and these we don't forbid," he says. "First of all, cheese has a 
taste that cannot be replaced by anything else. And secondly, it's not as 
damaging as other things." 
</P>
<P>
Richard sees me looking longingly at our empty bread basket and orders us a 
refill. All around us, diners are gulping down oysters and digging into sea 
urchins and carving up cotes de boeuf. In this tableau of indulgence, the sole 
image of restraint comes from a thin young woman seated at the table next to 
me. A waiter has just brought her dinner: a single spear of asparagus perfectly 
centered on the plate and adorned with one large dab of hollandaise sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The food on all sides has given me a chance to trot out the multifarious 
explanations I'd been given for France's good health. The authorities I'd 
talked to had all proposed pet theories, many of them temptingly tidy, and I 
was sure Richard would know what to make of them. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Tunstall-Pedoe, the British epidemiologist, had placed a lot of weight on 
the quality of French fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that fascinates me about the French is that they shop for fresh 
produce every day," Tunstall-Pedoe had said. "The French treat food with 
enormous respect, and their methods of cooking don't seem to damage it to the 
extent that other culinary traditions do." 
</P>
<P>
The rate of death from heart disease in Scotland is triple the rate in France. 
"The Scots overcook their vegetables -- they stew them," Tunstall-Pedoe had 
said, "and there's a proportion of Scots who eat no fresh fruit at all. 
</P>
<P>
"If -- and this is a big if -- if the anti-oxidant theory is correct," 
Tunstall-Pedoe had told me, "that could tie everything together." Anti-oxidant 
theory? The idea, he explained, is that unstable molecules called free radicals 
maraud around our bodies, in this case damaging fat-carrying particles in the 
blood so they more easily inflict injury on artery walls. The anti-oxidants, 
including certain vitamins and minerals in fresh fruits and vegetables that 
might not survive lengthy cooking, may help neutralize those raiders. 
</P>
<P>
But when I run that suggestion by Richard, he responds with a bemused shrug, a 
resigned sigh. "Perhaps," he allows. "We cannot say." We settle into a pattern. 
I present Richard with some researcher's explanation of France's good health, 
he listens attentively, judiciously considers the matter over a sip of wine and 
then dodges the question. This is a man who would not jump to a conclusion if 
his house were on fire and rescuers were waiting on the ground with nets. 
</P>
<P>
I ask about the theory that the French diet is actually far more healthful than 
the stereotype would have it. "The French eat more vegetables and grains and 
beans than a lot of the rest of the world, and, of course, they're famous bread 
eaters," is what I'd heard from Sonja Connor, a dietitian at Oregon Health 
Sciences University. 
</P>
<P>
I'd heard a related theory from a colleague of Connor's. "The eating habits of 
the French are totally different from here," Sabine Artaud-Wild had told me. 
Artaud-Wild is a French-born dietitian who has been in the United States for 35 
years. "Desserts and the sauces you hear so much about are for special 
occasions," she'd said. "Everyday dessert is cheese and fruit. Portions are 
much smaller, and it's drilled into the French people that you eat at mealtimes 
and not in between." 
</P>
<P>
Richard listens patiently to my paraphrase of those remarks, then says, "Well, 
yes. But we are also eating some things that are not so good." He allows 
himself a tiny, wry smile. 
</P>
<P>
Sausages, for instance. Paris is dotted with charcuteries, heralded by wooden 
signs in the shape of pigs. I'd spent some time wandering through these shops, 
as fascinated and appalled as a small-town minister in Times Square. There were 
sausages of every description and some beyond description. So much for the 
theory that rich and fatty French food is for tourists and real French citizens 
subsist on carrot sticks and mineral water. 
</P>
<P>
But the French diet contains still another mystery. The French consume almost 
as many calories as Americans do, but they look skinnier. I ask Richard whether 
Americans really are fatter. It's unfair, I realize, to make such a pleasant 
man choose between politeness and honesty, but I can't resist. 
</P>
<P>
"When you go to the United States, you are very surprised," he begins, 
gingerly. Then, as his memories grow more vivid, he extends his hands in front 
of him, facing each other, then moves them farther and farther apart, as if 
gauging the size of a pair of great, waddling hips. "What is possible to see in 
France," he says, his hands now about a yard apart, "is usual in the United 
States." He seems momentarily shaken. 
</P>
<P>
Richard also gives the notion of stress, or lack of it, some credence. "In the 
United States," he says, squeezing his eyes shut and clenching his fists like a 
man in a headache commercial, "there is much more pressure." It's certainly 
true that the five-week vacation is a rite of French life and that at my 
customary walking pace I'd kept whipping past French amblers who seemed to have 
no destination at all. But it's hard to buy the stress theory. 
</P>
<P>
Japan, after all, has by far the lowest rate of death from heart disease in the 
industrialized world, and the Japanese are hardly lounging in hammocks and 
gazing at sunsets. And in both Japan and France, the suicide rate, which ought 
to be at least a rough barometer of stress, is far higher than the U.S. rate. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does exercise seem a likely explanation for France's healthy hearts. And it 
seems unlikely that the French share any hereditary traits that might protect 
them. France has been invaded and colonized from all directions for thousands 
of years and its population is hardly homogeneous. 
</P>
<P>
Dessert arrives and interrupts my questioning. Richard and I have both ordered 
oeufs a la neige -- islands of egg white floating on a vast, yellow ocean of 
egg yolks and sugar and milk. The table looks as if the American Heart Assn. 
has come to shoot a horror film. 
</P>
<P>
"So I shouldn't switch to rich cheeses and cream sauces and butter and pate?" 
</P>
<P>
It's the first of my questions that gets a rise out of Richard. He replies in a 
rat-a-tat-tat of dismay, like rain on a tin roof. 
</P>
<P>
"No, no, no, no, no! We do not yet know what is the answer, but it is not 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Richard reflects a moment, then smiles faintly. "Perhaps it is the sky, or the 
light over France," he suggests, and we lift our wine glass in melancholy 
tribute to the abiding distinction in our fates. He lives here. 
</P>
<P>
I have to go back.

After the party, the hangover; after the binge, the diet. And after a couple of 
years when the darling of the cat food market was primo eats for finicky 
felines, it is estimated that 20% of the nation's cats are overweight. (Of 
course, the reason may be the relative disinterest of cats in jogging.) Now the 
latest thing is diet cat foods -- not just pet store brands such as Science 
Diet Light Formula, but reduced-calorie supermarket cat foods such as Purina 
Cat Chow Mature and Lean Entrees From 9 Lives.

Don't Believe Everything You Eat 
</P>
<P>
To its chagrin, the French publishing house of Larousse has discovered that the 
1991 edition of its best-selling dictionary has identified three poisonous 
mushrooms as safe to eat -- including Amanita phalloides, which causes 80% of 
the mushroom deaths in France. "This is a very troubling error," the chief of 
an anti-poison clinic in Paris told the New York Times.

Pilots at Pan American are complaining about their food, says the Wall Street

not so much cheese and bologna. They want pasta instead of steak, and oatmeal 
for breakfast rather than omelets. (But us, what about us?)

Labels, banners, signs on the shopping carts and the check-out dividers, 
reminders over the PA system: These methods of in-store supermarket advertising 
are about to be joined by video. Shoppers' Video, which predicts that it will 
be in 4,000 markets within the next two years, consists of silent ads on maybe 
20 screens scattered around the store. The Checkout Channel will give you about 
two minutes of live CNN news per minute of commercial.

Desserts in holiday gift catalogues always look tempting. But their prices can 
be hard to swallow. The solution? Make the desserts at home. 
</P>
<P>
What follows are recipes for some of the desserts available in this year's crop 
of mail-order gift catalogues. Some are recipes directly from mail-order 
companies, one comes from a local restaurant, and the rest are facsimiles of 
catalogue desserts developed in The Los Angeles Times Test Kitchen. All make 
delicious gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Be sure to prepare the more perishable desserts at the last minute. The Gift 
Catalogue Strudel made with apples and ricotta cheese should be made no sooner 
than one day before giving. The Lemon Cake, Gift Carrot Cake, Chocolate Fudge 
Cake and Macadamia Nut Bread all store well in the refrigerator for about a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
There are a few things to remember if you're mailing the desserts. The obvious: 
Be sure to allow plenty of time for mailing cakes cross-country -- especially 
during the holidays. The post office has delivery schedules you can check to 
calculate how many days your package will spend in transit. Using the proper 
mailing container is essential for on-time delivery. Tins are best for cookies. 
Heavy boxes will probably do fine for firm cakes. Perishable desserts such as 
strudel should be packed apropriately with dry ice and sent through a next-day 
delivery service. If in doubt about the proper packing equipment, leave the 
packing to a professional.

FRUITCAKE: BETTER THAN ITS REPUTATION

<P>
Rose Levy Beranbaum, food writer and author of the award-winning cookbook "The 
Cake Bible," described her creation as: ". . . the sort of fruitcake that has 
more batter than fruit and is so moist it can almost be described as a pudding. 
Molasses provides the slightly bitter edge to temper the sweetness of the 
glaceed fruit. The rum flavor comes through as aromatic but subdued. It took 
years to perfect this recipe because each version had to ripen for three months 
before tasting, and many months would pass between tasting and subsequent 
rebaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "The texture and flavor of this cake are at their best when baked in small 
pans, which also makes serving the small, rich portions easier. Decorative 
baking molds such as the Turk's head provide attractive shapes for gift 
giving." 
</P>
<P>
 Beranbaum's recipe is also featured in her forthcoming new cookbook "Rose's 
Christmas Cookies." She named it Tiny Fruitcake Gems. She suggests piping the 
batter into greased and floured 1/4 inch diameter fluted tartlet tins to make 3 
1/2 dozen cookies.

LESS FRUITY FRUITCAKE 
</P>
<P>
(From "The Cake Bible" 
</P>
<P>
by Rose Levy Beranbaum) 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup small mixed candied fruit 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons candied citron 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup dried currants 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup broken pecans 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup dark rum 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup unsifted cake flour 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
1/8 teaspoon baking soda 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
4 ounces unsalted butter, softened 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup dark brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
1 large egg 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup unsulphured molasses (or 2 tablespoons each molasses and light corn 
syrup) 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons milk 
</P>
<P>
At least 24 hours ahead mince candied fruit and citron (food processor sprayed 
lightly with non-stick vegetable spray works beautifully). Soak with currants 
and nuts in 1/4 cup rum. Cover tightly and store at room temperature. 
</P>
<P>
In small bowl whisk flour, cinnamon, baking soda and salt to combine. In large 
mixing bowl cream butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in egg 
then flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with molasses and milk. Add 
candied fruit mixture with soaking rum and beat until blended. 
</P>
<P>
Scrape batter into greased and floured 3 1/2- to 4-cup baking mold (or 6x2-inch 
cake pan) and bake at 325 degrees 40 to 45 minutes or until cake springs back 
when lightly touched and just begins to shrink from sides of pan and tester 
comes out clean. 
</P>
<P>
Let cake cool in pan 10 minutes. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons rum. Place piece 
plastic wrap large enough to wrap cake on counter. Moisten piece cheesecloth 
also large enough to wrap cake with 1 tablespoon rum. Place cheesecloth on 
plastic wrap, unmold cake onto it, and sprinkle top with remaining 1 tablespoon 
rum. Drape top and sides of hot cake with cheesecloth and plastic wrap, 
pressing closely to cake. 
</P>
<P>
Let cake cool to room temperature before covering tightly with heavy-duty foil. 
Place cake in airtight container such as small tin or heavy-duty plastic 
container. Makes 10 to 12 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Keep at cool temperature 3 months without opening container. This will 
allow rum to mellow. For longer storage, unwrap cake and sprinkle with 
additional tablespoon rum or else aromatic edge of rum will dull and cake will 
become dry. Repeat procedure every 3 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Baked in plain cake pan, cake can be covered with rolled fondant and 
decorated.

Aside from the homemade fruitcake that I grew up with, this lavish cake from 
Sri Lanka is the best that I have ever tasted. Notice the unusual combination 
of ingredients -- cashews, semolina and crystallized ginger as well as 
conventional candied fruits and raisins. Cardamom, an unusual fruitcake 
seasoning, is native to Sri Lanka as are the other spices used. The layer of 
almond paste over the top reminds me of marzipan-coated Scandinavian cakes. 
Kusala Siriwardhane of the Siri Lanka Curry House, who makes this cake, says it 
keeps well, especially if you add an occasional dose of brandy to keep it 
moist. And she is right. I've stored some of the cake, wrapped in foil in an 
airtight container, for almost a year, and it's as good as new, perhaps even 
better.

<P>
It is better, we say, to give a fruitcake than to receive one. Lots better. 
</P>
<P>
But this is the wrong attitude, altogether wrong, totally, totally wrong . . . 
even though sometimes it may have a deceptive appearance of justness. Actually, 
a properly made fruitcake is one of the glories of our heritage, steeped in 
tradition and rum, and this is the time of year to start making them for 
Christmas. Those who believe (wrongly, we hasten to add) that there is only one 
fruitcake in the world, which everybody hands around like a hot potato, will 
find some surprises in the recipes that follow. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the cakes tested here in The Times Test Kitchen, this was the general 
favorite. Even avowed fruitcake haters could be seen secretly sneaking a piece 
of this moist cake.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: THE INCREDIBLE MR. FISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just down the road from the Southwest Museum in Highland Park, across the 
street from a Chevy dealership and right next door to a locally notorious 
church of the occult, is the tiny Mexican seafood cafe Senor Fish, its kitchen 
a former burger shack, its dining room a clean, party-tented patio overrun with 
friendly cats. (I like to think that a Senor Fish actually owns the place, but 
who knows.) Outside there's a neat awning, and brightly painted shrimps and 
shells on the wall; inside, not much more than a takeout window, and a stack of 
newspapers. It's an extremely pleasant place to spend an afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Seated around the rough wooden picnic tables at lunch, a crowd of sweaty 
mechanics and telephone linemen bolt down fried-fish tacos, giant octopus 
burritos, torrents of the milky rice-flour drink, horchata, smoking and 
laughing, occasionally flipping a shrimp or the odd scallop to a cat. The 
loudest noise is the squawking of parrots from a house two doors down. 
</P>
<P>
A little later, young mothers come in pushing strollers, or guys in green scrub 
suits show up from County Hospital, or local writers and artists come strolling 
down the hill from their restored two-bedroom Craftsman houses for 
bargain-priced scallop burritos. Senor Fish is the kind of neighborhood 
restaurant that boosts property values for blocks around. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of a marisqueria is as fine as they come, all lobsters and lake 
crabs and caldrons of stewing squid, but great Mexican seafood is almost as 
hard to find in California as a coelacanth in the Pacific. A place near MGM has 
perfect Veracruz-style fish soup, but ceviche you wouldn't feed to your dog; a 
seafood joint by the cemetery in East Los Angeles serves wonderful fried 
catfish but inedible garlic shrimp. Even south of Tijuana, those famous lobster 
shacks in Puerto Nuevo fry lobsters until they resemble bright red huaraches. 
</P>
<P>
Senor Fish is different. It's cheaper, for one thing -- it would be pretty hard 
to spend more than eight bucks a person here, an amount that's less than the 
fancy places charge for a shrimp cocktail. The cooking is careful and 
imaginative; the seafood scrupulously fresh. Dollar for dollar, it could be the 
best seafood restaurant in town. 
</P>
<P>
There are spicy fried-fish tacos more delicious than the ones they sell on the 
Ensenada waterfront, without the crunch but far fresher, and fat burritos shot 
through with lightly cooked shrimp or sea scallops. (I don't know how Senor 
Fish can afford to put so many scallops in a $3.25 burrito, but they're 
spectacularly good, the smooth sea taste mellowing both the bite of salsa and 
the earthiness of stewed beans.) 
</P>
<P>
Charbroiled fish are fine. Caldo siete mares, the Mexican bouillabaisse that is 
the test of a good Mexican fish house, is everything you want in a fish soup, 
impossible quantities of fish, clams, shrimp and mussels mounded in a huge bowl 
of strong, garlicky broth. The Landlubber's Delite -- an exemplary grilled 
chicken adobado, fragrant with garlic and spice -- is better than the sole meat 
entree has a right to be at a seafood restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Tostadas, the flat, fried corn tortilla kind, are topped with the usual fish 
ceviche, sharp with vinegar and chopped cilantro, or with canned abalone, or 
with shrimp. The best tostada is topped with a wonderful octopus salad -- bits 
of tentacle zapped with sesame, mixed with chunks of cucumber, onion and ripe 
avocado, strewn with herbs, smooth, cool and unctuous. (If Senor Fish called it 
poulpe au sesame et avocat, he could sell it as a $13 appetizer in a West 
Hollywood expense-account restaurant, and "foodies" would line up to eat it.) 
</P>
<P>
Senor Fish has a thing for cheese: seafood quesadillas plump with molten 
Mexican cheese and a garlicky saute of shrimp, scallops and fish, the nicest 
quesadilla ever; rich hors d'oeuvres called "Costa Azul," crisp, bacon-wrapped, 
cheese-stuffed shrimp skewered to squares of fried bread. He fresh-roasts 
chiles for chiles rellenos -- you can see the green things blister right before 
your eyes -- then stuffs them with shrimp and Mexican cheese, dips them in a 
light egg batter, and fries them to order. It's not the fastest fast-food in 
the world, but it's among the nicest. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Senor Fish has some faults. He doesn't serve beer. The French fries 
are limp. And he seems rather too fond of "Krab" with a "K," which is all right 
-- the stuff tastes just fine to those ubiquitous cats with a "c." 
</P>

BACK TO BASICS: AN OLD-FASHIONED HALLOWEEN IDEA: HAVE A TAFFY PULL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The resurgence of Halloween parties not only assures children's safety but also 
offers a chance to have some old-fashioned fun. Remember making taffy? Pulling 
the candy takes time and strong arms, so everyone can get in on the action. 
</P>
<P>
Taffy is made with sugar, water, corn syrup, salt and butter, cooked over low 
heat to between the hard-ball and soft-crack stage. Stir the mixture until the 
sugar dissolves, then cook, uncovered, without stirring until it reaches 265 
degrees on a candy thermometer. 
</P>
<P>
Before beginning to work with the candy, have participants remove finger rings 
-- the candy has been known to pull out settings. Then everyone should wash 
their hands with hot soapy water and rinse and dry them well. 
</P>
<P>
Pour the hot syrup onto a heat-proof surface (Step 1) such as a marble slab, 
large ironstone platter or heavy metal tray. Hold the pouring edge of the pan 
away from you and only a few inches above the slab so the extremely hot syrup 
doesn't spatter. 
</P>
<P>
Do not scrape the pan. Filling it immediately with hot water will ease cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
At this point the candy is too hot to touch with your hands, so use a buttered 
metal spatula to begin working the mixture into a mass. Lift the edges and fold 
them inward (Step 2). 
</P>
<P>
As the candy cools it begins to become opaque (Step 3). Keep in mind, however, 
that although it may have cooled on the surface, the center is apt to still be 
very hot. 
</P>
<P>
When the candy has cooled enough to handle, start pulling it with buttered 
fingertips. (The mass may be divided at this point so several people can help 
with the pulling.) Stretch to about 18 inches, then fold the candy back on 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Repeat the rhythmic pulling until the candy takes on the appearance of a 
glistening crystal ribbon. At this stage begin twisting the candy (Step 4) as 
well as pulling and folding. 
</P>
<P>
Pulling can take from five to 20 minutes, depending on the temperature of the 
room and the speed at which it is pulled. This pulling process incorporates air 
into the taffy and gives it a lighter texture. 
</P>
<P>
The candy is finished when the ridges on the twist begin to hold their shape 
and the mass is opaque and elastic, but still has a satiny finish. Another test 
for readiness is when the end cracks off as the candy is tapped against a hard 
surface (Step 5). 
</P>
<P>
Form the candy back into a ball and press it into a narrow point at the 
fingertip end. Grasping the point in one hand, pull it away from the rest of 
the ball into a long rope about one inch thick. 
</P>
<P>
Cut the taffy with buttered scissors (Step 6) into the desired size pieces. 
Wrap in plastic (Step 7) to prevent it from becoming soft and sticky during 
storage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TAFFY 
</P>
<P>
2 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups water 
</P>
<P>
1 cup light corn syrup 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 teaspoons salt 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened 
</P>
<P>
Combine sugar, water, corn syrup, salt and butter in 3-quart saucepan. Stir 
over low heat until sugar is dissolved and butter melted. 
</P>
<P>
Cook mixture, without stirring, to 265 degrees on candy thermometer. Remove 
from heat. 
</P>
<P>
Holding pouring edge of pan pointed away from body and close to surface, pour 
syrup onto buttered marble slab. Do not scrape pan. 
</P>
<P>
Allow syrup to spread and cool briefly, then begin working candy into mass by 
lifting edges with buttered metal spatula. Fold edges inward. 
</P>
<P>
When candy has cooled enough to handle, start pulling with buttered fingertips. 
(Mass may be divided and pulled by more than 1 person.) Stretch to about 18 
inches, then fold candy back on itself. 
</P>
<P>
Repeat rhythmic pulling until candy takes on appearance of glistening crystal 
ribbon. Then begin twisting candy as well as pulling and folding. 
</P>
<P>
Candy is finished when ridges on twist begin to hold shape and mass is opaque 
and elastic, but still has satiny finish. Another test for readiness is when 
end cracks off as candy is tapped against hard surface. 
</P>
<P>
Form candy back into ball and press into narrow point at fingertip end. 
Grasping point in 1 hand, pull away from rest of ball into long rope about 1 
inch thick. 
</P>
<P>
Cut taffy with buttered scissors into desired size pieces. Wrap in plastic to 
prevent candy from becoming soft and sticky during storage and keep pieces from 
sticking to one another. Makes about 1 1/2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Large ironstone platter or heavy metal tray may be substituted for marble 
slab.

EGGPLANT: FOOD INDIGO 
</P>

Eggplant is the food sponge of the vegetable world; its greatest asset is its 
ability to absorb flavors. In addition, its own natural sweet, bland flavor 
acts as the perfect foil for an endless combination of seasonings. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its unique spongy flesh, the taste and texture of eggplant changes 
dramatically depending on the cooking method used. Grilling lends a meaty 
succulence to the vegetable, especially when followed by a savory marinade of 
good-quality vinegar, olive oil and herbs; frying brings out the sweetness; and 
roasting results in a creamy, nutty flesh. 
</P>
<P>
Although all varieties, regardless of shape or color, have the same taste, 
different types of eggplant lend themselves to different preparations. The 
small white egg-shaped fruits and the Japanese types are perfect for stuffing 
and baking; we also like to roast them whole with heads of garlic. Standard 
large purple eggplant yield slices suitable for grilling or frying. In 
addition, standard eggplants are perfect when roasted whole so that you can 
scoop out the creamy flesh for dips and cold salads. 
</P>
<P>
Of the standard eggplant varieties, Black Beauty, Beauty Hybrid and Burpee 
Hybrid are the most commonly grown. Some Japanese-type eggplants are Ichiban, 
Early Long Purple and Long Tom Hybrid. For lovely small white fruits, try 
planting Easter Egg. Rosa Blanca yields a large, round violet- 
and-white-streaked fruit. All varieties of eggplant are perfectly suitable for 
growing in containers, which should be a minimum of 5 gallons in size. Japanese 
eggplants grown in containers are particularly beautiful on a sunny porch. 
</P>
<P>
A few words about salting. Many recipes suggest salting sliced eggplant before 
cooking to extract bitterness. The source of the vegetable's potential 
bitterness are its seeds, which have a high water content. Salting draws out 
the water and -- with it -- the eggplant's bitterness. When the eggplant is 
young, as it usually is when picked from the home garden, its seeds are pale. 
Older fruits have darker, sometimes even black seeds. We feel that it is 
necessary to salt only older eggplants with darker seeds. Whether in the garden 
or the supermarket, always look for eggplants with taut, glossy skin; these 
qualities are good indicators of youth. 
</P>
<P>
 A highly seasoned mixture of ground lamb and spices is stuffed into the shell 
of the eggplant and baked. For the right portion size, pick eggplant when they 
are about 6 inches long and 4 inches in diameter.

PLANTING ALERT: 
</P>
<P>
Fall can be an incredibly rewarding time in the garden. It's when we realize 
that, in Southern California, we can plant year round. 
</P>
<P>
Now is the time to plant onions, garlic, shallots from sets. Greens such as 
chard, spinach, collards and all types of lettuce can be started from seed, as 
can beets and turnips.

WHAT TO DO WITH HOME-GROWN GARLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCHUYLER INGLE, Ingle is a Seattle writer and co-author of Northwest Bounty, 
Simon &amp; Schuster (1988: $18.95).

<P>
I had better pick the rest of the basil tonight and hang it upside down to dry 
in the dark in the basement. If I let it continue to grow, I may find one 
morning that it has turned black. It is getting colder. 
</P>
<P>
I find myself eyeing compostable items with keen interest, like the leaves 
piling up in the nearby cemetery, a sure sign that fall is upon us. 
</P>
<P>
I heard from a friend who heard from a friend about a woman with a 
two-truckload pile of horse manure in her back yard. She wants to get rid of 
it. I'm going over to start hauling it away. It's the real thing, see. No wood 
shavings, which take forever to break down and tie up nitrogen in the process. 
Without free access to nitrogen, most plants don't care to grow. With free 
access to composted horse manure, next year's garden ought to produce some 
interesting results. 
</P>
<P>
The corn looks pathetic. It's time to pick the last ears and run the stalks 
through the shredder. My plan is to cut the corn off the last of the cobs and 
saute the kernels in sweet butter. No boiling this way. Just the bare elements: 
corn, butter, heat. 
</P>
<P>
I have been surprised this year by my main accomplishment. I thought my first 
Melrose apples would consume my attention, but I am unabashedly proud of my 
garlic crop. It hangs next to the kitchen door in a long, 13-pound braid. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Lewis of Martin's Farm took pity on me and showed me how to braid garlic. 
That is to say, Kathy braided my garlic for me, though every once in a while I 
had a go at it, made a mess and handed it right back. My foolish garden pride, 
however, is undiminished and I am determined to plant garlic in a big way next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Garlic is an odd little bulb. Use a lot and it transforms a dish. Use a little 
and it gives itself over to other flavors, encouraging them to step forward. 
Like chile peppers, garlic has spread throughout the world. Chile peppers 
started in the New World. Garlic started in the Old World, moving south, then 
west and east with the horsemen and herdsmen who had a way of terrifying and 
conquering the then-known world. 
</P>
<P>
It is said that Magellan found garlic in the Philippines and that Cortez found 
it in Mexico. It is likely both explorers carried garlic with them in their 
ships' stores, if not in their pockets. 
</P>
<P>
My braid won't last long. I use too much of the stinking bulb. Each year I make 
a trip up near the Canadian frontier to visit Cloud Mountain Farm where I buy 
apples and bulk garlic. I'll come home with a big bag of loose bulbs and keep 
them in the basement. Cloud Mountain grows a garlic with silver skin, a garlic 
typical of Italy. By spring, the bulbs will have begun to show some green 
sprouts, and it will be time to plant garlic in the garden. 
</P>
<P>
I guess it's the multiplication that has caught my attention, that for each 
clove of garlic I planted I was able to harvest an entire bulb, some of them 
bigger than others. If I'm careful to select out the biggest bulbs and plant 
those cloves next spring, I should have quite a handsome braid next year, as 
long as Lewis is willing to nurse me along. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, there's enough garlic kicking around that I think I'll peel a 
couple of bulbs and roast the cloves. Browned and softened like that, garlic 
loses its sharpness and becomes sweet and nutty. Roasted garlic spread on a 
slice of fresh, crusty, chewy bread: This is what food gardening is all about. 
</P>
<P>
ROASTED GARLIC 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon peanut oil 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon olive oil 
</P>
<P>
12 large cloves garlic, peeled 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
White pepper 
</P>
<P>
Melt butter, peanut oil and olive oil in small, flame-proof casserole over 
medium heat. Place garlic cloves in oil in single layer, stirring to coat with 
mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees 20 to 30 minutes, basting 
occasionally, until cloves are well browned and tender. Season to taste with 
salt and white pepper and serve warm. Makes 4 appetizer servings.

A HOT NIGHTSPOT;

BOB HOPE HELPS OPEN USO CLUB IN HISTORIC BUILDING

<P>
A Navy man spent most of a recent Friday night watching a horror movie and 
eating popcorn. A friend downstairs shot pool while another tested his skill at 
video games. And a fourth spent much of the evening chatting with a female 
volunteer over Cokes and candy bars. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a nice place," said Kenny Lattin, 30, one of the four sailors. "It's a 
homey place to relax and feel comfortable." Lattin, a hospital corpsman from 
Lawton, Okla., is stationed aboard the USS Mount Vernon, an amphibious assault 
vessel, in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the newest nightspot in town. Nearly two years behind schedule, the 
famed Bob Hope Hollywood USO Club has finally reopened, with a slightly revised 
name, in a historic building in downtown Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the grand old comedian himself was on Pine Avenue to 
participate in the hoopla surrounding the facility, renamed the Long Beach Bob 
Hope USO Club. "I think it's marvelous," he said Monday. "This is a very hot 
spot for the USO. This is where the Navy is." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Hope announced that he would be traveling to the Persian 
Gulf soon to stage Christmas shows for U.S. troops there, although he will have 
to change his act to make it acceptable to Arab censors. 
</P>
<P>
"How am I going to go without the girls?" he said, referring to the platoon of 
starlets that usually accompany his tours. "I'd hate to think I was the only 
pretty face there." 
</P>
<P>
Hope's career as one of the country's best-known funny men is inexorably tied 
to the history of the USO, which stands for United Services Organization. 
Founded in 1941, the Hollywood club became a model for the chain of USO clubs 
chartered by Congress to serve the needs of the nation's military by providing 
drop-in centers around the world and traveling shows such as those featuring 
Hope. 
</P>
<P>
The first of its kind in the nation, the Hollywood club reached its zenith 
during World War II when young soldiers and sailors showed up there by the 
thousands to rub elbows with famous movie stars serving as entertainers, coffee 
servers and dance partners. 
</P>
<P>
Then the war ended and the neighborhood began to change. With the proliferation 
of other entertainment facilities throughout the region, fewer and fewer 
military people -- most of whom were based near Long Beach or in Orange County 
-- were willing to make the trek to Hollywood. By the 1980s, the Hollywood club 
shared a block with a club featuring nude dancers, and began to lose its 
reputation for providing a wholesome environment capable of attracting a new 
generation of military people. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1988, the Greater Los Angeles Area USO announced that it was 
closing shop in Hollywood and moving to the Pacific Coast Club building, 
formerly a Masonic Temple, in downtown Long Beach. The move, they said, would 
make the club readily accessible to the estimated 30,000 military personnel 
stationed at the several major military installations in the greater Long Beach 
area. 
</P>
<P>
But the reopening has been a long time coming. USO officials faced unexpected 
delays in obtaining required permits from the city, difficulties in finding a 
contractor and a pay dispute with the architect hired to draw the plans. 
Officials initially had hoped to open in December, 1988, but the opening was 
postponed repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the organization recorded a 45% decline in contributions -- a 
major source of financial support. Officials said they feared the nonprofit 
organization's future was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
This month's opening, however, seems to have put a light at the end of the 
tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
"We're back in the swing of things," said Dewey Smith, the organization's 
president. With the club now open, he said, would-be donors feel more confident 
in supporting the USO's work. "Our financial situation is better. We have 
fund-raisers scheduled and donations coming in. We're visible now and the word 
is getting out." 
</P>
<P>
To help lure people to the club, USO officials say they have added a number of 
services more relevant to the needs of today's military personnel. Compared to 
their counterparts of World War II, the officials say, the new generation of 
military recruits tends to be older, better educated, less transient and more 
likely to be married. 
</P>
<P>
The new features include a special telephone "warm line" for latchkey military 
children, an employment resource center to help find jobs, and a reference 
service for such things as child care, counseling and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Capitalizing on the public's renewed interest in military matters since the 
Persian Gulf crisis, the USO recently conducted areawide campaigns that brought 
in thousands of letters, shampoo bottles and paperback books for U.S. forces 
stationed in Saudi Arabia. It also distributed hundreds of copies of a coloring 
book explaining the deployment to the children of military people involved. 
</P>
<P>
But the heart of the local organization remains its drop-in club, a three-story 
5,100-square-foot facility that is open free of charge to anyone bearing a 
military ID. Surrounded by decor of red, white or blue, young soldiers and 
sailors can watch television, drink nonalcoholic beverages, eat homemade 
cookies, read magazines, shoot pool, play video games or just hang out and 
relax with their friends. 
</P>
<P>
The club, at 230 Pine Ave., is open Monday through Friday from 2 to 10 p.m., 
and on Saturdays from 6 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Special theme nights include televised football on Mondays, checkers Tuesdays 
and movies with popcorn every Wednesday. The club also features Bart Simpson 
night on Thursdays, during which patrons watch the popular television program 
and eat Butterfinger candy bars. Friday is "chips ahoy" poker night. In 
addition, the USO is planning special dances and parties for Halloween, 
Oktoberfest and Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Since opening Oct. 1, said Marsha Goodale, club director, the facility has 
attracted an average of 10 to 15 service people a night, or about 90 a week. 
Once word of the new club spreads, she said, she hopes to serve as many as 350 
a week. 
</P>
<P>
That number is far short of the 2,000-per-week predicted by USO officials when 
they first announced the move two years ago, a fact Smith, the president, now 
attributes to the inflated projections of a former director. "People get 
(overly) optimistic sometimes," he said. "The director at that time probably 
felt that the club would be larger." 
</P>
<P>
Numbers, however, seemed of little concern to the handful of sailors gathered 
for an evening at the club last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I come to get away from the stress (of Navy life)," said Donald Ostling, 22, a 
boatswain's mate on the battleship Missouri. "I come to relax and think so that 
I can plan (my future.)" 
</P>
<P>
Said Aaron Thompkins, 29, a hospital corpsman from New York City: "I think (the 
club is) good. It helps guys who are new to the area get into something besides 
trouble."

CANDIDATES GALORE LINE UP TO SUCCEED LATE MAYOR TUCKER;

<P>
Three of the four City Council members have announced plans to run for mayor in 
a special election in April to replace Mayor Walter R. Tucker, who died of 
cancer Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
As council members began announcing their intentions Tuesday during the council 
meeting, Councilman Maxcy D. Filer, acting as chairman, turned to the audience 
and remarked, "Is there anyone else that wants to announce for mayor?" 
</P>
<P>
Filer and Councilwomen Bernice Woods and Patricia A. Moore said they plan to 
run. The fourth council member, Jane Robbins, announced that she will seek 
reelection to the council in April. Filing for the election does not begin 
until February. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker's son, Walter Jr., also said he plans to run. Tucker, a 33-year-old 
lawyer, has set up a committee to begin raising money for his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"After a lot of prayer . . . and contemplation, I believe that it's the Lord's 
will," Tucker said. "And also I believe that it would be in honor of my father 
to take the baton and carry on the dream and the principles that he began." 
</P>
<P>
The council unanimously agreed Tuesday to combine the special mayoral election 
with the April 16 municipal elections. Under the City Charter, the council 
could have appointed a new mayor or ordered a separate mayoral election before 
April. 
</P>
<P>
Personal ambitions and a 2-2 split on the council, however, made it unlikely 
that the four could agree on an appointee. And City Clerk Charles Davis 
insisted that it would be too expensive and too time consuming to hold a 
separate election before April. 
</P>
<P>
The decisions by Moore and Woods to run for mayor had been expected. However, 
Filer's entry into the race comes as a surprise to many. Filer, 60, had been 
telling people that he would not seek reelection to the council when his term 
expired in April. He and Robbins, 71, were first elected to the council in a 
special election 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Filer said he decided to stay on and run for mayor because winning would offer 
him a better chance to influence city policy. People perceive that the mayor's 
position has more authority than it actually has, Filer said. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to move Compton forward, and the only way to do it is to shift over to 
the other seat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Compton, the mayor is elected by the voters, performs ceremonial duties, is 
chairman for council meetings and represents the city with other government 
bodies. But the mayor has just one council vote. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign is expected to be lively. Moore and Woods, a former school 
trustee, were elected to the council last year, ousting longtime incumbents. 
However, the two quickly became rivals, sniping at one another during council 
meetings and voting on opposite sides of many issues. 
</P>
<P>
Filer and Moore have been political allies on the council. On Tuesday, however, 
Moore cast the only negative vote when the council selected Filer to serve as 
mayor pro tem until after the election. She said the job should be rotated 
among the four council members. 
</P>
<P>
The winner in April will fill out the remaining two years of Tucker's term. 
There are no provisions in the charter for a runoff, if one candidate fails to 
receive a majority of votes in a special election. 
</P>
<P>
In the race for council seats, however, regular election procedures will 
prevail. If one candidate fails to get a majority, the top two vote-getters 
would be forced into a runoff. The council seats held by Robbins and Filer will 
be on the April ballot. 
</P>
<P>
If Woods and Moore are losers in the mayoral contest, they will still hold 
seats on the council. Filer, however, would be out of office if he loses. His 
term expires in April, and mayoral candidates cannot run for that office and 
for election to the council at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
In Compton, council members run for four district seats. They must live in the 
district they represent but are elected in a citywide vote. 
</P>
<P>
A long line of council candidates is already forming. Two of them -- Basil G. 
Kimbrew and the Rev. Walter Goodin -- are political allies of Moore's. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrew, 37, is a community activist and professional political consultant 
working as assistant political director of Democrat Dianne Feinstein's 
gubernatorial campaign. He managed Moore's campaign last year. He is running 
against Robbins in District 4. 
</P>
<P>
Goodin, 39, is assistant pastor of Faith Chapel Baptist Church in Los Angeles 
and is a member of Compton Block Club Commission. He is running in District 1 
for the council seat Filer is vacating. 
</P>
<P>
Moore and the two council candidates said they are not running as a slate, but 
they acknowledged that they are supporting one another. 
</P>
<P>
Also running in District 1 is John Steward, a trustee in the Compton Unified 
School District. Steward, a probation officer, announced his candidacy Tuesday 
when he heard that Filer would not seek reelection to the council. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Bonner, who owns a beauty salon in Compton, repeated Tuesday that he 
will run for Robbins' seat. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Cressel, who owns an office supply business in Compton and has run 
unsuccessfully for office before, said he is considering a mayoral or council 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Esters, who forced Tucker into a runoff last year, said he did not know 
if he would enter the contest this time. He said he would not make a decision 
until early next year, when he returns from Africa, where he is scheduled to 
travel in December on business for his new commodities trading company.

DOWNEY COUNCIL OKS 3% UTILITY TAX TO ADD 27 OFFICERS TO POLICE 
</P>

<P>
The City Council has given preliminary approval for a 3% utility tax to raise 
money for 27 new police officers, a 23% increase in the size of the city's 
force. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Tuesday unanimously approved the tax, which must win final 
approval at a special meeting scheduled for Oct. 30. Councilwoman Barbara 
Hayden did not attend the meeting but submitted a statement in support of the 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance approved Tuesday, 4 to 0, residents and businesses would 
pay a tax equal to 3% of their electricity, gas and telephone bills. That would 
amount to $30 to $60 a year for the average family, Assistant City Manager Lee 
Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials expect to raise about $2.1 million a year from the tax, which is 
enough to pay for the 27 officers, a secretary, two police aides and one clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Downey Police Chief D. Clayton Mayes told the council that his department is 
understaffed and urged approval. 
</P>
<P>
Downey has about 1.3 police officers per 1,000 residents, which leaves the city 
ranking 10th among 13 similar cities recently surveyed by Downey 
administrators, according to Powell. Inglewood ranked first, with two officers 
per 1,000 residents. Long Beach, which was not included in the survey, has 1.6 
officers per 1,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
Increased crime in 1989 points to a need for more officers, Mayes said. 
Aggravated assaults increased nearly 80% from 1988 to 1989: from 153 to 275. 
Car thefts were up about 38%, from 875 to 1,211, and burglaries and robberies 
were up 4% and 3%, respectively, according to city crime reports. 
</P>
<P>
"No one will make any friends passing a new tax," Mayor Roy L. Paul said. "I 
don't want to, but in my heart I know it's gotten to the point where we don't 
have alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
The council moved surprisingly fast to bolster the city's police force. At a 
meeting just two weeks ago, the council had asked for an itemized report on 
long-term police needs. 
</P>
<P>
One incident that contributed heavily to the council's quick action was an Oct. 
9 armed robbery of a PACE store, during which two Downey officers were shot. 
</P>
<P>
Just four officers were on duty, minimum staffing in the early morning hours of 
a weekday, Mayes said, and there were at least six robbers. 
</P>
<P>
"Although all four officers responded to the situation, they were seriously 
outmanned by the gang attempting to rob the PACE store," Powell wrote in a 
report to the council. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor contributing to the quick action is Proposition 136 on the Nov. 
6 ballot. If approved, the initiative would require that a majority of city 
voters approve such tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why staff came roaring back with it this quickly -- that and the 
roaring violence in the city," Councilwoman Diane P. Boggs said. "I have felt 
for some time that we're undergoing a change here in the city. We've been able 
to slide by with a department smaller than others have had." 
</P>
<P>
The council action drew immediate criticism from about half a dozen taxpayers, 
who said the city should find funding alternatives. They suggested spending 
cuts in other areas to free money for the police. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to have this tax, you should call a special election and sell it 
to the voters," resident Joel H. Lubin said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, one opponent cautioned that the city could lose property tax 
revenue if the utility tax is enacted. 
</P>
<P>
Downey had a 5% utility tax from 1970 until 1977, when the City Council 
suspended it. State lawmakers soon passed legislation that required Los Angeles 
County to give Downey more property tax revenue to make up for the loss. That 
amounted to $300,000 in 1978, Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
Former Councilman Ken Miller said the county could take action to eliminate 
that special allotment. Miller said that he supports an increase in the police 
force but that the council should consider other ways of raising money. 
</P>
<P>
"Passing the utility tax could well wipe that (revenue) out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller estimated that the special allotment amounts to $2 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Powell, the assistant city manager, said city officials do not know the amount 
of the allotment.

ZONING PROPOSAL IN BELL GARDENS STIRS APARTMENT UPROAR; 
</P>
<P>
PLANNING: CHANGES ARE RECOMMENDED THAT WOULD DRASTICALLY CURB MULTIUNIT 
BUILDINGS AND A HAPHAZARD MIX OF COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL AND RESIDENTIAL USES.

BELL GARDENS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds of residents are fuming over a city Planning Commission decision to 
recommend major zoning changes that could force some property owners eventually 
to give up their homes or businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents threatened a bid to recall of the entire City Council unless it 
rejects the Planning Commission's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, after a raucous six-hour meeting, the five planning 
commissioners voted unanimously to recommend adoption of the zoning changes 
that would drastically reduce the number of apartment buildings. The changes 
also would eradicate the haphazard mix of commercial, industrial and 
residential uses in neighborhoods throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
The final decision must be made by the City Council, which is expected to 
discuss the issue sometime in December or January. In the meantime, city 
officials are planning to hold several neighborhood meetings to explain the 
zoning changes, which would allow property owners 20 to 40 years to comply. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission's decision triggered howls of outrage from the 
estimated 400 residents and business owners who packed a city auditorium a week 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Recall, recall, recall," about 100 people began chanting as they swarmed 
toward the stage where the planning commissioners sat. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this never happens to your grandchildren," a young girl said quietly to 
commission Chairwoman Maria Elena Alvarez, as Alvarez gathered her papers and 
prepared to leave the auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
City leaders say that, in the long run, the proposed changes will make Bell 
Gardens a more desirable place to live -- a city with less people, less 
traffic, better shopping areas and better services such as police and fire 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
But many residents and business owners say they believe Bell Gardens is fine 
the way it is. Residents say the council wants to turn back the clock to a time 
when this was a quiet suburb of middle-class property owners even if it means 
driving out the current residents to do it. 
</P>
<P>
By the latest census count, about 42,000 people live in Bell Gardens. Most are 
renters, and according to county data, the average per capita income is $5,405 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't care about us," said 19-year resident Zandra Juarez. "They are 
trying to run the poor people out of here and turn this into a Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they are not picking on certain residents and are not 
trying to drive anyone out of town. Council members Douglas O'Leary and Robert 
Cunningham, as well as Planning Commission Chairwoman Alvarez, would be 
affected. Both O'Leary and Cunningham live in high-density areas that would 
become low-density areas. Cunningham said he eventually would have to convert 
or get rid of one of the houses on his property, and stands to lose $40,000. 
Alvarez's residence would be in a commercial zone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrible thing to go through," Alvarez said. "My two children were born 
and raised in that home. We own it. We put a lot of money into it. But at the 
same time, we have to think of the future of the city. We can't have a home in 
a commercial area." 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting last week, Alvarez told a hostile and impatient audience that 
the commission members had mulled over the changes thoroughly, and "have been 
troubled by it." But residents said they felt that the Planning Commission had 
made its decision long before they sat down at the meeting last week. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter what we say," one irate resident shouted at Alvarez. "It's 
what you guys want." 
</P>
<P>
City officials have been planning for years to reduce the city's density, and 
clean up the mix of houses, businesses and industry in some neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics from the county Department of Regional 
Planning, Bell Gardens is the fifth most crowded city in the county, with 
15,700 residents per square mile. The city is approximately 2.4 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Claude Booker said the high density leads to more crime and 
overcrowded conditions, and strains the city's water and sewer systems. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the city amended its General Plan -- its map of what the city should 
be like in years to come -- to include goals of reducing density, consolidating 
shopping areas, and ending mixed zoning that allowed businesses and homes to 
sit side by side, Booker said. According to state law, the city must now bring 
its zoning code in line with the General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
Although city officials could change the General Plan, Booker said, "That is 
not an option." He said numerous city studies have concluded that density must 
be decreased. 
</P>
<P>
People who live in the areas earmarked for zoning revisions would have 20 to 40 
years to either move or convert the use of their buildings to comply with the 
new code. For example, a homeowner whose property would be changed to a 
commercial zone would have to move or convert the home to an office. A resident 
whose property would be changed from high density to lower density zoning could 
convert a four-apartment complex to two apartments. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a strong misconception that we are going to tear down homes," Booker 
said. "Nothing in the zoning change calls for the destruction of a building." 
</P>
<P>
But some residents observed that if their home is in a zone other than 
residential, sooner or later they would have to move. 
</P>
<P>
"I was here before your Police Department was here, before your City Hall was 
here. . . . Now you tell me I will have to move," said Maria Pena, a 25-year 
resident whose home sits on a parcel planned for commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents who live in areas targeted for zone changes other than 
residential complained that they had spent their lives saving money to buy 
their homes, and now they will have to give them up without compensation. They 
also said they feared their property would decline drastically in value. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the changes would affect high-density housing where there is one unit 
per 2,600 square feet. If the changes are adopted, about 70% of these 
apartments eventually would be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Landlords told the Planning Commission that if they were forced to reduce the 
number of apartments on their lots, rents would be raised. Tenants complained 
that affordable rental units would disappear in Bell Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens to the tenants you force me to kick out?" landlord Ken Quon asked 
the commission. 
</P>
<P>
"La calle, la calle (the street, the street)," the audience chanted. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, city officials admit there is a "price to pay" for the turnaround that 
they are attempting in their city. They admit that with less density, and neat, 
identifiable industrial, commercial and residential blocks, Bell Gardens will 
become a more desirable place to live and property values will go up. 
</P>
<P>
Booker said that if the zoning changes are adopted, all industry eventually 
would be on the east side of town, all commercial on the west side, and 
high-density residential property, such as apartments, along the main streets. 
The neighborhoods behind the apartments would be zoned for single-family 
residences and two- or three-unit apartments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, Bell Gardens officials approved their first zoning laws that attempted 
to create distinct commercial, industrial and residential areas. The effect of 
one of those laws, which requires small neighborhood businesses in residential 
areas to give way to residences, is just now being felt. Neighborhood business 
operators were given 20 years to either convert their properties or move, and 
the deadline is January. Some business owners now contend they were never told 
about the January deadline. They also say they have invested time and money in 
their businesses, but the city does not have to compensate them for any losses.

CUSTODIANS THREATEN TO WALK OFF JOBS 
</P>

<P>
Labor organizers say janitors who clean six of Glendale's new office towers are 
threatening to walk off the job early next month in protest of low wages and a 
lack of benefits. Organizers charge that the plight of custodians is in sharp 
contrast to the salaries and benefits earned by office workers and managers in 
the buildings they service. 
</P>
<P>
To demonstrate their position and muster courage among themselves, about 50 
custodians and their supporters staged a noon rally last Friday on a patio at 
the Glendale Superior Court building at Broadway and Glendale Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing red Justice for Janitors T-shirts, protesters marched in circles under 
a courthouse olive tree, sang songs and carried signs as passersby gawked and 
drivers honked. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Ragen, project director of Justice for Janitors, a committee of Service 
Employees International Union, said workers are protesting what they believe is 
unfair treatment by Bradford Building Services of Los Angeles, the largest 
non-union maintenance firm in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Ragen said Bradford employees are paid the minimum wage of $4.25 an hour and 
receive no benefits, while union workers with other companies earn an average 
of $6 an hour and have family health insurance, sick leave and vacations. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Smith, president of Bradford, denied the union's allegations. "Our wage 
rates run typically from $4.85 to $10 an hour," he said, and workers usually 
receive some benefits, depending on individual contracts with building 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said his company and union organizers have been battling in the courts 
and before the National Labor Relations Board for 10 years. He declined to 
discuss the actions in detail because of pending litigation. However, Smith 
said there are 2,600 other cleaning contractors in Southern California, "most 
of which are non-union." 
</P>
<P>
Ragen said union organizers have targeted the Glendale area during the last two 
months because of the community's growing prominence as a labor and 
service-based economy. "The janitors are organizing to make sure that the shift 
does not mean a two-tier economy which forces the new service-sector workers to 
live in poverty," Ragen said. 
</P>
<P>
Jono Shaffer, a labor organizer who accompanied demonstrators with his guitar, 
said all of the Bradford employees in Glendale have signed union authorization 
cards and have voted to support a strike, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
However, Shaffer said the union does not formally represent workers because an 
election has not been held. "An election is really a bureaucratic process which 
we don't use anymore," Shaffer said. "We see no need to get bogged down in the 
lengthy, drawn-out process." Instead, he asked that the company "listen to what 
their workers are saying." 
</P>
<P>
Ragen said demands by custodians are often ignored by managers until they 
strike. He said about 45 employees at Glendale buildings are ready to walk out, 
probably early next month. 
</P>
<P>
The buildings targeted are at 330, 505, 550, 611 and 801 N. Brand Blvd. and at 
700 N. Central Ave. -- all cleaned under contractual agreements with Bradford. 
</P>
<P>
About 140 workers participated in a protest march in Glendale in September 
outside two high-rise office buildings serviced by Bradford. During that 
protest, Glendale police watched but did not interfere. 
</P>
<P>
On June 15, a larger Justice for Janitors march against another firm in Century 
City led to a violent confrontation with baton-wielding Los Angeles police, 
resulting in 40 arrests and 16 injuries. 
</P>
<P>
During Friday's demonstration in Glendale, union organizers instructed 
participants in "civil disobedience." Some workers linked arms to simulate 
blocking an entrance to a building, while others, with paper stars pinned to 
their shirts, played the roles of arresting officers. 
</P>
<P>
One worker who was arrested in the Century City demonstration urged her 
co-workers not to be afraid. "I was afraid when I did it, but not now," she 
said in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Another custodian, employed in Glendale, said: "I hope that we are not forced 
to go out on strike. But if we must, we will, because our cause is a just one."

SANTA MONICA-MALIBU LOOKING AT 'F' IN SAFETY; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: PROP. ES, A $75-MILLION BOND MEASURE, IS AIMED AT RENOVATING THE 
DISTRICT'S OLD BUILDINGS.

<P>
Hunks of the stucco walls have fallen off, the paint is curling back, the 
heating system has a mind of its own, the pipes burst on occasion, and the 
carpeting -- garish orange in some rooms, baby blue in others -- is threadbare, 
stained and ripped. 
</P>
<P>
This fixer-upper is Santa Monica High School. The cost of the repairs: about 
$20 million. 
</P>
<P>
The high school and the other campuses in the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified 
School District have been neglected so long that the district has put a 
$75-million bond measure, Proposition ES, on the Nov. 6 ballot to raise money 
for renovations. The general obligation bond, which requires approval by 
two-thirds of the voters, is enjoying widespread support and has no organized 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
But even so, proponents are only "conservatively optimistic," Supt. Eugene 
Tucker said. Statewide, general obligation bonds in local school districts have 
about a 55% passage rate. Only about 10% of households in the Santa 
Monica-Malibu district have school-age children. 
</P>
<P>
District residents, however, have supported the schools in the past. They voted 
in a $58-per-parcel tax for the district in 1984 and again in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds would be sold over four years, beginning in September, 1991. They 
would be repaid through increases in the property tax rate over 28 years. The 
average homeowner in the district -- whose home is assessed at $236,000 -- 
would pay about $27 more in property taxes the first year. The tax increase for 
the average homeowner would peak at $146 in the fourth year and begin to 
decline. The annual increase would average $68 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The four candidates for the Santa Monica Rent Control Board who are backed by 
Santa Monicans for Renters' Rights have said they will favor passing through 
the tax increases to tenants. Renters would pay about $2 more a month. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Santa Monica-Malibu district's 13 schools are more than 50 years 
old. Much of the work that is needed -- more than 40% -- is required for health 
and safety reasons, such as bringing the buildings up to earthquake- and 
fire-safety standards and removing exposed asbestos, according to a report by 
consultant Hamilton, Rabinovitz &amp; Alschuler Inc. About 20% of the work is 
needed just to put the schools in good repair. Some of the funds would be used 
to make facilities accessible to the disabled and to modernize classrooms and 
libraries. 
</P>
<P>
Each school would receive at least $2.5 million, with the largest chunk going 
to the 2,770-student high school, where, according to Principal Nardy Samuels, 
the heating blasts one day but conks out the next. Sometimes during the winter, 
temperatures in the classrooms dip to the 50s, and teachers have to wear 
gloves, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In several hallways and rooms, the linoleum tiles are a crazy-quilt pattern of 
various ages and shades of gray and brown. Acoustical tiles have dropped from 
the ceiling, almost hitting students a couple of times, Samuels said. Steps and 
walkways, cracked and uneven, are accidents "waiting to happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Room 109, where Stella Staley teaches typing, a ceiling tile droops, the 
roof leaks, water seeps in from the windows and the stucco is crumbling. One 
weekend last year, a pipe broke and flooded Mildred Farmer's classroom. 
</P>
<P>
The school, built in the 1930s, has hobbled along with "only the bare 
necessities" in repairs, Samuels said. "Every single (classroom) needs work," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about serious stuff. We're not talking about little niceties," 
school board member Della Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
The bond amount would be among the largest issued for a local school district 
in California, and amounts to about $8,065 per student. But, said Tucker, every 
penny is justified. The $75-million figure comes from an assessment of the 
district's facilities, done by a team of architects and reviewed by a community 
task force, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The state of decay has resulted from the financial crunch brought on by 
Proposition 13 and declining enrollment, Tucker said. School districts in 
California are funded primarily through the state, based on attendance. 
Enrollment in the Santa Monica-Malibu district has declined over the past 
several years, dropping to 9,300 students from about 9,500 two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The district has tried to keep budget cuts away from the classroom, Barrett 
said. "When your choices are to cut the educational program or to just defer 
replacing the plumbing for another year, you defer the plumbing," she said. 
"But there comes a time when it must really be faced, and we're at that point 
now." 
</P>
<P>
There are no other sources to pay for the needed work, district officials say. 
State funds are "too little and too late," Tucker said. Private donations are 
invariably for books, copy machines, even scissors and jump ropes, rather than 
the duller items of plumbing and electrical wiring. 
</P>
<P>
The regular school budget for this year is $49.8 million. Less than 4% of that, 
or about $1.93 million, has been allocated for maintenance and repairs, 
including the salaries of maintenance employees.

If the bond passes, construction would start in the 1992-93 school year and be 
finished within about six years, Tucker said. To stave off disrepair in the 
future, the district is considering selling some of its surplus property and 
using the interest on the money for maintenance of the refurbished buildings, 
Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
Bond supporters have formed into Citizens for Safe Schools and are backed by 
the Santa Monica City Council, the elected group that will constitute the 
Malibu City Council upon incorporation, the school board and the candidates 
running for it, the teachers union, the PTA, state Sens. Gary Hart (D-Santa 
Barbara) and Hershel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa 
Monica), Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane Dana, the Santa Monica police 
chief, the Rent Control Board, Santa Monica Chamber of Commerce, Santa Monicans 
for Renters' Rights and Concerned Homeowners of Santa Monica. About 100 
volunteers, including high school students getting extra social studies credit, 
are walking precincts campaigning for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens for Safe Schools has raised about $40,000, and is spending it "as we 
get it in," political consultant Mark Siegel said. 
</P>
<P>
There is no argument against Proposition ES in the voter pamphlet.

INSTRUMENTS: BENITO HUIPE TAKES MONTHS TO CREATE MASTERPIECES THAT ARE PLAYED 
BY CONCERT AND FLAMENCO ARTISTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The walls of Benito Huipe's workshop on Washington Boulevard in Culver City are 
covered with his handiwork. Guitars, in various stages of construction, hang by 
pegs. Each is made of the finest wood available, gathered from four continents. 
</P>
<P>
The guitars' sides and backs, a deep reddish-brown hue, are made of rosewood 
from Brazil or India. The soundboard, or front, is hard German spruce. The long 
neck is made of mahogany from Honduras, and the black fingerboard is fashioned 
from ebony from Madagascar. Each instrument emanates a woody scent that comes 
from the inner bracing made from Spanish cedar. 
</P>
<P>
Huipe, 43, is one of a handful of craftsmen in Southern California who make 
fine guitars by hand. 
</P>
<P>
His work has attracted the attention of numerous concert artists and flamenco 
guitarists throughout the country who now play his guitars. 
</P>
<P>
Huipe started making guitars in his hometown of Paracho, Michoacan, a small 
village in the highlands west of Mexico City. His first job was in the workshop 
of his father's friend, Luis Vargas, where he began by putting strings and 
tuning pegs on guitars. 
</P>
<P>
"And then I started making my own guitars, small ones, you know, like 
ukuleles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He learned the finer points of instrument-making from his brother, Miguel, who 
is an expert violin bow craftsman. Miguel went to a school in Mexico City where 
he learned the basics of instrument craftsmanship. He then passed on his 
knowledge to his brother, Benito. 
</P>
<P>
"He taught me to understand the difference in sound between a classical guitar 
and a flamenco guitar, Huipe said. He told me, 'Benito, with flamenco guitars 
the strings have to be very close to the soundboard so that the sound of the 
strings blends with the sound of the wood, like a drum, very dry, very dry, 
like a flamenco dancer, very harsh. And with a classical guitar, the strings 
have to be very separated from the soundboard, so it will sound very clear, 
very sustained.' " 
</P>
<P>
He also learned by carefully examining the work of other guitar makers. When he 
arrived in the United States more than 20 years ago, he got a job at the Valdez 
Guitar Shop in West Hollywood, where he repaired guitars built by some of the 
best craftspeople in the world. When he repaired a guitar, he would study its 
construction closely. 
</P>
<P>
"I took ideas from all the instruments I repaired," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After five years of repairing other people's guitars, he struck out on his own, 
setting up a workshop in his garage. He took the instruments he made there to 
restaurants that featured flamenco music to display his wares to guitarists and 
eventually attracted several faithful customers. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Boroff, a professional guitarist and recording artist who owns three of 
Huipe's guitars, said Huipe's guitars "have an emotional quality, a 
personality." Although most guitars used by professional artists are 
technically well made, he said, they often sound "unromantic." Huipe's guitars, 
however, "are in essence very romantic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Each guitar has a psyche. They are all really extremely beautiful," he added. 
</P>
<P>
And each Huipe guitar Boroff hears is better than the last, he said. "It's like 
he's hit a high point, and he keeps edging up." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hoover, manager of McCabe's Guitar Shop in Santa Monica, has witnessed the 
improvements in Huipe's instruments. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover recalled that when Huipe first brought his guitars to the shop to sell, 
"they were very nice-sounding, but they were crude." Under Hoover's guidance, 
Huipe was able to correct certain imperfections in his craftsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
"He would take my critique very well," Hoover said. "I've seen him come a long 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Huipe continued to work in his garage workshop for 15 years until his landlord 
evicted him. "He said it's (for a garage), not for a shop," Huipe said. "And he 
pushed me to open my own business." 
</P>
<P>
He opened his shop Jan. 1, 1989. There's not much to it: a handmade sign 
outside that says, "Benito Huipe, Handmade Guitars," a front room with a bare 
cement floor, a double rack of guitars in various stages of construction on one 
side, and others hung on the back wall. 
</P>
<P>
Flamenco music from a small, yellow cassette player fills the shop. Huipe 
always listens to flamenco or classical guitar music, much of it played on his 
own instruments, as he works. 
</P>
<P>
There is one metal folding chair, where Huipe sits as he holds a guitar and 
sands it, or rubs on shellac in a circular motion, a technique called French 
polishing. Hoover notes that this technique of hand-applying the finish gives 
the guitar a better sound, but makes it less desirable to many American 
consumers, who prefer a high-gloss sprayed finish. 
</P>
<P>
It takes Huipe approximately 80 hours to make a single guitar. He spreads the 
time over three or four months, working on several guitars at the same time, in 
order to give the glue and the eight coats of shellac time to dry between 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
His guitars sell for between $2,500 and $3,000, quite inexpensive in comparison 
to other hand-made guitars, which can cost up to $6,000 to $7,000. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Huipe's customers are musicians who are familiar with his work. 
</P>
<P>
"The customers who buy my guitars, they know my guitars. They saw some concert 
artist playing my guitar, and they call me and they make an appointment, and I 
make the guitar." 
</P>
<P>
His business has yet to become a full-time pursuit, however. He must still 
support himself by working as a waiter for banquets at the Beverly Regent 
Wilshire Hotel. The banquet schedule suits him, he says, because he can work at 
his shop during the day and wait tables at night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's convenient. And also, the hotel gives me a chance to buy better wood. I 
make money there, and then I buy nice wood, the best wood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He has a lot of orders for guitars these days, and thinks he will stay at the 
hotel for only one more year. He has a backlog of orders and a finished guitar 
doesn't stay in his shop long. 
</P>
<P>
Beautiful as his guitars are, Huipe doesn't feel comfortable with the title of 
artist. "I'm not really an artist. It makes me feel fancy when you say that," 
he said.

AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: THE DISCOURSE IS MEANT TO PROBE DEEPLY INTO THE PUBLIC 
PSYCHE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the past five Wednesdays, more than 60 of Glendale's most influential 
citizens have met in small groups in private residences to talk about sensitive 
public concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Their topics are gangs and drugs, home ownership, diversity in the workplace, 
cultural diversity and the all-inclusive, "Change -- Should We or Shouldn't 
We?" 
</P>
<P>
Among them are all five members of the City Council, several trustees and 
employees of the school and college districts, businessmen and financiers, 
developers, a judge and the publishers of a newspaper and a magazine. Balancing 
out the group is a diverse selection of Glendale's population, including 
students, housewives and blue-collar workers. 
</P>
<P>
The discourse is meant to probe deeply into the public psyche. Each evening's 
focus is guided by a list of written questions, such as: 
</P>
<P>
"What changes have you noticed in Glendale as a result of the dwindling white 
population? 
</P>
<P>
"What steps do you think the city of Glendale ought to take to address this 
issue?" and 
</P>
<P>
"What are the images you believe U.S. residents have of Hispanics, blacks, 
Mideasterners, Japanese, Koreans, Filipinos, Jews and Anglos?" 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the responses of the city's leadership will be known only to the 
68 people invited to the exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically excluded from the sessions were working reporters who might convey 
to their readers any small insight into the private thinking of the city's 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second year of what is to be an annual forum called "Understanding 
Glendale for the Future." 
</P>
<P>
It is put together jointly by the city, Glendale Community College and a 
business group called Glendale Partners. 
</P>
<P>
Following last year's pattern, for the benefit of the press, as they say, there 
was a three-hour opening session with suitable fanfare and speeches before the 
participants went behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
The rationale for this secrecy -- or, more graciously, privacy -- was to avoid 
any impediment to the expression of ideas that might be delicate, embarrassing 
or antagonistic, said Martha Thayer, whose public relations firm organized the 
forum. 
</P>
<P>
A similar explanation was offered this summer when the Board of Education sent 
some community leaders on a retreat to devise a report on the mission of the 
schools. In that case, the professional facilitator hired to lead the meetings 
barred reporters from Glendale's hometown paper, the News Press. 
</P>
<P>
The paper screamed in print that the future of the schools was being molded 
secretly in violation of the Ralph M. Brown Act, the state's public meeting 
law. The school district relented and the meetings, in all their resplendent 
tedium, were opened. The jackals of the press were happy and the News Press 
declared its conquest an "editorial triumph." 
</P>
<P>
Those who represent the municipal/commercial complex are a degree more polished 
in their method. 
</P>
<P>
In subtle ways, the current forum deflects any application of the Brown Act -- 
no two council members being assigned to the same group and the product being 
only free discussion, rather than a report. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the hosts invited the publisher of the News Press, Judee Kendall, into 
their circle. The publication raised no eyebrow this time. 
</P>
<P>
It's a shame, because the conversations that are going on would undoubtedly be 
interesting and instructive for the rest of the city. I'd like to hear what a 
councilman thinks should be done about the dwindling white population. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those in the discussion groups, by the way, have chosen to talk about 
their experiences. They uniformly found them constructive. 
</P>
<P>
One, 15-year-old Jessica Billingslea, a student at Glendale High School, said 
she made the heavy commitment of time for one reason: to help improve the image 
of her city. 
</P>
<P>
Being half-black and half-white, she said, she has grown weary of outsiders 
telling her, "Oh, I feel so sorry for you," when they learn she's a resident of 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to join this group because really it's not like that anymore," she 
said, before equivocating slightly. "Actually it is, but maybe we can do 
something about that, show that we are trying to do something. I would just 
like people to know. You want to be proud of your city." 
</P>
<P>
She and others said there were some tense conversations and considerable 
disagreement over questions of public transit and taxation. There have also 
been notable triumphs over ignorance. The city fathers are now informed, for 
example, that the term Mideasterners does not apply to the town's largest 
ethnic group, Armenians. 
</P>
<P>
It shouldn't take a Brown Act to spread such things. The Glendale stereotype 
that may well be last to die casts its power elite as a club that reaches all 
important decisions in private. That subject should be added to next year's 
agenda and reporters should be invited by right, whatever the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Jackals that we are, we would probably skip most of the meetings and report 
much out of context with an unpredictable margin of error. 
</P>
<P>
We would intimidate some and stir others to excess. 
</P>
<P>
But we would also spot a few more of the Jessica Billingsleas in Glendale's 
future.

AFTER-SCHOOL CHILD-CARE PROGRAM HAS 60 ENROLLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Montara Avenue Elementary School is offering an after-school child-care program 
through the South Gate Parks and Recreation Department. 
</P>
<P>
About 60 children in kindergarten through sixth grade are enrolled in the 
program, and an average of 20 participate each week, Principal Dan Basalone 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Activities for the children include physical education, library, arts, crafts 
and snack time. 
</P>
<P>
The program runs from 2:43 to 6 p.m. weekdays and serves mainly students from 
Montara Elementary School, plus children from other nearby schools. 
</P>
<P>
The effect on the children has been noticeable, Basalone said. "Children are 
completing homework assignments because they have an hour to do it in the 
library and someone to help them." 
</P>
<P>
Parents also have been favorable toward the program, Basalone said. "For $15 a 
week, they get 17 1/2 hours of child care, which breaks down to less than $1 an 
hour," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The enrollment fee is $5 per child. Weekly rates are $15 for the first child in 
a family, $12 for the second child, and $10 for each additional child.

SCHOOLS REPORT RECORD INCREASE OF 2,940 STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
School administrators expected more students this year -- but not this many. 
</P>
<P>
With a record increase of 2,940 students, the Long Beach Unified School 
District enrolled 71,476 students through the end of the first month of this 
academic year. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators were expecting an increase of about 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the largest one-year enrollment increase in the history of the school 
district," spokesman Dick Van Der Laan said this week. "Right now, we're OK. 
But if next year we get the same increase, we would be at capacity at all of 
our schools." 
</P>
<P>
The number of students peaked in 1963, when enrollment reached 74,564. The 
lowest was in 1979, when it hit 55,263. It has been steadily increasing ever 
since. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, most of the growth has been in the elementary schools. This 
year, the elementary schools enrolled 37,726 students, the highest in the 
district's history.

REMODELED BREAKERS WILL REOPEN AS SENIOR HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Breakers, formerly a well-known resort hotel in downtown Long Beach, is 
reopening this weekend as an apartment house for senior citizens after being 
closed two years for renovation. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1925, the oceanfront building served as one of the city's most popular 
and elegant hotels and remains an important architectural landmark. 
</P>
<P>
The financial failure of the hotel in 1988 raised the fears of historical 
preservationists that the building, at 249 E. Ocean Blvd., would be demolished. 
Instead, a company called Senior Living Communities, a Long Beach-based 
subsidiary of Shamrock Holdings Co., undertook extensive interior and exterior 
renovations to create what the developer now touts as a "highly specialized 
environment designed to accommodate the lifestyles of today's active and 
independent seniors." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the building -- which the developer says has been restored 
to its original historic condition -- features a large lobby with a grand 
piano, an elegant dining room, library, mail and information center, beauty and 
barber shop, private guest dining room, ballroom, and areas for meetings, games 
and crafts.

KELLOGG TO SEEK REPEAL OF LOW-INCOME HOUSING LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Councilman Jeffrey Kellogg said he will ask for repeal of Long Beach's 
controversial new low-income housing ordinance Tuesday, when the City Council 
is expected to review several amendments to the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Kellogg, citing a recent court ruling in San Francisco, said he believes that 
the ordinance is not legal and that it is not "achieving its goals of promoting 
more housing." 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "one-for-one" ordinance requires developers to pay fees to the 
city or replace low-income units that they demolish or convert to condominiums. 
The law is a cornerstone to the city's attempt to preserve housing for 
low-income tenants. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance's hefty replacement fees provoked an outcry from developers after 
the law went into effect last February. "It has stopped recycling of 
dilapidated property and development in the city," said Rich Johnson, spokesman 
for the Long Beach Board of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Planning Director Robert Paternoster said the ordinance has been "very 
successful" in preserving low-income housing units. However, Paternoster said 
he and the city attorney are concerned about the "viability" of the law because 
of a recent decision that overturned a similar measure in San Francisco. In 
that case, a state appellate court ruled that the city could not charge the 
owner of a residential hotel fees for turning his building into a tourist 
hotel.

TEXTBOOKS SENT TO ETHIOPIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An organization of Ethiopians living in Los Angeles has begun shipping 100,000 
surplus textbooks to schools in their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
The books were collected from Southern California schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Famine and 30 years of war continue to ravage Ethiopia," said Bogaletch Gebre, 
a spokeswoman for Parents International Ethiopia, the Santa Monica-based 
organization sending the books. 
</P>
<P>
Gebre said she hopes that the books will curtail the "book famine" that is 
chronic in Ethiopia and the rest of Africa. The books were donated by the Los 
Angeles and Santa Monica unified school districts, UCLA, and several area 
residents. The shipment is funded by the Illuminated Nations Operations Fund of 
the Tides Foundation. For information and to make donations, call (213) 
453-5690.

FIRM FINED FOR DUMPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Puroflow Corp. last week entered a plea of no contest to charges of illegally 
pouring acid wastes down a sewer drain in March, 1989, City Atty. Robert M. 
Myers announced. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Municipal Court Judge Rex Minter imposed a fine, penalties and 
restitution totaling $67,000 and placed the company on three years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
Myers said the case reaffirms the importance of handling hazardous waste 
properly to protect ground water and public health. "Violators will be 
aggressively prosecuted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Puroflow, at 1631 10th Street, manufactures water and fuel filters and valves 
for domestic, commercial and aerospace applications. 
</P>
<P>
City officials discovered the illegal dumping after installing monitoring 
devices in the sewer main next to Puroflow and in Puroflow's feeder lines. The 
devices detected acidic discharges in violation of the state Hazardous Waste 
Control Act, they said.

LOCAL ELECTIONS: RENT CONTROL BOARD; 
</P>
<P>
TENANTS' SLATE HOLDS UPPER HAND; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MONICA: THE FATE OF TWO COMPETING RENT CONTROL PROPOSITIONS, HOWEVER, IS 
STILL UNCLEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In the decade since rent control was imposed in Santa Monica, no one has ever 
been elected or appointed to the city's Rent Control Board who was not 
associated with the powerful tenant political group Santa Monicans for Renters' 
Rights. 
</P>
<P>
And although there is some question whether tenants will back an SMRR-supported 
ballot measure or a competing one sponsored by landlords, there seems little 
doubt that the tradition of an all-SMRR rent board will continue after the Nov. 
6 city election. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be some confusion out there among tenants about the ballot measures, 
but I believe they realize that SMRR is still their best bet to protect 
affordable housing and tenants' interests on the board," said Jay Johnson, an 
SMRR member who was appointed to the board earlier this year and is now seeking 
election to a full four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
The challengers to SMRR's slate of four candidates acknowledge that they face 
an uphill battle in stopping the tenants group's winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
"People have told me I can't win without the SMRR endorsement, but I'll give it 
my best shot," said Barbara Miller, a tenant who is running an independent 
campaign after failing to receive the organization's endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a resignation last year, four of the five seats on the board are up 
for election. Six candidates are competing for the three full four-year terms. 
A separate election to fill the last two years of an unexpired term has drawn 
two candidates. 
</P>
<P>
For the full-term seats, SMRR has endorsed incumbent Johnson, an apparel sales 
representative; Suzanne Abrescia, a child development specialist, and Lisa Monk 
Borrino, a tenant attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Landlord Ed Simonian, a chemical engineering firm manager, and two tenants, law 
school student Robert Madok and Miller, a certified shorthand reporter, are the 
other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates for the two-year term are Robert Niemann, a substitute math 
teacher who has been endorsed by SMRR, and James L. Jacobson, a property 
management consultant who ran unsuccessfully for the board in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The four candidates with the SMRR endorsement are running coordinated 
campaigns. Rent board Commissioner Dolores Press is serving as campaign 
chairwoman for all four, and David Borrino, a Santa Monica deputy city attorney 
and husband of Lisa Monk Borrino, is their campaign treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
Simonian, Madok and Jacobson have formed a loose alliance to challenge the SMRR 
slate. Miller is running independently. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than personalities, the campaign up to now has focused on the 
candidates' support or opposition to two ballot measures: Proposition U, backed 
by landlords, and Proposition W, which SMRR supports. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition U would remove the provision of Santa Monica's rent control laws 
that rankles landlords the most: the section that maintains rent control even 
when a tenant vacates an apartment voluntarily. If Proposition U is adopted, 
landlords would be able to raise rents to whatever level the market will bear 
when voluntary vacancies occur. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition W, a competing measure placed on the ballot by the City Council at 
SMRR's request, would allow rents on voluntarily vacated apartments to rise to 
specific higher levels based on the number of bedrooms. The rents allowed by 
Proposition W would be significantly higher than what is now permitted in many 
cases, but still well below free-market levels. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, all four candidates on the SMRR slate oppose Proposition U and 
support Proposition W. Simonian, Madok and Jacobson all favor Proposition U and 
oppose Proposition W. Independent candidate Miller opposes both measures, 
saying that Proposition U would bring about the end of rent control in the 
city, and that Proposition W doesn't provide adequate protection from landlord 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
In the campaign for the ballot measures, both sides have been using scare 
tactics. Tenant advocates say that if Proposition U passes it will mean the end 
of affordable housing in Santa Monica, and landlords predict that if it doesn't 
pass more landlords will go out of business under the state Ellis Act. 
</P>
<P>
The Ellis Act, adopted in 1986, allows landlords to legally evict tenants and 
go out of business, provided they give adequate notice and pay relocation fees. 
Owners of more than 1,100 units have notified city officials of their intent to 
evict tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the candidates -- one from each slate -- have had personal experience 
with the Ellis Act. Abrescia was evicted from her apartment under Ellis three 
years ago, and Madok is now under the threat of an Ellis eviction. 
</P>
<P>
Madok said his situation is evidence that landlords need relief provided by 
Proposition U, while Abrescia said her experience reinforced her belief that 
tenants still need the protection of rent control. 
</P>
<P>
The SMRR candidates say they would bring with them a new spirit of cooperation 
with landlords, but at least one opposing candidate is skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"They would be a duplicate of the existing board," said Simonian. 
</P>
<P>
Following are brief backgrounds on each of the candidates, in the same order as 
on the ballot: 
</P>
<P>
Jay P. Johnson, 47, was appointed to the rent board to replace Julie Lopez Dad 
in March as a compromise candidate after a split board could not agree on 
several other candidates. Johnson is a landlord, but has been active in SMRR, 
including sitting as a member of SMRR's steering committee. He said he believes 
there needs to be better "integration and coordination" between the rent board, 
City Council, Planning Commission and the office of community and economic 
development over housing issues. "We have to protect the rental housing stock," 
he said. According to the financial statement he filed with the city clerk, 
Johnson has raised $1,210 for his campaign -- including a $300 personal loan -- 
and spent only $257. However, he and the three other SMRR candidates enjoy the 
benefits of more than $160,000 raised by the group for slate literature and 
phone banks. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Simonian, 51, owns two buildings with a total of nine units. Only his 
six-unit building is under rent control. Simonian says he supports rent 
control, but says the law should be applied in a more balanced way toward 
landlords. He supports Proposition U, but says that he and other small-scale 
landlords will be slow to benefit from it because the turnover rate is 
extremely low for rent-controlled apartments. Nonetheless, he says, the passage 
of the measure will have a "psychological effect of giving (landlords) hope." 
He said disputes should be handled through mediation to avoid clogging up the 
courts and that landlords and tenants should be allowed to negotiate rent 
increase and pass-through costs. Simonian raised $1,275 and had not spent any 
of it as of Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Abrescia, 40, has been involved in tenant organizing for several years 
and formed a support group three years for tenants like herself who were 
evicted under the Ellis Act. "I feel there is a need for rent control as long 
as there are abuses in rent control," she said. Abrescia considered a run for 
the board in 1988 but decided not to after other candidates whose views she 
shared entered the race. She is part of a group of slow-growth advocates within 
SMRR, a group that has become increasingly outspoken in recent months amid 
mounting criticism of some pro-development votes cast by SMRR members on the 
City Council. Abrescia has raised $908 and spent $351, according to her 
campaign statement, but most of her campaign is being waged as part of the SMRR 
slate. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Monk Borrino, 35, says she has defended more than 200 evictions in Santa 
Monica, West Hollywood and Los Angeles as a tenant attorney for five years. 
Borrino said that without rent control, monthly rents would rise to the levels 
found in Marina del Rey, where rent control was removed five years ago. She 
said she would work to improve the relationship between the board and 
landlords. "I think landlords have to be treated with respect," she said. "I 
don't have a 'them-versus-us' attitude." Borrino, part of the SMRR slate, has 
raised $1,340 and spent just $32 for her individual campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Miller, 46, said she decided to run for the rent board after fighting 
off two eviction attempts by her landlord. "I want to help prevent others from 
undergoing the constant stress and pressure these proceedings cause," she said. 
She opposes any changes to the current rent control law and is alone among the 
candidates in opposing both propositions U and W. Miller, who is endorsed by 
current board member Wayne Bauer, says the board needs an independent candidate 
such as herself who "doesn't owe anything to anyone else." Miller filed a 
statement saying she did not intend to raise or spend more than $1,000 during 
the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Madok, 26, is a law student at USC who has lived in Santa Monica for 
less than three years. He said he favors Proposition U over Proposition W 
because it would protect current tenants from rent increases while offering 
landlords enough of an incentive to stay in business. He says the board must 
also be more consistent in dealing with rent increases and decreases. Based on 
his dealings with other tenants in his building, he says he believes most 
tenants are willing to pay a little more in rent to keep their apartments. 
Madok filed a statement saying he did not intend to raise or spend more than 
$1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Niemann, 50, is a half-owner of a four-unit apartment building in Santa 
Monica. He was involved in bringing rent control to Santa Monica in 1979 even 
though he was living in Venice at the time. As part of the SMRR slate, Niemann 
supports establishing a fund to subsidize rent increases for low-income 
tenants. Niemann also advocates a better relationship with landlords. "Maybe by 
being less confrontational, landlords will come to the conclusion that 
apartments are still a good investment if they stay in it for the long haul," 
he said. Niemann raised $1,390 and spent $204. 
</P>
<P>
James L. Jacobson, 38, is a tenant but works for landlords dealing with the 
rent board. Jacobson says his eight years of dealing with the board and rent 
control regulations make him the most qualified candidate for the job and would 
allow him to bring a sense of history to the board. He says landlords, 
particularly the small owners, need relief and need to be treated fairly and 
with respect by the rent board if they are to stay in business. "I have come to 
the conclusion that if the law was fairly applied, it would not be a system 
that apartment owners would love, but it would be one they could live with," he 
said. Jacobson is promoting a 10-point proposal, including rent adjustments 
based upon percentages rather than set dollar amounts. Jacobson reported 
raising $2,280 and spending $446.

ASSEMBLY: 41ST DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Questionnaires were distributed to candidates this month. Answers have been 
edited to fit the available space. 
</P>
<P>
Family Sick Leave 
</P>
<P>
Q. Gov. Deukmejian recently vetoed legislation that would have granted workers 
as much as four months of unpaid leave every two years to care for sick 
children, spouses and other family members without fear of losing their jobs. 
Do you favor this type of legislation? 
</P>
<P>
Nolan: This is not a matter for government intrusion. It should be a matter of 
negotiations between labor and management. 
</P>
<P>
Mann: Yes. Women are primarily responsible for the care of children, the 
elderly and other family members. Women cannot have a chance for decent jobs to 
support their families without such protection. 
</P>
<P>
Teacher Salaries 
</P>
<P>
Q. The Legislature approved a 4.7% cost-of-living raise for school employees, 
and Gov. Deukmejian reduced it to 3%, placing the difference in an account for 
special education programs. Should this money be used for salaries? 
</P>
<P>
Nolan: California's children suffer from the largest class size in the nation. 
It is imperative that we begin to bring down the size of our classes. The 
governor proposed a modest 0.8% of the education budget be used to lower the 
student to teacher ratio. I supported this reasonable proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Mann: Yes. Schoolchildren and their teachers should not be held hostages to the 
internecine war between the governor and the Legislature. The educational needs 
of children in special education programs should not be pitted against their 
teachers' needs for a decent salary to support their families. 
</P>
<P>
Big Green 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 128, the so-called "Big Green" initiative on the November 
ballot, seeks to eliminate ozone-depleting chemicals by the year 2000, phase 
out pesticides known to cause cancer and require that trees be planted in all 
new developments. Do you support this initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Nolan: No. It makes no sense to add more layers of governmental approval and 
bureaucracy to our already huge state government. It makes even less sense to 
allow Tom Hayden to create a powerful new political position from which to 
impose his discredited philosophy. Proposition 128 won't really help clean up 
the environment, but it will create a regulatory nightmare for people. 
</P>
<P>
Mann: Yes. We must stop poisoning the air we breathe, the water we drink and 
the food we eat. Our wanton destruction of the environment has threatened our 
very survival. 
</P>
<P>
Tree-Cutting 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 130 on the November ballot would restrict clear-cutting of 
forests, allow the sale of $710 million in bonds to preserve ancient redwood 
forests and provide $32 million to retrain unemployed loggers. Do you support 
this initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Nolan: No. 
</P>
<P>
Mann: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Limited Terms 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 131 on the November ballot, authored by Atty. Gen. John K. Van 
de Kamp and Common Cause, would limit most statewide elected officials to eight 
consecutive years in office, and senators and Assembly members to 12 years. 
Proposition 140, sponsored by Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum, is 
more stringent, limiting lifetime service to eight years in the Senate and six 
in the Assembly. Do you support limiting the number of terms state legislators 
can serve? If yes, how long should the limits be? 
</P>
<P>
Nolan: Yes. The Founders of our Republic never intended for the legislative 
branch of our government to be a permanent, ruling oligarchy. I support 
Proposition 140 because it would force a regular turnover in the state 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Mann: Yes. I support the consecutive term limits of eight and 12 years in 
Proposition 131. The present system is not responsive to the voters. It is time 
for new, clean leadership which will be responsive to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Sales Tax 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 133 on the November ballot would raise state sales and use taxes 
by 0.5% for four years to raise $7.5 billion for drug enforcement and 
treatment, anti-drug education, and prison and jail construction and operation. 
Do you support this initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Nolan: No. 
</P>
<P>
Mann: No. 
</P>
<P>
Liquor Tax 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 134 on the November ballot would substantially raise taxes on 
beer, wine and liquor, and dedicate the revenue from the tax hike to programs 
for the treatment of drug and alcohol abuse. Do you support this initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Nolan: No. 
</P>
<P>
Mann: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Inmate Laborers 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 139 on the November ballot would allow private companies to hire 
state prison and county jail inmates as laborers. Do you support this 
initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Nolan: No. 
</P>
<P>
Mann: No position. 
</P>
<P>
Death Penalty 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support capital punishment? If so, do you think it should be imposed 
on those convicted of importing or selling drugs? 
</P>
<P>
Nolan: Yes on both. 
</P>
<P>
Mann: No. 
</P>
<P>
Handgun Controls 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support additional limits on handgun purchase or possession in 
California? 
</P>
<P>
Nolan: No. 
</P>
<P>
Mann: Yes. There is no place in the urban home for handguns. Hundreds of 
children and young people are murdered each year in California because of the 
presence of handguns in their homes and the homes of their friends. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion Rights 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support a woman's right to unrestricted abortions within the first 
three months of pregnancy? 
</P>
<P>
Nolan: No. 
</P>
<P>
Mann: Yes. Keep the government out of our bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion Funding 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support government funding of abortions for women who cannot afford 
them? 
</P>
<P>
Nolan: No. 
</P>
<P>
Mann: Yes. Abortions should be funded on the same basis as any other medical 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Day-Care Services 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you believe the state should require private employers to subsidize 
day-care services for employees who request them? 
</P>
<P>
Nolan: No. This is a matter to be negotiated between labor and management. 
</P>
<P>
Mann: No. Day-care services ought not to be required by the government. They 
should be provided by the government or supported by tax credits as one among 
many benefits, such as health care, made available to employees. 
</P>
<P>
War on Drugs 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you believe our present strategy of criminal prosecution, interdiction of 
supplies and imprisonment of users and dealers will ever significantly reduce 
the level of drug use in the United States? If no, what should be done? 
</P>
<P>
Nolan: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Mann: No. As long as there is a demand, there will be a supply. We must 
convince our young people that drugs are death. 
</P>
<P>
Drug Decriminalization 
</P>
<P>
Q. Would you consider supporting the decriminalization of drug use? 
</P>
<P>
Nolan: No. 
</P>
<P>
Mann: No. 
</P>
<P>
Oil Exploration 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think the present Mideast crisis justifies opening up additional 
parts of the California coastline to oil exploration? 
</P>
<P>
Nolan: I think we need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. 
</P>
<P>
Mann: No. The California coastline is a priceless part of our heritage that 
must be preserved. We must become less dependent upon foreign oil through 
energy-efficient automobiles, mass transit systems such as light rail, and 
development of alternative energy sources. 
</P>
<P>
Parkland Exchange 
</P>
<P>
Q. Should the National Park Service exchange 50 acres in Cheeseboro Canyon in 
southeastern Ventura County for about 1,100 acres of the neighboring Jordan 
Ranch owned by entertainer Bob Hope, permitting park agencies to buy another 
4,600 acres of Hope's land in the Santa Monica and Santa Susana mountains for 
$10 million? 
</P>
<P>
Nolan: This land is completely across the country from my district and does not 
affect my constituents. 
</P>
<P>
Mann: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Mandatory Ride-Sharing 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you favor mandatory ride-sharing in an effort to meet government air 
pollution standards? 
</P>
<P>
Nolan: No. I support voluntary programs. 
</P>
<P>
Mann: No. I favor aggressive requirements that employers meet ride-sharing 
standards. I do not support mandatory ride-sharing for individuals because I 
believe that it is unenforceable. 
</P>
<P>
Political Funding 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support full or partial public funding of political campaigns? 
</P>
<P>
Nolan: No. Tax money should be used for essential services -- not political 
rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
Mann: Yes. I support either full or partial public funding of political 
campaigns. Under the present system, it is virtually impossible to unseat an 
incumbent. The voice of the people too often goes unheeded and the door is 
opened to special-interest groups, such as savings and loans. Ninety-eight 
percent of all incumbents in the state Legislature and in Congress were 
reelected in California in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Income Disclosure 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are you willing to publicly release your income tax returns and those of 
your spouse prior to the November election? 
</P>
<P>
Nolan: No. 
</P>
<P>
Mann: Yes. They are better than Sominex. 
</P>
<P>
Porter Ranch 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support development of the massive Porter Ranch project in the hills 
north of Chatsworth as presently configured? 
</P>
<P>
Nolan: This development is far from my district and does not affect my 
constituents. 
</P>
<P>
Mann: This is a decision best left to the residents of the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

GLENDALE-MUIR GAME FIGURES TO DECIDE TITLE

<P>
The game the Glendale High football team has been waiting for all season is 
here. 
</P>
<P>
The unbeaten Dynamiters (7-0, 2-0 in Pacific League play), ranked eighth in the 
Southern Section Division II, will play ninth-ranked Muir (5-2, 2-0) Friday 
night at Glendale in a game that should decide the league championship. 
</P>
<P>
"They probably have five or six people that are Division I prospects," Glendale 
Coach Don Shoemaker said of the Mustangs, who were Division II co-champions 
last season. "We have maybe three at best. Person for person, they're a better 
team than us. We're not fooling anybody. 
</P>
<P>
"Turnovers are going to be the key. If they don't turn the ball over, we're 
going to be in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Muir is led by quarterback Sedrick Thomas, who has passed for 1,015 yards and 
eight touchdowns. Thomas also is the Mustangs' leading rusher with 416 yards 
and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs, whose only losses were to powerful Fontana and Bishop Amat, also 
feature running back Saladin McCullough, who has gained 302 yards in 45 carries 
and scored eight touchdowns. Receiver Demetrice Martin has 11 receptions for 
304 yards and five touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Muir linebacker Damon Danecker has a team-high 66 tackles for a defensive unit 
that also features defensive backs Reggie Reser and Hassan McCullough. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale is led by running back Pathon Rucker, who has rushed for 1,183 yards 
and scored 23 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Showdown part II: Bobby Webster continues to lead Glendale College toward a 
Western State Conference Northern Division showdown with Moorpark in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale (4-2, 4-1 in WSC play) last week defeated winless Ventura (0-6, 0-5) 
as Webster rushed for 196 yards and scored three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale will play Compton (0-6, 0-5) this weekend, then at L.A. Harbor (4-2, 
3-2) on Nov. 3 before playing host to Moorpark (5-1, 4-1) on Nov. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale Coach John Cicuto hopes to diversify the offense this week in 
preparation for Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
"Our run game has been successful but we have to be able to throw the ball," 
Cicuto said. "A good team like Moorpark will load up on the run." 
</P>
<P>
Alive and kicking: The Occidental College women's soccer team (5-2-2) entered 
the week atop the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers have been led by senior forward Jos Bergmann, who had four goals in 
a 7-0 victory over Redlands and four more in a 7-0 win over La Verne in matches 
played last week. 
</P>
<P>
Bergmann has 25 goals and seven assists for the Tigers, who conclude their 
SCIAC schedule Saturday at Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
Trophy dash: The Occidental College and Glendale College cross-country teams 
are both preparing for their respective conference championship meets. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental will race in the SCIAC meet at Bonelli Park in San Dimas on Saturday 
and Glendale will run in the WSC finals at Moorpark College on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale, the WSC champion two of the past three seasons, won both WSC meets. 
The team champion will be determined by combining the results of the finals, 
which count double, and the two conference meets. 
</P>
<P>
Back to the bench: After a two-game run as the Detroit Lions' starting 
quarterback, former Hoover High and Glendale College standout Bob Gagliano will 
return to his accustomed role as a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Peete, who missed the Lions' last two games with a hamstring pull, has 
reclaimed his starting job from Gagliano, who is in his eighth season. 
</P>
<P>
Gagliano passed for 229 yards and two touchdowns in a 34-27 win over Minnesota 
on Oct. 7, but completed just eight of 17 passes for 156 yards and a touchdown 
in a 43-24 loss to Kansas City Oct. 14.

SEASON OF FIRSTS PUTS GLENDALE IN FRONT; 
</P>
<P>
UNDEFEATED DYNAMITERS AIMING AT PACIFIC LEAGUE, SOUTHERN SECTION TITLES AFTER 
IMPORTANT WIN 
</P>

<P>
Ninja Jorgensen does not mince words. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how the Glendale High girls' volleyball team has fared in the Pacific 
League over the years, Jorgensen gets straight to the point. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always been second in league," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale, however, might not play the bridesmaid to perennial league champion 
Arcadia this season. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Glendale traveled to Arcadia and defeated the Apaches in a 2 
1/2-hour, five-game match. The Dynamiter victory ended Arcadia's 10-year, 
83-match Pacific League victory streak. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was also the most dramatic moment of what Jorgensen and her team 
hope will continue to be a season of firsts. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale entered the week 10-0, 6-0 in Pacific League play and ranked third in 
the Southern Section 4-A Division poll -- the highest ranking in school 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale, which earlier this season won the 15-team Arcadia tournament for the 
first time, is seeking a share of its first Pacific League title since 1980 and 
its first Southern Section championship ever. 
</P>
<P>
The Dynamiters are led by senior middle hitter Cheryl DeCroupet, senior outside 
hitter Marisa Mora and junior setter Jennifer Dalton, perhaps the best 
all-around female athlete in the Glendale area. 
</P>
<P>
"They have complete hitters," Crescenta Valley Coach Barry Eget said. "They can 
hit lines, angles and put the ball wherever they want." 
</P>
<P>
Daphne Lee and twins Wendy and Darcy McDonald also have played solidly 
throughout the season. 
</P>
<P>
"Their setter says to their back-row people, 'Put the ball in the air and I'll 
do something with it,' and their hitters say to their setter, 'Put the ball in 
the air and we'll do something with it,' " Arcadia Coach Chuck Freberg said. 
"It's one thing to say that and another to be able to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"They have the ability to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for Glendale's success this season has been the influence of 
captains DeCroupet and Mora, both of whom have extensive experience at the club 
level. Arcadia, like all of the traditional volleyball powers in Southern 
California, has been fueled by the steady influx of experienced club players 
each season. 
</P>
<P>
"Club players play all year 'round and kids that play nine weeks are not going 
to beat them -- it doesn't matter how good they are," said Jorgensen, who was a 
middle blocker for the U.S. national team from 1965-73. "Volleyball is a game 
of experience." 
</P>
<P>
It's also a game of precise teamwork. And Glendale, which features four 
seniors, four juniors and one sophomore, has benefited from a roster full of 
players who are friends as well as teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, our team was divided," DeCroupet said. "This year, we have more 
unity. Everyone gets along off and on the court." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale's match against Arcadia illustrated the Dynamiters' new-found sense of 
togetherness. And confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale was ahead, 10-8, in the first game, but dropped seven consecutive 
points to fall behind, 1-0, in the match. 
</P>
<P>
Behind DeCroupet and Mora, the Dynamiters rebounded for a 15-5 victory in the 
second game. Arcadia led, 14-13, in the third game, and eventually won it on an 
illegal hit in the back row and a Mora spike attempt that went into the net. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, however, Glendale rallied. 
</P>
<P>
With Glendale trailing, 14-13, in the fourth game, Dalton served three 
consecutive points to extend the match to a fifth game. The Dynamiters came 
back from a 3-0 deficit to take a 13-9 lead on an ace by Wendy McDonald before 
winning the match on two Arcadia hitting errors. 
</P>
<P>
"We had one of our worst practices the day before and it showed in the match," 
Freberg said. "I think that got our players' attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we'll be a little tougher and aggressive when we go to their 
place." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale entered the week with Pacific League matches remaining against Muir, 
Crescenta Valley, Arcadia and Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
As the Dynamiters head toward another showdown with Arcadia in the unfamiliar 
position of league leader, Jorgensen is hopeful that at least one tradition 
holds true. 
</P>
<P>
"Against Arcadia, we usually do better the second time around," she said.

TEACHER TURNS STUDENT TO MAKE THE GRADE AS A RUNNER AT LBCC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dew glittered on the graceful contours of La Mirada Regional Park last Saturday 
morning as Patrick McKean, a Long Beach City College teacher, broke from the 
starting line as a member of the school's cross-country team. 
</P>
<P>
In his uniform of black shorts and a red tank top bearing the initials LBCC, he 
would run four miles, hopefully in 22 1/2 minutes, past pines, eucalyptuses, a 
shining lake and, to make the paradise complete, his proud father. 
</P>
<P>
McKean is in his second season with the Vikings, the only school athletic team 
he has ever made. "I made one bad attempt at C basketball," McKean said, 
recalling the disappointment he and his parents felt when he was 5 feet 4 and 
failed to make the 10th-grade team at Ventura High School. 
</P>
<P>
Now, at 5-10 and 140 pounds, he possesses the same lean frame as many of his 
teammates who are 15 years younger. He is 34, but his narrow face, accented by 
pale blue eyes and a prominent nose, is smooth, and the gray flecks in his dark 
hair are not easily noticed. 
</P>
<P>
This appearance and an easygoing nature allow McKean, though nicknamed 
"Teacher," to blend in with his teammates. "We don't consider him a teacher or 
an old person," sophomore Clarence Allums said as he and McKean stretched 
Saturday before the Cerritos College Invitational meet. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Tansley, another teammate who once had been a student in McKean's class, 
said, "I thought it was weird at first, having someone so old. But he's just 
one of the guys. He adds life to the team. He's kind of our leader, in a 
different way than a running leader. A lot of people ask him for advice." 
</P>
<P>
That is how McKean likes to be perceived. "They respect me for what I know, but 
I can also go out and run and shoot the bull with them," he said. "I try not to 
be the authority figure out there because I want to relax, too." 
</P>
<P>
He has driven the team van but prefers to let coaches do that. "If we have a 
flat tire they take care of it, I'm just a runner," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McKean, a USC graduate, has taught journalism since 1988 at the community 
college at Clark Avenue and Carson Street. He had been a copy editor at the 
Orange County Register and then, until it went out of business, at the Los 
Angeles Herald Examiner. 
</P>
<P>
When he arrived at Long Beach City College he was a veteran runner, having 
trained seriously since watching Carlos Lopes, 36, win the marathon in the 1984 
Olympics. Aware that distance runners tend to reach their prime in their 30s, 
McKean figured he was a candidate for the Viking cross-country and track teams. 
</P>
<P>
"And I hadn't used up my eligibility before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He called Viking Coach Ron Allice, whose principles include never cutting 
anyone who tries out. Allice assured McKean that other older runners, even some 
with full-time jobs, had been on the team in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Soon came the thrilling day when McKean received a school uniform for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"I was like a little kid," he said, the memory still fresh and exciting. "I 
thought, 'Wow, I made the team,' even though everybody in cross-country makes 
the team. I went up to my dad's (in Ventura) that weekend, showed the shorts, 
the shirt and the sweats off to him and my sister and three brothers. They were 
all proud. I was like, 'Gosh, I feel like sleeping in them.' " 
</P>
<P>
Any student is allowed to compete two seasons in a community college sport, and 
McKean had to become one again to be eligible. He takes the required 12 credits 
a semester, mostly in physical education, and also teaches newswriting and 
serves as faculty adviser for the student newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the toughest academic schedule, but it's legal and official," said 
McKean, who has straight A's. 
</P>
<P>
Each day at 3 p.m., his classes over, McKean practices with his teammates, 
trying to keep up with them. "He's totally involved," said Allice, who in 11 
seasons has eight state track titles, but none in cross-country. "He has a very 
positive influence on the guys. He's really a joy to have as part of the 
program." 
</P>
<P>
Under Allice and graduate assistant Tyrus Deminter, an All-American at the 
school in 1982-83, McKean has improved greatly. Before coming to Long Beach he 
had completed each of the first four Los Angeles Marathons in about 4 1/2 
hours. He ran the fifth in March in 3:26. 
</P>
<P>
Also last spring he finished eighth in the 10,000-meter run to record a point 
for the Viking track team in the South Coast Conference championship meet. "We 
won by 8 or 10 points and we joked that mine was the turning point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In cross-country, McKean can generally be found in the middle of the pack in 
weekly competition against the top runners in Southern California. He said 
opponents do not seem to mind passing someone almost old enough to be their 
father, nor do they complain when he passes them. 
</P>
<P>
"I've moved almost up to the top 50% of big (meets), usually about 70th out of 
135 runners," McKean said last Friday in his office at the school newspaper. 
"I'm hoping tomorrow, with a weaker field, that I will break into the top 50%." 
</P>
<P>
McKean has found team competition much more demanding than "huffing along" in 
5-Ks and 10-Ks in Downey and Cerritos. "There have been many times when I 
churned up a hill in 105-degree heat, chewing my teammates' dust, wondering why 
in the world I'm doing this," he said. "I could be in the air-conditioned 
office grading papers or out playing a leisurely round of golf." 
</P>
<P>
What has hooked him is team spirit. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the potential to be state champions," he said. "I'm glad to be 
ninth-string and part of that." 
</P>
<P>
The realization that his belated but brief college career is nearing an end 
seemed to sadden McKean. "I have tomorrow and next week (at the conference 
championships)," he said. "Then I'm going to run track next spring, and I'm 
hoping to qualify in the 10,000 in the state meet." 
</P>
<P>
The teacher got off to a good start in Saturday's race for runners eighth and 
lower on their teams. At the halfway mark, he and teammate Andy Dale noticed 
something unusual -- they could still see the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
But McKean soon started to tire and dropped to his customary position in the 
middle of the pack, if, with the small field, it could be called a pack. But he 
finished strong, sprinting up a little hill to the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
In a field of 26, he was 15th with a time of 23:36. He was still not in the top 
50% but he had bettered his time over the same course last year by 20 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Sweat glistened on him like the dew had on the grass. "I ran as hard as I 
could," he said. "My left foot kind of cramped. I dream of 22:30, but it's 
always tougher than it looks on Thursday." 
</P>
<P>
His father, Mack McKean, who had driven from Ventura and joined the few other 
spectators, shook his son's hand. As they stood there under a tree, the older 
man in his jeans and the runner in his cherished uniform, the disappointment 
both had felt so long ago when Mack's boy had been cut from the basketball team 
had vanished.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
CIVIL RIGHTS BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a vote of 273 to 154, the House approved the conference report on a bill (S 
2104) making it easier for minorities, women and others to seek redress in the 
courts against job discrimination. President Bush, who was opposed to the bill 
because it could lead employers to adopt personnel quotas, vetoed it Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Reversing Supreme Court decisions of recent years, the bill shifts to employers 
the burden of showing challenged personnel decisions were made out of business 
necessity rather than bias. Another key provision enables plaintiffs to collect 
punitive as well as compensatory damages if they win their suit. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles) called it "public relations, the 
big lie technique" to claim the bill would lead to personnel quotas. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Harris W. Fawell (R-Ill.) said: "Simply stating that this bill is not 
a quotas bill does not mean that it is not a quotas bill." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to approve the bill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Cut Interior Bill 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 167 to 234, the House rejected a proposed 4.6% cut in the fiscal 
1991 appropriations bill (HR 5769) for the Interior Department and related 
agencies. As later approved by the House, the bill costs about $11.9 billion, 
up 6% over the comparable 1990 bill. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.) said: "A modest 4.6% cut . . . is certainly 
warranted in these times of fiscal despair." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Ralph Regula (R-Ohio) said, "We have worked hard to keep the totals 
down" in the Appropriations Committee's crafting of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to cut the Interior appropriations bill by 4.6%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Covert Aid to Angola 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 175 to 246, the House rejected an amendment to end covert aid, 
reportedly $60 million this year, to the UNITA forces fighting the 
Soviet-backed Marxist government of Angola. The amendment stipulated that any 
continuation of the aid be openly requested by President Bush and publicly 
approved by Congress. The vote occurred as the House sent to the Senate a bill 
(HR 5422) funding the CIA and other government intelligence activities in 
fiscal 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"If it makes sense to provide aid . . . why should it not be dealt with in the 
open?" asked sponsor Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley). 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) said America is "committed to fighting 
Communist tyranny, whether it is in Afghanistan . . . Cambodia or . . . 
Angola." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to end covert aid to anti-Marxist rebels in Angola. 
</P>
<P>

SANTA MONICA OKS SCALED-DOWN OFFICE PROJECT; 
</P>
<P>
GROWTH: DEVELOPERS SAID IT COULDN'T GET A FAIR HEARING SO CLOSE TO ELECTION 
DAY. THE VOTE IS SEEN AS A TEST OF COUNCIL'S STANCE ON DEVELOPMENT. 
</P>

In a highly contentious hearing that put the Santa Monica City Council's 
development policies on the spot less than two weeks before the city election, 
the council early Wednesday scaled down a controversial five-story office 
project planned for the 2300 block of Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise decision reduced the size of the structure from a proposed 
101,000 square feet to about 85,000 square feet. It gave neighbors opposed to 
the project part of the substantial size reduction they sought, but it avoided 
shooting down two years of work by the the developer, HSM Group/Kennedy-Wilson 
Realty. 
</P>
<P>
After six hours of public comment and debate that extended Tuesday night's 
council meeting into the wee hours, the council voted 4 to 1 to scale down the 
project, whose principal tenant is to be Kennedy-Wilson, a real estate auction 
house. Councilman Ken Genser voted against the project because he said he 
wanted it reduced even more. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of Councilwoman Christine C. Reed during the hearing appeared to 
underscore the view expressed by some council members that the battle was a 
political one. Reed, the only incumbent seeking reelection Nov. 6, said earlier 
this month that she would abstain from voting on the project because she lives 
three blocks from it. 
</P>
<P>
Reed said such proximity could affect the value of her home, but some of her 
neighbors and several council members contended that Reed was abstaining in 
order to avoid casting a pro-development vote shortly before the election. 
</P>
<P>
Also abstaining was Councilman William H. Jennings, who lives a block away from 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
The approval of the project was disappointing to two community groups, Mid-City 
Neighbors and Save Our Neighborhood, who appealed the city Planning 
Commission's approval of the project in August on the grounds that the project 
should be bound by new, stricter zoning laws. 
</P>
<P>
"The council still does not listen to what residents want or need," Kelly 
Olsen, a spokesman for Mid-City Neighbors and a candidate for the City Council, 
said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
HSM Group/Kennedy-Wilson Realty representatives were not pleased either. They 
argued that the project could not get a fair shake in the shadow of the Nov. 6 
election, in which three council seats are being contested and development is a 
major issue. 
</P>
<P>
The approval gives the developer the option to build up to four stories, 
provided the top floor is a "step" that fronts Wilshire. The building site is 
now occupied by a carwash. 
</P>
<P>
Residents had sought a three-story structure, arguing that a larger project 
would generate too much traffic. The developers said they needed a four-story 
structure to accommodate their needs for office space. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen presented documents suggesting that the city allowed the project to move 
forward in 1988 under older, more liberal development standards, and indicating 
it should have been examined under the stricter rules now in effect. He said 
the project's plans were required to be "deemed complete" on April 29, 1988, in 
order to take advantage of the old rules. Plans for the project came in to the 
city that day, but because of some missing documents, residents argued that 
they were not, in fact, complete. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Robert M. Myers disagreed, saying that the plans submitted by 
Kennedy-Wilson were substantially complete on the date in question and that the 
developer had been allowed to invest in planning the project for two years 
under that presumption. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher M. Harding, attorney for the developer, argued unsuccessfully that 
the council delay its decision until after the election because he feared his 
client would not get fair consideration. He noted that some opponents were 
calling for the vote on this project to be a test of the council's stance on 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Council members rejected his request, noting that none of the members voting on 
the matter are running next month.

Consultants -- A new rule approved by the Pasadena Board of Directors on 
environmental impact reports for proposed developments was reported incorrectly 
Sunday. Rather than having developers choose consultants from a city list, the 
new rule requires the city to contract directly with the consultants, with the 
developer reimbursing the city.

ASTRONOMERS STAR-STRUCK OVER DISCOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Astronomers have discovered what may be the largest galaxy in the known 
universe, a mammoth cluster of stars that stretches for 6 million light years 
-- more than 60 times the size of the Milky Way, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The giant object is located in the heart of a cluster of galaxies known as 
Abell 2029, a team of astronomers reported in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
The object is 1 billion light years from Earth -- that is, the distance light 
travels in 1 billion years at a speed of 186,000 miles per second. 
</P>
<P>
Using a 36-inch telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona, 
astronomers Juan Uson of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Stephen 
Boughn of Haverford College and Jeffrey Kuhn of Michigan State University were 
able to detect a "halo" of diffuse light surrounding a massive galaxy at the 
center of Abell 2029. 
</P>
<P>
A mosaic of 16 images made with light-sensitive electronic "chips" showed the 
diffuse halo to be remarkably uniform, leading the astronomers to conclude they 
were looking at a single galaxy, the largest ever discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Measurements indicate that the galaxy has a diameter of 6 million light years, 
more than 4 1/2 times the diameter of the previous record holder and 60 times 
wider than Earth's Milky Way, which has a diameter of about 100,000 light 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists believe that they are seeing a giant galaxy primarily because 
the halo's light spreads very smoothly outward from the central galaxy and 
because the halo has the same elliptical shape as the central galaxy. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite simply, the central galaxy is indistinguishable from the diffuse light 
that extends . . . from the cluster center," they said. "Thus, this object is 
among the largest and most luminous galaxies observed." 
</P>
<P>
The galaxy shines with 2 trillion times the light produced by Earth's sun and 
is elliptical in shape. About 26% of the light given off by the galactic 
cluster is contributed by this one galaxy. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an organized mass of light and energy," Kuhn said in a news release. 
"It's a very large, organized galaxy."

British scientists today celebrated what they believe to be a breakthrough in 
the elusive quest for a cure for baldness -- test-tube hair. 
</P>
<P>
A team of scientists at Cambridge University announced that they had cleared a 
main obstacle to the development of an anti-baldness drug by growing human hair 
in a test-tube. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a real breakthrough," Terence Kealey, head of the research team, told 
a reporter. "No one has ever managed to grow hair in a laboratory before." 
</P>
<P>
The idea is not to grow a replacement head of hair in the laboratory but to 
allow effective testing of potential baldness cures on single human hairs. 
</P>
<P>
Kealey says the discovery makes the development of a cure for the age-old 
problem of hair loss just a matter of time.

Three foot-tall sculptures of nude women on display at City Hall are being 
covered with fake fig leaves because a bureaucrat believed that they were too 
shocking. 
</P>
<P>
Lubbock artist Future Akins says the city's reaction to his work, titled 
"Getting Better Ain't Always Easy," was "silly and kind of sad." 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see in my wildest imagination how these pieces would be offensive to 
anybody," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yvonne Washington, assistant director of the city's Park and Recreation 
Department, said that she had received no complaints about the art but that 
"there may be some questions raised" by residents about the figures. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there was possibly too much shock value," Washington said. "I'm trying 
to be sensitive to the whole community."

'COLD FUSION' SCIENTISTS CLASH WITH PANEL 
</P>

<P>
State officials prepared to review the controversial "cold fusion" research 
program today as one of the two scientists involved said angrily that he would 
miss the meeting because he learned of it only hours before and the other said 
he would skip it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm infuriated," said Martin Fleischmann, a scientist at the National Cold 
Fusion Institute at the University of Utah. "They have known for ages that we 
would not be available in October." Fleischmann spoke from his native England, 
where he is receiving medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The angry accusation from Fleischmann, which the university quickly denied, 
came hours after the other scientist involved in the research, B. Stanley Pons, 
requested a one-year sabbatical leave in a fax transmission from his attorney, 
University of Utah President Chase Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
The state's nine-member Fusion Energy Advisory Council is reviewing the 
scientists' disputed work and was scheduled to discuss renewed funds at the 
meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
Pons had been scheduled to address the panel; university officials said they 
had tried unsuccessfully to notify Fleischmann. 
</P>
<P>
Curtailing financing is a possibility, said Randy Moon, the state's science 
adviser and a member of the council. The institute was founded in part with a 
$5-million state grant. 
</P>
<P>
"Stan owes it to a lot of people to be able to report on his results," Moon 
said. "A lot of people at the university have been counting on Pons to show the 
research is viable." 
</P>
<P>
Pons and Fleischmann set the scientific world on its ear in March, 1989, when 
they announced they had achieved a nuclear fusion reaction in a jar at room 
temperature. Many scientists have been unable to duplicate their work and have 
disputed their claim. Some have suggested that it resulted from lab errors. 
</P>
<P>
C. Gary Triggs, an attorney for both scientists, said Pons planned to return to 
the university in a week or so. He said Pons was requesting the sabbatical 
because he was faced with too many distractions while defending the cold fusion 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way that is ever going to happen is when they have the time to 
dedicate to the science," he said. "Stan and Martin are scientists, not 
politicians."

TIRANA, Albania 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of neighboring Balkan states today gave only qualified support to 
Albania's taking part in European affairs, and Greece insisted that the 
isolated, hard-line Communist nation make human-rights reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Albania's chances of gaining international acceptance were further damaged 
today as its most famous author, Ismail Karare, defected. 
</P>
<P>
Karare announced that he would seek political asylum in France because, he 
said, there was "no possibility of legal opposition" in his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Word of Karare's defection reached Tirana just after the foreign ministers' 
meeting closed, and there was no immediate official Albanian reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Albania, hosting its first high-level international conference in decades, 
hopes to be invited to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, in 
Paris, in time for its summit session next month. 
</P>
<P>
But the Balkan foreign ministers, at their meeting here today, did not give a 
clear endorsement to Albania's participation in the summit.

A Continental Airlines jetliner with 85 people aboard made a safe emergency

Myers on Florida's Gulf Coast en route to Newark, N.J., and Boston when the 
wheel detached, said Arlene Salac of the Federal Aviation Administration in

"The right outer main gear wheel came off of the aircraft," she said. "There 
are two wheels on each gear, but one of them is what came off." 
</P>

The plane was diverted to Orlando International Airport and circled before 
landing at 1:36 p.m., said airport spokeswoman Linda Desrosiers. It landed 
without incident and the passengers were taken off by bus.

Britain said today it will reopen its embassy in Tehran on Sunday, with the

</P>
<P>
The Foreign Office said that a team of five diplomats, headed by First 
Secretary David Reddaway, would leave London on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Reddaway was at the embassy when Iran broke off relations with Britain 18 
months ago, after Tehran issued a "death sentence" against British author 
Salman Rushdie, whose novel, "The Satanic Verses," Iran said blasphemed Islam. 
</P>
<P>
Britain and Iran announced they would resume diplomatic relations after talks

GULF WAR FEAR HIKES OIL PRICE BY $3 A BARREL;

MARKET: TRADERS BELIEVE THAT THEY MAY HAVE OVERESTIMATED THE CHANCE OF A

Oil shot up more than $3 per barrel on the futures market today as speculators 
bet on war in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got all sorts of little talk in the market of troops being increased in 
the Middle East on our side and on Iraq's side," said Brian Tagler, a broker at 
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. "Once again, the market is worried about 
confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
Light sweet crude oil jumped $3.02 to $34.10 per barrel for December delivery 
contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange shortly after noon. January and 
February delivery contracts were up $2 per barrel and later months were all up 
by more than $1. 
</P>
<P>
Today's early trading was a continuation of crude's rise of $1.71 per barrel on 
Wednesday. That upward surge halted a sharp slide that had knocked oil from 
above $40 per barrel to less than $30 as traders responded to hints of a 
peaceful resolution to the gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Traders now believe that they overestimated the potential for a negotiated 
settlement. They have begun wondering whether crude will move back into the $40 
range or fluctuate in the $30 range. 
</P>
<P>
Crude's soaring prices since Iraq invaded Kuwait in August have been rooted in 
war psychology, as the world has maintained an adequate oil supply despite the 
global embargo of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not clear whether we are back in a fundamental market or if we need to 
keep a weather eye out for psychological changes," said oil analyst Peter 
Beutel of Pegasus Econometric Group Inc. in Hoboken, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
As oil moved up today, so did futures contracts for refined petroleum products 
and natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
Unleaded gasoline was up 7.81 cents to 93.20 cents per gallon on November 
delivery contracts, with all other contract months trading higher. Home heating 
oil was up 6.88 cents to 92.00 cents per gallon on November contracts, with all 
later delivery months trading higher. 
</P>
<P>
Natural gas was up 3 cents to $2.47 per 1,000 cubic feet on December delivery 
contracts. Most other delivery months were trading higher.

The stock market gave ground today, faced with revived upward pressure on oil 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 19.80 to 2,484.41. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 620 up, 850 down and 486 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 141.46 million shares, against 149.29 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 1.09 to 169.51. 
</P>
<P>
The price of crude oil for December delivery climbed more than $2 a barrel, to 
more than $33 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that was enough to squelch a tentative early rally that was 
credited to hopes for a resolution of the budget impasse in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
A plan put forward overnight by some members of Congress raised hopes that 
agreement might soon be reached on a government budget, relieving an 
uncertainty that has been hanging over the markets for the past month. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts agree that the Federal Reserve can't be expected to consider any move 
to relax its credit policy until the budget situation is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices rocketed higher again as politicians talked more hawkishly about the 
chance of war in the Persian Gulf. The December crude oil contract on the New 
York Mercantile Exchange jumped $3.17 to $34.25 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Losers among the blue chips included American Express, down 3/8 at 19 7/8; 
International Business Machines, down 7/8 at 107 3/4; Philip Morris, down 3/4 
at 47 1/2, and Ford Motor, down 1/4 at 31 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
MCA climbed 6 to 56. The stock plunged 8 7/8 Wednesday before Matsushita 
Electric denied reports that merger talks between the two companies had run 
into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of government bonds were slightly higher as an end to the haggling over 
the federal budget came into sight, as did further indications the economy is 
weakening. 
</P>
<P>
The price of the Treasury's key 30-year bond, which rose 5/32 point on 
Wednesday, was up another 5/32 point, or $1.56 per $1,000 in face amount at 
midday. Its yield, which falls when the price rises, slipped to 8.76% from 
8.77%.

The sales pace for existing homes dropped in September to the lowest level 
since January, 1988, as the economy weakened in the aftermath of the Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait, an industry survey said today. 
</P>
<P>
Declines were reported in all parts of the nation except the Northeast, which 
posted no change. 
</P>
<P>
The median price for an existing home also slipped to $94,300 in September, 
2.9% below August. 
</P>
<P>
The South was especially hard hit as thousands of military personnel were 
shipped off to defend Saudi Arabia after the Aug. 2 attack on Kuwait by Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The realtors said September's overall rate was 8% below the revised August rate 
of 3.5 million units, and 8.3% below the rate of sales during September, 1989.

Todd was troubled by injuries during his six seasons with the Raiders from 1965

Stefan Edberg, Ivan Lendl and Andre Agassi were fined substantial amounts by 
the ATP Tour today for failing to play in the required number of tournaments 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg, the world's top-ranked player, was fined a minimum of $115,496. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, ranked third, was fined a minimum $95,443 and the fifth-ranked Agassi 
was fined a minimum of $85,042. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Sharko, an ATP Tour spokesman, said the amount of the fines would increase 
proportionally to include any income the players earn during the rest of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is more than a financial penalty. I see this as an expression of 
commitment to play the ATP Tour World Championship," ATP Tour Chief Executive 
Officer Mark Miles said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg and Agassi were required to play in 11 tournaments. Lendl, because he is 
a 10-year veteran, was required to play one less. 
</P>
<P>
All three are now two tournaments short and the Paris tournament next week, in 
which they all are scheduled to play, is the final event before the 
season-ending ATP Tour World Championship at Frankfurt, Germany, from Nov. 13 
to 18. 
</P>
<P>
Sharko said the ATP Tour rules require a player be fined 10% of his income for 
each tournament he misses. Income from Grand Slam events are not included in 
the fines.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: HAVE A BITTER PILL TO SWALLOW? NEW METHODS MAY PROVE SWEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Americans hate shots and love pills. Latin Americans believe that shots are 
real medicine and do not complain nearly as much as their northern neighbors. 
The French, on the other hand, are big on suppositories. 
</P>
<P>
Pharmaceutical wizards are moving way past such crude methods of drug delivery 
as tablets, shots, lotions, liquids and drops. High technology is entering the 
drugstore and is providing people with better ways of getting drugs where they 
belong. 
</P>
<P>
A whole generation grew up believing that when you swallowed a pill it went 
straight to the place it was needed, like a guided missile. Television 
commercials, like the one for a popular headache remedy, used a simplistic 
picture of a man with a hammer pounding in his head. The advertised solution 
sped right to the spot and stopped his hammer. 
</P>
<P>
Tablets, capsules, syrups and even suppositories must be absorbed from the 
digestive tract into the bloodstream. From there the active ingredients are 
spread from your nose to your toes through the bloodstream. All this can delay 
the benefits of the medicine. Additionally, the entire body is exposed to the 
chemicals, and side effects may result. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are coming up with far more efficient systems and will be able to 
target drugs even more accurately than the television ad implied. 
</P>
<P>
Nicorette (nicotine resin) looks like chewing gum. It is actually a 
sophisticated drug delivery system that allows nicotine to be absorbed through 
the mucosal tissue in the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
There will soon be a nicotine patch that can be worn like an adhesive bandage. 
The nicotine will be absorbed through the skin directly into the bloodstream. 
Like Nicorette, this medication should help smokers who want to quit. 
</P>
<P>
Chemists are coming up with other ways to achieve long-lasting action. 
Norplant, inserted beneath the skin, releases contraceptive hormones for up to 
five years' protection from pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Robert Langer in Science magazine, tetracycline can combat 
periodontal disease at 1/1,000th the oral dose when it is inserted into the gum 
in a slow-release polymer form. 
</P>
<P>
Most exciting of all are the monoclonal antibodies produced by genetic 
engineering. When a drug is attached to one of these specialized antibodies, it 
truly does home in on the targeted cell. Researchers hope this approach will 
produce far greater success against septic shock, cancer and AIDS.

New York Mets outfielder Darryl Strawberry, who declared his free agency 
earlier this week, told a Los Angeles sportscaster that the Dodgers are No. 1 
on his shopping list for a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Dodgers are really, really, really interested in me, I'll be here," 
Strawberry said Tuesday in an interview with KABC. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be my No. 1 choice. I'm very determined to play here at home and if 
things can work out between myself and my agent and the Los Angeles Dodgers, I 
would love to be here at home and play. I mean, that's a dream that you always 
think about." 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry, a native of Los Angeles, is reportedly seeking a contract similar 
to the five-year, $23.5-million deal that Jose Canseco signed with the Oakland 
Athletics last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Until Nov. 5, the Mets are the only team permitted to talk money with 
Strawberry, who led New York with 37 home runs and 108 runs batted in last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Claire, vice president and general manager of the Dodgers, has said the 
Dodgers would be interested in Strawberry.

IT ALL ADDS UP: OAKLAND'S STEWART IS THE BEST IN BASEBALL; 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS: A'S PITCHER EARNS TOP SPOT IN ANNUAL COMPUTER RANKING BY STATISTICS. 
DODGER'S SCIOSCIA IS TOP-RATED NL CATCHER.

The Oakland A's may not be the best team in baseball, but they do have the best 
pitcher, according to computer rankings compiled by the sport's statisticians. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Stewart edged Roger Clemens of the Boston Red Sox, 95.984 points to 95.783 
on a scale of 100, the Elias Sports Bureau said. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart has won 20 games or more the last four seasons and was the MVP of the 
American League playoffs this season. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nobody I'd rather have than Dave Stewart," A's Manager Tony La Russa 
said. "He hasn't missed a start in four years." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco outfielder Kevin Mitchell was the top-rated non-pitcher, third in 
the overall rankings at 94.759. Mitchell repeated in the National League 
outfield, but Lonnie Smith of Atlanta and Barry Bonds of Pittsburgh replaced 
Tony Gwynn of San Diego and Eric Davis of Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
The rankings, created as part of the 1981 and 1985 strike settlements, are used 
to determine free agent compensation. They are based on such statistics as 
batting average, plate appearances, home runs and RBIs for hitters, and starts, 
innings, ERA, saves and strikeouts for pitchers. Statistics from the 1989 and 
1990 seasons are used and averaged. 
</P>
<P>
The top 30% in each category are Type A free agents and their former teams get 
two draft choices as compensation if they sign with a new team. The next 20% 
are Type B players and their former clubs get one draft pick, while the group 
making up the 10% below that are Type C players. Their former clubs get a 
special draft pick if they don't re-sign. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who isn't a free agent, having signed a $7-million, two-year contract 
extension during the season, took over the top spot from Kansas City 
right-hander Mark Gubicza. Clemens was the highest-rated player in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Ryne Sandberg of the Chicago Cubs led National League second basemen for the 
seventh straight season in ranking by position, while Barry Larkin of 
Cincinnati ended Ozzie Smith's six-year run at shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Scioscia of the Dodgers replaced Tony Pena, then with St. Louis, at 
catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Will Clark of San Francisco led NL first basemen for the third straight year. 
Tim Wallach of Montreal led the league's third basemen, replacing Bobby Bonilla 
of Pittsburgh, who in 1989 ended Mike Schmidt's eight-year reign. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Drabek of Pittsburgh replaced Orel Hershiser of the Dodgers as the 
league's top starting pitcher. Drabek was 22-6 with a 2.76 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Dibble of Cincinnati was the top reliever, replacing Mark Davis, who signed 
with Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
In the American League, Stewart's teammate, Dennis Eckersley, led relievers for 
the third straight year. Eckersley had 48 saves and a 0.61 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Carlton Fisk of the White Sox also led his position for the third 
consecutive season. Fisk hit .285 with 18 homers. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Greenwell of the Boston Red Sox repeated as the top-rated AL outfielder, 
but Robin Yount of Milwaukee and Ruben Sierra of Texas replaced Kirby Puckett 
of Minnesota and Jose Canseco of the A's. 
</P>
<P>
Fred McGriff of Toronto became the fourth player in four years to lead AL first 
basemen while Steve Sax of the New York Yankees replaced Julio Franco of Texas 
at second base. Alan Trammell of Detroit won at shortstop, while Wade Boggs of 
Boston was the top third baseman for the third time in four years. 
</P>
<P>
Dwight Evans of Boston and Dave Parker of Milwaukee tied for the lead among 
designated hitters. Evans was told Wednesday that the Red Sox will not exercise 
his option for the 1991 season.

BREEDERS' CUP / SPRINT; 
</P>
<P>
'FASTEST HORSE IN THE WORLD' SEEKS TO BREAK NEW GROUND 
</P>

<P>
He may be the only man ever fired by a queen and hired by a sheik. And now he 
trains "the fastest horse in the world." 
</P>
<P>
The trainer's name is Maj. Dick Hern, and the grandiose equine appellation, an 
invention of the English press, belongs to Dayjur, one of 21 horses either bred 
or raced in Europe who are entered in Saturday's Breeders' Cup races. 
</P>
<P>
Dayjur, owned by Sheik Hamdan ibn Rashid al Maktum of Dubai, was the 7-2 early 
favorite in the six-furlong, $1-million Breeders' Cup Sprint, which starts the 
seven-race program at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
The 69-year-old Hern, confined to a wheelchair since a hunting accident in 
1984, chuckles at the nickname, but he won't argue with it. "I don't know if 
there is a faster horse," he said today. "If there is, I hope he doesn't run on 
Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
In the first six Breeders' Cups, seven horses either bred or raced primarily in 
Europe won races. 
</P>
<P>
A victory by Dayjur, however, would break new ground. All the previous European 
victories came in either the Mile or the Turf, both grass races. None of the 
European entries have ever won on dirt, a surface unique to North America until 
just recently. 
</P>
<P>
Not only has Dayjur never raced on dirt, but he has never raced around a turn. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll either go on it, or he won't," Hern said. "We worked this morning, and 
he handled it very well for a horse that's never been on it before. We let him 
get some dirt in his face, and we worked four furlongs to get the feel of a 
turn." 
</P>
<P>
His workout was timed in a quick 45 4/5 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Dayjur, a Kentucky-bred son of Danzig, has won six of eight starts this year in 
France and England, including the Prix de l'Abbaye at Longchamps. His last loss 
was by a head in the Hue-Williams Stakes at Newbury, England, on May 18. Since 
then, Dayjur has won five in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Two other European horses, Corwyn Bay and Black Tie Affair, also are entered in 
the Sprint. The second favorite, however, is an American horse, Mr. Nickerson, 
who was 4-1 in the early line. 
</P>
<P>
In ill health, Hern almost retired in 1988 and, presumably for that reason, was 
asked to leave West Ilsley Stable, which is owned by Queen Elizabeth II. 
Although he now shares the stable with William Hastings-Bass, he will move to 
the sheik's stable, Kingwood House, full time next year. 
</P>
<P>
Once asked his philosophy of life, Hern replied: "Few things matter, and 
nothing matters much." 
</P>
<P>
So it's not difficult to understand how he approaches this race. 
</P>
<P>
"We are aware that we are entering unknown territory, facing the local experts 
and running on a track that suits them fine but is not particularly in our 
favor," Hern said. "I am under no illusions."

Game show host Bob Barker and an animal rights group want people to boycott a 
film in which horses jump from a 10-foot platform into an 11-foot-deep tank of 
water. 
</P>
<P>
"Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken," which is being filmed here, is about a woman who 
jumped into the ocean on horseback from a pier at Atlantic City, N.J., during 
the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Phillips, production executive for the movie, said producers have followed 
and even exceeded American Humane Assn. standards in the care of the horses, 
and no injuries have been reported. 
</P>
<P>
The jump "may be acceptable to the producers, may be acceptable to the 
association, but if the horses could speak, I'd bet it would not be acceptable 
to them," Barker said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Barker, a longtime animal rights activist, works with the Coalition to Protect 
Animals in Entertainment.

lon Jennings has had fame and fortune as a country singer. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with a high school equivalency diploma, he says he has the edge. 
</P>
<P>
Jennings, who dropped out in the 10th grade, passed the exam in December. 
</P>
<P>
"Going back to get your high school diploma isn't the answer to all your 
problems by any means, but I'll tell you what it is: It's a psychological 
advantage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives you that little bitty edge. It'll make you go through a door that you 
wouldn't have gone through if you didn't have it, because you knew that 
somebody on the other side of the door was educated."

What has kept Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward married for 32 years? Eternal 
love? Undying affection? 
</P>
<P>
Try sheer luck. 
</P>
<P>
The Newmans, breaking a policy of not talking about their marriage, told Parade 
magazine they don't know why they have stayed together. 
</P>
<P>
"Our marriage hasn't been a bed of roses," Newman said in the magazine's Sunday 
issue. "Sometimes you get terminally irritated, and at one point I just packed 
up and left." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why she thought their marriage had lasted, Woodward said: "I have no 
idea. Absolutely not one single idea on the subject. Probably sheer luck." 
</P>
<P>
And what about the time Newman packed up and left? 
</P>
<P>
"I was gone about 15 minutes," Newman said. "And I stopped and thought to 
myself, 'What the hell am I doing? I have no place to go!' And I turned around 
and came right back. Joanne's right. She said it. What we've got is sheer 
luck!"

Glenn Close changed her phone number. Steve Martin became closer to his 
parents. Sylvester Stallone's blood pressure increased. Arsenio Hall got 
scared. 
</P>
<P>
Fame affects celebrities in a variety of ways, as several of them reveal in the 
November issue of Cosmopolitan magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not a person anymore. You're someone to be challenged and stripped of 
your identity," Stallone says. "I enjoyed the attention at first. Now, as soon 
as they touch me, my hands ball up into a fist." 
</P>
<P>
Martin says his stardom has given his parents a new pastime: "We'll go out for 
a drive, and my mother will say, 'Let's stop here and get out. You walk on the 
street, and we'll watch the people look at you.' " 
</P>
<P>
For talk show host Hall, success has been sweet vindication -- although he is 
afraid it could all slip away. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happiest when I'm out there doing the show. I'm scared the rest of the 
time," Hall confesses. "I don't want to go back where I started."
