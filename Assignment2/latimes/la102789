RAYSON BILLEY; INSPIRED WWII CARTOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rayson Billey, 71, credited by Bill Mauldin with inspiring the latter's cartoon 
"Willie and Joe," which became a staple for soldiers during World War II. The 
cartoon was published between 1940 and 1945 in the military newspaper Stars and 
Stripes. "He had lots of sides to him, this guy," Mauldin said. "He was my 
guru. He taught me about the Army and how to get along in the infantry too." 
The cartoon portrayed U.S. soldiers making often irreverent comments about 
their status in the war effort. "He sort of took me under his wing," Mauldin 
said of his wartime service in the infantry with Billey, who was a career 
soldier. In Muskogee, Okla., on Tuesday of undisclosed causes.

DAN BEN-AMOTZ; CULTURAL SYMBOL FOR ISRAELIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dan Ben-Amotz, 66, an author who became a cultural symbol for a generation of 
modern Israelis. To many Israelis, the husky, bearded Ben-Amotz was a cultural 
icon who set the style for sabras, as native-born Israelis are called. "He 
helped create the sabra personality," said Zeev Chafetz, a fellow author. "He 
was brash, direct, unpretentious, idealistic in some ways, and naive in other 
ways." Ben-Amotz published "To Remember and to Forget," his first full-scale 
novel, in 1968. In the book, he tried to confront such questions as his 
European past and German guilt over the Holocaust. He also made an impact on 
Israeli society through his radio talk show in the 1950s called "Three Men in a 
Boat." Ben-Amotz was widely considered one of the pioneers in the revival of 
modern Hebrew from a dormant language of prayer and study. He authored a 
dictionary of Hebrew slang and wrote articles and novels that shocked many 
Israelis with their frankness. In Jerusalem on Oct. 20 of liver cancer.

NO QUICK STUDY ON SITE FOR AIRPORT; 
</P>
<P>
AVIATION: THE PANEL SEEKING AN ALTERNATIVE FOR LINDBERGH FIELD WANTS MORE TIME 
AND MONEY TO DO THE JOB. ONE COUNCILMAN CALLS IT A WASTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The panel studying the relocation of Lindbergh Field agreed Thursday to extend 
its review another year and spend $350,000 to $400,000 more to examine the 
"multiple airport option" unveiled last month by San Diego City Councilmen Ron 
Roberts and Bob Filner. 
</P>
<P>
If approved today by the San Diego Assn. of Governments' Board of Directors, 
the Airport Policy Advisory Committee's recommendation would about double the 
cost and duration of the search for an alternative to increasingly crowded 
Lindbergh Field, a study financed by a $350,000 Federal Aviation Administration 
grant. 
</P>
<P>
But Filner, who with Roberts led the call for a look at the two-airport plan, 
said the effort will be worthless because of restrictions on the scope of the 
study imposed by the panel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a complete waste of money," Filner said after the panel's meeting. "It's 
just a complete waste of money." 
</P>
<P>
Filner claimed that, as now written, the new study will automatically reject 
the multiple-airport option and point toward the three alternatives already 
identified by the Sandag airport committee: Miramar Naval Air Station, a tract 
east of Miramar and a huge parcel on Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
That is because the new examination will require that at least one of the 
region's airports accommodate 20 million passengers annually, a 12,000-foot 
runway, 5,000-foot safety zones at either end of the runway, simultaneous 
landings on widely separated landing strips, and full instrument-landing 
capacity. Under consideration would be Lindbergh, Brown and Montgomery fields 
in San Diego, Gillespie Field in El Cajon and McClellan-Palomar Airport in 
Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
Filner and Roberts' multiple airport option is based on the assumption that no 
site in the county could accommodate the estimated 35 million airline 
passengers expected to fly here by the middle of next century. It seeks to 
determine whether the load could be parceled out to Lindbergh and an expanded 
Brown Field, along with Montgomery and McClellan-Palomar airports. The Sandag 
panel added Gillespie to the list. 
</P>
<P>
The councilmen believe that Miramar could handle the traffic, but believe it is 
politically unlikely that the Navy would allow a civilian or joint-use airport 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts aide Wayne Raffesberger said the safety zone and runway length 
requirements would rule out Lindbergh, and the safety zone and 
instrument-landing requirements would appear to eliminate the expanded Brown 
Field plan unveiled by the councilmen last month with the help of a coalition 
of South Bay landowners. But he was hesitant to condemn the study entirely. 
</P>
<P>
"Those criteria, if strictly applied would appear to eliminate all five of 
those airports, I think," Raffesberger said. But, he added, "I don't know what 
to make of it yet. We hadn't seen those criteria." Roberts is attending an 
Urban Land Institute meeting out of town and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Hedy St. John, chairwoman of the study panel's technical committee, said she 
"would respectfully disagree" with Filner's assessment, arguing that, even at 
Lindbergh, land could be purchased to accommodate 5,000-foot safety zones at 
either end of the airport's 9,400-foot single runway. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she argued, safety criteria should not be compromised at the 
beginning of the study. "To compromise the standards and give the people of 
this region inadequate air and ground safety is not acceptable as a starting 
point," St. John said. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Line Pilots Assn., which favors the joint use of Miramar as the safest 
alternative, endorsed the safety criteria at a meeting of the technical 
committee Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay politicians, including U.S. Rep. Jim Bates, D-San Diego, State Sen. 
Wadie Deddeh, D-Chula Vista, and Filner, will ask Sandag in a letter to be 
delivered today to consider the joint use of Miramar, Filner said. An ALPA 
official also has signed that letter, he said.

CRUX OF DEFENSE IS VOIDED IN ABDUCTION FROM SECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge, preparing for next month's trial of five people accused 
of kidnaping a 23-year-old woman who the defendants claim was in the grip of a 
religious cult, has struck down the legal arguments that were to be the heart 
of the defense case. 
</P>
<P>
Judge David B. Moon Jr. ruled Wednesday in pretrial motions that attorneys, 
including those representing the parents and an older sister of Ginger Brown, 
cannot argue that the defendants tried to rescue Brown for her own safety. 
</P>
<P>
Nor will the defense attorneys be able to use the words "cult" or "thought 
control" during the trial, which is scheduled to begin with jury selection Nov. 
6 in Vista Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Moon, saying he doesn't want the trial to be a philosophical battleground for 
religious freedom, ruled that the defense team had not shown proof that Brown, 
a member of Great Among the Nations, had lost her free will by joining the 
small group, which now has its headquarters in Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
The defense attorneys said they will appeal Moon's decision because it 
essentially guts their defense of Brown's parents, Earle and Dorothy Brown of 
Santa Cruz; her sister, Holly Brown; Clifford Daniels, a Los Angeles 
deprogrammer, and Hank Erler, in whose Escondido home Brown was allegedly held 
against her will for five days in May, 1988, as they tried to get her to 
renounce her allegiance to the group. 
</P>
<P>
The defense had hoped to show that the kidnaping of Ginger Brown was motivated 
by her parent's concern for her well-being and that it was less evil than her 
continued alliance with the religious organization. 
</P>
<P>
But Moon said the elder Browns had not sought alternative, legal avenues to 
remove their daughter from the group before they forcibly snatched her. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Rempel said Moon's ruling will allow for a 
straightforward prosecution of a kidnaping case. Dorothy Brown's attorney, John 
Patterson, told Moon that, given his ruling, his client essentially has no 
defense.

PANEL BACKS SHERMAN OAKS SIZE LIMITS INTO '90 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Planning Commission on Thursday approved expanded temporary 
building restrictions on Sherman Oaks hillsides that will limit the size of 
houses built on sloping lots. 
</P>
<P>
The measure still must be approved by the City Council, which is expected to 
consider it in a few months. If signed into law, it will be in effect for one 
year, until a new set of regulations for hillside building is developed. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance, which was approved on a 3-2 vote, would extend an 
ordinance approved last May by the Los Angeles City Council that limited 
building on Sherman Oaks hillsides between Beverly Glen Boulevard and Camino de 
la Cumbre. The expanded area will include all hillside property bordered by the 
San Diego Freeway, Mulholland Drive, Valley Vista Boulevard and Dixie Canyon 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The new restrictions ban houses taller than 36 feet, require front and back 
yards to be at least five feet deep and prevent houses from covering more than 
half of their lots. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ordinance included regulations limiting hillside grading and 
required additional parking spaces for larger houses. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, proposed by Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, was 
prompted by homeowners' concerns over a developer's plan to construct about 22 
houses along Hopevale Drive, a narrow hillside street. Neighbors said they felt 
the houses would be disproportionately large. 
</P>
<P>
Several developers at the hearing protested the restrictions as too stringent. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Gould, a spokesman for CTC Management, which is building the Hopevale 
Drive homes, called the height restriction unfair. "This is just part of the 
slow-growth, no-growth attitude," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gould said the firm was planning to put houses of less than 2,800 square feet 
on the 6,000-square-foot lots. "I don't understand why something like this was 
even considered," he said. He added that the new restrictions would reduce the 
size of the planned houses to less than 2,300 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Two planning commissioners, Theodore Stein Jr. and Fernando Torres-Gil, voiced 
reservations about the ordinance, especially because city planners and 
community leaders are drafting permanent citywide zoning restrictions to 
regulate hillside building. 
</P>
<P>
"I live in the hillsides of Highland Park, and I'm not convinced that there is 
a problem in Sherman Oaks that is different from other areas," Torres-Gil said. 
</P>
<P>
He and Stein voted against the proposal.

L.A. TO SETTLE LAWSUIT FILED BY PARAPLEGIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA KLEIN LERNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles city attorney's office has recommended that the city pay $1.5 
million in an out-of-court settlement to a 34-year-old San Fernando man who 
severed his spine when he jumped head-first from a bunk bed onto the cement 
floor of his Van Nuys Jail cell. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Amescua, who became a paraplegic as a result of the incident, claimed 
that Los Angeles police negligently failed to provide him with psychiatric care 
and to take precautions to prevent him from injuring himself after his 1987 
arrest for failing to pay traffic tickets. 
</P>
<P>
The city agreed to the settlement Wednesday, six days before the case was 
scheduled to go to trial before U. S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima. The 
settlement is subject to approval by the mayor and City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Victoria G. Chaney said the city denies liability but 
agreed to the settlement for fear that a jury might award Amescua a larger sum. 
</P>
<P>
"Juries are not always predictable. . . . Given the severity of the injuries, 
the potential award could be between $5 million and $10 million," Chaney said. 
</P>
<P>
The federal civil rights lawsuit, filed by attorneys Michael R. Mitchell and 
David L. Margulies, alleged that jail personnel deprived Amescua of his 14th 
Amendment due process rights to appropriate medical and psychiatric care. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mitchell, Amescua was jailed on Jan. 16, 1987, after he stopped 
officers near his then-home in Van Nuys and informed them that he was wanted on 
outstanding warrants for unpaid traffic tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Amescua was transferred naked to an unlit, padded cell Jan. 19 after he ripped 
a toilet off the wall of his cell and tried to wash non-existent blood off the 
cell walls with his underwear, the suit alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Amescua told a jailhouse doctor who subsequently examined him that he had 
attempted suicide at age 16 and wanted to see a psychiatrist. The doctor noted 
that Amescua was depressive and should remain in the padded cell, but a jailer 
who did not know of the doctor's recommendation moved Amescua to a regular cell 
at Amescua's request. He was the only occupant of that cell when he jumped from 
the top bunk about 6 a.m., Mitchell alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Chaney said Amescua was transferred to the other cell because he seemed lucid, 
was remorseful about his behavior and requested a cell with more amenities. 
</P>
<P>
A divorced father of two who had his own auto upholstery business at the time 
of his arrest, Amescua received psychiatric care while he was being treated for 
his injuries and is now studying social work at Mission College, Mitchell said.

BID FOR SANTA CLARITA GROWTH ZONE EXPANSION FAULTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of the agency that oversees municipal boundaries are recommending 
that the agency's board reject Santa Clarita's bid to expand its zone of growth 
to more than 160 square miles of the unincorporated Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The city is asking the Local Agency Formation Commission, or LAFCO, to extend 
Santa Clarita's "sphere of influence" over one-third of the valley, including 
the unincorporated communities of Val Verde and Castaic and two canyons 
regarded by Los Angeles County sanitation officials as likely sites for garbage 
dumps. 
</P>
<P>
A sphere of influence designates the land eligible for annexation. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita's proposed sphere would include the 39 square miles within the 
current city boundaries plus an additional 160 square miles stretching from the 
Ventura County line on the west to Angeles National Forest on the east. If the 
area eventually became part of Santa Clarita, it would create a giant city 
equal in area to the combined cities of Lancaster, Palmdale, Long Beach and 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
But in a report to the LAFCO board released this week, the agency's executive 
director, Ruth Benell, recommended that the city's total sphere be scaled back 
to about 90 square miles. A public hearing on the city's request is scheduled 
for Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
The sphere recommended by Benell roughly equals the city boundaries proposed by 
incorporation advocates two years ago. But LAFCO scaled back that request to 
the 39 square miles that now include most of Valencia, Saugus, Newhall and 
Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
In her report to the LAFCO board, Benell said Castaic should not be included in 
Santa Clarita's sphere because residents there opposed the city's expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita's proposal is opposed by three county agencies hoping to preserve 
Elsmere Canyon and Towsley Canyon as potential dump sites. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council wanted Elsmere and Towsley included in the 
city's sphere to have some say over their future. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager George Caravalho said Thursday that the city requested the large 
sphere because it makes sense to create a unified plan to guide the valley's 
overall growth. "We still think the proposal is sound and that the boundaries 
make sense," Caravalho said.

NEW SPIN ON REFUGEE LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For several years, members of Congress have tried but failed to persuade the 
Reagan and Bush Administrations to allow illegal aliens from war-torn Central 
America to remain in this country until the turmoil there subsides. Now the 
most recent legislation designed to help Central American refugees may win 
approval because its authors have included provisions protecting a third group 
of aliens who may be in danger if they go home -- citizens of the Peoples 
Republic of China. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the House of Representatives approved a bill that would 
delay deportation of illegal immigrants from China, El Salvador and Nicaragua 
for three years. The bill, by Reps. Joe Moakley (D-Mass.) and Bruce A. Morrison 
(D-Conn.), also lays out conditions under which a similar "temporary protected 
status" could be granted to refugees from other countries by the Justice 
Department's Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the measure want the new refugee rules to replace the current 
system through which INS sometimes grants a special status, "extended voluntary 
departure," to immigrants from strife-torn nations. They argue that the current 
system is arbitrary, discretionary and inconsistent. That has certainly been 
the case with Central Americans. At the height of formerPresident Reagan's 
covert war against Nicaragua, persons opposed to the Sandinistas were 
encouraged to seek refuge here. Yet people fleeing the bloodier Salvadoran 
civil war were denied asylum because the U.S. government did not want to 
embarrass a friendly government in San Salvador. Now that Nicaragua's war is 
winding down with the Sandinistas still in power, the INS also is starting to 
turn down asylum requests from Nicaraguans. 
</P>
<P>
Extending the bill to cover Chinese nationals in the United States was a stroke 
of political genius by the authors, whose bill has already benefited from the 
outpouring of sympathy Americans have shown for Chinese dissidents in the wake 
of the June massacre in Beijing. In the House vote, the measure won support 
from congressmen who had opposed it in the past. If it passes the Senate and 
gets to President Bush's desk, it will pose a very uncomfortable political 
dilemma for him. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration could get around the Moakley-Morrison bill simply by 
granting extended voluntary departure to Central Americans and to Chinese 
refugees. Since it's already allowed within the law, that would be easy and 
preferable. But if the Administration remains rigid in dealing with Central 
American refugees, the proposed new law will be both necessary and desirable.

STOCK MARKET

In response to Ben Wattenberg's admonition to "Be Wily but Buy, for the Market 
Is America and Its Future Is Golden" (Op-Ed Page, Oct. 17): 
</P>
<P>
I think he left out some important indicators which might improve one's chances 
in our great American stock market. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, don't be in a stock-intensive situation just before any Friday 
the 13th, or probably Halloween, for that matter. Market players and their 
computers seem to be a bit on the superstitious side (or maybe they know 
something that we don't). Also, avoid vulnerability around anniversaries of 
previous crashes, "black" days, etc. Anyone with half a brain knows that 
lightning always strikes twice (or more). 
</P>
<P>
Next, be aware of the health of people important to the market cycles and 
strengths, i.e., President Bush's finger surgery. The implications are 
staggering! 
</P>
<P>
Finally, and perhaps most crucial, don't ignore the phase of the moon. In case 
no one noticed, this recent black Friday (Oct. 13) was very close to a full 
moon. Has anyone considered how many trusted stockbrokers, LBO operators and 
junk-bond dealers might be werewolves? Frightening. 
</P>
<P>
Other than that, go for the gold -- except maybe on Arbor Day.

HAT-IN-HAND REAGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Presidents of the United States are paid decent pensions. They are 
provided with a staff, comfortable and even sumptuous office space, personal 
security and other benefits, all without cost to themselves. Every retired 
President in modern times has had the chance to earn a lucrative fee for his 
memoirs. Some former Presidents have been richer than others, but no modern 
former President has had to live poor. 
</P>
<P>
This insulation against financial insecurity hasn't prevented some who occupied 
the White House from squeezing as much cash advantage as possible from their 
former notoriety. Thus Gerald Ford, after his election defeat in 1976, lavishly 
lent his name to a number of companies that were willing to pay well for the 
perceived prestige of having a former President on their boards. Ford's 
self-commercialization, however, pales besides that being practiced by Ronald 
Reagan. For a fee of $2 million -- an amount Nancy Reagan has now confirmed -- 
Reagan is spending nine days in Japan promoting the business interests of the 
Fujisankei Communications Group, the country's largest media conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
To earn his $222,222-a-day fee, Reagan is appearing on the company's TV 
programs, givinginterviews to its newspapers, speaking at its sponsored dinners 
and generally exuding geniality, flattery and good will. For the most part he 
sticks to carefully scripted remarks, but sometimes he ad libs, with 
unfortunate if not riotous results. Thus Reagan has suggested that a Japanese 
company's recent purchase of Columbia Pictures could serve to "bring back 
decency and good taste" to American films. Japanese moviegoers, with their 
well-known appreciation for gore, violence and explicit sex in films, must 
surely have gone into paroxysms of laughter when they heard that. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan was a wealthy man when he entered the White House, he was wealthier 
still when he left it, and together with his wife he stands to earn new 
millions in book royalties. He does not, in short, have to sell himself in 
Japan. Why then is he doing so? Perhaps it's nothing more than the old show-biz 
habit of getting it while you're hot, which let Reagan the actor add handsomely 
to his income by endorsing cigarettes, shirts and other products. Whatever the 
explanation, it does nothing to lessen the cheap and demeaning nature of what 
he is doing now, or reduce the insult that is being delivered to the office he 
was privileged to hold.

Your editorial suggests that teaching core cultural subjects should begin 
before college. You are right, of course. However, you don't go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
Children spend much more time watching TV than they do in school. We seem to 
forget the lessons that the success of "Sesame Street" taught us. Very young 
children love to learn from that program. Public broadcasting should be 
adequately funded to operate without corporate support and without having to 
beg for private donations. The amount of funding each station receives should 
provide incentives based on educational success.

EARTHQUAKES: THE BAY AREA LARGELY SURVIVED A 7.1 SHAKER. THAT TELLS US LITTLE 
ABOUT ITS ABILITY TO GET THROUGH AN 8.3. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN J. NANCE, John J. Nance is the author of On Shaky Ground, America's 
Earthquake Alert (Avon Books, 1989). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every now and then, like an irritated school teacher pushed too far, nature 
raises its voice and forces us to listen. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Hurricane Hugo captured the undivided attention of South 
Carolinians, illustrating the folly of building homes on hurricane-prone 
beaches. Last week it was the force and effect of powerful seismic waves 
marching north like a destructive army from ravaged Santa Cruz to San Francisco 
Bay that captured the undivided attention and sympathy of a nation. But while 
the sound and fury of the event have filled our newcasts and newspapers, the 
profound lessons cloaked within have been quieter and less obvious -- and in 
danger of going unheard. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the Bay Area survived. But what did it survive? Certainly not a great 
quake or momentous seismic upheaval, In fact, the magnitude of the quake that 
caused all the damage from Santa Cruz to the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland was 
somewhere between one-tenth to one-sixtieth of the so-called Big One that still 
lurks in the locked section of the San Andreas Fault in the vicinity of Daly 
City. Last week's quake has been rated at a magnitude of 7.1. The 1906 quake, 
by comparison -- the previous Big One for San Francisco -- was an estimated 8.3 
magnitude upheaval that unleashed more than 16 times the shaking and 100 times 
the energy. 
</P>
<P>
The two events can be compared in roughly the same proportion as a 13-pound 
baby compares to a muscular 200-pound man. When you look at the immense damage 
and loss of life that occurred at the hands of that 13-pound baby, you begin to 
see the scope and the breadth of the lesson: The fact that the Bay Area largely 
survived a magnitude 7.1 earthquake originating far to the south proves 
absolutely nothing about its vulnerability in the face of an 8.3 magnitude 
"great" earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Life goes on, of course, aided by the human tendency to put losses behind us as 
quickly as possible. In the case of an earthquake disaster such as this, we 
bury our dead and we go on living, trying not to dwell on the recent past. 
That's normal. That's human. But if we indulge in that tendency in this case, 
it will also be deadly. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the people of the San Francisco area were much more aware of and 
prepared for earthquakes than residents of other U.S. cities (with the 
exception of Los Angeles), and there is no doubt that Bay Area government 
leaders have shown more political courage than most in trying to get rid of 
seismic-bomb buildings (those brittle masonry structures guaranteed to fall 
down in major earthquakes). But the events of Oct. 17 have demonstrated all too 
clearly how flawed and incomplete those preparation efforts have been. After 
all, there are highways and bridges and concrete structures laced through the 
life of the Bay Area -- the very sinew of the civilization. If a 7.1 quake can 
flatten just one such structure, then the possibility of an 8.3-magnitude 
monster finding a wide variety of additional "surprise" weakness at the expense 
of thousands of lives is high. 
</P>
<P>
Consider Candlestick Park, full of World Series fans. Was it the strength of 
the stadium or the weakness of the quake that saved thousands of lives from the 
nightmare of structural collapse? Until we ask the right questions and do the 
proper research, no one can say with assurance. 
</P>
<P>
We have failed to go back and apply the latest knowledge about earthquake 
shaking and seismic engineering to older, existing structures. The fact that 
the Nimitz Freeway's concrete double-decked structure met existing standards 
and codes when it was built more than 30 years ago may provide a nice legal 
defense, but that legality protected no one when the quake arrived. The 
accident investigation into the freeway collapse may show that when measured 
against today's standards and codes, the structure was clearly unsafe. That 
raises a disturbing, haunting question for federal, state, and local leaders: 
What other structures are out there and in use that are clearly unsafe by 
today's measures? And what if we crank in the very real possibility of a 
magnitude 8.3? If Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner's recent comments 
on the rickety state of American highway bridges is any measure, the question 
extends not just to California, but to each of the 39 states subject to large 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
One-hundred-thousand feet below San Francisco, there are no snags holding the 
two great tectonic plates together. The rocks are hot and plastic there, and 
the Pacific Plate on the west slides steadily northwestward against the North 
American Plate on the east, moving along a boundary line that cuts the San 
Francisco suburb of Daly City roughly in half. That's what the San Andreas 
does: move, inexorably, day by day and hour by hour miles below, each 
centimeter of slippage building more pressure on the two plates where they're 
locked together and temporarily immovable within 10 miles of the surface. 
</P>
<P>
In Daly City there has been no appreciable slippage on the surface along the 
fault since 1906. But that can't continue forever. Eventually the snag will 
break and the western side will rumble northwestward to balance the accounts 
and make up what seismologists refer to as a "slip-deficit." 
</P>
<P>
When that happens, as eventually it must, San Francisco will have its Big One, 
and the Bay Area earthquake of 1989 will seem very minor indeed. Whether the 
area will be truly ready depends on learning the lessons and taking the 
appropriate actions now.

TWO CHEERS FOR OUR STANDARD OF LIVING; 
</P>
<P>
INCOME: MOST AMERICANS HAVE DONE MODERATELY BETTER IN THE 1980S, BUT THE POOR 
HAVE FALLEN FARTHER BEHIND NOT ONLY THE RICH BUT THE MAINSTREAM AS WELL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. SAMUELSON, Robert J. Samuelson writes about economic issues from 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most-scrutinized numbers published by the Census Bureau are the annual 
poverty and income statistics. In the 1980s, they have become a political 
battleground. On the one side are those (mainly Democrats) who contend that we 
face economic stagnation and growing inequality between rich and poor. On the 
other are those (mainly Republicans) who claim that living standards are 
steadily rising and that all is well. There ought to be a truce. The latest 
census report proves both sides half right. 
</P>
<P>
What the report shows is this: The 1980s have not been a period of joyless 
prosperity, whose benefits have gone only to the filthy rich. But stubborn 
poverty persists in the midst of plenty -- indeed, in the midst of increasing 
plenty. Let me give you some numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, average household income ($34,017 in 1988) has risen about 10% 
after adjusting for inflation. The gain since 1967 is roughly one-third. This 
is almost identical to the increase in productivity (output per hour worked). 
</P>
<P>
Higher living standards reflect our ability to produce. The more we produce 
(cars, airline service or whatever), the more we can consume. For married 
couples, average incomes ($42,801 in 1988) have increased 15% since 1980 and 
nearly 40% since 1967. This is not stagnation. 
</P>
<P>
But while most households are moving up, many low-income Americans have hardly 
made any progress. In 1980, households with income of less than $10,000 were 
18.7% of the total. In 1988, they were still 17%. (Again, all figures are 
adjusted for inflation and are stated in today's dollars.) It's possible to 
choose a variety of definitions of poverty. The conclusion remains the same: 
The poor are being left further behind. 
</P>
<P>
It's not only that the gap between the rich and poor is growing. The gap is 
growing between the poor and the majority of Americans who are, broadly 
speaking, in the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
What's depressing, then, is that the poverty trends remain unchanged. "A rising 
tide lifts all boats" is one of Americans' favorite economic faiths. 
Translation: Prosperity will make everyone better off. But this hasn't 
happened. Some possible explanations make the problem look less daunting. 
Others make it look virtually insoluble. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
Family breakdown -- Since 1967, the proportion of households headed by a woman, 
usually with children, has risen from 8.4% to 11.7% of the total. These 
households have low incomes and nearly two-fifths of them fall beneath the 
government's official poverty line. The situation is the same, though far less 
extreme, for men heading households with children alone. Since 1967, they've 
risen from about 1.8% to 3.1% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration -- The influx of poor Latinos and other immigrants has increased 
poverty and tended to reduce average incomes. Since 1980, the number of Latino 
households has risen by about 50%; the rise in Latino households represented 
one-fifth of the increase of all households in the1980s. The open question is 
whether the new immigrants will permanently enlarge the poverty pool or, after 
a while, climb up the income and social ladder. 
</P>
<P>
Falling earnings of low-skilled workers -- By one theory, the poor earnings of 
many men fosters family breakdown, because they aren't attractive husbands or 
cannot hold a family together. In 1973, a man 25 to 34 with a high school 
diploma earned 82% of what a college graduate of the same age did. By 1987, the 
high school graduate's earnings averaged 72% of the college graduate's. No one 
knows whether this slippage reflects a demand for higher skills, a cheapening 
of a high school diploma, the impact of foreign competition . . . or something 
else entirely. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble with the great debate about general living standards is that it 
distracts attention from what, if anything, government can do to reduce 
poverty. There are real and important differences between liberals and 
conservatives on this question. But that's where the argument ought to be 
focused, rather than on the issues of whether living standards are declining. 
This debate is mainly political theater masquerading as a serious inquiry. 
Democrats want to stigmatize the economy. Republicans want to glamorize it. 
Both stereotypes are misleading. 
</P>
<P>
What's involved is psychology as much as economics. Between World War II and 
the late 1960s, incomes and living standards rose so dramatically that 
Americans came to expect rapid and constant improvement as preordained. It 
wasn't. The subsequent slowdown is just that -- a slowdown. Some groups have 
struggled more than others. Younger baby boomers have suffered generational 
congestion. Their relative incomes have been depressed. But most Americans can 
still expect a gradual rise in living standards. It's neither calamitous nor 
glorious.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: MAITRE D' TAKES MENU BACK TO CZARIST RUSSIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the many perks that went with having VIP status in Czarist Russia was 
that, sooner or later, a particularly delectable dish would be named in your 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
A list of the choicest Russian dishes reads like a page from the St. Petersburg 
social register: coupe Romanov (vanilla ice cream, strawberries and liqueurs), 
beef stroganoff (the Russians did not then and do not now make it with canned 
mushroom soup) and crepes Ovanesoff, or feathery pancakes stuffed with 
raspberries macerated in curacao. Even the bourgeoisie occasionally figured in 
the nomenclature game, as in the endearing kotleti Pojarski, named for a famous 
innkeeper credited with creating these breaded meat patties in creamy paprika 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers to the Soviet Union grumble that the cooking now is quite a bit less 
than aristocratic, and, although no dish has been named officially for Soviet 
leader Mikhail Gorbachev, it is easy enough to guess that, given the current 
food shortages, various mystery meat concoctions may well have been dubbed in 
his honor. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, however, that classic Russian cooking can be superb. It also is 
quite difficult to find, but La Jolla's Maitre D', usually a bastion of French 
haute cuisine, has written a lengthy menu of classic dishes for its monthlong 
Russian food festival. The festival opened last week and will conclude Nov. 19, 
and, although the restaurant does not claim any affiliation with the city's 
Soviet arts festival, the timing obviously is not coincidental. 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, Maitre D' proprietor Louis Zalesjak filled a crock with 
peaches, grapes, apples and Stolichnaya vodka and allowed it to steep while he, 
his partner and their chef, French-born Jean Michel Carre, flew away on a 
six-week tour of Europe that included a stay in the Soviet Union. The resulting 
brew, based on a recipe from the august Imperial Hotel in Vienna, carries a 
wallop under its veil of fruited fragrance and is offered by itself or as a de 
rigueur accompaniment to an order of caviar and blinis. 
</P>
<P>
The stay in the Soviet Union offered Carre a chance to fine-tune the menu, 
which concentrates primarily on the grand dishes of the old days, with a few 
Georgian offerings -- Georgian cooking is highly respected in the U.S.S.R. -- 
thrown in to balance the often rich and creamy Russian entries. However, 
because many of the grand dishes were created by French chefs in the employ of 
powerful families, Carre must have found them familiar, as should anyone 
acquainted with French cuisine. Sour cream typically enriches sauces, which 
tend to be more highly seasoned than French and often include much paprika and 
onion. 
</P>
<P>
The menu opens with zakuski, the Russian word for hors d'oeuvres that usually 
signifies a whole buffet of nibbles to be browsed as a prelude to dinner. 
Maitre D' instead serves them by the individual order, and the choice is good, 
beginning with the classic Osetrina of smoked sturgeon wrapped in the buttery, 
yeast-raised pancakes called blini. Sirniki, a Georgian mouthful, is 
good-looking but a little bland; it takes the shape of a great wedge of crisp 
phyllo pastry wrapped around a cottage cheese stuffing. 
</P>
<P>
Other choices include a rich liver paste (pastete); piroski, or small butter 
pastries filled with highly seasoned chopped meat; thinly sliced smoked pork 
loin on a bed of pita bread, and an exquisite, Moscow-style borscht. This last, 
reddened with beets and enriched with cabbage, celery, onions and a spoon of 
sour cream, is based on a beef consomme of such clarity and depth that the 
flavors almost seem visible, rather like fish swimming through a shaft of light 
in a deep mountain lake. 
</P>
<P>
The menu would not be Russian without caviar, and it offers five, beginning 
with golden caviar and progressing, in terms of choiceness and price, through 
red, pressed Beluga, Sevruga and fresh Beluga. Caviar is, in the end, caviar -- 
not much can be done to it, and it was not sampled. But the restaurant makes a 
grand show of presenting it in a foot-tall silver egg, which opens to reveal a 
glass raft, laden with the precious eggs and floating among tiny floes of 
crushed ice. Blinis and iced vodka arrive on the side, and the prices for an 
ounce of the extravagant stuff range from $12 to $35. 
</P>
<P>
Kulibiac heads the entree list. This famous dish (which does not, however, 
appear to have been named for a famous individual) is a sort of salmon 
Wellington and consists of layers of richly sauced fish alternating with rice 
and chopped mushrooms inside a case of puff pastry. Sibirsi pelmeny are very 
typical of everyday Georgian cooking, although Maitre D' gives these 
tortellini-like pasta rounds a dandy finish with a sauce of sour cream, beef 
stock and dill. The minced meat stuffing is flavored with grated lemon peel and 
much garlic, and in Georgia would also include a great deal of cayenne pepper, 
a seasoning the restaurant chose to suppress in deference to local 
sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
So many dishes are based on chopped meat -- beef, lamb and veal, alone or in 
combination -- that the preparations sometimes seem as much Turkish or Greek as 
Russian. Given the nearness of these lands, the culinary similarities are 
unsurprising. The bitoski, or breaded patties of veal ground with butter, are 
particularly elegant under their cloak of stroganoff-like brown sauce. Similar 
dishes include the Pojarski cutlet, based on beef and veal and dressed with a 
highly seasoned sour cream sauce, and the humbler but tasty stuffed cabbage 
rolls. The Luli kebab combines chopped beef and lamb in patties, which are 
broiled on a skewer. 
</P>
<P>
Zalesjak was born to a hotel-owning family in Yugoslavia, trained at Swiss 
hotel schools and has been maitre d' (hence the restaurant's name) at important 
hotel dining rooms in New York, Montreal, Bangkok and elsewhere. He likes to 
make a great show of serving. Flaming dishes generally are dismissed these days 
as all pomp and no circumstance, but this point of view forgets that tableside 
cooking, when done properly, can produce exquisite results. Zalesjak flamed a 
skewer of beef "troika" at table -- and danced a quick Cossack step as he did 
so -- and the resulting cubes of marinated filet were, in fact, delicious. The 
burning brandy sealed the meat and set the flavor, which was picked up further 
by a thin but sharp brown sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The desserts tend to be simple but rich, and the blinchiki, or thin pancakes 
filled with sour cherries, are particularly nice. Sour cream is served on the 
side, but by this point in the meal it seems a little too much of a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant has hired a pair of musicians, including a former professor of 
music at Moscow University, for the duration of its Russian food festival, and 
the musical mix is a delight. The tempo changes from Tchaikovsky on the piano 
to Edith Piaf standards on the accordion and violin, and, believe it or not, 
balalaika renderings of "Those Were the Days" slipped in among the Russian folk 
tunes. 
</P>
<P>
Most appetizers and desserts are in the $5 range, and most entrees are priced 
at $15. The wine list, which from a connoisseur's point of view is a marvel, 
features very, very few moderate bottles, and the bill can rise accordingly. 
Dinner for two with house wine, tax and tip should cost about $65 to $90.

CRESPI STAYS IN HUNT, 10-7, AS SOPHOMORE PACES VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
Crespi High had two new prospects to deal with at Pierce College on Thursday 
night, one palatable and the other less than appetizing. 
</P>
<P>
First, the unsavory. With a loss to St. John Bosco, the Celts would have been 
mathematically eliminated from the Southern Section playoffs for the first time 
since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Next, the promising. Crespi made a quarterback change to sophomore Cody Smith, 
a junior varsity starter who became eligible to play varsity when he turned 15 
two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
With Smith's help, the new-look Crespi team was able to stave off postseason 
extinction -- at least for a week -- by beating St. John Bosco, 10-7. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't come easily. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves (4-4 overall, 1-1 in league play) had a chance to even the score 
with 15 seconds to play. Trailing, 10-7, St. John Bosco mounted a 13-play, 
56-yard drive to the Crespi two-yard line. The drive was kept alive when 
quarterback Gary Manley followed three consecutive incomplete passes with a 
17-yard completion to Doug Petzer at midfield on fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves worked the ball downfield and had a first down at the nine but were 
unable to punch the ball in. On fourth and goal from the two, Sergio Diaz took 
a handoff, was met head on by Jerry Thompson and was stopped for no gain. 
</P>
<P>
The Celts ran out the clock on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
"We rose to the occasion," Thompson said of the defense. "It was like a 
square-on hit. Me on him." 
</P>
<P>
Said Crespi Coach Tim Lins: "It was a helluva goal-line stand. My heart is 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
Some had questioned the heart of the Celts (5-3, 1-2) after they had lost close 
games to Loyola and Alemany and dropped to 0-2 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
Judging by its 36-yard performance in the first half, after which St. John 
Bosco led, 7-3, it appeared as if Crespi again would stumble. 
</P>
<P>
Then the defense came alive. Late in the third quarter, the ball was batted out 
of Manley's hand and recovered by Crespi's Frank Romano at the Braves' 27. 
</P>
<P>
Four plays later, Smith lofted a 17-yard pass toward the right corner of the 
end zone where Zach Rayner made a sliding catch. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't see the ball at first," said Rayner, who was covered closely 
by Jim Frausto. "It was in the lights. When it came out I picked it up and just 
reached out and got it." 
</P>
<P>
The reception and Bill Canalez's conversion kick gave Crespi a 10-7 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
There were few outstanding catches in the game. Smith completed eight of 17 
passes for 80 yards but four passes were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just part of the game," Smith said. "They're going to come back and 
catch many more for me." 
</P>
<P>
Leonice Brown, Crespi's leading rusher who sat out the first half because of 
sore ribs, gained 28 yards in six carries. Lucas Freeman led the Celts with 33 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Crespi was held to an uncharacteristically low 127 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
St. John Bosco took a 7-3 lead with 4:23 to play in the first half. Brent Bell 
took a pitch, cut inside and scored from 11 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi took a 3-0 lead with 4:44 to play in the first quarter when Canalez 
booted a 31-yard field goal.

WEST COAST CONFERENCE OK, BUT QUAKE SHAKES OFFICIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By and large, the West Coast Conference, with three members in the San 
Francisco Bay area and its office just south of Candlestick Park, got off 
lightly in last week's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The quake, however, did leave a lasting emotional impression. WCC assistant 
Commissioner Don Ott, who grew up in Washington State and worked at Oral 
Roberts University in Tulsa, said: "I've been in Mt. St. Helen's (volcanic 
eruption), a major flood, tornadoes -- and I'll take any of them over a 7 
(magnitude) quake." 
</P>
<P>
The conference office, and facilities at the University of San Francisco, Santa 
Clara University and St. Mary's College, suffered no serious casualties or 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
One sporting event was affected. San Jose State was scheduled to play at USF in 
a women's volleyball match the night of the quake. The visiting players were 
eating in the USF cafeteria when the quake hit at 5:04 p.m. The San Jose women 
were evacuated to USF's baseball field along with the rest of the students. 
With power out, the match was postponed and the San Jose women boarded the bus 
for a three-hour ride home on the gridlocked freeway. The nonconference match 
has not been rescheduled and may be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Weekend games went off without a hitch, Ott said. He noted that the biggest 
problems now are logistics. The WCC, for example, has its media guides printed 
across the bay in Berkeley -- normally a relatively easy drive up the 101 
freeway and across the Bay Bridge. Now, with the Bay Bridge closed, getting to 
Berkeley has become an agonizing trip. And that will be an everyday story in 
the Bay Area for months. 
</P>
<P>
Ott said the longest-lasting effect of the quake may be a widespread malaise he 
has noted. He said that while life "pretty much went on, it's hard 
(psychologically) to get back to normal. There's this feeling of, 'What does it 
all matter?' When I hear glasses clink now, I flash back to the quake. 
(Psychologists) are saying people here are having the same reactions as Vietnam 
veterans." 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Dominguez Hills will find out early next week if it will be the host 
site for women's NCAA Division II soccer playoffs. The Lady Toros, who continue 
to be ranked second in the nation behind Barry College of Miami, Fla., conclude 
their season Saturday at San Diego State. With Monday's 5-0 victory over Azusa 
Pacific, the Lady Toros had set a school record with 15 victories, 12 by 
shutout. After losing last week to Division I power UC Santa Barbara and 
receiving a tongue-lashing from Coach Marine Cano, the Lady Toros came back to 
score 13 goals in the next two games. With a strong finish, they expect to be 
invited to the final four. 
</P>
<P>
Barry appears to be Dominguez Hills' top competition as host site. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Blackmon, the four-year basketball standout from Cal State Dominguez 
Hills, appears to be adjusting to life as a professional in Japan. The 6-foot-7 
Los Angeles native is starting at center for Toshiba in Kawasaki, a Tokyo 
suburb, and recently scored 49 points in one of his first games. Blackmon, the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. Player of the Year the last two seasons, 
is working on a one-year contract for $75,000 that also provides room, board 
and transportation -- sizable expenses in metropolitan Tokyo. As a gaijin 
(foreigner), Blackmon is also studying Japanese. Said Dominguez Hills Coach 
Dave Yanai: "He has made the transition to a different kind of environment very 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Add Toros: Yanai opened practice with a slightly different roster than he 
expected. Forward Segaro Bozart, a part-time starter last season, came up one 
unit short of required class hours and will not be eligible until mid-December. 
Two other lettermen decided not to return. Starting forward Kenyatta Kalisana 
decided to concentrate on academics in his senior year. Guard Bryan Dell'Amico, 
a part-time starter for two seasons, has left school for a year to work. Yanai 
said Dell'Amico is continuing to train and plans to return next fall. 
</P>
<P>
Romance is still alive. Pepperdine basketball player Shann Ferch, a native of 
Bozeman, Mont., showed he has a grasp of Hollywood productions when he proposed 
to girlfriend Jennifer Crowell this summer. With the help of friends, Ferch 
placed a piano along the sand on Zuma Beach near the Pepperdine campus. He then 
suggested a stroll at dusk along the beach, where they happened upon the piano. 
Ferch, who had secretly taken piano lessons, played her a ballad he had written 
for the occasion, then proposed. They plan to marry next summer. 
</P>
<P>
Waves Coach Tom Asbury can only hope Ferch is this smooth on the court. 
</P>
<P>
College Notes: Dominguez Hills senior Joe Flanagan became the school's career 
scoring leader in men's soccer with a goal last week, giving him 81 points. His 
34 goals are two short of the school mark. The Toros fell to 2-4-1 in the CCAA 
on Wednesday with a 1-0 loss to Cal State Bakersfield . . . The Western 
Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. will have a new look next spring. The WIVA is 
expanding to 12 teams with the addition of Brigham Young and will split into 
two six-team divisions, creating a postseason tournament for the title. One 
division will house Loyola Marymount, Hawaii, Cal State Long Beach, San Diego 
State, Stanford and USC. The other will include BYU, Cal State Northridge, 
Pepperdine, UC Irvine, UCLA and UC Santa Barbara. WIVA members have won every 
men's NCAA Division I volleyball title . . . Dominguez Hills senior setter 
Karen Sutherland set a school volleyball record with 43 assists in a five-game 
match against Cal State L.A.

BEVERLY HILLS FORFEITS TO HAWTHORNE

<P>
Beverly Hills High forfeited today's scheduled Bay League football game with 
Hawthorne because of the Beverly Hills Unified School District teachers strike, 
Principal Ben Bushman announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Bushman said the Normans will not play the game because co-coaches Bill 
Stansbury and Dick Billingsley are on strike. Beverly Hills also forfeited last 
week's game with Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not play unless we have our regular coaches," Bushman said. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills' players had practiced this week with substitute coaches. 
</P>
<P>
The loss all but eliminates the Normans from playoff contention. They fell to 
3-5 overall and 2-3 in the Bay League. 
</P>
<P>
Bushman said Beverly Hills will continue to conduct practices in hopes of 
playing Palos Verdes next Friday if the strike is settled. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne, which moved to No. 1 this week in the Southern Section Division II 
rankings, improved to 8-0 overall and leads the league with a 5-0 mark. The 
Cougars resume play next Friday against Leuzinger. ROB FERNAS

LOYOLA WATER POLO STAR WOULD RATHER SCORE WELL IN CLASS; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE: TIM WAGGONER, THE LIONS' TOP SCORER, SAYS HIS BUSINESS EDUCATION IS 
'THE MAIN THING IN MY LIFE NOW BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I WILL NEVER BE IN A MILK 
COMMERCIAL FOR MY WATER POLO PLAYING.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Playing a sport in college takes a lot of time. It's not every student who can 
play sports and do well in school. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Waggoner, leading scorer for the Loyola Marymount water polo team, has had 
to decide which takes priority -- sports or education. Education is the winner. 
</P>
<P>
A business major, Waggoner enjoys the rigors of an accounting class because of 
the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"Doing well in school is important to me," Waggoner said. "It's the main thing 
in my life now because I know that I will never be in a milk commercial for my 
water polo playing. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that I'm taking the upper-division classes, I like my major even more than 
I thought I would. I find the business classes much more interesting than the 
lower division classes." 
</P>
<P>
Waggoner has succeeded in the water as well. He leads the Lions, now 7-9, into 
this weekend's UC Riverside Tournament with 33 goals and four assists. 
</P>
<P>
Attending Loyola was not his first choice -- that was Humboldt State -- but he 
says that he is satisfied. One of his reasons for attending Loyola was to 
combine a quality education with water polo. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to go to Humboldt and major in fisheries, but I decided that I 
wanted to play water polo because of how much I enjoyed it in high school," 
Waggoner said. 
</P>
<P>
Finding time to study is hard for players who practice almost six hours every 
day and play in tournaments on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
"I rarely have a free weekend. I just have to cram the studying in when I can," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jim McMillan said that next year he expects Waggoner to become the 
captain of the team. The only thing that McMillan says Waggoner has to work on 
is being more vocal to encourage the team. 
</P>
<P>
"As a junior, he is a quiet leader," McMillan said. "He's very intense in the 
game and likes to win. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that most impresses me is the kind of priorities that he has made. 
For him school comes first, then water polo, and finally his personal life." 
</P>
<P>
Waggoner, a 6-foot-2, 190-pounder from Indio, plays the two-meter position, 
directly in front of the goalie. The position is the last line of defense and 
the front line of offense. 
</P>
<P>
He likes the two-meter spot because you have to be tough to stay in with the 
larger players -- if opponents want to score they have to beat him. 
</P>
<P>
Though an interest in business is his driving force, he doesn't expect to 
completely leave water polo behind. Playing in clubs is how he hopes to keep 
enthusiasm for the game. He is not, however, going to try out for the U.S. team 
because of the time it would cost him. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, he hopes to get into coaching high school water polo on a part-time 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that I would want to be the head coach, but I would definitely 
like to help out," Waggoner said. "I could definitely see myself very easily 
doing that. 
</P>
<P>
"In high school, I used to coach a (youth) group and that was fun, coaching the 
little guys. It was just that I could tell them all of my secrets of what and 
how to do things. I gave them the benefit of whatever insight I had to bring 
about the better player in them. My team won the gold for its age group." 
</P>
<P>
He explains his place on the Loyola team by saying that he is just there to 
help the Lions win. Most of all, he says that he has teammates who can score 
goals and play as a unit. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess that Brad (Giannini) is one of our main assets," Waggoner said. "When 
he has a good game, then we have a good game. He always sparks our fire." 
</P>
<P>
Giannini is the team's top goalie. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach assistant coach Guy Baker and player Steve Laughlin were 
the first to influence Waggoner to play water polo. Originally he wanted to 
play football (and end up on the Dallas Cowboys) but doesn't regret his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends really got me into it because they were playing all of the time, so 
I started playing with them," Waggoner said. "I'm happy that I chose water polo 
because I can't see myself running around on a football field anymore. I'm much 
more comfortable in the water." 
</P>
<P>
The one thing that he misses is hunting and fishing with his father, Gilbert, 
which he did regularly until he went to college. For the past three years he 
hasn't had the time. He misses it mostly because of the time he spent with his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been hunting since I was 3, and it brought all of our friends and family 
together," Waggoner said. "All the men would go off and drink a few beers and 
tell a few stories, then we had a feast." 
</P>
<P>
Waggoner realizes that his struggles won't stop when he graduates. He knows 
that starting in business is tough. Waggoner says he is more than willing to 
work his way to the top. He doesn't plan on just treading water.

HIGH SCHOOL CROSS-COUNTRY ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
MCCRANK'S FINISH NUDGES HART INTO FIRST PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hart High boys' cross-country team, second-ranked in the Southern Section 
3-A Division, tied No. 1 San Gabriel, 28-28, Thursday at San Gabriel High, but 
won the Foothill League meet because its sixth runner posted a faster time than 
San Gabriel's fifth runner. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Steve McCrank, the Indians' sixth runner, placed 10th in 16:37. McCrank 
finished ahead of Dorro Pingarron, San Gabriel's fifth and final scorer. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the hero," Hart Coach Gene Blankenship said. "He's getting better every 
week." 
</P>
<P>
The victory moved Hart (5-0 in league meets) into first place and gives the 
Indians at least a share of the league dual-meet championship for the seventh 
consecutive season. San Gabriel (4-1) dropped to second place. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Lepken (15:38) and Hector Chavez (15:52) paced Hart with second- and 
fourth-place finishes. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Martinez timed 15:15 to lead the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
In other boys' meets: 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood 26, Grant 29 -- The Huskies captured the East Valley League 
title with the win at Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
Dov Waisman (16:38) and David Mazin (17:37) placed first and second for North 
Hollywood (3-0 in league) 
</P>
<P>
Grant dropped to 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando 24, Kennedy 31 -- San Fernando (3-0) sewed up the North Valley 
League title at Pierce College. The Tigers' Obed Aguirre finished first in a 
personal-best 15 minutes, 11 seconds over the three-mile course. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Cougars (2-1) were led by Warren Reich, who finished second in 
16:18. 
</P>
<P>
GIRLS 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando 24, Kennedy 33 -- San Fernando snapped Kennedy's winning streak of 
49 league dual meets with the upset at Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
Aracely Flores (20:54) of Kennedy (2-1) finished first but the Tigers placed 
three runners in the top five finishers to clinch the league title. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Hernandez (22:11) and Maria Sanchez (22:22) paced San Fernando (3-0) with 
second- and third-place finishes. 
</P>
<P>
Bell-Jeff 27, Notre Dame 30 -- The sixth-ranked Guards (7-1, 5-1) survived 
first- and second-place finishes by Notre Dame to win a San Fernando Valley 
League meet at Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame senior Lynn Hosek finished first in a school-record time 18:41 to 
lead the Knights (4-3, 2-3). 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood 23, Grant 34 -- Rosa Melendez finished first in 19:42 to pace 
North Hollywood (3-0) to the East Valley League title at Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
Mari Chernow (21:35) and Rachel Gibson (21:53) placed second and third for the 
Lancers (1-2).

SPORTSWALK INDUCTS 4 FORMER STARS, HONORS LITTLE LEAGUERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN LINDSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The future and the past of sports came together this week when the San Pedro 
Sportswalk inducted four new members and created a new "Circle of Excellence" 
for Little League players. 
</P>
<P>
The four inductees were the Dodgers' Roy Campanella and the late Jackie 
Robinson, Jerry West, the general manager and former scoring star of the 
Lakers, and Mando Ramos, two-time world lightweight boxing champion. 
</P>
<P>
Also present for induction into the Circle of Excellence were the players from 
the Eastview All-Stars Little League who went to the Little League World Series 
this year. The team was widely publicized because of Victoria Brucker, the 
first girl to start on a team vying for the title. 
</P>
<P>
Campanella, West and Ramos implored that the youngsters stay off drugs and work 
hard for their dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Robinson's posthumous award was accepted by his brother, Mack Robinson, 
a silver medalist in the 1936 Olympics. Robinson recounted his brother's career 
and thanked the committee for remembering the ballplayer who pioneered the 
integration of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an inspiration for the children to remember Jackie," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
West said, "Sports are granted a special place in America and the ability to 
abuse it is just as great." He added that a lot of visible sports figures have 
harmed themselves and the reputation of sports figures in general, but that he 
was happy to give back what he could. 
</P>
<P>
Campanella said that getting the award prompted him to look back on the 
opportunities that had been given him and how today's youth has even greater 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos capped things by presenting the Sportswalk committee with a plaque from 
the DARE anti-drug program. 
</P>
<P>
The Eastview Little Leaguers were presented with baseballs signed by the 
Dodgers as it was announced that they would be the first inductees of the 
Circle of Excellence for Little League players in the San Pedro area. 
</P>
<P>
The team will also have a bronze plaque placed at Daniels Field in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
The Sportswalk was created in 1978 as part of the Beacon Street revitalization 
in San Pedro. It is set up to honor prominent athletes from all sports. Some of 
the past inductees include Wilt Chamberlain, John Wooden and Jackie

ARRESTED HART PLAYERS TO PLAY

Five Hart High varsity football players arrested Tuesday for allegedly 
kidnaping a 17-year-old girl will not face disciplinary action from the school, 
Hart Athletic Director Bill Beauer said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any jurisdiction," Beauer said. "It has nothing to do with the 
school. . . . What they do after hours on their own time is not our business." 
</P>
<P>
Beauer said that all five players will be allowed to play in Hart's game 
tonight against Burbank. The players were released into their parents' custody 
after the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged kidnaping occurred early Saturday and appeared to be a prank, a 
police spokesman said. The boys forced the girl, a schoolmate, into a van and 
left her on Pico Canyon Road. Walking out of the canyon, the girl once more was 
forced into the van, then was taken to a friend's home in Newhall. BRENDAN

JUNK BOND WRITE-DOWN RESPONSIBLE FOR ICA LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Imperial Corp. of America's previously announced decision to write down the 
value of its junk bond portfolio was the prime factor in a $103.1-million loss 
for the quarter ended Sept. 30, the savings-and-loan holding company reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego-based parent of Imperial Savings of California said before the 
close of the third quarter that its $1.2-billion portfolio of high-yield, 
high-risk bonds was worth $130 million less than what it had paid, after 
accounting for previously taken loss reserves. The S&amp;L then said it would 
be forced to write down the bonds to market value because of provisions of the 
federal S&amp;L rescue bill passed last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Before the third quarter ended, however, ICA's junk bonds deteriorated further, 
and ICA ended up taking a write-off of $147 million, causing an after-tax loss 
of $92.2 million attributable to the junk bonds, it said. The S&amp;L parent 
had previously set aside loss provisions of $67 million for the bonds, bringing 
total loss reserves to $214 million. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the quarter's junk bond loss provisions was $11.8 million set aside 
to cover losses on bonds issued by Integrated Resources, a troubled financial 
services company. Combined with the $22 million in loss provisions set aside in 
the second quarter, ICA now has written off $33.8 million of the $40-million 
cost of its Integrated Resources bonds. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, ICA set aside $33.5 million in third-quarter loan loss provisions, 
a pretax charge. The provisions cover expected losses on real estate and 
consumer loans, including auto loans serviced by Grand Wilshire Finance, which 
declared bankruptcy last year. 
</P>
<P>
The $103.1-million net loss for the quarter contrasts with net income of $11.8 
million over the same three months last year. For the year to date, ICA's loss 
stands at $136.2 million, contrasted with a profit of $27.7 million for the 
comparable nine months last year. 
</P>
<P>
In a bid to meet the S&amp;L rescue bill's tougher capital requirements, ICA 
said previously that it planned to shrink assets by at least $2 billion in 
coming quarters. As of Sept. 30, ICA total assets were down to $10.96 billion 
from $12.3 billion Dec. 31.

TCS Financial: The San Diego-based financial services company reported a profit 
of $210,000 on revenue of $2.2 million for the third quarter ended July 31, 
contrasted with a profit of $37,000 on revenue of $1.7 million for the same 
three months the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
The results reflect $700,000 in charges, including a write-off of $400,000 that 
TCS invested in the Hotel Pontchartrain refurbishment project in Detroit. The 
company said the hotel investment has suffered from delays in adjoining Detroit 
redevelopment projects. TCS also set aside reserves to cover the effect of 
Proposition 103, the auto insurance initiative. 
</P>
<P>
TCS also said it is negotiating to buy back TCS stock held by Lincoln Savings, 
an Orange County thrift that was recently taken over by federal regulators. TCS 
has offered to pay Lincoln's cost of the 578,000 shares, which represent 18% of 
the fully diluted total of outstanding TCS stock.

UAL Corp.: The parent of United Airlines said third-quarter earnings fell 
nearly 40% because of costs related to recent takeover activity. The company 
said the decline in earnings to $111 million was also because of higher 
gasoline costs and commissions to travel agents. Revenue in the third quarter 
rose 7% to $2.6 billion. UAL said takeover activity doubled its share price and 
increased the value of stock options, resulting in a non-cash expense of $35.5 
million.

GLOWING REVIEWS INCREASE DEMAND FOR FESTIVAL PLAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The trade of critic, in literature, music, and the drama, is the most degraded 
of trades," wrote Mark Twain. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, nobody loves a critic until glowing reviews come in. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the glowing reviews have come in for the Soviet Arts Festival theater 
presentations of the Maly Theatre's "Brothers and Sisters" at the Old Globe 
Theatre and Nicolai Kolyada's "Slingshot" at the San Diego Repertory Theatre. 
And the phones haven't stopped ringing at the theaters since. 
</P>
<P>
"Slingshot" actually wasn't doing poorly before the reviews. Its 53% advance 
sales were the highest of any play produced at the Rep in a subscription series 
in three years. This occurred despite being so different in intensity and style 
from most American theater productions that producing director Sam Woodhouse 
sent a letter to subscribers warning them of the content, which audiences might 
find "at times frightening and unsettling but, in its conclusion . . . 
uplifting and inspirational." 
</P>
<P>
"We have these expectations that the theater is a cupcake, a place where you go 
to have fun," said Woodhouse, explaining why he sent the letter. "The Russians 
use the theater as a way of discovering the great truth of existence -- the 
anguish and the ecstasy. When you break ground, it helps to tell people a 
little bit about the shovel." 
</P>
<P>
But the Old Globe expected better than the 45% advance sales it received for 
its mammoth undertaking. The Old Globe usually counts on an 70-75% subscriber 
rate in its regular season (of which "Brothers and Sisters" was not a part). 
The show cost the theater $750,000 to produce above the $250,000 paid for by 
the festival, a figure the theater hoped to make up with tickets priced at $75. 
The cost of the initially scheduled three-week run was $750,000, with $250,000 
added for the fourth week, running through Nov. 19, making it a million-dollar 
baby. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why my fingernails were so short," said Thomas Hall, managing director. 
</P>
<P>
But, after the reviews, sales jumped 10%, bringing the theater to over $400,000 
in sales. If this rate continues, it would bode well for the Globe to break 
even, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Hall would prefer to do better than break even -- for more than the obvious 
reasons. Undertaking a project that took no less than 14 months of negotiations 
to bring here, was "very much an experiment," according to Hall. If the project 
becomes a commercial as well as a critical success, that will help the Globe 
negotiate other such exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
It has not escaped Hall or Woodhouse that both plays, like the San Diego Opera 
presentation of "Boris Godunov," are about the suffering of the Russian people. 
In "Boris Godunov," the people suffer under the czars, in "Brothers and 
Sisters" under the Stalinist government that starved the farmers feeding the 
rest of the country, and, in "Slingshot," Russians suffer in a contemporary 
world of hardship and repression. 
</P>
<P>
Woodhouse and Hall agree that Russians have used the theme of suffering to 
achieve greater intensity in their art. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really beginning to believe that the Russians as a people -- if theater is 
any reflection of life -- believe that without suffering there is no light," 
Woodhouse said. "When one is starving and one can't improve one's physical lot, 
where does one look for happiness and a sense of wholeness if not to the spirit 
and the heart?" 
</P>
<P>
Said Hall: "Suffering is obviously a very prominent theme and all it takes is 
one trip to the Soviet Union to understand that. But what is important to me is 
not just the suffering of the Soviet people, but the will to survive. I think 
that, finally, is what makes this work so moving." 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAM NOTES: The Soviet arts festival may end in November, but the Soviet 
invasion continues with the North American premiere of the 27-member Soviet 
Acrobatic Revue at the Old Globe Dec. 5-17. The group replaces the Peking 
Acrobats, who couldn't get exit visas because of political unrest in China. The 
Soviet Acrobatic Revue will kick off its 90-city United States tour in San 
Diego. . . . Peter Coyote, Stockard Channing and Joyce Van Patten were signed 
Tuesday to star in Neil Simon's new play, "Jake's Women," at the Old Globe 
Theatre March 8-April 15. The show will mark Old Globe debuts for Coyote and 
Channing; Van Patten was last at the Old Globe in Simon's premiere of "Rumors" 
last year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
There's a new ending on "Breaking Legs," Tom Dulack's play which continues in 
its world premiere at the Old Globe's Cassius Carter Centre Stage through next 
week. Artistic director Jack O'Brien, who directed the work, reports a standing 
ovation on the tryout of the new conclusion in which the playwright gets to 
keep the girl and his integrity. . . . The La Jolla Playhouse is planning for a 
1990 season, even if it is still raising money to ensure it will happen; it has 
already distributed a brochure offering patrons the opportunity to see the 1990 
season at the 1989 price. The response is three times greater than at a 
comparable time last year, said a Playhouse spokeswoman. . . . James Morrison, 
who played the psychotic killer in this season's Playhouse production of "Down 
the Road," is working on a television series to be aired in January called 
"Capitol News" with another Playhouse alum, William Russ ("Ghost on Fire" and 
"Hedda Gabler"). This time Morrison plays a mild-mannered political aide. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Reuel Olin stepped in as the new artistic director of Diversionary Theatre, San 
Diego's gay and lesbian theater group. Olin, a former member of the company's 
board of trustees, replaces Thomas Vegh. . . . Currently performing actors 
Linda Libby ("Angel City") and David Whitney Johnson ("Solid Oak") will be 
doing double acting duties at Patrick Henry High School on Friday in the 
California Young Playwrights Project touring show, "The Inner Circle." The 
story about teen-agers and AIDS plays at 8:30 a.m. in Rooms 111 and 113. . . . 
The San Diego Critics Circle Awards will be held Sunday at 7 p.m. at the Abbey 
Restaurant. . . . Still making Halloween plans? Featured at the upcoming 
post-performance discussion for the Playhouse's "Macbeth" on Halloween eve will 
be the Three Wayward Women -- Rebecca Schull, Tracey Ellis and Jessica Black -- 
talking about sorcery beginning at 10:45 p.m. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Also on Halloween night, Ethan Feerst, executive director of Sledgehammer 
Theatre promises "something with giant pumpkins and blood" in the set his 
company is designing for the final appearance of Soviet rock star Vladimir 
Kuzmin and his band, Dinamik, at the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art.

Gillian Lynne, the choreographer/director of "Cats," "Phantom of the Opera" and 
the recently opened "Aspects of Love," among other hit shows, will put on her 
dancing shoes to perform for the first time in 20 years at a Royal Command 
Performance Nov. 20 in London. For the performance, Lynne has been "commanded" 
to stage excerpts from her award-winning tribute to painter L. S. Lowrey, "A 
Simple Man," which she devised, directed and choreographed. But ballerina Moira 
Shearer, who danced a leading role in the work, has other commitments and 
cannot appear at the command performance, so Lynne will take over. She was a 
soloist for several years with the Royal Ballet and later staged numerous 
ballets at Covent Garden. ALEENE MacMINN

Meanwhile, in record stores, cassette single sales jumped 500% in the first 
half of 1989 compared with the same period last year, but overall the U.S. 
record industry posted just a slight gain. Figures released this week by the 
Recording Industry Assn. of America covering the first half of the year show a 
dollar gain of just .52% to $2.97 billion. The cassette single went from more 
than 5 million sold during January-June 1988 to 32 million in the first half of 
1989. Vinyl continued its rapid decline (LP sales fell about 60%, from 43 
million units to just 17 million), while CDs continued to rise (70 million to 
more than 96 million) and cassette albums rose slightly to 211 million units. 
Still, a hot fall and anticipated busy holiday season are expected to turn the 
year into the music business's best ever. ALEENE MacMINN

More folks than ever went to the opera in the United States last year. The 
Central Opera Service, a research department of the Metropolitan Opera, says 
that 1988-89 attendance was up 21% over 1987-88, with a record 21.4 million 
people attending a performance. That figure continued a growth that's been 
going on for 30 years, but it broke the pattern by doubling any earlier 
one-year increase. The report lists 1,285 opera-producing organizations in the 
United States (same as 1987-88) but performances rose from 21,197, to 24,923. 
The most performed works: Seymour Barab's "Little Red Riding Hood" (733 
performances) and Gian Carlo Menotti's "Amahl and the Night Visitors" (563 
performances). Mozart's "The Marriage of Figaro" was the most frequent standard 
with 279 performances. ALEENE MacMINN

'IMMEDIATE FAMILY' A PREDICTABLE DRAMA ON ADOPTION

<TEXT>
<P>
What in the sweet name of goodness is "Immediate Family" (citywide) doing in a 
movie theater? You expect writing this leaden from the grimmest ghettoes of 
television: earnest, unbuoyant talk that takes a subject like childlessness and 
teen-age adoption and flattens it into drama that's predictable down to the 
smallest reference, which in this case is a flowering plum tree. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the film's cast of heavy hitters -- Glenn Close, James Woods and 
Mary Stuart Masterson -- has boosted it over the fence and into the local 
14-plexes. Don't let that sway you. Mush is still mush, even when it's directed 
by "Heart Like a Wheel's" Jonathan Kaplan. 
</P>
<P>
Cast as the film's warm, loving center, neither Close nor Woods seems 
comfortable or even ideal for the assignment. You keep waiting for Woods' vet, 
a specialist in canine microsurgery, to develop a mean streak and to drop that 
kitty he's holding; instead, he perseveres as the year's most unlikely Mr. Nice 
Guy. You wait, too, for Close to retire that radiantly artificial smile and 
those brimming eyes and just be for one single moment. It never happens. 
</P>
<P>
The film poses a virtually undebatable question: Where will a baby from an 
unplanned pregnancy get its best shot in life? Will it be with its birth 
parents, struggling under-class teen-agers (Masterson, Kevin Dillon), or with a 
pair of have-it-all, childless professionals (Close, Woods). 
</P>
<P>
Given this setup, the answer should be pretty clear-cut, but Barbara Benedek's 
screenplay turns our feelings around, unintentionally. As we meet Close's rigid 
realtor, on her way to an upscale child's birthday party, she complains that 
animals hate her, children don't like her and she always buys the wrong 
present. We're supposed to feel just the opposite, to see her charm, to get to 
know her human qualities. Unfortunately, the more we're shown, the more we side 
with the animals. 
</P>
<P>
Her character is relentless -- socially obtuse, self-pitying and preachy. 
"You're asking me the secret of a happy marriage?" she muses to Masterson, who 
didn't exactly ask. "Respect, affection, a lot of laughs, a sense of yourself 
and only one person gets to be crazy at a time." (One friendly component in a 
marriage doesn't even place on that list?) 
</P>
<P>
Not all the performances are so achingly high-minded. Take a look at what 
Masterson has done with this pregnant waif who choses "open adoption" -- in 
which both adoptive parties meet before the birth -- as the best way for her 
baby. Masterson's teen-ager, the child of a 17-year-old mother herself, is by 
turns cocky, lost, suspicious, yearning and coming to maturity almost before 
our eyes. Even her smallest emotion is pure and real. 
</P>
<P>
As the baby's sweet, faintly dim father, another damaged kid, snub-nosed Kevin 
Dillon gives the picture's other solid performance. But the pure likability of 
these two creates the movie's only real conflict: We have a decent too-young 
couple who must give up their baby and, as the lucky recipients, a pair of 
cool, remote adults, two of the last people on earth you could see in mixing in 
the messy dailyness of parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
Even the music is specious. This isn't a musical score, it's connect-the-titles 
time -- every song asks a musical question that the screen then answers. When 
Close and Woods go through their infertility regimen, the song is "Creatures of 
Love." As Masterson slumps in dejection, Ray Charles croons "Young girls do get 
weary . . . try a little tenderness." The young couple slips away on a lyrical 
drive to "Motherless Children." And Van Morrison's "Into the Mystic" does 
double duty, but its most excruciating use comes when Close and Masterson dance 
to it, in a moment of ineffable bonding. 
</P>
<P>
This, from the usually thoughtful producing team of Midge Sanford and Sarah 
Pillsbury ("River's Edge," "Eight Men Out"), under Lawrence Kasdan's production 
banner, and from Kaplan, who has in the past looked at women with such detailed 
sensitivity ("Heart Like a Wheel," "The Accused"). How does the song go? "Say 
it isn't so. . . ."

A PLEASING ALLEN AND ASSANTE CAN'T SAVE 'ANIMAL BEHAVIOR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a warm sensibility and an engaging cast in "Animal Behavior" (opening 
today at the Century Plaza Cinemas and Edwards Island Cinema, Newport Beach), 
but it's too slight to recommend it. Dusted off after three years on the shelf 
since its completion, it's the kind of film you want to like -- and wish there 
was more to it to like. 
</P>
<P>
The ads are misleading, overemphasizing Holly Hunter's importance in the film. 
It's not Hunter but a chimpanzee who is standing in the way of Karen Allen and 
Armand Assante falling in love. Allen is Alex Bristow, a psychologist at a New 
Mexico university who is so intensely absorbed in an interspecies study with 
her adorable chimp, Michael, that she tries to persuade herself that she has no 
time for love, even though she is as attracted to Assante's Mark Mathias, the 
new music professor, as he is to her. Even though "Animal Behavior" was 
directed by two people, Jenny Bowen and Kjehl Rasmussen, the film's producer 
who replaced her, its problem seems mainly in Susan Rice's undeveloped script. 
Allen and Assante seem to keep playing the same scene over and over, with Alex 
pushing away Mark in the name of work. "Animal Behavior" is too talky by a mile 
yet it seems superficial. Throughout, there is the feeling that the film makers 
never quite decided how seriously to take Alex's research project or her 
attachment to Michael. We're never quite sure whether the chimp is, on some 
level, Mark's rival or whether Alex is simply a workaholic. 
</P>
<P>
Allen and Assante are so terrific together you regret that "Animal Behavior," 
goes for whimsy and sentimentality rather than the screwball humor and 
sophistication of "Bringing Up Baby." 
</P>
<P>
Holly Hunter, who made this film before "Broadcast News," has only a small role 
as Assante's good ol' gal neighbor, who has a mute little daughter taught to 
sign by the chimp. Actually, Josh Mostel has more to do as Mark's breezy 
sidekick, an art professor, and Richard Libertini scores as Alex's arrogant, 
jealous superior, a nasty academic with whom she had a fling when she was his 
student. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, 'Animal Behavior" (rated PG) is filled with repetitive and inane 
humor, culminating in a silly and contrived ending. It's not enough that Allen 
and Assante are such a pleasure.

A TV FREAK YOU CAN'T ESCAPE IN 'SHOCKER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wes Craven's "Shocker" (citywide) is a horror thriller about media technology 
infiltrated by a hellish maniac, an insane TV repairman named Horace Pinker 
(Mitch Pileggi), who converts himself into the phantom of the airwaves, leaping 
from TV to TV, program to program, body to body. 
</P>
<P>
Pinker -- like Craven's earlier villain, Freddy Krueger of the "Nightmare on 
Elm Street" series -- is a monster you can't get away from. In his human 
incarnation, he uses his job to gain entry to houses -- his repair van is 
emblazoned "We Do It in Your Home" -- and slaughters whole families. After he's 
caught and electrocuted, two events that barely faze him, he becomes something 
worse: the devil that steals souls and rides in electrical currents, the 
monster that hides in your TV, the demon of the media. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously this is a symbolic, satiric idea, and a good one. Craven is working 
over our paranoia of the media and especially TV: the way it manipulates us, 
takes over our lives, and the endless cornucopia of horrors -- wars, crimes, 
disasters -- that pour through its receivers. When we first see Pinker, he's a 
pair of disembodied hands working over some TV innards. The sets in his 
horror-gallery of a shop are always turned to riots, war or nuclear blasts. And 
when the movie's hero, quarterback Jonathan Parker (Peter Berg), fights him, he 
sometimes uses TV aerials, like a vampire hunter waving a cross. The movie 
suggests that the devil controls television and it also hints, bemusedly, that 
the only way to fight this scourge is with dreams, purity, love -- and a handy 
channel-changer. 
</P>
<P>
Craven, like David Cronenberg or George Romero, is a real virtuoso of 
lower-case horror, and "Shocker" is crammed with dazzling bursts of macabre 
technique. There's that couch-potato's nightmare: the moment when a reclining 
chair suddenly comes alive, possessed with Pinker, and tries to strangle Jon as 
he watches TV, or the shots of hero and villain diving in and out of sets, or 
the "Vertigo"-style chase on the station tower. Eeriest of all is one dream 
sequence where Jonathan passes a TV with a still shot of gray, endless rain and 
enters a bathroom where one wall has become a shower curtain concealing grisly 
secrets. 
</P>
<P>
However, it's in those dreams, strung through the entire movie, where "Shocker" 
goes wrong. Ever since he directed the first "Nightmare on Elm Street" in 1984, 
abandoning the sequels to others, Craven may be haunted by the fact that he 
made what many regard as the single scariest genre horror movie of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he keeps brewing up new bad dreams in different films, but he's 
never put them into as taut and compelling a structure as "Nightmare." 
"Shocker" is so diffusely organized it's almost three separate movies. The 
first: a fairly standard if stylish and over-gruesome slasher movie. The 
second: a dubious if hair-raisingly funny reprise of Jack Sholder's "The 
Hidden" -- with Pinker taking over one body after another. The third, the best 
and most imaginative, mixes up multi-plane nightmares with a modern variation 
on Buster Keaton's man-into-movie farce "Sherlock Jr." It's in the midsection 
that the symbolism breaks up completely. Pinker becomes a different kind of 
monster: controller of bodies and not electronics. 
</P>
<P>
As in most horror movies, the gore -- suggested more than emphasized -- and 
dark, raw jokes may drive away sensitive audiences. And the visuals tend to 
swallow up the actors, though Pileggi has moments of horrific hamminess, 
Timothy Leary pops up as a greed-crazed televangelist and the usually 
impeccable Michael Murphy gets a rare chance to roll his eyes and go berserk. 
But there's already a genre horror classic on TV paranoia, Cronenberg's 
"Videodrome," and "Shocker" (MPAA-rated R, for sex, language and violence) 
neither matches it nor Craven's own best. Maybe it's time he forgot about 
telling us his dreams, or simply took over the "Nightmare" series again, and 
let them run wild.

'HAD TO BE YOU' LOSES ITS WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In their play "It Had to Be You," Renee Taylor and Joseph Bologna offered a 
perfectly pleasant evening in the theater and enjoyed a long local run with it, 
but in bringing it to the screen, they've met with disaster. Never as strong as 
their durably hilarious 1971 "Made for Each Other," of which it is a variation, 
"It Had to Be You" citywide)just lies there and dies, an embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor casts herself as Theda Blau, a flashy, neurotic, garrulous, fad-ridden, 
no-talent, aging starlet who manages, through tortuous twists of fate, to trap 
Bologna's Vito Pignoli, an eligible, successful (but sour) advertising 
executive in her East Village flat on Christmas Eve. Theda is one of those 
obnoxious types who are supposed to be adorably irresistible underneath their 
desperation. 
</P>
<P>
But Theda is such a bore, such a dated, stereotyped self-demeaning kook, and so 
relentlessly grating that it defies credibility that Vito should fall for her, 
even if eventually he does get to see her in a new light. 
</P>
<P>
"It Had to Be You" might just have slid by had its writer/stars not also 
attempted to direct as well. Throughout, there's the feeling that they've given 
each other permission to let it all out. The effect is to make the film play 
like a miscalculated vanity production. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor and Bologna are too experienced to have indulged themselves as they so 
clearly have in "It Had to Be You" (rated R for mildly adult situations). Its 
only genuinely funny moment is a cameo by the wonderfully eccentric William 
Hickey as Theda's ancient agent who no sooner tells her he is going to make her 
a star or die trying, than he drops dead.

PRAGUE QUARTET OPENS GUILD SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The distinguished, veteran Prague String Quartet provided a dispirited, 
dispiriting opening on Wednesday to the new season of Music Guild concerts in 
the Wilshire Ebell Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Gleaming, robust ensemble tone and outdoorsy vitality rather than interpretive 
subtlety have always characterized the Czech ensemble's work. On this occasion, 
however, mechanical shortcomings were so obtrusive as to make interpretive 
considerations irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
Accurate intonation proved painfully elusive throughout the evening for first 
violinist Bretislav Novotny, inconsistent in many of cellist Jan Sirc's most 
exposed passages. The sum of the two players' problems was sufficient to be 
fatal to quartets by Haydn (in C, Opus 54, No. 2), Beethoven (in C minor, Opus 
18, No. 4) and Dvorak (the Prague's signature piece, the "American" Quartet). 
</P>
<P>
The notes proved less of an obstacle for second violinist Karel Pribyl -- a 
founder, with Novotny, of the ensemble in 1955. Pribyl's transgressions had 
more to do with consistently edgy tone and, in Beethoven, excessive volume, his 
part tending to swamp Novotny's. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the general chaos -- most notably in Dvorak -- the lush, secure viola of 
Lubomir Maly stood out in alarming relief: an unwitting reproach to its errant 
fellows. HERBERT GLASS

MEXICAN EXOTICA FEATURED AT THE EL PASO CANTINA GRILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deja mange . . . it starts out like a case of deja mange. A tart tomatillo 
sauce, a mild red chile sauce with a roasted flavor, fresh flour tortillas made 
by a slightly scary-looking tortilla-stamping machine at the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant, which utilizes the word grill in its name, is the showcase of a 
chain with Orange County roots. 
</P>
<P>
However, this is not the El Torito Grill but the El Paso Cantina Mexican Grill. 
It's not somewhere in Beverly Hills, but at the old 385 North location on La 
Cienega, brightly lit but with a dim (and underutilized) bar. 
</P>
<P>
And it doesn't claim to be Southwestern but attempts Authentic Mexican, to cite 
the title of a book by one of the authors of the menu. So the decor is 
grotesque Day of the Dead mask, not Navajo rug motif, and the food is not so 
much inventive as authentic exotic: say, jicama salad topped with pomegranate 
seeds. 
</P>
<P>
The appetizers might be the best part of the meal. Tortilla soup, filled with 
tortilla strips that virtually turn into fettuccine, is stunningly flavorful, 
the broth dark mahogany brown from ground dried chiles. One of the quesadillas 
is made with a smooth and mild goat cheese, sweetened with grilled red onions. 
Even things that are often boring are likely to be worth trying; the taquitos 
are for once genuinely crisp, and about as good as taquitos will ever get. 
</P>
<P>
Special appetizers might include gorditas, little corn masa cakes the size of a 
Ritz cracker split open and filled with guacamole and various meats. When 
tamales are offered, the rich, light masa might be stuffed with duck. Great 
fun. On the other hand, the Mexico City quesadillas are a little less 
interesting than they sound, being more like deep-fried turnovers. Call them 
smallish corn meal samosas filled with cheese. 
</P>
<P>
Entrees on the regular menu are limited to only tacos, enchiladas and burritos. 
To be sure, among the tacos you can order duck or catfish, and once in a while, 
on special, there's a rather beef-like venison marinated in hot pepper and 
cumin. The enchiladas, for their part, have meaty stuffings and a mouth-filling 
dark red chile sauce with a smoky, bittersweet flavor. 
</P>
<P>
The small regular menu might lead you to presume that the drama will be on the 
large list of entree specials. Well, yes, there is drama in several senses. A 
grilled game hen, marinated in garlic and sweet spices, is a big surprise: the 
meatiest and most flavorful game hen I've ever had. 
</P>
<P>
But the other specials are a very mixed bag. Scallops in spicy pipian verde 
sauce sounds interesting, but the sauce -- elegant though it was with its hint 
of anise -- had a thin, chilly quality. Duck breast in another version of 
pipian sauce, this one with chipotle peppers and ground pumpkin seeds, is more 
enjoyable. The question is exactly what this sauce has to do with duck. The 
rack of lamb in a pleasant, somewhat neutral cascabel pepper sauce has a 
faintly disagreeable smell, possibly some diabolical compound of the scorched 
exterior of the meat and the aromas of squash and beans. 
</P>
<P>
Tread a little carefully among the specials, say I. But the desserts, like the 
appetizers, are very good. Espresso ice cream deserves special notice for the 
strongest, truest coffee flavor you're ever likely to taste below room 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
But it should be noted that these desserts are not always autentico Mexican. 
True, you can get flan or fried plantains -- which are excellent, not mushy 
like the usual fried banana -- served with banana walnut ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the desserts, though, are things like chocolate pecan pie or 
apple-quince crisp topped with cinnamon ice cream. (Actually, the pie is 
nothing like an American pecan pie: it's just filled with chocolate and lots of 
pecans.) 
</P>
<P>
Deja mange, it ends like a case of deja mange. 
</P>
<P>
El Paso Cantina Mexican Grill, 385 N. La Cienega Blvd.; (213) 659-1533. Open 
for lunch Monday-Friday, for dinner nightly. Full bar. Valet parking. American

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: QUALITY OF SERVICE, DECIBEL LEVEL BOTH HIGH AT ANGELI MARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Perhaps having two working restaurants really makes a difference. For Angeli 
Mare, 13455 Maxella Ave., Marina del Rey, (213) 822-1984, not only opened on 
Monday as scheduled -- it opened with a certain smoothness. By Tuesday, when I 
got there, the place was frighteningly full for a new restaurant, but the food 
was coming out of the kitchen as if the staff had been together for months. 
</P>
<P>
The food is not dramatically different from that at the other Angelis -- except 
in one respect. In 
</P>
<P>
addition to the pizzas, pastas and salads of the other two, this Angeli offers 
a lot of fish. I particularly recommend the Tuscan fish soup, the grilled tuna 
and the squid risotto. 
</P>
<P>
I also recommend that you bring ear plugs. The architecture of this room is 
even more avant-garde than the other two. The room is wonderful; when you walk 
in the door, you feel as if you are entering the belly of a whale. Only this is 
a whale that roars. RUTH REICHL

MOVABLE FEASTS: CHICK'S: IN A ROTISSERIE LEAGUE BY ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
So this press release comes in the mail and -- eureka! -- you discover that the 
World's Largest Hand-Made Rotisserie Oven is not in Buenos Aires or Laredo but 
in, by gosh, Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Pretty soon you're staring at a monster copper vessel that looks like a prop 
from "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea," only it's filled with chickens 
spinning dizzily. So you remember that this is Chick's, an eat-in, take-out 
place, not some diorama at a Jacques Cousteau museum, and you go in. 
</P>
<P>
Now you're in line and, unsolicited, people start telling you "the chickens are 
fabulous here." There are lines each time you're there, but nobody seems to 
mind and when someone offers you a slice of the rotisserie-cooked honey ham, 
neither do you. Particularly since that ham is sweet and crusty and really 
significantly less fatty and salty than normal, just like the menu says. You 
recall that the press release kept mentioning "healthful dining," 
"wholesomeness" and the American Heart Assn. 
</P>
<P>
You study the menu more carefully and see that there's no asterisk (indicating 
American Heart Assn. approval) in front of the $4.99-per-pound ham so you do 
penance by ordering the *tacos asados (a little fiesta of shredded lean beef 
with smoky potatoes, grilled onions, cilantro and a dash of chile pepper, $1.75 
each), the *chicken fajitas (overmarinated with a big, honking green pepper 
taste and side of runny guacamole, $5.95), and the *rotisserie chicken, which 
turns out to be that perfect combination of crisp skin and moist, tender meat. 
</P>
<P>
The specialty of the house -- the no additives, no hormones chicken -- is 
served by the quarter (with side dishes), the half (with side dishes or a la 
carte) or whole. Eat a whole bird in the restaurant and you pay $9.99; order 
one to-go and it's $8.99. 
</P>
<P>
Chicken is not the only bird at Chick's. Twelve- and 16-pound turkeys, at 
$44.99 and $54.99, can be found twirling around in the giant avocado and 
eucalyptus firewood-fueled cooker. You order one 24 hours ahead, as protocol 
demands, and have a succulent series of meals. The big bird is tenderly 
marinated and lightly spiced, with great crackling skin. A good source for 
Thanksgiving. (Note: If you're salt-sensitive, ask your order-taker to go easy 
on the breast seasoning.) 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps barbecued pork does not thrill the council of cardiologists, but 
take-outers with a yen for meat would be happy with the side of smooth-sauced, 
tasty and lean baby-back ribs, though there's not terribly much meat. (At 
dinner, $9.99 buys nine or 10 ribs and one side order.) Beef ribs with the same 
gentle sauce are chewy. Imagine pot roast on a stick. (For $7.69 you get an 
order of ribs only; $8.25 gets you four ribs plus one side dish.) 
</P>
<P>
But if the barbecue ribs aren't perfect, you're happy that you ordered the 
barbecue soft tacos, both the rotisseried chicken and beef versions (two for 
$4.59). They're tangy, piled high with meat and very, very fresh. Waffled 
French fries, cut like a grid, are crisp and grease-free. Rotisserie-baked 
potatoes are good and crusty, though they come with margarine (there's no 
butter in them thar hills) and an imitation sour cream and chives. Beautiful 
bright disks of marinated carrots sport an American Heart validation, but their 
acidic marinade deserves only a black mark. Baked beans are ordinary; cole slaw 
and potato salad are light, fresh and as real as any pedigreed delicatessen 
variant in town. 
</P>
<P>
One more thing. If you start watching the handle of the World's Largest 
Hand-Made Rotisserie Oven turn over and over again as you wait for your order, 
prepare to get hypnotized. 
</P>

Fascination with light has led Peter Alexander from the black velvet depths of 
the ocean to the splashy horizon at sunset. His newest paintings unite sky and 
earth in a battle for luminous dominance as city lights crisscross the flat 
Southland basin under spectacular skies. 
</P>
<P>
These paintings are a strange juxtaposition of painterly heavens and 
airbrush-spotted terrestrial street lights. Each glows with its own intensity, 
ignoring the other and setting up an interesting contrast of power between the 
randomness of the elements and the strict structure of the city boulevards. The 
city lights, for all the attention that Alexander can bring to their cobweb 
luminosity, quickly get boring. But the expressionistic sweep of descending 
cloud banks has staying power, especially in the freakish yellow rift of 
lightning in the twilight sky over "Saugus." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander has played on the edge of camp for so long that we expect his work to 
tweak the nose of the art elite who disdain schmaltzy sunsets and paintings on 
black velvet. These newest paintings, with their yellowish runway lights that 
may even glow in the dark, suggest the kind of cliche photo postcards you buy 
at the airport. Rather than being a negative, however, that play with 
commercial democracy is the sly salvation of the work's romantic love affair 
with painted light. (James Corcoran Gallery, 1327 5th St., to Nov. 18.)SUVAN

Photographer Jerry Burchfield's Cibachrome mural-sized prints are enigmatic 
images that gently take on most of the issues and mind bending conundrums of 
modern society. Mildly political, they capture some of the disquiet of the 
modern psyche by offering an impression of the fear of death that haunts 
society within issues of abortion, ecology and random shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Burchfield's images are multi-paneled prints that result when the artist places 
various objects on photosensitized paper and outlines them with light. As 
brilliantly colored photograms, they weave poetic meaning from the visual clues 
of the odds and ends he assembles. Working like a phantom assemblage artist, 
Burchfield makes symbols that occasionally seem trite or get overly didactic -- 
as in the pictorial cycle of obsolescence in "The User/Interium Final." More 
evocative is the tension created by the shooting range target in the tree 
shaped crescents of "Abolishing Moonlight." An interesting use of language in 
"Seven Progressive Steps," a light drawing with cut out letter phrases, 
indicates the strength of the artist's feel for ambiguous threat. It's a 
promising direction. (Merging One Gallery, 1547 6th St., to Nov. 29.) SUVAN

Lauri Sing and Michael Brangoccio are two young painters who venture into 
different kinds of mixed-media formats, with vastly different results. Sing's 
work reads as dreamily introverted; Brangoccio's, as the product of an 
extrovert playing coy. 
</P>
<P>
In Sing's multipart constructions, dry, painted images of antique Greek statues 
on fabric-covered wood are juxtaposed with pieces of found wood and hinged 
sheets of rusting steel. Long, curving arcs cut into the wood resonate oddly 
with the veiled, intangible quality of the figures. The arcs suggest an 
astronomical reference. The antique figures are embodiments of harmony and 
proportion. Together, the abstract markings and the figures evoke a world of 
timeless order and mathematical perfection, compared with the "chaos" of the 
accidental drips and scuff marks. 
</P>
<P>
Brangoccio has a knack for design. The problem is that he doesn't differentiate 
between the superficially pretty, easy gesture and the kind of rewarding visual 
surprise that is more hard-won. His spare paintings incorporate collaged 
printed papers -- wallpaper, cigarette packets -- and calligraphic swoops of 
black paint on textured white surfaces. He'll isolate a single rose from a 
swatch of wallpaper ("Scandalize") or stipple a patch of rose paint with lots 
of wiggly little black strokes ("Rote Figur"). But these gestures are too 
self-consciously cute for their own good, as if he is listening for applause.

Keith Haring and William Burroughs? A partnership that sounds like Spy magazine 
shenanigans actually makes a lot of sense. The 31-year-old artist's street 
smart art turns out to be just the ticket to accompany brief works by the 
75-year-old author known for his nightmarish visions of the drug underworld and 
experimental prose style. The works in question are "Apocalypse," a breathless 
prose poem studded with quotes from T. S. Eliot, and "The Valley," a chapter 
from "The Western Lands." 
</P>
<P>
Haring's 10 silk screens for "Apocalypse" achieve a blend of jejune 
fancifulness, wild posturing and impudent borrowings from high culture -- much 
in the same vein as Burroughs' contribution. On a sheet illustrating a passage 
with the phrase "the Piper pulled down the sky," a figure whose head is the 
"Mona Lisa" reworked into a staring, zonked-out face reaches up to pluck a 
black net of scribbles from overhead. 
</P>
<P>
"The Valley" is about a colony of people with great musical talent who are 
trapped in a valley. They live largely on radioactive corn, which makes them 
die horrible deaths -- a tacit invocation of the specter of AIDS. In his suite 
of etchings, Haring's "graffiti" style gives the figures a rude, comic 
book-mythic quality that is as transparently effective as Burroughs' fable.

Before he took up film making in the 1970s, Swiss photographer Robert Frank 
toured the States capturing the grittiness of the 1950s blue collar continent. 
With an outsider's clarity of vision his stark gray images captured sullen 
people and their hard surroundings and told stories of a nation. 
</P>
<P>
Work he did in Europe as well as America is a strong testament to the fact 
Frank could make one image speak volumes. And the subject was always 
fascinatingly true, whether it was the huddled salesmen in the 1955 "Cadillac 
Showroom" that look like Mafia hit men or the couple delightedly steering a 
bumper car with their eyes squeezed shut. He caught the ironic beauty of tulips 
sold out of a suitcase in Paris and the mentality of segregation on a streetcar 
in New Orleans. Frank's subjects are human, always a complex but succinct 
composite of ideology and events. At least that's the way the artist made them 
appear -- as living symbols of a nation and an age. (Jan Kesner Gallery, 164 N. 
La Brea Ave., to Nov. 25.) SUVAN GEER

'UNRATED' TAPES RATE HIGH WITH RENTERS

While no theatrical blockbusters show up on this week's new-video schedule, 
there's no shortage of movies, including some "scandalous" imports. 
</P>
<P>
The most scandalous new videocassette is, in fact, "Scandal." This 1989 British 
film about the 1963 Profumo case was trimmed of some sexy scenes to gain an R 
rating in this country. Starring Joanne Whalley-Kilmer, John Hurt, Roland Gift 
and Bridget Fonda, "Scandal" is available from HBO in both R-rated (106 
minutes) and unrated (115 minutes) versions. 
</P>
<P>
It makes one wonder whether we will be seeing more films submitted to the 
Motion Picture Assn. of America with scenes that the producers know will earn 
an X rating, dutifully withdrawn and recut to gain an R-rated theatrical 
release, then released on video in both versions. Result: publicity for the 
film and the video, and a "hot" edge for the unrated, unedited version. 
</P>
<P>
This seems to happening most in the horror field. Latest example: "Leatherface: 
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III," which was resubmitted last week to avoid an X 
rating. Wonder what the chances are that the excised violent scenes will show 
up in an unrated video version in a few months? 
</P>
<P>
Other films new at your video store: 
</P>
<P>
If you howled at Pedro Almodovar's "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown," 
then you might like to rent the Bunuel-influenced Spanish director's offbeat 
and even darker 1986 film "Matador" (Cinevista, $79.95, unrated, subtitled), 
all about a retired matador and his decidedly strange activities and 
acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
Three years before making her Hollywood debut in "Intermezzo," Ingrid Bergman 
starred in the original Swedish version of the touching love story about a 
young pianist and the older, married man who falls for her. Directed by Gustav 
Molander, this subtitled 1936 "Intermezzo" (Crocus, $79.95) now joins its U.S. 
remake on the video shelves. 
</P>
<P>
SVS has three notable, subtitled Japanese films for $59.95 each: Akira 
Kurosawa's version of Gorky's grim social drama "The Lower Depths" (1957), 
Kenji Mizoguchi's portrait of a Japanese woman, "Osaka Elegy" (1936), and 
Hiroshi Teshigahara's "The Face of Another" (1966), which, like the new U.S. 
film "Johnny Handsome," concerns a once-disfigured man with a new face. 
</P>
<P>
The 1942 Italian drama "We the Living" (JCI, $79.95, two cassettes) is at least 
a curio for its cast (Rossano Brazzi, Alida Valli), its source (an Ayn Rand 
novel about love and betrayal in the Soviet Union of the 1920s), and its length 
(174 minutes). 
</P>
<P>
"Wonderwall: The Movie" (Studio, $79.95) was an unsuccessful 1968 British 
picture that will probably be of most interest now to Beatles fans, since 
George Harrison, with a little help from friends such as Eric Clapton and Ravi 
Shankar, contributed the score. 
</P>
<P>
This week's smaller domestic crop includes "Leviathan" (MGM/UA, $89.95, R), 
which took the "Alien" plot under water with stars Peter Weller and Amanda Pays 
but without the craftsmanship of another '89 beneath-the-waves sci-fi film, 
"The Abyss"; and "Lost Angels" (Orion, $89.98, R), a Hugh Hudson-directed drama 
about a troubled young man, starring Donald Sutherland and Adam Horovitz (of 
the Beastie Boys). 
</P>
<P>
OTHER NEW VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
Fans of that one-of-a-kind 1966-71 afternoon soap opera/horror series "Dark 
Shadows" will be happy to know that MPI is offering "The Resurrection of 
Barnabas Collins" ($29.95), a two-hour tape featuring an overview of the series 
and the first five episodes, and the "Dark Shadows Three-Pack," three cassettes 
containing five episodes each sold as a set only ($79.95). TERRY ATKINSON

What are the 10 scariest movies ever made? 
</P>
<P>
When it gets close to Halloween, that question oftens pop ups among film fans. 
The average movie-goer probably has a list. So does the Horror Film Buffs 
Society, a small, informal group of horror-film fanatics who have seen just 
about all the movies in the genre. 
</P>
<P>
They guarantee that, if you watch any of their Top 10 fright flicks on 
Halloween night, you'll be shivering and quivering. They've assigned a 
Frightmeter rating to their selections -- 10 for the scariest. 
</P>
<P>
All except one are available on home video. 
</P>
<P>
1. "The Night of the Living Dead" (1968, Active, Congress). An inexpensive 
movie with an obscure cast that, when first released, seemed like a grade-C 
flick destined for immediate oblivion. But director George Romero's debut 
feature turned out to be one of the most influential horror movies ever made. 
About flesh-eating corpses attacking some people in a farmhouse, it looks 
grainy and somewhat cheap, but that doesn't interfere with its ability to scare 
the living daylights out of you. Frightmeter: 10. 
</P>
<P>
2. "Psycho" (1960, MCA). By now everyone knows that Norman Bates (Tony Perkins) 
is a psychotic mama's boy and that the Bates Motel harbors an ugly secret. But 
the famous shower scene, in which a pretty young woman (Janet Leigh) is stabbed 
to death, and the last third of the movie still generate plenty of chills. 
Directed by Alfred Hitchcock and co-starring Vera Miles. Frightmeter: 10. 
</P>
<P>
3. "The Innocents" (1961). The only one of the Horror Buffs selections that's 
not on home video. Based on Henry James' "Turn of the Screw," this may be the 
best ghost story ever filmed. It's about a governess (Deborah Kerr) terrorized 
by ghosts. Throughout, you're on edge -- just like she is -- because you don't 
know when one will materialize. Directed by Jack Clayton and co-written by 
Truman Capote. Frightmeter: 10. 
</P>
<P>
4. "Nightmare on Elm Street" (1984, Media). Before Freddy Krueger became a 
pop-culture hero, he was the dream demon in this brilliantly conceived tale, 
which plays upon everyone's fears of nightmares. A teen-oriented slaughter 
film, directed by Wes Craven, it's many notches above the junk in the genre. 
The sequels aren't nearly as scary. Frightmeter: 10. 
</P>
<P>
5. "The Omen" (1976, CBS-Fox). Strange things begin to happen to a couple 
(Gregory Peck and Lee Remick) after their young boy, Damien, is born. They have 
a devil of a time with this sinister kid, who's the Antichrist. This one is 
chock full of scary scenes, including the attack of the devil dogs in the 
graveyard and the stunning decapitation. The two sequels are pure trash. 
Frightmeter: 9. 
</P>
<P>
6. "The Fly" (1986, CBS-Fox). A gruesome, often sickening account of a 
scientist (Jeff Goldblum) who, through an experiment gone awry, slowly turns 
into a fly. This one features some genuinely horrifying moments. The birth 
scene, in which the scientist's girlfriend (Geena Davis) conceives something 
unspeakable, is a gross-out classic. Frightmeter: 9. 
</P>
<P>
7. "Alien" (1979, CBS-Fox). A slimy, grotesque creature gets on board a space 
ship and slowly murders its crew. The scene in which the alien pops out of a 
crew member's stomach and scampers away is an unforgettable shocker. Directed 
by Ridley Scott and starring Sigourney Weaver. Frightmeter: 9. 
</P>
<P>
8. "Aliens" (1986, CBS-Fox). In this gripping, scary sequel, Weaver and a new 
crew return to outer space to investigate what happened to her colleagues and 
encounter dozens of the slimy creatures. The second half is non-stop terror and 
suspense. Frightmeter: 9. 
</P>
<P>
9. "The Thing" (1982, MCA). A horrifying creature terrorizes a research station 
in Antarctica in this suspenseful remake -- directed by John Carpenter and 
starring Kurt Russell -- of the famed 1951 movie. It features one of the most 
hideous monsters in film history and is guaranteed to give you nightmares. The 
original, available from Nostalgia Merchant, doesn't seem very scary now. 
Frightmeter: 9. 
</P>
<P>
10. "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (1956, Republic). Easily the best of the 
'50s sci-fi thrillers, this one is subtle but still scary, with the suspense 
building slowly and steadily. It's about a small town taken over by aliens who 
appear in the form of pods and replace the townsfolk with doubles. Directed by 
Don Siegel and starring Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter. Frightmeter: 8.

LESSONS TO BE LEARNED FOR 'SINGLE WOMEN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
So poor Susan, recently divorced and now newly doctorized in the psychotherapy 
business, meets architect Ross -- handsome, warm, sensitive, charming, witty 
and knowledgeable about wine. Next up, a Nobel Prize for great guy. 
</P>
<P>
Susan starts ministering to a group of women entangled with married men -- and 
discovers that Mr. Perfecto is likewise married! 
</P>
<P>
Therein lies "Single Women, Married Men," which replaces "Dallas" and "Falcon 
Crest" on CBS tonight at 9. Michele Lee is Susan and Lee Horsley is Ross. 
</P>
<P>
The essences of the story and subplots were borrowed from San Diego therapist 
JoAnn Bitner, who says that her first husband philandered and then, after the 
divorce, she fell in love with a married man. (We called and she told us that 
her boyfriend didn't look like Horsley: "I should be so lucky.") 
</P>
<P>
Bitner developed a "support group" for mistresses afflicted with married men, 
as in our story, and executive producer-star Lee suggested this endeavor, which 
is justified by a statistic cited by one character that "70% of women in major 
cities have at least one sexual experience with a married man." 
</P>
<P>
Wow, if these women watched the show, the ratings would. . . . 
</P>
<P>
There are lessons to be learned, particularly in the accumulation of gnarled 
rationales that people work out for their romance lives. But for all its 
probable truths, the movie seems measured and false, mostly the fault of 
insipid dialogue. And the glossy look on everybody is very distracting. The 
clothing budget could have dressed San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
The dilemmas are delicately if not totally resolved here. But Woody Allen has 
another concept in his current feature, "Crimes and Misdemeanors." Mistress 
Dolores (Anjelica Huston) threatens to tell Judah's wife about their affair and 
Judah (Martin Landau) has her killed.IRV LETOFSKY

SOVIETS TO MOVE NUCLEAR SUBS OUT OF BALTIC 
</P>

<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced Thursday that the Soviet Union will 
withdraw all its nuclear-armed submarines from the Baltic Sea in a step toward 
making Northern Europe a nuclear-free zone. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, pressing the Kremlin's overall disarmament drive and its goal of a 
world eventually free of nuclear weapons, said the Soviet Union has already 
removed or repositioned all its tactical nuclear missiles capable of striking 
Northern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Soviet Union is also preparing to "eliminate certain classes of 
sea-launched nuclear weapons," presumably cruise missiles, from the Baltic Sea 
region. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leader, who is visiting Finland, said the Soviet initiatives are 
intended to give momentum to the movement to rid the Baltic and, if possible, 
all Northern Europe of nuclear arms. 
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to come to an agreement with all the nuclear powers and the 
Baltic states on effective guarantees for the nuclear-free status of the Baltic 
Sea," Gorbachev said, addressing 1,500 Finnish politicians, businessmen and 
community leaders in Helsinki, the Finnish capital. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Soviet Union is taking these steps to follow up a speech he made 
two years ago in the Soviet port of Murmansk proposing a nuclear-free zone in 
Northern Europe as well as other measures to reduce East-West tensions in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The measures were unilateral, he said, and no longer conditioned on Western 
agreement on a nuclear-free zone in the region. 
</P>
<P>
The moves, although welcomed in Helsinki and most other Scandinavian capitals, 
were met with skepticism in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe that nuclear-free zones contribute to security in Europe," 
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, said. "Most of these 
proposals have been designed to affect (the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization's) deterrence capability while leaving Soviet nuclear weapons 
intact." 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating a negative U.S. reaction, Gorbachev addressed Washington directly 
and said, "Let us meet halfway on the wish of the peoples in Northern Europe to 
turn their countries into a reliable flank of a European and worldwide system 
of security." 
</P>
<P>
In his 1987 Murmansk speech, Gorbachev endorsed a Finnish proposal for a 
nuclear-free zone in Northern Europe, centering on the 148,600-square-mile 
Baltic Sea. The two NATO countries in the region, Norway and Denmark, do not 
permit nuclear weapons in their territory in peacetime, and the other two 
countries, Finland and Sweden, are neutral. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union started by removing from operational status two Golf-class 
submarines, and before the end of 1990 it will destroy the four remaining 
submarines of the same class," Gorbachev said Thursday. "We will also destroy 
their standard nuclear missile payloads, and we have no plans for their 
replacement." 
</P>
<P>
Six Golf II subs, 321 feet long with a displacement of 2,950 tons, have been 
deployed in the Baltic Sea since 1976, according to Jane's Fighting Ships, the 
authoritative British naval reference. Soviet commentators have said the 
submarines each carried 18 ballistic missiles. 
</P>
<P>
The Golf II, increasingly obsolete, has slowly been withdrawn from service, and 
Western naval attaches here contend that those still in use are largely 
bargaining chips in arms-reduction negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not only old and inefficient but they are becoming more and more 
dangerous as their operating systems deteriorate," a NATO submariner here said. 
"Every one still in service could be withdrawn without any diminution of Soviet 
naval strength or strategic capability." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev noted the sharp, unilateral reductions in Soviet and Warsaw Pact 
forces over the last year and the shift of the remaining units into a defensive 
posture. 
</P>
<P>
"In the northern region, their transformation in this direction will be 
completed next year," he said. "The numerical strength of Soviet land forces on 
the Soviet-Finnish border is now less than the total numerical strength of land 
forces in Finland. 
</P>
<P>
"It can be said with certainty that the military-political situation in the 
north has greatly improved. An attack or an outbreak of armed conflict in the 
area is out of the question." 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging the strong Scandinavian concern about Soviet naval and air units 
based on and around the Kola Peninsula, the headquarters of the Soviet Union's 
powerful Northern Fleet, Gorbachev said these are strategic forces whose fate 
depends on negotiations with the United States on a 50% reduction in strategic 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
But he suggested that countries of the region pursue their own negotiations on 
various confidence-building measures and other agreements on naval activities 
in the seas of Northern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said the Soviet Union will accept, for example, Norway's proposal for 
negotiations to establish procedures for the mutual notification of accidents 
involving ships, including nuclear-powered submarines. Three Soviet 
nuclear-powered submarines have been involved in accidents since April in the 
Barents and Norwegian seas. 
</P>
<P>
Finnish officials welcomed Gorbachev's announcements, and they are assured of a 
warm reception even in Norway and Denmark, the region's NATO members. They are 
also likely to win support among political groups in the Baltic republics of 
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, where pressure has been building for the removal 
of nuclear weapons from the region. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech Thursday, Gorbachev effectively ended four decades of relentless 
Soviet pressure on Finland to avoid offending Moscow in any way through a 
policy known as "Finlandization." 
</P>
<P>
Finland's neutrality, established in a 1948 treaty of friendship and 
cooperation with the Soviet Union, had caused "ripples in the past," Gorbachev 
said, and retains "distinct features." 
</P>
<P>
"But what I wish to stress most firmly is that the Soviet Union unconditionally 
recognizes Finland's neutral status," he declared, "and it will continue to 
observe it in the future in full measure." 
</P>
<P>
Discussing the next meeting on the 1975 Helsinki Accords, which formulated a 
new relationship between East and West based on expanding contacts, increasing 
trade and reducing tension, he suggested that a summit conference be held in 
1992 in Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev also opened the possibility for direct contacts between legislators 
in the Soviet Union's Baltic republics and the Scandinavian countries grouped 
in the Nordic Council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COUNTERPOINT 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet proposal for a "nuclear-free" northern Europe is less than meets the 
eye, critics say. The four nuclear submarines that Moscow plans to withdraw 
from the Baltic Sea were headed for the scrap heap anyway. In July, the Kremlin 
indicated it will eliminate all its Golf-class submarines because they are 
outdated, said Richard Sharpe, editor of the authoritative Jane's Fighting 
Ships. Losing the whole Golf fleet would not significantly hurt Soviet military 
capability, other experts say. In any event, many U.S. experts believe NATO 
needs the nuclear option to offset the superior conventional forces of the 
Warsaw Pact. A nuclear-free zone thus would hurt NATO more than it hurts the 
East Bloc, they say, and actually destabilizes Europe. "The United States 
remains opposed to the concept of nuclear-free zones in Europe, or in waters 
surrounding Europe, because we think such zones do not make a real contribution 
to preserving European security and stability," the White House said late 
Thursday.

CHINA OFFICERS AGAIN WORK IN U.S. ON ARMS 
</P>

<P>
Over the last four weeks, the Bush Administration has permitted Chinese 
military officers to return to work in the United States on the ground-breaking 
$500-million arms sales program from which they were excluded after the Chinese 
army's bloody crackdown on student demonstrations last June. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese officers' quiet return to a U.S. military base and to facilities of 
the Grumman Corp. reflects an effort by the Administration to minimize the 
impact of the sanctions against China that were imposed as a protest against 
the Chinese army's suppression of the pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the June 3-4 massacre in Beijing, President Bush ordered a 
suspension of all U.S. military sales to China and of all visits between U.S. 
and Chinese military leaders. At that time, Chinese military officers who had 
come to the United States for the mammoth program to upgrade China's F-8 
fighter planes were told to stop reporting for work. A few stayed on here, but 
most of them returned home last summer. 
</P>
<P>
However, spokesmen for the Grumman Corp. in Bethpage, L.I., and at 
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base outside Dayton, Ohio, confirmed that Chinese 
officers were allowed to resume work in both facilities earlier this month. The 
F-8 modernization program, which has the code name "Peace Pearl," is by far the 
largest single military cooperation program between the United States and 
China. 
</P>
<P>
"It was determined by the U.S. government that they (the Chinese military 
personnel) are needed," explained a Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Edward 
Lundquist. "They were authorized to return in October. You can assume that the 
decision was fully coordinated by the Defense Department, the State Department, 
the White House and National Security Council." 
</P>
<P>
"We can't proceed without the participation of some Chinese engineering and 
maintenance personnel," Lundquist said. ". . . To the best of my knowledge, the 
purpose here is not for training (of the Chinese). But training may be part of 
the overall package. There may be a fine line between them learning something 
and providing the technical support we need." 
</P>
<P>
Since June, the presence of the Chinese military officers in the United States 
has been so sensitive that some U.S. Air Force personnel have gone to 
extraordinary lengths to conceal it. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, local police arrested a Chinese military officer for shoplifting at 
a department store in Kettering, Ohio, near Wright-Patterson. Within hours, the 
U.S. Air Force colonel supervising the F-8 fighter division there paid the 
Chinese officer's bail and helped hire a lawyer who succeeded in getting 
criminal charges dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
When the Dayton Daily News sought access to the records of this case, the 
defense attorney -- who is a retired Air Force officer -- persuaded the judge 
to seal all the records of the incident. An Ohio appeals court ruled last week 
that the Dayton newspaper is entitled to examine these records. 
</P>
<P>
Lundquist, the Pentagon spokesman, asserted that "the Department of Defense was 
not involved" in bailing out the Chinese officer or in sealing arrest records 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy who bailed him out was an employee of the Air Force Aeronautical 
Systems Division, acting as a private citizen and as a friend, and not on the 
direction or authorization of the Department of Defense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In June, when the Bush Administration announced that it was freezing military 
sales to China, Administration officials said the President's action would 
apply to $600 million in arms that previously had been ordered by China from 
the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very important the Chinese leaders know it's not going to be business as 
usual," Bush explained at the time. "The United States cannot condone the 
violent attacks (by the Chinese army)." 
</P>
<P>
After the embargo was announced, Defense Department officials confirmed that it 
would have limited impact because it would stop only the final delivery of U.S. 
military equipment to China. They said that the development work on arms-sale 
programs would go forward on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Project Peace Pearl, the program in which the United States is selling advanced 
avionics equipment to upgrade China's F-8 jets, is still in the development 
stage. The first shipment of the avionics equipment is not scheduled until 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
Grumman, the Long Island firm that has the main contract for Peace Pearl, kept 
its 250 employees on the job. However, on June 5, immediately after Bush's 
freeze order, Grumman told 40 Chinese nationals working alongside the Americans 
"that it was their last day, that they had to discontinue coming to work," said 
Grumman official Miriam Reid. 
</P>
<P>
Two Chinese military officers who had been working as liaison officers for the 
F-8 fighter program at Wright-Patterson Air Base were also told to stop coming 
to work. The Air Force unit that runs Project Peace Pearl and supervises the 
contract with Grumman is stationed at the Ohio air base. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, there were only two here," said Mike Wallace, a spokesman at 
Wright-Patterson. "They were not kicked off the base, but they were told they 
could not work in the office. They still had access to the commissary, the base 
exchange, and so forth." On Sept. 6, the arrest of the Chinese military officer 
for shoplifting occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Over the summer, 35 Chinese nationals barred from working at Grumman went home. 
The other five remained in this country. 
</P>
<P>
According to Reid, the Grumman spokesman, these five were allowed to return to 
work on Oct. 2. This week, another 18 Chinese officials have arrived at Grumman 
to begin long-term work on the F-8 program, and 10 more Chinese officers made a 
two-day visit to the Long Island facility. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese are back at work, both at (Wright-Patterson) and at Grumman," said 
Wallace. "They were authorized to return at the beginning of October." 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to continue the work," said Lundquist, the Pentagon spokesman. 
"Whether the aircraft will be delivered when the work is done, that's between 
the Chinese government and the U.S. government." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the $500-million F-8 avionics program, the arms deals with China 
supposedly covered by Bush's freeze order include another $100 million in 
radar, artillery modernization, torpedoes and torpedo launchers for the Chinese 
armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
However, some of this equipment already had been shipped from the United States 
to China before the Administration's freeze order was imposed, and other 
materiel is still being manufactured for future deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
The freeze on military sales to China was one of several sanctions that the 
Bush Administration imposed after the People's Liberation Army broke up the 
democracy demonstrations at Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other Administration actions was a suspension of any exchanges 
between U.S. officials and the Chinese government at the rank of assistant 
secretary or higher. But the impact of this sanction also was eased when the 
Bush Administration later decided that it applied only to official visits 
between Washington and Beijing, and not to contacts between U.S. and Chinese 
leaders in other locations. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Secretary of State James A. Baker III met with Chinese Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen in Paris and at the United Nations, and outgoing Chinese 
Ambassador Han Xu saw Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle and Baker before leaving 
Washington last summer. This week, the White House announced that an upcoming 
visit to China by former President Richard M. Nixon is being closely 
coordinated with the White House.

HOUSE OKS FUNDS FOR WAR INTERNEES; 
</P>
<P>
REPARATIONS: THE PAYMENTS TO JAPANESE-AMERICANS WOULD START NEXT YEAR. SENATE 
MUST NOW ACT ON THE BILL.

<P>
Overriding objections by budget conservatives, the House voted Thursday to 
begin making $1.2 billion in reparation payments next year to 
Japanese-Americans interned during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a day of reckoning for the House on the issue of redress," said Rep. 
Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento). "I consider the outcome a major victory not 
only for those who were interned but for the country. It's clear now that 
Congress has lived up to its moral obligation." 
</P>
<P>
Already passed by the Senate and now approved by the House, 249 to 166, the 
bill provides for $20,000 to be paid to each of the estimated 60,000 surviving 
internees over a three-year period. The first $500 million will be available to 
the oldest internees next October, the start of the 1991 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Another $500 million will be paid in 1992, with the remaining $200 million to 
be paid the following year. 
</P>
<P>
The payments, authorized by a 1988 law but never funded previously, were 
included as an entitlement program in a $17.2-billion appropriations bill for 
the departments of Commerce, Justice and State. As an entitlement, the payments 
would be guaranteed just as Social Security checks and funding for Medicare are 
guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the House fight against the measure, Rep. Harold Rogers (R-Ky.) said 
that, while no one disputes the need for the payments, other spending should 
have higher priority. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you elevate these payments above child care? Are they more important than 
fighting drugs? More important than education?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
The bill now moves back to the Senate, which must give its final approval to 
the overall package before sending it to the White House for President Bush's 
signature. 
</P>
<P>
"We have received no indication yet of the President's position, but we expect 
him to sign the legislation, assuming he has no problems with the rest of the 
appropriations bill," an aide to Rep. Norman Y. Mineta (D-San Jose) said. 
</P>
<P>
The House vote followed an emotional debate that pitted what proponents of the 
payments said is a moral obligation to redress the wrongs done to 
Japanese-Americans against the needs of other programs that, some conservatives 
argued, should have a higher funding priority. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a lot of shuffling around on how to pay for this but the House 
vote finally settles that issue," one of Matsui's aides added. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 1988 Civil Liberties Act, Congress voted to pay each of the surviving 
Japanese-American internees $20,000 as compensation for their internment during 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Funding remained a problem, however, until the Senate earlier this year agreed 
to turn the payments into an entitlement program. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the House has concurred with the decision, the way is clear for 
Congress "to disperse the redress compensation as quickly as possible," said 
Mineta, who, as a child, was interned in one of the camps. 
</P>
<P>
Under the three-year payment plan adopted by the Senate and approved by the 
House, the $20,000 in reparations will be sent to surviving internees according 
to a priority list based on seniority, with the oldest survivors receiving 
compensation first. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the payments have noted that, as a result of their advanced age, 
about 200 former internees are dying every month -- a mortality rate that lends 
urgency to the need to compensate them as the law requires. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, many of the interned will die before their payments arrive 
because budgetary restraints this year have forced the payments to be delayed," 
Matsui said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Some 120,000 Japanese-Americans were rounded up and interned after the bombing 
of Pearl Harbor -- an action that many lawmakers have labeled an "American 
shame." In 1988, Congress passed a law to compensate the estimated 60,000 
surviving internees with payments of $20,000 each. But funding problems, along 
with arguments about higher budgetary priorities, have delayed the payments.

WHITE HOUSE, SENATORS SAID TO AGREE ON COVERT POLICY 
</P>

The White House and the Senate Intelligence Committee have reached agreement on 
rules that would allow the Bush Administration to conduct covert intelligence 
operations without notifying Congress within 48 hours, as currently required, 
sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, sources said, the Administration also has come to 
terms with the committee on future U.S. participation in any attempt to 
overthrow Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
One source said that Bush and the lawmakers now agree that U.S. officials are 
free to consult and advise coup plotters as long as assassination is not a 
stated goal of the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was criticized by many members of Congress for his decision to provide 
only limited assistance to the organizers of the unsuccessful Oct. 3 coup. 
</P>
<P>
The change in policy on congressional notification also could enhance the 
Administration's efforts to oust Noriega, according to one source. "This gives 
us a little more flexibility" in anti-Noriega operations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the CIA or other U.S. operatives would be allowed to 
conduct covert activities, and the Administration would not be committed to 
notifying Congress about the operations within 48 hours, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, the White House would either provide lawmakers with prior notice 
or notify them "in a few days," said the source, speaking on condition that he 
not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
In some situations, however, notification could be withheld longer, provided 
that it was done "in a timely fashion," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
In even more unusual circumstances, the Administration could refrain from 
giving any notification to Congress if the President asserted that his 
constitutional prerogatives permitted such a course. 
</P>
<P>
The long-running dispute was fueled by the Iran-Contra operation, under which 
arms were sold during the Reagan Administration to Iran in hopes of winning the 
release of Americans held hostage in Lebanon, and the proceeds were forwarded 
to the Contra forces in Nicaragua. The Reagan Administration did not notify 
Congress of the activities for about 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
The source said the new agreement was reached Wednesday in meetings between 
White House National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Senate Intelligence 
Committee Chairman David L. Boren (D-Okla.) and Vice Chairman William S. Cohen 
(R-Me.). 
</P>
<P>
The senators presented details of the agreement to the full committee Thursday. 
The committee, in turn, dropped from an intelligence funding bill a requirement 
that the President notify Congress of all covert actions within 48 hours. The 
bill was reported out of committee and now goes to the full Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which was to be outlined in a letter from Bush to the Senate 
committee, apparently eliminates the possibility of a presidential veto based 
on Bush's opposition to a rigid 48-hour reporting requirement. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate bill also would set up a statutory inspector general at the CIA 
instead of an in-house inspector under the control of the director. The 
inspector general would be appointed by the President. 
</P>
<P>
A series of executive orders dating to the Ford Administration prohibit U.S. 
operatives from taking part in assassinations abroad. Pentagon sources said the 
Justice Department has been directed to clarify U.S. culpability if a foreign 
leader is killed in a coup attempt in which the United States plays a role, 
either directly or indirectly. 
</P>
<P>
A Justice Department draft states that the United States is not responsible if 
a death is unintentional or if Washington does not have advance knowledge that 
an assassination by local forces is planned, according to an Administration 
source who has seen the paper. 
</P>
<P>
But the official cautioned that the paper, now circulating among the agencies, 
deals largely with the specific policy issue that arose from the coup attempt 
against Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of other permutations," such as the deaths of terrorists or drug dealers 
during covert operations to free hostages or eradicate narcotics crops, "still 
have not been addressed by the Justice Department," the source said.

Charles Ng, wanted in California on 12 murder charges in a string of grisly 
sex-torture slayings, Thursday was ordered extradited by Canadian Justice 
Minister Doug Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
But Ng, who lost one previous round of appeals in the courts, still has legal 
avenues open to stay in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Ng, 29, a former Marine, is charged with committing the crimes in 1985 at the 
remote mountain home of a companion, Leonard Lake, in Wilseyville in Calaveras 
County. 
</P>
<P>
According to state and local investigators and hundreds of pages of court 
documents and evidence filed in Calaveras County, Ng and Lake have been linked 
to about two dozen slayings. The evidence includes at least one videotape of a 
murder victim. 
</P>
<P>
Lake committed suicide in June, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1985, Ng was apprehended in Calgary, Alberta, during a scuffle with a 
department store security guard in which the guard was shot. Ng was convicted 
of attempted murder and is serving a 4 1/2-year sentence in Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
California has cited as grounds for extradition 19 of 25 criminal charges that 
have been filed against Ng. Of the 19, 12 are for capital murder and the rest 
involve kidnaping, burglary and attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the U.S.-Canada extradition treaty, Canada may refuse an 
extradition request unless state authorities in the United States assure Canada 
that the death penalty will not be imposed. 
</P>
<P>
However, Justice Minister Lewis said in a letter to Ng's lawyer: "I am 
satisfied that it is in the public interest to surrender Ng to the United 
States without seeking (death penalty) assurances." 
</P>
<P>
If fugitives charged with murder believed that they could avoid the death 
penalty by fleeing to Canada, Lewis added, the country "would become a safe 
haven for such criminals." He said the government could not ignore the reality 
that the long border between the two countries affords many opportunities for 
fugitives to "move quickly, easily and frequently between both countries." 
</P>
<P>
Canadian Department of Justice spokeswoman Helene Ouellet said that Ng could be 
extradited to the United States in a "couple of days," although she said the 
process could be delayed if Ng files an appeal in Canadian federal court.

N.Y. MAYOR'S RACE DRAWS NATIONAL PARTISAN INTEREST; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: ELECTION OF A REPUBLICAN MAYOR IN THE NATION'S LARGEST CITY COULD 
CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR A POSSIBLE PRESIDENTIAL BID BY GOV. MARIO M. CUOMO.

<P>
The increasingly close mayoral race in New York City has become a high-stakes 
political battleground, as the White House and the Democratic National 
Committee are trying to affect the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
When Republican Rudolph W. Giuliani's mayoral campaign was on the verge of 
running out of money recently, President Bush came to the rescue, raising $1.5 
million at a dinner in Manhattan that allowed the candidate's commercials to 
remain on the air. 
</P>
<P>
First Lady Barbara Bush will host a luncheon for Giuliani next week, and three 
Cabinet secretaries plus White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu will be in 
New York to give the Republican contender more support. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of 
Massachusetts are campaigning for David N. Dinkins, the Democratic mayoral 
candidate. Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey is expected to campaign 
for Dinkins soon, and New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Democratic Sen. Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan campaigned at Dinkins' side Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for the intense national interest plays into nascent 
presidential politics. The election of a Republican mayor in the nation's 
largest city could send a cannon shot across the bow of any presidential 
ambitions Cuomo may harbor. 
</P>
<P>
An activist mayor of another party would be in a strong position to be a 
political thorn in the governor's side, distracting Cuomo from national issues 
and limiting out-of-state travel. 
</P>
<P>
Previous mayoral-gubenatorial squabbles have damaged presidential hopes. Mayor 
John V. Lindsay bitterly fought with former Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, and 
Lindsay's criticism of Rockefeller for failing to call out the National Guard 
during a bitter garbage strike in New York City reverberated nationally. When 
Rockefeller ran for President, conservative Republicans attacked the reluctance 
of the governor to summon the Guard. 
</P>
<P>
Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans in New York City by five 
to one. And in an effort to mobilize his natural Democratic base, Dinkins has 
sought to picture Giuliani as a creature of "Reagan Republicanism," uncaring 
about the plight of the inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Cuomo once again underlined that theme when he appeared with Mayor 
Edward I. Koch and Moynihan at a rally for Dinkins in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
"The national Republicans, who have announced they want to establish a new 
beachhead . . . in New York by winning this election, have declared war on our 
cities for the past eight years," Cuomo charged. 
</P>
<P>
In a new Dinkins commercial, Kennedy attacked Giuliani for calling for a 
reversal of the Roe vs. Wade U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. 
Giuliani changed his position on abortion during the campaign. He now supports 
the right of a woman to have an abortion, plus public financing of abortions 
for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
When President Bush first praised Giuliani at a Republican dinner early in the 
campaign, he mispronounced the candidate's name. But at a dinner for Giuliani 
this month, he was a potent fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
And as polls showed the race growing tighter, Sununu and three Cabinet 
secretaries, Jack Kemp of Housing and Urban Development, Samuel K. Skinner of 
Transportation and Nicholas F. Brady of Treasury, have scheduled fund-raising 
events for Giuliani in New York. 
</P>
<P>
A spate of polls was made public Thursday. A survey for New York Newsday 
conducted by the Gallup Organization gave Dinkins a 12-point lead, but a 
WNBC-TV/New York Post poll put the Democrat's lead at only 5 points, in line 
with a recent Daily News-WABC-TV poll showing a 4-point lead.

BUSH UNVEILS PROPOSALS TO PROTECT FOOD SUPPLY; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY: CRITICS TAKE BITTER ISSUE WITH MAKING TOLERANCE LEVELS FOR VARIOUS 
PESTICIDES UNIFORM ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 
</P>

<P>
Unveiling his controversial plan to overhaul the nation's pesticide control 
laws, President Bush on Thursday vowed to keep the United States' food supply 
the safest in the world. But key elements of the plan were immediately attacked 
by environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative, which requires congressional approval, would cut by as much as 
half the time required to get a dangerous pesticide off the market, would 
tighten pesticide registration procedures and would expand the definition of 
hazards. It also would stiffen sanctions against violators. 
</P>
<P>
However, critics immediately took bitter issue with several other elements in 
the plan, including a proposal to make tolerance levels for various pesticides 
uniform across the country. Some states, particularly California, currently 
impose stricter standards than the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists also objected to Bush's new "negligible risk" standard for 
approving pesticides used on food crops. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, regulations put acceptable cancer risks at 1 in a million, based on 
a lifetime of exposure to a compound. In other words, the standard calculates 
the chance of the pesticide causing 1 cancer that otherwise would not occur 
among 1 million people exposed. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Bush "negligible risk" standard, the Environmental Protection Agency 
would be allowed to assess risk at between 1 in 100,000 and 1 in a million, 
depending on various factors. Although EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said 
that 1 in a million will remain the standard for the majority of cases, the 
potential for relaxation of the standard brought swift reaction. 
</P>
<P>
The lower limit, noted Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the 
House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and the environment, is far 
greater than the Food and Drug Administration says is acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
The flexibility, Waxman said, "would allow a dangerous pesticide to continue to 
be used, if its removal would mean lost profits to farmers. Balancing the 
cancer risks against farmer income does not protect the public and 
unnecessarily pits family farmers against consumers." 
</P>
<P>
Waxman earlier this year introduced his own pesticide control bill. The 
subcommittee will begin consideration of his bill within three weeks, he said 
Thursday, adding that he expects to take up the President's initiative in the 
course of those meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The President's proposals were revealed to key lawmakers invited to the White 
House for a briefing Thursday afternoon. The seven-point package, debated for 
weeks by the Agriculture Department, the FDA, and the EPA, will be shaped into 
formal legislative proposals and submitted to Congress within days, or at most 
a few weeks, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Immediate indications are that the initiative will become a major battleground 
between environmentalists and the chief executive, who has made known his wish 
to be recognized as an "environmental President." 
</P>
<P>
The reform move was precipitated by last spring's nationwide panic over the use 
of a potentially cancer-causing chemical, Alar, on most of the nation's apple 
supply. After months of deliberation, Bush told Congress that the 
Administration had produced a plan "to speed the process for removing 
pesticides from the marketplace, to protect public health and the environment 
without being either unreasonable or impractical." 
</P>
<P>
Reilly estimated that the four to eight years now required to cancel the 
registration of an unsafe pesticide will be reduced to two or three years by 
eliminating a hearing process now required. Another proposed provision would 
make it easier for authorities to temporarily suspend a pesticide registration 
when there is reasonable evidence of risk to health or the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA was ordered under a law passed last year to re-register pesticides now 
in use, a process that is expected to take several years. As each is reviewed, 
it will be brought under the uniform standard. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Bush put his plan forward, rumors about its major elements 
triggered an angry reaction, especially against the proposal to set uniform 
nationwide tolerances. 
</P>
<P>
The provision provoked special interest in California, where state standards 
are stricter than those of the federal government. Administration officials 
said, however, that there is some "wiggle room " in the Bush package for states 
in such a position. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, pesticides now registered and on the market will not be 
immediately brought under the nationwide uniform tolerance. Moreover, Reilly 
said, the Administration program will give the EPA authority to grant states 
permission to impose more stringent standards on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
Food industry officials did not agree with environmentalist concerns that the 
uniform tolerance would undermine California's tough stance on pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
Of the more than 300 chemicals available to farmers, "less than two dozen will 
be affected" by the uniformity provision in the Bush package, said Jeff 
Nedelman, vice president of public affairs for the Grocery Manufacturers of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the chemicals targeted by the environmental initiative on the 1990 
California ballot, he said, will fail the EPA's re-registration review and be 
phased out anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Agriculture Secretary Jack Parnell, who was formerly Gov. George 
Deukmejian's director of food and agriculture, said Thursday that Californians 
have insisted upon tougher pesticide standards because they lacked confidence 
in the EPA. He said that Californians upset by the move to preempt state 
authority with uniform federal standards "will have every reason to come on 
board" once the details of the Bush initiative are understood. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Bush plan, maximum civil penalties for sales, distribution, or 
commercial use of unapproved pesticides would increase from $5,000 per day to 
$25,000 per day. Also, EPA's enforcement machinery would be expanded. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating the major elements of the package, environmental activists 
launched their counterattack almost at the same moment it was being unveiled. 
</P>
<P>
"The Administration is saying that the benefits of pesticides outweigh the 
risks," said Janet Hathaway, senior project attorney of the Natural Resources 
Defense Council. "The valuation of human life should not be quantified in this 
or any other Administration." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who attended the White House meeting with the 
President, said that the Administration plan includes "a number of constructive 
proposals," but added that it "falls short in critical areas." 
</P>
<P>
His own pesticide reform bill is due to be voted upon in the Senate Labor and 
Human Resources Committee next week. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no justification for giving in to the pesticide industry and 
weakening the health and safety standards essential to protect us from 
cancer-causing residues on our food," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is also unacceptable that the Administration is proposing to weaken current 
federal health and safety standards and then prohibit states from setting 
higher standards themselves." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
The provisions of the Administration's pesticide and food safety reforms will 
be drafted into proposed legislation and submitted to Congress, probably in 
about two weeks. All of the major proposals must be approved by Congress before 
they can take effect. The first hearings are expected to be before the House 
Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and the environment, chaired by Rep. 
Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles.).

U.S. ALLEGEDLY FUNDED SALVADOR DEATH SQUADS

U.S. military advisers in El Salvador knew of political assassinations carried 
out by a Salvadoran army unit and helped bankroll the death squad activity, a 
former Salvadoran army commando was quoted as saying Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview on the CBS Evening News, the former commando, identified as 
Cesar Vielman Joya Martinez, said he and others in his unit -- the intelligence 
section of the army's 1st Brigade -- acted under orders as a clandestine death 
squad as recently as three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Joya Martinez added that the death sentences he helped carry out were passed 
down by his commanders and that he reported back up through the chain of 
command. 
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying that two U.S. military advisers attached to the unit 
were aware of the assassinations but that details of the killings were 
deliberately left out in reports to them. 
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that the U.S. advisers supplied money to his unit that helped 
maintain two civilian vehicles used for death-squad operations and a safehouse 
that served as a secret base of operations. 
</P>
<P>
Joya Martinez has fled El Salvador and is now seeking asylum in the United 
States, CBS said. 
</P>
<P>
It quoted Col. Francisco Elena Fuentes, commander of the 1st Brigade, as 
calling Joya Martinez an "assassin, a deserter and a thief" who had acted 
strictly on his own. 
</P>
<P>
William Walker, the U.S. ambassador in El Salvador, denied in a separate CBS 
interview that American advisers knew of any assassinations. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon, in a statement issued Thursday, called claims of U.S. complicity 
in death-squad activity "patently absurd." 
</P>
<P>
"We know of no instances in which U.S. military personnel have been even 
remotely associated with such morally repugnant activities," the statement 
said.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After helping persuade the U.S. Congress to stop arming the Contras and "give 
peace a chance," President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica penned an 
audacious proposal to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev early last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I pointed out to him that if he did not do what the Congress had done and stop 
sending weapons to Central America, he would be responsible for many years of 
sterile warfare," the Nobel Peace Prize winner said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
What he got was a disheartening rebuff. It came not from Gorbachev but from the 
Soviet ambassador. It said Moscow could not stop aiding Nicaragua's Sandinista 
army unless Washington withheld military aid from El Salvador, Guatemala and 
Honduras. It denied that the Soviet Union supports leftist guerrillas fighting 
those U.S.-backed governments. The letter was "full of cynicism," Arias said. 
</P>
<P>
But today, after years of discreet involvement as an arms supplier to 
revolutionary forces in the region, the Soviet Union is shifting to a 
high-profile role as Central American peace broker. While moving unilaterally 
to stem the flow of East Bloc weapons, it has offered to help the United States 
design and supervise a regional treaty reducing weapons stockpiles and national 
armies. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze unveiled the initiative here earlier 
this month as the highest Soviet official ever to visit Central America. He 
proposed a withdrawal of all foreign military bases and advisers from the 
region, offered to mediate between the Salvadoran government and guerrillas and 
said Moscow wants diplomatic relations with all countries in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Behind Moscow's peace offensive is a mix of motives: a weariness at home with 
the growing economic burden of propping up Nicaragua, a desire for superpower 
collaboration on more important matters and a reluctance to abandon its 
Sandinista allies altogether. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration, having appealed for Soviet cooperation in pacifying 
Central America, now finds itself cautioning that Moscow might be seeking too 
active a role in the traditionally American-dominated region. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe it is a serious basis for negotiation to assert that the 
Soviet Union and the United States have equivalent security interests in 
Central America," said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher. 
</P>
<P>
But officials in Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras, while not disputing 
Washington on that point, have welcomed Shevardnadze's initiative as a belated 
acknowledgment of Kremlin responsibility for what they view, in part, as an 
East-West conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing the U.N. General Assembly during Shevardnadze's visit here, Arias 
hailed Moscow's embrace of the Central American peace agreement that he forged 
two years ago. The five-nation accord calls for internal democratic reforms and 
a halt to outside military aid. 
</P>
<P>
Until the Sandinista takeover here a decade ago, the Soviet Union had minimal 
interest in Central America. After the Sandinistas first came under attack by 
the U.S.-backed Contras in 1981, the Soviets became Managua's main benefactor, 
providing up to $1 billion in military and economic assistance a year. 
</P>
<P>
The 70,000-member Sandinista People's Army, the largest in the region, came to 
be feared by its neighbors as a Soviet-made monster and widely suspected of 
funneling arms to the Salvadoran guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
But now the Sandinista revolution's ideological value has diminished under 
Gorbachev's "new thinking," which is reorienting Soviet foreign policy toward 
economic priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Still, not until the Contras collapsed as a military threat late last year, and 
the Sandinistas felt secure, did Soviet policy begin to shift. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration, more than Arias, has extracted Soviet concessions by 
putting settlement of regional conflicts high on the superpower agenda. Early 
this year, the Kremlin stopped shipping arms to Nicaragua, but the gesture was 
undermined by a stepped-up flow of light weapons from Cuba and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In Wyoming last month, U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III told 
Shevardnadze that Moscow should persuade its allies to cut off such weapons and 
move to stop arms traffic to the Salvadoran rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze came here primarily to engineer a suspension of all arms 
deliveries to Nicaragua, according to two diplomats who were briefed by 
participants in the talks. But they said he did not press the issue of aid to 
the Salvadorans, apparently leaving it as a "bargaining chip" for future 
American concessions. 
</P>
<P>
In separate statements after his two-day visit, Shevardnadze and his hosts said 
the embargo on arms from the Soviet Union will extend through Nicaragua's 
election next Feb. 25. In the meantime, he said, weapons obtained by Nicaragua 
from any other source will be listed publicly. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomats said this was the Sandinistas' way of agreeing to renounce all 
military aid for the next 4 1/2 months -- until new negotiations in the 
post-election period. According to the Soviet press, Shevardnadze got Cuban 
President Fidel Castro to accept the moratorium during a stop in Havana on his 
way home. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States is getting what it wants, at least temporarily," said an 
Asian diplomat. "If there is a trade-off for Moscow, it must be in Afghanistan. 
The Soviets are extremely anxious for the United States to cut off military aid 
to the Afghan rebels and respect the Soviet-backed regime." 
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua's economy is so shattered after a decade of war and mismanagement 
that the Sandinistas had no choice but to accept the arms suspension, the 
diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
In return, they reported, President Daniel Ortega won a reluctant pledge from 
Shevardnadze to maintain Nicaragua's current level of Soviet economic aid -- 
about $300 million a year -- into the next five-year plan, starting in 1991. 
The Soviets had been trying to avoid a new aid commitment until next year. 
</P>
<P>
"The message from Moscow is clear," a Honduran official said. "The way to 
advance socialism is not by military force or monopoly of state power." 
</P>
<P>
Officials in the region say they believe that message has reached the Farabundo 
Marti National Liberation Front in El Salvador. Last month, the Marxist 
guerrilla movement made a peace proposal and opened talks with the country's 
new rightist government. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sandinistas must have told (the guerrillas), 'Look, we have done all we 
can for you. We have our own problems. Now you are on your own,' " said a 
non-American diplomat with access to the Sandinista leadership. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said he believes that Managua has stepped up arms shipments to the 
rebels in recent months, knowing it will soon have to renounce such aid under 
U.S. and Soviet pressure. 
</P>
<P>
In private remarks repeated by a Central American diplomat, Shevardnadze said 
the nine-year-old Salvadoran conflict "serves no interest of Soviet foreign 
policy." Soviet sources say Moscow prefers an internal settlement that 
guarantees a "balance of interests" with no winners and no losers. 
</P>
<P>
Still, U.S. regional allies are skeptical of the Soviet initiative. Salvadoran 
officials say they are not ready to open diplomatic ties with Moscow, accept 
its mediation or put much faith in a temporary cut-off of arms to Nicaragua. 
Insisting that it is too early to judge the Shevardnadze mission, U.S. 
officials said the flow of arms in Central America will continue to be 
monitored closely.

Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir denied a report that Israel provided technology 
for a nuclear-capable missile that reportedly was test-fired in South Africa in 
July. Shamir told Israel Radio there is "no truth" to the NBC News report, 
which said Israel has been engaged in a partnership with South Africa to 
develop nuclear missile capability. The South African government refused 
comment on the report. NBC cited unidentified intelligence sources and a CIA 
document in reporting that Israel provided the missile technology in return for 
a continuous supply of enriched uranium.

RAISA GORBACHEV BEST AMBASSADOR FOR SOVIETS, FINNISH PAPER SAYS

Raisa Gorbachev has delighted crowds in Finland with an elegance that has made 
her a controversial figure at home. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanying her husband, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, on a three-day 
state visit to Finland, the Soviet first lady drew admiration on every stop of 
her own special schedule -- a museum, a huge abstract sculpture, a school and a 
cheese factory. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union's secret weapon has conquered Helsinki . . . (and) is their 
best ambassador," the Helsinki newspaper Hufvudstadsbladet said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 people mixed calls of "Gorba, Gorba" and "Raisa, Raisa" when 
Raisa Gorbachev, dressed in pinstriped skirt and jacket and a purple leather 
coat, joined her husband on the balcony of the presidential palace shortly 
after their arrival in Helsinki on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
She mingled with a rain-soaked crowd on a visit to a modernist sculpture 
commemorating Finland's greatest composer, Jean Sibelius. "Dobry dyen (Good 
day)," she said, and shook hands with bystanders while bodyguards fought in 
vain to hold off a human wave of photographers and reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Visiting a 750-pupil school that teaches in both Finnish and Russian, she 
immediately took one pupil, 9-year-old Mikko Kupari, to stay with her 
throughout the 90-minute visit. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers insisted that she selected Kupari because he produced the loudest 
greeting of the flag-waving children lined up to welcome her. "She was a very 
kind lady, very nice," Mikko told reporters.

House and Senate negotiators agreed to provide $3.2 billion this year to beef 
up the Bush Administration's war on drugs and other crime-fighting ventures. 
The money represents the major congressional role in the war on drugs this 
year. Despite the aura of urgency surrounding the issue, lawmakers had taken no 
action on the funding since the Senate approved it a month ago. The decision by 
a House and Senate conference committee got the money moving again and brought 
total funding for the drug war to $8.8 billion.

More than 1,000 state prison inmates in Pennsylvania rioted for a second night, 
taking eight hostages and setting several cellblocks ablaze, authorities said. 
One hostage was reportedly released. At least 79 people have been injured in 
the two days of disturbances. State police and firefighters struggled to regain 
control of the prison at Camp Hill as thick smoke billowed over the complex and 
several explosions were heard. The incident began during a lockdown. Prison 
Supt. Robert Freeman had said the disturbance may have been caused by 
overcrowding and inmates' anger over changes in policy.

FCC FINES 4 RADIO STATIONS FOR INDECENT BROADCASTING 
</P>

<P>
The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday fined four radio stations it 
accused of broadcasting indecent material in the daytime and said it was 
considering action against four more. 
</P>
<P>
The fines were assessed by the FCC's mass media bureau. 
</P>
<P>
In another indication that the commission, under new Chairman Alfred Sikes, 
will draw the line at 8 p.m. on what it considers indecent broadcasting, the 
bureau said it had cleared out a two-year backlog of indecency complaints by 
dismissing 87 cases, with 51 cases against 40 stations dropped because the 
purportedly indecent material was broadcast after 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Among the stations fined was KFI-AM in Los Angeles, licensed by KFI Inc. It was 
fined $6,000 for allegedly indecent material during the Tom Leykis telephone 
talk show between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. on Nov. 12, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The FCC announcements came on the same day the commission voted 4 to 0 to 
launch an inquiry into establishing the 24-hour ban on indecent broadcasting 
Congress ordered last year. 
</P>
<P>
The commission defines broadcast indecency as language or material that 
"depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary 
community standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities or 
organs." It will take action when there is a "reasonable risk" that children 
may be in the audience, the FCC said. 
</P>
<P>
The other three radio stations that received fines are: 
</P>
<P>
 -- WIOD, Miami, licensed by Cox Broadcasting, a $10,000 fine for five alleged 
instances of indecent programming on the Neil Rogers Show between 10 a.m. and 2 
p.m. The material included sexual innuendo in songs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- WZTA-AM, Miami, licensed by Guy Gannett Publishing Co., fined $2,000 for 
allegedly broadcasting a song with sexual innuendo during the Neil Rogers Show 
at about 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 -- KLUC-FM, Las Vegas, licensed by Nationwide Communications Inc., fined 
$2,000 for broadcasting an allegedly indecent musical recording, "Erotic City," 
by Prince at 7:53 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Four other stations were sent letters asking for comment on complaints about 
them. They are KCCL-AMFM of Paris, Ark.; KSD-FM of St. Louis; WWWE-AM of 
Cleveland; and WXRK-FM of New York.

An anonymous private buyer paid $4.62 million for a ruby-and-diamond ring, a 
world auction record for any colored stone, Sotheby's said. The 32.08-carat 
ring came from the collection of the late Count and Countess Guy du Boisrouvray 
of France. The jewelry sale totaled $31.2 million, an auction record for any 
single-owner sale of jewelry in the United States, a Sotheby's spokeswoman 
said. Worldwide, the record is second only to the 1987 sale of the Duchess of 
Windsor's jewels, she said.

QUAKE FIRES UP EMBARCADERO FREEWAY HATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR F. ZONANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The earth had barely stopped shaking last week when retired electrical engineer 
Norman Rolfe was on the phone with his fellow veterans of San Francisco's 
freeway wars. 
</P>
<P>
The long-reviled Embarcadero Freeway had just been shut down after sustaining 
major damage in the earthquake. According to Rolfe, he and his cronies were all 
asking the same question: "Why don't we complete the job that Mother Nature 
started?" 
</P>
<P>
Thus began the latest chapter in the drive to tear down the Embarcadero 
Freeway, a campaign that has been waged with varying levels of intensity since 
the bulky, 1.2-mile double-decked structure was opened to traffic 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that parts of two other double-deckers in San Francisco sustained 
even heavier damage in the quake. The Embarcadero is the freeway that many San 
Franciscans love to hate. 
</P>
<P>
Local politicians have long garnered votes by bashing the little stub of a 
freeway, which was supposed to stretch across the city to the Golden Gate 
Bridge but was short-circuited in the city's 1950s freeway rebellion. In 1984, 
as mayor, Dianne Feinstein even hauled out a huge mallet and smashed a 
64-foot-long model of the freeway made of cake. 
</P>
<P>
This, after all, is a city that takes its views seriously, and the Embarcadero 
Freeway -- which runs from the Bay Bridge to North Beach -- commits the 
unpardonable sin of walling off the financial district from the bay. It has 
been called an "eyesore," a "concrete monster," an "abomination" and worse. 
</P>
<P>
But the freeway had never been called a menace to public safety, and that is 
the tag opponents will now try to hang on it. Indeed, some Caltrans officials 
and independent experts say the Embarcadero, which shares many design features 
with the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland, came close to collapsing in the Oct. 17 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
"It was built during the same time period, with the same design, on the same 
kind of landfill" as the section of the Nimitz that collapsed, killing dozens 
of people, said Jon Twichell, a San Francisco planning consultant. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way around it: Safety is now a real issue," added Twichell, who led 
the last serious drive to raze the Embarcadero structure in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
That year, to practically everyone's surprise, the Embarcadero Freeway was 
spared by San Francisco's voters when, in an advisory ballot, they voted by a 
margin of nearly 2 to 1 to retain the structure. 
</P>
<P>
Voters at the time were suspicious of an alliance to tear down the freeway that 
had been struck between environmentalists and downtown office building owners, 
whose property values would have been enhanced by the freeway's removal. 
</P>
<P>
They were also chilled by the prospect of massive traffic jams and the 
$171-million price tag for the tear-down and a package of waterfront 
improvements including a landscaped boulevard for cars and a pair of trolley 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
"The attitude was: 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it,' " Twichell recalled. 
"Well, now it's broke. So the question is: Do we fix it or tear it down?" 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Supervisor Richard Hongisto, who over the years has been the 
freeway's staunchest backer, said his support for the roadway was unshaken by 
the quake. "The need for this freeway remains great. I'll agree to tear down 
the Embarcadero when you agree to level half of our downtown office buildings," 
Hongisto said. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, it needs to be completely repaired. If it can't be repaired, it 
should be replaced with some other structure that can bring in as many cars -- 
or more of them," he added, tweaking the freeway's opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans crews have already begun work to shore up the six concrete columns 
that were cracked and will soon begin wrapping the columns with steel cable. 
"It's kind of like putting a Band-Aid on," explained Jerry Hauke, a senior 
transportation engineer with the department. 
</P>
<P>
But while the work will be completed within weeks, the Embarcadero Freeway will 
remain closed for at least six months while a special commission impaneled by 
Gov. George Deukmejian investigates the precise cause of the Nimitz collapse -- 
and the degree of risk posed by the Embarcadero and other double-decked 
freeways in another strong earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the Embarcadero Freeway was much stronger than the Nimitz," said 
Hauke. "The evidence is there right now: one is up and the other is down." 
Hauke said there are some differences in the designs of the Nimitz and the 
Embarcadero, though he declined to enumerate them. 
</P>
<P>
But the case for removing the Embarcadero may be bolstered by statements made 
by other Caltrans officials. 
</P>
<P>
James Roberts, chief of the agency's division of structures, said earlier this 
week that "there's a pretty good chance the Embarcadero Freeway would do the 
same thing Interstate 880 (the Nimitz) did" in the event of another large 
quake. An independent bridge engineering expert, Ronald Mayes, said that, in 
his opinion, the Embarcadero would have collapsed had last week's quake lasted 
five seconds more. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians, silenced for three years by the 1986 vote in support of the 
freeway, are once again picking up their sledgehammers. "What if we repaired it 
and it fell down and killed people?" asked Supervisor Terence Hallinan. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me we've been put on notice: Should anyone be killed now, we'd be 
financially and morally responsible," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Wright, San Francisco's deputy mayor for transportation and public 
works, is ducking the question. "We're concerned, but it's Caltrans' 
responsibility. We've been busy enough with our own damaged structures." 
</P>
<P>
Sources said Mayor Art Agnos is worried that if the freeway is revived as an 
issue it will divert attention from his pet project of building a new downtown 
baseball stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Even the freeway's most ardent opponents are stepping gingerly. "We don't want 
people to accuse us of being vultures," said Twichell. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he added, "my inclination is to go out and raise some hell and go for 
it. This city is here because of the bay, but if you're not a tourist at 
Fisherman's Wharf, you don't get a chance to enjoy it."

SAGA OF BUCK HELM SHINES LIGHT ON TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD C. PADDOCK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<DATELINE>

WEAVERVILLE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This little town in the Trinity Mountains has stepped into the limelight with 
its new-found miracle man, Buck Helm. 
</P>
<P>
Banners and posters adorn the town's streets and shop windows celebrating the 
rescue of Helm from the rubble of the collapsed Nimitz Freeway in Oakland after 
last week's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"This One's for You, Buck," says a sign in the window of the New York Saloon. 
</P>
<P>
And on Thursday, the Chamber of Commerce, the Red Cross and local officials 
staged a press conference seeking donations for victims of the quake and 
predicting that Helm's fame would bring new visitors to this mountain tourist 
center. 
</P>
<P>
"Any recognition doesn't hurt," said Trinity County Supervisor Dee Potter. "I 
think it has increased our business somewhat." 
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old Helm, who works at the docks in Oakland during the week and 
commutes 250 miles to Weaverville on weekends, was pulled from the wreckage of 
the freeway last Saturday after spending 90 hours trapped in his car. 
</P>
<P>
The burly longshoreman's clerk remains hospitalized in Oakland with a fractured 
skull, three broken ribs, nerve damage to his leg and kidney problems due to 
dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
Those who know Helm describe him as strong-willed, occasionally overbearing and 
even "ornery." But he also has a reputation for generosity to his neighbors and 
devotion to his four children, Greg, 35; Marc, 22; Jeff, 16, and Desiree, 12. 
</P>
<P>
Although many residents in this town of about 3,500 have never met him, Helm's 
survival has made him Weaverville's biggest celebrity. It also has helped draw 
the attention of the outside world to this Gold Rush town about 40 miles west 
of Redding and already a popular staging area for hunters and fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the town's biggest event of the year is a Fourth of July festival 
that features a rodeo, parade and a destruction derby. But this year, Buck Helm 
is even bigger. 
</P>
<P>
"Our Thoughts Are With You, Buck and Bay Area," reads a banner hanging from the 
second story of the courthouse building. 
</P>
<P>
On the marquee of the Trinity Theater, Helm shares the billing with this week's 
movie: "God Bless Family Helm. Cheeta and Friends," the sign reads. 
</P>
<P>
Along Main Street, with its covered sidewalks and historic buildings, 
shopkeepers have posted handwritten signs in their windows to congratulate Helm 
-- and indulge in a little self-promotion. 
</P>
<P>
At the Mountain Marketplace natural food store, for example, a sign reads, 
"You're a Natural. Hurry Home Buck." And down the street at the Western Shop 
clothing store, a poster in the window says simply, "Giddy-Yup Buck." 
</P>
<P>
After Helm's dramatic rescue, television crews and newspaper reporters swamped 
the town with requests for interviews. And many local businessmen and elected 
officials are pleased with all the attention Weaverville has been getting. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a great tie with the tourism industry, and any recognition of this 
area that shows why people come here is advantageous," said Supervisor Potter. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the local townsfolk -- who moved here precisely because it is so 
isolated -- are not exactly thrilled with efforts to capitalize on Helm's 
sudden fame. 
</P>
<P>
"It's bringing the town a lot of publicity," said Nola Brimhall, a teller at 
North Valley Bank. "I'm not sure we want the word to get too far out there." 
</P>
<P>
To aid Helm and other earthquake victims, local residents have collected 
donations and organized fund-raising events. On Friday, for instance, "Nila's 
Taco Feed" and the "Teen Center Earthquake Relief Dance" are scheduled to raise 
money for the disaster victims. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, Weaverville residents have not decided what kind of 
celebration they will stage when Helm finally returns home. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Weaverville should certainly take every advantage to welcome Buck 
home," said librarian Doris Callahan, who knows Helm's youngest children 
because of their frequent visits to the library. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that a banner across the street is necessary saying, 'Come See 
Where Lucky Bucky Lives and Eats,' " she said. "But I welcome everybody to the 
Weaverville community."

MEASURE LIMITING ELECTED TERMS FILED

<TEXT>
<P>
A coalition of taxpayer groups filed a proposed initiative for the November, 
1990, ballot that would limit state politicians to two terms. The measure, 
submitted to the attorney general's office in Sacramento for an official title 
and summary, would amend the state Constitution to limit the governor, other 
statewide elected officers and senators to eight years in office. Assembly 
members, whose terms are two years, could serve only four years. State 
politicians would also be barred from holding one office while running as a 
candidate for another. The measure would also strip lawmakers of special state 
pensions and retirement benefits. Proponents would need signatures from 595,485 
registered voters to qualify the proposed constitutional amendment for the 
ballot.

SHORTAGE OF FUNDS PLAGUES EFFORTS FOR WAR MONUMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four months after it achieved a compromise with Los Angeles officials, a group 
of Korean War veterans says its plans to build a monument in a San Pedro city 
park are at least one year behind schedule, and its fund raising has suffered. 
</P>
<P>
And to compound the veterans' problems, backers of a congressionally approved 
national memorial to be built on the Mall in Washington, D.C., have made a 
major fund-raising push in Los Angeles, where they raised $25,000 at a cocktail 
party in Koreatown last month. 
</P>
<P>
The party -- billed as a "commemoration of the victory in Seoul" -- honored the 
chairman of the Washington memorial committee, retired U.S. Army Gen. Richard 
G. Stilwell, who in August came to Los Angeles to promote the D.C. memorial 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
The Stilwell fete enjoyed broad support in Los Angeles' Korean community. Its 
invitation carried a list of backers that included more than 80 Korean 
community leaders -- from pastors to businessmen to an Olympic gold medalist -- 
and more than 30 Korean organizations. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the backers of the San Pedro memorial have not conducted any 
fund-raisers in Koreatown and have tied themselves to just one group, the 
Korean Veterans Assn. They say they have been so caught up in trying to meet 
city requirements for approval that there is little time to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult," said Jack Stites, executive director of the International 
Korean War Memorial Committee, the group that is backing the San Pedro 
monument. "(For) the national monument, they have their location; the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers is doing all their engineering. The only thing they have to 
spend any time on is fund raising. That's a pretty nice position to be in." 
</P>
<P>
The $4-million San Pedro memorial is a private effort, proposed by the Chosin 
Few, a nationwide organization of mostly Marine Corps veterans whose members 
survived the battle of the Chosin Reservoir. Their monument is intended to 
honor veterans from all 22 nations that joined the Allied forces in Korea. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington memorial, which will honor U.S. veterans, will depict 38 
combat-equipped soldiers walking in double file toward an American flag. It 
will be set in Ash Woods, a grove of trees across the reflecting pool from the 
Vietnam Veterans Memorial. So far, $4 million of the necessary $7.5 million has 
been raised for the national memorial, said Ed Borcherdt,a California 
fund-raiser for the project. 
</P>
<P>
The international memorial is to be built at San Pedro's Angels Gate Park on a 
bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean and Los Angeles Harbor. The park, which was 
once a military base, also houses the Korean Friendship Bell, a gift to Los 
Angeles from the South Korean government. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the veterans sought to erect their monument next to the bell -- a 
site that Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley offered them in 1986. But that plan ran 
into trouble when San Pedro residents complained that the centerpiece of the 
monument -- a larger-than-life-size sculpture that depicts a battle scene -- 
would destroy the bell's peaceful setting. 
</P>
<P>
After a protracted series of hearings, the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs 
Commission -- the first of four city and state agencies that must approve the 
monument -- sided with the residents but gave the veterans preliminary approval 
to build the monument elsewhere in the park. 
</P>
<P>
The switch in sites has sent the veterans, who had spent more than $70,000 on 
engineering studies for the monument, back to the drawing boards. "We've 
started at ground zero," said Stites. "Everything we did on the other site, 
with the exception of our aerial survey," is unusable in the new location. 
</P>
<P>
The veterans at first had hoped to begin construction this past July and 
complete the monument by November, 1990. They now say construction will begin 
in April and conclude by November, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
But officials at two city departments -- Cultural Affairs and Recreation and 
Parks -- say those estimates may be optimistic, and that it may take another 
year just for the veterans to get all the necessary approvals, including OKs 
from the state Coastal Commission and the state Office of Historic 
Preservation. 
</P>
<P>
According to Stites, the delays and lack of final approvals have made some 
potential contributors leery about giving money to the San Pedro project. "In 
many cases they're sitting back, waiting to ensure that we have all our 
approvals before making a contribution," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, Stites said, his group has raised $1 million in cash and pledges, 
although he would not give a breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
Stites said he is not sure if the well-organized Washington effort -- which has 
included full-page advertisements in the New York Times and several mentions in 
the syndicated Dear Abby column -- will hurt his group's fund raising, either 
in Los Angeles or the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
But in an interview several months ago, he was bitter at the Washington 
committee's decision to target Los Angeles' Korean community, saying it had 
caused confusion and would harm the San Pedro effort. 
</P>
<P>
"It was frankly assumed by those of us in leadership on this one that since we 
were making a point not to go into the Washington area Korean community, we 
felt they would probably respect that and do the same here," Stites said in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
Some Korean community leaders, meanwhile, say the backers of the national 
memorial have made a persuasive case that their project, because it has the 
imprimatur of the U.S. government, is more prestigious than the San Pedro 
memorial and thus more deserving of financial support. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview during his August trip to Los Angeles, Stilwell put it this 
way: "The law says that we are preeminent. The Congress of the United States 
has said there will be one memorial in the nation's capital. . . . Any other 
memorial that's a private venture has difficulty making the same claim." 
</P>
<P>
That argument received an added boost last week when, on a visit to the United 
States, Korean President Roh Tae Woo joined Stilwell for a tour of the site for 
the national monument. Although Roh also made a stop in Los Angeles, he did not 
tour the San Pedro site. 
</P>
<P>
Yohngsohk Choe, secretary general of the Korean Federation, an umbrella group 
that represents a number of Los Angeles Korean organizations, said members of 
the local Korean community would support both memorials "in spirit," though he 
would not vouch for how the San Pedro memorial would do in fund raising.

BILTMORE HOTEL SITE SUBJECT OF 2 NOV. 7 BALLOT PROPOSALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, the question is being put to Hermosa Beach voters: What should the 
city do with the old Biltmore Hotel site? 
</P>
<P>
The issue has been a familiar refrain in city elections since 1972, seven years 
after a hotel on the beachfront property was condemned and razed. Voters have 
rejected seven proposals, including various plans for hotel developments at the 
.84-acre site, most recently in November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 7, voters will be asked to consider the latest incarnations of the 
Biltmore issue, propositions C and D. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition C, a citizens' initiative, proposes dedicating the entire area, 
between 13th and 15th streets on the Strand, as a beachfront public park. The 
initiative was approved for the ballot in March after a petition drive 
spearheaded by community activist Parker Herriott. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition D is a proposed compromise that the City Council voted to put on 
the ballot last May, based on recommendations from an 11-member advisory 
committee appointed by the council. 
</P>
<P>
Under Proposition D, 59% of the parcel -- the area facing the Strand -- would 
be developed as an urban beachfront park; 25% of the lot would be commercially 
developed for use as a restaurant, and 16% would be sold for high-density 
residential development for an amount estimated at $1 million by the 
proposition's supporters. 
</P>
<P>
They argue that Proposition D is a balanced compromise that addresses concerns 
of open space advocates and also could bring the city funds to build the plaza 
and buy land for parks elsewhere in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the park plan, however, call the city's proposal a "concrete 
urban plaza jungle," and argue that any development on the site would add to 
existing parking and congestion problems. A "yes" vote on Proposition C would 
provide a three-block expanse of green space near the ocean and the city would 
retain much-needed open space, supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
But some residents have urged a "no" vote on both measures, saying this would 
allow the city to sell and develop the entire site for residential use. Such a 
move would raise more than $8 million to buy excess school property and the 
Santa Fe Railroad right of way, they argue, and would allow the city to repeal 
the 4% utility tax being used to help purchase the right of way.

CHASING ELUSIVE DREAMS 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
Some of those on the selection committee for Inglewood's new school 
superintendent still remember when George J. McKenna III -- fresh from a 
television movie and White House visit -- first entered the interview room last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
"When he walked in I could see the mouths drop open," said Terry Coleman, one 
of those present. "He was debonair. He was dressed to kill. People looked at 
him like he was the Messiah." 
</P>
<P>
Another committee member, Mildred McNair, said: "I felt like we had a Hollywood 
figure in the room. . . . We tend to look at anyone in a movie as a Hollywood 
star, and we can't look at them as a normal person." 
</P>
<P>
A year has passed since McKenna left the rejuvenated Washington Preparatory 
High School in South-Central Los Angeles and took the reins of a school system 
beset with political infighting, low test scores and deteriorating campuses. 
</P>
<P>
When he took over the $80,000-a-year post heading the Inglewood Unified School 
District, McKenna was basking in praise and nationwide attention, including a 
made-for-television movie called "The George McKenna Story," which chronicled 
his successful efforts at Washington Prep. 
</P>
<P>
Ahead of him in the county's 13th-largest school district, however, was a rocky 
educational road lined with a powerful teachers' union, a contentious school 
board and parents fed up with the district's poorly run schools. 
</P>
<P>
Those who selected McKenna, those who work with him, those whose children he 
supervises, generally agree that one year is too short a time to raise a 
district's test scores, repair disintegrating buildings and set up a new system 
for educational excellence. But as McKenna begins the process, resistance is 
developing among some who say that underneath his star quality is an 
inexperienced administrator who demands too much and negotiates too little. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna, in his first superintendent's job after a decade as a principal in the 
Los Angeles Unified School District, says he's ready for the challenge and has 
heard all the criticism before. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect disbelievers to surface," he said of his first year. "There are more 
disbelievers out there than there are believers. I know that. I expect anyone 
trying to make major, systemic change in public institutions to face major 
resistance." 
</P>
<P>
It's 9:15 a.m. and McKenna is alone in the center of the Inglewood High School 
gym as several hundred students eye him from the bleachers on either side. 
</P>
<P>
"Life to some of us is not as important as it should be," he bellows into the 
microphone. "Trust me, there is no gang-bangers' heaven. If there were, it 
would have bars on it." 
</P>
<P>
His voice rises and falls at just the right moments. He knows what the audience 
wants, and needs, to hear. He strides back and forth as he speaks, waving his 
arm for emphasis. At the end comes wild applause. 
</P>
<P>
Whether on television's "Nightline," at an educational meeting in Lexington, 
Ky., or in a high school gym, McKenna's power is in his tongue, those who work 
with him say. Even his critics acknowledge how McKenna motivates, inspires, 
impassions, when he has a microphone in his hand. It's in the nuts and bolts of 
the superintendent's job that some critics and supporters say McKenna needs 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"McKenna is a visionary," said board member Zyra McCloud. "He's an orator, a 
motivator. But in terms of running a school district, McKenna is a rookie, very 
inexperienced, very weak. He doesn't always listen to good advice from board 
members, parents, administrators and teachers. I'm still waiting for results." 
</P>
<P>
Board member Thomasina Reed added: "For someone who has no experience for a 
superintendent, he is doing a reasonably good job. If he had more experience, 
he would be doing a better job. He has some impressive and perhaps unattainable 
goals." 
</P>
<P>
McKenna, 49, a New Orleans native who holds a bachelor's degree from Xavier 
University, a master's degree in mathematics from Loyola University of Chicago 
and an honorary doctorate from Xavier, admits that he gets frustrated with some 
aspects of the job. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my weaknesses is I try to do too many things simultaneously," he said 
earlier this month from the district offices on South Inglewood Avenue. "I may 
not have the resources to finish or the people to carry it through. . . . When 
you make a speech or write a bulletin, it doesn't mean all the schools will 
change overnight. It won't happen. You have to spend time. And sometimes with 
minutiae. Minutiae, that's my frustration." 
</P>
<P>
Getting along with an often tumultuous school board is another challenge. 
School trustees frequently question the superintendent's proposals at board 
meetings, which can stretch to eight hours or more. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt that he realized it would be this tough to get along with the board," 
said Larry Aubry, board president. "You have five personalities and five 
agendas. It's his job to balance them." 
</P>
<P>
The last Inglewood superintendent didn't succeed at that. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna was first offered the Inglewood job in 1985, when a three-member board 
majority aligned with Mayor Edward Vincent fired then-Supt. Rex Fortune. He was 
rehired six weeks later after a community uproar. McKenna said he declined the 
1985 offer because of the divided board. When Fortune resigned in July, 1988, 
McKenna said the political climate had changed. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna's chief critics during his first year have been the teachers, who have 
been working for more than a year without a contract. Members of the Inglewood 
Teachers Assn. call McKenna authoritarian and anti-teacher for his hard-line 
stance during the contract talks. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning salaries for Inglewood's teachers last year -- $22,614 -- ranked 25th 
out of the 43 unified districts in Los Angeles County for those with bachelor's 
degrees and 30th for those with master's degrees, according to county education 
statistics. Earlier this month, teachers turned down the district's offer of a 
2.5% salary increase for the 1988-89 year; the union wants 14%. 
</P>
<P>
The union also says McKenna is quick to send memos to teachers but is slow to 
involve them in decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Johnson, president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, says similar 
criticisms were leveled against McKenna during his 10 years at Washington Prep. 
</P>
<P>
"George was very demanding, very authoritarian," Johnson said. "It really had 
to be done George's way. There was very little collaboration with the faculty. 
It was George's way or the highway, as we used to say." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 142 teachers he first worked with at Washington, 122 moved elsewhere 
during his tenure, Los Angeles union officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Bell, the vice president of the Inglewood union, says morale among her 
colleagues could not be lower. Many are looking to Los Angeles and other 
districts to escape the low pay, deteriorated classrooms, lack of supplies and 
now, she said, a lack of respect from the superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
"I would give him a poor grade -- a low D," said union president Ervin Drayden. 
"I think we had high expectations. We hoped he would come in and work with the 
teachers. The teachers think they have gotten the short end of the stick." 
</P>
<P>
McKenna disagreed with the characterization that he is anti-teacher, but 
emphasized that it is his job to run the schools. 
</P>
<P>
Even McKenna critics say the teachers' union has become too powerful in 
Inglewood. After a brief walkout in 1987, the union gained a 14% raise over two 
years that has been blamed for the district's budget crunch the next year. 
</P>
<P>
"Teachers should get more money," McKenna said, "but the question is, 'Where 
does it come from?' The second question is, 'After we give them the money, what 
commitment do we get in return?' " 
</P>
<P>
Money is a problem for the district, which had to cut $3 million from its 
$44-million general fund budget for 1988-89 and is struggling back toward 
financial health. The current $47-million budget restores several top-level 
positions eliminated during those cuts. 
</P>
<P>
His first year, McKenna said, was spent presenting his educational mission to 
the community and laying the groundwork for it. McKenna's goals are ambitious: 
turning upside down a system that he says is not designed for disadvantaged 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
He wants parents at every school maintaining order, teachers judged on 
performance just like everybody else, students not slipping through the cracks. 
Inglewood has about 720 teachers and an enrollment of more than 15,900 students 
-- 54% black, 43% Latino, 2% white and 1% others. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna has sent contracts to homes that outline the district's expectations 
for both parents and students. A memo also went out to principals and teachers 
outlining McKenna's standards. 
</P>
<P>
Although some of McKenna's staff choices have won praise -- like his 
appointment of the district's only Latino principal -- others have met 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
At a school board meeting in August, dozens of community members protested 
McKenna's selections of new principals and assistant principals. They said he 
had vowed to clean house and then simply shuffled the current administrators, 
missing his first big chance to improve the schools. 
</P>
<P>
During that meeting, an angry McKenna told the board: "If I cannot make the 
district function, you can with three votes find yourself another 
superintendent." When tempers cooled, the board approved all but three of the 
superintendent's choices. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, residents crowded into another meeting to complain about 
severe scheduling problems at Morningside High School, where the principal and 
assistant principals were replaced by McKenna in August. 
</P>
<P>
When school opened, some classes had more than 100 students, others had 10 or 
fewer. Even two months into the school year, many student schedules have not 
been worked out. Whereas administrators blame the situation on computer 
problems, critics say last-minute staff changes caused the chaos. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he's made the progress people expected, and I don't see it in 
the near future," said W. R. (Tony) Draper, a former board member. "Morningside 
is an example of the confusion that has occurred during his first year." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone wants to see if the district's lagging test scores will improve under 
McKenna. The district traditionally finishes in the bottom third in the county 
for all grade levels in the California Assessment Program. In 1988-89, 
12th-grade reading and math scores were lower than 98% of the districts across 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
"This district has been floundering for a long time, and now we're asking for a 
new direction," said Joseph Rouzan, board vice president. "The problems are not 
going anywhere overnight. You put out one fire, and another one starts." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent, a former school board president who frequently grumbles about how the 
district is run, concurred. "He came to a very difficult situation, and he is 
trying to put the pieces together," the mayor said. "I think it is unfair to 
castigate him. He has inherited a bad situation." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman, a member of the Inglewood PTA-Council, said people "thought McKenna 
had the magic wand when he came in. They're realizing now that he's human. I'm 
not pleased with his first year. I'm still waiting for action." 
</P>
<P>
Aubry said everyone will expect more from McKenna during his second year. "In a 
way, it's been like an extended honeymoon. That will end soon. At that point, 
the training situation is over." 
</P>
<P>
McNair, a longtime Inglewood resident who works in the Los Angeles schools, is 
even tougher on McKenna. "If he thinks we'll continue to pat him on the back in 
Inglewood, he can forget it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
McKinley Nash, superintendent of Centinela Valley Union High School District, 
which covers Lawndale, Hawthorne and Lennox, says McKenna's first year has gone 
according to schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"Leadership itself illicits critique and criticism," Nash said. "The 
superintendent who has little or no criticism is not leading anywhere. McKenna 
should have a high enough threshold that he is not bothered by the criticism." 
</P>
<P>
McKenna, who has a contract through the 1990-91 school year, says he is on 
track to meet his goal of revamping Inglewood's schools in three years. That 
goal stands despite all he has learned about the hurdles a superintendent must 
leap. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned that you can't take this job too seriously," McKenna said. "You 
can take the concepts and the philosophies very seriously. But I always 
remember that superintendents have committed suicide, superintendents have 
dropped dead on the job, superintendents have lost their families and gotten 
divorced (while) fighting over issues that they should have been able to ease 
off on."

PARKING PLAN OKD FOR SAN PEDRO SHOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shoppers in downtown San Pedro would be able to park in an 89-space lot on 7th 
Street and reach shops along 6th Street through a pedestrian passageway, under 
proposals endorsed Thursday by Los Angeles city transportation officials. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals, which would cost $1.4 million, are regarded as an important part 
of plans to resolve a severe parking shortage on 6th Street, the heart of 
downtown San Pedro. Merchants have long complained that some shoppers avoid the 
area because of inadequate parking, and a study in 1987 identified a deficiency 
of up to 120 spaces on the street. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the City Council, the proposals would create a $1.3-million 
deficit in the city's parking revenue fund for council District 15, which 
extends from San Pedro to Watts. Transportation officials said they would have 
to borrow from the $25.8-million citywide parking fund. 
</P>
<P>
"We need the parking that bad," said Ann D'Amato, deputy to Councilwoman Joan 
Milke Flores, who represents the area. 
</P>
<P>
In a unanimous vote, the Los Angeles Board of Transportation Commissioners 
recommended Thursday that the city purchase a brick building, a small parking 
lot and a wood house on the 400 block of W. 7th Street to expand an adjacent 
48-space city-owned parking lot. Under the proposal, the structures would be 
demolished to make way for 41 additional spaces. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate but related vote, the commissioners waived city parking 
requirements for the expansion of two buildings on W. 6th Street, directly 
behind the city parking lot, which would have compelled their owner to provide 
17 new spaces. In exchange, owner Howard Sheldon agreed to set aside 2,000 
square feet of the new Harbor Office Supply complex to create a one-story 
pedestrian passageway from the 7th Street lot to 6th Street. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Larry B. Faigin voted for the deal, but only after expressing some 
reservations about giving up 17 spaces when the city is paying $1.4 million to 
provide more parking. 
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned that 17 spaces is a lot of spaces to lose," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But city transportation officials said they are willing to trade the spaces for 
the passageway because most shoppers will not park on 7th Street and walk 
around the block -- via Pacific Avenue on the west or Mesa Street on the east 
-- to shops on 6th Street. The pedestrian corridor will be the first public 
access to 6th Street from the parking lot, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"It represents such a major enhancement to the project that we are willing to 
waive the 17 spaces," said Margaret Sullivan, a management analyst for the 
city's Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Gaydos, president of the San Pedro Revitalization Corp., a nonprofit group 
of downtown merchants, said the link between parking on 7th Street and shops on 
6th Street is vital to the continued renaissance of the downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"I agree it is expensive," Gaydos said. "But if we didn't encourage businesses 
by waiving parking requirements, we wouldn't have anyone coming to town." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement with Sheldon must also be approved by the Planning Department. 
The recommendation to purchase the 7th Street properties will be forwarded in 
the next few weeks to the City Council, which is expected to approve it. The 
council has already set aside $825,000 to expand the parking lot, and Flores 
supports spending the additional $641,000.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $250,000 AWARDED IN RACIAL SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Harbor College failed to take "immediate and appropriate" action to 
prevent an employee from using racial slurs against another worker, a Long 
Beach Superior Court jury found this week in awarding $250,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman Jones, 57, of Long Beach won the award Tuesday at the end of a 
three-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who is black, told the jury that he was working as a painter at the 
school in 1980 and 1981 when another painter, who is white, regularly insulted 
him with racial slurs. Jones' lawsuit claimed that he had to endure the 
discriminatory atmosphere because supervisors did not respond to his 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
College officials said that they counseled the other painter and eventually 
forced him to resign when he continued to use the slurs. 
</P>
<P>
But Jones' lawyer, James Vititoe, argued that the college let the taunts 
continue for more than a year before forcing the other painter out of his job. 
</P>
<P>
Jones went on disability retirement in 1985 because of knee injuries.

FIGHT FOR DISABLED -- HE MAKES IT HIS BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There are parties that Ed Tessier doesn't go to, plays he can't see, guest 
lectures he won't hear. 
</P>
<P>
It's because the events aren't accessible to wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
Some people might just accept that and move on. But not the 21-year-old 
Tessier, who was left a quadriplegic by an accident at age 16. 
</P>
<P>
He decided to do something about it -- and make some money in the bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Three days a week, the Pomona College student leaves campus for an office in 
Pomona, the home of Designs for Independence, a nonprofit corporation he 
founded 1 1/2 years ago. There, he doles out information and advice to 
businesses, private homeowners and schools on how to make buildings more 
accessible to the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a real gap between knowing the code and how best to apply it," Tessier 
said, sitting behind a desk stacked with state and federal building code 
requirements. "I quickly learned I had a point of view the building industry 
wasn't familiar with. I could learn their lingo and translate my practical 
expertise into practical suggestions." 
</P>
<P>
Tessier said he has learned that "the biggest thing that can sell the business 
community to wheelchair access is that access means good business. There are 43 
million Americans with disabilities, the largest portion of whom live in 
California. The ones wanting to get ahead in this game are the ones that are 
going to get the business." 
</P>
<P>
After enrolling in college in 1986, Tessier was struck by how many places were 
closed to wheelchair users: bookstores, government offices, fraternity parties, 
dormitories. He soon became an active member of several disabled-rights groups. 
Now, he chairs the Committee on Disability in Claremont, which has awarded him 
a grant to study accessibility issues in the city. 
</P>
<P>
His involvement in the community, coupled with the founding of Designs for 
Independence, led to his being awarded Time magazine's College Achievement 
Award in April. It is given each year to 20 juniors in North America. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, Tessier said, clients will shun his advice and go with a cheaper, 
less reliable plan -- for example, wheelchair lifts instead of elevators -- or 
no access plan at all. Although ignoring access codes might be grounds for a 
suit, Tessier said, he refrains from threatening the company because he is 
playing the role of professional consultant, not of activist. 
</P>
<P>
"When a firm decides not to do the legal minimum there's a real conflict of 
interest," he said. "I feel ethically I can't use the knowledge against them at 
that time. But if that lack of access becomes an issue later on, if there's an 
accident for example, I'll be the first to offer my information."

CEMETERY OF STARS NOT ENTIRELY A GRAVE MATTER; 
</P>
<P>
HOLLYWOOD: MEMORIAL PARK, SUBJECT OF HALLOWEEN TOURS, OFFERS A MIX OF STYLES TO 
DELIGHT THE TOMBSTONE AFICIONADO. 
</P>

<P>
Actress Marion Davies, mistress of William Randolph Hearst, has been dead for 
almost 30 years, but someone remembers. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, a fan left a red rose on her mausoleum in Hollywood Memorial 
Park. "Dear Marion, you are still loved and missed," read the accompanying 
note. 
</P>
<P>
"Practically all of Hollywood's history can be revisited here," said Frank 
Cooper during a preview of the upcoming Halloween tour of the cemetery 
sponsored by the Art Deco Society of Los Angeles. This year Cooper, who began 
the tours five years ago, and his colleagues will take groups through the 
cemetery on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
As Cooper walked the 57-acre grounds, he pointed out the graves of Hollywood 
founder Harvey Wilcox and other city fathers and of dozens of celebrities, from 
swashbuckler Douglas Fairbanks Sr. to director John Huston. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, whose day job is with a firm that mails press releases, is master of 
the odd Hollywood cemetery fact. 
</P>
<P>
He explains, for instance, that Davies' handsome white mausoleum, with its 
stone cherubs, was not a macabre gift from Hearst to his pretty protegee. 
Davies had the tomb, which has room for 12, built for her family. 
</P>
<P>
As an anthropology student at USC, Cooper wrote a thesis on death and culture 
that took him to most of the area's memorial parks. The Hollywood cemetery, an 
eclectic jumble of 73,000 graves, crypts, mausoleums and cenotaphs, is his 
all-time favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"Forest Lawn," he opined, "looks like a golf course. It has no character." But 
Hollywood Memorial Park, with its miniature Egyptian temples, stained-glass 
windows and tombstones shaped like rocket ships, is fraught with character, he 
said. Like the streets of Hollywood, the cemetery tolerates dozens of different 
styles. "There's room for personalization," the cemetery aficionado said. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper insists there is nothing strange about liking cemeteries. "We're not 
concerned with what's beneath the ground. We're concerned with lawn level and 
above. It's not morbid. It's quite beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
It's also a cheap date, noted Cooper, who sometimes visits the cemetery with 
girlfriend Suzanne Tarbell. 
</P>
<P>
Established in 1899, the cemetery is best known for its film-industry burials. 
Producer-director Cecil B. De Mille is lavishly entombed, purportedly with his 
feet pointing toward Paramount. Rudolph Valentino's marker in the Hollywood 
Cathedral Mausoleum almost always bears the lipstick imprint of a kiss. Jayne 
Mansfield, who was decapitated in a car accident in 1967, is buried in 
Pennsylvania, but her bereaved fan club bought her a memorial plaque in 
Hollywood cemetery. On it is a publicity shot of the blonde star and the 
inscription: "We live to love you more each day." 
</P>
<P>
As Cooper pointed out, dead moguls and stars are the cemetery's major draw, but 
many of the most interesting graves have nothing to do with the famous. 
</P>
<P>
In several Armenian areas of the cemetery, graves are marked with headstones 
decorated with photo-like portraits of the dead sandblasted on polished 
granite. One of the deceased is shown as a young man, wearing a rakishly angled 
hat. Little gardens, planted with mint and other herbs as well as flowers, 
flourish on some plots, many of which are edged with brick borders. The grave 
of a beloved toddler is decorated with his toy cars and other playthings. Some 
graves are topped with Eastern Rite crosses fashioned out of plastic pipe. 
</P>
<P>
This year's Art Deco Society tours, which cost $5, will begin at 9:30 a.m. 
Saturday at the cemetery entrance at 6000 Santa Monica Blvd.

JIM MURRAY: THIS GUY DEFINITELY IS A TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
James Caan is crazy. His mother knows it. His producer knows it. His agent 
knows it. He knows it. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, he's one of our age's finest actors. I don't mean to suggest he goes around 
thinking he's Napoleon. (Marcus Allen, maybe. Hulk Hogan.) You don't have to 
get a net over him. 
</P>
<P>
But, he's a big movie star, right? I mean, you're talking Sonny Corleone in 
"The Godfather," the guy who broke your heart in "Brian's Song," who can play 
Mr. Nice Guy ("Cinderella Liberty") or Mr. Tough Guy ("Thief") with equal 
degrees of skill and enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
So, he can go everywhere by limo, right? Well, Jimmy goes by motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't always get there. Jimmy drives a motorcycle as if he's jumping 20 
buses with it. The first motorcycle accident wouldn't have been so bad except 
he was carrying this small hardwood martial arts sword in his side. That broke 
more ribs than the curb. 
</P>
<P>
Movie stars have hobbies, OK? Usually, it's a yacht with room for chorus girls 
and champagne. Jimmy Caan's hobby? Rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
You heard me. He's not on a yacht. He's on a horse with a rope in his teeth 
chasing a running calf. Once in a while, he gets on a bucking horse while three 
movie moguls faint dead away, the insurance company gets hysterical, his wife 
threatens divorce and his agent starts looking for a psychiatrist who will take 
him on. 
</P>
<P>
There aren't many rodeo cowboys born in the Bronx (actually, there is one born 
in New York City), and the only calves Jimmy Caan saw growing up were on hooks 
in his father's kosher butcher shop. 
</P>
<P>
But, Jimmy was no Midnight Cowboy. He got busted up so many times on horseback 
that his pal, George Anderson, trainer of the Raiders, doesn't send him a tie 
for Christmas, he sends him a box of tape. "He tells me, 'I don't want your 
heart and liver when you die, I want your skeleton,' " Caan chortles. "He says 
my X-ray looks like a three-car pileup on a freeway." 
</P>
<P>
Caan holds the listed world record for hospital escapes. He usually stays in 
them just till he comes to. "I tell them I'll send over my stunt man to take my 
medicine for me. He does all the dangerous stuff." Once, he says, a young nurse 
found him creeping out of the hospital in the wee hours with a tube still 
attached. "She burst into tears. 'Oh, Mr. Caan! You'll get me fired!' she says. 
I told her 'Honey, check the hospital records. This is the fourth time this 
year I went over the wall." Most people leave a hospital by wheelchair. Caan 
leaves by drainpipe. 
</P>
<P>
Adds Caan: "I just tell the doctor, 'I gotta go home, I don't feel well. And 
the hospital's no place to be when you're sick!' " 
</P>
<P>
When a gushing fan-mag type found him in a rodeo in the San Joaquin Valley one 
time and said, "Oh, Mr. Caan! I didn't know rodeo was your hobby!" Caan 
corrected her: "It isn't. This is what I do. Acting is my hobby." 
</P>
<P>
He sneaked off to a rodeo in Palm Springs once during the shooting of "Funny 
Lady" with Barbra Streisand. "I was the 'heeler' in team-roping," he explains. 
"Now, you can always tell a heeler. Check his thumbs. Your thumb gets caught in 
the rope and when your rope goes taut, your thumb is apt to go spinning to the 
horizon. Mine just got pulled back a little -- all the way to the elbow." 
</P>
<P>
He had to take the cast off to do the love scenes. "I'm the only guy in history 
who ever looked as if he was trying to do a love scene in the middle of an 
appendectomy." He had to try not to scream. So did the producer, Ray Stark. 
Another time when Caan was missing from the set, producer Stark asked bitterly, 
"Have you checked the alligator farms around here? He's probably wrestling 
one." 
</P>
<P>
Caan has had so many stitches, he looks as if he was not born but embroidered. 
When he tore his shoulder and thumb, the doctor wanted to know if he should 
bring a needle. "You better bring a sewing machine," he was told. Caan has had 
so many screws in his shoulder, he has them chromed and made into a necklace. 
There was a time he could set off metal detectors naked. 
</P>
<P>
He played football at Michigan State. "(Coach) Duffy Daugherty liked to say he 
turned me into an actor," Caan said. "He saw me run with the football and said, 
'Ever think of something else for a living, kid?' I like to think it was the 
other halfback, Clarence Peaks, who turned me into an actor." 
</P>
<P>
But James Caan has mellowed. Now, all he does is race powerboats offshore and 
practice karate. The powerboat attraction is that, in addition to crashing or 
burning, you can also drown. You can't get a more perfect sport than that. 
</P>
<P>
Karate has been his other longtime love. He's been a black belt since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
He fell under the aegis of a martial arts master named Takayuki Kubota, whom 
Caan holds in the same awe as kids do Batman. "In this country, when we have a 
riot, we call out the National Guard. In Japan, when they have one, they call 
out him," Caan boasts. Kubota has trained police departments from Osaka to Los 
Angeles in the use of martial arts and baton techniques in subduing criminals 
short of shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, James Caan's type of guy. To honor his mentor, Kubota, a four-day 
festival of competition featuring practitioners from 40 countries will be held, 
culminating in the finals at Cal State Los Angeles on Sunday, Nov. 5. "Kubota 
is Soshihan Kubota, which means there is only one of him in the world," Caan 
explains. "And I am next in command or Soshihan Dai, which means there's only 
one of me in the world, too." 
</P>
<P>
The Kubota World Cup commemorating 50 years in the martial arts for the 
Soshihan will consist of competitions, seminars, a banquet and meditation 
periods. Jimmy Caan probably plans to spend his meditation time behind an open 
throttle -- or an open parachute.

TV-RADIO: DIERDORF IS GIVING VIEWERS SHADES OF HUMBLE HOWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Someone should tell Dan Dierdorf that humility is an admirable trait. 
</P>
<P>
It's something Howard Cosell could never recognize. Maybe Dierdorf, a genuinely 
good guy, still can. 
</P>
<P>
When Dierdorf first moved from CBS to ABC's "Monday Night Football" a few years 
ago, he was being compared to John Madden. These days, he's more likely to be 
compared to Cosell. 
</P>
<P>
KMPC's Jim Healy, who has been pounding Dierdorf on the air, has a new name for 
him: Mr. Obnoxious. Healy is one who has made the Cosell comparison. 
</P>
<P>
Dierdorf isn't that bad, but maybe he began believing all those rave notices he 
used to get. He's simply taking himself too seriously. 
</P>
<P>
With Al Michaels at the stretched-out World Series the past two Monday nights, 
Dierdorf, working only with Frank Gifford, has been out of control. 
</P>
<P>
The wit and the ability to communicate are still there. It's the humility 
that's missing. 
</P>
<P>
Gifford could probably give Dierdorf a few lessons in humility. 
</P>
<P>
Criticized for making too many mistakes and for being too bland, Gifford's 
popularity among viewers hasn't seemed to wane. 
</P>
<P>
Gifford has outlasted them all on "Monday Night Football." And it's not just 
luck. 
</P>
<P>
The key to Gifford's success is the pleasant personality most people perceive 
when they see and hear him. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle Alzado, who worked only three pro football telecasts for NBC, has 
apparently worked his last. 
</P>
<P>
Alzado actually wasn't under contract for more than three games, but Terry 
O'Neil, executive producer of NBC Sports, was hoping that he'd found a nugget 
in the rough. 
</P>
<P>
Now O'Neil is admitting that he misjudged Alzado. There was no nugget, just 
rough. 
</P>
<P>
Alzado, paired with Fred Roggin, opened the season with a Denver-Kansas City 
game. Even though Alzado is still somewhat of a hero in Denver, where he played 
for the Broncos, the NBC affiliate there received a number of complaints about 
Alzado. 
</P>
<P>
Dusty Saunders, TV columnist for the Rocky Mountain News, wrote that Alzado 
used the word nice -- "nice run," "nice catch," "nice call," -- about 1,500 
times, no exaggeration. 
</P>
<P>
Saunders also referred to Alzado and Roggin as NBC's answer to twins Arnold 
Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito. 
</P>
<P>
Alzado next worked a Phoenix-San Diego game with Jay Randolph and had little to 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Then he had his worst game, Miami at Cincinnati, two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
How bad was he? Well he called Dolphin nose tackle Brian Sochia, a seven-year 
veteran, Mike Scioscia. 
</P>
<P>
NBC is probably more to blame than Alzado, throwing him into a tough job 
without enough preparation. 
</P>
<P>
Will the networks ever learn? 
</P>
<P>
The fickle business of broadcasting claimed another victim this week: Channel 9 
sportscaster Scott St. James. 
</P>
<P>
St. James, a fixture at Channel 9 the past 7 1/2 years, was let go in the 
housecleaning done by Disney, the station's new owner. 
</P>
<P>
St. James, who will leave the station Nov. 3, was the last of the old Channel 9 
news team to be given a pink slip. 
</P>
<P>
His replacement will be Joe Fowler, former Philadelphia sportscaster who has 
done some fill-in work at Channel 4. Fowler is sort of a poor man's Todd 
Donoho. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 9, which goes to a format with three hours of nightly news on Jan. 15, 
will add two more sportscasters before then. 
</P>
<P>
The station is said to be interested in Jim Hill, but Hill is still under 
contract to Channel 7, and his agent, Ed Hookstratten, said a move is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Other possibilities include Alan Massengale, former ESPN sports anchorman now 
working for the ABC affiliate in Miami; Terry Chick, who was at CNN until Oct. 
1, and Eric Clemens of ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
So what's next for St. James, a likable and popular sportscaster? 
</P>
<P>
"I might start selling jewelry . . . my jewelry," he said, trying to make light 
of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Shaky debut: Paul Olden, who became the host of KMPC's "Sportsline" this week, 
has a fine voice, but the early impression is that, as a talk-show host, he 
talks too slowly and is too bland. 
</P>
<P>
He's got to pick up the pace if he's going to compete with KABC's Superfan, who 
keeps things moving on his show. Also, Olden should cut back on interviews. 
Most are simply boring. 
</P>
<P>
On a talk show, the callers should be the stars. 
</P>
<P>
Olden has had some technical problems, as well. Monday night, he let his first 
caller, a Notre Dame fan, ramble on too long, for which he apologized the next 
night. 
</P>
<P>
And Tuesday night, four times during Healy's half-hour-plus show, Olden left 
the mike on in his studio, and a conversation with his producer was going out 
over the air. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Healy said: "Will somebody please go into Paul Olden's studio and tell 
him to turn off his mike." 
</P>
<P>
Who goofed? No doubt about this one. It was Olden. 
</P>
<P>
Olden, a news assistant for KLAC in 1978, was the person who asked Dodger 
Manager Tom Lasorda, after Dave Kingman of the Chicago Cubs had three home runs 
and eight RBIs against the Dodgers, that infamous question: "What did you think 
of Kingman's performance." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, more than 11 years later, Lasorda, a surprise guest on Olden's show, 
apologized for his outburst. 
</P>
<P>
It's about time. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
Look for ABC-TV to play it relatively straight when it resumes World Series 
coverage today at 5 p.m., PDT. The network isn't saying what it has planned for 
the pregame show, but don't expect any fancy openings or glitzy features. . . . 
CBS Radio will focus on the earthquake aftermath on its pregame show, which 
begins at 5:07. 
</P>
<P>
ABC will donate two 30-second public service spots each night on World Series 
telecasts in which players will ask for donations for earthquake relief. . . . 
Channel 2's Keith Olbermann, who delivered a lengthy, impassioned editorial 
last Sunday night asking viewers to donate to earthquake relief funds, put his 
money where his mouth is and contributed half-a-week's salary. . . . Here's a 
good idea: Joey Altobelli, owner of Joey's La Brique, a sports bar-restaurant 
in Bellflower, says he will show the Series games on a big screen, offer a free 
buffet and contribute 25 cents of every bar dollar to earthquake relief. 
</P>
<P>
It's a good college football Saturday, highlighted by an ESPN doubleheader of 
Pittsburgh-Notre Dame at 2 p.m., followed by Miami-Florida State. That's four 
top-10 teams, including Nos. 1 and 2. . . . UCLA will be on ABC at 12:30 p.m. 
for the second straight week (hasn't anyone told ABC that UCLA is no good this 
season?), and USC will be on Prime Ticket at 3:30 p.m. . . . Now figure this 
one out: You get a top-notch doubleheader on ESPN, Alabama-Penn State on CBS, 
Michigan-Indiana and UCLA-Washington on ABC and USC-Stanford on Prime Ticket, 
and it costs you nothing. Yet, on Sports- Channel, a pay service costing as 
much as $12 a month, you get Tulane-Virginia Tech, Eastern Michigan-Central 
Michigan, delayed no less, and a replay of Pitt-Notre Dame at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' game against the Bears in Chicago Sunday will be on Channel 2 at 10 
a.m., with Pat Summerall and John Madden making their first Los Angeles 
appearance of the season. On Channel 4 at 1 p.m., it will be the San Diego 
Chargers against the Seahawks at Seattle, with Charlie Jones and Merlin Olsen. 
. . . NBC has gone down a notch or two since replacing Olsen with Bill Walsh on 
its No. 1 announcing team. . . . NBC showed a lengthy feature on Walsh during 
its pregame show last Sunday. It was a nice piece but very self-serving. 
</P>
<P>
The Dream Bowl, with the 1972 Miami Dolphins facing the 1978 Pittsburgh 
Steelers, will be on ESPN Sunday at 5 p.m. An Elvis Presley impersonator will 
conduct the coin flip and reportedly will leave two tickets for Houston Oiler 
Coach Jerry Glanville. . . . A week from Sunday, ESPN's real NFL schedule 
begins with Dallas at Washington at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
It was noted in this space last week that the Kings, increasing in popularity, 
now have a radio network. But the Kings still have a way to go. Their game last 
Saturday at St. Louis was knocked off KLAC by a Laker exhibition game, and was 
carried by KGIL, which delayed its broadcast until 10 p.m. KGIL preempted the 
Kings to carry a Cal State Northridge football game. Yes, Cal State Northridge.

VALENZUELA SUSPENDED FOR DAY; 
</P>
<P>
JOCKEY: STEWARDS TO DECIDE TODAY IF FURTHER PENALTIES ARE NECESSARY FOR RIDER 
WHO TESTED POSITIVE FOR COCAINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jockey Pat Valenzuela, who tested positive for cocaine in a urine sample 
collected Oct. 20, was removed from his mounts Thursday at Santa Anita but the 
board of stewards delayed until this morning their decision on further 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
The stewards also are investigating an apparent breakdown in communication 
between their drug testing laboratory and local racing board investigators. 
According to several sources, a laboratory representative told a racing board 
investigator last Sunday that Valenzuela's Oct. 20 sample had tested clean 
when, in fact, results of the test had not been confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of that report -- given over the phone -- the stewards allowed 
Valenzuela to be named on horses this week. Then, late Wednesday afternoon, the 
stewards received formal documentation of Valenzuela's positive test. 
</P>
<P>
The delay in the ruling also left trainer Charlie Whittingham and majority 
owner Arthur Hancock without a definite rider on Kentucky Derby winner Sunday 
Silence for the $3-million Breeders' Cup Classic at Gulfstream Park Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my policy to leave any jockey decisions up to the trainer," Hancock said 
from his Stone Farm in Lexington, Ky. "Charlie's got much more experience in 
these matters than I do." 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham said: "I won't make a decision on who rides the colt until the 
stewards make their decision." 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham did prepare for Valenzuela's possible suspension, however, by 
letting Chris McCarron work Sunday Silence six furlongs Thursday morning. The 
sleek black colt responded with a clocking of 1:12 1/5, which was the fastest 
workout of the day at the distance. 
</P>
<P>
"If something should happen that Pat can't ride, I wanted to make sure Chris 
had a feel of the horse," Whittingham said. 
</P>
<P>
After praising Sunday Silence's workout, McCarron said that he looked forward 
to the possibility of riding the colt in the Classic. 
</P>
<P>
"You never like to benefit from another person's misfortune," said McCarron, 
who won the 1988 Classic on Alysheba. "But I would be lying if I said I don't 
want to ride Sunday Silence." 
</P>
<P>
Steward Pete Pedersen said he and fellow stewards Hubert S. Jones and Thomas 
Ward had the option of "suspension, fine or referral of the case to the racing 
commission" in the Valenzuela matter. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize there is a need to resolve the situation because the Breeders' Cup 
is so close," Pedersen said. "But even though we believe we have all the facts 
at hand, we felt it best to take a day to consider everything before making a 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
The stewards met for more than two hours Thursday morning with Valenzuela, his 
attorney Steve Schwartz, two members of the local racing board investigative 
unit, and Jay Weiss, vice president of BPL Toxicology Laboratories in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
According to Pedersen, a lab technician at BPL told racing board investigator 
Jeff Crandall last Sunday that Valenzuela's Oct. 20 sample had tested negative 
for a list of controlled substances, among them cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Pedersen noted further that another of Valenzuela's samples, collected last 
Sunday, had tested negative for all substances in a report issued Tuesday. It 
was not until Wednesday that the stewards received official word on the Oct. 20 
test, a delay caused apparently by the necessity to confirm the presence of 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"We are now satisfied that Pat did test positive," Pedersen said Thursday after 
the hearing. "There was obviously a misunderstanding between the lab and the 
investigator on that telephonic report, and that's something we are looking 
into. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes us (the stewards) feel like suckers, to go ahead and let the rider be 
named on horses," Pedersen added. "However, in this particular case the 
miscommunication is a red herring. The only important thing is the test itself. 
And from the experts we've talked to, it is accurate." 
</P>
<P>
Weiss said Thursday that BPL president and technical supervisor Nissan Pardo 
would be interviewing the lab technician who issued Sunday's oral report on 
Valenzuela's test, and would pass along his findings to the Santa Anita 
stewards. 
</P>
<P>
"Beyond that, I don't think it would appropriate to comment further on the 
matter," Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Kilpack, the Southern Region supervisor of racing board investigators, was 
conducting his own inquiry into the incident. He noted that the racing board 
had been using the BPL drug-testing services for jockeys and other licensed 
personnel for about 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
"We have received verbal reports from BPL many times in the past, but this is 
the very first time something has gone wrong," Kilpack said. "I would imagine 
there will be some changes in-house in terms of verifying any reports in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Schwartz, Valenzuela's attorney, said that the discrepancy in lab reports 
would be considered in any legal response the jockey might have to the 
stewards' ultimate ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"But there are a lot of considerations to be made, and not only regarding the 
tests," Schwartz said. "Certainly the human factor must be taken into account, 
and the well-being of the individual involved." 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz would not say if Valenzuela would seek an injunction to continue 
riding in the event a suspension is handed down. 
</P>
<P>
The last time a jockey was suspended because of a positive drug test in 
Southern California was in February, 1987, when Martin Pedroza got a 20-day 
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
In March of 1988, Valenzuela was suspended indefinitely for failing to honor 
riding commitments. He was reinstated six months later after spending the 
summer competing at Hawthorne Race Course in Chicago. Valenzuela has been 
tested regularly since his return, but not nearly as often in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
"In 20 to 30 tests, Pat has never had a positive before," Pedersen said. "But 
he has been a concern for some time." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela's struggle with drug dependency received national attention last May 
when he won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes aboard Sunday Silence, 
defeating the darling of the East Coast, Easy Goer, in both races. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer bounced back to defeat Sunday Silence in the subsequent Belmont 
Stakes, which set up the ultimate showdown between the two colts in the 
Breeders' Cup Classic. The winner figures to be voted horse of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham, who is also 25% owner of Sunday Silence, was sticking steadfastly 
by the beleaguered Valenzuela in the midst of the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's suspended, then he can't ride him, can he?" Whittingham said. "But 
until something happens, Valenzuela is No. 1 and McCarron is No. 2."

DRUG-TEST PROCEDURE NEEDS SOME REVISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes to cocaine testing, California racing officials can't seem to get 
it right the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the issue wasn't whether jockeys were sniffing the drug, it 
was whether trainers were giving it to their horses. Horse racing officials 
accused Wayne Lukas and Laz Barrera, two of the sport's best known trainers, 
and four lesser-known trainers of just that. 
</P>
<P>
Now, months later, five of the six cases have evaporated, and the sixth, 
against Roger Stein, also appears to be desolving. The state admitted having 
lost data in its testing laboratory and on a refrigerated railroad car when 
many samples accidentally broke. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Pat Valenzuela's drug test is negative one day, but positive a few days 
later. Valenzuela, who despite at least three stays at rehabilitation clinics, 
has never received a suspension because of drug use -- a record that is 
expected to end today. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela could be in a position to challenge another ruling by the stewards 
because of the latest foul-up. 
</P>
<P>
"Verbally, the report was negative," one of the Oak Tree stewards said. "But 
when the written report came in, it was positive. There was a mistake made in 
communications." 
</P>
<P>
The process is involved. The urine sample is sent from the track to the 
laboratory, in Tarzana. The laboratory runs the test and sends the result to 
the racing board in Sacramento. The board relays the result to a field agent at 
the track. The agent then notifies the stewards. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though there was a contradiction, the important thing is that Pat did not 
do any riding before the correct test result was obtained," steward Pete 
Pedersen said. 
</P>
<P>
But the stewards got lucky. It was possible that Valenzuela could have been 
riding before they obtained the revised result. 
</P>
<P>
The process for testing horses is just as intricate, but it is less likely that 
a contaminated horse will run another race before the chain of checkpoints is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
With jockeys, it's different. Jockeys caught under the influence are capable of 
imperiling other riders, who are trying to navigate skittish horses running as 
fast as 35 miles per hour. That's a more important issue than the one related 
to giving owners, trainers and the betting public a bum run for their money. 
</P>
<P>
At Santa Anita Thursday, there was more talk about Valenzuela than horses, and 
there were wild stories about what the stewards will do. One was that 
Valenzuela was going to get a year's suspension. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling can't be nearly that severe, because technically this is his first 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
The stewards could be responsible for that. Although they have tested him 
hundreds of times, the method has been scattershot. Even though Valenzuela 
missed two consecutive days earlier this season, he was not tested until after 
he was a no-show to ride favored Hawkster in a $500,000 race. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the second reading on Valenzuela's first test, conversations with 
the stewards this week got confusing. When they said he had tested positive, it 
was assumed that they were referring to his second test. Only a chance question 
resulted in the revelation that the first test wasn't negative after all. 
</P>
<P>
There's a need to test properly, but test swiftly. It shouldn't be that 
complicated. Since the safety of other jockeys is at stake, couldn't the chain 
of action be revised? Couldn't the stewards be notified first if there's a 
positive, so they can flag the offender for an immediate hearing? 
</P>
<P>
The California Horse Racing Board is getting around to some of these problems. 
At a meeting of its medication committee next month, one of the items to be 
discussed is the horse-testing laboratory's obligation "to produce timely 
reports." 
</P>
<P>
Timeliness with the testing of jockeys is even more important.

When the USC Trojans arrived in South Bend, Ind., last Thursday to play Notre 
Dame, they were greeted by the first snowstorm of the season and temperatures 
in the 30s. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Coach Larry Smith noticed that Bill Schultz, one of his offensive 
linemen, was still shivering. 
</P>
<P>
"Didn't you thaw out yet?" Smith asked. 
</P>
<P>
Said Schultz: "Oh, I slept with the window open last night because I wanted to 
get used to the weather." 
</P>
<P>
A week later, some players, walking around with colds and flu symptoms, still 
haven't gotten the cold weather out of their systems. 
</P>
<P>
Or the crushing memories of a demoralizing weekend. 
</P>
<P>
They have practiced all week, struggling to get their bodies ready for Stanford 
Saturday at the Coliseum. But the biggest battle is to get their minds off last 
week's 28-24 loss. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I think about it, it brings bad feelings," USC linebacker Scott 
Ross said. "So, I don't want to talk about it. Thinking about Notre Dame gives 
you a sick feeling in the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough game. It was a good game, but I've tried to totally forget 
everything about it until next year. I'll come back next year focusing on 
beating the Irish, but as of right now, I'm looking forward to the Rose Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
As far as Ross is concerned, there will be no letdown Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"What I want to do the most right now is get back on the field," he said. "I 
wanted to get back on the field last Sunday just so I could feel better and do 
something. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to win a game. And to feel better, we're going to have to beat 
Stanford. I have something I have to prove to myself. I have a lot of built-up 
frustrations right now that I want to take out on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Smith admitted that he's had as much trouble as he could ever remember changing 
mental gears, switching off the Notre Dame game and switching on film of 
Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
He told his players in the locker room at Notre Dame to cry if they felt the 
need to get the feelings out. Monday, he followed his regular schedule, showing 
the Trojans the film of their last game, painful as it might have been. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked at the film very quickly," Smith said. "We didn't dwell on it. Got 
it over with. We showed the offensive players only the offense. And we showed 
the defense only the defense. Got right into our Stanford scouting report and 
on out to practice. And I think that helped." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would have done anything differently, after watching the game film, 
Smith replied, "I would have liked to have had 12 or 13 guys on the field to 
tackle Tony Rice." 
</P>
<P>
The key to the game, as expected, was the ability of quarterback Rice to run 
the option against USC's defense, No. 1 in the nation against the rush going 
in. It turned out to be the irresistible force against the movable object. 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Irish, led by Rice with 99 yards on the ground, amassed 266 net 
yards rushing with their option offense. Putting that into perspective, the 
Trojans had allowed only 220 yards on the ground all season going into the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"We tended to be a little bit too aggressive," Ross said. "We were on our toes 
coming in for the dives. We hadn't gone against a good run team until Notre 
Dame. Last year, we had 10 games to prepare for Notre Dame's run. This year, 
we've been playing passing teams. We all had to switch gears. We were so used 
to a pass rush and taking guys down the middle (on passing routes). There were 
a few mistakes that the linebackers made that caused big plays. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have it down for Arizona (on Nov. 11 at Tucson). That's what I'm looking 
forward to. We'll get another chance to go against the option against Arizona. 
But right now, I just want to get back on the field against Stanford and stuff 
their run." 
</P>
<P>
Smith believes that his team will be ready to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can automatically expect everybody to bounce right back," he 
said. "We've got to get back, but you don't do that by automatically saying 
everything is fine. You've got to get back on the field and get a victory. That 
will get you back up. But the other guy isn't going to cooperate. You've got to 
go out and earn it." 
</P>
<P>
Although there will be no national championship this year, the Trojans, who 
dropped from ninth to 10th in the rankings, remain unbeaten and on top in the 
Pacific 10 Conference, with an excellent chance of reaching the Rose Bowl for 
the third consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just like my freshman year," said Ross, a junior. "We lost to Notre 
Dame. I got a chance to start, and we won four victories in a row. We got to go 
to the Rose Bowl and it changed our whole season around. It made it a good 
season. It got rid of all the bad things like losing to Michigan State (in the 
opener), smoothed all the rough spots out. 
</P>
<P>
"So that's what we're looking for now. We can make this a great season. We need 
to win a Rose Bowl. We've been to them, but we need to win one." 
</P>
<P>
Smith also emphasized that the Trojans' goal is to win a Rose Bowl game, after 
losing the last two. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to count your blessings and look at what you have achieved," he 
said. "That's our main thrust. Hey, we're back in the Pac-10. A lot can be 
accomplished. We've got to put this behind us. But you just don't shrug it off. 
It's got to work it's way out." 
</P>
<P>
One image from Saturday's game will remain vivid for a while. 
</P>
<P>
It was moments after the final gun. Smith entered a small room to meet the 
media. Sitting at a table in close quarters with a microphone in front of him, 
he waited while about 50 reporters and broadcasters filed in. 
</P>
<P>
"Any questions?" he finally asked, obviously anxious to get it over with. 
</P>
<P>
At that instant, the Notre Dame band emerged from a tunnel below the room and 
marched up to a gate where fans were waiting. Once there, they marched in place 
while playing the Notre Dame fight song. 
</P>
<P>
The noise was so overwhelming, Smith and the gathered media were temporarily 
unable to hear one another. 
</P>
<P>
So there Smith sat, forced to grit his teeth and listen to the Fighting Irish 
victory song one more time with the spotlight on him. It was the final 
indignity of a long day. 
</P>
<P>
Some things take awhile to shrug off.

The Sacramento Kings signed top draft pick Pervis Ellison and veteran forward 
Wayman Tisdale in deals that reportedly will bring the players about $11 
million each over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Ellison, a forward-center, was the first player selected overall in the 1989 
NBA college draft and the last signed. He is recovering from surgery on Sept. 
27 to remove bone spurs on his right foot and ankle, and it was not clear when 
he would play. 
</P>
<P>
Tisdale came to the Kings in February for LaSalle Thompson and Randy Wittman. 
In 31 games for the Kings, he averaged 19.8 points and a team-best 9.6 
rebounds.

ONCE MARA CHANGED HIS MIND, WAY WAS PAVED FOR TAGLIABUE

For the last four months, Wellington Mara, president of the New York Giants, 
has led the fight to make Jim Finks the National Football League's 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
But at an early hour Thursday, when most of the other owners were asleep, Mara 
and his principal confederate in the Finks faction, Art Modell of the Cleveland 
Browns, gave up. 
</P>
<P>
They decided to vote with the three others on the new, unique five-man 
committee that recommended Paul Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
And when Mara yielded, so did most of his old-guard followers, putting 
Tagliabue in. 
</P>
<P>
Why did the Giants' 74-year-old owner change his mind? 
</P>
<P>
Citing three reasons Thursday, Mara said: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "We wanted both men to jointly take over -- with Tagliabue as commissioner 
and Finks as president -- but that proved impossible when Finks declined. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "(The Finks people) were obviously fighting a losing battle, and it would 
have been detrimental to the league to go on fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Above all, I didn't want to go outside the league for a commissioner. If 
we hadn't chosen one of these two, that would have happened. And I feel that 
taking a (commissioner) without an NFL background would have been much worse 
than this -- the worst thing we could do." BOB OATES

TAGLIABUE IS PRAISED BY COLLEAGUES IN LEGAL PROFESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHERWA, TIMES ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are few people more familiar with the problems of the National Football 
League than Paul Tagliabue. It has been his rather difficult job to defend the 
league against the glut of lawsuits that contributed to Pete Rozelle's 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue was the loser in the suit brought by the Los Angeles Coliseum 
Commission against the NFL for antitrust violations. The jury awarded the 
commission about $20 million in damages for the league's violations of 
antitrust laws. The suit cost the NFL $10 million in legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, he was the loser in the suit brought by the United States Football 
League against the NFL. However, the USFL asked for $1.6 billion but was 
awarded only $3 in damages. That defense cost the NFL $26 million in legal fees 
and greatly enhanced Tagliabue's reputation among the league's owners. 
</P>
<P>
And he was the loser in the Raiders' antitrust suit against the NFL for trying 
to stop the team's move to Los Angeles from Oakland. The NFL had to pay $20 
million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue joined the powerful Washington law firm of Covington &amp; Burling in 
1969. After being made a partner, he almost exclusively handled the league's 
Washington affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the losses, Tagliabue's reputation as an excellent antitrust lawyer has 
remained intact. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of his selection as NFL commissioner was met with equal 
enthusiasm by his courtroom opponents and supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a fine gentleman and a scholarly lawyer, and unlike his predecessor he 
may pay some attention to antitrust laws," said Max Blecher, an attorney who 
represented the Coliseum Commission against the NFL. "He'll keep them on the 
straight and narrow, I hope. They need it." 
</P>
<P>
Harry Pregerson, formerly a U.S. district judge now at the 9th U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals, also had positive recollections of Tagliabue during the 
Coliseum trial. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an outstanding lawyer and certainly has a complete understanding of how 
the league functions, knows all the owners and I'm sure many of the players," 
Pregerson said, while admitting that he has never seen an NFL game in person or 
on television. "He made some cogent arguments, and my impressions were always 
very favorable and straightforward." 
</P>
<P>
Peter K. Leisure, the U.S. district judge who heard the USFL-NFL trial, was 
also impressed with Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a man for all seasons, even though we're only talking about a fall 
season," Leisure said from his office in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"He takes great care in approaching very difficult problems, shows patience and 
thoroughness and above all has a high intellect. I could not be more pleased to 
hear that he would be at the helm during difficult times as well as good times 
for the National Football League and professional sports in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue is a specialist in antitrust law and the author of "Antitrust 
Developments in Sports and Entertainment," which appeared in the Antitrust Law 
Journal. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Sullivan, a professor at the University of California and one of the 
country's leading experts on antitrust law, said the choice of Tagliabue is a 
good one. 
</P>
<P>
"I have general impressions of him as being a very competent, rather balanced 
type of person and probably a wise choice," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
Antitrust legislation is at the heart of the NFL problems. The league has long 
contended that its monopolistic practices are used to increase competition 
rather than to discourage it. Tagliabue told Fortune magazine: "Any normal 
business can decide where it wants a plant, but we're treated like a group of 
conspirators rather than a meeting of the board." 
</P>
<P>
This is a view that the courts have not accepted, instead ruling that each team 
is a separate entity. The NFL has long sought an exemption similar to the one 
granted major league baseball. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes said 
in 1922 that baseball is a national pastime and exempt from antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue also represented the NFL in the suit filed by the National Football 
League Players Assn. after the 1987 strike. The matter is yet to be decided by 
a Minneapolis court. 
</P>
<P>
Still, his reputation is not one of being anti-union. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have him listed as a union buster," said Virginia Diamond, an 
attorney with the AFL-CIO. "We've never considered Covington &amp; Burling a 
union-busting firm." 
</P>
<P>
Gene Upshaw, executive director of the NFLPA, said that he expects good 
relations with the new commissioner. "I want to congratulate Paul Tagliabue on 
his selection as NFL commissioner and I look forward to working with him," 
Upshaw said in a statement. "I have always found him a straight-forward 
thinking type of person interested in resolving differences."

</P>
<P>
The harness horse-of-the-year title won't be settled here, because Matt's

Matt's Scooter is also expected to be voted pacer of the year. Peace Corps 
could add to her credentials for trotter of the year by winning tonight's 
$335,701 3-year-old Filly Trot. She will break from No. 7 in an eight-horse 
field and will be driven by John Campbell, who has won a record 12 Breeders

MICHAEL NUNN MAKES A DEAL WITH LAS VEGAS HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Nunn, the International Boxing Federation middleweight champion, has 
signed an exclusive multiyear contract with the new Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas, 
The Times learned Thursday. A formal announcement is not expected for several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are under way for Nunn to fight at the Mirage for the first time 
in January against Marlon Starling, World Boxing Council welterweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not in a position to confirm or deny a deal with the Mirage," said Dan 
Goossen, Nunn's manager. A spokesman for Steve Wynn, the hotel's principal 
stockholder, confirmed only that talks have been held with Goossen. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, 34-0 with 23 knockouts, has not fought since retaining his title with a 
decision over Iran Barkley in August. Bob Arum, Nunn's promoter, severed his 
ties with Nunn and Goossen after the bout, claiming that the North Hollywood 
fighter's lack of punching power makes him impossible to promote. Goossen later 
said the split was over money. 
</P>
<P>
The 3,000-room Mirage is expected to open late next month. The first fight in 
its 16,000-seat arena will match Sugar Ray Leonard against Roberto Duran, for 
the third time, on Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
One source said Mirage officials want to delay an announcement regarding Nunn 
to keep the spotlight on Leonard-Duran III. 
</P>
<P>
Goossen said of Starling: "He's at the top of our list, but we have three other 
options. We could fight Lindell Holmes or John Mugabi or wait until after Dec. 
7. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not written in stone that Ray will fight Tommy (Hearns) if he beats 
Roberto. Should Roberto win, there is a possibility he could fight Michael. 
Roberto could win in a fight with Ray. He has risen to that level before."

MARKETING: WITH BEER INDUSTRY SALES GOING FLAT, ANHEUSER-BUSCH GOES AFTER A 
BIGGER MARKET SHARE BY CUTTING PRICES.

Beer drinkers have reason to rejoice: A price war is brewing between the 
nation's beer makers. 
</P>
<P>
But anti-alcohol forces can rejoice some, too: The price-cutting is further 
evidence that Americans are drinking in moderation. 
</P>
<P>
A big shot was fired in the beer war Wednesday when Anheuser-Busch made a 
surprise announcement that it would "reluctantly" begin discounting its brands, 
which include the premium Michelob and best-selling Budweiser. A statement like 
that is important because it comes from the world's largest brewer. In the 
United States, the St. Louis giant commands 42% of the $50-billion beer market. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a beer war in this country for the past 18 months, but we've 
really tried to stay above the fray," said Jerry Ritter, Anheuser-Busch's chief 
financial officer, in the wake of the company's disappointing third-quarter 
earnings report. "Now, we are joining the fray." 
</P>
<P>
Despite its huge share of the beer market, Anheuser-Busch has suffered like 
other brewers from beer consumption that has been as flat as stale ale for most 
of the 1980s. So the only way to build future earnings, the company said, is to 
increase its share of the market. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Miller Brewing, a Philip Morris unit based in Milwaukee, denied 
that the company had cut prices but said Miller did enjoy record sales in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
The Anheuser-Busch announcement surprised many industry observers. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a very dramatic development," said Paul Gillette, publisher of Beverage 
Hotline in Los Angeles. "It was quite unexpected." Julie Neimann, a securities 
analyst for Stifel Nicolaus in St. Louis, predicted "flat-out war." 
</P>
<P>
Still, beer drinkers will likely find only modest reductions, perhaps 5%, or 
about 20 cents a six-pack, predicted Jerry Steinman, publisher of Beer Market's 
Insight. "It'll mean some slight savings for consumers, but they'll never bring 
it down a tremendous amount." 
</P>
<P>
Six-packs of Budweiser, Miller Genuine Draft and Coors generally cost about 
$3.50, although the companies frequently knock the price below $3 in selected 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
The price cutting is likely to rile the nation's "neo-prohibitionists," said 
Max Kerstein, editor of Beverage Bulletin in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Taylor, who directs the alcohol project for the Washington-based 
Center for Science in the Public Interest, said she would be concerned if the 
reductions spark a sharp increase in beer consumption and alcohol-related 
health and safety problems. But, she added, the longer-term significance may be 
that moderation is spreading among U.S. consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"The beer companies are reacting to larger forces in our society that are 
speaking out against alcohol and alcohol-related problems," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
The Center for Science in the Public Interest played a key role in prodding 
Congress to enact legislation last year requiring that health warnings be 
placed on alcoholic beverages and posted where they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
The price-cutting announcement by Anheuser-Busch came as the company reported 
that third-quarter profit increased a modest 5.2% to $238.3 million while sales 
rose 6.1% to $2.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
A number of analysts reacted by lowering their earnings predictions for 
Anheuser-Busch. And investors responded by making Anheuser-Busch the second 
most actively traded stock Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, where its 
price dropped $4.375 to $38.50 a share. It shed another 50 cents on Thursday 
and was the most actively traded stock, with nearly 4.3 million shares changing 
hands. It was followed by Philip Morris, owner of Miller Brewing, with 3.66 
million shares traded. Philip Morris closed at $41.625, off $1.875. 
</P>
<P>
Anheuser-Busch President August A. Busch III said the brewer was "very 
reluctant" to discount beer prices but added: "We cannot permit a further 
slowing in our volume trend." Busch said discounted prices will further slow 
earnings growth next year but predicted that the strategy would increase market 
share and eventually swell profits.

REBATES, PRODUCTION CUTS BLAMED FOR 27.5% DROP IN AUTO PROFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Costly customer rebates and production cutbacks took their toll on the nation's 
Big Three auto makers, which reported sharply lower third-quarter profits 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Combined profits for General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler fell about 27.5% 
during the quarter ended Sept. 30, and industry analysts say they do not expect 
conditions to improve in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"If the new models don't move and they have to give these incentives again, it 
could be just as bad," said Bob Bernstein, an analyst at Edward D. Jones &amp; 
Co., a St. Louis brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
General Motors reported third-quarter profit of $516.9 million, a 40% decline 
from the same period last year. Revenue during the third quarter rose slightly 
to $28.79 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's No. 2 auto maker, Ford Motor, reported a 44.3% slide in 
third-quarter profit to $477.1 million, while revenue fell less than 1% to 
$20.24 billion. Ford, which has been the industry's most profitable player, 
said it had a third-quarter loss in its domestic operations of $37 million -- 
the first quarterly loss in its U.S business since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
At Chrysler, a one-time gain nearly tripled profit to $331 million for the 
third quarter. The gain was the result of Chrysler's sale of nearly half its 
interest in Mitsubishi Motors Corp. of Japan for $309 million. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding the extraordinary gain, however, Chrysler's profit skidded 77.3%. 
Third-quarter revenue remained nearly unchanged at $7.88 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The news triggered a drop in the auto stocks on Wall Street. Chrysler fell 37.5 
cents to $22.25; Ford closed at $47.50, down 37.5 cents, and General Motors 
declined 50 cents to $44.375. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts had expected such poor showings given the rash of incentives -- 
including cash rebates and low interest rate financing -- that took place 
during the quarter. "These earnings were very much in line with expectations, 
as miserable as they were," said analyst Harvey Heinbach at Merrill Lynch 
Research. 
</P>
<P>
Heinbach noted that profits were also pushed down by a 13% decline in auto 
production in the quarter as the Big Three wrestled to thin out inventories. 
Ironically, it was excessive production during the begining of the year that 
bloated inventories and forced the auto makers take steps to boost sales, 
Heinbach said. 
</P>
<P>
The third quarter is traditionally the weakest time of year for auto sales, 
analysts said. And trying to match the performance of last year, when sales and 
profits set records for many of the companies, will be tough. 
</P>
<P>
Sales and profits usually take off during the fourth quarter as the new models 
arrive in showrooms. But auto makers are still cutting back on production and 
are still using incentives to boost sluggish sales. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at fourth-quarter figures to be down fairly significantly," said 
Heinbach. "Incentives are continuing at a fairly hefty pace."

CONSUMER AFFAIRS: CON MEN EAGER TO COMPOUND DISASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S.J. DIAMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the third day after the earthquake, San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith had 
to issue public warnings about the thieves and con men who had surfaced, 
instantly, to rip off a stunned populace. 
</P>
<P>
For all the good they bring out in people, natural disasters apparently bring 
out some bad as well. Like volunteer relief workers, thieves and con men are 
drawn to major disruptions. Even honest businesses, inherently opportunistic, 
are aware that when they do good they do good for themselves as well. 
</P>
<P>
Areas untouched by a disaster are not untapped. Their residents know that next 
time it could be their disaster, and, fearful, they make a fertile market for 
exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the trouble in San Francisco is not exploitation, but out-and-out theft 
-- what Smith calls "home invasion schemes." Working in pairs, the invaders 
pose as utility employees conducting an inspection (or relief workers or 
building inspectors). Once inside a house, they ask for change of a bill, note 
where the householder goes for the money and then, while one occupies the 
homeowner with some trumped-up problem, the other steals his money. 
</P>
<P>
More common yet are the kind of consumer rip-offs practiced in normal times and 
the "perennial favorites after a tornado or a flood," says Diane Ward, 
spokesman for the Council of Better Business Bureaus in Arlington, Va. Wherever 
disaster has struck or threatens, "99% of it is going to be something to do 
with home repair," says Herschel Elkins, California's assistant attorney 
general in charge of consumer protection. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of Hurricane Hugo in South Carolina, "con artists would scan a 
neighborhood," says Brandolyn Pinkston of the state consumer affairs department 
in Charleston, "get four or five people to pay them $400 or $500 up front, and 
never be seen again." Many con artists are transients with no local address or 
connections -- in other words, "someone against whom you have no recourse," she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
People whose homes were just damaged tend to rush into repairs, and officials 
in both South Carolina and California were quick to issue warnings: Within two 
days, California's Contractors State Licensing Board had blanketed the quake 
area with a flyer, "Earthquake Damage Repair -- Don't Get Nailed." Both states 
urge consumers to check whether a contractor is licensed, get several bids, and 
put up very little money ("A reputable local contractor can usually get credit 
and doesn't need money up front," says Pinkston). 
</P>
<P>
Disaster victims may also be visited by fake insurance adjusters claiming that 
for a fee, or for a percentage of the insurance money, they can get the 
homeowner more insurance money. They may do nothing; they may help fill out a 
claim request. South Carolinians also had con men "posing as FEMA (Federal 
Emergency Management Agency) agents," says Pinkston, "telling people they could 
hurry through their request for a certain amount of money." 
</P>
<P>
Price gouging is even more common, if less costly, given the size and value of 
the goods involved. Packages of flashlight batteries were sold for as much as 
$8 each in the Bay Area. In Charleston, a 79-cent bag of ice went for $12 and 
generators brought as much as $3,000 each. Price gouging is usually not 
addressed by specific laws, and only the most egregious cases would be 
prosecuted under state laws forbidding unfair and deceptive trade practices. 
During the emergency, South Carolina's governor issued an executive order 
prohibiting "excessive overcharges" on items of necessity -- defined as food, 
fuel, shelter and items used for protection of life or property. Overcharging 
was defined as a price "substantially in excess" of regular price or cost. 
</P>
<P>
Those same flashlight batteries now might be sold in Southern California for 
the same $8, plastic-bagged and labeled "Earthquake Preparedness Batteries." 
But that's not price gouging. "That's merchandising," says Smith wryly. 
</P>
<P>
Merchandising and price gouging come very close, of course, and there may be an 
equally fine line between helpfulness and opportunism. Southern Californians, 
the most empathetic of earthquake observers, already see and hear a lot of 
quake-related ads -- from a closet organizer offering "earthquake supply 
cabinets" of inch-thick fiberboard at $250 to $300 a cabinet, from a 
supermarket urging that everyone "stock up" for "earthquake emergencies" and 
outlining how to fill a $9.99, 32-gallon trash barrel with survival 
necessities, from a public TV station selling a $24.75 videotape of its show 
"Surviving The Big One." 
</P>
<P>
Then there are all the people selling "survival packs" and "preparedness kits" 
filled with little water pouches and dried food packets and Mylar space 
blankets and light sticks. These even contain emergency "beaded work gloves" 
and emergency books on "Coping with Children's Reaction to Disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Some of these offerings permit analysis and price comparison. Sparkletts' 
Earthquake Preparedness Package, for example. For $19.50 you get 12 one-gallon 
bottles of drinking water, a 50-hour "safety candle" and a four-hour "safety 
stove" (a little can of a "nonalcohol cooking fuel" even Sparkletts cannot 
identify). This is not ordinary bottled water, which is cheaper but has a shelf 
life. It's specially sealed to be fresh until the seal is broken, and the price 
includes boxing for storage and delivery. 
</P>
<P>
The convenience alone is worth the money to many people. It may even be worth 
the money -- and it's often considerable money -- when they're buying kits with 
all those little packets of substances that they can hardly understand, let 
alone compare to anything they've ever bought before. Indeed, most consumers 
who were asked about such purchases said they are well aware they could 
assemble their own kits for much less money, but haven't done it yet, aren't 
doing it now and probably will never get to it. 
</P>
<P>
More to the point, they don't need it yet -- the difference, perhaps, between a 
choice and a necessity, between merchandising and price gouging. But they 
should probably exercise that choice while they have it.

DEFICIT OFFSETS GOOD GNP, INFLATION NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The nation's economy expanded at an annual rate of 2.5% while inflation fell to 
2.9% in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said Thursday. But the 
favorable combination was accompanied by the worst quarterly trade performance 
in three years. 
</P>
<P>
A surge in domestic consumption caused imports to soar at an annual rate of 
15.1%, while exports of U.S. goods neither grew nor declined. As a result, the 
trade deficit increased by $22.9 billion, the biggest deficit since the second 
quarter of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The 2.5% growth rate in the gross national product matched the rate posted 
during the second quarter and followed a 3.7% annual rate during the first 
quarter of 1989, indicating that the economy has continued to slow without 
stumbling. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation, as measured by a price index tied to the GNP, fell to an annual rate 
of 2.9% in the third quarter from 5% in the second, the department said, 
underscoring other indications that prices are moderating after big gains 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
While the combination of temperate growth and declining inflation was hailed by 
the Bush Administration, the Dow Jones industrial index fell 39.55 points as 
financial markets focused on the worsening trade picture and an anemic 1.4% 
annual growth rate in final sales. 
</P>
<P>
"This is exactly the kind of GNP composition the Federal Reserve (Board) does 
not want to see: strong domestic demand, high consumer spending and a sharp 
deterioration in trade," said Giulio Martini, an economist with Sanford C. 
Bernstein &amp; Co. of New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported that personal consumption, which had increased 
at a modest annual rate of barely 2% during the first two quarters, ballooned 
to 5.8% in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Martini noted that the jump in consumer spending was fueled by a 15% increase 
in purchases of durable goods, mostly autos and trucks, and other big-ticket 
items that many economists would categorize as investments rather than 
consumption. Without those purchases, the increase in spending would have been 
about 4%. 
</P>
<P>
Martini said the collapse of export growth, which fell to zero after gaining at 
an annual rate of about 18% in the first half of the year, was an anomaly 
attributable to the dollar's recent strength against foreign currencies. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts took some comfort from the fact that Thursday's report, an advance 
estimate subject to revision, consisted of July and August data that was 
projected into September. In July and August, U.S. business invested heavily in 
foreign capital goods and U.S. consumers splurged on motor vehicles, many of 
them imports. 
</P>
<P>
Both trends are believed to be unsustainable and may not have continued into 
September at the same rate.

New York Post Ends Sunday Edition: The New York Post announced that it was 
dropping its Sunday edition Nov. 26 because of poor circulation, and union 
spokesmen said there were fears of other cutbacks. But Post owner and publisher 
Peter S. Kalikow, who bought the money-losing paper from Australian press 
magnate Rupert Murdoch, said he was ending the Sunday edition to focus on 
long-term profitability.

ODDBALL BUILDINGS NEED CARPET, TOO; 
</P>
<P>
ADVERTISING: A NEW DU PONT CAMPAIGN AIMED AT SMALL-BUSINESS OWNERS WILL USE 
CALIFORNIA STORES SHAPED LIKE THE PRODUCTS THEY CARRY TO INTRODUCE A NEW BRAND 
OF FLOOR COVERING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There will always be those who ridicule California as the home of the wacky. A 
new ad campaign for a Du Pont carpeting is about to give those critics more 
fodder. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign features some of the funkiest-looking mom-and-pop shops in the 
state. All are California businesses housed in buildings that look like the 
products they sell. 
</P>
<P>
There's the doughnut-shaped Donut Hole in La Puente. There's also the hot 
dog-like Tail O' the Pup in West Hollywood. And, of course, the camera-shaped 
Photo Express in Westminster. Not to forget a shoe repair store in Bakersfield 
that looks like a giant shoe. Also, a heavy-equipment company in Turlock in a 
building designed to look like a bulldozer. 
</P>
<P>
These -- and several other California small businesses -- are the off-the-wall 
centerpieces of a multimillion-dollar print and TV ad campaign for Du Pont 
Flooring Systems. The ads will all note: "No matter what they look like 
outside, businesses prefer Du Pont Certified Carpet inside." 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the ads is to introduce a new name-brand carpet -- Du Pont 
Certified. None of the ads show the carpet. None tell customers where to get 
the carpet. And none tell what the carpet costs. Rather, the ads simply use 
some of California's most architecturally unusual small businesses to try to 
catch the eyes of small-business owners. 
</P>
<P>
"Commercial carpeting is not the kind of thing that immediately leaps to 
peoples' minds," said Dave Nevergall, account supervisor at Rumrill Hoyt, the 
Rochester, N.Y., agency that created the campaign. "We're trying to attract 
attention in a way that will be memorable." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the ads will be memorable to some California residents. Of the 13 
offbeat locations that will appear in the TV and print ads, eight are in 
California. And those who own the small businesses featured in the ads are 
pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been used in ads before," said Eddie Blake, who has co-owned the 
43-year-old hot dog stand, Tail 'O the Pup, for 15 years. A recent picture of 
the stand in an advertisement for Haggar slacks boosted business a bit, he 
said. "People recognized the place in the ad, and they decided to come by." 
</P>
<P>
Photo Express, the drive-in film processing shop that looks like a camera, was 
also recently used in an ad for Avon. 
</P>
<P>
"People called from all over and told me they saw the ad," said Mary Dokter, 
who purchased the 11-year-old shop about a year ago. "But you don't really get 
a lot of customers from these kinds of ads. It's free coupons that bring in 
customers." 
</P>
<P>
Why did Du Pont select California businesses? "There just seems to be a greater 
number of these buildings in California," said Alan Trei, marketing programs 
manager at Du Pont's Flooring Systems division. "Sure, you can find some of 
these buildings in other places, but we didn't want to take a film crew all the 
way to say, Lexington, Ky., just for one shot." 
</P>
<P>
Despite this large ad campaign for carpeting, Du Pont doesn't actually make 
carpet. What Du Pont makes is the fiber that is used to make carpeting. In 
fact, no one makes more of it. Experts estimate that of the estimated $4.8 
billion in commercial carpeting sold last year in the United States, Du Pont 
fibers were woven into nearly half of them. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Du Pont wants more. "Obviously, their objective is to increase market 
share," said Ron VanGelderen, president of the Carpet &amp; Rug Institute, a 
trade group for carpet manufacturers based in Dalton, Ga. "They can probably do 
it, too." 
</P>
<P>
The way Du Pont executives figure it, every year about 8.5 million 
small-business owners buy new carpet -- without consulting designers. These are 
the customers that the new Du Pont campaign will try to reach. 
</P>

But at least one marketing expert thinks that Du Pont is way off base. 
</P>
<P>
"The ads seem to be equating Du Pont with something that is less than serious," 
said Donald Kanter, professor of marketing at Boston University. "None of this 
will make any sense to the guy who is serious about his business. And I assure 
you, most small-business people are very serious about their businesses."

SMALL BUSINESS: WHAT COMPANIES CAN DO TO SURVIVE A QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last week's Bay Area Quake probably inspired you to stockpile bottled water and 
batteries at home, but have you thought about how your business and your 
employees would survive a major disaster? 
</P>
<P>
Fire, safety and insurance experts say small businesses fare the worst during 
disasters because most are ill-prepared and under-insured for misfortune. Busy 
small-business owners rarely take the time to draft a disaster plan or even 
discuss how employees should react during an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not expensive to draw up a plan, make sure you have enough supplies and 
assign teams and team leaders," said Mark Williams, president of Williams 
Records Management in Los Angeles. The company stores important records for 
hospitals, banks and other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The Williams earthquake preparedness plan calls for the purchase of two-way 
radios to permit employees to communicate within the company's 
450,000-square-foot, six-story building. Their plan also includes ways to 
transfer vital records to emergency off-site locations and calls for the 
purchase of supplies ranging from fire extinguishers to first-aid kits. 
</P>
<P>
Williams and his brother, Doug, who is vice president of operations, started 
planning for emergencies about a year ago. Mark said they decided to think more 
about preparing for disasters because clients often asked for advice on how to 
reorganize an office after a fire or flood. 
</P>
<P>
To heighten awareness of the need to plan, Mark Williams has been sharing his 
disaster plan outline with fellow business owners at Rotary Club meetings and 
other gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
No one likes to think about tragedy, but with scenes of earthquake devastation 
fresh in your mind, it is the perfect time to review all your insurance 
coverages with your agent or broker. 
</P>
<P>
"Most small-business people consider insurance a necessary evil, and most are 
under-insured," said Ben Pelter, who founded a successful printing company 
before retiring. Pelter, who serves as a business counselor for the Service 
Corps of Retired Executives, said it pays to evaluate your insurance and shop 
around for the best prices. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance company executives whose representatives have been besieged with 
calls from California clients this week agree with Pelter. 
</P>
<P>
"Small-business owners should sit down with their insurance agent at least once 
a year and say, 'Hey, here's what I've got -- what are my options?' " said Don 
Hurzeler, assistant vice president of marketing for Allstate Insurance Co.'s 
business insurance division in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Hurzeler, who was an underwriting manager in Southern California after the 1971 
Sylmar earthquake, said many small-business owners are chronically 
under-insured because they want to save money. To cut costs, most 
small-business owners buy only the bare-bones liability insurance, vehicle 
insurance and workers' compensation insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of small- and medium-sized business owners don't think that they 
can afford earthquake or business interruption insurance, although these 
coverages may mean the difference between a quick recovery and permanent 
closing after a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
According to insurance executives, earthquake coverage can add 10% to 15% to 
the total premium. The cost of business interruption insurance, which covers 
all lost revenue and expenses, depends on the nature of your business. Business 
interruption insurance usually provides enough money to pay the bills, 
including rent, utilities and payroll, for 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
One enterprise benefiting from its lost revenue insurance is the San 
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, which lost a 30-foot concrete section in the Oct. 
17 quake. After the seventh day of interrupted service, the bridge's San 
Francisco-based insurance company, Fireman's Fund, began covering the lost 
income from tolls, according to Fireman's Fund spokesman Jim Toland. Each day, 
he said, the quarter-million cars crossing the bridge generate about $250,000 
in tolls. 
</P>
<P>
If a small business suffers earthquake or fire damage and does not have this 
type of insurance coverage, it might not only lose its customers but its 
employees. With no income, employees will have to find other jobs while the 
building is being repaired or new stock is being ordered. 
</P>
<P>
Although many business owners would like to have earthquake coverage, less than 
5% of the business insurance policies written by Transamerica Insurance include 
it, according to Glenn Thomas, director of commercial property insurance in 
Transamerica's Woodland Hills office. 
</P>
<P>
"We always see quite an influx of requests for earthquake coverage within three 
to six months after an earthquake, but then the requests fall rapidly," said 
Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
The premium for commercial earthquake coverage on buildings and inventory is 
based on the construction of the building and where it is located. Brick 
buildings cost more to insure than framed stucco or reinforced concrete 
buildings. Virtually all insurance companies require an on-site inspection 
before writing an earthquake policy. 
</P>
<P>
It might cost 5 cents per $100 of value to buy earthquake coverage for a 
high-rise in Sacramento, compared to $3 per $100 of value for a supermarket in 
a brick building in San Francisco, Transamerica's Thomas said. The average cost 
of commercial earthquake insurance is between 25 cents and 50 cents per $100 of 
value. 
</P>
<P>
How much insurance you carry depends on what kind of business you run. Most 
insurance companies sell a basic business owner's policy and a more expensive 
customized version. Optional coverages available include insurance for crime, 
broken glass, accounts receivable and valuable papers. Business personal 
property insurance covers stock, inventory, equipment and tenant's 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Panel Discussion Scheduled 
</P>
<P>
"Obtaining and Keeping New Business" will be the subject of a dinner and panel 
discussion sponsored by the Southern California Chapter of Women in 
Advertising. The Nov. 1 session begins at 6 p.m. at the Country Side Inn in 
Santa Ana. Four Orange County ad executives will be on the panel. The cost is 
$24.50 and reservations are required by Oct. 30. For information, call (714) 
631-6541. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subcontracting Session Slated 
</P>
<P>
A free, one-day seminar on subcontracting opportunities for minority-owned 
firms is set for Nov. 16. The session, sponsored by the Los Angeles Area 
Chamber of Commerce and the Defense Department, will run from 8:30 a.m. to 5 
p.m. at the Los Angeles Airport Hilton &amp; Towers, 5711 W. Century Blvd. in 
Westchester. For reservations and information, call the chamber at (213) 
629-0632. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW TO PREPARE 
</P>
<P>
Sit down with your insurance agent and review all your business coverages. 
Weigh the cost of earthquake or business interruption insurance against what 
would happen to your company after a major earthquake or fire. 
</P>
<P>
Create a disaster plan for your business. Make sure every employee knows what 
to do, who to call and where to go in case of an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Have a practice drill at least every six months to make sure people really know 
what to do. 
</P>
<P>
Check your business for potential fire hazards. Clear all aisles and hallways. 
Make sure no exit doors are blocked. Be sure your fire extinguishers all work 
and your employees all know how to use them. 
</P>
<P>
Store water, batteries, flashlights, blankets and non-perishable food in your 
office.

BRADY WANTS SEC TO BE ABLE TO CLOSE MARKETS DURING AN EMERGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM REDBURN , TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, taking issue with newly installed 
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard C. Breeden, endorsed a 
proposal Thursday that would give the SEC the right to shut down the stock 
market in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Breeden told lawmakers Wednesday that he did not want the authority to close 
securities markets, arguing that uncertainty over whether the SEC might halt 
trading could worsen market volatility. 
</P>
<P>
Brady, in contrast, said the SEC should be able to close the markets 
temporarily rather than requiring the President to make such a decision, as 
required by current law. 
</P>
<P>
And in a letter accompanying his testimony to the Senate Banking, Housing and 
Urban Affairs Committee, Brady said the initial governmental response to market 
emergencies should come "from a regulator with expertise and proximity to the 
markets." 
</P>
<P>
A bill under consideration by a House subcommittee would give the SEC authority 
to halt stock market trading during times of turmoil. Besides Brady, former SEC 
Chairman David S. Ruder has endorsed the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from that point, Brady -- in his first testimony to Congress since the 
Oct. 13 stock market plunge -- joined Breeden in supporting the bill, which 
would make several additional reforms in the way financial markets are 
regulated. 
</P>
<P>
Brady also defended the use of "circuit breakers" by futures and stock markets 
to halt trading briefly when prices plunge or soar beyond predetermined points. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 13, trading was halted temporarily in some futures markets by such 
mechanisms. But the New York Stock Exchange did not stop trading because the 
drop in the Dow Jones industrial index stayed below the 250-point level at 
which the exchange's circuit breaker is triggered. 
</P>
<P>
The use of circuit breakers, while voluntary, was assailed by Sen. Phil Gramm 
(R-Tex.), who said they represent an unwarranted restraint on free market 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
Brady also told lawmakers that he sees no need to take any legislative action 
to restrict leveraged buyouts, contending that the sharp rise in the use of 
LBOs is on the wane and that they "will end of their own weight." 
</P>
<P>
While not taking a direct stand, Brady hinted that he might be willing to 
support a proposal that would impose a profits tax of as much as 10% on pension 
funds that engage in excessive short-term trading. Under current law, pension 
funds are exempt from taxation. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, sponsored by Republican Sens. Nancy Landon Kassebaum and Bob Dole, 
both of Kansas, "is worthy of a good deal further study," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Brady -- a former Wall Street executive and chairman of a 
commission that investigated the October, 1987, market crash -- cautioned 
lawmakers against going too far in any efforts to eliminate market volatility. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot and should not attempt to eliminate major market moves, whether by 
legislation or regulation," he said. "But we do need to ensure that our markets 
are configured in the best manner possible to withstand the increasing demands 
that are placed on them." 
</P>
<P>
Because of sharp improvements in technology, it is now possible for markets to 
move much faster than they once did. Several analysts have noted that the 
190-point plunge in the Dow index that occurred in less than two hours on 
Friday the 13th was not necessarily any worse than a similar bear market 
decline in the past that might have been spread over a week or more. 
</P>
<P>
Brady said certain "market mechanisms" are now capable of producing sharp "down 
drafts," but that "one shouldn't be terrified" just because the stock market 
turns so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
To help improve market regulation, Brady said the Bush Administration supports 
changes that would require large securities transactions to be reported to the 
SEC and other agencies so that the agencies would have a better idea of who is 
buying and selling large blocks of stock during periods of sharp market swings. 
</P>
<P>
Other parts of the legislation that Brady favors included rules that would 
allow regulators to assess the financial soundness of the parent holding 
companies of brokerage houses. He also supported improved coordination in the 
clearing and settling of market transactions.

McDonnell Douglas Corp.: The diversified aerospace company said third-quarter 
profit fell 54% to $38 million due to higher interest expense, an operating 
loss in its transport aircraft segment and decreased earnings from its combat 
aircraft, missiles, space and electronics segments. The St. Louis firm said 
profit included $6 million from discontinued operations in its information 
systems area. Revenue rose 3% to $3.7 billion. The results included a pretax 
gain of $25 million from an insurance payment related to the loss of a leased 
aircraft.

Avon Products Inc.: The cosmetics company posted net income of $34.6 million in 
the third quarter, contrasted with a loss of $405.9 million in year-ago period, 
which was caused by a $425-million after-tax provision for discontinued 
operations. Revenue was $785.1 million, up 8% from last year. The New 
York-based company credited aggressive cost-cutting programs and strong sales 
in Latin America for its performance.

ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY, POOR EARNINGS REPORTS PUSH DOW DOWN 39.55 
</P>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market fell sharply Thursday in a volatile session, pounded by fresh 
uncertainty about the direction of the economy and more disappointing 
third-quarter corporate earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials fell 39.55 to 2,613.73, bringing its drop 
over the last four sessions to 75.41 points. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 11 to 4 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 406 up, 1,141 down and 410 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume was 175.24 million shares, against 155.65 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Before the opening the Commerce Department reported that the gross national 
product grew at a 2.5% annual rate, after adjustment for inflation, in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
That matched the increase posted for the second quarter and was in line with, 
or slightly stronger than, advance estimates in the financial world. 
</P>
<P>
But observers also said the report showed a buildup of inventories that 
betokened continued problems for the manufacturing sector of the economy, which 
has been struggling of late. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, analysts noted that worries about corporate profits, intensified 
by a series of disappointing reports from individual companies in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
A tally of the latest quarterly reports from about 430 companies by 
Prudential-Bache Securities through the end of last week led the firm to 
conclude that "so far we're looking at a very disappointing quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost twice as many companies have reported negative surprises as positive 
surprises," said Melissa Brown, a Prudential-Bache analyst. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo stock index moved sharply higher to flirt with a new record close 
before slipping back to end with a smaller gain Thursday. The 225-share Nikkei 
index surged 236.09 points to close at 35,678.49 after easing 84.15 Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, much lower than expected third-quarter pretax profits of 306 million 
pounds ($485 million) from chemicals company ICI prompted sharp falls among 
leading issues. The Financial Times 100-share index closed 32.5 points down at 
2,129.4. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices finished narrowly mixed as a new economic report provided no major 
surprises and traders shifted attention to next week's scheduled release of 
employment figures for October. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's key 30-year bond edged down 1/32 point, or about 30 cents per 
$1,000 in face amount. Its yield held steady at 7.88%, unchanged from late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the third-quarter GNP report wasn't likely to cause the Federal 
Reserve to change credit policy, and the news had little impact on trading. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term issues 
were off as much as 3/32 point, intermediate-term maturities were down 1/32 
point and long-term issues lost 1/16 point, according to Telerate Inc., a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8.75%, up slightly from 8.688% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar gained against most major currencies in U.S. trading, particularly 
the British pound, which plunged after the country's Treasury chief announced 
his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers unloaded sterling and bought dollars and West German marks 
following news of Nigel Lawson's decision to leave Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher's Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson, who had served as chancellor of the exchequer since 1983, said he was 
resigning because of differences with the prime minister's economic adviser, 
Sir Alan Walters. 
</P>
<P>
The pound, which had been quoted at $1.6130 when most trading ended in London, 
sank to $1.5995 on the few European markets still open after Lawson's sudden 
announcement. Later, in New York, sterling fetched $1.5780, down sharply from 
$1.6143 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Central banks, including the Federal Reserve, reportedly bought sterling to 
cushion its collapse, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the British government quickly appointed a replacement for Lawson, 
sterling was expected to remain under pressure with financial markets 
questioning the stability of Britain's economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar began its trading day in Tokyo by rising to a closing level of 
141.90 yen, up 0.35 yen from late Wednesday. Later in London, the dollar traded 
at 141.58 yen. The dollar ended New York trading at 142.125 yen, up from 141.57 
late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Wheat futures prices fell below $4 a bushel for the first time in a month on 
the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting disappointment that a newly expanded 
Soviet grain deal contains no incentives to boost wheat sales. 
</P>
<P>
Corn prices rose in Chicago while soybeans were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
On other futures markets, cocoa hit a new 16-year low; copper fell and precious 
metals climbed as the stock market dropped nearly 40 points; stock-index 
futures plunged; energy futures were mostly lower, and livestock and meat 
futures largely fell. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat futures settled 1.75 cents to 7 cents lower.

Imperial Corp. of America: The San Diego real estate holding and banking firm 
posted a third-quarter loss of $103 million, contrasted with a profit $11.78 
million a year ago. The results were attributed to a $92.2-million accounting 
writedown of the firm's junk bond portfolio triggered by recent thrift 
legislation. The firm also said it sold more than $850 million in assets during 
the quarter as part of a plan to reduce assets by $2 billion to meet new 
capital requirements.

TURBULENCE IN JUNK BONDS ALTERS PLAN IN TW SERVICES BUYOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Jitters in the junk bond market have forced the investment group that agreed to 
buy TW Services, which owns Denny's coffee shops, to reduce the amount of these 
high-yield, high-risk bonds involved in financing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
New York-based Coniston Partners postponed the sale of $1.1 billion worth of 
junk bonds to be issued as a part of its takeover of TW, which also owns the 
Hardee's and El Pollo Loco fast food chains and a 42% interest in Winchell's 
Donut Houses. 
</P>
<P>
The takeover of TW is one of the latest deals hurt by a turbulent junk bond 
market. In recent months, sellers have had to boost bond yields to attract 
cautious investors. 
</P>
<P>
Paul E. Tierney Jr., one of the principal partners at Coniston, said: "There is 
enough confusion, shall we say, in the bond market that doing a $1.1-billion 
bond financing was going to be ill advised." 
</P>
<P>
Tierney said the $1.1-billion worth of junk bonds would be "substantially 
reduced" and replaced with funds mostly from Coniston and its investment 
banker, Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. 
</P>
<P>
A meeting set for today, in which TW shareholders were to vote on the deal, 
also was postponed. The voting is rescheduled for Nov. 21, when a new offer 
should be ready, Tierney said.

FAULKNER'S SOUND AND FURY -- IN BURBANK; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER: WHAT IF WILLIAM FAULKNER WERE WRITING TV SCREENPLAYS IN A BURBANK FILM 
STUDIO OF TODAY? PETER LEFCOURT'S PLAY EXPLORES JUST THAT PREMISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

"There are two types of people in the world," announced Peter Lefcourt. "You 
either like Hemingway or Faulkner, never both. You either like dogs or cats, 
never both. You either like Bordeaux or Burgundy. You either like France or 
England." 
</P>
<P>
Lefcourt falls into the Faulkner-dogs-Burgundy-France camp -- and he's written 
an affectionate homage to Faulkner, "Only the Dead Know Burbank" (at Sherman 
Oaks' Actors Alley) as proof. 
</P>
<P>
In the contemporary story, thirtyish TV writer Ira Krensky moves into his new 
office on a Burbank lot and meets his office mate: a gray-haired, pipe-smoking 
Southerner, who proclaims himself Bill Faulkner and proceeds to entertain Ira 
with hometown reminiscences of Oxford, Miss., his trip to Stockholm to accept 
the Nobel Prize, and the damned $300-a-week writing contract that Jack Warner 
won't let him out of. 
</P>
<P>
"Faulkner actually spent a lot more time in Hollywood than most people realize 
-- cumulatively almost five years, mostly in the '40s," Lefcourt said. 
"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Warner Bros., RKO. But he was miserable out here for a 
lot of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first place, he never really understood screenwriting. The very 
abilities that make Faulkner a brilliant novelist made him a lousy 
screenwriter. A screenwriter needs condensation; Faulkner is all about 
expansion. But because he was a man of great conscience and honor, he tried 
very hard to satisfy the studio heads." 
</P>
<P>
Faulkner's efforts resulted in only two screen credits: "To Have and Have Not" 
and "The Big Sleep." 
</P>
<P>
"In both cases, almost nothing he wrote reached the screen," said Lefcourt, 47. 
"What Faulkner was out here was a drinking buddy for Howard Hawks, someone for 
him to bounce ideas off of. But he was also a very shy man, so he spent most of 
his time sitting alone and drinking." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Lefcourt said, the pedigree was an attraction. "There was an assumption 
among the studio moguls that they could buy anything. Here was this great 
writer: 'Let's have one of those.' When they brought him out here, his first 
contract was for $1,500 a week. That was very important money in those days." 
</P>
<P>
Lefcourt sighed. "I started thinking about the idea of this great writer coming 
out to Hollywood and getting trapped. To me, that's a symbol of what happens to 
a lot of artists in a system that is not entirely artistic. So the play is 
really about the conflicts between art and commerce, which is what everyone who 
works in Hollywood has to deal with at some point. 
</P>
<P>
"Faulkner never fell into the life style; he was not a man who spent a lot of 
money, bought a big house. He was just someone who tried to make sense of it 
all -- and couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
Lefcourt (whose television writing-producing credits include "Cagney &amp; 
Lacey" and "Scarecrow and Mrs. King") admits that the concept of Faulkner 
puttering around in Burbank in 1989 is a big leap. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a writer's conceit," he said with a nod. "But it's also a dramatic 
contrivance that launches you into an interesting situation. The play is really 
seen through the point of view of Ira Krensky -- a perfectly nice, normal, 
though somewhat cynical and jaded person -- who comes in and finds a writer who 
says he's William Faulkner. At the beginning, the audience and Ira test the 
credibility of that notion." 
</P>
<P>
The writer smiled. "At a certain point, if the play works, the audience begins 
to realize that it doesn't make a difference whether or not it really is 
William Faulkner. Look, we all know that Faulkner is dead; it's in the 
Encyclopaedia Britannica. But the spirit of William Faulkner, what he stands 
for, is still very much alive. And someone like Ira Krensky -- who's battling 
with his ghosts, trying to make sense of 'Am I an artist? Am I a hack?' -- can 
take Faulkner as a message, a symbol for courage." 
</P>
<P>
And, Lefcourt admitted slyly, the tribute to Faulkner enables him to have some 
fun with Hemingway. 
</P>
<P>
"The play does attack him somewhat affectionately," he said. "Hemingway was so 
full of himself, so pompous. In the play, there's a line that everything came 
out of his mouth in capital letters. Yes, he was brilliant. He had a wonderful, 
natural style. But he was just so much The Writer, drinking in bars to prove he 
was a man. 
</P>
<P>
"Faulkner drank by himself. He didn't have to run bulls in Pamplona or hang out 
with literary circles to prove anything. He was more comfortable sitting around 
the courthouse square with the old cronies." 
</P>
<P>
"Burbank" is Lefcourt's second play. He describes the first, "The Carpet" 
(1970), as "a pretty dreadful Jewish melodrama." His last project was a 
satirical book, "The Disraeli Deal," about a producer marketing a movie about 
Benjamin Disraeli starring Eddie Murphy. A magazine short-story writer before 
he migrated from his native New York in 1972, Lefcourt wrote for various 
episodic TV shows before hitting it big as a story editor on "Eight Is Enough." 
</P>
<P>
Both TV and stage work, said Lefcourt, have pluses and minuses. 
</P>
<P>
"TV gobbles up material," he said. "As a writer, you have the positive of 
seeing your work translated to film very quickly. The negative is that it 
usually plays once, then disappears. You watch it alone on TV, in your own 
alienated world, and you don't see how it touches people. Another downside is 
that it's going to be transformed by directors and actors and other writers. 
That's painful for a lot of writers who believe they should have some pride of 
ownership." 
</P>
<P>
He shook his head. "Television is a mass medium -- and you have to accept that. 
You have to accept the fact that there are certain types of things you cannot 
do. I'm not just talking in terms of censorship or dirty words. I know it 
sounds awfully patronizing, but there is a lowest common denominator out there. 
That doesn't mean you should give up to it entirely. Within the system, you 
should always try to do excellent work -- fight it a little bit, stretch it a 
little bit." 
</P>
<P>
The play runs Monday through Wednesday till Nov. 16; admission is free.

TERU SUSHI HAS NO RAW DEALS, JUST FINE FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sushi. Raw fish, right? Not exactly. Strictly speaking, sushi is bite-sized 
packets of lightly vinegared rice with almost anything on top. Teru Sushi, on 
Ventura Boulevard in Studio City -- a favorite haunt of studio personnel -- is 
an excellent place to sample the other sorts of sushi -- as well as the more 
ordinary raw seafood variety. 
</P>
<P>
An outstanding example of cooked sushi is Teru Sushi's No-Name Special. It's a 
thick roll in which avocado, salmon and rice have been wrapped in a sheet of 
seaweed and briefly fried in tempura batter. The result is a crunchy exterior 
surrounding chewy seaweed and a soft, warm interior. California roll, the most 
popular sushi in America, contains avocado and steamed crab and may be ordered 
with rice on the outside of the seaweed wrapper. Customarily at Teru, the chef 
sprinkles sesame seeds on the rice, but if you ask, he will coat it with 
flying-fish roe, tiny granular orange-red fish eggs that add a new dimension to 
this justifiably appreciated invention. 
</P>
<P>
Tiger's Eye consists of avocado, smoky salmon, rice and seaweed in a snow-white 
octopus wrapper. When sliced, each piece looks like a large stylized eye, with 
the avocado as its pupil. Served warm, it is one of the most striking sushi 
offerings. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to sushi, Teru Sushi serves many of the more familiar Japanese 
cooked foods to those at tables (instead of at the sushi counter). These 
include various tempura dishes -- shrimp, vegetable, and so forth -- that are 
rather pedestrian. They lack the crispness and vitality that can make tempura 
so enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
I was also disappointed by a special appetizer, the European-style maguro 
terrine (those at the counter must order this from a waitress). The thick 
slices of tuna loaf studded with carrots and asparagus were uncomfortably dense 
and lacking in flavor. Much to the restaurant's credit, the sushi chef noticed 
that I hadn't eaten much of it and had it taken off the bill. 
</P>
<P>
But another appetizer, kawari-mushi, was a resounding success. Filets of 
steamed salmon and striped bass were mounded beneath thin strips of daikon 
radish and complemented with shiso leaf, a remarkable member of the mint-basil 
family, and ponzu sauce, a soy/citrus/rice vinegar mixture. The texture of the 
daikon, the tang of the shiso and the savoriness of the ponzu were graceful 
complements to the fish. 
</P>
<P>
A number of unusually satisfying items can be ordered from the menu. 
Tempura-fried soft-shelled crab is crunchy and soft at the same time, and 
delicately tasty. 
</P>
<P>
The complex Rainbow Roll is really a California Roll, with crisp asparagus 
replacing the avocado, and the outside rice ornamented with a rainbow of 
maguro, yellow tail and avocado. It was gilding the lily, but enjoyable anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Yellowtail collar is also terrific. This fairly fatty cut of fish is grilled, 
skin and all, and served with ponzu sauce, the ideal complement. 
</P>
<P>
Tamago, a thick, slightly sweet omelet, is deceptively simple-looking, but 
making a good version is so difficult that its preparation is considered the 
test of a sushi chef. Tamago is made of egg and little more, but its 
considerable pleasure lies in its remarkable lightness. In Japan, some patrons 
will walk into a sushi bar, order tamago and then decide whether the sushi bar 
is worth eating in. The tamago at Teru Sushi passes with flying colors. 
</P>
<P>
Shiso maki with ume is another wonderful sushi dish made without fish. It 
combines the tang of shiso leaf with the tart plum taste of ume; cucumber and 
rice act as contrasting neutral vehicles for these two high-visibility flavors. 
</P>
<P>
Shiso maki is one of the most refreshing things I've put in my mouth, but be 
sure to specify that the chef not use too much ume; once, at Teru Sushi, there 
was so much that it was unpleasantly overpowering. Tamago and shiso maki are 
both refreshingly traditional ways to end a sushi meal. 
</P>
<P>
Teru Sushi's setting is particularly inviting. A few steps from your car you 
find yourself in a Japanese mini-garden, and so, even before going inside, you 
seem to be entering a faraway place. The shouted greetings of the sushi chefs 
reinforce this feeling. If you sit at the tables, you can watch the action at 
the sushi bar: the sushi chefs in their theatrical cobalt blue robes imprinted 
with stylized waves, shouting their greetings, preparing and presenting their 
well-designed work, and then shouting their goodbys. 
</P>
<P>
But it's a better show from the handsome sushi bar itself. Watching sushi chefs 
at work is very much part of the sushi experience. 
</P>
<P>
The prices at Teru Sushi range from $3 to $10 per order of sushi or sashimi, 
which may contain from two to eight pieces. The bill can mount up quickly, but 
the quality, execution and service at the sushi bar make Teru Sushi an 
excellent value. 
</P>
<P>
 Teru Sushi, 11940 Ventura Blvd., Studio City. (818) 763-6201. Open for lunch 
Monday to Friday, noon to 2:30 p.m.; for dinner Monday to Thursday, 5:30 to 11 
p.m.; Friday and Saturday, 5:30 to 11:30 p.m.; Sunday, 5 to 10 p.m. Beer and 
wine. Valet parking. All major credit cards accepted.

LEARN TO SPIN YARN FROM THE MASTERS AT THIS FESTIVAL OF JEWISH STORYTELLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
For the past 20 years, Ruthie Buell -- aka Uncle Ruthie -- has been performing 
songs and stories on her KPFK radio show, "Halfway Down the Stairs." She loves 
her job, which gives her the opportunity to tell stories about death, divorce, 
strong women and alternative families. 
</P>
<P>
"I talk about life the way it really is," said Buell, 59. 
</P>
<P>
Although she has a passion for her work, she'll also say with equal zeal: 
"There's a quality in storytelling that makes me sick. It's that saccharin type 
of storytelling, when people speak at 33 1/3 r.p.m. in a 78 r.p.m. world. 
There's a patronization when the voice changes and this invisible wall develops 
between the storyteller and the audience." 
</P>
<P>
Buell will have none of that. 
</P>
<P>
When she, along with four other storytellers from across the country, performs 
Sunday at A Jewish Storytelling Festival at the University of Judaism, the 
storytellers will strive for the real thing -- real laughter, joy, tears and 
intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to make the audience feel like they're sitting in your kitchen over a 
cup of coffee," explained Buell, who also teaches special education at Alfonso 
B. Perez Special Education Center in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's festival also will feature storytellers Rabbi Lynn Gottlieb of 
Albuquerque, N.M.; Joel Ben Izzy of San Francisco; Syd Liebermann of Evanston, 
Ill., and Peninnah Schram of New York City. The program is set to include a 
morning of storytelling performances by the five masters, with a series of 
afternoon workshops afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Workshops will cover adapting literary stories for oral presentation, using 
family history for material, incorporating music and movement, and adapting 
biblical text into storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
Liebermann taught elementary school for 20 years before he turned to 
storytelling seven years ago, now earning a living solely with his storytelling 
skills. He will lead a workshop dealing with the process of turning real-life 
anecdotes into interesting stories. 
</P>
<P>
"There's so much gold in our lives we don't realize," Liebermann said. "We 
gobble our existence and turn to machines for entertainment. Before radio and 
television were around, we entertained one another by talking." 
</P>
<P>
Liebermann, 45, thinks television shows such as "The Cosby Show" and "The 
Wonder Years" succeed because they concentrate on telling good stories. "After 
we watch these shows, we can remember similar incidents in our own lives," he 
said. "We all have those stories. It's just a matter of knowing how to find 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's event is one more example of the increasing interest in storytelling, 
Liebermann said. He pointed to the phenomenal growth of the National Assn. for 
the Preservation and Perpetuation of Storytelling in Jonesboro, Tenn., as proof 
that the oral tradition is thriving. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen years ago, Jimmy Neil Smith, intent on keeping the art form alive, 
started a storytelling festival in Jonesboro. Back then, fewer than 100 people 
attended the event, but it still became an annual tradition. At the 1989 
festival several weeks ago, 5,500 people showed up. 
</P>
<P>
Fran Cammel, the coordinator of The University of Judaism's Jewish Storytelling 
Festival, also sees increased interest in storytelling. A librarian at 
Whittmann Elementary School in Cerritos, Cammel has been instrumental in 
organizing storytelling events over the past three years in the ABC Unified 
School District in Cerritos. This year's festival attendance was 650, up 350 
from last year, Cammel said. 
</P>
<P>
"The schools see it as a tool to improve kids' listening skills, their memories 
and sequencing skills," she said. "When I teach children to tell stories, I see 
a great increase in their self-esteem. They're able to get up in front of a 
group, without being afraid. It gives them more confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Yet another sign of storytelling's popularity: IBM, in association with Good 
Housekeeping Magazine, is sponsoring a storytelling contest titled "Tell Me a 
Story Celebration." Liebermann said 160,000 entry kits will be distributed to 
public elementary schools nationwide to encourage youngsters to practice 
storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
"There's this celebration of American folklore going on all over the place," 
Liebermann said. "Storytelling is a celebration of being alive." 
</P>
<P>
Although Sunday's festival will focus on Jewish storytelling, Buell and 
Liebermann agree that people of any nationality, religion or ethnic background 
can understand and enjoy the stories. "People are people, no matter if they're 
Jews, Italians, blacks or Eskimos," Liebermann said. "As human beings, we all 
go through a similar passage" in life. 
</P>
<P>
Certain elements distinguish Jewish stories, which focus on characters that are 
Jewish in nature, such as a rabbi. Common elements from Jewish culture -- like 
gefilte fish, kosher foods and Hannukah -- often also are mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
Storytellers are dedicated to keeping Judaism alive, Buell said. "When you're 
threatened with extinction, you're more interested in preserving your culture." 
</P>
<P>
Certain themes also are repeatedly found in Jewish stories -- money and wealth, 
love and marriage, oppression and the struggle of the human spirit to 
persevere. 
</P>
<P>
Humor is often a prime component, too. In Buell's solo performance, she plans 
to speak about "tree envy" -- a strictly Jewish phenomenon in which Jews 
develop envious feelings toward their Christian neighbors because they wish 
that they could have Christmas trees, too. In one humorous anecdote, Buell 
relates the story of her Jewish neighbor who insisted on getting her own 
Christmas tree; when a rabbi moved next door, the neighbor had to deal with his 
unorthodox reaction to her desire to practice a Christian tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Buell also has written some Jewish Christmas carols that she will perform. 
</P>
<P>
"To be a success, the storyteller must get the audience involved," Buell 
explained. "When you've really connected on an emotional level and you see 
tears in the eyes of the audience -- that's a storyteller's reward." 
</P>
<P>
A Jewish Storytelling Festival will be from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Sunday at The 
University of Judaism, 15600 Mulholland Drive. Tickets are $50 per person, $25 
for students and senior citizens 65 and older. Registration will be accepted at 
the door. For information, call (213) 476-9777.

WHOLESALER'S FILES SEIZED IN ART FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON and LOUIS SAHAGUN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
Los Angeles police art fraud investigators Thursday searched the home of Larry 
Groeger, one of the West Coast's leading wholesalers of popular prints, and 
discovered records showing that Groeger supplied "fraudulent" artworks to a 
popular chain of galleries raided last month, the chief investigator said. 
</P>
<P>
Detective William Martin said business records seized during the search of 
Groeger's Hollywood home showed that the 39-year-old businessman was the 
distributor of the Marc Chagall and Joan Miro prints confiscated during the 
earlier raid on the Upstairs Gallery chain. 
</P>
<P>
Groeger, who could not be reached for comment Thursday, has not been charged in 
the case. But Martin said he is "under investigation . . . as a source of 
fraudulent graphics." 
</P>
<P>
Martin said police now will be seeking information on other art galleries that 
might have received prints from Groeger. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously Upstairs wasn't his only customer," Martin said. "But the 
investigation is continuing. We're not going to comment on every gallery that 
might have been sold bad prints." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators seized Groeger's business records and 60 graphics attributed to 
Chagall and Miro, according to Martin, the department's art fraud expert. 
Police now hope to discover the art publisher who provided Groeger with the 
suspicious prints, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Groeger's company, Collections: A Fine Art Service, is known as one of the top, 
if not the top, distributors of popular graphics in the Western United States, 
a business that has blossomed in recent years due to the escalating demand for 
decorative art. Groeger runs his highly successful business out of his 
two-story Spanish villa in the Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The search of the Hollyridge Drive address is the latest step in a widening 
probe of Southern California art fraud. Police say that sophisticated forgers 
are making hundreds of millions of dollars from sales of fake prints. 
</P>
<P>
Local and federal investigators confiscated 1,685 prints in last month's raid 
on the popular Upstairs Gallery chain. Prosecutors have filed grand theft 
charges against the former manager of the chain's Beverly Hills branch, Lee 
Sonnier, and another art broker, Frank de Marigny. 
</P>
<P>
In an affidavit recently filed in Los Angeles Superior Court describing the 
search of the Upstairs Gallery, police told of finding dozens of phony Chagalls 
on the walls. Other prints were taken from the chain's warehouse in Huntington 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
An independent appraiser inspected Upstairs' inventory after the raid and 
removed any remaining works deemed to be suspicious, according to E. Timony 
Applegate, Upstairs Gallery's general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Upstairs purchased "most" of its supposed Chagalls and Miros from Groeger, but 
had no reason to suspect the works were fakes until police said so, Applegate 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Local and federal authorities are conducting a major investigation of art fraud 
in the Southland. Last month, they seized 1,685 allegedly fraudulent copies of 
prints by such popular artists as Marc Chagall and Salvador Dali from the 
Upstairs Gallery, an eight-store chain based in Huntington Beach. Investigators 
said they hope eventually to find the source of the phony art, which is said to 
be making its way to more and more galleries in what has become a 
multimillion-dollar fraud.

STRICKEN AIRCRAFT PLUNGES INTO 2 HOUSES; NO ONE SERIOUSLY HURT 
</P>

A experimental, single-engine, kit-built airplane lost power over West Los 
Angeles late Thursday afternoon and slammed into two houses, setting off a 
spectacular fire in one and heavily damaging a van parked in front of another, 
authorities said. No one was seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, a man in his 30s, walked away uninjured from the crash in the 2900 
block of South Greenfield Avenue, police said. A passenger suffered minor 
injuries and was taken to UCLA Medical Center, officers said. Neither was 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
No one on the ground was injured, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The airplane struck the roof of a two-story residence just before 5:30 p.m., 
skipped over a one-story house next door and then slammed into a third house, 
setting it on fire. The flames destroyed the home, but the emotionally shaken 
occupant was unhurt, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A plume of smoke rising from the scene caused rush-hour traffic to slow on the 
nearby San Diego and Santa Monica freeways. 
</P>
<P>
As the plane broke apart, pieces landed on a van parked in a front yard on 
South Greenfield. 
</P>
<P>
A Federal Aviation Administration official said the plane was on approach to 
Santa Monica Municipal Airport when the pilot reported an engine problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw a plane coming in that had its engine off, and I was thinking that that 
plane was in trouble," said Richard Rohaly, a general contractor and pilot who 
was sitting on his front porch in the neighborhood watching planes on approach 
and listening to conversations between pilots and the control tower on a radio 
scanner. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly, I heard a voice say on the scanner, 'I'm going to try to set it down 
on the road,' " Rohaly said. "He began circling as he went over the 10 (Santa 
Monica) Freeway at an altitude of less than 100 feet. He crashed a block and a 
half south of the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Rae was downstairs and his father, Bill, was taking a shower on the 
second floor when the plane hit their home, the first house it struck. 
</P>
<P>
"The house shook so hard," he said. "I didn't think it was an earthquake, but I 
thought maybe my dad didn't build the house strong enough and that he was 
coming through the floor." 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft spilled its fuel on a house two doors away, setting it ablaze. Los 
Angeles Fire Department Battalion Chief Larry Schneider said Sunny Cohen, the 
home's owner, was inside when "the roof began to cave in, so she got up and 
left." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Harris, whose van was destroyed, said she had just put a first-aid kit in 
the vehicle on Wednesday "because it was going to be my earthquake cabin. And 
right now it's got an airplane wing sitting on it." 
</P>
<P>
Werner Czekalla, a resident on the same block, said he looked out his window 
and saw that the roof on Cohen's house across the street "just blew up." He 
said the explosion sounded like the air raids in Europe he survived as a child 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Czekalla said he wants to see the airport closed "to prevent stuff like this 
from happening." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Worden, a pilot and spokesman for the Santa Monica Airport Assn., said 
there are "some people who don't think the Santa Monica Airport should exist." 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, it's a community asset," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The association is a 1,500-member group of pilots and users of the airport. 
</P>
<P>
The plane was carrying copies of an April, 1989, cover story from Sport 
Aviation magazine that featured a picture of the aircraft flying over Puget 
Sound in Washington state. The article described the craft as the prototype for 
the newly developed Wheeler Express, which is designed for home construction 
and sold in kits. 
</P>
<P>
The gas tanks are hollowed into the wing. When the plane hit the two-story 
house, the wing probably cracked loose and sprayed fuel over the house that 
subsequently burned down, said Worden, who was at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The low-wing monoplane reportedly can be built for between $35,000 and $40,000 
and was apparently being demonstrated to prospective buyers Thursday, several 
pilots said. "Experimental" is the category in which hand-built aircraft are 
certified as airworthy by the FAA.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEPUTY D.A. HELD FOR ALLEGED DRUG 
POSSESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A veteran Los Angeles County deputy district attorney faces cocaine possession 
charges after his arrest by colleagues outside a Van Nuys restaurant earlier 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Jack White, chief of investigations for the district attorney's office, would 
not reveal how much cocaine prosecutor Simon R. Hiller allegedly had, but he 
said "it does not qualify for a sale case." 
</P>
<P>
Hiller, 45, an Encino resident who has prosecuted defendants on charges ranging 
from murder to bank fraud during his 15-year career, was placed on 
administrative leave Wednesday after the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"I really can't give you any comment," Hiller said. 
</P>
<P>
District attorney's investigators took up the case after an employee went to 
White with the allegation that Hiller, who worked for both the Santa Monica and 
Van Nuys offices, was involved with drugs.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SLAIN WOMAN'S BODY FOUND IN GRIFFITH PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The body of a Los Angeles woman was found dumped beside a curb early Thursday 
in Griffith Park less than an hour after the woman was hit on the head and 
killed, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
A man driving home from work alerted park rangers when he spotted the 
38-year-old woman's nude body about 4:30 a.m. on Zoo Drive east of Victory 
Boulevard, Detective Sam Jacobellis said. Authorities declined to identify the 
woman until next of kin were notified. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators, who have not established a motive or list of suspects, said they 
believe the woman died about 4 a.m. of a blow to the head. 
</P>
<P>
Police identified the woman through fingerprints.

GODDESS GIVEN PANEL'S OK TO RISE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
She's back. Well, almost. 
</P>
<P>
Creators of the tenacious "Goddess of Democracy" replica in Los Angeles 
received backing Thursday from the city Cultural Affairs Commission to 
resurrect the 23-foot-high statue near City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
If final approval is given by the General Services Department, the city will 
see a return of the itinerant statue, one of many copies inspired by the 
goddess statue that was toppled during pro-democracy demonstrations in 
Beijing's Tian An Men Square in June. The local version was hastily erected 
last June atop a Civic Center footbridge, moved to Chinatown and eventually 
demolished by vandals. 
</P>
<P>
The battered pieces of the stately symbol were collected by Santa Monica 
sculptor Tom Van Sant, creator of the replica and who was largely responsible 
for the effort to revive the statue. 
</P>
<P>
Van Sant, other artists and Chinatown representatives presented the commission 
with a proposal to install a fortified version of the three-quarter-ton 
wood-and-plastic statue in an unused flower planter to the north of City Hall 
East, near the intersection of Temple and Main streets. 
</P>
<P>
After listening to Van Sant's presentation, commission members unanimously 
agreed to recommend the proposal to General Services, which is ultimately 
responsible for granting permission for the monument to go up. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased with the site and the terms," Van Sant said outside City Hall 
on Thursday after meeting with the commission. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's recommendation stipulated that the artists and supporters 
cover the cost associated with erecting the statue. Van Sant said the tab for 
materials and for installing, lighting, insuring and -- after 18 months -- 
removing the statue will come to about $2,500, though many of the services are 
being donated. 
</P>
<P>
The statue will be "on loan" to the city for 18 months, while a Goddess of 
Democracy Statue Fund Committee attempts to raise $250,000 to create a solid 
marble replica of the Goddess, Van Sant said. 
</P>
<P>
If the marble version is made, he said, it will be offered to the Chinese 
people and government as a replacement for the original Tian An Men statue. 
</P>
<P>
"With the distinct possibility that the statue is not welcomed by the Chinese 
government, we are asking the city to hold it on loan, until the gift is 
accepted," Van Sant said. 
</P>
<P>
The replica has had a rocky history in Los Angeles. In June, it was erected on 
a Civic Center pedestrian footbridge without permission, then moved to 
Chinatown, where vandals unceremoniously brought it down, decapitated it and 
left the remains to be carted away by Van Sant and friends. 
</P>
<P>
The sculptor has since pieced the work back together, adding wood 
reinforcements to the frame, and is in the process of putting a hard, white 
polyurethane and plaster surface on it "so it will be able to withstand minor 
attacks," he said. Van Sant said applying the coating will take about a week. 
Then the statue will be ready to go up, subject to final city approval. 
</P>
<P>
Van Sant said he will make an appointment to pursue the final approval after 
the commission notifies the General Services Department of its recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Van Sant said he already is planning the installation ceremony.

GIVE 'INDEPENDENT VERDICT,' MCMARTIN LAWYER ASKS JURORS; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: IN HIS FINAL ARGUMENT IN A LENGTHY CASE, A DEFENSE ATTORNEY WARNS OF 
'MEDICAL EVIDENCE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN FABRICATED.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six years since the first arrest in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case, 
the defense spoke for the last time in court Thursday, asking the jury to "keep 
your health and keep your head and keep on the case -- and please give both 
sides your fair, objective and independent verdict." 
</P>
<P>
Forcefully winding up 5 1/2 days of final arguments, lawyer Danny Davis, who 
represents defendant Ray Buckey, attacked the integrity of the prosecution for 
its use of a jailhouse informant and for allegedly shaping children's 
testimony. He characterized the case as based on "insinuendos" and "unreliable 
medical evidence that may have been fabricated." 
</P>
<P>
"If we find that it was (symptoms of) diarrhea (rather than molestation) and 
Manhattan Beach went berserk," triggering the longest and costliest criminal 
case in world history, he said, then "the horror that this case is a sham is 
absolutely numbing." 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer was referring to the 2 1/2-year-old boy whose mother, now dead, made 
the first complaint against "Mr. Ray" in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Manhattan Beach police sent parents a form letter about the 
investigation that created hysteria, resulting in charges being filed against 
the founder and six other teachers at the family owned nursery school and the 
closure of nine area preschools. 
</P>
<P>
Davis argued that the prosecution had failed to prove "beyond a reasonable 
doubt" that the alleged crimes occurred or, if they did, that they were 
committed by his client and they fell within the six-year period covered by the 
statute of limitations. 
</P>
<P>
He urged the eight-man, four-woman jury to give Buckey "the benefit of the 
doubt." 
</P>
<P>
Buckey, now 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62, are charged with 65 
counts of molestation and conspiracy involving 11 children, nine of whom 
testified against them. 
</P>
<P>
Charges against the other five defendants were dropped by the district 
attorney's office for insufficient evidence, despite a preliminary hearing 
judge's finding that all should stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
After one day of final arguments by lawyer Dean Gits, who represents Peggy 
McMartin Buckey, Davis used the remaining 5 1/2 days allotted to the defense by 
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders in an attempt to refute the 
allegations, examining the evidence child by child and count by count. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said the allegations are "defined, impossible, unreal occurrences" that 
for the most part would have had to happen either when his client was not at 
the seaside nursery school or with the knowledge of the other teachers, all of 
whom testified that they observed nothing even remotely suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
The defense lawyer said the "lovely, rehearsed" children appeared to have 
memorized their testimony after suggestive interviews by therapists and 
coaching by the prosecution. And he told the panel if they believe the 
witnesses' accounts of molestation they will also have to accept their bizarre 
tales of abuse in a carwash and grocery, and of animal mutilation and 
satanic-like rituals. 
</P>
<P>
"You can still love children and want to believe them, but you cannot rely on 
their testimony," he contended. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Davis warned jurors not to get caught up in the present-day 
"children's movement" by making his client "a scapegoat." He compared the 
McMartin case to the Salem witch trials and the McCarthy hearings, both of 
which punished innocent people. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Lael Rubin will have the last word. The prosecution has 
saved 3 1/2 days of its allotted time for her closing arguments, beginning 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The case will go to the jury next week.

KING MEDICAL CENTER PHYSICIANS CALL REPORTS OF PROBLEMS GREATLY DISTORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SPIEGEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two physicians at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center charged at a press 
conference Thursday that patient care problems have been greatly distorted and 
that the county supervisors are to blame for "deliberate under-funding" of the 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Lorenzo Brown, a part-time doctor at King and a member of an ad hoc 
committee of the Charles R. Drew Medical Society, charged that funding for the 
medical center today is "at the same level as in 1981." 
</P>
<P>
This, however, was denied in an interview with Virginia Collins, a division 
chief in the county's office of the chief administrator who said her budget 
analysis has shown all county hospitals, including King, have received "steady 
increases." 
</P>
<P>
Brown further charged that King's trauma patient load in the last 18 months "is 
greater than the total for the past 12 years." That was also disputed by county 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Price Hastings, who is in charge of pre-hospital care at the county 
Department of Health Services, acknowledged in an interview that King has 
struggled to cope with an increasing trauma load but characterized Brown's 
assertion as defying common sense. In fact, she said her records show that 
King's trauma load during the first six months of 1989 is down significantly 
from last year. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal health authorities on Sept. 12 cited the hospital for scores 
of major patient care deficiencies in the areas of nursing, dietary care, 
infection control, quality assurance, physical plant and administration. County 
health officials have acknowledged problems at King and pledged to correct them 
by Dec. 21 in order to avoid a threatened shut-off of about $60 million in 
public health-care funding. 
</P>
<P>
The Charles R. Drew Medical Society is a group of physicians who support or 
work at King. They include Dr. Arthur Fleming, King's chief of trauma and 
surgery, who attended the press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Fleming renewed an earlier attack on The Times, circulating again a lengthy 
critique of cases cited in a series of articles about King published earlier in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
He charged that the articles presented a "distorted, misleading, 
misrepresented, exaggerated view when, in actuality, we have struggled 
valiantly to treat an unusual case mix and an overwhelming number of patients 
with inadequate resources." 
</P>
<P>
In the articles, The Times detailed what county supervisors summed up as "poor 
administration, a lack of highly skilled medical staff and a severe shortage of 
space, staff and funding to adequately deal with the hospital's increasing 
patient load." 
</P>
<P>
The articles were the result of a months-long investigation that included 
interviews with dozens of health-care professionals and a review of hundreds of 
pages of documents on patient care at the hospital. The Times series reported 
higher death rates at King than at the county's other acute care hospitals and 
cited a federal analysis of Medicare death rates that ranked King in the bottom 
50 of 5,577 hospitals nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints about patient care and inadequate resources at King were voiced by 
numerous doctors and other medical staff at the hospital. Dozens of individual 
cases of patient care were reviewed, and The Times asked outside medical 
experts to analyze 12 of them. 
</P>
<P>
But at the Burbank press conference Thursday, Brown called the articles 
"irresponsible journalism" based on "distorted accounts of specific cases." 
</P>
<P>
All cases cited by The Times were reviewed by outside medical experts, who 
concluded that the cases were egregious examples of bad medicine, suggesting 
serious malfunctioning at King. The Board of Medical Quality Assurance is 
investigating these cases, which included instances in which patients lingered 
and died for lack of timely surgery.

ZSA ZSA 'DOESN'T FOOL AROUND': SHE'LL APPEAL, SERVE JAIL TIME TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zsa Zsa Gabor, still righteously defending her innocence, plans to appeal her 
cop-slapping conviction but will serve her three-day jail sentence and perform 
120 hours of community service anyway just to prove a point, her husband said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to appeal," Prince Frederick von Anhalt, Gabor's eighth husband, 
said in an interview two days after the actress was sentenced at Beverly Hills 
Municipal Court. "But . . . she's also going to serve three days in jail just 
to show the public that she doesn't fool around with anything. 
</P>
<P>
"She really would love to go to jail, you know, to see what's going on -- if 
people get treated well in jail. She wants to know how people live in jail, how 
the food is and everything. She wants to have that experience." 
</P>
<P>
Gabor, who has not publicly discussed her legal plans, left early Thursday for 
New York to appear on the "Phil Donahue Show," Von Anhalt said. But before 
departing, the nearly 70-year-old actress talked about the jail sentence with 
her husband and made it clear she will go behind bars no matter what and will 
expect no special treatment once that steel door clangs shut, Von Anhalt added. 
</P>
<P>
"She wants the (jail) uniforms. She wants everything," he said. "She doesn't 
want special food. She wants the food they get in prison. If she gets specially 
treated, she doesn't get (a realistic) experience." 
</P>
<P>
As part of her sentence for slapping Beverly Hills motorcycle Officer Paul 
Kramer on June 14, Gabor was ordered to pay $12,937 in fines and restitution, 
to perform community service at a Los Angeles-area center for homeless women 
and to undergo psychiatric evaluation. Her three-day jail term can be served at 
the city or county jail of her choice before the end of the year, Municipal 
Judge Charles G. Rubin ordered. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor, who regularly does charity work, is eager to perform the community 
service duties, Von Anhalt said. Although she has yet to decide where or when 
she will enter jail, she probably will serve the time soon, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the actress will file an appeal in hopes of clearing her name and 
avoiding the fines, her husband said. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor spent the day after her sentencing taping an interview for the television 
show "A Current Affair," in which she called for an apology from the judge and 
"all of Beverly Hills." During a brief break in the filming, she also referred 
to herself -- again -- as a symbol for battered women everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to fight as long as I live for that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor expressed particular outrage at Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, who asked for a 
30-day jail sentence. A week after her arrest, Gabor said, she sat with Reiner 
at a dinner party and showed him the bruises inflicted by Kramer's handcuffs. 
Reiner told her not to worry about the arrest, that it was nothing, according 
to Gabor. 
</P>
<P>
Von Anhalt said he overhead part of the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Sweetheart' -- and that's exactly what he said -- 'Sweetheart, don't 
worry, we'll take care of that,' " Von Anhalt recalled, quoting Reiner. " 'If 
that policeman did that to you, he's going to get punished.' 
</P>
<P>
"Then we stood up after dinner, and he . . . said, 'Ms. Gabor, could you do me 
one big favor? I would love to have a photograph with you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Reiner, considered a likely candidate for state attorney general, acknowledged 
sitting with Gabor at the party, thrown at the Beverly Hills home of developer 
Stanley Black, but denied talking with her about the arrest or the pending 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no discussion whatsoever," he said. "Not a syllable . . . about the 
trial, about the troubles, about anything in the world." 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Tuesday, Reiner predicted that Gabor would use her 
celebrity status to make a farce of her community service work, playing "Marie 
Antoinette to these homeless women." 
</P>
<P>
Gabor responded: "He should know that Marie Antoinette also gets cake for the 
people. He is a bigmouthed man who doesn't do his homework. . . . Marie 
Antoinette said, 'Let the people eat cake.' He (Reiner) should give the 
homeless cake."

AVOIDING FREEWAYS IS NO RX FOR ROADWAY GUN ASSAULTS, STUDY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It may not be such a smart idea after all to steer clear of freeways in hopes 
of not being shot by a congestion-addled driver, according to the results of an 
investigation into the spate of Los Angeles freeway shootings in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control found that most of the 
roadway gun assaults that occurred between June and August, 1987, took place on 
surface streets, not freeways -- a fact they say challenges the wisdom of 
altering one's commuting patterns to avoid being shot. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite the fact that the proportion of all roadway assaults is increasing on 
freeways, the public's perception that such assaults can be avoided by staying 
off the freeways appears to be unfounded," they wrote last week in the Journal 
of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The group analyzed the highly publicized rash of gun incidents for any 
underlying patterns: Who tended to be involved? Was the rate really higher than 
in the past? Was there any link between the assaults and traffic jams? 
</P>
<P>
Their findings include: 
</P>
<P>
* State, county and Los Angeles law enforcement authorities received 137 
reports of roadway firearm assaults between June 18 and Aug. 31. Thirty-nine 
percent were brandishings and 61% were shootings. Twenty percent of the 
shootings resulted in injuries. Two were fatal. 
</P>
<P>
* The assaults occurred on all types of roadways: 63% on surface streets, 36% 
on freeways and less than 1% on highways. More than a third of the victims 
reported having had some sort of contretemps with the suspect over such things 
as tailgating, merging and lane-changing. 
</P>
<P>
* The apparent increase in roadway gun assaults that summer was in fact real: 
There were just 32 during a comparable period in 1985 and 91 in 1986. So-called 
freeway-only firearm assaults were four in 1985, 15 in 1986 and 49 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
* There appeared to be some connection between freeway congestion and assaults: 
The most heavily traveled freeways had the highest assault rate. However, more 
than two-thirds of the assaults occurred outside rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite the enormous national and local concern about these incidents, the 
number of injuries and deaths from roadway firearm assaults was relatively 
small," the researchers observed. "Because more than 1,000 homicides and 40,000 
aggravated assaults are committed in Los Angeles County each year, roadway 
assaults do not constitute a large proportion of the problem of interpersonal 
violence."

KOREAN WAR SHRINE FOR SAN PEDRO LAGGING; 
</P>
<P>
MEMORIAL: A VETERANS' GROUP SAYS RED TAPE AND A COMPETING NATIONAL EFFORT HAVE 
PUSHED PLANS AT LEAST A YEAR BEHIND SCHEDULE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Four months after they achieved a compromise with Los Angeles officials, a 
group of Korean War veterans say their plans to build a monument in a city park 
in San Pedro are at least a year behind schedule and that fund raising is 
lagging as well. 
</P>
<P>
To compound the veterans' problems, the backers of a congressionally approved 
national Korean War memorial -- to be built on the Mall in Washington -- have 
made a fund-raising push in Los Angeles, raising $25,000 at a cocktail party in 
Koreatown last month. 
</P>
<P>
The party, billed as a "Commemoration of the Victory in Seoul," honored the 
chairman of the Washington memorial committee, retired U.S. Army Gen. Richard 
G. Stilwell, who also came to Los Angeles in August to promote the national 
memorial effort, especially among Korean-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The Stilwell fete enjoyed broad support in the Los Angeles Korean community. 
Its invitation listed backers including more than 80 community leaders -- from 
pastors to businessmen to an Olympic gold medalist -- and more than 30 Korean 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the backers of the San Pedro memorial have not conducted any 
fund-raisers in Koreatown and have tied themselves to one Korean group, the 
Korean Veterans Assn. They say they have been so caught up in trying to meet 
city requirements for approval of the project that there has been little time 
to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult," said Jack Stites, executive director of the committee backing 
the San Pedro monument. "The national monument, they have their location; the 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is doing all their engineering. The only thing 
they have to spend any time on is fund raising. That's a pretty nice position 
to be in." 
</P>
<P>
The $4-million San Pedro memorial is a private effort, proposed by the Chosin 
Few, a nationwide organization consisting mostly of Marine Corps veterans whose 
members survived the battle of the Chosin Reservoir. Their monument is intended 
to honor veterans from all 22 nations that joined in the U.N. effort in Korea. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington memorial, which will honor U.S. veterans, will depict 38 
combat-equipped soldiers walking in double-file toward an American flag. It 
will be set in Ash Woods, a grove of trees across the reflecting pool from the 
Vietnam Veterans Memorial. So far, $4 million of the necessary $7.5 million has 
been raised for the national memorial, according to Ed Borcherdt, a California 
fund-raiser for the project. 
</P>
<P>
Stites said his group, in contrast, has raised $1 million in cash and pledges, 
although he would not give a breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
The San Pedro memorial is to be built at Angels Gate Park, which is on a bluff 
at the southern tip of Los Angeles, overlooking the Pacific Ocean and Los 
Angeles Harbor. The park, which was once a military base, already houses the 
Korean Friendship Bell, a gift to Los Angeles from the South Korean government. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the veterans sought to erect their monument next to the bell -- a 
site that Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley offered them in 1986. But San Pedro 
residents complained that the centerpiece of the monument -- a sculpture that 
depicts a larger-than-life-size battle scene -- would destroy the bell's 
peaceful setting. 
</P>
<P>
After a protracted series of hearings, the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs 
Commission -- the first of four city and state agencies that must approve the 
monument -- sided with the residents, but gave the veterans preliminary 
approval to build the monument elsewhere in the park. 
</P>
<P>
The switch in sites has sent the veterans, who had spent more than $70,000 on 
engineering studies, back to "ground zero," Stites said.

QINTEX IS SOLVENT, CHAIRMAN CONTENDS

Australian television magnate Christopher C. Skase, under pressure from banks 
and regulators after the failure of his takeover bid for Hollywood's MGM/UA 
studio, declared that his Qintex Australia company is still solvent. 
</P>
<P>
Skase, Qintex chairman, has spent much of the past two days huddled with his 
bankers after announcing that the company had run into a $150-million ($200 
million Australian) drop in cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
The flamboyant Skase, who until this week was regarded as one of Australia's 
richestpeople, found that his aborted $1.5-billion takeover bid for the studio 
left him strapped for cash. 
</P>
<P>
Shares of Qintex Australia and those of its 53% owner, Qintex Ltd., have been 
suspended from trading on the Australian Stock Exchange since Monday amid 
concern about their U.S. associate's application for bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement Thursday in response to stock exchange queries about his 
finances, Skase said Qintex Australia could meet its financial commitments with 
the continued support of its lenders, who had been presented with its business 
plan for the financial year. 
</P>
<P>
"The group's bankers are reviewing the information presented," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Skase stuck by his forecast, made earlier this week, that Qintex Australia's 
profit before interest, tax and depreciation for the year to July 31, would top 
$128 million ($170 million Australian) despite the reduced cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
But he said the results were not yet final and had not been approved by 
directors and auditors. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex Australia's crisis was triggered by its 43%-owned Qintex Entertainment 
Inc., which filed for protection from creditors over a $5.9-million loan last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Skase said Qintex Australia had made unsecured loans of almost $38 million ($50 
million Australian) to Qintex Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex Entertainment's $35 million in bank loans was secured on its assets, 
supported by a Qintex Australia guarantee, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Skase has already announced plans to sell assets to help solve Qintex 
Australia's debt problems.

JANET JACKSON HOLDS ON TO TOP SPOT

Janet Jackson, No. 1 on the Billboard pop album chart for the second straight 
week with "Rhythm Nation 1814," is probably secure in the top spot for another 
week or two. Rappers on the rise: Young M. C.'s "Stone Cold Rhymin" (No. 13) 
and Ice-T's "The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech . . ."(No. 40). Bad English's 
pop-rock album, "Bad English" -- No. 29 -- started slowly but has been rising 
rapidly in the last few weeks thanks to a Top Five pop single, "When I See You 
Smile" (No. 5). Tracy Chapman's "Crossroads" is the hottest new album on the 
chart, reaching No. 10 in just three weeks. She did it the hard way, without a 
hit single. Roxette's "Listen to Your Heart" is the new No. 1 pop single. 
</P>
<P>
* Billy Joel's "Storm Front" stormed up to No. 47 in its first week on the 
chart. His single, "Didn't We Start the Fire" -- No. 21 on the pop singles 
chart -- is boosting album sales. The single has a good chance of making the 
Top Five.

WGA EXPRESSES 'CONCERN' IN AGENCY-WRITER FLAP; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: GUILD SAYS THAT ALLEGED THREATS AGAINST WRITERS WOULD VIOLATE ITS 
'BASIC AGREEMENT.' CREATIVE ARTISTS AGENCY HAS DENIED CHARGE BROUGHT BY WRITER 
JOE ESZTERHAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
One week after a screenwriter's allegations against Creative Artists Agency 
President Michael Ovitz surfaced in the press, the Writers Guild of America, 
West has issued a cautiously worded statement saying that it "views with grave 
concern threats of interference with a writer's career opportunities from any 
quarter, including agents and/or employees." 
</P>
<P>
The statement, released Thursday, came in response to a four-page letter in 
which screenwriter Joe Eszterhas alleged that Ovitz threatened his career after 
he announced plans to leave CAA to join his longtime friend, Guy McElwaine, at 
rival International Creative Management. Eszterhas, one of the industry's 
highest-paid screenwriters, has authored such hit films as "Flashdance" and 
"Jagged Edge." 
</P>
<P>
After news of the letter appeared in the press, the writers guild's electronic 
bulletin board -- which enables members to "talk" to each other through their 
computers -- lit up with messages urging the guild to take action in support of 
Eszterhas. 
</P>
<P>
"If any of us has been attacked, we have to see this as an attack on all," one 
guild member wrote. "We can't let a writer's success or lack of success isolate 
a member from whatever strength this organization can muster . . . Joe E. may 
not need the guild to fight for him but the guild needs to stand with him." 
</P>
<P>
"That took guts," another guild member wrote, "I absolutely agree that the WGA 
should back him 100%. How many of our rules for agents does this break?" 
</P>
<P>
"Assuming the letter is the genuine thing, which seems more than likely," came 
another response, "I would like to extend to the brave Joe Eszterhas my support 
and approval of what he's doing here in two ways: Maybe a message from his 
brothers and sisters, and maybe a strong message to our BOD (board of 
directors) . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the guild -- which represents 7,500 TV writers and screenwriters -- 
met with CAA officials "to express and discuss its position and to seek a 
resolution of the matter," according to the statement. "Furthermore, the WGA 
has made inquiries of CAA and Mr. Eszterhas and sought certain 
acknowledgements, assurances and representations." 
</P>
<P>
The statement released by the guild was approved by both CAA and Eszterhas. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the position of the WGA that were such threats to issue from an agent, 
and/or were such threats to be carried out, directly or indirectly, there would 
be a serious breach of the (guild's) Basic Agreement (which serves as a legal 
contract between talent agents and guild members)," the union said in its 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
CAA, said the guild statement, "acknowledged that any threats to a client of 
interference with his or her career opportunities and actions undertaken to 
carry out such threats would be a serious breach of the Basic Agreement." CAA 
also assured the guild that "it does not condone the use of threats for the 
purpose of inhibiting a client from exercising a legal right to terminate or 
change representation." 
</P>
<P>
Eszterhas' letter reconstructs purported portions of conversations Eszterhas 
had with Ovitz and an underling, agent Rand Holston, in late September after 
the writer told Ovitz he was leaving CAA to join McElwaine, one of his oldest 
friends in the business. 
</P>
<P>
According to Eszterhas' letter, Holston warned the screenwriter that Ovitz 
would go out of his way to damage his reputation with studio executives and 
that CAA would withhold its stars and directors from his projects. "Mike's 
going to put you into the . . . ground," Holston is quoted as saying in the 
Eszterhas letter. 
</P>
<P>
Both Holston and Ovitz have declined comment on the letter. But the agency 
issued a statement last week denying Eszterhas' version of events, and released 
a letter from Ovitz to Eszterhas in which the CAA president said his 
"recollection of our conversation bore no relationship to your recollection. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to make it eminently clear that in no way will I, Rand or anyone else 
in this agency, stand in the way of your pursuing your career," Ovitz added in 
his letter. "So please, erase from your mind any of your erroneous anxieties or 
thoughts you may have to the contrary."

</P>

Much folk art has its roots in religious and family traditions celebrated by 
members of the artist's community. One of the predominant folk-art traditions 
is Day of the Dead, Dia de Los Muertos, a Nov. 2 Mexican celebration in which 
the family is reunited as the dead return to visit the living. As part of the 
celebrations, deceased relatives are represented in the form of calaveras, 
smiling skeleton figures.

FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
Art Exhibition -- M. H. Smith's exhibition, "Day of the Dead Alter," was 
incorrectly titled "Day of the Dead Altar" in a listing of local events 
celebrating the Mexican tradition in Friday's Calendar. The exhibition, through 
Nov. 12 at USC Atelier in the Santa Monica Place shopping mall, is concerned 
with "change and continuity in Western art traditions," according to the 
artist.

As New York designers prepare for opening day of the spring ready-to-wear shows 
on Monday, three names stand out. Charlotte Neuville has replaced the late 
Perry Ellis as the darling of the yuppie set for playful sportswear with 
pop-Pilgrim overtones. Christian Francis Roth is causing waves with his 
couture-quality collections -- quite an accomplishment for a 20-year-old 
designer. His fashions are filled with wit and whimsy. Then, there is Carolyne 
Roehm, fashion maker, social gadfly and wife of New York financier Henry 
Kravis, with whom she shares a Fifth Avenue apartment. Her private life 
inspires her glamorous collections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Designer: Charlotte Neuville 
</P>
<P>
The Clothes: "Twisted classics" in unexpected fabric combinations, such as a 
lace car coat over a metallic skirt and tailored lace-trimmed white shirt. I. 
Magnin and ModaSport carry her label. 
</P>
<P>
Where She's Been: Raised in Sausolito, Calif., and apprenticed under the late 
Perry Ellis, Neuville launched her label after teaming up with Ken Merlo, both 
in business and in life. The partners are married and expecting their first 
child. 
</P>
<P>
Where She's Going: After three years in business, 38-year-old Neuville has been 
profiled in Vogue and seen her name on Womens Wear Daily's "new suspects" list. 
The "old suspects" are household names like Calvin, Bill and Ralph. She expects 
business to top the $7-million mark this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Designer: Christian Francis Roth 
</P>
<P>
The Clothes: The "school girl" dress for spring has a school of fish appliqued 
on it to wear with a fishnet shawl. Roth's fall collection, his first, featured 
the elevator jacket with buttons numbered to look like elevator buttons, 
including one marked "L" for lobby. Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman are 
among stores that carry his label. 
</P>
<P>
Where He's Been: New York-born Roth apprenticed with designer Koos van den 
Akker for more than three years after graduation from Fashion Institute of 
Technology and Parsons School of Design. Despite his youth, he's been in the 
business for six years. 
</P>
<P>
Where He's Going: New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art will include him with 
Ralph Lauren and Isaac Mizrahi in a fashion show this fall. Cover Girl 
Cosmetics wants him to design three fashion looks to help launch the company's 
new fragrance. And New York's influential Fashion Group has tagged him a 
designer to watch. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Designer: Carolyne Roehm 
</P>
<P>
The Clothes: Flesh-toned ensembles for day and evening, some with exposed 
midriffs, many in sheer chiffon or organza. Billowing caftans by night. Neiman 
Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue carry her collection. 
</P>
<P>
Where She's Been: Born in Kirskville, Mo., and bred on 7th Avenue (in the 
workrooms of her mentor, Oscar de la Renta), Roehm, age 38, launched her own 
business four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Where She's Going: Since her financier husband became her company's backer, 
Roehm (pronounced Rome) has opened an office at 550 7th Ave., fashion's most 
prestigious address, where her neighbors are Blass, Beene, Lauren and de la 
Renta. She is president of the powerful Council of Fashion Designers of 
America. She studies dressage, piano and French, and wants to learn Italian.

SPRING SHOWS IN PARIS END WITH THAT COME-HITHER LOOK; 
</P>
<P>
DESIGNERS: STEAMY READY-TO-WEAR DESIGNS FROM YVES SAINT LAURENT FEATURE FLOWER 
POWER AND SEXY CHIC, WHILE EMMANUEL UNGARO OFFERS A MORE UNDERSTATED VIEW.

<P>
Yves Saint Laurent gave the final show of this season's ready-to-wear 
collections Wednesday, throwing caution to the wind. The king of chic brought 
out some of the sexiest clothes in all of Paris. When he took his bow, he was 
surrounded by models wearing a steamy assortment of slit-to-the-thigh skirts, 
bosom-revealing bodices and flirtatious, flower print dresses that left no 
doubt: sexy style is in at YSL. 
</P>
<P>
The show opened with safari dresses and suits that featured lace-up miniskirts 
and bush jackets, worn with thigh-high satin boots and towering turbans. From 
there it veered toward dressier styles at once elegant and seductive. 
</P>
<P>
The come-hither message was clear in Saint Laurent's toga dress that completely 
bared one breast. Even trouser suits had surprisingly low-cut jackets that 
bared more of the bosom than the shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
A fitted, flower-print pique jacket with a sweetheart neckline topped wide, 
cropped pants for a snappy look. There was more flower power in the big, red 
poppies on the bodices and skirts of Saint Laurent's shorts suits. 
</P>
<P>
A group of dark-toned silk and linen suits with mother-of-pearl buttons on the 
sleeves had long, tulip-shaped jackets and asymmetric, wrap skirts that offered 
quite a leg show. Other leggy looks were the polka-dot flamenco dresses with 
flounced skirts, cut short in front but dipped longer in back. 
</P>
<P>
For torso emphasis, Saint Laurent wrapped the waist in tight taffeta draping 
and put a shocking-pink leather bolero above it, and a lean, violet leather 
skirt below. He showed belted tunics over skirts for subtler effects. 
</P>
<P>
His new dinner suit is a black crepe and satin harem tuxedo, with bare midriff 
and a skirt cut to show every curve. Over it, he put an organza coat that 
floated like a cloud. 
</P>
<P>
Like YSL, many Paris designers showed bare skin and body-contoured or cutout 
clothes for spring. In contrast, Emmanuel Ungaro's new look is far more 
understated. 
</P>
<P>
Not that there aren't any curves by Ungaro for next season. But the designer 
has refined and streamlined some of his earlier, fraught-with-detail ideas and 
hourglass shapes. 
</P>
<P>
Even the flower-print bustiers worn with flirty, peplum suits have a lighter 
touch. Ungaro's prints and patterns are softer than of late, and his signature 
sheaths don't constrict the body this season. 
</P>
<P>
Also softened are the powerful shoulder lines Ungaro built into past 
collections. He's replaced them with lightly padded shapes. 
</P>
<P>
But there's still plenty of exuberance in the clothes -- particularly the 
fitted peplum or bolero jackets with pink or yellow piping, worn with 
flower-print crepe skirts in shades of orange and blue. 
</P>
<P>
Ungaro still flings colors, plaids and florals together. But this season the 
combinations really work: the wildflower fitted jackets, some with vests, look 
great with their torso-wrap jersey blouses and lean plaid or checked skirts. 
Waistlines in his suits are always wasp-waist small, and there is plenty of 
skin showing at the neckline. 
</P>
<P>
Ungaro's easier, softer mood also produced a raft of shifts and smock-style 
tops with puffy sleeves, as well as safari suits with easy, cropped pants. They 
were made of beautifully cut linen and worn with firmly belted tunics in color 
combinations of prune, brown, violet and peach.

Making Out Like Thieves 
</P>
<P>
Where can you pick up a Christian Lacroix suit for $200? Certainly not off the 
usual racks. Listen spied the outfit in the pricing office of the Thieves 
Market, the fashion bazaar to be held Oct. 28 at the Santa Monica Airport 
Center. Lacroix's miniskirted suit is among hundreds of secondhand items in the 
sale. There's an Oscar de la Renta peignoir for $50, a Missoni dress for $50, 
and a Calvin Klein suit for $150, not to mention the dozens of designer shoes 
uniformly priced at $30 per pair. And shoppers who spend $150 to attend the 
Gala Preview Party and Auction, set for today, will get first dibs on the 
goodies. Others will have second choice, from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Oct. 28, but 
admission is free. Information: (213) 825-3264.

</P>

Ever wonder where Chanel, Ungaro and Oscar de la Renta shop for the gilded, 
beaded, sequined, shimmering fabrics they use for their collections? One place 
is Jakob Schlerpfer Bambola, the Swiss textile design company. Now, spokeswoman 
Jeane deCoster explains, the firm is opening it's only U.S. retail store. And 
of all places, it's located a stone's throw from Marina del Rey harbor. The 
store's swanky fabrics, priced at $50 to $4,000 a yard, are quite a contrast to 
the T-shirt and surfer-wear shops in the neighborhood. Why here? "To test the 
market," deCoster says.

Get Your Old Shoes Here

Part of the fun at Saturday night's Halloween for Hope charity bash will be an 
auction of old Reeboks belonging to a number of celebrities, including George 
Burns, Tracey Ullman, Marlee Matlin, Arsenio Hall, Lakers Coach Pat Riley and 
tennis champ Michael Chang. A Reebok spokesperson says the company is planning 
to adorn each pair of worn and autographed athletic shoes with a little 
something "to match the celebrity's personality." But Whoopi Goldberg has beat 
them to the punch by decorating hers with miniature braids that resemble her 
signature dreadlocks. The $75-a-person costume ball takes place at 20th Century 
Fox Studios on the "Hooperman" sound stage. Information: City of Hope, (213) 
626-4611, ext. 327.

CAMPBELL: No one in the all-Republican Orange County legislative delegation has 
been as close to powerful Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown as state 
Sen. William Campbell (A1, A22), Sacramento insiders say. . . . "If you had 
something major that had to be done with the county, and if the Speaker was the 
roadblock, Campbell was a good person to be involved," one said. "I don't think 
there's anyone else in the delegation who can replace that." Said Brown: 
"Nobody dislikes Bill Campbell. We've been friends since Day 1." . . . And with 
two of the county's other prominent legislators -- Marian Bergeson and John 
Seymour -- seeking statewide office in 1990, don't look for either to rush in 
to fill the void. Dana Parsons and Rick VanderKnyff

Two federal officials from California charged Thursday that M. Danny Wall, the 
nation's chief savings and loan regulator, "shot them in the back" and blocked 
a timely seizure of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan that could have 
saved taxpayers as much as $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In separate testimony, state officials disclosed that an electronic listening 
device was discovered in Lincoln's offices in Irvine that could have been used 
to monitor conversations of state examiners as they called superiors about 
their audit of the troubled S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
The two federal regulators, who had raised red flags about Lincoln two years 
before the government finally acted, told the House Banking, Finance and Urban 
Affairs Committee that a similar financial disaster could occur again "because 
the same folks are still in charge of regulating thrifts." 
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Texas) immediately suggested that Wall 
step down or take temporary leave from his position as director of the Office 
of Thrift Supervision until the hearings into the Lincoln case are concluded. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, Wall's agency issued a statement saying that Thursday's 
session presented a one-sided story because two witnesses from its Washington 
office did not get a chance to testify. 
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, it is inappropriate for members of the committee to request . . . 
Wall to step aside permanently or until the hearings are completed," the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Bickwit, a Washington lawyer for Lincoln's parent company, American 
Continental Corp., said that the panel's hearings were "riddled from the start 
with factual inaccuracies." But Bickwit provided no specific denials to the 
allegations presented Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony of Michael Patriarca, director of the Office of Thrift 
Supervision's district office in San Francisco, and William K. Black, the 
district counsel, provided additional evidence that regional regulators had 
been stymied in their efforts to call attention to Lincoln's financial 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln was seized by federal regulators on April 14, 1989, the day after its 
parent company filed for bankruptcy. The cost of cleaning up the institution 
has been put at as high as $2 billion, which would make it the most expensive 
thrift failure in history. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the losses to the government's thrift deposit insurance fund, 
which ultimately will be absorbed by taxpayers, an estimated 22,000 individuals 
are expected to lose more than $200 million that they had invested in bonds 
issued by Lincoln's parent company. 
</P>
<P>
Wall, who was chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board before it was 
replaced by the Office of Thrift Supervision, and Charles H. Keating Jr., the 
flamboyant owner of Lincoln's parent company, have been subpoenaed to appear 
Nov. 7 before the House committee. 
</P>
<P>
The committee is investigating the two-year delay that preceded the 
government's seizure of Lincoln and the actions of five U.S. senators, 
including Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who intervened with federal regulators on 
behalf of the institution. 
</P>
<P>
Wall rejected a recommendation by the regional regulators that the government 
seize Lincoln in 1987, and he stripped the San Francisco office of its 
supervisory responsibility for the savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations made by Patriarca and Black, the San Francisco regulators, were 
underscored at Thursday's hearing by H. Joe Selby, former director of 
regulatory affairs at the bank board's Dallas office. 
</P>
<P>
"The problems (at Lincoln) were loud and clear as early as 1986," Selby 
testified. "Supervisory control should have been in place by late 1987." 
</P>
<P>
Black and Patriarca said that Lincoln used political influence with the five 
senators and got Wall's agency to make a series of "inexplicable" concessions 
that staved off appointment of a receiver to safeguard Lincoln's assets until 
last April. 
</P>
<P>
Wall, who has acknowledged having a series of meetings with Keating while the 
investigation was under way, has previously challenged the competence and 
objectivity of his agency's San Francisco office. 
</P>
<P>
In their first public reply, Black and Patriarca accused Wall and others in the 
bank board's Washington office of undercutting enforcement actions despite 
strong evidence of Lincoln's misconduct and unusually risky investments. 
</P>
<P>
"Chairman Wall's instructions . . . to achieve a 'peaceful' resolution with 
Lincoln assured the outcome," Black said. "All that remained was to negotiate 
the terms of the bank board's surrender." 
</P>
<P>
Black said that Lincoln was given effective veto power over which government 
official would be named to negotiate with the savings and loan, which 
government accountants would audit its books and which officials would 
supervise its day-to-day activities. 
</P>
<P>
A May 20, 1988, "memorandum of understanding" between the bank board and 
Lincoln was drafted by Lincoln's attorneys in cooperation with Rosemary 
Stewart, head of the bank board's enforcement office in Washington, Black said. 
</P>
<P>
It was ridiculed by regional regulators as "Rosemary's Baby" because it allowed 
Lincoln to increase its high-risk investments and violate other thrift 
regulations during the year before the firm finally was seized, Black 
contended. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Stewart signed a secret letter to Lincoln stating that the bank 
board would not refer anything found during its investigation to other 
government agencies for possible prosecution or enforcement actions. 
</P>
<P>
Wall demoted William Robertson, a career bank board official who had 
recommended that the government place Lincoln in receivership in July, 1987, 
and blocked a field examination of Lincoln by the San Francisco office in 
September, 1987, the California regulators said. 
</P>
<P>
Patriarca charged that Keating tried to pack the bank board with his 
hand-picked agents. He said that Keating was able to obtain a temporary 
appointment for Lee Henkel, who had borrowed $60 million from Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after he was named to the bank board in November, 1986, with the 
support of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and then-White House Chief of Staff 
Donald T. Regan, Henkel proposed a rule that would have directly benefited 
Lincoln, Patriarca said. 
</P>
<P>
Henkel resigned after the Office of Government Ethics referred the entire 
matter to the Justice Department for investigation, the committee was told. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln's consultant on direct investment, George J. Benston, almost was 
confirmed as a bank board member but withdrew his name from consideration for 
personal reasons, Patriarca said. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Greenspan, now chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, also was criticized 
by the federal regulators for his 1985 work as a paid consultant for Lincoln. 
Greenspan said in a Feb. 12, 1985, report that Lincoln was a "strong 
institution that poses no foreseeable risk" to the savings and loan deposit 
insurance fund. 
</P>
<P>
Black told the committee that Greenspan had an "abysmal" record of endorsing as 
healthy thrift institutions that were in fact headed for failure. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the listening device at Lincoln's offices in Irvine was 
disclosed to the committee by California Savings and Loan Commissioner William 
J. Crawford and his deputy, William Davis. 
</P>
<P>
The state regulators reported that the device was found after the government 
seized control of the institution in April. They said they did not know for 
certain if it was used to monitor telephone conversations by state examiners 
who were poring over Lincoln's records. 
</P>
<P>
Long before the device was discovered, the regulators said, they had suspected 
that Lincoln was gathering intelligence on the audit, and they had cautioned 
their examiners to use a pay telephone if they had any confidential material to 
discuss. 
</P>
<P>
Bickwit, the American Continental attorney, said that the company never 
authorized or took part in any bugging activity.

L.A. OPENS DAYWORKER HIRING SITE TO ALL COMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a controversial program that will effectively aid the hiring of illegal 
immigrants by private employers, the city of Los Angeles today will begin 
encouraging day laborers to move from their usual street-corner gathering 
places to a city-operated hiring site. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes as planned, more than 150 day laborers, many of them illegal 
immigrants, will be bused from the intersection of Pacific Coast Highway and 
Belle Porte Avenue to nearby Harbor Regional Park in Harbor City, where they 
will be registered by city employees and hired by private contractors. 
</P>
<P>
The move is the latest by Southern California cities in a continuing effort to 
regulate the hiring of day laborers by private contractors and get the workers 
off the streets and away from residences and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Cities in Orange County, increasingly seen as an attractive destination for 
undocumented workers, have also begun to grapple with the problems caused by 
large gatherings of day laborers. Three cities -- Costa Mesa, Orange and Dana 
Point -- have passed controversial laws banning street solicitation for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Costa Mesa last October opened what is believed to be the first 
city-sponsored hiring hall of its kind in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach officials, faced with a growing number of day laborers who 
congregate along busy Laguna Canyon Road, recently established an informal 
hiring lot on the road to accommodate day laborers and employers. 
</P>
<P>
And in Dana Point, officials recently established a hot line service for day 
laborers. Workers can get information on jobs 24 hours a day from volunteers at 
the Telephone Hiring Exchange and through recorded telephone messages. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 1986 federal Immigration Reform and Control Act makes it illegal 
for employers to hire undocumented immigrants, city officials say they will 
admit all of the day laborers regardless of their immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
And, in what may mark a major departure from past federal immigration tactics, 
recently appointed INS Western Regional Commissioner Ben Davidian said Thursday 
that, although he would like to see changes in the city program, his agents 
will not raid the site. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office argues that Los Angeles, although helping illegal 
immigrants find work, is not violating new immigration law because the city is 
not directly hiring the laborers. The move is part of a six-month pilot program 
aimed at regulating the hiring of dayworkers who typically find work by 
congregating at selected intersections around the city. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council unanimously approved the creation of six or seven officially 
sanctioned hiring sites in February in response to complaints from residents in 
Harbor City and other communities about the workers loitering, blocking traffic 
and harassing women. The council also agreed to establish eight other hiring 
sites -- one in each council district -- if the pilot program succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the only way to stop people from congregating on street corners is 
to have them go to specific sites," said Bernie Evans, chief deputy to 
Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who authored the city ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Evans said the pilot program may cause a dilemma for the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, which is charged with preventing employers from hiring 
undocumented immigrants, but he added, "This (program) is a local solution to a 
local problem." 
</P>
<P>
According to city officials, several thousand laborers, mostly Latino men, 
gather each morning at about 25 street corners scattered throughout the city to 
seek daywork. On most days, chaos reigns at the intersections. Desperate for 
work, the men often rush into traffic to check out a prospective employer, 
panicking some motorists.

O.C. BUILDINGS FOUND FAIRLY QUAKE-SAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Orange County buildings, particularly newer structures, probably would fare 
well in a massive earthquake such as the temblor that struck Northern 
California last week, UC Irvine engineers who inspected the damage said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Much remains to be done, however, to strengthen or buffer buildings in areas 
prone to liquefaction, and the cost of such reinforcement is too high for most 
residential property owners, the experts said during a news conference at UCI. 
</P>
<P>
Liquefaction -- the churning of sandy soil during an earthquake that is likened 
to the action of a blender -- is a threat in some coastal areas of Orange 
County. Damage can be lessened by compacting or draining the wet soil or adding 
foundation and structural braces, according to the UCI engineers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a matter of economics, not technology," said Roberto Villaverde, an 
associate professor of civil engineering. Villaverde was one of a half-dozen 
UCI professors and doctoral candidates who studied the collapse of the Nimitz 
Freeway in San Francisco and building damage throughout the region as part of 
an investigation by the Earthquake Engineering Institute in El Cerrito. 
</P>
<P>
"If we go to the homeowner and say, 'In order to have your house safe, you will 
have to spend thousands and thousands of dollars,' and they think the chances 
of an earthquake are small, they will say, 'No way,' " Villaverde said. 
"Overall, I believe that buildings here are more or less safe." 
</P>
<P>
Public and commercial buildings built in the last decade or less are likely to 
hold up best in a severe quake because of constantly toughened state building 
requirements, said Robin Shepherd, head of UCI's reconnaissance team. 
</P>
<P>
"We know of no building that failed that was in compliance with the 1982 or 
1985 Uniform Building Code," Shepherd said. "The buildings that survived best 
were designed to the most recent code and faithfully executed by the 
contractor. We can learn from the errors and omissions which have shown up in 
San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
Despite more than 60 deaths and billions of dollars in damage, the devastation 
of Northern California was far less than the toll in a similar magnitude 
earthquake in Soviet Armenia a year ago. Shepherd said higher construction 
standards and greater preparedness helped the densely populated San Francisco 
region escape massive casualties. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a success story for structural engineers," he said. "We are providing a 
higher level of seismic safety for less money."

TATTERED QUEEN OF THE '20S; 
</P>
<P>
REDEVELOPMENT: A RUNDOWN DREAM HOUSE BUILT BY SAN CLEMENTE'S FOUNDER MAY BECOME 
A RENOVATION CENTERPIECE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Casa Romantica, the 20-room home of San Clemente's founder, Ole Hanson, once 
was a plush mansion tended by servants and frequented by movie stars. 
</P>
<P>
Today it is a tattered remnant of that gathering place for the glamorous in the 
1920s. Its cracked ceilings are in danger of collapsing under rain, the 
plumbing and wiring are in desperate need of repair, and the sandy bluff under 
the home is crumbling from years of erosion. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated cost of fixing the mess is $350,000, according to a recent city 
study. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to save Hanson's dream home from natural destruction, the San 
Clemente Redevelopment Agency this year completed a $2.5-million deal to buy 
the house, the bluff it sits on and a parking lot below at the San Clemente 
Pier. 
</P>
<P>
This total five-acre site, city officials hope, will be the centerpiece for the 
ongoing renovation of the Pier Bowl area, the title given to the shops and 
restaurants on the street fronting the pier and the city's most heavily 
populated stretch of beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Casa Romantica purchase is an outgrowth of an ongoing effort of 
the Pier Bowl upgrade," Councilman Scott Diehl said. "It will be the capstone 
to the pier development. 
</P>
<P>
A developer selected by city officials is designing a commercial project for 
the site that would include a hotel, restaurant and multilevel parking lot and 
would preserve the home. Those plans are expected to be unveiled sometime next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime San Clemente resident Dorothy Fuller, 64, who lived in Casa Romantica 
for 14 summers after Hanson lost it during the Depression, said she would "love 
to see this place be the symbol of the American dream of free enterprise. It 
shows what a young man can do by following his dreams." 
</P>
<P>
Hanson single-handedly founded the city of San Clemente in 1928 as a "Spanish 
Village by the Sea," characterized by Mediterranean-style white, stucco homes 
topped with red tile roofs dotting the rolling hills above the secluded beach. 
Its first-year population was 650. 
</P>
<P>
Entering into a partnership with his longtime business associate, oil magnate 
Henry Hamilton Cotton, Hanson built 300 stucco houses between 1925 and 1929, 
many of which are still standing despite San Clemente's post-World War II 
growth. Cotton's 70-acre estate on the southernmost end of the city later 
served as the Western White House under former President Richard M. Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent tour of Casa Romantica, the 11th of Hanson's 13 children, Eugene 
(Bunny) Hanson, 74, recalled the elegant parties hosted by his parents, 
featuring screen stars Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, Mary Astor and Richard 
Dix. 
</P>
<P>
"They used the solarium for dancing," he said. "It was the thing to do to have 
these parties. We were the entertainment capital then." 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Hanson, who remembered when the family moved into the house in 1926, 
spun tales of jilted lovers and of gangsters running bootleg liquor through 
town. He laughed at the memory of annoying famed violinist Jascha Heifetz, the 
neighbor, by starting a sputtering power lawn mower every time Heifetz began to 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Ashbaugh, a 17-year San Clemente resident who has studied the town 
founder's life, said, "I never heard of Ole Hanson until I moved here, and now 
I feel like I know everything about him." 
</P>
<P>
Ashbaugh, who is president of the San Clemente Historical Society, and his 
supporters are lobbying city officials to include some museum space in the 
redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
Ashbaugh has made it his personal mission for the last four years to find and 
collect furnishings that once were part of Casa Romantica, saving them in a 
self-storage unit. 
</P>
<P>
The list includes the desk that graced Hanson's octagon-shaped office, a huge 
Spanish mosaic taken from a patio wall and other pieces gleaned from the widows 
of Hanson's sons. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson, who once was a millionaire three times over, died penniless in 1940 at 
age 66, Fuller said. The Bank of America repossessed the home in 1932. Although 
Hanson built it for $170,000, it was purchased by Cotton's chauffeur in the 
1940s for $8,000. In 1960, George Welsh of San Clemente bought the house for 
$120,000. He sold it this year to the city. 
</P>
<P>
For the last five years, Casa Romantica has been leased for $10,000 a year to 
Maureen Capielo, who stages weddings and corporate parties in the huge living 
and dining rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to put $10,000 or more into this place and fix some of the things 
wrong with it," Capielo said, adding that she is also interested in buying the 
home if the redevelopment plans fail.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;

<P>
POLICE GIVE WARNINGS ON MINOR WARRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A new Costa Mesa police policy allows people caught with outstanding 
misdemeanor warrants to get a warning rather than a trip to jail, a top police 
official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Under a policy adopted by the department, only people who received a warrant 
for skipping an appearance in Harbor Municipal Court will get hauled off to see 
the judge, Police Capt. Tom Lazar said. All others are simply warned to clear 
up their warrants and set free, unless officers from the department that 
originally arrested them want to come and get them. 
</P>
<P>
Without the change of policy -- it was quietly instituted about two months ago 
-- Costa Mesa officers would have to drive prisoners wanted for violations in 
other jurisdictions directly to County Jail, sharply reducing patrol time, 
Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Costa Mesa officers avoided the drive and wait at the central jail 
by simply dropping off warrant violators at Harbor Court. There, all of those 
whose warrants were issued in other Municipal Courts would be held in a 
marshal's lockup to await a sheriff's bus for a ride to jail. 
</P>
<P>
But during the summer, the Sheriff's Department stopped providing the bus 
service for warrant violators. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Lt. Richard J. Olson said the service was stopped because the 
prisoners would have to wait hours before receiving medical checks upon their 
arrival at the main jail. Without the checks, the Sheriff's Department could be 
exposed to legal liability if a prisoner were later found to be seriously ill 
or injured. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Court handles cases originating in Costa Mesa, Newport Beach and Irvine.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA; 
</P>
<P>
CONSTRUCTION BEGINS ON TRABUCO BRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With a flourish of congratulations and a passing swipe at no-growth advocates, 
officials from Orange County, the Santa Margarita Co. and other South County 
agencies opened construction on a Trabuco Arroyo bridge expansion Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The new bridge will be next to an existing span on Santa Margarita Parkway, 
expanding it from four to six lanes and increasing access to thousands of homes 
that sit across the arroyo from Mission Viejo. With an estimated price tag of 
$7.5 million, the bridge is being financed out of the Foothill Circulation 
Phasing Plan, and it marks the latest construction project to be undertaken as 
part of that ambitious road construction program. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony R. Moiso, president of the Santa Margarita Co., proudly kicked off the 
project Thursday and said he expects it to be complete within about 15 months. 
The bridge and other parts of the $250-million phasing plan will demonstrate 
"to the public, to the nay-saying, no-growth public" that traffic in booming 
South County can be accommodated by developers, Moiso told a gathering of 
several dozen people. 
</P>
<P>
Construction costs for the bridge include about $1 million in environmental 
mitigation, which will include moving some trees to save them. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, with Oakland's Nimitz Freeway in a shambles, Orange County officials 
hastened to assure residents that the expanded structure will be up to snuff on 
earthquake standards. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been assured all current seismological and technological requirements are 
met," County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said. JIM NEWTON

FIRM OFFERS TO SELL 276 ACRES OF PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Irvine Co. Chairman Donald L. Bren Thursday offered to sell 276 acres of land 
earmarked for the controversial Laguna Laurel housing community to the city of 
Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Bren's offer, carrying a $38-million price tag, would scrap plans for a 
237-acre private golf course and reduce the controversial 3,200-home project 
near the mouth of Laguna Canyon by about 250 homes. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said the offer is contingent on the city's accepting the rest 
of the terms of the Laguna Laurel proposal. Under the agreement, city officials 
would also be required to lend their support to the proposed San Joaquin Hills 
Transportation Corridor and the widening of Laguna Canyon Road, two projects 
that have met stiff resistance in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach Mayor Pro Tem Lida Lenney criticized the offer. 
</P>
<P>
"From my point of view, there are too many strings attached, and it is too 
cost-prohibitive," Lenney said. "They're still going along with their 
development; they will still be wrapped around both sides of the canyon and one 
of the lakes." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Robert F. Gentry said that although the company addresses some of the 
city's concerns, such as possible pollution from the proposed golf course, the 
project's density will not change dramatically, Gentry said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we would spend $38 million, the question . . . is if we reduced development 
by 500 homes, is that an equitable deal?" Gentry said. "That takes about 5,000 
car trips a day out of a development that is going to generate about 35,000 car 
trips a day." 
</P>
<P>
City officials and residents have contested the proposed development because of 
environmental concerns. They fear that the 2,150 -- acre project would send 
runoff, including pesticides from the golf course, into the ocean through storm 
drains. Others simply want the rural canyon maintained in its natural state. 
</P>
<P>
The golf course would be a dead issue were the city to accept the terms of the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Gentry said the matter will be placed on the agenda for the Nov. 7 City Council 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Gentry said company officials made the offer during a meeting Thursday with 
Gentry, Lenney, City Manager Kenneth C. Frank and Irvine Co. Executive Vice 
President Gary Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said they made the offer because the proposed golf course 
appeared to be an obstacle to the project. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups, who say the new offer doesn't change much, are still 
making plans for a Nov. 11 walk along Laguna Canyon Road to protest the 
project. TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND

DEVELOPER'S LATEST PARK PLAN REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE NICOLOSI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city's Recreation and Parks Commission has rejected the latest plans by 
Mola Development for a new public park near the Hellman Ranch property and 
wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
Commission members turned the plan down because they felt it was confusing and 
it seemed to contain inflated cost estimates. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed park would be located on the southwest side of the city on land 
adjacent to the Hellman Ranch property, where Mola Development has plans for a 
new residential project. 
</P>
<P>
Mola representative Kirk Evans agreed to prepare a more coherent cost analysis 
in time for the next commission meeting, scheduled for Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
But according to Evans, the estimated cost of developing the 15-acre park is 
higher than the $1.1 million that was originally agreed upon because commission 
members "are adding things onto it that weren't there before." 
</P>
<P>
If the company included all the city's wishes, the cost of the park would 
skyrocket to $1.9 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The original plan, approved by the City Council in August, featured nine tennis 
courts, a 3,300-square-foot duck pond, restrooms, two basketball courts and 
landscaping, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
The revised proposal for park amenities, drafted by the park commission last 
month, calls for eliminating the duck pond and one of the tennis courts and 
adding a racquetball court, more grass areas, a sand volleyball court and two 
horseshoe pits. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the proposal called for a 2,000-square-foot community building 
complete with restrooms and a kitchen, a gazebo, a raised viewing area near the 
adjacent wetlands, more parking spaces and a storage area. 
</P>
<P>
Mola architects estimate that the commission's changes will increase the cost 
of the project by $800,000, but according to Gregory Weiler, commission 
chairman, part of the reason the cost is so high is that Mola's prices are 
high. 
</P>
<P>
"We may require an audit of this proposal by the city's Finance Department 
before we can approve it," Weiler said. "The commission is very disturbed with 
these numbers." MICHELLE NICOLOSI

DISTRICT SETTLES SUIT FILED BY EX-PRINCIPAL

<TEXT>
<P>
After more than five years of legal wrangling, the lawsuit filed by former 
Valencia Park Elementary School Principal John Roseman against the Fullerton 
School District has been settled. 
</P>
<P>
But both parties declined to disclose details, saying that they have agreed to 
keep it confidential. 
</P>
<P>
Roseman filed a $1-million claim against the district, alleging that he 
suffered heavy financial and emotional losses when the district demoted him in 
1983 from principal to teacher. His demotion arose out of an incident in which 
a 5-year-old girl and her parents alleged that Roseman had molested the child. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors dropped charges against Roseman when it was disclosed that he was 
simply cleaning up the 5-year-old girl, who had soiled her pants. 
</P>
<P>
But the board demoted Roseman from principal to teacher anyway, claiming that 
he had exercised poor judgment in the handling of the incident. Roseman quit 
his job at the school and filed suit. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, attorneys for the school district tried unsuccessfully to 
have Roseman's claims for unspecified damages thrown out of the Orange County 
Superior Court lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
J. Michael Declues, lawyer for the district, confirmed Thursday that a 
settlement had been reached but said the agreement barred the parties from 
providing details. DAVAN MAHARAJ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COOPERATION CLEARS WAY, EDUCATORS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cooperation among high schools, community colleges and universities in Orange 
County is removing barriers to higher education for minorities and others who 
might otherwise be shut out, county education leaders said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little embarrassing," said Rudy Castruita, superintendent of Santa Ana 
Unified School District, "but three or four years ago, our counselors did not 
know what the requirements were for the state university systems. The 
cooperative programs we have now are making college a reality for our 
youngsters. Before, it was just a dream." 
</P>
<P>
Castruita, who heads the predominantly Latino district with 43,000 pupils, 
joined Cal State Fullerton President Jewel Plummer Cobb and executives of four 
community college districts Thursday at a "State of Education in Orange County" 
breakfast meeting hosted by UC Irvine Chancellor Jack W. Peltason. 
</P>
<P>
The links between the institutions have resulted in programs to encourage 
minority students to pursue college education and in unified lobbying to get 
more state money, Peltason said. 
</P>
<P>
And while he said the ultimate cooperative effort -- establishment of a new 
campus in the booming South County that would combine programs of the 
University of California, California State University and Saddleback Community 
College -- is still just a wish, Peltason said he sees no reason to rule it 
out. Saddleback Chancellor Richard Sneed and Cal State Fullerton President Cobb 
have suggested that such a university might grow out of CSUF's new satellite 
campus in Mission Viejo. JEAN DAVIDSON

JUDGE DELAYS GROSSO TRIAL, ORDERS PSYCHIATRIC EXAMINATION OF SUSPECT 
</P>

<P>
A judge interrupted the trial of Joseph Grosso and ordered a psychiatric 
examination of the distraught defendant Thursday, one day after Grosso blamed a 
murder attempt on the underboss of a Los Angeles organized crime family. 
</P>
<P>
Acquaintances of Grosso in Orange County Jail, where he is being held, said he 
was unable to sleep and was extremely agitated after testifying Wednesday that 
Michael Anthony Rizzitello Jr., reputed underboss of the Milano organized crime 
family, shot a topless bar owner three times in an attempt to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Superior Court Judge John L. Flynn ordered prosecutors and 
defense attorneys not to discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzitello is a co-defendant with Grosso on charges of attempted murder in the 
1987 shooting of William Carroll, a financier associated with the Mustang Club, 
a now-defunct topless bar in Santa Ana. Grosso testified Wednesday that 
Rizzitello, who will be tried separately, shot Carroll three times in the back 
of the head. Carroll was found bleeding and near death in the parking lot of 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll survived the attack, but was blinded. Carroll earlier testified that 
Rizzitello shot him. 
</P>
<P>
After an in-chambers hearing Thursday which lasted more than an hour, Flynn 
interrupted the trial and Grosso's testimony, telling jurors to return Monday. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Grosso told jurors that he drove the car in which Carroll was 
shot, but said he was surprised by the shooting, and denied prosecution claims 
that he was involved. 
</P>
<P>
Grosso also denied the prosecutors' contention that Rizzitello wanted to gain 
control of the lucrative Mustang topless bar on Harbor Boulevard. Rizzitello, 
62, is scheduled to go on trial next month in the Carroll shooting. Rizzitello 
has a long history of fraud and racketeering convictions. 
</P>
<P>
Grosso's acquaintances in the Orange County Jail said Thursday that he is 
worried the Milano crime family will be angry with him for "giving up" 
Rizzitello. 
</P>
<P>
Grosso's best friend, "Big George" Yudzevich, who also worked at the Mustang, 
was shot to death last year in Irvine. Authorities say it's possible his death 
was ordered because he testified before an East Coast grand jury about a New 
York crime family's activities. 
</P>
<P>
"Joey (Grosso) is scared all right," one acquaintance said. "He knows what 
happened to Big George." 
</P>
<P>
Whether Grosso will resume the witness stand Monday is still unknown. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Grosso also suggested in testimony that Carroll was responsible 
for the unsolved murders of racing entrepreneur Mickey Thompson and his wife 
Trudi last year. 
</P>
<P>
Grosso testified that he once heard Carroll ask Yudzevich to commit a murder, 
but Yudzevich refused. Then, Grosso told the jurors, Carroll asked Yudzevich if 
he would pick up somebody on a bicycle who would be committing a murder for 
him. "It was a race-car driver. Mickey Thompson," Grosso said. 
</P>
<P>
But on cross-examination, Grosso said he only deduced that Carroll was talking 
about Mickey Thompson in jail after reading newspapers stories that Thompson 
and his wife had been shot by gunmen who rode away on bicycles. On 
cross-examination, Grosso explained that Carroll never said anything about a 
race-car driver. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials were skeptical of Grosso's accusations, and said that 
Carroll is not a suspect in the Thompson murders. One official said that 
Grosso's claims about Carroll were made to law enforcement officials long 
before his trial began.

It is really pathetic that the United States is so afraid of the truth being 
spoken in this country about the pending Nicaraguan elections. Norma Cuadra, 
representative of the Nicaraguan Institute for Economic and Social Research, 
was to have spoken last Tuesday on the Cal State Fullerton campus about the 
possibility for better relations between the United States and Nicaragua and 
the role of international organizations in the 1990 Nicaraguan elections. At 
the last minute she was denied entrance to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Thus a chance for an important educational exchange is lost to the students. 
But the image of the U.S. State Department as a bully is seen again with great 
clarity. DOROTHY CALLISON, Fullerton

BILL HAWKINS NOW MEETING EXPECTATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: ROOKIE DEFENSIVE LINEMAN FROM MIAMI IS TRYING TO LEARN NEW POSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

ANAHEIM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bill Hawkins press-clipping service has taken an extended leave of absence 
since the Rams' first-round draft choice scattered some headlines a few months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawkins highlights have actually amounted to two: There was April 23, the 
day the Rams selected the University of Miami defensive end with the 21st pick 
overall, and Aug. 18, when Hawkins ended his 36-day holdout and signed a 
four-year, $1.925-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
Since, Hawkins has all but dried up and disappeared from public view, despite 
high expectations and his rather prominent role as an inside pass rusher. 
</P>
<P>
Through seven games of his rookie season, the longed-for second coming of 
Merlin Olsen has two tackles and no sacks. 
</P>
<P>
The second coming of Donald Evans, maybe? 
</P>
<P>
Not so fast, there. Evans, the failed Ram experiment of 1987, never so much as 
brushed a quarterback, unless you count nudging teammate Jim Everett in the 
lunch line. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins, conversely, has played in every game, and his uniform has needed 
laundry service after each one. He swears he is creeping, if ever so slowly, 
toward the opposing pocket, even though it doesn't always appear that way on 
your television screens. 
</P>
<P>
Against Buffalo, he grazed quarterback Frank Reich a few times, combining with 
Brett Faryniarz on one sack that was negated because of penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"Just touching the guy is fun for me right now," Hawkins admitted. 
</P>
<P>
You think it's easy for a big-time college player from a big-time program to 
struggle so? One of Miami's Hurricanes, no less? 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins' problems come with their own explanations, not to be confused with 
excuses. 
</P>
<P>
First off, he didn't show up until mid-August because of contract difficulties, 
putting him weeks behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
When he did arrive, the Rams asked him to switch positions, from defensive end 
to defensive tackle, which isn't as easy as moving three steps to your left. 
Tackles are attacked from all sides, as opposed to one, making the route to the 
quarterback all the more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
At times this season, Hawkins has appeared lost, confused and overwhelmed in 
games -- sometimes all three at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins explains: "There have been some games where it's been like, 'I can't do 
nothing.' But I'm a very realistic person, I'm long-sighted. I don't think if I 
don't get a sack right now I'm going to commit suicide, although it feels like 
that sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Sacks, of course, are quite a concern with the Rams this season, and Hawkins 
draws the inevitable comparisons to Gary Jeter, the man Hawkins replaced at 
defensive tackle. Jeter, lost to Plan B free agency in the off-season, had a 
career-high 11.5 sacks for the Rams in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
At last count, that's still 11 1/2 more than Hawkins has managed this season. 
And that's putting more heat on the Ram secondary, which currently ranks 28th 
in pass defense. 
</P>
<P>
You need more evidence? Through seven games in 1988, the Rams had 38 sacks. 
They have 13 in seven games this year. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins understands that a football team awaits his emergence, but says 
everyone -- even Miami Hurricanes -- need time to grow up. 
</P>
<P>
"When I get in the game, I get awed," he said. "Because I'm playing in the 
pros. It's like 'Wow, I'm playing in the bleeping pros.' Meanwhile, some people 
in the press have taken shots, but coming from Miami, the paper down there was 
the same way, so I'm used to it." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams had hoped Hawkins would come around more quickly, although his slow 
start was not unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
"There are three things that happened here," defensive coordinator Fritz 
Shurmur said. "One is that he moved up a hell of a level of football. Two, he 
moved from an outside to an inside guy, and it's an entirely different deal. 
Hell, they're hitting you from all sides. The third thing, obviously, those 
practices that were designed to take young players and get them fundamentally 
ready to play a position on our team, he missed because he was late. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to teach him how to do things on the run but had to spend the 
majority of our time just getting him lined up right. He's got no recall; he 
has nothing to draw on. That's put him in a really tough position." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams have not lost faith. In fact, they are playing Hawkins more each week. 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson illustrates Hawkins' progress with his hands, with a 
gradual motion of ascending levels. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not trying to BS you," he said. "I'm not trying to defend the draft pick. 
We feel very good about him. . . . He's going to be an every-down player." 
</P>
<P>
There is no talk of switching Hawkins back to defensive end, at least not this 
season. The Rams still see him as a steady, Olsen-type tackle for years to 
come. Hawkins, naturally, has some catching up to do. 
</P>
<P>
"Every snap we put in him is an investment in a way," Shurmur said. "After 
having an athlete inside like Gary Jeter, we could see the benefit of having a 
quicker guy in there than an average defensive lineman. That's really what that 
was based on. I would think that he would have been a little more effective 
earlier if we put him outside to start with. At the same time, we were trying 
to fill a need that had been established by the departure of Gary Jeter." 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins said he's on the verge of making an impact. He said there's no stopping 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"Honest to God, like in practice, when I stay low, I do so well," Hawkins said. 
"Then I go out in the game and keep doing the same stupid things wrong. I guess 
it's just being a rookie, and not having any experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I took the attitude that I know these guys are better than me, because they 
have more experience. That's the name of the game right now. But none of them 
came from the University of Miami, so I figure I've got a jump on them and, 
given time, I'll be better. That's what I say to myself. I don't mean to sound 
arrogant. In time, I'll work into being the player I want to be, because some 
of these people are from Weber State or whatever. I can be as good as them."

Greg Bell suffered a lower back strain in Wednesday's practice and didn't 
practice Thursday. John Robinson said Bell's chances of playing against the 
Bears on Sunday have been downgraded to 50-50. Bell rushed past reporters on 
his way to the locker room after practice. Asked if he would play Sunday, Bell 
would only say, "I hope so, yeah." . . . If Bell can't make it, Robinson said 
the tailback position would be shared equally by Gaston Green and Cleveland 
Gary, although Green would probably start. "He's older," Robinson quipped. . . 
. Bell gained 417 rushing yards in his first three games, but has been held to 
192 in the last four, averaging 3.3 yards a carry in that span. . . . Mike 
Tomczak will continue as the starting quarterback for the Bears, Chicago Coach 
Mike Ditka said.

Bolsa Grande High School gambled and won for most of its Garden Grove League 
game against Pacifica Thursday, converting four fourth-down situations in the 
first half. But in the crucial moments, the gamblers got careless and the game 
slipped away. Pacifica won, 20-16, at Bolsa Grande Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"This one will really hurt," said Bill Holst, Bolsa Grande coach. "We had them 
where we wanted them and then it just slipped away." 
</P>
<P>
Holst had seen his team control the ball for most of the first half, in large 
part due to two Pacifica fumbles. Bolsa Grande (4-4 overall, 3-2 in league) had 
a 16-13 halftime lead. But Pacifica (5-2-1, 5-0) ended up scoring the winning 
touchdown on a drive set up by a Bolsa Grande mistake and then stopped two 
Bolsa Grande drives deep in Pacifica territory by recovering a fumble and 
intercepting a pass. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the game slipped away on a couple of bounces. The first came early in 
the fourth quarter with Bolsa Grande leading 16-13. A Pacifica punt was 
bounding down the field when it hit the back of the leg of Bolsa Grande's Fred 
Ornelas who was blocking on the play. 
</P>
<P>
Pacifica's Bennett Kim pounced on the ball and the Mariners had a first down on 
the Bolsa Grande 34. Two rushing plays yielded four yards, and on third down 
Pacifica quarterback Bobby Anderson threw a pass to Mark Flatten that appeared 
to be intercepted by Bolsa Grande's Trent Wood. 
</P>
<P>
But officials ruled that Wood had bumped Flatten and, on the pass interference 
penalty, gave Pacifica a first down at the Bolsa Grande 15. Four plays later, 
Anderson scored his second rushing touchdown of the night, this one on a 
three-yard run. Anderson's extra point gave Pacifica the eventual winning 
margin of 20-16. Anderson also threw for the game's first score, a three-yard 
pass to Blaine Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't tell what happened," Bill Craven, Pacifica coach, said. "I didn't 
know if we caught it, they caught it or if it was incomplete." 
</P>
<P>
Holst was a little more opinionated. "Terrible call," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Bolsa Grande didn't seemed fazed, taking possession at its 30 and 
driving to the Pacifica 22 in eight plays. But Carlos Torres fumbled and 
Pacifica's Chris Maroney recovered to end the drive with 5:18 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Bolsa Grande got the ball back with 1:47 to play and started driving again. On 
a fourth-and-three from his 28, Bolsa Grande quarterback Sonny Nguyen completed 
a 38-yard pass to Wood. Bolsa Grande had the ball on the Pacifica 34 with 
little more than a minute to go. But on the next play, Nguyen, who completed 12 
of 18 passes for 186 yards, threw his first interception, this one by Mike 
Christie, and Bolsa Grande's chances ended.

SADDLEBACK BOYS FINALLY BEAT CORONA DEL MAR IN CROSS-COUNTRY

Led by Eddie Salinas' record-breaking performance, the No. 1-ranked Saddleback 
High School boys' cross-country team edged Corona del Mar, 26-29, Thursday in a 
Sea View League dual meet at Mason Park. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas, a junior, ran the mostly flat, three-mile course in 14 minutes 38 
seconds, eclipsing the previous mark of 15:02 set last year by former Corona 
del Mar star Eddie Lavelle. 
</P>
<P>
Since Saddleback joined the Sea View League seven years ago, the school had 
never beaten Corona del Mar in cross-country. And Corona del Mar had not lost a 
dual meet since 1985. The Sea Kings, ranked sixth in the county, are the 
three-time defending league champions. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been looking forward to this for three years," Saddleback Coach Mel 
Silva said. "We decided that if we were to be one of the best teams, we had to 
beat the best team in the league." 
</P>
<P>
Although four Corona del Mar runners took the lead from the start, Saddleback's 
one-two punch of Salinas and Robbie Price took over and, by the two-mile mark, 
held a commanding lead. In the final mile, Corona del Mar's Chris Cannon closed 
in and passed Price, finishing second in 14:50. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' race, Corona del Mar breezed to a 15-47 victory, with Sea Kings 
Kristen McFarland and Johanna Wallin tying for first in 19:30.

His team doesn't roll up flashy statistics, but Esperanza High School Coach 
Gary Meek knows the most important numbers are the ones on the scoreboard after 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza rolled up the right numbers Thursday night, defeating Cypress, 28-3, 
in an Empire League game at Bradford Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a very unselfish team," Meek said. "We have 48 football players on this 
team who don't care who gets the credit." 
</P>
<P>
Chipping in for Esperanza (5-3 overall, 2-1 in league) Thursday night were 
tailback Lance Brown, who gained 118 yards in 20 carries and scored a 
touchdown; tight end Reid Pullen (four receptions for 62 yards); receiver Jarod 
Smith, who had two scoring passes of 16 and 15 yards, and fullbacks Mark Parlin 
and Garrett Emry, who gained 78 and 74 yards, respectively, against Cypress 
(3-5, 1-2). 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza inside linebacker Keith Navidi, the team's defensive leader, 
dislocated and possibly fractured his right elbow in the first quarter and was 
sent to Placentia Linda Hospital. Later, Cypress nose guard Jason Bern suffered 
a neck injury and was admitted to Placentia Linda. His condition was unknown 
late Thursday night. STUART MATTHEWS

SANTA ANA GETS OFFENSIVE AGAIN FOR 38-21 VICTORY

Santa Ana High School rediscovered offensive football Thursday night. A week 
late perhaps, but in time to keep its Century League title hopes alive. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints, who had averaged only 13 points in their past four games, hit a 
season high in points during a 38-21 victory over Canyon in front of 500 at El 
Modena High School. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't just that Santa Ana was able to score -- and score a lot -- it 
was the way it did it. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints (6-2 overall, 2-1 in league play) ran the ball and kept on running 
it. They gained 214 yards rushing even without tailback Garner Hicks, who has 
680 yards rushing on the season but missed his second consecutive game with a 
knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
Al Rivas, Hick's replacement, gained 104 yards in 17 carries. He also had a 
49-yard touchdown called back because of a holding penalty. 
</P>
<P>
True, all this came against Canyon, a team that has lost 15 consecutive league 
games. But it was encouraging for Santa Ana, nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Saints saw their 18-game league win streak come to an end with a 
21-14 loss to Villa Park. They gained only 31 yards rushing in that game. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked all week on blocking for our backs," quarterback Jesse Rosas said. 
"We knew we were going to be without Garner again." 
</P>
<P>
The Saints ran the ball so effectively that it eventually opened up the passing 
lanes for Rosas. After completing only one of his first seven passes, Rosas hit 
six of his last seven. He finished with only 92 yards passing, but threw three 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints took a 14-0 lead, but saw Canyon (2-6, 0-3) score two second-quarter 
touchdowns to tie the score. With two minutes left in the first half, however, 
Santa Ana drove 43 yards to break the tie. Rosas completed a 26-yard pass to 
Octavio Medina and then threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to Gus Valencia.

RANCHO SANTIAGO WILL TRY TO RECOVER AGAINST GOLDEN WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rancho Santiago College is hoping to rebound and Golden West is looking for an 
upset in a Mission Conference Central Division football game at 7 tonight at 
Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago opened the season with five victories but was defeated by 
Riverside, 34-24, last Saturday. The Dons are 5-1 overall, 4-1 in conference 
play and 0-1 in the division. 
</P>
<P>
The Dons were ranked sixth in the national J.C. Grid-Wire poll before the loss, 
but now are 19th. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West (3-2, 2-2, 0-1) is going for its third Friday night victory of the 
season. Games are normally played on Saturday, but due to scheduling conflicts 
created because Golden West shares a field with Orange Coast, the Rustlers 
already have played -- and won -- twice on Friday this season.

COUNTY ECONOMIC GROWTH TO SLOW, ANALYST PREDICTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joseph Wahed, Wells Fargo Bank's chief economist, has been watching the Orange 
County economy for 25 years, and he has never been so conservative about the 
area's economic prospects. 
</P>
<P>
In his latest report released Thursday, Wahed projected that employment and 
income growth will not match the frantic pace of the 1970s and 1980s. Still, 
Orange County will maintain its position as one of the nation's most vibrant 
economic areas. 
</P>
<P>
"The outlook isn't bad," Wahed said. 
</P>
<P>
Gross regional product -- the total value of goods and services produced in the 
county -- will grow by 3.7% next year, and should average 3.6% annually through 
1995, Wahed said. The county will remain the wealthiest area in Southern 
California, with per-capita income reaching $25,900 by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Job growth will drop to 2.6% next year, down from the 4.5% average gain since 
1982, but should stabilize at 2.8% through the middle of the next decade, 
according to Wells Fargo. 
</P>
<P>
The new study is in line with forecasts from First Interstate Bank and Chapman 
College, which also predict only moderate economic expansion in Orange County 
over the next several years. First Interstate, however, predicts a sharper drop 
in employment growth for next year. 
</P>
<P>
Wahed attributes much of the county's slowdown to lower growth in the national 
economy as a whole, which he said is tapped out after eight years of steady 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Lower defense spending will hit local aerospace manufacturers hard, and high 
costs will increasingly push some types of manufacturing out of the county and 
into cheaper areas such as San Bernardino and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate is another weak spot, with home resales and new home construction 
down significantly and office vacancy rates climbing. 
</P>
<P>
Housing prices have plateaued, and 1989 is likely to be the slowest year for 
housing construction since 1983, Wahed said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Wahed does not agree with some doomsayers who are predicting a crash in 
inflated housing markets throughout California. "People shouldn't be surprised 
if it slows and shouldn't confuse a slowdown with a collapse," Wahed said. 
</P>
<P>
And high housing prices will remain a difficulty for businesses that cannot 
find lower-wage workers. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the falloff in the county's economic performance is relative and should 
not mask the fact that it remains one of the most economically vibrant regions 
of the country, Wahed emphasized. While some manufacturers may be hurt by the 
drop in defense spending and weakness in some high-technology businesses, 
exports of electronics and precision machinery should help to take up the 
slack. 
</P>
<P>
And as the local economy matures, service industries will play an 
ever-more-important role in maintaining employment and income growth, Wahed 
noted. Service industry growth will be fueled by an exploding tourism industry 
and high demand for financial and other business services. 
</P>
<P>
Wahed also believes that Orange County and the national economy as a whole will 
also benefit from a continued fall in interest rates.

BECKMAN TO ISSUE $100 MILLION IN NOTES TO PAY OFF U.S. BANK DEBT 
</P>

Putting its newly acquired, high-grade commercial debt ratings to work, Beckman 
Instruments said Thursday that it plans to retire its long-term U.S. bank debt 
and replace it with cheaper money raised by selling corporate IOUs. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Wilson, Beckman vice president and treasurer, said company officials 
have authorized the sale of up to $100 million in commercial paper, an amount 
that should allow the company to pay off most of its domestic bank debt. 
</P>
<P>
He said the interest rate that the company will pay to purchasers of its 
commercial paper -- basically short-term, unsecured promissory notes -- is 
between one-quarter and one-third of a percentage point lower than the best 
interest rates Beckman can get from its banks. 
</P>
<P>
While those numbers seem small, the difference between paying 8% a year and 
7.75% a year on $90 million in debt is $225,000. 
</P>
<P>
The first corporate paper, to raise between $50 million and $60 million, will 
be issued today, Wilson said. Goldman Sachs is underwriting the issue. Wilson 
said Beckman is able to issue paper at lower interest rates than banks charge 
because of its high-quality credit ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's assigned Beckman an A-1 commercial paper rating last week 
-- the highest it awards. And Moody's Investment Service gave the company a 
mid-level Prime-2 rating earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
The ratings qualify the commercial paper as investment grade and show that both 
credit rating services believe Beckman is in good financial shape and unlikely 
to have problems repaying its debt. 
</P>
<P>
Beckman, which merged with SmithKline Corp. in 1982, became an independent 
public company again in July. 
</P>
<P>
The company is an international manufacturer and marketer of scientific 
instruments, analytical systems and related products for the fields of 
life-sciences research and clinical diagnostics.

WESTAIR ADDS 7 FLIGHTS FROM JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT

WestAir Commuter Airlines said Thursday that it will add seven flights to its 
schedule at John Wayne Airport beginning Dec. 1. The new flights will expand 
its service to Sacramento, Oakland, Fresno and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno-based WestAir, which currently flies 12 daily round-trips from Orange 
County as United Express, said it added the flights because its annual 
passenger allocation at John Wayne Airport for the fiscal year ended March 31, 
1990, has been boosted 46.6%, to 121,660 from 82,994. 
</P>
<P>
The new allocation gives WestAir almost 61% of the 200,000 passengers that the 
five commuter airlines now serving John Wayne Airport are allowed to carry each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
WestAir said that its new schedule will add one daily round trip to Sacramento 
and to Fresno, two to Los Angeles and three to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
WestAir, which uses 19- and 30-passenger turboprop planes, now flies three 
round-trips to each city from Orange County.

 Scantron Corp. of Tustin, a subsidiary of John H. Harland Co., has won a 
patent infringement suit against Associated Business Products of Santa Rosa. 
The suit, filed March 3 in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, charged that 
ABP improperly used Scantron's optical scanner devices. The court entered a 
consent judgment in Scantron's favor that permanently restrains Associated 
Business Products from any further unauthorized use, printing or sale of 
Scantron's patented forms.

The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Nui Ngu, 10528 McFadden Ave., Garden Grove. (714) 775-1108. Open Tuesdays 
through Thursdays and on Sundays from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays 
till 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Pagolac, 14564 Brookhurst St., Westminster. (714) 531-4740. Open Tuesdays 
through Sundays from noon to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Saigon is always an arresting place to browse when in the mood for 
adventurous, inexpensive dining. Nui Ngu, in a misbegotten strip mall on 
McFadden Avenue, specializes in the wonderfully obscure cuisine of Hue, in 
central Vietnam. Bun bo Hue, a peppery beef noodle soup, and banh bot loc, 
sticky tapioca flour dumplings, are unforgettable. At Pagolac you can 
experience a phenomenon known as bo bay mon, literally "seven courses of beef." 
The Vietnamese are mad for it. Unload a truck before you go. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bagatta, 3012 Newport Blvd., Newport Beach. (714) 675-4020. Open Mondays 
through Thursdays from 6 to 11 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till midnight. 
Sundays from 5 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The early returns show Bagatta out to a healthy lead in the Newport Beach 
Italian restaurant sweepstakes. It's a terrific addition to the local dining 
scene. Chef Andrea Rogantini brings heavyweight experience to the kitchen. 
Owner Tony Bagatta makes a charming host. Such dishes as salmon carpaccio, 
latticed with a moss green pesto sauce, and dry cured bresaola make spectacular 
beginnings. Pastas are beautifully textured. Desserts, such as zucotto and 
homemade spumoni, are otherworldly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sapori, 1080 Bayside Drive., Newport Beach. (714) 644-4220. Open daily from 
11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., weekends until 11 p.m.. 
</P>
<P>
Sapori is a modish, elegant neighborhood trattoria where the cooking is 
serious. Chefs Adriano and Franco Maniacci hail from Palermo, Sicily, but play 
no favorites with regard to the many regions of Italan cuisine. Bruschetta di 
pane Saracena, triangles of roasted wheat bread with a garlic puree, are 
delightful, and many pastas come blanketed in savory sauces. Suprema di rombo, 
turbot in a leek and watercress sauce, pays homage to nouvelle. Veal Milanese 
is the best you'll find anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kitayama, 101 Bayview Pl., Newport Beach. (714) 725-0777. Open Mondays through 
Fridays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., daily from 6 p.m. to 10:30. 
</P>
<P>
Kitayama, the first really serious Japanese restaurant in Orange County, is an 
exquisite addition to the local dining scene. You'll think you've wandered into 
a Buddhist temple -- until you taste the delicate, sophisticated cuisine of 
Yoshio Shirai and his team of chefs. The sho-ka-do lunch is the most beautiful 
$14 meal anywhere, and the omakase kaiseki, a multi-course feast at $50 per 
person is unforgettable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Five Feet Too, in Fashion Island, 1145 Newport Center Drive, Newport Beach. 
(714) 640-5250. Open daily from 11:30 a.m. to midnight. 
</P>
<P>
The gentrification of Chinese cuisine reaches new heights of absurdity in this 
self-consciously chic restaurant, the second effort of owner chef Michael Kang. 
The restaurant is visually stunning but often comes up short in the taste 
department: Many dishes are precious and ill conceived. The signature 
deep-fried catfish is excellent, and some imaginative dishes work well. Curried 
beef spring rolls are delightful. Kung pao three, with chicken, scallops and 
shrimp, is too. Desserts also are fine. Pity they don't serve humble pie. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Towers, in the Surf and Sand Hotel, 155 S. Coast Highway, Laguna Beach. 
(714) 497-4477. Open daily for breakfast and lunch; dinner from 5:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a task to upstage the commanding sweep of the California coastline at The 
Towers, a Laguna Beach restaurant perched atop a beachfront hotel. New 
executive chef Jackson Kenworth tries his mightiest. He came from Citrus in Los 
Angeles, and shows his mettle in a variety of dishes. Home cured salmon is a 
delight, served in bite-size nubs. Sea scallops in a citruslike potato risotto 
are sensational. Warm short-rib terrine with vegetables in a mustard 
vinaigrette is as original as they come. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Capers, 34150 Coast Highway, Dana Point. (714) 661-3983. Open daily 11:30 a.m. 
to 2:30 p.m., 5 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 A bright new seafood restaurant occupying the site of the former Dana Trader, 
Capers has a beachy, casual air well suited to the location. The food isn't 
half bad when the kitchen plays it straight, but the kitchen tries too hard to 
be creative, often with disastrous results. There is a noble, garlicky Caesar, 
not for wimps, some fair broiled fish and several good shrimp dishes. Be wary 
of the ill-conceived attempts at nouvelle, especially anything with the horrid 
lime dipping sauce, coconut batter -- or capers, the restaurant's signature 
condiment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ten Hu, 315 S. Magnolia Ave., Anaheim. (714) 826-9910. Open Tuesdays through 
Thursdays and Sundays 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 10. 
</P>
<P>
Ten Hu doesn't compare with Chinese restaurants in Chinatown or the San Gabriel 
Valley, but that shouldn't put you off a visit. Just remember that the steamed 
fish might be frozen. Winter melon soup with shredded chicken is a masterwork, 
and the Sichuan shrimps are particularly fine. It's primarily a seafood 
restaurant but you may do just as well with the non-seafood items, such as the 
Peking spareribs or the mouth watering rice noodle dishes. Stay away from the 
retro-Chinese standbys like chop suey and egg foo young. They're awful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Pleasant Peasant, 4251 Martingale Way, Newport Beach. (714) 955-2755. Open 
Mondays through Fridays 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Mondays through Thursdays 5:30 
p.m. to 9 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 10. 
</P>
<P>
La Brasserie, 202 S. Main St., Orange. (714) 978-6161. Open Mondays through 
Fridays 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Mondays through Saturdays 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Country French cuisine has a huge audience, but many of the restaurants 
advertising it end up serving much fancier dishes instead. (They can charge 
more that way.) The Pleasant Peasant is reasonably priced, with both soup and 
salad included in the price of main courses. Stick to lamb and anything without 
sauce here. La Brasserie is a lot pricier but also considerably more 
accomplished. The coq au vin rouge is terrific, as is a wonderful homemade 
chicken liver mousse in aspic. Good desserts and plenty of romance here too. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Salud, 17401 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. (714) 842-1194. Open Sundays 
through Thursdays 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Salud, a new high concept Mexican restaurant from Larry Cano, has an 
outlandish design that looks like a set Roger Corman might have used for a 
movie on Aztec discomania. All the trendy Mexican buttons are pushed: hand 
shaken margaritas, 80's chiles, blue corn. Avoid the usualMeximush and head for 
soups, grilled meats and desserts. Pozole verde is hominy and shredded chicken 
in broth, and it's great. So is Ibarra chocolate bread pudding, little cubes of 
fudge soaked bread in a tequila orange cream sauce. Prices are reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mongkut Thai, 212 Avenida del Mar, San Clemente. (714) 492-3871. 31976 S. Coast 
Highway, South Laguna. (714) 499-2100. Open Mondays through Saturdays, 11 a.m. 
to 3 p.m., and nightly 5 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 As well as being one of the current nicknames for Thailand, "Land of Smiles" 
could describe the type of service you can expect at the often exotic, 
occasionally bland Mongkut Thai restaurants where smiles substitute for 
intelligible English. Dishes get such flowery names as Glittering Coastal Onyx 
(sauced calamari) or Garnet Ocean Field (crab fried rice) on one of the most 
uniquely written menus anywhere, and they can be blistering hot. Curries like 
mussuman (beef) or an oily, flavorless chicken curry tend to disappoint, but 
most of the fare is exuberant and flavorful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Z Pizza, 30902 Pacific Coast Highway, South Laguna. (714) 499-4949. Open daily 
from 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
7th Heaven, 3333 Bear St. in the Crystal Court, Costa Mesa. (714) 668- 9464. 
Open Mondays through Fridays 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., Saturdays 9 to 6, Sundays 10 to 
6. 
</P>
<P>
Z Pizza serves eccentric, internationally accented pizzas that have plenty of 
flash and flavors. Particularly engaging is a Moroccan style pizza with 
eggplant and pine nuts, and the Pissaladiere Nicoise, a cheeseless pie with 
anchovies and Provencal herbs. The chewy, fragrant crusts are mini-masterpieces 
all by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
7th Heaven is a movable feast, a full-blown urban takeout emporium for grown-up 
tastes. Don't miss such specialties as Chinese lacquered chicken, jalapeno corn 
pudding or a dazzling array of trendy salads. There are abundant pastes and 
cheeses for the picnic basket. Desserts like bread pudding and rich chocolate 
cookies are terrific.

'CAMELOT' SQUEEZES WELL INTO A LITTLE THEATER

HUNTINGTON BEACH

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The proper expectations are the key to enjoying the Huntington Beach 
Playhouse's "Camelot." 
</P>
<P>
Like many of its counterparts throughout Orange County, the playhouse is a 
little theater with a small budget. Anyone who goes to the production expecting 
visual grandeur -- the type of lavish, magical staging usually associated with 
Lerner and Loewe's recasting of the King Arthur legend -- are apt to be 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
Director Marla Gam-Hudson takes something of a minimalist approach to the 1960 
musical, with varying results. The sets by Randimar Productions are very 
simple, and Laurel Koelsch's and Terri Miller-Schmidt's costumes range from 
professional to homemade (Lancelot's "armor" amounts to gray spandex tights and 
what looks like molded cardboard painted silver). The overall appearance is 
frugal utilitarian. 
</P>
<P>
But if you can accept the economical aura, there are moments to enjoy. For 
sure, the production does have its clumsy patches, but the principals (Mike 
Moon as Arthur and Robin Follman as Guinevere) are both able. Follman is 
especially strong -- this veteran of Opera Pacific and the Master Chorale of 
Orange County has a rich voice and an often vivid acting style. 
</P>
<P>
Her Guinevere is a naive but juicy young thing when she arrives, already 
promised as Arthur's bride. She's a girl with womanly feelings, often 
impulsive, even wanton, that signal the passionate trouble she later gets into 
when the chaste Lancelot (Mike Thompson) arrives. Follman does equally well on 
the frothy "The Lusty Month of May" and the deeper "I Loved You Once in 
Silence." 
</P>
<P>
There's no way for Moon to match Follman's singing skills, but he does have one 
of those pleasant, music-hall voices that never lacks personality. His acting 
is also ripe with the stuff. His Arthur fails at being a romantic, regal figure 
-- Moon goes for the overgrown boy in the man almost every time -- but his king 
is likable. 
</P>
<P>
Gam-Hudson tries to compensate for the production's minor-key looks by bringing 
a courtly touch to a few crucial scenes. This amounts to having the large cast 
parade through the aisles and, in effect, use the entire theater as a stage. 
Unfortunately, while it does impart a sense of expanse to the proceedings, it 
makes everything too busy. 
</P>
<P>
The show is faithful to the musical's original intent on most scores, but 
Gam-Hudson does play around with the sorceress Morgan Le Fey. Here, Terri 
Miller-Schmidt turns her into a kicky vision of witchful kinkiness, emerging 
from the woods in black leather and chains, and brandishing a nasty little 
whip. 
</P>

FREAKED-OUT FLIERS FIND THERE'S HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

County Life.

<TEXT>
<P>
Dana Mendenhall has a problem. She has a chance to vacation in the Bahamas, but 
she hasn't been able to set foot on an airplane in 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to fly everywhere, and then one day we'd gotten on a plane in Las Vegas 
to fly back to Orange County, and I had a panic attack," said Mendenhall, 45, 
of Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I remember is standing up screaming, 'I've got to get off this 
plane.' They turned around and went back to the gate. I haven't flown since." 
</P>
<P>
But determined at long last to conquer her fear of flying, Mendenhall joined a 
small group of other similarly afflicted folk one recent evening in the 
classroom of a flight school at John Wayne Airport. Instrument panel mock-ups 
graced the walls. The noise of jets roaring into the air drifted in through the 
door. 
</P>
<P>
Mendenhall and eight others sat grim-faced, their heads nodding rapidly in 
recognition as the various flying fears were listed on a chart. 
</P>
<P>
Fear of takeoffs. Of turbulence. Of claustrophobia. Of panicking. Of being 
embarrassed. Of dying. 
</P>
<P>
The long list complete, seminar leader Glen Arnold set to work reassuring the 
fearful travelers that it's OK to be freaked out by flying. 
</P>
<P>
"A Gallup poll found that half of all Americans express some concern about 
flying. None of us chooses to have problems. They just arrive on our doorstep," 
Arnold says. 
</P>
<P>
For 12 years, Arnold has been helping fliers send their fears packing. A pilot 
and clinical social worker, Arnold, 47, founded Thairapy flight relaxation 
training service in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"People knew I was a therapist and involved with aviation, and they kept asking 
me for advice on dealing with their flying problems, so I decided to give it 
more formally." 
</P>
<P>
Arnold, who also is on the counseling staff at UCI Medical Center, has Thairapy 
offices in Newport Beach and Santa Monica. He holds three-hour seminars, such 
as the recent one at John Wayne Airport, as well as group and individual 
therapy sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold said his goal is to get people to at least tolerate flying, if not enjoy 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people use the New York subway, and they don't feel they have to 
enjoy the experience." 
</P>
<P>
Arnold led the seminar participants in a discussion of why some people fear 
flying. 
</P>
<P>
"Flying, first of all, is vividly three-dimensional. We live in pretty much a 
two-dimensional world -- all our other transportation is forward and back, side 
to side. In a plane you experience very intense up and down sensations." 
</P>
<P>
Arnold said that most people with flying problems had parents with similar 
phobias. Children can either learn their fears or acquire the inclination 
toward them through heredity. 
</P>
<P>
For others, he said, "their experiences have made them view flying as 
dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Anita Berresse, 49, of El Toro said she knows exactly when and why her fear 
began. 
</P>
<P>
"Jan. 6, 1988, on a flight from Dallas to Detroit. One of the engines exploded 
right after takeoff. I sat there frozen with fear. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I feel that when I get on a plane, I'm relinquishing all control. I'm 
handing somebody my life." 
</P>
<P>
She flies about six times a year, but each flight is filled with the terror of 
waiting for something to happen. 
</P>
<P>
"On my last flight I talked to myself all through the turbulence. You don't 
want to be on a plane with me." 
</P>
<P>
The way to begin dealing with flying fear, no matter what its origin, Arnold 
said, is to identify the most troublesome part of the flight and realize that 
usually it accounts for a very small part of an hours-long journey. Takeoffs, 
for instance, last only 40 seconds. Turbulence may last only a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"If you figure out which part bothers you the most, you already have a much 
greater sense of control and are able to manage the rest of the flight much 
more smoothly." 
</P>
<P>
Once the main source of fear is identified, Arnold recommends attacking it with 
the following four-pronged strategy, setting a goal of small improvement with 
each flight: 
</P>
<P>
* Relaxation. Arnold suggested deep-breathing and visualization techniques for 
getting in a relaxed frame of mind before the troubling part of the flight. 
"Imagine yourself in some restful, peaceful place with the sun soaking into 
your body." 
</P>
<P>
* Mental armor. Think positively, Arnold said. "Welcome the takeoff or 
turbulence or whatever. Tell yourself, 'I'm here to learn. This is an outdoor 
laboratory.' That's the attitude you need." 
</P>
<P>
If that resolve begins to crumble, use various sensual distraction techniques, 
he suggested, such as applying a drop of perfume to a shirt cuff, turning up 
the volume on the audio headset or chewing on something crunchy. Arnold 
provided the seminar participants with a list of 32 anxiety-reducing ploys. 
</P>
<P>
* Nutrition. For 12 to 24 hours before a flight, minimize or eliminate foods 
that interfere with relaxation, Arnold said. The main offenders are sugar, 
caffeine, alcohol and nicotine. 
</P>
<P>
The most common mistake anxious fliers make is using alcohol, he said. 
"Eighty-five percent of people with flying problems are hindered by the use of 
alcohol. It actually heightens their anxiety." 
</P>
<P>
* Knowledge of aircraft operations. "Air takes a bad rap," Arnold said. "We 
can't see it, so we think there's nothing between us and the ground. But there 
is great power in the air." 
</P>
<P>
One woman in the group said she panics when she thinks that there are too many 
people on one side of the plane and fears the plane will flip over. 
</P>
<P>
"We forget how long the wings of a plane are and the tremendous upward pressure 
exerted on the wings. It really makes no difference where people are standing 
in the cabin. The plane can't keel over from a shift in weight." 
</P>
<P>
The more fliers know about airplanes the more secure they should feel, Arnold 
said. It helps to know not only the statistical safety record ("Driving is 25 
times more dangerous than flying to the same destination," Arnold says), but 
also why and how the plane flies. 
</P>
<P>
"A plane on the ground is kind of an ungainly thing, rolling around on its 
little wheels. But in the air it's where it was designed to be, operating in 
every sort of weather in all parts of the world," Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate his fear-reducing strategy, Arnold led the group through a 
discussion of how to cope with turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
"Expect it. Ten percent of flying time will be mildly or moderately turbulent. 
We try to use magic. We tell ourselves if we do this or that anxious behavior 
then maybe we'll be spared. And then when we're not, we can't deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
Accepting that turbulence will occur is a major part of handling it. 
</P>
<P>
Keep seat belts tightly fastened during turbulence, Arnold said. "People make 
the mistake of keeping their belts too loose in turbulence. Your body can then 
bounce around worse than it has to and make the sensation worse." 
</P>
<P>
Arnold said many fliers have had success relaxing during turbulence by 
visualizing themselves as Jell-O, gently yielding to the forces at work on the 
plane. "The more you tighten your muscles and clutch things, the more you 
exaggerate the effect of turbulence. If your body is relaxed, you will feel 
relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Hjeltness, 47, of La Mesa in San Diego County, said Arnold's words about 
the physics of flight made a big impression on her. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll think more about the idea of flying in an ocean of air and how the plane 
is operating in its own environment. I do well when I'm in my environment, so 
the plane will do the same. I'll trust that," said Hjeltness, who sported an "I 
Love to Fly" button in a bit of positive thinking. 
</P>
<P>
But, just in case, she still has a coping repertoire of her own to fall back 
on: 
</P>
<P>
"I try to find someone to talk to more scared than I am. Makes me feel better." 
</P>

FLIRTY DANCING;

WHEN LEARNING SCOTTISH COUNTRY STEPS, THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE TO MEET AND NO 
TIME TO BE BORED

Robert Jacobs of Costa Mesa, 41, likes the flirtatiousness of Scottish country 
dancing. Apparently it works -- he met and wooed his wife, Carolyn Alexandra 
Jacobs, 23, while enjoying the intricate figures and fancy footwork of this 
centuries-old dance. They were married in July. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very flirtatious form of dancing. You're supposed to have lots of eye 
contact," says Robert Jacobs, looking rather romantic and dashing in an 
old-fashioned muslin shirt, fancy knee socks and a traditional kilt. 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing staid and somber about Scottish country dancing, which has 
spread to wherever Scots have settled. The Orange County chapter of the Royal 
Scottish Country Dance Society has more than 60 members, and Monday through 
Thursday evenings you can always find a class somewhere in the county. (For 
information on the society's dances, call Dorothy Hodges, (714) 842-7650.) 
</P>
<P>
The dancers slip on their "ghillies" -- soft leather shoes similar to ballet 
shoes -- and practice steps and figures from the hundreds of dances that fill 
the official 35 books of Scottish country dance. 
</P>
<P>
You don't have to be Scottish to join in the fun, though many members are 
Scots. You don't even have to have a partner because there's usually someone 
available to dance with. 
</P>
<P>
The figures are complicated and take awhile to learn, but novices are welcome 
and are cheerfully nudged into place by more experienced dancers. It generally 
takes one or two years to even begin to master the technique, but the dancing 
is just part of the fun. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Orange County group revel in the chance to make new friends. 
Many have become good friends with dancers from neighboring chapters in San 
Gabriel Valley, Los Angeles and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
And the Jacobses' marriage is just one of several in Orange County inspired by 
Scottish country dancing. In fact, the Orange County chapter of the Royal 
Scottish Country Dance Society recently issued a booklet, "The Plighted Troth," 
which contains special dances written in honor of members' marriages. 
</P>
<P>
"The Plighted Troth" was named for a dance created for Bob Patterson of Tustin, 
51, and his wife, Rene Boblette, 36. The two met while dancing and now teach a 
class for beginning, intermediate and advanced Scottish country dance students 
Thursday evenings at Edison Community Center in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"The McUffda Strathspey" is a dance created for Pete Anderson and his wife, 
Anne-Line Anderson, of Irvine, and it is done to music with a Scandinavian 
flavor. The Andersons, both of Norwegian ancestry, met at a Scottish dance in 
Monterey, and he says "it was love at first sight." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who will admit only to "pushing 50" and says his wife is in her 
"mid-40s," even has a license plate that reads MCUFFDA. Uffda is a Norwegian 
expression with a meaning considerably stronger than "Oh, heck." The Strathspey 
is a slow, courtly step featured in many of the dances. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent dance, Anderson showed his mixed allegiance by wearing an outfit 
that included a kilt and a Viking helmet. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a real time. It's not a sober sort of thing," says Dorothy Craik with 
a laugh and a charming Scottish accent. Craik, who started dancing in her 
native Scotland when she was 7, declines to give her age, but fellow members 
say she is over 80. She says people her age are relegated to the dancing 
sidelines in Scotland. "They tell ya to set in a corner," she says. But she's 
delighted that "here everyone joins in." 
</P>
<P>
"You always need classes," says Craik of Garden Grove, who dances weekly. "You 
have to keep up with the newer dances." 
</P>
<P>
Parts of Scottish country dancing, usually done in sets of four couples, may 
look familiar. Certain moves are reminiscent of a do-si-do or a "promenade," 
and the formation of four couples facing each other is similar to the Virginia 
reel. But Scottish country dancing came first. 
</P>
<P>
Square dancing borrowed many moves from Scottish country dance and some other 
types of folk dancing, according to Patterson, who first learned Scottish 
dancing at monthly grange dances as a boy in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Scottish country dancing's footwork, however, is different from square dancing 
because the Scots in the 18th Century began borrowing movements from French 
ballet. 
</P>
<P>
"And so the French ballet is modified into court dancing, and court dancing 
then became modified into ballroom dancing in Scotland," Patterson explains, 
and ballroom dancing became Scottish country dancing. 
</P>
<P>
That accounts for the proper form of country dancing in which dancers are 
supposed to move lightly on the balls of their feet with toes pointed. However 
that form isn't required at socials or in class because some people can't 
manage it. 
</P>
<P>
Scottish country dancing does not have a caller shouting out the steps. 
However, each dance has a lead tune experienced dancers will recognize. A 
master of ceremonies may briefly explain what moves a dance includes before the 
music starts, but it's up to each dancer to know them and keep up. 
</P>
<P>
Scottish country dancing also shares some steps with highland dancing, but 
without requiring the same lift and elevation. Some dancers are proficient at 
both forms, and some Scottish country dancers are former highland dancers whose 
knees no longer can take the punishment of the more demanding dance, Patterson 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Scottish country dancing is a good aerobic exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Judy Hess of San Clemente. In six months of attending classes twice a 
week and socials once a month, Hess, 38, has lost 17 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you ever seen a jogger smile?" asks Patterson, who is a psychologist. 
"Well this is a form of exercise where you get to hold hands with people. It's 
social. You get to communicate . . . watch people smile. They're having fun. 
They enjoy it."

Wilhelmina Van Hunnick, a teacher at Kennedy High School, is a teacher in 
pursuit of excellence, one who tries to nurture the character of her students. 
As a result, she has gained the admiration of many. She was recently chosen as 
one of four Orange County teachers to compete for the statewide title of 
Teacher of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel being chosen is a great honor, not only for me, but for all the 
teachers at Kennedy," said Van Hunnick, who has taught for 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
The business teacher said she sets high standards, tries to provide a strong 
role model and reinforces a reverence for education, thus giving every one of 
her students -- regardless of his or her ability -- the opportunity to achieve 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
"Every student can work to his or her ability and is not satisfied until his 
best is done," Van Hunnick said. "With all the programs for the GATE-identified 
(Gifted and Talented Education) and special education students, the 'average' 
students get lost in the shuffle." 
</P>
<P>
Van Hunnick divides her school day between four computer application classes 
and one typing/word-processing class. 
</P>
<P>
"She tries her hardest to help her students," said senior Allen Gipson, one of 
Van Hunnick's computer students. "She's helped me by setting up special 
computers since I'm in a wheelchair." 
</P>
<P>
Van Hunnick also spends a lot of time with students outside the classroom. She 
advises the school's Future Business Leaders of America club, a student 
organization that stresses business skills and leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"I attract average students through FBLA," she said. "Average kids as well as 
GATE students can excel and earn recognition." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy Principal Warren Stephenson said: "Willie is a very strong, 
hard-working individual. She cares about her students. She has an ability to 
make them work for her. They absorb her excitement and, in return, she gets 
positive results."

POPULAR TEACHER BELIEVES 'DISCOVERY' IS THE CRUX OF EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG AMROFELL, Greg Amrofell is a junior at Foothill High School, where he 
is the production assignment editor for the student newspaper, Knightlife, and 
student body vice president.

<P>
Lisa Roseman, the theater arts and film teacher at Tustin High School, believes 
education is not about results but about "discovery." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, her teaching philosophy revolves around the concept of discovery. 
</P>
<P>
"I was explaining to a kid how to give jokes the proper timing and how to play 
off an audience's reaction," Roseman said. "Then I saw him do it and there was 
this 'aha' and an intake of breath. I knew that he had achieved insight, and 
insight is the springboard for discovery." 
</P>
<P>
Roseman is one of two Orange County high school teachers who, along with one 
elementary and one intermediate teacher from the county, have been chosen to 
compete for the statewide title of Teacher of the Year. Her fellow nominees are 
Wilhelmina Van Hunnick, who teaches business classes at Kennedy High School in 
La Palma; Carolyn Alex, a first-grade teacher at Hoover Elementary School in 
Santa Ana, and Michele Rosenblum, who teaches social studies, English and drama 
at Rancho San Joaquin Intermediate School in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The four were chosen from 28 teachers nominated by the county's school 
districts. They will compete against 60 other nominees for the state title. 
</P>
<P>
Roseman has taught for 20 years -- 16 of them at Tustin High. She thinks her 
selection was based on her ideas about the state of education and the way she 
believes her individual teaching style, curriculum and philosophy can improve 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Within Roseman's concept of discovery lies a spirit that can be seen in the 
eyes of her students when they talk of their teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"You can tell her anything, and you know it's in the strictest confidence," 
senior Inge Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
Being "weird," as she calls herself, has been an advantage for Roseman, who 
strives to make students feel good about themselves. She isn't afraid to go out 
on a limb to make everyone else feel comfortable about doing the same. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not afraid to make a fool of myself in order to create a safe environment 
to experiment with ideas without a loss of self-esteem," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It's working. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Tustin's advanced drama class researched, wrote, produced, 
copyrighted, published and performed a full-length play entitled "Somebody to 
Love," which explores teen-agers' problems such as drugs, suicide, divorce, 
pregnancy and dating. Their script was based on the experiences of people they 
interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Its performance led to an awakening in the community. "The parents were amazed; 
the kids were amazed," said Roseman, who noted that the source of the 
bewilderment was the play's message: "You're not alone . . . and talking 
helps." 
</P>
<P>
The students thought that taking the play to as many students as possible might 
help others. Their first step was to perform at the local junior high schools 
where, they believed, many of these problems first take root. 
</P>
<P>
Their work didn't go unnoticed. "Somebody to Love" won honors last year as the 
Orange County Department of Education's best drama and was called the best play 
at the Cal State Long Beach Theatre Festival. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Roseman and the Tustin High theater arts program also received the 
California School Board Assn.'s Golden Bell Award for excellence in theater 
arts/film curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
How big a role does Roseman take in all this? She describes herself as a 
facilitator. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids are so creative," she said. "In drama, I teach them the tools to use 
creativity. From there, it's up to them." 
</P>
<P>
She has employed unusual assignments such as student-directed films and the 
mentoring of lower-level drama students by advanced ones -- things that 
challenge teen-agers to do more than just recall information. 
</P>
<P>
Roseman sees acting as "relevant" for any student of any ability. "It teaches 
poise, group leadership and practical skills," she said. The development of 
"contributing and worthwhile human beings," not necessarily good actors, is 
Roseman's goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to cultivate in my students a strong sense of self -- of who they are, 
what their creative abilities are and how they can use them. I want them to 
know that they have the power to affect change, to grasp their dreams and to 
make them a reality." 
</P>
<P>
What may distinguish Roseman from others in her profession is that she openly 
and actively engages herself in personal discovery with her students. She says 
her students -- in gifted, disabled and English-as-a-second-language classes as 
well as theater arts -- have responded to her latest honor with pride. "They 
feel it's partly theirs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every kid is creative, but by me being enthusiastic, they become 
enthusiastic," said Roseman, adding that the only true end result is discovery. 
"It's the most exciting thing in the world -- to be changing the future."

The Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant was shut down today because a mechanism 
that regulates voltage emissions began to spark and threatened to cause a fire. 
</P>
<P>
The incident, which occurred at 7:03 a.m., was said to pose no threat of 
radioactive leakage, but California Department of Forestry firefighters were 
called to the scene in case of a fire. 
</P>
<P>
The incident was classified an "unusual event," which is the lowest-level plant 
emergency. Event determinations are made when outside help is called in. Plant 
officials must notify the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and San Luis Obispo 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, which operates Diablo Canyon, will keep the plant 
closed for an undetermined amount of time while an investigation is conducted.

The Supreme Court of the Philippines today narrowly rejected a petition to let 
the family of Ferdinand E. Marcos bring his body home for burial, ruling 8-7 
that the ousted president is still a threat to national security. 
</P>
<P>
President Corazon Aquino, who was swept to power in a 1986 popular revolt that 
ended Marcos' 20-year rule, immediately welcomed the court's decision and 
called for unity. 
</P>
<P>
But 5,000 Marcos supporters marching from his hometown in the north of the 
country to Manila to pressure Aquino to reverse her ban issued a manifesto 
calling her heartless and attacking corruption and the government's failure to 
stem the country's Communist insurgency. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos, who died in exile in Hawaii on Sept. 28, has been interred temporarily 
in Honolulu. But supporters had petitioned the court to allow his family to 
bury him in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Noting the court's split decision, Aquino's estranged Vice President Salvador 
Laurel said it was unfortunate that even the Supreme Court was divided on the 
issue of Marcos' return.

BUSH, IN COSTA RICA, SEES SWEEP OF DEMOCRACY

<P>
SAN JOSE, Costa Rica 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush hailed "the sweep of democracy through the hemisphere" as he 
joined Latin American leaders today for talks about drug trafficking, foreign 
debt and political strife. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Bush's arrival from Washington for a two-day celebration of Costa 
Rica's 100 years of democracy, Panama's military government was sniping at the 
United States from afar, and Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega was castigating 
Bush for refusing to meet with him. 
</P>
<P>
Bush did not mention either Panama or Nicaragua when he stepped off his plane 
but he won applause at a welcoming ceremony when he declared: "I believe we can 
create here in the Americas the world's first completely democratic 
hemisphere." 
</P>
<P>
Ortega sat at least half a dozen seats away from Bush as the 17 hemispheric 
leaders began their first working session this afternoon at a resort hotel 
outside San Jose. Each was introduced to rounds of applause, and their 
deliberations at a long table were broadcast live on national television. 
</P>
<P>
At the airport, Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez announced a tentative 
agreement that will allow his country to reduce its $4.5-billion foreign debt 
burden by $1 billion. He said the agreement would reduce debt service by 
two-thirds. 
</P>
<P>
Arias gave no further details but profusely thanked the United States for its 
help in achieving "the best gift we could possibly make to future generations 
of Costa Ricans." 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Arias shook hands and then embraced each other with hearty hugs. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving ahead of Bush, Ortega told reporters that he hopes the meeting will be 
the first step toward talks between North and South America. "Without 
confronting the problems of the economy, commerce and the rights of nations to 
live in peace, democracy is at risk throughout Central America," Ortega said. 
</P>
<P>
Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega wasn't invited to the summit. But 
in advertisements placed in San Jose's major newspapers, provisional Panamanian 
President Francisco Rodriguez told the leaders that democracy in Panama 
couldn't be considered without also discussing U.S. economic and political 
pressure.

BUSH VETOES A SECOND BILL ALLOWING ABORTION FUNDS; 
</P>

D.C. WOMEN WILL GET NO U.S. MONEY

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush today vetoed a $4-billion bill for the District of Columbia that 
would have allowed local funds to be used to pay for abortions. 
</P>
<P>
It was Bush's second veto of abortion-related legislation in the last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I informed Congress earlier that I would veto this bill if it contained funds 
to pay for abortion," Bush said in a statement handed to reporters as Air Force 
One landed in Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, regrettably, the Congress has expanded the circumstances under 
which federal funds could be used to pay for abortion," Bush said. "I am 
therefore compelled to disapprove (the District of Columbia appropriation)." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Bush vetoed the $156.7-billion spending bill for the departments 
of Health and Human Services, Labor and Education because that bill allowed the 
use of federal money to pay for abortions of poor victims of rape and incest. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has supported abortions in such cases but opposes any change in the 
current law that bars federal funds for abortions except in cases where the 
life of the mother is endangered by the pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
House supporters of the HHS bill failed in their effort Wednesday to override 
the veto. They won a majority of votes but not the two-thirds majority needed 
to pass the bill over the President's objections. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion-rights supporters are not expected to be able to override the veto of 
the district bill, and both appropriations bills will have to be reworked by 
House and Senate Appropriations committees. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's action was immediately denounced by supporters of legal abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action 
League, said Bush has an "extremist ideology" and showed "callous disregard for 
the health and well-being of poor and vulnerable women in crisis pregnancies." 
</P>
<P>
"Today's veto is one more attempt by an out-of-touch Administration to allow 
politicians to interfere in intensely private decisions about abortion," she 
said, predicting the Administration's stance would hurt Republican candidates 
in upcoming elections. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Faucher, director of the National Right to Life political action 
committee, said the group was pleased with Bush's action but she dismissed 
critics of the President who she said should not act as if they were surprised 
by the veto. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Brock Adams (D-Wash.) said that in vetoing the abortion funds, Bush also 
vetoed an anti-drug bill for the district because the catchall measure

it is worse off than it was before."

A 32-year-old man and his 51-year-old former girlfriend were in critical 
condition today after he shot her and turned the gun on himself Thursday night 
in the bar of an Anaheim restaurant, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The man, whose name was being withheld until his relatives could be notified, 
and the woman, Mary Louise Cutbirth of Fullerton, were lying on the floor of 
the bar at the Foxfire Restaurant on Santa Ana Canyon Road when officers 
arrived.

Witnesses said the couple had been quietly chatting at the bar when -- for no 
apparent reason -- the man pulled a small-caliber handgun and shot Cutbirth in 
the head, Anaheim police Sgt. George Robichaud said.

Then the man pointed the gun at his own head and pulled the trigger.

E. GERMANY GRANTS AMNESTY TO REFUGEES AND DEMONSTRATORS

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
East Germany today announced an amnesty for pro-democracy demonstrators and 
hundreds of thousands of refugees who fled to the West in recent weeks or were 
caught trying to escape since the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
The move was expected to free several thousand people from prison. 
</P>
<P>
East German dissidents praised the action in the wake of widespread civil 
unrest as an "important" step toward fulfilling promises of reform by the new 
government of Egon Krenz. 
</P>
<P>
In West Germany, however, officials were cautious, saying those pardoned should 
not have been considered criminals in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
The amnesty, announced by the official East German news agency ADN, was drawn 
up by the Council of State headed by Krenz, who replaced hard-line conservative 
Communist leader Erich Honecker last week. 
</P>
<P>
Krenz has promised to introduce reform in East Germany in the face of street 
protests -- and the exodus of more than 65,000 refugees to the West in recent 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the amnesty, all refugees who have fled to the West and 
those caught attempting to escape are pardoned, providing nonviolent methods 
were used to reach freedom. 
</P>
<P>
The decree makes it possible for refugees, once barred from East Germany, to 
return without fear of criminal prosecution. The amnesty also applies to 
everyone who fled East Germany since the Berlin Wall went up Aug. 13, 1961. 
</P>
<P>
"Also amnestied are people who before Oct. 27 committed criminal acts against 
public and state order in connection with demonstrations and meetings," an 
article of the decree said. 
</P>
<P>
But the decree said the amnesty will not cover people who had used or advocated 
violence, endangered the life or health of others, or had carried firearms or 
used violent methods to escape. 
</P>
<P>
The decree applies not only to the 670,000 East Germans who have fled to the 
West over the last 28 years, but also to those jailed for trying to flee across 
the wall or other barriers on the East-West border. 
</P>
<P>
Attempted escapes have been punished by prison terms ranging from two to eight 
years. After release those convicted of trying to flee are often severely 
discriminated against, making it difficult to find employment and apartments. 
</P>
<P>
The decree appeared aimed at not only appeasing the tens of thousands who 
demonstrate daily against the Communist government demanding reform but at 
inducing many of those 65,000 who recently fled to return home. The amnesty 
ends the main legal barrier blocking their return. 
</P>
<P>
The government already has said it will help them financially should they come 
back. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known exactly how many pro-democracy demonstrators would be covered 
by the amnesty. Thousands were arrested in protests Oct. 7-9 during the visit 
of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, before Krenz was placed in power and 
adopted a new policy of tolerance and non-interference. 
</P>
<P>
The new government has been trying to channel demands for reform into mass 
meetings at which government and Communist leaders appear.

TOURIST FOUND DEAD IN KENYA WAS MURDERED, COURT DECIDES

<P>
A British tourist whose charred bones were found in a game park was murdered, a 
court ruled today, vindicating her father's yearlong battle against state 
investigators who claimed that wild animals had killed her. 
</P>
<P>
The death of Julie Ward remains unsolved, however, with no one arrested and the 
judge's saying he saw no need for further investigation. Ward's father has 
charged that there was an official cover-up to protect Kenya's lucrative 
tourism industry. 
</P>
<P>
Ward's partly charred lower left leg and lower jaw were found Sept. 13, 1988, 
in the sprawling Masai Mara Game Reserve, a week after she reportedly left the 
world-renowned park while on a wildlife photography expedition. 
</P>
<P>
The state claimed that the 28-year-old woman was eaten by carnivores after 
abandoning her vehicle mired in mud. The Masai Mara is home to lions, vultures, 
hyenas and leopards among other meat eaters. 
</P>
<P>
Her father, John Ward, a hotelier from Suffolk, England, contended that she was 
murdered, hacked up and burned with gasoline. He pleaded with the state to 
order an inquest and spent tens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours 
in a private investigation of her death. 
</P>
<P>
"There is ample and substantial evidence that Julie Ward died of foul play by a 
person or persons unknown," Chief Magistrate Joseph Mango said at the 
conclusion of his inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
In rejecting the state's contention that Ward had been killed by animals, Mango 
said: "I think the animals are innocent. If they are guilty at all, it is in 
eating what they found."

The Senate today approved an $8.5-billion military construction bill that 
slashes President Bush's request for bases overseas but adds millions of 
dollars for domestic projects. 
</P>
<P>
By voice vote, the Senate adopted the legislation and sent it to Bush for his 
signature. 
</P>
<P>
The bill cuts military construction spending in fiscal 1990 by $461 million 
from what was spent during the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 and is $65 
million below what Bush wanted to spend this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've seen the peak of military construction spending for many years 
to come," said Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Appropriations 
subcommittee on military construction. "Next year may be even smaller than the 
bill here today."

5 COLOMBIAN POLICE KILLED IN MEDELLIN BUS BOMBING

A bomb exploded on a street in Medellin as a bus carrying policemen passed by, 
killing five officers and wounding 16, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Three more bombs exploded Thursday night and early today in the capital of 
Bogota, wounding one person, and another bomb in Bogota was deactivated 
Thursday night at a bank, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Also Thursday, two policemen assigned as guards to the Ecuadorean Consulate in 
Medellin were shot and killed as they tried to help another policeman make an 
arrest, police in the city said. They blamed street thugs and said the killers 
escaped. 
</P>
<P>
No one claimed responsibility for the bus attack late Thursday, but police 
blamed drug barons angered by the government's refusal to negotiate its policy 
of extraditing traffickers to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The traffickers are the only criminals with the means and the desire to carry 
out an attack of this size," said a police spokesman in Medellin, the center of 
Colombia's drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
In the two months since the government declared a war on traffickers and the 
drug lords responded with violent attacks, 169 bombings attributed to the 
traffickers have killed 21 people and injured 219. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb in Medellin, packing over 60 pounds of dynamite, was placed on a curb 
and detonated as the bus passed. National RCN radio said 44 officers were on 
the bus at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The driver and four others died in the explosion, which severely damaged the 
bus and sent it reeling out of control, the police spokesman said. Many of the 
16 injured were in critical condition, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The bus finally stopped when it smashed into a parked taxi, the spokesman said. 
The right side of the bus was riddled with shrapnel from the bomb, a Medellin 
police spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb was connected with electrical cable to a plunger two blocks away, the 
spokeswoman said. The vehicle was carrying police officers to their posts for 
night duty.

The Treasury Department said today it will borrow $17 billion on an emergency 
basis early next week so it can pay Social Security benefits to 38.9 million 
retirees and avert an unprecedented government default. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said the emergency borrowing will enable 
monthly Social Security checks to go out on schedule Nov. 3 regardless of 
whether Congress breaks a deadlock and passes an increase in the national debt 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) denounced the emergency 
action as "obviously a transparent political move to enhance the effort to get 
a capital-gains tax cut. There apparently is no limit to what they'll do" to 
reach that goal.

CONSUMER SPENDING UP A SKIMPY 0.2%;

ECONOMY: AMERICANS' INCOME GREW A LACKLUSTER 0.3% LAST MONTH. REPORT BLAMES

Consumer spending in September posted its weakest advance in a year, while 
Americans' personal income grew a lackluster 0.3%, the government said today in 
a report raising new concern about the health of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said consumer spending rose 0.2% last month. It was the 
most sluggish figure since September, 1988, when it fell 0.1%, and followed 
more robust increases of 0.9% in August and 0.8% in July. 
</P>
<P>
The income growth of 0.3% followed an identical advance in August and a 0.6% 
gain in July. 
</P>
<P>
The statistics on Americans' income growth and spending habits provided fresh 
evidence that the economy is continuing to slow. As measured by the gross 
national product, the economy grew at a moderate 2.5% in the July-September 
quarter, but few economists expect it to match that pace in the last three 
months of the year, with a handful saying the nation could slip into a 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
However, the government noted that Hurricane Hugo, which struck North and South 
Carolina in September, reduced personal income, with most of the decline coming 
in rental income. Without the storm, incomes would have risen twice as much, 
0.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, personal income in September totaled $4.47 trillion after a revised 
rate of $4.46 trillion a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Spending came in at an annual rate of $3.53 trillion after a revised $3.52 
trillion in August. 
</P>
<P>
The September report showed that Americans' income after taxes rose only 0.2%, 
down from the 0.3% gain in August. 
</P>
<P>
With income growing at the same rate as after-tax income, Americans' savings 
rate held steady at 4.9%, the same as in August but significantly less than the 
5.6% rate in July. 
</P>
<P>
The key component of the income category, wages and salaries, increased $14.4 
billion, compared with a rise of $5.7 billion in August. Hurricane Hugo reduced 
wages and salaries by about $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The storm reduced rental income by $9 billion because uninsured losses are 
deducted as an expense when figuring rental income.

French state-owned chemicals group Orkem S.A. said today it will pay $345 
million to buy the Bostik adhesives business from American-owned tools 
manufacturer Black &amp; Decker Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Orkem, formerly known as CdF Chemie, said in a statement that the move is part 
of a strategy aimed at acquiring a leading worldwide position in inks, paints, 
coatings and adhesives. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative reflects Orkem's growing interest in building up its global 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week it said it was considering a full bid for British specialty 
chemicals group Coates Brothers PLC in which it already has a 40.6% stake. 
</P>
<P>
Towson, Md.-based Black &amp; Decker said the Bostik sale is part of a 
$1-billion divestiture plan it has embarked upon to repay debt. The Bostik 
division, which makes chemical adhesives and sealants, was part of its 
acquisition of Emhart Corp. earlier this year.

Unisys Corp., the nation's No. 3 computer company, today reported a huge 
third-quarter loss of $648.7 million and only modestly higher revenues owing to 
slack demand for its computers. 
</P>
<P>
The company had earlier announced plans for a reduction of 8,000 people in its 
work force and the consolidation of manufacturing facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The staff reductions resulted in a special charge of $230 million. Unisys also 
had charges of $150 million for defense division losses related to fixed price 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
A number of defense contractors have reported losses on such fixed contracts, 
introduced by Washington to put a cap on defense costs. 
</P>
<P>
The Unisys quarterly loss, which worked out to $4.25 a share, compares with a 
profit of $151 million or 77 cents a share a year ago. Revenues climbed to 
$2.35 billion from $2.27 billion. Growth in the defense business helped 
revenues.

LIN Broadcasting Corp. said today it has revised its plans to merge its 
cellular telephone operations with BellSouth Corp. in a move evidently designed 
to thwart a buyout bid by McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement provides another twist in what has already proven to be a 
contorted series of moves begun last June when McCaw launched an unsolicited 
takeover bid for LIN, a New York-based cellular telephone and television 
company. 
</P>
<P>
LIN offered no estimate of the value of its revised plan. 
</P>
<P>
However, under the new proposal LIN said it intends to give its shareholders a 
special cash dividend of $42 per share before the merger of cellular 
operations, up from a $20 per share cash dividend under an earlier plan. 
</P>
<P>
LIN said it was able to pay a higher dividend because BellSouth, the regional 
telephone company based in Atlanta, agreed to contribute more assets to the 
merger of cellular interests than originally envisioned.

Davis, managing general partner, moved the team to Los Angeles, wants the team 
to return. 
</P>
<P>
Under the deal approved by the Sacramento City Council, which met past 
midnight, a 5% tax would be levied on tickets for live performances costing 
more than $10 and the 10% hotel room tax would be increased by 1.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Both taxes will take effect July 1, 1990, and do not require voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
"In our view, this special tax is not valid until it is approved by voters," 
said Patrick J. Borchers, an attorney for the Sacramento Hotel Assn., which 
opposed the tax. "We intend to contest the legality in court." 
</P>
<P>
The $50-million franchise fee will be provided by a tax-exempt bond issue 
approved by the council, part of a $93-million plan to fund the fee along with 
several other local projects. 
</P>
<P>
The council's action, not unexpected, marks a formal approval of the agreement 
worked out between the city, business interests and others during months of 
negotiations.

LENDL THINKING OF BOYCOTTING ATP TOUR

World No. 1 Ivan Lendl said he may boycott the new Assn. of Tennis 
Professionals' tennis tour in 1991 because it forces him to play in too many 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl was reacting to a suggestion by Olympic champion Miloslav Mecir that top 
players might simply drop the ATP tour, which starts in January, and 
concentrate on the more lucrative Grand Slam events to allow themselves more 
time off. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd consider it quite seriously because the number of tournaments they (the 
ATP) are asking is a bit too high, and if it doesn't change I'm definitely 
going to do it some time in the future," said Lendl at the European Community 
tennis championship. 
</P>
<P>
But Lendl said he will wait to see how the first year of the ATP tour goes 
before taking any further steps. 
</P>
<P>
"I signed for the ATP tour because I think I should support it at least in the 
first year and see what happens then in 1991," Lendl said. 
</P>
<P>
Mecir said that the rules of the ATP tour, run by the players, are too strict 
and that a Grand Slam circuit would suit the players much better. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have more time for training and for relaxing and more time to 
concentrate on the Grand Slams," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A "Grand Slam tour" would comprise the four major tournaments -- the Australian 
Open, the French Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open -- plus a new Grand Slam Cup 
with a purse of $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Players would also take part in Davis Cup matches, exhibition tournaments and 
special events and would have more practice time and longer rest periods.

Rick Mahorn, the Minnesota Timberwolves top pick in the NBA expansion draft, 
was traded today to the Philadelphia 76ers for a first-round draft pick in 1990 
and second-round picks the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good deal for both teams," said Timberwolves president Bob Stein. 
"We made the deal because we are willing to make long-term decisions that will 
help our club in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Mahorn, who played for the NBA champion Detroit Pistons last season, was under 
a two-year contract with the Timberwolves but has refused to report to camp 
until his contract is renegotiated.
