Who the heck is Mike Downey to preach to me? 
</P>
<P>
His column, "Remember, This Isn't a Show, It Doesn't Have to Go On," was more 
suited for a soapbox or pulpit than the sports section. 
</P>
<P>
I always thought that sportswriters were frustrated jocks. Now I know some are 
frustrated philosophers.

How can human beings guzzle beer, cheer wildly, do high-fives and celebrate 
five miles away from a scene where they were digging for bodies of earthquake 
victims? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the loss of huge revenues by the networks, advertisers, media, fans et 
al is more precious to some than the human lives and misery that prevails at 
this time.

If Mike Downey really feels there ought to be some respect shown for the Bay 
Area's dead, he shouldn't be urging that we cancel the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
He should launch a campaign to shut down Universal Studios' earthquake 
attraction. I noted with disgust that although Universal temporarily closed the 
"ride," they reopened it in time for the weekend crowds. Money talks, as usual. 
</P>
<P>
Earthquakes are not a joke. They shouldn't be portrayed as thrill rides. Get 
serious, Southern California -- you're next.

What a glaring difference between the two columns the day after the earthquake. 
Jim Murray's was measured, compassionate and insightful. Mike Downey's 
hysterical and posturing. He writes: "Why the gods chose to strike down . . ." 
"Ours is not to reason why?" This guy would make Grantland Rice blush. 
</P>
<P>
Then Downey called for the World Series to be canceled. Nonsense. Human beings 
have a magnificent ability not only to survive but to prevail. The games will 
do more for morale than a million pious mumblings in newspaper columns.

SAUGUS PARENT OFFERS HIS POINT OF VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Mike Downey's column on the Saugus-Palmdale football game, he mentions that 
the principal of Palmdale had heard that Palmdale's players were being taunted 
by racial slurs. There is no mention of who spoke those slurs. In fact, there 
is no confirmation from any other source that such slurs were spoken. 
</P>
<P>
My two sons, as two of the three Saugus team captains, state that they heard no 
such slurs being directed at Palmdale's players. Further, they claim that with 
only minor exceptions, the on-field relations between the teams was good. 
</P>
<P>
Personally, I have heard of only one incident on the sideline where a Saugus 
player made a racist remark. The remark was spoken, not yelled, and almost 
certainly not heard by anyone from Palmdale. Coach Dick Flaherty firmly 
instructed the player that the statement was out of line and the player was 
benched for the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
This is my honest understanding of this issue, but I make no claim to being 
unbiased. If Downey had based his story only on my information, he would have 
had a different story. However, he would have been just as guilty of bad 
journalism, as he was in his column.

PEACE CORPS TROTS TO EASY WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
POMPANO BEACH, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a filly with sore feet, Peace Corps does all right. The Swedish-owned 
trotter lived up to her billing as the headliner of the Breeders Crown on a 
rain-spattered Friday night, lulling her rivals into misplaced security for a 
half-mile and then roaring to a 2 1/2-length victory in near-record time before 
a crowd of 12,123 at Pompano Park. 
</P>
<P>
By winning the 3-year-old Filly Trot, a $322,276 race, Peace Corps extended her 
winning streak to 25 against fillies and eight overall, virtually clinching 
trotter-of-the-year honors. 
</P>
<P>
Driven by John Campbell, who has won more Breeders Crown races than any other 
driver, Peace Corps was timed in 1:57 on a fast track, tying the Pompano record 
and missing the world record for a 3-year-old trotter by a fifth of a second. 
</P>
<P>
Peace Corps has a particularly touchy right front hoof and races with a Murphy 
blind, a form of a blinker that discourages her from putting pressure on the 
hoof. She has shown a tendency to bear in when it bothers her, but she went 
straight as a bullet Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Peace Corps, who also won a Breeders Crown race as a 2-year-old, paid $2.20 for 
registering her 31st victory in 38 starts. She may race one more time this year 
and plans are to keep her on the track through 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Park Avenue Kathy led until about the half-mile pole and wound up third, five 
lengths behind Peace Corps. Peach Pitt finished second. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, 34, returned to win the 3-year-old Filly Pace with Cheery Hello, 
giving him 13 winners since the Breeders Crown program began in 1984. Campbell 
has led the country in harness purses for the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
In other races on Friday night's $3-million Breeders Crown program, Town Pro 
won the 2-year-old Filly Pace; Royal Troubador was first in the 2-year-old Colt 
and Gelding Trot; Esquire Spur won the 3-year-old Colt and Gelding Trot; 
Delphi's Lobell captured the 2-year-old Filly Trot; Till We Meet Again won the 
2-year-old Colt and Gelding Pace; and Goalie Jeff was first in the 3-year-old 
Colt and Gelding Pace. 
</P>
<P>
Delphi's Lobell, who had won only four of 12 starts this year, was the surprise 
of the night, paying $53 to win.

CLIPPERS RUN PAST WARRIORS, 137-128 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Clippers, saving their best exhibition showing for the last game, defeated 
the Golden State Warriors, 137-128, Friday night before a crowd of 7,646 at the 
Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
By winning their second straight, the Clippers, who open the regular season 
next Friday at home against Houston, finished the exhibition season 3-4. Golden 
State is 5-2, with one game remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Grant had 28 points and 20 assists for the Clippers, and Reggie Williams 
had 23. Mitch Richmond led the Warriors with 30. 
</P>
<P>
"We got out and ran," Clipper Coach Don Casey said. "We got some easy baskets 
because we're in good shape, and we have to keep that up. We had some defensive 
breakdowns, but there were a lot of hopeful signs."

Pierre Turgeon assisted on the tying goal in the last minute of regulation 
Friday night at Buffalo, then scored at 2:30 of overtime to give the Sabres a 
6-5 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabres gave up four goals in the first eight minutes and still trailed by 
three goals going into the last period. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Foligno scored early in the third period, but only 3:18 remained in 
regulation when Rick Vaive brought the Sabres within one. Foligno's second goal 
of the period at 19:01 sent the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
New York Islanders 5, New York Rangers 5 -- With a three-goal lead going into 
the final period, the Islanders were in a strong position to hand the Rangers 
their first loss at home this season. 
</P>
<P>
But the Rangers rallied to get the tie and are 4-0-3 on home ice. 
</P>
<P>
In 2 1/2 minutes, the Rangers had goals from Carey Wilson and Tomas Sandstrom, 
and with 5:34 left, rookie defenseman Miljoslav Horava tied it with his first 
NHL goal. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver 5, Calgary 5 -- The Flames needed goals by Sergei Makarov and Theoren 
Fleury in the final five minutes of regulation at Calgary to get the tie. 
</P>
<P>
Fleury's tying goal came with only three seconds left. DAN HAFNER

Cal State Long Beach's football team, which lost to Oregon here last season, 
49-0, will have a nonconference rematch with the Ducks at 1 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
"We remembered what happened last year and hopefully that will be motivation 
enough," said Long Beach Coach Larry Reisbig. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, who lost to San Jose State last week, 21-10, are 3-5 overall and 1-3 
in the Big West Conference. They have defeated only one Division I-A team, 
winless New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon (4-3) is led by quarterback Bill Musgrave and tailback Derek Loville, 
neither of whom the 49ers could stop a year ago. In that game, Loville ran for 
154 yards and Musgrave threw three touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
Loville had a 203-yard game last week as the Ducks defeated Arizona State, 
27-7. DICK WAGNER

TED MALONE; PRESENTED RADIO'S 'BOOKENDS' POETRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ted Malone, who filled the airwaves reading poetry and offering homespun 
philosophy in the early 1930s on his "Between the Bookends" series, died Oct. 
20, it was learned this week. 
</P>
<P>
Malone was 81 when he died in Stratford, Conn., of liver cancer. 
</P>
<P>
He was heard over four decades on many local and national radio stations, but 
it was "Bookends," which went on the air in the late 1920s, that made his name 
famous. 
</P>
<P>
Malone, actually, was not his name. 
</P>
<P>
He was born Frank Alden Russell and grew up in Missouri, where he studied at 
William Jewell College in Liberty. There he won first prize in a speaking 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
The manager of Kansas City radio station KMBC offered him a job as an announcer 
and ukulele player. One day in the late 1920s a hillbilly act failed to show up 
and young Russell was told to go before the microphone and read poetry to kill 
time. 
</P>
<P>
He was so embarrassed that he asked that his real name not be used, and another 
announcer introduced him as "Ted Malone." But his reading of William Cullen 
Bryant's "Thanatopsis" produced a flood of favorable mail. In 1935 CBS picked 
up the show nationally and it ran across the country from two to five times a 
week for the next 30 years.

JOHN BECKMAN; DESIGNED SETS FOR 'CASABLANCA,' TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Beckman, filmdom's legendary art director and set designer, who in an era 
and industry focused on the abilities of youth continued to enjoy a career into 
his 91st year, died Wednesday in his sleep at his Sherman Oaks home. 
</P>
<P>
He celebrated his birthday March 27 and in an accompanying interview talked of 
the 14- and 15-hour workdays he still enjoyed as art director of CBS' popular 
TV series "Designing Women." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Beckman, whose film work began in 1934 as art director of 
"Nana," amassed an array of credits that extended from the interior of 
Grauman's Chinese Theater to the murals and theater of Santa Catalina Island's 
Avalon casino to the sets of "Casablanca," "Lost Horizon" and "The Maltese 
Falcon." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Oregon, he was raised in San Francisco and remembered well the fires 
that followed the 1906 earthquake. His parents sent him to Russia to study 
architecture, but he was 12 and had to wait two years to qualify for entry to 
the architectural academy at St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
Beckman was forced to return to the United States in 1912 when his mother 
became ill. (He had booked passage out of England on the Titanic but, at the 
urging of friends who told him the new luxury liner was unsafe, changed to its 
sister ship the Olympic.) 
</P>
<P>
Beckman attended UC Berkeley briefly (he said he was expelled for asking "too 
many embarrassing questions") and then hired out to a Sacramento architect 
before moving to Los Angeles in 1920. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a small town of maybe 400,000," he recalled last March. "You could 
smell orange and lemon blossoms everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
He went to work for the firm that designed the Grauman's Egyptian and Chinese 
theaters, where Beckman created color schemes, furnishings, wall hangings and 
murals. 
</P>
<P>
He segued into films through friends and, after "Nana," designed sets for 
"House of Rothschild," "One Night of Love," "Follies Bergere," "A Midsummer 
Night's Dream" and, in 1950, "The Glass Menagerie." 
</P>
<P>
He was art director for Charlie Chaplin's "Monsieur Verdoux," as well as "The 
Bad Seed," "Gypsy" and "The Devil at 4 O'Clock." 
</P>
<P>
In 1929, he directed the work of five artists who painted the giant and 
elaborate murals of underwater scenes at the Avalon casino. The murals were 
restored as part of a casino renovation in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
For the past two decades, Beckman had been concentrating on television, which 
he described as "very sudden; I find I'm trying to beat the clock." 
</P>
<P>
Pilot films and series he designed for include "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," "The 
Partridge Family," "Nero Wolf," "Cheers" and "Webster." And his last, 
"Designing Women." 
</P>
<P>
Asked the perennial question about the secret of his strength and longevity, he 
said on his last birthday that he wasn't really sure. 
</P>
<P>
"I smoked for 35 years and I eat a lot of sugar. So it could be my attitude. I 
don't let anything bother me." 
</P>
<P>
A widower, Beckman is survived by a son, daughter and two granddaughters.

MILITARY BILL CONTAINS $194 MILLION FOR AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Senate on Friday approved an $8.5-billion military construction bill that 
includes $194 million for the San Diego area. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, which now goes to the President for approval, provides funding 
for a $7.5-million, 600-space parking garage at the Navy Hospital in Balboa 
Park; $15 million for 183 units of family housing at Camp Pendleton and three 
child care centers -- at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot, the 32nd Street Naval 
Station and the Naval Training Center. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the construction of 412 units of housing had been approved for Camp 
Pendleton. With the added 183 units, Camp Pendleton will be able to house 
nearly 600 families, said Rep. Bill Lowery (R-San Diego). 
</P>
<P>
"The additional homes, for our personnel and their families, highlight the 
committee's emphasis on providing decent and affordable housing for the 
military," Lowery said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Camp Pendleton have been upgrading living quarters for years, and 
the money will help accelerate their efforts, said Marine Gunnery Sgt. Stan 
Pederson. "Raising the standards of living makes a difference as to how your 
people operate. This is a real quality-of-life issue." 
</P>
<P>
The funding for construction in the San Diego area also includes the following 
projects: 
</P>
<P>
* $3.6 million to upgrade security at the San Diego Fleet Combat Training 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
* $12.8 million for a firefighting trainer facility at the Fleet Training 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
* $13.9 million for a vehicle maintenance facility at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
* $24.5 million for bachelor enlisted men's quarters at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
Officials welcomed the money as being much needed, and some said they could 
easily use more. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not looking at any fat in the budget here," said Cmdr. Doug Schamp, a 
Navy spokesman. "What you're looking at is probably the cream of a large 
package submitted for approval, and, after much scrutiny under microscopes, 
these items approved were considered necessary to continued operation at the 
current level." 
</P>
<P>
The legislation was approved by the House on Thursday.

MULTIPLE-AIRPORT STUDY IS SCRAPPED FOR NOW; 
</P>
<P>
AVIATION: SANDAG COMMITTEE WILL REVIEW JOINT MILITARY-CIVILIAN USE OF MIRAMAR 
NAVAL AIR STATION INSTEAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The San Diego Assn. of Governments declined Friday to commission a $400,000 
study of a "multiple airport" solution for crowded Lindbergh Field, returning 
the issue to subcommittees for reconsideration. 
</P>
<P>
Sandag's board of directors also added a wrinkle to the continuing attempt to 
relocate the airport when it instructed the committees to consider another 
alternative, the joint military-civilian use of Miramar Naval Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
The instructions came after six South Bay officials asked that the joint-use 
option "be seriously studied" by the Sandag committee investigating the best 
location for a new airport. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that has been looked at, in my opinion, in a very cursory way 
in the past," said Chula Vista Mayor Greg Cox, a Sandag board member. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in its yearlong study, the committee ruled out joint military-civilian 
use of Miramar because airspace above the sprawling Navy base would be 
congested and speed differences between military and civilian aircraft might 
pose a hazard, said Jack Koerper, Sandag's special projects director. 
</P>
<P>
The committee has narrowed relocation options to sole civilian use of Miramar, 
a new facility on land east of Miramar and a binational airport on Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
However, joint use could be reconsidered on the assumption that Lindbergh would 
remain open, reducing the demand on Miramar, Koerper said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The six politicians believe that joint use at Miramar was never given serious 
consideration because of political problems posed by the Navy, which is opposed 
to any civilian use of Miramar. 
</P>
<P>
In what amounted to a declaration of the political will to take on the Navy, 
the politicians stated in their letter to Sandag that "a realistic solution 
requires -- at minimum -- full consideration of NAS Miramar." 
</P>
<P>
The letter was signed by U.S. Rep. Jim Bates, D-San Diego; State Sen. Wadie 
Deddeh, D-Bonita; State Rep. Steve Peace, D-Chula Vista; San Diego City 
Councilman Bob Filner; County Supervisor Brian Bilbray and Cox. Also signing 
the letter was Tom Carroll of the Airline Pilots Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. Douglas Mann, an advisory Sandag member, repeated Friday that the Navy 
opposes joint use of Miramar under any circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Filner and fellow Councilman Ron Roberts also have called for study of a 
"multiple airport" option that would parcel out among four airports the 35 
million passengers expected here by next century. As envisioned, the major 
facilities would be at Lindbergh and at an expanded Brown Field in the South 
Bay, with Montgomery Field and McClellan-Palomar Airport in Carlsbad picking up 
commuter traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Sandag's Airport Advisory Policy Committee on Thursday had agreed to examine 
the option, a process that would have added $400,000 and another year to the 
relocation study, which already has lasted a year. 
</P>
<P>
However, Filner complained that the criteria built into the study would result 
in its automatic rejection, a point repeated Friday by the city's 
representative to Sandag, Councilman Ed Struiksma. 
</P>
<P>
At Struiksma's urging, the matter was returned to the two subcommittees for 
further consideration.

CAPTAIN SEEKS ELECTION WAIVER FROM SHERIFF -- AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Roache, a San Diego County sheriff's captain, said he delivered a second 
request Friday to Sheriff John Duffy, asking him to set aside a department 
policy that says he must resign before he can challenge Duffy in next year's 
election. 
</P>
<P>
And he threatened legal action if Duffy does not respond to his requests by the 
middle of next week. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the most likely alternative I would select," Roache said of a potential 
lawsuit against his boss. 
</P>
<P>
Roache wants Duffy to waive a Sheriff's Department policy that prohibits staff 
members from running against the incumbent sheriff. He said the policy violates 
his constitutional rights to run for office and Duffy, in the spirit of fair 
elections, should allow him to join two other potential contenders in mounting 
a campaign against the longtime veteran sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
Under the existing policy, Roache would have to resign his captain's position 
to run against Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
Roache sent Duffy a written request last month. 
</P>
<P>
Roache said he is particularly concerned because, without an answer from Duffy, 
he may be losing ground in early fund-raising and other political spadework 
needed to wage a campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Your recent political fund-raising activities and increased visibility at 
public events demonstrates that you realize that a countywide election requires 
significant time and early preparation," Roache said in his second letter to 
Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
"Consequently, I need an immediate answer." 
</P>
<P>
He said he "would appreciate a response within three working days." 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, if I have not received a reply, I will assume your answer must 
be negative, and I will consider pursuing whatever alternatives that may 
exist," the letter stated. 
</P>
<P>
He added that a lawsuit asking a judge to overturn the policy would be his next 
step. 
</P>
<P>
But Duffy, questioned about the matter Thursday, said "the legal research isn't 
finished yet" into Roache's request. He said the policy has been around since 
1850 and the matter is a complicated legal one that must be reviewed before he 
can decide how to proceed.

L. A. RETREATS FROM DECISION OVER LOPEZ DUMP; 
</P>
<P>
LANDFILL: IN ABANDONING ITS PLAN TO COMPLY WITH STATE LIMITS, THE CITY COUNCIL 
SAID THE CITY ALREADY IS TRYING TO SCALE BACK DUMPING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Los Angeles City Council backed away Friday from an earlier decision to 
voluntarily comply with state limits on operations at Lopez Canyon Landfill, 
accepting the city Bureau of Sanitation's assertion that it already is making 
efforts to scale back dumping. 
</P>
<P>
But several council members made it clear that they would not support a 
proposed expansion of the northeast San Fernando Valley dump until alternative 
methods of trash disposal are fully studied. 
</P>
<P>
"We shouldn't rely on urban landfills any more," Councilman Joel Wachs said. 
"We need alternatives. That may cost us money, but it's a price worth paying." 
</P>
<P>
State authorities have tried to reduce the city's use of the dump, which gets 
two-thirds of the city's residential trash. But the city won a restraining 
order from a Superior Court judge who accepted arguments that the city cannot 
do so. Since then, the city had promised to comply voluntarily with some of the 
overturned state restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in another room at City Hall, a continued public hearing on the 
proposed expansion of Lopez Canyon, the only city-operated dump, drew questions 
and criticism from politicians and neighbors. The Board of Public Works hearing 
began Monday night at the Lake View Terrace Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez Canyon had been scheduled to close in 1992. However, the Bureau of 
Sanitation last year announced plans to double the landfill's size and extend 
its life through at least 2002. 
</P>
<P>
"When the city of Los Angeles breaks its promise about Lopez Canyon Landfill, 
more than landscape is lost," said a statement by Assemblyman Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar), which was read at the hearing Friday by one of his aides. "Homes 
were purchased and lives were planned based on the promise that Lopez Canyon 
would be closed in 1992." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors recited a litany of problems at the dump, ranging from polluted water 
runoff to children becoming ill from landfill gas emissions. They said that if 
the city cannot prevent these problems now, it should not be allowed to enlarge 
the dump. 
</P>
<P>
"There simply is too much trash generating too much gas too close to a 
residential community," said Rob Zapple, who lives in nearby Kagel Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
An environmental impact report on the expansion, including answers to concerns 
raised during the two hearings this week, will be completed within three weeks, 
according to the Bureau of Sanitation staff. The City Council will vote on the 
expansion proposal in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, neighbors were unhappy with the expansion plans. They 
became even angrier when they learned that two landfill workers had fainted 
last spring after inhaling toxic gas from a pocket that they accidentally 
unearthed. 
</P>
<P>
The state Waste Management Board stepped up its review of the landfill after 
the accident. In July, it ordered the city to scale back dumping at Lopez 
Canyon to levels agreed to in a 1978 permit. The city had been operating under 
less restrictive conditions in a 1983 report, which the city contends amended 
the 1978 permit. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs and Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who represent dump neighbors, asked that 
the City Council instruct the sanitation bureau to voluntarily comply with the 
state order, even though city attorneys were challenging the order in Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Council members approved the Wachs-Bernardi measure at the end of July, then 
changed their votes after city attorneys asked them not to act while the court 
appeal was pending. In September, the city won a temporary restraining order 
against the state limitations. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted Friday to take no action on the Wachs-Bernardi call for 
voluntary compliance, effectively reversing the council's earlier support of 
their request. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Bernardi grilled Bureau of Sanitation Director Delwin A. Biagi about 
how well the city is complying with its pledge of partial voluntary compliance 
the state order. Biagi responded that the city has cut back the number of 
trucks dumping in Lopez Canyon, has stopped dumping on a piece of U.S. Forest 
Service land next to the dump and is preparing a new area for dumping so that 
it can limit the height of the present trash mounds. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bernardi and Wachs said they were disturbed that garbage mounds at the 
dump remain taller than the level stipulated in the state's order, Wachs said 
he was glad that the city had taken some steps to comply. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we've learned we shouldn't have to wait to be forced to do something," 
he said. "We should do it because it's right to do it." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate action Friday, the council approved spending $2.1 million to dump 
refuse from the Bureau of Street Maintenance and the Department of Recreation 
and Parks in private landfills around the county. Finding other places to take 
bulky waste such as grass, tree trimmings and broken asphalt leaves more space 
at Lopez Canyon for residential garbage. 
</P>
<P>
The $2.1 million was transferred from a contingency fund already in the Bureau 
of Sanitation budget.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nancy Hoover Hunter, facing 197 federal tax-evasion and fraud charges, spent 
her first full day under cross-examination Friday discussing her checking 
accounts and financial records through 1983, the year before the La Jolla 
investment firm J. David &amp; Co. collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors presented evidence that although most of the money Hunter 
spent through 1982 was from her personal bank account, in 1983 she began using 
J. David accounts to make personal investments and to give money to her 
immediate family. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter faces the charges in connection with her role as a top executive at J. 
David, which collapsed when investors forced it into bankruptcy court in 
February, 1984. About 1,500 investors lost about $80 million in the J. David 
affair, a giant fraud in which prosecutors allege Hunter played an active role. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys maintain that Hunter was blinded by her love for J. David's 
founder, J. David (Jerry) Dominelli, who became her lover, and was unaware of 
his illegal activities. Dominelli is serving a 20-year federal prison term in 
connection with the investment firm's Ponzi scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter has frequently said since the trial began in March that she thought 
Dominelli was a "genius" and never doubted what he told her. She said Friday 
that she never had reason to change that opinion, even though she was a 
securities broker herself and posted many of Dominelli's accounts on a daily 
basis, because she didn't scrutinize monthly or annual statements. 
</P>
<P>
"I never looked at monthly statements," Hunter said. "I just put them in the 
file."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The youth charged with leaning out a car window last July and bashing 
9-year-old Joshua Garrett on the head with a baseball bat will be tried as an 
adult, a judge has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
Juvenile Court Judge S. Charles Wickersham ordered Stephen Boyle, 17, to stand 
trial as an adult on charges of assault with a deadly weapon and vandalism in 
connection with the July 26 attack, as well as on an unrelated charge of auto 
burglary. 
</P>
<P>
However, Boyle's friend, identified only as 16-year-old Christopher, will face 
a charge of assault with a deadly weapon in Juvenile Court, Wickersham ordered 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have said they believe Christopher was driving Boyle's car in the 
1600 block of Hollister Street in south San Diego when Boyle, who was sitting 
on the passenger side, leaned out and hit Joshua in the head with the bat. 
Joshua suffered a skull fracture but made a rapid recovery that amazed doctors. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the judge made a proper decision, absolutely," said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
John L. Davidson, who had urged that both youths be tried as adults. "It was a 
proper decision because, when we first assessed the case, we felt the offense 
was so grave and so serious that adult court was the proper forum for Stephen 
Boyle." 
</P>
<P>
Christopher's younger age and his lack of a record were the reasons Wickersham 
decided to keep him in the juvenile system, Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
Boyle is scheduled to be arraigned Monday in South Bay Municipal Court, 
Davidson said Friday. Christopher faces a Nov. 2 hearing in Juvenile Court, 
where he will either plead guilty or be scheduled for trial, Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
Bail for Boyle was set at $25,000, Davidson said. Both Boyle and Christopher 
remain in Juvenile Hall, Davidson said.

KILLER GETS SAME 27-YEAR SENTENCE AFTER 2ND TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA KLEIN LERNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
A man who received a new trial after his murder conviction was overturned 
because he received what the court thought was inadequate representation was 
sentenced Friday to 27 years to life in prison, the same sentence he received 
after the first trial. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Robert Aronson, 42, was convicted in 1987 of first-degree murder in the 
1986 shooting of Robert Chris Piper, who was shot at Woodman Avenue and Ventura 
Boulevard after a dispute in a nearby bar. 
</P>
<P>
Aronson's conviction was reversed after he appealed. Aronson's lawyer had been 
Steven L. Dobbs. The 2nd District Court of Appeal concluded that Dobbs' 
"failure to investigate and prepare for trial resulted in . . . a virtual 
abandonment of the case." 
</P>
<P>
The court said Dobbs used no strategy but "to see which way the wind blew. . . 
. Dobbs conducted no pretrial investigation except interviewing Aronson for 
about two hours a day or two before trial," the court said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment, Dobbs, a Studio City lawyer, said: "What the 2nd District 
Court of Appeal said doesn't bother me at all. It's not true." 
</P>
<P>
After a new trial, a jury convicted Aronson on Sept. 25 of murder. On Friday, 
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Raymond T. Mireles sentenced Aronson to the 
maximum term: 27 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Phillip H. Rabichow, nor Aronson's 
new defense attorney, Ronald Le Miex, said anything at the sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate court particularly cited Dobbs for failing to try to find 
Aronson's girlfriend, who could possibly have provided evidence that Aronson 
was intoxicated at the time of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Dobbs said he began work on the case during jury selection on behalf of an 
associate, West Hollywood attorney Harry Weiss. Dobbs said he was suddenly 
called upon to represent Aronson after Weiss dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Added Dobbs: "'No matter how adequately I prepared, he would have been found 
guilty. . . . Mr. Aronson got convicted because he was guilty."

AROUND THE VALLEY: THE OUT-OF-TOWNER'S CONCEPTION OF PALMDALE IS AS CLEAR AS 
SMOG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Chandler, Staff writer John Chandler recently moved to Palmdale. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aword of advice to anyone looking to make it to the top of the Los Angeles 
social scene. Keep it a secret. Never tell your friends. Don't admit to anyone 
that you are moving to . . . Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Among many Angelenos, it seems, the conception of life there -- or in nearby 
Lancaster or anywhere in the vast Antelope Valley -- is about as clear as a 
smoggy afternoon in Van Nuys. It's "somewhere out in the desert," some 
correctly observe. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where it gets so hot in the summer," others point out, probably failing 
to realize that it also can snow in the winter. And as everyone knows, it's not 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
No need to tell that to Palmdale residents, an independent lot who relish the 
40 or so miles of freeway that separate them from the hubbub and sprawl of the 
San Fernando Valley. Ask 10 Palmdale locals what they have to say about the 
Valley and chances are a common answer will emerge: 
</P>
<P>
Whatever made the Valley what it is, they don't want it to happen again where 
they live. 
</P>
<P>
I've learned that bragging that you live in Palmdale of all places is not 
likely to elicit sighs of envy from most urbanites. They tend to gasp and 
stare. They question one's sanity, or wonder if one committed some horrible 
crime to deserve such a banishment. 
</P>
<P>
The trek across the San Gabriel Mountains and their unrelenting loneliness is 
enough to make any newcomer wonder whether anything awaits at the other end. 
But eventually the surprising blue expanse of Palmdale Lake comes into view 
heralding a city at the edge of the desert valley. 
</P>
<P>
It's not like the towns "down below" in L. A. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale is flat -- really flat. A tall ladder provides almost a bird's-eye 
view, with not a high-rise in sight. And Palmdale is sharply defined. Drivers 
can cross unknowingly from Burbank to Glendale. But Palmdale literally stands 
alone, with little but open desert and Joshua trees surrounding it. 
</P>
<P>
Within the city, there are certain constants. 
</P>
<P>
One is countless mothers with young children in tow, young families drawn by 
cheaper housing. Seemingly out of nowhere, they line up by the hundreds at City 
Hall for a magician's show on a summer afternoon, or pack the local Target or K 
mart stores. 
</P>
<P>
Who really lives in Palmdale? Some Los Angeles residents seem to think that the 
area is populated mostly by farmers and colorful old desert codgers. There's 
more than a few of both, but increasingly the population of the city and its 
environs is diversifying as more people try to escape the troubles of urban 
life in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The result is an odd hodgepodge of Canoga Park meets Coachella. Young 
executives race down the Antelope Valley Freeway in the morning in their BMWs. 
A bedraggled young woman in worn jeans sports a fist-sized tattoo on her arm. 
There are plenty of guys in crew cuts and cowboy boots. 
</P>
<P>
Put them all together and the mix is markedly different from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Take politics. For years, Democratic voters and politicians have dominated the 
big city. But the Antelope Valley, where Republicans outnumber Democrats nearly 
two-to-one, is more conservative. 
</P>
<P>
Some say the locals are more religious. Some surely are, but that hasn't 
prevented the bars along Sierra Highway from filling to the rafters with 
boisterous weekend crowds. 
</P>
<P>
What provides the glue that holds the valley together? For years, it's been the 
big A -- Aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
Some call it Aerospace Valley. Signs of the aerospace world are everywhere, 
from Edwards Air Force Base to Air Force Plant 42 to the miles of vacant land 
for the airport that the city of Los Angeles envisions building in some faraway 
future. The mayor of Palmdale is a former test pilot. Air Force planes often 
circle overhead. Aerospace companies are the region's largest employers. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly equal in impact are the acres and acres of homes under construction, a 
spectacle unmatched anywhere in Los Angeles County. Processions of lumber 
trucks, concrete mixers and landscaping crews crisscross the town. They feed 
the hunger of searchers for suburban homes, newcomers who have brought an end 
to Palmdale's not-so-distant era as a sleepy desert town. 
</P>
<P>
Some vestiges remain, though. Parts of the city feel like a ghost town during 
the day, when parents are away at work and kids are tucked away in school. 
</P>
<P>
In the eerie quiet, those at the right vantage point may feel that they cannot 
only see but hear everything going on for miles. 
</P>
<P>
In Palmdale, locals like to boast, you actually can see for miles much of the 
time, unlike the San Fernando Valley. The local smog problem is much less 
severe because of the relative sparsity of development and the desert winds 
that scour the valley. 
</P>
<P>
But at a price. 
</P>
<P>
As one woman explained, Palmdale has three kinds of wind: when it blows, when 
it really blows and when the shingles fly off. 
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon can have both hilarious and not-so-funny effects. The sight of a 
man chasing his sunglasses across a wind-blasted gas station is funny. But the 
same winds are strong enough to slam shut a car door on someone trying to get 
out. 
</P>
<P>
And just try keeping the desert dust out of swimming pools and spas. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the heat, which does go above 100 degrees during July and 
August. 
</P>
<P>
But the locals have an answer to that, the custom of "Desert Dress Days," when 
city officials shun coats and ties for cooler attire. 
</P>
<P>
After all, this is the desert.

GALLEGLY VOTE ON ABORTION BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was no surprise that Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) voted against aid 
to indigent victims of rape and incest. 
</P>
<P>
It is not a question of cost because the alternative in tax dollars is far more 
expensive. It is not a question of morals because who can defend the immorality 
of rape and incest? 
</P>
<P>
Rather, it is the official platform of the Republican Party that stubbornly 
opposes freedom of choice for pregnant women, even for innocent victims of 
crime and debauchery. The bill finally passed, despite Gallegly's opposition, 
thanks to many farsighted Democrats and Republicans who formerly voted against 
such assistance. Now, in spite of the will of Congress, our self-proclaimed 
"kinder and gentler" President has vetoed the measure. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent pro-choice rally in Ventura, more than 1,000 people cheered a 
former Republican candidate who said that 73% of Republicans are pro-choice. 
This was good news because the Republican majority someday may prevail over the 
pro-life Republican reactionaries who have squirmed and bought their way into 
positions of power and influence.

QUESTIONS ON ELKS CLUB STORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The articles appearing in The Times recently about the rejection of three men 
by the Elks Club in Van Nuys raise some questions. 
</P>
<P>
Three men, one white and two blacks, were rejected for membership. Who decided 
this was a racist rejection? They were not all of the same race. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing the men had in common was their sponsor, state Sen. Alan Robbins 
(D-Tarzana). Perhaps the members didn't like the senator's politics and or 
ideologies, his table manners or the way he parts his hair. 
</P>
<P>
Why did these men want to join the Elks, which is purely a social club and is 
not to be used for business or commercial reasons? This question should have 
been asked by the investigating committee, and if the answers given were the 
same as the ones I heard on the radio, the names should never have been 
presented to the membership in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
I heard one of the black men interviewed on a radio talk show, and the host 
asked him that same question. His answer was that he knew that but other 
members were doing it so he thought it would be a good idea for him. 
</P>
<P>
What were the senator's motives in sponsoring these men? Perhaps the Elks 
should look into that.

FRANKLY, WE MUST GIVE A DARN; 
</P>
<P>
THE ARTS: LOOK AT WHAT CENSORS ALMOST DID TO OUR MOVIE IMMORTALS; THEN PICTURE 
WHAT THEY'D DO TO TOMORROW'S CLASSICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN FIRSTENBERG, Jean Firstenberg is director of the American Film 
Institute. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The talk on Capitol Hill about funding cuts or censorship for works of art 
deemed "offensive" has brought forth a lot of angry words. And a lot of 
literary allusions. I've heard references to Orwell, Huxley, and (though 
they're more historical than literary) Cotton Mather and Torquemada. Perhaps 
it's just my background in film, but what comes to mind when I think about this 
controversy is "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner." 
</P>
<P>
The motion picture is the only art form ever subjected to sweeping censorship 
in this country. As such, the experience of film under the reign of the censors 
tells us something about what can happen when an art form decides, for whatever 
reason, to censor itself. 
</P>
<P>
Until about 25 years ago, few Americans regarded motion pictures as legitimate 
art; after all, movies weren't made in ancient Greece or Renaissance Italy, and 
you watched them in commercial theaters, not museums. When President Lyndon B. 
Johnson signed the legislation that resulted in the creation of the American 
Film Institute, he called film "this 20th-Century art form," but it's fair to 
say that, despite the work of Ford, Hitchcock and Welles, to most Americans a 
movie was just entertainment for a Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
It followed that, to the public mind, if film wasn't art, it wasn't entitled to 
the degree of creative protection afforded to the other arts. People who would 
have protested -- or snickered -- at attempts to place a fig leaf on 
Michelangelo's "David" didn't protest when censors routinely changed the 
dialogue, images and even the subject matter of motion pictures. 
</P>
<P>
The censorship was the responsibility of the so-called Hays Office, which 
judged every film made in America for conformity to a code drawn up in 1927 by 
the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (its president was 
Will H. Hays, a former postmaster-general). 
</P>
<P>
The code set rigid limits on which subjects, behavior, activities, words and 
body parts might be permitted on-screen. Among the prohibitions: profanity 
(right down to "damn" and "hell"), venereal disease and (my favorite) 
"excessive and lustful kissing." Sex, even the implied possibility of sex, was 
a no-no, to the point that generations of Americans probably grew up thinking 
that all married couples slept in twin beds. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to enforce the code spawned battles between film-makers and censors 
that havepassed into motion-picture legend. 
</P>
<P>
David O. Selznick had to fight to use damn in Rhett Butler's parting words to 
Scarlett O'Hara (and paid a $5,000 fine for that privilege). 
</P>
<P>
The girl centaurs who had been guilelessly bare-chested in Disney's original 
designs for "Fantasia" were, in the final film, discreetly clad in flowery 
brassieres. 
</P>
<P>
In "Casablanca," the censors diligently attacked every hint of a sexual 
relationship between Rick and Ilse. If they'd had their way, Humphrey Bogart's 
line, "We'll always have Paris," would have been followed by Ingrid Bergman 
saying "Oh? What happened in Paris?" They also did their best to tame the 
unscrupulous, libidinous Inspector Renault, described in a Hays Office memo as 
"an immoral man who engaged himself in seducing women to whom he grants visas." 
That Renault's immorality plays a key role in the story was, of course, 
immaterial to the Hays Office. 
</P>
<P>
The censors left their mark on "Rear Window," in which James Stewart, confined 
to a wheelchair in his apartment, spies on his neighbors through binoculars. 
The censors insisted that the neighbors' lives be far less interesting than 
Alfred Hitchcock intended. 
</P>
<P>
They sniffed with alarm at Frank Capra's "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington": "The 
generally unflattering portrayal of our system . . . might well lead to the 
picture being considered, both here and abroad, as a covert attack on the 
democratic form of government." 
</P>
<P>
And they objected to "The Best Years of Our Lives": "The scene where the 
sergeant and his wife sleep together on the night of his return . . . seems to 
be unduly intimate." A man comes home after years of fighting World War II and 
is accused of undue intimacy! 
</P>
<P>
"Life with Father" ran for 3,200 performances on Broadway, and there's no 
recorded instance of an audience member objecting to the line, "I'm going to be 
baptized, dammit!" The Hays Office regarded the movie audience as "larger and 
less sophisticated" than theatergoers, and the "dammit" provoked a battle 
royal. 
</P>
<P>
In his book, "The Censorship Papers," author Gerald Gardner gives hundreds of 
examples of how censors changed, or tried to change, films that we now regard 
as classics. But there aren't any examples of the might-have-beens, films that 
today might be recognized as great if they had been created as originally 
conceived, and not cut to suit an arbitrary moral standard. The censors watered 
down, cut up and denatured thousands of films. Which one of them, if left 
alone, might have been another "Casablanca"? A "Citizen Kane"? 
</P>
<P>
Much of the code seemed specifically designed to ward off any contemplation of 
life's evils. The fact that these evils were legitimate subjects of drama was 
unimportant to the censors; the public must be protected from seeing them 
on-screen. 
</P>
<P>
The question in my mind is, did we really need that much protection? How much 
damage would have been done by breasts on a Disney centaur? How many people 
were corrupted by Rhett Butler's last line to Scarlett? 
</P>
<P>
And how many good films were never made because the film-makers didn't want to 
take on the production code? 
</P>
<P>
Which brings me back to "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner." One of the taboos of 
the code was miscegenation: an absolute ban on any film treatment of, as the 
code put it, "sex relationships between the white and black races." 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, the year after the code finally fell, "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner," 
a film about an inter-racial love affair, earned 10 Academy Award nominations 
and became one of the most popular films of all time. 
</P>
<P>
The censors had "protected" us from "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" for 40 
years. Do we really want them protecting us from other works of art for the 
next 40?

How do we pay for the terrible destruction done by Hurricane Hugo and the San 
Francisco earthquake? I believe two or three Stealth bombers would do it. We 
could use the money to rebuild, the engineers could be put to work designing 
stronger structures and roads and designing a workable rapid transit system for 
big cities. Workers could be given jobs rebuilding cities instead of building 
bombs. 
</P>
<P>
When we finish that, the money could be used for schools. One bomber could 
probably solve the overcrowding in the area that I teach in. Building schools, 
furnishing them and staffing them could create many jobs as well as filling a 
vital need. 
</P>
<P>
We don't need to raise taxes -- we just need to change our priorities!

What in the hell is the federal government doing to help? Loans to help? The 
countless victims are in desperate need of help now -- not a loan. How about 
giving money to help? Taxpayers deserve a break from the government now! 
</P>
<P>
When foreign countries asked the U.S. for help, we gave millions and millions 
away of our tax dollars. Here at home, it's a loan. One has to qualify for a 
loan. How can one qualify when he is totally poor now? 
</P>
<P>
I am also sick of people gouging at a time like this. Where is their compassion 
for those who have an urgent need? They should hang by their fingers!

Howard Jarvis often stated opponents of Proposition 13 would blame the eruption 
of Mt. Saint Helens on the initiative just because they hated the measure. Paul 
Conrad displayed such a knee-jerk reaction with his cartoon of the Nimitz 
Freeway (Oct. 24). 
</P>
<P>
State government revenues have tripled since Proposition 13 passed. 
Prioritizing that money for transportation could easily have been accomplished 
but the Legislature had other favorite programs to fund. Our organization 
attempted to reorganize priorities towards transportation by sponsoring 
Proposition 72 to use state sales tax on gasoline for transportation purposes 
instead of funneling it to the general fund. Sacramento politicians opposed the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad's attack is the more irresponsible considering experts tell us we do not 
have the technology to brace the Nimitz Freeway against powerful earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
On the same Op-Ed Page, Lenny Goldberg makes the ridiculous statement that 
whereas a freeway collapse in New York would result from a contracting scandal, 
a collapse in California would be the result of an ideological scandal over 
taxes. Goldberg is trying to explain away the fact that disasters happen in 
high tax states without a Proposition 13. Such disasters are the Achilles' heel 
of his argument that high taxes would prevent the calamities. The collapse of 
the relatively newer overpasses in the Sylmar earthquake of 1971 occurred seven 
years before we had Proposition 13 during a high tax period in California. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Jarvis' prediction was correct: Proposition 13 will continue to be the 
scapegoat for any trouble caused by man or by nature.

CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND PERJURY ON THE WITNESS STAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is comforting to see a respected attorney publicly admit what so many have 
privately acknowledged. The police do tell lies. Lies of zealousness, lies of 
omission, lies of cover-up and lies of commission. Worse, these lies are 
condoned, tacitly at least by their supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
An Orange County judge in a traffic court confided that he was aware of the 
lies but that was how the game was played. If an officer had reason enough to 
lie, there was a reason to presume guilt. So much for justice. 
</P>
<P>
Pause, however, to think of the number of times witnesses are influenced, 
coerced and suborned off the stand. Make false identifications, give tainted 
testimony and perjure to please power figures, all in the faith and trust we 
place in police. By the time they reach the stand they believe what they are 
saying well enough to pass any cross-examination. Time indeed for a new look at 
the system.

Let us exalt the scores of civil authorities, rescue workers and others who 
have helped in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake. Responding to their 
highly diversified and demanding calls with alacrity, they have helped ease the 
pain of this terrible tragedy. Many civilians, of their own volition, have 
given their time, money and blood to assist in the recovery efforts. The way 
the people of this state and country have pulled together to help the victims 
of this terrible natural disaster shows our pre-eminence over others.

FUNDS FOR FORMER PRESIDENTS

<TEXT>

My heart bleeds for all four seeing as how they are forced to live on a mere 
presidential pension of $99,500 annually, plus federal financing of office 
space, furnishings, travel, mail and first-class medical care. Not to mention 
private income from speeches, books, articles, business and investments, etc. 
Doesn't the $3-trillion budget deficit tax-burdened public care that we are 
supporting another "royal" family every four to eight years? 
</P>
<P>
I hear Ron and Nancy have traveled to Japan for 11 days to entrance the 
Japanese television public with Teflon "cowboy" big business commercials for $2 
million-plus. 
</P>
<P>
What irks me even more is that there were only four senators on the Senate 
floor when a voice vote was taken, without debate, on the $18.4 billion measure 
which included the bonus for the ex-presidents. Where were the other 96 
senators and what are we paying them for? If they were employed in the private 
sector they'd get kicked out on their ear pronto. Why don't we do the same?

MISL'S BEST APPEARS TO BE GETTING BETTER; 
</P>
<P>
SOCKERS: NEWMAN CONTINUES TASK OF KEEPING SEVEN-TIME LEAGUE CHAMPIONS AT TOP OF 
THEIR GAME.

<P>
Somebody mailed Socker Coach Ron Newman a book the other day about the 
Gillingham's Football League in England. A little smile crossed his face as he 
flipped through the pages. He has fond memories of his playing career. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to see all my old mates here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And then, darned if he didn't stumble onto a black and white picture of himself 
in his old soccer uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing is clearly better (than coaching)," he said. "What responsibilities do 
you have except to yourself?" 
</P>
<P>
Newman's perpetual burden as a coach is to remain innovative enough to keep his 
18-player team ahead of the rest of the Major Indoor Soccer League, an 
increasingly difficult task. The Sockers open their 10th indoor season and 
seventh title defense tonight against the Dallas Sidekicks at 5:35 (PDT) in 
Reunion Arena. 
</P>
<P>
It was Kenny Cooper's Baltimore Blast that darn near stripped the Sockers of 
their championship status last season, before the Sockers finally set them down 
with a one-goal victory in the seventh game of championship series. Each time 
the Blast loses one of these things to the Sockers -- as it has done three 
times -- Cooper hankers to beat Newman's team a little more the next season. 
</P>
<P>
"We're probably the second most successful franchise in the MISL," Cooper said. 
"But from a coaching standpoint, it's all about winning. Last year we thought 
was our year, but they found a way to win." 
</P>
<P>
The bad news for Cooper is that Newman thinks his latest version of the Sockers 
is actually a lot better than last year's. The nucleus is much the same. Branko 
Segota remains the team's undisputed star, though he's acting less like one 
this year. For the first time in a long time, Segota has been with the team 
through all of training camp. He's chummy, Newman says. 
</P>
<P>
But with the addition of Damir Haramina, a forward acquired in a trade with the 
Kansas City Comets, and Jim Gabarra, a forward who signed Friday and will be 
available when he's not playing for the U.S. National Team, the Sockers should 
have more zest offensively. Zoran Karic, the team's leading scorer last year, 
returns, as does Steve Zungul, a 35-year-old veteran who can still be effective 
if properly paced (he did not make the trip for tonight's game because of the 
flu). 
</P>
<P>
Both Newman and Socker President Ron Cady have indicated there is a good 
possibility the Sockers will make a trade soon. If that is the case, Karic's 
name should probably be put at the head of the list. He's a valuable forward 
who would attract interest, but he hasn't always done things the way Newman 
would like, and he is an individual player in a field of team players. 
</P>
<P>
To make room for Jacques Ladouceur, a ball-winning midfielder who was pushed 
off the roster when Haramina signed, the Sockers Friday changed Arturo 
Velazco's status to developmental, which still allows him to play. Ladouceur 
was signed to a one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
"The lad's looked good," Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
What about a trade? 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't consider doing it until I see how Haramina fits into the team," 
Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, the midfield will be steadied, humored and squawked at by Brian 
Quinn, the team captain who earns his living making everybody else play better 
and doesn't mind telling you when you're not playing quite well enough. One of 
the reasons the Sockers wound up in second place behind the Blast after the 
regular season last year was that Quinn missed 18 games because of injury. 
Newman brought in midfielder Rod Castro from the American Indoor Soccer Assn., 
which might prove important if Quinn and Segota have injury troubles again. 
</P>
<P>
You'd think defense would be the Sockers strength considering that Kevin Crow, 
George Fernandez, Ralph Black and Cacho all return from last season. But, of 
course, Newman says he's uneasy about the depth. He tends to worry that way. 
This shouldn't be a problem if Donald Cogsville, the team's first-round draft 
choice, matures quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers have never been a team to jump out in front at the beginning of the 
season. Their record in season openers is 3-6, and they are 1-4 in season 
openers on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not at the beginning where it counts," Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
True enough, but even so, Newman wouldn't mind seeing his team break tradition 
by starting off with some snap. Pacing in this league isn't as simple as it 
was, say, five years ago, when the Sockers were so much better than the rest of 
the competition that they could play below their potential and still win. 
</P>
<P>
But if the victories are harder to come by, the motivation for more 
championships remains. 
</P>
<P>
"It never gets tiring because that's what you play for," said Crow, the MISL's 
defender of the year last season. "You've got to find different challenges. I'm 
not ready to give up that feeling of being a champion." 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's game will be televised live on Ch. 51. The radio broadcast on XTRA 
690 will be joined in progress following the Stanford-USC football game. . . . 
Forward Jim Gabarra will not play tonight because of national team commitments. 
Midfielder Ben Collins will miss the trip because of a strained left thigh 
muscle. Branko Segota injured his ankle in practice earlier this week but is 
expected to play.

MUCH CHANGED AFTER '88 AZTEC-UTEP GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For Coach Al Luginbill and his San Diego State football team, today's trip to 
the Sun Bowl is a return to where much began and ended last year. 
</P>
<P>
That game against Texas El Paso finished Denny Stolz. The Aztecs lost, 59-7, 
the final one-sided defeat of his three-year tenure as coach. 
</P>
<P>
The loss also meant a start for Luginbill, then SDSU's associate athletic 
director. He and Athletic Director Fred Miller watched the game from the Sun 
Bowl press box. The defeat convinced Miller that a coaching change was needed. 
Two days later, Luginbill was named to succeed Stolz. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at 6:05 PDT, Luginbill returns to the Sun Bowl to face a UTEP team far 
different from last year's. 
</P>
<P>
While the 1988 version was rolling over the Aztecs on the way to a 10-3 record 
and its first bowl appearance since 1967, this year's team is 2-6 overall and 
1-3 in the Western Athletic Conference. The record is only one of the changes. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Stull left as coach after the 1988 season to accept a job at Missouri. He 
was replaced by David Lee, former offensive coordinator at Arkansas. Gone, too, 
are nine starters on offense. 
</P>
<P>
"They are struggling," Luginbill said. "Just like us, they are going through a 
transition." 
</P>
<P>
Even the defense, which was supposed to be the Miners' strength, has lagged. 
UTEP is ranked 103rd out of 106 National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division I-A 
teams in total defense, allowing an average of 475.3 yards per game. Through 
eight games, the Miners have surrendered 31 touchdowns, two more than last 
year's teams allowed in 12 regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
As much as the Aztecs have struggled defensively, they still rank ahead of the 
Miners at 95th, yielding an average of 438.4 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between their defense this year and last year is they are are 
not getting the crucial turnovers," Luginbill said. "Last year, they scored a 
lot off of turnovers. That isn't happening this year. They're getting the 
turnovers, but they're making too many of their own." 
</P>
<P>
The Miners are second in the WAC in forcing turnovers with 26, but they have 
committed 22. Only New Mexico (29) and Utah (25) have committed more. The 
Aztecs have committed only 15 turnovers but have forced only 10, lowest in the 
WAC. 
</P>
<P>
But the most telling statistic about UTEP is sacks. The Miners have allowed 47, 
an average of 5.9 per game, while making 13. The lack of protection might also 
help explain the conference-high 15 interceptions thrown by quarterback Howard 
Gasser. 
</P>
<P>
But junior split end Reggie Barrett has become one of the best receivers in the 
conference. Barrett has 37 catches for 633 yards and seven touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a real challenge to try and stop him," SDSU cornerback Clark Moses 
said. "The coach says he reminds him of the (New York) Jets' Al Toon." 
</P>
<P>
Little else about the Miners should remind anyone of the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
The UTEP game is the first of three in a row for the Aztecs (3-3-1, 1-2) 
against teams near the bottom of the WAC. After tonight, they are home against 
last-place New Mexico (1-7, 0-4) next Saturday and Wyoming (2-5, 2-2) Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
That stretch is one reason the Aztec schedule, based on team records, is ranked 
80th (35-44) in Division I-A by the NCAA, ahead of only Hawaii (89th) in the 
WAC. Last year, the Aztecs finished 3-8 playing the 39th-rated schedule 
(57-53-2). 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State defensive tackle Brad Burton has been named to the Western 
Athletic Conference all-academic team for the fourth consecutive year. Burton, 
a senior communications major, has a 3.1 grade-point average. Burton's twin 
brother, Mitch, a tight end, was second team with a 3.1 in business. Other 
second teamers were senior offensive tackle Roman Fortin (3.0 as business 
major) and junior offensive guard Derek Sang (3.2 as a marketing major). . . . 
Injury update: Reserve linebacker Thane Fisher (wrist) and reserve center Zae 
Perrin (neck) are out; wide receiver Dennis Arey (hamstring) made the trip but 
is not expected to play; defensive end Todd Coomes (knee), wide receiver Monty 
Gilbreath (groin), defensive end Steve Matuszewicz (shoulder), outside 
linebacker Sai Niu (ankle) and outside linebacker Eric Thompson (shoulder) are 
all expected to play.

SEAHAWKS: SUNDAY AGAINST THE CHARGERS, STEVE LARGENT COULD ADD THE NFL CAREER 
TOUCHDOWN CATCH MARK TO HIS COLLECTION.

<P>
It's the Triple Crown of career pass receiving, and a most unlikely candidate 
is on the verge of winning it. 
</P>
<P>
Ring Lardner, a legendary New York sportswriter with a remarkable flair for 
humor, had a pet line that would have been a perfect fit for Steve Largent: 
"Although he was small, he was also slow." 
</P>
<P>
Largent is so small and so slow that 116 players were picked ahead of him in 
the National Football League's 1976 draft. He is so small and so slow that, 
after taking him in the fourth round, the Houston Oilers considered themselves 
lucky to get an eighth-round choice from the Seattle Seahawks when they decided 
to cut him. 
</P>
<P>
All Largent can do is catch every pass thrown in his vicinity, and he has done 
this so often in the past 14 seasons that he is closing in on one of the great 
achievements in the history of football. 
</P>
<P>
Largent already has won two legs of the Triple Crown, in each case taking 
records away from the Chargers' Charlie Joiner. He has caught 792 passes and 
amassed 13,709 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Now Largent is poised to complete the grand slam by breaking Hall of Famer Don 
Hutson's record of 99 touchdown passes caught, and he could do it Sunday 
against the Chargers in Seattle. He has 98, having reached that total on the 
only catch he made in the season opener before suffering a broken left elbow 
that has kept him out since. 
</P>
<P>
This is the week for which Largent has waited patiently, the week he comes off 
injured reserve and takes his first shot at the pass-catching trifecta. He is 
recovered and ready for full-time duty. 
</P>
<P>
Largent turned 35 a month ago. He has announced that this will be his final 
season, so there is a sense of urgency about scoring the two touchdowns he 
needs to reach 100. Still, he doesn't think the full impact of such an 
achievement will hit him until he has retired. 
</P>
<P>
"I imagine I'll be more emotional about it later on," Largent said by 
telephone. "When I'm on the field, I get so caught up in the game and the team 
aspect of it that I don't feel the true perspective on the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
"That was crystallized for me when I was out for six weeks. Being out of the 
game, I was able to step back and get a broader view." 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that the significance of the record within his grasp has 
been lost on the University of Tulsa alumnus. The record is one of the oldest 
on the NFL books, having stood 44 years, and is held by the man generally 
considered the greatest receiver of all time. 
</P>
<P>
Hutson, now 76 and living in retirement in Rancho Mirage, was an All-American 
end opposite the late Paul (Bear) Bryant at Alabama in 1934. While Bryant went 
into coaching, Hutson joined the Green Bay Packers, and from 1935 through 1945 
there wasn't a man in the league who could stop him. 
</P>
<P>
Hutson was the first player to win receiving's Triple Crown and still stands as 
the only one. When he retired with 488 catches (for 7,991 yards), the runner-up 
was 298 behind him. 
</P>
<P>
In 11 NFL seasons, Hutson was an all-pro nine times. He led the league in 
catches eight times, in reception yardage six times and in touchdown passes 
nine times. He also intercepted 30 passes as a safety -- players went 60 
minutes in those days -- and even kicked extra points and field goals. All 
told, he scored 823 points, including 105 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't really studied Hutson, but I've heard about him," Largent said. 
"I've heard he was a great player, and most of all, a great person." 
</P>
<P>
Largent also has the utmost respect -- in this case first-hand -- for Joiner, 
who now coaches the Charger receivers. He broke Joiner's records of 750 catches 
in 1987 and 12,146 yards in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I really admired Charlie," Largent said. "He was a gifted athlete, but he 
worked hard, too. I remember a quote by Earl Weaver (former Baltimore Orioles 
manager): 'The most important thing is what you learn after you think you know 
it all.' Joiner is that type of person." 
</P>
<P>
Hutson was far ahead of his time. It is said he invented many of the moves that 
wide receivers use today. 
</P>
<P>
The late Charlie Brock, who played center in the last seven of Hutson's 11 
seasons with the Packers, recalled Hutson as an incomparable performer in an 
interview with the Milwaukee Journal in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"Hutson revolutionized pass receiving," Brock said. "Of all the players from 
our era, the one most likely to be able to play today would be Hutson. He faked 
linebackers right onto their backs, and he could stop and go so quickly that 
the defenders were always off balance. There was nobody close to him." 
</P>
<P>
True, Hutson made his moves against players who were not the specialists that 
defensive backs are today. Because free substitution was still in the future, 
they spent half their time playing offense. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there are those who insist that such a technicality didn't make 
any difference. One is another Packer Hall of Famer, halfback Paul Hornung of 
Vince Lombardi's glory teams of the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
Once, Hornung and several teammates were watching old Packer films and saw 
Hutson shake off triple coverage to catch a pass. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a believer, am I a believer," Hornung said. "You know what Hutson would do 
in this league today? The same things he did when he played." 
</P>
<P>
To grasp the magnitude of what Hutson accomplished, consider that he played in 
only 117 games, compared to Largent's current total of 191. Also there was a 
lot less passing then than there is now; in 1942, Hutson caught 74 passes, more 
than four NFL teams completed. 
</P>
<P>
"We played 10 or 11 games a year," Hutson said. "Now they play 16. And a team 
today is liable to throw 50 passes in one game. We might have thrown only 50 in 
one season." 
</P>
<P>
Hutson was two inches taller than Largent at 6-feet-1, but 10 pounds lighter, 
at 180. He also was considerably faster. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he felt about having Largent close in on his last big record, Hutson 
said, "I'm happy for him. I see Chuck Knox (the Seahawks' coach) down here in 
the off-season, and at a dinner we went to one time, Chuck talked for 15 
minutes about this guy Largent. He really gave me a lecture, telling me not 
only about Largent's football ability but his fine family life and the good 
things he does in the community. He went on and on. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tickled to hear Largent is that kind of guy. If somebody is going to break 
my record, I'm glad it's Steve Largent." 
</P>
<P>
Hutson said it would be impossible to compare his style with Largent's, but 
added that the art of catching passes hadn't changed much over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that the receivers today use pretty much the same moves that we 
had," Hutson said. "There's no question that we started a lot of that stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen Largent on TV, and I see things that are similar. He catches 
anything anywhere near him. He's a great receiver. I don't think he's fast as 
receivers go, but his moves are as good as any." 
</P>
<P>
Hutson scoffs at the opinion held by many old-timers that athletes are not as 
good as they used to be. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the greatest respect in the world for the players of today," he said. 
"They're far better at everything than we were in the old days. They're such 
specialists at their positions. I was one of the first to say that. 
</P>
<P>
"Free substitution is one of the greatest things that ever happened to 
football. They play five minutes or so, then they rest. They don't take all 
those hits that we used to take. That makes a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
Knox, 57, recalled that when he was growing up in Sewickley, Pa., Hutson was as 
famous as baseball's Joe DiMaggio. Asked about the belief that Hutson pioneered 
the art of receiving, Knox said, "I think that's true." 
</P>
<P>
And Largent? As Hutson noted, mere mention of his name inspires the normally 
reserved Knox to search for superlatives. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve is a unique player, a unique person," Knox said. "He epitomizes what 
people mean when they talk about professional athletes as role models. 
</P>
<P>
"He watches everything that goes on in practice, he studies at night, and he's 
productive every Sunday. That's why he'll be in the Hall of Fame." 
</P>
<P>
Knox pointed out how diligently Largent worked during the rehabilitation period 
that followed his opening-game injury. 
</P>
<P>
"He went onto the field by himself and ran all the pass patterns," Knox said. 
"He even put pads on. You just don't see players on injured reserve with pads 
on, but Steve is a different type of person. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen only two players in my 36 years in coaching work that hard in rehab. 
The other was Merlin Olsen, and he's in the Hall of Fame." 
</P>
<P>
Told of Knox's remarks, Largent said, "There was method to my madness. I wanted 
to come off IR and be back in midseason form. Staying used to wearing pads and 
a helmet, seeing the football and running routes were things I could do while I 
was on IR. I caught one-handed after a couple of weeks, and within four weeks I 
was catching normally." 
</P>
<P>
Largent said he hadn't patterned his style after any one receiver. 
</P>
<P>
"I watch the others and the things they do," he said. "If I see a good route 
that's new to me, I may use it. I try to borrow from a lot of different 
players." 
</P>
<P>
At this point, Largent owns five NFL records. Besides those for receptions and 
yardage, he holds records of 10 seasons with 50 or more catches, eight seasons 
of 1,000 or more yards and a current streak of 168 games with at least one 
catch. 
</P>
<P>
Which record means the most to him? 
</P>
<P>
"The one for career receptions," he said. "That's the one everybody looks at. 
Of course, the ultimate would be to get the reception, yardage and touchdown 
records, but I haven't broken the third one yet." 
</P>
<P>
Although Largent hasn't shown any signs of going downhill -- his average 
yardage per catch of 16.5 last year tied the third best of his career -- he is 
adamant about retiring at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be hard to leave, but I've got to move on," he said. "Coaching is not 
in my future because I wouldn't enjoy being forced to move my family all over 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I have business interests in Tulsa and Seattle, and I've talked to a couple of 
network people about doing TV work after my career is over. At this point, I 
don't have any particular direction." 
</P>
<P>
As Knox said, one direction Largent is sure to take is toward the Hall of Fame, 
and he was asked if he had given this much thought. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a difficult question to answer," he said. "It presumes so much, and I 
just don't want to do that. But it brings a smile to my face every time I look 
in the record book and see my name with the likes of Hutson and Lance Alworth 
and Raymond Berry, some of the fabled receivers of the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all like a dream to me. I can't believe it's true."

MONTCLAIR PREP SURVIVES CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were approximately nine minutes remaining in the game between hitherto 
unbeaten and unchallenged Montclair Prep and Alpha League rival L. A. Baptist 
Friday night when an eerie thought crossed the minds of those in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Heck. We have ourselves a ballgame. 
</P>
<P>
Big, bad Montclair Prep was leading the Knights by just two lousy points. In 
the fourth quarter, no less. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, Montclair Prep rose to its first challenge of the year. The Mounties 
buckled their chin straps and hopped onto the shoulder pads of running backs 
Michael Jones and Derek Sparks, who did not disappoint. 
</P>
<P>
Each scored a touchdown in the final seven minutes, and Montclair Prep (8-0, 
3-0 in league play) escaped with a 34-19 win at Kennedy High. 
</P>
<P>
If the Alpha League were to count victories on the basis of heart, however, the 
powers that be would be forced to award a big, fat "W" to the gritty bunch from 
L. A. Baptist (6-2, 2-1). 
</P>
<P>
"They could have easily rolled over coming into the game," said Sparks, who 
gained 132 yards and scored three touchdowns in just 12 carries. "But they 
showed us some heart." 
</P>
<P>
As one may imagine, L. A. Baptist Coach Mark Bates wasn't willing to trade a 
spiritual victory for a concrete win. "You can see we played our hearts out," 
Bates said. "But in the end it comes down to athletic ability and there was no 
doubt who had superior ability." 
</P>
<P>
That much was for sure. After Knight quarterback Chris Robinson scored on a 
four-yard run to make the score 21-19, Jones and Sparks showed why the Mounties 
are the No. 1-ranked team in Division IX. 
</P>
<P>
From the Montclair Prep 36-yard line, Jones carried three times for 51 yards, 
and Sparks carried three times for 13 yards, including a six-yard scoring jaunt 
with 7:11 left to make the score 28-19. 
</P>
<P>
Wham-o. Six plays, game in hip pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Jones added an insurance touchdown on a six-yard run with 3:49 left. But the 
damage was done on the six-play explosion. 
</P>
<P>
"Derek said to me on the sideline, 'Let's go, Mike,' so we did," said Jones, 
who led all rushers with 184 yards and two touchdowns in 22 carries and now has 
1,103 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Mountie win came in the face of a Knight team that entered the game with an 
exciting and unusual bag of tricks. 
</P>
<P>
Bates had his players running reverses, throwing option passes, shovel passes 
and fake punts all night, gaining 276 yards against a defense that entered the 
game surrendering an average of 102.

Oxnard 32, Rio Mesa 22 -- Fullback Bryant Taylor rushed for 223 yards and 
scored the game's first and last touchdowns to lead the Yellowjackets at Rio 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Rio Mesa closed to within three points with 5:15 remaining on a 13-yard 
touchdown pass from Henry Wilson to Charles Thompson, but Taylor answered with 
a 49-yard scoring run to put the game out of reach. Gordy Abellera of Rio Mesa 
(4-4, 2-3) rushed 14 times for 51 yards, including a 24-yard touchdown run.

HARVARD CLAIMS WATER POLO PLAYOFF BERTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harvard High clinched its first Southern Section 3-A Division playoff berth in 
water polo with an 11-7 victory Friday over Mater Dei in a Del Rey League match 
at Mater Dei High. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Jim Toring had four goals and teammate Eric Deutsch added three for 
the Saracens (24-4 overall, 9-0 in league play), who are ranked fourth in the 
division. Goalie Antonio Gomez recorded eight saves. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mater Dei (6-4 in league play) scored first, Harvard led, 7-2, at 
intermission and the outcome was never in question. "Even when they were ahead 
it wasn't close," Harvard Coach Rich Corso quipped. 
</P>
<P>
But Corso, whose team moved up from the 2-A Division this season, has his 
sights on more than a league title. 
</P>
<P>
"League wins are fine but what we're really pointing toward is 12 days from 
now," he said, referring to the opening playoff match.

TOREROS TO MEET TALENTED UCSB IN PIVOTAL GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before the season, University of San Diego Coach Brian Fogarty called UC Santa 
Barbara the most talented football team the Toreros would face. Seven weeks 
later, he says the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
Only now, UCSB -- which USD will play this afternoon at 1:30 in Isla Vista -- 
is the most important opponent of the year, too. 
</P>
<P>
USD is 6-1, having lost only to Occidental two weeks ago. For the Toreros to 
have a shot at the NCAA Division III playoffs, they must win their final two 
games -- today and Nov. 11 in their homecoming against Menlo College. 
</P>
<P>
UCSB (5-2) has won four in a row. But the Gauchos are ineligible for Division 
III postseason play because the program is converting to Division II. In fact, 
USD is UCSB's only non-Division II opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental is 5-1, including a forfeit victory over Azusa Pacific, an NAIA 
Division II team that USD defeated, 24-6. Of its three remaining games, 
Occidental plays Whittier (1-5) twice and Redlands (3-3). 
</P>
<P>
Occidental is ranked fourth in the West Region, from which four teams -- and 
normally only one from California -- are generally selected for the 16-team 
playoff. USD was ranked No. 4 before losing to the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
If both USD and Occidental win the rest of their games, the Toreros could argue 
fewer losses with a tougher schedule. Occidental would claim dominance because 
it defeated USD. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Toreros must first defeat UCSB. Last year, USD lost, 13-10, when 
Gaucho linebacker Bryan Scher made a fingertip interception in the end zone 
with 23 seconds left. UCSB had just scored with 2:11 left on a nine-yard pass 
from Mike Curtius to Kevin King. USD won in the rain in 1987, 7-0.

DAVE DISTEL: SEGOTA IS JUST LOOKING FOR SOME RESPECT

Quickie quiz . . . 
</P>
<P>
How many times has Branko Segota been the Major Indoor Soccer League's most 
valuable player? 
</P>
<P>
How many times has Branko Segota been the Major Indoor Soccer League's leading 
point scorer? 
</P>
<P>
You say three or four for one and maybe two or three for the other? Maybe more 
for both? 
</P>
<P>
If there is anything frustrating about Segota's career, it is that so few 
people, soccer fans among them, know the answer to either of those questions. 
Baseball fans know, for example, that Tony Gwynn has won four National League 
batting titles, and football fans know Dan Fouts never played in a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
So here's Segota, a local hero whose career hereabouts roughly parallels 
Gwynn's in terms of both success and longevity, and he might not even be 
recognized in the streets if he was wearing his uniform. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, when a conversation one morning this week took an inexplicable turn to 
hockey, Segota seemed bemused. 
</P>
<P>
"I skate," he said, "but I don't play hockey. Maybe I would be a Gretzky." 
</P>
<P>
In his sport, I reminded him, he is a Gretzky. He is No. 2 all-time in the MISL 
in both points and goals. At the age of 28, he is playing Wayne Gretzky to 
teammate Steve Zungul's Gordie Howe. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," he said, "about the only thing I'm not happy with is that we don't get 
the respect that people like Gretzky or Dan Fouts or Dan Marino get, key 
players who have done so much for their sports. We just don't get the 
recognition." 
</P>
<P>
True. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers open their quest of an eighth indoor soccer championship tonight at 
Dallas, and this team just may be better than all its predecessors. And, after 
the literal trials and tribulations of 1988, the MISL itself seems stronger 
than ever. What's more, to showcase this wonderful new beginning, the game is 
being televised live at 5:30 on Ch. 51. 
</P>
<P>
All of this would have made for wonderful exposure, except for one thing . . . 
</P>
<P>
Who would have imagined that Game 4 of the World Series would be televised at 
5:35 on Oct. 28? 
</P>
<P>
So Branko and the boys will be on the little black-and-white in the garage 
rather than the wide screen in the den. 
</P>
<P>
But that's the way it is. 
</P>
<P>
It's the game. 
</P>
<P>
It just has not caught on beyond little pockets of enthusiasm, San Diego being 
one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"I've wanted to leave so many times," Segota said, "and just forget about it." 
</P>
<P>
Leaving would likely entail a return to his native Yugoslavia, where he was 
tempted once again this summer to give it up and join Dynamo Zagreb for the 
outdoor game. 
</P>
<P>
"But," he said, "I've devoted so much time and so many years to this game. I 
want this game to succeed." 
</P>
<P>
And so he is back for his sixth year with the Sockers and his 12th as an indoor 
player. He has played for either the MISL or the North American Soccer League 
since he was 17 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Like Gretzky, Branko Segota is a young veteran. 
</P>
<P>
However, he does not really consider himself to be like Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
"All we want to do is keep this league going and make it strong," he said. 
"That's what we're all part of now. We're the pioneers." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, then, it will turn out that Segota will be indoor soccer's Gordie 
Howe, eventually passing his buddy Zungul and setting the records for some 
Gretzky on carpet to come along in a few years and break. 
</P>
<P>
And the MISL is now actually daring to think it will be around in a few years. 
After being down to seven teams and one division a year ago, it is back up to 
eight teams and two divisions this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's looking very good," Segota said. "There's a real positive 
attitude and we have some strong people behind the clubs now." 
</P>
<P>
Stability has never been a trait associated with the MISL. And this, Segota 
said, has hurt player development. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of kids are playing soccer in this country," he said, "but they don't 
keep playing because there's no security. They've never known whether the 
league's going to be here the next year or not. When we get where we're stable, 
a lot more Americans will keep playing. Once we get television into it, maybe 
we'll get to the point where we'll get the recognition of a Gretzky or Dan 
Fouts." 
</P>
<P>
Who knows whether this will happen in the span of Branko Segota's career, which 
he expects will last another five or six years. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'd like to do," he said, "is finish my career here in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, he would like to finish on his own terms. He would like his 
career to be finished because he is done, not the MISL. 
</P>
<P>
One more thing. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime between now and whenever the end might be for Branko Segota, maybe he 
will lead the MISL in scoring or win an MVP award. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, he hasn't done either yet.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: CONFUSION ABOUT MORTGAGE INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: The recent earthquake in San Francisco forced thousands of families 
throughout the Bay Area to flee their homes and find other living arrangements. 
I understand that those homeowners with earthquake insurance stand to recover a 
substantial portion of their losses. But even these fortunate people are faced 
with extra living expenses, as well as their regular monthly mortgage. Is this 
a case where having mortgage insurance would be a great benefit? -- J. R. B. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: No, not really. Mortgage insurance is designed to offer other types of 
protection. But this is not to say there isn't some coverage available for 
homeowners forced to find temporary housing as a result of an earthquake or 
other disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Let's start with what mortgage insurance is -- and isn't. Traditionally, 
mortgage insurance has been tied to life insurance policies. In the event of 
the death of a family's breadwinner, the policy pays off the remaining mortgage 
on the house. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, what is known as "private mortgage insurance" has been 
introduced. These policies are designed to protect the banks and thrifts that 
lend home buyers the money to purchase their houses. Typically, lenders require 
home buyers who are considered an special credit risk, or who make a down 
payment of less than 20% of the home's purchase price, to buy an insurance 
policy that pays off the lender in the event the borrower defaults on the loan. 
</P>
<P>
Neither type of mortgage insurance would be of benefit in the event of a 
catastrophe, except in the unlikely event that the homeowner dies, in which 
case the life insurance coverage takes over, or he defaults on the loan and 
walks away from his investment, allowing the lender to seek restitution from 
the underwriter under the private mortgage insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Still, although no insurance policy will pay off the mortgage on a house 
damaged during a catastrophe, most catastrophic insurance, including earthquake 
policies, cover personal living expenses incurred as a result of a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Western Insurance Information Service, a trade association in 
Tustin, the average homeowner's policy that offers you fire insurance would 
cover your expenses if you were forced out of your home due to a fire. 
</P>
<P>
If you have earthquake insurance, you would have similar coverage in the event 
of an earthquake. And, unlike the basic earthquake insurance that carries a 10% 
deductible, living expenses are entirely covered and usually for as long as 
they are incurred. 
</P>
<P>
So, although you must continue to pay the mortgage on a house you can't live 
in, at least you do not face a double set of housing expenses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Home Equity Provides Retirement Income 
</P>
<P>
Q: In two years I will be eligible to collect Social Security payments of about 
$500 per month. I own a house that has a market value of about $230,000 on 
which I still owe $23,000. Can you suggest some way I can use the equity in my 
house to generate additional retirement income? Moving out of the state and 
leaving my grandchild is out of the question. -- R. R. 
</P>
<P>
A: You don't have to move out of the state. But our financial advisers do 
strongly recommend that you sell your house. When you sell, you should be able 
to take advantage of the one-time exclusion of $125,000 in profits available to 
homeowners over 55. If your profit exceeds that exclusion, you should buy a new 
home with a purchase price that at least exceeds your remaining profit; this 
way you will owe no taxes on the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Our advisers recommend that you look for a small house or condo that you can 
buy outright, leaving you no mortgage payments. The remainder of your proceeds 
from the sale of your house, perhaps as much as $100,000, could be invested in 
a safe, reliable certificate of deposit or money market fund. At 9% interest, 
your investment would generate $750 a month, giving you a total monthly income 
-- including your Social Security benefits -- of $1,250. 
</P>
<P>
At current tax rates, you would owe about $800 a year in federal taxes and $100 
in state taxes on your $15,000 annual income, our advisers calculate. Remember, 
you have no mortgage payment; your only housing expenses are property taxes, 
insurance and routine residential maintenance. Your income should be able to 
handle the remainder of your daily living expenses and, quite likely, a few 
occasional luxuries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Self-Employed to Get New Tax Break in '90 
</P>
<P>
Q: Last week you wrote that half of the Social Security taxes paid by 
self-employed people can be deducted as a business expense. Since when? Please 
tell me more. -- S. S. 
</P>
<P>
A: Beginning in the 1990 tax year, self-employed taxpayers may deduct one-half 
of their Social Security contributions as a business expense on their tax 
filings. The new provisions are designed to more equitably treat the 
self-employed worker, who is actually half employee and half employer. 
</P>
<P>
All employed taxpayers now pay half of the total contributions made to Social 
Security on their behalf; their employers pay the other half. However, 
employers have long been able to deduct these contributions as a business 
expense. Beginning next year, self-employed individuals will be able to claim 
the "employer" share as a business expense and report it on Schedule C of their 
tax forms. Their "employee" contributions, just as those from corporate 
employees, are not tax deductible. 
</P>
<P>
For more information, see Section 1449.725 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Computing the Gains of Stock Reinvestment 
</P>
<P>
Q: I owned stock in a utility company and participated in its utility 
reinvestment program until selling the stock a few months ago. Since my gain 
comes from the shares I had owned for several years as well as from those I had 
held just a short period of time, must I report the sale on both the short-term 
and long-term sections of the tax form? Or may I just complete the long-term 
section? I would like to save myself from unnecessary work. -- N. J. L. 
</P>
<P>
A: Our tax advisers say you should report the sale as a long-term investment. 
Since the abolition of capital gains tax rates, there is no longer a 
distinction between long-term and short-term gains. The tax rate applied to the 
gain is the same, regardless of how long you held the stock.

ART: FABERGE'S FABULOUS EGGS HIGHLIGHT A TROVE OF SOVIET ART THAT INCLUDES

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Well, the town laid an egg. How can that be? 
</P>
<P>
To the occasional visitor, San Diego looks vibrant these days. Its 
once-blighted downtown bustles with amenities. It has all the hallmarks of a 
mini-metropolis. The community has such an understandable case of self-afflatus 
it is throwing itself an arts festival, subtitled "Treasures of the Soviet 
Union." So far, reviewers of musical and theatrical events have been impressed. 
It was time to go down and sample the festival's art exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
Yup, the town laid an egg. 
</P>
<P>
Was it because Mayor Maureen O'Connor played too much of the art czar in 
organizing the fest as some locals are grumbling? 
</P>
<P>
Actually, if you're going to be a czar, a Soviet arts celebration seems the 
time to do it. It wasn't that. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego laid an egg to prove that laying an egg is not always a bad thing. 
Actually, it gently laid 27 eggs in the galleries of the San Diego Museum of 
Art. The orbs are encased in jade, encrusted with diamonds and festooned with 
pearls. Diamonds are a pearl's best friend. 
</P>
<P>
They are, of course, those rare baubles that make you wonder for once if the 
word fabulous is not an understatement. They are the imperial Easter eggs 
fashioned for the last two Russian czars by Peter Carl Faberge from the 1880s 
to 1917, when the Bolsheviks put an end to the fun. 
</P>
<P>
This, due to the miracle of glasnost, is the first time the eggs have been 
allowed to wander abroad since their incarceration in the museums of the 
Kremlin, where even Soviet citizens could not see them for decades. 
</P>
<P>
We already know what Faberge eggs look like. About five times the size of a 
chicken egg, they are fashioned of enough precious stuff to sink a dowager. 
They come with little windows that open on miniature paintings of everything 
from imperial pooh-bahs to vast landscapes. Kind of like painting the Grand 
Canyon on your fingernail. 
</P>
<P>
They have themes and open up to reveal their leitmotifs. The Azova Egg is 3 1/2 
inches long and contains a tiny replica of a naval cruiser complete with 
rigging. The Trans-Siberian Railway Egg disgorges a footlong working model of 
the fabled train. Ditto for the Gatchina Palace Egg. Whole dang palace right 
there inside. An ant in the courtyard would look like a large horse. 
</P>
<P>
We already know what we think about Faberge eggs. If we are pure aesthetes, 
they are simply the most intricate, clever, goggling examples of sumptuous 
objets d'art ever to come out of a westernized court. If we are political 
idealists, they are symbols of oppressive royal decadence taunting overthrow by 
the downtrodden. 
</P>
<P>
We may even think we already know how we feel about the famous ova -- 
superficial spawn of self-indulgent silliness. One look, however, and you don't 
much care whether or not they are art in the most exalted sense. One look and 
you are seduced. The eggs were made to give pleasure and charm an essentially 
childlike part of the mind that believes in diamond trees and people the size 
of peanuts. It works every time, from the tiny golden swans to the 
near-invisible rock-crystal egg with a peacock inside. 
</P>
<P>
If the adult part of the mind gets loose, it may see a tragic scenario as the 
eggs' designs move from sweet early ones celebrating spring flowers to a late 
example where a steely egg looks like a bomb mounted on cannon shells. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from the length of the lines and the rapt attention of visitors, it 
appears that the show (through Jan. 7) is a veritable popular hit. Potential 
visitors would be well advised to call ahead -- (619) 232-7931 -- for 
admissions information. Every time I try, the line is busy. 
</P>
<P>
Other exhibitions are bound to be less dazzling, but there is something to be 
learned from the ensemble. There is radical contrast between the Byzantine 
Faberge tchotchkies and an exhibition of contemporary Soviet photography across 
the Balboa Park arcade in the Museum of Photographic Arts (to Nov. 19). 
</P>
<P>
Titled "An Insight Into Contemporary Soviet Photography; 1969-88," it was 
organized in Paris and includes some 150 images by 39 photographers. At a 
glance, it looks much like an American show of our scruffier sort of street 
artist, from Robert Frank to Diane Arbus. There is even one artist -- Evgueni 
Ioufit -- who appears to be hip to Cindy Sherman. Like her, he dresses up for 
his own pictures, but the result are funkier and more authentically haunted. 
</P>
<P>
If these shows do anything, they should shake up any lingering middle-class 
assumptions that, really, the Soviets are just like us. Their art says they are 
not. 
</P>
<P>
These photographs show the Soviet Union as a vast, bleak land roamed by a 
voracious and oppressive minotaur. The monster is industrialization in works 
like those of Aurimas Strumila, who photographs factory funnels like predatory 
dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet space is a yawning emptiness, so that a man caught standing in Red 
Square by Alexandre Lapin is so isolated he makes Sartre's Existentialism 
downright cozy. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's because the photographers tend to be young, but most of the people 
pictured are kids who look like American hippies of the '60s -- except the 
Soviets didn't have to don their weird outfits as costumes. It's the way they 
dress. 
</P>
<P>
We know that pictures of older Russians give them immense leathery character 
and the bulk of endurance, but the young ones look like frail souls about to 
leave their skinny bodies in the gutter. Especially in pictures by Andrei 
Biezoukladnikov. His little half-nude tomboy Lolita is so fumingly indifferent 
you know she cares a lot. Igor Moukin's shot of a satanic street dandy lurking 
tensely on a corner finds him lost in some Dostoevskian fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
Literature tells us about Soviet suffering, soul and poetry. These pictures 
give us a gut sense of the emptiness that compounds it. Soviets are 
traditionally seen as serious and philosophical, even ponderous. Chekhov shows 
us they are also subtle and funny, as does "Posters of the Soviet Union" up the 
road at the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art (to Jan. 7). Not a heavyweight 
show and lacking a catalogue, it nonetheless fills a couple of galleries with 
posters in the well-designed European style familiar in the old Graphis 
magazine. Influenced by everything from turn-of-the-century Paris to the 
Russian avant-garde, the works are not only visually striking but engaging for 
what they tell us about the way Soviet graphics communicate. 
</P>
<P>
A mordant sheet by K. Ivanov shows simplified silhouettes of figures eaten to 
Swiss cheese by a sputtering red blob. The motto -- very small -- is "AIDS 
Attacks." Far too oblique for an American design. 
</P>
<P>
We might get an environmental exhortation by I. Maystrovskiy showing a dragon 
made of belching factories with the legs of bureaucrats, but there seems to be 
a double message here -- a criticism of The System. Much of the work is uneasy 
with internal contradiction, double-entendres, asides and defensive pessimism. 
The slogan of a work by M. Mikrtchan announces "Every Student Is an 
Individual," but the image makes the students into identical teeth in a comb. 
</P>
<P>
Curious. 
</P>
<P>
Contemporary art buffs will surely want to start their festival tour with a 
Soviet show that is not even officially part of the celebration. It is UC San 
Diego's presentation of the emigre art team know as Komar and Melamid. Widely 
known as they are in art circles these days, they have never had an exhibition 
in these parts. 
</P>
<P>
The show (to Dec. 10) is a pleasant surprise. Reproductions of their best-known 
works show Vitaly Komar and Alexandre Melamid as clowns camping on the style of 
Soviet Realism they learned back home. Such images as a statuesque Stalin with 
a muse kneeling at his feet appear as cultural one-liners, trying to get 
contemporary mileage out of a boring, academic style. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the 30 works here are loose, conceptual and full of affection, 
accompanied by a lot of winks, nods and muffled guffaws. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, they are made up of three or four joined canvases each in a 
different style suggesting a sly theme. They read best from right to left. "I 
Love NY" (with a heart for the "love") starts with a bag emblazoned with the 
motto and stuffed with trash. The next image is a nude with a brown bag over 
her head, followed by a photographically reversed image of the N.Y. logotype. 
Despite its downer colors, the work has energy and bristles with sotto voce 
asides including everything from dirty jokes to an implication that American 
society can be -- in its way -- just as oppressive as the U.S.S.R. 
</P>
<P>
The boys appear like a couple of puppies into everything from vintage kid 
photos to John Cage, but while they are romping around they're also deflating 
all the forbidden icons: politics, religion and sex. One work suggests that all 
three are forms of seduction and all seduction is propaganda. "A Bright and 
Lofty Goal" shows ideology as a tacky triple ceiling fixture with two bulbs 
burned out being saluted by a red-blob paranoid figure in the style of Jon 
Borofsky. 
</P>
<P>
"Portrait of Kafka" juxtaposes a comic priest, a girl with a sexy gape and a 
painted plastic bag. It cocks an eyebrow at the links between repression, 
eroticism and religion. 
</P>
<P>
After a few hints that Stalin was a pervert, they move on to their recent 
series based on a depressed New Jersey town, "Bergen Point Brass Foundry." The 
signature picture is a loosely painted image of molten metal being poured by 
workmen. The use of metallic backgrounds makes -- it seems to me -- some 
Marxist commentary about wealth and means of production, but what comes across 
is the artists' immense affection for the beat-up town and its regular-guy 
inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
If you are fussy about the way art is made, you may not be utterly enthusiastic 
about Komar and Melamid, but you can't help liking the spirit of the art. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, what unites these divers shows is the capacity of the Soviet artist 
to identify with his subject. The combination of realism and sympathy allows 
the viewer access to the same spirit, so the work has a quality conspicuously 
lacking in our contemporary art. All of it -- even the bedizened eggs -- has 
soul.

ASSESSING TELEVISION COVERAGE OF THE BAY AREA EARTHQUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A scrumptious Black Forest cake to Letofsky for his commentary. He hit almost 
every observation I made as my eyes clung to the set and my thoughts raced, 
trying to sort fact from rumor and figure out the extent of the damage in Santa 
Clara County and Oakland -- trying to convince myself that my parents and 
sister were unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
I was annoyed with the L.A. stations spending so much time explaining the 
impact the earthquake had on Southern California. True, local stations should 
report from a local angle, but in view of the fact that a major earthquake had 
occurred less than an hour before and viewers were panicking about the 
well-being of family and friends, was it really important to interrupt Bay Area 
coverage to tell us where in Southern California the earthquake was felt?

FACES . . .: PROFESSIONAL PASSION

<TEXT>
<P>
When Peter Berg moved to Hollywood two years ago, it never occurred to him that 
he might have to struggle to become a successful actor. So he's not surprised 
that in such a relatively short time, he has been able to land a number of 
roles, including leads in both Wes Craven's current "Shocker" and the 
independent feature "Race for Glory," which opens next week. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been confident," says Berg, 27, who got the acting bug soon after 
college and did "dozens of plays" while studying for his degree in theater arts 
and theater history from Minnesota's Macalester College. "I spent a lot of time 
studying and preparing to work professionally. I had a lot of strong things 
going on inside of me and it exploded and I got a lot of work right away." 
</P>
<P>
Berg's first roles were guest spots on the TV shows "21 Jump Street," "O'Hara" 
and "Beverly Hills Buntz." He then went through about 20 auditions before 
landing a lead in "Never on Tuesday," which was released on videocassette this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
Berg says it is his passion for acting that helps him to land his roles. "I 
have a tremendous amount of energy and drive and desire, and I power myself 
into jobs," says the outspoken Berg. "And I never want to lose that. To keep 
that passion strong is one of the hardest things to do as an actor -- 
especially in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
In search of that passion, when working on "Shocker," in which he plays a high 
school football star who establishes a telepathic connection with a mass 
murderer, Berg closely followed and even attended the trial of "Night Stalker" 
Richard Ramirez, "to keep the immediacy of the pain and the horror of a serial 
killer." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his success in landing his roles in "Shocker" and "Race for Glory" (in 
which he plays a motorcycle engineer who builds a grand prix motorcycle), Berg 
knows that the battle is still uphill. SHAUNA SNOW

KJOI'S FORMAT CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm sure I'm not alone in protesting KJOI-FM's format change to soft vocals and 
light jazz ("KJOI to Drop Easy-Listening Format Sunday," Claudia Puig, Oct. 
18). 
</P>
<P>
What the station's research apparently didn't disclose was that a major reason 
the "easy listening" format was so successful was that it provided the 
(typically car-bound) listener an audio environment that fostered a sense of 
ease, even reverie; sounds that were not necessarily intrusive. 
</P>
<P>
I hope executives of the profitable station will soon be reminded of a lesson 
learned by the Coca-Cola Co., which also tampered with a successful product on 
the basis of misguided market research.

'BREAKING THE CODE" SENDS A MIXED MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As suits a play about a cryptographer, Hugh Whitemore's "Breaking the Code" at 
South Coast Repertory has a double-edged title. It is based on the life of Alan 
Turing, a brilliant British researcher who succeeded in breaking the Nazi code 
in World War II, saving thousands of British lives. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Turing was also a breaker of the code against homosexuality. 
And when he got into trouble with the law after the war, his usefulness to the 
government ceased. He died at the age of 42, after eating an apple dusted with 
cyanide. 
</P>
<P>
A strange death. Perhaps it was a symbolic suicide, with ironic references to 
Snow White's poisoned apple and the fatal fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. But 
it also could have been an accident. Turing kept cyanide around the house for 
experiments, and never bothered to wash his hands. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan McMurtry bites into the apple with relish at SCR, but the actor 
doesn't necessarily suggest that Turing means this as a last gesture of 
defiance to a world that insisted he conform. All we can say is that by this 
time in his life, Turing has learned to appreciate the moment, rather than 
theorize about it. 
</P>
<P>
This is a victory, as is the preceding scene where McMurtry fixes a radio for a 
Greek youth (James Nardini) with whom he has just made love. Finally, our 
hero's soul has caught up with his body, after years of haunting it like a 
ghost in a rusty set of armor. 
</P>
<P>
Interesting -- but is this what Whitemore's play wants to say? Here, just as 
when Derek Jacobi starred in the play on Broadway (no more convincingly than 
McMurtry does), the play puts out a decidedly mixed message. 
</P>
<P>
The final scenes seem to chronicle Turing's disgrace and defeat -- his 
expulsion from the research community after being convicted for having 
interfered with the morals of a far-from-innocent youth (John K. Linton). 
</P>
<P>
But the strongest emotion from the stage is Turing's relief at being freed from 
the rigidity of small-thinking people, even such noble ones as his former 
research chief (Dennis Robertson). 
</P>
<P>
The unexpected lightness of being, when one no longer has to encourage the 
world in its illusions about one's identity! Our hero has also finally forged a 
connection with his mother, a woman (Patricia Fraser) who had dedicated her 
life to not looking the facts in the face. Though lost to the world, this is a 
man who has found himself. 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, should he commit suicide? If the viewer could be sure that "Breaking 
the Code" intends such questions, it would pass for a extremely skillful play. 
In fact, one isn't at all sure that Whitemore didn't intend his script as a 
straightforward study of sexual persecution -- an intention that got blurred as 
he came to appreciate the complexity of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Scene by scene, the story plays effectively, but in the end we seem to be 
trying to have it both ways -- Turing as the victim of an unjust social code, 
and Turing as the victor over the body-soul duality. We end in a slight muddle, 
knowing only that we've seen another well-judged South Coast Repertory 
production, this one staged by Martin Benson. 
</P>
<P>
SCR has a penchant for the "civilized" English play, the play where all the 
characters know how to put a sentence together. Set in a world of schools and 
research labs, "Breaking the Code" presents a world where ideas matter and 
where "codes" are to be lived up to -- Hal Landon Jr.'s detective is no 
hire-and-salary cop, but a man who takes his profession seriously. 
</P>
<P>
They all do -- including Fraser as Turing's mother, her profession being that 
of the eternally wide-eyed hostess. It is hard for American actors to get this 
milieu right, but Benson's cast does so, catching both their humanity and the 
cruelty when someone has declared himself loyal to another code. 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry is the center of the evening, and he doesn't miss anything in his 
analysis of Turing, including his emotional level, which is that of a 
4-year-old who will have his way. Can that mind-set coexist with a brain so 
keen that it can solve a fiendishly difficult enemy code almost by intuition? 
</P>
<P>
It can, and it often does. This is a definitive portrayal of the 
academic-as-mutant, and there's not a moment where McMurtry loses sight of 
where he wants to go with the role. But Whitemore hasn't quite provided the 
information needed to send us home knowing what to think of the strange, sad, 
victorious life of Alan Turing. His code remains unbroken. 
</P>
<P>

POP BEAT: ADVICE FROM A HIT MAKER: AVOID TRENDS; 
</P>
<P>
POP: SONGWRITERS EXPO PANELIST DIANE WARREN CAN NAME THAT TUNE BECAUSE SHE 
PROBABLY WROTE IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH KLEID

<TEXT>
<P>
Diane Warren excitedly changed stations on the radio in her cluttered 
songwriting studio in Hollywood. She stopped at the Milli Vanilli hit "Blame It 
on the Rain." 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I'd find one somewhere," she said. Turning the dial again, she paused 
after hearing "When I See You Smile" by Bad English. Still another turn and 
Warren started to belt out "If I Could Turn Back Time," her throaty voice 
chiming in with Cher. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing. At any given time these days, I can find at least one of my 
songs on the radio," she said with a broad grin after finding three. "The other 
day I was driving and I found four on at the same time. I almost crashed the 
car." 
</P>
<P>
At 33, Warren is by most measures the most successful songwriter in pop at the 
moment. She wrote six of the top 100 songs on this week's Billboard magazine 
singles chart and co-wrote a seventh ("Just Like Jesse James" -- co-written by 
Desmond Child). That makes her the big name at this weekend's Los Angeles 
Songwriters Showcase Expo at the Pasadena Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
A Showcase graduate, she will be on the "Hitsmiths" panel at 3 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing her songs on the radio is nothing new to Warren, who has had 15 U.S. 
Top 40 hits since her first breakthrough, DeBarge's "Rhythm of the Night" in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
The bulletin boards she uses to keep track of projects past and present 
spotlight the varied artists who've benefited from her songs: Patti LaBelle, 
Aretha Franklin and Barbra Streisand, Chicago, Belinda Carlisle. 
</P>
<P>
Warren grew up in the San Fernando Valley, dreaming of being a songwriter. "I 
was a radio addict when I was a kid," she said, recalling the hours she spent 
listening to Motown records and the Beatles. "Those songs trained me." 
</P>
<P>
The radio was not the only thing that trained Warren. She started attending the 
weekly Los Angeles Songwriters Showcase meetings when she was 14. (The group -- 
which sponsors this weekend's expo -- still holds weekly evaluation meetings, 
open to anyone, at 7 p.m. Wednesdays at Gio's on 7574 Sunset Blvd., Hollywood. 
There's a $7 charge for members, $10 for non-members. Information: (213) 
654-1665) 
</P>
<P>
"I would go there one night a week with about 10 songs, get shot down, and come 
back the next week with about 10 more," Warren recalled. "But it was good 
because they were the first people I met that gave me feedback on my songs, and 
they helped me make connections." 
</P>
<P>
Warren still shows her loyalty to the showcase. 
</P>
<P>
What does she tell her proteges? 
</P>
<P>
"Not to quit. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Another lesson is there is no such thing as a hot style to write in, so don't 
limit yourself to trends. The thing is to write a great song which lasts 
forever. My job as a songwriter is simple, to write good songs. I don't concern 
myself with hits. That's not up to me." 
</P>
<P>
Warren writes in a range of styles but the more personal, sadder songs are her 
favorites. "I like to write from the heart about the heart, about people and 
relationships." Her own long-term relationship is with record producer Guy 
Roche, who co-produced "If I Could Turn Back Time" with her. 
</P>
<P>
Warren likes to keep the sentimental, romantic side of her personality hidden, 
but it comes through clearly in her songs. "In person, I'm sarcastic. I like to 
have an edge. Sometimes, people who know me can't believe I can write these 
sensitive songs." 
</P>

SAN FRANCISCO REHEATS ITS KITSCHY PRODUCTION OF 'AIDA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Francisco Opera production of Verdi's almost-indestructible "Aida" was 
a kitsch monstrosity when it was new in 1981. It is a kitsch monstrosity now. 
</P>
<P>
The faces have changed. The silly frills and funny feathers, the ersatz 
Ethiopian artifacts and mock-Egyptian exotica, the traveling pillars and 
portable tombs, the stumbling dancers and bumbling armies have not. 
</P>
<P>
This is exactly how old-fashioned grand opera always looks in New Yorker 
cartoons. This is exactly how valid opera should never look if modern audiences 
are expected to take it seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The current revival, which had its first performance in the earthquake-scarred 
War Memorial Opera House on Thursday, was staged by Bruce Donnell. He kept the 
traffic moving efficiently within Douglas Schmidt's rainbow-spectacular decors. 
But he could not prevent the singers from assuming unintentionally comic 
attitudes or from looking ridiculous in Lawrence Casey's caricature costumes. 
</P>
<P>
Verdi was better represented in the pit, where Cal Stewart Kellogg -- 
remembered in Los Angeles from his salad days with the New York City Opera -- 
enforced precision while allowing some lyrical expansion to counteract the 
instant bombast. The San Francisco orchestra and chorus, which had muddled the 
same composer's "Otello" two nights earlier under Kazimierz Kord, performed 
nobly for Kellogg. 
</P>
<P>
The central singers were, to put it gently, uneven. It is difficult to assemble 
a first-rate "Aida" cast these days. Still, San Francisco ought to be able to 
do better than this. 
</P>
<P>
Making her U.S. opera debut in the title role was Sharon Sweet, an American 
soprano whose career has recently blossomed in Germany. She is a large woman -- 
those New Yorker images, again -- with a placid temperament and a reasonably 
large voice that tended on this occasion to elude control. Although her basic 
resources seemed imposing, she sounded husky much of the time, wobbly some of 
the time. She pushed her tone sharp in the great climaxes and failed to muster 
the wonted pianissimo in moments of introspection. Perhaps she was indisposed, 
or a victim of first-night nerves. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Popov, the bright-voiced, would-be heroic Radames, found himself 
physically overshadowed by the "forma divina" he adored. That wasn't his fault, 
of course, but he hardly enhanced illusions by constantly striking Mighty Mouse 
poses and stubbornly blasting his way through the role, whether the emotion of 
the moment happened to concern love, hate, pain, war or death. 
</P>
<P>
The lower voices fared better. They usually do. 
</P>
<P>
Dolora Zajick has added a k to her last name and some surface glamour to her 
persona since introducing her overpowering Amneris to Costa Mesa last year. She 
now seems to strive for a lighter, blander, more focused sound. However, she 
still rides the mighty crests of the Judgement Scene with gutsy ease. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Noble commanded the dignity and authority for a proper Amonasro, if not 
the primitive force or the expansive top notes. Kevin Langan scowled nastily 
and sang pleasantly as Ramfis. David Pittsinger played second bass competently 
as the King. 
</P>
<P>
Clark Tippet, an enlightened choreographer who has brought cheer to many a 
dreary evening at American Ballet Theatre, created an outrageous series of 
rolling-jumping-spinning-slinking divertissements that resembled low-camp 
anachronisms. Ann Marie DeAngelo served as his straight-faced tongue-in-cheeky 
mini-ballerina. 
</P>
<P>
A good time was had by some.

PRESSURE IS ON 'WITNESS' FROM KILLERS AND THE LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Manhattan meat market district is an apt metaphor for the decent working 
stiff who becomes hamburger patty for hungry U.S. Feds in tonight's "Perfect 
Witness" (HBO, 8 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the quintessential little guy (blue-collar Aidan Quinn) witnesses 
a contract killing in a bar (a brutal but effective scene featuring a grinning 
hit man played by David Cumming). Unlike the other patrons, our reluctant hero 
does the right thing and identifies the killer. 
</P>
<P>
But when Quinn's family is threatened, that's it for public duty. He changes 
his mind and refuses to cooperate with a federal grand jury investigating 
extortion in the butcher business. And the outraged, media-conscious U.S. 
attorney (a blustery, solid performance by Brian Dennehy) throws him in the 
slammer for contempt. His fellow attorney (a blond Stockard Channing, who looks 
uncomfortable in the role) objects to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
The story is allegedly based on a newspaper series in Gotham about perfect 
eyewitnesses who pay dearly for their noble deeds. The moral is disheartening: 
Keep your mouth shut. 
</P>
<P>
The writers, Terry Curtis Fox and Ron Hutchinson, strive to play both ends of 
the moral dilemma with a courtroom conclusion that mixes individual valor with 
legal deception and cynicism. The government comes off little better than the 
mob. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Dennehy's federal attorney protests that "government is force! 
It's not reason. It's not laws. It's force -- George Washington said that." 
Imagine hearing those lines in a movie during the old blacklist days. The 
writers' careers would be over. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Mandel's direction doesn't always clearly negotiate the plot 
convolutions. This 2-hour movie would race better with 30 minutes lopped off. 
But the point about pressure on the hero to overlook corruption because, as the 
killer's father tells the perfect eyewitness, "it's neighborhood," is tellingly 
made. RAY LOYND

DAY HIKE: A SHORT STROLL TO NOSTALGIA ON THE BUSH CANYON TRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY, McKinney is the author of hiking books and a regular 
contributor to The Times.

<P>
"To the Bat Cave, Robin." 
</P>
<P>
With that cry, Batman and Robin of TV fame hopped into the Batmobile and sped 
off to their hideaway. This dynamic duo's underground lair was not, as you 
might guess, a movie set built on a studio back lot, but a real cave in the 
southwest corner of Griffith Park. The little gremlins and goblins -- and their 
nostalgic baby boom parents -- will particularly enjoy the short walk to the 
Bat Cave, one of the few caves in the park. 
</P>
<P>
"Batman" was not the only TV show to make use of the area known as the Bronson 
Caves. About every Western from "Gunsmoke" to "Bonanza" used the caves as a 
hide-out for desperadoes. "Star Trek," "Mission Impossible" and many more shows 
filmed here. 
</P>
<P>
Long before movie makers discovered the caves, the rocky walls of the canyon 
were quarried by the Los Angeles Stone Co. During the early years of this 
century, the crushed rock from this quarry formed the railbed for the Pacific 
Electric Transit System. By 1915, the famous Red Car trolleys traveled from 
downtown Los Angeles to the Santa Monica Bay beach communities, to Orange 
County and San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
It was rightly characterized as the most comprehensive system of urban and 
suburban transportation in the world. Now that's something to be nostalgic 
about. In later years, the crushed stone from the quarry was used to pave such 
thoroughfares as Sunset and Wilshire boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
For the urban mountaineer wishing to escape to the wilds of Griffith Park, 
Brush Canyon Trail offers not only the short stroll to the Bat Cave but a 
moderate workout to many of the park's most popular destinations -- Captain's 
Roost, Dante's View and Mt. Hollywood. Brush Canyon Trail is much less traveled 
than other routes to Mt. Hollywood and offers the same great clear-day views of 
the metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to trailhead: Your task is to enter Griffith Park from the south. 
The basic idea is to get to Franklin Avenue in Hollywood and travel to a point 
midway between Vine and Western. You can exit the Hollywood Freeway (U.S. 101) 
in Hollywood on Gower Street, cut over to Franklin Avenue and travel east to 
this point, or exit the Santa Monica Freeway on Western Avenue and travel north 
all the way across town to Franklin, then turn west. 
</P>
<P>
From Franklin Avenue, turn north on Bronson Avenue or Canyon Drive (the streets 
soon join and continue as Canyon). Follow Canyon Drive a winding mile through 
the Hollywood Hills into Griffith Park. You can park alongside the road near a 
picnic area or in a small parking lot by the trailhead at road's end. 
</P>
<P>
The Hike: Those heading directly for the Bat Cave will look to the right (east) 
side of Canyon Drive for a red wall, a white pipe gate and a Griffith Park 
locater sign that reads "49." You'll join a fire road and head south a short 
distance to the Bronson Caves. Heed the "No Climbing" signs on the steep canyon 
walls above the caves. 
</P>
<P>
Those hikers bound for Mt. Hollywood will join the unsigned fire road (Brush 
Canyon Trail) at the end of Canyon Drive. The lower stretch of this trail is 
popular with local dogs and dog walkers. During the 1940s, Dog World magazine 
proclaimed Hollywood "the doggiest area in California." Judging by the number 
of exercising canines and owners on this trail, perhaps it still is. 
</P>
<P>
The trail passes some handsome sycamores that line the canyon bottom. The 
sycamores, cloaked in yellow, brown and rust-colored leaves, provide a welcome 
burst of autumn color. Who says you can't detect the change of the seasons in 
Southern California? 
</P>
<P>
However, once the trail begins climbing northeast out of the canyon bottom and 
leaves the trees behind, Brush Canyon begins to live up to its name. The sweet 
licorice smell of fennel perfumes the air, and the toyon (Christmas berry) is 
already starting to display its red berries. This festive plant is also known 
as California holly; some believe that masses of this native shrub growing on 
the hills above Hollywood gave the community its name. 
</P>
<P>
A mile's walk from the trailhead brings you to an unsigned junction with 
Mulholland Trail. Head right and ascend to a turnout alongside Mt. Hollywood 
Drive. Turn left, walk a short distance along Mt. Hollywood Drive and rejoin 
Mulholland Trail on your right. 
</P>
<P>
After a short ascent up Mt. Bell, Mulholland Trail will continue east around 
the mountain, but you'll bear right on a narrower trail. From 
graffiti-splattered Water Tower No. 52, you'll join a narrow footpath and 
descend first moderately, then steeply, to a junction with Mt. Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Junctions with various fire roads let you head toward Dante's View or Captain's 
Roost, but Mt. Hollywood-bound hikers will head straight for the picnic tables 
atop the 1,625-foot peak. Wonderful sunrises and sunsets can be observed from 
the park's highest peak, and on clear days the entire basin is spread out 
before you, from the San Gabriel Mountains to the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Most hikers will want to return the same way. The very experienced, armed with 
a good park map, can use Mt. Hollywood Trail and the extremely steep and 
washed-out trail dropping southwest off Mt. Hollywood Drive to make a loop trip 
back down to the caves and Canyon Drive.

FAMILY SPOT: BOAT SHOW AT MUSEUM IS A MODEL OF PERFECTION 
</P>

The remote-controlled boats in the channel next to the L.A. Maritime Museum 
this weekend are definitely not those little $19.95 kit models. No way. This is 
serious stuff. These are one-of-a-kind boats ("scratch boats" in model-boat 
parlance) and they cost $300 and up. Most are 4-5 feet long: tugs, fishing 
boats, steam wheelers and more. 
</P>
<P>
Model Boat Clubs of Southern California is sponsoring this two-day 
Radio-Controlled Model Boat Show at the museum. It's a chance for local 
builders to show off the fruits of their long labors. The boats will be on 
display inside the museum for close inspection of the intricate handwork 
involved and then taken outside to the channel for maneuvers. Some squirt water 
and have whistles. Boat builders and operators will be available to answer 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
Save time to explore the museum itself. The exhibits include 15-foot cutaways 
of the Titanic and Lusitania as well as more than 200 boats of all 
descriptions. The museum is at Berth 84, at the foot of 6th Street, San Pedro. 
Show hours today and Sunday are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Donations of $1 are requested 
in lieu of admission. Information: (213) 548-7618.

SANTA MONICA AIRPORT CHIEF WANTS BAN ON EXPERIMENTALS; 
</P>
<P>
AVIATION: FAA IS ASKED FOR A RULING AFTER THURSDAY'S CRASH OF A HOME-BUILT 
PLANE INTO A HOME. 
</P>

<P>
A day after the fiery crash of an experimental airplane in Santa Monica, the 
director of the Santa Monica Airport on Friday asked the Federal Aviation 
Administration to determine whether the airport could ban experimental aircraft 
from its runways. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the the administrator of the FAA's Western Pacific Region, 
airport director Hank Dittmar also asked the agency to investigate Thursday's 
crash of the home-built, single-engine plane that damaged one West Los Angeles 
home, set fire to another and injured a passenger. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the hot seat," Dittmar said in an interview Friday. "We're looking to 
see if it is appropriate for these aircraft to be restricted in metropolitan 
areas. It may be appropriate (for them to fly) in the desert, but not in a 
region with 7 million people." 
</P>
<P>
Dittmar said Santa Monica is investigating the airport's options. The airport 
is seeking the FAA's ruling on whether it can ban experimental aircraft because 
federal law prohibits flight facilities from "regulating the type of aircraft 
that may use the airport." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Rep. Mel Levine (D-Los Angeles) also announced Friday that he planned to 
investigate why the Wheeler Express aircraft lost power and crashed. "The 
residents of Santa Monica and Los Angeles have the right to expect that all 
aircraft flying in and out of Santa Monica Airport have been rigorously checked 
during and after construction," Levine said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's crash was the fourth at the airport since July. Nationwide, there 
have been 70 accidents since October, 1988, involving experimental aircraft, 
according to the National Transportation Safety Board. There have been 12 such 
accidents in California. 
</P>
<P>
However, the manufacturer of the plane insisted that concern about experimental 
models is unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Experimental' is a misnomer," said Ken Wheeler, president of the 
Washington-based Wheeler Aircraft Co. "The experimental planes are not 
inherently unsafe. The last statistics I heard showed that the experimental 
planes were . . . equally as safe as commercial planes." 
</P>
<P>
Planes are judged experimental by the FAA if a private builder assembles more 
than half of the aircraft. There are currently more than 15,000 such aircraft 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for the do-it-yourself experimental kits range from $5,000 to $100,000, 
said officials at the Experimental Aircraft Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just the frame," said John Burton, a spokesman for the Wisconsin-based 
group. "Once you put the engine, propeller and instruments in, you will have 
spent a lot more money." 
</P>
<P>
Experimental models must pass FAA safety checks as rigorous as those given 
commercial jets, Burton said. They must also be tested in rural areas for at 
least 50 hours before they can be flown into and out of city airports, said a 
spokesman for the Santa Monica Airport Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"People have to realize that the builder of the experimental plane has a vested 
interest in the safety of it," Burton said. "He's going to go the extra mile to 
make sure that it's safe. In some cases, they are safer than commercial 
planes." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to sparking concern over the experimental planes, Thursday's crash 
also appeared to revive general public opposition to operation of the Santa 
Monica Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"The airport must be closed," said Thomas Kirwan, 63, a retired aerospace 
engineer. "We can't live with it and there's no reason we should. That airport 
is a criminal outrage." 
</P>
<P>
Kirwan complained that some private pilots flying out of the airport "totally 
disregard" rules governing takeoff corridors and fly over homes, instead of 
using prescribed routes. 
</P>
<P>
Not all residents favor shutting down the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Harris, owner of one of the homes damaged in Thursday's crash, said that 
she does not oppose the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lived here for 40 years and nothing like this has ever happened to me," 
she said. "The airport has had a very good record." 
</P>
<P>
The airport, located in the southeast corner of Santa Monica, borders the Los 
Angeles neighborhoods of Palms and Culver City. It is used primarily by small 
private planes, executive jets, news helicopters and student pilots. 
</P>
<P>
It has been the center of legal battles for decades. Residents once sued to 
close the airport. Pilots also brought suit, claiming that Santa Monica had 
exceeded its jurisdiction by trying to restrict air traffic. The controversy 
peaked in the late 1970s and early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
A compromise was reached in 1984, after years of negotiation. Under its terms, 
Santa Monica agreed to keep the airport open until at least the year 2015 to 
appease the pilots and the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
To appease the homeowners, Santa Monica agreed to consolidate airport 
facilities on the north side of the 215-acre property and to enforce anti-noise 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the battle rages on. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's easy to say that most people would prefer not to have the 
airport," artist Denise DuBroy said. "There's a lot of people who have been 
beaten down by the system and understand the bureaucracy involved. But others 
are up for the fight."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OFFICIALS URGE DRUG DESIGNATION FOR COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 25 area officials Friday joined Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton) in 
calling on President Bush and national drug czar William J. Bennett to give Los 
Angeles County a greater share of money going to local jurisdictions under 
Bush's drug-fighting plan. 
</P>
<P>
If the Administration fails to designate Los Angeles County as a 
"high-intensity drug trafficking area" it may get less money than other cities 
around the country, Dymally and the local officials said at a news conference 
the congressman organized at Compton City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional representatives, police chiefs, county supervisors and other 
officials have been lobbying Bush and Bennett to grant Los Angeles the 
designation, arguing that it has become the largest drug importing and 
distribution center in the United States and has never gotten its fair share of 
federal drug enforcement dollars. So far, the administration has not announced 
which cities will get the designation, which brings with it extra drug-fighting 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
Dymally and other House Democrats also have charged that the state of 
California will get only $52 million under Bush's drug plan but that federal 
budget cuts in other areas such as juvenile justice will cost the state more 
than $200 million this year.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AILING CHIEF OF POLICE COULD BE OUT FOR 
MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pasadena Police Chief James M. Robenson, 57, announced Friday that he will take 
an extended medical leave beginning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing high blood pressure and the stress of 14-hour days overseeing 
Pasadena's 220 sworn officers have caused him to develop heart problems, 
Robenson said. The leave could last for months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
During his absence, Cmdr. Bruce Philpott will take over day-to-day operations 
as acting police chief. But Robenson said he will continue to make decisions on 
promotions and will oversee the department's move into the new $18.9-million 
police building, scheduled in March.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FREE FLU SHOTS OFFERED TO RESIDENTS OVER 55 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services is offering free flu shots 
to county residents 55 and older through Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
The shots will be offered through local senior citizens centers and county 
health centers and clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Stephen H. Waterman, the county's chief of Acute Communicable Disease 
Control, recommended the shots to senior citizens and younger people who have 
heart and lung conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Waterman said that people who receive the shots could still contract the flu, 
but symptoms would be milder. 
</P>
<P>
The health department also recommends that people over 65 receive pneumococcal 
immunizations, of which only one is needed in a lifetime. Senior citizens are 
advised to check with the health department to find the location of the nearest 
clinic offering those immunizations.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: QUARANTINE AREA ENLARGED FOR ORIENTAL FRUIT 
FLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The federal government on Friday expanded the size of an agricultural 
quarantine area in Los Angeles County by 70 square miles because of the 
discovery of more Oriental fruit flies, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The quarantine restricts shipment of fruits and vegetables. Oriental fruit 
flies can damage 200 types of citrus fruits, vegetables, nuts and berries but 
do not pose the same danger as the Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
A 79-square-mile portion of Los Angeles and Orange counties was put under a 
federal agricultural quarantine Sept. 19 after the discovery of six Oriental 
fruit flies. 
</P>
<P>
The 70-square-mile area is being added to the quarantine "in response to 
additional flies being found in the county," said Larry Slagle of the Animal 
and Plant Health Inspection Service. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that inspectors have found six Oriental fruit flies in the Elysian Park 
area since Oct. 4, he added: "We need to prevent further spread of the pest."

HINDU 'FESTIVAL OF LIGHTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Divali, also spelled Dipawali, will be observed Sunday by Hindus. Called the 
"festival of lights," it culminates a festive period of nearly two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
TRADITION: Although Hinduism varies in traditions and celebrations according to 
regional and language differences, most Hindus consider Lakshmi, the goddess of 
prosperity, as the main patroness of the festival. Merchants, for whom the 
holiday is especially important, begin their new year from this point. 
</P>
<P>
OBSERVANCES: The central ritual is the lighting of lamps and lights inside and 
outside homes. A temporary altar containing symbols of wealth -- coins, 
ornaments and shells -- is built to welcome Lakshmi inside one's home. Gifts of 
candy and other sweets are exchanged. Rites will be performed at most Hindu 
temples today and Sunday.

2 DIOCESES IN CONTRAST ON LATINO OUTREACH; 
</P>
<P>
IMMIGRANTS: SAN DIEGO HAS BEEN MORE MUTED THAN LOS ANGELES, BUT A NEW FOCUS IS 
EXPECTED AFTER A CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roman Catholic bishops often vary in their approaches to issues, but on the 
question of immigration the contrasts between church leaders in San Diego and 
Los Angeles have been vivid. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Archbishop Roger M. Mahony has reached out extensively to the 
Spanish-speaking immigrant community, even holding a huge Mass in their honor 
at Dodger Stadium in 1986. Mahony, who speaks fluent Spanish, has been at the 
national forefront of immigrant issues, openly criticizing U.S. immigration 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego does not have nearly the Spanish-speaking population of Los Angeles, 
but it is estimated that Latinos constitute one-quarter to one-half of all 
Catholics in the area. Moreover, the region has become perhaps the world's 
busiest migratory corridor, traversed by hundreds of thousands of legal and 
illegal immigrants annually -- the great majority of them Spanish-speaking and 
Roman Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
But, in contrast to Mahony, Bishop Leo T. Maher, spiritual leader of the church 
in San Diego for two decades, has not pronounced a direct church mandate on the 
issue of immigration. Instead, he has largely remained in the background. 
</P>
<P>
"There has not been from Bishop Maher a very overt effort on behalf of the 
immigrants," said Ozvaldo Venzor, an Encinitas Catholic who heads a group 
called Friends of the Undocumented. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Maher said he is thoroughly committed to the migrant issue, but 
he noted that the church faces financial limits. He denied that he has been 
unresponsive. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've done a super job," Maher said. "We're trying to do it parish by 
parish; that's where the action is. . . . We're doing the best we can. I don't 
think there's anything else we can do right now. . . . If you want to satisfy 
everybody, you have to be Christ himself." 
</P>
<P>
The diocese's focus could be different after July 1 when Bishop Robert H. Brom 
is scheduled to succeed Maher, who will reach the retirement age of 75. 
</P>
<P>
Brom has already signaled some changes. For example, at ceremonies marking his 
appointment last summer, the former bishop of Duluth, Minn., spoke partly in 
Spanish and stressed the importance of Latinos. He also appears less interested 
in pomp and ceremony than Maher; he has been living in an apartment, eschewing 
a diocese-purchased, half-million-dollar home. Brom is in Mexico studying 
Spanish. Maher has limited command of the language. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, observers said Maher's ambivalent approach to the immigration 
issue has meant that the church's vast resources have often been channeled in 
other directions -- the much-publicized St. Vincent de Paul Joan Kroc Center 
for the homeless being a notable example -- and not directed to migrants. And, 
with the exception of several activist parishes, lay people and clerics alike 
have generally felt little urgency to become engaged with the immigrant 
community. 
</P>
<P>
If local priests and parishioners want to get involved in migrant-assistance 
issues -- conducting Masses, food giveaways and other activities in the fields 
-- the bishop has not gotten in the way. But he has not been "front and center 
on immigration," in the words of one Carlsbad Catholic who has been active on 
behalf of migrants. 
</P>
<P>
A number of parishes -- notably St. Patrick's in Carlsbad, Mission San Luis Rey 
in Oceanside and Our Lady of Mt. Carmel in Rancho Penasquitos -- have been 
quite active in assisting the thousands of homeless migrant workers who live in 
northern San Diego County. But "it's pretty much on a parish-by-parish basis," 
said Father Douglas Regin, pastor of St. Francis Church in Vista who served for 
nine years as executive director of Catholic Community Services, the church's 
social service arm. "I would say that the bishop does not have an extensive 
outreach program for migrant workers." 
</P>
<P>
Even Maher's detractors credit Catholic Community Services with considerable 
success during its 1987-88 sign-up of about 27,000 amnesty-seeking undocumented 
immigrants, a number that accounts for more than one-quarter of all 
legalization applicants in San Diego and Imperial counties. That program, 
however, is almost exclusively funded by grants and fees and not by diocesan 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the plight of migrant field hands in North County, the bishop noted 
that last April 28 he issued a statement bemoaning their "deplorable" 
conditions and urging Catholics to help. 
</P>
<P>
But Venzor and others said that Maher's commentary, which came after both the 
U.S. Council of Bishops and the Vatican expressed concern about migrant workers 
worldwide, was long overdue, considering the massive scope of the problem 
within the diocese and the growing tensions in some areas. The issue of 
migrants has become so visible to the church hierarchy, in fact, that Pope John 
Paul II is considering visiting Tijuana during his scheduled trip to Mexico 
next year.

BISHOP QUITS COLORADO FOR EASTERN SEMINARY

Episcopal Bishop William C. Frey has shocked members of the Colorado religious 
community with news that he is leaving to take the helm of a small, financially 
troubled seminary in a former steel town near Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Frey has been a leading voice in Colorado since he was named bishop nearly 17 
years ago and was one of four candidates in 1985 to become the Episcopal 
Church's top bishop nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
He leaves the episcopacy more than a dozen years before the mandatory 
retirement age of 72 to become dean of Trinity Episcopal School for Ministry in 
Ambridge, Pa., an evangelical school of about 70 students where one of his sons 
is a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview at St. Stephen's Church in suburban Aurora, Frey said he 
agonized over the decision to leave his position and called the time he spent 
considering the offer 24 hours "of the worst depression I've ever gone 
through." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, he decided to take the job "because of a sense of vocation." 
</P>
<P>
"I felt a call," explained the bishop, who prefers to be addressed simply as 
Bill. "It just came from left field." 
</P>
<P>
Frey called Trinity "the Cinderella of American seminaries," noting that it is 
"poor, new, in an abandoned steel town and has offices in a converted Safeway 
building with no air-conditioning and classes in a former Presbyterian church." 
</P>
<P>
The bishop said he will probably begin his new job in the fall of 1990 after 
relocation to Pennsylvania in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
Frey is an evangelical and charismatic who believes in speaking in tongues. And 
he believes abortion is homicide. But he has a distinctively liberal side also 
and has been denounced by church conservatives for his opposition to the 
nuclear arms race, capital punishment and the proliferation of handguns. 
</P>
<P>
On the divisive issues of ordination of women and revision of the Book of 
Common Prayer, Bishop Frey has sided with liberals.

Parents should decide one faith for children of Christian-Jewish marriages, 
according to the director of an outreach program for intermarried couples of 
the Reform Jewish movement. 
</P>
<P>
The tendency among parents in interfaith marriages is "to choose everything for 
their children except their religion," Lydia Kukoff of Los Angeles said at a 
recent panel discussion sponsored by the American Psychological Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"The reluctance of mixed couples to decide on one faith for their child, or 
their announcement that they will 'expose the child to both faiths and let the 
child decide,' masks a dangerous ambivalence," said Kukoff, director of the 
Joint Commission on Outreach of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and 
the Central Conference of American Rabbis. 
</P>
<P>
"And it places the child in the extremely difficult position of choosing one 
parent over the other, something to be avoided wherever possible."

Candlestick Park Friday arrived early, shook hands, and then sang and danced in 
celebration of life and their San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland Athletics, on the other hand, arrived late, and played catch 
throughout the pregame ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
Then they threw out their chests, challenging, intimidating and ultimately 
dismantling the Giants with a record-tying five home runs en route to a 13-7 
Game 3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the game I told (winning pitcher pitcher Dave) Stewart that we were 
going to get 10 runs," A's outfielder Rickey Henderson said afterward. "OK, so 
we didn't get 10." 
</P>
<P>
What might be one of history's best Series teams has taken a historically 
insurmountable three-games-to-none lead. In the 85 previous Series, no team has 
come back from such a deficit to win. 
</P>
<P>
The A's could wash their hands of the Giants and celebrate their first World 
Series title since 1974 as soon as tonight. 
</P>
<P>
In Game 4, which begins at 5:30, Oakland will have Mike Moore, who already has 
one Series win, facing Don Robinson, who, despite a sore right knee, will be 
making his first postseason start. 
</P>
<P>
It would be the first Series sweep since the Cincinnati Reds defeated the New 
York Yankees in four games in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Said Rickey Henderson: "I hope we get it in four. If we don't, we feel for sure 
we will get it by Sunday. No way is this team going to beat us in four 
straight." 
</P>
<P>
That would appear to be a fair assessment. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Henderson had two homers Friday night, doing an arms-down dance around the 
bases after each. He missed hitting a third by one inch when his first-inning 
blast to right hit the top of the fence. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Canseco, who screamed at pitcher Scott Garrelts in the first inning after 
a high inside pitch, homered in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Carney Lansford homered in the sixth and tied a Series record with four runs 
scored. 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Henderson, while he didn't homer, might have caused a homer by dancing 
off second base for about five minutes in the fifth inning. It distracted 
pitcher Kelly Downs enough that he threw Canseco a hanging slider down the 
middle, which Canseco lined over the left-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart pitched seven good innings and won his second Series game. He finished 
strong. Of his 90 pitches, he needed just 29 to get through his last three 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants had a four-run ninth inning, highlighted by a three-run homer from 
seldomly used pinch-hitter Bill Bathe and an RBI single by reserve Greg Litton. 
</P>
<P>
But the main thing accomplished in the ninth was the setting of a Series record 
of seven total homers in game. Matt Williams hit the Giants' other homer in the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants have been outscored 23-8, outhit 32-19, and have a team batting 
average of .199and a team earned-run average of 7.92. 
</P>
<P>
This is a team that now wishes this were delayed longer than a record 10 days 
because of the earthquake. Delayed, maybe, until spring? 
</P>
<P>
"It would have to be a long, long delay," Oakland outfielder Dave Parker said. 
"This team could come back two months from now and look just as good." 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden," Giant slugger Will Clark said, "we're at the end of our 
line." 
</P>
<P>
The A's, in what was perceived by some Giants as an insult, haughtily skipped 
town earlier this week to train for two days in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
"That might have made a difference," Rickey Henderson said. "We got there and 
didn't have to worry about anything." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants perhaps perceived another insult before Friday's game, when the A's 
disregarded all traffic reports and didn't leave their Oakland Coliseum until 
1:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
A normal 45-minute trip took them as long as a flight from here to Phoenix -- 1 
hour 40 minutes -- and their buses arrived at Candlestick just three minutes 
before the scheduled 3:25 p.m. start of their batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
So the A's were forced to skip infield practice, and then they played catch in 
front of their dugout while the fans emotionally sang the city's anthem "San 
Francisco" and then applauded city rescue workers and service organizations for 
their assistance last week. 
</P>
<P>
Once the game got under way, the fans struck back, starting with Canseco. 
</P>
<P>
"There was this 60-year-old lady up in the stands who was shouting all kinds of 
insults at me, right from the beginning," said Canseco, who entered the game 
hitless in his previous 23 Series at-bats. "That really irritated me, and got 
my blood going." 
</P>
<P>
That blood boiled in the first inning, when Garrelts second pitch to Canseco 
nearly beaned him. After jerking his head out of the way at the last minute, 
Canseco screamed a curse word at Garrelts . . . and then singled to left field 
to break his streak. 
</P>
<P>
"That woke me up," Canseco said. "That woke all of us up." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Henderson delivered the first big blast with his first-inning, two-run 
double off the top of the right-field wall. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the hardest ball I hit all night," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After the double, Rickey Henderson said Dave returned to the dugout and said, 
"I'm feeling good tonight. The ball is carrying." 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, after Matt Williams' homer off Stewart made it 2-1, Dave Henderson 
and Tony Phillips homered off Garrelts in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants countered with two in the bottom of the fourth and could have had 
more but for the Series top defensive play -- a belly-flopping Mark McGwire 
stop of a Pat Sheridan grounder with two out and runners on first and second. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan's shot followed a two-run single by Terry Kennedy, who made Stewart 
pay for giving up back-to-back singles by Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell and 
then walking Ken Oberkfell on four itches. 
</P>
<P>
There was a reminder of last week's earthquake when, in the ninth inning, the 
lights above the right-center field stands went dark. Fans in that area, 
followed by fans throughout the stadium, showed their preparedness by pulling 
out and waving flashlights. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, things didn't look too bright for the Giants Friday night.

USC EAGER TO BOUNCE BACK AGAINST CARDINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Finally, a game. 
</P>
<P>
After a week of soothing their wounds, defending their conduct and reassessing 
their season, after seven days of charges and countercharges concerning their 
bitter defeat at Notre Dame and the brawl that preceded it, the USC Trojans get 
a chance to take their frustrations out to the field when they return to the 
Coliseum today to play Stanford at 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Just what the Cardinal needs. Deep into its own season of frustration, Stanford 
finds itself facing a team that figures to be chomping at the bit and looking 
for revenge after a painful knockdown. 
</P>
<P>
This was a season that began with high hopes for Stanford, before the roof 
caved in. 
</P>
<P>
Figuratively and literally. 
</P>
<P>
Although Stanford was coming off a 3-6-2 season, the hiring of Dennis Green, 
former San Francisco 49er assistant, as coach created excitement and optimism 
on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the losses, both on the field and on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
Among the injured are: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Running back Jon Volpe. All-Pac-10 last season, he remains out with a 
sprained ankle, suffered in Stanford's second game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Anticipated starter Charlie Young, another running back. He suffered a knee 
injury in spring practice and is out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Halfback J.J. Lasley. Having sprained a knee a month ago, he may play 
today, but won't start. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Linebacker Rob Hinckley. Bothered by a lower back problem, he has been at 
full strength in only one game. He's questionable today. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Quarterback Brian Johnson. Suffering from shoulder and knee injuries, he 
did not make the trip. Although redshirt freshman Steve Smith has started six 
games for Stanford, Johnson was the starter in the Cardinal's only victory, an 
18-17 win over Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Offensive lineman Chris Dalman. He suffered a season-ending neck injury 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Free safety Tony Trousett. He started the first five games before going 
down with a season-ending knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Defensive tackle Lester Archambeau. He will be playing today on a bad knee. 
</P>
<P>
The troubles in the training room were followed by troubles on the field. 
Stanford has lost three of four conference games, six of seven overall. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been in five football games that have come down to the last series of 
the game," Green said. "When you play 60 minutes, there's about two or three 
minutes where one team or the other has the opportunity to take charge. That's 
what we haven't done and that's been the most significant thing that has hurt 
us. A lot of that is experience, a lot of it is learning and a lot of it is 
developing a certain leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Todd Marinovich has compensated for his lack of seasoning with talent, 
surprising maturity and a balanced attack to lead USC to five wins in seven 
games, a 3-0 record in conference play and to the brink of victory over 
top-ranked Notre Dame last week in South Bend, Ind. He has come up lacking on 
occasion, as he did last week where three key passes were intercepted, but he 
has never lacked for confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure? If Marinovich feels it, he's a good actor. How many other freshmen 
would deliberately bump an opposing lineman on the defending national 
championship team in defiance after throwing a touchdown pass as Marinovich did 
last week in South Bend? 
</P>
<P>
Smith hasn't exactly been shy with a ball in his hands, either. He has 
completed 56.4% of his passes for 1,214 yards and seven touchdowns in 
Stanford's pass-oriented attack, but he has also thrown nine interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Steve has made a significant amount of improvement," Green said. "He 
suffers from two things. No. 1 is our inability to have a halfback attack. That 
could take a lot of pressure off. The other thing is, we haven't been throwing 
the ball very much to our halfbacks. That's put more pressure on our split end, 
Ed McCaffrey, and I think Steve has forced the ball a little too much. But I 
think he definitely has a big-time arm." 
</P>
<P>
Just ask the Irish. Against Notre Dame several weeks ago, Smith threw 68 
passes, a conference record, completing 39. 
</P>
<P>
In USC, Smith will be facing a defense that led the nation against the rush 
until facing Tony Rice and his friends in South Bend. Although their yardage 
allowed per game jumped from 36.7 to 69.4 after the Notre Dame game, the 
Trojans are still third in the nation and best in the conference against the 
rush. 
</P>
<P>
Among those trying to keep USC off Smith's back will be freshman offensive 
lineman Bob Whitfield from Banning High School. The 6-foot-7, 300-pounder has 
started all seven games and made an impression. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a whale of a football player," USC Coach Larry Smith said. "He'll be an 
All-American, I'll tell you right now. He's big and fast and strong and he does 
not get beat." 
</P>
<P>
First the injuries for Stanford, then the losses. And then, the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Damage from the Bay Area quake left 15 players, living in a dorm, homeless. 
They have since found housing. 
</P>
<P>
So has Green, who has been forced to spend several days a week in the Stanford 
area because of damage to the highway that he normally takes to reach his Santa 
Cruz home, a home that also suffered some damage. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
For the record: The letter of apology, promised by Notre Dame officials after 
last week's pregame brawl, has yet to arrive at USC. . . . Today's homecoming 
game is expected to draw a crowd of about 74,000. . . . Trojan running back 
Aaron Emanuel, recovering from a shoulder separation, will be available if 
needed. "The doctors say he could really use another week off," said Coach 
Larry Smith. . . . Tailback Scott Lockwood, out since opening night with a 
dislocated thumb, is not expected to play.

ROBITAILLE CHANGES LINES AND HELPS KINGS BEAT JETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was not the Kings' greatest offensive game of the year. But it beat their 
last one. It also helped them beat the Winnipeg Jets, 3-1, Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Only two nights earlier, the Kings had lost, 5-0, to Calgary at the Forum, the 
first time they had been shut out in 262 consecutive regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
How impotent were they? 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky, the fourth-leading goal scorer of all time in the National 
Hockey League, did not even take a shot. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning an 11-day, six-game road trip with games Friday night and Sunday 
night at the Winnipeg Arena, Coach Tom Webster figured the Kings needed more 
than a change of scenery, particularly since there is so little of that here. 
</P>
<P>
So when the team arrived at the arena for its Friday morning skate, Webster 
revealed that left winger Luc Robitaille would join the line centered by 
Gretzky. The change was not made for the benefit of Gretzky, who was the 
league's third-leading scorer this season before Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed goals from Luc," Webster said. "We thought we could get him in the 
open and let Wayne get him the puck. He's been struggling with his confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that is the reason Webster is the coach this season instead of Robbie 
Ftorek, whose frequent and frequently criticized line changes did not always 
work as well as this one. 
</P>
<P>
Robitaille scored the Kings' first two goals against the Jets, although the 
first could hardly be credited to his new line considering that it came while 
he was playing with his old partners, Bernie Nicholls and Dave Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Before Friday night, Robitaille's four goals had come on power plays. So did 
this one. Taylor made the play with a shot from the left side that bounced off 
Jet defender Randy Carlyle's skate and right to Robitaille, who had no trouble 
slipping it past goaltender Tom Draper for the game's first score with 12:55 
remaining in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg's Pat Elynuik, the right winger who leads the team in points, scored 
the equalizer 52 seconds later. But Robitaille came through for the Kings again 
with 10:42 remaining in the second. 
</P>
<P>
That one definitely should help his confidence. Playing on the line with 
Gretzky and Bob Kudelski, Robitaille received the puck at the blue line, 
feinted as if he might pass, then fired a slapshot past a bewildered Draper for 
his first even-strength goal of the season. Kudelski and Gretzky both were 
credited with assists. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've been playing my best hockey," said Robitaille, who was 
benched for a spell during the Kings' 7-4 loss Sunday at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"Things weren't going my way, and I lost my confidence. If you're not confident 
when you've got the puck, you're not going to score. But it makes a difference 
when you play with Wayne because you know you're going to get the puck if 
you're open." 
</P>
<P>
Robitaille did not take credit for the victory. He gave that to goaltender 
Kelly Hrudey, which was not a bad choice considering his 35 saves. 
</P>
<P>
"He was standing on his head tonight," Robitaille said. "He was unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
About the only mistake that Hrudey made was when he went to the wrong side of 
the arena while trying to find the Kings' bench during a second-period break. 
</P>
<P>
Webster almost doubled over in laughter. That proved to be a tension-breaker, 
which the Kings desperately needed since, at the time, they had gone four 
periods and then some without scoring. 
</P>
<P>
"This game has to be fun," said Hrudey, who had never played a game at Winnipeg 
Arena despite his more than six years of experience. "When something funny 
happens, laugh about it." 
</P>
<P>
Something funny did not happen with 2:52 remaining in the game, when Kings 
defender Steve Duchesne was called for a two-minute delay of game penalty for 
slapping the puck into the mezzanine level while trying to clear it. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a brutal call," Duchesne said. "The puck was bouncing, and I was just 
trying to get it out." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the Kings, the Jets are the worst team in the league on the 
power play. They thought they had solved their problems with three goals in six 
power-play situations in Wednesday night's 6-4 victory here over Washington. 
But they could not capitalize Friday night on three chances, including this 
one. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets and most of the 15,525 fans at the arena thought otherwise with 1:25 
remaining in the game, 33 seconds remaining in the power play, when defender 
Fredrik Olausson's shot from the left wing hit Hrudey in the shoulder and fell 
in front of the goal mouth, where there was a scrum. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Jets began celebrating, while others began pleading for the goal 
light to go on. But it never did. Hrudey was sitting on the puck. 
</P>
<P>
After killing the power play, the Kings scored the clincher with only 36 
seconds remaining. Gretzky skated down the right side, took two defenders with 
him, and then passed to an open Kudelski, whose shot beat Draper. It was 
Kudelski's team-leading eighth goal and Gretzky's team-leading 20th point. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
It would not have been unusual for these two teams to go into overtime. In 
eight meetings last season, six were tied at the end of regulation. Four 
remained that way after the overtime. 
</P>
<P>
In a 6-4 victory over Washington Wednesday night, Jet goaltender Daniel 
Berthiaume gave up four goals on the Capitals' first 10 shots. He was booed by 
a crowd of 8,988, the smallest ever for the Jets here. Tom Draper started in 
his place Friday night and had 20 saves.

JIM MURRAY: OTHER HENDERSON STEALS THE SHOW

The longest, eeriest, most schizoid, nervous World Series in the annals of 
baseball resumed Friday night. The Oakland A's were late arriving. Not as late 
as the Giants. They didn't show up till the ninth inning. In the immortal words 
of Joe Gould, they should of stood in bed. By the time they got there, the game 
and maybe the World Series was stolen. No team has ever come back from an 0-3 
deficit to win a World Series. No team has ever come back from 0-3 even to 
stretch the Series to six games. Only three of them have even come back to win 
the fifth game. Then, all went quietly. 
</P>
<P>
No one ever thought of Candlestick Park as a bandbox before. The Oakland A's 
turned it into a phone booth. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of phone booths, someone better check the one the center fielder of 
the Oakland A's steps into every October as the baseball version of the 
mild-mannered nice guy and comes out in a cape and block S and home runs bounce 
off him. 
</P>
<P>
Before the World Series started, the San Francisco Giants knew Henderson was a 
guy who was going to be a big problem for them. They loaded up on scouting 
reports on this guy. They knew he leads the world in stolen bases, he can hit 
home runs, he has 101 ways to beat you. He kept them up nights. When he walks 
up there, pitchers' palms sweat, the back of their neck hurts and they wish the 
manager would come out and yank them. 
</P>
<P>
Only, they had the wrong Henderson. Rickey is supposed to be doing all those 
terrible things to them, beating them five ways, rubbing their faces in it -- 
on his way to Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
The other Henderson is kind of baseball's version of a high plains drifter. 
Sort of Have Bat, Will Travel. He has been around some of the major backwaters 
of baseball. Even Seattle gave up on him. He had a career as somebody's caddy 
-- the guy who goes in the late innings for the star or for defensive purposes. 
</P>
<P>
He stole a base every other eclipse of the moon. He's miles behind Babe Ruth in 
lifetime homers. He was a fill-in, a throw-in in trades. He gets swapped for 
people like Randy Kutcher. He has to look down at the front of his uniform to 
see what town he's in. 
</P>
<P>
But, that's June and July. In October, Dave Henderson becomes the Sultan of 
Swat II. 
</P>
<P>
You will all remember the October he was a member of the Red Sox as a kind of 
afterthought in a deal where Boston got Spike Owen. The Red Sox gave up Rey 
Quinones for Owen, but for Henderson only the ever-familiar player-to-be-named. 
(Turned out to be someone named John Christensen.) 
</P>
<P>
The Angels were within one strike of the American League pennant that season 
when Dave Henderson came to bat in the playoffs at Anaheim. With a man on, he 
put a Donnie Moore fastball into the seats to wipe out a 5-4 lead for the 
Angels. In the 11th inning, he hit the fly ball that won the game -- and, to 
all intents and purposes, the pennant. 
</P>
<P>
In the World Series that year, he hit a 10th inning home run to help put the 
Red Sox ahead 5-3. It wasn't his fault they couldn't hold it. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night at Candlestick Park, Dave Henderson came within an inch of hitting 
three home runs in one Series game. This is the kind of thing only the Babe 
Ruths and the Reggie Jacksons do. Henderson hit two indubitable home runs. The 
third one hit the top of the right-field fence and, when it bounced into the 
air, fell on the side of the field in play. 
</P>
<P>
He got three hits for 10 bases, scored two runs and drove in four. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Jackson may be baseball's Mr. October, but he'd better spare a week for 
Mr. Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
For a guy who wasn't even the right Henderson, he tore the Giants' pitching 
into little pieces Friday night. For a night, he made Rickey the Other 
Henderson. Rickey stole his 2 bases, scored his run, got his hit -- but the 
Henderson who wasn't Rickey did all that damage just standing there. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants realized who was doing them the injury. In the eighth inning, they 
paid him the ultimate baseball accolade. They hit him in the neck with a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
All season long, Dave Henderson is the mild-mannered Clark Kent type. He hits 
his .270 or .250, catches everything hit to him and grins his way to another 
playoff and World Series. That's when he starts to leap tall buildings. That's 
when he becomes Super Dave. 
</P>
<P>
Part of his success is looseness. If Henderson were any more relaxed, he'd take 
the field sound asleep. When a Spanish language crew approached him before Game 
2, Henderson begged off. "I don't speak the language," he explained. "In fact, 
I don't speak my own too well." 
</P>
<P>
In any language, he's a Series hero. He's the right Henderson for these games, 
the two-run homer Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Home run Henderson cannot explain his autumnal heroics. "A time at bat is a 
simple thing to me," he grins. "Either, he gets you out -- or you hit him. I 
don't check the calendar, just the pitch." 
</P>
<P>
So, the curious World Series of 1989, the star-crossed classic, the Series 
nobody wanted, continued its haunted way to conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
It was a beleaguered Series, under unaccountable flack from many sources right 
up to the first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
No one could figure out why. There was racing at Bay Meadows, a rodeo at the 
Cow Palace, crap games in the bars. Japanese tourists had the town pretty much 
to themselves, probably because they have a long tradition of living with 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
The opera was playing Mozart, the San Francisco symphony was doing Tchaikovsky 
and Ravel, the strippers were out in force, you could see "Kill Me Again" or 
"Shocker" at select theaters and drive-ins. 
</P>
<P>
But the prevailing opinion seemed to be, Baseball had some nerve going on with 
its revels in the midst of this sad state of affairs. Baseball, like Presidents 
and vicars -- and Caesar's wife -- seemed to be held to a higher standard than 
the rest of society. 
</P>
<P>
The presumption was, people would be tuning in to see it for the same reasons 
they flocked to train wrecks or four-alarm fires -- morbid curiousity. The game 
would be incidental. 
</P>
<P>
Well, all the damage was done to Candlestick's reputation, not its structure. 
Seven home runs rattled out of its premises Friday night -- two by the 
Henderson who wasn't Rickey, one by Jose Canseco, Carney Lansford, Tony 
Phillips, one by Matt Williams and one by somebody named Bill Bathe. It was 
Bill's sixth career big league homer. Bathe hit most of his homers in places 
like West Haven, Conn., and Clinton, Iowa, before Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The only people who could think of a good reason why the 1989 World Series 
should not be resumed today are the San Francisco Giants.

FANS IN SECTION 53, THE MEMORIES VIVID, RETURN TO CANDLESTICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The attitude of the fans in section 53 of Candlestick Park's upper deck Friday 
night seemed best expressed by Stuart Graham of Foster City. 
</P>
<P>
"This was almost like making a pilgrimage," Graham said. "There was the feeling 
of having to come back." 
</P>
<P>
Section 53 is in right-center field at Candlestick. The game is nothing more 
than a blip on a radar screen. 
</P>
<P>
On the night of Oct. 17, the night that Game 3 of the World Series was 
postponed by the earthquake that rocked the Bay Area, fans in Section 53 
thought their section might disappear entirely. 
</P>
<P>
Concrete fell from the overhang. Cracks opened in the stairs and along the 
expansion joints. Railings that run down the middle of the stairs loosened. 
</P>
<P>
No other Candlestick area was more severely damaged. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything did what it was designed to do, but they didn't tell us that 
beforehand," Joe Eichbaum of Concord said Friday night as he returned to his 
seat in Row 8 of Section 53. "I was scared to death. I expected to end up in my 
seat on the playing field." 
</P>
<P>
Was Eichbaum apprehensive about returning to Candlestick for the long-delayed 
Game 3? 
</P>
<P>
"In the first five days after the quake I wouldn't have come back," he said. 
"Then I settled down and realized that if you fall off a horse, you've got to 
get back on. If I didn't come back tonight, I never would have come back." 
</P>
<P>
The memories remain vivid, however. 
</P>
<P>
"There were chunks of concrete falling up here," he said. "It was a miracle no 
one was hit. I thought for sure there'd be a stampede like you see at those 
European soccer games. The way the crowd stayed calm was the biggest miracle of 
all." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Causey of San Francisco was back in Row 15 with his mother, Phyllis. 
</P>
<P>
Both said they never thought twice about returning. 
</P>
<P>
"I work for the city, so I have to say I feel safe about it," Causey said, 
alluding to the structural inspections of Candlestick. 
</P>
<P>
"But it was pretty scary watching the roof shift and that area along the joint 
get farther and farther apart," he said. "The light towers looked as if they 
were in a hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people did start to run, but then a couple slipped on the stairs and 
I think everyone realized we were too high to go at that pace. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked 12 hours overtime, pushing electric trolleys off the streets that 
night, and felt fortunate doing it since I couldn't have slept. I mean, I told 
everybody at work that I was lucky to be alive. Another five seconds of rolling 
and I don't think that overhang would have stayed up." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Keller of Belmont displayed snapshots he had taken of the damage that night 
and compared them to the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept watching those panels (along the expansion joint in the overhang) 
separate and wondering what they knew about earthquake construction in 1960," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, look at this. I took this picture of a guy singing 'We Will Rock You' 
when the shaking finally stopped." 
</P>
<P>
Said Graham: "It's pretty spooky being back. I was sitting here with a hot dog 
and Coke when pieces of concrete started falling in them, so I ran into the 
tunnel. Lost the Coke but saved the hot dog." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Israel, a high school track coach from Stockton, returned with his son, 
Greg. The spirit of the World Series brought them back, Israel said. 
</P>
<P>
"Face it, there are no guarantees," he said. "If the epicenter is here the next 
time, this sucker is coming down. It's something you can't worry about. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, it's great to be part of the excitement." 
</P>
<P>
As if there had not been any on the night of Oct. 17? 
</P>
<P>
"Greg and I had been to Disneyland about a month earlier and gone on that new 
ride (Splash Mountain)," Israel said. "We walked out of here after the 
earthquake and I said to Greg, 'Talk about rides, some amusement park should 
buy the one we were just on.' " 
</P>
<P>
They were buckling in in Section 53 again Friday night. Survivors. Happy to be 
back. Happy the Series was resuming. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely," Joe Eichbaum said. "Life goes on. The World Series is an integral 
part of society. This is what makes America great." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the side effects of long-term cortisone usage are sad indeed. Listen to 
Don Robinson, tonight's scheduled starting pitcher for the San Francisco 
Giants: 
</P>
<P>
"I've probably had between 150 and 200 cortisone shots throughout my career. 
All over. My toe, my ankle, my groin, my hamstring, a majority of them in my 
shoulder, my elbow, my back, my neck, my lower stomach. You name it, I've had 
it there. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really worried (about the effects). In this game, if you don't go out 
there, you don't get paid. If you don't perform, you're not going to get a 
contract. (The team) doesn't care if you're healthy or not -- they just want 
you to go out there and win." 
</P>
<P>
And this type of thinking doesn't bother Robinson? 
</P>
<P>
"No," he said. "I've already been told that I'm going to have arthritis in my 
knees and my shoulders. Maybe when I'm old, I'll be watching all this (confined 
to) a chair. 
</P>
<P>
"But if I make enough money, I'm not going to have to worry about it." 
</P>
<P>
Sports medicine has yet to devise a drug that satisfactorily treats a sprained 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's pregame activities included a Candlestick Park sing-a-long to the 
lyrics of "San Francisco," a moment of silence at 5:04 p.m. -- the exact time 
the Oct. 17 earthquake hit the Bay Area -- and a first-pitch ceremony that 
featured local policemen, firemen and others who participated in the post-quake 
recovery effort. 
</P>
<P>
"Poignant" was how Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent described the pregame 
agenda. "A real contrast to the game. What follows is what we all know -- 
baseball. That's the great thing about baseball. It's predictable." 
</P>
<P>
And, according to Vincent, baseball is "probably as resilient an institution as 
there is in America. Baseball, of all American things, should carry on. It's 
always carried on -- and this is a good example of it. Baseball has to make a 
determined effort to finish what it set out to do." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent also said he was gladdened by a newspaper poll that showed a majority 
of Californians in favor of the resumption of the World Series in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"For the town itself, for economic reasons alone, it was important that the 
World Series go on," Vincent said. "San Francisco depends heavily on tourism, 
and it's important to show the whole country that San Francisco is not on its 
knees. 
</P>
<P>
"The city tonight will make a very important statement. And that is, 'It's all 
right.' " 
</P>

TAGLIABUE IS QUICK TO SET AGENDA AS NEW NFL CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILBON, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newly elected NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue Friday outlined some of the tasks 
that will command his immediate attention when he officially takes over for 
Pete Rozelle Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
The network television contracts with the league expire after this season, so 
Tagliabue said he will meet late next week with Cleveland Browns owner Art 
Modell, chairman of the television committee, to begin discussions. 
</P>
<P>
Also next week, Tagliabue plans to meet with members of the Management Council, 
the league's negotiating arm, to discuss new ideas for attempting to reach a 
collective bargaining agreement with the NFL Players Association. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are two areas that deserve immediate attention and two areas that will 
get immediate attention," Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
His first full day as commissioner began just after midnight, when former 
President Ronald Reagan called from Japan. The morning after his election in 
Cleveland was spent talking to owners, well-wishers and football writers. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue said as far as he is concerned the deliberations that led to three 
meetings and 12 ballots and that kept Pete Rozelle in office 220 days after he 
retired are past history. He said the owners who supported Jim Finks, his main 
opponent for the job, called to tell him "bygones have to be bygones." 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue, 48, a Georgetown alumnus and senior partner with the Washington law 
firm of Covington and Burling, said, "There were arguments at times, and they 
were painful at times, but they had a very good value." 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue said he feels no particular debt to the group of 11 owners who 
blocked Finks's election in Chicago in July, then rallied behind Tagliabue's 
candidacy. "As far as I'm concerned, the Chicago 11 refers to Mike Singletary 
and the rest of the Chicago Bears' defense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue talked Friday about where he stands on collective bargaining, 
expansion, a possible restructuring of the league offices and minority 
involvement, on the field and in the executive suites. He said he told the 
owners in Cleveland Thursday that, "One of my priorities will be getting more 
Art Shells into the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
Shell became the NFL's first black head coach in modern history three weeks ago 
when Al Davis made him coach of the Los Angeles Raiders. "I've already made 
this clear to them," Tagliabue said. "Art Shell's initial weeks have shown he 
can energize the Raiders. Minority ownership is also an area for the NFL to be 
a leader. There are minority business people out there who are successful, who 
have an interest in sports." 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue made reference to the Denver Nuggets of the National Basketball 
Association, which just became the only professional sports franchise run by 
blacks, and cited Dave Bing, a Washingtonian whose Bing Steel Inc. made $42 
million in 1987, as the type of black businessman the NFL ought to aggressively 
pursue, either when expansion comes or when a club is being sold. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue said he may ask owners to go out and identify potential minority 
businessmen, and said, "There are more formal ways of doing it; (finding) those 
who have the means to do it, the interest and ability to run a club well." 
</P>
<P>
He said he talked for two hours recently with Willie Davis, the Green Bay 
Packers Hall-of-Famer, who was one of the four finalists for commissioner. 
"Obviously Willie Davis commanded a lot of respect in this process or he 
wouldn't have come that far." 
</P>
<P>
On the topic of expansion, Tagliabue said much the same thing Rozelle said, 
that a collective bargaining agreement (the league has been without one since 
September 1987) must precede expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be very important to have a good agreement with the (players') 
union," he said. "Then you can think about expanding by whatever number of 
teams. Then you can go to prospective cities and owners and say, 'This 
(contract) is the basis on which we operate.' I think it was very important for 
pro basketball to get their collective bargaining agreement, to solve some of 
the franchise problems of existing teams and then go into expansion." 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue, asked about cities that have lost franchises, said, "Oakland, St. 
Louis, Baltimore in particular" had proved they could be great NFL cities, and 
that expansion would "weigh in the favor" of those cities. 
</P>
<P>
No expansion committee would be appointed, he said, until after a labor 
contract is reached. 
</P>
<P>
On that subject, Tagliabue said: "I think there are new ways (of negotiating) 
and I'm not saying I've invented them. I think a lot of new ideas will come 
forth. I think the lawsuit has been an impediment to that. It has eliminated 
the prospects of fruitful collective bargaining. We need to be open to new 
ideas." Tagliabue said he hopes the case never goes to court. 
</P>
<P>
On a possible restructuring of the league, including the naming of conference 
presidents and an executive in charge of football operations, Tagliabue said: 
"There can be some restructuring and some improvement, as there can be in any 
organization. I want to wait and see what Booz, Allen, Hamilton (hired by the 
league to study its organizational structure) says, and I want to wait and see 
what owners say. I have some ideas but I think it would really be premature to 
tell you what they are until I've spoken to a broad group of people in the 
league." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he wanted to become commissioner, Tagliabue said, "I said (in an 
interview in Dallas) it would be fun to continue a great sports tradition. It's 
a league where the sport has become a form of civic passion, where people hang 
out the windows of skyscrapers to watch the players come home after they've won 
a Super Bowl. That has become something special in America, and it's on its way 
to becoming something special in Europe and Japan. So that's why I said it 
would be fun to continue this great tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"Do I think it's going to be a bed of roses? No. It would be foolish, naive 
optimism to think there won't be problems. There will be problems. There will 
be some tough problems. Tough negotiations. But I still think it will be fun."

JACK KENT COOKE HAS IDEAS ON RESTRUCTURING THE NFL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VITO STELLINO, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Kent Cooke, the owner of the Washington Redskins, has proposed a broad 
restructuring of the National Football League, his son, John Cooke, said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only worthwhile thing that's going to come out of this. We're 
going to redo the league," John Cooke said Friday after Washington lawyer Paul 
Tagliabue was elected commissioner Thursday even though the Cookes favored Jim 
Finks, the general manager of the New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
When the first search committee was formed last March after Pete Rozelle had 
announced he was retiring, each club was asked for a recommendation on how the 
league should be structured. 
</P>
<P>
Cooke said his father wrote a letter to the committee recommending that no 
owner be allowed to be the chairman of more than one committee. 
</P>
<P>
He also recommended that the members serve fixed terms on the committee and be 
rotated and that it be mandatory that each owner serve on committees. 
</P>
<P>
"If a guy says I don't want to do it, he shouldn't have any choice," John Cooke 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cooke said he and his father would make the same recommendations to the 
consulting company of Booz, Allen, Hamilton Inc. when they meet with members of 
the company next month. 
</P>
<P>
The company has been commissioned to present a report on the restructuring of 
the league when the owners meet in Orlando, Fla., next March. 
</P>
<P>
John Cooke said another result could be that the Management Council, which has 
overseen negotiations with the NFL Players Association for the last decade, 
will be disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
"We may not have a Management Council. We may give back more power to the 
commissioner. I think we should be involved more in labor negotiations. 
Obviously, we've got to have some kind of committee (for negotiations), but it 
should go back to the commissioner's office for him to oversee," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cooke said his father's recommendations were designed to meet the concerns of 
the new guard owners who blocked Finks' election because they felt they didn't 
have enough input in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"They guys were alienated and they became frustrated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
John Cooke, though, felt Finks was the better candidate for an era of 
transition because Tagliabue has been advising Rozelle the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
When Cooke was asked if he voted for Finks on the last ballot even after 
Wellington Mara of the New York Giants and Art Modell of the Cleveland Browns 
had agreed to switch to Tagliabue, he answered by not answering. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no secret that I thought that of the two men, the most qualified at 
this time in history was Jim Finks," John Cooke said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Cooke has ever felt part of the inner circle in the past, and John said 
it's a good idea to get more owners involved in league operations. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we agreed with the clique and sometimes we didn't," he said, "but 
we'll never be part of a bloc. We're independent and I'm saying to you that we 
should all be independent." 
</P>
<P>
In the Rozelle era, the key was consensus. Cooke feels it's more important to 
have each team voting its view. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care about consensus," he said. "All I care about is the vote." 
</P>
<P>
He said the owners can do a better job of voting if they're more informed by 
being on committees. "It's best for the league over the long haul." 
</P>
<P>
Cooke served on a committee for the first time when he was named to the second 
search committee in July. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Rooney, the president of the Pittsburgh Steelers and a longtime member of 
the inner circle, said the strife over the election of a commissioner may turn 
out to be positive because it gave all the clubs a chance to express 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"The old guard better realize that they have to talk to everyone," Rozelle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tagliabue said in a conference call with writers around the country 
Friday that he had talked with Rozelle and that they decided Rozelle would 
resign next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 5, Tagliabue said he "will be functioning as commissioner." 
</P>
<P>
When Tagliabue was asked about changes in the structure, he said he wouldn't 
make any major changes the rest of this season and would wait until he gets the 
consultant's report before planning any steps. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue said his phone had been ringing off the hook and that one of the 
calls came from former President Reagan in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
The former president congratulated him and asked him to pass on his compliments 
to Rozelle for a job well done the last three decades. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue also said that Reagan stressed he was a two-way football player and 
maybe they should bring back two-way players. 
</P>
<P>
"That may have been his way of talking about situation substitution," Tagliabue 
said, and then, "he said at some point to make sure to 'Win One for the 
Gipper.' "

RESUMPTION OF SERIES A MATTER OF MONEY 
</P>

<P>
Let's be realistic. Out of deference to the disaster that struck the Bay Area, 
if the World Series hadn't been resumed, baseball probably would have been 
required to return something like $75 million to the network. That's a load of 
deference. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, each Series game generates about $12 million in profit, as the 
network attempts to cover losses accrued with regular-season coverage, so guess 
who's praying it goes seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Morgan might have a slight problem picking up a fan following next year 
when he becomes one of the main analysts for ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
The ex-second baseman on the relative merits of the contending leagues: "The 
National League is definitely the harder league, no question. The teams play 
better. How many American League teams do you see manufacture runs like they do 
in the National? How many?" 
</P>
<P>
Ho-hum, it's an age-old dodge of National Leaguers. Pay no attention. 
</P>
<P>
Dream Season concludes Sunday night on ESPN with '72 Dolphins taking on '78 
Steelers. Steve Sabol, the originator from NFL Films, says no more because old 
friends, players and coaches have called up and wept when their teams were 
beaten. To paraphrase, it's a kid's game played by kids. 
</P>
<P>
Even by boxing standards, which are all but non-existent, it was bush. There 
was promoter Bob Arum on the tube the other night snipping and snapping how 
Brit Tom Collins shouldn't get his purse after quitting in a bout against WBC 
light-heavyweight champ Jeff Harding. Arum, of course, makes millions promoting 
fights, a lot of them stinkers, and he hasn't been hit yet. 
</P>
<P>
Honest now, broadcaster Jon Miller, did you actually say of Bert Blyleven 
during the season that "he was originally born in Holland"? If you did, I 
accuse you of plagiarism. Curt Gowdy used to make that faux pas all the time. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Brooks did about two periods of an Edmonton hockey game on SportsChannel 
referring to Kevin Lowe as Rob Lowe. Hmm, Kevin probably wishes he were Rob. 
</P>
<P>
A guy who analyzes a pro football game as well as anyone is Paul Maguire. Now 
if his presentation wasn't so street-cornerish. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, Giff, Giff, Giff. When Webster Slaughter set the Cleveland record with a 
97-yard reception the other night, Frank Gifford said he broke the mark of Mike 
Moran. Who just so happens to be Milt Morin, a titan at tight end and a Pro 
Bowler many times. 
</P>
<P>
This oops from Brent Gushburger, presently making the transition from football 
to baseball as CBS moved into to cover the Grand Old Game next season: "... and 
Mark McGwire bobbled that grounder out of bounds." Psst, Brent, it's called 
foul territory over here.

UNISYS POSTS $648-MILLION LOSS FOR QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Unisys Corp., hard hit by price wars and sluggish sales in the U.S. computer 
industry, said Friday that it lost $648.2 million in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's No. 3 computer maker attributed most of the loss to the costs of 
slashing nearly 8,000 jobs from its 90,000-member work force, closing unneeded 
manufacturing plants, writing off excess inventory and taking other steps to 
get it through the current downturn. 
</P>
<P>
About $150 million of the loss stemmed from Unisys' aerospace operations, for 
which defense contract costs have exceeded fixed-price bids and the company 
faces lawsuits due to last year's "Ill Wind" investigation into Pentagon 
procurement fraud. 
</P>
<P>
While large, the latest loss was generally in line with Wall Street's 
expectations. In trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, Unisys stock 
fell 75 cents per share to close at $16.25, a 52-week low. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the company faces no immediate financial crisis that could force 
an asset sale or other similar actions. The company placed the value of its 
assets at $11 per share, down $4 from its level just three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Although other manufacturers of large computer systems, such as International 
Business Machines and Digital Equipment Corp., have suffered from a sales 
slowdown, none has been hurt as badly as Blue Bell, Pa.-based Unisys, formed in 
1986 by the merger of Sperry and Burroughs, two middle-of-the-pack computer 
makers. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past 18 months, the company's U.S. sales have dipped, its inventories 
of unsold products have swelled and its defense operations have been the object 
of a scandal that led the Pentagon to temporarily cut off new Navy contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, despite the company's predictions that it can be profitable next 
year, some analysts believe that 1990 could be another down year at Unisys. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is an industrywide shift toward powerful desktop computers that 
typically carry lower profit margins than larger mainframe machines and are 
more prone to price competition, said Ulrich Weil, a Washington high-technology 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Weil said while Unisys has correctly adjusted its production to serve the 
desktop market, it has consistently overestimated the buying power of the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"They have been too rosy-eyed about the future," Weil said. "The attitude is 
that market growth can hide a company's sins. But the market isn't growing 
much, and now there's no place to hide." 
</P>
<P>
Weil said new orders for Unisys products have slowed, which could lead to a 
disappointing 1990. 
</P>
<P>
In its report, the company acknowledged that its computer sales dipped in the 
last quarter and that companywide sales growth was due to a temporary upswing 
in military orders following the lifting of the Navy contracting ban in late 
June. 
</P>
<P>
Still, W. Michael Blumenthal, Unisys chairman and chief executive, said the 
company is well positioned for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Blumenthal said the latest write-offs and layoffs, 
"though painful and expensive, will significantly enhance our competitive 
posture going forward and our profitability and cash flow in 1990." 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said approximately $230 million of the third-quarter loss 
stemmed from plant closings and the previously announced slashing of 8,000 
jobs, cost-cutting programs that are expected to be completed over the next six 
to nine months. The latest red ink brings the company's total loss for the 
first nine months of 1989 to $673.3 million, compared to a profit of $462.6 
million in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue for the third quarter was $2.35 billion, up 4% from the same 
three-month period last year.

LINCOLN EXEMPLIFIES HOW S&amp;LS COLLAPSE, OFFICIAL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The collapse of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine may be the most costly 
thrift failure on record, but the pattern of high-risk investments, rosy 
accountant reports and efforts to wield political influence were painfully 
familiar to federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
While the example set by Lincoln was "the worst of the worst," its downfall was 
a replay of other catastrophic S&amp;L failures during the last five years, 
according to testimony by William K. Black, regional counsel for the Office of 
Thrift Supervision in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
It was as simple as "ADC," Black told Congress on Thursday, referring to 
Lincoln's heavy investments in risky "acquisition, development and 
construction" loans to developers and virtual abandonment of the far safer, 
traditional loans to single-family homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
"A thrift was the perfect cash cow for a real estate developer," said Black, 
who testified before the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee, 
which is investigating the Lincoln failure. 
</P>
<P>
In his congressional testimony, Black noted that American Continental Corp. of 
Phoenix, controlled by the family of Charles H. Keating Jr., was basically a 
home builder when it acquired Lincoln in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln was seized by federal regulators on April 14, a day after its parent 
company filed for bankruptcy court protection. Estimates of the cost of 
cleaning up the mess have ranged as high as $2 billion, which would make it the 
most expensive thrift failure in history. 
</P>
<P>
Black, who along with other regional regulators in San Francisco tried to call 
attention to Lincoln's problems two years before the government finally acted, 
told Congress that Lincoln was a textbook case of thrift excess. 
</P>
<P>
A typical Lincoln ADC loan, Black said, required no down payment by the 
borrower and included funds for architect fees, developer fees and other costs 
on top of the price of the property and construction expenses. In addition, the 
borrower was not required to make principal payments for the first two to five 
years of the loan. 
</P>
<P>
"In other words, the borrower puts zero money in and walks away with money in 
his pocket," the regulator said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the thrift would charge the borrower millions of dollars in 
"points" and other fees that were added to the amount of the loan, along with 
enough money to cover two years' worth of interest payments. Those charges were 
then recorded on the thrift's books as income, even though no money had changed 
hands, Black said. 
</P>
<P>
Because commercial real estate projects are frequently speculative, with no 
legally committed or financially capable buyer on hand, they are far riskier 
than home loans. 
</P>
<P>
"The typical ADC project that sank thrifts was scores of millions of dollars in 
size," Black testified. "Yet hundreds of such loans were made with no loan 
application, no credit checks, with no appraisal or feasibility study, with no 
down payment and no personal guarantee" of repayment. 
</P>
<P>
Even under the best of circumstances, Black noted, an ADC nothing-down loan is 
an extraordinarily risky investment. 
</P>
<P>
"When combined with poor underwriting, a serious loss is highly likely," he 
said. "When fraud is involved, these ADC loans become almost total losses." 
</P>
<P>
While conservatively run institutions would not make this kind of loan, 
S&amp;Ls that did were able to charge higher-than-normal interest rates and 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
"Lenders willing to take on these garbage loans were generally troubled thrifts 
or thrifts acquired by unscrupulous individuals," Black said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was compounded by friendly accountants who were willing to disguise 
the true financial condition of thrifts by counting as income the fees and 
interest payments charged on ADC loans rather than categorizing them properly 
as direct investments. 
</P>
<P>
In Lincoln's case, he said, a chief accountant for the Dallas office of Arthur 
Young &amp; Co. who had worked on the S&amp;L's books was hired at a salary of 
$1 million a year by American Continental. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a sad fact that most of the worst losses (experienced by the 
government's deposit insurance fund) were from thrifts that received 'clean' 
audit opinions from Big 8 accounting firms prior to their failures," Black 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, Lincoln is proof positive that any thrift in America could obtain a 
clean audit opinion despite being grossly insolvent." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, such accounting methods ensured that an ADC loan would 
appear profitable for the first two years -- until the time came for the 
borrower to begin repaying with real money. 
</P>
<P>
"If a thrift grew rapidly and put the great bulk of its assets into ADC loans," 
Black said, "it was guaranteed to report record profits, at least until the 
first payments to be made by the borrowers were due." 
</P>
<P>
Sham sales of dubious loans also helped these S&amp;Ls appear to be in good 
shape, the regulator noted, along with swaps of bad projects. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll trade you my dead cow for your dead horse," became a catch phrase with 
some of the worst thrifts, Black noted. "By paying each other more than the 
book value of the projects, they could each convert a loss into a gain and 
declare new income." 
</P>
<P>
To fend off government regulators who tried to halt these practices, Black told 
Congress, owners of high-flier thrifts made campaign contributions in an effort 
to obtain political influence that could squelch an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the failures of Lincoln Savings and other troubled thrifts left the 
taxpayers, rather than the owners, holding the bag since losses were covered by 
federal deposit insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"Federal deposit insurance is like giving the owner of a thrift access to the 
federal mint," Black concluded. "Lincoln may have appropriated over $2 billion 
in taxpayer funds. This is truly taxation without representation."

FRIGHT NIGHT GOES UPSCALE; 
</P>
<P>
HALLOWEEN: THE COST OF A COSTUME THAT FULFILLS A FANTASY IS BECOMING DOWNRIGHT 
SCARY.

Batman outfits selling for up to $300? Sixty bucks and more just for the rubber 
mask? Holy price hikes! 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the new era of costume marketing. Now that grown-ups are 
rediscovering the joys of the Halloween season in a big way, many of those who 
sell and rent costumes and accessories are zeroing in on upscale adult 
pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
The result: Expensive costumes for people in their 20s, 30s and well beyond are 
becoming a growing part of the business -- and, apparently, an annoyance to 
some less flamboyant consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California -- a haven for conspicuous consumption and home to several 
costume shops that cater to the entertainment industry and trend-setting 
masqueraders -- is one of the nation's hottest markets. 
</P>
<P>
"We're finding that people want to be special," said Paul Abramowitz, president 
of Hollywood's vast Western Costume Co., the world's largest costume house. 
"They want to be unique. And they'll pay virtually anything to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Western rents out Halloween outfits for $75 to $500 a day, with the average 
customer spending about $100. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Burdy, owner of Somewhere in Time Costumes &amp; Masks in Pasadena, is 
finding that "people begin to get gun-shy at $275 or $300" for one-day rentals. 
But, she quickly added, many customers get caught up in the Halloween spirit 
and spend that much and more anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The average shopper is more apt to buy than rent an outfit. And, retailers say, 
most shoppers typically spend less than than $40 on children's disguises and no 
more than about $60 for complete adult outfits. 
</P>
<P>
But even that price range is too high for many Halloween party-goers. Shirley 
Murray, a contract administrator for the Defense Department, stopped this week 
at a Halloween concession in the Northridge Fashion Center intending to jazz up 
her homemade leopard outfit. She went away empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-five dollars? Oh my God!" Murray exclaimed when she got the word about 
the price of a black "wild shag" wig. "I don't want to pay $25 for a wig. I 
could mess up my hair that bad myself," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my friends are going to buy accessories and put their own thing 
together," Murray said later. "They don't want to spend that kind of money just 
to fool around the office one day." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps even more frustrated are parents with tight budgets. Children's plastic 
outfits costing $6 to $8 are being pushed off retailers' shelves by more 
costly, albeit more durable, fabric disguises. 
</P>
<P>
Elaine Miller, a self-employed transcriber in Ventura, said she considered 
buying outfits for her two sons, ages 4 1/2 and 6 1/2. Then she scanned the 
selections at Toys R Us and a couple of mail-order catalogues, and found 
nothing left below $20. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it," Miller said. "It wasn't something I wanted to spend 
that kind of money on with Christmas, school supplies and other expenses coming 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Now Miller plans to dig up materials from around the house to put together 
cowboy outfits or perhaps a pillow case ghost costume for her boys. Other 
parents are heading to fabric stores. 
</P>
<P>
Even parents with permissive pocketbooks seem to have their limits. At the 
Disney Store in Northridge, $55 Minnie Mouse outfits for little girls quickly 
sold out. But it has been much slower going for the $120 Cinderella dresses 
with the white lace and silk fronts. 
</P>
<P>
The booming popularity in recent years of adult Halloween parties at home and 
work fuels the demand for fancy costumes, retailers say. 
</P>
<P>
Hallmark Cards researchers estimate that more than 50 million Americans, mostly 
adults, will attend Halloween parties this year, up 25% from three years ago. 
Retailers say that after Christmas, Halloween is their best time of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The statistics on Halloween shopping trends, however, aren't universally 
accepted. Hallmark also estimates that costume buyers spend an average of $30 
on their purchases, a figure that many Southern California retailers believe is 
low. 
</P>
<P>
No one, though, denies that adults are spending more than they used to on 
costumes for Halloween and, for that matter, masquerade parties throughout the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Maureen Holmes of Arcadia, who runs an auto body shop with her husband, is a 
case in point. Last year she dished out about $200 to dress up like Mad Maxine. 
This year she is renting a less expensive cat outfit, but she expects to pay "a 
few thousand dollars" for decorations to create a haunted house look for a 
combination Halloween and 40th birthday party for herself and a friend. 
</P>
<P>
Why spend so much on Halloween? It's a chance to act out fantasies and relieve 
stress, Holmes said, as well as to outdo your friends. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just sheer fun," she said. 
</P>
<P>
To cash in on the free-spending Halloween trend and raise some money, the 
Center Theatre Group Costume Shop decided last year to start renting out its 
outfits to the public. 
</P>
<P>
The shop, which serves as the costume department for the Ahmanson Theatre and 
the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, has an inventory of theatrical costumes 
originally made for the likes of Charlton Heston and Lauren Bacall. But it also 
offers less exotic outfits. In fact, CTG's top five rentals -- Batman, the 
Joker, Freddie Krueger, the Phantom of the Opera and the Jason hockey mask -- 
are, for the most part, favorites at costume stores across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Batman outfits and accessories have gotten so hot that some retailers have 
accused higher-priced competitors of taking advantage of customers by charging 
whatever the market will bear. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize that some places are getting into customers' pocketbooks and gouging 
them, but we don't do that," said Arlene Freed, manager of the Chickenshirt 
shop in Canoga Park's Fallbrook Mall. Freed cited prices of up to $70 for 
rubber Batman masks at other West San Fernando Valley stores; she sold out her 
stock for $45 apiece. (Others in the costume business said the higher prices 
reflected, among other things, the cost of improved materials, shipping, 
licensing royalties and distributors' charges.) 
</P>
<P>
High prices and strong demand, however, have not translated into 
across-the-board profit increases for all retailers. Some costume and novelty 
shops say they have been pinched by the recent stepped-up competition by giant 
discount chains. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers have noticed signs of softening sales growth, too. Collegeville 
Flag &amp; MFG., a leading costume manufacturer in Collegeville, Pa., passed 
along price increases of 8% to 12% this year. But the number of costumes it 
shipped was up only slightly, apparently in part because many of the newcomers 
to the business over-ordered last year, said Cindy Smith, the company's sales 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, she said, no one is sure how long the giddy spending spree will 
last. 
</P>
<P>
"You wonder how high it's going to go," Smith said. "Next year is someone going 
to pay $50 for a costume at a K mart or Target? I just don't know." 
</P>

DAVIS SOUNDS OUT UAL UNIONS ON SUPPORT FOR NEW BUYOUT BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles billionaire Marvin Davis is seeking the support of United Airlines' 
labor unions for a new bid for UAL Corp., the airline's parent, sources close 
to the situation said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Discussions between Davis adviser David Batchelder and representatives of 
United's pilots, machinists and flight attendants indicate that Davis still 
wants to buy UAL. Davis' renewed efforts to acquire the airline follow the 
collapse of a $300-a-share, $6.75-billion offer from an employee-management 
group led by UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
Davis started UAL's takeover turmoil in August with an unsuccessful 
$240-a-share bid. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the situation said Davis believes that it would be difficult 
to finance a UAL takeover without support from United's labor unions. 
Opposition from the machinists union is one reason why banks refused to finance 
the failed employee-management bid. 
</P>
<P>
A source said Batchelder hasn't discussed a price for UAL in his talks with 
United's unions. But knowledgeable sources said Davis is expected to have a 
proposal ready by late next week if United's pilots, machinists and flight 
attendants are receptive to a new offer. 
</P>
<P>
Batchelder declined comment on Friday, and advisers to United's unions couldn't 
be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Even with union support, Davis faces a critical stumbling block in his quest 
for UAL. A standstill agreement Davis has with the company bars him from making 
an offer for less than $300 a share, or from taking actions to remove UAL's 
board. 
</P>
<P>
Davis isn't expected to bid $300 a share for the company, because its shares 
are now trading at nearly half that price. But Davis could make a new, lower 
offer if a third party makes an offer and UAL's board permits Davis to 
counter-bid. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors about a new bid for UAL gained strength earlier this week with 
speculation that Coniston Partners, a New York investment firm, had acquired a 
large stake in UAL and was preparing to force a sale or recapitalization of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Tierney, a partner in Coniston, declined comment on rumors that the 
partnership had acquired more than 5% of UAL's shares. Pressure from Coniston 
two years ago forced UAL to undergo a corporate overhaul that included the sale 
of its hotel and rental car operations, and a large stock repurchase program. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't clear whether the unions would work with Davis. In an effort to get 
the unions behind him, Davis has indicated that he is willing to offer 
employees a small ownership stake in UAL. Ownership is important to United's 
pilots, who played a major role in the failed bid, which would have given 
employees a 75% stake in the airline. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots were bitterly disappointed when the employee-management bid failed 
and have been working with their advisers to come up with an alternative. The 
employee-management group formally withdrew its original bid on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But the pilots have been receptive to Davis in the past. Sources familiar with 
the situation said the pilots told Davis last summer that they could support 
his earlier bid for UAL if it included ownership for employees. The pilots 
later aligned with UAL management because the collapsed deal offered them a 
substantial ownership stake. 
</P>
<P>
Davis might have difficulty winning support from the machinists. They have 
opposed a debt-financed takeover of the airline, saying the transaction would 
put UAL's financial health at risk.

BellSouth Corp., trying to beat McCaw Cellular Communications for control of 
Lin Broadcasting, Friday agreed to a new plan to merge its cellular telephone 
operations with Lin's. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Lin would increase a proposed special dividend payment to its 
holders to $42 a share from $20. Atlanta-based BellSouth also would assume more 
of the debt of the combined cellular company. That would allow Lin to pay the 
dividend and exercise its option to buy Metromedia's 46% interest in a New York 
cellular telephone company for $1.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
New York-based Lin, already BellSouth's partner in ownership of Los Angeles 
Cellular Telephone, also is Metromedia's partner in cellular systems in New 
York and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, which will be presented to Lin shareholders for a vote in December or 
January, could prompt revision of a pending buyout bid for Lin from McCaw, the 
current leader in the cellular field. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts disagreed about the value of the new merger proposal, compared to 
McCaw's sweetened $125-a-share cash offer for a majority stake in Lin. But they 
agreed that BellSouth's increasingly aggressive stance has put the battle in an 
entirely different context. 
</P>
<P>
The bidder that combines with Lin would become the nation's largest cellular 
company. A BellSouth victory would present a serious challenge to McCaw's 
strategy for dominating the industry. A combined BellSouth and Lin would 
dominate the nation's top 10 cellular markets. 
</P>
<P>
But BellSouth's aggressiveness may also force other regional telephone 
companies to act, said Fred Moran, president of Moran &amp; Associates, a 
Greenwich, Conn.-based investment firm. BellSouth's moves mean that the 
regional Bell companies created in the 1986 breakup of American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph "have come to life and will go after other cellular companies," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We will see a string of acquisitions of cellular," Moran said. "The other 
regional Bells are not going to do nothing and let BellSouth dominate cellular. 
The regional Bells will take out all of the independent cellular companies that 
are not protected." 
</P>
<P>
BellSouth's merger with Lin would push it far ahead of San Francisco-based 
Pacific Telesis, which, among the regional Bells, currently has the largest 
stake in cellular systems. 
</P>
<P>
Moran said he believes that the new BellSouth-Lin merger proposal is superior 
to McCaw's current cash offer for a little more than half of Lin's shares. 
Analyst John Reddan, also of Moran &amp; Associates, said the investment firm 
believes that the combined company would trade on the open market at $86 a 
share. He put a value of $11 a share on Lin's seven television stations, which 
would be spun off to current shareholders in a separate company as part of the 
proposed merger. 
</P>
<P>
Those values, plus the special dividend, would place the BellSouth bid at $139 
a share, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other analysts expressed doubts about the new merger proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe this deal is significantly greater than McCaw's offer," said 
Thomas W. Friedberg, a Seattle-based analyst for Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood 
of Minneapolis. "McCaw still in the short term offers the better deal," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he added, evaluating the deal probably boils down to a "qualitative" 
judgment among shareholders, particularly large institutional holders, as to 
whether it's better for the long haul to have Lin's current management in 
control of the company, or McCaw. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkland, Wash.-based McCaw said the revised BellSouth offer "still raises more 
questions than it answers." Though BellSouth agreed to pay full value after 
awhile for Lin shares it wouldn't own after a proposed merger, McCaw said its 
rival offered no assurances that such a deal would take place. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, McCaw's statement questioned whether the dominance of the 
nation's top 10 cellular markets by a regional Bell company would be in the 
public interest. 
</P>
<P>
McCaw opened the bidding for Lin in June with a hostile $120-a-share offer, 
only to drop its bid to $110 a share when Lin lost a court bid to force 
Metromedia to sell its interest in New York and Philadelphia cellular systems 
to Lin. McCaw later revised its strategy, agreeing to give Lin shareholders 
$125 a share, but settling for less than all of the company. 
</P>
<P>
The BellSouth bid pushed Lin's share price up $4.63 to close at $112.63 in 
over-the counter trading Friday. McCaw closed in OTC trading at $37.75, down 
$2.50. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, BellSouth closed at 
$52.125, down 78.5 cents.

FHA Loan Ceiling Bill Passes: In an 84-6 vote, the Senate approved legislation 
raising to $124,875 the ceiling on home mortgages insured by the federal 
government in high-cost housing markets. The measure, part of a $67-billion 
spending bill, now goes to President Bush for approval. Currently, the ceiling 
on mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration is $101,250, an 
amount below the median price of homes in the District of Columbia and 18 
states, including California.

Treasury Changes a Date: The Treasury announced that it is amending next week's 
13-week and 26-week Treasury bill auction, pushing up the issue date from 
Thursday to Tuesday. The auctions will each be for $7.8 billion in securities 
and will be held Monday. The Treasury also announced an auction on Monday for 
$2 billion in 51-day cash management bills; the bills will have a Tuesday 
issuance date. The changes were made so that the Treasury could borrow the 
funds in advance of Oct. 31, when a temporary federal debt ceiling of $2.87 
trillion expires and the ceiling reverts back to the permanent level of $2.8 
trillion.

NABISCO SELLING TWO CANDY BAR BRANDS TO NESTLE

RJR Nabisco Inc., trying to stay on track in its ambitious schedule to pare 
debt from the biggest leveraged buyout in history, said Friday that it will 
sell its Baby Ruth and Butterfinger candy bar brands to Nestle SA for $370 
million. 
</P>
<P>
RJR, a food and tobacco company, said it will close the cash deal for the two 
candy brands, the Pearson confection business and a Franklin, Ill., plant by 
year-end. 
</P>
<P>
The president of Nestle Food Corp., C. Alan MacDonald, said the purchase would 
complement Nestle's other candy bar brands -- Nestle's Crunch, Raisinets, 
Alpine White, Chunk and Bit-O-Honey. 
</P>
<P>
RJR Chairman Louis V. Gerstner Jr. said the sale was a significant step in our 
overall divestiture program." 
</P>
<P>
RJR placed itself on the auction block a year ago and was acquired in February 
by Kolhberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. for $25 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Since the buyout, it has been generally smooth sailing for RJR. It posted 
higher operating earnings for the first six months by aggressively cutting 
costs and trimming its work force by 2,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
So far, its asset sales have mostly been on track. RJR sold its European foods 
unit in June for $2.5 billion to help pay down a $6-billion bridge loan. 
</P>
<P>
The company owes another $3 billion on that loan by February and will use the 
proceeds from the Baby Ruth and Butterfinger sale toward it. RJR has said it 
will also sell its 20% stake in cable television network ESPN and its breakfast 
cereals unit to help pay off the loan. 
</P>
<P>
RJR is also counting on the successful sale of its Del Monte canned foods unit 
by year-end to pay off the remainder of the bridge loan. 
</P>
<P>
But rumors surfaced Wednesday that RJR's planned sale of Del Monte for $1.48 
billion to Merrill Lynch might fall through. The sale is contingent on 
Merrill's ability to finance about $350 million of the purchase with 
high-yield, high-risk bonds, or with a bridge loan.

E. GERMANY GIVES AMNESTY TO EMIGRES, DEMONSTRATORS 
</P>

MUNICH, West Germany

<TEXT>
<P>
The new East German leadership declared an amnesty Friday for all those who 
have fled to the West and all those who have taken part in peaceful street 
demonstrations over the last month. 
</P>
<P>
Since this summer, about 60,000 East Germans have fled illegally through 
Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland to West Germany, where all are considered to 
be citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The official East German news agency ADN, in announcing the amnesty, did not 
make clear how many people might be affected. The order did not state how far 
back the amnesty extends, but the broad wording may mean it goes to 1961, when 
the Berlin Wall was erected. If so, it would affect many thousands more. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities also said that rules requiring visas or passports to travel to 
Czechoslovakia will be lifted next Wednesday. The rules were imposed Oct. 3 to 
stem the flow of emigres. 
</P>
<P>
Under the amnesty order, everyone arrested as a demonstrator -- even those 
under investigation -- will be released by Nov. 30, according to ADN. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency said the Council of State, the highest ruling government body, 
specifically excluded anyone who had used force or advocated the use of force 
in connection with the demonstrations, which have swept East Germany in the 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations followed the flight of thousands of East Germans who said 
they saw no possibility of getting the political and economic reforms that many 
are demanding. The demonstrations continued Thursday night, with 100,000 people 
rallying in Dresden and lesser numbers in several other cities, ADN reported. 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, the West German government said it welcomes the amnesty as a positive 
step. But chief spokesman Hans Klein said his government believes that most of 
the East Germans involved are guilty of no real offense. He said these people 
were only exercising their rights. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Klein said, the amnesty must be looked on as a first step toward more 
freedom for East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The amnesty announcement was the latest in a dramatic series of developments, 
apparently in response to public pressure, since Egon Krenz, 52, replaced the 
ailing Erich Honecker, 77, as East Germany's leader on Oct. 18. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the West German newspaper Bild said sources in Moscow indicated that 
Krenz will visit Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev next week. It said Krenz 
will travel to Moscow on Tuesday and that he will see other top Soviet 
officials as well. 
</P>
<P>
When Krenz succeeded to the top government and party posts, he was widely 
regarded as a protege of Honecker who could be expected to take a hard line 
against the kind of political and economic reforms that have been introduced in 
the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary and that have been demanded by opposition 
groups in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
But Krenz appears to have charted a more reformist course. A member of his 
Politburo met Thursday with opposition leaders, and Krenz has agreed to meet 
with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
The amnesty statement made no specific reference to opposition groups such as 
New Forum, an organization that was established only recently but that already 
claims more than 26,000 followers. 
</P>
<P>
New Forum was outlawed in September, and although the authorities have refused 
to accept it, they have made no overt effort to suppress it. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts interpreted the amnesty announcement as an attempt to limit the 
number of East Germans choosing to flee to the West and as an appeal to those 
who have already fled and may be unhappy in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts here in Munich said the announcement was a way to suggest that life 
will be better in East Germany and that those who were uncomfortable before the 
mass flight will find conditions improved if they return. 
</P>
<P>
In all, about 120,000 of East Germany's 16.6 million people have left for the 
West this year -- roughly half of them as legal emigrants. 
</P>
<P>
In another development Friday, the party newspaper Neues Deutschland quoted 
Markus Wolf, the former East German intelligence chief, as calling for greater 
openness and expressing sympathy for some of the people who have gone to the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf was quoted as telling a reporter that "the recovery of trust is demanded 
before we can develop further." 
</P>
<P>
But in the same issue, Neues Deutschland criticized one of the founders of New 
Forum, the painter Baerbel Bohley, for inviting an exiled dissident to return 
to East Berlin. Bohley had said that Wolf Biermann, a folk singer, should be 
allowed to return and sing as a measure of the authorities' commitment to 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
Biermann has described the Communist Party leadership as "old pigs," and Neues 
Deutschland said that if he meant what he said, he has "absolutely no place 
among us." 
</P>
<P>
"By what right," it asked, "does Mrs. Bohley invite such a person to the German 
Democratic Republic?"

NICARAGUA TO END TRUCE WITH REBELS;

LATIN AMERICA: HEMISPHERIC SUMMIT IS STUNNED BY ORTEGA'S MOVE TO RENEW WAR WITH 
U.S.-BACKED CONTRAS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A hemispheric summit meeting that Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez had 
billed as a celebration of democracy convened here Friday but was quickly 
overshadowed by the likelihood of renewed warfare in neighboring Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua announced after the session had ended that 
his government will resume offensive actions against the U.S.-backed Contras 
next week because the rebels have ignored a 19-month cease-fire and are 
stepping up attacks. 
</P>
<P>
"We have our hands tied with this cease-fire. We have no other option but to 
suspend it," Ortega told 600 Costa Rican law students in an auditorium across 
town from the summit site. "We will hit the Contras hard. The people in 
Nicaragua are angry. We can't go on like this." 
</P>
<P>
One of Arias' principal advisers described the announcement as "disastrous to 
Oscar" and added that it "undoes part of what he has accomplished in 
Nicaragua." 
</P>
<P>
Arias, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for his plan to pacify Central 
America, organized the summit to tackle the economic and security issues that 
threaten a decade-old trend toward democratic rule throughout Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
But within hours of the arrival in this peaceful capital city of nearly a score 
of hemisphere presidents and prime ministers, including President Bush, the 
region's continued strife had once more marred Arias' plans. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega made the decision to resume fighting before he arrived here for the 
two-day summit, hisspokesman said. Ortega did not mention the decision during 
the meeting with other government leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe he was too ashamed to bring it up with the other government leaders in 
attendance," Secretary of State James A. Baker III said when he was asked about 
the announcement. Refusing to discuss such a step with "the assembled leaders 
of Latin America" would be "less than honest," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
An end to the cease-fire would be "a step backwards," Baker added, noting that 
the United States had no official confirmation of such a decision. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, Baker said, is "concerned" that renewed fighting might be 
"seized upon" by Ortega as an "excuse" to cancel Nicaragua's elections, 
scheduled for next Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
The informal truce, which has sharply reduced the level of fighting in 
Nicaragua, began March 23, 1988, during unsuccessful talks to bring an end to 
the eight-year-old insurgency. Negotiations for a final armistice broke down 11 
weeks later, and most of the Contras retreated to camps in Honduras. But the 
opposing sides have each renewed the truce periodically since then. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega said the Contras had launched a campaign to disrupt the scheduled 
elections. He said the government's response was decided after a rebel ambush 
last Saturday near the central Nicaraguan town of Rio Blanco killed 19 
Sandinista soldiers being trucked by the army to register to vote. Two 
Sandinista mayoral candidates were killed in other attacks this week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rebel leaders have denied responsibility for the killings. 
</P>
<P>
"This action is against Nicaraguan life," Ortega said. "This action is against 
the Nicaraguan electoral process. We have a right to protect the elections." 
</P>
<P>
A South American participant in the summit said he was stunned by the 
announcement. He said the decision to resume the war was "totally 
contradictory" to the tone of Ortega's remarks during the closed-door 
afternoon-long meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"He really sounded like a statesman, talking about peaceful solutions, 
understandings with the United States," the official said. "How could he do 
that after his speech today? He's going to be totally isolated now. I thought 
Daniel was more clever than that." 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Ortega avoided each other during most of the day's meetings. At a 
welcoming ceremony for the heads of state, the United States and Nicaraguan 
flags were placed at opposite ends of the room. 
</P>
<P>
And, similarly, during the ceremonial luncheon that opened the meeting, Ortega 
and Bush were seated at opposite ends of a long head table. Ortega, wearing 
military fatigues and a red bandanna, contrasted sharply with the other 
leaders, dressed in sober business suits. 
</P>
<P>
But in spite of such precautions, the two men did exchange brief remarks while 
waiting for the summit's opening session to begin. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega, speaking later to reporters, said that he told Bush: "It's been a long 
time" since their last meeting -- in Brazil in 1985. "Don't you think, Mr. 
President, that we should see each other again and talk in depth," he said he 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega said he also told Bush, "I hope the United States will support the 
election process in Nicaragua." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, he said, responded that he would "support the will of the Nicaraguan 
people." 
</P>
<P>
"It was not what you would refer to as a serious, substantive discussion," 
Baker said of the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has supplied several million dollars in aid to Ortega's 
chief opponent in the elections, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the publisher of 
La Prensa, Nicaragua's chief opposition newspaper. Bush warmly greeted Chamorro 
with a kiss when she arrived at Friday's meeting and plans to meet with her 
again this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega, by contrast, said he was "not satisfied" with his encounter with Bush, 
because the contact was brief." But he added: "The dialogue has opened." 
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto said he told Bush: "Look, you're 
holding talks with the Soviet Union. Why not with us?" 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have said they oppose talks between the United States and the 
Sandinistas until Ortega and his colleagues agree to negotiate with their 
opponents in the Contra movement. The Nicaraguans, in turn, have refused to 
negotiate with the Contras, saying that they are U.S. puppets. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the focus on U.S.-Nicaraguan tensions, participants described the 
closed meeting as relaxed, congenial and far more wide-ranging than Central 
America. 
</P>
<P>
It was the largest such gathering in the Americas in 22 years, bringing 
together the prime ministers or presidents of Argentina, Belize, Brazil, 
Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guayana, Honduras, Jamaica, 
Nicaragua, Trinidad and Tobago, the United States, Uruguay and Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very friendly meeting," said an adviser to Arias who attended. "It 
would have been very disappointing for anyone was looking for a confrontation. 
There was none whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani urged Ortega to 
make greater efforts to cut the flow of weapons to leftist guerrillas in his 
country, but did not directly accuse him of fostering subversion. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the meeting reportedly consisted of a series of monologues on the 
problems of democracy, debt, drugs, deforestation, development and disarmament, 
with no real interchanges or debate. 
</P>
<P>
Bush spoke off the cuff for about 10 minutes, giving what was described as 
"very colloquial" and well-informed survey of the hemisphere's problems but 
offering no new initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
"He spoke with a lot of authority about what was going on with Poland and the 
rest of Socialist world," one participant said. "He said nobody wants Communism 
any more; its finished. Nobody wants dictatorship any more; its finished." 
</P>
<P>
The summit's first payoff came when Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, 
signaling a more active role in Latin America, announced that his country is 
ready to join the Organization of American States. Arias has been campaigning 
to strengthen the OAS, which has long been seen in the region as ineffective 
and dominated by Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Mulroney praised the organization, saying "the OAS is the one regional 
organization that can bring all the governments of the hemisphere together to 
deal with . . . problems that we have in common." 
</P>
<P>
And Arias expressed "great joy" over Mulroney's announcement, calling it "a 
symbol of new times we live in." Costa Rican officials said that Canada's 
presence is expected to moderate friction between the United States and Latin 
America within the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Canada's entry coincides with an appeal by Latin America's so-called Group of 
Seven nations for Cuba to rejoin the OAS. The organization expelled Fidel 
Castro's regime in 1962 but offered to readmit it in 1974. While ostracizing 
Castro as a dictator, Arias believes having Havana in the OAS will have the 
effect of moderating Cuban policies. 
</P>
<P>
Facing his colleagues at a long table in the ballroom of the Cariari Country 
Club, Arias opened the summit with a blistering attack on the hemisphere's few 
remaining dictatorships. 
</P>
<P>
He urged the elected leaders present to use "every possible diplomatic means to 
ensure that not a single tyrant remains in power in the Americas." 
</P>
<P>
"As long as even one (dictatorship) lives on there can be no peace among us," 
he declared. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega, conspicuously, did not join in the applause with which the other 
leaders greeted those statements. 
</P>
<P>
Arias appeared to criticize Ortega directly, saying, "We have often seen how 
those who led struggles against dictators themselves use the name of freedom to 
establish dictatorships of a different ideological hue." 
</P>
<P>
He also attacked Panama's Gen. Manuel A. Noriega. "The ruler whose hands are 
stained with blood or tainted with drugs and corruption has no right to govern 
any people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Arias also issued indirect but unmistakable condemnations of Castro and Chile's 
Gen. Augusto Pinochet -- dictators whom Arias did not invite to the summit 
meeting here. Also not invited was Noriega's puppet civilian president. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Costa Rican leader warned the United States that Latin 
America's democracies cannot survive without economic justice. To reverse a 
seven-year-old recession in Latin America, he said, developed countries must 
lower trade barriers, share technology and ease the burden of $410 billion in 
foreign debts. 
</P>
<P>
"It is nothing less than a betrayal of the new freedom," he said, "for us to 
accept economic rules of the game so flagrantly biased toward the rich and 
powerful." 
</P>
<P>
Arias hailed the so-called Brady Plan, which has been applied to reduce 
Mexico's foreign debt as well as that of Costa Rica, calling it "an important 
step forward." 
</P>
<P>
Before the summit began, Arias announced a successful end to negotiations to 
reduce his own nation's debts. Under prodding from the Bush Administration, 250 
private banks rushed on the eve of the summit to reschedule $1.8 billion of 
Costa Rica's foreign debt under a formula devised by Treasury Secretary 
Nicholas F. Brady for broad application in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
Arias hailed the debt agreement as "the best way we can celebrate our 100 years 
of democracy." He said that it will reduce his country's annual interest 
payments from $150 million to $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
But other Latin American leaders said that growing resistance to the Brady Plan 
from other industrialized nations and from creditor banks will make it hard to 
apply to their countries. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a good concept, but it is operating too slowly," President Jose Sarney 
of Brazil told reporters Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"If this frustration continues, the debtor nations will have no choice but to 
get together and demand joint negotiations with the banks," Sarney said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The last large gathering of Western Hemisphere heads of government took place 
in Punta del Este, Uruguay, April 12-14, 1967. Then-President Lyndon B. Johnson 
met with 17 Latin American presidents and the prime minister of Trinidad and 
Tobago to give a firm push to an old dream: the creation in Latin America of a 
common market similar to that of the European Community. The leaders signed a 
ringing declaration, embracing an ambitious plan for economic integration. But 
ever since then, regional rivalries and conflicts not only have blocked all 
progress toward the dream, but also made it seem even more remote today than it 
was 22 years ago.

QUAKE MISSING: ONLY 2 NAMES REMAIN ON LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A week after the Bay Area's killer earthquake, Elliot Clark was one of the last 
people to be removed from the Oakland Police Department's missing persons list. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, whose mother had reported him missing the day after the quake, was found 
last Tuesday when he appeared in court for arraignment on burglary charges. 
</P>
<P>
"We crossed our fingers he would show for his court date," said Oakland Police 
Officer Gary Foppiano, one of the main investigators searching for the missing. 
"He did." 
</P>
<P>
And so the missing were accounted for, gradually, methodically. A list of names 
that once topped 280 -- and fanned fears that the quake's death toll would 
reach a number four times what it now appears to be -- had dwindled to two by 
week's end. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the missing would turn up on a coroner's list, their bodies pulled from 
the wreckage of the fallen Nimitz Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
But many others, the majority in fact, would be accounted for through more 
mundane circumstances: They were in jail, they were spending a night away from 
home and had neglected to tell anybody, they were out of town. 
</P>
<P>
The task of whittling down the missing persons list, fed by worried calls from 
as far away as Spain and Finland, involved basic detective work coupled with a 
large dose of common sense, persistent phone-checking and knocking on doors. 
</P>
<P>
"We were surprised we could get through it (the list) so fast," Foppiano said. 
</P>
<P>
Most names on the list came out of telephone calls from friends, family members 
or co-workers reporting someone had dropped out of sight. Other names were 
added when crumpled cars were recovered from the Nimitz wreckage and the 
drivers, whose names usually could be traced from the license plates, could not 
be found at home or in hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators worked from two ends: Oakland police tracked people; the 
California Highway Patrol tracked vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
From the first hours after the Oct. 17 quake, 20 police officers and support 
personnel staffed a dozen telephone lines around the clock to take missing 
persons reports. The phone number went out nationwide, and more than 1,000 
calls poured in. 
</P>
<P>
The calls were screened. Did the possible victim have reason to be in Oakland? 
What was the likelihood he or she would have been on the Nimitz Freeway? Some 
reports were vague -- people who said they had relatives "visiting California." 
Others were more specific, signaling the Nimitz Freeway as the missing person's 
normal route home. 
</P>
<P>
The most remote, unlikely reports were discounted out of hand. The rest were 
recorded and investigated. First, officers would call back the person who filed 
the report every four hours to check whether the missing person had returned. 
</P>
<P>
That process eliminated scores of names. Through the early days, the numbers on 
the list fluctuated wildly -- up as high as 281 one day, down to fewer than 100 
and then back up. 
</P>
<P>
"The names were constantly changing, the numbers were constantly changing," 
recalled Oakland Police Capt. Jim Hahn. "You'd locate four people, five more 
would be called in. . . . "I guess we're going to have one heck of a phone 
bill," Hahn continued. "We were calling all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
Police also received a fax every six hours from hospitals updating their lists 
of injured. This, too, helped to weed out names from the list of the missing. 
</P>
<P>
As calls were being made, Highway Patrol and Fire Department rescue teams were 
recovering cars and license plates from the Nimitz wreckage. Owners were being 
traced through the plates, and investigators began matching those names with 
names on the missing persons list. 
</P>
<P>
By last Sunday, police believed that most cars on the freeway had been located, 
and 38 bodies had been recovered. Forty-seven people remained unaccounted for, 
according to Sgt. Greg Hughes, head of the Police Protective Services unit that 
includes the missing persons bureau. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Hughes assigned two investigators to each name. Officers began 
knocking on doors, visiting family and friends, leaving notices on vacant 
houses asking residents to check with authorities, talking to neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Police from as far as Coral Gables, Fla., the listed address for one of those 
reported missing, were called on to help track down people. 
</P>
<P>
A Bakersfield man was reported missing by a friend and could not be located for 
days because he and his wife were out of town on vacation. Another man, 
reported missing by his wife in Washington, was AWOL from the Navy and claimed 
to be suffering from a concussion that had left him disoriented, police said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to checking car and license registrations with the Department of 
Motor Vehicles, police were also researching criminal "rap sheets" to find 
arrest records. Some of the missing, at that point, were located in county 
jails. Others had court dates -- like Elliot Clark -- for which they eventually 
surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time that police were making their checks, the California Highway 
Patrol was tracing the plates on cars found at the site. In several cases, they 
had to pursue a twisted paper trail because registrations were out of date or 
improperly recorded. 
</P>
<P>
The shells of 56 vehicles and two truck trailers remained trapped in the Nimitz 
Freeway rubble as of Friday, their drivers accounted for in all but two cases. 
Those last two cases were the only names left on the missing persons list 
Friday, Hahn said, and police believe the two died on the freeway and their 
bodies are entombed in concrete. 
</P>
<P>
Many cars were found empty, their drivers having fled in the panicked moments 
when the highway overpass they were traveling on began to shake violently. Some 
made it, others did not. 
</P>
<P>
One woman who survived the Nimitz disaster abandoned her car in the mangled 
concrete, but did not report her whereabouts to authorities because she was so 
traumatized, California Highway Patrol Officer Randy Price said. 
</P>
<P>
For four days, until she finally came forward, she was another name on the 
missing persons list because her empty car had been retrieved in rescue 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
"She just couldn't deal with it," Price said. "If you get out of something like 
that unscathed, you are jubilant. Your first priority is not to contact the 
police and tell them you survived." 
</P>
<P>
One name on the missing persons list was that of Buck Helm, the longshoreman 
pulled from his crushed car Oct. 21, four days after the quake. As soon as Helm 
was discovered, but before he was identified and rescued, a homicide detective 
at the scene called Sgt. Hughes on a cellular phone with the license plate 
number. Hughes matched it to Helm's name on the missing persons list. 
</P>
<P>
Because so many of the names on the list could be easily accounted for, some 
question has arisen about whether the Police Department should have released 
what turned out to be an inflated number of missing. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said he repeatedly tried to caution journalists not to read too much into 
initial numbers of missing. 
</P>
<P>
But, in the early chaos that engulfed recovery operations at the Nimitz Freeway 
disaster scene, Alameda County Sheriff Charles Plummer added to fears that the 
toll was much higher by announcing that 250 people were believed killed in the 
collapse. Plummer has since been quoted as saying his department was "shooting 
from the hip." 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said that although the number of missing first announced now seems 
exaggerated, police were acting as responsibly as they could in difficult 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"It worked out well considering the number of calls we had and reports we 
took," Hahn said. "It was an awful lot of people to track down in a short 
period of time."

PIERCE DECLARES HIS INNOCENCE, THEN TAKES 5TH 
</P>

<P>
Former Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. declared himself innocent of 
wrongdoing Friday but again invoked Fifth Amendment protection against 
self-incrimination to avoid testifying about scandals at the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that I committed no illegal or wrongful acts," Pierce said in a 
statement to a House oversight subcommittee. "I look forward to the time when 
innuendoes and rumors to the contrary are put to rest. I look forward to the 
time when I can tell my story, and I can assure you that I have a story to 
tell." 
</P>
<P>
But Pierce refused to talk when members of the panel questioned him about his 
eight-year tenure during the Ronald Reagan Administration, declining to answer 
on the constitutional ground that it might tend to incriminate him. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Pierce's former top assistants, Lance H. Wilson and Deborah Gore Dean, 
also have invoked the Fifth Amendment in refusing to testify at previous 
hearings before the employment and housing subcommittee of the House Government 
Operations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Two Democratic congressmen said they would press for a formal demand that Atty. 
Gen. Dick Thornburgh appoint a special prosecutor to determine if Pierce 
violated the law at HUD or committed perjury when he testified to House 
investigators last May. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law providing for appointments of independent counsels, the attorney 
general must consider such a step if a majority of the Democratic or Republican 
members of the House Judiciary Committee request him to do so. If he refuses, 
he must explain his reasons in writing. 
</P>
<P>
Reps. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Bruce A. Morrison (D-Conn.), who serve on 
the Judiciary Committee and attended the oversight hearing as observers, said 
that they would seek signatures of other Democrats on the judiciary panel and 
forward the request to Thornburgh next week. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is clear from these hearings . . . that there is criminal activity 
at HUD in the area of defrauding of the federal government, conspiracy to 
defraud the government, and we may well have perjury," Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sam Pierce is stonewalling," Schumer said. "Our only choice now is to take the 
process from the legislative arena and move it into the arena of an independent 
counsel." 
</P>
<P>
Pierce, who last Sept. 26 became the first former Cabinet officer since the 
Teapot Dome scandal of the 1920s to take the Fifth Amendment before a 
congressional committee, renewed his accusation of bias against the House 
investigative panel. 
</P>
<P>
But he immediately invoked his constitutional privilege to remain silent, even 
when asked such questions as whether he had obtained all the documents he needs 
from HUD to prepare for his appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), chairman of the panel, said its hearings over 
the last five months have disclosed a "colossal scandal" at HUD during Pierce's 
tenure, including fraud, embezzlement and rampant political favoritism. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lantos contended that Pierce legally had waived his right to remain 
silent on many subjects by his voluntary testimony last spring, he said that he 
would not seek to prosecute Pierce for contempt of Congress for refusing to 
answer questions at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is the American people on the whole know all they want to know 
about HUD . . . . I have high hopes the Justice Department will do its duty," 
Lantos said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) told Pierce that his previous testimony 
conflicts with sworn statements by other witnesses. "I was hoping you'd use 
this opportunity to clarify what I think could be perjury," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Pierce, accompanied by three attorneys, refused to say anything beyond 
the statement that he volunteered at the outset of the hearing. In the 
statement, he said that all of the allegations against him had been 
investigated by HUD's inspector general and found to be groundless. 
</P>
<P>
Although a report last April by HUD Inspector General Paul A. Adams set off the 
inquiry, Adams had been unable to question Pierce until the former secretary's 
last day in office on Jan. 20, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In his latest appearance before the House panel, Pierce again invoked his 
privilege as a witness to bar television, radio and photographic coverage. As a 
result, he was chased down the halls and into the street by a group of 
photographers and broadcasters as he left. 
</P>
<P>
Lantos said afterward that Pierce tried to bill the government for his legal 
fees in connection with the House hearings. He said the request had been 
rejected.

A U.N. official who resigned amid allegations of financial impropriety denied 
any wrongdoing Friday and said he stepped down because repeated attacks had 
made his job increasingly difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"It is quite clear that the function of the high commissioner requires a total 
commitment and availability to act, to convince and to galvanize," said 
Jean-Pierre Hocke, who resigned Thursday as high commissioner for refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Such commitment had been "reduced by repeated and irresponsible attacks," he 
said. "These were the considerations that led to my resignation, which should 
not be seen as a withdrawal in the middle of the storm." 
</P>
<P>
Hocke's resignation was announced in New York after U.N. Secretary General 
Javier Perez de Cuellar ordered a broadened inquiry into allegations that Hocke 
misused agency funds to subsidize first-class air travel. 
</P>
<P>
Calling a news conference after his return from New York, Hocke read a 
statement saying his resignation does "not reflect any sentiment of culpability 
on my part concerning any of my doings."

TRADE: SOME FRICTION WITH THE U.S. STEMS FROM MISUNDERSTANDINGS, BUT AMERICANS 
HAVE A STRONG AVERSION TO UNFAIRNESS, HE ASSERTS.

<P>
After nine days of friendly toasts and gala banquets, former President Ronald 
Reagan issued a mild rebuke to his Japanese hosts today on unfair trade 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
"I've come to Japan as a friend, as someone who wants to see us get through the 
friction of our relationship so that it does not rub the relationship raw," 
Reagan said in a speech prepared for delivery today to business leaders in 
Osaka. 
</P>
<P>
He said a "communications gap" looms larger than the trade gap between the two 
countries and conceded that trade barriers account for only 15% to 20% of the 
U.S. trade deficit. But he also warned that "fairness is a very strong strain 
in the American people," and referred to the 1773 Boston Tea Party as an 
example of Yankee rancor against foreign powers. 
</P>
<P>
We don't want a Japanese Tea Party," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, whose visit is sponsored by a communications conglomerate that is 
paying him a $2-million honorarium, said, "The fact of the matter is that until 
Japan's trade barriers -- whether they're regulatory, cultural, structural, 
whatever -- until they're lowered, the focus in the U.S. is not going to be on 
whether American companies have the quality products Japanese consumers want to 
buy, but that the Japanese system won't let Japanese consumers buy them." 
</P>
<P>
He went on to warn Japan of international denunciation of its environmental 
policies, "an emotional issue that has the potential to harm Japan greatly." He 
noted the increasing news coverage in the United States of Japan's drift-net 
fishing and its tropical logging. 
</P>
<P>
"No country is without blame when it comes to the environment," he said. "But 
Japan will come under increasing pressure, perhaps even the boycott of Japanese 
products." 
</P>
<P>
His remarks were relatively harsh compared to his comments Wednesday, when he 
denounced the backlash against Japanese investment in the United States and 
said he saw "nothing wrong" with Sony Corp.'s recent $3.4-billion purchase of 
Columbia Pictures. He added, in a TV interview, that the investment might 
restore decency and good taste to Hollywood movies, which he said too often 
display immorality and vulgarity. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Reagan showed his usual optimism today, advocating a U.S.-Japan free-trade 
zone that would unite the "two greatest economic powers in the world." 
</P>
<P>
"Let us leap beyond no-win squabbling by undertaking a breathtaking plan," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. Ambassador to Tokyo Mike Mansfield first proposed such a trade 
zone, similar to the free-trade pact between the United States and Canada, but 
the idea has been given little serious attention on either side of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
While decrying American perceptions that Japan poses a greater threat to U.S. 
security than the Soviet military, Reagan also criticized some Japanese 
attitudes about a weakening America. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm told there are those in Japan who believe the United States is a declining 
superpower propped up with Japanese money and technology, that the United 
States is lazy, soft, and simply living off its past glory," he said. "Well, I 
say to those voices of demise . . . you don't understand America. You don't 
understand our strength and potential." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Nancy Reagan delivered a pointed warning about the potential for 
drug abuse in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"Please, do not be complacent in thinking that the drug tragedy cannot come to 
these islands," she said after lunch at a Tokyo hotel. "We in America were once 
complacent, too. A terrible disaster has befallen the United States. . . . 
Please do not let it happen here."

CABINET CHAOS OPENS DEEP WOUNDS FOR THATCHER; 
</P>
<P>
BRITAIN: 'SHE WILL BE A LESS POWERFUL PRIME MINISTER FOR MONTHS,' PREDICTS ONE 
EXPERT.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher "has never been worried about people loving 
her," one of her closest aides boasted to a small audience of foreigners 
earlier this week. She has strong views and says what she thinks. At the risk 
of sounding corny, the aide elaborated, you could characterize her philosophy 
as: "To thine own self be true." 
</P>
<P>
That depiction seemed particularly ironic less than 48 hours later, after a 
duplicitous bit of personnel management by Thatcher blew up in the surprise 
resignation of her longtime chancellor of the exchequer, Nigel Lawson. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation triggered a wholesale shake-up of top Cabinet posts, brought 
turmoil to the financial markets, and inspired some of the harshest criticism 
of Thatcher in the decade she has been in power. 
</P>
<P>
The Bank of England intervened heavily Friday morning to stop a slump in the 
value of the pound triggered by uncertainty over the country's future economic 
policy. Prices also fell sharply on the London Stock Exchange, despite 
Thatcher's assurance that government policies will continue "precisely as they 
were, so we shall have complete continuity." 
</P>
<P>
The British press was filled Friday with talk of political "crisis," even 
though few here see the prime minister in any immediate danger of losing her 
job. Still, according to many analysts, the affair has opened deep wounds which 
at the very least will diminish her political maneuvering room. 
</P>
<P>
"She will be a less powerful prime minister for months, or possibly right up to 
the next election," said Anthony King, professor of government at Essex 
University and a respected political commentator. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Independent titled its lead editorial, "The Prime Minister Who 
Betrayed Her Own Government." It concluded that while she may remain in office, 
"her great days are over." 
</P>
<P>
Even the tabloid Sun, Britain's largest-circulation newspaper and ardently 
pro-Thatcher, conceded that her position was "inevitably . . . shaken" by the 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson resigned Thursday after Thatcher refused his demand that she fire Alan 
Walters, her personal economic adviser, over public comments critical of the 
chancellor's policies. Within a couple of hours, Walters also resigned and 
Thatcher had a new finance minister, John Major. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lawson may have reacted partly to hurt pride, the affair goes much 
deeper than that. Walters had been speaking out for at least 18 months, since 
long before Thatcher hired him as a $50,000-a-year, part-time adviser last May. 
His position was thus seen as a clear slight to Lawson, who is the Cabinet 
officer supposedly in charge of government economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Thatcher has had policy differences with Lawson for months, and 
Walters' presence at No. 10 Downing Street was a constant reminder of the 
tension. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we have a chancellor whose position has been rendered intolerable by an 
agent of the leader," Thatcher biographer Hugo Young wrote in the Guardian. 
"Her taunting of Lawson, by failing instantly to repudiate Walters, drove the 
last big man out" of her Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
The conservative Daily Telegraph, in an otherwise sympathetic editorial, chided 
the prime minister: "Leadership, in which she excels, must not degenerate into 
dominance, intolerance, and a simple refusal to work with those she has 
appointed to serve her. Even before the Lawson decision, there was mounting 
evidence in the country of a certain restlessness with her style." 
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times recalled that just three months ago Thatcher shunted aside 
her longtime foreign secretary, Geoffrey Howe. It said that with Lawson's 
departure, she has managed to alienate two important contributors to the 
revolutionary changes known as "Thatcherism." 
</P>
<P>
"From being a government of people committed to a set of coherent, radical and 
timely ideas, it has now become a government committed to the prime minister 
herself," the newspaper said. "As she has become more pre-eminent, her 
government has become much more vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
What baffled many was the way this most determined of prime ministers was 
apparently so indecisive when it came to a policy conflict between two members 
of her governing team. Similarly, two years ago, she allowed a Cabinet dispute 
over how best to save Westland, an ailing government helicopter manufacturer, 
to fester to the point of rupture. Two of her ministers, Michael Heseltine and 
Leon Brittan, resigned in that fracas. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, wrote biographer Young, the Westland affair and Lawson's resignation 
underline a common Thatcher leadership tactic that has now received "its 
devastating comeuppance." 
</P>
<P>
Young calls it "covert distancing" -- endorsing a policy in such a way that 
there always remains a suspicion that she opposes it. "The gift (that her 
tactic) bestowed, of excusing her for policy failures, was sometimes thought to 
reveal her political brilliance," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
It works with people as well as policies, said Essex University's King, who 
said in an interview that Thatcher has a habit of "referring to other members 
of her own government as 'them' and 'they' as if she didn't have anything to do 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of Lawson's embarrassing resignation, King predicted, Thatcher 
will be forced to revert "to something more like the British norm of collective 
leadership." 
</P>
<P>
The Independent's highly regarded political columnist Peter Jenkins noted that 
the immediate policy issue underlying Lawson's departure was a dispute over 
full British membership in the European Monetary System. This is a step that 
Thatcher is loathe to take because it might amount to ceding partial control 
over her country's economic policy to the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
"Europe has been the issue underlying most of Mrs. Thatcher's biggest errors," 
Jenkins wrote. "Europe was at the root of the Westland affair, which in 1986 
provoked the resignation from the Cabinet of Michael Heseltine and, by her own 
admission, could have brought her down. 
</P>
<P>
"It was Europe which drove her to excesses which helped to lose her the 
elections to the European Parliament last June. Europe was the issue on which 
she sacked . . . (Howe) from the Foreign Office last summer, badly upsetting 
her party in the process." 
</P>
<P>
The question of Britain's future role in a more united Europe "is the big, 
seismic issue of the 1990s," agreed John Barnes, a lecturer in government at 
the London School of Economics, "and it's one the Tories are ill-equipped to 
handle at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
Barnes, who is an acknowledged expert on the Conservatives, said in an 
interview that "if Mrs. Thatcher withdrew (from office) at this point, there'd 
be a huge sigh of relief" among many in the party. However, he said, he sees 
little chance of her stepping down voluntarily. Meanwhile, "the only way there 
would be a coup against her in the Conservative party is if all the possible 
successors agreed on one of them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That is an unlikely possibility, King agreed. "Who is going to take risks with 
his political career to make someone else prime minister?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
But with the revitalized, opposition Labor Party already looking more like a 
credible alternative than at any time in the last decade, and Thatcher's 
government slipping in the polls, Lawson's startling departure clearly adds to 
the prime minister's troubles. 
</P>
<P>
As the Guardian said Friday: "Politically, this is one hell of a mess." 
</P>

POLICY DISPUTE ON GORBACHEV'S REFORMS GOES PUBLIC;

DIPLOMACY: THE ADMINISTRATION IS STRUGGLING TO CONCEAL DOUBTS THAT PERESTROIKA 
WILL SUCCEED.

<TEXT>
<P>
A long-simmering dispute within the Bush Administration over how to deal with 
the Soviet reform effort erupted Friday as the White House confirmed that 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III had killed a pessimistic speech about 
perestroika that a senior White House official had planned. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the dispute, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater 
said, are differing views over whether Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev can 
succeed with perestroika, or restructuring of Soviet society. 
</P>
<P>
"There are opinions all over the lot" on that issue, Fitzwater said. "The 
policy is clear about our wanting to support glasnost (openness) and 
perestroika," he added, but officials have "widely varying differences" over 
the "durability" of Gorbachev's reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
Taken at face value, Fitzwater's remarks suggest that Baker is more optimistic 
about Gorbachev's chances for success than is the official whose speech he 
quashed -- Robert M. Gates, the President's deputy national security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
The reality, however, may be more complex: According to some sources, Baker's 
objection to the proposed Gates speech was that it represented a public 
expression of no confidence in Gorbachev at a time when U.S. policy is to 
support his reform efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"The concern was that a down-beat analysis about the prospects would have 
looked like we're assuming Gorbachev is doomed and we're planning accordingly," 
said one official. "No one assumes he faces favorable odds, but we're out to 
advance U.S. interests, whoever is in charge there, not discuss Gorbachev's 
survivability prospects." 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's public view of perestroika's chances has important 
political implications at this time, several officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Administration has been under fire from Democrats for being too 
timid and unimaginative in responding to the Gorbachev revolution. Baker helped 
sidetrack those allegations with two speeches on U.S.-Soviet relations that 
were clearly upbeat in their outlook, emphasizing opportunities for potential 
progress. But a new, negative evaluation could have fueled more charges that 
the Administration speaks with two voices on Soviet policy. 
</P>
<P>
"The White House was sensitive to this matter, too," said one senior official. 
"That's why they sent it (Gates' speech text) around" for State Department 
comments. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater, responding to a New York Times report Friday on Baker's blocking of 
the speech, said that the question of perestroika's chances is one of 
"analysis, of interpretation of events that the State Department felt better 
left unsaid at this point." 
</P>
<P>
In his public comments on perestroika, Baker has not addressed directly whether 
he believes the reforms will succeed or fail. He deflects such questions by 
saying that only the Soviets can make the reforms work and that their success 
is in the U.S. interest. 
</P>
<P>
Gates, a former deputy director of the CIA, has long taken a skeptical view. 
The speech he planned to deliver to the National Collegiate Security Conference 
in Bethesda, Md., was understood to focus more on the obstacles to reform, such 
as the labor strikes and nationality conflicts in the Soviet Union, than on its 
limited successes. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict over the speech was the most open airing to date of foreign policy 
disagreements within the Administration. It was a major departure from the 
Administration's usual approach, which strongly discourages public discussion 
of such disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Officials confirmed that National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, in 
particular, was upset by the public squabble, in which he was forced to mediate 
between his chief deputy and Baker. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the State Department issued a 64-page report accusing the Soviet 
Union of maintaining its propaganda and "disinformation" programs aimed at the 
United States despite the relaxation of tensions between the superpowers. The 
report displayed a Cold War tone that has been notably absent from Baker's 
recent speeches. 
</P>
<P>
The report said Moscow last year ended a three-year-old effort to convince the 
world that the AIDS epidemic was the product of a bungled U.S. germ-warfare 
program. But the State Department said the Soviets were behind a rumor campaign 
this year claiming that U.S. hospitals were bringing Latin American orphans to 
the United States for use as organ donors for transplants. 
</P>
<P>
The report also asserts that Moscow has used forged letters and bogus books to 
spread stories intended to damage U.S. policies. It said Moscow relies on 
Soviet employees of the United Nations to perform propaganda and intelligence 
work. "Approximately one-fourth of the Soviets in the U.N. secretariat are 
intelligence officers," the report said.

WEST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, on his first official visit to West Germany, 
aimed a stinging barb at the new East German leader, Egon Krenz, calling the 
Berlin Wall the "biggest symbol of the inadequacy" of his government. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think that a government that clearly is beset by problems on the part 
of its people -- as thousands have fled to the West in recent weeks -- has to 
know that the biggest symbol of the inadequacy of the government in East 
Germany is the continued presence of the Wall," Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
"The sooner it comes down, the better off it will be for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney called West Berlin "an outpost of freedom in the Communist world," and 
he said that the U.S. commitment to the city "will not change." 
</P>
<P>
His remarks came at the end of a second day of intensive consultations with 
West German officials. Coming against the backdrop of rapid change throughout 
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, these consultations have been dominated by 
debate over how far West Germany and its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization should go in promoting reform. 
</P>
<P>
"The key for us," Cheney said, "is to maintain that strategy that's worked so 
well for us for so many years, and then to do whatever we can to promote 
peaceful change in the East." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, who is on an eight-day tour of Western Europe, has offered "hope and 
optimism" for the success of reform efforts in the Soviet Union and Eastern 
Europe. But he has tempered his comments with a repeated call for military 
vigilance. 
</P>
<P>
"It is far too soon for us to declare that the Cold War has ended or that peace 
is at hand," he told soldiers of the U.S. Army's 3rd Armored Division, based in 
West Germany's Fulda Gap. "It's far too soon at this point to believe that we 
can reduce our forces in West Germany" in response to unilateral Soviet 
reduction. 
</P>
<P>
But Cheney told reporters in West Berlin that "some change in U.S. deployments 
in Berlin" might be possible "if in fact we see continued peaceful change in 
the East and if we're able to negotiate mutual and balanced reductions in 
conventional forces." 
</P>
<P>
About 6,000 U.S. troops are stationed in West Berlin. Most of them gather, 
analyze and relay back to the United States intelligence on East Bloc military 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
Today Cheney is scheduled to review those troops, and to receive briefings on 
their readiness to monitor arms control agreements. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting Friday with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Defense 
Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg, Cheney pressed for assurances that Bonn will do 
nothing to rule out the modernization of short-range nuclear weapons after 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
He repeated President Bush's assurances that the United States firmly backs 
West Germany's desire for reunification with East Germany, despite the 
reservations of many in Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm perfectly comfortable, as is President Bush, with the proposition that at 
some point we may in fact see the reunification of Germany," Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
In an unexpected concession on the long-running debate on "burden sharing" 
among NATO allies, Cheney said he believes that West Germany's financial aid to 
Eastern 
</P>
<P>
European nations undertaking democratic reforms should be counted against its 
responsibilities in helping to pay for the common defense of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly it's in our interest to see that changes are made in Poland," Cheney 
said. "I think we ought to push that (West German financial aid), and I think 
it ought to count if we're going to talk about burden sharing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Heavy emigration has been an embarrassing problem for Communist East Germany 
since its founding in 1949. More than 3 million of its citizens had fled to the 
West by 1961. Seeking to stem the flow, the regime built the hated Berlin Wall 
-- miles of heavily guarded concrete slabs and barbed wire that seal off 
Communist East Berlin from free West Berlin. More than 70 East Germans have 
been killed trying to scale it, but countless others have succeeded in crossing 
at the Wall or other heavily fortified borders.

BRITISH TOURIST'S DEATH IN PARK WAS MURDER, KENYA COURT RULES 
</P>

<P>
A British tourist whose charred bones were found in a game park was murdered, a 
court ruled Friday, vindicating her father's yearlong battle against state 
investigators who claimed wild animals had killed her. 
</P>
<P>
The death of Julie Ward, 28, remains unsolved, however, with no one arrested 
and the judge saying he saw no need for further investigation. Ward's father 
has charged that there was an official cover-up to protect Kenya's lucrative 
tourism industry. 
</P>
<P>
Ward's partly charred lower left leg and lower jaw were found Sept. 13, 1988, 
in the sprawling Masai Mara Game Reserve, a week after she reportedly left the 
world-renowned park while on a wildlife photography expedition. 
</P>
<P>
The state contended that she was eaten by carnivores after abandoning her 
vehicle mired in mud. The Masai Mara is home to lions, vultures, hyenas and 
leopards among other meat eaters. 
</P>
<P>
Her father, John Ward, a hotelier from Suffolk, England, contended she was 
murdered, hacked up and burned with gasoline. He pleaded with the state to 
order an inquest and spent tens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours 
in a private investigation of her death. 
</P>
<P>
"There is ample and substantial evidence that Julie Ward died of foul play by a 
person or persons unknown," Chief Magistrate Joseph Mango said at the 
conclusion of his inquiry, which began in mid-August and heard 38 witnesses 
before ending Oct. 6. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said he "saw no reason" to investigate her death further and 
rejected claims by her family that the state had engaged in a cover-up to 
protect her killer or Kenya's $360-million annual tourist trade. 
</P>
<P>
During the inquest, John Ward's attorney, Byron Georgiadis, had tried to build 
a case that Julie Ward was killed by someone who knew the game park well, had 
freedom of movement there and could have ordered or inspired a cover-up of the 
circumstances surrounding her disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed to Simon Makallah, the Masai Mara's head game warden, as a chief 
suspect, contending the game warden was able to find the young woman's remains 
hours after her vehicle was found six miles away only because he already knew 
where the remains were. 
</P>
<P>
After the ruling, Ward said he was surprised at the outcome and that he had had 
"very serious doubts" Mango would rule in his favor. He called the ruling a 
"credit" to Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the day, he came up with the verdict that was required," Ward 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But asked if he was pleased with the ruling, he said: "How can you be pleased 
to have it confirmed that your daughter has been murdered? But, yes, I suppose 
I am pleased."

WEST BANK: ROMAN CATHOLIC, GREEK ORTHODOX AND ARMENIAN BISHOPS DECRY MILITARY 
BLOCKADE OUTSIDE BEIT SAHUR, SITE OF A PROLONGED TAX REVOLT.

BEIT SAHUR, Israeli-Occupied West Bank 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soldiers barred the leaders of three Christian churches from delivering food 
Friday to Beit Sahur, a town besieged by soldiers under orders to break a tax 
revolt against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Bishops of the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Armenian churches of 
Jerusalem were stopped at a military roadblock outside Beit Sahur, a largely 
Christian town of 12,000 people at the edge of Bethlehem. With the bishops were 
three trucks carrying rice, flour and cooking oil. 
</P>
<P>
"What's going on in Beit Sahur is unjust," said Michel Sabah, the Roman 
Catholic archbishop of Jerusalem. "It is not acceptable to any churchman or any 
spiritual man who has a human conscience. Our visit was an act of pastoral duty 
to our people, who expect to hear a word of comfort." 
</P>
<P>
A soldier at the roadblock said the town had been declared a "closed military 
zone." He said the bishops were kept out for their own safety. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the churchmen rejected as "insulting" an offer by military officials to 
let them visit Beit Sahur churches in a single car with an armed escort. 
</P>
<P>
The entrances to the town are blocked by Israeli soldiers, who prevent 
outsiders from entering. The soldiers also confiscate household items, 
commercial goods, cars and machinery from the townspeople in lieu of taxes. 
</P>
<P>
After being turned away, the bishops retired to the Church of the Nativity in 
Bethlehem, which is believed by Christians to be the site of Jesus' birth. 
There they offered a brief prayer service. 
</P>
<P>
In Beit Sahur, soldiers armed with rifles stood guard at the Roman Catholic and 
Greek Orthodox churches. At the Greek Orthodox Church of the Forefathers, a 
small group of people waited in vain for their bishop's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to tell him our troubles," a woman named Rima said. "The soldiers 
took my television, my refrigerator, my furniture. They are taking everything." 
</P>
<P>
The tax raids began in mid-September, four months after the townspeople decided 
to stop paying taxes as a means of protesting the occupation. In the past week, 
troops have started arresting people who refuse to pay. Defense Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin vowed to break the revolt, which is the most significant effort 
at passive resistance of the Palestinian uprising, now almost two years old. 
</P>
<P>
The tax revolt has also drawn the attention of Pope John Paul II, who spoke out 
last Sunday in support of Palestinian demands for a homeland. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish to make my own the legitimate request of the Palestinian people to live 
in peace in their own country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1.7 million people of the West Bank and Gaza Strip are for the most part 
Muslims. There are Christian enclaves in Bethlehem, Beit Jala, Beit Sahur, Al 
Birah and a few other small towns and villages in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the Pope's remarks, Ehud Olmert, an Israeli Cabinet minister 
without portfolio and a close associate of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said 
that the Pope had shown "selective sympathy" for the Palestinians while acting 
with "indifference" toward Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers impose a dusk-to-dawn curfew on Beit Sahur, and many of them spend the 
night on rooftops watching for movement in the streets. Telephone service has 
been cut off. Soldiers have intercepted deliveries of vegetables and milk from 
private purveyors. Deliveries of cooking gas are barred, though flour is still 
permitted to come in. 
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of food shortages, residents have stocked up on dried and 
pickled foods. 
</P>
<P>
The military has banned not only the general public from entering but also 
foreign diplomats, members of Parliament and the press. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, two reporters were detained for an hour at police headquarters in 
Bethlehem after visiting Beit Sahur. They were told they would risk arrest if 
they returned.

Christian army chief Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun on Friday ruled out presidential

But acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, Aoun's chief Muslim political rival, told 
Egypt's Middle East News Agency, "The train of peace has moved, and we don't 
think anyone can stop it." 
</P>
<P>
Aoun told a news conference after talks with Arab League envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi 
that the deputies must return to Lebanon to seek public approval for their plan 
before Parliament can convene. 
</P>
<P>
A parliamentary session to elect a president and a Speaker and to endorse 
political reforms is the next stage of the peace plan sponsored by the Arab 
League and approved in Taif, Saudi Arabia, last Sunday by 58 of Lebanon's 73 
deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Parliament could meet in Beirut by Nov. 7 as scheduled, Aoun said: "It 
depends on the deputies -- if they come here or not. They have to come to see 
their people. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Reiterating his rejection of the accord, he said that if Parliament convened 
before the deputies consult voters "it will be . . . something like war." 
</P>
<P>
"If they (the deputies) are going to continue their violations, they will reach 
a dead end, not me," Aoun said. "Today, we reached an abyss and whoever falls 
in is responsible for himself." 
</P>
<P>
He accused Christian deputies of betraying the people by breaking an agreement 
not to agree to political reforms before securing a guaranteed Syrian troop 
withdrawal from Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The Taif accord delays a final decision on a total Syrian pullout until two 
years after the reforms, designed to give Muslims greater power in the 
Christian-dominated system, are implemented. 
</P>
<P>
The accord is supported by foreign powers and many leaders in the Christian 
enclave, but Aoun said he told Ibrahimi, who is trying to arrange the 
parliamentary session, that it faces many problems. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun heads a three-man Christian military Cabinet in East Beirut while Hoss 
leads a Syrian-backed government in Muslim West Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
"I want a president who can go to Parliament and say 'I am against Syria' and 
remain alive," said Aoun, adding that any electoral session outside Lebanon 
would be unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun said deputies are afraid to return to the Christian enclave, but he 
offered to provide them with bodyguards so they could meet with voters. He said 
that if they were to win the people's approval for their plan, he would step 
down.

A Palestinian suspected of strangling seven Israelis to death in Tel Aviv 
worked as an informant for the secret Shin Bet security service, Israeli 
newspapers reported. The left-wing Al Hamishmar daily said Mohammed ibn Ahmen 
Halebi, 32, of the Gaza Strip's Jabaliya refugee camp agreed to work for the 
Shin Bet in 1985 after serving five years of an 11-year sentence on charges 
including drug dealing and prostitution. Almost two weeks ago, authorities 
accused him of strangling five women and two men in what police said was a 
criminal dispute. Despite a manhunt, Halebi has eluded capture.

CONGRESS SLASHES BUSH REQUEST FOR SPENDING ON FOREIGN BASES

The Senate, after deliberating less than an hour Friday, approved an 
$8.5-billion military construction bill that makes wholesale cuts in President 
Bush's request for foreign bases but adds millions of dollars for domestic 
installations. 
</P>
<P>
By voice vote, the Senate adopted legislation that eliminates money for 
construction in the Philippines and Honduras but sweetens the military 
construction pot in the home states of ranking members of the appropriations 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, approved by the House late Thursday, now goes to President 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the bill includes $4.8 billion for military construction, $3.2 billion 
for military family housing and $500 million to begin closing 86 U.S. bases and 
scaling back five others. 
</P>
<P>
It cuts military construction spending in fiscal 1990 by $461 million from what 
was spent in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, and it is $65 million less 
than what Bush wanted to spend this year. 
</P>
<P>
Targeted for elimination was $40.8 million that Bush proposed for dormitories, 
storage facilities and other construction in the Philippines, $15 million for 
airfield improvements in Honduras and $14.4 million for improvements at U.S. 
bases in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers slashed the amounts Bush requested for work in Britain, South Korea 
and Italy also. 
</P>
<P>
"Funding for overseas military bases will continue to be a low priority until 
our allies substantially improve their contribution to the common defense . . . 
." said Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Appropriations 
subcommittee on military construction. 
</P>
<P>
National Guard, reserves and military facilities, especially those in 
Tennessee, North Carolina, California, Iowa, Mississippi and West Virginia, 
received significant increases. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration requested $87.3 million for an air station, armories 
and other construction in Tennessee, Sasser's home state. Lawmakers approved 
$109.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
In North Carolina, home of Rep. W. G. (Bill) Hefner, the Democratic chairman of 
the House subcommittee on military construction, the bill earmarks $133.8 
million for Ft. Bragg, Camp Lejeune and other installations. Bush had proposed 
$108 million.

BUDGET DEFICIT FOR 1989 IS PUT AT $152.1 BILLION; 
</P>
<P>
SPENDING: CONGRESS AND THE WHITE HOUSE REMAIN LOCKED IN A STALEMATE OVER A 
CAPITAL GAINS TAX CUT. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Congress and the White House remained locked in an acrimonious budget stalemate 
over the capital gains tax Friday, even as the Treasury Department announced 
that the deficit for fiscal 1989 remained essentially unchanged for the third 
year in a row at $152.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Richard G. Darman, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, 
accused Democratic leaders in Congress of a "gross double standard" for 
resisting Bush's capital gains proposal. Darman complained to reporters that, 
while Democrats criticize a capital gains tax cut as a long-term drain on the 
budget, they are simultaneously pushing their own spending initiatives, such as 
child care and Medicaid expansion. 
</P>
<P>
But Darman conceded that the White House is willing to accept such measures as 
part of a compromise if Congress would just go along with the White House's 
proposed capital gains tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see the stalemate broken," he pleaded. 
</P>
<P>
But he was forced to acknowledge that the chances of winning a capital gains 
tax cut this year are growing dimmer. Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.) has thrown a series of procedural roadblocks in the way of a tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
"Either Mitchell changes his mind for some reason or other," Darman said, "or 
enough members go through the process enough times" that they would desert the 
Senate leadership. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about his estimate earlier this month that the odds for a capital 
gains cut had improved to 8 to 5, Darman insisted that he had intended the 
prediction as nothing more than a joke. It "was not the product of an entirely 
rational process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The budget wrangling continued on another front as well -- the bill to raise 
the statutory limit on the national debt. Without legislation, the debt ceiling 
will revert next Wednesday to $2.8 trillion from its temporary level of $2.87 
trillion, and the Treasury will lose its authority to borrow the additional 
money it will need to finance the government. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Republicans are seeking to offer a capital gains tax cut as an amendment 
to that bill on the Senate floor. Their proposal would provide a greater tax 
break for profits on the sale of investments held for longer periods and it 
also would exempt from taxation the money withdrawn from a new type of 
individual retirement account. 
</P>
<P>
Until Thursday, it appeared that the issue would have to be settled by next 
Tuesday night, or else the government would run out of money. But then the 
Treasury Department announced that it would sell $17 billion worth of 
government securities before Tuesday night, thus prolonging the deadline for 
passing the debt ceiling bill. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats attacked that plan Friday as a politically motivated attempt to buy 
more time to round up votes for a capital gains tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no limit to what they will do to advance their cause," 
Mitchell said. "It is a transparent political move to get a capital gains tax 
cut." 
</P>
<P>
Republicans defended the move by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady to sell 
the government securities as a prudent action to ensure that Social Security 
checks go out next Friday. But Democrats insisted that there was never any 
doubt that Congress would extend the debt ceiling to avoid a government 
shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
Darman decried the drive in Congress to exempt the Social Security trust fund 
from the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. He pointed out that it could have 
the unintended consequence of threatening the long-run security of Social 
Security funds by making it easier for lawmakers to spend the surplus on new 
social programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Simply taking Social Security out of the Gramm-Rudman calculations is a step 
in the wrong direction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The $152.1-billion deficit for fiscal 1989, which ended Sept. 30, was slightly 
lower than the $155.2-billion deficit of fiscal 1988 and a bit above the $149.7 
billion in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Revenues totaled $990.8 billion in 1989, up from $908.2 billion in 1988. 
Outlays rose to $1.14 trillion from $1.06 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
With the deficit stalled at about $150 billion, Congress is considering ways to 
modify Gramm-Rudman, which calls for a balanced budget by 1993. While most of 
the proposals would have the effect of delaying the day when the federal 
deficit is eliminated, Darman suggested that lawmakers should strengthen the 
law through a number of reforms, including eliminating a loophole that allows 
increased spending once the fiscal year has begun. 
</P>
<P>
He said also that there should be a provision requiring lawmakers to have a 
separate vote if they want to reverse the automatic spending cuts that are 
triggered when Congress fails to reach the deficit target.

TRITIUM MISSING BUT THEFT OF GAS IS DOUBTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The Energy Department said Friday that it has suspended commercial shipments of 
tritium, a radioactive gas used primarily in nuclear weapons, because small 
quantities are missing. But an official called the action "no big deal" and 
suggested that shipments may be resumed next week. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Phil Keif said that a review of the matter is "pretty well over" and 
that Energy Secretary James D. Watkins is expected to make a decision next week 
on whether to resume shipments from Oak Ridge National Laboratory near Oak 
Ridge, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Most tritium is used in nuclear weapons, although some is used in making 
medical diagnoses and in manufacturing luminous lights and dials. 
</P>
<P>
Keif said that some commercial customers had not received all of the gas 
supposedly shipped from Oak Ridge. Other quantities have disappeared from test 
shipments between lab buildings at the facility, which is operated by Martin 
Marietta Corp. under a contract with the government. 
</P>
<P>
He said that there are no suspicions that the unaccounted-for quantities had 
been stolen or diverted to nuclear weapons manufacture by another nation or 
group. 
</P>
<P>
"It may have been leaks of the gas, or maybe sloppy handling or sloppy 
measurements," Keif said. 
</P>
<P>
The department last July announced a halt in tritium shipments from Oak Ridge 
after an inconclusive search for about 5 grams of missing tritium. Lab records 
showed that the 5 grams had been shipped to commercial customers, but the 
customers claimed it never arrived. 
</P>
<P>
In August, the department said that it was resuming most shipments after 
finding bits of the missing material and discounting the likelihood of theft. 
</P>
<P>
A confidential internal report disclosed that less than 2 grams of tritium had 
disappeared in a subsequent test aimed at trying to determine the cause of the 
"losses." The report, obtained by the Associated Press under a Freedom of 
Information Act request, said three-quarters of a test sample disappeared 
during a round trip of loading and unloading between two labs. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), who has raised questions about the 
disappearances, ridiculed the test results. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to wonder what kind of Keystone Kops operation the Department of 
Energy has down at Oak Ridge when they lose more than 22,000 curies of tritium 
in a test designed to find out why DOE keeps on losing track of tritium," he 
said. A curie is a unit of radioactivity. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the possibility of a diversion for nuclear weapons purposes, it's time 
we started getting some answers," he said.

BUSH VETOES D.C.'S USE OF OWN TAX FUNDS FOR ABORTIONS

<P>
President Bush vetoed the District of Columbia's $3.4-billion annual spending 
package Friday because it would permit use of city tax dollars for 
Medicaid-funded abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's widely expected veto was announced by the White House when the President 
arrived in Costa Rica for a two-day visit. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, regrettably, the Congress has expanded the circumstances under 
which federal funds could be used to pay for abortion. I am therefore compelled 
to disapprove," Bush said in a statement handed to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The veto occurred two days after the House sustained Bush's veto of a labor, 
health and education spending bill that permitted use of Medicaid funds for 
abortions for poor women made pregnant through rape or incest. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has said he supports abortions in such cases but opposes any change in the 
current law, which bars federal funds for abortions except in cases in which 
the life of the mother is endangered by the pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
The latest veto was imposed despite protests from city officials that the 
district's anti-drug efforts would be imperiled unless the spending package was 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the bill was $32 million in extra federal money to pay for the 
hiring of 700 additional police officers, more judges and a variety of 
school-based drug education and prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
Congress approved the anti-crime package to help the capital battle its record 
homicide rate and drug-related crime wave. The bill also included a payment of 
$435 million to make up for local tax revenue lost on federally owned property. 
</P>
<P>
The city's mayor, Marion S. Barry Jr., said he was outraged by the veto and 
said it would probably force the borrowing of millions of dollars to continue 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
"This veto has disrupted and interrupted our financial management system in a 
very catastrophic way," Barry told reporters. "We've been held hostage to a 
national issue." 
</P>
<P>
The abortion debate began in July, when the House voted to allow the district 
to use its own tax money to pay for abortions under the Medicaid program. At 
the time, lawmakers said the city was given the right because of last summer's 
Supreme Court ruling that granted states great latitude in regulating 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
The city traditionally has funded abortions for low-income women. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said earlier this week that they do not expect the House and 
Senate each to muster the two-thirds vote necessary to override Bush's veto.

Leaders of the nation's largest and oldest Latino civil rights organization 
wrested control of its charitable foundation from the foundation's board of 
directors Friday in a continuing dispute over a failure to account for as much 
as $88,000 in donations. 
</P>
<P>
"This should be a lesson to all of us that we shouldn't be so loose with public 
money and the public trust," said Ruben Sandoval, special legal counsel to the 
president of the 140,000-member 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of those checks were payable to cash," Sandoval said. "We have no idea 
where the damn money went." 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 14 to 10, LULAC's national executive board ratified a slate of 
seven members that will operate a new charitable foundation intended to take 
the place of the existing LULAC Foundation. The vote came on the first day of a 
two-day national board meeting at a Capitol Hill hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Morga of Huntington Beach, a past president of LULAC who heads the old 
foundation's 10-member board, suggested that his group may fight the plan to 
create a new foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that the (general membership) is the only body that can undo 
the present foundation," Morga said after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Later, however, Morga said the boards of the old and new foundations may 
negotiate a compromise, in which some of the old board members would be seated 
on the new board. 
</P>
<P>
The old board is composed entirely of past presidents of the organization, 
which is based in San Antonio, and includes three Californians: Morga, Hector 
G. Godinez of Santa Ana and Mario Obledo of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"I just feel very satisfied with the outcome of this," said Jose Garcia De 
Lara, president of LULAC for 15 months. "I think we're on a trajectory of 
resolution." 
</P>
<P>
The controversy over the unaccounted-for funds, which Sandoval said passed 
through a secret bank account controlled by former LULAC President Oscar Moran, 
deeply split the Latino group. During a day of acrimonious debate, members 
loudly traded charges and countercharges in a meeting that was closed to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
Moran, who has served on the foundation's board for the last year, has denied 
that any of the money was improperly used. 
</P>
<P>
"Where the money went was for normal LULAC operations," Moran said in an 
interview after the vote. "It was a contingency account . . . a rainy-day 
account." 
</P>
<P>
Although the account was opened in August, 1985, when Moran became LULAC 
president, its existence was not discovered by LULAC's executive board until 
last March, Sandoval said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Moran had control of the account at Plaza National Bank in San Antonio 
during his presidency and maintained it when he left office and joined the 
board of the charitable foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Sandoval said about $88,000 passed through the account, which currently has a 
balance of $179. The money came almost exclusively from corporate benefactors. 
Some of the money was intended for the charitable foundation, while the rest 
was to support regular LULAC activities, Sandoval said. 
</P>
<P>
He charged that foundation members failed to investigate what happened to the 
foundation money when they were told of the existence of the account last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
De Lara also said in a public meeting last month that the Internal Revenue 
Service has launched a criminal investigation of the matter. Morga and Godinez, 
however, said they have not been contacted by any investigators. An IRS 
spokesman in Los Angeles, Robert Giannangeli, said the agency cannot confirm or 
deny any investigation in progress. 
</P>
<P>
At stake, both sides agree, is the credibility and political strength of an 
organization that was founded in 1929 and now claims 140,000 members across the 
nation. They said the victims of the battle will be those who rely on LULAC's 
charitable services. 
</P>
<P>
Moran, Morga and other members of the old foundation board have strongly 
rejected allegations of impropriety, saying that De Lara and his officers are 
pursuing a personal campaign to silence their critics. They complained that De 
Lara is operating outside of LULAC's established procedures. 
</P>
<P>
"These people are bent on usurping 60 years of LULAC history . . . for 
political reasons and reasons of vendetta," Morga said in an earlier interview. 
"The hate is there. These people really don't know how to behave in terms of 
the LULAC constitution and they really don't care." 
</P>
<P>
"The LULAC organization is the one that has the problems, and not the 
foundation," Godinez said in an earlier interview. 
</P>
<P>
De Lara, Godinez added, "ought to take care of his own dirty linen on his own 
side of the house." 
</P>
<P>
Godinez, president of LULAC in 1960-61, is a prominent Republican activist in 
Orange County and manager of the U.S. Postal Service office in Santa Ana. Morga 
was LULAC president in 1977-78 and is a financial consultant in Huntington 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Obledo, who declined to comment to The Times, was California's secretary of 
health and welfare under Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Other foundation members who were asked to resign are Manuel Gonzalez of Waco, 
Tex.; Oscar Laurel of Laredo, Tex.; Ed Pena of Washington; Roberto Ornelas of 
Dallas; Pete Villa of Seattle and Paul Garza of Laredo.

Demonstrators burned three U.S. flags on the edge of the UC Berkeley campus 
Friday to protest federal legislation making it a crime to desecrate the flag, 
university spokesman Ray Colvig said. 
</P>
<P>
Campus police watched the sidewalk flag-burning but made no arrests, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters complained that the legislation, recently approved by both 
houses of Congress, is an attempt to limit free speech. 
</P>
<P>
Colvig confirmed that at least two of the protesters were UC Berkeley students, 
but he said he had no way of knowing how many of an estimated group of 50 
demonstrators were associated with the university. 
</P>
<P>
"I love America and I love the flag, but I'm going to destroy one as a symbol 
of my protest of this attack on our basic freedoms," senior Darrel Jarmusch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Students of the University of California voted last month to 
send a letter to Congress expressing opposition to the flag-burning measure. 
</P>
<P>
Some who watched Friday's demonstration were not sympathetic to its purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"If these people don't respect the country they're in, they can at least 
respect the symbol," said Brian Koelher, 26, a non-student. "It makes me sick 
to see them do this.

Relatives of the late actress Amanda Blake claim that the owner of a south 
Sacramento County animal preserve coerced her into leaving her entire estate to 
the refuge. Blake's mother, sister and two cousins filed suit in Sacramento 
Superior Court this week, contending that the actress actually wanted to leave 
her estate to them. The suit said she was talked into leaving it to the 
Performing Animal Welfare Society three days before she died at age 60 in a 
Sacramento hospital on Aug. 16. Blake played Miss Kitty on television's 
"Gunsmoke."

MCMARTIN PROSECUTORS BEGIN FINAL ARGUMENTS

<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutors in the McMartin Pre-School molestation trial opened the final phase 
of arguments to the jury Friday by accusing defense attorneys of intimidating 
child witnesses during their cross-examination in an attempt to stifle the 
truth. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Lael Rubin criticized defense attorney Danny Davis for 
having asked children to describe in intimate detail how they were molested. 
Rubin told of Davis asking one 12-year-old girl to demonstrate for jurors how 
she had been assaulted by using her hands to represent a penis and a vagina. 
</P>
<P>
"That's embarrassing (and) offensive," Rubin told jurors. "You should be 
offended." 
</P>
<P>
Rubin asked jurors to question the defense attorney's motives for such 
questioning. "What was he doing?" Rubin asked. "Seeking the truth or trying to 
embarrass (the witness). . . . And that's what the defense is counting on. 
Eliminate, extinguish, annihilate the truth" through intimidating 
cross-examination of the children, Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution is expected to take three days to complete its closing 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
After that, Superior Court Judge William Pounders will instruct the jury, which 
will begin deliberations in the record-breaking trial. Pounders has said the 
deliberations could take several months. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Davis completed his 5 1/2-day closing argument, in which he asked 
jurors to acquit his client, former teacher Raymond Buckey, 31. 
</P>
<P>
Co-defense counsel Dean Gits, who represents Buckey's mother, Peggy McMartin 
Buckey, 62, argued for her acquittal last week. 
</P>
<P>
Before the defense arguments, Rubin's co-prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Roger 
Gunson, gave the first phase of the prosecution's final arguments. 
</P>
<P>
The Buckeys, former teachers at the now-closed Virginia McMartin Pre-School in 
Manhattan Beach, are on trial on one count of conspiracy and 64 counts of child 
molestation in the alleged sexual abuse of 11 pupils from 1978 until 1983.

LEYKIS LEADS COUNTERATTACK AGAINST FCC FINES; 
</P>
<P>
RADIO: KFI AFTERNOON DRIVE-TIME PERSONALITY SAYS HE'LL PROBABLY DEDICATE 
SEVERAL SHOWS TO INDECENCY ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Blasting the Federal Communications Commission for renewing a "witch hunt" 
against radio, KFI-AM talk show host Tom Leykis on Friday echoed the feelings 
of many broadcasters angered by an escalating 3-year-old war that the 
regulatory agency has waged against allegedly indecent broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
"Conservatives (on the commission) are hypocrites," Leykis told The Times, 
following the commission's announcement Thursday that KFI was one of four 
stations it was fining for indecency. Leykis said his popular 2-6 p.m. show, 
would probably be dedicated to the indecency issue for at least the next 
several days. 
</P>
<P>
"The (conservatives) say that they want government off the backs of 
multimillion dollar corporations who buy up radio stations, but when it comes 
to program content, they want government right down there in our shorts," said 
Leykis. 
</P>
<P>
The FCC, under the leadership of newly appointed chairman Alfred C. Sikes, 
fined KFI $6,000 for airing allegedly indecent remarks over Leykis' afternoon 
drive-time show last November, January and April. According to Leykis and KFI 
general manager Howard Neal, callers to the show apparently made the allegedly 
offensive statements during programs when the announced topics of discussion 
involved penis size, "the grossest thing you ever put in your mouth" and 
"sexual secrets." 
</P>
<P>
"Why are they singling out radio?" asked Leykis. "The fact is there is nothing 
on my show that you don't see on television on 'Oprah,' 'Geraldo,' 'Donahue' or 
'A Current Affair.' " 
</P>
<P>
Since the FCC began its campaign against indecency three years ago under former 
FCC chairman Dennis Patrick, only one television station has been fined. The 
$3,000 fine, levied against KZKC-TV in Kansas City for broadcasting frontal 
nudity during a prime-time airing of the R-rated movie "Private Lessons," was 
later rescinded. 
</P>
<P>
During the same 3-year period, however, at least 15 radio stations have been 
fined or formally scrutinized by the commission for alleged indecency. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to KFI, two Miami stations and a Las Vegas station were fined 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the stations are FM music stations that were each fined $2,000 for 
playing songs with allegedly indecent lyrics. KLUC-FM in Las Vegas was cited 
for playing Prince's "Erotic City" while WZTA-FM was censured for playing 
"Penis Envy" by the all-female a cappella group the Roches. 
</P>
<P>
In all four instances, the material that the FCC found offensive was broadcast 
before 8 p.m. In September, the commission dropped its complaint against 
KZKC-TV because, in part, the movie aired after 8 p.m., when young children are 
less likely to be in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
The FCC voted 4-0 Thursday to launch an inquiry into the possibility of 
imposing a 24-hour ban on indecent broadcasts "to protect the American people, 
especially children, from exposure to indecent material." 
</P>
<P>
Both Prince and the Roches have been singled out in the past by the 
Washington-based Parents Music Resource Center for allegedly being obscene. 
"Its amazing to me that 'Erotic City' was released in 1984 and they're only now 
geting around to it," Warner Bros. Records spokesman Bob Merlis said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
As long as four years ago, such popular Los Angeles music stations as KIIS-FM 
and KROQ-FM included the Prince recording on their regular playlists, and it 
still is aired from time to time as an "oldie" on several FM stations locally. 
</P>
<P>
Merlis said that the Roches left Warner Bros. for Rhino records before 
recording "Penis Envy," but that Prince, who is still a Warner Bros. artist, 
has never made a secret of the frank sexual nature of much of his music. Though 
the company seeks "as much airplay to our stuff as possible, ultimately it's up 
to the radio stations what they play." 
</P>
<P>
"Penis envy is a clinical term," Merlis said in defense of the Roches. "If you 
can't say penis envy on the air, how is it that Dr. Ruth (Westheimer) can get 
her own show?" 
</P>
<P>
KFI's sister station in Miami, all-talk WIOD-AM, was assessed an even larger 
fine than KFI: $10,000. According to an FCC spokeswoman, the fine was for 
comments made last November and December during afternoon talk jock Neal 
Rogers's program. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Rogers was Leykis' competitor on Florida radio three years ago, 
according to Leykis. Rogers was also working as the KZTA morning deejay in 
Miami when "Erotic City" was played on Oct. 27, 1987 -- the day cited in the 
FCC complaint against that station, according to KZTA program director Peter 
Bolger. Rogers subsequently left the station, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Leykis and Rogers were hired last year by Atlanta-based Cox Broadcasting, 
which owns both KFI and WIOD. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Faherty, executive vice president for Cox's 11 radio stations, said Friday 
that the company has not determined what action it will take, though it will 
probably fight the FCC fines. 
</P>
<P>
You must remember that the law says we are not allowed to broadcast material 
that is 'patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards,' " 
said Faherty. "But the FCC doesn't define 'contemporary community standards.' 
What might be acceptable in Miami or Los Angeles could be offensive to the rest 
of the country. And they're making that determination from Washington, D.C., 
where there might be a completely different community standard." 
</P>
<P>
The three KFI violations had to do with what callers said, not Leykis, 
according to KFI program director George Oliva. 
</P>
<P>
"In these cases they were stories that the callers were sharing with Tom on one 
subject or another," Oliva said. "They were sexual references." 
</P>
<P>
Oliva said that Leykis had warned his callers to be careful what they said for 
fear of inciting the FCC's wrath. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, Tom warned his audience about taking the show in the wrong 
direction," Oliva said. 
</P>
<P>
KFI General Manager Howard Neal said that the station has since installed a 
"dump" button that enables the show host or producer to immediately get rid of 
callers who may begin saying something objectionable. 
</P>
<P>
"Technically I think we should have dumped them out," Neal said. "At that time, 
we didn't have the dump button. It had not been installed at that point." 
</P>
<P>
The FCC's Thursday action was the result of the commission's Mass Media Bureau 
clearing up a 2-year backlog of 95 indecency complaints. In addition to the 
four stations that were fined, four more were sent letters requesting a defense 
against complaints about the broadcast of explicit conversations, songs and 
skits about sexual acts. The four stations were KCCL-AM/FM in Paris, Ark.; 
KSD-FM of St. Louis; WWWE-AM of Cleveland, and WXRK-FM of New York. 
</P>
<P>
The WXRK complaint was lodged against veteran "shock jock" Howard Stern, whose 
morning music and talk program brought on one of the first three FCC indecency 
complaints in April, 1987. Under then-chairman Patrick, the commission publicly 
censured Stern's program, aired over Philadelphia station WYSP-FM, and two 
late-night programs aired on KPFK-FM in Los Angeles and KCSB-FM in Santa 
Barbara.

FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
Band Misidentified -- In a story Saturday about Federal Communications 
Commission crackdowns on allegedly indecent radio programming, The Times 
incorrectly reported that the Roches recorded a song called "Penis Envy," which 
was played on WZTA-FM in Miami and resulted in the FCC fining the station 
$2,000. The song was recorded by a Seattle-based folk-comedy group called Uncle 
Bonsai in 1985. The article also incorrectly stated that the Roches had been 
singled out by the Washington-based Parents Music Resource Center for allegedly 
being obscene. The organization has told The Times that it was unfamiliar with 
the all-female folk-rock group and had never criticized it. The group's first 
album in 3 1/2 years, "Speak," is being released today by Paradox/MCA.

<P>
DOCUDRAMA: EX-PRESIDENT NIXON TRIES TO STOP ABC'S "THE FINAL DAYS," BUT 
LESS-WELL-KNOWN PEOPLE CAN LOSE TV RIGHTS TOO.

Whose life is it, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
* Fifteen years after Watergate, Richard Nixon objects so strongly to his 
portrayal in the ABC dramatization of "The Final Days" that he tries to stop 
production of the three-hour docudrama. In letters to executives at ABC and 
AT&amp;T, the sponsor of the show, lawyers for the former President charge that 
his right to privacy is being violated and imply that he can sue for libel. 
According to his lawyers, Nixon's ability to do his own version of events is 
impinged upon by the TV drama, which is based on the best-selling account of 
Nixon's last months in office by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. ABC, standing 
by what it says is the fairness and accuracy of the TV movie, goes ahead with 
the show. "The Final Days" is scheduled to air Sunday at 8 p.m. (ABC changed 
its mind Friday on when the movie will be rescheduled should it be preempted by 
a fifth game of the World Series, moving it back from Nov. 5 to Dec. 17.) 
</P>
<P>
* In 1982, Elizabeth Taylor files a suit against ABC and the producers of a 
planned TV biography. The actress charges that the unauthorized film infringes 
on her ability to profit from her own life story. "I am my own commodity," 
Taylor says at a news conference. "I am my own industry." The TV movie, she 
maintains, "is completely fictionalized -- unless there was somebody under the 
carpet or under the bed." Taylor's case never comes to trial, and the drama is 
not made. ABC today says the project was dropped for creative reasons. 
</P>
<P>
* Two months after he was convicted of multiple murders, Richard Ramirez, the 
infamous California "Night Stalker," is the focus of an NBC docudrama that will 
air Nov. 12. The "Night Stalker" movie joins a variety of upcoming fact-based 
TV dramas that are moving from headline to TV screen while the event still 
flashes in viewers' recollection of the evening news. Among the upcoming 
fact-based dramas on CBS, NBC and ABC are the story of Hedda Nusbaum, the woman 
whose lover was convicted of beating to death their illegally adopted daughter; 
"Small Sacrifices," with Farrah Fawcett as a woman who shot her children, and 
the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger. 
</P>
<P>
In some docudramas, the formerly anonymous people who happened into the 
spotlight have welcomed the dramatizations. But, in other instances, the people 
would have prefered to be left alone. 
</P>
<P>
Whose life is it, anyway? The question involves legal and ethical issues raised 
by the proliferation of fact-based TV movies. The most compelling conflict in 
docudramas goes to the heart of the Constitution: the confrontation between the 
movie makers' right to free speech under the First Amendment -- and the value 
of open discussion to the society -- versus the individual's right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
This is a murky area, and it depends on who the person is and what they've done 
in the past," says Robert Levine, a New York lawyer who specializes in creative 
rights. "With celebrities, it's not so much a question of privacy as a question 
of who retains the rights to commercialize their experience. There's a big 
difference between Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Nixon. She's spent her whole 
life building up the property values of her life. With 'The Final Days,' you're 
dealing with events that are part of national history. Nixon's a public figure 
whose claim to own history is not consistent with a free society." 
</P>
<P>
Although Taylor never had her day in court to test her legal theory, the 
argument still concerns those who favor the broadest interpretation of the 
guarantees of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
"One has a commercial right to exploit one's name, and Elizabeth Taylor has the 
right by and large to have facts told about her that are truthful," says Martin 
Garbus, a New York lawyer who specializes in First Amendment cases. "But Taylor 
is a public figure, and anybody can make a movie about her." 
</P>
<P>
The First Amendment protects what is said about public figures, unless it's 
said with a knowing or reckless disregard for the truth. That may lead to 
unseemly excesses in the media, Garbus acknowledges, but he argues that 
censorship is a far less attractive alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"People should be able to say nearly anything about an elected public 
official," he maintains. "If you start to decide what is protected and what's 
not, you get into very dangerous areas." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon and his lawyers argued otherwise in their letters to ABC and AT&amp;T. 
The former President should have been consulted on the TV movie, a source close 
to Nixon's lawyers said recently, and now has lost some ability to, in effect, 
merchandise his own version of events. 
</P>
<P>
"They've misappropriated his likeness to sell telephones," the Nixon source 
says. 
</P>
<P>
No one has an absolute right to privacy, and, generally, people who are well 
known have fewer privacy rights than unknowns. Yet average citizens can lose 
some of their rights if they become part of a news event. 
</P>
<P>
"Determining the difference between a public figure and a private figure can be 
very complicated," Garbus notes. "People who are public can become private, and 
private people can become public." 
</P>
<P>
The family of murder victim Jennifer Levin, for example, did not cooperate in 
the making of the "Preppie Murder" movie that aired on ABC recently, yet they 
were depicted. According to attorney Garbus, the Levin family fell into "a hazy 
area" where they may be public figures when it comes to what was known and seen 
in court by the news media at the time of Robert Chambers' trial, and private 
figures when it comes to intimate details of their private lives. 
</P>
<P>
Being a participant in a celebrated court case is one likely way to find one's 
life turned into a book, play or TV movie. Court testimony is a matter of 
public record, and it can be used in docudramas, such as an upcoming NBC movie 
about the white youths who chased a black man to his death in Howard Beach in 
New York. In some cases -- among them the trial of Jean Harris on NBC and the 
trial of Bernhard Goetz on PBS -- the court transcripts simply have been 
fashioned into TV courtroom drama. 
</P>
<P>
Although they may be able legally to portray a variety of people in docudramas, 
producers say that, as a practical matter, they often try to gain the 
cooperation of their subjects. That ensures the movie makers access to the full 
story -- and guards against possible lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
For a 1988 movie about Uli Derickson, the flight attendant who was a heroine in 
a 1985 hijacking, NBC did buy her rights. "We could have done the story from 
the public record without her permission," says Don Zachary, vice president of 
legal affairs at NBC. "But we wanted to portray a human side, how she felt, 
what her relationship with her mother was." 
</P>
<P>
"I always go to a highly visible public figure and offer them the opportunity 
to participate," says Louis Rudolph, who has produced many historical 
docudramas, including TV movies on Lyndon B. Johnson and Dwight Eisenhower. "In 
no way are we giving script approval, but they can look at the script and tell 
us what they know." 
</P>
<P>
But he says he did not follow that practice with his latest film, "Small 
Sacrifices," an ABC movie airing Nov. 12 in which Farrah Fawcett plays Diane 
Downs, a woman who shot her children. Rudolph says he made no attempt to 
contact the subject, instead buying the rights to the best-selling book on the 
case by Ann Rule. 
</P>
<P>
Neither he nor Rule paid any money to Downs for her story, Rudolph says. "That 
would be feeding into sociopathic behavior." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, in many states, criminals convicted of committing crimes with victims 
are prohibited from profiting from dramatizations of their story under 
so-called "Son of Sam" laws, named for a notorious murder case in New York. 
</P>
<P>
As for "The Final Days," Alfred Schneider, ABC's vice president for broadcast 
standards and practices, says that the network not only discussed the reporting 
in the 1976 book with co-author Bob Woodward but also consulted other sources 
of information about the revelations it contained. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Nixon has taken no legal action against the movie. But, in a personal 
protest, he canceled his AT&amp;T phone service and switched to a competitor.

PAULEY EMOTIONAL OVER 'TODAY' EXIT 
</P>

Ending a month of speculation about her future, Jane Pauley made it official 
Friday: She's leaving the "Today" show after 13 years as co-anchor. In an 
emotional announcement during the broadcast, Pauley told viewers that she will 
depart at the end of the year, as previously had been reported, to start a 
prime-time news magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that she regretted recent rumors assigning "roles they did not play" in 
her departure to fellow anchors Bryant Gumbel and Deborah Norville, Pauley 
clutched hands with Norville at the anchor desk and received a glowing, gruff 
tribute to "my buddy here" from Gumbel. 
</P>
<P>
Norville, who recently signed a 5-year contract with the network, will take 
over Pauley's job as "Today" co-anchor. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like someone who is packing up to leave home," Pauley said in an 
interview later. "There were tears when the staff got together after the show, 
but I feel excited about the future." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the prime-time news magazine, for which Tom Brokaw has been 
mentioned as a possible co-host, Pauley will contribute reports as a special 
correspondent on the "NBC Nightly News." She also will anchor a prime-time 
special in the spring on the subject of change in people's lives. 
</P>
<P>
Pauley's departure comes after weeks of speculation about rivalry between 
Pauley and Norville, who in August was promoted to a role as news anchor that 
placed her side-by-side with Pauley and Gumbel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's out-and-out sexism," Norville said in an interview Friday of the rumors. 
"Jane and I are friends, and to see that kind of portrayal denigrates the 12 
years I've spent trying to grow as a news reporter." 
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to Pauley, NBC's handling of Norville's promotion 
was one of the factors in her decision to leave. "Today" has not only a new 
executive in charge, Dick Ebersol, but also a new senior executive producer, 
David Nuell, and Pauley is said to have been concerned about the direction of 
the show and her role in it. 
</P>
<P>
Ebersol said Friday that he did not want the popular Pauley to leave "Today." 
But she said, "All of these changes were cumulative. After 13 years, I thought, 
'I don't need writing in the sky to say it's time to go.' "

HAAS' PLAYS KEEP EL TORO IN RIGHT SPOT

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The timing of El Toro High School linebacker/tight end Brian Haas' first pass 
reception and first interception of the season couldn't have been better. 
</P>
<P>
Haas caught a seven-yard pass for the go-ahead touchdown and then intercepted a 
pass with 57 seconds remaining to preserve the Chargers' 21-14 victory over 
Mission Viejo Friday night in front of 6,200 fans. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the second straight for Mission Viejo (6-2, 1-2) following 11 
consecutive victories in the South Coast League over the past three years and 
was only the fifth loss for the Diablos in three years. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro (8-0, 3-0) broke a 14-14 tie with 5:07 remaining when quarterback Steve 
Stenstrom teamed with Haas on an eight-yard scoring play in the right corner of 
the end zone. Stenstrom completed four consecutive passes in a 62-yard drive 
that decided the game. 
</P>
<P>
Haas ended any hopes of a Mission Viejo comeback when he stepped in front of a 
receiver at midfield and intercepted quarterback Tim Snowden's pass. It was 
Snowden's third intercepted pass of the night. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just in the right place at the right time," said Haas, who also 
recovered a fumble. "They put me in on goal-line offense, and I happened to get 
open for the touchdown. Then, we went into a prevent defense, and the guy 
throws the ball right to me." 
</P>
<P>
Haas' only wrong move came in the waning moments, when he failed to return to 
the field while answering a reporter's questions, forcing Stenstrom to call a 
timeout. Bob Johnson, El Toro coach, credited his team's defense and 
Stenstrom's passing as the difference in the well-played game. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a league championship-type game between two great teams," Johnson 
said. "Our defense was as much a factor in this game as it's been in any we've 
played this year. Every time it looked like the game was going to turn around 
in Mission Viejo's favor, we got an interception or a sack or a fumble 
recovery." 
</P>
<P>
Stenstrom, whom Johnson has billed as the county's best quarterback all season, 
made his coach look good by completing 15 of 28 pass attempts for 241 yards and 
two touchdowns. El Toro needed all his passing skills with its rushing game 
limited to just 31 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Oakman also was outstanding for El Toro. Oakman rushed for 31 yards in 
nine carries and caught five passes for 95 yards, including a 21-yard screen 
pass for a score. 
</P>
<P>
Oakman got El Toro off to a quick start by returning the opening kickoff 44 
yards to set up the Chargers' first score. Danny Maestas gave El Toro a 7-0 
lead when he scored on a seven-yard run four plays after Oakman's kickoff 
return. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo scored on its second possession of the second half, with tailback 
Mark Gaw going 10 yards for a touchdown.

DEFENSE KEY TO TUSTIN'S 24-7 VICTORY

TUSTIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four weeks ago, El Toro High School quarterback Steve Stenstrom, Orange 
County's passing leader, had his way with Tustin's secondary in a 44-25 
victory. Tustin Coach Marion Ancich knew then that his pass rush needed an 
overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin showed the task was complete Friday night in a 24-7 victory over 
defending Southern Section Division VI champion Corona del Mar (5-3, 1-2) in 
front of 450 at Northrup Field. 
</P>
<P>
Ancich credited his defensive front line with putting the pressure on Corona 
del Mar and taking it off the Tustin secondary. 
</P>
<P>
The Tiller defense limited Corona del Mar to 135 yards, holding quarterback 
Todd Kehrli to 64 yards passing on 9 of 19 completions. Thirty-four of those 
yards came on one play, a completion to Weston Johnson, late in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin (5-3, 2-1) had 320 yards, with quarterback Andy Borza accounting for 183 
of those yards on 11 of 14 completions with two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The Tillers had a 17-point, second quarter with some big plays. After a 39-yard 
field goal by David Basurto put Tustin ahead, 3-0, the Tillers' Josh Beldon 
recovered Jerrott Willard's fumble at the Sea King 44. Two plays later, Borza 
found wide receiver Frank Mercuri 10 yards beyond the Corona del Mar secondary 
and hit him with a 43-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
On its next possession, Tustin went 73 yards in seven plays and again the big 
play was a pass from Borza to Mercuri, this time for 30 yards and a touchdown. 
Mercuri caught only three passes, but he made the most of them, totaling 99 
yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"We played probably our most complete football game this year," Ancich said. "I 
don't know if it is good enough to compete against Estancia (7-0, 2-0) . . . 
but (Corona del Mar) is a tough physical team. 
</P>
<P>
"Kelvin Love began to run tonight, our wide receivers began to catch a few 
passes, and Borza had a fine game." Love gained 77 yards in 11 carries while 
sharing the rushing duties with three other backs. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar was without standout wide receiver/defensive back Warren 
Johnson, who has five interceptions. He missed the game with a leg injury.

VILLA PARK PREVAILS IN 'PUNCH BOWL' 
</P>

<P>
For three quarters Friday night, it was downright brutal. Villa Park and El 
Modena high schools traded body slams, insults and, for a brief time, punches. 
</P>
<P>
The Century League game, played in front of 3,800 at El Modena, took on the 
tone of a street fight. And the teams seemed bent on establishing the machismo 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the game was a test of bravado and little else. Neither team had scored 
in the first three quarters and neither looked particularly interested in 
scoring, not when it was more fun to knock each other to the turf. 
</P>
<P>
Then the fourth quarter started, and the teams realized there was a football 
game at stake. It wasn't exactly a clean knockout, but Villa Park rallied for 
an 8-7 decision. 
</P>
<P>
This was a game both teams needed to win to stay in contention for the league 
championship. With two games left in the regular season, Villa Park is 5-3 
overall and 2-1 in league play. El Modena fell to 2-5-1, 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
For a long time, it appeared the game would end in a scoreless tie. Neither 
team could move the ball as the defenses dominated. 
</P>
<P>
The only scoring opportunities were three missed field goals -- two by El 
Modena. The vicious hitting was primarily responsible for the lack of offense. 
</P>
<P>
A brief second-quarter fight featured tamer blows than some of the legal hits. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, with 10:29 left, El Modena scored on a seven-yard touchdown pass from 
quarterback Adam Garcia to Yuri Shallan. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park still struggled and, after its second series of the fourth quarter 
ended in a fumble at the El Modena 33, was facing a 7-0 deficit with 6:11 left. 
</P>
<P>
But El Modena couldn't do anything with the ball and punted it back to Villa 
Park with 3:42 left. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park started at its own 33, but a 38-yard gain on a pass from quarterback 
Jason Martian to Eric Helms moved the Spartans to the El Modena 29. Five plays 
later, Villa Park was at the three with 1:53 left. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Bladow scored on a three-yard burst up the middle on the next play. Villa 
Park Coach Pat Mahoney then opted to try for a two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
Martian took the snap, rolled to his right then threw back to the left toward 
the back of the end zone. There, waiting behind El Modena defenders Garcia and 
Kevin Giordano, was running back Shawn Potter, who outjumped the two and came 
down with the reception. 
</P>
<P>
"We threw two touchdowns last week (in a 21-14 victory over Santa Ana) with 
that same little sprint, flood pass," Mahoney said, explaining the game-winning 
conversion pass. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our goal-line pass play. We tried a different wrinkle, sneaking Potter 
out of the backfield."

MATER DEI DEFENSE STIFLES BISHOP MONTGOMERY IN 26-6 VICTORY

<P>
Mater Dei Coach Bruce Rollinson could have credited the Monarchs' 26-6 victory 
over Bishop Montgomery Friday to tailback Kealii Clifford, who scored three 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
But he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
And Rollinson could have given all the praise to quarterback Dan O'Neil, but he 
didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference was we played defense," Rollinson said. "We knew Bishop would 
use the run to set up their pass. We knew if we stopped the run they would have 
trouble throwing." 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs stopped both Friday night. They held Bishop to only 78 yards total 
offense, 25 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei improved to 4-4 overall and 2-1 in the Angelus League. Bishop 
Montgomery dropped to 3-5 and 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the kids that the (league) was our mini-season," Rollinson said. "I 
told them if they dropped this game, they would back themselves into a corner." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neil, a 6-foot-2, 185-pound senior, completed 14 of 22 passes. His favorite 
target was wide receiver Tino Chavez, who caught five passes for 97 yards and a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Clifford finished with 57 yards in 18 carries, scoring on runs of one, two and 
one yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pleased with O'Neil, and Tino is doing a hell of a job," Rollinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs outgained Bishop Montgomery 176 yards to 30 in the first half. 
O'Neil completed 10 of 17 passes for 146 yards in the first half to lead Mater 
Dei to a 12-0. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neil completed five passes for 62 yards on the Monarchs' first touchdown 
drive. Clifford capped the 12-play, 76-yard drive with a one-yard touchdown run 
with 11:56 left in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei's point-after attempt by Max Habereder failed, and the Monarchs led, 
6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei got the ball on Bishop Montgomery's 49-yard line with 2:58 left in 
the half after a 33-yard punt by Brian Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
On the next play, O'Neil threw to Chavez, who had beaten defensive back Charlie 
Liane over the middle, for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neil's two-point conversion attempt to John Williams fell incomplete, and the 
Monarchs led, 12-0. 
</P>
<P>
Clifford scored with 16 seconds left in the third quarter and again on a 
one-yard dive with 9:44 left in the game to give the Monarchs a 26-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery's Ralph Zuanich intercepted a pass by backup quarterback 
Billy Blanton at the Mater Dei 24-yard line to set up the Knights' only score. 
Tailback Marvin Negrete's one-yard run with 5:26 finished the scoring.

SUNNY HILLS SLOWS DOWN, BUT EDGES FULLERTON TO STAY UNBEATEN

<P>
The defensive struggle between Fullerton and Sunny Hills high schools included 
Sunny Hills rushing for 200 yards and Fullerton getting into Sunny Hills 
territory on each of its three fourth-quarter possessions. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, people were gaining ground Friday at Fullerton District Stadium, but when 
it came to scoring, the defenses made like Gumby -- bending, but rarely 
breaking. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills (8-0, 3-0) won the Freeway League game, 9-6, scoring its only 
touchdown on a fumble recovery. The Lancers came into the game averaging 28 
points a game. They had cruised through their first seven opponents with the 
closest margin of victory a 13-point win over Esperanza three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Things didn't appear to be that much different in this one early on. Sunny 
Hills, a predominately running team that passed only two times Friday, drove to 
the Fullerton 37 on its first drive before stalling. Its second drive resulted 
in a 37-yard field goal by Matt Young with 4:28 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Fullerton (5-3, 1-2) came right back with a nine-play, 65-yard drive in 
which quarterback Rene Arias completed four of six passes, including a 24-yard 
touchdown pass to Glenn Eggert with 48 seconds left in the first quarter. John 
Bailey's conversion kick was wide and Fullerton led, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills came back with what would be the game's final scoring drive, a 
14-play, 75-yard march in which the Lancers ran 13 times. Brian Pizula, who 
rushed for 98 yards on 24 carries, carried the ball seven times for 43 yards on 
the drive. But it was running back Kenny Overby who ran 10 yards to the 
Fullerton one-yard line and, as he was struggling for another yard, fumbled 
into the end zone. Tight end Brett Ransom fell on the ball for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Turnaround being fair play, the conversion was blocked by Bailey, the Fullerton 
kicker. But Sunny Hills had the 9-6 lead it would eventually win by. 
</P>
<P>
And then it was left to the defenses. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills stopped Fullerton three times when the Indians had driven into 
Sunny Hills territory in the fourth quarter. Fullerton allowed Sunny Hills on 
its side of the field only once in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"Both defenses did a great job," said Tim Devaney, Sunny Hills coach. "This is 
a very emotional game for both teams, no matter the situation, no matter if 
it's for first place or for last, emotion played a big part in this one." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out this year, Fullerton and Sunny Hills, cross-town rivals to 
begin with, were playing for a piece of first place. Sunny Hills came into the 
game alone in first with a 2-0 record. Fullerton was tied with three other 
teams for second. 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton defense, led by outstanding junior linebacker D.C. Olsen, did 
what no other team has been able to do this year: It grounded the Sunny Hills 
ground game. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills' trio of Pizula, Overby and Mike Sullivan never seemed to get on 
track.

La Quinta High School kept its playoff hopes alive Friday night, trouncing 
Santiago, 34-0, before a homecoming crowd at Bolsa Grande. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping with a "Looney Tunes" homecoming theme, the Aztecs (4-4, 3-2) dropped a 
refrigerator on the Cavaliers (2-6, 1-4) as 6-foot-3, 318-pound Sunny Gagau 
scored two touchdowns to help keep La Quinta tied for third in the Garden Grove 
league. 
</P>
<P>
Gagau's first score came early in the second quarter when he scooped up a 
Cavalier fumble and then ran 55 yards for a touchdown giving La Quinta a 20-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
On La Quinta's next possession, after moving to the Santiago 12, La Quinta 
Coach Roger Takahashi put Gagau into the backfield where he passed to Walter 
Dawkins off a halfback option play to extend the lead to 27-0. 
</P>
<P>
"Sunny is a great athlete," Takahashi said, "it was just a little twist off the 
pitch play." MICHAEL ITAGAKI

2 UNINSURED HEART PATIENTS NEED $80,000 TO GET ON TRANSPLANT LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stephen Regalado of Mission Viejo lies in a hospital bed in intensive care at 
UCI Medical Center in Orange, his body deteriorating from the effects of a 
persistent virus that began attacking his heart nine months ago. He is 23, and 
he wants a chance to live. 
</P>
<P>
In another hospital wing, Hector Bojado, 29, of Anaheim, is suffering from the 
same heart disease -- cardiomyopathy -- an irreversible swelling of the heart 
that has left him, like Regalado, near death. 
</P>
<P>
Yet without medical insurance, they cannot be put on a heart transplant list by 
the medical center unless each raises $80,000 to help pay for his operation. 
</P>
<P>
"Money should not be a reason to die, and a hospital should not be responsible 
or it will be even more broke than it is," said Dr. Richard Ott, UCI Medical 
Center's director of cardiac transplantation. 
</P>
<P>
Escalating medical costs have prohibited such hospitals as the medical center 
from underwriting heart transplants and other major operations, said Elaine 
Beno, a medical center spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Even when the patient has insurance, some carriers do not pay for transplant 
operations because they are considered "selective" rather than conventional 
surgeries, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The first hurdle is money, Ott said. The second hurdle is getting both patients 
on a priority transplant list with the Regional Organ Procurement Agency based 
at UCLA, he said. Regalado and Bojado would be ranked on the list based on 
critical need, blood type and other factors. 
</P>
<P>
Potential heart donors must have compatible blood and tissue or the recipient's 
body most likely will reject the new heart, said Ott, who has performed seven 
transplants since April, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Fund-raising projects for both patients have been scheduled by the medical 
center's auxiliary organization, a fund-raising arm that helps indigent 
patients, said Jim Curran, a UCI Auxiliary spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we had a few months to help raise money for them, say by December," 
Curran said. "On Friday, though, we got a call from Dr. Ott who told us, 'Our 
backs are against the wall.' 
</P>
<P>
"We need to raise the money before time runs out." 
</P>
<P>
Regalado, who is 5-foot-5, now weighs only 90 pounds. He suffers from a 
sporadic and random disease that strikes only one to two people per 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Regalado's conditioned worsened, and he was put in the medical 
center's intensive cardiac care ward, where he remained stabilized. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality is he'll stay there, well, until he. . . ." Ott said, his voice 
trailing off. 
</P>
<P>
Regalado's blood pressure has weakened, even with medication to stimulate his 
heart. With the heart disabled and unable to pump enough replenishing oxygen to 
the body, other vital organs have weakened. 
</P>
<P>
Regalado's father, Albert, has been employed as an engineer at Unisys Corp. in 
Mission Viejo for 27 years. His medical insurance would have covered his son 
past the age of 19 if he were in college. But his son turned 23 on Sept. 13 and 
was working at a factory manufacturing computer cables. 
</P>
<P>
Only last November, his son was fine. Then the virus struck, his father said. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it was the flu," the elder Regalado said. When his son got worse, 
they took him to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center, "but they couldn't 
find out what was wrong with him until they called in a heart specialist," 
Regalado's father said. 
</P>
<P>
During a brief bedside interview, Regalado, a 1985 graduate of Mission Viejo 
High School, said he has always led an active life. 
</P>
<P>
Now he lies practically motionless on a hospital bed connected by wires to a 
series of monitors checking his heartbeat, blood pressure and oxygen level. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking was difficult, and he managed only a few sentences of small talk about 
his strict diet of hospital food. 
</P>
<P>
Bojado, who seemed in better shape than Regalado, has had his good and bad 
days. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel OK, but my blood doesn't circulate good in my legs, and I get tired 
pretty easy," Bojado said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Regalado, Bojado -- born in Colima, Mexico -- has no nearby family. 
</P>
<P>
"I called up my mother in Colima and told her the doctors said I would be 
getting a heart transplant. She cried. But I comforted her and told her that

REPORT FINDS QUAKE DANGERS AT FIRE STATIONS 
</P>

More than one-third of Orange County's fire stations face the potential of 
total or partial collapse in a severe earthquake, a disaster that could destroy 
the capacity of many stations to function and endanger the lives of 
firefighters, according to a consultant's study. 
</P>
<P>
The survey has been under review this week by county officials. Some of its 
findings, according to a county spokeswoman, will be included in a written 
report detailing the status of Orange County earthquake preparedness, which is 
to be sent to the Board of Supervisors on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Fire Chief Lawrence J. Holms said he was aware a study was under 
way but did not know that it had been completed and was unaware of the 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we get the report, then we will evaluate the report and make 
recommendations to ensure that our critical facilities are capable of 
withstanding that type of emergency," Holms said. "We will do our best to make 
sure we meet the needs of the public." 
</P>
<P>
The survey, done by EQE Engineering in Costa Mesa, was presented to the 
county's General Services Agency two months ago. The report does not state in 
terms of magnitude how severe a quake would have to be to damage fire stations. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not aware of nor have I seen the study," Orange County Board Chairman 
Thomas F. Riley said. "This is very serious. Earthquakes are foremost in 
everyone's minds. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to comment. I think we've been asking people to report back to 
us. I don't know what I can add to this." 
</P>
<P>
The study of 42 fire stations in the county rated 15 as in "very high-risk" or 
"high-risk" categories. These stations would suffer severe damage in an 
earthquake, "possibly leading to partial or total collapse," according to the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
The fire stations in this group would be "very unlikely" to survive an 
earthquake well enough to provide assistance in county rescue efforts, the 
report says. Damage to the facilities would also present "possible life 
hazards" to any firefighters in the stations when a serious earthquake struck. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the most hazardous stations in this category were identified in another 
study made public last week. That study, ordered under state law, required the 
identification of those unreinforced masonry structures built before 1934. The 
study done in August reviewed all 42 of the county's fire stations, regardless 
of when they were built. 
</P>
<P>
Another 20 fire stations would be at "moderate risk" in a serious earthquake, 
according to the study, facing "substantial" damage that would hamper their 
rescue efforts by their crews. 
</P>
<P>
The most ominous warnings in the report did not focus on the structural hazards 
of county fire stations, but instead on damage from equipment and other loose 
objects that might topple in an earthquake. The review found Orange County fire 
stations "typically at high risk" in this area. 
</P>
<P>
"Non-structural damage can make it difficult or impossible to carry out the 
functions normally performed by a facility and/or cause serious casualties," 
the report states. "For critical facilities such as fire stations, loss of 
functionality may result in consequential loss of citizen lives." 
</P>
<P>
Among the nonstructural dangers cited: 
</P>
<P>
The garage doors on 16 fire stations were inadequately braced to withstand an 
earthquake, and might jam shut under severe shaking. 
</P>
<P>
Radio and dispatch equipment at "virtually all of the stations reviewed" was 
insufficiently anchored and "vulnerable to even a moderate earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
Compressed gas containers at 14 stations were not adequately secured to the 
walls to ensure that they would not become "dangerous missiles" driven by 
escaping gases, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
Martin W. Johnson, the EQE Engineering consultant who prepared the report, said 
his firm had conducted a similar survey of San Francisco fire stations about a 
year ago. San Francisco has moved aggressively to address the problems, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who submitted his report to Orange County on Aug. 11, said he has not 
kept track of the county's response. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't asked to recommend a timetable. . . ," Johnson said. He also noted 
that Orange County's problems could be worse. 
</P>
<P>
"The older (a city is) the more you find that it's vulnerable. In that regard, 
compared to an older city like San Francisco, Orange County is probably 
somewhat better off." 
</P>

DEAF MAN MIGHT BE RELEASED; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: A 38-YEAR-OLD WHO AFTER ALLEGED MISDIAGNOSIS SPENT MANY YEARS IN STATE 
HOSPITALS COULD BE ALLOWED TO LIVE WITH HIS PARENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For nearly 30 years, Alberto Valdez has wandered the bleak halls of state 
psychiatric institutions, a deaf man without language, victimized by 
misunderstanding and misdiagnosis, family and friends say. Finally, it appears 
he is headed for home. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys working on Valdez's behalf said Friday that they have designed a plan 
that would enable him to move into his parents' Santa Ana home and have what he 
has craved for decades: a relatively independent life far from the psychotic 
world in which he has been trapped. 
</P>
<P>
Many arrangements must still be worked out, and the plan must win the approval 
of a Superior Court judge before Valdez, 38, can be released from Metropolitan 
State Hospital in Norwalk. But Barbara G. McDonald, a Carlsbad attorney who has 
worked on Valdez's case for many years, said she is "very, very optimistic" 
that he will soon be released. 
</P>
<P>
"Our real goal for Alberto is for him to have the capacity to live 
independently," McDonald said. "He has the personal goal of someday holding a 
job and getting married and having his own family. That's always a possibility 
and something everyone hopes will occur." 
</P>
<P>
"It's about time," said Valdez's sister, Lupe Valdez, 38, who successfully sued 
the state in 1977, claiming her brother had been misdiagnosed and unnecessarily 
held in state institutions, where he could not get appropriate care. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great. He's so excited. He can't wait to get home. I just want him to 
have a little tranquility and peace, without having to see people go haywire 
around him all the time" in mental institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Experts have never decided whether Valdez was born deaf or whether he lost his 
hearing after suffering a high fever when he was 18 months old, but he never 
learned to speak. He uses a few basic hand signs, gestures and facial 
expressions to communicate. He has lived in mental institutions since he was 8 
years old: first at Fairview State Hospital, then Camarillo and Atascadero, the 
state hospital for the criminally insane. For the past 10 years, he has been at 
Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
His troubles began in 1958, when a low score on an IQ test prompted a diagnosis 
of mental retardation. Other tests since then have produced conflicting 
results: environmentally deprived, developmentally disabled and above-average 
intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
State officials considered him troublesome, pointing to a series of aggressive 
outbursts against other patients when he has been hospitalized and against 
friends and family on the few times he has been released to go home. But 
McDonald and others argue that the outbursts are not a sign of mental trouble, 
just the pent-up frustration of a sensitive man who never had enough exposure 
to sign language to learn to communicate. 
</P>
<P>
"Alberto has been stuck with whatever resources the state could provide, and 
that was these hospitals," McDonald said. "His family wasn't in the position to 
provide much more. I knew that until he got money, there was no chance for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
And he got the money. McDonald helped negotiate a May, 1988, settlement of Lupe 
Valdez's lawsuit that should cover Alberto Valdez's needs from the time he is 
released from state hospitals until his death, McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
The state admitted no wrongdoing in settling the suit, but it purchased an 
annuity that will pay $60,000 for each the first two years, $50,000 a year for 
the following three years, then $30,000 a year after that, McDonald said. The 
money will be handled by a court-appointed conservator. 
</P>
<P>
When the Times reported the settlement in 1988, attorneys said it would require 
approval by the state Legislature. But the funds were not allocated until this 
August. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Johns, Valdez's court-appointed guardian, said that the state has "bent 
over backwards" to find the right placement for Valdez but that his "unique" 
needs have proven difficult to serve. Johns has recently suggested that Valdez 
be transfered to Napa State Hospital, which has a program for the mentally ill 
deaf. But Valdez's family opposes it. Johns has not yet been briefed on the 
proposal for Valdez's home release, but he said he hopes it is "comprehensive." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to just give him up (to private conservators) without making 
sure it's the best situation for him," Johns said. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald and John P. Deily, an attorney who has been helping design a 
conservatorship to look afer Valdez once he is released, said the judge can 
approve the plan without the public guardian's consent. But they said they 
would prefer that all parties agree to the proposal. A hearing is set for Nov. 
8. 
</P>
<P>
"We all realize the trouble Alberto's had, and we want the best for him," Deily 
said. "The trouble is, there's no place for deaf people who are indigent. The 
only alternative is state institutions. It's clear to me he just wants to go 
home. He loves his family." 
</P>
<P>
Current plans call for Valdez to live with his parents, Margarita and Isabel 
Valdez, and to have a companion who can use sign language to help him develop 
his rudimentary communication skills and to convey his needs to the speaking 
world, McDonald said. He would have two conservators: one to pay all his bills 
from the annuity fund and another to take care of all the other details of his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
He would take classes in independent living -- learning such basics as how to 
get around on buses, keep a bank account, cook, clean and grocery shop -- from 
a private tutor or at a school that specializes in such training, she said. 
</P>
<P>
And hopefully, McDonald said, Valdez could hold a job. He has worked 
successfully as a busboy, gardener, painter and furniture mover in supervised 
work programs off the state hospital grounds, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very reliable and meticulous," he said. "He loves order and schedules. 
When we visit him and he knows he has to be at work soon, he starts fidgeting 
and pointing at his watch. He takes it very seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Valdez's parents do not know sign language, but Lupe Valdez said that she knows 
a little and that her brother, who lives nearby, is studying hard in 
preparation for Alberto's return. The homecoming will be joyful, she said, but 
tinged with culture shock as well. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom's a little worried," she said. "She cooks Mexican food and she wonders, 
will he like it? He's so used to that hospital food, for 30 years. That's a 
long time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Alberto Valdez, a deaf man who never learned to speak, has spent nearly 30 of 
his 38 years in mental institutions. His friends and family say he was 
misdiagnosed and should come home, and a legal settlement last year gave him 
the funds to do so. Now attorneys are trying to work it out. Next month, the 
decision will be left to a Superior Court judge.

MEASURE M'S WAR CHEST AT $1.8 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Major developers and others connected to the building industry in Orange County 
have contributed the lion's share of a $1.8-million war chest amassed by 
backers of Measure M, a proposed half-cent sales tax increase for 
transportation improvements, according to financial statements filed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But the hearty outpouring of developer dollars is also sure to provide fodder 
for the measure's opponents, who argue that builders want more roads laid down 
as groundwork for a continued housing boom in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the measure have collected only about $8,000 and have portrayed 
the contest as a David-versus-Goliath match-up. But supporters of Measure M 
insist that their decided money-raising edge -- and the fact those funds have 
come largely from the development and construction community -- will not prove 
a detriment when voters go to the polls Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
"People are going to make an individual choice based on the merits of Measure 
M," said Alan Hoffenblum, a Los Angeles-based political consultant hired to 
manage the pro-M campaign. "This is just money to help us communicate. . . . I 
think the lack of funding on the 'no' side shows a lack of support for their 
position." 
</P>
<P>
Citizens for Yes on M have raised $1.73 million in cash and nearly another 
$62,000 in non-monetary contributions through Oct. 21, while spending nearly 
$1.3 million, according to the campaign disclosure statement. Nearly $960,000 
of the cash and "in-kind" contributions were made during the last month alone. 
</P>
<P>
Contributions in excess of $20,000 came from more than two dozen major Orange 
County developers, financing institutions and consultants. The list is topped 
by Presley of Southern California, one of the county's biggest home builders. 
The Irvine-based firm donated $50,000 in the past month and more than $125,000 
overall to the pro-M campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign has received a total of $125,000 from the William Lyon Co., which 
donated $25,000 since the current reporting period began in the last week of 
September. Another $25,000 came in earlier this month from the influential 
Lincoln Club of Orange County, one of the major Republican organizations in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffenblum said the pro-M forces are "not on the defensive" over the source of 
their operating funds, but rather are spending "all our time communicating the 
merits" of the sales-tax measure. "What (opponents) should be talking about is 
Measure M, not who's contributing to the campaign," he added. 
</P>
<P>
So far, most of the proponents' money has been spent on producing and 
distributing direct-mail campaign literature and manning phone banks, according 
to the campaign statement. Hoffenblum said the tactics would stay the same for 
the measure's supporters through Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a massive telephone (bank) operation," Hoffenblum said. "We're 
asking people if they support Measure M and, if they do, we're urging them to 
get out and vote for it." 
</P>
<P>
Under the measure, the sales tax in the county would increase from 6% to 6.5% 
on the dollar, raising a projected $3.1 billion to help pay for a far-reaching, 
$11.6-billion program to speed traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Freeways would be widened, car-pool lanes added and city streets streamlined. 
In addition, exclusive bus lanes and commuter rail service would be added, 
promoters promise. The tax increase is estimated to cost the average county 
resident about $50 to $75 a year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, many of the same donors contributed to a big-bucks campaign in support 
of a 1-cent sales tax hike for traffic improvements. Though opinion polls 
indicated it might pass, the measure was defeated by nearly a 3-to-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the measure say this year will be different, in large part because 
the tax increase is only a half-cent and traffic is worse than in 1984. In an 
effort to attract broader support from historically tax-wary Orange County 
voters, the proponents have included provisions in Measure M for a citizens' 
committee to oversee spending of the money collected. 
</P>
<P>
The list of contributors on the campaign disclosure statement for the pro-M 
forces reads like a Who's Who of powerful local developers, influential 
consultants and well-established financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
A-M Homes of Newport Beach; Bramalea California Inc.; Coto De Caza Ltd.; 
Standard Pacific of Orange County; Taylor Woodrow Homes California, and 
developer Kathryn G. Thompson have contributed $40,000 each since the last week 
in September, the disclosure statements show. 
</P>
<P>
Ahmanson Developments Inc.; Baldwin Builders Inc.; Home Capital Corp. of San 
Diego; the Irvine Co.; J.M. Peters Co. Inc.; Rancho Santa Margarita Joint 
Venture, and Sammis Co. donated $25,000 each during the reporting period. 
</P>
<P>
Contributions of $20,000 each came from Lincoln Property Co.; BCE Development 
Inc.; Birtcher Real Estate Inc.; Costain Homes Inc.; Anaheim-based Kaufman 
&amp; Broad; O'Donnell, Armstrong &amp; Partners Inc. of Irvine; Richmond 
American of Irvine, and Costa Mesa-based Warmington Homes. 
</P>
<P>
BankAmerica Corp.; Brinderson Real Estate of Irvine; California Communities 
Inc. of Irvine; Diversified Shopping Centers of Costa Mesa; Hillman Properties 
West of Newport Beach; Hughes Aircraft Co.; the Leaverton Co. of Anaheim Hills; 
Pacific Mutual of Newport Beach; Recreations of California Inc.; Signal 
Landmark and Trammell Crow Associated, both of Irvine, have donated $10,000 
each during the past month, the disclosure statement showed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHAT MEASURE M WOULD PAY FOR 
</P>
<P>
Measure M, the proposed half-cent sales tax for transportation projects, would 
raise $3.1 billion over 20 years. Measure M designates which projects would be 
undertaken with passage, including: 
</P>
<P>
Ten-year-earlier completion of Santa Ana Freeway widening from the San Diego 
Freeway interchange in Irvine to the San Gabriel River Freeway in Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Rebuilding the interchange of the Santa Ana and San Diego freeways, known as 
the El Toro "Y." 
</P>
<P>
Adding lanes to Interstate 5 in South County, the Riverside Freeway throughout 
the Orange County, the Orange Freeway from Diamond Bar to the Santa Ana 
Freeway, and adding lanes to the Costa Mesa Freeway between the Riverside and 
Santa Ana freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Building a 220-mile network of "super streets," using Orange County's 21 
busiest streets. 
</P>
<P>
Expanding Los Angeles-to-San Diego rail service, planning commuter train 
service between Riverside and Irvine and studying additional train service 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Coordinating traffic signals throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
Requiring every city and the county to adopt comprehensive growth management 
plans to link traffic relief with future development. 
</P>
<P>
Creating a citizens' oversight committee to monitor agencies' compliance with 
the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the added freeway lanes would be reserved for buses and car pools. 
Freeway projects would total $1.325 billion; street and road improvements would 
be $650 million; transit projects -- including rail -- $775 million, and 
regional projects such as "super streets" and signal coordination would get 
$350 million. If Measure M passes with more than 50% of the vote, county 
officials intend to use bonds to finance an early start of many projects.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;

<P>
SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS TREAT FOR CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
More than 800 kindergarten pupils received a Halloween treat from the Tustin 
Unified School District to get them off to a safe start for Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
The pupils were given a black-and-orange brochure illustrated with spooks, 
haunted houses and children carving pumpkins with a message on how to "Trick or 
Treat -- Without Trouble," said Mark Eliot, spokesman for the district. 
</P>
<P>
"Halloween is a fun time, and they get real excited," Eliot said. He designed 
the brochure for the children because they are new to the district and the 
schools want to get them off to a good start. 
</P>
<P>
The pamphlet is printed in large type in a language young children can 
understand, Eliot said. "It is designed for children and their parents to read 
together and discuss." 
</P>
<P>
Without frightening the youngsters, the brochure tells them "not everybody 
gives treats. Some people play tricks, not fun tricks but nasty tricks that can 
hurt people. Be sure nobody plays a nasty trick on you." 
</P>
<P>
The pamphlet tells children they can avoid this by going with their parents to 
houses with lights on, trick or treating only in their own neighborhoods and 
letting their parents check their candy before eating it. 
</P>
<P>
To help children have a "frightfully good time," it also recommends trick or 
treaters wear face paints instead of face masks so they can see better, dress 
in light-colored clothing so they can be seen and wear loose clothing so they 
can move quickly and easily. G. JEANETTE AVENT

LAW WOULD PRESERVE MOBILE HOME PARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
To the relief of mobile home residents, planning officials have voted to create 
a new zoning ordinance that would restrict future development in Laguna Beach 
mobile home parks. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed ordinance, which must be approved by the City Council, 
existing mobile home parks would have to remain so and could not be developed 
for other purposes, such as hotels or private residences. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners also voted 3 to 2 to recommend a six-month freeze on mobile home 
rents to gain time to study other tenant issues. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a cleaner way to have a moratorium on rents now than perhaps to have 
owners later return money," said Commissioner Becky Jones, who voted for the 
rent freeze. "And, if we leave it uncovered, low- and moderate-income people 
could be priced out." Mobile home park residents have complained that they are 
being forced out of their homes by steep rent increases and say that this could 
pave the way for other development, such as estate homes and condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have said they are sympathetic to the tenants, many of whom are 
senior citizens on fixed incomes. 
</P>
<P>
The council last year placed a moratorium on building applications in mobile 
home parks. Because that freeze expires in December, commissioners will 
recommend that the City Council extend it by one year. "We're really supportive 
of what the city is doing," said Michael Kenney, president of Treasure Island 
Resident's Assn. in South Laguna, the most vocal opponent of developments in 
mobile home parks. But "it's not enough because there are still other issues to 
address." 
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, mobile home residents should be protected by permanent 
rent control, relocation compensation guidelines and should have first option 
to buy if owners decide to sell the park. 
</P>
<P>
But Commissioner Wayne L. Peterson said this week that there is no guarantee 
that rent control will ever be incorporated into an ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The mobile home ordinance is one of a dozen zoning changes that the city has 
been considering since annexation of South Laguna at the end of 1987. By law, 
those changes must be in place by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson voted against the rent moratorium at Wednesday night's meeting, saying 
he had "difficulty with doing it for those who don't even live (at Treasure 
Island) and use it only as a second home." 
</P>
<P>
The 27-acre Treasure Island parcel overlooking the ocean in South Laguna was 
purchased in August by a partnership including Costa Mesa-based Richard A. Hall 
Co. and MLH Income Realty of New York for $43 million, a figure that residents 
say they had offered the previous owner, who rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
The new owners, Treasure Island Associates, have proposed a 10-year lease to go 
into effect Jan 1. LESLIE HERZOG

LATINAS TO ATTEND LEADERSHIP SESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Mexican-American Women's National Assn. will hold its second annual 
conference this weekend to help develop the leadership skills of Latinas in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The conference will be the first in the county to feature workshops and 
seminars aimed at both English- and Spanish-speaking women, spokeswoman Lisa 
Penaloza said. 
</P>
<P>
Penaloza said the conference will focus on education, non-traditional business 
careers, self-esteem and leadership roles in the community. Scheduled speakers 
include County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez and Mission Viejo City Councilwoman 
Victoria C. Jaffe. 
</P>
<P>
"The conference provides an opportunity for women to develop their leadership 
capabilities in an environment that is culturally supportive to their needs," 
Penaloza said. 
</P>
<P>
The association is a nonprofit organization committed to the social, economic 
and educational advancement of Latinas. The county chapter was formed in 1982 
to focus primarily on leadership development, Penaloza said, adding that 
economic opportunities for Latinos "are essential to the economic and social 
vitality of the Orange County community." 
</P>
<P>
The conference will be held from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. today at the Southwest Senior 
Center, 2201 W. McFadden St. Registration is $35 for adults, $20 for students.

MAN SHOOTS WOMAN, TURNS GUN ON SELF

<TEXT>
<P>
When Larry Burgoon sat down at Mary Louise Cutbirth's table in the cocktail 
lounge of a popular Anaheim Hills restaurant, he was surely the last man she 
wanted to see. 
</P>
<P>
In court documents, Cutbirth had complained that the burly construction worker 
-- her former live-in boyfriend -- had threatened to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
Burgoon apparently tailed her to the bar Thursday night and sat down at the 
table as Cutbirth, 51, nursed a nightcap with a girlfriend, according to 
Anaheim police and witnesses. After a few tense minutes, Burgoon allegedly drew 
a pistol and fired a bullet into her face. Then he turned the gun on himself, 
cranking off two shots before crumpling to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Cutbirth was rushed to United Western Medical Center-Santa Ana while Burgoon 
was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange. Both were reported in critical 
condition Friday. 
</P>
<P>
What police are calling an attempted murder-suicide brought Cutbirth's worst 
fears to life, the kind of incident she had tried to head off by seeking a 
court order to get Burgoon out of her life. Just last week, an Orange County 
Superior Court judge granted her request for an order to require that the 
former boyfriend stay at least 100 yards away from her house or workplace. 
</P>
<P>
Cutbirth, who is 19 years older than Burgoon, complained in court papers that 
on Sept. 29 he "kicked the coffee table and said he would make sure something 
would happen to me and my family." 
</P>
<P>
Four days later, Burgoon pulled up in his car as she was leaving the Fullerton 
home they once shared. She quoted him as telling her: "You are dead." 
</P>
<P>
She also wrote to the judge, in applying for the restraining order, that 
Burgoon had received treatment for drug addiction and suffered from mental 
illness. On one occasion, she added, he stole her car. 
</P>
<P>
None of these troubles were apparent to neighbors. One woman who lives near 
Cutbirth's well-maintained tract house on North Cornell Avenue said that the 
two appeared to live quiet, happy lives during the approximately two years they 
lived together. 
</P>
<P>
Although she said the pair faced difficult times recently, she described 
Burgoon as "very friendly" and added that Cutbirth too was nice, though she 
"tended to keep to herself." 
</P>
<P>
After winning the court order against Burgoon, Cutbirth went about trying to 
live a normal life. On Thursday evening, she went out on the town with a 
girlfriend and ended up about 10 p.m. at the Foxfire restaurant, a popular 
hangout for middle-aged Anaheim locals -- including many off-duty police 
officers -- at Santa Ana Canyon Road and Imperial Highway at the base of the 
hills. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere was festive, with a band performing and couples swaying on the 
dance floor. Cutbirth and her girlfriend sat by themselves at a table near the 
band. Before they could finish the first round, in walked Burgoon, restaurant 
owner Lynn Mahoney said. 
</P>
<P>
Cutbirth's friend sensed trouble, Mahoney said. Apparently seeing the pistol in 
Burgoon's clothing, she discreetly asked the cocktail waitress to get help. But 
before the waitress could reach the manager, the man allegedly pulled the 
handgun and shot Cutbirth, witnesses and police said. 
</P>
<P>
Mahoney said a band member saw Burgoon shoot himself in the head, only to get 
up and fire another shot into himself. A woman who had been sitting at another 
table said the shots from the small-caliber handgun sounded like a cap pistol.

FOR IMMIGRANTS, ACCENT ON SPEECH; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: FULLERTON CLASS TEACHES ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION TO THOSE WHO WISH TO 
SPEAK CLEARLY FOR PROFESSIONAL OR PERSONAL REASONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

FULLERTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sitting around a library table, 10 adults from three continents listened 
attentively as Susanne Flatley emphasized the importance of the jaw in proper 
pronunciation. 
</P>
<P>
"In English, we encourage you to really move your jaw," Flatley said. "You have 
to do that to speak clearly." 
</P>
<P>
That tip and others offered in a Fullerton class on how to speak without an 
accent were closely followed at a recent session by a group of immigrants 
seeking to improve their pronunciation for professional and, in some cases, 
distinctly personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of those pursuing a course of study gaining popularity in 
immigrant-rich Orange County were Josef Mair, who speaks with a thick Austrian 
accent, and Dora Harrigan, his wife, whose English is flavored with the Spanish 
of her native Peru. 
</P>
<P>
Mair said it was his stepson, Bernard, 14, who provided the motivation. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's contrasting accents are so startling that Mair, who recently 
married the boy's mother, said his stepson is frequently embarrassed when his 
parents open their mouths. 
</P>
<P>
"I notice when we go to a baseball game that he doesn't want me to speak to 
people," said Mair, 49, a salesman. 
</P>
<P>
The Placentia resident lived with that frustration until his wife spotted a 
notice about the class, which began Oct. 3 at the Hunt Branch Library in 
Fullerton. It is sponsored by the city of Fullerton Community Services 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Students paid $44 each to enroll in the four-week class, which has also been 
offered in Anaheim and soon will begin in La Palma. Other students in Flatley's 
class hail from Japan, the Philippines, Mexico and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
All have jobs dealing with the public, and are frustrated at the repeated 
explanations they must give to people who do not understand their thickly 
accented English. 
</P>
<P>
"The goal in this class is not to become a native American speaker," Flatley 
said. "The goal is to become more intelligible." 
</P>
<P>
Accent reduction classes are relatively novel in Orange County, despite the 
area's huge influx of immigrants from all over the world in recent years. While 
some native-born Americans find some foreign accents amusing, the immigrants do 
not, Flatley said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really not a laughing matter," Flatley said. "Many of these people deal 
with the public and it's very frustrating because they have to repeat what they 
say." 
</P>
<P>
Harrigan, for example, said that her Spanish-accented English hampers her 
ability to communicate with the public in her position as a caseworker for the 
California Department of Economic Development. Dealing with a mixture of 
Spanish-speaking and English-speaking clients, Harrigan said she sometimes has 
difficulty making herself understood in English. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to improve so it will be easier for me to do the job I do," said 
Harrigan, who immigrated to the United States 15 years ago from Lima, Peru. "I 
also feel like I can have a better chance to go to college." 
</P>
<P>
Speech patterns are formed in childhood from one's native language. An accent 
results when the person learns a new language requiring the production of 
sounds different from the native language. Spanish-speaking people, for 
example, have trouble with English words containing the sound of "th," because 
there is no "th" sound in Spanish, Flatley said. 
</P>
<P>
Flatley began teaching accent reduction classes two years ago, using tapes and 
sound exercises to try to replace existing speech habits that cause an accent 
with new habit patterns that reduce the accent. 
</P>
<P>
To help accomplish this objective, students follow the format of "Pronouncing 
English as a Second Language," a San Francisco-originated private course which 
is offered in most major cities throughout the United States. The program 
covers three phases: learning to hear and produce the troublesome English 
sounds, practicing the difficult rhythms and phrasing of English and practicing 
the new speech patterns in casual conversation. 
</P>
<P>
The class being taught every Tuesday night in Fullerton is only an 
introduction. During the first class, students recited such troublesome phrases 
for foreigners as, "Of course," "I was afraid this would happen" and "She hates 
being late for class." 
</P>
<P>
Flatley mixes the recitations with more tips for proper pronunciation. The 
position of the tongue is important. While speaking many foreign languages 
requires use of the back of the tongue, American English uses the tip of the 
tongue, Flatley said. 
</P>
<P>
Flatley's partner, Jocelyn Piper, using chalk and a blackboard, explained that 
English is a particularly difficult language to pronounce because it has about 
50 sounds but only 26 letters to carry those sounds. The five vowels used in 
English can be pronounced several ways, depending on the word, Flatley said. 
</P>
<P>
Flatley demonstrated the difficulty in vowel pronunciations by asking her 
students which one of the vowels in the word "diploma" had the "uh" sound. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the 'o,' " Mair answered incorrectly. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was the 'o,' it would be 'dipluhma,' " Flatley said. 
</P>
<P>
Breaking into small groups, the students recited phrases together and 
individually, as the teachers listened and corrected. The phrases included such 
tongue-twisters as "Ask any bashful man if he can dance," and "A great sound 
came from the right side of the door." 
</P>
<P>
Then they practiced difficult words. John Liu, a chemist who immigrated here 
from Taiwan, stumbled over the simple word "toe," pronouncing it "to-eh." He 
pronounced it correctly, though, after repeating it. 
</P>
<P>
And Mair's big nemesis was the word "pail." He pronounced it "payul," but got 
it right after several more attempts. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the session, Flatley tried to console wounded egos. 
</P>
<P>
"English is so difficult," she said, "even for those of us who grew up speaking 
it."

<P>
Alma Pixley Dean, believed to be the oldest native of Orange County, died 
Tuesday morning in an El Toro board-and-care home. She was 101. 
</P>
<P>
Because she was the oldest known county resident living at the time, her 
signature was placed on the new cornerstone of the renovated old Orange County 
Courthouse last November. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Dean was born in Orange on July 6, 1888, when the unincorporated town was 
still part of Los Angeles County, city historian Phil Brigandi said. 
</P>
<P>
"Her father, D.C. Pixley, was probably the most prominent businessman and 
banker in Orange at the turn of the century," Brigandi said. Dewitt Clinton 
Pixley ran a general store and helped found the first bank, the First Christian 
Church of Orange and the defunct Orange News, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pixley Street in Orange is named after the family. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Dean was one of the original students when Orange Union High School opened 
its doors in 1903 in a store in downtown Orange, Brigandi said. She went on to 
graduate from Stanford University, an unusual accomplishment for a woman at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother was always interested in education," said her daughter, Virginia 
Arthur, 69, a resident of Dana Point. "It was important to have her two girls 
and her grandchildren go to college." 
</P>
<P>
Her mother kept active until the end of her life, Arthur said. At age 101, she 
attended a reunion in June of five generations of the Pixley family. They 
gathered at the Big Bear cabin D.C. Pixley had built in 1914. 
</P>
<P>
"The family reunion was a great tribute to my parents," Arthur said. Her mother 
"had a great feeling of family continuity." 
</P>
<P>
"My mother was proud of her family heritage," Arthur said. "Her parents were 
prominent, but she never considered that a big deal. She had a lot of family 
pride and she imparted that to all of us, the cohesiveness and the loyalty." 
</P>
<P>
Her mother could recite every family member's birthday, Arthur said. "This was 
children, great grandchildren and all their spouses," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The day after the reunion, Mrs. Dean's husband, Argus, died from heart problems 
at age 98. They were married in 1917 in Illinois, where the two met. 
</P>
<P>
"Once Argus passed away, Alma just faded away after that," said Brigandi, who 
knew Mrs. Dean for several years because of their mutual interest in city 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Dean was the last of her generation of the Pixley family, he said. Her two 
brothers and two sisters, several of whom lived in Orange, have all died, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The three-story family house where the Pixley children grew up is still 
standing on the corner of Palm and Olive streets in Orange, Brigandi said. Her 
father's general store remains standing, also, but the facade has been altered, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
D.C. Pixley was a member of the Orange County Board of Supervisors for one term 
in 1900. During his term, the old Orange County Courthouse was built and 
Pixley's signature was in the cornerstone that was removed last November. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Dean died of natural causes at the Regency Hearthside Home. A memorial 
service will be held for her at 2 p.m. Nov. 5 at Shannon-Donegan Mortuary in 
Orange.

SPECIAL-EFFECTS MAN R.H. PATTERSON DIES AT 74 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Services will be conducted today for veteran movie special-effects man R.H. 
(Pat) Patterson, who suffered a massive stroke and died just hours before he 
was expected to leave for Las Vegas to begin work on the film "Back to the 
Future III." 
</P>
<P>
Patterson died at his Costa Mesa home Tuesday afternoon, his daughter Barbra 
Patterson said Friday. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson was probably best known for helping to stage the jarring and 
memorable final scene in the movie "Bonnie and Clyde," in which the two 
characters are killed in a gunfire barrage. He also worked on numerous other 
hits, including "The Blues Brothers" and "Escape From New York," his daughter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Other films he worked on include "Oklahoma Crude" and "Carousel," as well as 
the television shows "Gunsmoke" and "Death Valley Days." Barbra Patterson said 
her father especially enjoyed working on movies starring John Wayne. "They were 
very close friends," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson was born in Brazil, Ind., in 1915 and moved to Idaho in 1932, where 
he was a disc jockey for a few years before coming to California with his wife. 
He began his career in the movie industry as a studio carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson is survived by his wife, Irene Marie, a son, four daughters, 12 
grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Services will be held at 2 p.m. today at Pierce Brothers Bell Broadway mortuary 
in Costa Mesa.

SOUPED-UP SEWAGE PLANT WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY IN LAGUNA BEACH;

<P>
PRESERVATION: THE CITY'S OLD WASTE TREATMENT FACILITY WITH 'MEDITERRANEAN

An old silo-shaped building, wrapped by a winding staircase, nestles against a 
hillside on Laguna Canyon Road, its former purpose nowhere in evidence. 
</P>
<P>
But the old cylinder at Forest Avenue in Laguna Beach once had a most definite 
purpose, which its design was meant to hide. The 54-year-old building was the 
city's sewage treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
"It was built to look like anything but what it is," said Jack Cressman, an 
architect in Laguna Beach. "They tried to make it look like a little Normandy 
castle with a Mediterranean influence. There was a lot of revivalism going on 
at that time." 
</P>
<P>
Because of its design and architecture, the plant recently was listed on the 
city's new Historic Register, perhaps the only sewage treatment facility to 
have that honor, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
SH Part to Be Demolished for Parking 
</P>
<P>
The listing means that the cylinder and adjacent office will be preserved. The 
rest of the plant, however, will be demolished to create more parking for city 
employees and tourists. 
</P>
<P>
In 1932, the council hired Frank Currie of Currie Engineering Co. to design the 
plant. According to a 1935 article written by Currie, the city applied for 
Works Progress Administration money after an attempt to sell bonds for the new 
plant failed. 
</P>
<P>
Funds received totaled $161,500 -- about the same as the cost today of 
demolishing part of it. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Canyon site was chosen because it was zoned non-residential. It was, 
however, within a block of the Woman's Club and two blocks from City Hall and 
the fire station. Therefore, the council wanted to use every known method of 
odor control and state-of-the-art sewage treatment, the article said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, technology at the old plant is not much different from that used 
in modern facilities. 
</P>
<P>
After several treatments, effluent was discharged through a cast iron pipe to a 
point 300 feet offshore. Sludge was dumped into the ocean every six months via 
that same pipe but "out of bathing season" and while the tide was going out. 
</P>
<P>
For odor control, sewage was prechlorinated at a manhole about 50 feet from the 
plant. A ventilation system changed the air in the plant every 10 minutes, and 
exhaust air passed into a flue which extended up the hill into a 
lighthouse-shaped chimney 200 feet above the plant. 
</P>
<P>
The plant served the city until 1983, when a new one was built in Aliso Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, 2.1 million gallons are processed each day," said Terry Brandt, director 
of Laguna Beach municipal services. "The treatment plant itself is not 
overburdened, but the city is budgeting funds for repairs on certain problem 
areas. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council this month gave final approval to a $700,000 upgrade of the 
city's sewer system, a response to a rash of raw sewage spills. Since July, 
1987, more than a dozen spills have contaminated beaches. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incentives Offered for Preservation 
</P>
<P>
The old cylindrical sewage plant joins 771 other structures on the city's list 
of historic places, a compilation begun in 1980. The Historic Preservation 
Ordinance, enacted this month, gives owners of those historic buildings 
incentives for preserving their places. For example, it gives latitude in 
zoning for additions to those properties to discourage owners from demolishing 
the old structures. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the charm of Laguna Beach is our older cottages," said associate 
planner Tamara Campbell. "Land prices are astronomical and people were buying 
the cottages and tearing them down. We had to find a way to help people keep 
them by adding on and increasing living area to accommodate modern needs. Now, 
if the old places are torn down, buildings are limited to new, strict building 
code requirements."

JAPANESE INVESTORS HEAD FOR SAN DIEGO; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: THEY HAVE POURED $700 MILLION INTO THE AREA IN THE LAST THREE 
YEARS, MUCH OF IT TO FINANCE MAJOR PROJECTS AND BUY PRIME PROPERTY. 
</P>

"Sold to the Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
These days, that same sign could be hung on some of San Diego County's 
best-known real estate properties, including the La Costa Resort Hotel and Spa 
in Carlsbad, the El Cortez Hotel downtown and Coronado's posh Hotel Meridien. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego transactions exemplify the growing attraction that Japanese 
investors have for American real estate, which they perceive as safe and 
lucrative long-term investment vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
At the current rate, Japanese investment in U.S. properties should exceed a 
cumulative total of $69 billion next year, up from just $985 million in 1980, 
according to a study released Friday by Price Waterhouse, an accounting and 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Surplus dollars generated by a $52-billion annual trade imbalance that tilts in 
Japan's favor and a weak dollar have allowed the Japanese to invest billions 
into cities such as New York, San Francisco, Honolulu and Los Angeles. But as 
more and more properties are bought up, those shopping sites won't be able to 
accommodate the growing numbers of Japanese "players" much longer, analysts 
say. As a result, these major investors are now turning to "second-tier 
markets" such as San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego, where the Japanese have invested $700 million in the last three 
years, is now the Japanese' sixth most-favored market in dollars invested, the 
study says. San Diego is preceded on the top 10 list by New York, San 
Francisco, Honolulu, Los Angeles and Washington and followed by Atlanta, 
Chicago, Dallas and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"They're coming down here primarily because of our proximity to a proven market 
like Los Angeles, where they've had considerable success," said Patricia A. 
McBride, manager of the West region real estate group at Price Waterhouse. 
"They view us as a similar market, one that could provide them with a highly 
valuable commodity -- coastal properties." 
</P>
<P>
Although Japanese attention has been focused on San Diego for only a short 
time, Japan's investment power is clearly becoming more evident in the county. 
Japanese-owned or majority-owned buildings now dot the county's landscape, 
particularly downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the landmark El Cortez, the Japanese are owners or major investors 
in the $75-million, 20-story Cabot, Cabot &amp; Forbes Corporate Center; the 
$130-million, 30-story Emerald-Shapery Center, a hotel-office complex, and the 
$171-million, 33-story, mixed-use Great American Plaza tower, all of which are 
under construction. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese also own the 24-story Great American building and the 12-story 
West Ash Plaza office building, both downtown. 
</P>
<P>
As the Japanese continue to gain familiarity with and knowledge about the U.S. 
real estate market, San Diego County will be the scene of even greater 
investment activity, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
"I would characterize San Diego as a second-tier market, only because of its 
size," said Alan Greinetz, managing director of Blackman Flynn &amp; Co., a San 
Francisco-based real estate merchant banking firm with experience with Japanese 
investors. "San Diego is simply a smaller city than say Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"But, if you look at San Diego in terms of population and economic growth and 
how there is an increasing demand for residential and commercial property 
there, San Diego has to be considered a first-tier market," Greinetz said. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese investors have also been attracted to San Diego's West Coast location 
as a gateway to Pacific Rim nations, said Brian Galligan, real estate 
development manager for Shimizu America and Shimizu Land. These corporations 
are the U.S. construction and development subsidiaries of Shimizu Corp., 
Japan's largest general contracting firm, which posted revenues of more than 
$10 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
Shimizu has been involved in many U.S. commercial projects and is one of three 
major Japanese financial backers of the $150-million Aventine office project 
under construction in La Jolla, which includes a Hyatt Regency Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"And now with the emerging maquiladora industry in Mexico I would anticipate 
even more Japanese companies doing business in San Diego," Galligan said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a Japanese shopping frenzy of sorts was witnessed in San Diego's 
downtown core earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 12, the Minami Group, a Tokyo-based conglomerate and hotelier, 
purchased three downtown blocks, including the historic El Cortez Hotel, and 
teamed with local developer Grosvenor Industries to propose a $250-million 
residential and commercial project on the site. The Minami Group is financing 
75% of the venture that will showcase a refurbished El Cortez Hotel plus four 
mixed-use towers. 
</P>
<P>
Then, seven days later, on Oct. 19, Shinryo California, the U.S. real estate 
investment branch of a Japanese mechanical engineering company, bought a 
vacant, 55,000-square-foot downtown parcel for $8.25 million and announced 
plans to construct an office high-rise. 
</P>
<P>
As typified by the Shinryo transaction, many Japanese buyers prefer building or 
buying office projects, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Japanese first started investing in the United States, they were 
really only interested in attractive, Class-A office buildings with 
high-quality tenants in premier locations," said McBride of Price Waterhouse. 
The Japanese, she added, view such high-profile downtown office buildings that 
typically have high demand and low vacancy rates as "good collectibles because 
they pose little risk and are considered prestigious." 
</P>
<P>
Prominent hotel resorts have also been favored by the Japanese, who say these 
projects have the same attractive investments qualities as office buildings. 
According to the Price Waterhouse study, transactions involving office building 
and hotel-resort properties accounted for more than 70% of Japanese investment 
activity in the United States last year. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the $250-million acquisition of internationally known La Costa Resort 
Hotel and Spa in Carlsbad by Osaka-based Sports Shinko in 1987 is seen as the 
transaction that awakened Japanese investors to the potential of San Diego real 
estate, McBride said. 
</P>
<P>
But, with only a limited supply of major properties, the Japanese are being 
forced to look for other investment opportunities. Increasingly, the buyers are 
investing in mixed-use, residential, and industrial properties -- all of which 
can be found in ample supply in San Diego County. "The smaller Japanese players 
. . . are increasingly looking at residential property, or offices or 
industrial projects in suburban areas," Greinetz said. 
</P>
<P>
Already, Japanese investors' efforts to diversify their investments is becoming 
apparent. According to Price Waterhouse research, nearly 41% of total Japanese 
investment in San Diego has been put into hotels and resorts ($283 million), 
followed by: 32% in mixed-use ventures ($223 million); 14% in office properties 
($101 million); 10% in residential projects ($67 million); 3% in industrial 
($20 million); and less than 1% in other projects ($5 million). 
</P>
<P>
Tokyu Corp. of Japan, the Tokyo-based conglomerate that is developing the $130 
million Emerald-Shapery Center downtown in a joint venture with local developer 
Shapery Enterprises, said it has no immediate plans to expand into residential 
or commercial projects. 
</P>
<P>
But Tetsuya Sonobe, chief financial officer of Tokyu's U.S. subsidiary, San 
Diego 109 Inc., says such investment possibilities have not been ruled out and 
adds that other Japanese firms are showing interest in a variety of real estate 
properties, particularly residential high-rises.

<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market capped off a weeklong run of losses with another broad decline 
Friday amid worries over the economy and weakness in corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials fell 17.01 to 2,596.72, extending its 
loss for the week to 92.42 points. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 5 to 2 in nationwide trading 
of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume was 170.33 million shares, against 175.24 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said a series of unpleasant surprises in companies' earnings reports 
for the third quarter raised concerns that have continued to weigh down the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
When stocks have been under pressure lately, brokers added, they haven't 
attracted much support from "bargain hunting" investors. 
</P>
<P>
The market's extreme volatility of late is presumed to have frightened off a 
good many participants who might otherwise be buying stocks at marked-down 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, many Federal Reserve-watchers remain uncertain over whether and 
when the Fed might take any further steps to relax its credit policy. 
</P>
<P>
Losers among the blue chips included Procter &amp; Gamble, down 1 3/8 at 125 
5/8; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down 1/2 at 43 1/8; Du Pont, down 1 
5/8 at 114 7/8; General Electric, down 3/4 at 53 5/8, and International 
Business Machines, down 7/8 at 99 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
Auto issues were weak for the second straight session after the Big Three 
domestic manufacturers all reported declines in third-quarter operating 
earnings. Chrysler lost 1/2 to 21 3/4; General Motors 3/8 to 44, and Ford Motor 
3/8 to 47 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
Precious-metals issues, by contrast, bolstered by rising gold prices in world 
markets and increased talk about the possibility of a recession. 
</P>
<P>
ASA Ltd. climbed 3 5/8 to 49 5/8; Homestake Mining 1 1/8 to 16 7/8; Amax Gold 
3/4 to 15; Battle Mountain Gold 3/4 to 16 3/4, and American Barrick Resources 1 
3/8 to 27 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Unisys dropped 3/4 to 16 1/4. The company reported a $648.20 million loss for 
the third quarter, including the effects of restructuring costs and other 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Crossland Savings fell 1 7/8 to 5 1/4. The company reported a $175.54 million 
quarterly loss and said it sought help from investment bankers for a capital 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
Shares closed lower in Tokyo in very heavy turnover after profit taking in 
large-capital domestic shares. The 225-share Nikkei index sank 151.20 points to 
35,527.29, cutting Thursday's 236.09-point gain. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices also closed sharply lower in active trading in London, depressed 
by Chancellor Nigel Lawson's resignation and a rapid selloff on Wall Street. 
The Financial Times 100-share index shed 47.3 points, or 2.2%, to close at 
2,082.1. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices sagged under the weight of a heavy supply of recently auctioned 
issues and a falling dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 19/32 point, or $5.94 per $1,000 in 
face value. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, climbed to 7.93% from 
7.88% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices slumped early in the session as the dollar fell in foreign-exchange 
trading. The decline deepened in the afternoon, attributed by analysts to 
recent borrowing by the Treasury and the agency set up to help salvage 
insolvent thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
David Hale, chief economist for Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, said 
securities dealers who bought the $4.5 billion in 30-year bonds auctioned this 
week by the thrift bailout agency Resolution Funding Corp. have been unable to 
find retail buyers for the securities. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of that Resolution finance paper is still on dealer's desks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hale said the bond market is also disappointed that the Federal Reserve has not 
yet given signs that it is ready to begin to relax credit conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"The market wants a clearer vision of the economy and where the Fed is going 
and neither are probably forthcoming in the near term," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said a government report showing weak gains in consumer spending and 
personal income was in line with expectations and had little effect on the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term 
government issues dropped 3-16 point, intermediate maturities were down by 
between 7-32 point and 3/8 point and long-term issues fell as much as 5/8 
point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted late in the day at 8.688%, down from 8.75% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar weakened substantially against all major currencies except the 
British pound, undermined by another poor session in the U.S. stock market and 
expectations of lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling stayed stuck in the slump it lapsed into when the British government's 
top finance official abruptly quit on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended near its lowest levels of the day. Currency dealers said 
selling motivated by internal market factors accentuated the weakness. 
</P>
<P>
But much of the impetus to unload dollars came from the stock market's retreat. 
</P>
<P>
The British pound, jarred by the resignation of Chancellor of the Exchequer 
Nigel Lawson on Thursday, finished the London trading day at $1.5750, 
substantially lower than $1.6130 the day before. 
</P>
<P>
But sterling managed to rebound slightly from its worst levels with a little 
help from the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve. Both central banks 
reportedly bought pounds and sold dollars to stall the pound's slide. The 
London closing price was up from a session low of $1.5620. 
</P>
<P>
The pound also dropped to 2.8820 West German marks, compared to 2.9650 marks 
late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in New York, sterling fetched $1.5795, up slightly from $1.5780 on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.85 Japanese yen to a closing 142.75 yen. But in 
London, it fell back to a late rate of 141.90 yen. The dollar ended New York 
trading at 141.75 yen, down from 142.125 late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures prices surged to their highest levels in 3 1/2 months on New 
York's Commodity Exchange as investors unnerved by the stock market's gyrations 
opted for the perceived safety of precious metals. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is getting back into the viewpoint that gold is a store of value, 
that it retains purchasing power," said Bette Raptopoulos, a metals analyst 
with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Silver and platinum futures also rose sharply. 
</P>
<P>
On other futures markets, copper advanced, oil prices rose, livestock and meat 
were mostly lower and grains and soybeans were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures settled $5.80 to $7 higher, with the contract for spot delivery at 
$378.30 an ounce, the highest spot price on the Commodity Exchange since July 
12. The most active gold contract, for December delivery, settled at $381.20, 
braking the $380 barrier for the first time since Aug. 3.

COUNTY JOBLESS RATE RISES TO 3.2% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pushed by seasonal job declines in the tourism, retail and construction 
industries, Orange County's unemployment rate bumped up to 3.2% in September 
from 2.9% in August, the state Employment Development Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the slight increase for the month, the county rate remains well under 
the 4% mark that economists use to define full employment. 
</P>
<P>
The EDD said the total estimated number of jobs in Orange County in September 
hit 1,163,200, up 2.2% from 1,137,700 a year ago for an annual gain of 25,500 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated number of unemployed Orange County residents rose in September to 
44,500 from 39,800 in August. 
</P>
<P>
Major job increases were reported in the public utilities industry with the end 
of the telephone employees' strike and in the government sector as thousands of 
teachers and other school employees returned to the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
The county's September unemployment rate was the third lowest jobless rate in 
the state, trailing -- as usual -- only Marin and San Mateo counties. Both are 
relatively high-income suburban areas of Northern California. Marin County 
posted a 2.5% jobless rate in September while the rate in San Mateo County was 
2.7%.

BRIEFCASE: TECHNICLONE GETS PATENT FOR TUMOR TREATMENT METHOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Leslie Berkman Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Techniclone International Corp., a Tustin bioengineering firm, said it has 
received a patent on a method that has potential for detecting and destroying 
cancerous tumors in humans. 
</P>
<P>
Called tumor necrosis technology (TNT), the procedure allows monoclonal 
antibodies to penetrate to the interior of harmful tumors and destroy them. 
Monoclonal antibodies are genetically engineered and can be grown in large 
commercial volumes. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the major obstacles to treating solid tumors has been an inability to 
penetrate the interior of a tumor," said Lon H. Stone, Techniclone's chairman 
and chief executive officer. "We have developed a technology that enables us to 
take the monoclonal antibodies that we manufacture and introduce them into 
patients as a diagnostic or therapeutic device." 
</P>
<P>
Stone said the TNT antibodies were designed by scientists at the University of 
Southern California to attach to dead cells within tumors. They carry a 
radioactive atom that kills the surrounding malignant cells that are living and 
multiplying. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other antibodies that attach only to a limited number of cancerous 
tumors, the TNT antibodies will link to all kinds of tumors, Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
Tests of the new procedure on animals have been completed at the University of 
Southern California Norris Cancer Center, Stone said. The company received 
clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July to begin tests on 
humans. 
</P>
<P>
Stone said because the TNT research initially was funded by Techniclone, the 
company owns the patent on the technology. He said Lederle Laboratories, a 
division of American Cyanamid, has agreed to finance completion of the tests 
required for FDA marketing approval. Stone said upon successful completion of 
the tests, which he estimated could take three to four years, Techniclone would 
manufacture the TNT monoclonal antibodies, which would be marketed by Lederle.

Alpha Microsystems, a Santa Ana computer company, said Friday that it has 
agreed to buy Fujitsu America's microcomputer business in the United States for 
$2.5 million and other considerations. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Alpha Micro will buy Fujitsu Microsystems of America, a 
San Jose-based unit of the Japanese parent. 
</P>
<P>
"The synergy that can be developed through a marriage of these two companies 
will enhance our company's presence in the marketplace," Alpha Micro Chairman 
Robert B. Hitchcock said. 
</P>
<P>
Hitchcock said Alpha Micro is familiar with Fujitsu as both a competitor and 
supplier. Alpha Micro purchases hard disk drives from Fujitsu for use in the 
business computers it markets. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been impressed with (Fujitsu's) customers, commitment and business 
philosophy, so when we were offered the opportunity to expand our relationship, 
we were delighted," Hitchcock said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Alpha Micro will acquire the marketing operations of 
Fujitsu Microsystems and purchase Fujitsu microcomputers for an unspecified 
time. Final terms of the purchasing deal have not yet been worked out, 
according to Nyoka Criner, Alpha Micro's vice president of finance. 
</P>
<P>
The two companies said the deal is subject to completing a definitive 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
If the deal is completed, Alpha Micro will take over Fujitsu's San Jose 
operation, which employs 50 people. 
</P>
<P>
Fujitsu America President Yasushi Nakamura said Alpha Micro's management 
philosophy "is compatible with ours, which gives us the utmost confidence that 
the business is in good hands."

BOARD OUSTED AT NEWPORT ELECTRONICS

In a surprise move, the new major shareholder of Newport Electronics has ousted 
the precision-measuring instrument maker's entire board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Milton B. Hollander, a disgruntled Newport Electronics investor who last month 
gained control of 49% of the company's stock, earlier had said he would replace 
only three of Newport's five directors once he took control. 
</P>
<P>
He apparently had intended to leave Chief Executive Barrett B. Weekes and 
former vice president Norman Gray on the board because they had backed his 
takeover efforts and sold him their company shares. 
</P>
<P>
But in a special shareholder meeting Friday, Weekes was bumped from the board 
along with outside directors Gray, Robert H. Davis, George Pratt and John 
Virtue. 
</P>
<P>
Hollander and four of his backers, all apparently connected with his privately 
owned High Technology Holding Corp. in Stamford, Conn., were elected to fill 
the vacated board posts. 
</P>
<P>
But in the statement announcing the change of command, Hollander did not 
identify a new chairman to replace Weekes. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Weekes nor Hollander could be reached for comment Friday and it was not 
clear whether Weekes would remain as Newport's president and chief executive in 
the wake of his removal from the board. 
</P>
<P>
Hollander launched his bid for control of Newport Electronics in July, nearly 
four months after Newport had agreed to be acquired by Sensor Control, a 
Silicon Valley electronics company, for $9 per share, or $10.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Hollander, who owned 13% of Newport's common stock at the time, offered $9.50 a 
share for enough stock to raise his stake in the company to 48%. 
</P>
<P>
When Newport's board rejected that offer, he increased the price to $11 a 
share, or $4.3 million. Both Weekes and Gray then announced that they would 
sell their shares -- a total of 24.6% of the company stock -- to Hollander, an 
engineer and former vice president of Gulf + Western Inc., now Paramount 
Communications.

ARTS PANEL'S ADVICE ASKED IN SPENDING OF TOURIST DOLLARS; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCES: COSTA MESA'S TOURISM, ARTS AND PROMOTIONS COUNCIL WANTS THE 
COMMITTEE'S INPUT ON HOW TO SPEND AS MUCH AS $2.2 MILLION.

<TEXT>
<P>
With up to $2.2 million possibly available for the arts and tourism in Costa 
Mesa next year, the city's Cultural Arts Committee has been asked for advice on 
how to spend it. 
</P>
<P>
The money is to be allocated through the new Costa Mesa Tourism, Arts and 
Promotion Council, which held its first formal meeting Thursday night. The 
nonprofit council is run by a seven-member board named by the Costa Mesa City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to ask the Cultural Arts Committee to remain as an adviser on the 
state of the arts in the city of Costa Mesa," Mike Chitjian, newly elected 
tourism council president, said Thursday. Until recently, he was president of 
the cultural arts panel. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-member Cultural Arts Committee recommends grant recipients to the 
City Council. This year, 13 groups, from South Coast Repertory to the American 
Boys Choir, won a total of $175,000 in city subsidies. None of its members are 
employed by arts organizations, Chitjian said, but each one serves as a liaison 
to a grant recipient and could therefore convey those groups' views or needs, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The new tourism and arts council, established in August, set its next meeting 
for Thursday and asked representatives from the cultural committee and from the 
Costa Mesa Chamber of Commerce's hospitality committee to attend. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, any member of the local arts community may express his ideas by 
"communicating with the Cultural Arts Committee by telephone or letters" sent 
to City Hall, Chitjian said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, "if the board feels they need direct input from cultural arts 
organizations themselves, I'd be in favor of inviting (officials from such 
groups) to a meeting" of the arts and tourism council, Chitjian added. 
</P>
<P>
At least one local arts administrator hopes the new council will seek ideas 
directly from arts professionals. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope this body, when it comes up with basic ideas, would at least get 
the reactions and feedback from the artistic community," said David Emmes, 
producing artistic director of South Coast Repertory. "Not that we distrust 
them to come up with a plan. It just seems we are an asset that would be 
helpful about thinking about the plan or polishing the plan." 
</P>
<P>
Even as discussions begin on how to spend as much as $2.2 million on arts and 
tourism, the money source is still being decided. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are still deliberating over a funding mechanism, though they say 
the new tourism and arts council will probably be financed through a fee or tax 
charged on local hotel and motel bills. A city hotel-motel tax now generates 
about $2.2 million a year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A final recommendation on the proposed tax and how to spend the money will 
probably be made to the Costa Mesa City Council in January, said City Manager 
Allan L. Roeder. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Chitjian, other members of the new council's board were elected 
as its officers Thursday. Russell C. Cox, general manager of the Red Lion 
Hotel, Costa Mesa, was named vice president; Edna G. Bradley, who belongs to a 
support group of the Orange County Performing Arts Center, was named secretary, 
and Frank Cole, a businessman, was elected treasurer.

KARWELIS' PAINTINGS SEEM TO RETURN TO SQUARE ONE; 
</P>
<P>
ART: THE ARTIST'S LATEST WORKS AT LJ GALLERY IN NEWPORT BEACH LOOK AS THOUGH HE 
IS STRIPPING EVERYTHING AWAY TO BEGIN AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Donald Karwelis' work has undergone numerous sea changes since the 1960s when 
he painted the wonderful little Abstract Expressionist seated figure in Newport 
Harbor Art Museum's collection. At LJ Gallery in Newport Beach (through 
Tuesday), his latest paintings -- images of central vertical shapes arrowing 
down into brushy color-neutralized backgrounds -- look as though he is busy 
stripping everything away to begin again at square one. 
</P>
<P>
Without reading the labels, a viewer might well think this was the fashionably 
reductive work of a recent art school graduate, rather than a new direction for 
an old hand. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Karwelis, whose studio is in Santa Ana, has chased after various trends 
during the past few decades, never really regaining the strength of his early 
work. But the sobriety and simplicity of his current approach seems promising. 
</P>
<P>
The shapes variously resemble industrial pipes, hoses, funnels and drill bits. 
Seen from slightly below or slightly above, they loom as portentously as 
monumental architecture, or descend into unseen depths. 
</P>
<P>
In "Untitled 46-C1," (even the titles have a no-nonsense, utilitarian sound), 
the diagonal wrap winding around a blue pipe -- like screw threads in reverse 
-- oddly suggests the torsion of the human figure. A puce green haze (of 
pollution?) in "Untitled 44-C1" forms a parenthesis around a gray pipe edged 
with flickers of bright primary colors. 
</P>
<P>
Still to come, one imagines, are more sophisticated variants on these 
five-finger exercises, elaborations that will take the imagery to a more 
complex plane. 
</P>
<P>
Also on view are two- and three- dimensional mixed-media works by Steve Heino, 
a young Los Angeles artist. His pieces in this exhibit generally seem more 
arbitrary and less thoughtful than the massive works he showed at Laguna Art 
Museum last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Coxwain," an elevated, suspended, translucent canoe shape, seems like a 
dead-end, lacking the resonance one expects from sculpture. (So? What about 
this canoe?) Paintings on paper of buoys look like little more than noodling 
around with shapes, waiting for inspiration to strike. 
</P>
<P>
But Heino is running on all engines again in "Sweet and Juicy," a small 
construction. Ghostly advertising images of citrus fruits on a metal 
lithography plate play off a segmented, three-dimensional sculptural component 
that curiously suggests the action of peeling apart the membranes of the fruit. 
The most quietly effective piece is "Passage," an eye-fooling block of wood 
mounted on the wall in which an archway is made to look as though it recedes 
endlessly into the distance. 
</P>
<P>
Financially bolstered by a third partner, Anaheim attorney David Boros, the 
gallery -- which will be known as LJB Gallery -- is expanding across the 
walkway into another suite of offices. The enlarged, 2,800-square-foot space, 
opening Nov. 20, will nearly triple the size of the tiny original space. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent work by Donald Karwelis and Steve Heino remains through Oct. 31 at LJ 
Gallery, 359 San Miguel Drive, No. 105, Newport Beach. Hours are 11 a.m. to 4 
p.m. today and Tuesday. Information: (714) 720-0133.

WHEN PET FROG ARRIVES, IT'S WISE TO CHECK UP ON PHASE 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY ZEZIMA, STAMFORD ADVOCATE

<TEXT>
<P>
Our frog died recently. Croaked, I guess you could say. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, we are very upset. For one thing, we will no longer be able to gross 
out dinner guests by saying, "Before you eat, would you like to see our frog?" 
</P>
<P>
For another, the little guy was kind of neat: completely aquatic, eerily 
transparent (more on this later) and easy to take care of. So easy, in fact, 
that for quite a while -- a month, perhaps -- we didn't have to feed him. 
</P>
<P>
Which is probably why he died. 
</P>
<P>
As the more astute among you already may have surmised, this was no ordinary 
frog. Rather, it was something called a Grow-a-Frog, which, for those who are 
not yet aware that mad scientists have finally found gainful employment, was 
raised by "frog experts" at the Three Rivers Amphibian Frog Farm in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
I know this because it says so on page 12 of "Frog Fun and Facts," a tiny 
booklet that was sent to our home, along with an even tinier tadpole, by Three 
Rivers Amphibian Inc. of Massapequa, N.Y., makers of the amazing Grow-a-Frog. 
</P>
<P>
The test-tube tadpole was a birthday present to my daughter, Katie, from one of 
her friends. To shield his identity lest he be swamped with requests for these 
bizarre beasties, I shall refer to him only as Eric. 
</P>
<P>
It was at Katie's 9th birthday party this summer that Eric, who apparently 
knows more than I ever did about impressing girls, made the big presentation. 
</P>
<P>
"Wow!" Katie exclaimed. "Look what Eric gave me!" 
</P>
<P>
"What, sweetheart?" I said gently. "A Barbie doll? A Debbie Gibson tape?" 
</P>
<P>
Katie: "A frog!" 
</P>
<P>
Me: THUD. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a frog per se, but a certificate promising the delivery, in about two 
weeks, of the world's only laboratory-tested, fully guaranteed, see-through 
creature. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, two weeks and one day later, the doorbell rang. It was a friendly 
parcel person with a package containing one live Grow-a-Frog tadpole, one Stage 
One Plex-Aquarium, one packet of Nutri-Rocks, one Deco-Plant, one container of 
Stage One Food and one edition of "Frog Fun and Facts," soon to be a minor 
motion picture. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing we noticed, aside from the perplexed look on the face of the 
friendly parcel person, was that the tadpole was transparent. As he swam around 
in his little bag, we could actually see his tiny heart pulsating. 
</P>
<P>
After fainting temporarily, I consulted "Frog Fun and Facts" for information on 
how to care for the little monster, which we named not Frogenstein but "Gilly." 
I read the introduction ("Hoppy days are here again! I'm Grow-a-Frog, your new 
pet friend!") and two pages with the headings "I'm a Beautiful Baby" and 
"Turning Into a Prince" before coming to the important stuff. 
</P>
<P>
It seems, for instance, that Grow-a-Frogs, which are "hand-picked, carefully 
packed and sent fresh from the farm to you," are pretty particular about the 
water they live in. As it warns on page 16: "Please use only bottled SPRING or 
PURIFIED WATER for your tadpole." 
</P>
<P>
Reasoning that it was a small price to pay for the welfare of a mutant 
amphibian, we bought a gallon of spring water and poured some of it, along with 
the Nutri-Rocks and the Deco-Plant, into the Stage One Plex-Aquarium, which was 
nothing more than a small plastic box with a hole in the top. 
</P>
<P>
We faithfully fed Gilly one level spoon of Stage One Food every day, as 
instructed, and changed his water once a week. Before long he had sprouted four 
tiny legs, at which point we were supposed to stop feeding him. That's because 
he would get all the nourishment he needed from his tail. 
</P>
<P>
Here is where the confusion began. Although the frog's tail eventually 
disappeared, the instruction booklet said he would still get nourishment from 
the Nutri-Rocks, a bunch of weird blue pebbles that provided additional food. 
</P>
<P>
So we left the little guy alone. Unfortunately, we weren't too clear on when we 
should resume feeding him. "Frog Fun and Facts" said only that, during Stage 
Two of his development (whenever that was supposed to be), he could subsist on 
"small pieces of earthworm or beef heart." Yum. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, the frog went belly up one day. After a brief mourning period, 
we had a private toilet-side service. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose we could fill out the replacement guarantee and wait for a friendly 
parcel person to deliver another Grow-a-Frog. From now on, though, I think 
we'll stick to goldfish.

SPAIN'S POLITICIANS VOW TO ABOLISH 'MILI' SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN BROWN, REUTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MADRID 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every year nearly a quarter of a million young Spanish men abandon their 
families, jobs and homes for 12 months of obligatory military service on a wage 
of $8 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Popularly called the "mili," it is the lot of most young men in Western Europe, 
except in Britain, Ireland and Luxembourg. In Eastern Europe it can last up to 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
In Spain, however, with elections Sunday, politicians have made the "mili" a 
campaign issue, courting voters with promises to reduce or abolish it amid 
debate about its effect on the efficiency and political neutrality of the armed 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
With new promises launched every week, young Spaniards have started making 
jokes about the issue. "What's the 'mili' level today," they ask, treating it 
like a fluctuating exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling Spanish Socialist Workers' Party has offered a reduction of three 
months. It was outbid by a four-month cut proposed by the conservative Popular 
Party. The centrist Democratic and Social Center beat both with a promise to 
cut the "mili" by nine months and eventually abolish it. 
</P>
<P>
The United Left coalition wants a reduction followed by a referendum on 
abolition. "There are too many soldiers in Spain," a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
A recent opinion poll said 62.5% of voters thought the "mili" was too long 
while more than half thought the armed forces should be manned exclusively by 
professionals and volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Since the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975, and even more so since an 
attempted coup in 1981, there has been a drive to shrink, modernize and 
depoliticize the military. 
</P>
<P>
Aging senior officers have been pensioned off while any officer making 
political statements risks arrest. 
</P>
<P>
One officer was recently sentenced to 14 days of house arrest for imparting to 
the press his views on the army -- the least modern of the forces and the 
destination of most conscripts. 
</P>
<P>
"At the moment the Spanish army is useless," Col. Amadeo Martinez Ingles told 
Cambio 16 magazine. Conscripts "are not motivated because they are obliged to 
be there. From the rank of colonel downward, everyone agrees we must work 
toward a professional army." 
</P>
<P>
Ingles, who wants the army cut to 80,000 men, said the government intentionally 
kept the armed forces ineffective to avoid a repeat of the 1981 attempted coup, 
when civil guards stormed parliament at the instigation of army generals. 
</P>
<P>
"The political powers are afraid of an operational and efficient army," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A Defense Ministry official denied the allegation. "There is no fear at all," 
he said. "The army is perfectly conscious of its role serving democracy." 
</P>
<P>
A NATO diplomat agreed that fears of a coup had vanished. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been struck by how remote an issue it has become," he said. The 
diplomat said it was unlikely a fully professional army would pose more of a 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
"Experiences in Latin America show you don't need a sophisticated army to 
intervene in politics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"A more sophisticated army is less likely to be political, they'd be too busy 
training." 
</P>
<P>
But a smaller, fully professional military would be more costly than a 
conscript army, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The Ministry official said the "mili," enshrined in the Constitution decreeing 
"every Spaniard has the right and duty to defend Spain," helped democracy by 
ensuring Spaniards from all social classes were integrated in the military's 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition to obligatory military service came from a false sense of security, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"People see no immediate threat and think defense is not necessary." 
</P>
<P>
One group of opponents of the "mili," Defensor del Soldado (Defender of the 
Soldier), said a lack of basic rights for all military personnel caused a high 
incidence of suicides while bad training and poor equipment caused fatal 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Official figures showed that of some 160 deaths in 1988 in the armed forces, 24 
were suicides and 30 were accidents of a military nature. 
</P>
<P>
One 21-year-old law student said he was trying to escape the "mili" on medical 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a whole year and now that I'm studying, with possibilities of going out 
into the job market, it's a horrific waste of time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Other young people I know object to it for deeper ethical reasons," he added. 
</P>
<P>
"They say that with all this talk about peace and disarmament, why can't we 
just have a small army?

A wind-swept "Moon Over the Mediterranean" gala that celebrated Fashion Island 
Newport Center's $100-million renovation. On Wednesday night, a few thousand 
well-heeled guests swept along gleaming tile walkways, rhapsodized over new 
fountains, explored new shops, and sipped, supped and swayed till the wee 
hours, helping to chalk up more than $250,000 for seven local youth charities: 
the Orange County Philharmonic Youth Programs, the Mardan Center of Educational 
Therapy, the Irvine Theatre Children's Programs, the Orange County Bar 
Foundation, Shortstop Program, Childhelp USA and the Irvine Children's Fund. 
</P>
<P>
The Food 
</P>
<P>
The Mediterranean never had it so good. Thymes caterers was faithful to the 
theme, serving up 5,000 pounds of herb-seasoned beef and 1,000 pounds each of 
grilled tuna and swordfish, not to mention bushels of pasta and enough 
chocolate brownies to sink a yacht. Other highlights: three kinds of fresh 
pears quartered and dipped into an apricot candied syrup, grilled, then served 
with a zabaglione cream. Another mob pleaser: chicken marinated in pomegranate 
juice (400 pomegranates were crushed to a pulp to pull this one off) and 
seasoned with sage, garlic and thyme. The bubbly, served on silver trays, never 
stopped flowing. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted 
</P>
<P>
"Newport Center has become a Mediterranean town," said billionaire Donald Bren, 
chairman of the Irvine Co., which, along with The Times Orange County, 
sponsored the benefit. "The climate here is the same as the Mediterranean's and 
so is the architecture. This center exudes a radiance, an energy. It will 
become a special way of life for everyone." His favorite shop? "I enjoy them 
all," Bren said. His favorite restaurant? "I enjoy them all too." 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There 
</P>
<P>
Benefit chairpersons Sharon Sarvak, Joyce Gwidt, Ginny Hayward, Mary Ellen 
Hadley, Judith Ryan and Mitzi Tonai, along with a herd of Irvine Co. heavy 
hitters, a horde of Yuppies and a gaggle of socialites. 
</P>
<P>
What They Wore 
</P>
<P>
Bren sported a deep-burgundy tie with a supremely well-cut charcoal gray suit. 
A white pocket square accented his ensemble. He also wore a golden-boy tan (we 
hear he's taken up wind-surfing in Maui and on the Caribbean). The chairwomen 
were dressed to kill, with Judy Ryan sporting a chic St. John knit jumpsuit and 
Joyce Gwidt shielding herself against the nippy breezes in a suede coat she'd 
purchased during a recent getaway in Italy. Thymes owner Janet Rosener proved a 
walkie-talkie looks absolutely charming with figure-hugging black velvet. And 
furs -- loads of them -- were flung over glittery party dresses. 
</P>
<P>
Tender Moment 
</P>
<P>
A parade of light was staged at 8:30 p.m., with dozens of children marching 
along a paseo holding flashlights and passing out thank you notes to guests.

ON THE WATERFRONT: CHOC CHARITY REGATTA INCLUDES VARIED RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Three years ago, when Lyle Kerr staged the first fund-raising regatta for 
Childrens Hospital of Orange County, the event netted just $2,500, but it 
attracted attention from around the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I got calls from all over the United States about how to start a charity 
regatta," said Kerr, a member of the Padrinos, CHOC's men's support group. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, fund-raising regattas were few and far between. Based upon the 
phone calls Kerr received, he thinks that the CHOC Regatta was one of the first 
in the country. Most groups sponsor tennis tournaments, golf tournaments and 
5-K and 10-K runs, according to Kerr, who saw a regatta as a way to attract 
more hospital supporters from the beach areas of the county. 
</P>
<P>
Although the first CHOC Regatta attracted just six entries, the event made 
money -- thanks to race sponsors and donations. The second regatta attracted 17 
entries, but even more important it attracted the support of one of the area's 
best-known and most influential sailing groups: the Newport Ocean Sailing 
Assn., sponsor of the Ensenada Yacht Race. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted people to know we do some other things," says Lorin Weiss, president 
of NOSA. "There is more to NOSA than the Ensenada Yacht Race. We feel that we 
have a social conscience, but that we probably have not expressed it, and this 
is a means of expressing our social conscience to the community." 
</P>
<P>
This year, with NOSA's continued involvement, Kerr says the regatta, which is 
being held today and Sunday in Newport Beach, is expected to draw about 50 
boats. The event will consist of an ocean race for large sailboats, an 
inside-the-harbor race for small sailboats and two powerboat races -- one for 
large powerboats and one for dinghies. 
</P>
<P>
"We mailed invitations out from San Luis Obispo to the Mexican border," Kerr 
says, "but we expect most of our entries will be local Orange County boats." 
</P>
<P>
The entry fee is $100 per boat. Because of donations and corporate sponsorship, 
Kerr says, "we have a zero budget, so everything goes to Childrens Hospital 
direct." 
</P>
<P>
The fund-raising goal this year is $7,500, according to Kerr, who is confident 
the goal will be met, thanks to the corporate sponsorship of Northern Trust of 
California, which has pledged $22,500 toward the regatta over the next three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The company sponsored a kickoff party for children at the hospital, held a 
regatta poster design contest for students and is donating trophies, according 
to David W. Stein, a vice president with the Newport Beach office of the 
Chicago-based financial firm. Stein, who is also a sailor, will be among the 
race participants. 
</P>
<P>
To attract more entries from women sailors, this year the regatta will offer a 
trophy to the first all-female crew to finish the race, according to Kerr. And 
to attract more interest among powerboaters, the regatta will also include a 
powerboat portion called a predicted log race, a popular form of navigation 
competition in which contestants predict how long it will take them to finish a 
given course. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Foster, who is helping plan the powerboat part of the regatta, said a 
predicted log race is "a precision navigation contest." 
</P>
<P>
"Speed has nothing to do with it. A boat that runs seven knots has just as much 
chance as a boat that runs 25 knots," said Foster, a member of the Southern 
California Cruising Assn., which runs many such races. 
</P>
<P>
"You are given a course of places to go, buoys, oil islands, whatever, and you 
predict the time exactly to the second that you will be there at that point. 
You can't use a clock or a speed indicator. You can only use a compass and a 
tachometer. 
</P>
<P>
"You have an official observer aboard the boat, and the skipper is not allowed 
to know what time it is during the race. He never sees a clock until the race 
is over. The object is that the person with the lesser amount of error (in the 
time he predicted it would take him to run the course) is declared the winner." 
</P>
<P>
Winners are often separated by mere seconds, Foster says. "A lot depends upon 
the waters, the currents and the wind. You have to have good navigation skills, 
and you have to know your boat." 
</P>
<P>
To add a bit of fun to this year's regatta, Kerr says there will also be a 
dinghy race, patterned after the predicted log competition. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way you can take a dinghy and accurately predict what you are going 
to do," Foster says, "so nobody is really taking this part seriously. We're 
mostly doing it for fun." 
</P>
<P>
Skippers will be expected to run a one-mile course in the harbor and predict 
exactly how long it will take them, Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
All events except the dinghy race will be held today. Activities begin with a 
skippers' meeting at 11:45 a.m. at Lido Isle Yacht Club, 701 Via Lido Soud, for 
participants in the inside-the-harbor sailboat races. The race for large 
sailboats will begin at noon in the harbor off the Grand Canal, between Balboa 
Island and Little Island. 
</P>
<P>
Boats will then race a course that will take them out into the ocean. Entry 
forms for the race may be picked up at Balboa Yacht Club, 1801 Bayside Drive, 
Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
The predicted log race for large powerboats will also be held today, but the 
starting time is up to the discretion of individual skippers. The race is being 
run out of the Bahia Corinthian Yacht Club, 1601 Bayside Drive, Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
A hot-dog dinner will be served at Balboa Yacht Club today about 4 p.m., after 
all three races are over. Activities Sunday will begin at 8 a.m. with a 
skippers' meeting at Bahia Corinthian Yacht Club for contestants in the dinghy 
race. The regatta will conclude with a brunch and awards ceremony at 11 a.m. 
Sunday at the Balboa Yacht Club. For information, call (714) 640-1351.

ASK THE JUDGE: CHILD'S VIEWS ON PARENTS VISITATION RIGHTS WEIGHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By B. TAM NOMOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q. I am divorced and have two teen-age sons, ages 15 and 16, who are doing very 
well academically and socially with both peers and adults. The oldest is 
working and driving his own car. They have had a rocky time with their father 
over the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, I was served with papers to increase their father's visitation 
rights. Neither of the boys want to see their father more often. Should the 
boys go to court on the date set for hearing, and how can these orders be 
enforced with such independent young adults? 
</P>
<P>
SH, 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
A. Your question is one that is frequently asked. Your sons should be present 
at the hearing because the court is required to consider the wishes of a child 
and give it "due weight" if the child is of "sufficient age and capacity to 
reason so as to form an intelligent preference as to custody." 
</P>
<P>
There is no magic age as to when a child will be considered capable of making 
such an intelligent decision. Generally, the older the child, the more weight 
will be given to his wishes, although this is not a fast rule. 
</P>
<P>
Your sons, however, being 15 and 16 years of age, are old enough that they 
should be able to articulate their feelings and desires to the court. 
Generally, most courts would consider the wishes of children their age very 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I am a divorced man and am living with my girlfriend. We have an agreement 
that all expenses such as rent and food are shared equally. 
</P>
<P>
My ex-wife heard about this and has now threatened to ask the court to raise 
the amount of child support I pay for our child. She says that since I am 
saving money by having a roommate, I should pay more to her for our child. Does 
this make sense? 
</P>
<P>
P.C., 
</P>
<P>
Tustin 
</P>
<P>
A. The law shares her point of view, agreeing that if a non-marital partner is 
contributing to your living expenses, that person's income must be considered 
to the extent that it reduces those expenses. The reasoning behind this is that 
since your expenses have been reduced, you therefore have more money to spend 
on your child. 
</P>
