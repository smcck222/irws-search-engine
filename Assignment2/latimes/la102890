XENAKIS: "Pleiades;" ISHII: Concertante. Les Percussions de Strasbourg; Keiko 
Abe, marimba. 
</P>
<P>
Denon 81757 3678 2 (compact disc). Written for the Strasbourg ensemble, 
Xenakis' four-movement suite explores the gamut of percussion sounds with his 
characteristic mixture of rigorous process and galvanic energy, all pertinently 
and powerfully rapped out here. Maki Ishii's 1988 Concertante for marimba solo 
and six percussionists is a more lyrical effort, with a diffuse, suspended 
sense of time, neatly captured in a performance at once earthy and abstracted.

BRAHMS: Hungarian Dances. Staatskapelle Berlin conducted by Otmar Suitner.

The liner notes state approvingly that "Suitner invariably conducts in an 
orthodox manner without any hint of flashiness . . . " Fine for 16th-Century, 
five-part motets maybe, but a strange thing to brag about in a recording of the 
Hungarian Dances. Generally dense textures, wimpily projected dance rhythms, 
sedate lyricism and a merely adequate orchestra combine to produce this utterly 
ordinary and forgettable release. TIMOTHY MANGAN

MUSIC NEWS: MEL POWELL TO OPEN AMERICAN COMPOSERS SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wednesday, a program of music by Mel Powell will open the 10th consecutive 
season of one of the more prestigious series in the nation: the American 
Composers Series at the Kennedy Center's Terrace Theater in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Pulitzer Prize-winning composer, who has taught at CalArts for two 
decades, is leery of such programmatic arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
"One-composer programs are problematic, even if the composer is Bach," Powell 
says. But, he continues, such programs are possible "if the composer will not 
resist certain retrospective aspects of putting them together." 
</P>
<P>
Too many music writers "try to get rid of their early pieces, as if they should 
be ashamed of them. I like all my children." 
</P>
<P>
On Halloween night -- "the symbolism of the demoniacal is not lost on me," says 
the composer -- forces from CalArts, plus eight guest artists, will gather for 
a Powell program surveying works from the period between 1954 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
One of the recent pieces on this program -- "Settings," to be played by Bryan 
Pezzone and Trina Dye -- was a study for Powell's "Duplicates: A Concerto for 
Two Pianos," which earlier this year took the Pulitzer Prize in music 
composition, after being introduced at a Los Angeles Philharmonic concert in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Also from the 1980s are "Modules: An Intermezzo," to be performed by the New 
CalArts Twentieth Century Players; Three Madrigals for flute alone (1989), to 
be played by Rachel Rudich; and the String Quartet (1982), to be performed by 
the Colorado String Quartet, which played it at the La Jolla summer festival 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people believe that music like mine, abstract music which is not 
programmatic, has little connection with its own time. I disagree," says the 
67-year old composer. 
</P>
<P>
"For my generation of composers, the world is indeed reflected in our works. 
There are elements that have darkened our waning years. Four decades ago, we 
were all buoyant and optimistic -- I'm talking about writers of serious 
American music, music for which there appeared to be a public. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, we really thought the future was going to be bright and peppery. 
Then came Vietnam, all those assassinations. . . . By 1982, both we and the 
world had gone awry. That's all in the music." 
</P>
<P>
But today, recuperating successfully after a recent, extended hospital stay, 
Powell seems to have come out of his dark period. He will travel to Washington 
for the concert. What has changed? 
</P>
<P>
"I giggle more now than ever before. For a six-week period, I was being fed 
intravenously. I'll never forget my first taste after that: It was only a 
spoonful of ice water, but it tasted like ambrosia. 
</P>
<P>
"After that kind of experience, the world seems changed. Every Toyota looks 
like a Rembrandt." 
</P>
<P>
The Kennedy Center American Composers Series, coordinated by Lois Howard, 
continues Dec. 5 with a 75th birthday celebration for David Diamond. Among the 
artists appearing on that program will be soprano Ruth Golden and the Benny Kim 
Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990-91 series closes March 13 with a program of music by Leon Kirchner, at 
which the composer will appear as pianist with, among others, the Orion String 
Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
PREMIERE: The world premiere performances of Robert Starer's latest work, 
"Nishmat Adam -- The Soul of Man," will be given Monday and Tuesday nights at 
Stephen S. Wise Temple in Bel-Air. Singers Gayna Sauler and Nathan Lam are the 
soloists; composer Starer will narrate, the Stephen S. Wise Symphony Orchestra 
will be conducted by Michael Isaacson. The new work, written by Starer on a 
commission from the Stephen S. Wise Temple, contains seven movements, and uses 
texts from Shakespeare, Itzhak Peretz, Stephen S. Wise and the Bible. In an 
introduction to the work, the composer says that the title of the new cantata 
comes from Proverbs: "Ner Adonai Nishmat Adam," translated, "The Light of God 
is the Soul of Man." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Vienna in 1924, Starer attended the Jerusalem Conservatory, 1938-43, 
before serving in the British air force, then entered the Juilliard School in 
1947. He has written three operas and seven ballets, four of them for Martha 
Graham. Since completing "Nishmat Adam," Starer says he is writing another 
vocal work, this one also based on texts from Proverbs, and written for the 
92nd Street YMHA in New York City.

BRUCKNER: Symphony No. 5. NDR Orchestra, conducted by Gunter Wand. RCA Victor 
60361-2-RC (compact disc). 
</P>
<P>
A skeptical consumer might wonder why RCA Victor is remaking its Wand-Bruckner 
cycle when Wand's perfectly good earlier one, vintage 1974-1981, is still in 
its catalogue. There certainly are some differences in this new Fifth -- more 
expressive, flexible phrasing from the wise old veteran conductor, a better 
orchestra with less raucous brass, slightly superior live digital sound. Yet 
Wand's basic overview remains the same, an invigorating, straight-ahead 
approach that only taps moderately into Bruckner's spiritual depths. RICHARD S.

RECORD RACK: 1/2 SLAYER "SEASONS IN THE ABYSS" DEF AMERICAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the beginning, there were Metallica and Slayer, and only Metallica and 
Slayer, the two giants of new American metal. If Metallica was the Beatles of 
the genre, the guys who made heavy rock respectable again, Slayer was the 
Rolling Stones: dark, violent and nasty, fascinated with evil, the favorite 
group of every bad kid in suburbia (that was Slayer blasting out of the tape 
decks in "River's Edge"). 
</P>
<P>
Slayer was the most extreme band anybody could think of, and the most intense 
stage performers in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Over time, thousands ofother bands copied the Slayer formula, many of them 
playing even faster than Slayer, and others -- Carcass, Napalm Death -- relying 
on more violent imagery. Slayer slowed things down on its last album, and a lot 
of the other bands did too, but sludge-metal had the feeling of an artistic 
dead end. 
</P>
<P>
This time out, instead of being imitated, Slayer is imitating, sort of, the 
logical direction taken by Metallica when that band evolved from the pure 
thrash of "Kill 'Em All." On "Seasons in the Abyss," by far the most accessible 
Slayer opus, the songs are riffy instead of droning, the vocals toned down from 
howls to snarls, the emphasis shifted from thrash to rock. It's not quite as 
impressive as '87's "Reign in Blood," one of the best two or three metal 
records ever made, but maybe they'll finally sell more albums than T-shirts.

 "CHRISTGAU'S RECORD GUIDE: THE '80S" BY ROBERT CHRISTGAU PANTHEON BOOKS 
($17.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN

<TEXT>
<P>
Christgau is the pop critic whose review I'd turn to first if I were a 
recording artist -- even though he (a) can be slow to catch on to great bands, 
(b) is a sucker for anything with Third World ties and (c) can be an 
impenetrable writer. 
</P>
<P>
For example. 
</P>
<P>
(1) Christgau, who grades a dozen or so albums each month in his provocative 
Village Voice column, gave U2's debut album a C+ (which is closer to poor than 
fair on his scale) though the album clearly signaled the arrival of an 
interesting new rock force -- one that went on to be arguably the most 
celebrated rock band of the '80s. From his grouchy dismissal: "Their youth, 
their serious air, and their guitar sound are setting a small world on fire, 
and I fear the worst." 
</P>
<P>
(2) Try to find any album ever released by the Heartbeat, Mango, Earthworks, 
Hannibal or Shanachie labels that he scored lower than B+. 
</P>
<P>
(3) Impenetrable? Turn to almost any page and you're likely to find something 
that makes you shake your head. 
</P>
<P>
Try the review of X's "See How We Are" album on page 448: "Even during the 
first four songs, when the sustained detail of the writing -- with a boost from 
Dave Alvin's tormented yet unembittered '4th of July' -- makes it seem like 
they'll fight for every inch, you miss Billy Zoom's syncretic junk: fine though 
he is, Tony Gilkyson is too neoclassy for these convinced vulgarians. Then the 
material devolves into complaints, throwaways, wasted stanzas, and utter 
clinkers." 
</P>
<P>
So why care so much about what he says or be grateful for this collection of 
his '80s columns? 
</P>
<P>
Quite simply, Christgau writes with the same reckless independence and 
ferocious eccentricity that fuels our most valuable pop artists. His style is 
what might result if Dylan or Young (Neil, not Paul) turned in their guitars 
for word processors. 
</P>
<P>
More than individual artists, Christgau is interested in the state of rock and 
in the richness of its culture. That's why he constantly challenges artists, 
fans and other critics to demand more of themselves and their favorites, and 
why he nurtures new and significant developments, however uncommercial or 
controversial. ROBERT HILBURN

 1/2 "SUPREME FAITH . . . SOMEDAY WE'LL BE TOGETHER" BY MARY WILSON AND 
PATRICIA ROMANOWSKI HARPER COLLINS ($19.95)

Where's the dirt? There's not much in this sequel to Wilson's 1986 "Dreamgirl" 
-- about the rise of the Supremes, the Motown vocal trio featuring Diana Ross 
that reigned in the '60s. Thanks to the dirt -- Wilson was the first to 
extensively paint Ross as a villain in print -- the first book is billed as the 
most successful autobiography by a pop performer in book-publishing history. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently Wilson used up all the good gossip in the first one, which covered 
the Supremes' rise up to Ross' departure in early 1970. The sequel reads like 
something Wilson wrote to capitalize on the success of "Dreamgirl;" since then, 
other books have also trashed Ross, robbing Wilson of her whipping girl. 
</P>
<P>
Ross is a minor character in the new book, which covers the post-Ross decline 
of the Supremes, Wilson's legal battles with Motown and her personal struggles. 
A battered wife, Wilson triumphs over a bad marriage and tries to resurrect her 
music career. None of this, however, is particularly riveting. This book would 
be more interesting if the first one hadn't been so chock-full of juicy gossip, 
whetting appetites for more of the same. DENNIS HUNT

 "12 DAYS ON THE ROAD: THE SEX PISTOLS AND AMERICA" BY NOEL E. MONK AND JIMMY

Sex, drugs and anti-rock 'n' roll: Here are the sights, the sounds and the 
smells of a rock tour more disastrous than even Spinal Tap's. The story of the 
Pistols' sole, brief 1977 American trip, as told by tour manager Monk and rock 
journalist Guterman, revolves mostly around Sid Vicious' inevitable spiral 
toward self-destruction. 
</P>
<P>
To a lesser extent we get Johnny Rotten (sneering, nose-picking), manager 
Malcolm McLaren (manipulative but spineless), Pistols Steve Jones and Paul Cook 
(childish) and a host of colorful punks, punk wanna-bes and other ugly 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Opening with a vivid account of a Pistols concert, capturing all the 
exhiliration, release and violence of punk at its most intense, the book then 
mirrors the punk era itself as the rush wears off, returning only 
intermittently. Still, the story -- already familiar to those who saw the movie 
"Sid &amp; Nancy" -- is well told with equal amounts of perverse fascination 
and weary revulsion, and offers considerable insight into both youth alienation 
and the music business. 
</P>
<P>
Monk (curiously referred to in the third person, despite the journal-like 
format of the book) is the disgusted baby-sitter who thought he'd seen it all, 
but learned quickly that he was quite mistaken. Also mistaken were those 
associated with the jaunt who thought it would forever change the face of 
popular culture. The inescapable conclusion is that for all its celebrated 
importance, the most lasting aspect of the Pistols' moment of anarchic glory 
was its futility. STEVE HOCHMAN

THIS YEAR'S MODEL: Remember all the publicity George Michael got when he 
announced he wouldn't be doing any videos for his new album (because he wanted 
us to focus on his song lyrics)? Let's say that was . . . half-true. Michael 
isn't appearing in any videos, but that doesn't mean he isn't making any 
videos. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, hot-shot director David Fincher (who's scheduled to shoot "Aliens 
III") has just finished a five-day shoot in London of Michael's upcoming 
single, "Freedom 90." Instead of spotlighting George, the clip showcases a 
quintet of world-class fashion models, including Cindy Crawford, Christy 
Turlington and Tatiana, who lip-sync the song (you could say it's like Robert 
Palmer's "Addicted to Love" clip, except without Palmer). . . . And from our 
Wish We'd Been There Dept.: When Tom Petty celebrated his 40th birthday at his 
San Fernando Valley home last weekend, the music room got quite a workout. 
Celebrants included Bruce Springsteen, Roger McGuinn, Jeff Lynne and most of 
the Heartbreakers, who launched into a spontaneous jam, featuring such 
favorites as "Little Red Rooster," "Roll Over Beethoven," "Mr. Tambourine Man" 
and "Great Balls of Fire." Spectators included Elvis Costello, Gary Shandling, 
Carlene Carter and Howie Epstein (who are a couple these days) and Kathy 
Valentine.

AND FINALLY: Green Bay Packers quarterback Don Majkowski isn't the only 
hard-rock fan in the NFL (or even on the Packers). His teammate, Packers 
lineman Tony Mandarich, who's a pal of Guns N' Roses top-gun Axl Rose, wears an 
"Appetite for Destruction" tattoo on his arm. . . . Speaking of odd 
collaborations -- Robert Palmer has teamed up with UB40 to record a cover 
version of Bob Dylan's "I'll Be Your Baby Tonight," which will appear on 
Palmer's new "Don't Explain" album. . . . Watch for Hollywood Records to launch 
a mega-dollar marketing campaign when it releases CD versions of its Queen 
catalogue early next year, which should feature a generous assortment of bonus 
tracks (Hollywood has the rights to a dozen Queen albums originally recorded 
for Elektra Records). . . . She won't be singing the national anthem, but watch 
for a Roseanne Barr comedy album in December, also from Hollywood. . . . Clever 
to the last, Devo has a greatest-hits -- and a great-misses album -- coming 
from Warner Records. . . . And Hard 'n Heavy, the world's first heavy-metal 
video magazine, is such a hit that it's already spawned a competitor -- 
Metalhead Video magazine. Retailing at $12.98, the video-mag's second issue 
features interviews with Whitesnake's David Coverdale and Steve Vai, coverage 
of Aerosmith at Hollywood's Rock Walk of Fame and footage from a Poison 
record-release party.

Dolomite," an outrageous dozens-to-the-death insult duel between Kane and Ray 
(Dolomite) Moore, the legendary black comic. Kane also teams up with Barry 
White on "All of Me," a silky duet where White provides Big Daddy with the kind 
of paternal romantic advice that Humphrey Bogart offered Woody Allen in "Play 
It Again, Sam." As always, Kane's cheeky wordplay reigns supreme, especially on 
"No Dam Good," a Kane critique of some old girlfriends. Dissing his ex-playmate 
Monique, Kane realizes her wardrobe says it all: "Bamboo earrings, all big and 
looking silly, with extensions hanging down like Milli Vanilli."

L.A.'S SABINA OTT, OPENING A GALLERY SHOW IN SANTA MONICA, FINDS A METAPHOR IN 
ROSES THAT AREN'T ALWAYS BEAUTIFUL

In a 1989 show at New York's Charles Cowles Gallery, Sabina Ott began her 
series of encaustic (wax) paintings on the theme "Disappearance and Return" 
with a body of works examining narcissism and the absence of self. Now, 
returning to her hometown of Los Angeles with a show of the same title at Santa 
Monica's Pence Gallery, Ott fills that absence by using the metaphor of the 
rose as "the synthesis between the spiritual and material worlds." 
</P>
<P>
In her paintings, Ott says, the rose acts as a metaphor for the human body. But 
unlike the traditional image, Ott's layered roses are not always beautiful. One 
work, for instance, features blue roses on a flesh-toned background to 
represent bruises on skin. 
</P>
<P>
"Each painting focuses on using the rose as a different aspect of the body," 
says Ott, 35, who has been working with wax since 1987. Conceptual art, she 
says, has had a heavy influence on her work. 
</P>
<P>
"So much of art is about ideas; I set up a conceptual skeleton and then use the 
paint and materials to flesh it out. Through these paintings I set up a 
vocabulary, almost like a code with an alphabet -- I want the work to pose that 
question of 'How do these works relate to each other?' It's very much about 
multiple readings, and one painting really should not be taken on its own 
without looking at the rest of the work." 
</P>
<P>
As an example of how her pieces interrelate, Ott pointed out a four-panel work 
in which each of the small scenes depicted shows up later in a larger work. 
</P>
<P>
"The piece operates as a kind of legend or map . . . giving you the beginnings 
of the alphabet" for the rest of the works, says Ott, an active member of the 
L.A. Coalition for Freedom of Expression who was featured this summer in a 
two-person show at Washington's Corcoran Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
As for the wax, Ott says she likes the "mutability" of the medium and the fact 
that it "complicates" her work. 
</P>
<P>
"I started with strictly paint, but gradually I outgrew that way of looking at 
things. I needed a new and more complex way of setting up questions in the 
work," she says. 
</P>
<P>
THE SCENE 
</P>
<P>
After more than a year of work, Kent Twitchell has completed his 
4,000-square-foot L.A. Marathon Mural along the wall of the northbound San 
Diego Freeway, between Century and Manchester boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
The mural depicts 26 runners, ranging from four-time Olympian Rod Dixon of New 
Zealand to novice runner John Dolan of Sierra Madre. It "extracts the essence 
of the marathon" by picking out a handful of runners from the "sea of 
thousands," Twitchell says. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for Twitchell's second L.A. Marathon Mural, which will take up 7,700 
square feet along the westbound Santa Monica Freeway between National and 
Overland boulevards, are already in progress. 
</P>
<P>
More than $1 million has been raised to date for Harvey Gantt's North Carolina 
U.S. Senate campaign by the sale of lithographs by nine noted artists, 
including Jasper Johns, Robert Motherwell and Ed Ruscha. The prints are on view 
at Santa Monica's James Corcoran and Dorothy Goldeen galleries and at Melrose 
Avenue's Gemini G.E.L. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based service organization Arts Inc. is updating and expanding 
its directory of nonprofit arts organizations in Los Angeles County and has 
sent census forms out to about 400 organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The deadline for organizations to return the questionnaire is Nov. 9, and 
copies of the new directory will be available in early 1991. 
</P>
<P>
OVERHEARD 
</P>
<P>
 "Where did all these young, new artists come from? I can remember when Jill 
Geigerich was the only 'new' artist who got any attention. Now it seems half 
the galleries are filled with 'new' artists." -- A middle-aged man, during a 
Saturday afternoon trek around Santa Monica galleries. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENTS 
</P>
<P>
The Art Dealers Assn. of America and its member galleries have raised $51,150 
for the legal defense fund of the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati, and 
the association is urging other arts groups to mount their own fund-raising 
campaigns for the center. 
</P>
<P>
The center and its director, Dennis Barrie, were acquitted on obscenity charges 
connected with the center's showing of "Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect 
Moment," but accrued more than $300,000 in legal defense fees. 
</P>
<P>
"We have won the battle and reaffirmed our First Amendment rights, but the 
drain on our finances jeopardizes the future of the arts center," said director 
Barrie, who noted that the ADDA's gift and challenge to other groups would help 
ensure the future of the center. 
</P>
<P>

In his film "Avalon," director Barry Levinson casts four non-Jews in the major 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
And although there is a subliminal Jewish star at a cemetery, the word Jew is 
not used once in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
Where were the Jewish actors? Martin Scorsese unabashedly casts Italians as 
Italians in "GoodFellas." He loves his paisani so well he casts them in all the 
roles. He's not worried what others might think. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know why Levinson chose this path. It awakens in me all those ancient 
fears that if the Gentiles know who the Jews really are they will drive us out 
of this country.

Re Hilary de Vries' Oct. 21 article "All the Rage," about performance artist 
Karen Finley: 
</P>
<P>
The Times has twice quoted the artist -- who smears various substances over her 
partly naked body -- as saying, "I consider good art that which destroys the 
last generation's hopes." 
</P>
<P>
Well, I consider "performance art" to be all performance and no art, unless 
gaining attention and publicity is an art. If so, "Gabor and the Cop" is the 
highest example to date. 
</P>
<P>
It is what those do who have mastered no art whatsoever.

IMPERFECT FANTASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the beginning I was captivated by the auditory and visual experience of 
"Fantasia." I could imagine a kindly and wise Uncle Walt, orchestrating his 
vision of a world where music and life supersede all other petty concerns. 
</P>
<P>
This pleasant mood was shattered by a thunderbolt about two-thirds into the 
film when, in a pastoral scene set to Beethoven's Sixth Symphony, I briefly 
glimpsed two zebra-striped, brown-skinned female centaurs serving a fat little 
Caucasian cherub as if they were his slaves. They never joined the party. In 
fact, they were present for no more than three seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Before this instance I had regarded the other centaurs, enjoying their 
courtship rituals, as non-racial pink, blue, orange and green. However, after 
this moment the vision became a white folks' party with blacks -- or 
brown-skinned centaurs with clearly African zebra bodies -- present only to 
serve. 
</P>
<P>
Was this Disney's vision of Utopia? I don't think a black person, or a centaur 
of African descent, could be happy there. 
</P>
<P>
From that point on the film lost all of its magic. Those tiny two or three 
seconds completely decolorized the film, making it a very worldly black and 
white.

According to Charles Solomon, who wrote "It Wasn't Always Magic," an Oct. 7 
article on "Fantasia": In the original version the two Nubian/zebra 
centaurettes who attend Bacchus in the Pastoral Symphony sequence appeared on 
screen somewhat longer and, later, a black centaurette called Sunflower buffed 
the hooves of the other centaurettes. All of Sunflower's scenes have been 
excised in recent reissues to avoid offending modern sensibilities. The 
presence of Bacchus' attendants has been cut to a minimum; removing their 
entrance entirely would have damaged the storyline.

AMATEURS CRACKED CODES TO HELP WIN WW II 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifty years ago -- and more than a year before Pearl Harbor -- Americans scored 
one of their most brilliant victories of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The commander was a Russian immigrant and sometime geneticist named William 
Frederick Friedman. The nature of the battle might be suggested by Friedman's 
intense interest once in the 50,000-word novel "Gadsby," which Ernest Vincent 
Wrigh wrote without using the letter "e." Friedman's troops were a motley 
assemblage of academics, math wizards and puzzle freaks. With a left-handed 
assist from William Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
Together, after 18 baffling months of dead-end days and floor-walking nights 
that temporarily collapsed Friedman into a mental ward, they broke the Japanese 
diplomatic code. 
</P>
<P>
Their collective genius did not foil, of course, the sneak Japanese attack on 
Pearl Harbor that brought the United States actively into the war. Crossed and 
sometimes disconnected wires in American intelligence enabled that. But code 
breaking by Friedman, et al., laid the groundwork for the pivotal victory of 
the U.S. fleet at Midway in June, 1942. Indeed, code breaking was an essential 
ingredient of the Allies' ultimate triumph. 
</P>
<P>
Let us begin the tale with John Quincy Adams. As secretary of state in 
1817-1825 he hired the first U.S. code clerk. Code breaking and/or making was 
not a pressing concern at the State Department for years, not even when Herbert 
O. Yardley, 24, signed on as a $17.50-a-week code clerk in 1913. 
</P>
<P>
Yardley had been an indifferent student back in Indiana but had a flair for 
math. Today he would be a computer hacker. Back then he was a Morse code 
hacker. And, at State, bored. So bored he began cracking incoming code traffic. 
He deciphered a message to President Woodrow Wilson from his top aide, Col. 
Edward M. House, in but two hours. He joined Army intelligence in World War I 
as a lieutenant and cryptographer. 
</P>
<P>
The Army had another such lieutenant, Friedman. He had been born near Odessa, 
Russia, in 1891, was brought to America by his postal worker father to escape 
anti-Jewish rioting and eventually graduated from Cornell University as a 
geneticist. 
</P>
<P>
As Friedman was settling into a postgraduate career of fruit flies and 
Mendelian imperatives, a letter arrived at Cornell. It came from George Fabyan, 
a wealthy cotton broker and world-class eccentric who was looking for a 
"would-be-er, not an as-is-er" geneticist to help improve the flora and fauna 
on the farm at his Riverbank Laboratories outside Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The colonel, who kept a pet gorilla and drove about in a carriage drawn by two 
zebras, had another, non-mammalian passion: to prove that Sir Francis Bacon and 
not Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare. He had only to decipher the code he believed 
Sir Francis had encrypted in "Troilus and Cressida" to prove Bacon's authorship 
and thereafter bask in the world's acclaim. His code breaker was a similarly 
convinced proper Bostonian, Elizabeth Wells Gallup. She in turn hired an 
assistant, Elizebeth (her mother spelled it without an "a" so no one would call 
her daughter Eliza) Smith. 
</P>
<P>
When Friedman arrived at Riverbank in 1915, he brought with him an interest in 
photography. Gallup asked him to photograph some Shakespeare folios. He 
thereupon became fascinated with a) Smith and b) cryptanalysis (a word he 
coined) and married both for life. 
</P>
<P>
"When it came to cryptology, something in me found an outlet," he was to say. 
"Just an inherent curiosity to know what people were trying to write that they 
didn't want other people to read." 
</P>
<P>
While Sir Francis' hidden messages kept eluding Gallup, the Army began sending 
cryptograms and coded messages to Riverbank for deciphering. Friedman broke 
one, keyed from a book, without even knowing what the book was. Impressed, the 
Army enlisted him into its primitive code apparatus when World War I broke out. 
</P>
<P>
After the war, Friedman, convinced that Fabyan was rather an oddball, 
nonetheless reluctantly returned to Riverbank. The Army sent out a ciphered 
message it considered absolutely undecipherable. Friedman cracked it and sent 
back a letter to Washington in the same cipher. The Army hired him in 1921 to 
work up its codes. Elizebeth Friedman eventually worked for the Coast Guard, 
cracking codes of Prohibition rumrunners. And her husband wrote some seminal 
works on cryptology. 
</P>
<P>
Yardley, meanwhile, had been set up in secret in mid-town Manhattan with Army 
and State Department slush funds to run a code breaking operation he called the 
Black Chamber. His first coup was to crack the codes the Japanese delegation 
was using at the 1921 Washington Naval conference to limit construction of 
capital ships. 
</P>
<P>
Not to be outdone, the Navy in 1924 appointed Lt. Laurence F. Safford to head a 
new Research Desk in the Code and Signal Section. In the finest tradition of 
interservice rivalry, Safford's unit in Room 2646 of the Navy Building never 
communicated what it was doing to the Army Building next door on Constitution 
Avenue in Washington. Lack of communication among communications spies was to 
remain a problem all along the road to Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
It did slowly change, however, in the face of a technological revolution: 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
Radio direction finding -- pinpointing the source and destinations of coded 
messages through triangulation by eavesdropping receivers -- had entered the 
arsenal of modern warfare. 
</P>
<P>
In 1925, the Navy began installing radio monitors at Guam, the Philippines and 
Shanghai. Two years later, the U.S. cruiser Marblehead, porcupined with 
antennae, shadowed the Japanese fleet maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
Less visible sailors with civilian safecrackers stole code books from Japanese 
consulates, even in Washington where the party-loving naval attache, Lt. Cmdr. 
Kiyoshi Hasegawa, dallied with a lady agent while his safe was rifled. The 
results were deciphered with the assistance of Dr. and Mrs. Emerson J. Haworth, 
he a former Quaker missionary and professor at Tokyo University. 
</P>
<P>
Code breaking had become an intense activity, so much so that Yardley's Black 
Chamber had broken the codes of 19 nations by the time Henry L. Stimson became 
Herbert Hoover's secretary of state in 1928. By then State was financing 
Yardley exclusively. Stimson, a jewel in the high hat of the Old School, was 
aghast. A dedicated peacemaker, he said: "The way to make men trustworthy is to 
trust them." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Japanese militarists were already clashing with Chiang Kai-shek's 
soldiers in China and were murdering dovish ministers at home, Stimson closed 
down the Black Chamber with one of the most famous quotes in all cryptography: 
"Gentlemen do not read each other's mail." 
</P>
<P>
In reaction, the Army created a new Signal Intelligence Service under Friedman 
(who by oversight never got a security clearance) with a staff of six to 
prepare codes, locate enemy radio stations and break ciphers. And Friedman 
began talking with Safford. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, an angry Yardley told all in a 1931 best-seller, "America's Black 
Chamber." His book was his last, greatest and wholly unintended gift to 
American cryptology. It persuaded the Japanese to start using encrypting 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
These were nothing new. Thomas Jefferson had invented one. His had wheels which 
turned in a sequence so that a, for instance, went in one end and came out z at 
the other. The key to deciphering was to find the key to the encipherment, the 
system used to turn the wheels. Introducing electricity over a century later 
meant the wheels could turn infinitely faster producing millions of possible 
combinations. 
</P>
<P>
Yet a basic of decipherment remained: The frequency letters appear in a given 
language. The letter e is the most common in English, hence Friedman's 
absorption with an e-less novel. 
</P>
<P>
An electrical enciphering machine named Enigma was sold for commercial users in 
Germany after the first war. In 1927, the Army Signal Corps bought one for 
$144. It became the Nazis' Achilles heel throughout World War II. They 
complacently believed Enigma unbreakable. The British, with the help of some 
brilliant Poles, cracked it, giving the Allies a fateful advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese had the same confidence in 97-shiki O-bun Injiki -- Alphabetical 
Typewriter 97. The Americans called the machine Purple after a color in the 
spectrum. They had already broken a Japanese machine they called Red. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy had cracked Red with the help of an accommodating woman provided by 
the Office of Naval Intelligence who tarried in bed with Lt. Toshikazu Ohmae 
while agents rifled his briefcase. Then, a much more sophisticated machine, 
Purple, began to be intercepted by the Navy's listening radios. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Jinsaburo Ito of the Japanese Navy had developed No. 97. "Let America and 
Britain solve this cipher if they can," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman's staff of 19 code breakers was given the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Code breakers, to say the least, do not come in tidy packages. Winston 
Churchill was to say of the grab bag of geniuses who cracked Enigma: "I told 
you to leave no stone unturned in your recruiting. I did not expect you to take 
me so literally." 
</P>
<P>
America's cryptographers included stamp collectors, chess masters, a naval 
officer who accepted a tennis date knowing nothing of the game but learned it 
overnight from a book and Agnes Meyer Driscoll, who was a devotee of cryptic 
puzzles and taught many the tricks of the trade. And Friedman, a golfing family 
man with an alert, kindly face who could see patterns where others saw only 
chaos. 
</P>
<P>
The small, parochial world of cryptography of the 1930s exchanged enciphered 
Christmas cards, held round-robin restaurant parties at which guests had to 
solve a cryptogram at the appetizer eatery to tell them where to go for the 
fish course. Purple, in a world edging toward war, was something else. 
</P>
<P>
Purple was for use only in the major Japanese embassies. On Feb. 18, 1939, 
Tokyo signaled these outposts Purple was going on line. It made the fatal error 
of sending parallel messages on the Red machine to lesser consulates. Comparing 
the two, Friedman's crew decrypted 25% of the cipher in a few weeks. 
Thereafter: a brick wall. 
</P>
<P>
Little steps, nonetheless, could be taken. The Japanese, a formal people, stick 
to proper and unvarying ways of address. Diplomatic messages, encoded, could be 
compared with the same messages when delivered to American diplomats in 
translation -- if they were the same messages. Messages sent in Red were 
compared with Purple intercepts made about the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Night after night, Elizebeth Friedman, who could not be told why, could hear 
her husband pacing back and forth in their kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, this was a collaborative, cooperative effort," William Friedman 
later said. "No one person was responsible for the solution." 
</P>
<P>
There were Safford's people who kept up a steady flow of radio intercepts. 
Japanese diplomacy sometimes came via American commercial cable companies 
instead of by radio. Rights to privacy notwithstanding, cable managers would 
pass on copies and times of transmission. (But the scrupulous cable managers in 
Honolulu did not give the FBI copies of Japanese messages, some of which were 
Pearl Harbor spy reports, until a week before the attack.) 
</P>
<P>
Then, sometime in August of 1940, Harry Laurence Clark, one of Friedman's young 
cryptographers, had an insight that came to him in the night. He came to work 
the next day ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder if the monkeys did it that way?" he is quoted by Friedman's 
biographer, Ronald Clark. "That way" was to use telephone stepping switches in 
the Purple machine, not electric wheels. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman's crew began scrounging switches from telephone companies, even 
five-and-dime stores. By guess and by God and by genius and by inspired 
calculation they began piecing together a copy of the machine none of them had 
ever seen or ever would see and which was talking in a language few of them 
knew. 
</P>
<P>
It buzzed and sparked and wasn't lovely, but on Sept. 25, 1940, America's 
Purple machine decoded its first full message. Washington, again, could read 
Tokyo's hand. 
</P>
<P>
As the Japanese Empire inexorably collapsed in on itself in flames, Purple 
machines were smashed into bits as embassies closed, garrisons surrendered or, 
more often, fought to the last man. One machine, partially intact, was captured 
on Guam. Of its hundreds of wired connections, only two were different from the 
sight-unseen Purple machines of William F. Friedman and his crew. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the war was over, the Japanese refused to believe what the Americans 
had done. No, they said, they must have stolen a Purple machine somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
They had. Out of the air.

<P>
If the Americans were reading Japan's Purple code, how come Pearl Harbor? 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Wohlestetter, in her detailed book about events preceding the attack on 
Dec. 7, 1941, gives perhaps the most succinct answer: 
</P>
<P>
"The signals lay scattered in a number of different agencies. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Purple, the highest Japanese diplomatic code, warned that war was imminent but 
did not disclose where it would begin. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Navy determined, using radio direction finders, that Japanese ships 
were heading toward Indochina and Malaya. Since there was no traffic to the 
Japanese aircraft carriers, it was assumed that they were in home waters. It 
was a deadly error. 
</P>
<P>
A few Americans suggested that it could mean the carriers were steaming toward 
Pearl Harbor or the West Coast under radio silence. One was Col. Rufus Bratton, 
chief of the Far Eastern Section of the Army Military Intelligence Division. 
</P>
<P>
His Navy counterpart, Cmdr. Arthur H. McCollum, spoke for himself and many 
others when he told Bratton: "They (the Japanese) know as well as you and I 
that the fleet would not just be sitting there (in Pearl Harbor) waiting to be 
attacked." 
</P>
<P>
Yet between Nov. 15 and Dec. 6, 1941, 49 espionage messages between Honolulu 
and Tokyo had given the precise locations of ships at the naval base and 
whether they were guarded by torpedo nets. Although 18 of those messages were 
intercepted, only three had been processed by the time of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Navy code breakers assigned low priority to messages at the consulate, where 
the Honolulu spies were based. Diplomats, it was assumed, were inferior spy 
material. 
</P>
<P>
Washington code breakers, for instance, did not relay to Honolulu a decoded 
message from the consulate there that divided the harbor into a map-like grid. 
That, said Rear Adm. Edwin T. Layton, Pacific Fleet intelligence officer at the 
time, was "blind stupidity at least, gross neglect at best."

MEXICO ARCHEOLOGICAL DIG YIELDS 1ST-EVER CARVING OF DECORATIONS ON CHILD'S 
TEETH 
</P>

CIUDAD VICTORIA, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Archeologists say the tombs of a mysterious city have yielded the first example 
of the use on children of an ancient art: carving or engraving teeth as a sign 
of beauty. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence of the engraving was discovered on the teeth of a boy's skeleton found 
in the ruins of Montezuma's Balcony, where civilization was far more advanced 
than any previously thought to exist in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Montezuma's Balcony is 310 miles north of Mexico City outside Ciudad Victoria, 
capital of northeastern Tamaulipas state. Its name is derived from that of 
Moctezuma, the Aztec king. 
</P>
<P>
Tamaulipas, which spent more than $53,000 on the project, plans to open the 
site to the public this year. 
</P>
<P>
Two canyons and a mountain surround the remote, 12-acre city. It is reached by 
a steep, rocky road that veers two miles off the main highway to 86 huge slabs 
of stone named the "grand stairway." 
</P>
<P>
Only from the top of the stairway can the remains of more than 100 circular 
structures be seen, each up to 50 feet in diameter, built from stacked and 
fitted rocks. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 skeletons were found in basements, along with ceramic fragments, 
food-grinding utensils, pipes, necklaces, arrowheads, knives and small 
figurines. 
</P>
<P>
The remains of the boy, no older than 5, showed evidence of the carving, called 
dental mutilation, in his two upper incisors and one lower incisor. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very rare find," said Jesus Narez, director of the Montezuma's 
Balcony restoration project. "Until now, we have never detected dental 
mutilations in a person this young." 
</P>
<P>
In primitive cultures, dental mutilation was believed to be practiced only on 
adults. It still is done in some Brazilian, Indonesian and African communities. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it hurts a lot, but . . . peyote, which was commonly used in those 
times, was probably used to put the child to sleep or dull the pain," Narez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Several other things make Montezuma's Balcony unique, said Narez, 
curator-investigator of the architectural and cultural collections of northern 
Mexico at the National Museum of Anthropology and History in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
He said two groups of people lived there: the Grassiles, thin and fine 
featured, and the Robustus, big-boned and heavy. Archeologists chose the names. 
</P>
<P>
"At least for now, we think they lived there together, but radiocarbon testing 
is being done to determine if they were there at the same time or if one group 
followed the other," Narez said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Narez, the city's 3,000 people probably lived between the years 
600 and 1400. The elite occupied the structures and were buried in their 
basements, and the others lived in wooden huts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
References to Montezuma's Balcony appeared in a researcher's report in the 
mid-1800s, and there was another report in the 1940s. Work on the site began in 
1988 and was completed in August. 
</P>
<P>
Although their culture achieved more than others in the area, the Montezuma's 
Balcony residents were not as advanced as the Teotihuacans, Zapotecs or Mayas 
of southern Mexico, who built pyramids and cities in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
Northern tribes such as the Huastecas and the warrior-like Chichimecas led more 
primitive, simpler lives than the people of Montezuma's Balcony, Narez said. 
</P>
<P>
"We never thought we'd find these types of buildings so far north," he said, 
adding that huge pieces of rock used to build the structures were moved with 
the aid of planks and rope.

EASTERN EUROPEANS FLOCK TO TAIZE, RELIGIOUS RETREAT NESTLED IN FRANCE 
</P>

TAIZE, France 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vladimir Lubaschevsky and his wife, Natalia, traveled three days by train from 
Moscow to reach a new world of "love and freedom" in Taize. 
</P>
<P>
"We have found here quite another life," the 38-year-old engineer said shyly, 
clutching a dog-eared Bible in one hand and Natalia's elbow in the other. "It 
is fantastic for us." 
</P>
<P>
It is a dramatic contrast: the officially atheist Soviet Union, where they 
share a bleak apartment with his mother, and this liberal religious community 
nestled in the hills of Burgundy, about 230 miles southeast of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
The Lubaschevskys are among tens of thousands of newly free East Europeans 
descending this year on Taize, a cross between summer camp and ecumenical 
seminary. 
</P>
<P>
Taize observed its 50th birthday Sept. 1 and Cardinal Albert Decourtray of Lyon 
conducted a special service. 
</P>
<P>
For many people who live here, the arrival of the East Europeans is a greater 
event than the anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very moving to know what some of them have come through," said Brother 
John, a 38-year-old American. "Here, you're a Christian and it's no big deal. 
In East Germany, it meant a guy had to give up his job." 
</P>
<P>
Taize is a fraternity of 90 monks, most of them clad in sandals and slacks, who 
hope to reconcile the human family and overcome divisions among Christians 
through common prayer. 
</P>
<P>
Their ideas are a powerful beacon that draws more than 100,000 visitors a year 
to share prayer, discussion, song and silence. 
</P>
<P>
Brother Roger, 75, founded the community during World War II and still leads 
it. 
</P>
<P>
He is a Swiss Protestant, a mystic who loves Bach and tea, and likes his 
Christianity simple. He will cross out whole sections of a text by St. 
Augustine to make the essential message easier to grasp. 
</P>
<P>
"John XXIII was the Pope who understood us the best," said Brother Roger, who 
has known them all since Pius XII. "He was a man of great simplicity and 
sensitivity." 
</P>
<P>
Both are embodied in Taize. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors sleep in tents. Three times a day, they sit on all-weather carpet in 
the Church of Reconciliation to pray. In a region known for wine, tripe sausage 
and escargot, they eat green beans and pears. 
</P>
<P>
The monks keep an open ear to anxieties, hoping to turn individual suffering 
into compassion. 
</P>
<P>
"The brothers offer us a chance to take part in their prayers, their work, 
which is very important to me," said Andrea Hegedus, 25, of Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
"This would have been expropriated by the communists" in Eastern Europe, she 
said, because "coming together was a privilege held by the party." 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 2 million pilgrims have visited Taize in its half-century, 
including Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa and Pope John XXIII. 
Pope John Paul II visited as cardinal of Krakow in 1968 and pontiff in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Most visitors are aged 17-25, recognizable by backpacks and faded jeans. Some 
hitchhike and others arrive at the tiny railroad station. Shuttle buses run 
from several Polish cities. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Tyminska, 16, arrived on a bus from Czem with 40 other teen-agers. Some 
immediately tried to hitch rides to Paris, but Mary stayed behind. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is so happy here," she said. "They treat you like brothers or 
sisters." 
</P>
<P>
In 1940, Roger Schuutz pedaled his bicycle from Switzerland into unoccupied 
France and bought a run-down house in Taize as the home for what he envisioned 
as a simple community of monks dedicated to prayer and meditation. 
</P>
<P>
Then as now, Taize was affiliated with no church and did not accept donations. 
Brother Roger refused his inheritance, following the example of his mother, who 
refused too. 
</P>
<P>
The monks support themselves with a crafts shop, where they sell articles they 
make. Visitors pay for meals and sleeping space in a tent. 
</P>
<P>
In 1942, the Gestapo chased Brother Roger to Geneva after learning he had 
helped Jews escape France. He returned after the Allied invasion and conducted 
services for German prisoners of war in the 13th-Century village church. 
</P>
<P>
Young people started coming to Taize in the late 1950s. The brothers built a 
spacious, modern church to hold them. The annual pilgrimage grew to 100,000 in 
the 1970 and the brothers expanded the church's capacity with circus tents. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't ever want it," Brother Roger said, but his monks adapted, organizing 
food and lodging for their guests and composing multilingual chants to break 
down language barriers. 
</P>
<P>
Some brothers now live part of the year in North and South America, Africa and 
Asia to expand contact between Christians. 
</P>
<P>
"We first started making contacts in Eastern Europe in 1962, when we had a 
German brother who said we must go there to express our humanity," said Brother 
Emile, a Canadian. 
</P>
<P>
The revolution in Eastern Europe means many who dreamed of visiting Taize can 
do so. More than half the pilgrims this year are from the region. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, we feel a unity in faith and being together," Lubaschevsky said. "Here, 
it is approved to have more love and freedom than we ever had before."

FOREIGN TV PROGRAMS INVADE HOMES IN ASIA

<TEXT>
<P>
Asian governments that want to control what their people see on television are 
fighting a losing battle with satellites and receiving dishes. 
</P>
<P>
Direct broadcasts from foreign countries into private homes via satellite are 
spreading rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials fret over the impact on their people's values and way of life. 
Western diplomats say others fear that their social and political control might 
be questioned if citizens have wider freedom of choice. 
</P>
<P>
Ever smaller and cheaper receiving dishes and the launch of a major 
telecommunications satellite make it increasingly difficult for governments to 
deny viewers direct access to foreign television. 
</P>
<P>
"We may not be able to check foreign TV intrusion into our lives for much 
longer," Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore said in 1988, but he has done 
a pretty good job so far. 
</P>
<P>
The only known satellite-reception dish not in his government's hands that is 
capable of receiving foreign programs sits on the roof of the U.S. Embassy. 
Installation was permitted "strictly for embassy use" two years after an 
application was filed. 
</P>
<P>
Others in this prosperous city-state are prohibited by law from owning or 
selling such dishes, except for export. Foreign programs for the three 
Singapore Broadcasting Corp. channels are screened to "filter out unacceptable 
and harmful values and lifestyles," said communications official Mah Bow Tan. 
</P>
<P>
One official said full access to foreign TV shows, permissive American 
offerings especially, could harm a young nation composed of different races, 
religions and cultures. He said censorship of foreign movies, magazines and TV 
was necessary to repel cultural subversion. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees. Lim Boon Heng, a member of Parliament, said the government 
should consider broadcasting to the surrounding region by satellite and stop 
trying to control the use of receiving dishes. 
</P>
<P>
Compact new receivers are small enough to fit into a suitcase, and Lim said: 
"When dishes get to that size, the authorities will have a hard time to control 
the use of satellite receivers . . . so why fight it?" 
</P>
<P>
A major enemy in this information war is positioned slightly to the east and 
22,753 miles up. AsiaSat-1 was launched from China in April by a Long March III 
rocket and is in orbit near the Equator. 
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications satellites are not new to the region. Indonesia was the 
first country in Asia and third in the world, after Canada and the United 
States, to have a domestic satellite. Japan and Australia also have 
communications satellites. 
</P>
<P>
AsiaSat-1, the first privately owned satellite, has the potential to beam 
signals to and from the Middle East, Singapore and Tokyo, and could offer a 
dozen new channels to an area with more than 2 billion potential viewers. The 
owner is a consortium led by Hutchison Whampoa (Holdings) Ltd. and based in 
Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia alone, where reception from the government's Palapa series of 
satellites was established in 1976, an estimated 25,000 dishes can pick up 
AsiaSat-1. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong officials announced in early August that individuals could own and 
operate dishes for personal use without licenses, lifting a ban that had been 
widely ignored for years. Broadcasters and operators of dishes that serve more 
than one viewer must have licenses. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the picture is equally mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Satellite dishes are legal in the Philippines upon approval of an application, 
but few applications are approved. Those who can afford it put them up anyway, 
apparently assuming the government has more important rules to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
Direct reception of satellite television still is forbidden in Thailand, which 
maintains close control over telecommunications, but pressure against the 
policy is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot stop technologies from growing," Joompol Rodcumdee of Chulalongkorn 
University in Thailand told a regional seminar on the socioeconomic impact of 
broadcast satellites. 
</P>
<P>
"Today we may say we will not use them, but tomorrow we may not be able to get 
away from them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Vijay Menon, secretary-general of the Asian Mass Communication Research and 
Information Center, said the estimated 150,000 satellite dishes in South Korea 
are "not viewed as a blessing or even as a sign of progress." 
</P>
<P>
"Journalism professors have been filling local newspapers with letters 
denouncing the impact of foreign TV on Korean society," he said. "Foreign 
programs, they feel, are making viewers in Korea adopt alien ways of thinking, 
life and customs and deepening the dependency of Korea on alien culture." 
</P>
<P>
Malaysia bans private satellites for direct TV reception, and Madzhi Johari of 
the government broadcast training institute said: "Direct access to 
broadcasting satellites means direct import of norms and values of the 
developed countries and will result in stress and conflict in our society." 
Indonesians seem relaxed about the impact of numerous private dishes.

BLUES SCHOOL GIVES LESSONS IN ATTITUDE WITH ITS MUSIC

<TEXT>
<P>
All you need to know to get into the Chicago Blues Ensemble is how to pluck out 
a couple of chords and sing in the shower. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of an eight-week course, students are transformed into toe-tapping, 
hard-playing blues performers with dark glasses and a new attitude. They are 
ready for their final exam -- in a local bar. 
</P>
<P>
"Blues is the people's music," said Jon Spiegel, one of the ensemble's 
directors. "If you can plant the seed of obsession, then it's really great. 
After that, you just stand back and steer." 
</P>
<P>
Some students bring in violins or dulcimers, but most favor guitars, pianos, 
basses and harmonicas. Everybody has to sing a solo before they are through, 
and the lessons teach more than music, Spiegel said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see the change in the students," he said. "They first come in wearing 
Oxford shirts, and by the end of the eight weeks they're wearing sharkskin 
suits and wide ties." 
</P>
<P>
The program is offered by the Old Town School of Folk Music. Typically, about 
45 students of varying experience levels work in small groups. Most take music 
lessons during the week and meet each Wednesday to apply the theories they have 
learned. 
</P>
<P>
"You get a lot out of playing with other people of all levels and from all 
walks of life," said George Minkel. "I've been a closet player for years. So 
this is wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Directors help students develop the best group sound, while focusing on the 
emotional extremes that are the root of the blues, Spiegel said. 
</P>
<P>
"Play an angry note," Spiegel told a bass player during one of the Wednesday 
night sessions. The student answered with a screeching sound that bounced off 
the walls and echoed through the room. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, play one that's real sublime," Spiegel said. The responding tone wafted 
mellowly around the room. 
</P>
<P>
The group then played a rendition of the blues standard "Crossroads," with Rich 
Yeater, a mild-mannered computer consultant, pounding the piano keys and 
belting out the lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time I've done this," he said. "It's exciting, very different 
and a lot of fun. Playing with a group forces you to be more disciplined." 
</P>
<P>
Final exams take place in a local bar where the groups take the stage during an 
open microphone night. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing about this class is that, while they probably won't be the best 
group up there, they definitely won't be the worst," Spiegel said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the ensemble groups go on to perform regularly, but few are willing to 
quit their day jobs for life in Chicago's smoky blues clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, the option's always open," said Kevin Hauser, a 35-year-old train 
conductor and guitar player. "I'll wait to see if the audience wants an encore 
after our first session."

WRITER RECALLS HOW TENNESSEE WILLIAMS BROUGHT WARMTH TO ICY VOYAGE

<TEXT>
<P>
Seven years have gone by since Broadway theaters dimmed their marquees at the 
death of Tennessee Williams, but his poetic genius burns brightly as ever along 
the Great White Way. 
</P>
<P>
This past season was illuminated by stunning revivals of "Cat On a Hot Tin 
Roof," starring Kathleen Turner, and "Orpheus Descending," with Vanessa 
Redgrave. 
</P>
<P>
Now "Five O'Clock Angel," his letters to Maria St. Just, the Russian emigre 
actress who held his quaking hand many an opening night and whose unquenchable 
vitality inspired Maggie the Cat, is stirring a kindlier look at this 
melancholy dreamer whose sad descent into alcohol, drugs and what he called his 
"deviant satyriasis" -- pathetic homosexual cruising -- led to the violent ward 
and threatened his co-billing with Eugene O'Neill as America's greatest 
playwright. 
</P>
<P>
Reading those touching, candid letters, I was reminded of my own chance meeting 
with Williams six months before the then Maria Britneva mistook for an 
understudy the "unassuming, vulnerable little man" in mismatched socks sitting 
alone on a sofa at a party in John Gielgud's London house. 
</P>
<P>
I encountered him on a ship, the SS America, which sailed from New York on 
Dec., 30, 1947, bound for Cobh, Ireland, Cherbourg, France, and Southampton, 
England, leaving behind the greatest recorded snowstorm in the city's history. 
On the day after Christmas, 25.8 inches had fallen in 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
I wasn't even a cub reporter then. I was a 22-year-old college senior and ex-GI 
on my way to Ireland to marry a farmer's daughter I met on the steps of a 
church in Hochst, Germany, just after the war. 
</P>
<P>
The name Tennessee Williams appeared on the passenger list slipped under the 
door of the steerage class cabin, deep in the bowels of the ship, that I shared 
with three elderly strangers. Only one of them, a refugee piano craftsman from 
Hitler's Germany who was going back to hunt for a lost love in the rubble of 
Hamburg, had ever heard of the playwright. He encouraged my youthful, 
idolatrous whim to seek an audience with the occupant of the suite on the boat 
deck whose "A Streetcar Named Desire" had opened to thunderous applause and 20 
curtain calls just three weeks before. 
</P>
<P>
On a loose-leaf page from a lecture notebook, I begged an interview on behalf 
of the Marlboro College Citizen, a mimeographed campus publication that came 
out whenever English majors like me at that brand-new college in Vermont could 
be coaxed from the ski slopes. The surly cabin boy who finally answered the 
call bell seemed indifferent to the message entrusted to his care and even more 
unimpressed with the quarter I pressed into his palm. But in less than an hour 
down came an answer, inquiring "if 2 p.m. tomorrow would be convenient?" 
</P>
<P>
That was New Year's Eve. As the appointed hour approached, an assistant purser 
dangling an enormous set of keys passed me through the locked wooden gates, 
resembling rodeo corral dividers, leading from tourist class through the 
better-lit corridors of cabin class on up to the Art Deco splendor of first 
class. There a tiny elevator attended by a midget in a commodore's uniform made 
the final ascent to the boat deck. While I tried to review the questions I 
intended to ask, my gatekeeper prattled on about the two blue-ribbon steers 
from the Chicago livestock fair that would make their bow as beef Wellington at 
the captain's midnight gala ushering in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was the first celebrity I ever met, and still lingers in memory as the 
kindest. 
</P>
<P>
Although snow could be seen streaming past the porthole and the boat deck 
echoed with the clank of seamen scraping icicles from the lifeboat davits, the 
playwright was wearing a white Palm Beach suit, a flowered sports shirt and 
leather-thonged sandals over argyle socks that matched. As we shook hands, a 
waiter arrived with champagne in a silver bucket and an enormous tub of 
glistening black caviar. 
</P>
<P>
In the intervening four decades, no interview subject has shown such 
hospitality. Yet my host was touchingly apologetic. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope you don't find this too pretentious," he said in the soft Southern 
drawl that imprinted those opening words indelibly in memory, "but I just can't 
help living it up. Four years ago tonight, I was an usher at the Strand 
Theater, making $17 a week." 
</P>
<P>
With deep musical laughter punctuated by a hacking cough, he signed the bar 
chit and peeled off a $20 bill for the delighted steward. "Success is 
wonderful," he said, proffering a toast. "I wish you buckets of it. You are 
going to be a writer, aren't you, and not an English professor?" 
</P>
<P>
His anxious tone and the sudden narrowing of those clear blue eyes conveyed 
great compassion for budding authors but dark suspicion of future academics who 
might degenerate into critics. 
</P>
<P>
The first sentence I managed to blurt out bragged of a recent acceptance slip 
from Ellery Queen's magazine. He told of his delight at the sale of his first 
short story to a horror magazine for $15. 
</P>
<P>
I don't recall if he was shy or blushed easily, as Maria St. Just remembered 
their first meeting. I just know I was shyer. I stammered terribly in those 
days, much worse than now. I remember most his patience and sensitivity in 
never trying to supply the words my saliva-sputtering lips were trembling to 
bite out. Most stutterers prefer defeat to rescue. 
</P>
<P>
Success came late to Williams. He was then a few months shy of his 37th 
birthday. He spoke sadly, almost resentfully, of the long time it took him to 
gain a college degree -- nine years, as I recall -- but relished with boyish 
enthusiasm almost every detail of his two Broadway smash successes. Soon he 
would be in London, arranging the opening of "The Glass Menagerie" and "perhaps 
a Stockholm production too." This seemed to amaze him. 
</P>
<P>
The cabin steward arriving with fresh towels was invited to join me in 
inspecting the array of bon voyage telegrams plastered on his dresser mirror, 
and his "Christmas toys," good luck charms treasured from the Dec. 3 opening 
night party for "A Streetcar Named Desire." 
</P>
<P>
"That tiny trolley is from Marlon, and Jessica sent the Southern belle doll," 
he said, indicating the gifts from the show's stars, Marlon Brando and Jessica 
Tandy. 
</P>
<P>
The toy trolley reminded him that another streetcar named "Cemeteries" passed 
by his French Quarter apartment in New Orleans. "Quite appropriate," he said, 
more to himself in the mirror than to me. Suddenly his mood became grave and 
melancholy. 
</P>
<P>
He asked if I had read "The Glass Menagerie." I told him I had seen it with a 
free ticket from the Stagedoor Canteen on an Army furlough. 
</P>
<P>
"Then you saw the incomparable Laurette Taylor," he sighed, almost on the verge 
of tears. "I owe everything to her." He was still mourning the death over a 
year ago of the alcoholic has-been shunned for a decade by Broadway producers 
before bringing to luminous life Amanda Wingdale, alias Edwina Williams, 
Tennessee's dreamy, doting mother. 
</P>
<P>
Staring out the porthole, he murmured something about "Streetcar" being his 
last play, his "swan song." This didn't seem to make much sense, because I had 
read about another play, "Summer and Smoke," trying out at a 
theater-in-the-round in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Many years later, Gore Vidal, who became his friend on that European trip, told 
me Williams was convinced then, against all medical evidence, that he was dying 
of pancreatic cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Seven chiming bells in the passageway, signifying 3:30, abruptly dispelled his 
despondency. 
</P>
<P>
Soon he was laughing again and stroking his mustache at what even then must 
have been the sine qua non query of all Williams interviews: How did someone 
born in Columbus, Miss., raised in St. Louis and in love ever after with New 
Orleans, come to be called Tennessee? 
</P>
<P>
As he has explained so many times since, he was "merely indulging the old 
Southern weakness for going out on a limb of the family tree." Grandsires a 
couple of greats back on his father's side had been chancellor of the territory 
that became Tennessee and the state's first senator and governor. 
</P>
<P>
Next morning, the mood of the North Atlantic changed just as abruptly. Soft 
Grandma Moses snowflakes gave way to churning seas, flying spume beaded with 
ice and an eerie keening wind that made doors leading to the decks almost 
impossible to push open. 
</P>
<P>
Even on the calmest sea, the 33,500-ton SS America rolled relentlessly. No 
wonder in her wartime interlude as the troop transport West Point it had been 
chosen for "Operation Seasick," a controlled test of a new maritime palliative 
called Dramamine. 
</P>
<P>
Now the piano in the lounge had to be lashed down, and "fiddles" -- little 
wooden guard rails -- were raised on the tables in the nearly deserted dining 
salons to keep crockery and glassware from careening to bits. 
</P>
<P>
To escape the retching sounds and odors of my stricken mates in that airless 
inside cabin, I set about exploring the ship. I lurched and grabbed my way down 
endless staircases, past the engine room and the coiled anchor chain, to the 
swimming pool. The only one in the water, which rose and fell like a giant 
indoor wave, was Tennessee Williams. Doing sit-ups beside the pool were several 
young men whose sweat shirts identified them as members of the U.S. bobsled 
team, keeping in shape for the Winter Olympics at St. Moritz, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
Waving me over, the playwright climbed out, toweled off and groped through the 
pocket of his paisley robe for an envelope. It was an invitation for the 
following evening to his "delayed New Year's Party," which had to be delayed 
again because of the storm. 
</P>
<P>
When the gale finally subsided, my uniformed gatekeeper with the bandoleer of 
keys escorted me up to the first-class suite. Only a few guests, including the 
captain and the ship's doctor, who looked a bit queasy, gathered around the 
punch bowl. I remember a very pretty French girl whose father was a well-known 
Paris publisher and some members of a U.S. trade delegation who weren't sure 
who was our host. The Olympics were represented by Gus Lussi, the coach, and 
George Button, the father of figure skater Dick Button, who had caught the 
Queen Mary and would go on to win a gold medal at St. Moritz. 
</P>
<P>
Also there was a coquettish, aging actress in peroxide bangs who threatened to 
audition there and then for the role of Blanche DuBois. 
</P>
<P>
For once the shipboard conversation consisted of more than blizzard horror 
stories. There was much speculation about Henry Wallace's announced third-party 
bid for the presidency, which had just caught up with the ship's newspaper. 
Williams, who professed little interest in politics, spent most of the time 
handing around canapes and topping off drinks. Somehow he reminded me then of 
Jay Gatsby: quite the loneliest person at his own party. 
</P>
<P>
The last time I saw him, dawn was stage-lighting the green bluffs and gray 
storage sheds of Cork Harbor. Sea gulls were screaming around our twin 
smokestacks and the carillon of St. Colman's Cathedral was summoning the 
faithful to early Mass. Descending the gangplank to the tender taking departing 
passengers to the customs wharf, I heard a voice drawl down from the boat deck: 
</P>
<P>
"Blessings on your Irish bride." 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee Williams was alone at the rail, wearing the "good luck topcoat" he 
had bought on the strength of favorable notices for "Streetcar's" Philadelphia 
tryout.

IN NORWAY, GLACIERS ARE GROWING BIGGER

EVENTYRISEN, Norway 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glaciers in Norway have started to creep down from their mountain strongholds 
-- growing bigger in apparent defiance of global warming. 
</P>
<P>
One wall of ice, reclaiming ground uncovered for years, is slowly splintering 
its way through a forest. 
</P>
<P>
"This glacier is about 30 yards longer than it was last year," said Bjoern 
Andreas Ovesen, a guide on Eventyrisen, a glacier in southern Norway where huge 
chunks of ice are crawling down a barren valley. 
</P>
<P>
The glaciers are growing in size because more snow is falling on them and 
turning into ice, scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
Climatologists say pollution is driving up world temperatures, threatening to 
melt glaciers and the polar ice. This could raise the level of the oceans and 
flood low-lying coastal areas, they predict. 
</P>
<P>
But Prof. Olav Orheim, head of the Antarctic section at the Norwegian Polar 
Reseach Institute in Oslo, said theories of the so-called "greenhouse effect" 
had largely missed the side effects of higher temperatures -- such as more 
snow. 
</P>
<P>
"In western Norway, all small glaciers, which respond most quickly to climate 
changes, are now advancing," Orheim said. 
</P>
<P>
Global warming means not only that more ice melts in the summer, but also that 
more moisture is sucked up from the oceans and falls as rain or snow. Some 
parts of Norway have had record summer temperatures -- and record snowfalls. 
</P>
<P>
Norway's western glaciers are among the best monitored in the world. They have 
generally tended to shrink since the 18th Century but have begun to grow again 
in the last year or two. 
</P>
<P>
More snow dumped on glaciers could slow a current rise in sea levels of between 
one and two milimeters -- four-hundreths to eight-hundredths of an inch -- a 
year. But Orheim predicted that it is unlikely to go so far as to reverse the 
trend. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the Eventyrisen Glacier -- roped together for safety in case one 
slips into a crevasse -- hear muffled thuds and growls as the ice grinds 
downhill, moving on average about 3 inches a day. 
</P>
<P>
Eventyrisen, which means "fairy ice," is named after the weird shapes -- 
towers, bridges and pyramids -- formed by chunks of ice as the glacier crumples 
into a narrowing valley at an elevation of about 5,600 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors stare down deep, blue crevasses, while a pinkish algae grows on the 
surface. Dust blown onto the glacier every summer leaves dark lines sandwiched 
between the layers of ice built up in the winters. 
</P>
<P>
While Eventyrisen has grown in the last couple of years, it is several hundred 
yards short of where it was around 1930 and far smaller than it was in the 
so-called Little Ice Age of about 1750. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know if the (shrinking) trend has reversed in general, but in Norway 
there has been a remarkable rise in snowfalls in recent years," Orheim said. 
</P>
<P>
"On top of Jostedal Glacier, we've had more than 40 feet of snow, when the 
normal is about 15 feet." 
</P>
<P>
Jostedal is the biggest glacier in continental Europe. Nearby, the Supphelle 
Glacier is crushing a forest of 12-foot alder trees. 
</P>
<P>
But the pattern of more snow does not hold true all over Norway. 
</P>
<P>
In the east, where the 1994 Winter Olympics are to be staged, less snow than 
normal has fallen in recent years. In the south, higher temperatures mean more 
and more precipitation falls as rain. 
</P>
<P>
Only in recent years have scientists begun to measure the Antarctic ice, which 
accounts for 90% of the world's permanent ice on land and, as such, is most 
relevant to global warming. Other glaciers, mainly in Greenland, account for 
the rest. 
</P>
<P>
The vast expanse of Arctic ice floating around the North Pole does not pose a 
threat to sea levels -- even if it all melted, the oceans would not rise, 
Orheim said. 
</P>
<P>
To prove this, Orheim said, put a few ice cubes in a glass and fill it to the 
brim with water. Bet against anyone who thinks the water will spill when the 
ice jutting out melts. Ice is less dense than water so the level stays the 
same.

ZIMBABWE LEPERS REMEMBER PROTECTOR

MUTEMWA, Zimbabwe 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sitting on a carpet of jacaranda blossom, under a broad avenue of spreading 
trees in purple bloom, Thomas waves a bandaged arm stump across the Mutemwa 
leper colony to point out his home. 
</P>
<P>
Behind him, atop a steep granite mountain, is a tiny cross on the skyline, a 
memorial to the man whose legacy this is, a murder victim who some say should 
become Zimbabwe's first saint. 
</P>
<P>
Brother John Bradburne of the Roman Catholic Franciscan order transformed 
Mutemwa in the 1970s from a barbaric isolation camp of sack-clad lepers, 
identified by numbers hanging round their necks, into a calm oasis of clean and 
effective medical care. 
</P>
<P>
In the words of Father John Dove, who took over the center after Bradburne was 
slain in 1979, the Franciscan brother was "the eyes of the blind, the hands of 
the fingerless and the feet of those who could not walk." 
</P>
<P>
His name has since been surrounded by legends and talk of miracles. Some of his 
Catholic brethren have asked for the former British army officer from Cumbria 
in northern England to be canonized. 
</P>
<P>
The cross on Chitoma Mountain was put up by an Englishman who recovered his 
sight after praying for Bradburne to intercede for him with God when he found 
he was going blind. 
</P>
<P>
"People around here still revere Bradburne," Mary Hardwick, who helps run the 
center, told Reuters. "There was a memorial service for him last year and so 
many people came to pay their respects that a whole crowd had to stand outside 
the church." 
</P>
<P>
Bradburne carried on treating Thomas and his fellow patients after Mutemwa's 
governing committee fired him in 1973, after four years, for refusing to hang 
numbers around the lepers' necks. 
</P>
<P>
The heavily-bearded Englishman moved to a tin hut on the mountainside 
overlooking Mutemwa but every night until his death he slipped down the hill to 
dress his patients' wounds by firelight, Hardwick said. 
</P>
<P>
Respected by the lepers but unpopular with local people, Bradburne died at the 
height of a bush war for independence in what was then the British colony of 
Rhodesia. 
</P>
<P>
Denounced to black guerrillas fighting in the bush as an informer because he 
kept a radio in his tin hut, he was marched off for a summary trial in 
September, 1979, released by the guerrilla leader but shot on his way home. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas has been around the longest of the 60 patients who live at this trim 
village of terra-cotta houses around a smart modern clinic, which was funded by 
the Zimbabwe government and by Catholic donations from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first came for treatment, it was 1939 and this place was still being 
built," he said. "They treated me across the valley and discharged me, but I 
had to come back again later to this new place when it (the leprosy) got 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
Hardwick said Thomas was so fiercely independent that he came to the clinic 
only to have sores treated. With no hands or feet, he still manages to farm a 
vegetable plot and tend his chickens and doves. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, patients at the center are given a weekly package of groceries and 
about $2 a month for spending money. If they work around the clinic, they can 
earn up to $15 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Those who want to can farm plots of land beside the center, not far from the 
Catholic, Anglican and Methodist churches that serve the little community. 
</P>
<P>
Former patients who want to be resettled away from Mutemwa have land found for 
them by the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture and Rural Resettlement. Mutemwa 
provides them with plows, tools, seeds and chickens to start a new life. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the patients at Mutemwa are "burned-out cases" who no longer have 
active leprosy but need frequent nursing when their numbed limbs become 
infected. About a quarter of them are from neighboring Zambia, Mozambique or 
Malawi. 
</P>
<P>
Only five are still being treated for leprosy, with a cocktail of drugs which 
must be taken for a year. Since the use of Dapsone, the main anti-leprosy drug, 
began on a large scale in Zimbabwe, the disease has been almost wiped out.

BANGLADESH AIMS TO HARVEST RIVERS, LAKES

DHAKA, Bangladesh 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Impoverished Bangladesh is trying to turn its killer rivers and lakes into a 
source of life-giving food for its millions of malnourished people. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials are pouring millions of hatchery-bred fish fry into the 
rivers, lakes and streams that characterize the crowded South Asian country. 
They hope to create an abundant supply of protein when the fish mature one to 
two years from now. 
</P>
<P>
The government of President Hussain Mohammed Ershad also is trying to persuade 
Bengalis to eat the tons of saltwater fish that now rot on the country's 
beaches or are thrown back into the ocean for lack of buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"Bengalis are known for their love of rice and fish," said Shameem Ahmed, a 
marine biologist. "Unfortunately, the rivers, canals, streams and swamps have 
become almost barren of fish. And our people are generally too poor to turn to 
beef or other sources of animal protein." 
</P>
<P>
Pollution from chemical fertilizers used in farming have depleted fish stocks 
in many of Bangladesh's rivers and ponds, environmentalists and government 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
While the country's population has swelled by 20 million over the last decade, 
its annual catch of fresh- and saltwater fish has been constant at about 
840,000 tons, government officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh produced a bumper rice crop of 19.5 million tons in the 1989-90 
fiscal year, just below its total requirement of 20 million tons and its 
highest output to date. The government hopes to become self-sufficient in rice 
by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
With the worry over growing enough rice to feed its hungry population seemingly 
under control, the government has turned its attention to securing an adequate 
source of protein. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of Bangladesh's 110 million people live below the international 
poverty line, crammed into an area the size of Wisconsin. Its per capita income 
in 1986 was estimated at $113 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Largely Muslim Bangladesh would seem to be a natural site for freshwater fish. 
It is largely a low plain cut by the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers and is laced 
with streams, lakes, canals and creeks -- the source of frequent fatal floods. 
</P>
<P>
But officials say that in addition to pollution a lack of modern cultivation 
techniques and the catching of fish fry let loose in streams and ponds before 
they mature have worsened the shortage of freshwater fish. 
</P>
<P>
"Absence of planned and scientific cultivation, increased water pollution and 
mass eating of fry are the main reasons for the poor availability of fish in 
Bangladesh," said an official of the Fisheries Directorate at the Ministry of 
Fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
Periodic droughts in the northern part of the country and poor transportation 
and refrigeration have also taken their toll. 
</P>
<P>
A recent government survey of ponds over an area of 367,000 acres showed that 
15% were barren and in disuse. 
</P>
<P>
Of those still being fished, only 5% employed modern cultivation techniques, 
while 80% relied on inefficient conventional methods, including monsoon 
flooding to replenish supplies of fish. 
</P>
<P>
Modern cultivation, which requires feeding and breeding of fish, is too costly 
for most fish farmers. The government plans to make loans to farmers from funds 
allocated by the World Bank and the International Development Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Government efforts to get people to eat more saltwater fish have met with 
strong resistance. Many Bengalis, accustomed to a diet of freshwater fish, 
believe eating ocean-caught fish will harm their health. 
</P>
<P>
"Hence, we have little choice but to stress increasing freshwater fish output," 
said Ministry of Fisheries official Abdul Ghani. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of tons of ocean fish are dumped back into the sea daily or rot on 
the beach because they cannot be sold. 
</P>
<P>
In September, newspapers reported huge piles of Hilsha fish, a prime catch from 
rivers during monsoon season, rotted in various regions of the country for lack 
of adequate transportation. 
</P>
<P>
"The irony is that canned fish smuggled from other countries now floods the 
country's supermarkets," one government official said.

A FRENCH EXPORT; 
</P>
<P>
COLLECTOR ADRIEN MAEGHT SAYS L.A.'S EMERGENCE AS A MAJOR ART CENTER LED HIM TO 
CHOOSE BEVERLY HILLS AS THE SITE FOR A U.S. BRANCH OF HIS PARIS GALLERY. 
</P>

<P>
A little of the Left Bank has opened on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
The new Benedicte Saxe Gallery in Beverly Hills is the first American branch of 
Maeght Graphics, the French art publisher whose Paris gallery became world 
famous for its posters and other graphics by Matisse and Miro, Calder and 
Chagall. 
</P>
<P>
At an opening soiree earlier this month, Adrien Maeght, the collector who heads 
the French art empire, and Benedicte Saxe talked about their decision to settle 
in Beverly Hills. It was a party that might have been in Paris -- except that 
hardly anybody smoked. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement that smoothed out the rough edges of his English, 
Maeght noted that the climate and landscape of Southern California are much 
like that of Southern France, where his parents opened first a lithography shop 
and later a gallery featuring the work of such friends as Miro, Kandinsky, 
Chagall and Leger. 
</P>
<P>
As the eldest son of a family of art collectors and patrons occasionally 
compared to the Medicis, Maeght grew up among artists as well as thousands of 
works of modern art. 
</P>
<P>
Between bonsoirs and hellos at the opening event, Maeght recalled that Pierre 
Bonnard helped him with his Latin homework as a child. Georges Braque was best 
man at his wedding. And a laughing Maeght attributed his imperfect command of 
English to a four-month stay in the United States in 1949. He spent most of the 
time with artist Hans Hofmann, then living in Provincetown, Mass., who grew up 
speaking German. 
</P>
<P>
As a businessman, Maeght said he chose Los Angeles over New York, in part, 
because the West Coast is so far from the firm's French operations. Serious 
East Coast collectors can fly to Paris to see what the Maeght Gallery, or the 
firm's new gallery for young artists near the Georges Pompidou Center, is 
offering. Even more important, Maeght said, was the recent emergence of Los 
Angeles as a major art center. "We thought it was the right time to come here." 
</P>
<P>
Saxe, who has worked with Maeght in France for a decade, agreed. Saxe said she 
had been coming to California for years, initially to visit relatives. She was 
increasingly impressed with the art scene but said she believed the local 
galleries had not yet caught up with the museums or the sophistication of 
American art patrons. 
</P>
<P>
"California museums are perfect," Saxe said. "Americans are perfect. But the 
galleries are not perfect." 
</P>
<P>
She told Maeght she was ready to "work for you, but alone" in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
In looking for gallery space, Saxe considered but rejected such hot spots as 
Santa Monica. Although Maeght continues to represent new artists, it has also 
come to be identified with the cutting edge of an earlier era. Saxe decided she 
didn't belong among the utterly contemporary galleries that seem to multiply 
daily in several Westside neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"If I sold young painters, I would have to be in Venice or on Colorado 
Boulevard," she said. "But now I am not avant-garde, I am classic." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Maeght's Paris galleries, which sell paintings as well as graphics, the 
Beverly Hills operation sells mostly lithographs, etchings, art books and other 
relatively affordable art graphics. New posters start at $20, but a visitor 
could also take home a 1976 Miro lithograph, "Contrebalancee," for $58,000. 
</P>
<P>
Saxe's rhetoric is populist, despite the presence in the gallery of two $30,000 
Braque plates. "Art graphics are for everyone," she said. In California, Maeght 
wants to cater to the person who loves art, not to the art speculator. "They 
want to sell to the passionate people, not to the millionaire," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But the passionate penniless don't pay the rent. Saxe said she chose Beverly 
Hills because it attracts browsers who have educated tastes and enough money to 
buy the lithograph, sometimes even the Braque plate, they fall in love with. 
</P>
<P>
"I need rich people, classic people, people who go to the theater, to the 
opera, who travel to Europe. I can't be far from them." 
</P>
<P>
The gallery is at 434 N. Bedford Drive, not on Rodeo Drive, which she rejected 
for aesthetic reasons and because of stratospheric rents. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' growing economic and cultural clout was a favorite topic at the 
opening. Californiaphiles with French accents were everywhere. Gerard Coste, 
the French consul in Los Angeles and himself a painter, pointed out that Maeght 
was one of several French institutions that had recently invested in the city. 
Christian Dior is another. 
</P>
<P>
"New York is decaying, and there is no other center in the world ready to take 
the challenge of New York," he said. "The European capitals of Paris, London, 
Rome are interesting but not powerful enough to take the challenge. Tokyo is 
very special, but they don't want to share their culture. I do believe Los 
Angeles is going to become the metropolis of the world."

ELECTIONS: CITY COUNCIL; 
</P>
<P>
RACE IS A CHOICE OF INDEPENDENTS, SLATES OR A MIX; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MONICA: WITH THE VOTING LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AWAY, NO CANDIDATE HAS 
EMERGED AS A CLEAR FRONT-RUNNER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Santa Monica voters may wish to treat the ballot as if it were a Chinese 
restaurant menu when they try to pick three candidates from the field of nine 
in the Nov. 6 City Council elections. 
</P>
<P>
Voters, for example, might choose the combination of the two-candidate slate of 
Kelly Olsen and Tony Vazquez, supported by Santa Monicans for Renters' Rights, 
the tenants' political group that rode into power on the back of rent control. 
</P>
<P>
Or they could back the three-candidate slate of incumbent Councilwoman 
Christine E. Reed, Donna Alvarez and Robert T. Holbrook, all former members of 
the now-defunct All-Santa Monica Coalition, which was formed in the early '80s 
to oppose SMRR candidates. 
</P>
<P>
They could try an a la carte approach and choose among the four independent 
candidates, Larry Jon Hobbs, Kathleen Schwallie, Jean Gebman and Sharon Gilpin 
-- although Schwallie and Gilpin are sometimes lumped together as two 
slow-growth candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Or voters can simply choose one from column A, one from column B and one from 
column C. 
</P>
<P>
"You can put together all the slates you want, but that doesn't mean people are 
going to vote that way," said Reed, who is seeking a fifth term on the council. 
"Santa Monica voters are liberal, independent-minded people who sort out the 
candidates from the issues. I think they look for balance in both the tickets 
and on the council." 
</P>
<P>
Some candidates and other observers of city politics say voters may be growing 
weary of slates. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are tired of slate politics," said Gilpin. "There is a feeling 
that the council is divided and members made to take sides." 
</P>
<P>
The city's police and fire unions have decided to take one candidate from each 
camp. In the past, the unions have endorsed Reed, but this year they snubbed 
her, primarily because contract talks with the city had been dragging on. 
Instead, they endorsed Olsen, Holbrook and Schwallie. 
</P>
<P>
There are other endorsements that have raised eyebrows. The Los Angeles League 
of Conservation Voters, for example, surprised some election observers by 
endorsing slow-growth candidates Gilpin and Schwallie, as well as Reed, whom 
both Gilpin and Schwallie have targeted for defeat because of her 
pro-development voting record. 
</P>
<P>
Because slate-splitting is likely to be common, the election is a difficult one 
to handicap. No candidate has emerged as a clear front-runner less than two 
weeks before the election. 
</P>
<P>
As the lone incumbent in the race, Reed has been the target of most of the 
criticism in the campaign, particularly in matters relating to development. 
Slow-growth candidates Schwallie and Gilpin have been quite vocal in their 
criticism of Reed, as have SMRR leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"Christine Reed has voted to approve more commercial development than any 
council member in the history of Santa Monica," said Mayor Dennis Zane, a 
member of the SMRR steering committee. 
</P>
<P>
Reed has attempted to play down her voting record on development by saying that 
some SMRR members on the council -- including Zane -- have joined her in 
supporting some of the projects for which she has been criticized. 
</P>
<P>
"There is definitely a burden in being the lone incumbent," said Reed, who was 
first elected in 1975. "You get blamed for everything that is wrong in the 
city." 
</P>
<P>
But she said the positives of being an incumbent outweigh the negatives. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always an advantage in terms of name recognition," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Following are brief profiles of each candidate, in the same order that they 
appear on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Robert T. Holbrook, 48, has been a member of the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified 
School District Board of Education since 1983. He is a lifelong Santa Monica 
resident and is on the faculty of the USC School of Pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
Holbrook said he is stepping down from the school board in part because his 
three children are all in college now and because the current City Council has 
done little to solve the problem of homelessness in the city. 
</P>
<P>
He has called for the creation of a Homeless Task Force to study and monitor 
homeless issues, but has joined others in blaming City Atty. Robert M. Myers' 
policy of not prosecuting homeless people for some misdemeanor crimes for 
aggravating the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to get tough on tough issues," said Holbrook, who has adopted the 
phrase as his campaign slogan. "If the city attorney doesn't want to enforce 
the laws of this city, then we should throw him out of office." 
</P>
<P>
Holbrook supports Proposition Y, which would change the city attorney's office 
from one appointed by the City Council to one elected by voters. 
</P>
<P>
In the landlord-tenant battle of dueling ballot measures, he comes down on the 
side of the landlords, endorsing Proposition U, which would allow rents on 
voluntarily vacated units to increase to market levels. He says landlords need 
that kind of financial relief as incentive not to go out of business. 
</P>
<P>
Holbrook said he favors "controlled" growth in the city, but has declined to 
state how he will vote on Proposition Z, which has emerged as the hottest 
single development issue in the election. The measure asks whether the City 
Council's approval of a hotel and community center proposed by restaurateur 
Michael McCarty on a parcel of state-owned beach should be repealed. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Jon Hobbs, 48, an auto shop teacher at Narbonne High School in Harbor 
City, has been the least active candidate. He has not appeared at many joint 
candidate forums, and he has not sent out any campaign literature. 
</P>
<P>
But he says his campaign is serious, and he plans to win. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not accepting a penny from anybody, because I would be working for the 
residents of Santa Monica," Hobbs said. "There would be no special interests. I 
would have no allegiance but to the people." 
</P>
<P>
A Santa Monica resident for more than 30 years, Hobbs supports the landlords' 
Proposition U over SMRR's Proposition W. He opposes McCarty's proposed beach 
hotel, saying he does not believe it will be successful. 
</P>
<P>
Hobbs is in favor of Proposition Y, the city attorney measure. "Mr. Myers is a 
competent attorney, but I feel he puts his personal challenges in front of his 
duties to the city of Santa Monica," Hobbs said. "The city attorney should be 
responsible to all the people, not just to the group that controls the 
council." 
</P>
<P>
Hobbs says the homeless should not be fed on the City Hall lawn. Instead, he 
says, the city should provide money, but then designate a social service agency 
to feed and counsel the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Vazquez, 34, a former schoolteacher, now works as a planner with United 
Way. A homeowner in Sunset Park since 1985, Vazquez is one of two candidates 
endorsed by SMRR. 
</P>
<P>
Though he supports a strong rent control law, Vazquez is better known for his 
work on Latino issues, including a stint as executive director of the Latino 
Resource Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Vazquez was also involved in an unsuccessful effort to qualify an initiative 
that would have replaced the city's at-large system of City Council 
representation with a district system. The intent of the campaign was to 
increase the minority representation on the council, which is now composed of 
seven Anglos. 
</P>
<P>
If elected, Vazquez would be the first Latino on the City Council. He says he 
would bring representation to the predominantly Latino Pico neighborhood, even 
though he does not live there. 
</P>
<P>
Vazquez says his background in social services would be an asset in dealing 
with such issues as homelessness, affordable housing, crime and the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
He proposes opening all armories in the Westside during the winter months as a 
way to get people off the streets and out of parks. To address the problems of 
alcohol abuse and public drunkenness among the homeless, he advocates a 
crackdown on the sale of fortified wines and stiff fines for the sale of 
alcohol to intoxicated people. 
</P>
<P>
Vazquez says he favors a citywide growth-management program to control 
development, but he will not say publicly how he plans to vote on the three 
development-related propositions on the ballot, including the one involving 
McCarty's hotel project. 
</P>
<P>
"I agree with the council's decision to place the matter of the hotel on the 
ballot for the voters to decide, and I don't want how I'm voting to influence 
other voters," Vazquez said. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Olsen, 36, is the other candidate endorsed by SMRR. Although he says he 
will work to maintain strong rent control -- including support for SMRR-backed 
Proposition W -- which allows for rent increases far smaller than the 
landlords' Proposition U -- he has been active more recently in fighting 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen, a 30-year resident of the city who lists his occupation on his ballot 
statement as writer/slow growth advocate, has been a board member of Mid-City 
Neighbors and likens his philosophy on controlled development to that of 
current Councilman Ken Genser. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could emulate Ken Genser, I would be very proud," he said. "I think Ken 
is sensitive to the neighbors' needs. He doesn't gloss over (staff reports) 
like everyone else. Ken is pro-environment, and I hope to be the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Olsen said he favors tying future development to the city streets' ability to 
handle the increased traffic. He opposes McCarty's proposed beach hotel and 
favors the council's recent decision to downzone certain residential areas to 
discourage the demolition of apartment buildings for new condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen also advocates hiring 35 additional police officers to combat increased 
gang activity and crime in parks, and supports the creation of an Office of 
Homeless Services, which would coordinate with other communities an effort to 
provide services. 
</P>
<P>
He opposes Proposition Y, saying it is really an attack on Myers and rent 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Schwallie, 30, is an attorney who lives in Sunset Park. She was a 
leader in forming a splinter residents' group in her neighborhood called 
Friends of Sunset Park, as well as a citywide coalition of neighborhood groups 
called the Santa Monica Neighborhood Coalition. Both groups advocate 
controlling commercial development in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Schwallie was a central figure in the successful battle early this year to 
thwart a large commercial development on city property at Santa Monica 
Municipal Airport. She also opposes McCarty's hotel project. 
</P>
<P>
When she announced her candidacy, she came out swinging at Reed, identifying 
the incumbent as a candidate "who needs to be defeated." 
</P>
<P>
More recently, she has attacked the dominance of SMRR candidates in local 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
"People do not believe their City Council is representing their interests," she 
said. "There is a perception that SMRR has outlived its usefulness." 
</P>
<P>
Schwallie, whom some SMRR members are personally backing, opposes both rent 
control propositions, saying that neither guarantees that landlords will stop 
going out of business under the terms of the state Ellis Act. As an 
alternative, she favors the Rent Control Board's Incentive Housing Program, 
which allows landlords to raise rents on some units if an equal number of units 
are set aside for low-income people. To participate, landlords must agree to 
keep their units on the rental market for at least 10 years. So far, the 
majority of landlords has shunned the program. 
</P>
<P>
Schwallie supports providing temporary shelters and a work program for the 
homeless, but opposes creating a city agency to deal with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Alvarez, 54, is a retired businesswoman who lives in the Pico 
neighborhood and has aligned with Reed and Holbrook. She ran unsuccessfully for 
the City Council two years ago as an independent and finished sixth in a field 
of 13. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez said that although the three allies agree on most issues, the decision 
to form a slate was primarily an economic one. She said the three are splitting 
the costs of a campaign headquarters, signs and some literature. 
</P>
<P>
She has been focusing on the issues of homelessness and crime, particularly in 
her neighborhood, which she said is often ignored by the City Council. She also 
questions Vazquez' contention that he would represent her neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not Latino, but I can do it better. I live here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez supports McCarty's proposed hotel because of the revenue it would 
provide the city and describes herself as a moderate when it comes to 
commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not pro-development, and I am not no-growth," she said. "There has to be 
some recycling (of run-down properties), although some scaling back of what has 
been recently approved is needed." 
</P>
<P>
A co-owner of two four-unit apartment buildings that she says she is selling, 
Alvarez supports the landlord-backed Proposition U over the SMRR measure 
because she said landlords need an incentive to stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez favors creating a commission to evaluate existing services for the 
homeless, and supports a ban on sleeping in city parks and beaches, as well as 
a ban on panhandling. 
</P>
<P>
Christine E. Reed, 46, is seeking an unprecedented fifth term on the council. 
As the lone incumbent, she has been the target of several of the challengers, 
primarily because of her voting record on commercial development, including 
support for the airport project and for McCarty's hotel. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that the full impact of some of the projects she voted for 
has turned out worse than she thought, Reed said she has voted with the 
economic health of the city in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was more Machiavellian, I would vote against all development like Mr. 
Genser," she said, noting that Genser has voted against most large commercial 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
Reed also supports the measure that would make the city attorney's office an 
elected position because she said there are not five votes on the City Council 
to fire Myers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a drastic measure only because the council has been so derelict to 
exercise its authority," she said. "This is the only way to get rid of Bob 
Myers." 
</P>
<P>
Reed said she favors the establishment of more shelters for the homeless, but 
not without a commitment to close the parks to overnight sleeping. She 
advocates incentives for the construction of new single room occupancy housing 
and a work program for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
She supports the landlords' rent control proposition over the SMRR measure. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Gilpin, 39, runs her own communications and marketing company and has 
been active in local politics since the early 1970s. She made an unsuccessful 
run for the council in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
She was a leader of the battle to stop the office project at the airport and 
also has been a vigorous opponent of McCarty's proposed hotel. 
</P>
<P>
She disdains the label of a "no-growther," saying that she favors development 
that takes into consideration a realistic approach to how much the city can 
bear. She said developers need to know up front what will be allowed to be 
built, rather than having the rules change "when he or she is standing in front 
of the council." 
</P>
<P>
"If the city continues to build as it has, then we are going to have a crisis," 
she said. "Santa Monica is, first and foremost, a residential community. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Gilpin's opponents contend that her opposition to McCarty's hotel is 
part of an attempt to resurrect the private Sand and Sea Club at the site. 
Gilpin denies it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are clear that if the Sand and Sea people tried to put a hotel 
there, I would try to stop that hotel, too," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gilpin, a tenant in a complex whose owner has served notice of intent to evict 
under the Ellis Act, opposes the landlords' Proposition U but is undecided on 
SMRR's alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Gilpin said that the major difference between her 1975 campaign and this race 
is that she spent $400 then and expects to spend about $25,000 this time. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Gebman, 44, is an engineer and policy analyst for the RAND Corp. He has 
been active primarily in youth activities, such as Little League and soccer. 
</P>
<P>
He said he decided to run for the City Council after seeing homeless people 
take over parks and in response to what he perceived to be a growing 
frustration in the community over aggressive panhandling. 
</P>
<P>
Gebman advocates forming a citizen advisory council to draw up a plan that 
would prevent people from sleeping in parks. As part of his plan, he proposes a 
two-level shelter system to separate those who need mental health services and 
those who are able to work. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his dissatisfaction with city policies regarding the homeless, he 
opposes making the city attorney an elected position -- a stance that he says 
has cost his campaign financial support. 
</P>
<P>
Gebman describes himself as moderate, rather than a "liberal slow-growther or 
no-growther" on development and was a founding member of the Santa Monica 
Neighborhood Coalition. He opposes McCarty's hotel and says residents should 
have more voice in how much new development should be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
He favors the landlords' ballot measure over SMRR's measure, with some 
reluctance. Gebman said he is concerned that some tenants may be forced out of 
their apartments, but says that Proposition U provides landlords with the most 
incentive to stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
Gebman says that he has supporters backing other candidates in both slates but 
that he opposes slate politics. 
</P>
<P>
MAJOR BALLOT MEASURES 
</P>
<P>
Here is where the City Council candidates stand on the major ballot measures 
that go before Santa Monica voters Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition U (landlords' rent control measure) -- The landlord-sponsored 
initiative that would allow rents on apartment units vacated voluntarily to 
rise to whatever rates the market will allow. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates in favor: Robert T. Holbrook, Larry Jon Hobbs, Donna Alvarez, 
Christine C. Reed, Jean Gebman. 
</P>
<P>
Against: Tony Vazquez, Kelly Olsen, Kathleen Schwallie, Sharon L. Gilpin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposition W (tenants' rent control measure) -- Backed by Santa Monicans for 
Renters' Rights to compete with Proposition U, it would allow specified 
increases in rents on units vacated voluntarily, but would keep rents generally 
well below free-market levels. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates in favor: Vazquez, Olsen. 
</P>
<P>
Against: Holbrook, Reed, Alvarez, Hobbs, Schwallie, Gebman. 
</P>
<P>
Undecided: Gilpin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposition Y (elected city attorney) -- Would make the city attorney an 
elected position rather than one appointed by the City Council. It was placed 
on ballot through an initiative drive sponsored by community members concerned 
about crime and aggressive panhandling by the city's sizable homeless 
population. City Atty. Robert M. Myers has been targeted by the group because 
of his reluctance to prosecute nonviolent crimes committed by the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates in favor: Holbrook, Hobbs, Alvarez, Reed. 
</P>
<P>

HIGH-TECH TOOLS USED TO AID HIGH-RISE SALES; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: CONDOMINIUM DEVELOPERS ARE RESORTING TO SLICK SALES GIMMICKS, 
INCLUDING A $500,000 HYDRAULIC 'MODEL CENTER,' TO BOOST SALES DURING A SLUGGISH 
MARKET. 
</P>

<P>
Los Angeles real estate agents have always looked for a silver lining in the 
"Golden Mile." 
</P>
<P>
When high prices and high interest rates forced some luxury condominium 
developers on Wilshire Boulevard to go bust in the early '80s, brokers pushed 
the residences' champagne views and caviar services. Ultimately, they had to 
push back prices but still suffered hard times. 
</P>
<P>
So it's no surprise that in the current economic malaise, with Southern 
California home sales hitting a three-year low, agents have trotted out some 
high-tech toys to peddle the million-dollar-plus condominiums in the Golden 
Mile -- the high-rise district on Wilshire Boulevard between Westwood and 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The developer of La Tour Wilshire, a 21-story ritzy condo complex currently 
under construction, recently unveiled a $500,000 "model center" to promote 
interest in the property. The center features a slick audiovisual presentation 
that touts some of the building's lavish details and the spectacular views 
offered by some of the units. 
</P>
<P>
But when the curtain goes up, the real show begins. With a picture backdrop of 
the city's skyline offering the only light in the room, a hydraulic model rises 
from the floor, presenting a finely-detailed, doll-house size version of the 
3,000-square-foot units. The model includes a completely furnished floor plan 
with tile, carpeting and fixtures, right down to the baby grand piano in the 
living room. 
</P>
<P>
Martha Gallier, the marketing specialist who developed the model center, said 
that although it is common for large-scale commercial developers to erect 
project models, it is rarely done for residential buildings. However, she said 
the developer, in this case Daiwa House Corp. of Japan, wanted to find a niche 
in the high-end condominium market and believed the model would show off the 
complex's upscale touches. 
</P>
<P>
"In this case, we are trying to position it as the ultimate in high-rise 
living, and at the very highest echelon (of luxury) in Los Angeles," said 
Gallier, a principal with Gallier and Wittenberg Inc. in Dallas. "We're saying 
that having this address says something about you. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've found is that there is a real momentum of marketing these projects. 
It's planned long in advance so people can get their own interior designers and 
begin building their own places. But using a model like this is definitely a 
new concept." 
</P>
<P>
Many competing condominium projects are also looking for their niche in the 
sluggish market, with some using videos and nearly all sending direct mail 
brochures to upscale Westside communities, such as Beverly Hills, Pacific 
Palisades and Brentwood. High-end homeowners are being feted at lavish 
luncheons with agents, followed by open house tours featuring the latest word 
in multimillion-dollar estates. 
</P>
<P>
Although economic analysts believe that the $1-million-and-up market is largely 
recession-proof, they say the lean times are causing all potential home buyers 
to move slowly, shopping around for the best buy. And the very rich are no 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
Sidney Kibrick, executive director of new housing for the Jon Douglas Co., said 
that agents now must find clients for their properties rather than just list 
the residence and wait for the offers to come in, as was the case during the 
1987-88 real estate boom. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is upside down right now. What used to work in terms of sales just 
doesn't apply anymore," he said. "The agents are having to do all the work now, 
especially when you get into the high-end market." 
</P>
<P>
Competition among relatively similar luxury condo projects is so intense that 
developers usually begin hyping the project at least a year in advance. At the 
$100-million La Tour Wilshire project, the first on-site model unit will not be 
completed until February, and the complex is not scheduled to open until 
mid-summer. 
</P>
<P>
"We just compete among ourselves (on the Golden Mile)," said Kristine Leroux, 
sales manager of the La Tour project. "Each building has its own character, and 
you've got to find the right person for your building. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people want larger units or a larger lobby. Some people are influenced by 
location. And some people don't want a wide mix of prices so that you have very 
expensive units and more moderate ones." 
</P>
<P>
But for the target audience, each building must have certain features: 24-hour 
security, valet parking and recreation facilities. After that, it's up to the 
developer to add extra touches, such as a concierge. 
</P>
<P>
Agents at both La Tour Wilshire and the Wilshire, a 97-unit granite and 
limestone high-rise, will be pitching the million-dollar views and myriad 
personal services that will be available at the buildings. But they will be 
hawking them to a very select group of condo shoppers -- those that want and 
can afford a $1-million to $2-million unit. The two-story penthouse at La Tour 
is being offered at $7.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers acknowledge that a $2-million condo is a tough sell in any market 
outside New York, and especially difficult in an area over-populated with 
similarly-priced estates. So a marketing hook, like a $500,000 model, is not 
only desirable, it may be essential. 
</P>
<P>
"The luxury (condo) stuff is always a little more difficult to sell," said Jon 
Douglas, president of the firm that is selling La Tour Wilshire. "People in 
that market are expecting the views and the security and the whistles and the 
bells. But if you give them that and a little more, then the property will 
move. You just have to be creative."

Looking for something different this Halloween? You can probably find it on the 
Westside. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, dog owners have a chance today to take the pooch out on the town 
and show him (or her) off in the Rude Dog Halloween Contest at Odyssey Video in 
Venice. Those rude dogs bold enough to enter will be judged on personality, 
costume and tricks. 
</P>
<P>
"Rude is an attitude," said Kim Sakaguchi of Odyssey Video, explaining what 
judges will be looking for. "A Rude Dog means it's cool, radical and totally 
awesome." 
</P>
<P>
Sakaguchi said judges for the Rude Dog costume contest will include actors who 
provide voices for characters on the "Rude Dog" TV cartoon show. The 
first-place prize will be a large, stuffed Rude Dog, with hats and cups among a 
host of other prizes. A $5 entry fee is required for the contest, which will 
take place from 1 to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
For those looking for something for the whole family, a pumpkin-carving session 
and reading of scary stories will take place at the Westside Arts Center from 
3:30 to 6 p.m. today. Professional storyteller Kathleen Zundell will use 
puppets and musical instruments to tell children ages 3-6 some slightly scary 
stories. She will then entertain the older crowd with a few really scary tales. 
</P>
<P>
The center has 250 pumpkins to share and is hoping for a big turnout. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a free-for-all," said Jane Greenberg, assistant program director. "There 
is no prize because we're not into the competitive side of creating art, but 
older kids should like it." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, those sophisticated mavericks searching for an 
out-of-the-ordinary Halloween experience can find the "Phantom" of the Marina 
Market Place filling the night air with organ music. The mysterious Phantom 
will perform haunting classical melodies by Bach from 5 to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street at the Villa Marina Center, Elvira, Jason and Freddy Kreuger 
look-alikes will be be handing out Halloween bags of goodies along with safety 
tips and coloring books from 3 to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza will celebrate its second annual Safe 
Halloween Party from 5 to 8 p.m. in the Bradley Court. Other events on 
Wednesday include a host of carnivals at various recreation centers.

Penmar Recreation Center will have a haunted house and carnival from 6 to 9 
p.m. Prizes will be awarded for a costume contest for children ages 5-8. 
Various games also will be offered. 
</P>
<P>
Oakwood Recreation Center hosts a carnival and costume contest from 4 to 7 p.m. 
for ages 6-12. Food and prizes will be available. And for children 14 and 
under, there is a carnival from 5:30 to 9 p.m. at Santa Monica Airport in the

MARINA PLACE DECISION MAY PROMPT SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court decision last week upholding Culver City's 
approval of the massive Marina Place shopping mall could increase pressure on 
opponents to accept a negotiated settlement with the mall's developers. 
</P>
<P>
During the summer, the Marina Place developers, Prudential Insurance Co. and 
Melvin Simon &amp; Associates, indicated a willingness to eliminate a 
six-screen movie theater, reduce the number of liquor licenses and provide an 
additional $1.6 million for traffic improvements, landscaping and beach 
shuttles if the city of Los Angeles dropped its legal challenge to the project. 
</P>
<P>
The offer was part of a package deal negotiated by developer Jerome Snyder in 
an effort to settle a border battle between Los Angeles and Culver City that 
threatened to tie up his $400-million Channel Gateway development. 
</P>
<P>
The back-room deal involving Marina Place fell apart when it became public in 
August. Snyder later negotiated his own agreement with Culver City to ensure 
his high-rise residential and office complex, just three blocks from Marina 
Place but in Los Angeles, could go forward without a courtroom challenge. 
</P>
<P>
That left the $160-million Marina Place project as the primary target of Venice 
area activists fearful that their area will choke in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
But on Thursday, Judge John Zebrowski ruled that the Culver City Council 
complied with the California Environmental Quality Act when it approved the 
project last March. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-acre shopping center site on Washington Boulevard at the far western 
edge of Culver City is surrounded on three sides by Los Angeles neighborhoods. 
Opponents argued that the 1-million-square-foot shopping center would 
dramatically worsen traffic congestion and air quality in the area, and speed 
the transformation of a residential neighborhood into a densely packed urban 
enclave. 
</P>
<P>
Zebrowski found that Culver City's decision to approve the project on economic 
and social grounds was based on substantial evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the political decision-makers may have made value judgments 
disfavored by some observers is not a basis for the court to nullify the 
political decision," the judge wrote in a six-page decision. 
</P>
<P>
The judge rejected the opponents' argument that Culver City had not responded 
adequately to criticism of the project's environmental impact report. "A 
reasonable effort to assemble and disclose information is required, not 
perfection," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Culver City officials and Marina Place developers were elated with the 
decision. "We're pleased that the court in essence vindicated what Culver City 
did and concluded that we complied with all requirements" of the state 
environmental law, said Joseph Pannone, special counsel for Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Bley, attorney for the Marina Place developers, expressed confidence 
that "the project is going to be built in the near future." 
</P>
<P>
Bley acknowledged that the shopping center "still has a number of obstacles," 
including another lawsuit filed by the Venice activists. That lawsuit alleges 
that Culver City failed to adequately consider the mall's potential impact on 
public access to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter said she was outraged by the 
judge's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter said she will urge the city attorney's office to appeal. "I don't want 
Culver City to build this project," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The first-term councilwoman, who faces a reelection challenge next spring, said 
again that she wants to see the site used primarily for residential housing, 
which generates less traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Venice activist Dell Chumley, a plaintiff in the Venice residents' suit against 
the mall, said she saw no room for compromise if the Marina Place project 
remains just a shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
But the rebuff in the first courtroom showdown of the border battle could 
provide an impetus to bring both sides to the bargaining table.

As a professional ice skater, Richard Dwyer, 54, jumps, spins and exudes charm. 
The skater, who lives in Hollywood Hills, is host at this year's historic Ice 
Capades "Golden Anniversary Edition," which opened Friday and will run through 
Nov. 4 at the Great Western Forum. 
</P>
<P>
In the late '40s, he inherited the title of Mr. Debonair from Roy Ships, who 
played the original role in the show. 
</P>
<P>
The costume and routine have become an Ice Capades tradition: Mr. Debonair 
skates into the arena dressed in a black top hat and tails. At each 
performance, he presents a dozen roses to a woman in the audience, and has 
given away more than 13,000 roses over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an optimist, you have to make things happen," Dwyer said, noting that "at 
times, it's been difficult to maintain a professional skating career, but I 
still enjoy the challenge of keeping up with changes in the sport." 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine University Prof. Byron D. Lane has been appointed to the county's

<P>
The colleagues of two Beverly Hills Unified School District staff members 
recently honored them with awards. 
</P>
<P>
A music teacher at Horace Mann School, Eloise Haldeman, was named teacher of

HOT PROPERTY: 'CROCODILE' HUNT NETS 3-ACRE HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Crocodile Dundee" star PAUL HOGAN and his bride and co-star, LINDA KOZLOWSKI, 
have purchased a Country English-style house behind gates in the Beverly Hills 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Hogan, the Australian hunter in the "Dundee" films, and Kozlowski, the American 
journalist who stole the hunter's heart, were married in May after completing 
their co-starring roles in the Paramount comedy "Almost an Angel," due to be 
released in December. 
</P>
<P>
Their wedding was held in a $2-million mansion that Hogan, who started his 
working life as a painter on the Sydney bridge, built for Kozlowski at Faraway 
Possum Creek, near the beach town of Byron Bay in New South Wales, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Their new Beverly Hills-area home, bought for about $6.5 million, is on three 
acres with rolling lawns and a mountain view just west of Coldwater Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Built of stone and wood in 1982, the two-story house has three bedrooms, four 
baths and two maid's quarters in about 7,200 square feet. It also has a tennis 
court, pool, spa and stone waterfall. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills real estate broker Stan Herman owned the two-story house and 
lived there after buying it two years ago for slightly more than $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
He refurbished it, changing the floor plan, enlarging the living room and 
creating a second master bedroom, sources say. His firm had the $6.75-million 
listing. 
</P>
<P>
The buyers were represented by Brett Lawyer of Douglas Properties, who wouldn't 
comment except to say that an overseas corporation purchased the property for 
investment purposes. 
</P>
<P>
When in town, the couple has been living in a larger Beverly Hills house that 
Hogan bought through an overseas corporation before he and Kozlowski were 
married, another source said. 
</P>
<P>
Impressionist RICH LITTLE has dropped the price on his Malibu compound by $2 
million since it quietly came on the market a year ago, and now he's offering 
the gated, bluff-top home on about seven acres at $9,995,000. 
</P>
<P>
The compound includes a 7,000-square-foot, five-bedroom, 6 1/2-bath main house 
on 1.6 acres with a north/south tennis court, swimming pool, koi pond, 
office/gym complex and motor court plus an adjacent 5 1/2 acres with a 
secondary residence and a guest house. The 1.6-acre part of the estate can be 
acquired for $7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywood Wives," the ABC miniseries based on Jackie Collins' bestseller, was 
filmed there, said listing brokers Paul and Sara Grisanti of Douglas 
Properties, Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Little lives most of the time in Las Vegas, where he works. The Malibu home was 
his primary residence, but was put on the market as part of his divorce 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar-winning actress GREER GARSON'S co-op at the Wilshire Terrace, which 
sustained heavy damage from a 1989 fire, has been sold for $960,000, sources 
say. 
</P>
<P>
"Her unit was totally burned out; what was sold was a shell," one of the 
sources said. Emma Lampel at George Elkins Co., Beverly Hills, represented both 
parties but was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two of the 97 units in the 14-story building, on Wilshire Boulevard's 
"Golden Mile," were destroyed or severely damaged in the blaze, which occurred 
while Garson was at her Texas ranch. The 31-year-old building is being 
restored. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney and his wife bought the sixth-floor co-op, which Garson had owned 
for many years. She combined two apartments into a single 5,015-square-foot 
unit with five bedrooms and five baths. 
</P>
<P>
"She wanted to sell it, because she doesn't come to California that often and 
when she does, she goes to Palm Springs," a source said. 
</P>
<P>
The 82-year-old actress still has homes in Palm Springs, Dallas and Santa Fe, 
where she was honored last weekend with a new film studio in her name. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Southern California real estate market at most price levels is in 
the doldrums, there is one development opening this week just north of Beverly 
Hills where the lots alone start at $3.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the 325-acre Beverly Park, which such notables as Magic Johnson, Pia 
Zadora, Jon Peters, Sir Gordon White and Richard and Lili Zanuck already call 
home. 
</P>
<P>
They bought in the 100-acre South Beverly Park, where 16 mansions have been 
built on one-acre sites. Most recent completed home sales there have been in 
the $7-million range. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the 225-acre North Beverly Park, which opens Thursday with a 
champagne and hors d'oeuvres party for 1,000. This phase has 64 lots, each with 
two level acres; a four-acre park with three holes of golf, a croquet-playing 
area, a jogging path and a waterfall. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have some houses in there in the next couple of years that will be worth 
$10 million to $16 million," said Brian Adler, who plans to build a couple of 
them on spec himself. Adler and Marshall Ezralow are the developers of Beverly 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
KNBC-TV sportscaster FRED ROGGIN, whose new show "Roggin's Heroes" is scheduled 
for syndication early next year, and his wife, Eileen, have purchased a larger 
house near one they just put on the market in Studio City at $679,000. 
</P>
<P>
They bought the 26-year-old house, with three bedrooms and 2 1/2 baths, 2 1/2 
years ago and then remodeled it. 
</P>
<P>
"They moved because, with two children, they needed more room," said listing 
broker Don Pistotnik of Land and Real Estate Investments, Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The Roggins' new home is 6,500 square feet in size; their former one, about 
2,300 square feet.

BIG CITY, SMALL TOWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, Dillow is a La Canada-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No one lives in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
That statement might be disputed by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, which 
estimates that, in fact, about 8.6 million people live in Los Angeles County -- 
3.4 million of them in the city of Los Angeles, 4.2 million in other 
incorporated cities and 1 million in unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
But the Census Bureau's figures are examples of facts that can be accurate 
without necessarily being true. 
</P>
<P>
To reiterate, no one lives in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
Who would want to, really, considering the images the name L.A. conjures up? 
</P>
<P>
L.A means smog and traffic. It means gangs and drive-by shootings, and freeway 
shootings. L.A. means hustlers and weirdos and cult murders in the canyons. 
Used in adjective form -- as in, "That's so-o-o-o-o L.A.!" -- L.A. means 
superficially trendy, devoid of substance, heat without light. 
</P>
<P>
And it's so big. 
</P>
<P>
It sprawls over mountains, down valleys, across concrete-lined rivers. It 
bridges climatic zones. It has more than 45,000 different streets. You can 
drive more than 30 miles through the city without ever leaving Sepulveda 
Boulevard, and pass through almost every conceivable ethnic, cultural and 
economic strata along the way. It's a metropolis so vast, so jam-packed with 
bustling humanity that it requires two, and soon three, telephone area codes. 
</P>
<P>
How could anyone live in such a large and confusing -- and thus potentially 
threatening -- place? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is, we don't. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, we secede psychologically. 
</P>
<P>
We mentally move ourselves out of L.A. and into smaller, safer, more manageable 
places -- places like Silver Lake or Lomita or Echo Park or Burbank or Granada 
Hills or Brentwood or Baldwin Hills or almost any other of the 86 incorporated 
cities and 188 unofficial communities in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
And we tell ourselves that, while we may be forced by ambition or circumstance 
to work in The Big City, we actually live in Small Town, U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
It's a phenomenon familiar to psychologists, urban planners and readers of the 
"At Home" community profiles in the Real Estate section. 
</P>
<P>
Again and again in interviews about their communities -- even communities that 
lie within the boundaries of the city of Los Angeles -- residents describe the 
communities in terms that make them sound as if they were situated in North 
Dakota instead of in the second largest metropolis in America. 
</P>
<P>
Examples: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "It seems like a little country town," a Studio City resident told a Times 
writer in describing her San Fernando Valley community. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "It's almost small townish here," said a Northridge resident. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "It's like living in a small town," said a Woodland Hills resident. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Highland Park has a small-town atmosphere," said a resident of that 
community situated just a few miles north of downtown L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Warner Center has a small-town atmosphere," said a resident of that San 
Fernando Valley community. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "It's still Small Town, U.S.A.," said a resident of Westdale, in West Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
To hear the locals tell it, everyone in L.A. lives, not in a city, but in a 
village, a hamlet, a burg. 
</P>
<P>
Even people who might otherwise see themselves as cosmopolites seem to share 
that yearning to live in Small Town, U.S.A. For example, even the entertainment 
industry maintains the fiction that it is centered, not in L.A., but in a 
disproportionately star-studded but nevertheless small town called "Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
Some L.A. residents go to great lengths to reinforce that small-town feeling, 
and will bitterly fight any perceived attempt to diminish it. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a few years ago, residents of Atwater, a small L.A. district 
adjacent to Glendale, were incensed when the city put up signs identifying the 
district as simply "Atwater." They insisted that the proper name was "Atwater 
Village." 
</P>
<P>
A small matter, you think? Nothing to get excited about? Maybe not to you. 
</P>
<P>
But according to Eric Ludwig, president of the community residents' 
association, Atwater residents "erupted in cheers" when it was announced at a 
meeting that the city had agreed, after months of negotiations, to put up new 
signs designating the district not as plain old Atwater, but as "Atwater 
Village." 
</P>
<P>
"That really solidified the notion of togetherness" among Atwater residents -- 
pardon, Atwater Village residents -- Ludwig said. "If I say I'm from Atwater 
Village, it gives me a certain identity." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, the community really does have "a village environment." 
</P>
<P>
But it's not just Los Angeles residents who practice psychological secession 
from The Big City. Those of us who live in incorporated cities or 
unincorporated areas within Los Angeles County do it, too. Our Town may be 
distinguishable from the surrounding megalopolis only by a few lines on a map, 
but we also tell ourselves that we live in Small Town, U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
"It still has that small town atmosphere," said a man who lives in Culver City, 
which is almost completely surrounded by the city of L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels like a small town," said a denizen of Santa Monica, which at 97,000 
people, is bigger than the biggest cities in Delaware, Montana, Wyoming, 
Vermont, West Virginia and both Dakotas. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the last of the small-town communities around," said a resident of El 
Segundo -- a claim that, as we've seen, might come as a surprise to residents 
of Culver City and Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, advantages to small-town life, L.A. style. Since we live 
in these Small Towns, U.S.A., we are by definition free of the evils attendant 
to the modern Big City. We may have to deal with Big City problems when we 
venture Out There, but when we come home, we mentally cross a moat and pull up 
the drawbridge behind us. 
</P>
<P>
Smog? Traffic? Crime? Not in my Small Town, U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't really have much of a smog problem in Duarte," said a resident of 
that city, situated in the consistently smog-covered San Gabriel Valley. Sure, 
he said, Monrovia or Azusa may have a smog problem, but "we're in kind of a 
pocket here in Duarte." 
</P>
<P>
"Burbank remains kind of like an island in the megalopolis," said a resident of 
that city, specifically referring to the relatively low -- the key word here is 
relatively -- crime rate in his small town. 
</P>
<P>
"I moved here to get away from the noise and the traffic," said a resident of 
Westchester, situated near Los Angeles International Airport -- not an area 
that is famous, among non-residents at least, for its peace and quiet. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, part of this reluctance to admit the existence of urban problems in 
Our Town may simply be a normal aversion to sullying one's own nest. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of a given community may mutter darkly among themselves about 
increasing traffic, or crime, or smog, while offering an outsider a far sunnier 
picture -- particularly if that outsider is going to put their words in the 
newspaper. There are, after all, property values to consider. 
</P>
<P>
But beyond that, there also seems to be an acute case of what might be called 
"urban denial" involved here. And if Our Town does show undeniable signs of 
some urban problem, the common response is to insist that it is a slop-over 
from the metropolis, not a home-grown product. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "You see a few gang members in Commerce," said a resident of that city, 
"but that's because they come over here from East L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Most of the traffic problems in Tujunga are because of all the new 
development in Sunland," said a Tujunga resident. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The only reason we have smog in Pasadena is because it blows up here from 
the city," said a Pasadenan -- as if there were no internal combustion engines 
north of Huntington Drive. 
</P>
<P>
But even though we want to live in Small Town, U.S.A., none of us wish to be 
rubes. We want to be freeway-close to The Big City when it beckons. 
</P>
<P>
No problem: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Downtown L.A. is there when you want it," said a resident of the 
aformentioned bucolic district of Westchester. "We had tickets to the Music 
Center for years. But the rest of the time we're off here in our little 
corner." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "We wanted to find more open spaces," said a man who found what he was 
looking for in Northridge. But he quickly added that, open spaces 
notwithstanding, Northridge "is convenient to everything." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The darkness at night makes you feel like you're far away from the city," 
said a Woodland Hills resident. "But in six minutes you can drive down to 
Ventura Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
Small-town living and six minutes from the mall! It's the best of both worlds. 
</P>
<P>
Why do we do this? Why do we seem to reject the city even while we're living in 
it? Why do we insist, contrary to all the evidence, that we live in Small Town, 
U.S.A.? 
</P>
<P>
According to Andrei Simic, a USC urban anthropologist, we may prefer to 
identify with small towns for the same reasons that ducks fly south in the 
winter and salmon swim upstream to spawn -- instinct. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to remember that for 90% of mankind's existence on earth he lived 
exclusively in small groups," Simic said, pointing out that the city is a 
relatively recent invention and the L.A.-style megalopolis an even more recent 
one. 
</P>
<P>
It may be "instinctive," Simic said, for people to "want to break (a city) down 
into units that are more manageable, and with which they can identify. . . . I 
think people need that." 
</P>
<P>
According to Allan Heskin, head of the urban planning department at UCLA, that 
need to break down the metropolis may be especially necessary in an urban area 
as large as this one. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people really don't have a firm conception of L.A.," said Heskin, adding 
that in experiments with "cognitive mapping" -- that is, asking people to draw 
maps of their surroundings -- most people could not even begin to draw a map of 
the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
True, in a city that is a tribute to the gerrymanderer's art, and in an age 
when people can graduate from high school thinking that Brazil is a place in 
Europe, the widespread inability to draw a map of L.A. may not be too 
surprising. But the point is that people can draw maps of their own small 
communities with considerable accuracy; L.A., on the other hand, is simply a 
vast, unfathomable sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
"People need to identify with someplace," Heskin said. "The scale of L.A. could 
make it necessary for them to identify with much smaller areas." 
</P>
<P>
Tridib Banerjee, an associate professor of urban and regional planning at USC, 
agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"The theory has been that the sense of community was declining in American 
cities," Banerjee said, "but I think that's changing." 
</P>
<P>
"The notion of living in a village or a small town, even if it's only symbolic, 
may give people an increased sense of place. The more Los Angeles becomes too 
big, too vast, there may be a growing tendency to find ties within a locality." 
</P>
<P>
Is there anything wrong with this attitude? Would we be better off if we all 
saw ourselves as citizens of one giant community instead of a bunch of little 
ones? Or should we officially recognize our need to live in Small Towns, 
U.S.A., and further break up the L.A. metropolis by making all of our many 
"communities" legally as well as emotionally separate from the rest? 
</P>
<P>
Identifying with a small community "is a good idea," says Irene Goldenberg, a 
UCLA family psychologist. "It gives you a feeling that you have some power over 
your life," Goldenberg said, adding, however, that "if it causes you to totally 
deny the existence of real urban problems, problems of which you really are a 
part, then it's not helpful." 
</P>
<P>
USC anthropologist Simic agrees. "If by instinct we need to identify with small 
groups, we also have a whole hierarchy of groups that require varying degrees 
of loyalty" -- that is, family, friends, community, city, state, nation and 
various gradations in between. 
</P>
<P>
If our only loyalties are to the small groups, Simic points out, it can be 
"divisive," adding, "There are some areawide problems that have to be managed 
as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, it probably would be a bad idea for all 188 unofficial 
communities in Los Angeles County to separately incorporate, as Diamond Bar 
recently did, as Malibu is trying to do. Having 86 separate incorporated cities 
in the county already poses problems in terms of police and fire protection, 
mass transit programs, pollution control, and so on. Increasing that number to 
274 legally separate cities probably wouldn't help matters. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, while there may be some common goals behind which we can all 
unite -- the continuing need for water from Northern California, for example, 
or the desirability of the Lakers winning the playoffs -- we probably shouldn't 
expect that we can somehow completely subordinate our local concerns to the 
needs of the metropolis as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Mar Vista or Bel-Air, for example, are not going to suddenly 
overcome 100,000 years of genetic imprinting and start worrying as much or more 
about what's going on in Tujunga or Harbor City as they do about what's going 
on in their own communities. 
</P>
<P>
So we may have to simply muddle along as we are, a crazy quilt of villages and 
hamlets and small towns, pressed cheek-to-jowl within the metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
Within the metropolis, but not necessarily of it. 
</P>
<P>
There is one small change we could make, however, in recognition of our obvious 
need to believe we live in small towns. And it could be accomplished without 
great cost and without creating administrative havoc. 
</P>
<P>
We could take our cue from the good people of Atwater -- again, pardon, Atwater 
Village -- and simply put up some new signs. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of having signs that say "Entering Los Angeles," we could have signs 
informing residents and visitors alike that, regardless of the vast urban 
sprawl laid out before them, they actually are entering "Small Towns, U.S.A."

HOME PRICE DIFFERENTIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Home Sick" by Rhonda Bright (Aug. 26) and rebuttals in 
"Letters," there is no doubt that real estate prices are abnormally high in 
Southern California. Recent figures on home affordability in Los Angeles, 
Orange and San Diego counties indicate that only 15%, 14% and 19% of all people 
living in those counties can afford to buy the median-priced house. 
</P>
<P>
The median home price in Los Angeles County is approximately $215,000; Orange 
County, $234,000; and San Diego County, $186,000. The median home price 
nationwide is $96,000. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, the median sales price of a home in California was $24,300, and 
nationwide, $23,000. California and nationwide home price averages stayed 
fairly close together until the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Even with that hyperinflation in the late 1970s, according to the California 
Assn. of Realtors, 46% of people could afford a California home in 1977, and in 
the same year, the figure was 57% nationwide. By 1988, only 26% of people could 
afford to buy the typical California home, while 48% were able to purchase a 
home at the national average. 
</P>
<P>
Only recently has the pace of inflation in residential real estate in 
California begun to slow, following a national trend. 
</P>
<P>
There is no housing shortage in Southern California. There is an affordable 
housing shortage. The fact is simple: most people who haven't been owning a 
home in California for the past 15 or 20 years are priced out of the market. 
Ah, yes, most of these are part of the younger generation. 
</P>
<P>
What it comes down to is that California, with Southern California in 
particular, is beginning to lose out on business activity because of high 
housing costs. 
</P>
<P>
This current slowdown in sales of homes and drop in home prices has been 
long-awaited by many. Hopefully, it will continue for at least 10 years. It 
appears that it will take quite a long period of time until homes will start 
selling a little bit more.

DEALING FAIRLY WITH SALESMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to explain my remark concerning the hardware store salesmen in my 
Sept. 30 article, "Newlywed Builders Learn Magic Words: Redo It," which 
prompted several letters. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the particular wording leaves the impression that my husband and 
I solicited salesmen for advice by tricking them into believing we were going 
to buy the product from their store. 
</P>
<P>
During our remodeling we did, in fact, buy extensive materials from our local 
store, Verdugo Hardware on Eagle Rock Boulevard. We are regular customers there 
and have added to their cash register many times! 
</P>
<P>
When we asked for advice we told them up-front that it was on a product we had 
already purchased or were going to purchase at a discount center. They were 
aware of that and still offered their knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
The products that we did purchase at discount centers were those that the local 
store did not stock in volume needed for building a house (i.e. drywall) and 
those they did not stock, such as cabinets and hardwood floors. 
</P>
<P>
My husband and I are not "unethical" or "deceitful." Our dealings with the 
local salesmen were always fair and honest. It is unfortunate this was not 
clearly reflected in the article and, consequently, some readers took offense. 
I direct my apologies to those salesmen who helped us get our house built.

HANDYMAN Q &amp; A: REMOVING STAINS FROM CONCRETE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Popular Mechanics 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: What's the best way to clean oil and grease from a concrete floor? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: If oil has been freshly spilled onto a concrete surface, blot up as 
much as you can, then cover the spot with one of the following: powdered 
calcium carbonate, hydrated lime, talc or fuller's earth. Portland cement can 
also be used. Let powder stand for 24 hours and then scrape it off. 
</P>
<P>
If oil has penetrated into the concrete, scrape off whatever remains on the 
surface with a putty knife and then cover the stain with a stiff poultice made 
from one of the powdered substances above, combined with a solution of one part 
trisodium phosphate and six parts water. Let the poultice stand 24 hours, then 
scrape it off. Scrub the surface with clean water. 
</P>
<P>
Grease is easier to remove than oil. If scraping and scrubbing doesn't work, 
use a poultice made from benzene, naphtha or trichloroethane and an inert 
powder. Allow it to stand 24 hours, then scrape the surface clean. 
</P>

Right Fire Extinguisher Needed for Household 
</P>
<P>
Q: I want to buy a fire extinguisher for my home but I don't know which type to 
get. What do you recommend? 
</P>
<P>
A: The wrong type of fire extinguisher could do more harm than good. It must 
suit the type of fire that's burning. 
</P>
<P>
There are three types of fires. Class A fires are those that involve ordinary 
combustibles such as wood, paper, cloth, rubber. Home fires of this type often 
start in the living room or bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
Class B fires involve cooking oils, grease, gasoline, paint thinners and other 
flammable liquids. These fires generally break out in kitchens and garages. 
Class C fires are electrical fires and are usually the result of faulty wiring, 
overloaded circuits or faulty electrical appliances. 
</P>
<P>
On fire extinguishers, these categories are designated by the letters A, B and 
C within a triangle, square and circle, respectively. Class B-, or BC-rated 
extinguishers are not effective on Class A fires. 
</P>
<P>
Also, water, which is effective in putting out a Class A fire will cause a 
Class B fire to spread and can cause a severe shock in a Class C fire. Once a 
fire in the home spreads, it can quickly include all three categories. 
Therefore, your best choice is a fire extinguisher rated for all three classes 
of fire. 
</P>
<P>
Fire extinguishers are available at hardware stores and home centers. When you 
buy one, check to if it's listed by Underwriters Laboratories Inc., and 
displays the A, B and C designations. Also, note the numbers in front of the A 
and B designations. These refer to the size of fire that the extinguisher can 
generally handle. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers are not absolute figures, but are relative terms for comparing 
different units. For example, an extinguisher with a rating of 2A:40B:C will 
handle a Class A fire twice as large, and a Class B fire four times as large, 
as a unit rated 1A:10B:C. 
</P>
<P>
Note that there are no size ratings for Class C fires. The C designation only 
means that the chemical inside will not conduct electricity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plumbing Relief Valves Discharging 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have two relief valves in my plumbing system that discharge 1 to 2 pints 
of water a day. Both are set to discharge at 150 psi or 210 degrees F. One 
valve is on my water heater. The other is attached to the hose bib at the rear 
of the house. The water pressure entering my house is 160 psi, and a pressure 
reducer by the water inlet reduces it to 58 psi. The thermostat on my water 
heater is set for 140 degrees F. Do you have any suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
A: There are three conditions that cause relief valves to discharge. The 
pressure is too high, the temperature is too high or the valve is faulty. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming the temperature and pressure measurements you indicated are correct, I 
suspect the relief valve on your water heater is faulty and should be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, a hose bib doesn't need a relief valve, although it should have a 
vacuum breaker to prevent water from the hose from back-siphoning into the 
house's water system in the event of a pressure drop. The fact there is a 
relief valve indicates the piping to the hose bib probably bypasses the 
reducing valve.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: ULTRA-LOW-FLOW TOILET STINGY WITH WATER USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We still have the old original toilets in our house. Should we expect 
to save much money on our water bills by installing a new ultra-low-flow 
toilet? What types are available and do they flush adequately? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: A new ultra-low-flow toilet can pay back its entire price many times 
with lower water bills over its life. Using less water keeps future water rates 
lower because fewer new treatment plants are needed. Excessive water usage is 
one of the greatest threats to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The most common ultra-low-flow toilets use about 1.5 gallons per flush (gpf). 
If your house was built before 1980, it probably has a 5.5-gpf toilet. In the 
early 1980s, 3.5 gpf became the standard. For a family of four, switching from 
a 5.5-gpf to a 1.5-gpf toilet saves about 24,000 gallons of water per year -- a 
70% savings. 
</P>
<P>
Two common types of ultra-low-flow toilets are the gravity type and the 
flushometer tank type. The gravity type works like your standard toilet, but 
has a special bowl and trap design. This provides adequate flushing action with 
less water. Since it uses less water, it is quieter and take only 45 seconds to 
refill. Both types look like standard toilets. 
</P>
<P>
Flushometer tanks use a special cylindrical chamber inside the toilet tank. As 
the chamber fills with water after a flush, the water pressure compresses the 
air in it. When the toilet is flushed, this compressed air forces out the water 
under pressure to give a forceful positive flush. 
</P>
<P>
The bowl is cleared in only 10 seconds, but it takes about 60 to 90 seconds to 
refill the tank. Flushometer tank toilets work best if you have normal to high 
water pressure in your area. Check with a local plumber about your water 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
There are also some super-low-flow toilets that use less than one-half gpf. One 
type uses an electric air compressor to assist in the flushing. This produces a 
very vigorous flush to clear the bowl with almost no water. 
</P>
<P>
Another toilet uses electric elements to incinerate the waste instead of water 
to flush it away. As the waste is vaporized and burned to a fine white powder, 
the vapors are vented outdoors. Since it is incinerated at very high 
temperatures, germs are eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
When you buy a new toilet, check the specifications carefully. Many so-called 
water saver toilets are just a standard 3.5 gpf design. The prices for 
ultra-low-flow toilets range from about $90 to more than $300. They are 
available in most designer colors. 
</P>
<P>
You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 089, showing a buyer's guide 
of 20 manufacturers of ultra-low-flow toilets, model numbers, water usage 
(gpf), type, price range, number of colors, and chart showing the water bills 
savings by installing a new toilet. Please include $1 and a self-addressed 
stamped business-size envelope. Send your requests to James Dulley, c/o Los

Balloon, Platform Framing Defined 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is the difference between balloon-framing and platform-framing 
construction. Which type is most energy efficient? 
</P>
<P>
A: In balloon-framing the wall studs run from the foundation all the way up to 
the roof. This is often used in two-story construction or in rooms with high 
cathedral ceilings. Platform-framing builds the second floor walls separately 
on top of the first floor. 
</P>
<P>
With proper construction, there is not a significant difference in energy 
efficiency. Since balloon-framing is generally stronger and more rigid, it may 
result in fewer air leaks over time.

MAKING CONNECTIONS WITH THE RIGHT WIRE NUT; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTRICITY: WIRE NUTS COME IN THREE SIZES. PROPER JOINING OF WIRES IS 
IMPORTANT TO AVOID MALFUNCTIONS OR WORSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. J. HAND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Looking for the easiest way to join two or more electrical wires together? It 
has to be the wire nut. But don't be fooled. As easy as wire nuts are to use, 
it's still possible to use them incorrectly. 
</P>
<P>
And when that happens, the results can range from the annoying (say a ceiling 
fixture that won't work) to the disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
Wire nuts -- sometimes called solderless connectors -- are those little 
twist-on fasteners that look like toothpaste caps. They come in various sizes, 
usually labeled as small, medium and large. If you do much wiring, it pays to 
have a package of all three sizes on hand. 
</P>
<P>
And now, before we get down to using any nuts, let me state the obvious. Do not 
work on any live wires. If you are working on a house circuit, be sure it is 
shut off at the main service panel. If you are working on an appliance, you can 
simply unplug it. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the label on your pack of wire nuts will specify how many of what 
size wire the nut is sized for. If you end up with a bunch of nuts and no size 
information to go on, work by trial and error. If a nut is too big for the job, 
it will thread on loosely and come off if you tug on it. If a nut is too small, 
you won't be able to screw it in place. 
</P>
<P>
If you are joining two or more solid wires together, start by stripping each 
wire evenly. How much to strip varies with wire size and wire nut size. 
</P>
<P>
While you might strip just 5/16th inch off a 14-gauge wire for a small nut, you 
might strip as much as three-quarter inch if you were joining heavier wires 
with a larger nut. Package labels often specify how much to strip, but if not, 
you can let trial and error be your guide. More about that in a second. 
</P>
<P>
For the average job, stripping about half an inch is a good starting point. 
After stripping, place the two conductors side by side with their ends even as 
shown. Slip them into the wire nut, and while pressing firmly, screw the nut in 
place until it stops. If any bare wire extends below the nut, you have stripped 
too much. Nip back the ends of the wires and try again. If you have not 
stripped enough, you'll find it difficult to twist the nut in place before the 
insulations starts to interfere. In that case, strip off a bit more insulation 
and try again. 
</P>
<P>
Once the nut is in place, it makes sense to secure it with plastic electrical 
tape. This will help prevent any possibility of the nut falling off and causing 
a short. Start by taking a couple of turns around the base of the nut. Then 
work down and take a few wraps around both wires. Finally spiral back up and go 
around the base of the nut a couple more times. That should do the trick. 
</P>
<P>
If you are joining two or more stranded wires (the type with conductors made up 
of several thin wires instead of one solid wire), the directions above apply. 
But if you need to join a stranded wire to a solid wire, a slightly different 
technique is recommended to assure a solid connection. 
</P>
<P>
Start by stripping about half an inch of insulation off the end of the solid 
wire. Then strip an inch off the end of the stranded wire. Wrap the stranded 
wire around the bottom half of the exposed solid wire as shown in the sketch, 
and then fold the end of the solid wire over and squeeze it down tight. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, screw the wire nut in place. If any bare wire extends below the nut, 
you have stripped too far. Disassemble the connection and try again. It's best 
to cut the ends off both wires and start over from scratch rather than trying 
to straighten, unwind, rewind and rebend. 
</P>
<P>
Once you make a connection you are pleased with, finish it off with electrical 
tape as outlined above and the job is complete.

DUNMORE TOWN, Bahamas 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We were wedged into a little skiff with our luggage, slicing across the satin, 
sunstruck water separating Harbour Island from Eleuthera. 
</P>
<P>
The sky shimmered azure, Monet clouds puffed along the horizon and a Bahamian 
breeze blew away big-city stress. I watched my husband's face relax as we 
skimmed toward one of our favorite retreats last June. 
</P>
<P>
The penny-size isle is but a speck in the Bahamian cosmos, a secluded star in 
the constellation of 700 islands sprinkled over the shallow seas between 
Florida and Cuba. The Bahamas are not technically part of the vast Caribbean 
region, but they hover close to the northern edge of the Caribbean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Harbour Island itself hovers just two miles north of Eleuthera and is not only 
off the beaten path, it's lost in a time warp. 
</P>
<P>
Dunmore Town casts a quaint and sleepy eye along the harbor. Little more than a 
cluster of colonial cottages and picturesque estates, it looks like old Cape 
Cod repainted in pastels. The village wears the patina of its 17th-Century 
origins, when it served as the first capital of the Bahamas under Gov. Lord 
Dunmore. 
</P>
<P>
An aura of tranquillity from a kinder, gentler age pervades the island. No 
tacky souvenir shops, cruise ship crowds or noisy night spots mar its serenity. 
Nor is it the least bit pretentious. This is one resort that has maintained its 
small-scale, low-key splendor. 
</P>
<P>
Three miles long, the island faces a broad smooth harbor on the west, and wears 
a long fringe of powdery pink-sand beach on its Atlantic side. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of glassy waters for sporting folks and creamy surf for beach 
lovers makes a heavenly marriage of vacation pleasures. For us, Harbour Island 
serves as both a romantic retreat and awesome fishing grounds. Without it, the 
yin and yang of our marriage might have come unglued long ago. 
</P>
<P>
Harbour Island's compact size makes it a paradise for pedestrians. Between 
beach and harbor is a half-mile of rolling lowlands thick with banyan trees and 
tropical foliage. Crisscrossing the verdant terrain are shady lanes and picket 
fences woven with bougainvillea. 
</P>
<P>
I like to begin and end my walks at the harbor's edge, where sailboats ride 
their moorings. Children frolic and fishermen get organized on the dock near 
Government House, a pink, cupolaed former customs house and island landmark. 
Under an umbrella of spreading trees, island merchants sell handmade straw 
crafts and home-grown fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
First, I bought a wide-brimmed hat at Sarah's Straw Works, then set off down 
Dunmore Street, the ragged ribbon of cobbled roadway that weaves through the 
island. This shade-dappled, storybook lane is lined with little cottages and 
handsome walled estates from the Victorian era. 
</P>
<P>
I walked past clapboard houses jammed with architectural marmalade from the 
19th Century: wrap-around porches, widow's walks, peaked gables and pastel 
lattice-work. 
</P>
<P>
I heard hymns wafting from the colonial churches and anthem practice at St. 
John's Anglican, oldest church in the Bahamas. Then I wended through tangled 
vines and leaf-carpeted paths toward the beach to follow the soothing sound of 
the surf. 
</P>
<P>
By the time I looped back to town, I was ready to buy a mango and a pendant of 
bananas and sing my own song. 
</P>
<P>
If you're not avid about walking, you can rent a motor scooter, Jeep or golf 
cart for exploring. Or check out skiffs at the harbor's edge. With or without a 
guide, you can circumnavigate the island. 
</P>
<P>
Folks here date back to the 1640s, when a band of Bermudans seeking more 
religious freedom sailed south and established a nearby British colony. They 
dubbed themselves the "Eleutherian Adventurers" and christened their new home 
Eleuthera, Greek for "freedom." 
</P>
<P>
Today, many locals are the descendants of Tory Loyalists and their slaves who 
left Florida to seek refuge after the American Revolution. The island has 
become a close-knit community of families, black and white, whose pace is 
languid and whose heritage is tinged with English graciousness. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Major, a regal Bahamian taxi driver, used to meet us at the dock. Now 
his sons Reggie and Wayne drive the pot-holed, flower-filled lanes to our hotel 
and offer colorful island tours. 
</P>
<P>
"Bonefish Joe" Cleare, a legendary fishing guide, has helped my husband land 
the elusive bonefish, "ghost of the flats," in every season. Alkie Cleare 
taught our daughter to water-ski in the mirrored harbor. Flossie Mae Bain once 
kept an entire dining room spellbound with her gospel-style happy birthday 
solo. 
</P>
<P>
The native cuisine is a vital part of Harbour Island's appeal. Dining on 
cracked conch, pigeon peas with rice and coconut cream pie at Angela's Starfish 
restaurant, at the north end of Dunmore Street, is one of life's most basic 
pleasures. A hunk of coconut bread and a cup of tea at the Island Bakery 
provide an afternoon lift. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, we rated Harbour Island hotel food generally mediocre and had 
many meals at Angela's. But the Dunmore Beach Club has since turned the dull 
food scene into a culinary triumph. Operated for over 25 years as an exclusive 
private club, Dunmore quietly opened to the public last winter. 
</P>
<P>
New owners Tony and Cynthia Shogren, both former member-guests, wanted to 
maintain the Dunmore reputation for first-class food and service. So they hired 
affable New Zealander John Philips and his chef-wife Kathy to manage the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Like the rest of Harbour Island, the 12-room cottage enclave has a seductive 
informality. There is an unassuming summer-house simplicity in the airy 
cottages, which feature spacious patio-decks that have inspiring ocean views. 
</P>
<P>
An atmospheric clubhouse serves as the restaurant, bar and focus for social 
activities. Wicker furnishings fill the library-living room, which offers card 
tables, a wide assortment of reading and a warm fireplace for winter nights. 
Dinners are served in the high-timbered dining room, breakfasts and lunches 
outdoors on a terrace overlooking Pink Sand Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Dunmore's daily rate of $250, double occupancy (all meals included), is far 
below what some fashionable Caribbean resorts charge. 
</P>
<P>
Other hotels are also small-scale and casual in keeping with the relaxed 
ambience of Harbour Island. Most are family-run and offer premium discounted 
rates during the off season, from mid-May to mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
Valentine's Yacht Club looks like a New England house set in the tropics. This 
21-room inn and marina has a loyal following of dive enthusiasts, and hires out 
boats for fishing, diving, sailing and water-skiing. Valentine's generous dock 
makes it a favorite rendezvous for yachts cruising the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
The nearby Romora Bay Club sprawls beyond the stone pillars and rusted cannons 
of a fort that once guarded the harbor. Created from a terraced old estate, 
Romora's cottages tuck into a tropical garden overlooking the harbor. This is 
another family-run resort keen on diving and water sports. Certified dive 
instructors offer a complete scuba program. 
</P>
<P>
Hotels on the Atlantic side, such as Dunmore, border the splendid Pink Sand 
Beach, three miles long and actually colored pink from eons of eroding offshore 
coral reefs. It's a dazzling strand that easily takes honors as the most 
beautiful beach in the Bahamas. And because Harbour Island hasn't become trendy 
yet, you may even have the translucent turquoise surf all to yourself. 
</P>
<P>
The Coral Sands Hotel has a beachside terrace, the Yellow Bird Bar, where 
guests can munch freshly toasted coconut curls and sip Goombay punch. 
</P>
<P>
Runaway Hill, once a secluded private home, perches on a bluff so that all 
eight of its rooms have sweeping ocean views. 
</P>
<P>
The reef-studded crystal waters surrounding Harbour Island are some of the 
finest in the world for snorkeling and scuba diving. Experienced guides take 
divers to exotic spots such as the Plateau to hand-feed big groupers, or to 
Whale Point for snorkeling in endless acres of bright coral sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
With its dramatic maritime history, the area is a treasure of sunken 
shipwrecks. Spanish galleons, pillaging pirates and blockade runners and 
bootleggers all have exploited the maze of hidden coves and channels. At 
Devil's Backbone, the treacherous reef north of Eleuthera, a graveyard of lost 
ships beckons adventuresome divers. 
</P>
<P>
Deep-sea fishing enthusiasts are enticed by yellow fin tuna, grouper, wahoo and 
both blue and white marlin. Sport fishermen from all over the world bring their 
fly-casting rods to stalk bonefish, the ultimate saltwater trophy. 
</P>
<P>
Bonefish Joe has been prowling the fertile flats around Harbour Island for four 
decades. A lively, cheerful man, his roots date back to colonial times, and his 
sportfishing techniques have been immortalized in how-to books and fishing 
videos. My husband, who is always on a quest for bonefish, loves Joe's lilting 
Bahamian chatter and constant coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"Shoot 30 feet straight at twelve o'clock," Joe might say. "Good! Hold it high. 
Reel! Now jig. Put your seat belt on for this baby! Boy, what a life!" His 
enthusiasm is contagious. 
</P>
<P>
Joe's body language is as expressive as his speech. He moves barefoot around 
the sides of his flat-bottomed skiff, his husky body pausing to arch over the 
shallows and scan the sun-drenched surface. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, as the skiff carved back across the mirrored harbor to Eleuthera, 
my husband looked wonderfully relaxed. We watched our receding paradise, and I 
wondered how much longer it would be before big developers come to stalk our 
island and bring in some glitzy resorts. 
</P>
<P>
We had better schedule lots more romantic interludes before our star hideaway 
gets all glittery.

Associates has listed 50 hotels in London at rates of $50 or less per person.

These hotels are in central London. Near underground/bus stops. Rooms must be

At Home in London: Four years ago, Londoner Maggie Dobson began enlisting a 
network of families (Kensington to Kew Gardens) to serve as bed and breakfast 
hosts in London after friends from abroad "despaired of finding a good place to 
stay in London without breaking the bank." Her list has grown to 60 families. 
Hosts include a banker, an attorney, a jeweler, journalists, an interior 
designer. Dobson steers guests to homes that appeal to personal requests. And 
for something totally different, she'll book you onto a houseboat moored on the 
Thames. Rates at these B&amp;Bs starting in January will begin at 18 single 
(about $36), 36 double, including booking fees, the usual full English 
breakfast.

Passports: While the number of Americans who will be traveling overseas in '91 
is anyone's guess, Sakae M. Hawley of the U.S. Passport Agency is encouraging 
travelers to apply for documents early. Her office gets crowded after Jan. 1. 
Long lines, long waits. Busy hours are noontime/late afternoon. Apply at the 
U.S. Passport Agency, 11000 Wilshire Blvd., 13th Floor, West Los Angeles.

Roman Holiday: I continue to get inquiries about my favorite pension in Rome, 
the Scalinata di Spagna. Lorraine Adams of Fontana is the latest caller. Says 
she lost the address. Write to Scalinata di Spagna, Piazza Trinita dei Monte 
17, 00187, Rome, Italy. The Scalinata is at the top of the Spanish Steps, 
directly across the piazza from the Hassler Hotel. Ten rooms. An excellent 
location, especially for shoppers. Several of Rome's finest clothing stores do 
business in this area. American Express operates an office at the bottom of the 
Spanish Steps. A number of good restaurants nearby. Ask the proprietors of the 
Scalinata for restaurant/shopping recommendations. (Be sure to visit the roof 
garden. Stunning views of the city.) The Scalinata is within walking distance 
of Piazza Navonna, Rome's loveliest square, as well as St. Peter's, other 
attractions.

San Francisco: A glowing report from Kristin Schwarz of Villa Park about the 
Juliana Hotel in San Francisco: "On a recent trip, the Juliana provided all the 
extras to make my business trip more like a mini-vacation -- things like a 
lighted makeup mirror and coffee makers in the room. Even limousine service to 
the Financial District. The hotel has a warm, homey feel -- all the charm of a 
B&amp;B with the pluses of a hotel. I have a new home away from home." Schwarz 
calls the Juliana the "perfect businesswoman's hotel." 
</P>
<P>
I checked it out by telephone. It's 1 1/2 blocks off Union Square, a block from 
Chinatown and a block from the Powell Street cable car that runs to Fisherman's 
Wharf. Rates: $107 single/double, $135 for junior suites. Corporate rates: 
$95/$125, including complimentary wine each evening, continental breakfast.

NEWS AND BRIEFS: REDISCOVERING THE U.S. AT WORLD'S FAIR IN SEVILLE

"Rediscover the U.S.A." is the theme for the United States' pavilion at the 
1992 World's Fair in Seville, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
The design for the $8-million pavilion features 50,000 square feet of 
exhibition space, gardens and a state-of-the-art theater. The pavilion is 
intended to be symbolic of Columbus' voyage across the Atlantic in 1492, and in 
keeping with the Expo '92 theme of "The Age of Discovery." 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, three sun shades in the form of sails rise above the pavilion, 
an allusion to Columbus' ships, and a 40-foot high waterfall cascades down the 
entranceway into a moat representing the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by Barton Myers Associates of Los Angeles, the pavilion will be 
prefabricated in the United States and shipped to Seville for completeion by 
April, 1992. The focus of its exhibits will be trade and tourism, with every 
state and major city invited to participate. 
</P>
<P>
Travel Quiz: Which city in Florida is home to Disney World? 
</P>
<P>
Nothing to Rail At: Penn Station in New York City has made life a little more 
comfortable for its more affluent travelers. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak passengers with first-class tickets can avail themselves of a new lounge 
that provides upholstered seating for 100 people, telephones and FAX machines, 
a refreshment counter with free coffee and soft drinks, as well as a reception 
desk and information where reservations can be made or changed. 
</P>
<P>
Hours are 5:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. on weekdays, 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. on weekends. 
The lounge is restricted to passengers carrying tickets for parlor car, 
club-service seats or sleeper space.

<P>
Quick Fact: There are one billion more Chinese in the world than there are 
Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
Dem Bones, Dem Bones: The most famous human fossils from Africa and Eurasia are 
on display in Brussels at the Palais des Beaux-Arts through Dec. 30, as part of 
an exhibition on human biological and cultural origins. About 200 original 
items, most never before displayed, are featured in this one-time exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
Highlights include bones of Australopithecus ("early man"); Homo habilis (the 
first to make tools), Pithecanthropus (discoverer of fire), Neanderthal and 
Cro-Magnon. The display also contains prehistoric art from France, Germany, 
Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
Quick Fact: According to Consumer Reports, there are 190 national or regional

</P>
<P>
Berlin Air Lift: Lufthansa begins daily direct service from the United States 
to Berlin starting today when the historic first flight leaves Newark, N.J., 
for Schonefeld Airport in what used to be East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
As an incentive to travelers, Lufthansa is offering a promotional fare of $399 
for the flight. The fare is good for travel beginning today and extending 
through Dec. 13. Tickets must be purchased by Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, Ya'll?: The nation of Myanmar, better known by its former name of 
Burma, has opened its first tourist office anywhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
And where did the Myanmarese choose to put it? New York City? London? Sydney? 
Wrong on all three. Instead, the office is in that crossroads of the world, 
Durham, N.C., which just happens to be the home of its managing director. 
</P>
<P>
To contact the office for information on travel to Myanmar -- visas have 
recently been extended from one week to two -- write to Myanmar National 
Tourist Office, 2514 University Drive, Durham, N.C. 27707, (919) 493-7500.

Smokescreen: Apparently bowing to pressure from smokers, Lufthansa has decided 
not to ban smoking on its domestic flights as originally planned. The airline 
cited fear of clashes between militant smokers and nonsmokers for its change of 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that federal lawmakers in Germany had failed to pass anti-smoking 
legislation, Lufthansa said banning smoking on its flights could lead to 
"polarization and confrontations among passengers." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ban, which Lufthansa earlier said was supported by 90% of those 
passengers it surveyed, was to have gone into effect today.

GRENADA'S UNSPOILED SPLENDOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER S. GREENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ST. GEORGES, Grenada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I'm sorry," said the jovial counter agent at the Barbados airport. "Your plane 
is late." 
</P>
<P>
Then again, the LIAT plane to Grenada is almost always late. 
</P>
<P>
"May I suggest an earlier flight?" 
</P>
<P>
An earlier one? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes. It arrives later. But I think you should take it, because the later 
flight will probably be very late. Don't worry," he said with a smile. "You'll 
get there. It's worth the wait." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, he was right on all counts. 
</P>
<P>
If you're going to Grenada to find a Caribbean fantasy of discos, casinos or 
singles clubs, you're out of luck. You go to Grenada to find yourself. 
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly one of the most beautiful and quiet countries in the Caribbean, 
Grenada is graced with large expanses of untouched beaches and unpolluted 
waters. And it is a place where tourists need not worry about robbery, violence 
or invasion by hostile foreign troops. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans still want to know if Grenada is safe," says one U.S. Embassy 
official about the small island country that the United States invaded in 1983. 
"It couldn't be safer. And tourism is still in its infancy, which contributes 
greatly to the island's beauty. Grenada is the way the Caribbean used to be. No 
high-rises, no condos." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the country was quiet, beautiful and slow before Oct. 25, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, the tiny isle of spice was a bizarre combination of palm trees 
and paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
Its prime minister, a protege of Cuba's Fidel Castro, had just been overthrown 
in a military coup and the island's fate seemed to hang between political 
moderates and hard-line Marxists. About 1,000 U.S. citizens were residing on 
the island, including students at St. George's University School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan, at the request of the Organization of Eastern 
Caribbean States, sent 1,900 U.S. troops in an air "rescue" invasion of the 
island, which is situated 100 miles off the coast of Venezuela and 12 degrees 
north of the Equator. 
</P>
<P>
The fighting lasted only a few days. Some American medical students were 
brought out. By Dec. 24, the troops had left and parliamentary elections were 
held the following year. 
</P>
<P>
But what about tourism? 
</P>
<P>
Today, most visitors are pleasantly surprised when they arrive in this 
southernmost of the Windward Islands. 
</P>
<P>
"They go about asking 'What happened?' " says one Grenadian. 
</P>
<P>
They can't believe there are no soldiers and no fast-food restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
In a departure from the norm, the U.S. invasion was not immediately followed by 
a huge influx of dollars, tourists and American industry. 
</P>
<P>
There were some attempts. A little more than two months after the invasion, the 
Reagan Administration tried to assemble an economic aid program for Grenada 
funded by the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
The President's Task Force on Private Sector Initiatives muscled U.S. companies 
to contribute to the cause of rebuilding Grenada. On the first relief flight 
into Grenada, there were 15 cases of first-aid and hygiene items. 
</P>
<P>
The cargo also included 48,000 pounds of Mounds and Almond Joy candy bars, 
2,000 pairs of blue jeans and 344 cases of Life Savers. 
</P>
<P>
But the United States can be credited with completing the Cuban-built airport. 
And America has invested more than $100 million in 300 miles of new road 
construction and repair, in helping rebuild decaying phone lines and electrical 
services. Even some nature trails have been built by Peace Corps volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
There's a new power plant, a new phone system and a new water system -- all of 
importance to tourists, not to mention Grenadians. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly -- some say too slowly -- the roads are being repaved. St. George's 
medical school is now quiet, and the only bodies being discovered are inside 
the anatomy department. 
</P>
<P>
"First time here?" asked the taxi driver. "Want to see the bullet holes? I can 
take you there. How about the medical school? I can show you where it all 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
About the only reminder that a small war was once fought in this independent 
British Commonwealth nation can be found on a small hill in the village of 
Tempe near the Coca-Cola bottling plant. 
</P>
<P>
Grenadians call it the Wall of Thanks: 40 feet of painted cinder-block that 
proclaims "Thank God for U.S.", "Thank You U.S.A. for Liberating Us." Below it 
is a warning, "KGB Behave!" The wall was hand-painted shortly after the 
invasion as a message to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Besides its history, one of the great things about Grenada is that it's last on 
my list of shoppers' paradises. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to buy a tacky souvenir or, for that matter, anything else, there's 
not much to choose from. You're forced to endure the beauty of any one of 45 
beaches that surround an island that's only 12 miles wide and 21 miles long. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the problems here," says one counselor for economic affairs at the U.S. 
Embassy, "is that Americans love to shop and there's so little to buy here." 
Still, tourism is the No. 2 industry in the country, right behind the 
production of nutmeg, cocoa and bananas. 
</P>
<P>
And, slowly, it is increasing. Most of the increase is the result of 
word-of-mouth endorsements from returning Americans who came to Grenada and got 
exactly what they paid for: rest and relaxation. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism was up 11% in 1989 and is expected to rise another 11% this year. 
</P>
<P>
That's been helped in part by the announcement earlier this year that American 
Airlines would become the first U.S. carrier to fly to Grenada. Daily flights 
from American's hub in San Juan started June 23 on a 139-seat 727. 
</P>
<P>
Cruise ship traffic has also soared by 56% above 1989's total. "Many of the 
people who come here on cruise ships," says Joan Purcell, Grenada's minister of 
tourism, "come back for longer stays. Even some U.S. Marines who were here in 
'83 have come back with their families. They first saw the island as soldiers. 
Now they come back to vacation." 
</P>
<P>
What do they find? 
</P>
<P>
Miles of unspoiled powder-white beaches. Great snorkeling and diving, tennis 
courts, hiking trails and charter boats. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the restaurants on the island are good -- not great -- but what makes 
them particularly attractive is that they don't suffer from an attitude problem 
that has hurt some of the more developed islands. 
</P>
<P>
And there are still no crowds. In fact, Grenada has slightly more than 1,100 
hotel rooms on hand, and that's if you count every available bed, including 
guest houses and transient apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodations range from the expensive Spice Island Inn (luxury beachfront 
suites complete with private pool) for $350 per night to the more modest No 
Problem Apartments at $65 a night (both double occupancy). 
</P>
<P>
On Carriacou, Grenada's sister isle in the Grenadines, there's the Silver Beach 
resort -- a small, elegant, 18-room hotel on the beach. Only $80 per day, 
double occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
Charter sailboats rent at Go Vacations on Prickly Bay for $249 per day for a 
30-foot boat, and $439 for a 45-footer. 
</P>
<P>
How long will the good, quiet times last for visitors to Grenada? 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, representatives from Hyatt, Hilton and other large chains surveyed the 
island, but no major developments have yet been announced. 
</P>
<P>
One of the items still on the government's agenda is to paint over the Wall of 
Thanks. "It's a reminder of the past we'd like to erase," says one government 
tourist official. "As you can see, we're a little behind schedule. We really 
should get somebody out there and do it. Soon," he said, smiling. "Soon." 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe not. After all, things move slowly in Grenada, America's 
not-really-adopted island. And, for the most part, that's still good news.

Getting there: American Airlines flies from Los Angeles to San Juan, Puerto 
Rico, with connecting flights to St. Thomas. Pan Am and Eastern fly to St. 
Thomas via Miami. Delta flies to San Juan via Atlanta, with connecting flights 
to St. Thomas. Round-trip fares range from $552 to $902.

THE TIMES SHOPPER: CARVING OUT TRADITION IN LAPLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

JUKKASJARVI, Sweden 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lars-Johannes Svonni grasped a piece of snow-white reindeer horn in one hand 
and a razor sharp, short-bladed knife in the other. After a moment of studying, 
he etched a small circle into the horn. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always interested in carving," Svonni said. "When I was 4 years old, I 
watched my father make knives and tried to imitate him. I couldn't cut the horn 
because I wasn't strong enough, and because the knife I had wasn't as sharp as 
the one I have now. I was a teen-ager before I succeeded. Even though the 
carving was rough, it was the proudest day of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Svonni is heir to the ancient craft tradition of the Sami, the people 
indigenous to Lapland, an area covering parts of Sweden, Norway, Finland and 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Until the early 1900s, the Sami (formerly called Lapps) were migratory. Living 
in tents, they followed reindeer herds from winter grazing areas to summer 
mating grounds. 
</P>
<P>
They made all necessities with their own hands; craftsmanship was essential to 
survival. Reindeer were their main source of material -- skins were sewn into 
clothing, and antlers were carved into knives, buttons, small salt containers 
and needles. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Sami live in modern homes in towns scattered across Lapland. 
Approximately 10% of the Sami (about 60,000 in all) still make their living as 
full-time reindeer herders. They do so with snow mobiles, helicopters and other 
high-tech tools. 
</P>
<P>
But a growing number -- Svonni among them -- are earning their living by 
continuing the crafts tradition learned from previous generations of artists. 
</P>
<P>
Now in his 30s, artist Svonni learned basic carving techniques from his father, 
Olof-Tomas Svonni, a famous knife-maker from Ovre Soppero. He then attended a 
government-sponsored Sami crafts school to complete his education. Although 
he's been making knives and bowls for years, he began to work full-time as a 
craftsman just two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Making a traditional knife or birch bowl can take months. 
</P>
<P>
A tremendous amount of work goes into cutting, shaping and smoothing the 
elements for a knife. 
</P>
<P>
The Handle and sheath are each made of separate pieces that are fitted around 
the steel blade. When artisans pattern knife handles by alternating rings of 
horn and birch wood, fitting everything together requires puzzle-solving 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
Some craftsmen work freehand, others sketch elaborate patterns on the horn 
before they cut into the surface. Some cut through the surface to make 
delicate, lace-like patterns. Quality of the etching is usually judged by the 
quality of the lines; thin, even lines are most difficult to produce. 
</P>
<P>
Lars-Johannes (telephone 011-46-980-21420) and two other notable young artists 
from Jukkasjarvi -- Hans-Mickel Sunna (011-46-980-82878) and Bengt-Ake Marakat 
(011-46-980-82852) -- occasionally invite prospective buyers to their studios, 
but they also sell their work through craft shops in nearby Kiruna, Sweden's 
northernmost city. 
</P>
<P>
Prices at the shops are slightly higher, but they often have stock when the 
artists themselves might not. 
</P>
<P>
Kiruna's craft shops have Sweden's best and biggest supply of reindeer horn art 
and other Sami crafts. 
</P>
<P>
Hemslojden Kiruna (Meschplan 3, 011-46-980-10401) and Kiruna Sameslojd (Mommag 
3, 011-46-980-17835) are well-stocked, but Wennberg AB (Bergmastareg 6, 
011-46-980-10079) is best because the owners can help you get special pieces. 
</P>
<P>
At Wennberg, horn knives are from about $100 to $1,000, with knives by Svonni 
from about $300, by Hans-Mickel Sunna from about $250 and by Bengt-Ake for 
about $230. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, Wennberg has items made by Lars Pirak, a famous Sami artist who 
lives in the Jokkmokk area. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve miles north of Kiruna, Rautasslojd Atelje has a fine selection of 
outstanding knives and bowls. Those made by the acclaimed artist Olav Svonni 
sell for about $1,000 to $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
Svonni and two colleagues, Esaias Poggat (from Gallivare, roughly midway 
between Kiruna and Jokkmokk) and Martin Kvorak (from Jokkmokk) were recently 
recognized as Lapland's leading Sami artisans in a special exhibition of their 
work in Jokkmokk at Ajtte (Kyrkogatan 3, 011-46-791/170 70), an important Sami 
museum.

Diving essentials: About 15 local dive shops make regular trips to Stingray 
City and Sandbar. Two reputable shops are Bob Soto's Diving Ltd. (800-262-7686 
or, in Cayman, 809-949-2022), which arranges the Desert Divers' stingray dive, 
and Don Foster's Dive Grand Cayman (800-833-4837 or 809-949-5679). Make 
reservations for stingray dives; they are crowded and do not leave every day. 
Many dive shops also offer snorkeling excursions for $25. Diving is year-round, 
and a wet suit is unnecessary since the water temperature is about 80 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals can arrange their own stingray dives. All rental equipment is 
available, with regulators and buoyancy compensators costing about $10 each and 
masks, fins and snorkels about $7.50. 
</P>
<P>
Getting around: Living in Cayman is expensive but there are ways to economize. 
For starters, rent a car. Compact cars cost about $150 a week and while mopeds 
are available, they are risky. Most streets have no shoulders and mopeds take a 
back seat to anything with four wheels. With cars, the only thing to master is 
driving on the left side of the road. 
</P>
<P>
Where to stay: Hotels range from standard ($75 minimum) to deluxe ($150 to $200 
high season, Dec. 15 to April 15; $125-$150 off-season). 
</P>
<P>
Standard accommodations can be found at the Cayman Islander, West Bay Road, 
Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, (800) 262-7686, and the Sunset House, Box 479, 
Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, (800) 854-4767 or (809) 949-7111. 
</P>
<P>
Some top-of-the-line hotels include the Hyatt Brittania, Holiday Inn, Seven 
Mile Beach, Grand Cayman and British West Indies. 
</P>
<P>
If you're traveling with friends, condominiums are a way to save. Two-bedroom 
condos that sleep four go for $150-$200 a night. One-bedrooms cost about $100. 
For reservations, call Grand Cayman Reservations at (800) 327-8777 or 
Hospitality World of Grand Cayman at (800) 232-1034. 
</P>

THE AD GAME: HOW TO SWAY 7% OF THE VOTERS THROUGH RAZZMATAZZ.; 
</P>
<P>
IMPACT: IT'S WHERE ADVERTISING RUNS THAT COUNTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Television executives who do lunch and nervously watch the overnights are using 
some hot new buzzwords this season. Media moguls and industry researchers are 
heavy into "fragmentation" and "niche programming." And -- for better or worse 
-- political campaigning is dependent on media. So candidates, pundits, voters 
and reporters had better pay attention, too. 
</P>
<P>
It may be that, in the debate over the use of mass media in election campaigns, 
critics and reformers have been ignoring a key point. They have concerned 
themselves with the impact of negative ads and of the high cost of television 
time needed to air them. But, as one veteran television executive argued, the 
question of where candidates put their advertising may be as important as how 
much it costs and what it looks like. 
</P>
<P>
As of last year, half of U. S. households could choose from more than 30 TV 
channels. With so many selections, the viewing audience has become fragmented, 
each segment reflecting different characteristics, interests, and lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
That's where niche programming comes in. As a recent Times article explained 
it, "Niche programming works this way: Think small. Spend less. Find your place 
in television's universe with very specific programs, for . . . very specific, 
dedicated viewers." 
</P>
<P>
Let's look at what that means, "politics-wise." 
</P>
<P>
California has seen this year's gubernatorial campaigns driven by the need for 
candidates to raise gargantuan amounts of money, largely to advertise on 
commercial television. 
</P>
<P>
The irony is that, while campaigns continue to be media-driven, the intensity 
of media's impact may have lessened. Fragmentation, niche programming and the 
economics of television news all have worked to reduce the access of campaigns 
to voters and the access of voters to political information. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates are spending time on the phone, raising money for messages they can 
control, rather than bouncing around the state, visiting local media outlets. 
That means less information is available for news feeds. 
</P>
<P>
Tight budgets and little viewer pressure for political news have shrunk 
television's campaign coverage. This season, local stations have bumped 
California political stories in favor of coverage of erupting national and 
international events. 
</P>
<P>
A proliferation of viewing choices -- especially cable, videocassette recorders 
and remote controls -- has expanded viewers' media options. Californians who 
never want to see or hear another piece of political information can easily 
screen it out with the switch of the dial or a touch of the fast-forward 
button. 
</P>
<P>
What may be politically significant is that mass-media defectors tend to be 
better-off and better educated -- not unlike the profile of the high-propensity 
voter. If voters are getting less information from the media and not getting it 
elsewhere, where are they learning their politics? 
</P>
<P>
This election season, the pattern has been that candidates have telescoped 
their paid media campaigns into a few commercials that air repeatedly during 
the last month or so of the campaign, when voters tend to focus some attention 
on political ads. 
</P>
<P>
That is why the spot that propelled Dianne Feinstein ahead of her Democratic 
primary opponent has been recycled for the general election campaign. The 
voters, her campaign explained, needed to be re-acquainted with her. 
</P>
<P>
That is why campaign advertising tends to focus on what the National Journal 
calls hot-button issues -- "images, pictures and ideas with the power to appeal 
to the most voters in the least time." 
</P>
<P>
In California, that has translated into spots on crime and the death penalty. 
They send the message that both candidates are tough. And ads that focus on 
education and crack babies project an image of caring. 
</P>
<P>
Conventional wisdom has it that the news media have more influence on voters 
than paid media. It is also gospel that most voters get their news from the 
electronic media. 
</P>
<P>
That's why, before economics led stations to lift their ban on political 
advertising during news programming, a so-called "news adjacency" was coveted 
by the candidates and their media buyers. 
</P>
<P>
That's why "reality spots," using actual news clips and headlines to bolster a 
candidate's image -- or to lend credibility to his or her charges -- are 
prominent in this campaign. That technique was used to blunt Democrat 
Feinstein's attack linking her Republican gubernatorial rival, Pete Wilson, to 
the savings-and-loan crisis. A TV spot by the Wilson campaign highlighted 
newspaper criticism -- including that of The Times -- of Feinstein's charges. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent New York Times article, Feinstein media consultant Hank Morris 
extolled "docu-commercials," which he defined as "pieces of actual, real 
history." Big deal. Biographical spots have been a staple of campaign politics 
forever. What makes them so special in this campaign is that they are the major 
source of information about the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
If there is more "truth" in political advertising now than there has been, as 
the New York Times article argues, it is because campaigns have to expose 
voters to more information about their candidates in less time -- and because 
the news media aren't doing that for them. 
</P>
<P>
What little is known about the accuracy of these ads comes from the "truth 
boxes" in which major newspapers critique TV spots. But how many voters read 
them? How much time is left for that "boring political stuff" after catching up 
with Iraq, Bush, Doonesbury and the Raiders? 
</P>
<P>
The reality is that, for most Californians, print media has become almost 
superfluous to the campaign process. Candidates spend next to nothing on print 
ads. And voters choose to get even less political information from print than 
they do from electronic media. 
</P>
<P>
Stories in the daily newspapers are important more for their impact on 
potential contributors and TV assignment editors than they are for informing 
the average citizen. 
</P>
<P>
For politics, the lesson of the media revolution is that candidates and causes 
will have to target potential voters where they view -- whether it is ESPN for 
sports, MTV for the music-video crowd, or Lifetime for women's programming. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the "Big Green" environmental initiative created a stir with a 
star-studded 30-minute video aimed at specific cable markets. There will be 
more of that. Soon, predicted one cable executive, a campaign's media buyer 
will be as important as its creative team. 
</P>
<P>
Media mogul Rupert Murdoch talks about bundled media as the wave of the future. 
A package of advertising is put together that utilizes several media to hit a 
specific audience. That, too, has implications for future political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of approach requires retail politics; it will cost more than playing 
politics wholesale in the mass media. Look for political advertising packages 
that will use targeted television and radio, voter slates, direct mail and 
videotapes to supplement -- or to replace -- both paid and unpaid mass media. 
Campaign messages will be narrowcast rather than broadcast. As a result, 
information may be less visible and accessible. 
</P>
<P>
Segmenting political information has other risks. Where is there a place to 
view a candidate's grand vision? What happens to the need to establish 
political priorities and a policy agenda? Will politicians find themselves 
locked into pandering to narrow special-interest groups? How can one distill 
the public good from a hundred different messages? 
</P>
<P>
For the average voter, the media revolution means that the window of political 
information continues to close. Many of us want it that way. But others are 
victims of the changing demographics of communication. 
</P>
<P>
We are never going to get rid of media. We can't -- and shouldn't -- in this 
complex global village. In the end, it is the responsibility of voters to 
demand enough information to make reasoned political decisions. And then to use 
that information to cast their ballots. That has always been the democratic 
ideal. It's just that sometimes we're too lazy to make the system work. 
</P>
<P>
This season, niche programming may motivate at least one segment of our 
fragmented voting population. Listen to MTV's Madonna, in her youth-targeted 
"Rock the Vote" ad: "If you don't vote, you're going to get a spankie." 
</P>
<P>
Hey, whatever works. Ciao, baby.

Sorry, folks, the Feinstein-Wilson gubernatorial made-for-television campaign 
probably was not meant for you. The scripted words and images, the issues and 
positions the candidates take on them, the charges and countercharges, the 
smiles and frowns -- all were created by political consultants for a mere 7% of 
California's eligible voters. It's the consultants' dirty little secret. 
</P>
<P>
The consultants know that 80% of the voters who will go to the polls made up 
their mind before the campaign even got under way. They'll vote Democratic or 
Republican no matter what Dianne Feinstein or Pete Wilson say or do. That 
leaves roughly 1.5 million voters open to political persuasion -- or 7% of the 
state's eligible 19 million. 
</P>
<P>
They are Democrats who voted for Ronald Reagan; Republicans who care about the 
environment and continued government funding of abortions. They want a 
conservative hand on the judicial helm; a business approach to state budgeting. 
They will be compassionate toward the poor -- if the budget can afford it. They 
wouldn't mind a little political excitement if the candidate can be trusted. 
</P>
<P>
The Feinstein-Wilson campaigns will spend, collectively, an unprecedented $20 
million on television ads in attempts to sway these voters. That comes out to 
roughly $13 a vote. When you factor in other campaign costs -- like the 
salaries of those who make the TV ads -- it's about $30 a vote. (Next time, Mr. 
or Ms. Candidate, write me a check.) 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, Feinstein's media strategists sought to overcome the 
stereotype that women can handle legislative work, but not executive jobs like 
governor. At the same time, they wanted to underline her gender and spotlight 
her bold, natural style. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was burdened with the widespread perception that he was just another 
boring, white male in pursuit of a more powerful political job. To overcome it, 
his handlers devised commercials depicting the senator as a "tough, but caring" 
politician who knew his away around government and had his priorities straight. 
</P>
<P>
The greater problem facing the two candidates' strategists was how to undermine 
the opponent -- the sine qua non of political advertising. Indeed, a lot of 
political mush and half-truths have been aired in this year's television ad 
campaign because neither Wilson nor Feinstein could come up with a "silver 
bullet." In the Democratic primary campaign, Feinstein possessed such a magic 
bullet -- her opponent's refusal, as Los Angeles County district attorney, to 
prosecute Angelo Buono for murder in the Hillside Strangler case on the ground 
that he lacked sufficient evidence. The attorney general's office, of course, 
eventually stepped in and got the conviction with largely the same evidence. 
This fundamental flaw in John K. Van de Kamp's political profile was so 
horrific, judged Feinstein's media managers, that a TV ad reminding voters of 
it would surely sway the undecided to her. 
</P>
<P>
Ahead in the polls, Feinstein kept the "Strangler" ad on the shelf until the 
last days of the primary campaign, when a fading Van de Kamp had to go on the 
attack. The Feinstein campaign bought $500,000 of air time from Thursday to the 
last Sunday before the voting. The average TV viewer probably saw the 30-second 
spot at least four times. 
</P>
<P>
Such flaws as Van de Kamp's prosecutorial ineptness are usually old pieces of 
information long forgotten by the public -- until brought to life in the 
editing bay. If a campaign manager finds a silver bullet and has enough money 
to sustain fire, the prospects for victory increase exponentially. 
</P>
<P>
Which is precisely why a well-financed candidate like Wilson has spent a lot of 
campaign energy and treasury this year on -- if you will -- silver-bullet 
research. His chief media consultant, Larry McCarthy, was the creator of the 
first Willie Horton ad that so effectively wounded Michael S. Dukakis in the 
'88 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, there was air time to fill, and Wilson's image-makers had to overcome 
the senator's nondescript personality. The solution: Tell the 7% of voters in 
play what he'd done and what he intended to do for them -- his "vision." 
Wilson's "vision" spot -- including images of him walking the beach to draw 
attention to his opposition to offshore oil drilling -- stressed the idea that 
fiscal frugality and accomplishment are not incompatible. While mayor of San 
Diego, the ad proclaims, Wilson balanced the budget and built the San Diego 
trolley. Thus, Wilson-the-businesslike-moderate was born. 
</P>
<P>
As for Feinstein, an early campaign memo had advised the former San Francisco 
mayor that the solution to the "perception within the voting community that 
women are somehow less able to lead and administer" was to "recall the state of 
turmoil and emotional upheaval that the assassinations (of Mayor George Moscone 
and Supervisor Harvey Milk) caused in (San Francisco) government." Thus was 
born the most memorable ad -- to date -- of the '90 governor's race: 
Feinstein's "forged in tragedy" ad. 
</P>
<P>
It used news footage of the events surrounding the 1979 assassinations, thus 
enhancing its credibility. It compellingly conveyed Feinstein's ability to 
bring "order out of chaos." Indeed, the ad -- created by Feinstein's media 
manager Hank Morris and campaign manager Bill Carrick -- overshadowed every 
other commercial she used in the primary and, amazingly, the memory of it 
carried over into the first month of the general campaign when she didn't have 
enough money to run commercials. Most important, it defined Feinstein as a 
woman who could handle the job of governor. 
</P>
<P>
The next TV ad volley involved the savings-and-loan crisis, which gained 
widespread attention last summer. Aware that a Northern California newspaper 
was about to publish a story linking her husband, Dick Blum, to a part interest 
in a failed Oregon S&amp;L, Feinstein's campaign quickly assembled and bought 
time for an ad attacking Wilson for having accepted $243,000 in campaign 
contributions from the thrift industry. The ad sought both to "inoculate" her 
from the S&amp;L disease and "muddy the water" by dragging Wilson into the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson campaign manager George Gorton and media consultant McCarthy responded 
with an ad criticizing Feinstein and Blum for profitting from the federal 
bailout of the Oregon S&amp;L. Then Feinstein taped a commercial in which she 
spoke directly into the camera, defending herself and her husband while 
decrying Wilson's charges. 
</P>
<P>
Until this ad, Feinstein had been a candidate largely unblemished by 
politics-as-usual. While there was little else she could have done -- the 
lesson of the Willie Horton ad was that you couldn't let an attack go 
unanswered -- the back and forth of the S&amp;L ads signaled that Feinstein may 
be just another politician in a year when voters loved to hate politicians. 
</P>
<P>
"The real lesson of this campaign," Carrick recently recalled, "is that the 
paid media didn't matter. We began with 40-40-20 -- and are still there." 
</P>
<P>
Translation: With two weeks to go, 20% of the voters were still undecided 
because nothing airing on television was working. 
</P>
<P>
You can always tell when a candidate is floundering -- he or she returns to a 
familiar, proven theme. Feinstein signaled her troubles when her new political 
advertising used the dramatic music of the "tragedy" ad. But not only was the 
message associated with that ad beginning to wear thin; its repetition created 
an impression that Feinstein had nothing more to offer. 
</P>
<P>
Sensing this, Carrick thought up the flap about Wilson's absences from the U.S. 
Senate during the budget crisis, played it out in the "free media," then put 
together a television ad symbolizing the theme with an empty chair. The Wilson 
camp, anticipating the ad, began emphasizing the senator's attendance record 
four days before the Feinstein ad aired. 
</P>
<P>
More interesting, with respect to the ad game, was the Wilson campaign's choice 
of timing to air its ad defending the senator. Call it the "Friday sneak-attack 
inoculation." In other words, the ad's message went unchallenged for three, 
maybe four days, simply because TV ad departments are closed on weekends. 
Feinstein had to wait until the following Monday or Tuesday, depending on each 
station's internal schedule, to rebut the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Feinstein used the same tactic. In what will become known as the 
"gurney" ad, Wilson is shown in a still photograph being wheeled, after an 
emergency appendectomy operation, into the Senate to cast a tie-breaking Senate 
vote, in 1985, on Social Security COLAs. The ad is titled "Bob," after 
Republican Leader Bob Dole, whose sarcastic and funny comments -- "(Wilson) 
does better under sedation" -- imply that Wilson can be manipulated to vote for 
special interests. Like Feinstein's "tragedy" ad, "Bob" will be memorable. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, memorable ads don't necessarily sway that crucial 7%. But if you're 
one of the 93%, press the remote control this weekend for "Masterpiece Theatre" 
or wrestling or whatever. You won't be missing a thing.

POLITICS: WITH THE PRESIDENT'S PLUNGE IN THE POLLS, WASHINGTON INSIDERS CAN 
SMELL BLOOD IN THE WATER. SOME PREDICT HE IS 'DEAD MEAT' IN 1992. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even Washington -- where residents can smell blood in the water faster than a 
hungry shark -- is struggling to assess the extraordinary decline in 
credibility of the President of the United States. In the wicked but 
descriptive words of Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.), "George Bush is in deep 
Sununu." 
</P>
<P>
After eight weeks of glory, shaping what he called a "New World Order" around 
the multinational force in Saudi Arabia, Bush came unglued this month. His 
politics seemed to defend tax breaks for the rich before pursuing the larger 
national interest of deficit reduction. Bush's approval ratings have dropped 
from 75%-80% to 50%-55% in just a month -- the sharpest decline anyone can 
remember without a scandal. 
</P>
<P>
As GOP prospects plunge, top party strategists are openly predicting 
disappointment in the Nov. 6 elections -- ending realignment hopes. Talk of 
Bush being "Carterized" -- Washington's ultimate put-down -- is in the air, his 
reelection is considered increasingly doubtful and top White House staffers 
such as Chief of Staff John H. Sununu have become jokes on Capitol Hill. One 
influential magazine has called on Secretary of State James A. Baker III to 
resign for mishandling the events leading up to Iraq's August invasion of 
Kuwait. There are even signs of unraveling public support for the U.S. military 
presence in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, however, the careful observer must draw back with the caveat 
"Yes, but . . . . " -- in this case "Yes, but things could change." 
</P>
<P>
They did for Jimmy Carter. In autumn, 1979, after Washington had snickered for 
two years and Carter's approval had dropped below 30%, an overlapping pair of 
foreign-policy crises -- Iran's seizure of the U.S. Embassy staff in Tehran as 
hostages and the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan -- boosted the 
embattled chief executive's rating back into the solid 60s. The fact that he 
was fumbling and fading again by spring did not change the opportunities of 
autumn. 
</P>
<P>
Presidents, especially those like Bush, with foreign-policy skills, cannot be 
prematurely counted out. Nonetheless, Bush -- like the "one-hoss shay" in 
Oliver Wendell Holmes' famous poem -- is on the verge of falling apart in all 
directions almost simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
The linchpin, of course, has been Bush's lack of leadership in the 
deficit-reduction confrontation. His inept strategy and flip attitude -- that 
famous "read my hips" crack while jogging -- let Democrats stay one step ahead, 
relentlessly telling voters how Bush's demands and delays put helping the rich 
ahead of dealing with the deficit. This was the devastating context in which 
the President's ratings plummeted 20 points in as many days. The Persian Gulf 
President let himself become the Palm Beach President, as Democrats looked on 
in happy disbelief and Republicans in nervous horror. 
</P>
<P>
The problem for Republicans is that this is not a one-shot failure. Bush's 
dithering has confirmed the Democrats in a 1990-92 strategy of targeting the 
GOP as defenders of the rich -- a proven Republican Achilles' heel dating back 
to the days of populism and William Jennings Bryan a century ago. Indeed, the 
possibility of a new economic populism has worried Bush strategists since 1988, 
and now, even without a specific Democratic presidential candidate fitting the 
bill, the 1990s are beginning to look like a decade with a populist leitmotif. 
</P>
<P>
Class warfare is a misnomer. There is almost no serious precedent in U.S. 
politics. But if class lines are too blurry a battleground, popular or populist 
insurgencies against political and economic elites have a long history -- and 
the Democrats now raising this issue are harnessing a powerful tradition that 
could discomfort Bush for the rest of his White House tenure. The question is 
how much. For populism and anger over economic fairness to move into high gear, 
four provocations have been necessary: 
</P>
<P>
First, there has to be a national economic downturn -- the worse it gets, the 
greater the reaction against the policies and failures of the allied political 
and economic elites in charge. This may be under way. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the public has to see capitalism losing its creative, entrepreneurial 
credentials and tilting more toward speculation, manipulation and greed. With 
Michael Milken, Charles H. Keating Jr. and Neil Bush so much in the headlines, 
this transition is already in process. 
</P>
<P>
Third, voters have to have a sense that the rich have been getting a lot more 
money a lot faster than everyone else -- and, in this respect, statistics for 
the late 1980s are compelling. 
</P>
<P>
Last, the public has to perceive that the ruling Washington elite has helped 
the rich with unfair preferences. This is why Bush and the Republicans have so 
hurt themselves by putting such emphasis on upper-bracket tax breaks. Voters' 
worst suspicions are being confirmed, at the most inopportune time. 
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, it's not surprising that Washington observers, 
including many heartsick GOP strategists, see not just Bush's ratings but also 
any larger Republican opportunity for realignment disintegrating before their 
eyes. Liberal critics may talk about "Carterization" or, like the New Republic, 
call for Baker's resignation. Republicans, however, feel a special pain. 
</P>
<P>
Even during the September budget summit, congressional Republicans had begun 
likening Sununu, Budget Director Richard G. Darman and Treasury Secretary 
Nicholas F. Brady to "Larry, Moe and Curly" -- the Three Stooges. Ed Rollins, 
co-chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, has been 
telling the press that Sununu and Darman have been politically insensitive, 
leaving Republicans in Congress to pay the price. 
</P>
<P>
It could be a stiff price. The NRCC's own polls show Republican 
self-identification among voters dropping 10-12 percentage points during 
October -- a stunning decline. Unless the election produces a lot of pleasant 
surprises, it's hard to imagine congressional Republicans ever fully trusting 
or relying on the Bush White House again -- the same disastrous attitude that 
Democrats developed toward Carter. Some congressional Republicans are already 
describing Bush as "dead meat" in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there's growing reason to wonder whether Bush may not be losing his 
leverage in the Persian Gulf, too. In the wake of a recent CBS news poll 
showing domestic support for Bush's handling of the gulf crisis dropping to 
just 57%, there have been parallel signs of dissension among the allies 
confronting Saddam Hussein. Even Saudi Arabia appears more conciliatory, 
hinting Hussein could receive territorial concessions in return for withdrawing 
from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Any such settlement would cast real doubt on Bush's strategy in the Persian 
Gulf, leaving him out on a limb in terms of U.S domestic politics. For now, the 
President's reply is more hawkishness -- he's insisting no compromise is 
possible and he's broadening his comparison between Hussein and Adolf Hitler by 
likening Iraqi troops in Kuwait to the Nazi Death's Head regiment in Poland 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Time magazine, for its part, has noted speculation that cracks in the anti-Iraq 
coalition are pushing the United States to consider an attack, and a French 
paper reported an attack could come before the election. In any case, the gulf 
crisis could be on its way to becoming the international political equivalent 
of the embarrassing budget summit. 
</P>
<P>
Two-and-a-half years ago, some Republicans -- this writer included -- suggested 
the best GOP strategy in the 1988 presidential election was to lose. Let the 
Democrats get back into the White House just in time to hold the bag as the 
bills for the dead-end speculation economics of the 1980s came due. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last year or so -- especially after seeming triumphs, such as the 
invasion of Panama and capture of Manuel A. Noreiga -- GOP politicians laughed 
at these forebodings and revelled in possible benefits from the Bush 
presidency. But now, as October takes on the color of a political Halloween, 
Republicans find their "what might have been" reveries drifting back to the 
once-in-a-generation GOP political opportunity that existed in 1988 -- the 
election of Michael S. Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
Just imagine. If Dukakis -- who has become a laughingstock even in his home 
state -- were in the White House, odds are that the Democratic Party would be 
facing a November blood bath. GOP senators and congressmen musing on these 
fates believe that Republicans running against a Dukakis White House would be 
about to regain control of the Senate, add 25-30 seats in the House and achieve 
a major voice in 1991 redistricting. Instead, the despondent National 
Republican Congressional Committee is putting out memos on how party candidates 
can run away from Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, Bush has recovered from weakness before, and he has at least 12 
months to do so again. But for now, Washington's vultures are beginning to 
think about what could be another political death watch.

PUTTING WOMEN'S EDUCATION TO WORK COULD ENRICH U.S. ECONOMY ; 
</P>
<P>
COMPETITION: AMERICA HAS THE BEST EDUCATED FEMALE WORK FORCE IN THE WORLD; NOW 
IT MUST GET SMART AND USE THAT TALENT FULLY.

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The economic pundits are fingering their worry beads and pronouncing the doom 
of the United States' work force. It will be wholly eclipsed, say columnists in 
publications ranging from Newsweek to Barron's, by those of other advanced 
post-industrial nations. We are unprepared for the upheavals and opportunities 
of a global economy, this school of thought would teach us, and ultimately our 
standard of living will fall. 
</P>
<P>
Reality teaches something else: If we play it right, if economic justice can 
determine economic strategy, the women of the United States will make the 
difference. We will not be eclipsed. If we play it right -- and just. 
</P>
<P>
The United States will enter the next century with a remarkable edge over its 
global competitors. U.S. women, of all races, are the best educated and trained 
in the world. They will constitute 64% of the new entrants to the work force 
over the next 10 years. U.S. women now comprise more than half of enrollees and 
degree recipients at all levels of higher education -- except the doctorate. In 
contrast, women constitute only 42% of higher education enrollees in what was 
West Germany and 34% in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Labor market equity in the United States, sadly, is another issue. "Americans 
are missing something," says Kerstin Keen of Volvo. Keen, who wrote a 
work-force education report on behalf of 24 major European corporations, adds, 
"You're not utilizing women as well as you have prepared them." 
</P>
<P>
The most telling evidence of this unhappy paradox comes from the richest 
archive ever assembled on a generation of Americans -- the U.S. Department of 
Education's study of the high-school class of 1972. The 22,600 men and women 
who initially participated in this survey are now "thirtysomething," and 
represent the "critical knowledge work force" of the year 2001. While there are 
dozens of stories in their records over 14 years, the most stunning is that of 
the women. 
</P>
<P>
Consider, first, the evidence of women's superior academic performance: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Matching women and men who took equal amounts of math or science in high 
school, the mean class rank for women exceeded that for men by 10 points. That 
is: Women beat men on conventionally "male" turf. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The parents of the class of '72 had lower educational aspirations for their 
daughters than they had for their sons. The daughters themselves had lower 
educational aspirations than the sons. Yet a higher percentage of women than 
men entered college directly from high school and won scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Once in college, women earned consistently higher grade-point averages than 
men, no matter what field they studied. The differences in performance are 
greatest in matching women and men who majored in science, business and 
engineering, traditionally "male" fields. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Achievement in college had a striking impact on the further educational 
plans of women in the class of '72. When they were surveyed in 1976 and 1979, 
the proportion of those aspiring to graduate degrees vaulted over that of men. 
</P>
<P>
These data show that women's aspirations are less inflated than men's, their 
plans more realistic, their focus on goals more intense. They do what they say 
they will do. Women "walk away from their pasts" in late adolescence, Mary 
Belenky and her colleagues wrote in "Women's Ways of Knowing." Further 
education supports their development. And further education -- along with 
realistic plans and determination -- is the basic currency of the world economy 
of the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy, however, seems to discount all the evidence of women's 
superior educational performance and commitment. Between age 25 and 32, a 
substantially higher percentage of women from the class of '72 experienced 
genuine unemployment and underemployment than did men. This experience was as 
stubbornly true for women who earned bachelor's degrees as it was for those who 
earned no degree. And at age 32, the women who were college graduates tended to 
hold lower-paying and traditionally female jobs -- for example, nursing and 
health technology (11%), teaching (23%) and office or financial-services 
support (9%). 
</P>
<P>
The data are dry; the stories are not. Janice, for example, a former student of 
mine in a mass-communications course, was always prepared, articulate and 
searching for knowledge beyond the course syllabus. She organized three or four 
of her peers to do a group study that involved commuting to Manhattan to 
interview TV rating service researchers. She stood out in a class of 140. 
</P>
<P>
Janice graduated in 1978, with a major in allied health sciences. Three years 
later, she was passing out towels in a health club in downtown Washington, 
waiting for a job testing exercise equipment in Pennsylvania or one in a 
physical therapy clinic in New Jersey. And out of work for two months before 
she started passing out towels. 
</P>
<P>
We're not talking here about the "glass ceiling," that fragile metaphor for the 
barrier between women in management careers and the executive suite. We're 
talking about the entire labor market for jobs requiring more than a 
high-school education, and Janice, a state college graduate of some promise, 
was typical. 
</P>
<P>
Even more telling than the experience of unemployment or underemployment are 
earnings differences between women and men with the same undergraduate 
backgrounds. If one restricts the women in this comparison to those without 
children -- the group with as many years of job experience as men -- the bottom 
line is devastating. Our analysis of data, reported in 1986, indicates that men 
who majored in fine arts earned, on average, 15% more than the women; men who 
majored in foreign languages earned 54% more than the women, and men who 
majored in education earned 26% more than the women. These fields are supposed 
to be female turf. 
</P>
<P>
In only four major occupations did the women college graduates earn more, on 
average, than men: chemist, economist, computer programmer and purchasing agent 
-- all requiring solid backgrounds in mathematics. In five other major 
occupations -- accountant, editor/reporter, physician, engineer, health 
technician -- differences in earnings were insignificant. Appearance and dress 
are not keys to mobility in these occupations. Despite messages from the 
Glamours of this world, women achieve pay equity in fields requiring substance 
more than fluff. 
</P>
<P>
Outside of these occupations, however, earnings differences in favor of men 
ranged from 15% for pharmacists to 42% for retail sales managers to 77% for 
architects. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this discouraging pattern, a much higher percentage of women than men 
who attended college -- no matter what degree they earned -- reported at age 32 
that their learning and training were relevant to their work. In other words, 
women tend to use what they've learned more than men. Perceptive employers 
agree. "Women come into the workplace like immigrants," said Harold Tragash, 
vice president for human resources at Rorer, "determined to succeed on the 
basis of what they know, not who they know." 
</P>
<P>
Tragash sees women more likely than men to "influence co-workers from a 
technical knowledge base." People who do that can change the knowledge with 
which we work, and that ability is critical to innovation in manufacturing, 
services and public administration. Innovations stemming from this supply of 
knowledge that women, in particular, bring to the job can make the difference 
in our economy in the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
It has been frequently observed that women make occupational choices for more 
complex -- and personal -- reasons than do men, and those reasons do not always 
include economic self-interest. The currently fashionable argument built on 
this observation is that women will continue to perform well academically and 
then contribute their knowledge to the workplace regardless of economic 
rewards. This argument unwittingly condones both the exploitation of women and 
economic stagnation. 
</P>
<P>
Why? First, because it does not encourage anyone's educational achievement. It 
certainly does not tell men, who have been slacking off in school and college 
for decades, that genuine knowledge counts. Second, because it does not 
encourage the sharing of knowledge for the good of any enterprise. If we take 
women's contributions for granted at the same time as we treat men's knowledge 
as proprietary and rewardable, we have a half-economy. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the world doesn't behave this way. Other nations may not educate as 
high a percentage of women beyond high school, but their economies do not leave 
a Janice passing out towels in a health club at age 25. 
</P>
<P>
Our national rhetoric holds that education is ultimately an economic investment 
on behalf of the whole society. The history of the high-school class of 1972 
strongly suggests that women can prove that point. The coming century is theirs 
to do so. But if the market rewarded women's attainments, everyone would 
benefit. That's playing it right -- and just.

A junior-high school girl only came to classes every other day. She and her 
mother had so little money, she told a counselor, that they had to share one 
pair of shoes. Every other day, the mother wore the shoes to look for work; on 
the other days, the daughter wore them to school. 
</P>
<P>
This young girl and the nearly eight million other children in California won't 
be voting Nov. 6. Yet they have an enormous stake in the priorities set by the 
state's next chief executive. Over the past 10 years, the quality of life for 
many California children has significantly eroded even as other states have 
been improving conditions for families. The next governor of California has a 
unique opportunity to learn from these other states and to act decisively for 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Once, California was hailed as the nation's leader on children's issues. But 
today, the comparisons are mostly negative: highest teen-pregnancy rate, 
highest rate of juveniles in custody, next-to-worst in classroom overcrowding. 
Nearly one-third of California students drop out or do not finish high school 
on time; one-fifth of its young children grow up in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
There is no great mystery about turning these trends around. Strong leadership 
combined with sound public policy can make a profound difference. We do not 
need new studies or pilot programs. We do need the leadership of a new pilot at 
the helm. While it is encouraging that children's issues are being discussed in 
the campaigns, that is only the first step. 
</P>
<P>
Since California's next generation can't vote, we are offering the new governor 
a three-part plan on the children's behalf. Coupled with other steps during the 
governor's four-year term, this plan would help millions of children and 
produce long-term reform. 
</P>
<P>
Step One: Prevention. The new governor should radically alter California's 
approach to helping children by focusing on early preventive programs, not 
costly remedies. 
</P>
<P>
Such preventive investments include preschool education, child care and early 
health and nutrition services and more effective education. These steps help 
children grow up avoiding crime, drug use and welfare dependence. 
</P>
<P>
For example, early health care for pregnant women and their children is one of 
the most effective ways to prevent health and learning problems as youngsters 
grow up. But one in every four pregnant women receives no prenatal care or 
receives it too late to be beneficial. More than half of California's young 
children are not fully immunized. One in five has no health insurance. This, 
despite the fact that $1 invested in prenatal care saves more than $3 in 
children's medical care later, and $1 invested in immunizations saves $10 
later. 
</P>
<P>
The new governor can lead our state in establishing a comprehensive children's 
health program -- one that reaches every pregnant woman with prenatal and 
delivery care and every child with needed immunizations, health check-ups and 
treatment for medical needs. This is not an impossible dream: Statewide public 
health programs that California can emulate are already operating. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Minnesota instituted a comprehensive program for uninsured 
children two years ago. Already about half the eligible children have been 
enrolled; nearly every physician and dentist will serve them. The Minnesota 
Children's Health Plan provides uninsured children up to the age of 8 with 
preventive services, most out-patient treatment, routine mental health services 
and dental and eye care. The program is financed by state funds. Parents pay an 
annual premium of $25 per child. 
</P>
<P>
Step Two: Priorities. The new governor should focus on the fundamental problems 
facing children and families, not just on cosmetic solutions. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a child's well-being depends to a great degree on the family's 
financial stability. With half of our children likely to live with just one 
parent at some point in their lives, child support payments from the absent 
father or mother are increasingly important to children's financial security. 
Yet in 1988, a bare minimum of $366 million in child support payments -- more 
than half the awards courts ordered -- went uncollected in California. In 
addition, California stands to lose millions of dollars in federal funds 
annually as penalties for this poor performance. Again, this dismal record 
exists despite the fact that every $1 invested by the state in child support 
enforcement saves roughly $3.70 in welfare costs. 
</P>
<P>
Other states are already taking bold steps to improve their collections of 
child-support money. Wisconsin, for example, has established uniform guidelines 
for determining support orders, automatically withholds child-support payments 
from the wages of the absent parent and plans to provide a state allowance for 
the child if parental income and child support are not sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
Step Three: Performance. The new governor should institute a comprehensive 
approach to children's needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids aren't like cars: You can't rely on spare parts and you can't "fix" them 
one piece at a time. California needs to tie together services for children in 
a way that both works for youngsters and pays off for taxpayers. One of the 
best examples of this approach is Head Start, the federally-funded preschool 
program that has a 20-year track record of success. 
</P>
<P>
Besides providing preschool education for low-income 3- and 4-year-olds, Head 
Start programs help arrange for needed health and dental care, as well as 
family services and counseling. Children who participate in Head Start perform 
better than their peers when they begin school. They are also held back less 
often, are absent less often and are healthier than their peers. 
</P>
<P>
Using this Head Start philosophy, the new governor can spearhead the effort to 
integrate services for children of all ages. This means that health, nutrition, 
parenting, mental health and other services should be coordinated and placed 
where the children are located -- in schools and neighborhood centers. 
</P>
<P>
The new governor must also look for results. Californians spend billons of 
dollars on children's services. Any successful business person responsible for 
such an investment would insist on effective accountability measures and 
incentives for improvement. California children who need these services -- and 
the taxpayers who pay for them -- deserve such an accounting. 
</P>
<P>
These recommendations would go a long way toward getting children off to the 
right start, but they do not cover all the bases. Some children will still fall 
through the cracks and need tailored programs for a second chance. The new 
governor must work closely with teachers, social workers and others to help 
these neediest children, too. 
</P>
<P>
Paying for a preventive investment in children also requires a three-step 
approach. First, ensure that current programs are cost-effective and 
successful. Get rid of waste and duplication. Second, make sure California gets 
federal funds to which it is entitled. For example, the state is now losing an 
estimated $1.5 billion in federal funds for medical and mental health services. 
Third, identify new revenues to help pay for necessary, cost-effective 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive investment in California's children would cost about 1% of the 
current state budget -- about $20 a year for every Californian, compared to the 
$2,000 every Californian will pay to bail out the savings-and-loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
If there were a city of California's poor and especially vulnerable children, 
it would be the second largest in the state. Only Los Angeles would be bigger. 
Those children trapped in that city of neglect are looking toward you now, 
Governor Feinstein or Governor Wilson. We hope that you will remember that 
California's children need attention and compassion. Most of all, they need 
your leadership.

PRISON INMATE LABOR INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Proposition 139, the Prison Inmate Labor Initiative, is approved by the 
voters, the results will not be as good as the proponents hope or as bad as the 
opponents fear. We likely would see mixed results on a modest scale that do not 
threaten free labor. 
</P>
<P>
Many prisoners have psychological problems and poor social skills and work 
habits. They pose no serious threat to the AFL-CIO or to Japan Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The prison system as an expensive failure. The prison population has swelled to 
95,000, costing us several billions each year in lost productivity as well as 
interest on a batch of long-term jail and prison construction bonds that we are 
expected to approve at almost every election. 
</P>
<P>
We should encourage the better prisoners to improve self-esteem with jobs to 
earn wages, most of which would go for family support, taxes, room and board, 
victims' restitution and a small bank account for the prisoner to have when 
leaving the prison. 
</P>
<P>
Our prisons are increasingly expensive failures. We need to try a new approach. 
Inadequate as it may appear, let's approve Proposition 139 as a step in the 
direction of making our prisons into factories behind walls.

RESEARCH USING FETAL TISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To me, a young Parkinson's victim of 35, the issues of fetal-cell research 
appear confused. Fetal-cell implants offer great hope to the victims of 
Parkinson's disease and other degenerative conditions. 
</P>
<P>
I am at a loss to understand the anti-abortion movement's objections. They 
contend that fetal-cell research is immoral because the material is obtained 
from a procedure that is immoral (abortion). This thinking is flawed. 
</P>
<P>
Do we insist that every victim of an automobile accident, who is a potential 
organ donor, not be a victim of the illegal and immoral act of drunk driving? 
Do we exclude victims of the fastest-growing immoral act in this country, 
violence, from being tissue donors? No! Then why does the anti-abortion 
movement insist on interfering with basic scientific research and our rights to 
benefit from such research?

RESEARCH USING FETAL TISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for bringing up the subject of fetal tissue transplants. 
Unfortunately, it was little more than another example of media bias against 
unborn children. 
</P>
<P>
Out of 61 inches of print, a mere 1 inch is given to the pro-life side, a token 
comment by Dr. John Wilke, president of the National Right to Life Committee. 
</P>
<P>
While I sympathize with those who suffer from Parkinson's, I also grieve for 
the lives of the unborn who die from abortion. I am diminished by their 
wrongful deaths. You don't anticipate the murder of a child and then say, "Hey, 
get that body over here so we can help somebody!" 
</P>
<P>
Without debating whether dead babies can help people, we must remember that 
fetal brain tissue grows quite well in the baby who remains in the womb where 
God intended him or her to stay until birth.

REP. ROHRABACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yet another baby-boom congressman has been exposed as having a tarnished past 
("Story Says Drug Foe Rohrabacher is Ex-User," Oct. 19). Rep. Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Long Beach) claims that he should not be held accountable for his youthful 
indiscretions and that his right to privacy should protect him. The story is 
relevant because Rohrabacher supports legislation that would deny all Americans 
that same right. 
</P>
<P>
He has been able to overcome his past. Will it be so easy for a young person 
today to overcome a five-year mandatory prison sentence as a result of the 
exact same activity that Rohrabacher claims is so harmless? Get caught and go 
to prison; get away with it and go to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, I'm in favor of abolishing the National Endowment for the Arts. 
Unlike Rohrabacher, I value consistency. The federal government should 
consistently leave the American people in peace with pocketbooks intact.

BUSH STEERING ECONOMY INTO A BLACK HOLE; 
</P>
<P>
HE'S BROKEN PROMISES AGAINST HIGHER TAXES AND HIGHER RATES IN ORDER TO FUND 
HIGHER SPENDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS, Paul Craig Roberts is the William E. Simon Professor of 
Political Economy at the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies in 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his pathetic pursuit of a budget deal, George Bush is pulling the economy 
and the Republican Party down with him. Any agreement that emerges will be no 
less a fraud than the agreements of the past decade, none of which reduced the 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of each budget agreement has always been to avoid a spending cut. 
This year's deal is no different. In the absence of a budget deal, the 
Gramm-Rudman limitations would allow Congress to spend only $10 billion to $20 
billion more in 1991 than in 1990. That's not enough for the incumbents to buy 
their reelection. Congress wants at least $130 billion more. The budget for 
fiscal 1991 that was submitted last February specified a $1.23-trillion budget. 
By Sept. 30, spending for 1991 had moved up to $1.36 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has broken solemn promises against higher taxes and higher tax rates in 
order to fund higher spending. The proof is that the deficit in 1991 will be 
larger than Ronald Reagan's biggest. 
</P>
<P>
To hide from the public the enormous jump in the deficit caused by 
election-year spending, Congress and the Administration are pretending that the 
real budget issue is over how to increase taxes on 65,303 Americans who have 
million-dollar incomes. Congress wants to raise their tax rates, and Bush wants 
to take away their deductions for mortgage interest and state and local taxes. 
</P>
<P>
To comprehend the fraud that both branches of government are perpetrating on 
the public, consider the following facts: America has about 250 million people. 
Those with million-dollar incomes comprise a tiny 6/100 of 1% of the 
population. If the IRS seized every dime of their incomes, it wouldn't come 
close to balancing the budget. In 1988, the most recent year for which IRS 
statistics are available, these 65,303 people paid $43.9 billion in income tax 
-- an average of $675,000 each. If that's not paying taxes, what is? 
</P>
<P>
Bush's plan to discriminate against the rich by cutting back their deduction 
for mortgage interest would add to the declining real estate market and worsen 
the cost to taxpayers of the S&amp;L bailout. There is a large surplus of 
upper-income housing on the market, the value of which will plummet if mortgage 
interest is not deductible. Just like the income tax itself, once the rich lose 
their mortgage interest deduction, the rest of us will follow. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government is currently making every economic mistake in the book. Its 
fiscal policy is focused on the deficit, ignoring the weakening economy. Its 
regulatory policies have driven down the values of assets held by S&amp;Ls, 
banks and insurance companies, thus weakening our financial institutions just 
as recession threatens. The Federal Reserve, demanding a recessionary fiscal 
policy, is keeping interest rates high as the economy weakens. The Treasury, 
following Carter-era policies, favors an ever lower dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's belligerency in the Middle East more than doubled oil prices which, 
inappropriately, show up as inflation and feed into cost-of-living indexes, 
resulting in additional billions in Social Security payments and other 
cost-of-living adjusted expenditures. The Fed pretends that the higher prices 
signal monetary inflation that prevents any ease as the economy teeters on the 
edge of a black hole. 
</P>
<P>
On top of this combination of the worst policy mistakes since the Great 
Depression, Bush wants to add $35 billion a year in higher "clean air" 
regulatory costs and$35 billion a year in tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
This is a prescription for maximum economic failure, which is no doubt the 
reason the Democrats have led Bush into the trap. Handicapped by a presidential 
nominating procedure that produces the weakest possible candidate, the 
Democrats are hoping to engineer a crushing recession that the liberal media 
will blame on Reagan, Bush and "the rich." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing suits the party of big government more than a failed economy to cause 
people "to vote their pocketbooks," return a Democrat to the White House and 
unleash a new era of budget expansion to "deal with the problems of the 
economy." The question is why Bush is working so hard to elect a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
The disastrous course of Bushonomics is further revealed by the 
Administration's approval of the appointment of Michael Dukakis' chief 
economics adviser, Larry Summers, to the $185,000-a-year chief economist job at 
the World Bank. Summers claims that Reagan impoverished the Third World by 
jacking up interest rates to finance tax cuts. In fact, interest rates fell by 
half under Reagan, but anti-Reagan propaganda is now the chief requirement for 
employment in Washington. House Democrat Beryl Anthony says Bush should change 
parties. By all appearances, he has.

FRUSTRATION ABOUNDS, SO SEIZE THE DAY; 
</P>
<P>
THE LIBERALS' UNCERTAIN TRUMPET FINALLY MUST SOUND A BLAST THAT CAN BE HEARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KUTTNER, Robert Kuttner is a syndicated columnist.

<TEXT>
<P>
One of the political hallmarks of economic frustration is that it can go either 
left or right. 
</P>
<P>
Today, our political compass is spinning. The public is increasingly 
disillusioned with the conservative panaceas of the 1980s. Yet liberals are 
still offering, at best, an uncertain trumpet. Public opinion mistrusts 
politics in general. 
</P>
<P>
One-time Klansman David Duke won 44% of the vote for a Louisiana U.S. Senate 
seat not because nearly half of the voters are incipient Nazis, but because the 
economy there is in chronic depression and mainstream politicians have few 
answers. He is an omen that the political center had better heed. 
</P>
<P>
In Massachusetts, where I live, economic grievances have caused a tax-revolt 
proposition to be placed on the November ballot. It would roll back tax rates 
to the point of leaving state government nearly bankrupt. And Democratic voters 
here have nominated for governor John Silber, the thinking man's David Duke. 
</P>
<P>
Just to the north, in the Canadian province of Ontario, the voters for the 
first time elected a socialist government for much the same reason: frustration 
with how established politicians were handling pocketbook issues. The socialist 
New Democratic Party program is strongly environmentalist and proposes a more 
progressive tax system, as well as expanded social services. 
</P>
<P>
Jill Marzetti, secretary of the Ontario NDP, admits that it wasn't only the NDP 
program that attracted Canadian voters. It was widespread disgust with the 
cynicism and corruption of the previous centrist government, fear of a 
softening economy and a desire to vote for the outs. 
</P>
<P>
Pocketbook grievances translate into spasms of populist protest whenever times 
are hard and the public feels incumbent politicians aren't responding. Voters 
go left or right depending on where convincing leadership arises. 
</P>
<P>
Where I live, the legitimacy of much of the political system is in tatters. The 
Boston Globe recently ran a remarkable series about corrupt judges. Many 
judges, it seems, are in the pockets of legislators who practice law on the 
side. Hire the right politically connected lawyer, and a felony can be fixed 
just like a parking ticket. 
</P>
<P>
This is happening at a time when the courts are so clogged that serious 
criminals wind up on the streets. Fear of crime has contributed to a voter 
backlash and a new vogue for tough-on-crime conservative politicians. Yet the 
last conservative governor was the very fellow who appointed many of these same 
judges -- and he was elected by the same working-class voters who are mad as 
hell about crime. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, you will recall, a conservative Administration was elected in 
1980 by voters eager to restore budgetary balance. They didn't get exactly what 
they bargained for, either. 
</P>
<P>
With the broad discrediting of the policies of Reaganomics, this ought to be a 
moment for an effective progressive alternative. After all, north of the 
border, programs pioneered by the Canadian New Democrats are genuinely popular 
-- universal health insurance, expanded child care, tough controls on 
pollution, fair taxation, affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
In America, polls show that voters want these things, too. However, the 
political system hasn't been able to deliver them. Unless somebody breaks 
through this deadlock, the voters will be right to grow ever more cynical. 
</P>
<P>
Taxing the rich, politically unthinkable two weeks ago, is now the consensus 
position in the budget debate. For the first time in a decade, liberals have 
set the agenda, and they seem almost stunned. It remains to be seen whether 
they will be bold enough to build on this success and offer genuinely popular 
alternatives. The polls show that voters truly want a health system more like 
the Canadian one. They want less spending on the military, effective services 
to meet the new needs of family life, and they want re-regulation of liberated 
industries that went a little haywire in the free-wheeling '80s, such as banks 
and airlines. 
</P>
<P>
At long last, the Democrats in Congress are behaving a little like an 
opposition party and less like the weaker half of a coalition government. In 
politics, moments like this don't come around that often. Today voters express 
their pocketbook frustration by staying home, voting to dismantle government or 
electing know-nothing leaders -- and then wake up even more disgusted when 
things get worse. 
</P>
<P>
If liberals don't seize this moment to stake out real alternatives, they will 
have themselves to blame.

MAKING AUDIENCES LAUGH IS HIS BUSINESS, AND DAVID SHINER DOES IT WITHOUT SAYING 
A WORD 
</P>

<P>
It's not easy being a clown. 
</P>
<P>
"Think about it," said David Shiner, who plays the gawky, hyperkinetic figure 
in Cirque du Soleil's triumphant "Nouvelle Experience" at the Big Top at the 
Santa Monica Pier. "There are 2,500 people in the audience. I don't speak one 
word. I communicate everything to them without saying anything. It takes an 
incredible amount of energy, from here" -- he taps the center of his chest -- 
"all the way out. So when I'm not doing the show, I'm sleeping or resting." 
</P>
<P>
All white-face impishness and rubber-band elasticity on stage, the off-stage 
Shiner, 37, is reserved, reflective, remarkably serious. His two appearances in 
the show -- first amiably clambering through the audience, later picking out 
volunteers to star in his "home movie" -- are both the continuum and the 
exception in this lavish and intricate show: He is the only performer who must 
adjust a set act to the elements of surprise and individuality he courts in the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
"They happen to be in the correct seat, or they're wearing interesting clothes, 
or they have an interesting face, or they're reacting to me in a certain way," 
Shiner said of the people he's attracted to playing with. "In the first number, 
I improvise: I go right into the public, crawl over them. For the cinema 
number, I definitely pick out specific people -- and I'm very careful who I 
choose. I'm looking for body types, and also people who are going to be open 
and naive, willing to play -- but not too much." 
</P>
<P>
The risk of sharing his space with amateurs is part of the fun, Shiner added. 
"I've developed it to a point now where I can deal with almost any situation -- 
unless the person is completely bonkers: refuses to participate or is a real 
problem. Then I just get rid of them; I 'fire' them. But that happens very 
rarely -- maybe two times this whole year." At this point, he implies, the act 
is almost foolproof, the refinement of hundreds and hundreds of performances 
over the past dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
Although he is one of only two Americans in the international company, Shiner 
has lived and performed in Europe since 1981. "I went there because I wanted to 
develop a particular style," he said. "I didn't see an opportunity to do that 
here. There were no clubs to work in the States; all you had was stand-up 
comedy." The move to Europe followed college training as an actor, 10 years as 
a carpenter, and "working the streets" -- doing his clown act and passing the 
hat -- in Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
It was in one of his many European festival performances that Shiner was first 
spotted by members of Cirque du Soleil. 
</P>
<P>
"David is a great communicator, a great mime," Cirque President Guy Laliberte 
said. "He can react fast to any situation with the public, work with them in 
any way possible." With similar ease, Shiner's slim, gray-suited clown coexists 
with the colorful Cirque acts, including a quartet of prepubescent 
contortionists, a corps of acrobats, tightrope walkers and trapeze artists, a 
leather-strapped aerialist, a stacked-chair climber and a Chinese foot juggler 
(of carpets and parasols). 
</P>
<P>
Although the show's effect is uncompromisingly joyful, Shiner's clown is rooted 
in more sober impulses. "It's a wonderful art form," he said firmly, noting 
that his a longtime inspiration in Charlie Chaplin. "It's been lost and 
forgotten, but I think people enjoy it, want to see it more. The clown is a 
very powerful figure in mythology and psychology. He's the trickster; he's 
embedded in everybody's psyche. That's why he's such a fascinating character to 
play. And it goes a lot deeper than laughter -- stuff we're not even aware of." 
</P>
<P>
Shiner paused, searching his interviewer's face for understanding. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, you don't just put on some makeup and take clown classes: 'I want to 
be funny.' It's a cathartic process -- facing yourself and your limitations, 
trying to answer deep questions about life and death, truth, identity. Who is 
this clown? He's a tragic figure, 'cause he doesn't belong; he doesn't fit in. 
They reason we laugh is that he's a mirror. We want to participate, we want to 
come together because we recognize our own pain, our own confusion." 
</P>
<P>
Not that Shiner expects people to dip into such deep philosophizing while 
watching him. "The whole thing is, I want to make them laugh," he said, 
pointing to his stomach. I want them to split open." His first brush with 
audience-love came in a sixth-grade play, as Bob Cratchit in "A Christmas 
Carol." "I just loved it," he said dreamily. "I loved having the cape and the 
hat and the makeup. My mother said at the curtain call I stood out in front of 
everybody and took this big dramatic bow." 
</P>
<P>
Searching out the spotlight hasn't always meant an easy life. 
</P>
<P>
After moving several times as a child (once, his father loaded up a semitrailer 
with all their belongings -- including the family car -- and drove from Boston 
to Colorado, with Shiner and his six siblings bumping along in the dark 
inside), he has reconciled himself to a certain rootlessness as an adult. "I 
don't feel that I live anywhere," he said with a shrug. "But, yes, you do get 
to a point where you're fed up with traveling and would like to settle down, 
have a home, a community." 
</P>
<P>
Balancing the rigors of life on the road is the constant kick of performing. 
"I'm always nervous before I step onstage," he said. " 'I've got to go out 
there again -- I hope I can pull it off.' But once they start laughing, it 
gives me something back, a little shot. Then I go further, and it becomes like 
an exchange: They give to me, I give to them. And yet going on six months now, 
nine shows a week, it is a physical demand; my body feels it." 
</P>
<P>
When the Cirque tour does end, Shiner isn't sure of his plans. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on where the job takes me. Doing what I do, there's no language 
barrier; I can work almost anywhere in the Western Hemisphere. If something 
doesn't develop for me here, I could always go back to Europe -- There are many 
small theaters, and they tend to keep their performers around a long time. The 
Americans consume quite rapidly. It's something that frightens me about working 
here: You're in, then you're out. I feel like, 'Wait a minute. I've just spent 
13 years developing my act. I don't want to be in and out.' "

WINE COUNTRY; A HISTORY OF NAPA VALLEY, THE EARLY YEARS: 1838-1920 BY WILLIAM 
F. HEINTZ(CAPRA PRESS: $29.95; 310 PP., ILLUSTRATED); 
</P>
<P>
NAPA BY JAMES CONAWAY (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $24.95; 506 PP., ILLUSTRATED) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Cyra McFadden, McFadden's last book was Rain or Shine (Random House), a 
family memoir about her father's life on the rodeo circuit. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
If two new books on the Napa Valley were wines, you'd sip one slowly and gulp 
the other. William F. Heintz's history of the region from 1838 to 1920, which 
is to be followed by a second volume, would be a cabernet in the traditional 
style, heavy and full-bodied. I wouldn't order a case, however, because even a 
scholarly work such as "Wine Country" needs more color and flair. 
</P>
<P>
James Conaway's "Napa" resembles a sparkling wine. It's bright, brassy and 
slips right down but reads more like a gossipy novel than a journalistic 
account of events. While both books include photographs, Conaway's should have 
a fold-out map showing where the bodies are buried. 
</P>
<P>
Heintz is a former corporate historian who'd done prodigious amounts of 
research. "Wine Country" traces the origin of viticulture in the Napa Valley to 
1838, when George Yount, the first white settler, planted a small vineyard. The 
grapes were intended for eating. Young and like-minded pioneers, most of them 
Midwestern farmers, came from religious/fundamentalist backgrounds and believed 
that grapes "were to be eaten for food and not, God forbid, for the making of 
wine." They changed their minds when the Gold Rush of 1849 brought hordes of 
thirsty miners to California, clamoring for something alcoholic to cut the 
dust. 
</P>
<P>
The settlers displaced the native Wappo Indians, of whom the "Nappas" were a 
small band, and in two decades, killed off almost all of them. Cholera and 
smallpox finished what rifles began. Heintz notes that before their people were 
completely decimated, Indian laborers in George Yount's employ may have planted 
the first of the grapevines destined to cover the land. 
</P>
<P>
During the Gold Rush, the Valley's population swelled, creating a huge demand 
for food. The region became a county and agriculture replaced cattle raising as 
its chief industry. Traces of a wilder West remained, though. When a cannon 
exploded during a Fourth of July celebration, according to an 1854 account, 
"blowing off the arm of one man and destroying the sight of another," the event 
merely "dampened temporarily the pleasure of the afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
Heintz credits Simpson Thompson from Bucks County, Pa., a nursery owner, with 
introducing the system of cultivating fruit without irrigation. Anton 
Haraszthy, John Osborne and Charles Krug, names better known to future 
generations, experimented with varieties of grapes and with wine-making 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
By the late 1850s, a publication called "The California Farmer" vigorously 
promoted "The Commerce of the Vine, Olive and Mediterranean Fruits," the 
importation of which, into the eastern United States, offered a lucrative 
market. Napa and nearby Sonoma counties caught "wine fever," consigning acreage 
to grapes at such a pace that the number of vines planted jumped from 22,000 to 
55,000 in one year. The wine "could not have been of very high quality," Heintz 
writes discreetly, but at least there was lots of it. 
</P>
<P>
"We are to make wine as common an article of consumption in America as upon the 
Rhine," one booster wrote in 1864, but even with a respectable product, thanks 
to the planting of European root stock, vintners had a rough row to hoe. 
Eastern snobs insisted that only French wines were fit to drink, a prejudice 
that proved dismayingly durable. 
</P>
<P>
Working from an impressive range of source materials, Heintz charts the Napa 
Valley's evolution into a prestigious wine-growing region. It's a solidly 
capable job, but italics and exclamation points pepper every page, and the 
over-emphasis grates: "Cooper fails to mention if Yount served any wine at 
dinner!" "McIntyre . . . seems to have become the first winery architect in the 
entire United States!" Enthusiasm is a fine thing. One still wants to tell 
Heintz "Calm down!" 
</P>
<P>
"Wine Country" also could use pruning, the cutting away of extraneous details 
and digressions. But it's a valuable contribution to California history. 
</P>
<P>
In "Napa," James Conaway sets out not just to inform but to entertain. The 
one-time wine columnist for the Washington Post succeeds on both counts. He 
writes well, understands the region's politics and social structure, and has a 
novelist's eye. If "Falcon Crest" hadn't gotten there first, he'd have the 
makings of a TV series in which Joan Collins could play any number of roles. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Naylor, for example. Wife of John Daniel, who inherited Inglenook, Naylor 
humiliated her husband with a series of love affairs and terrorized her 
children. Conaway describes her hitting one young daughter so hard on the back 
of the neck, at a dinner party, that the child fell unconscious into the soup. 
Whereupon her mother stormed out, presumably yelling "No wire hangers!" 
</P>
<P>
Helene de Pins, daughter of the founder of Beaulieu Vineyards, was another 
tyrant and a penny-pincher. Too cheap to invest money in the business after her 
father died, although she had plenty, she sold the prestigious estate, famous 
for its premium wines. The new owner was Heublein Corp., producer of "an ocean 
of pop wine, not just Cold Duck and the standby sweeties but also Bali Hai, 
Zapple (made of apples) and a cola-flavored creation called I Love You." 
</P>
<P>
Albeit in drag, Collins even could play Ernest Gallo, whom Conaway describes as 
ruthless. "Remember," Gallo instructs a young sales manager, "people aren't led 
-- they're driven!" 
</P>
<P>
And we've only begun to dish. Gleefully recounting the rift between the 
brothers Peter and Robert Mondavi, which ended up in a lawsuit, Conaway 
describes a fight between Robert and his mother Rosa, in the matriarch's 
kitchen, and all but accuses Robert of killing her: 
</P>
<P>
The two argue in Italian, in the presence of an old friend who can't understand 
what they're saying. "Finally Robert said something that made Rosa fall off her 
chair. Her friend rushed forward to help her while Robert stood staring down at 
his mother as if at a stranger. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"After Robert was gone, Rosa said 'I have two sons. One has short legs and he 
is a saint. One has longer legs and he is a devil.' 
</P>
<P>
"She died shortly thereafter." 
</P>
<P>
A group of wine makers who call themselves the GONADS, short for the 
"Gastronomic Order of the Nonsensical and Dissipatory," hold their monthly orgy 
of gorging, drinking their brains out and telling coarse jokes. These gents 
greet one another with "How're they hanging?" 
</P>
<P>
Another wine maker, Joe Heitz, has little use for wine tastings, considering 
them a waste of time. "But after someone asked him for his autograph, Heitz was 
seen more often in the midst of swirling, sniffing devotees of the ultimate 
beverage." 
</P>
<P>
Some real-life characters come off well. Others are greedy parvenus, whose 
pretensions Conaway exposes in long, "re-created" conversations, as if he'd 
been a fly on the wall. The hybrid of history and fictional techniques raises 
credibility problems; I'll believe some of these conversations only when I hear 
the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
That said, there's no resisting "Napa," and along with shaking up the Valley -- 
bookstores can't keep this one in stock -- Conaway makes a serious point. If 
Napa Valley can't be saved from developers, who are steadily gaining political 
clout, no place can.

GRATITUDE: REFLECTIONS ON WHAT WE OWE TO OUR COUNTRY BY WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY JR. 
(RANDOM HOUSE: $16.95; 155 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEX RAKSIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Young adults tend not to watch national news, much less read about it; 
middle-aged adults seem unable to shake the political skepticism they picked up 
in the '60s and '70s; teens are happy to hole up in the fantasy land of MTV: It 
sometimes appears that no medicine can revive our indifferent body politic. 
</P>
<P>
In "Gratitude," however, William F. Buckley, of all people, champions a 
government program that might well be the right potion to rouse us from 
slumber: a "national service" wherein high school graduates spend a year 
performing various civic duties, from helping old people to protecting the 
environment and restoring library books. The program, outlined most thoroughly 
by Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Georgia), would entice students by offering them $10,000 
(in tax credits, suggests Buckley; in cash, says Nunn) in addition to a low 
hourly wage. 
</P>
<P>
It is, of course, odd to find the dean of American conservatism backing such a 
grand federal enterprise, and amusing to hear echoes of Meryl Streep in his 
call for more education about endangered species, finite fossil fuels and 
invisible particulates. 
</P>
<P>
"Gratitude," nevertheless, is unmistakably a conservative book, more concerned 
with the effect the service would have on givers than on receivers. Through it, 
Buckley writes, students can pay the debt they owe to the "civilizational 
patrimony," a debt they probably haven't considered, for democracy has brought 
isolation along with freedom, "depriving us of communion" with our ancestors, 
with tradition and with other races in our increasingly fragmented culture. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the service would not rout out the roots of ingratitude -- such as 
an economy that makes it difficult to do good and do well at the same time -- 
but Buckley's argument for it is eloquent nevertheless, demonstrating that 
American conservatism still has a vital role to play in the post-Communist 
world.

HOLLYWOOD GOTHIC by David J. Skal (W. W. Norton: $39.95). "I am . . . Dracula," 
Bela Lugosi announced to the world as only he could in Todd Browning's 1931 
vampire epic, and the Hollywood horror film was born. 
</P>
<P>
But, as author Skal points out in this witty, comprehensive look at "the 
tangled web of Dracula from novel to stage to screen," the lure of the vampire 
began before Bela and bids fair to continue on long after his passing. Skal 
introduces us to Bram Stoker, the book's muddled author, and Florence, the 
protective widow who became obsessed with systematically destroying all copies 
of "Nosferatu," the classic German vampire film. He tells us how the 
46-year-old Hungarian actor (shown above with Dorothy Peterson in a 1927 stage 
production) who spoke negligible English both got the role and later became a 
prisoner of it. For those who take Halloween seriously, this is something to 
gnaw on long after those trick-or-treaters are gone. Kenneth Turan.

POWERSHIFT BY ALVIN TOFFLER (BANTAM: $22.95; 592 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEX RAKSIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alvin Toffler's world is so rocked by "powershifts," you'd think he was writing 
on the San Andreas Fault: "We live at a moment when the entire structure of 
power that held the world together is now disintegrating. . . . We stand at the 
edge of the deepest powershift in human history. . . . Gone is the proletariat; 
now welcome the cognitariat." 
</P>
<P>
None of us "cogs" wants to be stranded on the wrong edge of the Shift, of 
course, and so it's not difficult to see why this breathless book is being 
translated into 11 languages while its author lectures in America's top 
boardrooms, including the White House. Hopefully, though, our fear of being 
technophobic Luddites won't lead us to forget that writers have been mistaking 
technological change for social change since the Industrial Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Toffler proves no exception: "Powershift" totters on tired theories (the move 
from societies based on mineral to those based on mind), obvious aphorisms 
("Governments controlled or heavily influenced by extremists . . . do not stay 
democratic long") and cryptic observations: "Campuses are stirring from 
Berkeley to Rome and Taipei, preparing to explode." Berkeley, preparing to 
explode? 
</P>
<P>
Most questionable is Toffler's implicit assumption that new technologies 
usually work in favor of the common man. He argues, for example, that computers 
are helping "thoroughly smash" the knowledge monopoly of Western managers and 
specialists, leading to a democratization of power. But in focusing on 
medicine, the evidence he cites is unconvincing: True, anyone now can access 
professional databases such as "Index Medicus," but medical texts have never 
been inaccessible to lay people, just incomprehensible; true, patients now sue 
their doctors more often, but this has less to do with their growing knowledge 
of human physiology than with lawyers' greater zeal; true, nurses are demanding 
more respect, but this is mostly made possible by a critical nursing shortage. 
</P>
<P>
"Powershift" continues in this vein, distorting dozens of other trends until 
they fit one of its simple paradigms. Toffler's canvass is admittedly broad 
enough to daunt the best of us, but its ultimate lack of coherence ironically 
disproves one of its main assumptions: that a mere abundance of information 
will lead us to knowledge and thus power.

KEEPING THE PLAY ON THE PAGE -- AND THE STAGE; 
</P>
<P>
THE AUDREY SKIRBALL-KENIS THEATRE IS A WELL-FUNDED BUT RELATIVELY UNKNOWN GROUP 
THAT PERFORMS DRAMATIC READINGS AND ADMITS AUDIENCES FOR FREE 
</P>

The Audrey Skirball-Kenis Theatre is probably the most financially secure new 
theater group in town and also one of the most prolific. From now until the end 
of the year it will put on no less than seven plays. All will be done for 
audiences admitted free. 
</P>
<P>
But it's also likely that you have never heard of the group. It has no big 
opening nights, no seats reserved for critics, and on most occasions, no sets 
or costumes. Indeed, it does not even produce full-fledged plays. 
</P>
<P>
The Skirball-Kenis Theatre exclusively sponsors play readings. 
</P>
<P>
"What every play needs is the opportunity to meet its audience," Jerome 
Lawrence said. Lawrence, along with his longtime partner Robert E. Lee, and 
Norman Cousins, wrote "Whisper in the Mind," the first play reading sponsored 
by Skirball-Kenis. It was done in June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have the chance to discover what works and what does not, where 
it's working and where you have some work to do," Lawrence said from his Malibu 
home. "The only way to do that, finally, is to get a play up before people." 
</P>
<P>
The Skirball-Kenis company began its fall season last week with "Clever Dick," 
written and directed by Charles Marowitz. Today, the series continues with an 
afternoon reading of "February, the Present," written and directed by Martin 
Zurla and featuring actor Dan Lauria of ABC-TV's "The Wonder Years." 
</P>
<P>
Upcoming are plays by emerging playwrights Dan Duling, Silas Jones, Lisa Aimee 
Sturz and Dennis Clontz. 
</P>
<P>
The venture was sparked by a lunch conversation between veteran film producer 
Paul Heller and Charles Kenis, an importer of French cognacs and wines. "Paul 
started to talk about having a theater where playwrights could try out their 
plays," Kenis said. "I told him that we might be interested in that." 
</P>
<P>
The "we" is Kenis and his wife, Audrey Skirball-Kenis, for whom the theater 
group is named. 
</P>
<P>
"I was interested in the idea because of the state of the theater in this 
country," said Skirball-Kenis, sitting in the opulently decorated living room 
of their Century City condominium. "The theater has been just going down the 
tubes. There is no place for playwrights to develop." 
</P>
<P>
Her first husband was Jack Skirball, a onetime rabbi who went Hollywood and 
produced films such as Alfred Hitchcock's "Shadow of a Doubt" and "Saboteur," 
"Payment on Demand" starring Bette Davis and "The Howards of Virginia" starring 
Cary Grant. In the early 1960s, he invested his earnings in real estate 
projects such as the 43-acre Vacation Village in San Diego, which he sold in 
1983 for a reported $51 million. Skirball died in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Kenis, the owner of Bel-Air Imports, is known in food circles as the 
importer of the rare Cognac Frapin. He and Audrey Skirball were married in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Together, they are involved in a number of philanthropic ventures, including 
Hebrew Union College's Audrey Skirball-Kenis Cultural Center, a multiuse 
building under construction near UCLA. They are the sole backers of the theater 
group, to the tune of $1 million for its first five years of operation. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't get involved in the artistic side," Kenis said. "But when we are in 
the country, we go to all the readings. Some of them we have really enjoyed." 
</P>
<P>
Heller, who was executive producer of the highly acclaimed film "My Left Foot," 
had a longstanding relationship with Lawrence and Lee that included his 
producing their play "The First Monday in October." Lawrence and Lee also wrote 
"Inherit the Wind" and "Auntie Mame." 
</P>
<P>
The new play, "Whisper in the Mind," is about Franz Anton Mesmer, an Austrian 
physician who is considered the father of modern hypnosis. The Skirball-Kenis 
reading was done at UCLA and had a stellar cast that included E.G. Marshall, 
David Dukes and John Randolph. 
</P>
<P>
As directed by Marshall Mason, it was far more than the actors just sitting on 
stage and reading from scripts. There was some movement and even the suggestion 
of sets and costumes, although the actors did carry their scripts around with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not crazy about readings where they just sit there and read and nothing 
else," Lawrence said. "I just don't think that tells you much. But this one was 
beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
The actors, director and playwrights were paid only a stipend, but the cost of 
rehearsal time, props and a reception did mount up. Readings of "Whisper in the 
Mind" and three other plays done in a similar fashion that first season ended 
up costing $16,000 to $25,000 per reading, Kenis said. 
</P>
<P>
Even at those rates, it would take a while to go through $1 million. But Lisa 
Sanman, who had produced several plays at local Equity-waiver theaters and 
joined the Skirball-Kenis group as managing director this year, said that a 
more streamlined format was needed. "It wasn't the money so much," Sanman said, 
"it was the fact that in going for better production values, the play was 
getting lost. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to downsize a bit, make it a more informal atmosphere so that there 
would be more freedom for risks to be taken. We didn't want to be locked into 
sets or complicated staging at this point. The focus had to be on the writing 
-- the play itself." 
</P>
<P>
The company shifted gears, eliminating the sets, cutting back on movement and 
rehearsal time. The cost dipped too, to about $4,000 to $5,000 per reading, but 
more readings were added. During the current season, which ends Dec. 5, the 
Skirball-Kenis group will do about a reading a week. 
</P>
<P>
And once per season, a play will be chosen for a more complex staging with some 
movement and a suggestion of sets. This season's chosen play is Dan Duling's 
"Hard Road Home" about the goings on in a seedy Modesto motel. It will be 
presented next Sunday at UCLA's Little Theatre in MacGowan Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The company has been using small theaters at UCLA, which the Kenises can obtain 
at no or little cost. For several years, they have contributed money to that 
school's theater department. 
</P>
<P>
The company has had occasional use of non-campus theaters, but most of the 
readings now take place in an auditorium at the Wilshire Boulevard Temple in 
Los Angeles. When the Audrey Skirball-Kenis Cultural Center at Hebrew Union 
College is finished, the company will use its auditorium for readings. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, the company plans to present a play by pop novelist and screenwriter 
Sidney Sheldon in which Nancy Marchand is expected to appear. Also in the works 
is a series of panel discussions on topics of interest to playwrights. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked playwrights what they wanted to talk about, and they told us it 
should be the transition from play to screenplay," Sanman said. "Everyone would 
like to have the next 'Driving Miss Daisy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Skirball-Kenis Theatre company's next reading, of "February, the Present," 
written and directed by Martin Zurla, will be held today at 2 p.m. at the 
Matrix Theatre, 7657 Melrose Ave. This season's readings, which are mostly 
presented on Wednesday evenings, continue through Dec. 5. Admittance to all 
readings is free but reservations are sometimes needed. For reservations and 
schedule information, call (213) 284-8965.

NIGHT MOVES: COFFEEHOUSE QUENCHES L.A.'S THIRST FOR LITERARY AND THEATRICAL 
GATHERINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM SCHMALTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You're sitting in one of Los Angeles' new coffeehouses, sipping a cup of 
freshly brewed java. A corner of the room is cleared, and an actor emerges 
dressed in 16th-Century garb. He proceeds to perform a scene from William 
Shakespeare's "Two Gentlemen of Verona" in the character of Elvis Presley. 
</P>
<P>
Or, on another night, 1960s drug guru Timothy Leary approaches a microphone set 
up near an open fire and begins to talk about the importance of writer William 
Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
No, Leary hasn't slipped something into your beverage. You've simply found 
yourself at Highland Grounds in Hollywood, at either Classical Readings or 
Literary Night, two reading and performance series at the coffeehouse. 
</P>
<P>
According to Richard Brenner, co-owner of Highland Grounds, both nights are 
becoming his most consistently popular events, drawing as many as 100 book and 
drama lovers from all over the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
"People come out for these events because they have a special connection with 
the author or the material," Brenner, 36, said. "It's something individual 
between them and the writer." 
</P>
<P>
Devised and organized by actor Scott Colomby, Classical Readings is a weekly 
presentation of scenes and soliloquies from Shakespearean plays and other 
dramas. Every Tuesday night, Colomby and his colleagues perform their selected 
pieces in costume with the aid of a few props. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to call Classical Readings 'Shakespeare on the Patio.' It's like 
performing on the green," Brenner said. 
</P>
<P>
Literary Night -- where a specific author's work and life are presented in 
readings and personal testimonials -- is held the first Thursday of every 
month. So far Highland Grounds has featured William Burroughs and Dorothy 
Parker. 
</P>
<P>
Since opening their large two-room coffeehouse on January on Highland Avenue 
near Melrose, Brenner and his partner, Tom Kaplan, have sought to distinguish 
Highland Grounds from the rest of Los Angeles' new coffeehouses by offering a 
full menu that includes sandwiches, soups and herb teas, and by roasting their 
own coffee beans. 
</P>
<P>
But, Brenner said, it's the special events and evening entertainment that are 
sparking interest. Along with common java-joint pastimes such as poetry 
readings, art openings and board games, Highland Grounds features a weekly 
blues jam night and other activities not usually associated with coffeehouses. 
</P>
<P>
Literary Night grew from a onetime event in early July that featured the 
writings of Jack Kerouac. Backed by Rhino Records, which was promoting a new 
collection of the writer's recordings, the event featured readings from the 
works of the Beat poet and novelist, along with commentary by people who had 
been deeply moved or influenced by him. 
</P>
<P>
"It started at 8, and by 7:30 there was a tidal wave of people at the door," 
Brenner said. By the time the readings started, people had to be turned away 
from the packed house. 
</P>
<P>
The enormous turnout surprised Brenner, but, he said, the idea to sponsor more 
writer-themed nights was inspired by more than huge crowds. 
</P>
<P>
"People were still talking about it well after it was over, saying it made a 
personal connection with them. They wanted more of the same kind of 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
Brenner said he was especially influenced by comedian Louis Anderson, who 
attended the Kerouac reading and raved about it to anybody who would listen, 
including the media. 
</P>
<P>
"Louis really urged us to continue it," Brenner said. "He was one of the first 
and strongest supporters of this idea." 
</P>
<P>
In September, Highland Grounds featured a Burroughs night, followed by a Parker 
night in October. Though neither received the response of the Kerouac night, 
people filled up the coffeehouse's spacious open-air courtyard. (A fire is lit 
in a fire pit there during the readings.) 
</P>
<P>
Brenner and his friend Tony Barris -- who helps organize Literary Night -- 
choose the writers for the monthly readings. Some of the authors they're 
considering for future nights include Raymond Chandler, Kurt Vonnegut and 
Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Brenner also wants to have a "pop" literary night 
featuring best-selling authors such as Judith Krantz and Sidney Sheldon. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, they plan to deviate from the single-author concept by offering a 
Halloween-themed assortment of horror writers, including H. P. Lovecraft and 
Edgar Allan Poe. Brenner plans to invite several character actors and other 
celebrities to read the hair-raising tales. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to get professionals and interesting personalities to read," Brenner 
said, noting Timothy Leary's entertaining address during the Burroughs tribute. 
But, Brenner added, the organizers like to keep it open to as many different 
people as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Sherwood had never heard of Literary Night before she met Brenner and 
Kaplan as she sat at the coffeehouse, working on her new play. She ended up 
reading a few Parker poems at Dorothy Parker night. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised at the turnout, but even more with the concentration level of 
the audience," said Sherwood, 30. "It was a really wonderful experience to have 
that kind of attention from the crowd; not to have constant coughing and 
talking going on. They were really listening." 
</P>
<P>
Many of her own friends didn't show up, opting instead to attend one of the two 
major movie screenings that same night. It was their loss, Sherwood said. 
</P>
<P>
"So often the art that really inspires people gets lost," she said. "This 
community has been starved for this. This kind of event is filling a void. 
People want ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Laurel Ollstein, who performed scenes from her one-woman play about Dorothy 
Parker, "Laughter, Hope and a Sock in the Eye," agreed that Literary Night was 
out of the ordinary in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea of this night reminds me of San Francisco," Ollstein said. "In 
L.A., people do have performance spaces, but I haven't seen anything like 
this." 
</P>
<P>
What struck Ollstein about the audience was the variety. "It was quite a mix, 
from punked-out 19-year-olds to intellectuals looking 60 years old." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Colomby, 33, who has appeared in movies that include "Caddyshack" and 
numerous television programs including "Hunter" and "Midnight Caller," is a 
regular at the Highland Grounds blues jam nights on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
Usually cast in what he describes as "urban street punk" roles, Colomby is a 
method-trained actor who has never performed Shakespeare. He even admits to 
disliking the bard at one time. 
</P>
<P>
"My friend Franklyn Seales," an actor who died last May, "would always try to 
talk me into doing Shakespeare, that it was important for all actors," Colomby 
said. "But it wasn't until after his death that I started pursuing it. He's a 
big reason I began getting interested in doing these plays." 
</P>
<P>
About three months ago, Colomby saw an open spot in his schedule and invited 
some friends to perform scenes and soliloquies from Shakespeare. That first 
night, 12 people watched. The next week, there were more than 30. It has grown 
since. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we get up to 90 people here for a performance," Colomby said. The actors 
vary every week, but the troupe was dubbed "The Highland Grounds Players." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the actors are invited by Colomby. Others hear of Classical Readings 
and ask to perform, and some simply emerge from the audience to fill open spots 
on the schedule. These impromptu orations are called "hot seats." 
</P>
<P>
The results, Colomby said, are unpredictable -- but always interesting. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the mistakes are the funniest part of the night," he said. "But we 
do get some bad Shakespeare. This one guy did the worst Othello I've ever 
seen." 
</P>
<P>
A high-energy performer, Colomby encourages a wide-open atmosphere that is 
still reverent to the material -- mostly Shakespeare, and some modern dramas by 
writers such as Clifford Odets or Harold Pinter. 
</P>
<P>
"This is basically an actors' jam, where they can get together to experiment 
and do material they don't usually get a chance to do," Colomby said. 
</P>
<P>
It often makes for an unusual experience. Highland Grounds patrons sometimes 
surprise actors changing costumes in the men's room, and performers can be seen 
running and shouting from one room to another during scenes, startling 
unsuspecting patrons. 
</P>
<P>
Phaleen Parente and Mike Forbes were sitting together one Tuesday night when 
Colomby and his troupe suddenly appeared in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know what was going on," said Forbes, 18. 
</P>
<P>
Parente, an acting student, said, "It was great. I've never really been exposed 
to Shakespeare before." 
</P>
<P>
Many in the audience go out of their way to attend Classical Readings, 
especially actors hoping for a chance to reel off that Marc Antony speech or 
play Juliet leaning over her balcony -- even if it means competing with the 
Harleys roaring down Highland Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Kovitz, who's part of the Los Angeles Theater Centre's Classic Theater 
Lab, heard about Colomby's group at an audition. He's done a couple of hot 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want this publicized," said Kovitz, 35. "It'll get way too crowded." 
</P>
<P>
Another actor in the audience, Bruce Herman, said agents around town are 
starting to notice Classical Readings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great for actors. Is there any other place with a guaranteed audience?" 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton Mitchell, 32, who introduced Elvis to the Bard, is an actor and 
comedian who recently finished studying with Second City. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a place you can really cut loose and work on style. That's rare in 
L.A.," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Among participants at both Literary Night and Classical Readings, the 
stereotype of Los Angeles as a less-than-weighty intellectual metropolis seems 
to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
But Brenner thinks that this reputation is undeserved. "I think the thing about 
L.A. not being a literary city is overdone," he said. Walking through the 
coffeehouse, he pointed to a large round table with a group of people 
discussing literature. 
</P>
<P>
"See those people? They're a book club that comes in here every month or so. We 
look to encourage things like that." 
</P>
<P>
People may not walk in L.A., but at Highland Grounds, at least they read. 
</P>
<P>
Highland Grounds, 742 N. Highland Ave., Hollywood, sponsors Classical Readings 
at 8 p.m. every Tuesday and Literary Night at 9 p.m. on the first Thursday of 
every month.

ART NOTEBOOK: SHE LIKES HER CONCEPTUAL ART WITH A FLAIR FOR INTRIGUE AND 
INVENTIVENESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
To enter Sue Spaid Fine Art -- which opened on Beverly Boulevard in June -- you 
have to wend your way through the current installation by Los Angeles artist 
Thomas Hartman, which spreads across the entire floor. Amid a sinuous mass of 
electric cords are 15 white plaster duck derrieres -- as if the birds were 
hiding their heads in the floor -- cooled by 15 wildly oscillating fans. 
</P>
<P>
The piece is "a comment on people who have attitudes and opinions about things 
-- but they're not explored," Spaid said. The fans, she said, represent the 
comforts of our air-conditioned, two-car lifestyles. The artist believes that 
everyone's a duck about something, she added. 
</P>
<P>
As an art dealer, Sue Spaid has a predilection for conceptual art, in which the 
idea presented by a piece is a prime aesthetic component. Spaid is not terribly 
interested, however, in conceptual art for which the idea is all; nor does she 
care for that in which originality is downplayed in favor of so-called 
appropriation (the borrowing of existing art or media images). 
</P>
<P>
Spaid likes her conceptual art to be experimental in its approach, inventive in 
its construction -- and intriguing for the eye, not just the mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really interested in a better blend of style and content," she said. 
"There's a lot of art that's conceptual but not visually interesting. If the 
art object isn't any more fascinating than a catalogue, then I have a problem 
with it. The art object should be more interesting than its picture." 
</P>
<P>
For a recent show titled "C-ouch Pain-tings", artist Carter Potter poured paint 
through and otherwise modified a series of eviscerated couches that were hung 
on the wall. And her upcoming November show -- of photo realist pastel collages 
by Stephen Derrickson -- is meant to subvert recent trends in photographic 
appropriation. 
</P>
<P>
Another artist in Spaid's stable is Jacci Den Hartog, whose work includes 
two-dimensional pieces made of cast rubber that she calls "rubber drawings." 
Through the gallery, Den Hartog is also asking the public to donate items made 
of ivory; they will be incorporated into a piece protesting the slaughter of 
elephants, which is scheduled for an April show at the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Spaid -- who has a longstanding interest in art, but who worked on Wall Street 
and earned a degree in philosophy while living in New York City -- moved to Los 
Angeles a year ago. She picked Beverly Boulevard as a site for her gallery 
partly because of her attraction to its Art Deco and other older buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Spaid also chose to keep somewhat unusual hours -- the gallery is open from 1 
to 9 p.m. Wednesdays through Sunday -- so that it would be more readily 
accessible to those who work weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't just want rich people," she said. "I couldn't imagine who buys art at 
4 p.m. on a Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
 The Thomas Hartman exhibit is on display through today at Sue Spaid Fine Art, 
7454 1/2 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles. (213) 935-6153. Open Wednesday through 
Sunday, 1 to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 ARTNOST: By now the lack of consumer products and even basic foodstuffs on the 
shelves of Soviet stores has been widely publicized. But since last spring, the 
Sherberg Gallery and a newly formed organization called Friends of Russian Art 
(FORA) have been working to remedy a lesser-known shortage: the lack of basic 
art supplies for Russian artists. 
</P>
<P>
FORA is collecting funds and donated art supplies to send to Soviet artists who 
need them, said Michael Ayzenberg, owner of the Sherberg Gallery, which 
specializes in 20th-Century Soviet modern art. The gallery held a benefit 
exhibition this past summer for FORA, which has also approached

local art-supply stores for help. 
</P>
<P>
"We published an ad in a few Russian publications last spring, saying that this 
is to the attention of all artists that have any dream projects they would like 
to do but can't because of lack of supplies," Ayzenberg said. "We asked them to 
write about themselves and their projects." 
</P>
<P>
Ayzenberg said his representatives in the Soviet Union received thousands of 
responses, many requesting such apparently basic materials as canvas for a 
painting and a pack of oil paints. 
</P>
<P>
Ayzenberg said that in a year or so, FORA hopes all the art produced with the 
donated supplies will be assembled in an exhibition that will tour six cities 
in the United States, along with Toronto and Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no such things as art supply stores in Russia," said Ayzenberg, who 
moved from the Soviet Union to the United States 11 years ago and was a 
psychology major at UCLA, a law student and an investment banker before 
co-founding the Sherberg Gallery with artist Zinovy Shersher last year. 
</P>
<P>
Ayzenberg says the gallery has paintings done on stretched potato sacking 
instead of canvas. "There are places where artists can get brushes, but it's so 
limited," he said. "I brought one artist to an art store here, and he didn't 
know what the use was for three-quarters of the things in the store." 
</P>
<P>
Most Soviet artists, Ayzenberg said, have to try to get paint through 
connections or through the black market. Ironically, he noted, "They have real 
gold leaf in abundance. But not black paint, not brown paint." 
</P>
<P>
Under glasnost, Ayzenberg said, artists have the freedom to paint what they 
please. And the FORA effort has the support both of the Soviet artists' union 
and of the Soviet Minister of Culture, Tair Salakov, according to Ayzenberg. 
</P>
<P>
Does he see the art supply drive as political? "Of course it's political," he 
said. "But it's not the point that I'm a Russian trying to help my compatriots 
-- It's the American public helping the Russian. It is one of the many things 
that will strengthen the political situation and ties -- a very small fragment 
of a much larger picture." 
</P>

 Friends of Russian Art (FORA), through the Sherberg Gallery, 665 N. La Cienega 
Blvd., Los Angeles. (213) 652-0814. Open Tuesday through Saturday, 10 a.m to 6

 CHARACTER STUDY: Even before she took to dying her hair purple in the 1930s, 
Elise Cavanna Seeds Armitage Welton -- known simply as Elise -- was a 
strikingly colorful personality. She was more than 6 feet tall. She had studied 
dance with Isadora Duncan, performed with the Ziegfeld Follies, served as 
something of a straight woman for W. C. Fields. She was friendly with the 
photographer Edward Weston and with the poet E.E. Cummings. During World War 
II, she worked in an aircraft factory. 
</P>
<P>
But Elise also was a pioneer in the Los Angeles art world -- an important one 
who is ripe for rediscovery, according to a retrospective now at the Turner 
Dailey gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"She was one of the very first abstract artists in L.A.," said Victoria Dailey, 
co-owner of Turner Dailey. "While everyone else was painting eucalyptus trees, 
she was doing inventive abstractions." 
</P>
<P>
Elise, who died in 1963, exhibited geometric abstractions at the 1939 World's 
Fair. Later, she moved in the direction of a more lyrically abstract painting. 
And in the late 1940s and early 1950s, she joined with artists Lorser 
Feitelson, Helen Lundeberg and Stephen Longstreet to show as a group called 
Functionists West. (A show of Lorser Feitelson's work is on view at the Tobey 
C. Moss Gallery through Oct. 31.) 
</P>
<P>
"Mainly, their philosophy was that interesting art was going on in the West, in 
addition to New York," Dailey said. "But they had a hard time exhibiting here 
-- there was a lot of resistance." 
</P>
<P>
Just by being herself, Elise apparently advanced the cause. "She was such a 
breath of new air -- she really brought the modern movement to Los Angeles," 
Dailey said. "Not just her art but her personality combined to make people 
notice." 
</P>
<P>
 "Elise," through Nov. 3 at Turner Dailey, 7220 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles. 
(213) 931-1185. Open Wednesday through Friday 11 a.m to 5 p.m. and Saturday 
noon to 5 p.m.

When Jack Drown tools around town and spots one of his campaign bumper stickers 
on another car, he speeds up and shoots the driver a glance. If he sees a 
familiar face, he's disappointed. If it's a stranger, he smiles at the 
probability of a new vote. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving a restaurant last week, Jim Roache learned that a woman at a nearby 
table said she had already cast an absentee vote on his behalf. That gives him 
four solid votes, he figures, assuming his wife and 18-year-old daughter have 
not mislead him. 
</P>
<P>
Less than two weeks before San Diego County voters take a crack at picking John 
Duffy's replacement after 20 years on the job, there is no telling who will be 
the next sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
Roache, 45, a sheriff's captain, won the June primary over Drown, 44, an 
assistant sheriff, by a 32% to 28% vote, leaving 40% up for grabs. And there 
are no indications that they've made up their minds yet. Neither Drown nor 
Roache has enough money to conduct his own poll, so they've been sacrificing 
shoe leather instead, showing up at nearly 60 candidate forums this year. 
</P>
<P>
Both men pledged to take the high road after the primary, but it's been an 
increasingly muddy route ever since. 
</P>
<P>
According to Drown, Roache is a vindictive, insolent, ill-tempered, pro-gun 
politician who cares more about his duties as board member of the San Diego 
Unified School District than dedicating his life to law enforcement issues. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about the chief elected law enforcement official in the second 
largest county in California," says Drown, one of a trio of assistant sheriffs, 
the department's third highest rank. Drown has 21 years with the department. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that Jim Roache has very little in the way of achievements in law 
enforcement and virtually no support in terms of chief executives in law 
enforcement and no professional law enforcement affiliations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Roache, Jack Drown and John Duffy share more than just initials. 
Drown is the sheriff's hand-picked puppet, adept at avoiding controversies and 
beholden to numerous Duffy friends and associates for his support, said Roache, 
who has been with the department 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone in the sheriff's department knew that Jack Drown was the heir 
apparent to John Duffy," said Roache, a sheriff's captain in charge of the 
Lemon Grove station. "Everyone knows that Duffy has this tremendous political 
machine with all his personal benefactors and supporters. And all that support 
is going to Jack." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Roache said, Drown "has embarked on a mud-slinging, 
rumor-and-innuendo-filled, vicious character assassination." 
</P>
<P>
Whoever wins, the next sheriff will have to clean up the tarnished image of the 
sheriff's office that Duffy is leaving behind. 
</P>
<P>
After five terms in office -- two of which were uncontested and two of which he 
drew 62% of the vote in primary elections -- Duffy announced last December he 
would not run again amid questions about his performance in office and a 
long-earned 
</P>
<P>
reputation for inaccessibility and truculent relations with the county Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
His department faced the pressures of jail overcrowding, spiraling crime, 
budget battles with the Board of Supervisors and inmate abuse, particularly in 
the case of the El Cajon jail, where deputies were said by the county grand 
jury to have cruelly harassed prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's 2,300-member department provides patrol services to 740,000 
people -- about 440,000 in the unincorporated county. The department has 
contracts in nine cities where about 300,000 more live. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the campaign, Duffy, an avid Drown supporter, has neither been seen 
nor heard. Some believe he was politely asked to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
But Drown has prospered from dozens of traditional Duffy sources: deputy 
sheriffs, county employees, honorary deputies and their families. Those sources 
account for 58% of the $79,169 Drown has raised between July 1 and Sept. 30 of 
this year, according to a Times analysis. 
</P>
<P>
During the same period, Roache raised $25,214 and said he wouldn't accept money 
from any of those sources. He worries that the lack of money could cost him the 
election. He has relied on educators and friends of his and of his wife 
Jeanette, who is well-known in San Diego Republican circles. 
</P>
<P>
Only Drown has been able to afford a television commercial, which touts his law 
enforcement endorsements from the Deputy Sheriff's Assn. of San Diego County, 
the Peace Officers Research Assn. of California and the California Narcotics 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-second ads, which ran earlier this month on a cable channel and cost 
Drown $23,000, asked: "Why is it that Jim Roache has no support from the law 
enforcement officers he has worked with for 20 years?" 
</P>
<P>
Drown's law enforcement endorsements include the sheriffs of Imperial, San 
Bernardino, Riverside, Mono and Inyo counties and that of primary rival Vince 
Jimno, the Escondido police chief, who had strongly criticized Drown and his 
ties to Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
The endorsements, Roache believes, may be more of a bust than a boon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more a negative than a positive," Roache said. "There is a sentiment in 
the public at large that what is needed is someone who is not part of the law 
enforcement establishment. I think voters are looking for someone who can say, 
'I'm a law enforcement professional who is not here to make decisions on behalf 
of the people who endorse me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Drown says Roache has not produced a single idea as to how he'll run the 
department. Drown recently released a 12-page compilation of policies he'll 
adopt if he becomes sheriff. Among other things, Drown wants to establish a 
review board that will examine shootings by deputies, a community council of 
citizens to give the sheriff some direction, and a cultural awareness program 
to reduce bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
Roache calls the Drown report, entitled "A new decade, a new direction" a 
compiled rehash of existing department policy with "few, if any" new ideas 
added. 
</P>
<P>
When pressed for specific programs and policies that his administration would 
offer, Roache offers generalities instead. 
</P>
<P>
Public trust in the sheriff's department must be restored, Roache said, because 
for years Duffy personified the arrogance of an autonomous sheriff who was 
quick to dismiss criticism without investigating the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, the department needs to "restructure" priorities although Roache 
said he doesn't know what the priorities will be until after he's elected. 
Roache also talks about having private businesses help build jails, but offers 
few specifics. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot begin to attack any of these problems until we substantiate to the 
public that we (can) do our job in a professional, neutral, objective manner 
without bias or prejudice," he said. "I don't know how many times I've heard 
people try to justify themselves but saying, 'Yeah, but we're sheriff's 
deputies.' It's that kind of mind-set, that kind of attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Roache strongly supports creating a citizens law enforcement review board, 
which is known as Proposition A on the Nov. 6 ballot. The board, whose members 
would be selected by the Board of Supervisors, would have the power to subpoena 
witnesses and documents in its investigations of department violations. 
</P>
<P>
Drown supports the review board now, but earlier in the campaign, said he 
believed the grand jury could do the same job with less political influence. He 
has since accepted the review board and helped write a ballot rebuttal to the 
argument against Proposition A. Duffy wrote the argument against the board, 
which mirrored Drown's original objections. 
</P>
<P>
Roache and Drown disagree on very little. Besides their support for a civilian 
review board, they both oppose Proposition B, which would give the Board of 
Supervisors the right to establish a Department of Corrections to run the jails 
instead of sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Both men say such a department won't ease overcrowded jails or end various 
abuses of prisoners that inmates say still occur. More jail space and the money 
to build it is needed, which both candidates say will take the best efforts of 
the new sheriff and supervisors. Abuses will end once hiring practices are 
honed so the best deputies are hired, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Those issues have been overshadowed in the Drown-Roache campaign by others that 
some believe seem more petty but which both candidates dwell on intently at 
campaign forums and in interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Drown accused Roache of losing his temper in a television debate, at the end of 
which Roache wagged a finger in Drown's face. Roache assured Drown he'd be 
fired once Sheriff Roache took office even though it is typical for a new 
sheriff -- especially one who has campaigned as a reformer -- to clean house 
once elected. Drown raised the question of Roache's time spent on school board 
issues. Roache accused Drown of hiding campaign expenditures by not disclosing 
who paid for Drown refrigerator magnets. 
</P>
<P>
A civil service hearing involving a captain's sheriff disciplined by Duffy last 
year that had little to do with Drown or Roache drew both men into battle. The 
fight between Duffy, a Drown supporter, and Everett Bobbitt, a Roache backer, 
who was representing his wife during the hearing, forced both candidates to 
defend their roles in the fray. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times last week, Duffy said Roache is not qualified to 
be sheriff. Drown, he said, can manage budgets, has run the jails, helped form 
policy, has the respect of most deputies, can work with the media, and has 
almost unanimous support among top-ranking law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
Roache has done none of that, Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have 17 captains," he said. "Even the very best captain would be 
hard-pressed to step in and assume this office on Jan. 7. And Roache is not the 
best. He's not the worst either. He's in the lower third." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy himself was a sheriff's captain when elected 20 years ago, but maintains 
that he was one of only five in the position in a department less than 
one-third its present size. Duffy said he controlled a station that oversaw all 
of North County. 
</P>
<P>
Drown has walked a fine line when questioned about his ties to Duffy. Although 
he courted -- and gained -- the support of traditional Duffy backers, he is 
irked by constant comparisons to his boss. And while hesitant to criticize 
Duffy, Drown has tried to distance himself from the sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
"This election should not be report card on John Duffy," Drown has echoed 
repeatedly. "Our management styles are different. I'm more of a diplomat than a 
politician." 
</P>
<P>
Drown uses the same line when talking about Roache, and has tried to draw a 
curious analogy between Roache and Duffy to deflect comparisons between Drown 
and Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
Drown is reluctant to talk in depth about his differences with Duffy, other 
than several disagreements over the years with the sheriff about budgets and 
their differing attitudes about how to treat employees. 
</P>
<P>
"John would see an individual deputy and say, 'I don't like the way that guy 
looks in a uniform,' and the guy would be transferred to a place where he 
wouldn't be seen publicly," Drown said. "I don't tend to operate that way." 
</P>
<P>
Drown promises to be less confrontational and on friendlier terms with the 
Board of Supervisors, which Duffy stopped dealing with two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Drown and Duffy, in fact, agree on many things about Roache, including what 
they perceive to be his pro-gun position after he received the endorsement by 
the National Rifle Assn. during the primary election. 
</P>
<P>
Drown supports a 15-day waiting period to purchase a handgun; a bill that would 
establish a nationwide seven-day waiting time to purchase a handgun; further 
restrictions on modified assault weapons; additional firearm safety courses; 
and the distribution of gun permits based on "good moral character and a 
demonstrated need" without political favoritism. 
</P>
<P>
Roache supports a 15-day waiting period, although he believes police can do 
background checks more quickly; opposes the bill to provide a seven-day waiting 
period; and does not believe in further state restrictions for any firearms. He 
said the county's current policy for distributing gun permits is sufficient.

ANIMAL RESEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times' editorial ("Animal Research," Oct. 20), urging a Yes vote on 
Proposition C -- the relinquishing of lost animals in pounds or shelters to 
UCSD for research -- is a masterpiece of intellectual dishonesty. 
</P>
<P>
The pivotal issue is not whether medical research performed on animals "could 
lead to progress in fighting diseases afflicting both humans and animals." 
</P>
<P>
It is about the legitimacy of taking lost or abandoned animals for research 
from a place of refuge. 
</P>
<P>
Why all the fancy rhetoric about medical research on animals? Proposition C has 
nothing to do with that -- as The Times well knows. It is about the corruption 
of a place of refuge for lost or abandoned animals, never intended to be a 
warehouse facility for scientists at UC San Diego School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Most disturbing is that the origin of dogs and cats in pounds is clear -- most 
are former pets. Pound seizure is a companion animal issue which corrupts the 
entire purpose of animal shelters: A safe place, offering protection from 
injury, abuse and exploitation and, should the necessity arise, the painless 
ending of their lives.

Throughout our lives my wife and I have enjoyed companionship of both dogs and 
cats who enriched our lives with their loyalty and devotion. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, we will vote yes on Proposition C. 
</P>
<P>
Animals benefit from animal research. Vaccines developed from animal research 
now protect pets and domestic animals from diseases that were fatal not too 
long ago. 
</P>
<P>
Humans also are dependent on animal research. Medical procedures first tested 
on animals have saved the lives of uncounted humans. We believe that the 
conditions of medical research are entirely adequate to protect the well-being 
of abandoned pound animals who would otherwise be destroyed.

YOUNG SPUDS GROWING INTO COUCH POTATOES; 
</P>
<P>
FITNESS: THERE'S TIME TO REVERSE THE TREND. SAN DIEGO YOUNGSTERS, WHO FARED 
POORLY ON STATEWIDE FITNESS TESTS, CAN REDISCOVER THE JOY OF GOOD HEALTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY BLACKMAN, Mary Blackman is physical education and health coordinator 
for the San Diego County Office of Education. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what should rank as one of the great local ironies of our time, 
fitness-crazed San Diego County is raising a generation of future couch 
potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
Results of statewide fitness tests released last week confirmed the sad fact 
that our children are weaker, flabbier and less limber than they should be. 
They tire out faster, too. 
</P>
<P>
In a community that has elevated physical fitness to near-religious stature, 
how can that be? Didn't Sports Illustrated magazine call San Diego "the fitness 
capital of the nation?" 
</P>
<P>
If we take a minute to think about it, the reasons are actually very clear: 
</P>
<P>
* As school funding deteriorated over the last dozen years, Physical Education 
teachers vanished from most elementary schools. P.E. instruction was left to 
teachers who also cover art, music and health, in addition to academic 
subjects, in the nation's most 
</P>
<P>
crowded classrooms. Other states with nowhere near the number of fitness 
proponents have P.E. specialists at every school. 
</P>
<P>
Secondary physical education class sizes are too large, with an average of 50 
students. 
</P>
<P>
* Neighborhoods have changed. Streets that once served as playing fields for 
countless games are now too busy. Fear of crime has caused parents to restrict 
their children's outdoor playtime. 
</P>
<P>
* Television and computer/video games have replaced outdoor play in the 
afternoons of our young people. Our children have lost the joy of movement. 
</P>
<P>
There are other reasons, but rather than recite them, let's ask this question: 
What are we going to do about it? 
</P>
<P>
Our schools must realize that teaching students to be physically fit should not 
be merely an option. Fitness testing is already mandated by the state. Physical 
education should be a basic requirement, because without it every other aspect 
of a child's life is compromised. 
</P>
<P>
Students are better learners when they're fit. Stress is diminished, 
self-esteem enhanced. Pent-up nervous energy that can spark discipline problems 
can be put to good use in a well-run physical education program. 
</P>
<P>
This is particularly important at the elementary level. That's where exercise 
habits are formed. Once established, they're much tougher to change. 
</P>
<P>
Even with an outstanding physical education program in place, there is only so 
much a teacher can do during the normal school day. The drive to improve 
academic achievement is not going to change, and it shouldn't. What that means 
is that schools need to provide students and parents with suggestions for home 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
A regularly scheduled family walk (or jog, or bike ride, or skate around the 
block) is easy. As endurance increases, it can be lengthened. Those new to 
fitness programs should make it easy on themselves by setting attainable goals 
and gradually increasing their workouts, eventually reaching 20-25 minutes four 
days a week. Before long, they'll discover the very real "natural high" that 
keeps ordinary people on regular workout programs. 
</P>
<P>
Stretching exercises that provide flexibility can be done right on the living 
room floor, and they're an essential part of anyone's fitness program. Parents 
can make a game of it: Who can hold that stretch the longest? Again, the more 
stretching you and your children do, the better you'll feel. 
</P>
<P>
Upper-body strength, glaringly absent in our young people, can be improved by 
any one of hundreds of different exercises. Expensive weight sets aren't 
necessary. Soup cans are good weights for beginners, bleach containers filled 
with sand can work for the more experienced. As Bo Jackson says, "Just do it." 
</P>
<P>
It's important that parents provide the time, space and attention for their 
children's physical education activities, just as they should provide a quiet, 
well-lit area for academic studies. And they should track their kids' progress 
just as they would monitor math or language homework. 
</P>
<P>
Caring parents ensure that their children eat foods that promote fitness. 
Nutritious snacks like fruit and popcorn are far better than fast food. 
</P>
<P>
But activity is the key. According to a 16-year study conducted by UC Berkeley, 
there is little difference in the caloric intake of slim and overweight 
children. The difference is in their activity levels. Television and computer 
games should be off-limits until after dinner. Daytime is the time to play and 
move, to get outside and exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Students can't be expected to pick up the torch themselves. Young people don't 
think their bodies will ever deteriorate. But healthy lifestyles can be taught 
long before students understand their long-term importance. If activities are 
kept fun and children know their parents place importance in them, they'll get 
done. 
</P>
<P>
And now for a fundamental question: What happens if we don't do anything? 
</P>
<P>
A lot of things will happen and none will be good. Four out of five obese 
adolescents become overweight adults. Heart and lung diseases will increase, 
self-esteem will decrease, and productivity at the workplace will suffer. 
</P>

Fortunately, none of those things need to happen. By simply committing to 
exercising four times a week, either in school or at home, our children will 
become healthy. And the beauty of it is that it's fun. Let's rediscover the joy 
of movement.

TEACHER CHARGED WITH SKIMMING SCHOOL MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A teacher in the Inglewood Unifed School District was charged with grand theft 
and embezzlement last week for allegedly setting up a personal bank account to 
bilk the school district, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Matthews, who was principal of Hillcrest Continuation High School at 
the time of the alleged thefts and has since been demoted, was arraigned 
Wednesday in Los Angeles Municipal Court. He is charged with 14 counts of 
embezzlement and one count of grand theft involving as much as $4,000, 
Assistant Dist. Atty. Tom Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
"He established an account . . . for the purpose of skimming money that 
belonged either to the student body or the school district," Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews, who could not be reached for comment Friday, pleaded not guilty to 
all counts. His attorney, Carl Douglas, said Friday that Matthews plans to 
"vigorously deny that he committed any wrongdoing or illegality." 
</P>
<P>
Matthews recently suffered a personal tragedy when his son died Oct. 17 after a 
long illness. Mallory Matthews, 37, had been acting principal at Inglewood's 
Morningside High School. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Matthews is scheduled to appear in court Nov. 27 for the setting of the 
date of his preliminary hearing. He was released on his own recognizance after 
voluntarily appearing at the arraignment to answer an arrest warrant. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews, who has already reimbursed the district an undisclosed amount of 
money, was transferred from principal to an administrative position in the 
district headquarters in 1987 when a finance administrator discovered the 
existence of the unauthorized account and referred the matter to Inglewood 
police. He was demoted to a teaching position when police referred the matter 
to the district attorney's office in late 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews, a 15-year district employee, is accused of depositing school funds in 
the unauthorized account over a 16-month period beginning in 1986 and using the 
money for such personal uses as groceries, cosmetics and a $218 Nativity scene 
that was ordered for the school but sent to his home. 
</P>
<P>
Gray said Matthews paid "a substantial number of personal expenses through the 
account." 
</P>
<P>
Matthews allegedly opened the account at Wells Fargo Bank in Inglewood in 
August, 1986, in the name "Hillcrest High School Clubs/Leonard Matthews." He is 
accused of using the account to divert donations intended for the school, as 
well as profits from a student store and employee paychecks that may have been 
padded with phony overtime claims. 
</P>
<P>
Gray said Matthews had deposited some of his own money into the account and 
used it to pay some legitimate school expenses. "You can't clearly say that he 
collected other people's money and used it for wine, women and song" because 
some of the money was spent legitimately, Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
Community leaders expressed surprise last week upon learning of the criminal 
charges. Noting that it had been more than 18 months since the district 
attorney began its investigation, they said they had assumed nothing would come 
of the probe. 
</P>
<P>
Norma Smith, president of the Inglewood PTA Council, said that if Matthews is 
convicted, "he should pay the consequences." But she also said it was 
unfortunate the charges against Matthews were filed so close to the death of 
his son. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Gossett, an Inglewood businessman who had criticized the district last year 
for not firing Matthews, called Friday for his immediate suspension. 
</P>
<P>
"The school board ought to suspend him," he said. "These are grave charges, not 
parking violations." 
</P>
<P>
School board members and Supt. George McKenna could not be reached Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The school board came under fire last January for abandoning plans to dismiss 
Matthews and instead demoting him to the classroom. Critics charged that 
Matthews' close political ties to city and school officials kept him on the 
district payroll. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews had been disciplined by administrators in 1987 for using district 
equipment to prepare political literature on behalf of candidates supported by 
Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent.

HERMOSA MAPS HISTORICAL SUMMER HOMES OF THE STARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For those who thought the only landmark on The Strand was that vacant lot where 
the Biltmore used to be, the Hermosa Beach Historical Society presents . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ozzie and Harriet's old beach house? 
</P>
<P>
OK, so it isn't exactly a map to the movie stars' homes, but the latest 
publication of the historical society will guide you to some of the beach's 
more notable summer cottages. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning today, the society will be offering a free map of historical sites 
along Hermosa Beach's stretch of The Strand, the beachfront promenade where 
more than a few luminaries once kept summer homes. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the two-story, shingled Nelson cottage at 3133 The Strand where, 
according to the literature, Ozzie, Harriet, Ricky and David Nelson "spent many 
summers . . . and could be seen . . . cleaning the beach," the map features a 
house where Charlie Chaplin's family slept, another where lawyer William 
Jennings Bryan stayed and a hotel where Errol Flynn was a regular guest. 
</P>
<P>
"We had done a walking tour last year, and this year we wanted to try something 
different, something people could do at their convenience," said Rick Learned, 
a member of the historical society. 
</P>
<P>
"We're having an open house (today) in Room 7 at the Community Center at 3 
p.m., and we'll make the maps available then, plus show some slides and old 
film clips." 
</P>
<P>
Highlights of the seaside tour include: 
</P>
<P>
* 32 10th St., where the family of the silent film star summered while Chaplin 
was in Europe; 
</P>
<P>
* 1820 The Strand, where vaudeville comedian Slim Summerville kept his vacation 
home; 
</P>
<P>
* 2008 The Strand, where Bryan, a three-time presidential candidate, famed 
orator and lawyer, spent a year with his family during the 1920s; 
</P>
<P>
* Pier Avenue and Ocean Drive, at the site of the Old Hermosa Hotel, where 
Flynn was a regular guest; 
</P>
<P>
* 740 The Strand, the former home of the late California Supreme Court Chief 
Justice Lucien Shaw, who founded the Los Angeles Bar Assn; 
</P>
<P>
* 2020 The Strand, the extensively renovated former home of Meredith Pinxton 
(Pinky) Snyder, Los Angeles' mayor from 1897-1921; 
</P>
<P>
* 2340 The Strand, the former home of the late silent screen star Mae Marsh, 
who starred in D. W. Griffith's classic "Birth of a Nation." 
</P>
<P>
Learned said the map was researched by society members Edie Webber and Regina 
Taylor, who compiled it through interviews with longtime residents, from old 
newspaper clips and from other sources, such as the 1977 architectural history 
of Hermosa Beach, "Castles in the Sand," by Pat Gazin. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their thorough efforts, however, word that the map is coming has 
prompted a flurry from Learned's neighbors of new "landmark" addresses that the 
society had not yet heard about. 
</P>
<P>
"I think," Learned said, "that this is going to lead to an even larger project 
next year."

LOCAL ELECTIONS HAWTHORNE; 
</P>
<P>
PROPONENTS FIGHT HARD FOR TAX HIKE TO HIRE MORE POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hawthorne voters will have to decide this election which they fear more: crime 
or taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, those who feared higher taxes narrowly won the battle when 
Proposition D, the Hawthorne property tax for added police, fell 58 votes short 
of the two-thirds majority needed for passage. 
</P>
<P>
The narrow margin has prompted supporters and opponents of a revised version of 
the measure to wage even more aggressive campaigns this election. 
</P>
<P>
"It really just comes down to this: Are voters willing to pay a little more to 
get a substantial increase in police services? Are they willing to contribute a 
few dollars for a safer community?" Hawthorne Police Chief Stephen Port said. 
</P>
<P>
But George Walter, chairman of the Committee Opposing Proposition D, sees it 
differently: "The bottom line is the pocketbook. This tax will not end in one 
year. It's going to be an ongoing tax. It's going to circumvent Proposition 13 
and give the city a way to raise taxes without giving people a chance to vote 
on it again." 
</P>
<P>
The revised measure would raise $2.4 million annually to hire and retain an 
additional 35 police officers by boosting residential and commercial property 
taxes. Its assessments could be revised upward after July, 1993, by the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters, who include the Hawthorne Chamber of Commerce and a majority of the 
City Council, note that Hawthorne's rising crime rate has outpaced growth in 
the Police Department, which now spends about $10.5 million a year to employ 
about 90 sworn officers and more than 100 other part-time and full-time 
employees. Hawthorne has one of the highest ratios of crimes per residents and 
one of the lowest ratios of officers per residents in the South Bay, according 
to statistics gathered by Hawthorne police. 
</P>
<P>
Last year Hawthorne logged 9.4 crimes per 1,000 residents, while Inglewood 
officers recorded about eight crimes per 1,000 residents, Gardena recorded 7.2, 
El Segundo, 6.6 and Torrance, 5.3 during that same period. 
</P>
<P>
While Hawthorne employs 1.4 officers per 1,000 residents, Gardena, Torrance, 
Manhattan Beach, Inglewood and Hermosa Beach have between 1.6 and 2 officers 
per 1,000 residents, statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
"(Hawthorne) police officers can no longer be proactive," said Hawthorne Mayor 
Betty Ainsworth, a supporter of Proposition D. "Crime prevention programs have 
been sacrificed and (officers) are just running from one 911 call to another." 
</P>
<P>
Shelley Effler, chairwoman of Citizens Against Crime, which is campaigning in 
favor of the measure, said proponents have stepped up their canvassing efforts, 
are running phone banks through the election and will be distributing several 
mailers in an attempt to win. 
</P>
<P>
"Our door-to-door strategy is going to be different this time," Effler said. 
"We're really going to be walking heavily in those areas we fell short the last 
time to bring it over the top. We're also working harder at reaching people, to 
make sure people are aware of the changes made to this measure." 
</P>
<P>
In the June balloting, just 7,435 voters cast ballots on Proposition D -- about 
31% of the 23,373 registered voters. Of those, 4,898 voters, 65.88%, favored 
the proposal, and 2,537, or 34.12%, opposed it. The measure needed 4,956 votes 
to pass. 
</P>
<P>
Although there was no organized opposition to the proposal in June, opponents 
this time are campaigning vigorously against the measure. They organized a 
political action group and are planning to send out mailers and walk precincts. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents, who include a cross section of business people, retirees, renters 
and property owners, argue that the measure will mostly hurt low-income renters 
and businesses. They also contend that the Police Department is not efficiently 
managing its resources now, that it employs too many unsworn officers and that 
the city could save money by contracting with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department for police services. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no cap for a homeowner," said Martha Bails, treasurer of the 
Committee Opposing Proposition D. "The next thing you know (the tax) will be 
$85 a year, then $100 a year. It will continually increase and will never be 
removed; therefore, the bad management can continue." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition D would boost property taxes $55 a year for homeowners and $55 a 
year per apartment unit. Senior citizens and disabled people who own their 
homes and earn less than $25,000 a year could apply for exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses would pay $5.50 per frontage foot with a cap of $5,000, and vacant 
properties would be assessed $1 per frontage foot, also with a $5,000 cap. 
Corner lots would be assessed on the shortest side of the property. 
</P>
<P>
The council would not be allowed to adjust the tax rate until July 6, 1993, and 
would need four of five council members in favor to approve any change. 
</P>
<P>
Although the council could raise the tax annually after that, the rate could 
not be boosted by more than the previous year's cost-of-living increase. That 
rate would be set by the Los Angeles All Urban Consumer Price Index, which 
provides a local measurement of the national consumer price index. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters say the measure's narrow defeat in June has rallied hundreds of 
volunteers to their side in the past few months. "People know the need (for 
police protection), we just need to get people out there to vote," Effler said. 
</P>
<P>
But opponents contend many voters are afraid to speak publicly in opposition to 
the measure out of fear of antagonizing police and members of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Said Bails: "No matter what, most people are opposed to taxes."

COUNTY TO CLOSE MENTAL HEALTH CLINICS IF PROP. 134 FAILS; 
</P>
<P>
SERVICES: CUTS WOULD CLOSE TWO SOUTH BAY CLINICS AND END CARE FOR 22,000 
LOW-INCOME PATIENTS COUNTYWIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Los Angeles County officials are prepared to close down two clinics serving 
more than 2,400 mentally ill patients in the South Bay if a tax initiative on 
the November ballot is defeated. 
</P>
<P>
The county plan also calls for slashing funding for several private mental 
health agencies that serve hundreds of other mentally ill people in the area. 
</P>
<P>
If the plan proceeds, it would be the second year in a row for clinic closures 
in the South Bay. Last year, the County Board of Supervisors closed the Coastal 
Community Mental Health Center in Carson and the Wilmington Mental Health 
Center. Staffing and service also were reduced at clinics in Hawthorne and San 
Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Psychologists and social workers said last week that the latest proposed 
reductions threaten to cripple an already thin supply of psychotherapeutic 
services for poor people in the South Bay, sending some psychotic and 
schizophrenic patients into the streets and landing others in already crowded 
jails and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
County officials blame the proposed cuts, which would total $40 million 
countywide, on reductions in state funding. Only a significant increase in the 
state alcohol tax, proposed in Proposition 134 on the statewide Nov. 6 ballot, 
can stave off the "drastic" reductions, said Roberto Quiroz, director of the 
Los Angeles County Mental Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 134 -- the so-called nickel-a-drink measure -- would raise about 
$760 million a year for a variety of social and health programs. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative has been opposed by a well-financed ad campaign. Opponents say 
it should be defeated because it would lock into the state budget higher levels 
of spending than the increased alcohol tax would raise. Thus, they warn, it 
could lead to other tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
If Prop. 134 is defeated, the cuts in the county's mental health budget could 
be adopted as soon as Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
A contingency plan circulated last week among county employees and private 
mental health providers estimates that the cuts would eliminate care for about 
22,000 of the 52,000 mostly low-income patients who now receive mental health 
treatment in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"Those people are seriously in need of some agency to help them meet the crises 
in their lives," said Ann Brand, president of the 42-member Assn. of Community 
Mental Health Agencies. "And those people are going to end up on your doorstep 
and on my doorstep and in much worse shape than they are now." 
</P>
<P>
The plan to cope with the projected cash shortage for mental health programs 
contemplates closing 12 of the county's 23 public mental health clinics and 
drastically reducing grants to private, nonprofit agencies that serve the 
mentally ill poor. 
</P>
<P>
The South Bay would lose the San Pedro Mental Health Center, which serves about 
700 patients, and the South Bay Mental Health Service Clinic in Hawthorne, with 
a case load of 1,737. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Vernon, acting district chief of the Hawthorne clinic, said the morale of 
both patients and employees has been hurt by the talk of the clinic's closure. 
Three workers have already left for more stable jobs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a call last week from a client who was hysterical," Vernon said. "Her 
therapist had just left and she had changed (therapists) twice in the last six 
months. She was real concerned about whether she would have to change again, 
and I had to tell her there was a possibility, even, that this clinic would be 
closing. 
</P>
<P>
"She was extremely frightened and scared and just said, 'Where am I going to 
go?' " Vernon said. 
</P>
<P>
Workers in private clinics would not be accustomed to handling the severe cases 
that routinely come to county facilities, Vernon said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the county plan, many privately operated centers for the mentally ill 
also would have their funding cut, which likely would leave fewer facilities to 
care for those who are pushed out of county clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with Excelsior House, a crisis treatment home in Inglewood for the 
mentally ill, said they would have to close if the county follows through with 
a proposed $500,000 cut. The 14-bed home serves clients from the South Bay and 
Westside. 
</P>
<P>
Project Return, a program based at St. George's Episcopal Church in Hawthorne, 
also would be forced to shut down, its officials said. The program establishes 
neighborhood clubs at which mentally ill people can meet to discuss how to cope 
with independent living after they have been released from state hospitals or 
from board-and-care homes. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Harbor View House in San Pedro said they would have to close 
the homeless residential program if the county cuts take effect. The home 
provides its clients with psychiatric care and housing for up to 12 days, as 
well as help in applying for government assistance, finding permanent homes and 
training for jobs. Six people can stay at the home at any time, and at least a 
dozen others daily receive services. 
</P>
<P>
The 1736 Family Crisis Center in Redondo Beach would lose about one-third of a 
budget that supports four programs -- a hot line for the suicidal and mentally 
ill, support groups for battered women and other traumatized groups, assessment 
and placement of the mentally ill in other treatment programs, and community 
education on such topics as child abuse and suicide prevention, said center 
director Carol Adelkoff. How the center would apportion the cuts is unclear, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
In place of the closed clinics, the county plans to operate an emergency 
system: Ten regional offices would provide medication and track 3,000 of the 
most disturbed patients, and Psychiatric Mobile Response Teams would respond to 
calls for emergency psychiatric care.

EMOTIONAL BATTLES OVER GROWTH MISSING FROM NORTH COUNTY ELECTION; 
</P>
<P>
VOTE: DISPARATE ISSUES MARK LOCAL POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS AS COMMUNITIES TURN 
INWARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For years when election time came to North County, passions and politics would 
rise in boisterous unison. 
</P>
<P>
And every trek to the polls was yet another bruising test of one gripping 
issue: how much the once broadly scenic outback of San Diego County should 
grow. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as the Nov. 6 election nears, North County's population stands at 810,000, 
and the fiery growth issue has quieted somewhat as the next generation of 
issues has arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The hyperbolic city council campaigns of the past have generally become 
lower-key affairs this time as candidates throughout North County talk about 
migrants, neighborhoods, providing enough schools and solving traffic 
congestion. 
</P>
<P>
It's as though each community is pensively looking inward, and the tone of the 
campaigns are as disparate as the region itself. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Oceanside is keeping its unofficial title as the bare-knuckled 
political capital of North County, with candidates vying in a power struggle 
over what faction holds a council majority. Perhaps more than any other city, 
growth remains a divisive issue. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in neighboring Carlsbad, nothing has emerged as a central concern, and the 
chief entertainment is watching an underdog candidate try to unseat the mayor, 
who is a 20-year council institution. 
</P>
<P>
Even in Encinitas, which was virtually making a headline a minute for the 
city's hard-line approach to its migrant problem, the issue of poor immigrants 
seeking work and shelter has been civilly discussed at forums. 
</P>
<P>
Among school matters, the only cliffhanger election is in Fallbrook, where 
school district officials and many parents suffered disappointment in June when 
a ballot measure to end overcrowding by building a new high school failed by 
100 votes. They will try again Nov. 6, asking for $35 million. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a rundown on North County's city council elections and significant 
school board races: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vista 
</P>
<P>
The City Council race has attracted only two challengers to incumbent Mayor 
Gloria McClellan, and two challengers for two council seats where both 
incumbents are seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Campaigning has focused on such chronic issues as residential and commercial 
growth and the direction of the city's downtown redevelopment efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to topple McClellan, who first was elected to the council in 1972 and 
has served two consecutive two-year terms as the city's elected mayor, are G. 
Kevin Auen, a United Parcel Service delivery driver, and Craig Heiller, a 
landscape contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Starting with this election, the mayor will be chosen for a four-year term, 
reflecting the length of office for council members. 
</P>
<P>
Opposing the reelection of council incumbents Jeannette Smith, a certified 
public accountant, and Gene Asmus, a local businessman and assistant city 
manager for the city of Chula Vista, are Dal Williams, a college instructor and 
former member of the Vista Planning Commission, and Ted G. Cole, a construction 
foreman. 
</P>
<P>
Cole, Auen and Heiller are campaigning on a slow-growth slate -- even though 
Auen and Heiller are running for the same seat -- while the incumbents argue 
that Vista is 80% built out and the growth issue is being raised as a bogyman 
to unseat them. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, six candidates are running for two open seats on the Vista Unified 
School District board. The race has featured a conservative family values 
campaign against teen promiscuity and homosexuality by two candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Candidate Deidre Holliday, a registered nurse, said "in general, the family is 
very threatened, and the schools need to support the family." She added, "there 
is waning parental control over what is taught in schools about family values." 
</P>
<P>
Sharing her philosophy is James Morgan, an aerospace administrator. The two are 
running against sex education in the schools and for stronger anti-drug 
education. 
</P>
<P>
The other candidates are incumbent James Hagar; Sandee Carter, a parent and 
community volunteer; Linda Cole, a businesswoman; and Elaine Earle, a customer 
services manager. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Escondido 
</P>
<P>
There is no City Council race this election.

The Escondido Union High School board election features three incumbents and 
one challenger with three seats open. The challenger, Michael Morasco, a 
physical therapist and businessman, is basing his campaign on concern about the 
physical deterioration of schools. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the different mechanical systems are falling apart -- air conditioning, 
heating, lights, plumbing, you name it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbents are John Cherrington, Bruce Studebaker and Bill Horn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oceanside 
</P>
<P>
Eleven candidates are piling on in pursuit of two City Council seats. While the 
sometimes testy rhetoric centers on growth and city spending, the greater 
meaning of this election is which faction controls the council. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, a four-member majority is generally receptive to growth and 
development in San Diego County's third-largest city. The council's outsider is 
anti-growth Melba Bishop, who other council members openly lambaste as brazenly 
political and disruptive. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Bishop has a following, and this is her chance to form a council 
majority if proteges Nancy York, a local tax attorney, and Don Rodee, an 
airline pilot, are elected. 
</P>
<P>
It won't be easy, as one of the seats up for grabs belongs to incumbent 
Councilwoman Lucy Chavez, whose well-financed campaign and strong downtown 
constituency make her a formidable candidate. 
</P>
<P>
A strong candidate more palatable to the council majority is businessman Tim 
Aldrich, the former president of the Chamber of Commerce and more of a centrist 
on the growth issue. 
</P>
<P>
York, who ran once before and lost, said the current council might be defending 
the city's growth control law, Proposition A, in a lawsuit brought by 
developers, but "they haven't implemented Prop. A, they continue to circumvent 
it" by allowing exemptions to the growth cap. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a fast-growth, pro-developer majority on the council," she maintains. 
</P>
<P>
Beside Chavez, Aldridge, Rodee and York, the other candidates are: Ralph 
Caballero, a businessman; Hollis W. Skinner, an industrial specialist manager; 
Jack Bullard, who is retired; Ann McElwee, a registered nurse; and Margaret 
McKenna, a business consultant. McKenna, Abe Edlin and Lois Mizzell did not 
write candidate statements and thus are not included in the voter pamphlet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Poway 
</P>
<P>
Growth-induced traffic has turned city officials from isolationism to taking a 
regional approach as most of the rural city's congestion comes from outside its 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
The traffic situation has become the focus of the mayoral election as City 
Councilmen Bob Emery and Jan Goldsmith both campaign to become the first 
elected mayor in the history of the 10-year-old city. 
</P>
<P>
Both candidates tout their regional political connections as qualifying them to 
lead the city toward a solution to the traffic problem. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the mayor's race, five candidates, including incumbent Councilman Don 
Higginson, are seeking two seats on the council. The other candidates are 
Victoria Lazowski, a businesswoman; B. "Tony" Snesko, a businessman; Barry 
Stratton, a businessman; and Alan Sugarman, a design manager. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Claude (Bud) Lewis, a 20-year council veteran who has helped guide the 
city through its growth-management plan and downtown redevelopment, is being 
challenged in his second mayoral bid by Margaret Bonas. 
</P>
<P>
Bonas, elected to the Carlsbad Municipal Water District board and possessing an 
extensive background on water issues, said it's time for fresh ideas on the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
Yet she agrees with Lewis on two major points. They oppose SDG&amp;E's possible 
plan to build a second energy plant at the coastal Encina facility. And they 
believe the city's migrant problem is best solved by stronger control at the 
U.S.-Mexico border rather than maintaining a checkpoint for aliens in North 
County. 
</P>
<P>
But Bonas argues that "new larger developments should be put on hold until 
after the water situation is stabilized," referring to the continuing drought. 
She also faults the council generally for failing to take the initiative, 
saying "they've done nothing until they saw other people doing something about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
She's got her work cut out if she aspires to displace Lewis. Vice Mayor Ann 
Kulchin, who isn't up for reelection this time, observed there are virtually no 
issues galvanizing voter dissent. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no nasty letters to the editor, no people standing up at the 
forums," she said, predicting the election will be a "big cake walk" for Lewis 
and incumbent Councilman John Mamaux. 
</P>
<P>
Beside the mayor's race, two council seats are being contested: Mamaux's and 
the one being vacated by Councilman Mark Pettine, who is not seeking another 
term. 
</P>
<P>
Running for the two seats, beside Mamaux, is Julianne Nygaard, a Carlsbad 
Unified School District trustee; James Swab, a retired comptroller/accountant; 
and Margaret Stanton, president of the Chamber of Commerce and executive vice 
president of Jazzercise, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
There's an interesting nuance -- a low-key debate over achieving racial balance 
in schools -- in the contest for three seats on the Carlsbad Unified School 
District's board, a race that's drawn six candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Candidate Paul Szegedi, a businessman, said "it's important to achieve racial 
balance because we have to show our children that there is a racially-balanced 
society." He favors redistricting or magnet programs to reach an ethnic balance 
in the district, which has a significant Latino population. 
</P>
<P>
However, a different view is taken by candidate Mark Packard, a dentist, who 
maintains that "forced integration doesn't end racism. . . .I think kids should 
go to the schools where they live. I don't think it's appropriate to move kids 
from one section of Carlsbad to another just to create an artificial ethnic 
balance." 
</P>
<P>
The four other candidates are incumbent trustees Donald Johnson and J. Edward 
Switzer, Jr.; Catheryn Ann Reilly, a telecommunications manager; and Sharon 
Faithful, a small business owner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Solana Beach 
</P>
<P>
It's a polite campaign as four candidates compete for two seats on the City 
Council. The candidates, including incumbent Councilwoman Margaret Schlesinger, 
all favor maintaining the small-town character of Solana Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Realtor Deen Austin says he appreciates the fact that people still call each 
other by their first names around town and he wants to preserve that feeling by 
establishing goodwill between residents and business people. 
</P>
<P>
Schlesinger points out such accomplishments as a strong general plan for the 
community, a new Parks and Recreation Department, and construction of a new 
fire station. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Biehl, program director of the local senior center, said the needs of the 
city's aging population must be addressed by more housing for lower-income 
people. She also said solving traffic problems, curbing crime, meeting 
redevelopment goals and building a commuter rail station are among her 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Tompkins, president of the Solana Beach Chamber of Commerce, said 
redevelopment is the city's main issue. He wants to see signs limited, a 
uniform appearance, and easy parking put into any redevelopment plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
San Marcos 
</P>
<P>
Voters will be asked to lengthen the elected mayor's term from two to four 
years, starting with the winner of the Nov. 6 mayoral election. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Lee Thibadeau faces opposition from Edward Aubuchon, a management 
engineer and a retired Air Force pilot who says he wants to bring order to what 
he considers unregulated city development. 
</P>
<P>
Vying for two council seats are incumbents Pia Harris and Mark Loscher and 
challengers Cynthia Skovgard, a chiropractor, and Lita Bowles, a community 
volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign is short on weighty issues since Proposition R two years ago 
required developers to pay their own way for growth. A controversial $300 
million trash-to-energy plant is before the county -- and out of city hands -- 
for approval or rejection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Encinitas 
</P>
<P>
The City Council election for two seats, not surprisingly, has shaped up around 
the influx of documented and undocumented migrant workers who city officials 
have tried to control. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the six candidates -- August Anderson, an attorney; John Davis, an 
insurance broker; Maura Wiegand, an Olivenhain Community Advisory Board member; 
and David Potter Duff, an attorney and part-time actor -- have criticized the 
council's actions on the migrant issue. 
</P>
<P>
Claiming the council has been harsh toward migrants, they focus their attacks 
on incumbent Marjorie Gaines, the city's first mayor and a hard-liner on the 
migrant matter. 
</P>
<P>
Gaines defends the city's accomplishments during her tenure, citing road 
improvements, park acquisitions and preparation of a strong general plan. Greg 
Grajek, a local financial adviser, is running in tandem with Gaines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fallbrook 
</P>
<P>
Proposition Y is the Fallbrook Unified School District's latest effort to ease 
current and future student overcrowding. The measure, which requires a 
two-thirds voter majority to pass, would authorize $35 million in general 
obligation bonds to build a new high school and renovate Fallbrook high. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, a similar measure was defeated by a mere 100 votes, and school 
supporters believe the latest campaign has been better organized. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping that once the voters become fully informed about the situation 
at the high school, they will vote yes on this," said Karen Miller, a leader 
for passage of Proposition Y. 
</P>
<P>
Foes argue that multistory structures could be built on the current high school 
site to handle projected enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Tom Cooper, who has two children at Fallbrook high, said, "I'm 
stumping for saving the one campus, expanding it to the point where it's 
suitable for a population of 5,000, and then going on to build another one if 
and when that place is filled."

POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: IT'S A SIGN THAT ELECTION SEASON IS IN FULL BLOOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Turf tussle: A sign war is raging in Lawndale, where candidates for City 
Council have taken their battle to the city's front yards. 
</P>
<P>
Candidate Gary McDonald told reporters last week that he spotted rival Norm 
Lagerquist tearing down the campaign sign of a third council hopeful, Ron 
Maxwell, on a resident's front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
A local newspaper gave the story big play, publishing McDonald's claim that 
Lagerquist turned "ghost white" after being caught "red-handed" in this crude 
attempt at street-side spin control. 
</P>
<P>
But the issue, it turns out, was not so clear-cut. 
</P>
<P>
Lagerquist says he had every right to do what he did: The Maxwell poster, he 
says, had been stapled onto a stake carrying a Lagerquist sign. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell admits this is true. But he says Millie Morales, who rents the house 
where the sign removal occurred, did not want more posts driven into her lawn. 
He says she gave him permission to tack his sign to Lagerquist's stake. 
</P>
<P>
Morales confirms Maxwell's account, but says she'll never let a candidate place 
a sign in her yard again. Politics, she discovered, knows no boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a Jehovah's Witness and we don't vote anyway," Morales said. "I told my 
husband we shouldn't do this because then we're going to be involved. And look 
what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Color of money: His campaign account slipping into the red, but congressional 
candidate Guy Kimbrough is counting on a pair of well-known artists to paint 
him into the black before the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
Artists Richard Serra and John Baldessari have each agreed to donate 10 
limited-edition prints of one of their paintings to Kimbrough, who is trying to 
unseat U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach). 
</P>
<P>
The prints will be offered to supporters in exchange for $1,000 campaign 
contributions, the maximum allowed by law. 
</P>
<P>
Serra and Baldessari's donations are part of an effort by artists to oppose 
politicians who want to rein in the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Among the targets is Rohrabacher, who led an unsuccessful attempt in the House 
this month to bar NEA support for art projects that offend any religion, are 
"indecent" or could be interpreted as denigrating the American flag. 
</P>
<P>
That has left Kimbrough with a new sense of art appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be down to zip by 6 o'clock today," he said Thursday, referring to the 
cash balance in his campaign account. "We need a minimum of $15,000 to pull the 
last part of this campaign together." 
</P>
<P>
Write-ins: South Bay oil refineries can produce more than fuel. This year, two 
of their byproducts are Socialist Workers Party write-in candidates for 
statewide office. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Britton, a plant operator at Chevron's El Segundo refinery, has filed 
papers as the party's candidate for governor. And Eli Green, a pipe fitter at 
Arco's Carson refinery, is the insurance commissioner candidate for the party, 
which does not have enough members to qualify its candidates for the state 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Among the party's main planks: U.S. forces should not wage war in the Persian 
Gulf, the government should not tax wage-earners, and unions should form a 
nationwide labor party to represent the interests of U.S. workers. 
</P>
<P>
The deployment of U.S. troops in the gulf only stands to benefit big business, 
he says, whereas soldiers from working families are the ones who would be 
placed at risk. 
</P>
<P>
"This would be an example of a rich man's war but a poor man's fight," he said 
Friday. "It's hypocrisy." 
</P>
<P>
Political touring: With cassettes, freeway drivers can study languages, 
meditate or even gain what it takes to lose weight or quit smoking. Why not 
prepare for the Nov. 6 crush of ballot propositions while behind the wheel? 
</P>
<P>
Tape recordings describing state and county propositions are being offered by 
several South Bay public libraries, including those in Inglewood, Torrance and 
Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The tapes, supplied by the Secretary of State's Office, contain the official 
title and summary of ballot measures along with an analysis and arguments pro 
and con. 
</P>
<P>
The cassettes may save potential voters from eye strain but, oh, those ears.

FIGHT AT END OF FOOTBALL GAME IS INVESTIGATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An altercation at the end of a sophomore football game between Hawthorne and 
Inglewood high schools Thursday is being investigated by Inglewood police and 
officials at the Centinela Valley Union High School District. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood police said Saturday they received complaints of the incident from a 
member of the Hawthorne coaching staff and an Inglewood High School student. 
</P>
<P>
The skirmish occurred immediately after Hawthorne won the game at Sentinel 
Field in Inglewood, said Dan Finnegan, public information officer for the 
Centinela Valley district. 
</P>
<P>
Finnegan said he had received reports that Inglewood players started a fight 
with the Hawthorne team after the game. One unidentified Hawthorne cheerleader 
was treated for injuries, Finnegan said. District officials are gathering 
reports from Hawthorne High School officials who attended the game, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A fight broke out when Hawthorne football players and visitors were leaving, 
said Maurice Wiley, Inglewood school district spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a feeling it was hot tempers more than anything else," Wiley said. 
</P>
<P>
Finnegan said game referees are planning to file a report with the California 
Interscholastic Federation-Southern Section, the governing body for high school 
sports in the region.

SERIOUS INJURIES IN AUTO CRASHES COST MORE THAN FATAL ONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK BOMSTER, THE BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BALTIMORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 44-year-old scientist was driving home from work in his pickup truck. He 
was wearing his seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
A car going in the opposite direction crossed the median, out of control, at 
about 50 m.p.h. (73 feet per second) and hit the pickup head-on. 
</P>
<P>
Both drivers survived, but the scientist got the worst of it: severe brain 
damage and extensive lower-body injuries that necessitated a year of 
rehabilitation and generated $222,000 in medical bills within six months of the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
Recovering from the brain damage was especially difficult, because the injury 
worked subtle changes on the man's personality and placed a severe strain on 
his family. 
</P>
<P>
After six months at home, he was able to return to work just one day a week, 
under the careful supervision of his employers. 
</P>
<P>
Such stories are typical of people injured in high-speed car crashes, according 
to researchers at the Shock-Trauma Unit in Baltimore, where a comprehensive 
study of highway crash injuries is being sponsored by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
Though more than 40,000 people are killed on the roads each year, the thousands 
of others who are severely injured put a far heavier financial burden on 
society. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report prepared for Congress last year, automobile crashes 
resulted in direct costs of $12.3 billion in 1985. Total projected lifetime 
costs from those injuries was far greater, $48.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Severe crashes that do not cause death carry the highest price, according to 
other figures cited by the Shock-Trauma researchers: $179,881 in direct 
treatment costs, compared to $1,471 in the average fatal crash. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the injury that's driving that insurance bill up," said Dr. John H. 
Siegel, chief of the Shock-Trauma study. "You've got to reduce the injuries and 
reduce the cost of insurance." 
</P>
<P>
According to one nationwide estimate cited in the report, just 2% of all 
non-fatal crashes are likely to account for 44% of lifetime medical costs from 
such accidents. 
</P>
<P>
The injured often are young, working people of limited means. Many of the 
subjects of the study had no medical insurance: The costs of their treatment 
was borne by medical assistance programs. 
</P>
<P>
Even those with good insurance coverage can use up their benefits. All of that 
leads Siegel to conclude that medical and insurance savings would far outweigh 
the cost of making safer cars. 
</P>
<P>
That fact may do more to alter car design than the annual body count, he said, 
adding that big dollar figures have "a tremendous impact in our society -- far 
more than death and disability." 
</P>
<P>
New vehicles now must meet federal crash test standards that are based on a 
head-on crash into a fixed barrier at 30 m.p.h. In addition, the government 
publishes 35-m.p.h. crash data on a limited number of models, strictly for 
consumer information. 
</P>
<P>
Seat belts and shoulder belts have long been required in passenger cars. As of 
the 1990 model year, all cars must be equipped with passive restraints, such as 
air bags or automatic seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler, which has driver's-side air bags in all its vehicles made in the 
United States starting with the 1990 model year, estimated that the devices 
cost the manufacturer $300 per vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Slechter, a Chrysler Corp. regulatory expert, said the easiest way to 
build a more crash-resistant car is to add metal to the vehicle's structure. 
</P>
<P>
But "adding safety adds weight," he said. "When you add weight, you lose fuel 
efficiency," and cars also must meet certain federal requirements for fuel 
efficiency, Slechter said. 
</P>
<P>
He also noted that even a simple increase in the barrier-crash standard, to 35 
m.p.h., "essentially requires a total redesign of the car." 
</P>
<P>
Yet some government-sponsored research has suggested that a safer vehicle could 
be marketed with a moderate or nominal increase in price. 
</P>
<P>
MCR Technology Inc., a Santa Barbara-based car safety research and development 
firm, worked under contract to the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration in the 1970s and designed, from scratch, a car capable of 
passing a 50-m.p.h. crash test. 
</P>
<P>
"The cost today to do the same thing would be not more than 10%," MCR president 
Donald Friedman said. He said that the earlier estimate included start-up costs 
for adding air bags and other safety systems that are now fully developed and 
on the market.

A TWO-PART AGENDA FOR ORANGE COUNTY; 
</P>
<P>
PUT DISTANCE BETWEEN OFFICIALS, DEVELOPERS; GIVE MEASURE M CHANCE TO UNCLOG 
TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With all that Orange County has going for it, there are two things that it must 
do as the next century approaches. First, it's time for public officials to put 
a greater distance between themselves and the developers whose projects are 
often summarily approved without much weight given to order and balanced 
growth. Second, the county's transportation network must be improved so that it 
can begin to handle the demands already put on it. 
</P>
<P>
Some opponents of Measure M, the half-cent sales tax for transportation 
improvements, have confused these separate issues, arguing that the initiative 
is a sop to developers draped in a blueprint for public improvements. But to 
prepare for the future, the county must address the problems of 
pedal-to-the-metal development and an antiquated infrastructure individually, 
as well as in concert. 
</P>
<P>
The first challenge, exercising better control over growth, is a matter of 
making sure that past mistakes are not repeated. The other one, making badly 
needed infrastructure repairs in the transportation system, has to be 
understood as correcting yesterday's mistakes, since, after all, it is too late 
to completely undo the past. 
</P>
<P>
Measure M will help the developers only in the way that it will help everyone 
who lives and does business in Orange County. If the county were a tabula rasa, 
one could argue that improved roads would aid and abet the cause of greedy 
developers. But these days, there are other market forces at work driving 
development decisions in Orange County. New and better transportation arteries 
alone won't fuel growth if there is a softening real estate market and a 
growing public perception that new development must be better managed, both to 
protect the threatened environment and to provide the kind of housing that 
people want and can afford. 
</P>
<P>
But everyone would lose if Measure M failed to pass. The county immediately 
would forfeit $85 million in matching funds for transportation projects. Over 
the next 20 years, the figure is over $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
That's money Orange County can have for the asking. So what are we all doing 
stuck in traffic?

GUARD ISSUE CITED IN PRINGLE-UMBERG CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Pringle Defends Seat in Hot O.C. Assembly Race" (Oct. 21) exposes several 
issues concerning this Assembly seat. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, it is true that the district is largely Democratic and that its 
voters are still conservative and are perfectly willing to elect a Republican. 
However, even conservative Democrats are intelligent and sensitive. They are 
very well aware of the racist and prejudicial act of the Republican Party in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to what (Curt) Pringle says, this past action on behalf of Pringle is 
an issue and will continue to be an issue in future elections. The Republican 
Party, and in particular Pringle and his cohorts, paid uniformed guards to 
watch the heavily Latino/Chicano voting places. 
</P>
<P>
The posting of these guards at the 22 most heavily Latino/Hispanic/Chicano 
polling places by the Republican Party and directed, supported and paid for by 
Pringle, is not a case of conservatives versus liberals or Democrats versus 
Republicans. It is anti-American, anti-civil rights and anti-human rights. Many 
Anglo, Republican, conservative, moral Americans have spoken against this 
racist act. These persons will be voting against Mr. Pringle this time around. 
</P>
<P>
Second, either Mr. Pringle is talking out of both sides of his mouth or speaks 
with a forked tongue, or both. (Pringle) stated that "Politics was a way to 
improve your area and have a say." Well, posting poll guards paid with 
Republican funds can hardly be a way to improve "his" area. 
</P>
<P>
Improving means to make it better. I fail to see how the posting of the 
uniformed poll guards to deprive a segment of people of their civil rights -- 
the right to vote -- can make an area better. Mr. Pringle has yet to apologize 
or acknowledge any wrongdoing on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement of $400,000 cannot buy the Latino out. No amount of money is 
going to wash away the pain or the shame committed against a group of people 
who have for so long worked, fought and earned this most privileged right, the 
right to elect a person who can and will represent them. The right to vote is 
sacred for it gives us representation. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Crow days are past, even for the Latinos. We will no longer be intimidated! 
Justice will be served and Mr. Pringle can return to his family business. 
Meanwhile, in Sacramento, Mr. Tom Umberg will be representing all of his 
constituents -- liberals, conservatives, Democrats and Republicans.

LITTLE COMPETITION -- LESS ACHIEVEMENT; 
</P>
<P>
THERE'S NOT MUCH TO SHOUT ABOUT AMONG ORANGE COUNTY'S DELEGATES IN SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democrat Howard Adler, opponent to Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), 
jokingly identifies his campaign materials as coming from "The Committee to 
Please Don't Elect Howard Adler for Assembly." It's a wry recognition of his 
decision merely to occupy a place on the ballot in the overwhelmingly 
Republican 70th District, which Ferguson is expected to win easily. Indeed, 
with one exception, all of Orange County's state legislative incumbents are 
expected to sail through the Nov. 6 election with barely a need for 
campaigning, or comment. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the election provides a good time to evaluate Orange County's delegates 
in Sacramento. There's not much to shout about. 
</P>
<P>
At the bottom of the list is Ferguson, who uses his seat as a soapbox for his 
extreme viewpoints. He reached a low point with his resolution defending as 
"militarily justified" the mass roundup and detention of Japanese-Americans 
during World War II. After a bitter floor debate, it was soundly defeated. 
</P>
<P>
That same debate, however, provided Assemblyman Robert C. Frazee (R-Carlsbad), 
who spoke against it, with one of his finest hours. But Frazee, whose district 
covers part of Orange County, also disappointed when he took vacation during 
last summer's deadlock over the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
As for the others: 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress) focused on gill net legislation which, 
while worthy, was puzzling, given her landlocked district. Assemblyman John R. 
Lewis (R-Orange) concentrated on GOP political strategy but had his troubles 
over the unauthorized use of then-President Reagan's signature on campaign 
literature. Assemblyman Nolan Frizzelle (R-Huntington Beach) voted against 
oil-spill legislation in the wake of one of the worst spills in Orange County 
history. Assembly Minority Leader Ross Johnson (R-La Habra) spent his energies 
managing an unruly GOP caucus. Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), who 
faces a stiff challenge from Democrat Tom Umberg, did little in his freshman 
term. 
</P>
<P>
On the state Senate side, only Edward R. Royce (R-Anaheim) is on the ballot. 
There's not much to say other than things could be worse. 
</P>
<P>
Neither of the county's best legislators -- state Sens. John Seymour 
(R-Anaheim) and Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) -- is up for reelection. Both 
are able, work hard and are oriented to issues. They set the standard against 
which the county's other legislators fall short.

O.C. CONGRESSMEN: TIME FOR ASSESSMENT; 
</P>
<P>
RANTINGS OF SOME OBSCURE DELEGATION'S ACHIEVEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's five representatives in Congress are without significant 
opposition in the Nov. 6 general election, all Republicans occupying "safe" 
seats in heavily GOP districts. They will be returned to Washington without the 
inconvenience of having to defend their records. Nevertheless, the election 
provides an occasion to assess the incumbents' service to their districts, 
Orange County and the nation during the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
As a group, the delegation has one major achievement: gaining approval of 
long-awaited federal funding for the $1.5-billion Santa Ana River flood-control 
project. The project is vital to Orange and other counties in the event of a 
catastrophic flood, thought to be inevitable in the next century. But finding 
federal dollars required hard work and cooperation to push the project through 
the budget process. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Orange County's delegation is better known in Washington for the 
rantings of Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of Long Beach about the National Endowment 
for the Arts. Or the homophobia of Rep. William E. Dannemeyer of Fullerton, 
apparent when he takes the microphone to speak about AIDS. Or the excessive 
oratory of Robert K. Dornan of Garden Grove on just about anything. They have 
made Orange County somewhat of a joke in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
What tends to get lost in the shuffle are the accomplishments of Orange 
County's other two legislators, Rep. Ron Packard of Carlsbad, who is up for his 
fifth term, and Rep. Christopher Cox of Newport Beach, who is seeking his 
second. 
</P>
<P>
Packard, who represents South County, is a good-government legislator who does 
his homework and has something to show for it. A member of the Public Works and 
Transportation Committee, he has made his mark on water rights and aviation 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Cox was quickly identified as a leader among the 1988 crop of new congressional 
members. He has focused on much-needed federal budget reform and brought energy 
and conviction to an office that his predecessor, Robert E. Badham, used 
primarily as a resting point between trips abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan is the hardest to assess. He blusters and is melodramatic and corny. And 
he has angered homosexual groups with his invective on them during floor 
debates. But he's charming and shows a surprising ability to work with members 
of Congress on the opposite side of the aisle. Recently, for example, he and 
Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) co-authored a bill that would create an ROTC-like 
Police Corps to train and educate law enforcement officers. It's a good idea 
that is still on track in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
As for Dannemeyer, he has undermined his legitimate concerns about the health 
community's response to the AIDS epidemic by dismissing all gays simply as 
"sinners" in need of redemption and perhaps even punishment. It's a cruel and 
simplistic approach to a disease that is killing people in all socioeconomic 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves Rohrabacher, who seems to be trying to take the path from Orange 
County to political fame first blazed by Richard M. Nixon as a congressman: 
adopt an extreme position on one issue and demagogue it to death. Having no 
Alger Hiss to kick around, Rohrabacher joined with Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) to 
try to dismantle the NEA. So far, Congress has wisely resisted their efforts, 
but much damage has been done to artistic expression. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, it's a mixed bag of representation for Orange County, which 
deserves better.

TAYLOR'S STATISTICS ARE DOWN, BUT HE IS STILL A GIANT FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VITO STELLINO, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pro football's Superman has spent some time playing Clark Kent lately. 
</P>
<P>
When New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor collected three sacks and 
forced a fumble in the season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles, despite 
skipping training camp while holding out, it enhanced the Superman reputation 
of the nine-time Pro Bowler. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, though, Taylor has looked, at times, like a 31-year-old linebacker. 
He's had a total of just 1 1/2 sacks the past five games and none in the past 
three. 
</P>
<P>
When he lines up against the Washington Redskins on Sunday, he'll be trying to 
end a drought of two games without a sack against a team he once terrorized. 
</P>
<P>
Giants Coach Bill Parcells said: "It's different when you're 31 than it is when 
you're 21. It takes him a little while longer to recover from games than it 
used to, and he has to deal with that, too." 
</P>
<P>
It's also tougher on Taylor now that the team's other outside linebacker, Carl 
Banks, is on injured reserve with a damaged wrist. Opposing teams can run away 
from Taylor more effectively. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor says skipping training camp has taken its toll. It took time for him to 
get in shape, and he was set back when he pulled a hamstring against the Miami 
Dolphins on Sept. 23. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually in the fourth quarter, when everyone else is tired, I can step it up 
and make some plays. That hasn't happened this year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, though, still commands respect. 
</P>
<P>
Redskins Coach Joe Gibbs seemed to get upset when it was suggested two weeks 
ago that the Redskins showed last year they could stop Taylor. The game two 
weeks ago hasn't changed Gibbs' mind. 
</P>
<P>
According to the coach, Taylor changes the Redskins' playbook. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to add up everything he does to you, it starts with the things you 
can't do right off the bat. You don't run certain plays against him. It's hard 
to run a lot of your favorite things. You have to change your style of 
offense," Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins often double-team Taylor with tackle Jim Lachey and tight end Don 
Warren and occasionally get wide receiver Ricky Sanders in his way. 
</P>
<P>
Parcells said: "Several teams have decided he's not going to ruin their game. 
Teams have decided to do something about him and guys like Reggie White (of the 
Eagles)." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who says he'll retire when his contract expires after the 1992 season, 
points to the double-teaming as a sign that he's still a force. 
</P>
<P>
"When they start blocking me with a single person and not worrying where I'm at 
or what I'm doing, that's when I know I'm just another ballplayer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor doesn't appear concerned about his age. 
</P>
<P>
"Three weeks ago, I was the greatest thing since white bread. All of a sudden 
now, 'Oh, he's too old.' I don't think you're going to find a whole lot of 
people saying, 'He's ready for the junkyard.' That's quite evident by what 
teams are doing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Giants General Manager George Young says Taylor's only problem is living up to 
his reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"The trouble with great players, like great coaches, is that they're fighting 
their own legend every week," Young said.

KLINGLER ROLLS SEVEN AGAINST ARKANSAS, 62-28; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSTON: QUARTERBACK HAS SEVEN TOUCHDOWN PASSES AND 457 YARDS FOR UNBEATEN 
COUGARS. RAZORBACKS LOSE FOURTH IN A ROW.

<TEXT>
<P>
Houston scaled new heights Saturday, and Arkansas plunged to one of its 
all-time lows. 
</P>
<P>
David Klingler passed for 457 yards and a career-high seven touchdowns and the 
sixth-ranked Cougars scored 38 consecutive points to rout Arkansas, 62-28, 
extending the Razorbacks' losing streak to four games. 
</P>
<P>
Houston, 7-0 overall and 6-0 in the Southwest Conference, stretched its winning 
streak to 11, best in school history and longest in the nation. The Cougars are 
off to their hottest start since 1979, when they went 8-0. 
</P>
<P>
"When Arkansas got a 14-7 lead, we showed great character to come back and 
score," Houston Coach John Jenkins said. "After that, we sort of overpowered 
them the rest of the way." 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas (2-5, 0-4) hasn't started a season this poorly since 1958, when it 
opened with six losses. During their losing streak, the Razorbacks have given 
up an average of 53.5 points and been outscored, 214-115. The 62 points were 
the most ever scored against Arkansas in an SWC game, topping the 60 by Baylor 
in 1922. 
</P>
<P>
"We're embarrassed," Arkansas Coach Jack Crowe said. "We've come to a low part 
of our season. We have to see what we can do to bounce back from this." 
</P>
<P>
Klingler tied the school and SWC record of seven touchdown passes set last year 
against Temple by Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware. His passing yardage was 
four short of his career high, established last week against Southern 
Methodist. 
</P>
<P>
"Klingler is the trigger man on our run and shoot. If he's not clicking, the 
offense doesn't go," Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Klingler threw scoring passes to six receivers -- Verlond Brown, Tracy Good, 
Patrick Cooper, Marcus Grant, Chuck Weatherspoon and Craig Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
Good caught two touchdown tosses, covering 15 and four yards. Klingler also 
threw scoring passes of 42 yards to Grant, 26 to Cooper, 25 to Brown, 24 to 
Alexander and 14 to Weatherspoon. 
</P>
<P>
Klingler, who set NCAA records for completions and attempts with a 48-of-76 
performance against SMU, connected on 34 of 51 with three interceptions against 
Arkansas. The junior has thrown for more than 400 yards in six of seven games 
this season, making him a serious contender for the Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
"He's headed in that direction," Jenkins said. "If we end the season 11-0, 
there is no doubt we should win the national championship and David should win 
the Heisman Trophy." 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars, who lead the nation in passing, trailed, 14-7, after the first 
quarter before scoring 38 consecutive points. After Roman Anderson kicked a 
22-yard field goal, Klingler threw five touchdown passes -- including four in a 
7:59 span -- to put the Cougars ahead, 45-14, in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas quarterback Quinn Grovey threw a pair of touchdown passes to Lyndy 
Lindsey late in the third quarter to make the score 45-28. The Razorbacks drove 
to the Houston 28 midway through the fourth quarter, but an interception by 
Jamie Mouton ended the threat and helped Houston end an eight-game losing 
streak against the Hogs. 
</P>
<P>
Weatherspoon, bouncing back from injuries and flu, rushed 21 times for 140 
yards and caught five passes for 45 yards. Five Houston receivers had at least 
four receptions, with Manny Hazard and Good grabbing six each.

HANSEN PREDICTS KING TURNAROUND 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Call Bobby Hansen courageous. Call him a fool. Either way, Hansen is willing to 
predict a major turnaround for the Sacramento Kings right now. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can win half our games and get to the playoffs this season," he 
said. "I like to set goals for myself. I think that's a reasonable one." 
</P>
<P>
If the Kings win 41 of their 82 games, it would be their best showing in eight 
years, an 18-game improvement over last season. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen's prediction has little chance of coming true. The club lacks an impact 
player such as David Robinson, who is capable of leading an overnight 
reformation. 
</P>
<P>
But Hansen doesn't mind taking courageous stands. He has built an unlikely NBA 
career on his eagerness to defend territory that others would abandon. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen, 29, was a third-round draft pick who entered the NBA in 1983 with 
nothing more than a prayer for success. Now, after seven seasons with the Utah 
Jazz, he remains a productive member of the NBA fraternity, helping the Kings 
rebuild their club. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been an underdog," Hansen said. "I wasn't supposed to make it in 
the league, because I was a third-round pick. They don't even have a third 
round anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen built his reputation with defense. NBA defense has traditionally 
required more desire than skill, more hunger than talent. Hansen had desire. 
And he was hungry. 
</P>
<P>
"I got into the league playing defense and stayed in the league playing 
defense," he said. "I'll always play defense." 
</P>
<P>
Several of Utah's most memorable basketball moments featured Hansen playing 
defense. The big guard harassed Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers in 
1988, pushing them to seven games in the Western Conference semifinals before 
falling. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone said we didn't have a chance, and we probably didn't," Hansen said. 
"We were just five guys -- we had no depth -- but we played hard and took it to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1986 playoffs, Hansen impressed many NBA coaches with his defensive 
effort against Rolando Blackman and the Dallas Mavericks. Among the coaches 
nodding approval was Dick Motta, Blackman's boss at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"All I've ever tried to do is hold the other guy under his scoring average," 
Hansen said. "After the Dallas series, people realized I could play." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his devotion to defense, Hansen has nurtured a desire to contribute 
offensively since his college days at Iowa. He has never confused himself with 
Michael Jordan. But he would like to score a little. 
</P>
<P>
Utah's failure to provide even a single play for Hansen led to frustration. 
Last season, Hansen started wishing the Jazz would trade him. 
</P>
<P>
"You like to get a little positive input, but there really wasn't much," he 
said. "You would think they could have run at least one play for me, but it was 
zero. There was nothing. All I did was set picks and play defense. It got a 
little stale." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen knew Utah's offense was designed to get the ball to Karl Malone -- "They 
had to feed the big dog," he said -- but also realized that reliance on Malone 
was a major vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
"We had only one guy to go to, and everyone knew it," Hansen said. "That's why 
we always got knocked out of the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
In June, Hansen became a partial solution to the problem. When the Jazz decided 
to add a weapon by acquiring Jeff Malone, the chief scorer from the Bullets, a 
three-way deal was arranged. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen and Jazz center Eric Leckner moved to Sacramento. Kings center Pervis 
Ellison went to Washington. The Malone population doubled in the Jazz locker 
room. 
</P>
<P>
Now Hansen is revitalized. He enjoys working with Motta and watching the young 
Kings come together. He considers himself a tutor and a leader. He's also 
pleased that Motta granted him the freedom to launch an occasional jumper. 
</P>
<P>
"Hansen can hit his shot when he's open," Motta said. "I want him to shoot it." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen displayed no caution when he talked about the Kings' chances. Encouraged 
by the club's mixture of youth and experience, he wouldn't be moved from his 
41-win goal. 
</P>
<P>
"It's inevitable that we'll lose games," he said. "But the other teams will 
know they've been in a battle when they walk off the floor. And if we can get 
the seventh or eighth playoff spot, who knows? Anything can happen."

Craig Erickson passed for four touchdowns and Miami's defense had 10 sacks to 
lead the No. 8 Hurricanes to a 45-10 victory over Texas Tech on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Hurricanes (5-2) bounced back from a loss to Notre Dame, moving the ball

Miami's swarming defense, ranked eighth in the country against the rush, 
allowed Tech only 93 yards, holding the Red Raiders to 41 yards on 44 plays 
through three quarters. Tech finished with minus-10 rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end Rusty Medearis, who started in place of injured Eric Miller, had 
five sacks. Tackle Shane Curry and linebacker Darrin Smith each had two. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson completed 22 of 32 passes for 307 yards and led Miami on touchdown 
drives of 69, 52, 31, 53, 88 and 29 yards. He threw touchdown passes of 11, 38

it cost the 24th-ranked Horned Frogs the Southwest Conference lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed a miracle, but we just couldn't pull one off this time," Coach Jim 
Wacker said after the Frogs were upset by Baylor, 27-21, Saturday at Ft. 
</P>
<P>
Worth, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Baylor used a first-quarter, 78-yard touchdown pass play from J.J. Joe to 
Melvin Bonner and two fourth-quarter interceptions to beat TCU, which slipped 
into the Top 25 last week after five consecutive victories, three of them of 
the come-from-behind variety. 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped the Horned Frogs to 5-2 overall and 3-1 in the SWC. The Bears 
are 4-3-1 and 3-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Horned Frogs, trailing by 11 points in the final quarter, pulled within 
three with 8:13 left, but their comeback was cut short by a pair of 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
No. 13 Texas 52, SMU 3 -- The Longhorns (5-1, 3-0) thoroughly dominated 
Southern Methodist (1-6, 0-4) at Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
The defense put pressure on SMU's run-and-shoot offense, hard-running freshman 
Butch Hadnot scored two touchdowns and Alex Waits had three punts that pinned 
the Mustangs at their own six, three and seven in the first half.

MISSISSIPPI WINS WITH BACKUP QUARTERBACK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mississippi's offense sputtered at times behind backup quarterback Russ Shows, 
but the 17th-ranked Rebels had just enough to get the job done against 
Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
With starter Tom Luke out with an injured left knee, Shows guided the Rebels to 
two first-half touchdowns that the defense made stand up for a 14-13 
Southeastern Conference victory Saturday at Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Shows completed eight of 20 passes for 155 yards and one touchdown and ran for 
54 yards. Ole Miss halted three second-half Vanderbilt threats, limiting the 
Commodores to a pair of field goals in the final 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Baldwin gained 121 yards in 18 carries and Ed Thigpen had 96 yards and a 
touchdown in 16 carries for Ole Miss, 7-1 overall and 3-1 in the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderbilt (1-6, 1-4) has lost 21 of its last 23 games. 
</P>
<P>
"This was just a remarkable football game," said Mississippi Coach Billy 
Brewer, whose Rebels are nationally ranked for the time time since 1986. "We 
were able to do the things in the end it took to win. 
</P>
<P>
"Offensively, we just didn't have the rhythm we had in the last several games. 
I don't know whether that's because Tommy didn't play or what. We just weren't 
very consistent. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to get your opponent's best shot when you are a ranked team. This 
was a golden opportunity for Vanderbilt." 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels had 291 yards in 56 rushes and 446 yards overall to Vanderbilt's 
314. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi led at halftime, 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky 26, Georgia 23 -- Doug Pelfrey kicked a 32-yard field goal with seven 
seconds left in the game to give the Wildcats an SEC victory over the Bulldogs 
at Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia (4-4, 2-3) went ahead, 24-23, when Chuck Carswell took Bill Hawk's punt 
at the 31, broke right and raced 69 yards untouched down the sidelines with 
6:19 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky (3-5, 2-2) began its winning, 80-yard drive when Freddie Maggard, 
replacing the injured Brad Smith at quarterback in the fourth quarter, passed 
to Phil Logan for a 22-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
Maggard later connected on an eight-yard pass to Logan to the Georgia 45, a 
17-yarder to Terry Samuels to the 30 and a 10-yarder to Rodney Jackson to the 
23 with 40 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky then ran off four plays to the 14 before Pelfrey came on for his 
winning kick.

GAME-ENDING BRAWL SPOILS BOWDEN'S 200TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Associated Press

<DATELINE>

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What happened after the game seemed to bother the coaches more than what 
transpired during No. 12 Florida State's 42-3 thumping of Louisiana State on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State's Bobby Bowden had the joy of his 200th coaching victory tempered 
by a game-ending brawl. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame what happened at the end," Bowden said. "It shouldn't have 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
Bowden and LSU Coach Mike Archer were unsure what happened after Florida State 
linebacker Kirk Carruthers was whistled for a late hit on the game's final 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"I just ran out there to try and break it up," Archer said. "It was a good hard 
football game until that point." 
</P>
<P>
The brawl required coaches and stadium authorities to separate the players and 
Archer declined the roughness penalty to avoid another confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State linebacker Marvin Jones required stitches near his right eye from 
an injury suffered in the melee. 
</P>
<P>
"They finally got an opportunity to take something out and they went for it," 
said Carruthers, who, despite drawing the penalty, blamed the fight on LSU 
players. 
</P>
<P>
LSU (4-3) had five turnovers, three leading to Florida State touchdowns in the 
first half as the Seminoles rolled up a 28-3 cushion. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything that could have gone wrong, did," Archer said. "You saw all that 
today." 
</P>
<P>
Bowden said, "The defense played doggone well. They set up our offense time and 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Carl Simpson recovered two fumbles by LSU quarterback Chad Loup that set up a 
pair of touchdowns and Terrell Buckley's recovery of a fumble on the game's 
first play jump-started the runaway for Florida State (5-2). 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like we had to get ahead and then we fumble the kickoff," Archer said. 
</P>
<P>
Bowden, 61 next month, is the 11th major-college coach to win 200 games. Penn 
State's Joe Paterno, with 224, is the only active Division I coach with more 
victories.

BIG TEN ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
ILLINI OFFENSE STALLS, BUT DEFENSE STIFFENS TO KEY 21-3 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifth-ranked Illinois remained unbeaten in Big Ten play, defeating Wisconsin, 
21-3, Saturday at Madison, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois Coach John Mackovic credited his team's defense, which had to play 
well because the offense was not productive. 
</P>
<P>
"Offensively we had way too many turnovers, but fortunately our defense did 
what was needed," said Mackovic, whose team is 6-1 overall and 4-0 in the Big 
Ten. "They kept the pressure on Wisconsin's quarterbacks, which reduced their 
effectiveness." 
</P>
<P>
Illinois fumbled five times and lost three, but the Illini defense also 
recovered four fumbles, held the Badgers (1-6, 0-4) to 15 yards rushing, and 
kept the pressure on Wisconsin quarterbacks Tony Lowery and Sean Wilson, who 
were sacked five times. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery left the game in the third quarter with a bruised back. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jason Verduzco passed for two touchdowns and Wagner Lester ran for 
a third to lead the Illini offense. 
</P>
<P>
Lester, who played high school football in Racine, Wis., said the Fighting 
Illini were not looking ahead to next Saturday's showdown against Iowa, which 
holds a share of the Big Ten lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say we took Wisconsin lightly," Lester said. "We just didn't 
prepare for the physical game it turned out to be. They played real tough and 
came out and got right after us." 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin Coach Barry Alvarez said Illinois' defense was as tough as any the 
Badgers have faced this season. "They are confident and physical and that's how 
you win football games -- playing like that," Alvarez said. 
</P>
<P>
Verduzco threw a six-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Shawn Wax to open the 
scoring on the first play of the second quarter. The Illini got the ball back 
three plays later when Lowery fumbled on the Badger 23 and Erik Foggey 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Four plays later, Lester ran in from six yards out to give the Illini a 
two-touchdown advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin scored 26 seconds before the end of the first half on a 43-yard field 
goal by Rich Thompson. The field goal was set up by Scott Nelson's interception 
and return to the Illini 33. 
</P>
<P>
With a stiff wind and chilly temperatures affecting both teams, Illinois 
fumbled three times in the third quarter and the Badgers twice. Thompson also 
missed a 52-yard attempt in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois got its final touchdown on Verduzco's seven-yard touchdown pass to 
Elbert Turner with 4:53 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois is now 9-1-1 in its last 11 meetings with Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
No. 15 Iowa 56, Northwestern 14 -- Hawkeye tailbacks Nick Bell and Tony Stewart 
played only half the game at Iowa City, but Wildcat Coach Francis Peay saw 
about as much as he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"What did I think about the pair of Tony Stewart and Nick Bell? Thank God we 
play Iowa only once a year," Peay said. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Rodgers threw for two first-half touchdowns and Bell scored three times 
before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa (6-1, 4-0) plays at Illinois next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Northwestern (2-5, 1-3) dropped its 17th consecutive game to the Hawkeyes. The 
Wildcats haven't won at Iowa City since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawkeyes put the game away early by scoring touchdowns on five of their 
first six possessions, including 29 points in the second quarter. Coming into 
the game, Iowa had outscored its opponents 79-37 in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Our backs, I thought, both Stewart and Bell ran extremely hard, breaking 
tackles, twisting and turning," Iowa Coach Hayden Fry said. "They've done that 
in several ball games. I try to rotate them to keep them fresh." 
</P>
<P>
Bell gained 136 yards in 16 first-half carries, and scored the game's first 
touchdown on a six-yard run. He also scored on runs of 16 and 26 yards in the 
second quarter to help Iowa build a 35-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who rotates with Bell at tailback, carried 15 times for 122 yards 
before coming out early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
No. 20 Michigan 45, Indiana 19 -- Wolverine quarterback Elvis Grbac completed 
14 of 18 passes for 166 yards and three touchdowns as the Big Ten's top offense 
manhandled the conference's leading defense at Bloomington, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan safety Tripp Welborne set up scores with a 60-yard punt return and a 
pass interception. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Vaughn, the nation's rushing leader, gained 91 yards -- including a 47-yard 
touchdown run -- despite sitting out much of the game with a sore ankle. 
Vaughn's season rushing total is 1,011 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines improved to 4-3 overall and 2-2 in the Big Ten. The Hoosiers are 
4-2-1 and 1-2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana got a touchdown late in the second quarter on an eight-yard pass from 
Chris Dyer to Rob Turner, who sprained his right ankle on the play, and on runs 
of one yard by Cal Miller and 16 yards by Vaughn Dunbar in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State 55, Purdue 33 -- Tailback Tico Duckett rushed for 210 yards in 
34 carries and scored four touchdowns as the Spartans (3-3-1, 2-2) dominated 
the injury-riddled Boilermakers (1-6, 0-4) at East Lansing, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State had 34 first downs and 423 yards rushing, while Purdue was held 
to six first downs and six yards rushing. But Purdue did manage 253 yards 
passing, most of it coming late. 
</P>
<P>
Duckett scored on runs of two, 14, 15 and three yards. Hyland Hickson had 103 
yards in 16 carries, including touchdown runs of one and six yards. Sebeatian 
Small scored on a one-yard run and John Langeloh kicked field goals of 24 and 
33 yards for Michigan State.

BEARS, RAIDERS AND DOLPHINS ARE STAGING REVIVALS IN NFL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LITKE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Think this business of giving each team a week off has more than the NFL 
schedule-makers confused? That the local paper or TV station is showing the 
standings from 1985, or more confusing still, upside down? 
</P>
<P>
Well, BOOM! POW! CRASH! as coach-turned commentator John Madden is guaranteed 
to scream at least once during an NFL telecast this coming weekend. Look again, 
but don't touch that dial! There is nothing wrong with your eyes or your 
reception. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears, Raiders and Dolphins really are back with a bullet. And the reason 
they are ruling their respective roosts -- Chicago (5-1) in the NFC Central, 
Los Angeles (6-1) in the AFC West and Miami (tied with Buffalo at 5-1) in the 
AFC East -- is not because nostalgic gremlins are stalking the print shops and 
the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
Simply put, they are playing "smashmouth football" -- as in smash your 
opponents with a punishing running game, then smash them some more with a 
punishing defense. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, the slice-and-dice San Francisco 49ers are still the class of the 
league, still killing everybody softly with dink passes and a defense that 
relies as much on guile as guts. But as the continued success of the New York 
Giants and the resurgence of these three dominant teams of yesteryear is 
proving, hurting people is only going to help your standing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good feeling after last year," grizzled Bears defensive tackle Dan 
Hampton said, "especially the way the ground gave out under us." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, last year. When we left off then, the Bears were 6-10, tired and nearly 
toothless themselves, grateful for a chance to go into hibernation early. The 
Raiders were 8-8, having lost their last two games and a shot at the playoffs 
in the bargain, and seemed more concerned with relocating the team than 
fielding one worthy of moving. And the Dolphins? They, too, were pinned down at 
8-8 and tarnishing the bust of coach Don Shula being kept in a closet for 
shipment to the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the ground seems to be giving out under their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
All three teams are distinguished this time around not only for what they are 
doing right, but for what they are not doing at all -- which is leaving their 
defenses on the playing field past the point of diminishing returns. 
</P>
<P>
Heading into the weekend's action, the Giants -- no surprise there -- were 
ranked first overall in total defense. But the Dolphins were a a surprising No. 
2, surrendering an average of just 13.8 points per game; followed by the Bears 
and their league-low 12.5 yield; and another place farther back were the 
Raiders at 14.1. 
</P>
<P>
"Our biggest improvement in defense is offense," Miami defensive end Jeff Cross 
said matter-of-factly. "It's all about fatigue." 
</P>
<P>
Modesty may cause Cross to figure his own improvement into the equation -- the 
ninth-round pick out of Missouri two years ago shares the NFL sack lead at 
eight with San Francisco's Charles Haley -- but the point about the offense is 
well made. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, I've already had one game in which I was on the field for a total 
of 22 plays," said inside linebacker John Offerdahl, Cross' teammate and the 
Dolphins' leading tackler. 
</P>
<P>
"I walked off the field after the game," he added, "and it felt like a 
practice." 
</P>
<P>
The reason for that is smashmouth category No. 2. The Bears, led by Neal 
Anderson, lead the NFL in rushing. Though Anderson ranks second in the NFC in 
yards gained on the ground, if you put aside the kickers, he is tops in the 
conference in scoring. 
</P>
<P>
In the team rushing ranks, neither the Raiders nor Dolphins look very 
impressive, settling in at 16 and 17th, respectively. But the resillient Marcus 
Allen ranked sixth among all AFC running backs in rushing and seventh in 
scoring, with 340 yards and four touchdowns, and the surprising Sammie Smith 
was 10th in rushing and third in scoring, with 318 yards and six touchdowns in 
86 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Smith's proficiency and the addition of two big rookie offensive 
linemen, No. 1 pick Richmond Webb and No. 2 Keith Sims, finally convinced Shula 
to restore the kind of balance between running and passing to his offense 
unseen since the successful Dolphin teams of the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"We had turned into a very one-dimensional offense and it wasn't working," he 
said. "We'd been talking for years about doing something about it, but it 
wasn't really until the last couple of years that we did something about it. 
</P>
<P>
"Now," he added, "we're starting to see some of the results." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders never were genuinely in balance that way, owing to owner Al Davis' 
constant tinkering and the love of the home-run ball. But by dumping coach Mike 
Shanahan for Art Shell last season, Davis did get the team back into its own 
quirky version of equilibrium. 
</P>
<P>
Shell is a former Raider lineman and like Davis, a bottom-line guy. The first 
thing he did was to do away with Shanahan's rule barring players from sitting 
on their helmets; the result is that the Raiders are forcing other teams to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, the San Diego Chargers drove inside the Raider 20-yard line on 
five occasions, but came away with only nine points. And when someone asked him 
whether it wasn't dangerous to allow opponents to penetrate so deep so often, 
Shell hardly blinked. 
</P>
<P>
"It's dangerous if they get in the end zone. If they don't get in the end zone, 
it's not dangerous. ... I don't care about statistics. I," said Shell, sounding 
remarkably like Davis, "just want to win."

PENN STATE ENDS ALABAMA SERIES WITH 9-0 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alabama has struggled this season, but Saturday against Penn State the Crimson 
Tide might have hit rock bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Fayak kicked three field goals for Penn State as the Nittany Lions beat 
Alabama, 9-0, at Tuscaloosa, Ala. -- the Crimson Tide's first shutout defeat at 
home in 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State (5-2) held the Crimson Tide (3-4) to 141 yards, including only six 
on the ground, as the teams ended a 10-game series in which Alabama won six. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State was the first team to shut out Alabama at Bryant-Denny Stadium since 
1955, when TCU won, 21-0. The six yards rushing is an all-time low for the 
Tide. The previous low was 11 yards in a 27-7 loss to Tulane in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama, which has gone 11 quarters without scoring a touchdown, lost its only 
scoring opportunity when Philip Doyle missed a 43-yard field-goal attempt in 
the first quarter after Fayak had given Penn State a 3-0 lead with a 34-yard 
field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse 26, Army 14 -- David Walker scored on a three-yard run and Mark 
McDonald connected with Rob Carpenter on a 43-yard touchdown pass play as the 
Orangemen (4-2-2) came from behind to beat the Cadets (3-4) at West Point, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, who completed 17 of 22 passes for 229 yards, drove the Orangemen 80 
yards to set up Walker's touchdown run with 7:47 left, giving Syracuse a 14-13 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Mayweather, Army's all-time leading rusher, carried 32 times for 131 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Boston College 27, West Virginia 14 -- Kevin Pearson returned an interception 
31 yards for a touchdown and the Eagles (4-3) converted three other Mountaineer 
turnovers into scores in a nonconference game at Morgantown, W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the game, West Virginia (3-4) had forced 18 turnovers and surrendered 
the ball four times -- the best turnover ratio in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Rutgers 20, Akron 17 -- Shaun Smith intercepted a pass in the end zone with 36 
seconds left to preserve the victory for the Scarlet Knights (3-5) at 
Piscataway, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Akron (3-5-1) had driven from its own 29 to the Rutgers' nine, but quarterback 
Wayne Wade's pass intended for Marcus Reliford was picked off by Smith. 
</P>
<P>
James Madison 16, Navy 7 -- The Dukes (5-3) sacked Navy quarterback Alton 
Grizzard seven times to take command of the Midshipmen (3-4) at Annapolis, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Senior fullback Willie Lanier gained only nine yards, but scored on two 
two-yard touchdown runs for the Dukes. 
</P>
<P>
Temple 30, East Carolina 27 -- Bob Wright kicked a 24-yard field goal with 1:16 
left to help the Owls (4-3) overcome two touchdown runs by Dion Johnson and 
defeat the Pirates (3-6) at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson returned a punt 53 yards for a touchdown and had a 90-yard kickoff 
return for a touchdown -- both in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Dartmouth 17, Harvard 0 -- Shon Page rushed for a school-record 222 yards and 
scored two touchdowns to lead the Big Green to an Ivy League victory over the 
Crimson at Hanover, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
Page, who scored on a 49-yard run in the first quarter and a 29-yard run midway 
through the second quarter, broke David Clark's school record of 219 yards set 
against Penn last year. 
</P>
<P>
Dartmouth, 4-2-1 overall and 3-1 in the Ivy League, shut out Harvard (4-3, 2-2)

Raghib (Rocket) Ismail was contained for three quarters Saturday, but only 
minutes later he had both Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz and Pittsburgh Coach Paul 
Hackett talking in Heisman terms. 
</P>
<P>
Ismail rushed for a personal-best 116 yards and a touchdown as the No. 3 
Fighting Irish withstood a fourth-quarter rally to beat Pittsburgh, 31-22, 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Ismail, held to seven yards rushing in five carries through three quarters, ran 
for 109 fourth-quarter yards and a game-breaking 76-yard touchdown. His long 
run, after two touchdown runs by Tony Brooks following Pitt turnovers, made it 
24-7. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy is magical," Hackett said. "We did a great job of containing him -- at 
least until the end. There's no question he's the best player in the country . 
. . and they're the best team in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Said Holtz: "He is the best player in the country. No question." Ismail's 
previous rushing high was 108 yards against Colorado in the Orange Bowl last 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Ismail had 214 all-purpose yards, giving him 482 in his last two games, as the 
Irish beat Pitt for the third consecutive year. Ismail, Brooks (who ran 18 
times for 88 yards) and Rodney Culver, who ran for 71 yards in 13 carries, 
helped Notre Dame outrush Pitt, 296 yards to 84. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were playing all right, at least until they gave the ball to the 
Rocket man," Hackett said. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Van Pelt completed 37 of 51 passes, including 14 in a row in the fourth 
quarter, for 384 yards and two last-quarter touchdowns but was unable to rally 
Pitt from the 24-7 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Irish (6-1) shut down Pitt (3-4-1) on three important fourth-down 
plays to withstand an off night by quarterback Rick Mirer. 
</P>
<P>
Mirer, who didn't complete a pass until early in the second quarter, completed 
one of 49 yards to Ismail to set up Craig Hentrich's 39-yard field goal and a 
17-7 lead in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish defense took it from there. Linebacker Donn Grimm intercepted Van 
Pelt's third-down pass at the Irish 31 late in the third period. Later, Bob 
Dahl sacked Van Pelt on third and five at the Irish 25, and Van Pelt's 
fourth-down pass to Eric Seaman fell short of the first down. 
</P>
<P>
Ismail then broke off-tackle for the 76-yard scoring run -- the longest of his 
career -- to make it 24-7.

HOT ROD'S LUCK TAKES TURN FOR THE BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HUBBARD, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those close to John "Hot Rod" Williams were amused and thrilled by the events 
of the summer, which for Williams, was filled with rich irony and superstar 
wealth. The four-year veteran Cleveland Cavaliers forward received a 
seven-year, $26.5 million contract. He will be the highest-paid player in the 
National Basketball Association this season, earning $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Williams has never made the All-Star team. But he has paid his dues, a fact 
that makes recent characterizations of Williams seem almost humorous. 
</P>
<P>
A little more than four years ago, it was not that way. Williams was an 
unfortunate man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. His destiny was 
controlled by a six-member New Orleans jury that was to decide whether he was 
guilty of shaving points while playing basketball for Tulane. He was faced with 
maximums of 17 years in prison and $35,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
And the NBA, in essence, had told Williams he was guilty until proven innocent. 
Although Williams had not been convicted of a crime, the NBA refused to approve 
his initial contract with the Cavs until all charges were dismissed. He was 
forced to sit out the 1985-86 season, which would have been his rookie year. 
</P>
<P>
"He went through some tough junk," said Cavs center Brad Daugherty, one of 
Williams' best friends. "It was kind of ironic what happened to him this 
summer. But I knew his time would come." 
</P>
<P>
That is easy to say now. "They didn't say I was a lucky guy when I was sitting 
out that year," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, however, those close to Williams say he deserved what he got -- 
innocence, then security for life. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time when most people thought he wouldn't be in the NBA," said 
Mark Bartlestein, Williams' agent. "Throughout it all, he never complained and 
never bitched. It's so refreshing to see Hot Rod the beneficiary of a contract 
like this. If you want to talk about a true rags-to-riches story, about a life 
that has gone full circle, this is it." 
</P>
<P>
Hot Rod Williams was abandoned as a child. His real mother died before his 
first birthday. His father one day left him with a grandfather, who was blind, 
and never returned. "I saw my dad once for about five minutes when I was 12," 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
He was adopted by Barbara Colar, a single parent who raised four children in 
the tiny town of Sorrento, La., by working two jobs. It was Colar who gave him 
the name Hot Rod, because she said he hollered like a hot rod car. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said he learned early to make the best of what he had. "I understood 
there were a lot of things I couldn't get because my momma just couldn't afford 
it," he said. "There would be Christmas, and I would tell her, 'Don't worry 
about me. Just take care of my little sister and my little brother. Some kind 
of way, I'm going to try and find a way to make it.' 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted things like other kids had -- 10-speed bikes and stuff like that. So 
I would go to the dump and get a couple of old (bicycle) frames and make me up 
a bike. Me and my brother would put it together." 
</P>
<P>
That ability to focus on solutions would serve him well later. Williams was 
arrested in March 1985 and charged with participating in a scheme to fix Tulane 
games with Memphis State and Southern Mississippi. His first trial was declared 
a mistrial because the judge said prosecutors withheld evidence that could have 
cleared him. 
</P>
<P>
The second trial ended June 16, 1986, with jurors declaring Williams not 
guilty. Part of Williams' successful defense was to impeach testimony of 
accusers who had been granted immunity in exchange for their testimony. One of 
the accusers faced 277 years in prison and $145,000 in fines before receiving 
immunity. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave them all immunity," Williams said. "One guy said the D.A. would let 
him go free if he lied. So he lied. ... What would you do?" 
</P>
<P>
Despite the seriousness of the charges, Williams said he never worried about 
the unpredictability of a jury or feared a conviction. "I knew I didn't do 
anything wrong," Williams said. "And I knew with the lawyer I had, there was no 
way I was going to lose." 
</P>
<P>
Williams had the same no-lose feeling last season when he rejected the Cavs' 
five-year, $13.5 million offer and chose to become a free agent. It would have 
been easy to accept a contract that would pay an average of $2.7 million a 
year. But because of the NBA's new television contract, Williams was convinced 
he could get more. 
</P>
<P>
So he went forward, never looked back, and Aug. 22 -- exactly five years to the 
day after his first trial ended in a mistrial -- he signed an offer sheet with 
the Miami Heat, which later was matched by the Cavs. 
</P>
<P>
"When we decided to play out the year and go from there," Bartlestein said, "it 
bothered me because I worried about him getting hurt. But it never bothered 
him. John is a unique kid. He's got a tremendous ability to focus on one thing 
and forget about everything else." 
</P>
<P>
And as a result of his determination and patience, Williams is in control of 
his destiny -- unlike four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
All offer sheets have a clause that prevents a player from being traded for one 
year without his approval. When the Cavs attempted to trade him to the Seattle 
SuperSonics last month, Williams rejected the deal despite a contract clause 
that would have allowed him to collect an additional $3.5 million if he 
approved the trade. He said he did not want to uproot his wife and three 
children, and no one doubted his sincerity. Because he rejected the trade, 
Williams will never be paid that additional $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely a great feeling of knowing I'm in control," Williams said. 
"That's very seldom that it happens." 
</P>
<P>
Although he is being paid like a superstar, he is not one. Last season, he had 
career-high averages of 16.8 points and 8.1 rebounds. In his four years he has 
averaged 13.5 points and 7.1 rebounds. There has been a lot of criticism of 
Williams because he is being overpaid in an inflated market. 
</P>
<P>
But he had nothing to do with the market situation. He was merely in the right 
place in the right time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not happy with the burden it's placed on managing the team," said Cavs 
General Manager Wayne Embry. "But I said this to John: 'I'm really pleased at 
the way you have been rewarded, coming from your background and going through 
the things you went through.' There is absolutely no one that can have any 
regrets about the situation or any vindictiveness toward John Williams."

CAL'S RUSSELL WHITE IS A LITTLE BRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM VAN VLIET, MCCLATCHY NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It had been a full 10 minutes since they opened the interview room near 
California's Memorial Stadium, and everybody wondered where the heck Russell 
White was. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he showed up. 
</P>
<P>
He dropped himself in a chair, looked at his watch and notified the assembled 
media: "You've got two minutes and the clock's running." 
</P>
<P>
If you had your back turned, it could have been a surly Will Clark after an 
0-for-5 night. Except the voice was deeper. 
</P>
<P>
No, it was Russell White, all of seven games into his collegiate career at Cal. 
With his running mate, senior Anthony Wallace, he had just helped the Bears end 
an 18-game losing streak to UCLA that dated back to when sideburns ended at the 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
If you wanted to talk about it, you'd better talk fast. 
</P>
<P>
Call him cocky. Call him brash. But call him good. The nephew of USC Heisman 
Trophy winner Charles White is carrying on the family tradition: The legs do 
most of the talking. 
</P>
<P>
But the Bay Area is seeing a little different Russell White this week as Cal 
prepares for its biggest game since 1975. That year the Bears lost to UCLA, 
which caused them to settle for a tie for the Pacific 10 Conference title and 
ultimately cost them a trip to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday the Bears are in Seattle to play Washington with first place in the 
Pac-10 on the line again. And, suddenly, White is not so sure what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
White is half of what the Cal publicity department has dubbed the "W-W Attack." 
White and Wallace have combined for 1,331 rushing yards and 14 touchdowns as 
California (5-2) has gotten off to its best start in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears rushed for 331 yards against UCLA and scored more than 30 points for 
the fifth consecutive week. The Bears are averaging 212.6 yards per game 
rushing, 20th-best in the country. 
</P>
<P>
But White also knows that the first seven games were only a warm-up for 
Saturday, when the Bears meet the No. 1 rushing defense in the country. The 
Huskies are allowing only 51.9 yards a game on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Oddsmakers aren't convinced the Bears will get the job done, installing 
Washington as a 17-point favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like we're basically a nobody," White said. "Playing against the No. 
1 defense in the country is going to give us incentive to see what we can do. 
Now if we can rack up 300 yards against them, obviously somebody was wrong. If 
we don't, it must be true." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the Bears' success can be traced to the fact that they have kept their 
offensive line healthy for a complete season. The starting front line has 
played together on 513 of the last 518 offensive snaps since the Miami game, 
when Todd Steussie replaced Chris Westerman at right guard. The line also leads 
the Pac-10 in pass protection, having given up just nine sacks. 
</P>
<P>
"All the credit should go to them," White said. "When they do their jobs, it 
makes it easier on us. I was shocked we had so many yards (against UCLA)." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there's a sense of the unknown in his voice this week. The task ahead 
isn't an easy one. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears are faced with dealing with the likes of active inside linebackers 
Dave Hoffman and Chico Fraley, who have combined for 95 tackles, and linemen 
Steve Emtman and James Richardson, who have combined for 12 1/2 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
"How good is the offensive line?" White said. "So far, great. The real test 
comes this week. We can make it a long day or a very short one. We'll see. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to sit here and tell everybody what we're going to do. But I'm 
feeling confident." 
</P>
<P>
And there is some basis for White's quiet confidence. When the Bears met 
Arizona last month, the Wildcats were No. 5 in the nation against the run, 
giving up 72.2 yards per game. The Bears ran for 177 in a 30-25 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The next week Cal faced San Jose State, which entered the game No. 3 in the 
land, allowing 67.2 yards a game on the ground. The Bears ran for 325 yards in 
a 35-34 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a good system going right now," White said. "The coaches have a 
rotation for Anthony and me. When one gets tired, the other goes in. And 
there's no drop-off either way." 
</P>
<P>
At Washington, coach Don James isn't ignorant of Cal's four-game winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be the best Cal team we will have faced," he said. "I look at the 
backs we've had to face this year, and it seems everyone has a great one or 
two. Now I see Wallace and White, and I wonder how much better they are going 
to get. 
</P>
<P>
"It's incredible the skill level and ability they have in the open field." 
</P>
<P>
White nearly came to Washington after graduating from Crespi High School in the 
San Fernando Valley in 1989. He rushed for 5,998 yards and 94 touchdowns in his 
three-year prep career. He was heavily recruited nationally before whittling 
his final choices to Cal and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real dogfight at the end," White said. "I was going back and forth. I 
couldn't figure it out for myself. The man upstairs helped me out a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"It came down to the academic side. I liked the semester system (at Cal) better 
than the quarter system (at Washington). That was the final decision." 
</P>
<P>
White sat out his freshman season as a Proposition 48 student. His '89 season 
was composed of pickup games of touch football in the park. 
</P>
<P>
It has been only two years since White snubbed the Huskies, and he's prepared 
for some resentment. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some nice people up there," White said. "But they'll have an 
incentive to hit me. So it better be a two-way street." 
</P>
<P>
How does that old football maxim go, the one about immovable objects? The Bears 
had better do some moving Saturday. The Rose Bowl depends on it.

NHL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
HULL GETS 14TH GOAL AND BLUES WIN, 3-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until he scored 72 goals last season, Brett Hull was best known merely as the 
son of former NHL star Bobby Hull. 
</P>
<P>
The day may come when Bobby Hull will be better known as the father of Brett 
Hull. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Hull scored his 14th goal, his seventh in the past three games, Saturday 
at St. Louis to lead the Blues to a 3-0 victory over the Montreal Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent Riendeau stopped 27 shots for his second career shutout in the first 
Blue victory at home against the Canadiens in almost three years. The Blues 
moved into a tie with the Detroit Red Wings for first place in the Norris 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
Many believe that Wayne Gretzky's record of 92 goals during the 1981-82 season 
will never be broken. But with 14 goals in 11 games, Hull is on a pace that 
would break it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even think about that record," Hull said. "All I'm doing is trying to 
help us win a Stanley Cup. That would be something special." 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Glen Featherstone scored the last goal for St. Louis. It was his 
first in 87 NHL games. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 5, Chicago 4 -- Jacques Cloutier and the Blackhawks were rolling after 
two periods at Boston. Cloutier had faced only nine shots and Chicago led, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks made the score 3-0 when Michel Goulet scored two minutes into 
the final period. But with Randy Burridge and Cam Neely leading the way, the 
Bruins scored five times to pull out the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Burridge scored twice, including the inner with 1:49 left. Neely had a goal and 
an assist. 
</P>
<P>
With two seconds to play, Dirk Graham scored an apparent tying goal, but 
referee Andy Van Hellemond ruled the net was dislodged before the puck went 
into the net. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary 9, Washington 4 -- Joe Nieuwendyk was due to break loose and the 
Capitals were the victims at Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
Nieuwendyk, scoreless in the previous seven games, had two goals and three 
assists as the Flames swept into first place, ahead of the Kings, in the Smythe 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Tippett scored twice for the Capitals, who are 0-3-2 in their past five 
games at Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
New York Rangers 4, Quebec 1 -- Defenseman James Patrick broke a tie with a 
power-play goal 15 seconds into the third period at Quebec and the Rangers went 
on to their ninth victory in the past 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Nordiques, who lost their third in a row, took a 1-0 lead on Joe Sakic's 
eighth goal early in the second period. Shortly thereafter, the Rangers (9-3-0) 
started putting the pressure on and the Nordiques wilted. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 7, Pittsburgh 5 -- Laurie Boschman and John MacLean scored 31 
seconds apart in the third period and the Devils extended their home ice record 
to 7-0-1. 
</P>
<P>
With the score 4-4 after two periods, the Penguins replaced goalie Tom Barrasso 
with Wendell Young. 
</P>
<P>
Young couldn't handle Boschman's long shot at 3:06, the puck hitting his skate 
and bouncing into the net. Young then let MacLean's shot slide across the 
crease into the far corner. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver 4, Hartford 2 -- The Whalers are learning the hard way that it isn't 
the number of shots, it's the quality that wins hockey games. 
</P>
<P>
In this game at Hartford, Conn., the Whalers outshot their opponent for the 
third game in a row -- and lost. 
</P>
<P>
Trevor Linden scored twice and rookie Troy Gamble blocked 40 shots to lead the 
Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
New York Islanders 5, Philadelphia 2 -- Pat LaFontaine, recently back from an 
injury, had a hat trick at Uniondale, N.Y., and the Islanders ended a four-game 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers lost more than their third in a row. Goalie Ron Hextall, sidelined 
because of a groin injury for two weeks, had to leave before the middle of the 
second period after suffering a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 3, Toronto 1 -- Firing Coach Doug Carpenter apparently wasn't the 
answer for the Maple Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
Pierre Turgeon and Dale Hawerchuk scored third-period goals at Toronto to lead 
the Sabres. The Maple Leafs are 1-10-1. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 2, Minnesota 2 -- Jimmy Carson scored his seventh goal with 7:10 left 
in regulation at Bloomington, Minn., to get the Red Wings a tie. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Wings trailed, 2-0, and had only 10 shots on goal in the first 40 
minutes. DAN HAFNER

WITH BIG-NAME RIDERS GONE, FLORES ENJOYS A SUCCESSFUL DAY

With the more prominent members of the Santa Anita jockey colony occupied at 
Belmont Park in New York, David Flores was the primary beneficiary Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old rider won three races, including a 7-1 surprise aboard Yes I'm 
Blue in the $83,850 Morvich Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Also successful on Exbourne and Recitation Spin, the Tijuana-born Flores hasn't 
exactly been struggling at Oak Tree even when Gary Stevens, Laffit Pincay, 
Eddie Delahoussaye, Chris McCarron, Pat Valenzuela, Kent Desormeaux and Alex 
Solis are around. His three winners Saturday gave him 17 for the meeting, 
moving him into a second-place tie with Stevens in the standings. They are 
three behind Delahoussaye going into the final seven days. Previously, Flores 
was the leading rider at Los Alamitos and Fairplex. 
</P>
<P>
The Morvich also provided Flores and trainer Vladimir Cerin with their first 
stakes victory at Santa Anita, and it came in Yes I'm Blue's first try on the 
turf. 
</P>
<P>
A gray son of Marfa who had been selected Fairplex Park's horse of the meeting 
after winning the Aprisa and Governor's Cup, Yes I'm Blue sat well off the fast 
pace early, rallied wide into the stretch and was up to beat 16-1 longshot 
Waterscape in the final yards. 
</P>
<P>
A winner of seven of 18 lifetime starts, the 4-year-old went 6 1/2 furlongs in 
1:12 2/5, a fifth of a second off Basic Rate's stakes record and three-fifths 
slower than Baffle's 20-year course mark. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to break slow with him because he runs from behind," Flores said. "On 
the turn, I had to take a hold of him with both hands. When he crossed the 
dirt, he started to run well. 
</P>
<P>
"He's never raced on turf, but I galloped him down the hill here a few days 
ago. He handles the turf and the dirt the same." 
</P>
<P>
Cerin, always high on the Kentucky-bred, decided after Yes I'm Blue's victory 
in the Governor's Cup he was going to try him in the Morvich. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he could last longer on a softer surface," he said. "The first time 
he ran at (Fairplex), it wasn't what I wanted. I didn't like seeing him going 
21 and change into the turn there, so I decided to rate him to save him more 
than as a winning strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"It turned out that's just what he wanted. The horse made the determination. I 
can't say it was a stroke of genius in the middle of the night." 
</P>
<P>
Waterscape, a former claimer, easily cleared speedsters Snipledo, Oraibi and 
Frost Free down the hillside through some torrid fractions (21 and 42 4/5), but 
couldn't quite last. 
</P>
<P>
"At the quarter pole, I thought he was going to win it," jockey Adalberto Lopez 
said of Waterscape. "He just got tired the last part." 
</P>
<P>
Oraibi, the 13-10 favorite, was a no-excuse third, a length behind Waterscape. 
Then came Frost Free, Sam Who, Snipledo, Robyn Dancer, Go On In and 
Doyouseewhatisee. 
</P>
<P>
Making his first start since May 6, 1989, Exbourne overcame some early problems 
to win his U.S. debut in the 10th race at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
A four-year-old son of Explodent, Exbourne had a victory and two seconds in 
three English starts last year, including a runner-up try behind Nashwan in the 
2000 Guineas. 
</P>
<P>
The 4-5 favorite off the strength of his form and some sharp local works, he 
was reluctant to go into the starting gate, broke a step slowly, was hard for 
Flores to handle going into the first turn and had some traffic trouble down 
the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
However, Flores was able to get him to the outside, and the Bobby 
Frankel-trained colt asserted his superiority in the final sixteenth, running 
past 28-1 shot Bet Mehmet to win by three-quarters of a length. Owned by 
Juddmonte Farms, Exbourne completed the mile in 1:34 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
Petite Ile, who beat males in the Sunset and Golden Gate handicaps earlier this 
year, heads the list of invitees to the $400,000 Yellow Ribbon Stakes, which 
will be run a week from today. 
</P>
<P>
Idle since July because of a shin problem, Petite Ile has been training well 
for her return for trainer Ed Gregson. The 4-year-old Ile de Bourbon miss is 
scheduled to work a mile this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Like all the other older fillies and mares in the race, Petite Ile was assigned 
123 pounds for the Yellow Ribbon, which goes at 1 1/4 miles on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen others were extended invitations, including Baldomero, a 
multiple-stakes winner for Bill Shoemaker; Little Brianne, the upset 
wire-to-wire winner of the recent Las Palmas Handicap; Reluctant Guest, who has 
had a huge year for Richard Mandella; Double Wedge and Europeans Kostroma, 
Colour Chart, Kostroma, Air de Rien and Ruby Tiger. Bequest, Coolawin, Foresta, 
Native Twine and Royal Touch were also invited, and provisional invitations 
were given, in order, to Sweet Roberta, Gaelic Bird and Freya Stark. 
</P>
<P>
Air de Rien, Colour Chart, Native Twine and Ruby Tiger are all 3-year-olds and 
were given 119 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Post time moves to 12:30 p.m today. . . The total handle on the 14 races 
Saturday -- seven at the Breeders' Cup and the seven run here locally -- was 
$12,066,809. This is the third-largest handle in Oak Tree history, but was down 
from last year, when $14.1 million was bet at Santa Anita on Breeders' Cup Day. 
. . For the second day in a row, day, nobody swept the Pick Six, so there is a 
carryover of more than $181,000 for today.

WHY A RISKY AND AMBITIOUS EXPLORATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MODERN ART

<P>
The sumptuous debacle that is "High &amp; Low: Modern Art and Popular Culture" 
should give the Museum of Modern Art serious pause. In fact, just half as much 
pause as it gives an astonished viewer would suffice. For although the 
much-touted exhibition ranks as the museum's resolute attempt to rejoin the 
lively conversation of contemporary cultural life -- a vigorous discussion from 
which the august institution has been largely absent for well over a decade -- 
the simple truth is this: "High &amp; Low" seems to be talking to no one but 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the museum has undergone a changing of the guard at the 
high-visibility helm of its department of painting and sculpture, and "High 
&amp; Low" is that new director's inaugural presentation. Astonishment that 
this is his idea of a show that would be of interest to anyone but an academic 
pedant, one who gets electric jolts of excitement from footnotes more eagerly 
than from works of art, is matched by the sinking feeling that the museum's 
entrenched position as defender of an aging and ever more narrow canon will 
continue into the foreseeable future. It's business as usual on 53rd Street. 
</P>
<P>
"High &amp; Low" is a flop, but a flop worth analyzing for a consequential 
reason. Its subject -- the relationship between the individual artistic 
imagination and the world of popular and commercial culture -- demands an 
expansive rethinking of 20th Century art. That rethinking has provided 
considerable juice for much of the most substantive American and European art 
since the 1960s. MOMA, though, has merely tinkered, and in ways that 
demonstrate just how disengaged this former flagship museum really is. 
</P>
<P>
Since its opening early in October, "High &amp; Low" has been almost 
universally decried, but not for having been unable to gather together an 
extraordinary group of paintings and sculptures. The sprawling display, which, 
after closing in Manhattan on Jan. 15, will travel to the Art Institute of 
Chicago in February and, in June, to L.A.'s Museum of Contemporary Art, is rich 
in works of individual excellence by whole rafts of 20th Century artists: 
Picasso, Duchamp, Rodchenko, Miro, Brancusi, Cornell, Rauschenberg, Twombly, 
Warhol, Lichtenstein and more. That's what makes the debacle sumptuous. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is the disaster due to gross indulgence in shoddy scholarship. To the 
contrary. Kirk Varnedoe, the new helmsman at MOMA, and Adam Gopnik, art critic 
for The New Yorker and co-organizer of "High &amp; Low," have been diligent in 
unearthing specific sources in popular culture on which artists have drawn. 
Many are illuminating. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, they've dug up copies of the newspapers that Picasso and Georges 
Braque clipped in making their revolutionary Cubist collages, and they've 
figured out punning references in those clippings. They've brought together 
Francis Picabia's drawings with exactly those commercial advertisements from 
which they derived, and they've assembled ads designed by Rodchenko for 
commercial products. Convincing connections between Philip Guston's figurative 
paintings and characters in comics by Al Capp and Robert Crumb have been 
pinpointed, and the comic books are shown in the galleries with the paintings. 
The curators even trace spiral paths of influence -- high into low into high 
into low, like a twisting snake devouring its tail -- that such imagery has 
sometimes followed. 
</P>
<P>
Varnedoe's and Gopnik's assertions are by no means uniformly convincing. When 
they claim that Picasso's great, 1906 portrait of a hulking Gertrude Stein, 
complete with its archaizing simplifications drawn from models in ancient 
Iberian sculpture, actually ranks as the first great example of the modern 
influence of caricature on high art, then the term "caricature" has been 
stripped of functional meaning. For Picasso's arresting portrait of his 
intimate friend can be (and has been) called many things, but satirical and 
ludicrous are not among them. 
</P>
<P>
No, the show bombs for more substantive, structural reasons than occasional 
flights of art historical fancy. "High &amp; Low" collapses beneath an 
insistence that the history of art is nothing more than the history of 
successive styles, and that modern art of the 20th Century is distinguished 
merely by being the history of highly personal, individual styles. 
</P>
<P>
"Modern art has liberated, as no art has before, the private imagination of the 
artist," announces an introductory wall-text. "Yet again and again, modern 
artists of all kinds have turned for inspiration to the public life around 
them, and have adopted motifs and styles from commerce, entertainment and the 
language of the streets." 
</P>
<P>
Here's one example of the problem. By the 1940s, abstract painting had come to 
symbolize the serious commitment of an American avant-garde. In 1966, the 
widely admired Abstract Expressionist painter Philip Guston began a startling 
repudiation of abstraction. The curators say, in the show's big, 460-page book, 
that his shocking reversal is important because, given the public success of 
Abstract Expressionism in general, "What Guston needed, like so many damaged 
and visionary old men, was above all a private style." 
</P>
<P>
To say Guston's attraction to mass-produced comics was a search for personal 
style is not just bizarre, it's delimiting. Guston's new figurative art became 
a touchstone for the epochal shifts of a younger generation for reasons of far 
greater moment. In repudiating abstraction, he, like they, had begun to 
question the assumptions on which modern art itself had come to depend. 
</P>
<P>
Would that the curators had followed suit. The exhibition casts the artifacts 
of popular culture as participating, to a degree, in this quest for personal 
style. The show is at pains to identify, by name, the designers of these 
usually anonymous forms. Yet, because the mass appeal of pop artifacts signals 
the absolute antithesis of individual style, their principal worth is seen to 
be as available fodder for artistic use. "High &amp; Low" doesn't really 
consider the difficult relationship between "Modern Art and Popular Culture." 
It's merely an annotated catalogue, plastered across the museum's walls, which 
chronicles "Some Modern Artists and One Among Their Many Sources." 
</P>
<P>
Twentieth Century artists climbed high, the show proposes, on the exponentially 
growing mountain of low-culture trash. In the eyes and minds of Varnedoe and 
Gopnik, popular culture could be colonized by great artists merely because, 
like Everest, it was there. We're invited to join them in enjoying the dizzying 
aesthetic view. 
</P>
<P>
If this thesis sounds crashingly familiar, it's because its broadest outlines 
once formed the creation myth of modern American art. 
</P>
<P>
In 1939, the 30-year-old critic Clement Greenberg published his first essay on 
art. "Avant-Garde and Kitsch" drew on the perceptive ideas of several earlier 
writers to establish strict boundaries between advanced modern art and the 
artifacts of popular culture -- between "high" and "low." And in 1961, at 
precisely the moment those boundaries were about to be fatefully breached -- 
most obviously by a host of young artists whose disparate work was to be 
gathered under an umbrella called Pop Art -- an anthology appeared of 
Greenberg's criticism from the past two decades. "Art and Culture," which led 
with his essay on the dangers of kitsch, stood on one side of a rift that soon 
grew into a yawning chasm. Scores of challenging young artists lined up on the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1940s and 1950s Greenberg had championed the work of the emerging 
Abstract Expressionist painters (most notably Jackson Pollock), in writings 
that elaborated the distinctions first drawn in "Avant-Garde and Kitsch." Art 
that made clear and precise the parameters of a medium's own nature -- the 
flatness of a painting, to cite the most famous example -- and nothing more, 
was successful for expressing moral honesty. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, artistic illusionism was claimed to be naturally dishonest, false, 
a masquerade for art. And illusionism, from commercial advertisements to the 
movies, was the stuff of pop culture kitsch. 
</P>
<P>
Notice the specific terminology Greenberg chose to use, in 1939, as brackets 
for "Avant-Garde and Kitsch." While the United States furiously debated its 
possible entry into a European war, the critic's remarkable essay made subtly 
suggestive equations for art. Greenberg lamented that the School of Paris had 
lost its avant-garde leadership, and he worried whether American artists would 
be able to pick up the banner. The French term, avant-garde, which had been 
adapted for modern artists in the 19th Century from the military phrase for an 
advance-scout team, was equated by the critic with a progressive tradition of 
moral honesty. Kitsch, which described popular and commercial art, was a slangy 
-- and pointedly German -- word that equaled treachery and falsehood. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg concluded his essay with a discussion of the tactics of Hitler, 
Mussolini and Stalin and of why they suppressed avant-garde art and championed 
popular culture, or kitsch. Politically, dictators could benefit by promoting 
an illusion that the masses actually rule; so the art the masses enjoyed and 
understood was proclaimed by fascist leaders to be the only true art, while the 
avant-garde was squelched. (Hitler's assault on modern art, incidentally, will 
be the subject of an eagerly anticipated show in February at the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art.) 
</P>
<P>
In Europe, a battle for the soul of art was on. And if an as-yet immature, 
American avant-garde was to blossom in any meaningful way, Greenberg believed a 
prohibition against the "taint" of popular culture was essential. 
</P>
<P>
The critic's opposing terminology was therefore compellingly descriptive, but 
hardly neutral. Eventually, cracks formed in the creation myth. Art is not as 
pure as Greenberg insisted. In retrospect, the use of morally loaded terms to 
describe cultural products, followed by a claim that those descriptions are 
somehow "natural," was plainly contradictory. Since the late 1950s, some of the 
most compelling art has been engaged in questioning, probing and dismantling 
this fiction, on which the very ascendance of American art in the postwar years 
was based. 
</P>
<P>
This is precisely the art which, from Pop and Minimalism onward, the Museum of 
Modern Art has been most wary about embracing. A great irony in "High &amp; 
Low" lurks in the near-total lack of self-reflection on the museum's own role 
in the subject. The interplay between modern art and popular culture has 
special meaning for the institution, for MOMA was founded in 1929 with a 
special goal in mind: to popularize in America the art of the avant-garde, a 
purpose the museum was to achieve with considerable success in the years that 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
MOMA had opened its doors within weeks of the great stock market crash, but the 
timing wasn't all bad. The Depression turned out to be the era of great, 
triumphant flowering for most of the mediums of popular culture we now take for 
granted. 
</P>
<P>
Movies began to talk. Network radio spread singular news and entertainment from 
coast to coast, and rudimentary experiments in television commenced. For radio 
(and later TV), effective commercial advertising became the very motive for 
establishing a broadcast system based on the network principle. Two inventors 
of new mass-culture forms emerged to wild success: Walt Disney and his animated 
films in Los Angeles, and Henry Luce and his multiple magazines in New York. 
And on a smaller but no less ambitious scale, the Museum of Modern Art began to 
sell the public on the heretofore obscure idea of advanced art and design. 
</P>
<P>
There's no need to rehearse here the well-known and hugely successful history, 
from the 1930s on, of MOMA and its innovative touring programs of packaged 
exhibitions. Let's just consider one example of the way its shows of modern art 
were themselves disseminated as mass entertainments. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's important 1936 exhibition, "Dada, Surrealism and Fantastic Art," 
introduced major aspects of the European avant-garde to America. It was also a 
publicity blockbuster. Newspapers and magazines couldn't get enough of the 
outrageous Salvador Dali, and Meret Oppenheim's sexually suggestive "Object" (a 
fur-lined teacup) created an uproar. In movie theaters across the country, 
Paramount and Universal showed newsreels about the exhibition, which itself 
generated more press locally when it traveled to cities in Pennsylvania, 
Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Minnesota and California. Russell Lynes, MOMA's 
official biographer, opined that by the end of the tour the fur-lined teacup 
was probably the best-known single object in America. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, none of this comes across today in the galleries of "High and Low," 
where the infamous teacup is safely ensconced in a case airlessly devoted to 
the influence of shop-window display on modern sculptors. The museum's own role 
as shop-window of a different kind doesn't come up. Perhaps the severest critic 
of such an "us" and "them" attitude -- and in fact of the exhibition as a whole 
-- is MOMA's own landmark building, which was elaborately renovated a few years 
ago. Stand in the new greenhouse atrium for a while, watching streams of 
visitors glide on sleek escalators up to the permanent collections or down to 
the show's basement galleries, and the numbing triviality of the exhibition's 
blinkered premise comes immediately into focus. Housed in a building whose 
architectural style is best described as Shopping Mall Modern, its 
"revelations" of art's sources in pop culture feel puny. 
</P>
<P>
Blinkers narrow perspective. Imagine, if you will, the pure folly of attempting 
to present a definitive thesis on the history of Baroque art and Catholicism 
without ever going to Rome. Now, recall a lecture given by The New Yorker's 
Adam Gopnik at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in June, at which the 
co-curator of a mega-show predicated on an understanding of popular culture 
allowed as he had never before been to L.A. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine, more fatefully, the destiny of artists working in Los Angeles during 
the postwar era -- decades that saw the final apotheosis of Southern California 
as pop culture Eden. There's no need to list (yet again) the artists in L.A. 
whose work has been grossly underrated during the last four decades. But how 
could it be otherwise? Since prevailing critical rhetoric had sought to 
eradicate any taint for the American avant-garde, the better to lift it to 
prominence over European art after World War II, who could finally champion any 
new art that was issuing forth from L.A., the crucible of kitsch? 
</P>
<P>
Certainly not the standard-bearing Museum of Modern Art. One Southern 
Californian is indeed represented in "High &amp; Low." Among the three early 
works by the redoubtable Edward Ruscha is a pungent, 1962 word-painting, in Boy 
Scout blue-and-yellow, that is a classic of the artist's pioneering fusion of 
commercial graphic style with established, high art motifs, so crucial to the 
1960s. "OOF," as this imposing canvas is descriptively titled, is the single 
major painting by Ruscha in MOMA's all-important permanent collection. It was 
acquired just two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
OOF, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
MOMA's traditional myopia goes in two directions. Kirk Varnedoe has added a 
contemporary coda to his historically minded exhibition, which otherwise pretty 
much ends with artistic developments in the 1960s. Work by three artists in New 
York who emerged as important in the 1980s -- Elizabeth Murray, Jeff Koons and 
Jenny Holzer -- is shown, in order to suggest that the source-mongering 
tradition continues. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy artists all. Astonishingly, though, it's as if the most salient 
development of the 1980s art world -- its internationalization -- had never 
happened. But not only did it happen, it was (and is, because it's still being 
played out) intimately caught up in the issue at hand. The stunning return to 
prominence of European art in the last dozen years stands as the flip side of 
the smaller, and simultaneous, re-emergence of Los Angeles as a cultural force. 
For if L.A. was created by the modern era as the great producer of American 
popular culture, Europe, in the difficult rebuilding of the post-war period, 
was re-created as its great consumer. Colonizing Europe with America's image, 
"the Colonies" returned the favor. Artists on both sides of the Atlantic have 
worked from that experience for a generation. 
</P>
<P>
At MOMA, though, the smaller story of "Modern Art and Popular Culture" is 
framed by the larger one the museum has told from the start: In the beginning 
there was Paris (and a few artistic suburbs, such as Moscow and Berlin), and 
when that was over there was the island of New York. It's fine with me if the 
folks on 53rd Street want to keep flogging that tired tale. But after years of 
Rip Van Winkle drowsiness, its influence in things contemporary has grown 
mighty dim. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it might be too much to expect a wholesale rewriting of the history of 
20th-Century art from the museum, which has a lot at stake in maintaining The 
Official Story. It's hardly possible to imagine them fostering a scorched-earth 
revision that, say, went something like this: Abstract Expressionism wasn't the 
fragile beginning of a modern, American avant-garde, but the triumphant end of 
a European one; on this fresh foundation of a mature American art, the 1960s in 
New York, Los Angeles and the established capitals of Europe witnessed the 
early, fitful emergence of something else, something that is still taking 
shape. Whatever that something might be -- Post-Modernism seems to have faded 
as the aesthetic term of choice -- it clearly has to do with experience in an 
entrepreneurial world of consumable images. 
</P>
<P>
MOMA's curators began "High &amp; Low" with old convictions about the art of 
the past, then tried to march forward with the banner. Had they begun with new 
convictions about the art of the present -- convictions tantalizingly, even 
startlingly announced at the end of the exhibition catalogue -- and then looked 
back to see how we got where we are, they might have enlarged our vision of 
history. What's in MOMA's show today would go where it belongs -- into the 
catalogue, as background -- and what is now only suggested in the book's final 
chapter ("Contemporary Reflections") would be fleshed out as a full-scale 
exhibition. Whether or not visitors to such a show would agree with the 
museum's choices about which art of our cultural moment really matters, and 
why, at least there would be something to sink your teeth into. As it stands, 
there's only predigested mush. 
</P>
<P>
"High &amp; Low" amply demonstrates that the Museum of Modern Art isn't just 
parochial, which is to be expected of any earth-bound institution. Instead, the 
ghastly feeling of enervation in the show is caused by a creeping awareness 
that its long period of disengagement has left the museum painfully, horribly 
provincial.

Photo, COLOR, "High &amp; Low" at New York's Museum of Modern Art traces spiral 
paths of influences: Philip Guston began borrowing comic book imagery in the

TOO MUCH PICASSO, TOO LITTLE 'ALLEY OOP'

Right now, the Museum of Modern Art has Zap Comics on display. Also "Alley 
Oop," "Heart Throbs," "Men of War," Mad magazine and Cadillac's 1956 ad for 
"the greatest advancements it has ever achieved in motor car styling and 
engineering!" 
</P>
<P>
This may sound like fun-house, turn-the-tables thrills to you. It is also 
amazing coming from the Bauhaus headquarters of the high-taste police. The 
exhibition is called "High &amp; Low: Modern Art and Popular Culture." So 
naturally it stars Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Marcel Duchamp, Andy Warhol 
and Jenny Holzer. 
</P>
<P>
It is all about the love-hate relationship between high art and the mass 
culture of a mechanized age. But this is no modern romance; it is a class war. 
And winner takes all. What we have here is just one more version of that 
time-honored art world formula: Need new blood? Get the lower classes! 
</P>
<P>
Call it the Caravaggio equation, after the 17th-Century painter who rescued the 
art of Rome from an overdose of manners by recruiting nasty adolescent street 
toughs to pose for his pictures. 
</P>
<P>
When artists need to breathe life and blood into art-gone-stale, they invite in 
the real world. So why not an art institution? 
</P>
<P>
Particularly now, when the Museum of Modern Art has just completed its changing 
of the guard. The old regime, led by William Rubin, emeritus director of the 
department of painting and sculpture, defined modern art as an increasingly 
abstract and cerebral continuum from Cezanne through Picasso to Stella. 
</P>
<P>
This made for some dazzling exhibitions, from "The Late Cezanne" to the 
museumwide "Picasso" retrospective. But that left the museum hopelessly blind 
to the art of the last 25 years, which is seldom abstract and which shudders at 
the whole idea of progress. 
</P>
<P>
Then, two years ago, enter the new painting and sculpture director, Kirk 
Varnedoe. When it comes to defining modern art, he comes squarely down on the 
side of both modernist tradition and idiosyncratic inclusiveness in his recent 
book "A Fine Disregard." 
</P>
<P>
"The rules of the game are not something you play by," he wrote. "They're 
something you play with." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, play is not the operating principle of the High-Low show, which 
is, in effect, Varnedoe's solo debut at MOMA -- though he picked a collaborator 
to help, New Yorker writer Adam Gopnik. 
</P>
<P>
Varnedoe's other MOMA exhibition, "Vienna 1900," was a reconstituted version of 
a Viennese predecessor, and he collaborated with Rubin on the "Primitivism" 
exhibition, which wanted to show how modern art borrowed from tribal cultures. 
</P>
<P>
"Primitivism" was gorgeous and controversial. "Vienna" was stunning, and staged 
with the theatricality of an operetta. 
</P>
<P>
Either controversy or theatricality surely would have helped High-Low. Instead 
we get Cubism, lots of Cubism. It's as if Varnedoe is telling Rubin -- whose 
last exhibition was "Picasso-Braque: Pioneering Cubism" -- what the old boy 
left out. And what the old boy left out, in the new world of revisionist art 
history, is social context and iconography. Those words that Picasso and Braque 
introduced into their paintings meant something: They came from ads and 
newspapers, and the artists were really punning it up. When they cut "urnal" 
from "Le Journal," according to this exhibition, they were 
</P>
<P>
making a schoolboy reference to urinals. 
</P>
<P>
So the show starts out with a reproduction of the sort of newspaper-loaded 
kiosk that Picasso and Braque might have encountered, which is cute; there are 
also a lot of blown-up newspapers and ads circled in red where the artists 
appropriated something. So far so good. 
</P>
<P>
But there is far too much Picasso and far too little "Alley Oop" at the MOMA. 
The comic books and car ads haven't been invited in to reinvigorate the place. 
Except in that very first Cubism part, they are merely there to serve their 
betters. 
</P>
<P>
They are there the way you get little thumbnail black-and-white plates in art 
history books that relate a full-colored painting to its sources. You mean Roy 
Lichtenstein borrowed from comic books? Gosh! And there's Lichtenstein after 
Lichtenstein to compare with some of the hardly doctored comics from which he 
borrowed. You have to turn to the catalogue to learn that both Lichtenstein and 
the Cubists were revitalizing popular forms ("Young Romance" and "Army at War" 
were about to be blown away by feminism and the Vietnam War). But no 
speculation as to why. 
</P>
<P>
When we get to the graffiti part of the show, there isn't a single example of 
real subway graffiti on view. Not to mention the 
street-graffiti-kids-turned-art-world-heroes whom MOMA disdains to recognize. 
Not even Keith Haring. Instead there are a great many of Jean Dubuffet's 
brutally scrawled post-Holocaust paintings, and Cy Twombly's calligraphic 
version of Abstract Expressionism in graffiti dress. And who wouldn't welcome a 
chance to see so much good Dubuffet and Twombly in one place? It's just that 
this context turns them into cliches. 
</P>
<P>
What would really be new would be to see a De Kooning "Marilyn Monroe" here, or 
a "Woman" with the mouth he cut from a Camels ad. But you're not going to see 
Abstract Expressionism in a show like this. Not even Ad Reinhardt's scurrilous 
cartoons lampooning the art world. That would go against received opinion, and 
received opinion is what this show is all about.

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: REQUESTS FOR CUSTOM TAGS GET A GOOD GOING-OVER BY THE 
CENSORSHIP FOLKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
ONE OF THE FEW remaining pleasures of freeway driving is deciphering those 
custom license plates -- the ones that say I WUV U and so forth. 
</P>
<P>
They are called "personalized license plates" because they reflect the 
interests, the occupations or the passions of their owners. They are also 
called "environmental plates," since the fees paid for them go to the state's 
environmental program. 
</P>
<P>
They are often amusing, sometimes too clever to understand and sometimes too 
cute to bear. One expresses a wistful wish: 02B21. Some seem close to the edge 
of good taste, but few go over it. 
</P>
<P>
The state is vigilant against sexual innuendoes and racial slurs. Plates that 
violate the rules are rejected. The testing is thorough. They are even read 
backwards, to avoid words that could be obscene in rear-view mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I have never had personalized plates. My reason is that I have 
thought of only two I wanted, and both have already been taken. One was J 
SMITH. One day I parked right behind a J SMITH on York Boulevard. The other was 
FIAT LUX -- let there be light. I would have bought a Fiat to go with it, but, 
alas, my wife saw it one day on a freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Yvonne M. de La Paix of Westminster writes to complain about a letter she 
received from the Department of Motor Vehicles ordering her to surrender her 
plates. They read DOO WHOP, and the DMV explained that the Sons of Italy had 
complained that word WHOP was too close to a racial epithet. 
</P>
<P>
In the first place, De La Paix notes, she had sold the car and the plates five 
months before receiving the DMV's letter. "I was still angered by the letter, 
implying that I was a bigot, and that if I didn't turn over my plates in 14 
days, I would be taken to court." 
</P>
<P>
DOO WHOP, she says, was a very popular form of music in the '50s and '60s. It 
might be spelled in various ways, she concedes, but WHOP is one. The Sons of 
Italy demanded the recall of any plates that sounded like either of two 
epithets commonly applied to Italians. The DMV told her that their computers 
had turned up 400 such words among plates already issued. 
</P>
<P>
"My license plate was not in any way a racist comment," she says. "unless the 
DMV or the Sons of Italy didn't know what they were attacking. You can bet that 
any employee of Burger King with a license that reads WHOPPER got the same 
letter." 
</P>
<P>
De La Paix wonders how far this sensitivity can be carried. "With media fanning 
the fires of ethnic and religious tension, how far are we supposed to go to 
avoid being called a bigot? Are we looking for racism everywhere, hoping to 
find it? Do we have to start stretching our imagination to wild lengths to find 
it?" 
</P>
<P>
I agree with De La Paix that the injunction against WHOP is too strenuous. 
There was no intent in DOO WHOP to suggest the other word; it is indeed a 
different word. And in conjunction with DOO, the other word would be 
meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile John Kane of Rancho Palos Verdes condemns me for agreeing in a recent 
column with columnist Mike Royko that the proscription of many common words and 
phrases on "racist" grounds has gone too far. On the other hand, I said, there 
were certain words I would never use, for the same reason. 
</P>
<P>
"I am quite disappointed in you," Kane writes. "It seems to me that freedom of 
speech means freedom of speech and that reporters and columnists (such as 
yourself and Royko) should support it unhesitatingly and without any 
reservations or pussy-footing around for fear of hurting someone's feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"Either we have freedom of speech or we do not. For any newspaper and any 
writer to agree that any pre-censorship is correct appalls me beyond belief. It 
seems to me that once we start saying 'You can say what you wish except for . . 
.' we are in serious trouble. Sir, I am ashamed of you." 
</P>
<P>
Oh, fiddlesticks, Kane. 
</P>
<P>
We live in a multiethnic society. In any society, the language inevitably 
produces words that offend or abuse certain groups. Anyone who cares about 
achieving harmony in that society will voluntarily avoid using words that act 
as firebrands. 
</P>
<P>
As Oliver Wendell Holmes said, one may not, under the protection of the First 
Amendment, cry "Fire!" in a crowded theater. Likewise, one ought not to use 
inflammatory terms in a crowded society. One who writes for a newspaper of 
general circulation is especially commended to this discretion. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Department of Motor Vehicles is too easily spooked in 
deferring to demands for the censorship of WHOP. The next thing you know 
they'll censor SECTS on the ground that it sounds too much like you know what.

KEVIN COSTNER'S DANCE WITH THE SIOUX; 
</P>
<P>
HOW THE DIRECTOR AND STAR ACHIEVED AUTHENTICITY IN HIS UNUSUAL FILM TRIBUTE TO 
THE SIOUX, 'DANCES WITH WOLVES'

<TEXT>
<P>
Doris Leader Charge earned more money working for Kevin Costner for six months 
than she does in a year teaching Lakota, a Sioux dialect, on the Rosebud 
Reservation in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
"Our people are very poor," said Leader Charge, who is 60 and earned her 
college degree only a few years ago. "Nobody has work. Few own cars. Few speak 
good English. . . . We have big problems." 
</P>
<P>
But Leader Charge and her husband, Fred, were able to elude those problems, for 
a while anyway, at last weekend's Washington premiere and press junket for 
Costner's "Dances With Wolves." 
</P>
<P>
It was a heady weekend. The Leader Charges were put up in a flower-filled suite 
at the Ritz Carlton; they were invited to order room service and treated like 
stars at a glitzy reception. They were also quizzed by reporters. "It's rare to 
get anyone interested in our culture," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the high life, however, the American Indians kept returning to their high 
hopes that the movie would draw more than just money for Hollywood -- perhaps a 
wave of respect for their culture, verging on extinction since white 
frontiersmen began taking their land and depleting their buffalo herds in the 
19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
"We have very little things to be proud of," said Leader Charge 
matter-of-factly but with pride. "This could do us some good." 
</P>
<P>
The American Indians involved in Costner's $18-million project are hoping that 
the new movie will entice the public into a more accurate understanding of the 
Sioux affinity for peace, family and humor. 
</P>
<P>
In this movie, in fact, there are none of the old Hollywood stereotypes of the 
"Injun." There are no drunken savages nor white actors covered in red 
greasepaint hanging out at the trading post and uttering words like "How" at 
the white folks. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, the movie portrays Sioux families living and working together. There 
are ritual dances and a wedding; wives warmly embrace their husbands as the men 
head off to fight another tribe. There are herds of beautiful horses and, in 
every scene, children underfoot. 
</P>
<P>
As the Costner character in the film describes life among the Sioux, "Every day 
ends with a miracle. They are eager to laugh, devoted to family, dedicated to 
each other." Costner and crew are hoping this flip side of the "Injun" story 
will sell. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not in the message business," Costner told reporters. "I'm in the 
entertainment business." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the lengths he went through to get the details right are illustrated in one 
of many fights he had with the studio, Orion Pictures. This one was over a 
promotional poster of Costner, who plays John Dunbar, a cavalry officer adopted 
by a Sioux tribe. In the film, Dunbar has a mustache; but in the poster, the 
studio insisted he be cleanshaven to play up his good looks. "You make 
compromises," he said stiffly. 
</P>
<P>
The actor, who made his directorial debut in this film, was also pressed to cut 
a slowly unfolding scene in which actress Mary McDonnell, cast as a white woman 
adopted into the tribe as a child, plays charades trying to describe her name 
-- Stands With a Fist -- to Dunbar. 
</P>
<P>
"They said cut the charade scene, but I wouldn't," Costner said, sounding a bit 
petulant. "The scenes they wanted me to cut were often why the movie was made. 
It wasn't for the big buffalo scenes. The buffalo were made for the movie. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason I made the movie was to have a character like Ten Bears (the chief) 
put things in perspective when he says, 'My grandfather's grandfather fought 
the Spaniards, then came the Texans and now the soldiers. I don't think we can 
stop this tide.' " 
</P>
<P>
One of the filmmakers' primary efforts to ensure authenticity centered on 
language. Two studios turned down the project because of the filmmakers' 
insistence that almost a third of the dialogue be in Lakota, most of it 
subtitled. "The thought of everybody speaking English was ludicrous to all of 
us," said producer Jim Wilson. Orion allowed the subtitles. 
</P>
<P>
Leader Charge, who teaches the Lakota language and culture at Sinte Gleska 
College, a small community college on the Rosebud Reservation, tutored the 
cast, including Costner, on their lines in Lakota. She and another instructor 
also spent three weeks translating the screenplay into the language of the 
Sioux. And Leader Charge was cast in the film as Pretty Shield, a Sioux 
matriarch. 
</P>
<P>
Teaching the American Indian actors their lines, however, was the most 
difficult job she had. "They were resistant," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd Red Crow Westerman, a Sioux actor and singer who plays Ten Bears, 
suggested that their resistance might stem from years of "having their language 
beaten out of them. 
</P>
<P>
"When most of us were kids, we were prohibited in government schools to speak 
our own tongue," said Westerman. "You could build up resistance from an 
experience like that." 
</P>
<P>
Casting director Elisabeth Leustig interviewed thousands of American Indian 
actors for the central roles and cast as many as 150 Sioux from Rosebud as 
extras. (Not one white person plays an American Indian part.) 
</P>
<P>
"She made me go through my telephone book and give her the name of every Indian 
actor I've ever known in North America," Tantoo Cardinal, a Canadian actress, 
said with a laugh. "This movie gave a lot of work to Indian actors." 
</P>
<P>
The filmmakers were as zealous about details when it came to the wardrobe and 
props. The creative designers used libraries and archives throughout the West 
researching the Sioux world. Outfits were created from 625 deerskin. Buffalo 
skins, feathers and beads were used to re-create accessories. And the producer 
turned to Cathy Smith, a 19th-Century plains Indian expert from South Dakota, 
to help design everything from costumes to tepees. 
</P>
<P>
John Barry, the composer-conductor of the film's 90-minute score, also listened 
to Sioux music before he began writing. Cyvert Young Bear of the Porcupine 
Singers was enlisted to choreograph buffalo and scalp dances. 
</P>
<P>
To train his own eye before filming, Costner said he perused dozens of 
photographs and paintings of American Indians, particularly oils by Remington 
and Russell. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to recall the feeling of the times," he said. "I think you would do 
that with any movie. It's part of your obligation when you do any period 
piece." 
</P>
<P>
The film, which ran into cost and time overruns as the filmmakers sought 
historical accuracy, does bend the truth in places, according to the American 
Indian actors. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in one scene a group of children try to steal Dunbar's horse. When 
there is a threat the parents will learn of this escapade, one child worries 
that his father will break a bow on his back. 
</P>
<P>
Tantoo Cardinal and Rodney Grant, who plays a young warrior, Wind in the Hair, 
said American Indians would never punish their children by beating them. "But 
you can't forget, this is a movie, fiction," Cardinal said. "We didn't set out 
to do a documentary." 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal and Grant both mentioned movies -- specifically, a recent film, "War 
Party" -- that swayed much farther from truth, and its script, than does 
"Dances With Wolves." 
</P>
<P>
Said Grant: "The script we read had little to do with what ended up on screen 
in 'War Party.' They may have set out to portray Indians like real people, but 
it didn't end up that way." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, many of the American Indian stars said that even though they had 
worked closely with Costner and trusted his instincts, they were apprehensive 
before they saw the film at the Washington premiere. 
</P>
<P>
"We've all been betrayed before and seen a lot of our work on the cutting room 
floor," Cardinal said. 
</P>
<P>
But this time she wasn't disappointed. "I think it's a milestone movie. I think 
that for our people it will be a classic." 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, Costner, Wilson and McDonnell were "made a relative" of the 
Lakota in a sacred ceremony in the shadow of the Capitol dome. There -- on the 
great marble plains -- the actors were initiated into the tribe with drums, 
chanting and feathers. Scores of the film's promoters swarmed among the 
journalists and tourists watching the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Crazy Bull, a Sinte Gleska College official who participated in the 
event, had been concerned that the Sioux were being exploited by having the 
ceremony there. 
</P>
<P>
But if it seemed a bit hokey to hold such a sacred ceremony on Capitol Hill, in 
the end the Indians didn't think so. 
</P>
<P>
"Our feelings toward these people, Kevin and Jim and Mary, were genuine," said 
Crazy Bull, who pinned a feather in Wilson's hair and wrapped him in a tribal 
blanket as part of the ritual. "They took a risk doing this project and 
certainly did something for us by portraying native people as human beings." 
</P>
<P>
She and others who came across the country for the premiere admitted they wept 
throughout the film, not so much over how it illustrates the inevitability of 
history, but over what could have been. 
</P>
<P>
"It was heartbreaking to me to see the loss we experienced," Crazy Bull said by 
phone from the Rosebud reservation. "Here we had a people who were 
self-sufficient, who had rules of how society behaved toward each other. To see 
the laughter and the dignity. . . . We don't have that now. We have poverty and 
sadness. I guess the movie just reminds us of what could have been."

I applaud Meryl Streep's speaking up on women in the movie industry ("Meryl 
Acts Up," by Hilary De Vries, Sept. 9). 
</P>
<P>
I rarely go to the movies for the reason that movies like "Pretty Women" exist. 
They are insulting to my intelligence. It is the exception when a movie comes 
out that portrays a real woman, rather than a male fantasy. It is evident in 
Streep that strong, humorous and, above all, intelligent women exist.

I was at the Screen Actors Guild's first women's conference held recently in 
Los Angeles and felt inspired, as did many others, to address the image and 
employment problems facing actresses today. 
</P>
<P>
Five of us have started an organization called Women's Screen Image to effect 
change in how females are portrayed and hence to stretch their value on and off 
the screen. As a networking and support group for writers, producers, casting 
directors, actresses and directors we believe we can make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
Raising people's awareness is the first step. Your article certainly helps to 
keep the dialogue going.

I fail to understand why it's someone else's responsibility to straighten out 
Meryl Streep's salary inequity. It seems that she should be capable of handling 
this problem herself. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, there are like-minded men and women who will assist. Let's find and 
confront the culprits responsible for this dastardly act. 
</P>

In the chronology of Streep's screen credits there was one omission that I'm 
aware of, and I'm sure that Woody Allen would notice -- "Manhattan," although 
it wasn't a pivotal role for Streep, I always think we should give ol' Woody 
his due for the new interesting faces that he has introduces to the screen; 
there have been so many.

I am a 36-year-old post-college-educated woman who hungers for intelligent 
film. 
</P>
<P>
My girlfriends are mostly professionals who grew up watching Bette Davis, 
Katherine Hepburn and Joan Crawford films on TV. There are a lot of us out here 
-- baby boomers who have money to spend on entertainment and can appreciate 
intelligently written films with strong female leads. "Postcards From the Edge" 
sounds like a film that on many different levels appeals to people like us. I 
implore the movie industry to satisfy our needs.

IF A TRIP to New York City isn't on your agenda, you can still visit one of its 
famous landmarks -- right here. 
</P>
<P>
Two new Metropolitan Museum of Art shops, to be opened early in November, will 
offer items previously available to Southern Californians by mail-order only. 
</P>
<P>
Some are reproductions of the Metropolitan's original works of art, and often 
the same techniques and materials used to create the originals are employed 
with these for-sale reproductions, as illustrated by the Victorian glass candy 
cane ornaments (pictured). All profits are channeled back to the museum.

COMES A TIME in a person's life when the urge to publish strikes. That impulse 
can find expression, given the presence of a personal computer and software 
that makes creating a newsletter or party invitation as simple as 
point-and-click. 
</P>
<P>
But lacking such pricey tools, one must resort to glue sticks and Magic Markers 
-- or a visit to Imageland. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA professor of design Mits Kataoka founded Imageland with the desire to 
bring the latest technologies in full-color imaging and graphic design to the 
layman and to allow his clients full creative control over their projects, 
which range from the creation of posters, business cards and brochures to 
T-shirt art. The typical customer has no previous experience with such 
technology, and some have no experience in the visual arts (one exception was 
artist David Hockney, who paid a visit in order to experiment). Imageland 
charges $45 per half-hour for the use of its equipment and the assistance of a 
trained operator; printing and copying fees are added on. 
</P>
<P>
Just visiting Imageland can prove inspirational. "Consumers get ideas from what 
they see," Kataoka says, "and professionals get ideas from things consumers 
have done."

FOR 30 YEARS, THE ICE HOUSE IN PASADENA HAS LAUNCHED THE CAREERS OF YOUNG 
COMEDIANS WHO NOW FORM A COMEDY WHO'S WHO

<P>
No sooner had owner Bob Fisher announced Oct. 29 as the day he'd throw a party 
to celebrate the Pasadena Ice House's 30th anniversary when he discovered that 
he had the wrong date. And if that weren't bad enough, the anniversary had 
already passed. 
</P>
<P>
His mortification was short-lived, however. Like radon, a certain small trace 
of odd luck always seemed to be seeping up through the landmark comedy club's 
venerable floorboards, some of it natural, some of it man-made, as when one of 
his headliners, Denny Johnston, called up shortly before show time one night to 
say that he was stranded in Big Bear and wouldn't be able to appear. Since it's 
club policy to refund all monies if a headliner doesn't show, Fisher saw his 
life flash before him in a flutter of airborne dollar bills. Not to worry, 
however. Johnston had slipped in unnoticed and was calling from Fisher's own 
office in the club. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, if the club's beginnings aren't quite dubious, they certainly are 
vague. Sept. 21, 1961 is the date when Fisher's predecessor, Bob Stane, came up 
from San Diego to open the room as a kind of folk-singer, comedy-act 
coffeehouse strongly reminiscent of the subterranean Beatnik era hangout, but 
that was nearly a year after Stane's silent partner, Willard Chilcott, had 
worked at length on refurbishing the place. 
</P>
<P>
Too, "I don't think it was ever really just an ice house," says Fisher. "There 
was an Army barracks nearby during the war, and my feeling is that this was 
really a meat locker for the troops. I think it was called an ice house to 
satisfy the genteel tastes of the people who lived in the Pasadena mansions." 
</P>
<P>
The Ice House is more than a club that owes its existence to a benevolently 
obscure, low-rent location pitched near the base of the San Gabriel Mountains. 
It's an unlikely institution that has survived radical changes in atmosphere 
and taste while remaining a clearinghouse for young talent on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the comedy and music acts that have played there include Jay Leno, Lily 
Tomlin, Steve Martin, Mort Sahl, Bob Newhart, Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, 
Linda Ronstadt, Diane Keaton, the Smothers Brothers, Pat Paulsen, Mason 
Williams, Cheech &amp; Chong, George Carlin, Seals &amp; Crofts, Hoyt Axton, 
Kenny Rogers, Don Ellis, the Association, the Aman Folk Ensemble, Randy Sparks, 
Captain Beefheart, Glen Campbell, Rod McKuen, Toshiko Akiyoki &amp; Lew 
Tabakin, the Firesign Theater and Hiroshima. (Forty albums have been recorded 
there.) 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fabulous club," says comedian Emily Levine. "Sometimes it's a danger to 
think you've got good material because the audience responds so well." 
</P>
<P>
"The one nice thing about it is that it's a comedy club in the classic 
tradition of working the room," says Leno, who played there a great deal in the 
mid-'70s (there's a photo of a younger Leno on the entrance wall in which, 
characteristic of what was au courant in the '70s, he looks as though his hair 
doesn't belong to him). "You never follow anyone who's been doing incredibly 
filthy work. It's a family club with a '60s sense of what's risque. I think of 
David Steinberg doing his God routine, which everyone at the time thought 
daring, with the double-entendre that parents could appreciate and kids didn't 
get. It's the last vestige of clubs like the Bitter End, or the Hungry i, which 
don't exist anymore." 
</P>
<P>
A framed copy of the club's 1978 contract with David Letterman also hangs on 
the entrance wall; he's signatory to a salary of $250 for 11 shows for the 
week. Another framed contract tells us that Paul Rodriguez has two years of 
college and wanted to play the club to help advance his career. 
</P>
<P>
When George Winston was starting out, he didn't even play the main room. Bob 
Stane recalls him playing Footsie's (an adjacent room) and sleeping on stage 
beforehand in bare feet. Russ Guitere started out at the club as a janitor, 
then worked the lights, and then formed the Association, which went on to 
record a No. 3 hit, "One Too Many Mornings." 
</P>
<P>
By any commercial standard, 30 years is a long time. If 1960 was indeed the Ice 
House's inception date, Dwight D. Eisenhower was still President of the United 
States, the heart pacemaker had just been introduced, the national per capita 
income was $1,891 and the minimum wage $1, and the new two-door Corvair 
retailed for $1,870. If September of 1961 marked the club's opening, President 
John F. Kennedy was smarting from the abortive Bay of Pigs invasion, multiplex 
stereo was the newest thing to hit the hi-fi market, the M-4 robot-manned space 
capsule made its first orbit of the Earth, and the American Cancer Society 
announced its finding of a link between cigarettes and lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Stane, who is a career professional photographer, ran a coffee house in San 
Diego called the Upper Cellar that attracted a lot of off-duty and/or 
unemployed entertainers, whose restless indolence Stane found irksome. "I was 
showing movies, playing chess and I'd have all these people standing around," 
he recalled. "Finally I shortened the legs of a coffee table for a stage, put a 
bulb in a can, and let them work. When I came up to Pasadena, they followed." 
</P>
<P>
Stane's objective eye led him to insist on ambience before anyone set foot in 
the room. "Every nook and cranny was designed with a film set in mind, so that 
a lot of TV and movie people could work here," he said. " 'The Harrod 
Experiment' was filmed here. I wanted a heavy coffeehouse look without the feel 
of heavy, an excitement quotient. We'd throw pine in the fireplace for a smoky 
effect. When people came through here, they'd feel as though they were running 
a mysterious gauntlet." 
</P>
<P>
The combination of dark wood and brick created an intimate, nocturnal setting 
that invoked philosophic reflection and a shadowy anteroom for emanations of 
the id. ("You could hear comedy and then go pick up girls," says Paul 
Rodriguez. "It's great.") 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the main-room format: Three acts, music or comedy or both, with 
an emphasis on the performer as entertainer ("I kept telling Diane Keaton to 
loosen up," Stane recalls). He also insisted on professionalism and a modicum 
of taste. "I would not let anyone work blue. We had 16-year-olds and their 
parents coming in. Besides, I wanted them to have no excuse if a TV producer 
came out here to hire them. That's why so many Ice House performers have gone 
on to bigger things. If you played here, they'd audition you." 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis on professionalism is underscored in a recollection by Fred 
Willard, who came to California in the mid-'70s with the New York-based comedy 
sketch group the Ace Trucking Company, which made liberal use of the Ice House 
to polish material for the "Tonight" show (where they made 40 appearances). 
</P>
<P>
"One night we were sitting in the dressing room working on some new sketches," 
Willard said. "That was during the period when streaking was in vogue. I don't 
know if management put her up to it or not, but this girl ran in one door and 
out the other. She was completely naked. I remember somebody in the group 
making a brief reference to her endowments. Otherwise, we hardly skipped a beat 
and kept on working." 
</P>
<P>
John Gribble is a music teacher and poet who lives in Long Beach. He ran the 
club's lights off and on for eight years beginning in 1964. "There was always a 
lot of variety, and nobody was just a player," he said. "Everyone had to have 
an act. The music business in lots of ways is a dirty business, and a large 
part of it is made up of the clubs, which are often no more than upholstered 
sewers. But that wasn't true of the Ice House. The performers were treated 
well, and there was always a sense of family about the place. It was a relaxed 
place to work in or just listen. As long as you took care of your 
responsibilities, there were no hassles. No one assaulted your sensibilities, 
and you weren't gouged." 
</P>
<P>
Gribble saw a lot of performers come through and remembers the early Steve 
Martin vividly. "Lily Tomlin was lovely to work with. Mason Williams (the 
guitarist who wrote and recorded 'Classical Gas') could be cold, but he was 
also giving -- he gave me an on-the-spot guitar lesson once. Steve Martin had a 
banjo-magic act. He'd play the hell out of the banjo, then he'd go on to do 
these magic tricks that didn't work. He'd make balloon cartoon shapes that 
didn't look like anything. He'd say, 'As soon as the next audience comes in, 
I'll tell a joke that isn't funny. But you laugh as though it was hilarious.' 
Sure enough, people'd come in, he'd tell the joke, the first audience would 
laugh like hell, and you'd see the strangest confused reactions with couples 
and people who didn't know what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
"Martin was the first comedian to break down the audience hostility towards 
comics who opened for rock acts. That was because he learned how to play big, 
how to magnify every aspect of himself, from the white suit that caught your 
eye to his exaggerated 'Well excu-u-use me!' He certainly knew how to work an 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Smothers also remembers Martin from those days as someone who "had this 
weird thing. He didn't know what to play. He'd stand on a chair or on a table 
as Supersomething, wearing a cape. He'd have this little electric rabbit 
buzzing around on the floor, then he'd jump off and squash it." 
</P>
<P>
Smothers' mystification didn't prevent him from eventually hiring Martin as a 
writer for the Smothers Brothers' TV show or from shining on the club as a good 
venue for an album. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ice House is known as a comic's fail-safe room," Smothers said. "In 1965 
we were looking for a place to do an album for Mercury. I'd been out there to 
see Pat Paulsen, and when Bob Stane said he'd give us Honda 50s if we'd work 
there, we jumped at the deal. The record, which was called 'Something I Said,' 
went gold. Later we went out to record 'Pat Paulsen for President' on our own 
Rubicon label, and of course that was where we met Mason Williams. It's a 
classic room. The recording process could be quite tense for us, but the 
audience always made us feel relaxed. We were the first big act on TV that had 
worked out of the Ice House." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the steady stream of new talent that has used the Ice House as a 
springboard, the club has hardly enjoyed a perpetual revel or the nonstop music 
of ringing cash registers (or in the new age, the minimalist clatter of 
computerized receipts). If Stane thought the place would be, as he puts it, 
"more romantic if you had to look for it," there is something strange about a 
venue that (a) can't be seen from the street, (b) is difficult to find, and (c) 
means that a wrong turn in any of several directions in trying to find it can 
easily put you head-on into oncoming traffic. 
</P>
<P>
And the popularity of any entertainment form is cyclic. "For two years after 
the Watts riot it was a disaster here," Stane says. "It took the edge out of 
going out for a long time. Plus, that period seemed to coincide with a general 
dearth of talent. There were times when you could shoot a gun down Colorado 
Boulevard and not hit anyone." 
</P>
<P>
There is an even more esoteric quirkiness of fate that has visited strange 
things on the place. "There was a science of the mind shop next door that had a 
display of pyramids with razor blades hanging in them," Stane recalls. "The 
idea was that the pyramids had mystical qualities, one of them being the 
natural sharpening of the razor blades. We decided to bring the pyramids into 
the club, maybe 10 of them, 8 feet high, made of metal tubing. They turned on 
us. We had an incredible run of bad luck, plumbing breaking, performers not 
showing up, customers not showing up -- whole strings of things. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we decided to do an Egyptian passion play and got all these people up in 
Egyptian costumes to play it. We managed to get Channel 11 news out to cover 
it, which they did without ever mentioning where the thing was being done. Once 
we hosted a major comedy contest. Channel 2 came out and covered it but never 
showed the club. They showed the Handlebar Saloon down the street, but not the 
club." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the fate was less malign than prophetic. 
</P>
<P>
When George Carlin decided to shed his suit and tie and Hippy-Dippy Weather Man 
image in the late '60s and early '70s and go back to the counterculture origins 
of his Greenwich Village coffeehouse days, he used the stage of the Ice House 
to help with the transition. "I needed to reassure myself that I was right, 
that I had these other chops," he said. "The Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas fired 
me, which meant I lost an income of up to $12,000 a week. I kept doing TV shows 
like Virginia Graham and Della Reese and Merv Griffin to keep myself going, but 
I also worked the Attica in Santa Monica and The Other Side in Venice. And the 
Ice House. It had this sense of permanency, of family. 
</P>
<P>
"I had just bought this brand new Pontiac Firebird, which had just come out, 
and parked it in the street outside the club one night when I was working. It 
was a beautiful car, white with blue trim. When I came out, someone had 
sideswiped it, smashed it in completely on one side from front to rear. I 
remember saying that this is the small test and confirmation that I'm doing the 
right thing. This was tangible proof of my willingness to sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
As for the club itself, Carlin says, "I always had the feeling of being in 
capable, professional hands. So much goes unnoticed there. I always felt 
comfortable, at home, protected." 
</P>
<P>
For as long as he stayed indoors, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes its spell followed people wherever they went. Pat Paulsen's tenure 
represents a certain historic moment when something happens that transcends 
locale. In this case it was his bid for the presidency of the United States 
("We must remember that as the centuries go by time will pass" and "This is the 
only country in the United States" are only two of Paulsen's homages to the 
rhetorical fatuity of politicians on the make). Paulsen was one of the Ice 
House's early regulars, stopping by en route to Orange County clubs such as the 
Mecca, Mon Ami and the Golden Bear to perform his comedy takeoffs on the folk 
genre. They didn't, at first, go over with management, and the pickings were so 
lean that Paulsen wound up painting whatever needed to be painted in and 
outside of the club when he wasn't performing. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob (Stane) is not known as one of the people who . . . or does, or will, or 
how can I say this? He's cheap," Paulsen said. "It was only after the Smothers 
Brothers heard one of my songs that I started to get paid regularly. 
</P>
<P>
"I miss those days, and the club. It had a good, hip audience, a lot of 
variety, and quality." Paulsen is still campaigning under the slogan "Pat Who 
In '92." For as long as he represents, as he puts it, "the more than 50% of the 
people who don't vote," he figures he can't lose. 
</P>
<P>
By the late '70s, the pressures of running the Ice House had put Stane in a 
chronic pre-ulcerous condition, and he sold it to Fisher and three partners for 
$75,000 (its estimated value is now $1 million). Fisher, who is 46, gained a 
full liquor license for the place, put in a comedy format and eventually bought 
out his partners (one of whom, Jan Smith, went on to create another excellent 
comedy club on the Westside, Igby's). His first roster consisted of Rick &amp; 
Ruby, magician Peter DeParla and comedian Gallagher. It wasn't always smooth 
sailing. At one point early on, in fact, he had to sell his Porsche to make the 
payroll. 
</P>
<P>
Now the refurbished club, which seats 200, is busy all week and seems to be 
rolling along on its own momentum. "When we first took it over it was run-down 
and a little over the hill," Fisher says. "All you could get to eat was a giant 
soft pretzel with cheese" (now it has a restaurant, especially good for a night 
club, called Comics). "My attitude about the people who come here is that you 
have to make them feel like you care about them. You don't hassle them, or push 
them around or make them worry about where they'll sit. The room itself is 
magic. I've thought about expanding the space, but I know if I did that I'd 
spoil what it has, this rectangular, tiered, acoustically sharp space where 
everyone is close to the stage and the overall atmosphere is friendly and 
warm." (Fisher did in fact buy up an adjacent site but has donated it to the 
Inland Valley Child Abuse Prevention Center.) 
</P>
<P>
"This has been the best year in our history. We figure that over 2 million 
people have come through these doors since it opened, and 9,000 now come 
through each month." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher admits that the comedy boom has bottomed out into a terminal phase. 
"People don't like to be intellectually challenged anymore. They like the safe 
stuff, the 7-Eleven jokes. I think the lowering standard is not only the fault 
of club owners, but also of our educational system, TV values and a breakdown 
in parenting. Comedians don't look at the form as an end, but as a means to a 
sitcom. And it's overexposed. I see people getting tired of straight stand-up 
comedy. You're going to see a lot of clubs go under, and a lot try other 
things." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher doesn't see an immediate threat to his club, however. "The adage is, if 
you can't get a laugh at the Ice House, you can't get laughs anywhere."

<P>
William Shakespeare is alive and well and living in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Forget those nasty rumors about the Bard dying on April 23, 1616. The truth is 
written on the marquees of local theaters: "Twelfth Night" is at the La Jolla 
Playhouse's Mandell Weiss Theatre, "Hamlet" just completed a big, extended hit 
run on the Old Globe Theatre's mainstage, and "Cymbeline" is due to open at the 
San Diego Repertory Theatre's Lyceum Space Nov. 7, assuming the company can 
sufficiently resolve its present financial situation by that time. 
</P>
<P>
All this comes on the heels of a summer that included three well-attended 
outdoor Shakespeare productions: "As You Like It" at the Old Globe's Lowell 
Davies Festival Stage as well as two free low-budget productions by community 
theater groups, "Romeo and Juliet" by Octad-One outside the East County 
Performing Arts Center and "A Midsummer Night's Dream," by Christoper R and the 
Ruse Performance Gallery in Zorro Gardens in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Some might call the last few months in San Diego a Shakespeare festival. 
</P>
<P>
But you could just as easily call it theater as usual in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the city best known for fun and sun could just as easily be dubbed Chez 
Will. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the credit lies squarely with the Old Globe. It's not just coincidence 
that the Globe bears the same name as Shakespeare's original theater. The 
theater has been presenting Shakespeare each summer since 1949. 
</P>
<P>
Which means two generations of San Diegans have been weaned on Shakespeare. And 
audiences have proven that they care about getting their annual fare. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1953, following a drop in audience enthusiasm and attendance 
at the Shakespeare festival, the Old Globe dropped the Bard in favor of "Mr. 
Roberts." 
</P>
<P>
There was a hue and cry in the community. One headline read: "Shakespeare Walks 
the Plank." The Old Globe never tried that again. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, the Old Globe also shares some of Shakespeare's tragic theater 
history. Shakespeare's Globe burned to the ground in 1613 and was rebuilt in 
1614. In 1978 San Diego's Old Globe was burned to the ground at the hands of an 
arsonist who was never found. 
</P>
<P>
The new Old Globe reopened in 1982, appropriately with "As You Like It." 
</P>
<P>
As theater began to boom in San Diego in the 1980s, more theaters tackled 
Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
And, like many theaters nationwide, they began to put a contemporary spin on 
those productions. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the very first year of the revived La Jolla Playhouse, artistic 
director Des McAnuff boldly directed "Romeo and Juliet" as a tale that moved 
from present-day Italy with Mafioso undertones to ancient Verona and back. The 
company went on to include five Shakespeare plays during the following eight 
seasons. Each one has been challenging; McAnuff won't elaborate on what we can 
expect from the upcoming production of "Twelfth Night," but he does say that he 
sees the Illyria in which the twins Viola and Sebastian lose and find each 
other and their future mates as "a state of mind." 
</P>
<P>
In 1981 the San Diego Repertory Theatre also got into the act with a production 
of the rarely produced "Titus Andronicus." The company put a new spin on "A 
Midsummer Night's Dream" in 1987 by commissioning Max Roach to write an 
original jazz score and setting the fairy kingdom in a smoky dive that featured 
African American musicians. 
</P>
<P>
Even the tiny Lamb's Players Theatre in National City has produced four 
Shakespeare plays in eight years and has played with the setting each time. The 
company produced "Two Gentlemen of Verona" in the leather-jacketed bobby-soxed 
'50s, and designed a suburban California backdrop for "The Taming of the 
Shrew," complete with redwood deck and barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
There may have been a time at the beginning of San Diego's love affair with 
Shakespeare when audiences were attracted to Shakespeare because of the 
seriousness of his name. After all, even an untutored theater goer knows that 
in Shakespeare one sees the greatest theater the English language has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
And then, in the early days, some might have been attracted by the prospect of 
seeing some of the talented actors who ventured here to perform in Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
Actors, too, want the challenge of playing the greatest parts in the English 
language. 
</P>
<P>
But by the 1980s, the rules changed. 
</P>
<P>
Shakespeare, increasingly, has had to coexist with some of the best 
contemporary theater that San Diego has had to offer -- and some of that 
theater has been very fine indeed. 
</P>
<P>
So it has made sense to reexamine Shakespeare's work in light of contemporary 
realities. If Shakespeare is to compete with the likes of August Wilson, Lee 
Blessing, A.R. Gurney, David Mamet and Athol Fugard, some questions are 
inevitable. Can the playwright's work still mirror human life nearly four 
centuries after the work was written? Are the things he wrote about love, 
jealousy, ambition and philosophy still true for us, living in San Diego today? 
</P>
<P>
And would they seem as true set in a variety of eras as they do in traditional 
Elizabethan garb? 
</P>
<P>
The finest directors of our local stages as well as the renowned directors 
brought to our local stages have been telling us "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
And audiences are listening. More closely than ever, it seems. 
</P>
<P>
"Coriolanus," a triumph for the Old Globe, put a political spin on 
Shakespeare's ultimate warrior who ends by offending everyone. Director John 
Hirsch portrayed him as an Ollie North figure and completed the look with a 
jeep and modern arms and video-cameras. The Roman senators became American 
senators. Actor Dakin Matthews' honeyed Southern drawl as one of those senators 
fit Shakespeare's rhythms magnificently. 
</P>
<P>
Some productions are designed to pull audiences in. Robert Smyth, the artistic 
director at Lamb's, said that his reason for contemporizing Shakespeare was "to 
make it approachable for audiences that are afraid of Shakespeare. We want it 
to be accessible, to be enjoyed by an every day person." 
</P>
<P>
Still other productions push audiences further than they are willing to go. 
Robert Woodruff's direction of "The Tempest" at the La Jolla Playhouse 
overflowed with exciting parallels between the play's warring parties and 
American and Latin American interests. But there was an unfinished quality to 
the thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
Sledgehammer Theatre's "Hamlet" was a bold and unabashedly sexual/political 
reading of the play that assaulted the senses, often without a clearly 
discernable reason. But, being Shakespeare in San Diego, it merited a look. In 
this city, you take your Shakespeare with your Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
What many modern directors have discovered in looking at the Bard are both the 
advantages and disadvantages of Shakespeare's distance in time from us. The 
disadvantage is that we couldn't recreate Shakespeare's plays exactly as they 
were done in his time even if we wanted to. There are no precise records as to 
how they were done. 
</P>
<P>
But the advantage is that we can process the plays through the prism of nearly 
400 years of experience. We can match the play to the era it best suggests to 
us. History moves in cycles. Trends repeat. A play might suggest the beginning 
of the decline of European aristocracy in World War I. Or the lessons of I 
Ching. Or the racist fights that might attend an interracial "Romeo and Juliet" 
in the Old South -- or Orange County, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
A director's own personal experience may inform the choice. When Des McAnuff 
directed "Macbeth" at the La Jolla Playhouse last year, he and his wife, 
actress Susan Berman, had not yet had a child. He said the subject was on his 
mind when he related the ambition of the Macbeths to their childlessness. This 
year, as Berman gave birth to Julia Violet McAnuff, his focus has changed. 
</P>
<P>
"Emotionally I'm interested in the celebration of the play," McAnuff said with 
a smile. "This summer on a personal level is a nice time for love themes." 
</P>
<P>
Then, for others, Shakespeare becomes a yardstick by which one can measure 
one's own understanding of oneself and mastery of one's craft. 
</P>
<P>
For Jack O'Brien, artistic director of the Old Globe Theatre, the distance 
between his direction of "Hamlet" in 1977 and in 1990 was a very personal 
journey in which he explored his own feelings both about Shakespeare as a 
playwright and about himself as a director. 
</P>
<P>
"My first production of 'Hamlet' was born out of fear, trepidation, total 
intimidation and the fear I was going to be found out as a non-classicist and a 
Broadway baby. I put the play on in a classical way, but I didn't have an 
opinion about a character, incident or event. I was highly praised and I 
thought I got away with it. Now I've been here 13 years and there's been a lot 
of verse under the bridge. The more I know, the more trust I have. The more 
trust, the more confidence. The more confidence, the more honest I am. Now I 
ask questions. Now I don't worry about what you think. I worry about what I 
think. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's some of the best work I've ever done here," O'Brien said, 
referring to the currently running "Hamlet," "and I feel very fulfilled."

<P>
Regarding your article on the Southern California man "Tall, Dark, and 
Handsome," I think what you meant to say was: 
</P>
<P>
"The Southern California man is a bold individual in dress and fashion. He does 
not kowtow to the meaningless dictates of Madison and Seventh avenues. 
</P>
<P>
He has his own style and is not afraid to go it alone. 
</P>
<P>
"If long hair is out, but he likes long hair, he has long hair. He is not 
afraid of a wrinkle or a gray hair, he doesn't run to the beauty shop every 
time a foible appears on his immaculately bronzed and well-defined person. 
</P>
<P>
"There may well be days when his less-than-perfectly-honed razor has left a 
trace of stubble on his well-defined cheek and he may not even use any toners, 
under-eye concealers, mud facials or foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"In short, he is dictated not by Betty Goodwin, Michael Quintanilla, or any 
other fashion writers, or his wife, but by the sense of what he feels 
comfortable with." 
</P>
<P>
Apart from these few omissions, I enjoyed reading your article.

WHO'S HOT: WHITE RAP'S NEW FLAVOR: VANILLA ICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is Vanilla Ice the future of rap? 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, man, I don't know about that," replied the Miami native with the streaked 
blond hair, the first white rapper to break into the Top 10 album charts since 
the Beastie Boys in 1986. "I'm not trying to start any white movement. I'm not 
starting any wave." 
</P>
<P>
But this normally cocky young man may be underestimating his impact in the 
copy-cat pop world. 
</P>
<P>
Now that record executives see that there's a big market for white solo 
rappers, the chances are we'll see a lot more of them. 
</P>
<P>
The Beastie Boys' bratty mixture of punk and rap slightly opened a door for 
white rappers, but the group lost momentum with its second album, and none of 
the other white rappers -- from the duo 3rd Bass to female rappers Tairrie B 
and Misa -- have come close to the success of Vanilla Ice, whose debut album 
has sold more than 2 million copies in less than two months. 
</P>
<P>
One key difference between Ice -- who refuses to disclose his real name -- and 
the earlier white male rappers is that he deals in a more polite, mainstream 
style of rap. It's more like M. C. Hammer than the tough, urban sound of the 
Beasties and 3rd Bass. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Koppelman -- a veteran record-industry power who was instrumental in 
launching the careers of the pop vocal trio Wilson Phillips and 
singer-songwriter Tracy Chapman -- recognized Ice's mainstream potential before 
signing him to the SBK Records label. 
</P>
<P>
"His raps are wholesome and positive, nothing that's going to upset anybody," 
Koppelman, who runs SBK, said in a separate interview. "He's a handsome kid, a 
good dancer -- the kind of artist that would attract a strong female 
following." 
</P>
<P>
But Ice, whose striking good looks have made him a new MTV hero, bristles at 
the suggestion that he's just jumping on the rap bandwagon. He said he grew up 
in a black neighborhood in Miami, and even went to the same high school as 2 
Live Crew's Luther Campbell. Close your eyes and you'd swear you were talking 
to some guy from the ghetto -- complete with speech patterns and the latest 
street lingo. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up on the streets," Ice said proudly, sitting in a West Hollywood hotel 
room during a business trip. "I hung out with the black kids. They were hip. I 
wanted to be cool so I hung with the hip people. . . . I'd rap anywhere I could 
-- house parties, clubs, you name it." 
</P>
<P>
For a while, however, rapping had to compete with Ice's other interest: 
motorcycling. In fact, he only turned to rapping full-time after injuries 
forced him to retire in 1988 from the professional motocross circuit, where 
bikers race around indoor obstacle courses. 
</P>
<P>
"I've broken both my ankles," he said. "I've had surgery three times on the 
left one. If I hurt it again there's a chance I couldn't walk again." 
</P>
<P>
Ice's dramatic climb in rap began early this year when he released an album 
titled "Hooked" on Ultra Records, a small, independent Atlanta label. "Ice Ice 
Baby" -- a sultry track that borrows generously from the old David Bowie/Queen 
song "Under Pressure" -- got enough radio airplay in the Atlanta area that SBK 
bought the album and Ice's contract. SBK then released "Ice Ice Baby" as a 
single and added some additional tracks to the original "Hooked" album to form 
the present "To the Extreme" collection. 
</P>
<P>
When a white artist becomes a hit in the pop mainstream with what's essentially 
a black art form, he's likely to be accused of ripping off blacks. But so far, 
Ice said, he hasn't been the target of any such charges. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not trying to say I'm something I'm not," he pointed out. "Black people 
understand that. I'm just doing my raps, my way. Rap is black. I recognize that 
and respect that. I'm just a white guy trying to rap and I got lucky."

THE 5-MILLION-YEAR-OLD DESK

<P>
CHUNKS OF the planet's oldest rock are given contemporary incarnations when 
stoneArt Designs transforms 5-million-year-old granite into strikingly unusual 
furniture. The company's four-piece desk, for example, would complement any 
office interior that draws heavily on natural materials. 
</P>
<P>
The lean, angular design communicates a no-nonsense message about the person 
who sits behind it. 
</P>
<P>
The gray model (pictured, about $9,000) is just one of the color options; each 
desk claims the individual signature of its earthly component with a variety of 
colors (grays, brown, black, red or pink), veining and mineral intrusion, 
limited only by nature's imagination. It's composed of a writing surface 
resting atop two bases -- one triangular, the other L-shaped -- and comes with 
a separate mobile workstation that fits beneath it (the piece also can stand 
alone as a computer table or shelving unit). 
</P>
<P>
The desk is not the only stoneArt design; the firm produces unusual granite 
furniture for many purposes. All pieces are polished to a maintenance-free 
finish, and granite, the hardest of the igneous rocks, never fades or discolors 
and seldom suffers chips or scratches. Like sculpture, each desk is cut from a 
solid piece of stone. Because each piece is as individual as a thumbprint, the 
furniture is signed, dated and numbered by the worker who crafted it by hand in 
Melbourne, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Figuratively speaking, stoneArt creations are not set in stone. So if you fancy 
the idea but not the particular execution, the company is equipped and willing 
to accommodate custom designs. 
</P>
<P>
 stoneArt Designs are available at Uniquely Australian, Pacific Design Center, 
8687 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood; (213) 854-6100. For a stoneArt catalogue,

LOVERS OF HOME-GROWN vegetables who failed to get around to gardening last 
summer need not throw in the trowel; after all, our Southern California climate 
is perfect for year-round growing. A number of vegetables flourish in the 
cooler weather and shorter days that are upon us. 
</P>
<P>
And the Abundant Life Seed Foundation can help the cause, with seeds capable of 
producing a simple vegetable patch or a state-of-the-art garden -- by virtue of 
the firm's mail-order catalogue or its retail outlets in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Among the many vegetables that flourish this time of the year are lettuces such 
as Winter Marvel, All Year Round and Brune d'Hiver (Brown Winter); red orach 
and green orach, mountain spinaches; Oriental greens such as bok choy and 
Japanese mizuna; and others including scallions, carrots, parsley and basil. 
Equally perfect for fall and winter planting are Swiss chard, collards, corn 
salad (a European green resembling a midget lettuce), cress and kale. All of 
the seeds are fungicide-free and open-pollinated (non-hybrid), and many are 
grown organically. Abundant Life Foundation seeds also include herbs, small 
grains, trees, shrubs, flowers and edible seeds. 
</P>
<P>
The Foundation offers a large selection of books and cassettes on natural 
farming and operates the World Seed Fund, a program that provides free seeds to 
gardeners and farmers in developing nations. 
</P>
<P>
 For a catalogue, send $1 to Abundant Life Seed Foundation, P.O. Box 772, Port 
Townsend, Wash., 98368; (206) 385-5660. Seeds are sold locally at Armstrong's 
Building Materials, 11321 Pico Blvd., Los Angeles, (213) 477-8023; and at 
Co-opportunity, 1530 Broadway, Santa Monica, (213) 451-8902.

A TALE OF MURDER AMONG THE HARE KRISHNAS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE TRIAL OF A LIFELONG KRISHNA DEVOTEE ACCUSED OF ASSASSINATING AN 
EMBITTERED FORMER CULT MEMBER IN 1986 PROMISES A STORY OF TREACHERY AND 
ESPIONAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Among the spiritual leaders of Hare Krishna, embittered former member Stephen 
Bryant was considered a dangerous man. Outfitted with a rifle, a computer and a 
small bed, the 33-year-old Bryant traveled the country in his van, writing and 
preaching attacks on the Hindu religious sect. 
</P>
<P>
It was feared that the zealous Bryant might harm, even kill, the swamis who ran 
Hare Krishna temples in Moundsville, W. Va., and West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But late one night in 1986, death ended Bryant's crusade. While seated in his 
van only blocks from the West Los Angeles temple, he was shot twice in the head 
with a .45-caliber handgun. Police later arrested Thomas Drescher, now 42, a 
lifelong Krishna devotee who has acknowledged conducting a long odyssey of 
secret surveillance against Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
Drescher's murder trial, which resumes Monday in Van Nuys Superior Court, 
presents a tale of treachery and espionage that crisscrosses state lines, from 
tiny motels in Ohio to abandoned mine shafts in California's Apple Valley. The 
death penalty case also raises questions about the granting of immunity from 
prosecution because the three key witnesses against Drescher came forward only 
under protection from the law. 
</P>
<P>
One of those witnesses, defense attorneys claim, is the more likely killer, 
based on the scant evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"The prosecution has not only given immunity to the wrong person, but the wrong 
person is on trial and you should ask yourself why," defense attorney Madelynn 
Kopple told jurors this week in opening statements. "There may be a dead body 
and there may be a number of immunized witnesses. But what you don't have in 
this case . . . (are) eyewitnesses. 
</P>
<P>
"You will not see or hear anything about fingerprints in this case . . . or 
hear anything about hair samples, for example. You will not see a murder 
weapon. There was no murder weapon found." 
</P>
<P>
The case against Drescher is based largely on the detailed accounts of men who 
knew him during the weeks he tracked Bryant. Those witnesses -- including a 
onetime Krishna security guard in Los Angeles named Jeffrey Breier -- say 
Drescher carefully plotted Bryant's assassination and scouted the secluded mine 
shafts as a possible place to dump the body. 
</P>
<P>
It is alleged that Drescher was to receive $8,000 for killing Bryant in order 
to protect the swami Bahktipada, whose 4,000-acre site in West Virginia was one 
of the largest Hare Krishna temples in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
However, defense attorney Barry Levine said a witness who lived near the murder 
scene will testify to seeing a sports car speed away just after the shots were 
heard -- a car more similar to Breier's Alfa Romeo than to Drescher's rented 
four-door Chevrolet. 
</P>
<P>
Breier, who lived in a one-room apartment at the temple in West Los Angeles, 
was paid to protect the swami Rameswar, who was considered another possible 
target of Bryant's anger. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant had lived at the West Virginia temple for several years in the early 
1980s and blamed the Krishnas for the breakup of his marriage. He attracted 
publicity in West Virginia for his allegations that the temple there was 
involved in drug abuse and prostitution. And he later expanded his campaign to 
the temple in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Levine said gun records will be introduced to show that Breier owned three 
.45-caliber pistols. Yet when questioned by police who considered him a 
suspect, Breier turned over only one of the .45s, Levine said, telling 
detectives that at least one of the others had been stolen. 
</P>
<P>
"We can prove that Tom Drescher was not in L.A. at the time of the shooting," 
Levine said in an interview. But the defense attorney declined to specify where 
Drescher was or how soon he left town before the May 22, 1986, slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Those surprises, he said, will be unveiled as the trial unfolds. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Sterling Norris downplayed the defense evidence and 
characterized the claims of wrongful immunity as a "common defense strategy." 
</P>
<P>
"We feel very confident from our evidence that Breier is not the killer," 
Norris said. "We had a substantial case on Drescher before we ever arrived at 
the point of granting immunity to Breier. Breier was just a piece of the 
puzzle." 
</P>
<P>
Norris said one key witness against Drescher will be a former West Virginia 
steelworker named Randall Gorby, who testified at length under immunity during 
a 1989 preliminary hearing and later committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Gorby, whose earlier testimony will be read to the jury, was not a Hare Krishna 
but was closely associated with the temple in West Virginia. Defense attorneys, 
citing his suicide, questioned Gorby's reliability and called him an "emotional 
and psychiatric misfit in this world." 
</P>
<P>
Gorby testified that he had known Drescher since 1983. Drescher, once a 
spiritual master at the West Virginia temple -- his Krishna name was Tirtha 
Swami -- had called Gorby in 1986 to ask a favor: Would he travel to a small 
motel near his home in Ohio to help find Bryant? After doing so, Gorby was met 
at the motel by Drescher and another Krishna. 
</P>
<P>
"They explained to me . . . that they had been trailing him," Gorby testified. 
</P>
<P>
In separate cars, Gorby said, the three men followed Bryant to Wheeling, W. 
Va., where Bryant stepped into a building housing FBI offices. As Gorby waited 
outside in his car, Drescher walked over and joined him. 
</P>
<P>
"(Drescher) said: 'That son of a bitch is going to the police and he is going 
to have to be killed, and I am the one that is going to do it,' " Gorby said. 
"I did not want that type of activity . . . on my conscience," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorby did not notify authorities but said he tried to prevent a killing by 
having Bryant arrested for making threats against the Hare Krishna. That night, 
police arrested Bryant after finding him with a loaded .45-caliber gun. He was 
convicted of illegal gun possession and spent several weeks in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Drescher showed up in West Los Angeles, according to Breier. "He 
said that he was tracking (Bryant) for a long time and that he wanted to kill 
him," Breier recalled. "He was looking for help." 
</P>
<P>
Breier said he agreed to watch for Bryant in Los Angeles and accompanied 
Drescher to Apple Valley to look at boarded-up mine shafts as a possible burial 
place. 
</P>
<P>
On May 17, after Bryant's release from jail, Gorby got a call from Drescher, 
who was traveling to West Virginia. According to Gorby, Drescher was on his way 
to pick up $2,500 from a man at the temple. 
</P>
<P>
"(Drescher) told two different stories at that time about the $2,500," Gorby 
said in his testimony. "One, the original story, was that it was (for) ongoing 
expenses that had been incurred in the trailing of Stephen Bryant. And then he 
said it was a partial payment of $8,000 that had been negotiated sometime 
previously with members of the community for killing Stephen Bryant." 
</P>
<P>
Gorby said he tried to talk Drescher out of the killing -- successfully, he 
thought. But a new development interceded: Breier spotted Bryant's van in Los 
Angeles. Word was relayed to Drescher. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, Drescher was in Los Angeles asking to see the van. Breier said 
he met Drescher and they traveled in separate cars to a neighborhood near 
Venice Boulevard and the Santa Monica Freeway, where they met near the van. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Drescher) was putting bullets into the (gun)," Breier said. "I thought 
maybe that was for his protection because . . . the speculation among ourselves 
was that (Bryant) had a gun also." 
</P>
<P>
Breier said he left the scene about 9 p.m. because he was due to start his 
night shift at the temple. Witnesses reported hearing shots soon after 
midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Gorby said he heard from Drescher after the shooting. The two met near 
Youngstown, Ohio. "Tom said he had flown to California, that he had decided to 
go ahead and kill Bryant," Gorby said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorby said he tipped authorities. But he implicated Drescher not only in 
Bryant's murder; he also named Drescher in the 1983 killing of former Krishna 
member Charles St. Denis, who had been shot and stabbed. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia state police arrested Drescher on May 27 -- five days after 
Bryant's murder. The arrest, however, was for the death of St. Denis. 
</P>
<P>
The Bryant investigation was continuing. Gorby was to meet again with police on 
May 28 to provide further information. That morning, as Gorby stepped out of 
bed, an explosion devastated his home. 
</P>
<P>
"I . . . started to light a cigarette and my home totally disappeared," Gorby 
said later. "It was leveled to the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Gorby spent more than a month in a coma. Even so, charges were filed against 
Drescher in the Bryant murder, and an accused accomplice in the St. Denis 
killing agreed to testify under immunity. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, Drescher was sentenced to life without parole in a West Virginia 
prison for murdering St. Denis. Defense attorney Levine declined to discuss 
details of that case except to call the trial a "kangaroo court." 
</P>
<P>
"What they really did," Levine said, "was to use the St. Denis arrest as a ruse 
to get (Drescher) into custody for the Bryant killing." Authorities were afraid 
he would flee the country. 
</P>
<P>
According to defense lawyers, Breier had as much motive as Drescher for killing 
Bryant because of his role in protecting the West Los Angeles swami Rameswar. 
If Breier is innocent, Levine asked, then why was a sports car similar to his 
seen speeding from the neighborhood? 
</P>
<P>
In testimony at the preliminary hearing, Breier conceded being in the 
neighborhood, Levine said. But he claimed he was only curious about the crime. 
"He was afraid that somebody saw him. . . . (He) had to account for his vehicle 
being seen."

CHILDREN SAVED FROM HOME BLAZE BY 7 HEROES; 
</P>
<P>
FIRE: YOUNG PARTY-GOERS AT A HOUSE NEXT DOOR RISK THEIR OWN LIVES TO RESCUE A 
FAMILY OF SIX TRAPPED INSIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Seven young men were hailed as heroes Saturday after they dashed into a burning 
house in Hacienda Heights and rescued a family of six from the flames, 
including a girl with cerebral palsy who was confined to a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters arrived at the scene to find the men battling the blaze with 
garden hoses, the mother and children they had rescued wandering dazed in their 
back yard, and the girl crying in her wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
The rescuers suffered from smoke inhalation and cuts, and they were taken to 
nearby hospitals for treatment and then released. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt that the family would have died if they had been in there five 
or 10 more minutes," said Los Angeles County Battalion Chief Bill Miles. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which began shortly before 1 a.m. in the 16000 block of Sigman 
Avenue, was caused by an electrical short in the bedroom of one of the 
residents, who had tacked extension cords and wires for several aquariums and 
clocks to the wall, Miles said. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 young people celebrating a girl's 18th birthday next door were dancing 
when Catherine Guillen, the mother of three children caught in the blaze, ran 
up screaming: "My kids! My kids!" Smoke was billowing out of her house. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Torrez, 19, jumped the 4-foot wall between his house and the one on fire, 
wet himself down with a garden hose, covered his face with his shirt and ran 
into the house with the hose. "All I could think of were the kids," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, another party-goer, Andrew Gonzales, entered the burning 
house searching for the children. "You could just hear people choking," said 
the 19-year-old supermarket clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Martinez, a 25-year-old mover, broke a window, climbed in and grabbed 
one girl who, he said, was "running around from one side of the room to the 
other, screaming." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Madden, 21, and Richard Scaggs, 20, ran to the back of the house, where 
they could hear the girl in the wheelchair sobbing: "Mama! Help!" 
</P>
<P>
Scaggs threw a potted plant through the window and climbed inside. Finally, he 
groped in the smoke until he found the girl and handed her out the window to 
Madden. 
</P>
<P>
By the time firefighters arrived, the blaze was nearly out. "We got them all 
out," Scaggs told Chief Miles, and then collapsed, overcome by smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters identified two other rescuers as Leo Guillen, 17, a brother of the 
victims, and Lewis Cebellos, 18, who had also been at the party. 
</P>
<P>
The family is being sheltered by the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday afternoon, family members returned to the charred house to pick 
through their possessions. All that was left, Miles said, was a melted second 
wheelchair the family had just purchased for the 12-year-old. The fire caused 
$75,000 in damage, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said the Guillen family had lived in the area for about a year. The 
family's father is in Mexico City on business, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Late Saturday, most of the young men were home sleeping. That was when the fear 
caught up to them, they said. "Check it out! I'm a hero!" Gonzalez told his 
mother. But his knees were shaking, he said.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS PROPOSITIONS 128 AND 135; 
</P>
<P>
FARMERS TRY TO HARVEST VOTES FOR 'BIG GREEN' RIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Bearing flowers, almonds and chocolate-covered raisins as gifts for voters, 
hundreds of farmers campaigned door-to-door in the San Fernando Valley Saturday 
for Proposition 135, a rival to the environmentalist-backed "Big Green" 
initiative on the Nov. 6 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
About 600 farmers and family members arrived on buses from El Centro, Visalia, 
Coachella and other Central Valley and Southern California farm towns to walk 
Valley neighborhoods in what organizers said was the largest such event ever 
staged by California farmers. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, my name's Chris McLain and I'm a farmer from the Central Valley and a 
group of us came to Van Nuys today to urge you to vote for Proposition 135," 
said McLain, a plaid-shirted Visalia orange grower, as he handed a rose to one 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
"No on proposition who?" asked the woman. "You have to read all these ballot 
things, and let me tell you, you just get more confused." 
</P>
<P>
While the farmers walked Valley neighborhoods, about 60 children and their 
parents gathered outside the Children's Museum in downtown Los Angeles for a 
rally in support of the environmental initiative, Proposition 128. Folk songs, 
including one titled "Toxic Wasteland," were sung while youngsters held 
placards bearing slogans such as "Do Not Intoxicate Me, I Am the Future." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the purpose . . . is to remind people that the issue is the children's 
health," said Harvey Karp, a Santa Monica pediatrician who entertained the 
children while draped in a huge piece of green cloth meant to represent Big 
Green, the proposition's nickname. 
</P>
<P>
The contrasting campaigns came just nine days before Election Day and at a time 
when The Times Poll showed voters almost evenly split over the ambitious 
Proposition 128. The poll found 44% against, 42% in favor and 14% undecided. 
That is considered a statistical tie, with a margin of error of 3 percentage 
points in either direction. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 135 would double testing for pesticide residues on fresh fruit and 
vegetables. It also would double production of sterile Mediterranean fruit 
flies and boost scientific research into alternatives to malathion spraying for 
Medfly eradication. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents say it is a sensible alternative to the sweeping environmental 
measure. Among other things, Proposition 128 would phase out cancer-causing 
pesticides and require California to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by as 
much as 40%. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers say a pesticide phase-out could badly damage California agriculture, 
pushing up domestic food prices and hurting farmers' ability to compete in 
world markets. But backers of Proposition 128 argue that the farmer-supported 
alternative was placed on the ballot by the pesticide industry, and will weaken 
pesticide restrictions and lead to more contamination of food and water. 
</P>
<P>
Yesterday's drive by farmers marked the second time this month they have fanned 
out in suburban areas to campaign for 135. Last Saturday, about 600 of them 
buttonholed residents of Concord in Contra Costa County east of San Francisco, 
said Yes on 135 spokesman Robert Padgett. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers said farmers were brought into the Valley to capitalize on their 
homespun appeal with voters identified as likely to go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
"Farmers have a lot of credibility with the American public, notwithstanding 
the fact that the news media likes to put the label of agribusiness on them," 
said Rob Roy, president of the Ventura County Agriculture Assn., a trade group 
representing more than 100 farm-related companies. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers said they used the same tactic successfully in 1976 to defeat 
Proposition 14, which was backed by the United Farm Workers union and sought to 
give union organizers the right to campaign on growers' property. 
</P>
<P>
But proponents of Proposition 128 dismissed the farmers' canvass as a public 
relations stunt aimed at disguising Proposition 135's financial backers. 
</P>
<P>
"The chemical companies put 135 on the ballot to kill Big Green. So hiding 
behind some farmers is a clever tactic to hide the true identity of who's 
behind the pesticide initiative," said campaign spokesman Duane Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
Farmer organizers said they hoped to contact 200,000 residents in Van Nuys, 
Canoga Park, Northridge and other West Valley communities during the three-hour 
sweep. Although many residents weren't home, others were willing to listen to a 
pitch for 135 in exchange for a rose from someone as wholesome-looking as 
McLain.

BLACK COLLEGES EXPERIENCE A 'RENAISSANCE'; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: A SEPULVEDA COMPANY HAS TAKEN NEARLY 100 PROSPECTS FROM SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOLS ON GET-ACQUAINTED TOURS OF CAMPUSES. 
</P>

As the time approached for Ayanna Woodard to graduate from high school, the 
17-year-old spent her time like many other seniors: poring over brochures and 
touring schools in search of a college that would fit her needs. 
</P>
<P>
She was concerned about the cost of tuition, distance from her home in Sylmar 
and the college's size. But Ayanna also wanted to find a college that would 
fill a void in her high school education, which she said failed to recognize 
the contributions of African-Americans in science, literature, history and 
every other area of study. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time you finish high school all you know about is slavery, how we got 
chased off our land and stuck here," the Kennedy High School graduate said. 
"They don't teach you about your background at all -- you have to go home to 
your black colleges for that." 
</P>
<P>
For Ayanna, 18, home is now Tuskegee Institute, a black college in Tuskegee 
Institute, Ala., thanks in part to a business in Sepulveda that takes 
prospective students on tours of black colleges. 
</P>
<P>
While the percentage of African-Americans attending college has plummeted over 
the past decade, enrollments at many of the nation's 104 historically black 
colleges and universities are on the rise, creating what Christopher F. Edley, 
United Negro College Fund president and chief executive officer, called a black 
college "renaissance." 
</P>
<P>
The factors fueling the renaissance vary from lower tuition costs to a concern 
about racial incidents on predominantly white colleges. Whatever the reason, 
some view the trend as a positive step for African-American students. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in these schools," said Yasmin Delahoussaye, who with her husband, 
Greg, runs Educational Student Tours in Sepulveda. "The sense of warmth, the 
sense of belonging, the sense of history and heritage is what's attracting 
students to black colleges. It makes all the difference in the world." 
</P>
<P>
In her search for a college, Ayanna and her parents consulted the 
Delahoussayes. Believed to be the only service of its kind in Southern 
California, EST introduces students to traditionally black colleges through 
consultations and visits to campuses. 
</P>
<P>
Started last year, EST has already taken nearly 100 students on tours of 
schools such as Howard University in Washington, Morehouse College in Atlanta 
and Hampton University in Hampton, Va. For about $700, which includes air fare, 
room and board, the students tour for five to six days, visiting the schools 
and talking to students and faculty. 
</P>
<P>
TaRessa Stone Stovall, a spokeswoman for Spelman College in Atlanta, said 
businesses such as EST have helped black colleges and universities increase 
students' awareness of the schools. 
</P>
<P>
"While we work hard . . . you can never truly do enough. We appreciate the work 
of others who are helping to get the word out about all historically black 
colleges and universities," she said. Stovall said the tours also point out the 
diversity among the campuses. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not a homogenous and predictable group," Stovall said. 
</P>
<P>
The tours can be a deciding factor for some students, said J.J. Johnson, a 
spokesman for Tuskegee Institute who has worked with the Delahoussayes. "We 
like what they are doing and we hope they continue doing it," he said of the 
couple's service. 
</P>
<P>
Jeri Holden, a guidance counselor at Kennedy High in Granada Hills, has had 
four students take tours with the Delahoussayes. Holden said the tours helped 
fill a void and inspired the students to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a lot of information available about the schools," Holden said. 
Those students who went on the tours not only learned about the different 
campuses, but also came back believing that college was an attainable goal for 
them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"So many of them don't allow themselves to dream about going to college" 
because they don't know anyone who has ever gone, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Delahoussayes opened their business at a time of both promise and despair 
for black students in higher education. 
</P>
<P>
According to the American Council on Education's Eighth Annual Status Report on 
Minorities in Higher Education, the percentage of low-income black high school 
graduates going to college plummeted from 40% to 30% between 1976 and 1988, and 
the enrollment rate for middle-income blacks fell from 53% to 36%. 
</P>
<P>
Those trends have widened the gap between white and black college attendance 
rates. Even so, enrollment at some black colleges is up. 
</P>
<P>
The United Negro College Fund reports that applications are up at two-thirds of 
the 41 UNCF institutions. Between 1986 and 1989, enrollment at the schools 
increased 13%. 
</P>
<P>
Franklyn G. Jenifer, president of Howard University -- known as the Mecca of 
black higher education -- said the rise was the result of events in the 
mid-1980s that made life uncomfortable for black students at predominantly 
white institutions. 
</P>
<P>
During the Reagan Administration the amount of federal grant money declined 
drastically, while the cost of college tuitions increased, Jenifer said. There 
has also been a backlash against affirmative action programs and their 
perceived beneficiaries and an increase of racial incidents on predominantly 
white college campuses. 
</P>
<P>
"The students' discomfort has led to a migration back to black colleges where 
the environment is perceived to be more wholesome and welcoming," Jenifer said, 
adding that the relatively low cost of the schools was also a major factor. 
</P>
<P>
The average cost of the 41 UNCF institutions is 38% less than for comparable 
private colleges in the South and is about half as much as is charged by 
private four-year colleges nationally. 
</P>
<P>
After going on a tour with the Delahoussayes, Ayanna won a scholarship to 
Tuskegee. She was attracted, she said, to the small classes, the homey feel of 
the campus town and the history of the institute -- once home to noted 
scientist George Washington Carver and scholar Booker T. Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"You walk around the campus and you feel proud," Ayanna said. 
</P>
<P>
The Delahoussayes said that many other students would feel the same pride and 
enthusiasm as Ayanna about such schools. But in California, where there are no 
black colleges, few students even know the schools exist. 
</P>
<P>
"Students don't know about these schools because high school counselors don't 
even know," said Yasmin Delahoussaye. "And that's sad." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the students are inspired by their first visit to a black college. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been in an environment like that," said 16-year-old Eryn Houston of 
El Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills. "You know when they say 
brotherhood? It was like that." 
</P>
<P>
Yasmin Delahoussaye was a junior high and high school teacher and counselor in 
the San Fernando Valley for nearly 15 years and now is a college counselor at 
Pierce College. She stresses the value of providing students with role models 
-- something she said black colleges can provide. 
</P>
<P>
"To stand on James Brawley Drive in Atlanta at 12 noon, where you can see 
thousands of African-American students from Morehouse, Spelman and Clark is 
just amazing," Delahoussaye said. "These kids need to see that." 
</P>
<P>
So far, EST has attracted students from all over Los Angeles. Gregory 
Delahoussaye, who teaches at the Sherman Oaks Center for Enriched Studies, said 
some of the students who have taken the tours have returned with a new-found 
interest in higher education. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the business has gotten help from two unlikely sources. 
</P>
<P>
The NBC sitcom "A Different World," set at a black college, has helped spark 
interest in the schools. And last month, nearly 50,000 people turned out to see 
two historically black schools -- Howard University and Southern University of 
Baton Rouge, La. -- square off at the Los Angeles Coliseum in a game sponsored 
by the Los Angeles Football Classic Foundation. In addition, thousands attended 
a parade, college fair and concert also held during the second annual "Classic 
Week." 
</P>
<P>
"It's more than a football game," said Foundation President Fred Cooper, an 
alumnus of Grambling State University in Grambling, La. Cooper said the event 
raises funds for the schools and gives the community an opportunity to learn 
about the history of the institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have argued that black colleges lack the resources of predominantly 
white institutions, which may jeopardize the education students receive. Some 
have been plagued with financial problems taking them to the brink of closing. 
In 1988, Bishop College in Dallas closed after losing its accreditation two 
years earlier, and just last year another small college, Morristown College in 
Morristown, Tenn., closed its doors. 
</P>
<P>
Black college officials are all too familiar with such arguments. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the case that many black institutions don't have the same resources as 
the majority institutions," Johnson said. But, he said, "That's one of the 
strengths of the black colleges -- to take what's available and make the best 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the historically black schools were established after the Civil War by 
churches and other institutions to educate freed slaves. The institutions 
became the primary educators of African-Americans in this country, graduating 
such influential African-American figures as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and 
author Ralph Ellison. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1960s, 80% of all black graduates holding bachelor of arts degrees 
had earned them at a black college or university. When the civil rights 
movement eventually forced open the doors of predominantly white institutions, 
black student enrollment at white institutions gradually increased. Today, 83% 
of black students attend white institutions, according to the American Council 
on Education. 
</P>
<P>
But that appears to be changing. 
</P>
<P>
"The feeling is that they're just more comfortable here," said Johnson of 
Tuskegee Institute, explaining the increase. 
</P>
<P>
"That comfort translates into better academic performance. The black student at 
the black college can invest his energy in bringing out the best of his 
abilities. . . . Energy is not devoted to proving oneself because of one's skin 
color." 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen-year-old Chionesu "Cho" Wells graduated this spring from Polytechnic 
School, a private elementary and high school in Pasadena, with a Scholastic 
Aptitude Test score of 1200, which would have qualified him for admission to 
some of the nation's most selective schools. But because he and his sisters had 
been virtually the only black students in most of their classes, Wells wanted a 
different college experience. 
</P>
<P>
He applied to six colleges -- all historically black institutions -- and won a 
scholarship to attend Hampton University. 
</P>
<P>
"All my life I've gone to predominantly Caucasian schools. I didn't really like 
that too much," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wells, who plans to major in engineering, said he expects to have a different 
rapport with both professors and students at Hampton. "We're coming from the 
same background so I think they'll understand me more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For the parents of black students, the schools alleviate at least some of the 
fears that are associated with sending a child away to college for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of anything I would rather have her do than go to a black 
college," said Dwan Smith-Fortier, Ayanna's mother. "I think her chances of 
matriculating . . . of meeting an appropriate mate . . . and . . . of setting 
up a network of lifelong friends are all better at a black college." 
</P>
<P>
Anna and James Wesley of West Covina sent their daughter Anja on a college tour 
with the Delahoussayes earlier this year and have encouraged her to apply to a 
black university. Both graduates of Florida A&amp;M University in Tallahassee, 
the Wesleys say success is a collective effort at black colleges. 
</P>
<P>
"People aren't going to let you fail at a black college," Anna Wesley said. 
"They're going to push you to do your best."

ANTI-INCUMBENT PROTESTERS CALL FOR 'CLEAN SWEEP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carrying brooms adorned with signs calling for a "clean sweep" of elected 
officials, a divergent handful of protesters united by dissatisfaction with 
government mismanagement and deficit spending picketed Saturday outside the San 
Fernando Valley office of Rep. Howard L. Berman. 
</P>
<P>
The causes championed by the 20 or so protesters at the "anti-Washington" rally 
included overhauling the tax system, establishing a national health-care system 
and limiting elected officials to two terms. 
</P>
<P>
Political analysts and polls in recent months have detected a growing unease 
among citizens about the way Congress and President Bush have handled the 
nation's budget crisis and the various tax hike proposals that have been 
floated. Those and other issues seem to be fueling state and national sentiment 
against incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
Belle Palmer, president of the Sherman Oaks political group Seniors for Action, 
said Berman's office was targeted because her organization believes that the 
congressman has not been responsive to their needs. "We've had a lot of 
problems with him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Berman (D-Panorama City), who is expected to easily win reelection Nov. 
6, nor anyone from his office could be reached for comment on the protest. 
</P>
<P>
Similar rallies were held Saturday outside the federal building in Westwood and 
at other federal offices nationwide, Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
Taxpayers Action Day, as it was dubbed, was aimed specifically at federal 
officials, but some of those at the rally across the street from the Panorama 
City Mall said they wouldn't mind seeing nearly all incumbent officials -- from 
City Hall on up -- voted out of office the next time they run for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to sweep the whole country if we can," Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how anyone can be satisfied with our government right now," 
Sepulveda resident Sid Muskin said. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone at the rally found something to be unhappy about. 
</P>
<P>
Some decried the condition of the health-care system and called for the 
creation of a federally funded national health service. Others criticized 
politicians for being beholden to special interest groups and urged the setting 
of limits on the number of terms an elected official can serve. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the tradition of tithing, Woodland Hills resident Renee Sphar 
griped about high taxes, saying, "If 10% is good enough for God, it's good 
enough for the government." 
</P>
<P>
So it would seem that Bernard Zimring, the Libertarian candidate opposing 
Berman, would have found an audience in this crowd. But when he tried to spread 
the Libertarian doctrine of absolutely no income taxes, his words fell on 
shocked ears. 
</P>
<P>
"But how will we pay for the government?" one woman asked, her face aghast at 
the idea, before rejoining the picketers with her broom.

SURVIVORS RECAPTURE LOST CHILDHOODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At an age when many Jewish girls are preparing for their bat mitzvah, Gabriele 
Silten was stealing cabbage to survive in a Nazi concentration camp. 
</P>
<P>
Rita Lurie was wasting away on a diet of raw potatoes and onions in a dark 
attic in Poland where her family was hiding. 
</P>
<P>
Trudy Hill was watching an SS guard drown a woman in a latrine. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, they and four other women in their 50s celebrated surviving the 
Holocaust by participating in the bat mitzvah ritual, which ordinarily marks a 
13-year-old girl's symbolic entry into the Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
"We missed out on so much when we were children," said Lurie, 53, of North 
Hollywood, whose mother and younger brother perished during the family's ordeal 
in the attic. "This is a chance for us to undo that a little." 
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony at Temple Adat Ari El in North Hollywood, the seven women chanted 
Hebrew prayers and made speeches in English with such feeling that many of the 
more than 600 people gathered in the synagogue laughed and cried along with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"Hitler must be turning over in his grave at this celebration of being alive in 
spite of being Jewish," said Hill, 56, of West Hollywood, who watched the 
drowning and other atrocities while a prisoner at the Auschwitz concentration 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
The women conceived the idea of participating in the ceremony during a 
convention of Holocaust survivors about two years ago, said Natalie Gold, 50, 
of West Hollywood. One night, nearly 50 pajama-clad men and women spontaneously 
gathered in her hotel room during the convention and held an impromptu slumber 
party. 
</P>
<P>
For Gold, whose mother disappeared forever after abandoning her in front of a 
Polish police station to save her life, the slumber party was a rare 
opportunity to be playfully childlike. Gold was brought up in a convent with 
strict rules until the end of the war when her father reclaimed her. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to recapture our childhoods," she said, explaining why the women chose 
to participate in the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
For the past year and a half, with the support of psychologist Sarah Moscowitz 
and temple officials, the women met monthly to practice. Saturday, their 
closeness was evident in the many hugs they exchanged during the 1 1/2-hour 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Freda Gleitman of Beverly Hills was forced by Nazis to work in ammunition 
factories and laundries when she was 12 years old. She never saw her family 
again because they were exterminated in a gas chamber. Saturday, she said the 
group of seven women was like a family to her. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like we're saying, 'Here we are, you Nazis did not succeed,' " she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Silten, 57, of Pomona, who stole from the Nazis to survive in the concentration 
camps of Westerbork and Theresienstadt, said the ceremony was "the start of a 
second life as a Jew, like coming back to my people." The only child of a 
pharmacist in her native Holland, Silten paid dearly for being Jewish in the 
camps, where she was forced at age 11 to help dispose of cardboard boxes 
containing the ashes and bones of Jews who died in the gas chambers. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony also represented a renewal of faith for Hannah Kagan, 52, of West 
Hills and Gitta Ginsberg, 53, of North Hollywood. Kagan's family was forced 
into hiding, and she is still so haunted by the experience that she prefers not 
to talk much about it. But she said she feels she has come full circle. 
</P>
<P>
"I was brought up Orthodox, and these are not just words to me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ginsberg was thrown by Nazis into a dark basement where she spent endless, 
terrified days alone before being brought to a convent. Even before the 
experience in the cellar, she had pretended to be Christian in order to 
survive. For her, the ceremony was the expiation of the guilt she felt at being 
baptized, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gold said the women are hoping to relive other experiences they missed while 
growing up, either because the Holocaust was occurring or because they were so 
traumatized in the aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about having a senior prom," she said with a smile. 
</P>

QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS; 
</P>
<P>
SENATE: 20TH DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Questionnaires were distributed to candidates this month. Answers have been 
edited to fit the available space. 
</P>
<P>
Family Sick Leave 
</P>
<P>
Q. Gov. Deukmejian recently vetoed legislation that would have granted workers 
as much as four months of unpaid leave every two years to care for sick 
children, spouses and other family members without fear of losing their jobs. 
Do you favor this type of legislation? 
</P>
<P>
Robbins: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Podegracz: No. It would place an unfair burden on the employers of the state. 
</P>
<P>
Merkin: No. This is unwarranted intrusion into affairs that do not concern the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Teacher Salaries 
</P>
<P>
Q. The Legislature approved a 4.7% cost-of-living raise for school employees, 
and Gov. Deukmejian reduced it to 3%, placing the difference in an account for 
special education programs. Should this money be used for salaries? 
</P>
<P>
Robbins: No. Fund the salaries, but from other educational fund sources. 
</P>
<P>
Podegracz: No. The governor acted correctly in adjusting this cost-of-living 
raise. 
</P>
<P>
Merkin: No. Based on recent test results, school employees are already 
overpaid. The money should be returned to the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Big Green 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 128, the so-called "Big Green" initiative on the November 
ballot, seeks to eliminate ozone-depleting chemicals by the year 2000, phase 
out pesticides known to cause cancer and require that trees be planted in all 
new developments. Do you support this initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Robbins: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Podegracz: No. As it is written, it is an abuse of the initiative process. The 
projected costs to California taxpayers are prohibitive, and they don't even 
begin to consider what it will cost us in business being forced to relocate 
outside the state. 
</P>
<P>
Merkin: No. I support protection of the environment. A new, costly bureaucracy 
is the exact wrong way to accomplish this. 
</P>
<P>
Tree-Cutting 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 130 on the November ballot would restrict clear-cutting of 
forests, allow the sale of $710 million in bonds to preserve ancient redwood 
forests and provide $32 million to retrain unemployed loggers. Do you support 
this initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Robbins: No position. 
</P>
<P>
Podegracz: No. 
</P>
<P>
Merkin: No. 
</P>
<P>
Limited Terms 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 131 on the November ballot, authored by Atty. Gen. John K. Van 
de Kamp and Common Cause, would limit most statewide elected officials to eight 
consecutive years in office, and senators and Assembly members to 12 years. 
Proposition 140, sponsored by Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum, is 
more stringent, limiting lifetime service to eight years in the Senate and six 
in the Assembly. Do you support limiting the number of terms state legislators 
can serve? If yes, how long should the limits be? 
</P>
<P>
Robbins: No. 
</P>
<P>
Podegracz: No. Voters should be able to vote for whomever they desire to 
represent them. Arbitrary limits on terms deprives them of this right. 
</P>
<P>
Merkin: Yes on 140. Assembly three terms and Senate two terms. This proposition 
was co-sponsored by Mike Ford, a Libertarian from Marin County. 
</P>
<P>
Sales Tax 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 133 on the November ballot would raise state sales and use taxes 
by 0.5% for four years to raise $7.5 billion for drug enforcement and 
treatment, anti-drug education, and prison and jail construction and operation. 
Do you support this initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Robbins: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Podegracz: No. The passage of this initiative would increase the sales tax paid 
by voters in my district to 7.25%. 
</P>
<P>
Merkin: No. Taxes are too high. Four years is baloney. More jails for 
victimless crimes is absurd. 
</P>
<P>
Liquor Tax 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 134 on the November ballot would substantially raise taxes on 
beer, wine and liquor, and dedicate the revenue from the tax hike to programs 
for the treatment of drug and alcohol abuse. Do you support this initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Robbins: No position. 
</P>
<P>
Podegracz: Absolutely not. 
</P>
<P>
Merkin: No. No to higher taxes period. 
</P>
<P>
Inmate Laborers 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 139 on the November ballot would allow private companies to hire 
state prison and county jail inmates as laborers. Do you support this 
initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Robbins: No. 
</P>
<P>
Podegracz: Yes, based on the information I have at hand. 
</P>
<P>
Merkin: No. It's a good basic idea, but this proposition is flawed. It dictates 
wages paid etc. 
</P>
<P>
Death Penalty 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support capital punishment? If so, do you think it should be imposed 
on those convicted of importing or selling drugs? 
</P>
<P>
Robbins: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Podegracz: I do support capital punishment, but I cannot see my way clear to 
accept it as an appropriate punishment for involvement in the drug trade, 
regardless of how reprehensible this involvement may be. 
</P>
<P>
Merkin: Yes. No, for those convicted of importing or selling drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Handgun Controls 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support additional limits on handgun purchase or possession in 
California? 
</P>
<P>
Robbins: No. 
</P>
<P>
Podegracz: No. 
</P>
<P>
Merkin: No. I favor removing all limits on handgun ownership, especially 
military-style weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion Rights 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support a woman's right to unrestricted abortion within the first 
three months of pregnancy? 
</P>
<P>
Robbins: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Podegracz: No. While I defend the individual rights of privacy, I am resolutely 
opposed to any mother depriving her child of life, liberty and the pursuit of 
happiness without due process. 
</P>
<P>
Merkin: Yes. I support unrestricted abortion any time, no exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion Funding 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support government funding of abortions for women who cannot afford 
them? 
</P>
<P>
Robbins: Yes, subject to normal budgetary restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Podegracz: No. Never. 
</P>
<P>
Merkin: No. I prefer private, charitable funding. Abortion is none of the 
government's business. 
</P>
<P>
Day-Care Services 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you believe the state should require private employers to subsidize 
day-care services for employees who request them? 
</P>
<P>
Robbins: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Podegracz: No. Passage of a law requiring employers to subsidize day-care 
services for employees would place an unsupportable burden on the backs of 
businesses in California. 
</P>
<P>
Merkin: No. "Require" is the problem. "Encourage," yes; "provide tax credits 
for," yes. Force is un-American. 
</P>
<P>
War on Drugs 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you believe our present strategy of criminal prosecution, interdiction of 
supplies and imprisonment of users and dealers will ever significantly reduce 
the level of drug use in the United States? If no, what should be done? 
</P>
<P>
Robbins: Yes. More rehabilitation programs, free or low-cost rehabilitation and 
drug education are needed. 
</P>
<P>
Podegracz: Yes. Even though I do not support the death penalty for those 
involved in the drug trade, I do see this fight as our civilization's moral 
equivalent of war. 
</P>
<P>
Merkin: No. Have we learned nothing from the Volstead Act? These encourage 
crime and ever-escalating drug abuse problems; to wit, designer drugs. Legal 
drugs are less potent drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Oil Exploration 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think the present Mideast crisis justifies opening up additional 
parts of the California coastline to oil exploration? 
</P>
<P>
Robbins: No. 
</P>
<P>
Podegracz: While the beautiful coast of our state needs to be protected, I 
think we need to consider developing safe ways of exploiting any oil reserves 
available to us. I think this is true in any case, not only because of the 
developments in the Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
Merkin: No. Inexpensive oil has a cost. We cannot ignore the possibility that 
we may have to increase exploration. Mideast supplies are problematic. 
</P>
<P>
Parkland Exchange 
</P>
<P>
Q. Should the National Park Service exchange 50 acres in Cheeseboro Canyon in 
southeastern Ventura County for about 1,100 acres of the neighboring Jordan 
Ranch owned by entertainer Bob Hope, permitting park agencies to buy another 
4,600 acres of Hope's land in the Santa Monica and Santa Susana mountains for 
$10 million? 
</P>
<P>
Robbins: No position. 
</P>
<P>
Podegracz: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Merkin: No. 
</P>
<P>
Mandatory Ride-Sharing 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you favor mandatory ride-sharing in an effort to meet government air 
pollution standards? 
</P>
<P>
Robbins: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Podegracz: No. Mandatory ride-sharing would be an insupportable intrusion of 
the government in private lives. Alternatives for fighting air pollution need 
to be attractive enough to consumers so they will elect to use them 
voluntarily, for their good and the good of others. 
</P>
<P>
Merkin: No. Mandatory is too dictatorial. 
</P>
<P>
Income Disclosure 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are you willing to publicly release your income tax returns and those of 
your spouse prior to the November election? 
</P>
<P>
Robbins: No. 
</P>
<P>
Podegracz: Sure. 
</P>
<P>
Merkin: Since the income tax was never properly ratified and is thus illegal, 
why should I? 
</P>
<P>
Porter Ranch 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support development of the massive Porter Ranch project in the hills 
north of Chatsworth as presently configured? 
</P>
<P>
Robbins: No position. This is not a state issue and it is not in my Senate 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Podegracz: Yes. Based on my observations, I think this project, while being 
opposed by local homeowners, would benefit the whole of the central Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Merkin: No more development, period.l 
</P>
<P>

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: YOUTHS ATTACK DRIVER OUTSIDE RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Clarita man was knocked unconscious and beaten Friday night by a gang 
of teen-agers who jumped in front of his car as he drove through a restaurant 
parking lot, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Two suspects were arrested, but two others were still being sought Saturday, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Leff, 41, was driving through the parking lot of the Denny's restaurant 
at 18920 Soledad Canyon Road about 10:30 p.m. Friday when four teen-agers ran 
in front of his car. When Leff stepped out of his car to yell at them, "he was 
quickly set upon," said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Don Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told deputies that one of the four hit Leff with a small bat, 
knocking him unconscious. The four then kicked and punched Leff in the head and 
body until an unidentified bystander chased them away, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
A sheriff's sergeant patrolling nearby responded to a radio call and arrested 
Tan Nguyen, 19, of Woodland Hills and a 17-year-old, also of Woodland Hills, on 
suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon. Nguyen was being held Saturday in 
lieu of $5,000 bail. The 17-year-old, whose name was not released because of 
his age, was released to his parents. 
</P>
<P>
Leff was taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital, where he was treated 
for injuries to his head and face and released.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN DIES WHEN CAR HITS UTILITY POLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One man was killed and two others injured early Saturday when their car spun 
out of control and struck a utility pole in San Fernando, knocking out power in 
the surrounding area for about four hours, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Soto Garcia, 22, of Arleta was driving east on Glenoaks Boulevard near 
Orange Grove Avenue about 12:30 a.m. when his car spun into a power pole and 
skidded about 200 feet before stopping in an empty lot on Huntington Street, 
San Fernando Police Lt. Dan Peavy said. 
</P>

Garcia, a sailor assigned to the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk, was declared dead 
at the scene about 15 minutes after the collision.

<P>
Passengers Jose Luis Rodriguez, 22, of Encino and Jaime Avila Delgado, 21, of 
San Fernando were taken to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills. Delgado 
was in good condition Saturday with a broken leg. Rodriguez was treated for 
minor injuries and released.

<P>
Police had not determined a cause for the crash Saturday.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George E. Fessenden, a retired general manager of a lumber company who owned a 
convenience market in Palmdale, has died in a Palmdale hospital. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime resident of Palmdale, he died Thursday of complications from heart 
problems, said his son, George E. Fessenden II. 
</P>
<P>
Born Oct. 3, 1915, in Searchlight, Nev., Fessenden came to California as an 
infant and graduated from San Bernardino High School in 1936. He was later 
hired by the Hayward Lumber Co. in San Bernardino, where he started as a yard 
manager, working his way up to general manager. He moved to the Antelope Valley 
in the early 1970s and continued in the same position at the company's 
Lancaster location until his retirement in 1968. That year, he and family 
members bought the Desert View Superette, a convenience store in Palmdale, 
where he worked until 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Fessenden was a longtime member of the Lancaster Rotary Club, the Lancaster 
Elks Club, the Fin and Feather Club in Palmdale and the Antelope Valley Country 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife of 53 years, Lois Fessenden; two sons, George E. 
Fessenden II of Palmdale and James L. Fessenden of Honolulu; a daughter; Jo Ann 
Champlin of Lancaster; three brothers, Milton Fessenden of Santa Monica, Donald 
R. Fessenden of Truth or Consequences, N.M., and Joseph Fessenden of Tulsa, 
Okla.; eight grandchildren; and one great-grandson. 
</P>
<P>
A graveside service is scheduled for 1 p.m. Monday at Joshua Memorial Park, 808 
E. Lancaster Blvd., in Lancaster. Chapel of the Valley Mortuary in Palmdale is 
handling the arrangements.

INJURY TO TESTAVERDE'S TOE IS PLAYING WITH CHARGERS' HEADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers announced early in the week that Vinny Testaverde 
would not start at quarterback against the Chargers today. 
</P>
<P>
Sure. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, I don't think the guy is going to be out," defensive coordinator 
Ron Lynn said. "Turf toe hasn't kept very many guys out. As a result, they are 
either feeding us a line of bull about the injury or they don't think much of 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Testaverde injured his big toe Oct. 7 against the Cowboys, missed a week of 
practice, but did not miss a start Oct. 14 against Green Bay. He reinjured his 
toe last week against the Cowboys, left the game and reportedly has not 
practiced this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had turf toe before," Charger linebacker Gary Plummer said. "You shoot it 
up and play. I'm sure if they were playing the Chicago Bears he'd shoot it up 
and play." 
</P>
<P>
The (4-3) Bucs will play the Bears in Tampa next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"If they were playing a team in their own division, like Chicago, he'd be 
playing," cornerback Gill Byrd said. "You can't tell me you're not going to 
play the third-ranked passer in the conference if it's an important game to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
In trying to gain the attention of his troops after a distressing 24-9 defeat 
to the Raiders last week, Coach Dan Henning has told his team he doesn't think 
the Bucs are taking the Chargers seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"I agree," defensive backs coach Jim Mora said. "If this was an important game 
to them, then they'd get Testaverde ready to play. When you get to a point 
where you haven't had a lot of success, you grab onto anything, but I think 
this is a valid rallying point. 
</P>
<P>
"If somebody is taking you lightly, and you're the underdog and you don't think 
you're gonna get their best shot, then sometimes you have a tendency to pour it 
on. If they're saying they don't need Vinny, that's fine. That's great with 
us." 
</P>
<P>
While members of the Charger coaching staff have challenged the veracity of 
their counterparts, there are some who believe Testaverde is seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard this thing about if he doesn't play they're not giving it their 
best shot, and I don't buy it," defensive lineman Burt Grossman said. "They 
have a quarterback, who is worth a couple of million, and he's hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"They held out Gary Anderson last week against Dallas and that wasn't to insult 
the Cowboys. They had lost to the Cowboys two weeks earlier, and do you think 
they were holding out their biggest weapon because they didn't think much of 
the Cowboys?" 
</P>
<P>
The Bucs said Chris Chandler, who was acquired from Indianapolis for a 
first-round draft pick earlier this season, will replace Testaverde. Chandler 
has completed eight of 16 passes for 113 yards with no touchdowns and an 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
"Vinny's toe must be pretty bad," quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver said. "I've 
had turf toe, and it's pretty painful, but you can play on it. His may be a lot 
worse than I've ever had. 
</P>
<P>
"But they have a competent backup in Chris Chandler. The drop-off won't be that 
much. I'm sure Vinny will be on call if needed, and hopefully he will be 
needed." 
</P>
<P>
Chandler started the first three games for the Colts last season, but injured a 
knee and was out for the rest of the year. Chandler started against the 
Chargers in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium on Oct. 23, 1988 and was nine for 17 
for 123 yards with three interceptions before being relieved by Gary Hogeboom 
in the Colts' 16-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they fear our pass rush and the blitzes our defense throws at 
offenses," guard Broderick Thompson said. "I don't think they they want to 
further injure Testaverde." 
</P>
<P>
No matter who's at quarterback, there's Anderson to stop. The Chargers traded 
Anderson to the Bucs for a pair of draft choices during the off-season, and he 
now leads the NFL in yards from scrimmage with 740. He also tops the Bucs in 
scoring with five touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, they (the Chargers) made a mistake not paying him the extra 
$150,000 to $200,000," Grossman said. "Just look at his stats, they pretty much 
tell it all." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson is coming off a calf injury that limited his play in last week's 17-13 
loss to Dallas. However, he has practiced this week without problem and will be 
playing for the first time in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium since Dec. 18, 
1988, when he rushed for a Charger-record 217 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Gary's playing better than I've ever seen him," defensive lineman Lee Williams 
said. "If any one player can dominate a game, Gary can." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, however, are in need of a victory. And it's no wonder a team 
might take them lightly. 
</P>
<P>
They have lost their first three games at home for the first time since 1975, 
and are four games behind the division-leading Raiders with a date in the 
Kingdome next week. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bucs are in for a game," linebacker Billy Ray Smith said with a smile. "I 
hate to disappoint them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers took linebacker Billy Ray Smith and tackle Joel Patten off injured 
reserve Saturday and added them to their 47-man roster. They placed linebacker 
Jeff Mills, who was acquired with the third-round pick the Chargers got from 
Tampa for Gary Anderson, on injured reserve with a hamstring pull. They also 
released punt returner Scott Schwedes.

VELASCO KICK GIVES CSUN SHARE OF WFC CHAMPIONSHIP; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: DEFENSE STIFLES SANTA CLARA, SETTING UP MATADORS' SEVENTH 
CONSECUTIVE VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SANTA CLARA, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With one sweep of his right leg, Abo Velasco turned what could have been the 
most forgettable night of his collegiate career into something memorable for 
everyone associated with the Cal State Northridge football team. 
</P>
<P>
With 29 seconds left, Velasco -- who had missed his five previous field-goal 
attempts Saturday night -- punched a 34-yard kick through the uprights to give 
Northridge a 10-7 comeback win over Santa Clara and at least a share of the 
Western Football Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
Velasco's kick climaxed 2 minutes 12 seconds of big-play offense by the 
ninth-ranked Matadors, who spent the previous 57 minutes-plus moving futilely 
up and down the field. 
</P>
<P>
And nobody, but nobody, felt worse about it than Velasco, a senior who attended 
Burbank High. 
</P>
<P>
Velasco missed twice from 46 yards. His other misses were from 38, 31 and 32 
yards. Dare one mention the point-after that narrowly skidded over the 
crossbar? 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would never come," Velasco said of the field goal that gave CSUN 
its seventh consecutive victory after a season-opening loss. "I was out of sync 
on the first two kicks, but after the second it really became a confidence 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough it was after miss No. 4 that he received a big boost. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there was a guy on the team that didn't say something to me," 
Velasco said. "Everybody said, 'You're going to win this game for us.' They 
never lost faith in me. They picked me up when I was down." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge is 4-0 in the WFC, a game ahead of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, which 
defeated Southern Utah State, 42-21. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors -- who outgained Santa Clara, 355 yards to 51 -- will play host to 
San Luis Obispo this Saturday at North Campus Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what football should be -- the last two weeks of the season and the two 
best teams playing for the championship," CSUN Coach Bob Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
Velasco's kick was the 32nd of his career, a Northridge record. He surpassed 
Jose Ballina, who had 31 between 1972 and '74. 
</P>
<P>
He never would have had the chance but for a few big plays down the stretch by 
Matador quarterback Sherdrick Bonner. 
</P>
<P>
Bonner, a senior, was the only player in the stadium who could relate to 
Velasco's misfortune. He lost two fumbles and threw two interceptions in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
But when Northridge finally scored, it was Bonner who turned in big plays back 
to back . 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 7-0, CSUN had the ball at its 44 with 2:21 on the clock. Bonner 
busted loose on a 42-yard scramble, then, on the next play, he hooked up with 
Billy Nealy for a 14-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Then came perhaps the night's oddest call. Northridge went for the PAT to tie, 
even though the Matadors still would have needed a victory over San Luis Obispo 
to claim the title outright. 
</P>
<P>
Velasco made it -- barely. And the Northridge defense, at its stingiest best, 
got the offense the ball again with 1:30 left. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the Matadors, tailback Albert Fann (134 yards rushing), who 
had sustained a twisted right ankle, stayed on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
"He was beat up," Burt said. "And since we were going to pass anyway . . ." 
</P>
<P>
A 22-yard pass from Bonner to Anthony Harris put Velasco in range. 
</P>
<P>
Bonner, whose touchdown throw to Nealy was only his second of the season, 
finished 16 of 33 for 182 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Bergman, Santa Clara's 6-foot-6 senior quarterback, was five of 23 for 58 
yards. That pretty much summed up the Bronco offense. 
</P>
<P>
Bergman was sacked seven times. Kenny Wallace, one of CSUN's outside 
linebackers, was credited with 5 1/2 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
Aron Wise -- who entered the game as the WFC's leading rusher, averaging 125 
yards a game -- was held to 35 yards in 21 carries. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos led at the half despite these facts: 
</P>
<P>
* Santa Clara had 20 yards on offense. 
</P>
<P>
* Northridge had six quarterback sacks -- 4 1/2 by Wallace -- for losses 
totaling 51 yards. 
</P>
<P>
* The Northridge offense, led by Fann's 79 rushing yards, totaled 125 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Santa Clara led only 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
The reason was Bonner's four first-half turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
The final miscue -- Bonner's third in the second quarter alone -- helped put 
Santa Clara on the board. 
</P>
<P>
With 3:25 left in the half, Bonner tried to hit wide receiver Joe Rice on an 
out pattern. But Rice ran out and up. 
</P>
<P>
And as Rice turned upfield and Bonner released the ball, Bronco cornerback Mark 
Modeste stepped up to receive the ball. He already was headed toward the goal 
line, and he covered the final 12 yards easily. 
</P>
<P>
Tobin Douglas' point-after kick was blocked at the line of scrimmage but 
nevertheless tumbled over the crossbar, putting Santa Clara ahead, 7-0.

FIGHTING WITH CONVICTION; 
</P>
<P>
BOXER RAMOS VOWS TO RIGHT HIS CAREER AFTER PRISON TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former U.S. Olympic team member who had grown into a hard-punching 
middleweight began his pro career by knocking out two opponents within 16 days. 
He gained attention in 1988 when he knocked out two men in the same night, but 
the problem was that he was not wearing boxing gloves at the time. And the two 
men he flattened were not wearing boxing trunks but neatly tailored business 
suits. 
</P>
<P>
That was the night that the world came crashing down on Alex Ramos. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, Ramos' story is not unusual for the bruising, crushing world 
of boxing. A tough kid from a tough place finds his career unraveling and 
lashes out at the world, the fury he needed as a boxer now wreaking havoc on 
society. Prisons are full of ex-boxers. And later, when they tell their 
stories, a smirk often comes to their faces. They tend to be a bit proud of 
their deeds. Mike Tyson often has told -- with no apparent remorse -- of days 
spent hammering innocent people to the concrete when he was a youth in a tough 
New York neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos is different. He does not want to talk of his darkest day. When pressed, 
he relents, but as he speaks his eyes water and dart around the room. Clearly, 
he is not at ease discussing the day, likely the only day in his life, that the 
world broke him down. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos served more than 20 months in the California State Prison at Corcoran, 50 
miles south of Fresno, after being convicted on two counts of assault and 
battery with a deadly weapon. The weapons were his fists. The victims were a 
manager and a promoter who Ramos claimed had bilked him of thousands of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, Ramos, 28, will take his first step on what he hopes is the path 
from being a former inmate to a world contender when he fights Ali Sanchez of 
Miami in a scheduled 10-round middleweight bout at the Country Club in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing better in this business than seeing a kid who has been knocked 
down get back up again and win," said Dan Goossen, president of the Ten Goose 
Boxing Club of Van Nuys, who signed Ramos for Tuesday night's fight. "Alex has 
been knocked down in his life. Now we want to watch him get back up again." 
</P>
<P>
Ramos stormed out of the Bronx as a 17-year-old and fought his way onto the U. 
S. Olympic team in 1980. That was the year, however, that President Jimmy 
Carter canceled U. S. participation in the Olympic Games to protest the Soviet 
occupation of Afghanistan, and Ramos and hundreds of other athletes were left 
with unfulfilled dreams. 
</P>
<P>
He turned professional a few weeks later and in November, 1980, launched his 
pro career with a quick knockout of Steve Arvin in Nevada. Just 16 days later, 
he knocked out Johnny Davis in Hartford, Conn., and four months after his pro 
career started he had a 5-0 record with five brutal knockouts. The boxing world 
was starting to watch. 
</P>
<P>
But when he was 15-0 with 10 knockouts, Ramos' career stalled. He was knocked 
out by little-known Ted Sanders in Atlantic City, N.J., and the luster was 
gone. He lost again to Murray Sutherland in Atlantic City in 1983. In 1984 he 
won the U. S. Boxing Assn. middleweight championship with a 12-round decision 
over Curtis Parker but was knocked out later that year by James Kinchen for his 
third pro loss. 
</P>
<P>
The next four years brought five more losses, including a 12-round decision 
loss to Michael Nunn, now the International Boxing Federation middleweight 
champ, at the Country Club on Nov. 21, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been fighting since I was 11," Ramos said. "And in all that time, no one 
really taught me very much. I had a lot of natural ability and took advantage 
of that but really didn't pursue boxing as I should have. I should have been a 
world champion a long time ago, but the effort wasn't there." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest reason for the lack of effort, Ramos said, was women. Along with 
his natural boxing ability, the Ramos package also includes a pair of soft, 
brown eyes and a handsome face. 
</P>
<P>
"My main problem throughout my career was Cupid," he said. "It was always very, 
very difficult for me to stay away. There were always the young ladies around, 
and always it seemed they were the wrong ones for me. I'd forget about training 
for a few weeks before a fight. And while it didn't seem to matter early in my 
career, when I ran into the tougher guys later, the guys who were serious about 
the training, I got beat. 
</P>
<P>
"Early in my career, when I hit a guy on the chin, he went down and stayed 
down. Later, against the tougher guys, they'd still go down. But they'd get 
back up again. And I was always just about out of energy by then." 
</P>
<P>
Then, on Feb. 2, 1988, he dropped down to the junior middleweight division, six 
pounds under the 160-pound middleweight limit, and lost a decision to 
unheralded Al (Bumblebee) Long in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
And within a week, the world became a very ugly place for Ramos. 
</P>
<P>
His manager and a promoter informed him, he testified at his trial, that he 
would not receive any money from his purse from the Long bout. They said that 
the expenses for the fight equaled the purse. He was enraged and nearly broke. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, Ramos' mother telephoned from her hospital bed and begged him 
to come home to see her. Because he could not afford the trip, he told her he 
could not make it. 
</P>
<P>
Later that night, Ramos' telephone rang again. A friend informed him that his 
mother had just died. 
</P>
<P>
And just before she died, he was told, she lifted her head from the pillow and 
cried out for her son. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Ramos, a tough-as-nails man, simply came apart. 
</P>
<P>
"She was waiting for me," said Ramos, a tear in his eye. 
</P>
<P>
Within an hour he had found his manager and the promoter and began a fearful 
beating that would send both men to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
His next stop was the Corcoran prison. He was released in January, but the 
memory still cuts at him. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had a visitor," he said of his incarceration. "I would not allow it. 
Family and friends called and wrote letters, but I would not let them see me 
there. It just didn't feel right. I felt very bad about being there. I had 
never been in any trouble in my life. 
</P>
<P>
"I just felt so bad about what I had done. But while I was there, I said to 
myself every day that when I got out I was going to come back to boxing and 
come back with the right attitude this time." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his release he met with an acquaintance, businessman Paul 
Gonzalez of Simi Valley. They talked for many hours, Ramos of his dreams, 
Gonzalez of his expectations should he agree to help his friend. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked of caring and respect and understanding," said Gonzalez, a producer 
of Latin jazz. "And I liked what I saw. I'm in a business where you have to be 
able to judge people. I can tell if a man is bald even when he's wearing a hat. 
And I saw in Alex something that I liked. I saw honesty. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that Alex Ramos is a good man." 
</P>
<P>
Now, it's time to find out if he can once again be a good boxer. He has hired 
Joe Goossen of the Ten Goose club, the longtime trainer of Nunn, to guide his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
"The money Alex can make at the Country Club is minimal," said Dan Goossen. "He 
knows that. But already I have had phone calls about Alex. People are 
interested. Because Alex Ramos has what most fighters don't have. He has a 
name. Everyone knows Alex Ramos, knows the talent and knows what he can be. 
</P>
<P>
"And fight by fight, one at a time, we'll find out if he does become that 
fighter again."

El Camino College rallied from a 12-point halftime deficit to beat Pasadena, 
39-29, in a Mission Conference Northern Division game at Murdock Stadium on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino (6-2 overall, 4-2 in league play) scored three touchdowns and a field 
goal in the second half to secure the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Rod Harvey completed 14 of 34 passes for 194 yards and three 
touchdowns and tailback Anthony Daigle caught two touchdown passes and rushed 
for 34 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena tailback, Ostell Miles, rushed for 141 yards on 29 carries and scored 
a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers (5-3, 3-3) had an early 14-0 lead. Anthony Douglas blocked Scott 
Peters' punt and Jose Aguilar returned it 12 yards for a touchdown. Miles 
scored on a two-yard run with 4:33 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey connected with Shannon Thompson for a 26-yard pass that set up Tony Da 
Costa's six-yard touchdown run to cut the lead to 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena increased its lead to 26-7 when quarterback James Marlborough passed 
65 yards to Ray Ethridge. Marlborough threw a seven-yard pass to Shaun Liddell 
for the other score. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Daigle to cut the lead to 26-14. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors opened the second half with a seven-play, 45-yard drive that ended 
in a 15-yard touchdown pass from Harvey to Daigle. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino scored again after linebacker Paul Koons recovered a fumble by Miles. 
Harvey passed to Thompson for a 28-yard touchdown. Harvey also found Thompson 
open for a two-point conversion that put the Warriors ahead, 29-26.

THE REVELRY SURROUNDING THESE RIVALRIES HAS NO PEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every morning when he walks out the door, Dan Schaitel shudders. He can't get 
used to seeing his wife wear red. 
</P>
<P>
The fuss over clothing is simple. Schaitel is the cross-country coach at Poway 
High School. For nine years, the family has worn the forest green and gray of 
the Titans. Red has been off limits since Day 1 because it is one of the colors 
of Mt. Carmel High School, Poway's Palomar League nemesis in more sports than 
one. 
</P>
<P>
But now, it's almost a prerequisite that Janet Schaitel wear red to work. This 
year she became the athletic secretary at Mt. Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
Rival Mt. Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At the 1989 cross-country meet between the schools, about 300 people lined 
the Lake Poway course to watch the Sundevils and Titans. Three hundred at a 
cross-country meet is like having 10,000 at a football game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A few weeks ago during a workout, Schaitel's team was running through the 
streets of an affluent Poway neighborhood. One of his runners was bitten by a 
dog belonging to a Scott Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher is the principal at Mt. Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, this is one heck of a rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
Not all coaches at the two schools are as intense as Schaitel and Mt. Carmel's 
Dennis McClanahan -- who recommended Schaitel for the Poway job -- but most 
coaches won't face each other as many as 12 times during the year with state 
and sometimes national rankings at stake in cross-country and track and field. 
</P>
<P>
"When the two schools get together," Schaitel says, "things happen." 
</P>
<P>
And that's what rivalries are all about. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Territorial bragging rights. The schools usually represent neighboring 
communities; the athletes often know each other and, in many cases, have 
competed against each other previously. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Championships. Nothing gets the adrenaline flowing like a game with a 
league title or playoff spot at stake. Bragging rights are OK, but does a 
rivalry mean as much if you're playing for fourth place? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Excellence. The schools have competent, competitive programs regardless of 
the sport, and beating a rival is often a barometer of your program. And a true 
rivalry transcends football. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Attendance/community support. The rivalry acid test: Does a bigger crowd 
than usual show up to watch the girls' volleyball match? 
</P>
<P>
"Undoubtedly, Poway-Mt. Carmel is the best rivalry in the county," Schaitel 
said. "They're both very competitive schools and they're both at the top of 
what they do. Athletics is still a major item in the overall environment at the 
two high schools; I don't think that's true everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Schaitel was graduated from Hoover in 1965 knowing the Cardinals' rivalry with 
Crawford, and he taught at St. Augustine, where he witnessed annual showdowns 
between Saints and University. And he's seen Poway and Mt. Carmel combine to 
win 11 section titles in 20 sports in 1989-90, including eight by Poway. 
</P>
<P>
You can't find 10,000 fans at a Poway-Mt. Carmel football game -- or virtually 
any game between schools from neighboring communities these days. But if you 
absolutely had to fill a stadium, Morse-Lincoln would do the trick. That might 
be as close as you could get to 1947, when 27,000 packed Balboa Stadium to 
watch the downtown team, San Diego, face off against its uptown rival, Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
One of those in attendance was 7-year-old John Shacklett, who was watching his 
first high school football game. He eventually was graduated from Grossmont in 
1957 and became the sixth-winningest football coach in San Diego County history 
(142-64-6 since 1971) at Morse High. 
</P>
<P>
He knows what big crowds are like. 
</P>
<P>
"We've thought about having a St. Augustine-University and Morse-Lincoln 
doubleheader in (San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium)," Shacklett said. "We just 
don't have a big enough stadium (of our own) right now." 
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 were turned away at Mesa College for last year's Morse-Lincoln 
game, which has attracted as many as 10,000 in years past. But as big as 
Morse-Lincoln is, Shacklett sees another game becoming the county's biggest. 
</P>
<P>
"The last three or four years," Shacklett said, "Point Loma-Morse has been kind 
of a happening." 
</P>
<P>
Happenings are what it's all about when it comes to big games and rivalries. 
You can't afford Charger tickets? Try Helix-Grossmont or Sweetwater-Chula 
Vista. How about Valhalla-Monte Vista in wrestling? 
</P>
<P>
Basketball's your bag? Again, Lincoln-Morse. Poway-Mt. Carmel. Definitely 
Oceanside-El Camino: It's cramped, it's humid and it's a wonder tickets aren't 
being scalped outside. This rivalry's so intense, even the gym walls sweat 
bricks. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1986 game, an Oceanside player named Junior Seau -- now a Charger 
linebacker -- became a part of local lore. 
</P>
<P>
Playing at El Camino for the Avocado League championship, the game was heated, 
tempers flared, and some fans tried to storm onto the floor -- but were headed 
off by security. El Camino game films showed Seau had elbowed one of the 
Wildcats in the back of the head on a play near the basket. 
</P>
<P>
A week later -- after principals and athletic directors at the two schools had 
reviewed the incident -- Seau apologized to the El Camino players, who later 
beat Oceanside in the section finals. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, Seau was named the league's player of the year over El Camino's 
Edmund Johnson, and the two teams met in the finals again. 
</P>
<P>
"Edmund questioned some things in the newspaper about Junior and our team, so I 
clipped them out and saved them," Oceanside Coach Don Montamble said. "When we 
went to the Sports Arena to play them in the finals, I took the clips and 
posted them on the board while the team was waiting outside. I came back out, 
told the team to go inside, and then I locked the door behind them. 
</P>
<P>
"I left them in there long enough read the article and really stew it over. 
When I finally went in, it was a very focused locker room." 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside beat El Camino, 53-51, even though Seau sat out much of the game 
after getting in early foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt about it, Oceanside-El Camino is the basketball rivalry," El 
Camino Coach Ray Johnson said. "The last 10 years it's been us or them for the 
league title, and then you throw in the six section titles in the last (nine) 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Montamble remembers the rivalry from his high school days. He was at Oceanside 
for three years, then had the choice of going to El Camino his senior season, 
1977. He took it. 
</P>
<P>
In that first season, Oceanside beat El Camino in the first round of league 
play, but Oceanside kept the Wildcats from the playoffs by sinking a basket 
with five seconds left in their second-round game. 
</P>
<P>
They've been at each other's throats ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Many rivalries today are borne out of schools splitting. Helix broke off from 
Grossmont, Mt. Carmel from Poway, Chula Vista from Sweetwater. But with more 
schools being built, some other rivalries have diminished. 
</P>
<P>
Fallbrook's rival is still Vista, but Vista considers fourth-year Rancho Buena 
Vista its primary foe. Santana and El Capitan have been rivals for years, but 
with Santee getting a second school -- West Hills -- Santana probably will 
develop a healthy distaste for the Wolf Pack. 
</P>
<P>
Quite simply, where Sweetwater and Chula Vista used to be the only teams in 
Chula Vista and National City, now there are five, including Bonita Vista, 
Castle Park and Hilltop. Subsequently, Sweetwater-Chula Vista has lost some 
intensity over the past four decades. 
</P>
<P>
"The more schools you get in North County (or anywhere else), the less rivalry 
you have," said Bob Burton, the activities director at Fallbrook for the past 
25 years. "There's less tradition." 
</P>
<P>
A $35 million bond issue on the November ballot could provide for a second high 
school in Fallbrook by 1994 or 1995. Despite all the tradition that Burton will 
recall with fondness, the Vista-Fallbrook rivalry probably will become just a 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
Most "bitter rivalries" in the East County already are memories. Since the 
Grossmont Conference split into 2-A and 3-A leagues, many games lost their 
meaning. 
</P>
<P>
"Since that split, the intense rivalry just isn't there," Mimi Test, assistant 
principal at 2-A Valhalla, said of her school's rivalry with 3-A Granite Hills. 
"The intensity of rivalries in the Grossmont District has been diluted somewhat 
because when they go head-to-head, it isn't anything that counts heavy toward a 
league championship." 
</P>
<P>
The oldest East County rivalry, Grossmont-Helix, whose 40-year rivalry includes 
the football teams playing for the annual possession of a musket, is a 2-A vs. 
3-A rivalry. So is El Capitan-Santana and El Cajon Valley-Granite Hills. The 
East County rivalries tend to differ by sport based on strength of program. 
That's why Valhalla gets up for Monte Vista in wrestling, Granite Hills in 
football and Helix in water polo. 
</P>
<P>
Granite Hills' traditional rival is El Cajon Valley, but Valhalla generates 
more excitement. Elsewhere, Point Loma-La Jolla stopped playing for The Shoe; 
the Pointer football team became more interested in Morse while the other 
sports began looking toward Mira Mesa. That's also why the annual Southwest-Mar 
Vista "Battle for the Bell," a 50-pound perpetual bronze bell, has lost some 
glamour; Southwest has beaten Mar Vista seven of the past eight years, six by 
shutout. Now Southwest gets excited when it hears the words "Chula Vista." 
</P>
<P>
Yet rivalries are treated much differently by students today. 
</P>
<P>
Mount Miguel football Coach Gary Cooper was a member of the Class of 1968. 
</P>
<P>
"I've noticed a change in intensity," Cooper said. "When I was back in high 
school, we used to try to upstage one another. I can remember one year Helix 
sent over a big board of mounted hot dogs that represented our players -- had 
them delivered during our pep assembly. We retaliated with a helicopter 
dropping Kleenexes on their campus because they were the Scotties. We got in 
trouble for it. 
</P>
<P>
"There used to be more campus visits -- in a good-natured way -- and you don't 
see that as much now." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego rivalries reached their peak before the population exploded. There 
were fewer schools, larger talent pools and community-wide support. And winning 
was important. 
</P>
<P>
According to Rick Smith, who has done extensive research on the San Diego high 
school scene and was a sports writer for The Tribune from 1960-72, history 
would indicate that Hoover's best football team was in 1954. That year, Hoover 
Principal Floyd Johnson told football coach Bob Kirchhoff that if the Cardinals 
didn't beat rival San Diego, changes were forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover entered the big game with a 7-0 record; San Diego was 6-1. John Adams, a 
230-pound fullback who ran the 100-yard dash in 9.9 seconds and would finish 
the year with 26 touchdowns, broke off a 65-yard run and was tackled at the 
one-yard line by Willie West. The Cavers held on downs and eventually scored a 
7-0 victory. The next day The Tribune showed a photo of San Diego defensive 
back Art Powell clearly interfering with Hoover receiver John Vanderline on one 
of the passes into the end zone during the failed series. 
</P>
<P>
And Kirchhoff? He was canned. 
</P>
<P>
Rivalries for some schools aren't rivalries for others. It seems everyone 
dislikes San Pasqual. Ramona and San Marcos consider San Pasqual their rival, 
but San Pasqual's rival is Escondido. But 2-A San Pasqual plays 3-A Orange Glen 
every year for the Bear Trophy, a carved wooden bear that goes to the winner of 
the football game between the schools on Bear Valley Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
There are other tangible spoils for some rivalries. In addition to a musket, a 
bear and a bronze bell, other traditional football rivalries provide the Golden 
Whip (El Capitan-Santana), the Golden Feather (El Cajon-Granite Hills) and a 
Claymore sword (Mount Miguel-Helix). Bullhorns go to the winner of the Mount 
Miguel-Monte Vista wrestling match. 
</P>
<P>
There are also traditional awards for some football winners, such as the Lonnie 
Fields, Jr./Ty Morrison Southeastern Bowl Trophy (Morse-Lincoln), the Kiwanis 
Cup (Poway-Mt. Carmel) and the Chamber of Commerce Intercity Trophy 
(Vista-Rancho Buena Vista). 
</P>
<P>
And the two Catholic schools, University and St. Augustine, play the Charity 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, charity. If only Scott Fisher's dog had shown some. Then again, it was 
Poway. 
</P>

USD TURNS FIRST-HALF FUTILITY INTO SECOND-HALF SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
University of San Diego, frustrated in the first half when its offense stalled 
three times inside the 20-yard line, scored 22 second-half points Saturday en 
route to a 28-14 victory over Menlo College in Atherton. 
</P>
<P>
The victory for the Toreros (6-2) may have been the most satisfying of the 
season, because it came against a team that had beaten two Division II 
opponents and was ranked in the top 10 in the Division III Western Region. It 
was the first victory in three attempts on the road against the Oaks (5-3) for 
USD, which has a chance to equal its 7-2 record of a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just a great team effort," Toreros Coach Brian Fogarty said. 
</P>
<P>
But in the first half, getting in the end zone was an exercise in futility for 
USD's offense. Fortunately for the Toreros, the their defense bought them some 
time by making some big plays and scoring some points to trigger the big second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
With the game tied, 6-6, early in the third quarter, USD's offense broke down 
for the third time deep in Oaks territory, this time on the 10. The drive 
resulted in a 32-yard field goal by Dave Bergmann, his third of the game to 
give USD a 9-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Then two plays after the ensuing kickoff, Torero safety Darby Barrett 
intercepted a bad pass by Menlo's Greg Clark and returned it 32 yards for a 
touchdown. USD led, 15-6, after Bergmann's extra-point kick failed. 
</P>
<P>
The Oaks pulled to within 15-12 when Clark capped an eight-play, 64-yard drive 
with a three-yard touchdown pass to Matt Moseley on the first play of the 
fourth quarter. But Darryl Jackson kept Menlo from cutting the lead to two when 
he blocked the extra point. 
</P>
<P>
That seemed to give the Torero offense the lift it needed. Fueled by a 54-yard 
kick return by Fallbrook High alumnus Greg Frinell and a crucial 
roughing-the-passer penalty on fourth down, USD's offense produced its first 
touchdown on a 10-yard run by fullback Scott Sporrer. 
</P>
<P>
Then after the defense forced a Menlo punt, the Toreros used 11 plays and five 
minutes to march 49 yards and score again, this time on a seven-yard pass from 
Brendan Murphy to tight end Mike Hintze. That gave USD a 28-12 lead with 6:16 
left. 
</P>
<P>
"The key for us was the second half, when we were able to run the ball on 
them," Fogarty said. "We got them on their heels a bit, and it opened up our 
passing game. It was nice to finally get the ball in the end zone." DANA HADDAD

SALEM TO CELEBRATE 300 YEARS OF WITCHERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SALEM, Mass. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here at the scene of the Salem Witch Trials, Halloween is the biggest holiday 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Haunted Happenings, an 11-day annual event, culminates Wednesday when Laurie 
Cabot, Salem's official witch, leads a candlelight procession to Gallows Hill 
where in 1692, 19 men and women were hanged for being witches. 
</P>
<P>
The grim event is marked each year with such events as costume balls, a psychic 
festival, the retelling of mysterious legends in historic homes, and 
spell-casting workshops. 
</P>
<P>
All year long, the drama of those frightful real-life witch trials is 
re-enacted daily with plays recounting the court proceedings and hangings. It 
all happens at the 1845 stone church converted into Salem's Witch Museum. 
</P>
<P>
"Welcome to the Witch Museum. Do you believe in witches? Millions of our 
ancestors did," begins the Witch Museum narrator. 
</P>
<P>
Business is also brisk this week at nearby Crow Haven Corner, a witchcraft shop 
named for the crow-filled pine tree nearby. Crystal balls, books of Tarot, 
magic wands and love potions are selling like hot cakes. 
</P>
<P>
"People have come here this Halloween season as always from throughout New 
England," said Alison Damario, Witch Museum education director. "But Salem is 
now preparing for a much greater, worldwide event -- a yearlong solemn and 
dignified commemoration of the 300th anniversary of the Witch Trials." 
</P>
<P>
Tercentenary plans call for exhibitions, plays and lectures about Salem's year 
of madness, hysteria and terror. Harvard University will hold a 1992 seminar 
about Increase and Cotton Mather, the father and son Puritan ministers, and the 
roles they played in the trials. 
</P>
<P>
There will be 300th anniversary conferences here on 17th-Century theology, 
witchcraft literature, intolerance, and civil and human rights. An application 
has been made to the Post Office for a Salem Witchcraft Trials commemorative 
stamp. And a statue commemorating the trials has been commissioned. There also 
will be a choral production of "The Crucible," Arthur Miller's play about the 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
Salem will be the site in 1992 of family reunions for descendants of the 19 
persons hanged and of Giles Cory, 80, a convicted witch who was pressed to 
death beneath several tons of rock here. 
</P>
<P>
Essex Institute, founded in 1821 as the official repository for Witchcraft 
Court transcripts, is researching now an exhibit on what life was like here at 
the time of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
The logo for the Salem Witch Trials Tercentenary is a gravestone rubbing of a 
face flanked by the dates 1692 and 1992. Salem is a derivative of the Hebrew 
word shalom meaning peace. But there was little peace in Salem in 1692. 
</P>
<P>
The madness began in the parsonage of Samuel Parris. There, Tituba, the family 
slave who was a native of Barbados, used stories of witchcraft to entertain the 
preacher's 9-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, and his 11-year-old niece, Abigail 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly, both girls began acting strangely, uttering weird sounds, crawling on 
all fours and barking like dogs, staring blankly into space and writhing with 
convulsive fits. Dr. William Griggs was called to the parsonage and delivered 
his diagnosis: "They are under the spell of witchcraft." 
</P>
<P>
"Who is bewitching you?" demanded Parris. The girls said it was Tituba and two 
women already held in low esteem in the community. 
</P>
<P>
Thus began the infamous inquisition. Before it was over, more than 400 persons 
were accused of being witches, 150 were jailed, 14 women and five men hanged, 
and poor Giles Cory crushed to death. 
</P>
<P>
At least three women and a baby died in prison. Several pregnant women were 
jailed as witches. Among those hanged was the Rev. George Burroughs, a Harvard 
University graduate accused of being a witch. 
</P>
<P>
A 5-year-old girl arrested for being a witch spent more than a year in jail 
before being released. Even a dog was killed for being a witch. The dog's "evil 
eyes" supposedly sent his accusers into convulsions. 
</P>
<P>
It was eight girls, aged 9 to 18, and five women who made all of the 
accusations. The entire volume of court testimony was based solely upon 
"spectral evidence" detailed by the accusers. The young girls and women made 
outrageous claims of witches tormenting and torturing them. And they alone were 
witnesses to the witches' work. 
</P>
<P>
The popular image of witches on brooms is derived from trial testimony of 
witches flying through the Salem skies on poles and sticks. 
</P>
<P>
"I am as innocent as the child unborn," Rebecca Nurse, 71, cried out during 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a petition signed by 40 of her neighbors attesting to her exemplary 
character, Nurse was convicted of being a witch and hanged. 
</P>
<P>
Her 17th-Century saltbox home is preserved in Danvers, five miles from Salem. 
Curtis White, 30, has lived in the Nurse home as caretaker for the last six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"No, the house is not haunted by Rebecca's spirit, although some wish it were," 
said White. Danvers is also the site of the Parris church and parsonage where 
the witchcraft hysteria began. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Trask, 43, Danvers town archivist, is a direct descendant of five 
accused of being witches, including John Proctor and Mary Eastey, who were 
hanged. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not unusual around here to have witches on the family tree," allowed 
Trask. 
</P>
<P>
Trask, who also chairs the Danvers Tercentenary Committee, showed a visitor an 
original church record book and opened it to 1692. There, written in the hand 
of preacher Parris, was the first known report of witchcraft that year: 
</P>
<P>
"I think the devil has been raised against us and his rage is vehement and 
terrible and when he shall be silenced the Lord only knows . . ., " wrote 
Parris. 
</P>
<P>
The Danvers Archival Center and Essex Institute are the two best repositories 
of records and information on the Salem Witchcraft madness. Historical novels 
and scholarly books have been published about the event continuously since it 
happened. The interest lingers and, say historians, will not be put to rest. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still many unsolved mysteries about the accused and the accusers of 
the trials, about so many things involved," said Trask. "That's what gives it 
its mystique. New writers keep showing up re-examining the event, always trying 
to mirror their generation, trying to understand it," he said. "There will 
always be new theories, like the recent one, for example, that contaminated rye 
made the girls hallucinate." 
</P>
<P>
A permanent exhibit of witchcraft at Essex Institute features artists' 
conceptions of three centuries of Salem witchcraft happenings, including the 
events described by the afflicted girls and women. 
</P>
<P>
One display at Essex has a bottle with human finger bones found on Gallows Hill 
(now a city park) in 1900 and a fragment of a coffin dug up there in 1783. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best known residents of present-day Salem is Laurie Cabot, 59, who 
has long black hair streaked with silver and always wears a black robe. In 
1977, when receiving an award from Michael Dukakis for her work with dyslexic 
children, the governor proclaimed her Salem's official witch. 
</P>
<P>
Cabot heads the Witches League for Public Awareness. She also gives psychic 
readings. Her daughter runs the local witchcraft shop. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to Salem to live 22 years ago to remind everyone that what happened in 
1692 had nothing to do with witchcraft. It was pure hysteria, madness," said 
Cabot. 
</P>
<P>
"The Witches League for Public Awareness is not a frivolous fringe group to be 
made light of or ignored. Witchcraft is a legally recognized religion in this 
country, a nature religion. The Earth is our mother." 
</P>
<P>
Halloween, she said, is known to witches as "Samhain" and is celebrated as the 
witches' new year. And where better to spend the holiday, said Cabot, than 
right here in Salem. 
</P>

CAMPAIGNS TRY PUTTING STARS IN VOTERS' EYES

<TEXT>
<P>
Here's one mystery even Jessica Fletcher might not be able to solve: How do you 
persuade fed-up California voters to oppose term limits for legislators? 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher, the earnest and friendly author on television's "Murder, She Wrote," 
has a knack for unraveling even the most devilish conundrums. 
</P>
<P>
But now California's legislative leaders have entrusted Angela Lansbury, who 
plays Fletcher on the popular CBS drama, with the task of saving their 
political futures. She is appearing on a commercial opposing Propositions 131 
and 140 on the Nov. 6 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Lansbury was chosen to do the anti-term-limits commercial after weeks of 
speculation in political circles about which star would play that role. The 
names mentioned ranged from Ronald Reagan to Bill Cosby and just about everyone 
in between, including such performers as Robert Redford, John Forsythe and Bart 
Simpson. Sources say actress Sharon Gless of "Cagney &amp; Lacey" fame is 
expected to do the campaign's next commercial. 
</P>
<P>
There is some debate within the advertising industry about how much these 
well-known faces help the million-dollar campaigns with which they are 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
"The vast majority of Hollywood stars have not the slightest idea what they're 
into," said Hal Larson, who writes political ads. "There are exceptions, but 
the majority are people who are good actors and don't know a lot about the 
causes they're promoting." 
</P>
<P>
Campaign directors deciding whom to use in a commercial often research what the 
public thinks of the stars. One tool is the "Q-rating," which was developed by 
New York-based Marketing Evaluations Inc. and purports to measure the 
likability of stars among people who are familiar with them. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's president, Steven Levitt, declined to provide the ratings for 
Lansbury or any other personality. But he said the firm obtains its information 
from national surveys of 8,000 people. Each is asked to say if the celebrity in 
question is among their favorites or is someone they consider to be "good," 
"fair" or "poor." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a measure of appeal," Levitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Lansbury's ad has sparked spirited protests from supporters of both measures, 
who have complained that the ad is inaccurate and does not disclose the true 
source of its financial backing -- legislative leaders Willie Brown and David 
A. Roberti. Proposition 140's supporters have described the ad as "Distortion, 
She Wrote" and called for a nationwide boycott of Lansbury's show. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction to her political debut surprised the veteran actress of stage and 
screen, according to her son and spokesman, who said he hopes Lansbury's first 
ad will be her last. The experience also illustrates the pitfalls faced by 
actors and actresses who venture into uncharted political waters -- and by the 
campaigns that use performers as star witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought the entertainment industry was rough, but politics, they're really 
going for blood," said David Shaw, Lansbury's son. "She was just standing up 
and saying people ought to have a right to vote for who they want to represent 
them. She didn't realize that there were going to be these repercussions." 
</P>
<P>
Lansbury and Gless apparently have high Q-ratings. Although some political 
insiders think Bill Cosby "cuts both ways" -- turning off as many people as he 
excites -- campaign media consultant Leo McElroy has only awe for the 
television superstar. A consultant to the Proposition 131 campaign, McElroy 
said he was "terrified" when he heard the rumor that Cosby might do the ads 
opposing the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"People love Bill Cosby and they not only love him, but he has credibility," 
said McElroy, who once worked as a television newsman. "I think Cosby would 
have scared us. I think he has a tremendous message to deliver." 
</P>
<P>
Cosby is so well known that he has an aura all his own. Lesser stars often are 
used because the characters they play reflect a quality the campaign wants to 
project. 
</P>
<P>
For one ad in the campaign in favor of Proposition 134, the "nickel-a-drink" 
alcohol tax measure, McElroy used "L.A. Law" star Richard Dysart. 
</P>
<P>
"Dysart with the lawyer persona could easily do the analysis of what was good 
law and what was bad law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Larson, who wrote the alcohol industry ads opposing Proposition 134, said 
he does not think that spots relying on a fictional character, rather than the 
actor himself, are effective. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a certain leap of faith there," Larson said. "First people have to 
identify him as being (a lawyer) and then believe in real life that he has that 
credibility." 
</P>
<P>
Larson's ads have used Tony Randall, the veteran actor best known for his 
portrayal of Felix Unger in the television version of "The Odd Couple." 
</P>
<P>
"He has credibility with a certain segment of the population," Larson said. 
"People understand that he's a good person." 
</P>
<P>
Although Lansbury's credits date to 1944, her widespread appeal comes mainly 
from her role as Jessica Fletcher in "Murder, She Wrote." Her character is a 
sweet if no-nonsense woman whose integrity is without question. 
</P>
<P>
"Jessica Fletcher has an effect on people," Lansbury told The Times a week ago, 
before the controversy erupted about her role in the anti-term-limits ad. "If 
there are people like her around, God's in his heaven and all is right with the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
But Lansbury, a naturalized U.S. citizen who is a resident of Brentwood and a 
registered Democrat, hasn't always played such roles. Earlier in her career, 
she often played the sinister, evil part. In the 1962 film "The Manchurian 
Candidate," Lansbury was the top communist spy in the United States, using her 
brainwashed son and feeble-minded husband in a plot to take over the American 
government -- not exactly the image Democrats Brown and Roberti were hoping to 
convey in the commercial. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, Lansbury said, she has turned down such parts. "It's awfully hard to 
get away from playing an evil person," she said. "It takes many years to live 
it down." 
</P>
<P>
Lansbury wouldn't comment about the uproar over the term limits campaign. Her 
son said she has no intention of retracting the ad. But she probably won't be 
doing this kind of work again. 
</P>
<P>
"She's not going to back off," Shaw said. "In retrospect, maybe she shouldn't 
have been so quick to do this thing. I can't speak for her. But as a member of 
the family, I'd say let's just stay away from this in the future. Let's just go 
vote."

California residents are bracing for a recession by trimming spending plans for 
new cars, vacations, Christmas gifts and restaurant meals, The Los Angeles 
Times Poll has found, a behavior pattern that could intensify the current 
economic slump. 
</P>
<P>
Optimism about the California economy has been giving way to financial jitters 
since last year, the survey shows. Majorities of the rich and poor, men and 
women, residents of Southern California and the Bay Area all expect a recession 
within the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Californians retain more faith in their state's economy than in the 
nation's overall, which a majority says already has entered a recession. 
</P>
<P>
"California is a great place to build a business and to live and for jobs," 
said John Rutledge, chairman of the Claremont Economics Institute, a private 
firm. "But we're treading water for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Many of those interviewed, however, said the economy was sinking rather than 
treading water, both at the state and national levels. 
</P>
<P>
Almost three-quarters said the United States would suffer a recession by next 
year, with just more than half responding that a downturn was in progress now. 
At home, the view was better, but only by a little: Two out of three said 
California would tumble into a recession by next year; two out of five said the 
downturn had arrived already. 
</P>
<P>
The findings seem to highlight a stark reality: For all its economic strength, 
the Golden State cannot shield itself from the economic forces that are 
buffeting the national economy. 
</P>
<P>
"California is a microcosm of the United States," said David G. Hensley, a UCLA 
economic forecaster. "The factors that would push the United States into a 
recession would push California into a recession. . . . I think it's going to 
be a rough ride for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
The Times' telephone survey of 2,564 Californians was conducted between Oct. 19 
and Oct. 24, a time when the federal budget crisis appeared to be reaching a 
peak. The findings are considered accurate to within 3 percentage points. The 
survey was supervised by Susan Pinkus, assistant Times Poll director. 
</P>
<P>
The poll also underscored the political controversy surrounding tax increases. 
Even as politicians in Washington were crafting a tax-increase plan last week, 
six out of 10 respondents said they opposed increasing taxes to cut the 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Yet few Californians seem to blame President Bush for the nation's economic 
malaise; only 7% cited him as the source. Rather, Congress emerged as the 
villain. More than one in four respondents faulted the legislative branch for 
the country's economic ills. Oil prices were cited by 13% and "corporations 
living on borrowed money" by 12% as other causes of America's economic 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't think he (Bush) created the economic recession. They believe 
Congress is far more responsible," said William Schneider, a scholar at the 
American Enterprise Institute and a political analyst for The Times. "But that 
doesn't mean he's not getting blamed for something." 
</P>
<P>
The "something" may be a lack of leadership in the budget process and a failure 
adequately to explain the reason for higher taxes, Schneider suggested. Bush's 
popularity has fallen sharply in recent weeks, according to national polls. 
</P>
<P>
In California, optimism about economic prosperity also has fallen. Just a year 
ago, 37% rated the California economy as in strong shape. By last week, 
however, the figure had shrunk by more than half. Asked to rate the state's 
economy, a majority of those polled described it as somewhere between good and 
bad, with more leaning to a negative view. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the Middle East tension and rising gas prices and rising taxes, the 
poll is reflecting a very deep sense of foreboding by the average family," said 
Joseph A. Wahed, chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. "I'm not 
surprised at all by the results." 
</P>
<P>
The findings were generally consistent throughout the state, although views 
about the economy varied a little among regions. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County residents were least likely to describe California as in bad 
shape today. Elsewhere in Southern California, residents took a slightly 
gloomier view. People in the Central Valley were expecting the longest economic 
slump, with one in three saying it would last more than 18 months. Just one in 
five Orange County residents said the downturn would last that long. 
</P>
<P>
More than two out of five Los Angeles respondents said the recession already 
had started; the figure was slightly lower in other regions, but often close 
enough to be within statistical margins of error. Findings in the Bay Area and 
Los Angeles were similar for various questions. 
</P>
<P>
A recession is generally defined as a period of six consecutive months in which 
the economy is in decline. In such a slump, unemployment rises, wage gains are 
sharply restricted and business profits suffer. But respondents to the survey 
may have had a less technical definition in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, California's economic diversity has been an insurance policy 
against hard times, limiting the ripple effects caused by a downturn in any one 
industry. Yet national problems involving savings and loans, commercial banks, 
real estate, construction and the cost of energy appear to be taking a toll. 
</P>
<P>
"Southern California will not escape the recession," predicted Stephen Levy, 
director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo 
Alto. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, economic anxiety is spreading, a factor that could prove significant 
in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Six in 10 of those surveyed said they expected to postpone, cancel or reduce 
spending due to economic fears. These spending cuts would ricochet through the 
economy, hurting a range of retailers, service providers and, ultimately, 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Almost one-third of those interviewed cited plans to scale back vacations, for 
example. Car purchases and dining out also were cited by one in three as 
targets for cuts. 
</P>
<P>
By slightly smaller margins, consumers said they would scale back plans to buy 
Christmas presents (27%), homes (26%) and major appliances (22%). 
</P>
<P>
Such attitudes are considered important, because consumer spending amounts to 
two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. When people opt to protect themselves by 
hanging onto their dollars -- as they do in times of rising unemployment -- 
their actions can further weaken the economy. Analysts sometimes describe this 
scenario as a self-fulfilling recession. 
</P>
<P>
"For every guy that actually gets laid off, there probably are 20 guys who are 
scared," said Rutledge, the Claremont economist, noting the widespread concern 
in Southern California about layoffs in the defense industry. "And those guys 
aren't buying sofas and tables. They're probably building a little cushion of 
savings." 
</P>
<P>
The California findings fit in with national data that highlight an 
extraordinary wariness by consumers since the onset of the Persian Gulf crisis. 
Consumer confidence has plunged to its lowest level in eight years, the 
Conference Board, a business research group, said last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Any further curtailment in spending could readily push us into a full 
recession," warned Fabian Linden, executive director of the board's Consumer 
Research Center in New York, which surveys 5,000 households a month. 
</P>
<P>
While economic wariness runs deep, there also are some notable differences 
within the California public, The Times Poll shows. 
</P>
<P>
Just over one woman in 10 gives the state economy good grades, for example. 
Twice as many men rated the economy highly. 
</P>
<P>
Members of different population groups also have disparate opinions on whether 
the state is now gripped by a recession. Among women, 45% said the state is in 
such a slump. Of the men surveyed, just 37% shared that opinion. 
</P>
<P>
A gender gap also appeared in the public's view of how long the slump would 
persist. About 29% of women said it would last for more than 18 months. Only 
23% of men said it would last that long. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks and Latinos take a substantially dimmer view of the California economy 
than Anglos do. Two out of five Anglos agreed that a recession had arrived. 
Blacks were more pessimistic, with one out of two saying that was the case. 
Latinos were slightly more optimistic than blacks, but more pessimistic than 
Anglos. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, just 24% of Anglos said the recession would last longer than 18 
months. For blacks, it was 39%; for Latinos the figure was 31%. Asked to rate 
the financial strength of the "head of your household," almost half of Anglos 
said it was good. By contrast, fewer than a third of blacks and Latinos 
described their household finances as "good." 
</P>
<P>
Despite such differences, the survey showed that economic worries are cutting 
across much of the population. While Latinos seemed most inclined to tighten 
their budgets -- with three out of four declaring they planned to do so -- 
majorities of blacks and Anglos planned to cut back, too. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a real negative psychology at this stage," said Wahed of Wells Fargo. 
"I don't think it will last forever. It will change as business conditions 
change and the Middle East crisis is resolved." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TIMES POLL: ASSESSING THE ECONOMY 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times Poll interviewed 2,564 respondents in California, asking 
about their plans for coping with the economic slowdown and their assessment of 
the depths of the problems facing the state and national economies. 
</P>
<P>
Do you expect to postpone, cancel, or reduce spending on any of the following 
purchases because of the economic situation in the country: a home, car, 
Christmas presents, major appliances, a vacation, dining out and entertainment 
or some other item?

DUELING BALLOT MEASURES VIE FOR MOST VOTES

<P>
The move toward rival ballot initiatives that took off in 1988 with five 
insurance measures is back with a vengeance this election year. 
</P>
<P>
Besides initiative measures loaded up against each other on a number of issues, 
voters also can go for "poison pill" Proposition 136 -- which on its own could 
wipe out key parts of at least three other propositions. 
</P>
<P>
Where new revenues are called for in these measures -- including a steep hike 
in alcohol taxes and new funds for law enforcement -- Proposition 136 would 
require that they pass by a two-thirds margin. It would also require a 
two-thirds popular vote before certain other taxes could be raised by elective 
bodies. 
</P>
<P>
With these and other stiff requirements, Proposition 136 presents one of the 
newest wrinkles on the initiative front, but certainly not the only one. 
</P>
<P>
New ground is being broken in a variety of areas as initiative sponsors show 
they are not too proud to borrow old ideas, add a twist here, a turn there, put 
some zeros behind a dollar sign, and then drop it all in the laps of the 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
Take the issue of dueling ballot measures. For many years, business 
associations or public-interest groups that were opposed to ballot measures 
were content to mount vigorous "no" campaigns when they wanted to defeat a 
proposition. Now they not only mount a "no" campaign, they also put up a rival 
measure, usually with a kicker that their initiative takes precedence if it 
passes with more votes than its competitor. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, among the 28 measures on the Nov. 6 ballot, voters are not only 
being asked to consider Proposition 136, the king of all countermeasures, but 
they must sort through rival or overlapping initiatives on five separate 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 128, a tough, new regulatory measure known as "Big Green" by 
supporters, clashes with Proposition 135, drafted as a countermeasure by 
agricultural and chemical company interests. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 130, the so-called "Forests Forever" initiative that would severely 
restrict timber harvesting, triggered Proposition 138, the timber industry's 
countermeasure that opponents say was drafted solely to confuse voters and 
deflect the effort to limit tree-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
Two alcohol tax increase measures are vying against each other. There is 
Proposition 134, the so-called "nickel-a-drink" initiative that health groups, 
experts on alcoholism and law enforcement groups are backing. Proposition 126 
is the alcohol industry's countermeasure that was put on the ballot by its 
allies in the Legislature and calls for a much smaller tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
There also are two overlapping law enforcement measures and two measures in 
conflict over how much to limit the terms of elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
If that were all there was to the general election ballot, it would probably be 
enough to keep things interesting. But there is more. 
</P>
<P>
Voters are being asked to approve a record $5.7 billion in new borrowing under 
a variety of bond proposals -- after the June primary in which voters approved 
$5 billion in bond measures. There is bond money contained in four of the 
initiatives plus $3.7 billion in bond proposals put on the ballot by the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
This year also marks an acceleration in the trend of officeholders who get 
involved with initiatives. Initiatives were designed to be the last resort of 
citizens unable to get satisfaction from their elected officials. Indeed, 
sponsors of nearly all the initiatives on the November ballot say they only 
began their campaigns after Gov. George Deukmejian and the Legislature 
repeatedly rejected their proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it seems, citizens are being overshadowed by special interests and elected 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp made three initiatives part of his platform in 
his campaign for the Democratic nomination for governor. Van de Kamp lost in 
the primary to Dianne Feinstein, but the three initiatives will appear on the 
November ballot: Proposition 128, the so-called "Big Green" measure; 
Proposition 129, a law enforcement measure to combat drug abuse, and 
Proposition 131, an officeholder term-limitation measure. 
</P>
<P>
"Van de Kamp may have a bigger impact on policy in California than the next 
governor if these three pass," said Robert M. Stern, co-director of the 
California Commission on Campaign Financing. 
</P>
<P>
But Van de Kamp is not alone. Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy is sponsoring a separate 
law enforcement initiative (Proposition 133), Assemblyman Lloyd G. Connelly 
(D-Sacramento) is a force behind the "nickel-a-drink" alcohol tax measure 
(Proposition 134), and the list goes on. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 13 voter-originated initiatives on the ballot, Stern said that eight are 
sponsored by officeholders. The remaining 15 propositions were placed there by 
the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Stern's commission, which studies voting trends, found several other noteworthy 
developments on the general election ballot. Two years ago, it cost about 
$800,000 for initiative supporters to gather enough signatures to place a 
measure on the ballot; this year, the cost was close to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
This year will also have a record number of constitutional amendments -- 
initiatives that amend or add sections to the California Constitution -- as 
opposed to statutory initiatives, which simply change a state law. 
</P>
<P>
Counting the June primary ballot, voters will have faced 11 constitutional 
amendments this year, five of them in November. In contrast, between 1976 and 
1988, the highest number of constitutional amendments to reach the ballot in 
any election year was four. Constitutional amendments are growing in 
popularity. Sponsors prefer them to statutory initiatives because the 
Legislature and courts have a more difficult time amending or changing them 
once they pass. Additionally, voters have to approve any amendments. 
</P>
<P>
As for spending to pass and defeat the various measures, the November campaigns 
still have a long way to go to match the amount spent on the November, 1988, 
election by insurance companies, which contributed more than $63 million on the 
various "yes" and "no" campaigns that developed around five industry measures. 
</P>
<P>
But already the alcohol industry has spent at least $25 million this year on 
three initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
All of this makes for one of the most complex and longest ballots in history. 
Experts say voters need a minimum of a high school education just to understand 
the discussion of the measures in the ballot pamphlet prepared by the secretary 
of state's office. Some say college graduates will even have a tough time. 
</P>
<P>
This year's summary of the ballot measures comes in two parts and runs 224 
pages -- the longest in state history. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, historically the 28 measures on the November ballot rank this election 
only fourth in sheer bulk. In November, 1912, 48 propositions were put before 
voters; in November, 1922, voters faced 30 measures and two years ago, there 
were 29 proposals for voters to decide. 
</P>
<P>
With California enjoying such a long, colorful and contentious history, then, 
it would seem that somewhere along the line there would have been a precedent 
for Proposition 136, a measure conceived of by those allied with Howard 
Jarvis-Paul Gann anti-tax groups and their financial backers in the alcohol 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
But modern-day observers of the initiative process say there has never been a 
measure quite like Proposition 136. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, it is sweeping enough. It would make it tougher for initiative 
sponsors, local governments and the state Legislature to pass tax increases, in 
some cases requiring a two-thirds vote of the people in place of, for example, 
a majority vote on a City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Such a requirement would apply to special taxes -- those raised for single 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Even if supporters of a special tax could get a two-thirds vote, Proposition 
136 would limit the size of the increase to 1% of the value of the item. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the 25-cents-a-pack hike in cigarette taxes approved in 1988 would have 
been prohibited under the proposed Proposition 136 rules; any increase could 
have been no more than a couple of pennies a pack. 
</P>
<P>
For the Legislature, laws requiring a two-thirds vote to raise taxes would be 
toughened, closing loopholes opened since the original tax restrictions imposed 
by Proposition 13 were enacted in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
But Proposition 136 goes further by proposing to apply its provisions to other 
measures on the November ballot. Its authors wrote it so that it will take 
effect Election Day, and since the day starts right after midnight, it would 
instantly void any tax measure on the ballot with it that failed to get at 
least a two-thirds vote. Opponents say their lawyers maintain it is patently 
unconstitutional because it would basically disenfranchise voters. 
</P>
<P>
Tax provisions of measures on the ballot that Proposition 136 could nullify, 
assuming it survived court challenges, include Proposition 134, the 
"nickel-a-drink" alcohol tax increase, as well as Propositions 129 and 133, the 
two law enforcement measures, according to the state legislative analyst's 
office. Some say the measure could even stretch far enough to void fee increase 
proposals in Proposition 128, should both measures pass. 
</P>
<P>
All of that is by design. Proposition 136, though sponsored by Howard Jarvis 
Taxpayers Assn. and Paul Gann's Citizens Committee, is being supported 
financially by the alcohol industry, which so far has contributed more than $2 
million to the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents view this as a back-door effort by the industry to defeat the 
"nickel-a-drink" measure. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Fox, one of the drafters of Proposition 136, said the measure began as a 
follow-up to loopholes in Proposition 13, but the "poison pill" or "ballot 
virus" provision was added later with the encouragement of business groups. 
</P>
<P>
"We are obviously getting a lot of money from the liquor industry to promote 
this thing. But it is almost natural that they want to protect themselves. This 
will help them," Fox said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Patrick Johnston, no stranger to the turbulence of legislative 
campaigns, finds himself in the awkward spot of asking constituents to vote for 
him twice on Nov. 6 -- once for the Assembly and again for the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Is he greedy? Power hungry? No, says the five-term Stockton Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston complains that he was forced into seeking two offices simultaneously 
because of a maneuver by a Democratic "power couple" -- former state Sen. John 
Garamendi and his wife, Patti -- that was skillfully timed to give her an 
election advantage to succeed her husband. 
</P>
<P>
John Garamendi, heavily favored to win his own race as California's first 
elected insurance commissioner, was so confident that he resigned his Senate 
seat on Labor Day instead of waiting until after the election or until he took 
the new office next year. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, Garamendi gave his wife a campaign boost in her attempt to win his 
old seat, says Johnston. He is now forced to try to explain to the 
Stockton-area constituents he has represented for a decade why his name appears 
on the regular ballot for reelection to the Assembly and on the special 
election ballot for the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people say, 'Oh yeah, I get it.' But I'm not sure they always do," 
Johnston said of the voters. "It didn't have to be this way, but it was a 
calculated decision by John to benefit Patti." 
</P>
<P>
Along with Johnston appearing on two ballots, Garamendi's early resignation 
gave his wife valuable time to organize her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Although seeking public office for the first time, Patti Garamendi -- a law 
school graduate and mother of six children ages 4 to 22 -- for years has been 
enmeshed in her husband's ambitious political career. 
</P>
<P>
Married for 25 years, the Garamendis were sweethearts during the 1960s at UC 
Berkeley, where John was a football star. Later, they served together in the 
Peace Corps and ranched in the Northern California Gold Rush country near 
Mokelumne Hill. 
</P>
<P>
From her husband's first race for the state Assembly in 1974, Patti Garamendi 
has been considered a full partner in his many campaigns for legislative and 
statewide offices. 
</P>
<P>
She acquired a reputation as the spark plug of his political ambitions, a 
notion she rejects. "I think that is really untrue and unfair," she said. "I 
think that is a way of taking a cheap shot at John. He's brilliant. There are 
not too many men I could have stayed in the semi-shadow for." 
</P>
<P>
Patti Garamendi argues that Johnston has overblown the voter confusion issue 
and asserts that after 16 years of working with her husband, "I now have this 
window of opportunity in my life to serve. I may never have that opportunity 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Patti Garamendi, 46, and Johnston, 44, an expert on insurance, banking and 
savings and loan issues, are the best known of 10 candidates in the Nov. 6 
special election to fill the two-year unexpired term. 
</P>
<P>
If no one wins outright, a runoff will be held in January for the sprawling 
district that includes parts of the picturesque Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, 
the historic Mother Lode in the Sierra and vast expanses of farmland in the 
Central Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Some Republican strategists foresee a runoff as offering the GOP its best hope 
in decades of seizing the Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
John Garamendi emerged from the June primary as the odds-on favorite to become 
insurance commissioner. And Johnston and Patti Garamendi began in earnest to 
organize their campaigns to succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnston, who said John Garamendi had tried to persuade him not to run, 
said he had expected to run in a special election for Garamendi's seat next 
year -- not next month. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston's name was already on the November ballot in his Assembly district, 
which is wholly contained in the Senate district. "I can't get off the Assembly 
ballot even if I die," Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston asserts that timing of the resignation was designed to create 
confusion among Johnston's core constituents in his Assembly district, whom he 
counts on heavily to return him to the Assembly and send him to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"I ask them to vote for me twice," said Johnston. "If I am elected to both, I 
will resign from the Assembly." 
</P>
<P>
But the Garamendis contend that their timing saved taxpayers the $500,000 cost 
of a special election next year and assures constituents that they will be 
represented when the new Legislature convenes in December. 
</P>
<P>
Claiming she had no insider information, Patti Garamendi maintains that she did 
not know until the night of Labor Day that her husband had actually submitted a 
letter of resignation that she said he had mulled over for three days. 
</P>
<P>
"He came home and I said, 'Well, did you do it or not?' He said, 'Yeah, I 
stopped by the Capitol on my way back from the airport.' So, immediately, I 
think we've got to get his state car cleaned up and returned. I've got to get 
health insurance for six kids and it's all . . . go on my television (spots)." 
</P>
<P>
Besides taking heat about her candidacy creating the possibility of a Garamendi 
"dynasty," Patti Garamendi said she is also up against entrenched alliances. 
She charges that Johnston and Assembly Speaker Willie Brown tried to stake out 
the Senate seat as Johnston's political property. 
</P>
<P>
She recounted that she got into a shouting match with Brown over the issue. As 
she recalled the exchange, she informed Brown: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to run for John's seat.' He told me, 'That's Pat Johnston's seat.' I 
said, 'That's my seat.' His voice rose, 'No way, no way.' 'Just watch me,' " 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston, married and the father of two, first won election to the Assembly in 
1980 by only 25 votes after a recount. Low key, he is known for doing his 
homework on insurance and finance issues and has been discussed as a contender 
to succeed Brown as Assembly Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston, an aide to John Garamendi for six years, and Patti Garamendi are both 
philosophically moderate Democrats with few differences on issues, except the 
death penalty. She supports capital punishment and he does not. 
</P>
<P>
In the short nine-week campaign that is heavily dependent on television spots 
to reach the sprawling district, Johnston has sought in one commercial to 
explain his races for two offices. "John and Patti Garamendi have manipulated 
the date of the Senate election to hurt my chances of winning," he says. 
</P>
<P>
A "generic" Johnston commercial cites neither office. This tactic gets him 
exposure for each and also allows his separate Assembly and Senate campaign 
committees to split the high cost of broadcast time. 
</P>
<P>
Patti Garamendi's TV spots feature her recalling her Peace Corps experiences in 
Ethiopia and her familiarity with tightly knit rural communities of the 
district. Her low-key campaign also points out "16 years of legislative 
experience working with Sen. John Garamendi." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest single contributor to her campaign has been Patti Garamendi. 
Recently filed public records show contributions of $182,500 -- including 
$106,000 she loaned the campaign herself -- most of it for television 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston, meanwhile, has collected $252,350 for his Assembly campaign and 
$131,010 for his Senate race, most of it from organizations with business 
before the Legislature -- labor, physicians, teachers, hospitals, insurance 
companies and developers.

POLICE FOLLOW THE SCENT, TRACK DOWN COOKIE TAMPERING SUSPECT

A Mrs. Fields Cookies store policy that links employees with batches of cookies 
they bake helped police Saturday track down a 20-year-old employee suspected of 
adding staples to a white chocolate cookie. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Steven Connors of Anaheim, who had worked at the Mall of Orange store 
five weeks, was arrested at his home in connection with the incident and also 
on $2,700 of outstanding traffic warrants. 
</P>
<P>
Connors became a suspect after a customer returned a cookie to the store about 
6 p.m. Friday. Company officials ordered the store closed and employees turned 
over to police the remaining stock of 48 cookies and three trays of brownies, 
some of which had been sprinkled with staples. No injuries were reported and 
police called the case an isolated one. The store was open Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Debbi Fields, president and chief executive officer, said it was the first such 
incident in the cookie chain's 12-year history. "I am shocked and concerned 
that this could happen," Fields said in a written statement from the company's 
headquarters in Utah. "I am especially pleased to know that the police found 
there has been no one injured." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the company said store policy that requires employees to rotate 
from sales to baking positions at different times of the workday helped tie the 
suspect to a batch of cookies made between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Police Sgt. Ed Falkenstien said Connors could be charged with adding 
harmful substances to food, a felony. Police have not determined the motive 
behind the tampering.

SUPREME COURT MOVES TO EASE CASELOAD; 
</P>
<P>
ATTORNEYS: JUSTICES PROPOSE GIVING STATE BAR AUTHORITIES BROAD NEW POWER TO 
DISBAR LAWYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Supreme Court, in a move to ease its heavy caseload, has 
proposed giving State Bar authorities broad new power to disbar or suspend 
attorneys for professional misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Up to now, only the justices themselves have performed that task, automatically 
reviewing and issuing opinions in dozens of cases annually in which lawyers 
contest Bar recommendations for punishment by the high court. 
</P>
<P>
But concern has grown that the justices were spending too much of their limited 
time on these relatively routine disciplinary matters, forcing them to neglect 
important civil and criminal issues. A recent study showed that of 104 court 
opinions issued in a one-year period, a record 43 came in lawyer disbarment and 
suspension cases. 
</P>
<P>
The court Friday released the text of proposed new court rules under which, in 
all contested lawyer-discipline cases, the justices would grant oral arguments 
and issue opinions only when there are "sufficient grounds" to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, all rulings by the newly created State Bar Court ordering 
suspension or disbarment would become final, unless the justices decide to 
grant review of any resulting appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Lesser punishments -- such as public reprovals -- will continue to be 
administered by the Bar, as they have in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"The new procedures are expected to result in a substantial decrease in the 
number of cases in which the Supreme Court must hold hearings and write 
opinions," a court statement said. 
</P>
<P>
State Bar President Charles S. Vogel of Los Angeles welcomed the high court's 
action, saying the new rules could both ease the justices' workload and speed 
the overall lawyer-discipline process. "We're very, very pleased," Vogel said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed rules have been approved by the State Bar and now will be 
circulated to local Bar associations for further comment. Final adoption of new 
rules could come by January, a court spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's action follows the court's adoption last month of rules that, as of 
Dec. 1, will give the State Bar similar power to impose punishment in 
uncontested cases. But those cases, while more numerous than contested cases, 
have been handled by the court without time-consuming argument and opinions. 
</P>
<P>
The State Bar Court, made up of nine full-time judges selected by the Supreme 
Court, was created by the Legislature in 1988 to replace a system in which 
part-time, volunteer attorneys heard and resolved complaints against lawyers 
for breaking the law, mishandling funds, neglecting clients and other 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 complaints are being filed annually charging errant conduct 
among the state's 124,000 lawyers. Last year, a record 89 disbarments and 221 
suspensions were recommended by Bar officials.

Assemblyman Tom Hayden, seeking to separate his own political ambitions from 
the fate of Proposition 128, announced Saturday that he will not be a candidate 
in 1992 for the environmental advocate post that would be created by the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica Democrat is one of the principal sponsors of the sweeping 
environmental initiative called "Big Green" by its backers and "The Hayden 
Initiative" by opponents. On Thursday, the Proposition 128 campaign disclosed 
that he had loaned $830,000 of his money to help win passage of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"I just feel that the voters really ought to be free to decide on Big Green on 
the merits of the issues, phasing out cancer-causing pesticides and other toxic 
chemicals," Hayden said in an interview. "I am not on the (statewide) ballot in 
November and I won't be two years from now." 
</P>
<P>
Among its many provisions, Proposition 128 would ban at least 20 cancer-causing 
pesticides and seek to reduce the use of chemicals that contribute to global 
warming and destruction of the ozone layer. It also would create the position 
of California environmental advocate to enforce the state's environmental laws. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Hayden had said publicly that running for the post was an 
option that he was considering if the measure won. But in deciding to loan the 
campaign such a huge sum of his money, he said, he realized he had to make it 
clear he had no personal stake in the passage of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that if I gave a major loan or contribution to the campaign, the other 
side would assert it was because I had a self-interest and I wanted to remove 
that altogether," he said. "I want to be thought of as an environmental 
crusader, not as a career politician." 
</P>
<P>
The opposition campaign, financed largely by oil and chemical companies, has 
focused heavily on the onetime anti-war radical's central role in putting 
Proposition 128 on the ballot. Commercial after commercial has branded the 
measure "The Hayden Initiative." 
</P>
<P>
"As I've watched the campaign unfold, I've felt that the lies and distortions 
of the chemical companies needed to be answered," he said. "My name is Hayden, 
not Hayden Initiative."

BISHOPS REAFFIRM PRIESTLY CELIBACY AT VATICAN SYNOD; 
</P>
<P>
RELIGION: DELEGATES ENDING A MONTHLONG INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ECHO PAPAL 
CONSERVATISM ON THE ISSUES.

<P>
A monthlong international synod of Roman Catholic bishops ended here Saturday 
on an assertive, traditional note, effectively closing the door to any prospect 
of liberalization in the celibate male priesthood during the papacy of John 
Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
The synod's officially secret conclusions reaffirm the tight Vatican rein on 
the church that has become a hallmark of John Paul's rule. In a month of 
speeches and in their conclusions, the 237 bishops echoed papal conservatism on 
issues of doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters at the end of the congress on issues regarding priests, 
bishop-delegates said Saturday that the synod forwarded 41 proposals to the 
Pope. Their theme, the bishops made plain, is not how to change the priesthood, 
but how to fortify the institution in its current form. 
</P>
<P>
The synod is a consultative rather than a deliberative body. John Paul II is 
free to accept or discard its proposals. Vatican officials say the Pope will 
weigh them in formulating an exhortation on priestly formation to be released 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
Among the synod's suggestions is a one-year course in general education and 
spiritual training for candidates for the priesthood before they enter 
seminaries. The bishops also call for continuing formal education for priests 
after ordination. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the proposals urge the Pope to reassert celibacy as a cornerstone of 
the priesthood. Celibacy, delegates told reporters, is here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be honest and to remove any doubt about celibacy of priests. We 
must not give any false impression among candidates for the priesthood, and 
among priests themselves," said American delegate Bishop John P. Foley, 
stressing synod support for the church tradition of priestly celibacy. 
</P>
<P>
Theologians in the United States, Europe and Latin America have long suggested 
reconsideration of the question of creating a married clergy, saying that it 
would strengthen the church at a time of a serious lack of vocations and a 
diminishing number of priests in some countries. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican rejects even debating the idea. On Saturday, the 70-year-old 
pontiff, whose backing of celibacy is unflinching, thanked delegates for their 
support. 
</P>
<P>
"The synod has unequivocally confirmed the choice of priestly celibacy," the 
Pope said with satisfaction. "Some people have asked if it wouldn't be possible 
in some circumstances to consider the ordination of mature married men of 
proven Christian virtue. This solution is not to be taken into consideration. . 
. . We must respond with other means." 
</P>
<P>
During the synod, Vatican officials told diplomats that media coverage of 
celibacy is disproportionate to its place in the deliberations. The Pope made 
the same point Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"As is well known, the possibility of appealing for the ordination of proven 
Christian men is too often evoked within the framework of a systematic 
propaganda which is hostile to priestly celibacy. Such propaganda finds support 
and complicity in some mass media," John Paul II told his bishops. 
</P>
<P>
During the synod, bishops learned that two elderly married Brazilians, who 
promised to forswear sexual relations with their wives, had been ordained in 
areas where priests were scarce. The Vatican quickly made clear that those 
cases were the rare exception to the rule. 
</P>
<P>
Catholics who support the idea of married priests say it would regularize 
irregular relations between priests and women in many countries and 
reincorporate into the church thousands of former priests who abandoned their 
calling to get married. Many would return if they could, these supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, American Bishop Donald W. Wuerl of Pittsburgh, a synod delegate, met 
in Santa Clara, Calif., with a group of married former priests. The meeting 
raised eyebrows here and drew a quick letter of inquiry from the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
Vatican observers say the letter was at least a tacit rebuke to Wuerl. They say 
its dispatch to a prelate who is among the most traditional of American bishops 
is eloquent testimony not only of official firmness on celibacy, but also of 
John Paul's entrenched conservatism and his determination to enforce central 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
Its formal deliberations ended, the synod closes officially today with a Mass 
concelebrated by the Pope and his bishops and an address by the departing 
bishops to Catholics around the world.

NEW ZEALAND VOTERS DEAL RULING LABOR PARTY A RESOUNDING DEFEAT

Voters booted out New Zealand's Labor Party on Saturday, humiliating Prime 
Minister Mike Moore and giving the opposition National Party the biggest 
election victory in more than half a century. 
</P>
<P>
Labor's rout after six turbulent years in power was just the disaster that 
Moore had promised to avert when he took the party leadership from Geoffrey 
Palmer only eight weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very short honeymoon. Not even a one-night stand, was it?" a 
crestfallen Moore said after conceding defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Provisional results brought sweet revenge for National Party leader Jim Bolger, 
long portrayed by Labor as a bumbling farmer unfit to lead the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Both Labor and the National Party had pledged to continue the country's 
anti-nuclear policy, adopted in 1984 under former Prime Minister David Lange. 
It bars nuclear-powered ships and ships with nuclear weapons from making port 
calls, and it led to an estrangement in ties with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The United States in 1986 cut high-level contacts with New Zealand and dropped 
the country from the ANZUS military alliance, which also includes Australia. 
</P>
<P>
The National Party, however, promised to seek some sort of reconciliation with 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Nine of the 18 Labor Cabinet ministers lost their seats in Parliament as voters 
showed their frustration over record unemployment, high interest rates and an 
economy mired in recession. 
</P>
<P>
The center-right National Party took 68 of the 97 seats while Labor's 
representation was halved, to just 28.

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, citing hints of a change in the attitude 
of Iraqi leaders, Saturday urged the worldwide alliance against Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein not to panic into war but to keep up the search for a peaceful 
solution to the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leader did not detail his evidence for some kind of softening of the 
Iraqi position, but he told a news conference in the middle of his three-day 
official visit to Spain: "There are some signs that there is an awareness in 
the high circles of Iraq that they cannot find a solution through ultimatums. 
Perhaps I am wrong. In the next few days, perhaps this will be clearer." 
</P>
<P>
He did not explain why the situation might become clearer then. However, his 
special envoy Yevgeny Primakov, who has been traveling through Europe and the 
Middle East in search of a peaceful way out of the crisis, was en route to 
Baghdad on Saturday on his second visit there in a month. 
</P>
<P>
Primakov's mission prompted a change in timing at the United Nations in New 
York, where diplomatic sources said members of the Security Council reached 
agreement Saturday on a resolution demanding that Iraq permit the resupply of 
beleaguered embassies in Kuwait city. The resolution would also establish an 
initial framework for claims against Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the 15 council nations were already seated at their circular 
table, documents in hand and ready to vote on the 10th anti-Iraq resolution 
since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, when Soviet Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov 
rushed up to confer with U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering, Associated Press 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
They met privately with the French, British and Chinese ambassadors, and then 
the Soviets requested a suspension of the vote until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, a senior State Department official said the Soviet Union asked 
for a postponement to give Primakov time for one more attempt to reach a 
peaceful settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need it passed tonight," the American official said. "As a practical 
matter, Monday is soon enough." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev hinted that a solution to the gulf crisis might come from the Arab 
countries themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps the moment has come," he said, "for the Arab world to become fully 
involved and give its word." 
</P>
<P>
The recent Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who warned Hussein in a speech Friday 
not to interpret the search for a diplomatic solution as a sign of weakness or 
of acceptance of Iraqi aggression against Kuwait, was eloquent in his plea for 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the situation in the gulf as "very dangerous," Gorbachev said: "We 
must not force a military solution. We cannot say what the consequences of this 
approach would be. . . . We must not forget that the people of Iraq would be 
killed -- women, children, elderly. It's not only a question of the team of 
Saddam Hussein." 
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the Soviet Union has 3,000 citizens in Iraq, as well. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leader left no doubt about his condemnation of the Iraqi aggression. 
And, even while searching for a peaceful solution, he said, "We must maintain 
firmness." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, insisting that there is "no need to panic," said the alliance 
against Iraq is controlling the situation. And he warned: "Saddam Hussein is 
not going to divide us. If he thinks like this, he is very wrong. We are not 
going to give up our principles on this issue." 
</P>
<P>
Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, who shared the news conference with 
Gorbachev, said he agrees completely with the Soviet leader's position. He 
added only that he also believes that the United States, while trying to stop 
Iraqi aggression, "must solve the other problems of the region at the same 
time." 
</P>
<P>
This was an obvious attempt by Gonzalez to link the Iraqi crisis with the 
longstanding Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a connection rejected by the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a Spanish official reported that Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze had indicated a change in Iraq's position to his Spanish 
counterpart, Francisco Fernandez Ordonez. Shevardnadze said without elaborating 
that Iraq is "searching for some kind of dialogue," according to the Spanish 
official. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet and Spanish leaders held their news conference Saturday after 
signing a series of accords, the most important granting the Soviet Union a 
$1.5-billion loan from Spain over the next three years. The money will be used 
to buy Spanish foodstuffs, manufactured products, services and technology. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez described the loan as "an investment in perestroika," referring to 
Gorbachev's restructuring program in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Spaniards, who went through a transition from dictatorship to democracy 15 
years ago, feel great sympathy for the travails of the Soviets in their own 
transition. 
</P>
<P>
Calling on this sympathy, Gorbachev told Spanish journalists, "In the last five 
years, we have started a process of change that has taken other countries 
centuries to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to change our way of life, our economic system, our political 
processes, and to make these changes, we have to change ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
But he also said, while discussing the loan: "We are not asking for charity . . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who will leave for Paris today after touring the site for the 1992 
Olympic Games in Barcelona and attending various ceremonies there, has enjoyed 
an enthusiastic reception in Madrid. Many Spaniards clearly look on him as a 
hero who is leading his country through a transition to democracy much as King 
Juan Carlos I led Spain in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The enthusiasm was demonstrated in the heart of the city Saturday morning when 
Gorbachev, accompanied by his wife Raisa, laid a wreath at the monument for 
those who lost their lives for Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Spaniards shrieked in delight when the Soviet leader moved into the 
crowd to shake hands.

<P>
DIPLOMACY: HE TELLS LEADERS OF 11 ISLAND NATIONS THAT THE U.S. WON'T USE AN 
ATOLL SOUTH OF HAWAII AS A PERMANENT DISPOSAL SITE.

<P>
President Bush welcomed leaders from 11 Pacific island nations to a hastily 
called summit meeting in Hawaii on Saturday and sought to reassure them that 
his Administration will not turn a controversial chemical weapons incinerator 
south of Hawaii into a permanent hazardous waste site. 
</P>
<P>
Island leaders said they were happy for the assurances, but they gave Bush a 
stern lecture about the importance of environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
"We are happy for the assurances that have been given," said Cook Islands Prime 
Minister Geoffrey Henry, speaking for the 11 leaders. But, said Henry, the 
environment "is all we've got." 
</P>
<P>
"You've got the oil, you've got the gold. You've got all the minerals in the 
world. We in the Pacific have just the clear air that we have, the clear water 
that we swim in and fish in and eat out of. That's all God . . . chose to give 
the people of this part of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Henry also chided the Administration for its go-slow approach toward global 
warming, a serious concern for leaders of countries that likely would disappear 
under the waves entirely if, as some scientists fear, sea levels rise as a 
result of a warming of the Earth's climate. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of a chemical weapons incinerator on Johnston Atoll, a small 
island about 800 miles southwest of Hawaii, has become a focal point for 
environmental concerns in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military is shipping about 100,000 nerve-gas artillery shells from 
Germany to the atoll, which already holds about 300,000 chemical weapons 
shipped there from Okinawa and other Pacific points. The 100,000 shells en 
route represent about 3% of the U.S. chemical arsenal, Administration officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific leaders from Tarawa to New Zealand have objected to U.S. plans to store 
and incinerate chemical weapons on the atoll, fearing that the United States 
will use it as a permanent dump site rather than building chemical incinerators 
on the U.S. mainland. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't Make Our Pacific Your Cesspool," urged a sign held by one of a group of 
about 100 demonstrators outside the University of Hawaii's East-West Center, 
where the talks were held. 
</P>
<P>
Bush rejected the idea of closing the site, saying that "our ability to move 
ahead and destroy chemical weapons is a significant step toward disarmament and 
peace." He pledged, however, "stringent environmental controls" and promised 
that after the current shipment arrives early next month, no more weapons will 
be sent to the island from outside the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no plans to use Johnston Atoll for any other chemical munitions 
purpose," such as destroying the large chemical stockpiles currently stored in 
the mainland United States, "or as a hazardous waste disposal site," Bush said 
in a closed session of the summit meeting, according to a text of his remarks 
released by the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also pledged additional investment aid for the islands, saying he is aware 
that the crisis in the Persian Gulf has greatly increased their energy costs. 
</P>
<P>
The Overseas Private Investment Corp., a government-funded agency designed to 
spur private investments overseas, will put $300 million into two funds for the 
Pacific islands, a $200-million venture capital fund and a $100-million 
environmental investment fund, Bush said. In addition, OPIC will organize a 
trip for American investors to Pacific island countries next year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush scheduled the meeting only a few weeks ago, tacking it onto a previously 
planned trip to Hawaii to campaign for Republican Senate candidate Pat Saiki. 
The hasty scheduling drew some skepticism from island leaders, but Henry said 
he viewed the meeting as a "good start." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Henry, the summit was attended by government leaders from the 
Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Western Samoa, 
Nauru, Tonga, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Kiribati, which combined have a 
population of about 1.5 million, and Papua New Guinea with a population of 
about 3.5 million.

Talks opened between Moldova's government and a minority group bent on 
secession Saturday as the Kremlin ordered troops into the area to prevent 
ethnic grievances from escalating into bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
One day after Moldova clamped a state of emergency on the region where about 
150,000 Turkic-speaking Gagauzi live, deputies from the southern Soviet 
republic's parliament met in the town of Chimishliya with the self-styled 
"Provisional Committee of the Gagauz Republic." 
</P>
<P>
Those negotiations produced no immediate compromise on Gagauzi demands for 
autonomy or Moldova's insistence on its territorial integrity. But they were 
the first real attempt at dialogue since the Gagauzi, claiming they were 
victims of Moldovan discrimination, proclaimed independence in August. 
</P>
<P>
Grounds for worry remained, however, and even the Soviet government voiced its 
concern. According to officials in the republic -- formerly called Moldavia -- 
on the Soviet-Romanian border, as many as 40,000 nationalists bent on snuffing 
out the Gagauzi threat to Moldovan sovereignty gathered near the group's 
strongholds, many spoiling for a fight. 
</P>
<P>
According to Soviet press reports, "volunteers" armed with clubs and iron bars 
packed roads leading to the southern districts of Komrat and Chadyr-Lunga, 
where there are large numbers of Gagauzi, a predominantly Christian people that 
ethnographers believe came to Moldova from Bulgaria in the 18th Century while 
fleeing Turkish rule. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone communications with the Gagauz area were also cut, and residents 
there were reportedly digging trenches for self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
Both Gagauz and Moldovan leaders, however, seemed anxious to avert violence. 
Moldova's president, Mirca Snegur, called on his compatriots to stop sending 
"volunteers" to challenge the Gagauzi, and Soviet television said he assured 
Moscow officials they would be dispersed. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, the Soviet government said both Snegur and Gagauzi leaders 
requested troops be dispatched the area to "increase protection for law and 
order," apparently as neutral parties to keep the Gagauzi and the 
Romanian-speaking Moldovans apart. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin, which has been criticized both for its actions and its inaction in 
the country's many ethnic disputes, placed a Soviet Interior Ministry regiment 
in Kishinev, Moldova's capital, under the command of the republic's government, 
the official Tass news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Judging by its dispatch, Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov has been put in 
charge while President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is visiting Spain and France, and 
he and his entourage were worried about what might happen in Moldova. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leadership assesses the situation as "fraught with unpredictable 
consequences," Tass reported. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts by the Gagauzi to hold elections for their own parliament caused the 
showdown, as well as Friday's decision by the Moldovan legislature to declare a 
two-month state of emergency in areas claimed by the "Gagauz Republic," and 
shut down governmental bodies there. 
</P>
<P>
The Gagauzi are only one of the concerns of Moldova's leadership. Alarmed like 
the Gagauzi by a law passed this year that makes Romanian the republic's 
official language, ethnic Russians, Ukrainians and other migrants in the east 
proclaimed the "Dniester Republic." 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of that would-be entity have expressed support for the Gagauzi, seeing 
in them allies against the Moldovans. Authorities, however, headed off their 
bid to help the Gagauzi by halting a convoy of several dozen vehicles as they 
ferried "volunteers" from the predominantly Russian city of Tiraspol to Komrat 
in the Gagauz area, Tass said.

Local officials joined protesters Saturday to block tanks rehearsing for the 
Nov. 7 Revolution Day parade in Moscow, the Soviet daily newspaper Izvestia 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators jumped in front of the tanks as they drove down Moscow's Ring 
Road, which had been cleared of traffic for the overnight rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
One man, Lev Shemaev, a leader of the radical Moscow Voters' Assn., lay down in 
front of the column of tanks. Neither he nor anyone else was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
A Moscow military commander ordered the demonstrators to clear the road, 
Izvestia said. They did so after about half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot put up with tanks rolling in Moscow," Alexander Osovtsev, a member 
of the Moscow City Council, told Izvestia. The protesters also included 
deputies from the Russian Federation parliament, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The radical Moscow City Council has refused to finance the capital's parade 
this year, leaving the Soviet national Parliament to provide the money. 
</P>
<P>
Revolution Day, which celebrates the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, is the most 
important holiday on the Soviet calendar.

The revamped East German Communist Party, fighting to survive a financial 
scandal, voted to keep Gregor Gysi as its leader but moved to give up its 
controversial property holdings. The arrest of two senior members of the 
renamed Party of Democratic Socialism for diverting $71 million in party funds 
to accounts in Moscow has dealt a severe blow to the party's new reformist 
image. The scandal also appears likely to hurt the party's chances in elections 
for an all-German parliament on Dec. 2.

Lebanese newspapers published birthday letters to American Terry A. Anderson on 
Saturday, his 43rd birthday and his sixth in captivity. One newspaper reported 
that fellow hostage Terry Waite will be freed soon. 
</P>
<P>
Seven newspapers printed birthday greetings to Anderson from his sister, Peggy 
Say, his youngest daughter, Sulome, and Madeleine, Sulome's mother. They 
published the original English text so that Anderson, who did not know Arabic 
when he was kidnaped, would be able to read them if his kidnapers allow him to. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for the Associated Press, is the 
longest-held of the 11 Western hostages in Lebanon. He was kidnaped March 16, 
1985, by a pro-Iranian group known as Islamic Jihad. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Al Diyar, meanwhile, said British hostage Terry Waite will be 
freed either "by the end of this month or within the first half of the coming 
November, at the latest." 
</P>
<P>
The short, front-page report attributed the information to an unnamed security 
source. The conservative Al Diyar is not known to have special insight into the 
hostage issue, but the report was the latest predicting Waite's release since 
Iran and Britain agreed Sept. 27 to restore diplomatic ties. 
</P>
<P>
Waite, 51, an Anglican Church envoy, was kidnaped Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving 
his West Beirut hotel to negotiate with representatives of Anderson's 
kidnapers. Like Anderson, he is believed to be held by Islamic Jihad.

Soldiers raided illegal gold mines in the Amazon jungle and arrested more than 
300 people, mostly foreigners, Venezuelan Foreign Affairs Minister Reinaldo 
Figueredo said. Most of the illegal miners apprehended were taken to Puerto 
Ayacucho, a jungle outpost on the Orinoco River, where they are to be tried on 
charges of damaging the environment, authorities said. Since last year, 
officials have made more than 1,000 arrests in attempting to staunch an

LOOPHOLE IN LAW ALLOWS CONCEALING OF ADS' BACKERS, COMMISSION RULES 
</P>

<P>
The Fair Political Practices Commission has ruled that legislative leaders 
Willie Brown and David A. Roberti and the alcohol industry can air political 
ads that conceal financial backing. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on a complaint from political watchdog groups, the commission on Friday 
said it will not stop opponents of Propositions 131 and 140, the term-limit 
initiatives on the Nov. 6 ballot, from running a controversial ad featuring 
actress Angela Lansbury even though it fails to identify its financial backers 
-- political committees organized by Assembly Speaker Brown (D-San Francisco) 
and Senate President Pro tem Roberti (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Baugher, the commission's executive director, said that although state 
laws were intended to require the disclosure of major funding sources behind 
political ads, they contain an "unintended loophole" that exempts commercials 
whose content deals equally with two initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
"The words in the (Angela Lansbury) ad appear to have been carefully chosen so 
as to create the impression that the ad refers equally to both initiatives," 
Baugher said. "The producers of this ad have obviously tried to take advantage 
of this loophole." He conceded that the decision had been a close call and 
others "may reasonably disagree." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the commission staff said a radio advertisement produced by anti-tax 
groups that fails to disclose alcoholic beverage interests as their prime 
financial backers seems to be in compliance with state law. 
</P>
<P>
The staff said the commercial's content appears to be "evenly divided" between 
Propositions 136 and 137. Proposition 136 rewrites tax law to mandate a 
two-thirds vote by the people to raise special or single-purpose taxes and 
would make it extremely difficult to hike alcohol taxes. Proposition 137 
requires a public vote on any changes in laws governing initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
The latest decision does not affect an earlier commission ruling regarding 
political ads aired by alcohol interests that promote Proposition 126, a 
proposal for a small increase in beer, wine and liquor taxes, and oppose 
Proposition 134, an initiative providing for substantial increases in those 
taxes. In that case, the commission said the industry would have to make full 
disclosure because the exemption applies only to initiatives. Proposition 126 
was put on the ballot by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman John Larson said the commission would begin examining ways to close 
the loophole at its next meeting Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling coincided with the filing of financial reports that showed the 
alcoholic beverage industry and tobacco interests have funneled nearly $3 
million in the last month into the campaign to pass 136. 
</P>
<P>
Lenny Goldberg, campaign director for Californians Against Initiative Fraud, a 
coalition opposing the initiative, said the commission's ruling will make it 
harder now for his organization to defeat the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
"Disclosure that the alcohol industry is behind this would blow Proposition 136 
completely out of the water," he said.

ELLIOTT ROOSEVELT, 80; BOOK BY SON OF FDR STIRRED FUROR

Elliott Roosevelt, a son of former President Franklin D. Roosevelt and 
best-selling author who caused a stir when he revealed details of his parents' 
private life, died Saturday in Scottsdale, Ariz. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
Roosevelt died of congestive heart failure at his home, said his wife, 
Patricia. 
</P>
<P>
In "An Untold Story," the first of three books on the Roosevelt family, he drew 
the wrath of his siblings and many critics for revealing his parents' marital 
problems and FDR's relationship with his former secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Roosevelt criticized history's view of his parents in the 1973 book, writing: 
"These legendary beings, immune to frailty and human passion, are not the 
father we children loved, nor the mother we respected." 
</P>
<P>
Born Sept. 23, 1910, in New York City, Roosevelt worked on a Wyoming dude ranch 
as a child and later owned a cattle ranch in Colorado. He dabbled in 
advertising and radio, and was a former mayor of Miami Beach and a Democratic 
National Committeeman from Florida. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II, he commanded the multinational aerial reconnaissance wing 
that played a key role in the Allies' D-Day landings in France, as well as the 
invasions of North Africa and Sicily. He flew 89 missions, was wounded twice 
and was decorated for valor by the United States, France, Morocco and England. 
</P>
<P>
He launched his writing career in 1946 with the best-selling book, "As He Saw 
It," about his experiences as an aide to his father at five historic wartime 
summit meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he turned to mystery, using his mother, Eleanor, as a sleuth sniffing 
out crime in the White House. "Murder in the Rose Garden," published last year, 
began with the discovery of the body of a well-known Washington hostess on the 
White House grounds. Several more books will be published posthumously. 
</P>
<P>
Roosevelt is survived by his wife; a brother, James, of Newport Beach; eight 
children; 21 grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Memorial services will be held Tuesday in Scottsdale.

HORSE RACING: TOP FILLY GO FOR WAND IS DESTROYED AFTER INJURY IN THE STRETCH OF

About 100 yards from the finish line at Belmont Park, roughly halfway between 
the horseshoe-shaped hedges that mark the grave sites of Ruffian and Timely 
Writer, racing lost another of its best Saturday. Go For Wand, said by many to 
be the next Ruffian, followed that great filly to a death in the call of duty. 
</P>
<P>
Timely Writer was destroyed after breaking down at the top of the stretch in 
the 1982 Jockey Club Gold Cup. In 1975, an undefeated Ruffian broke down on the 
Belmont backstretch and never survived all-night surgery, the victim of a match 
race with Foolish Pleasure, the Kentucky Derby winner. Saturday's $1-million 
Breeders' Cup Distaff, a seven-horse race, also turned into a match race. Go 
For Wand and Bayakoa, the former trying to win horse of the year and the other 
trying to win the stake for the second year in a row, went eye to eye through 
the 1,097-foot stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a sixteenth of a mile from the finish, Go For Wand's right foreleg 
gave way, breaking at the ankle. The filly fell, horrifying the crowd of 51,236 
and sending her jockey, Randy Romero, over the top. 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa went on to victory, 6 3/4 lengths ahead of runner-up Colonial Waters, 
but few were joyous: Not Frank Whitham, theowner of Bayakoa; not Ron McAnally, 
Bayakoa's trainer; and not even the many bettors who cashed tickets on the 
6-year-old Argentine-bred mare. 
</P>
<P>
Go For Wand spent the first of her final few minutes under the inside fence, 
where she had rolled with her legs pointed upward. Romero was thrown clear and 
would ride later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Go For Wand struggled to her feet and wobbled diagonally across the track, 
instinctly moving in the direction of the finish line. She stopped in front of 
the outside fence. Before Bayakoa could be pulled up by Laffit Pincay and 
returned to the winner's circle, the track's horse van was parked in front of 
helpless Go For Wand. 
</P>
<P>
The large screen that is used when a horse is being destroyed was erected to 
shield the sight from the crowd. The lethal injection works in seconds. "She 
suffered a major breakdown in her right front ankle," said Neil Cleary, a 
Belmont veterinarian. "She ruptured ligaments in her ankle and suspensory 
(ligament) apparatus." 
</P>
<P>
The afternoon will be most vividly remembered for the deaths of Go For Wand and 
Mr. Nickerson, a horse who apparently suffered a heart attack in the Sprint, 
the first race of the day. But, for the record, the other winners were 
Unbridled in the Classic; the European runners In The Wings and Royal Academy 
in the grass races; Fly So Free and Meadow Star in the juvenile stakes and 
Safely Kept in the Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
In her box seat, Jane du Pont Lunger, 76, who owns Go For Wand, turned away in 
shock at the sight of possible joy melting into disaster, her family in tears 
around her. Lunger, a superstitious woman, had not worn her lucky mud-caked 
shoes from Saratoga, the first time in four of Go For Wand's races she was 
without them. 
</P>
<P>
After Go For Wand had breathed her last, trainer Billy Badgett and his wife of 
less than a month -- Rose Badgett has been the filly's exercise rider -- left 
the track, Badgett stone-faced and his wife in tears. At the gate leading to 
the barn area, Badgett asked a security guard, a longtime softball-playing 
friend, to keep reporters away. 
</P>
<P>
"You can understand," the guard said. "Billy quit playing softball to start 
training. He said the horse was the fittest horse he had ever had in his life. 
He said he couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
An hour later, at Go For Wand's barn, Badgett's father told reporters that his 
son had left. 
</P>
<P>
"She warmed up good and didn't take any bad steps," Romero said. "She's always 
been as sound as a dollar. But then she just snapped her leg off. I had a lot 
of horse left and I was going to win. It's too bad, because this was a super 
filly." 
</P>
<P>
In the Sprint, Shaker Knit, near the rear of the field and trailing Mr. 
Nickerson as they moved into the far turn, also fell and suffered a spinal-cord 
injury. "We will have to make a decision," said Steve DiMauro, Shaker Knit's 
trainer. "He is in shock and has lost his sense of balance." 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Nickerson's jockey, Chris Antley, suffered a broken right collarbone and 
was hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Nickerson's apparent heart attack could have happened to any horse at any 
track, but the breakdown of Go For Wand is another symptom in a season-long 
pattern at Belmont. At least six horses have broken down at the track in the 
last two weeks; Criminal Type, the Wayne Lukas-trained horse-of-the-year 
candidate, suffered a career-ending ankle injury in the Jockey Club Gold Cup; 
and early last week Hey Hey Paula, a promising Lukas filly, had to be destroyed 
after breaking down during morning training. Gorgeous, who would have been the 
third betting choice in the Distaff, suffered a chipped bone in a knee during a 
morning gallop Friday and has been retired. 
</P>
<P>
"These are statistical abnormalities," said Gerry McKeon, the track president. 
"We have had different injuries in different parts of the track. These kind of 
things even out over the course of a year." 
</P>
<P>
Early Saturday, Lukas scratched Deposit Ticket, part of his two-horse entry in 
the Juvenile, because of a shin injury. 
</P>
<P>
"The horse is about 80%, and you should be 100% for races like this," Lukas 
said before Go For Wand went down. "Not only that, I don't want to take a 
chance with this valuable of a horse on a track where so many things are 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
After the Distaff, Lukas was more emphatic and said: "They need a serious 
review. The whole world is watching, and this isn't what racing is supposed to 
be. There's something wrong out there." 
</P>
<P>
McAnally said that some of the breakdowns involved cheap horses who might not 
be as sound as stakes runners. 
</P>
<P>
"Belmont's always been a safe track," McAnally said. "Accidents happen 
everywhere. Look at Golden Pheasant, (trainer) Charlie Whittingham's horse. He 
got hurt at Santa Anita and couldn't run in the Breeders' Cup. I don't think 
you can blame the (Belmont) track. They're doing the best they can." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Day, who rode Unbridled to victory, didn't think the track was dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"It was cuppy early in the day, and then they added some water and tightened it 
up," Day said. "No matter how long you're in racing, you never get used to 
seeing what happened to Go For Wand. My heart goes out to the people connected 
with Go for Wand and Mr. Nickerson." 
</P>
<P>
Sitting beside Day, Carl Nafzger, Unbridled's trainer, said: "There wasn't a 
person in the grandstand who didn't want to cry."

UNBRIDLED REGAINS TOUCH IN CLASSIC; 
</P>
<P>
HORSE RACING: WINNER ENDS A DROUGHT DATING TO THE KENTUCKY DERBY BY SQUEEZING 
BETWEEN IBN BEY AND THIRTY SIX RED TO WIN $3-MILLION EVENT.

<P>
Unbridled, the 3-year-old colt who lost the winning touch after taking the 
Kentucky Derby in May, won the $3-million Breeders' Cup Classic by one length 
over Ibn Bey Saturday at Belmont Park, thrusting himself back into the 
horse-of-the-year picture. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Nafzger, Unbridled's trainer, cast his vote for the colt as horse of the 
year, but Nafzger doesn't have a vote. Those who do -- about 200 turf writers, 
Daily Racing Form representatives and track racing secretaries -- have these 
horses to consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Unbridled, who won the big race at the beginning and the end of the year. 
He also won the Florida Derby, but otherwise he won only one allowance race in 
eight starts. Saturday's victory was his first in five stakes starts since the 
Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Criminal Type, who raced from coast to coast, winning four consecutive 
major stakes and numbering Sunday Silence, Easy Goer and Housebuster among his 
victims. Criminal Type missed the Breeders' Cup because of injury. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Meadow Star, whose five-length victory in Saturday's Breeders' Cup Juvenile 
Fillies extended her undefeated string to seven races. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Go For Wand, who was destroyed after breaking down about 100 yards from 
home in a fierce duel with Bayakoa in the Breeders' Cup Distaff. Many voters 
favored Go For Wand for horse of the year before the Distaff, and she will 
still poll some sympathy votes. 
</P>
<P>
Reunited with jockey Pat Day, Unbridled overcame his outside post position in a 
14-horse field. They were in 12th place after three-quarters of a mile in the 1 
1/4-mile race before Day moved Unbridled along the rail at the top of the 
stretch, then squeezed him between Thirty Six Red and Ibn Bey with about a 
sixteenth of a mile to run. 
</P>
<P>
Ibn Bey, a 38-1 shot from England, finished second, a length in front of Thirty 
Six Red, who nosed out Lively One for third place. Rhythm, the 5-2 favorite, 
finished eighth and other disappointments in the Classic were Flying 
Continental and Dispersal, who finished 11th and 12th, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The Breeders' Cup's international selection panel, which was under fire from 
trainer Gary Jones because his Quiet American was excluded from the Classic, 
may have had the last laugh. There had been suggestions that Ibn Bey and Lively 
One lacked the credentials to be included in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled, coupled in the betting with Home at Last, who was eased by his 
jockey, Jerry Bailey, after having no chance in the stretch, paid $15.20 to win 
and was timed in a slow 2:02 1/5. 
</P>
<P>
Day won the first Classic with another longshot, Wild Again, at Hollywood Park 
in 1984. He has won five Breeders' Cup races, one fewer than Laffit Pincay, who 
won aboard Bayakoa on Saturday. Jose Santos, the only jockey to win two 
Breeders' Cup races Saturday, also has five victory in the seven-year-old 
series. 
</P>
<P>
After winning the Florida Derby on Unbridled, Day switched to Summer Squall, 
and they finished second behind Unbridled in the Kentucky Derby. Summer Squall 
missed the Classic because in New York he could not run with the medication he 
uses for a bleeding problem, and the mount on Unbridled opened up when Craig 
Perret, who was on the colt in the Kentucky Derby, stayed with Rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew this horse had one short run," Day said. "He had to overcome a lot, 
with that post position, but there was a narrow opening in the stretch and he 
showed a tremendous amount of courage and got the money." 
</P>
<P>
First place was worth $1.35 million to owner Frances Genter, who is in her 90s. 
She attended the Kentucky Derby but was not among the 51,236 at Belmont Park 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled is also a bleeder, but Nafzger has been able to run him twice in New 
York without medication. The trainer said the colt was dehydrated Saturday much 
like he was in June when he finished fourth in the Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
Nafzger said that Unbridled is finished for the year and will resume running 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty Six Red, at 29-1, set swift early fractions, running six furlongs in 
1:09 4/5 and the mile in 1:35 3/5. He had a two-length lead at the eighth pole 
before Ibn Bey, running for the first time on dirt, and Unbridled passed him. 
Lively One had traffic problems at the head of the stretch and his trainer, 
Charlie Whittingham, said they might have won if the horse could have gotten 
through. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in great position at the quarter pole, and we were really flying," said 
Alex Solis, who rode Lively One. "But then I had to take up. I got bumped 
around and we lost all chance."

AUBURN CAN'T KICK AFTER 17-16 VICTORY; 
</P>
<P>
SEC: TIGERS BEAT MISSISSIPPI STATE WHEN CRAWFORD BLOCKS CONVERSION ATTEMPT.

Auburn Coach Pat Dye wasn't a bit surprised. 
</P>
<P>
Darrel Crawford blocked Joel Logan's conversion kick with 2 1/2 minutes to 
play, preserving Auburn's 17-16 Southeastern Conference victory over 
Mississippi State Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Mississippi State certainly didn't surprise me. I guess I am the only one who 
thinks they have a good team," Dye said. "The game turned out exactly like I 
expected, but I hoped it wouldn't be that close at the end." 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi State, 3-4 overall and 0-4 in the SEC, had a chance to tie the 
Tigers (6-0-1, 3-0-1) after David Fair's two-yard run with 2:33 to play. But 
Crawford, a junior linebacker, batted down Logan's kick to preserve Auburn's 
unbeaten record. 
</P>
<P>
Fair's touchdown, on his only carry of the game, capped an 80-yard, nine-play 
drive keyed by a pass interference penalty on a third-and-10 play that gave the 
Bulldogs a first down at the Tiger 45. Fair scored six plays later. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn got what proved to be the margin of victory with 13:25 remaining in the 
game when Jim Von Wyl kicked a 20-yard field goal after a drive was halted at 
the Mississippi State three. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn outgained Mississippi State, 405-292, in handing the Bulldogs their 10th 
consecutive SEC defeat and ninth in a row against Dye. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how you could expect any more from our players," State Coach 
Rockey Felker said. "We came through and got the (final) touchdown when we 
needed it, but I'm not sure what happened on the extra point." 
</P>
<P>
Freshman quarterback Stan White directed two second-quarter scoring drives as 
Auburn overcame a 3-0 Mississippi State lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We moved the ball pretty well in the first half, we just couldn't quite get 
over that hump," White said. "We've been in this situation all year. It always 
seems to come down to one big play.

Darren Lewis became the Southwest Conference's all-time leading rusher 
Saturday, and Kevin Smith returned interceptions 35 and 78 yards for touchdowns 
as Texas A&amp;M rolled to a 41-15 victory over Rice. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis rushed 25 times for 176 yards to take the SWC career rushing lead at 
4,453 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' 54-yard run set up his own short scoring plunge to put the Aggies, 5-2-1 
overall and 2-1-1 in the SWC, on top, 24-12. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Dickerson of Southern Methodist owned the SWC career rushing mark of 4,450 
yards from 1979-82. Earl Campbell of Texas is third at 4,277. 
</P>
<P>
Trevor Cobb established one season rushing record for Rice (3-5, 1-4) by 
getting 132 yards in 29 carries to give him 970, breaking the record of 945 
yards in 1971 by Staley Vincent.

USC: FOLEY, SUBBING FOR MARINOVICH, OVERCOMES NERVOUSNESS, ARIZONA STATE 
DEFENSE IN 13-6 VICTORY.

<P>
The winner and still starter? Would you go for 50-50? 
</P>
<P>
Shane Foley was the victorious quarterback when USC beat Arizona State Saturday 
at Sun Devil Stadium, but there was no certainty about his future. It seems he 
suddenly has one after residing in the shadows of Todd Marinovich the first two 
months of the season. 
</P>
<P>
All Foley earned Saturday was incumbency. Coach Larry Smith was quick to point 
out after the Trojans' 13-6 victory that Foley is No. 1 on the depth chart 
heading into the new week of practice for next Saturday's game against 
California at the Coliseum. Without hesitation, though, came the kicker that 
the starting job is actually wide open should Marinovich's academic-related 
suspension be lifted. 
</P>
<P>
If this was a one-game resuscitation to a collegiate career in which Foley was 
once held out of a 1988 game the Trojans won here, 50-0, and in which he 
volunteered to play on the special teams to ensure himself a spot on the travel 
squad, there could be worse memories. 
</P>
<P>
Foley came through the buildup of unexpectedly replacing Marinovich to complete 
12 of 19 passes -- 10 fewer than he had thrown in his USC career coming in -- 
for 125 yards. He ran for 60 yards in 14 carries. The conservative, 
ball-control offense Smith and the coaching staff fit around their new leader 
worked so well that Foley easily outplayed his Arizona State counterpart, Paul 
Justin. 
</P>
<P>
Foley's longest completion was for 22 yards, to Travis Hannah late in the first 
half to help set up the only Trojan touchdown. Six of the remaining 11 
completions were for nine yards or less. And a 17-yarder in the third quarter 
was actually a short toss that tight end Yonnie Jackson turned into a sizeable 
gain. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not satisfied, really," Foley said later. "I had an OK day. We moved the 
ball on them, but our job is to get the ball into the end zone. . . . We held 
the ball and got a lot of first downs (30), but we didn't get into the end 
zone." 
</P>
<P>
The fifth-year senior stayed with the script pretty much the entire way, 
although he did change plays at the line a few times. One of the few times 
Foley deviated was after the methodical 17-play, 90-yard drive that led to the 
only touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"After the TD drive, he relaxed, even to the point that he got aggressive the 
next drive and hurt the offense a bit," said Ray Dorr, the Trojan quarterback 
coach. "He tried to take things the defense wasn't giving him. When he came 
over to the sideline, I got him on the phone. He settled back down." 
</P>
<P>
Dorr had spent the better part of Friday with Foley, six or eight hours of 
watching films of the Arizona State defense and going over the scouting report, 
so Dorr was able to read the emotional state of his new quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
The two spent some time together during the pregame meal Saturday. Foley spoke 
up. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked right at me," Dorr recalled. "He says to me, 'What do you think if 
we went in there 50% nervous?' I said, 'What do you mean? I'm not worried.' So 
he says, 'Yeah, but I'm nervous as hell.' But once he was able to make the 
moment humorous, I knew he would be OK." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, everything turned out fine. Foley's toughest task seemed to be 
getting through the crowd that had surrounded the tunnel leading to the locker 
room waiting to congratulate the new hero. The masses included his father, 
Mike, and his coach at Newport Harbor High, Mike Giddings, both of whom skipped 
the handshakes and went right to the hugs. 
</P>
<P>
One problem, though. Foley bruised his right hand after getting hit in the 
third quarter -- nothing serious, but painful enough that shaking everyone's 
hand caused more discomfort than the Sun Devil defense. 
</P>
<P>
The adulation hurt so good. He was glad to be in position to put up with the 
problem. Glad to be in a position of contributing to a victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Am I glad it's over?" said Shane Foley, the starting quarterback of record. "I 
don't know if it's all over."

BRUINS WILL TAKE WHATEVER THEY CAN GET; 
</P>
<P>
UCLA: GETTING BACK TO .500 IS GOOD, BUT A BOWL BID -- ANY BOWL BID -- WOULD BE 
BETTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Already laid low by the Wildcats and cuffed around by the Bears, UCLA left the 
Rose Bowl under the cover of darkness Saturday riding a one-game Pac-10 winning 
streak, courtesy of Oregon State. Leave it to the Beavers to help out. 
</P>
<P>
At UCLA, this has been the kind of year where progress is measured in small 
steps, such as the one the Bruins took in a 26-17 victory over Oregon State 
before 43,427 spectators and more than 60,000 empty seats in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
So it was left to Coach Terry Donahue to place the game in proper perspective: 
"Last year, we lost to that team. And today, we beat them. So, what the heck." 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins triumphed in something less than a heck of a game, but they weren't 
about to quibble over success. After finishing 3-7-1 last year, Donahue's worst 
season since he began coaching UCLA in 1976, the Bruins are 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
That's one small step for Bruin-kind. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an improvement," said quarterback Tommy Maddox. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, UCLA's hopes to play in a bowl game are still flickering. Even 
before the Bruins lost conference games at home to Arizona and on the road at 
California, Freedom Bowl director Don Anderson said the Bruins would be a top 
candidate for the game in Anaheim even at 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
From where center Lance Zeno stands, that sounds pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd be happy to go to any bowl game this year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Free safety Eric Turner was even more succinct: "A bowl is a bowl . . . after 
not going to one at all last year." 
</P>
<P>
Turner is in a minority on the Bruin defense. He is the only player to start 
every game on defense this year. Because of injury, Donahue has been forced to 
start eight different lineups in eight games. Key injuries to linebackers Rocen 
Keeton, Roman Phifer and Arnold Ale have kept UCLA's defense from operating at 
less than peak performance. 
</P>
<P>
Even against Oregon State (1-7), the Bruins' problems on defense did not 
disappear. Scrambling quarterback Matt Booher proved to be an elusive target. 
</P>
<P>
Booher led Bruin tacklers on many a merry chase. He ran for 51 yards, lost 42 
yards and finished with a net gain of nine yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody saw what was happening," Donahue said. "You guys in the press box 
are saying 'Gosh, why can't they tackle?' and I'm on the sidelines saying, 
'Gosh, why can't we tackle?' 
</P>
<P>
"We correct it by getting quicker, getting to the ball, getting off blocks and 
being able to play a little better," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
Maddox surely has had better days. He completed eight of 17 passes for 98 yards 
and didn't look sharp, but he was not about to start complaining. 
</P>
<P>
"It might not be much of a victory, but it is a victory," Maddox said. "Last 
year, that team beat us." 
</P>
<P>
Sadly for the Bruins, there are no more Beaver-caliber teams on the schedule. 
Next Saturday, UCLA plays Oregon (6-2) in Eugene and follows that with a game 
against Washington (7-1) in Seattle. UCLA finishes the regular season at home 
against USC. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the meat of the season for us," said Zeno, who was able to play only 
the second quarter because of strained tendons in his right foot. Zeno wore a 
special boot with a hard sole that would not permit his foot to bend. "These 
games will decide if we go to a bowl game or not, or if we have a winning 
season or not. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Williams, who made a reappearance at tailback, noted that UCLA has a 
chance, at least. 
</P>
<P>
"Realistically, we have to win all three of the games to make the season 
respectable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue has learned to deal with an up-and-down season, perhaps realizing it's 
better than a plain down season like a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"At times we look OK and other times we aren't very good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to improve on last year, which we've already done. We're a 
better-looking football team. We don't get blown out 42-7 to Arizona, we don't 
lose to Stanford and Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, we lost to California, true, but we're clearly a better team. We're also 
a long way from being a good football team. 
</P>
<P>
"To call the season a success now, how many games do we have to win? I don't 
know. I just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not, but winning the last three sure wouldn't hurt and the one UCLA got 
Saturday was a step in the right direction, however small.

When the United States Tennis Assn. decided to play the Davis Cup final on a 
clay surface, which player was consulted first: 
</P>
<P>
a) Andre Agassi 
</P>
<P>
b) Rick Leach 
</P>
<P>
c) Jim Pugh 
</P>
<P>
If you answered a), then you understand who is utmost in the USTA's mind. And 
it isn't the doubles team of b) Leach and c) Pugh, which doesn't really 
surprise b). 
</P>
<P>
"They sure didn't ask me first," Leach said. "I had an idea before that we 
might use clay, though. And I thought then it was a pretty good idea. But it's 
not our best surface, though." 
</P>
<P>
Far from it, actually. Clay is probably the worst surface for Leach and Pugh. 
But when the United States plays host to Australia in the Davis Cup final, Nov. 
30-Dec. 2, at the Suncoast Dome in St. Petersburg, Fla., the doubles team will 
be riding a one-match winning streak on clay. In fact, the United States 
wouldn't even be playing in its first Davis Cup final since 1984 if Leach and 
Pugh had not won their doubles match in the semifinals against Austria last 
month on slow clay in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
"After that match, we're pretty confident on clay," Leach said. "I think the 
match that we won in Vienna, we overcame a big obstacle." 
</P>
<P>
Leach said he and Pugh quickly understood that the U.S. decision to play on 
clay would be a smart move. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest factor is we've taken (Pat) Cash's biggest weapons away," Leach 
said. "We've kind of taken him out of the Davis Cup. And he could beat anyone 
in the world in Davis Cup." 
</P>
<P>
Cash favors courts with fast surfaces, especially grass, because of his 
serve-and-volley style. But that style is less effective on clay, where 
baseliners have the edge because the ball slows down when it bounces. 
</P>
<P>
"We might be able to win the final with Jimmy and I playing a match that really 
doesn't matter," Leach said. "If so, that would be great." 
</P>
<P>
But first, Leach and Pugh need to get their game back together. 
</P>
<P>
Since winning their important Davis Cup match in Vienna, they have lost 
consecutive first-round matches in ATP Tour events at Tokyo and Vienna. Both of 
those matches were played indoors on Supreme, which is a semi-fast surface that 
ought to favor Leach and Pugh. Maybe they should have stayed on clay. 
</P>
<P>
Leach and Pugh will be in Paris next week to play another indoor event on 
Supreme and try to shake out of their short slump. 
</P>
<P>
"The match against Austria did take something out of us," Leach said. "We got 
so up for it, we've kind of had a letdown since. There was so much pressure on 
us, I guess both of us were really tired after that." 
</P>
<P>
Sampras vs. Chang: Teen-age Grand Slam winners Pete Sampras and Michael Chang 
will meet in an exhibition, the Forum Tennis Challenge, Dec. 18. Sampras, 19, 
of Rancho Palos Verdes, is the youngest male player to win the U.S. Open. He 
beat Agassi in the final and defeated Thomas Muster, Ivan Lendl and John 
McEnroe in succession to get there. 
</P>
<P>
Chang won the 1989 French Open at 17 to become the youngest male player to earn 
a Grand Slam title. Chang, of Placentia, will join Agassi and the doubles team 
of Leach and Pugh when the U.S plays Australia in the Davis Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
Slims chances: Apparently, there is no way Jennifer Capriati won't be playing 
in the Virginia Slims Championships, not after all the strings have been pulled 
to get her there. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati, 14, is the beneficiary of a series of rules changes designed to make 
her eligible for the Championships, the women's season-ending event, Nov. 12-18 
at Madison Square Garden in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did the Women's International Tennis Council (WIPTC) change its rules 
and permit Capriati to turn pro before her 14th birthday in March, the WIPTC 
also allowed her to play more major tournaments. There wasn't much reaction to 
these moves, but the latest action has drawn widespread attention. 
</P>
<P>
The WIPTC made a third rule change for Capriati's sake earlier this month. She 
wanted to play a major tournament last week at Filderstadt, Germany, so she 
would earn enough tour points to ensure qualifying for the Championships. But 
the WIPTC noted that Capriati had already reached her limit of 10 major, or 
so-called "Tier II' events, and ruled that Capriati can play only minor, or 
"Tier IV" events, the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
So how would Capriati pick up enough points to stay in the top 16 who are 
eligible for the Championships? The WIPTC obligingly downgraded from Tier II to 
Tier IV an event in San Juan, Puerto Rico, thus making it a minor event. 
Capriati quickly entered and played in the tournament last week. 
</P>
<P>
She is on the bubble for qualifying, No. 15 in the latest points standings. It 
may well be that Capriati's eligibility is a non-issue, that Capriati would 
have easily had enough points if she hadn't been limited to so few tournaments, 
that she is certainly one of the top 16 players and a worthy entrant regardless 
of what rules were changed to help her get the needed points. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Joe Fernandez, a solid No. 5 in the points and already qualified, is not 
surprised how Capriati was dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
"She's qualified and I think she deserves to play, (but) there has got to be an 
exception for every rule and they've certainly made them for her," Fernandez 
said. "She's been lucky, I guess. They made them for her." 
</P>
<P>
School's out: Already a veteran at 19, Fernandez has not lost a match since 
Gabriela Sabatini won their U.S. Open semifinal in three sets. Sabatini went on 
to defeat Steffi Graf in the final and Fernandez went on to win tournaments in 
Tokyo and Filderstadt, improve her post-Open record to 9-0 and climb to a high 
of No. 4 in the Virginia Slims rankings. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, who played on the pro tour while she continued in high school in 
Miami, said she is much more solid on the court now that she doesn't have to 
divide time between tennis balls and school books. A straight-A student, 
Fernandez graduated 16 months ago and said she is reaching her potential as a 
player. 
</P>
<P>
"Being out of school has been the biggest factor in my tennis this year," she 
said. "There was a lot of pressure to do well in school and play tennis, too, 
but now there were no final exams before the U.S. Open, no homework on the 
road, no tests to study for. That's a big load off my shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
The latest on who's in and who's out of the $6-million Grand Slam Cup, the 
rival event to the ATP Finals, the players' own season-ending tournament: John 
McEnroe, Ivan Lendl, Thomas Muster and David Wheaton are in and Boris Becker is 
out. McEnroe said he won't keep any money he earns from playing but instead 
will donate it all to charity. First-round losers receive $100,000. The winner 
of the event, Dec. 11-16 in Munich, gets $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Ilie Nastase and Stan Smith have entered the $65,000 Prudential-Bache Grand 
Champions event Nov. 8-11 at the Newport Beach Tennis Club. Others expected in 
the 12-player field are John Lloyd, Bob Lutz and Ross Case. . . . Lisa Raymond, 
17, and Ivan Baron, 18, have been named junior players of the year by Tennis 
magazine. Raymond, of Valley Forge, Pa., won the 18-and-under Easter Bowl, the 
national and then junior international grass court championships. Baron, of 
Plantation, Fla., won the 18s national, the Easter Bowl and the junior Italian 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
TeamTennis, which lost Domino's pizza as a sponsor, will announce a new sponsor 
for its pro league at a news conference Monday at the Forum with Billie Jean 
King, chief executive officer of TeamTennis. King will also announce that a 
player ranked in the top five will play TeamTennis next season. In recent 
years, TeamTennis has not gone after the big names. 
</P>
<P>
Volvo North America, which recently vowed cutbacks in its sports marketing 
budget because of a downturn in auto sales, has dropped its title sponsorship 
of the Hall of Fame Championships in Newport, R.I. . . . The referee selected 
for the Davis Cup final between the U.S. and Australia is Stefan Fransson of 
Sweden. The International Tennis Federation also named Bruno Rebeuh of France 
and Sultan Gangji of Great Britain as umpires.

Virgil Hill remained undefeated in 29 fights when a bloodied Frankie Minton 
threw in the towel after the eighth round of their non-title bout Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, who did not risk his World Boxing Assn. light-heavyweight title for the 
bout, pounded Minton with lefts and rights. 
</P>
<P>
Although Minton was not knocked down, he was cut above his right eye in the 
fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
"It was bleeding," Minton said. "I saw a lot of blood." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the eighth, in which Hill staggered Minton just before the bell, 
Minton and his manager, Pete Susens, told referee Richard Steele that they had 
had enough. 
</P>
<P>
"He was more beaten than the cut," Steele said. "The cut was the least worry. 
To save him, they felt the fight should've stopped." 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I had a bad cut over my eye," said Minton, 26-9-1. 
</P>
<P>
The cut did not prove to be as serious as he thought, Minton said. It did not 
require stitches or impair his vision. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting at ringside for the fight before about 4,000 at the Bismarck Civic 
Center was Michael Moorer, the unbeaten World Boxing Organization 
light-heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
The Hill and Moorer camps are negotiating a title unification bout sometime 
next spring. 
</P>
<P>
Hill's manager, Gary Martinson, said the two fighters agree they should fight. 
Details of the contract are being worked out.

PAST IS MERELY PROLOGUE FOR PIGGOTT; 
</P>
<P>
COMEBACK: AT 54, LEGENDARY EUROPEAN RIDING CHAMPION WINS THE MILE.

<P>
The biography of the greatest European rider of the 20th Century had been 
written. The highlight video of a 37-year career had been on sale for five 
years. The game was over for Lester Piggott. Even the man who won a record nine 
Epsom Derbies could not hold off the relentless entry of Father Time and the 
tax man. 
</P>
<P>
And then two weeks ago, all of that changed. That's when the 54-year-old 
Englishman decided to return to the saddle, encouraged by trainer Vincent 
O'Brien, with whom Piggott shared many of his greatest triumphs. 
</P>
<P>
It took Piggott, who spent a year in prison for tax evasion after he gave up 
riding, two days to ride his first winner since 1985. It took him 12 days to 
win a $1-million race, which he did Saturday on Royal Academy, who rallied to 
take the Breeders' Cup Mile in a photo finish. 
</P>
<P>
Fittingly, Royal Academy is trained in Ireland by O'Brien, for whom Piggott 
rode four winners Tuesday at the Curragh. The 3-year-old colt also is a son of 
Nijinsky II, who was trained by O'Brien and ridden by Piggott when he won 
England's Triple Crown in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Academy broke slowly from post one and was last in the field of 13, but 
Piggott let him settle into stride on the Belmont backstretch. He was ninth at 
the half-mile pole and eighth, four lengths off the lead, with a quarter-mile 
left. Piggott switched him to the outside and Royal Academy accelerated 
strongly. 
</P>
<P>
Flu prevented O'Brien, the 73-year-old "Wizard of Ballydoyle," from coming to 
New York, so his 23-year-old son, Charles, filled in for him. Vincent O'Brien's 
wife, Jacqueline, also made the trip. 
</P>
<P>
"My father was instrumental in getting Lester to take his riding license out 
again," said Charles, who as a boy saw Piggott win four Derbies for his father. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent O'Brien has trained three winners of the Grand National and six Epsom 
Derby winners. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jacqueline O'Brien: "The greatest pleasure for Vincent is to have Lester 
ride for him."

BETTING WITH JANICE;

<P>
THE REMATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My handicapping consistency nearly helped me survive a spectacular finish by 
SURELOCK in our competition based on the seven races at Belmont Park Saturday. 
Our editors gave each of us an extra $500 for the bets, but we had to spend all 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
I had $50 win bets on Royal Academy ($9.80), Fly So Free ($5.40) and In The 
Wings ($7), and finished with $555. SURELOCK was shut out until 38-1 shot Ibn 
Bey returned $28 to place in the Classic, giving the computer $560. SURELOCK 
got back $60 when one of his exacta bets scratched, for a total of $620. 
</P>
<P>
In the regular segment of our betting, I lost $60 on the races at Oak Tree, 
giving me a loss of $5 for the day. My bets for today are $25 to win and place 
on Excellent Guest in the third race. 
</P>
<P>
Janice Goldinger's Sat. Bankroll: $2,237.50 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's Loss : $5 
</P>
<P>
Current Bankroll: $2,232.50 
</P>
<P>
SURELOCK made an $80 profit when Exbourne won the 10th race at Oak Tree, giving 
him a $200 profit for the day. The computer's bets today are $100 to win on 
Stylish Star in the eighth race and a $10 exacta box on Histrion, Ra Kish and 
Reppus Tuolluf in the ninth race. 
</P>
<P>
SURELOCK's Sat. Bankroll: $190 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's Profit: $200 
</P>
<P>
Current Bankroll: $390 
</P>
<P>
Note: Janice Goldinger, a horse owner, does not bet on races her horses run in. 
SURELOCK does not own horses.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / GEORGE L. PERRY: EXPERIMENTAL INDEX WILL TEST 
TRADITIONAL THEORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE L. PERRY, GEORGE L. PERRY is a senior fellow at the Brookings 
Institution research organization in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The index of leading indicators is familiar to many business-cycle observers. 
Developed in 1937 at the National Bureau of Economic Research by Wesley 
Mitchell and Arthur F. Burns, and amended by Geoffrey Moore and others, the 
index averages the movement of several economic variables chosen for their 
ability to anticipate booms and recessions. 
</P>
<P>
The index for August, the last available month, declined sharply, consistent 
with the emerging view among most forecasters that the economy is slowing. 
</P>
<P>
Amid this growing concern about recession, a new forecasting index -- the 
experimental index of leading indicators -- has produced a startlingly strong 
forecast of nearly 4% growth in the economy the next several months. A 
companion index places the probability that the economy will be in a recession 
next February at a minuscule 3%. Why such a big discrepancy between these 
predictions and the conventional ones? And should we stop worrying about 
recession and plan for a boom? 
</P>
<P>
The XLI has serious credentials. It is the result of sophisticated statistical 
research by James Stock and Mark Watson, two highly regarded econometricians 
working under the auspices of the National Bureau of Economic Research. Their 
index is constructed in much the same spirit as the official leading indicators 
were but presumably benefits from using the extensive database and 
number-crunching capacity that is available to econometricians today. 
</P>
<P>
The official index of leading indicators contains 11 variables, chosen because 
they have shown predictive power historically. They are: hours worked in 
manufacturing, initial claims for unemployment insurance, manufacturers' new 
orders for consumer goods and materials, vendor performance, contracts and 
orders for plant and equipment, building permits, change in unfilled orders, 
change in sensitive-materials prices, stock prices, the money supply and an 
index of consumer expectations. 
</P>
<P>
The XLI is a weighted average of seven variables. Although the list includes 
building permits and unfilled orders -- in common with the official index -- 
and an index of workers employed part time, it contains several financial 
market variables that have not been part of the leading indicators. These are 
the trade-weighted U.S. exchange rate, the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, the 
spread between interest rates on six-month commercial paper and six-month 
Treasury bills, and the spread between interest rates on 10- and one-year 
Treasury bonds and bills. 
</P>
<P>
The last two variables are contributing the most to predictions of economic 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
It is easy to see why these variables might help predict recessions. The spread 
between private and Treasury borrowing costs should reflect the risk of default 
on private debt. If lenders foresee a recession, they will see a greater risk 
of default and require a higher interest rate to compensate. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, if private investors are able to forecast recessions, a wider spread 
between private and Treasury interest rates should signal a higher probability 
of recession and a smaller spread the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
The yield spread between long- and short-term Treasury bonds and bills is 
interpreted as a forecast of the course of interest rates. Rates fall in 
recessions. So if investors expect a recession in the near future, they will 
push down long-term rates relative to today's short-term rates. 
</P>
<P>
Also, to the extent that recessions are brought about by the Federal Reserve 
raising short-term interest rates to slow down the economy, recessions will be 
preceded by a period of exceptionally high short-term rates and a narrow or 
even inverted spread between long- and short-term rates. 
</P>
<P>
Why might these stories be wrong this time? The long-short spread is most 
persuasive when monetary policy is raising short-term interest rates to slow 
inflation and, incidentally, causing a recession. That behavior was an 
important factor in many of the past recessions. But a recession emerging from 
sources other than a tightening monetary policy would not be preceded by a 
strong signal from the long-short spread. The present situation may fit that 
description. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, long-term interest rates may be exceptionally high today for 
special reasons. The flood of long-term borrowing for the thrift industry 
bailout and the apparent withdrawal of some Japanese investors from our bond 
market are two that come to mind. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of a recession signal from the private Treasury spread is a bigger puzzle. 
Indeed, it may just be that the official series used in the XLI is simply not 
reflecting what is going on in credit markets. Recently, credit ratings of 
well-known firms have been downgraded. In addition, the yield spread between 
junk bonds and Treasuries has soared. On this interpretation, an alternative 
indicator of the risk premium on private debt might be telling a very different 
story. 
</P>
<P>
The XLI is an interesting addition to the business-cycle literature. Perhaps 
its next reading, due at the end of this month, will tell a gloomier story than 
the last. If not, the index will either become a sensation for correctly seeing 
strength in the economy where others saw weakness, or Stock and Watson may want 
to go back to their data bank to make some alterations. That is the nature of 
research, and it is why experimental is the first name of the new index.

TRADE GROUPS SAY STATE LAWS ARE BEST WAY TO END LOCAL REGULATORY SPATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRADLEY INMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, proposals to ban smoking in public places have incensed the 
California Restaurant Assn. Then, this summer, the 3,000-member trade group 
came out with a surprise announcement: It would support a ban on smoking in all 
public places. 
</P>
<P>
But there was a catch: The support would come only if "such regulation is 
rendered on a statewide basis." 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated trying to fend off different regulatory schemes at the city and 
county level, restaurant owners are asking the Legislature to approve a bill 
that would adopt state standards and overturn dozens of local laws that 
regulate smoking in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
The effort is part of a growing movement among business trade groups of asking 
state lawmakers to intercede in local regulatory spats. 
</P>
<P>
The real estate industry persuaded the Legislature to curtail local laws that 
limit the use of for-sale signs in open houses. Banks and thrifts wouldn't 
support a bill to make automated teller machines safer until the legislation 
was amended with a provision that prohibits local communities from enacting 
their own rules. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial property owners are turning to state lawmakers for relief from local 
smoke detector rules, and legislation on rent control and pornography is also 
being pushed by special interests that don't want to deal with local 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"You see more industries pushing for state legislation because cities are more 
interested in regulating business," said Fred Main, vice president of the 
California Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Main said business first turned to state legislation in the 1950s, when it 
lobbied for a uniform sales and use tax. "Business has always liked 
uniformity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the restaurant lobby, its stance is a concession that regulation 
is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"We have always taken a position that government should stay out of our way," 
said Stan Kyker, executive vice president of the California Restaurant Assn. 
"But after much soul searching, we decided that the pattern of local regulation 
that was evolving wasn't serving anyone, including our industry." 
</P>
<P>
Restaurant owners admit that economic self-interest is behind their new 
position. Fearful of suits about secondhand smoke and worried that a patchwork 
of local ordinances is hurting some of its members, the association decided 
that a statewide ban was the best way to go. 
</P>
<P>
"The reversal was smart politics, California-style," Kevin Farrell wrote in a 
restaurant trade magazine. "CRA, with its announcement, was able to get into 
step with the public, which has clearly indicated its preference for a smoking 
ban." 
</P>
<P>
But Kyker conceded that it will be difficult to persuade the Legislature to 
adopt the smoking ban. "The tobacco industry isn't happy with us at all, and we 
don't have the resources they do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the restaurant association has taken an all-or-nothing position. It wants 
a ban in "all public places," which Kyker said might be interpreted as Dodger 
Stadium and even open-air patios. "Our position is that restaurants should not 
be singled out, which is what happens with many of these local ordinances," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Because the restaurant association has not come up with specific 
recommendations for legislation, some charge that its change of heart was a 
public relations ploy. Kyker denies that. "We intend to see this through," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Industries besides restaurants are also turning to the Legislature to try to 
obtain relief from local regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The California Assn. of Realtors was troubled by homeowner associations and 
cities adopting laws that regulate placement of for-sale signs. Twice in three 
years, the industry has pushed through state laws that permit signs to be 
placed anywhere they don't pose a safety hazard. 
</P>
<P>
This trend concerns the League of California Cities. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, it has become too easy for a special interest to come to the 
Legislature and pass a bill that waters down local laws or eliminates them 
altogether," said Executive Director Don Benninghoven. "When several cities 
consider the same issue, it probably means that there is a legitimate problem 
out there. Then we permit state lawmakers to squelch the local responses to 
these concerns." 
</P>
<P>
Business lobbyists see the trend as a practical response to a proliferation of 
regulations at the local level. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this is a case of business lobbyists getting together and 
deciding that we are going to take away local control," said real estate 
lobbyist David Booher, who has been pushing for statewide rules on rent 
control. "Business sees 450 municipalities and 58 counties coming at them with 
different regulatory schemes, so they look to the state Legislature to better 
manage the problem." 
</P>
<P>
State lawmakers must decide what is best left to local leaders and what is of 
statewide significance. "I try to resist marching out and telling local 
officials what they should be doing about all of these issues," said Tom 
Hannigan (D-Fairfield).

Tough U.S. Plan Irks State Bank Regulator 
</P>
<P>
California Superintendent of Banks James E. Gilleran wants L. William Seidman, 
chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., to tread carefully when he 
pushes for tougher banking regulations. 
</P>
<P>
When Gilleran heard about an FDIC proposal to prevent banks from underwriting 
insurance and making real estate investments, he fired off a letter to Seidman. 
</P>
<P>
"California offers a textbook example of how to conduct real estate and 
insurance powers in a prudent and profitable manner," wrote Gilleran, who is 
responsible for regulating state-chartered banks such as First Interstate, 
Union Bank and Sumitomo Bank of California. 
</P>
<P>
He encouraged Seidman "to reject any broad and sweeping changes." 
</P>
<P>
"We too are concerned about the condition of banks in an economic downturn," 
said John Paulus, deputy superintendent of banks. "But when regulators do 
something from Washington, they shouldn't paint everyone with the same brush." 
</P>
<P>
According to Paulus, the state superintendent carefully examines banking 
activity and closely monitors real estate investment and insurance activities. 
</P>
<P>
To prove his contention that California banks aren't in serious trouble with 
their real estate and insurance portfolios, Gilleran will soon release a report 
that analyzes these investments and their performance. 
</P>
<P>
Another study that supports Gilleran's position was released last week by the 
California Mortgage Bankers Assn. It shows that less than 0.8% of the 8,208 
commercial property loans in California are delinquent 30 or more days.

NADIR HASN'T HIT BOTTOM, BUT THE FINANCIER MAY YET PROVE APTLY NAMED; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: IN LONDON, THE CITY BUZZES OVER THE COLLAPSE OF HIS SPRAWLING POLLY 
PECK EMPIRE. ITS GUIDING SPIRIT COULD FALL FURTHER YET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The summer's preoccupation in Britain's financial community was the trial and 
conviction of four top executives in the long-running Guinness stock 
manipulation scandal. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, the leading concern of Britain's brokers, bankers and analysts is a 
much wider ranging imbroglio: the collapse of the Polly Peck International 
food, electronics and leisure conglomerate and the stunning decline of its 
chairman, Asil Nadir. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a British judge placed the company into a form of reorganization 
similar to Chapter 11, effectively taking Polly Peck out of Nadir's hands and 
ending the Cypriot financier's weeks-long effort to put together a financial 
rescue package for the firm. 
</P>
<P>
The court intervention, requested by Polly Peck's board when Nadir came up $60 
million short in his campaign to satisfy creditors owed nearly $2 billion, 
followed more than a month of turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Trading in the London-based company's shares was suspended Sept. 20 after panic 
selling that day reduced the value of Polly Peck stock by more than $1 billion. 
In the course of an afternoon, company shares dropped to 1.08 pounds from 2.43 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The frenzy was touched off when word leaked out that Britain's Serious Fraud 
Office had raided the offices of South Audley Management, an investment company 
with ties to Nadir. Rumors of an insider trading scandal whipped across the 
City, London's financial district. The SFO interviewed Nadir for several hours 
that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Although the SFO has refused to reveal the purpose of its investigation, Nadir 
later said the inquiries were "substantially related to the alleged impropriety 
in dealing in Polly Peck shares." He added that the investigation was 
"unrelated to matters within my knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
Within a week, Polly Peck suspended payments on its debt, $400 million of which 
is believed due before the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
The company's 70 or so creditor banks had given PPI until Nov. 9 to find the 
money and devise a business plan to guide it through the debacle. As part of 
the agreement with the banks, Nadir had pledged to step down as chairman, 
although it was thought he would remain chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
But with the court intervention, that plan has now been discarded. A 
court-appointed administrator will run the company and attempt to repay 
creditors. 
</P>
<P>
The British financial community's vast interest in the case is attributable to 
more than the fantastic sums, the whiff of scandal and the strong possibility 
that one of Britain's premier companies will be sold off piecemeal. 
</P>
<P>
There also is intense scrutiny because this is Polly Peck, one of the most 
unusual companies in Great Britain. The story of Polly Peck and its autocratic 
leader is almost literally rags to riches. 
</P>
<P>
"Polly Peck is very much the creation of one person," says a London-based 
merchant banker familiar with Nadir's career. "That one person is the company. 
It's a very unusual situation for a publicly traded company in Britain." 
</P>
<P>
Nadir, a Turkish Cypriot who came to Britain in 1964, built up his father's 
garment business through the 1970s. In 1980, he bought a stake in the failing 
textile company Polly Peck. Although the company's journey through the 1980s 
was more akin to a roller coaster ride than a rocket, it ended the decade with 
a reputation as the world's best performing stock over the previous 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, Nadir became one of the wealthiest men in Britain. Climbing from 
a meager 5 pence a share in 1983, Polly Peck was valued at nearly 4 a share in 
1989. The company bought Del Monte's fresh fruit operation for $875 million 
last year. It even purchased a controlling interest in the Japanese electronics 
company Sansui. 
</P>
<P>
Polly Peck and its financial machinations grew against the backdrop of 
international politics. 
</P>
<P>
Nadir is a close friend and political ally of Turkish President Turgut Ozal and 
has extensive holdings in that country and his native Cyprus. Among his Turkish 
holdings are an empire of news publications that have provided unwavering 
support for Ozal. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the Serious Fraud Office investigation became known last month, the 
Turkish government complained to the British government that a campaign was 
being waged against Nadir by Greek Cypriots. A week later, during a meeting in 
New York between Ozal and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the Turkish 
leader reportedly demanded to know if there were any proven instances of 
wrongdoing involving either Nadir or Polly Peck. Thatcher is said to have told 
him that the case would stay in the hands of criminal investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Nadir's links to Turkish northern Cyprus are intricately related to his 
political muscle in Turkey. But those links also have caused him political and 
business problems elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
In the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, an entity borne of Turkey's 1974 
invasion of Cyprus and recognized only by Turkey, Polly Peck is the biggest 
taxpayer and the second largest employer, after the state. Besides operating 
companies involved in manufacturing and citrus exports, Nadir has been building 
a string of luxury hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The creation of a thriving tourist trade is viewed as the best way to boost the 
sluggish economy in the northern sector of the partitioned island. Turkey hopes 
to wean its 16-year-old offspring from the massive subsidies that the tiny 
republic now requires. 
</P>
<P>
But Polly Peck's investments in northern Cyprus have outraged the Greek 
Cypriots in the much larger and prosperous southern region of the island. In 
1983, Polly Peck shares plunged when the Greek Cypriot government claimed that 
the company was involved in the seizure of Greek property in northern Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
Nadir was able to steer the company through that crisis, which saw the greatest 
drop in the company's value -- until last month's free-fall. Even through the 
recent problems, Nadir had steadfastly sought to protect his Mediterranean 
holdings. 
</P>
<P>
With 28% of Polly Peck already in hand, Nadir surprised London's financial 
community last August by announcing that he was taking the company private. But 
he left the City completely baffled -- and caused the firm's shares to dip -- 
when he announced five days later that he was abandoning the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the events of Sept. 20. Polly Peck suspended payments on its massive 
debt. Reports began to emerge about an enigmatic web of Swiss and offshore 
companies and their connection to Polly Peck, Nadir and the questionable 
trading of Polly Peck shares. Large blocks of company shares appear to have 
been traded just before important company announcements. 
</P>
<P>
No charges have been filed in the case, which is still under investigation. 
Nadir acknowledged that the company was having "liquidity problems," but denied 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that creditor banks had sold 10 million Polly Peck shares in 
which he had an interest during the frenzied trading of Sept. 20. The shares 
had been held by the banks as collateral on loans. His bankers' sale of those 
shares and other blocks reduced Nadir's stake in Polly Peck to just over 24%. 
</P>
<P>
But Nadir's statement did not clarify the extent of the company's financial 
problems, nor did it identify their cause. 
</P>
<P>
Until the decision to seek court protection, Nadir had been jetting around the 
globe looking for sources of cash. He repeatedly said he would be able to 
secure huge amounts in Turkey and northern Cyprus, but in fact produced little. 
A much-discussed bailout from the Turkish government fell through. Polly Peck 
did sell one hotel in northern Cyprus to the government, however, for $12 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Now the court-appointed administrators -- accountants from the firms of Coopers 
&amp; Lybrand and Deloitte &amp; Touche -- will have to make what they can of 
Polly Peck's assets. 
</P>
<P>
It will be an arduous task. Little is known about Polly Peck operations in 
Turkey. And because of the ongoing nationalist struggle on Cyprus, the chances 
of selling any businesses in northern Cyprus to foreigners are considered nil. 
Indeed, the Turkish enclave's finance minister said last week that he would 
aggressively fight any such deals. 
</P>
<P>
Much attention is being focused on the fate of Del Monte, which is considered 
the jewel in the Polly Peck crown. The parent company had said it was 
contemplating the sale of a minority stake in the fresh fruit operation on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The administrator could attempt to sell Del Monte outright. Complicating that 
scenario, however, is the fact that rival Dole Food Co. is already for sale.

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: A CHANGING OUTLOOK FOR RETIREE HEALTH PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the most attractive employee benefits, health-care insurance for 
retirees, is being re-examined by many companies. Older workers, particularly 
those close to retirement, should expect to pay more for the benefit -- or find 
it tougher to qualify for coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Offered by most large companies and many small ones, retiree health-care plans 
typically offer those retiring under age 65 a continuation of the same medical 
coverage they enjoyed when working. For retirees over 65, the coverage 
generally supplements Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
Such plans have been quite useful as the nation's demographics change and the 
percentage of retirees or near-retirees in the population grows. Such coverage 
has been particularly useful for those retiring before 65, because they can't 
fall back on Medicare until age 65. And many employers have been quite generous 
with coverage, often footing the entire cost. 
</P>
<P>
But thanks to new corporate accounting rules expected to take effect in 1993, 
such generosity is becoming a thing of the past. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which makes the 
nation's accounting rules, adopted new standards that require companies to 
recognize on their financial statements some of their present and future costs 
of providing retiree health plans. Currently, companies recognize only what 
they actually pay out in any given year -- a figure that does not reflect their 
vastly larger future commitments. 
</P>
<P>
It's no surprise that the new rule will have a devastating effect on corporate 
bottom lines, reducing profits by hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
And coming as corporations are already reeling from rising health-care costs -- 
and as they brace themselves for an expected recession -- the timing of this 
new rule is inopportune. 
</P>
<P>
The implication for workers is clear: More companies will think twice about 
offering generous retiree health benefits. Indeed, surveys show that many 
employers intend to alter their plans in anticipation of the new accounting 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to really turn up the heat on employers to minimize their 
obligations to retirees," says Lois Salisbury, chairperson of Health Access, a 
coalition of labor, consumer and other groups in California working to promote 
affordable health care. "For many retirees, those obligations are already 
uncertain, so this will exacerbate that trend." 
</P>
<P>
Few employers say they will eliminate retiree health plans completely. But you 
should expect other changes, such as: 
</P>
<P>
* Higher costs for retirees. Most big companies say they will require retirees 
to contribute more toward the costs of coverage. They also may require higher 
deductibles or coinsurance. 
</P>
<P>
Some employers -- recognizing that plans cost more for retirees under age 65 
because they cannot yet draw on Medicare first -- are specifically increasing 
costs borne by early retirees. 
</P>
<P>
The median annual cost for employers to provide retiree health coverage for 
individuals retiring under 65 is $2,246, compared to only $1,033 for retirees 
above age 65, according to a survey by Hewitt Associates, an employee benefits 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
* Stricter eligibility requirements. Some companies are tying plan eligibility 
or benefit levels to employees' length of service. If you have fewer years of 
service, you might be required to make higher contributions -- or you might not 
be eligible at all. 
</P>
<P>
"Employers are increasingly structuring these retiree plans more like pension 
benefits, (where they) reward long service," says John W. Bauerlein, a 
consulting actuary in the Santa Ana office of Hewitt Associates. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you have 30 years of service when you retire, a company might 
subsidize 100% of the cost, Bauerlein says. But if you only have 15 years of 
service, the subsidy may be only 50%. 
</P>
<P>
* Provide lower-cost options. Employers may provide alternatives for retirees 
to select reduced coverage in exchange for lower contributions. For example, 
you might be able to select catastrophic care with a much higher deductible in 
exchange for a lower premium. 
</P>
<P>
What can you do about these changes? 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, not much. If you are a union member, figure that the controversy 
over retiree health-care cutbacks will be an issue in labor negotiations. It's 
already been a bone of contention in labor talks involving such large companies 
as American Telephone &amp; Telegraph and the Baby Bell regional phone firms. 
</P>
<P>
But whether you're in a union or not, you should consider the strength of a 
company's retiree health plan, along with other factors, before joining that 
company, Salisbury says. 
</P>
<P>
And if your retirement is imminent, "you ought to double- and triple-check your 
own expectations for retirement coverage against what your employer says," 
Salisbury advises. Get your employer to commit its plan terms in writing, she 
urges. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of gray areas where employers may feel free to change 
commitments," she says. "Be vigorous in determining exactly what your 
employer's obligations are going to be."

AUTO DEALERS FIGHTING OVER SHRINKING PIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Campbell is president of the Campbell Automotive Group, which operates 
seven auto dealerships in Orange and Riverside counties. Together, the 
dealerships sell 11 makes of new cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business is very, very difficult. It's the most difficult I've seen it in 12 
years I've been in the business. This is a function of two things. We're in the 
middle of an industry recession, which is due to all the new entries in the 
marketplace -- the Acuras, Saturns, Daihatsus, etc. The total number of car and 
truck models (has) doubled in the past year, but the total market has not 
increased. We have a pie the same size being sliced in ever smaller pieces. 
</P>
<P>
"That has reduced margins and sales, but costs are increasing faster than usual 
in our industry because of real estate and because of environmental costs. Our 
industry has been hit hard by the costs of hazardous waste because we deal with 
gas and oil. Profitability is very difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"On top of that, we have a general recession, and it is making it that much 
harder. We're in for as tough a period over the next 12 months as the car 
industry has had since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"Our industry is often highly leveraged. One of the challenges will be to 
reduce that leverage and be in a good capital situation going in. The other 
will be keeping costs under control and doing whatever restructuring one needs 
to do. And I think dealerships will have to be sold, closed or consolidated. 
There's not enough market around to support all the models that exist. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are trying to hold dealerships together, staying together 
hoping for the turn. But I think we're being double barrelled by a bad economy 
and some structural factors in our industry that (are) going to make the turn 
quite a way off." CHRIS WOODYARD

OF SOUTHLAND COUNTIES, THOSE INLAND ARE LIKELY TO WEATHER STORM BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the economic thumbscrews begin to turn in Southern California, some counties 
will feel the pain more than others. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County will probably get the worst of it, primarily because of the 
downturn in the aerospace sector, said Jack Kyser, economist for the Los 
Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. And although no county will escape the 
recession's wrath completely, Riverside and San Bernardino likely will fare the 
best. 
</P>
<P>
Look to Burbank and you will see contrasts that mark the current economic 
health of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
In one corner you will find Lockheed, which this year laid off nearly 2,000 
workers from its Burbank-based aeronautical group. In another, Disney Studios 
whistles while it works; the company has no plans to alter film production 
schedules because of the looming recession. 
</P>
<P>
The problems of Lockheed and other aerospace companies clearly will be the key 
factor depressing the county's economy. Generally, the county's manufacturing 
sector, which includes aerospace, has lost jobs so so far this year, according 
to Kyser. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, jobs have actually been added during 1990, thanks largely to the 
service sector. But the county's unemployment rate is up as well, indicating a 
mismatch between jobs and job seekers' skills. 
</P>
<P>
The construction industry is well into a slump, with new building permit values 
declining since the beginning of the year. The once-overheated real estate 
market, Kyser says, "is going to slog along for a while." And tourism, another 
big industry, did not enjoy a summer to brag about. 
</P>
<P>
The good news for Los Angeles County is that some sectors continue to be 
strong, including the entertainment industry, Pacific Rim trade and investment 
and parts of the high-tech industry. 
</P>
<P>
Plus, there is some hidden vigor not measured by government data. 
</P>
<P>
"Many in the motion picture and high-tech industries are independent 
contractors who aren't tracked by anyone, and you just know there there's a 
major underground industry in Southern California that's hidden from us" and 
operates strictly on cash, Kyser said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Orange County 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, there is little wrong with the economy in Orange County. But 
beneath the shiny veneer of low unemployment and high personal income is the 
same general unease that is affecting the rest of the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers aren't jamming the malls. Manufacturers aren't stocking up on raw 
materials. The construction and auto retailing industries -- major bellwethers 
of Orange County's financial direction -- are in turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent economic outlook conference sponsored by the Orange County Chamber 
of Commerce, a panel of economists predicted a national recession by year-end. 
That was no surprise. But they also warned that upscale Orange County would be 
hit harder than most places because of its heavy dependence on construction and 
consumer spending. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Silva, who has operated a commercial collection agency for more than two 
decades, says the hit is already being taken. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting accounts from people whose customers normally don't get behind, 
(such as) car dealers and real estate agents," Silva said. "And when you get a 
run against real estate agents, like you did in the early '80s, that's an 
indication that something's wrong out there." 
</P>
<P>
James Doti, an economist at Chapman College in Orange who analyzes the Orange 
County economy, agrees that the first signs of trouble are appearing. Figures, 
he says, show that builders have all but stopped undertaking new projects as 
the market for housing and commercial construction dries up. 
</P>
<P>
And although Orange County still posts the Southland's lowest jobless rate -- 
3.8% in September -- lines at the state Employment Development Department 
offices have been lengthening. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inland Empire 
</P>
<P>
Businesses in the Inland Empire have heard about this thing called recession. 
But they haven't been formally introduced. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the factors that made San Bernardino and Riverside counties among the 
fastest growing in the nation in the 1980s -- cheap and plentiful land, 
affordable housing and a pleasant living environment -- remain a powerful 
magnet. They may well insulate the area from the harshest effects of the 
economic slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
"The concept of a recession suggests a sliding backwards, and that term is just 
not appropriate for the Inland Empire for the foreseeable future," said Steve 
PonTell, president of the Inland Empire Economic Council, a nonprofit 
organization in Ontario. "There will be ripples and adjustments by companies, 
but we're still a vibrant, growing region." 
</P>
<P>
One recent ripple: A major materials-handling company that once was interested 
in building a 250,000-square-foot plant employing 600 people shelved its plans 
indefinitely earlier this month, according to David McElroy, managing director 
of the Riverside County Economic Development Agency. 
</P>
<P>
A big challenge facing the Inland Empire is creating jobs for the swarms of 
people moving in to enjoy relatively cheap housing costs. An estimated 300,000 
residents commute each day to jobs in Los Angeles and Orange counties, creating 
not only traffic and smog problems but a heavy dependence on the rest of the 
Southland. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to think of ourselves as this independent, mature region, but we're 
not quite there yet," PonTell said. Consequently, "if L.A. has a crunch, we'll 
feel the repercussions of that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ventura County 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County's diversified economy -- a busy mix of retailing, service 
industries, government, agriculture and light manufacturing -- has strengths 
that will help it resist a recession longer than many parts of the country, 
business leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
But the county's economy nonetheless is slowing under the weight of a sluggish 
real estate market and a slumping construction industry. Other frailties show 
up in the oil industry and among defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
The sluggishness was evident in Ventura County National Bank's semiannual 
survey of county business. Three years ago, 78% of the 500 businesses surveyed 
reported an increase in sales. That figure dropped to 55% for the first six 
months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We are slowing down because of a lack of consumer confidence," said William E. 
McAleer, the bank's chairman. "But we are not seeing homes being foreclosed and 
cars turn(ed) back in as you would see in a recession." 
</P>
<P>
McAleer points to his own Oxnard-based bank as an indication of the area's 
strong economic base. The Ventura County National Bank has its lowest level of 
defaulted loans in years. The same holds true for the Bank of A. Levy, based in 
Ventura, which has posted record earnings for the last six quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, one of the county's strongest industries, shows no sign of 
weakening. Although city dwellers are suffering from the drought, longstanding 
agreements have kept water flowing to farmers, albeit at slightly higher 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
And tourist dollars continue to bolster the economy, as Ventura and Ojai draw 
increasing numbers of weekend refugees from the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
San Diego County 
</P>
<P>
Conventional wisdom suggests that San Diego's three-legged economy will stand 
firm against all but the strongest financial winds. 
</P>
<P>
But civic boosters acknowledge that tourism has stalled, military spending is 
flat and construction levels are lagging the blistering pace set during the 
late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a delicate period," said Dan Pegg, president of San Diego's Economic 
Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In its favor, San Diego has weaned itself from a near-total dependence upon 
military dollars and successfully exploited its reputation as a tourist mecca 
and an attractive place to live. 
</P>
<P>
But even San Diego's diversified economy probably is not strong enough to 
withstand a severe national downturn, said Rayford Boddy, an economics 
professor at San Diego State University. "San Diego is looking more like 
California, and California is looking more like the rest of the United States," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's economic future will be determined largely by its ability to 
continue attracting free-spending tourists and well-heeled newcomers who can 
afford to live in one of the nation's least-affordable counties. 
</P>
<P>
During the past year, most of the county's major attractions have reported 
attendance that is flat or down. Robert Galt, president of Sea World of San 
Diego, blamed disappointing attendance at his park on a "national malaise" in 
travel and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
The construction industry is balanced just as precariously. 
</P>
<P>
Although new construction remains relatively strong compared to the rest of the 
country, cracks have appeared. Housing permits have failed to keep pace with 
the late 1980s, and in recent months, an estimated 9,000 construction employees 
have lost jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"People in the industry are scared," said Julie Dillon, a builder who serves as 
president of the local Building Industry Assn.

County, Greg Johnson in San Diego, Jenifer Warren in Riverside and Kenneth R.

IN REAL ESTATE, SELLERS TAKING BIG PRICE CUTS

Therese Marcus, a real estate agent with Prudential California Realty in 
Sherman Oaks, was the top performer in her office last year. As recently as 
June, she expected her 1990 sales volume to match that of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But Marcus said the economy seems to have taken a turn for the worse in the 
past few months. Even though she's spending more time and money marketing 
properties, she now expects to finish the year about 30% below last year's 
gross. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's an uncertainty and uneasiness. There's the Middle East crisis, 
and people have been pounded over the head with budget problems and the idea 
that we're going into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question in my mind that real estate is already in a recession. I 
sense it more in the last six weeks than anything else. I have $7 million of 
inventory on the market. But I'm not getting calls. I'm not having showings. 
</P>
<P>
"I have seven houses on the market. I get offers for 15% to 30% below the 
asking price. If you really want to move your property, you're taking big cuts 
in what you're asking. 
</P>
<P>
"I put a property on the market on Labor Day of last year for $509,000. From 
September to December we had four offers, all between $450,000 and $485,000, 
all rejected by the seller. That property is still on the market today, 13 
months later, and it's down to $489,000. I can give you dozens of cases like 
that.

MARRI'S CUSTOMERS 'WORRIED ABOUT TOMORROW'

<P>
Isaac Alexander is a co-owner of Marri's Pizza and Italian Restaurant, a block 
from Disneyland in Anaheim. During summer, tourists generate most of the 
28-year-old restaurant's business. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant has relied heavily on word-of-mouth and repeat business. Now, 
however, Marri's is considering advertising to attract customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "With people from town, we're doing OK. But with out-of-towners, business has 
dropped 40% or more, easily. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping (business) was going to pick up, . . . but with what's going on 
overseas, with the banks, I don't think it's going to pick up. 
</P>
<P>
"Customers are looking at the prices first. Before, they ordered despite the 
price. We even have to lower prices in order for people to come in and eat. We 
started to put a special two-for-one (meal) out. We never had done that before. 
When you have high quality you don't have to do that. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to sell a lot of wine. Every two weeks we used to order to 15 cases. 
Now, for the last 1 1/2 months or so, it's been maybe five cases. 
</P>
<P>
"Customers who used to come in every day now come only twice or three times a 
week. They say, 'It's not your food . . . (but) everybody has to start cutting 
down. . . .' They're worried about tomorrow. They're fearing for tomorrow."

LEVINE, OPPONENT DIFFER SHARPLY OVER ISRAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN and MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voters in California's 27th Congressional District do not have to look long or 
hard for a major difference between the Democrat currently representing them 
and the Republican seeking to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
The two candidates, both of whom are Jewish, are sharply divided on the subject 
of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Mel Levine is one of Israel's most outspoken supporters on Capitol 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
David Barrett Cohen, meanwhile, says the United States should work for the 
establishment of a Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
The two lawyers are running for the seat that Levine has held for four terms, 
representing a largely coastal district that stretches from the South Bay to 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Levine, often spoken of as a possible candidate for Alan Cranston's U.S. Senate 
seat in 1992, may well be running his last race for the House of 
Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
But he insisted in an interview that any other ambitions are on hold. 
</P>
<P>
"I love being in the House and I'm focused on getting reelected in '90 and 
serving in '91 and '92," Levine said. He had built a massive $1.6-million war 
chest by the middle of May. 
</P>
<P>
A strong environmentalist, Levine has been a leader in the fight to protect 
Santa Monica Bay and resist offshore oil drilling. 
</P>
<P>
He has introduced legislation to create a federally chartered corporation to 
assist American high-tech industries in their competitive battle with Japanese 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
In Cohen, Levine faces an opponent who changed his party registration from 
Democrat to Republican in January of last year. Cohen said he made the switch 
after becoming disenchanted with the Democratic Party and its presidential 
candidate, Michael S. Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he has raised more than $40,000 in contributions, and has also 
loaned his campaign $33,000 of his own money. 
</P>
<P>
He has not been shy in his quest for money. At a recent fund-raiser in Carson, 
Cohen, who is half-Samoan, put on a Samoan reed skirt and danced bare-chested 
for his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
The challenger has been attacking Levine in commercials on cable television, 
accusing the lawmaker of being a top recipient of contributions from savings 
and loans, citing a report from the public interest group Common Cause. 
</P>
<P>
The GOP candidate also contends that Levine has not moved swiftly enough to 
protect aerospace jobs in the South Bay, including those provided by the Los 
Angeles Air Force Base in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
It is the subject of Israel, though, that perhaps most clearly defines the 
differences between the two men. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen advocates a "two-state solution" that would lead to creation of an 
independent Palestine on land now held by Israel, which he accuses of "trying 
to forcibly occupy a population of 1.7 million people against its will." 
</P>
<P>
Arguing against Israel's refusal to negotiate with the Palestine Liberation 
Organization, he maintained that "Palestinians have a right to choose their own 
leaders, and it is not for the Israelis or Americans to dictate who their 
leaders will be." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen acknowledges that this is an unorthodox position. "Unique. I'm the only 
mainstream American candidate for Congress who has called for a two-state 
solution," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Levine charges that PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat has been Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein's proxy since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait inflamed 
passions in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Calling him the "least responsible actor" in the region, Levine said that 
Arafat has been "trying to increase the level of violence and incite violent 
behavior in the region, despite promises to contain himself over the last 
several years." 
</P>
<P>
Responding to a request from the Los Angeles-based Muslim Public Affairs 
Council to comment on the recent clash between Israeli police and a crowd of 
Arab demonstrators in Jerusalem, Cohen said he supported the Bush 
Administration's denunciation of the use of excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
Levine said: "Passing a U.N. (Security Council) resolution condemning Israel 
before we know what the facts are, and then sending a fact-finding mission, is 
like rendering a verdict before you have the trial. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always felt that the United States should and does support Israel's 
survival within secure borders on one hand, and legitimate rights for the 
Palestinians on the other hand," he added. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual move, Cohen sent a mailer to Inglewood -- the portion of the 
district containing the largest concentration of black voters -- accusing 
Levine and his political allies of taking black voters for granted and treating 
the city "like a voting plantation for Mel Levine." 
</P>
<P>
Levine brands the mailer "an unfortunate effort by a desperate political 
candidate." 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is, my track record on civil rights and civil liberties is quite 
solid," he said. "For a candidate to dream up some wild charges that have no 
basis whatsoever in fact is offensive both to me and to the voters of the city 
of Inglewood." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Levine has refused to debate his challenger, although he said he would 
be willing to meet him, if Cohen apologizes to Levine and to Inglewood voters 
for the brochure. 
</P>
<P>
Peace and Freedom Party candidate Edward F. Errer is also on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer George Hatch contributed to this story.

LITTLE COMPETITION FOR DYMALLY, DIXON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After enduring sharp criticism in the primary for his dealings with African 
countries, Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton) appears well on the way to 
winning a sixth congressional term in a markedly kinder and gentler general 
election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Democratic Rep. Julian C. Dixon of Los Angeles is expected to emerge 
victorious in a rematch with a Republican businessman he easily defeated in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
In the 31st Congressional District, Dymally, 64, faces Republican Eunice N. 
Sato, 69, a Long Beach city councilwoman from 1975 to 1986 who served a term as 
the city's mayor. The district includes Hawthorne, Carson, Compton, Lynwood and 
Bellflower, and parts of Watts and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most liberal members of Congress, Dymally drew fire from his 
Democratic primary opponent this spring for his close ties to Zairian President 
Mobutu Sese Seko, whose government has been accused by the U.S. State 
Department of being repressive and corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
He was also criticized for his efforts to promote U.S. black business interests 
in various African nations, interests that have included the firm of friend and 
campaign contributor Mamadi Diane. 
</P>
<P>
Sato, however, has not talked about Dymally's African connections, which the 
incumbent asserts are in keeping with his duties as chairman of the House 
Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Africa. 
</P>
<P>
A former teacher who also was a member of the state Task Force to Promote 
Self-Esteem and Personal and Social Responsibility, Sato said she sees three 
important issues in the contest: education, the environment and the federal 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be there to help see that they don't spend any more than they take 
in," she said. Dismissing questions about where she would trim federal 
spending, Sato said the task is to ensure "more effective use of the dollar." 
</P>
<P>
Although she wants federal officials to put more emphasis on education, she 
said she is not advocating federal spending for schools. The main task in the 
environment is to improve the quality of air and water, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the 28th Congressional District, Dixon is in a rematch with George Z. Adams, 
whom he beat two years ago with more than 75% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
A low-key but generally respected member of the House, Dixon was briefly in the 
spotlight in 1989 when, as chairman of the House Ethics Committee, he presided 
over the inquiry involving House Speaker Jim Wright, who subsequently resigned 
from the House. 
</P>
<P>
Later in 1989, Dixon and his wife, Betty, made some headlines when it was 
reported that Betty Dixon was part of a small group of politically connected 
people who profited from a Los Angeles Airport Department program to help 
minorities and women develop business skills. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon later said he was never lobbied by the firm with which his wife had a 
business deal, and he disputed statements by the company's law firm that it had 
contacted him on company business several times. 
</P>
<P>
A key congressional advocate for Metro Rail funding, Dixon also has played a 
role in national and international politics of interest to his district. He was 
one of the first congressmen to lobby for economic sanctions against South 
Africa, and more recently became a member of a defense appropriations 
subcommittee, through which he hopes to play a substantive role in defense 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
Adams, like many other challengers, says he is running because he thinks the 
incumbent has been in office too long and has lost touch with his constituency. 
</P>
<P>
Adams says he wants to deal with the budget deficit by cutting government 
spending, without raising taxes. The challenger also supports the current 
policies allowing abortion and favors more funding of public education to 
combat illiteracy, according to campaign spokesman Ron Evans. 
</P>
<P>
Libertarian Bob Weber and Peace and Freedom candidate William R. Williams are 
also on the ballot.

IN THE END, TITANS GIVE THE GAME TO LONG BEACH 
</P>

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when it seemed that Cal State Fullerton would finally break Murphy's Law, 
the old adage came back and kicked the Titans in the pants Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The team that has found every which way to lose in 1990 added another chilling 
chapter to its misery memoirs when Sean Cheevers' 20-yard field goal with six 
seconds left gave Cal State Long Beach a 37-35 victory in front of 7,042 in 
Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
For once, everything that could go wrong wasn't going wrong for the Titans, who 
led the 49ers for most of the Big West Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton quarterback Paul Schulte was having his finest day of the season, 
completing 20 of 34 passes for 343 yards, three touchdowns -- and no turnovers. 
A beleaguered Titan defense, which has been burned beyond recognition this 
season, actually held Long Beach on three critical fourth-quarter possessions. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the Titans' final, fateful possession. They had the ball, a one-point 
lead, and the 49ers were out of timeouts. All Fullerton had to do was get a 
first down, run out the clock and agree on a postgame party site. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the game was over, frankly," Fullerton linebacker Clarence Siler 
said. "We were pretty much celebrating." 
</P>
<P>
On second and nine from the Titan 45, Schulte fooled the Long Beach defense 
with a bootleg play; he faked the handoff to running back James Mullins and ran 
around the left side. Schulte had daylight in front of him, but that quickly 
turned to darkness. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach linebacker Pepper Jenkins closed in, hit Schulte and forced a 
fumble. Defensive end Ed Lair recovered and the 49ers had the ball on the Titan 
44 with 2:14 left. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach quarterback Todd Studer, who completed 21 of 40 pass attempts for 
346 yards, hit Mark Seay for 19 yards and later teamed with Jeff Exum on a 
15-yard pass play to the Fullerton 20. A personal foul (late hit) on Titan 
cornerback Darrell Bruce gave Long Beach a first down on the 10 with 31 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Fassett ran seven yards to the Titan three, and Cheevers came on to kick 
the game-winning field goal. Long Beach improved to 4-5, 3-3 in the conference; 
Fullerton fell to 1-8, 0-4. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't seem like we can buy a win or buy a break," said Titan kicker Phil 
Nevin, who missed a 32-yard field goal midway through the fourth quarter and 
had a 48-yard attempt blocked in the third. "We played our butts off today and 
still lost." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Coach George Allen called the bootleg play "a real gamble," but it 
appeared to be a good call until the fumble. Schulte had some running room but 
wasn't fast enough to capitalize. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to hang onto the ball, go north-south and stay on the wide side of 
the field," Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy said. "But Jenkins against Schulte -- 
there's no trickery involved there." 
</P>
<P>
Schulte said he considered sliding to the ground as Jenkins, the 49ers' best 
defensive player (16 tackles Saturday) approached. Schulte's biggest mistake 
might have been trying too hard. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I'd try to get a few extra yards," Schulte said. "I was close to 
being down, but he must have stripped the ball. I should have had two hands on 
it, but that's over." 
</P>
<P>
Not even his best passing game, which pushed him past the 2,000-yard mark for 
the season, could console Schulte. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't win, so it doesn't matter," Schulte said. "I didn't play a complete 
game. I came up a couple minutes short." 
</P>
<P>
It appeared Long Beach would be in for a long afternoon when Fullerton took a 
21-6 lead in the second quarter. Reggie Yarbrough capped an 87-yard drive with 
a two-yard touchdown run in the first quarter and added an eight-yard scoring 
run in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the second, Schulte threw a 24-yard pass into the end zone for 
Greg West. Surrounded by three 49er defenders, West leaped for the pass, tipped 
it in the air and caught it as he lay flat on his back in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, meanwhile, put together two long drives that ended with field goals 
of 40 and 34 yards. But after West's touchdown catch, Studer threw a quick out 
pass to Gerald Woodyard, who turned it into a 64-yard scoring play. That made 
it 21-13, Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach pulled to within 21-20 early in the third quarter when running back 
Freddie Leslie took a pitch from Studer and passed to Exum, who was wide open 
down the left sideline for a 73-yard touchdown play. 
</P>
<P>
Schulte's 39-yard touchdown pass to Kerry Reed made it 28-20, but the 49ers 
took advantage of a blocked Titan field goal attempt to again trail by a point. 
Oliver Thompson blocked Nevin's 48-yard attempt, and Leon Patterson returned it 
30 yards to the Fullerton 37. From there, Studer hooked up with Seay for a 
touchdown that made it 28-27 with 4:36 left in the third quarter. Seay finished 
with nine receptions for 162 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach took its first lead, 34-28, when Fassett capped a 95-yard drive with 
a two-yard touchdown run early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But the Titans bounced back, driving 78 yards for a touchdown -- Schulte's 
15-yard pass to Richard Harrison -- to regain the lead, 35-34. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton had a chance to pad the lead when it drove from the Long Beach 45 to 
the 15 on its next possession. But usually reliable Nevin sent his 32-yard 
field goal attempt wide right. 
</P>
<P>
Nevin, the former El Dorado High School standout, was feeling a bit hexed 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what it is about this stadium -- I missed three field goals in 
one game here during my senior year of high school," Nevin said. 
</P>
<P>
Like Nevin, the Titans don't know what it is about this season. They've lost 
numerous starters to injuries and numerous games to turnovers and sloppy play. 
They finally put together a decent, all-around effort, only to have it end in a 
bitter defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Can anything else go wrong? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," Schulte said. "We'll have to wait and see." 
</P>

Quarterback David Klingler passed for 457 yards and a career-high seven 
touchdowns in Houston's 62-28 victory over Arkansas, extending the Cougars' 
winning streak to 11 and Razorbacks' losing streak to four. Arkansas (2-5) is 
off to its worst start since 1958, when it opened with six losses. The 62 
points were the most scored against Arkansas in a Southwest Conference game, 
topping the 60 by Baylor in 1922. Klingler tied the school record of seven 
touchdown passes set last year Andre Ware. The junior has passed for more than 
400 yards in six of seven games this season. Roman Anderson's 19-yard field 
goal with 6:18 left gave him 314 points, breaking the SWC scoring record of 312 
by running back James Gray of Texas Tech from 1986-89. It was the 57th field 
goal of Anderson's career, one shy of the SWC mark by Texas' Jeff Ward. 
</P>
<P>
No. 19 Clemson sacked Wake Forest quarterback Phil Barnhill eight times in a 
24-6 victory. It was the 500th victory in Clemson history and the 14th in a row 
over Wake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State's 9-0 victory over Alabama was the Crimson Tide's first shutout loss 
at home in 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
No. 8 Miami bounced back from last Saturday's loss to Notre Dame with a 45-10 
victory over Texas Tech. The Hurricane defense, ranked eighth nationally, 
allowed Texas Tech only 93 yards and held the Red Raiders to 41 yards in 44 
plays through three quarters. Defensive end Rusty Medearis had five sacks, and 
Shane Curry and Darrin Smith each had two. Three of Craig Erickson's four 
touchdown passes went to Lamar Thomas, who set a school record for most 
touchdown receptions in a game. 
</P>
<P>
Darren Lewis became the Southwest Conference's rushing leader for a career with 
176 yards in 25 carries in Texas A&amp;M's 41-15 victory over Rice. Lewis has 
4,453 yards, breaking the mark of 4,450 set by Eric Dickerson of Southern 
Methodist from 1979-82. 
</P>
<P>
Behind quarterback Greg Frey, Ohio State scored on its first four possessions 
and five of its first six to take a 38-17 lead over Minnesota at the half. The 
Buckeyes' 52-23 victory gave Minnesota its first Big Ten loss of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Chip Hilleary passed for a personal best 221 yards and ran for 102 more in 
Kansas' 27-24 victory over Kansas State. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Brus of Tulsa broke Howard Waugh's record of 250 rushing yards set in 1952 
with 312 yards against New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IN QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
Iowa State Coach Jim Walden, after the Cyclones, playing without injured 
running back Blaise Bryant, lost to Nebraska, 45-13: "This week, I had to 
create an offense against one of the best defenses in the country. They are 
good, and don't let anyone tell you that they haven't played anybody. They will 
be just as good when someone finally decides that they are playing somebody, 
and I think that will probably happen next week." The No. 4 Cornhuskers play 
No. 10 Colorado Saturday.

Washington quarterback Mark Brunell did a little bit of everything in a 46-7 
victory over California. He caught an 11-yard touchdown pass from Beno Bryant 
and completed a 56-yard pass play for a touchdown to Greg Lewis in the third 
quarter. After the 56-yarder, the point-after kick was blocked, and Brunell 
picked up the ball and passed to Darius Turner for the two-point conversion. 
Brunell also scored on a 32-yard run in the second quarter. Lewis had another 
big day. He ran for 205 yards, his ninth game in a row of at least 100 yards. 
With 1,126 yards this season, he became the first Washington runner to have 
consecutive 1,000-yard seasons. Lewis' 13 100-yard games over two seasons are a 
school record.

Kevin Tisdel's 85-yard kickoff return for a touchdown helped No. 16 Georgia 
Tech hold off Duke for a 48-31 victory. The Blue Devils had come back to trail 
by 24-21 with 2:23 left in the third quarter before Tisdel broke four tackles 
on his kickoff return, eluding three defenders who had him surrounded at the 
Tech 45. It not only helped assure the victory, it got Tisdel, a sophomore 
walk-on, a free education. "Tisdel now has a scholarship as of January." 
Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Ross said. "I told him after the game that I'm not 
holding it any longer. That son of a gun just gets it going for us."

There was nothing easy about Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden's efforts for his 
200th victory. After failing in two previous games, No. 12 FSU defeated 
Louisiana State, 42-3. But Bowden's victory celebration was marred by a 
bench-clearing, free-for-all after Florida State was penalized for a late hit 
on the game's final play. Coaches and stadium authorities moved in to separate 
the players. Last Saturday against Auburn, a similar penalty helped the Tigers 
beat Florida State, 20-17. The week before that, Florida State had lost to 
Miami.

RANCHO SANTIAGO DENIED BALL, VICTORY

Riverside Community College found out Saturday night that the best way to slow 
down Rancho Santiago's Estrus Crayton was to keep the ball away from him. The 
strategy paid off in a 30-14 Mission Conference victory at the Santa Ana Bowl 
that spoiled the Dons' 75th homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
Crayton did gain 232 all-purpose yards, his season average, and set a Orange 
County all-purpose record along the way. But it wasn't enough to overcome 
Riverside 363 rushing yards, the result of fullback Samita Vaoifi, halfback 
Mark Wilson and a big offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
Vaoifi ran for 166 yards and a touchdown in 19 carries, and Wilson gained 
another 154 yards and a touchdown in 21 carries as the Tigers (5-2, 4-2) broke 
open a close game with 17 fourth-quarter points. 
</P>
<P>
Crayton scored on a 96-yard kickoff return in the second quarter and picked up 
134 rushing yards in 19 carries to pass former Orange Coast star Bart 
Recktenwald for the county all-purpose yardage record. The Dons are 4-3, 3-3 in 
the conference. 
</P>
<P>
With Rancho Santiago trailing, 16-6, in the fourth quarter, Crayton was stopped 
on a fourth and seven on the Riverside 10, and the Tigers then drove 90 yards 
for a 23-6 lead. TOM BIRSCHBACH

FULLERTON WINS ANOTHER BARN BURNER

<P>
The past three weeks of Fullerton College football have taught fans one lesson: 
don't leave early. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton trailed by 13 points entering the fourth quarter Saturday night, but 
rallied in the final 5 minutes 37 seconds for a 24-23 victory over Golden West 
in a Mission Conference game at Orange Coast. 
</P>
<P>
A nine-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Eric Robinson to fullback Don 
Norris with 43 seconds left tied it at 23-23. Eric Lange then drilled the extra 
point and Fullerton led, 24-23. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West got the ball at its 30 on the ensuing kickoff, but turned the ball 
over on downs and Fullerton (6-1, 5-1) ran out the final 16 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
This was the third consecutive week Fullerton has been involved in a wild 
fourth-quarter finish. Two weeks ago, Fullerton scored 22 points in the final 
5:36 to defeat El Camino, 31-24, after being behind, 24-9. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Fullerton held a 29-17 lead, only to watch Saddleback score 14 
points in the final 5:21 for a 31-29 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I getting too old for this," said Hal Sherbeck, Fullerton College coach who is 
in his 30th season. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's comeback started when Golden West quarterback David Brunet fumbled 
an exchange from center and the ball was recovered by defensive lineman Steve 
Griggs at the Golden West 34 with about eight minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
Six plays later, Brian Williams scored on a one-yard run and the Golden West 
lead was cut to 23-17. Golden West then had to punt after three plays, and 
Fullerton started the winning drive at its own 31 with 4:20 left. The Hornets 
went 69 yards in nine plays including a 23-yard and a nine-yard screen pass 
from Robinson to John Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West (5-2, 4-2) won't have to go far to find what would have made the 
difference in the outcome. Kicker Wayne Duplantis, who tied the state and 
national record with five field goals last Saturday, missed a 31-yard field 
goal attempt and an extra point in the first half. Golden West also failed on a 
two-point conversion try in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Vaccaro had an 89-yard touchdown run in the second quarter and Golden 
West led, 9-0, at the half. He led all rushers with 136 yards in 15 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton rallied for 10 consecutive points early in the third quarter, but 
Brunet came back with two touchdown passes as Golden West built a 13-point 
lead. He completed a 22-yarder to Troy Walker, who made a diving catch in the 
end zone to put Golden West up, 15-10, with 2:06 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
With 48 seconds left in the third quarter, Brunet hooked up with Robert Bedford 
for an 18-yard screen pass for a touchdown. Brunet completed the two-point 
conversion pass to Jake Witherspoon to give the Rustlers a 23-10 lead.

president of operations for the last five years.

AS FAR AS SANDY WALES was concerned, up was the only direction to go. In a life 
that consisted almost entirely of work, her goal was to become a vice president 
of a large company. She was a market-research supervisor at Quaker Oats when 
her boss, the director, got sick. Wales filled in, and was confident that she 
had demonstrated how well she could do the work. But when the director's job 
became open, it went to someone the company brought in from outside. Wales 
quit. "I was so angry that I didn't want to be there. I felt I had done a good 
job, and I received no recognition," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
She switched fields, but the same thing happened again. She rose rapidly, then 
lost out to another candidate for a management post. Again, she quit. When a 
third company passed her over for promotion -- this time for someone younger -- 
Wales started thinking. Maybe she didn't have the rules of the game figured 
right. Or maybe the rules had changed. Being good, it appeared, was no longer 
good enough. "I always thought that if I proved myself competent, there would 
be no stopping me," she says. "It's a rude and nasty thing to discover that 
there's a lid on you." 
</P>
<P>
Psychologists describe what is going on here as plateauing. Plateauing is the 
day you find out that the boss is younger than you are -- and for that matter, 
so is the boss's boss. Plateauing is the third time you get passed over for the 
same promotion. Often, plateauing has nothing to do with moving up -- you just 
want to move somewhere. Your job is getting tedious, and you are ready for a 
change, but when you reach for the next rung, you discover that someone took 
away the ladder. 
</P>
<P>
A mental alarm goes off. Deadwood. Failure. Over the hill. On the shelf. Burned 
out. Used up. Me? But look around the department, especially at those stars who 
used to be promoted every year or so. For the most part, no one else seems to 
be going anywhere either, though they all seem to be working just as hard as 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
Plateauing happens to just about everyone, and always has. But the hard truth 
is that for baby boomers it is occurring earlier and earlier. With the first of 
these aging wunderkinder well into their middle years, the fast track is 
starting to look like the San Diego Freeway at rush hour. And it is going to 
get worse. Notice that cloud of dust coming up behind you? That's the second 
half of the boom, the group whose values were hardened in the get-out-of-my-way 
1980s. By the turn of the century, baby boomers -- whose ages will span 35 to 
54 -- will make up 49% of the work force and will be at stages in their careers 
where they have the greatest expectations of moving up. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer and fewer will realize that goal. Barry D. Leskin, chairman of the USC 
Business School's management and organization department, throws out this grim 
forecast: While there were about 10 potential candidates for every 
middle-management opening in 1975, the number will rise to 30 in 1995 and 50 by 
the year 2000. So where does that leave the vast majority who do not make it? 
</P>
<P>
Actually, most plateaued people haven't even figured out what the problem is, 
much less how to solve it. "I see the full spectrum of people who can't put 
labels on it, who don't know what's wrong. All they know is they are unhappy," 
says Eileen L. Brabender, a Los Angeles career counselor. "They call it being 
burned out. They complain about the repetition, the frustration, the boredom." 
</P>
<P>
This is the generation, after all, that thought that intelligence, drive and 
the right education could guarantee anyone a spot near the top. And few doubted 
that was where they wanted to be. Unless you are the lead dog in the pack, they 
used to joke, the scenery never changes. Many don't find that crack so funny 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started here, I was one of nine MBAs who had been hired in my 
division," says one oil-company executive in his mid-30s. He joined the firm in 
the early 1980s, when the energy business seemed boundless, as did the 
ambitions of those drawn to it. Now, he and his co-workers are grateful just to 
have survived successive waves of layoffs. Those who remain are making lateral 
moves, which a few years ago would have been considered black marks on their 
resumes. 
</P>
<P>
As vice president of human resources for Hughes Aircraft Co., Ted G. Westerman 
grapples every day with employees' expectations that don't match the 
opportunities available. "It's an issue every place," he says, particularly at 
companies such as Hughes that are cutting thousands of mid- and upper-level 
management positions from their payrolls to remain competitive in a changing 
global market. "(Workers continue) to expect that the way you keep score of how 
you are doing is whether you get promoted. But that is running in the face of 
the competitive pressure we are under to work better with less bureaucracy." 
When his daughter graduated from college two years ago, he warned her that she 
should consider herself successful if she received three promotions in her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
But some reject a definition of success that doesn't include regular movement 
up the ladder. As Digital Equipment Corp.'s growth started slacking off a few 
years ago, marketing manager Steve Sommer noticed something disturbing. "All 
the restructuring was causing career gridlock -- a lot of lateral moves, but 
not a lot of upward moves," says Sommer, who holds a master's degree in 
business from Harvard. "I also looked at how long people were resident in their 
positions. It seemed to be stretching out -- eight months, to two and a half 
years, to five years." 
</P>
<P>
When a headhunter approached him with an offer of a much higher position with a 
struggling software company that was 120 times smaller than Digital, he took 
it. "It was the toughest career move I ever made," he says. "But I had the 
Harvard MBA paranoia, wondering, 'Gee, will I be off the fast track if I stick 
around?' I was very conscious of how many levels there were between me and the 
senior VPs." 
</P>
<P>
When people gauge their accomplishments this way, plateauing inevitably feels 
like failure -- a truth so painful that they often have difficulty facing or 
admitting it. (Many of those interviewed for this article agreed to discuss 
their experiences only on the condition that their names not be used.) However, 
plateauing generally has little to do with how smart you are or how valuable, 
career-development experts say. For most people, it is a matter of simple 
arithmetic, an equation in which demographics and economics add up to a lot of 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"For a long time, history was on the side of the ambitious," writes Judith M. 
Bardwick, a La Jolla psychologist whose book "The Plateauing Trap" is 
considered the definitive treatise on the subject of career gridlock. From 1950 
to 1975, America dominated the world market, and its businesses and 
institutions were expanding so rapidly that their major problem was finding 
enough qualified managers, she says. The available pool of candidates had been 
born around the time of the Depression, when the nation saw its lowest 
birthrate ever. What's more, only white males were allowed into the executive 
fold. People began to talk about the Peter Principle -- the idea that they 
could rise to a level exceeding their abilities. 
</P>
<P>
Then into the work force came the nearly 80 million people born between 1946 
and 1965. Among them were large numbers of women and minorities, allowed to 
enter the competition for the first time. Never had so many positioned 
themselves on the management ladder: This year, for example, an estimated 
70,000 people will receive MBAs -- more than 10 times the number who did in 
1960. But before the oldest troops in the boomer army reached the halfway point 
in their careers, big companies started cutting the ranks by hundreds of 
thousands -- at least 3 million jobs vanished from the Fortune 500 during the 
past decade, by some estimates. Mid-level management positions -- the 
bureaucracy of most organizations -- often were the first to go. 
</P>
<P>
So you can forget the Peter Principle, Bardwick says. Far from rising above 
their capabilities, most people will never even get the chance to perform up to 
their potential, especially in big organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Women and minorities are likely to plateau sooner, increasingly by the time 
they are in their mid- to late-30s, Bardwick says, partly because of lingering 
discrimination. Separate studies this year by Opinion Research and Wick &amp; 
Co. consultants showed that women are more likely than men to leave big 
corporations, not because of difficulties in juggling career and family 
demands, but because of lack of opportunity -- the infamous glass ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
A few companies are beginning to recognize that they face big problems unless 
they deal with the frustrations and broken expectations of employees who are 
left behind. Some of their most valuable employees will leave, and those who 
remain, even top performers, are likely to become bitter, alienated and afraid. 
With promotion opportunities narrowing, former risk-takers are becoming more 
cautious, terrified of doing anything that could dampen their advancement 
chances even further. When Yes Men and Yes Women are born, innovation dies. So 
for American businesses, the plateau is also the precipice, and finding 
solutions to the problem is more than a matter of wanting to allay the psychic 
discomforts of disappointed baby boomers -- it's a matter of survival. 
</P>
<P>
PLATEAUING SOLUTION NO. 1: NEW JOB 
</P>
<P>
WITH MORE than a decade separating their ages, Harry Bernhard and Sandy Wales 
view plateauing from opposite sides of the baby boom. But each has faced a 
similar decision: whether to stay in a cushy position with a big organization 
that offered no advancement or to risk setting out on an entirely new career. 
Each took the gamble. 
</P>
<P>
To Bernhard, challenge and excitement were always an important part of the job. 
In the mid-1950s, he joined a forward-thinking company called International 
Business Machines, which was transforming itself from a manufacturer of time 
clocks and meat-cutting machines into the leader in the burgeoning computer 
field. Opportunity seemed endless. 
</P>
<P>
And from all outward appearances, Big Blue offered abundant opportunities to 
Harry Bernhard. He rose during 15 years in marketing and another 15 in human 
resources, where he helped run an executive-development program that served 
40,000 people a year. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, though, his boss told him, "You're not going anywhere." With more 
than 10 years to go before he reached retirement age, Bernhard was not ready to 
be put out to pasture. So he took the company up on an early retirement plan 
that would give him, as he puts it, "$1,000 a week to stay away forever." 
</P>
<P>
Bernhard had spent two years as an IBM Fellow lecturing at the Harvard Business 
School and had taken a liking to academia. In 1987, he moved to Los Angeles and 
started a second career as an "executive in residence" at the USC business 
school. "I didn't have to go to meetings with people I half-liked, or didn't 
like," Bernhard says. 
</P>
<P>
USC soon made him an associate dean, but he was in that job only a few months 
before he was lured away by Emory University in Atlanta, where he has been in 
charge of executive education since March. In a new field, Bernhard is once 
again advancing -- and he is earning twice what he made at IBM. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, Bernhard was lucky. He was born in an era when demographics 
worked for him, not against him. By the time he plateaued at IBM, he was set 
financially. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Wales, on the other hand, was just entering her 40s when she realized 
that her job was taking her nowhere. Stepping out of the corporate world was a 
big risk, but one that -- thus far she is glad she took, because she was forced 
to discard the old ideas of success that had led her from one frustrating 
situation to another. 
</P>
<P>
When Wales graduated from Purdue University in 1967, she had little idea of 
what she wanted from her career, she recalls, but after a few years in a large 
corporation, her goal became clear : to become a vice president. Wales believed 
that hard work alone would get her there. 
</P>
<P>
Wales worked 10 years in market research for a couple of major firms in the 
Midwest, starting out as a door-to-door interviewer for Procter &amp; Gamble 
and going on to become a market-research supervisor designing questionnaires 
for Quaker Oats in Chicago. She set her sights on her boss's job, but when he 
left and she was not chosen to replace him, Wales decided to leave. 
</P>
<P>
She moved to an advertising agency, where she helped clients compile market 
research. Each time Wales asked to be put in charge of something, she was told, 
"When we get another women's account." 
</P>
<P>
She refused to stay at a firm where her advancement opportunities were limited, 
so she switched fields, making what she describes as "a sidestep" into 
executive recruiting. That eventually took her to Los Angeles and a job at 
Mattel in 1979. Wales also had to swallow a salary cut -- but she was willing 
to pay that price for a chance to move up in a big organization. 
</P>
<P>
She became a manager relatively quickly, and when the international director of 
human resources left, she was given that position temporarily. However, when it 
came time to fill the job permanently, the post again went to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
In her last job, as director of placement services for American Medical 
International, she was passed over for a promotion yet again. This time, she'd 
had enough. With her divorce 15 years ago, she had abandoned plans for a 
family. That made work all the more important to her -- and her setbacks even 
more devastating. 
</P>
<P>
She realized, she says, that "I am no longer willing to give my life to a 
corporation." So at the age of 42, she decided to become a marriage, family and 
child counselor. She went back to school full time, earning her master's degree 
a year ago at a branch of Antioch University in Marina del Rey. To pay the 
bills, she took a part-time job with an outplacement firm. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an interesting way to live. The hardest part is financial. The wonderful 
part is freedom," Wales says. "I'll ultimately be working for myself. No one 
will tell me I'm not qualified. No one will say, 'Aren't you getting a little 
old for this?' " 
</P>
<P>
PLATEAUING SOLUTION NO. 2: NEW ATTITUDE 
</P>
<P>
SOME PEOPLE, having taken stock of their priorities, write their own 
definitions of success. Natalie Orlins, 36, is manager of the accounts payable 
department at USC. She started in the department as a clerk shortly after 
graduating from college 14 years ago, and she climbed steadily. Within a few 
years, she was assistant manager of the department, and when the manager's job 
opened in 1981, she filled it. 
</P>
<P>
Orlins, who is single, has always valued what she describes as "a balanced 
life" -- one that allows time for friends, church and other interests. About 
two years ago, she considered applying for a higher-level job and decided 
against it. "There's more politics. More money and more power are not worth the 
price," she says. 
</P>
<P>
She does not think of herself as plateaued; Orlins thinks of herself as happy. 
That, of course, does not necessarily mean that she wants to keep doing the 
same thing until she retires. If her job starts to bore her, Orlins might look 
for a position at the same level somewhere else. "It would broaden my field of 
experience and knowledge," she says. "That, I think, I would find more of a 
challenge than just moving up." 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Kaye, a nationally known career-management consultant in Sherman Oaks, 
predicts that as more people are forced to come to grips with the inevitability 
of plateauing, more people will follow Orlins' route. "It's a question of 
balance," she says. "Some of them choose it. They say, 'Enough (of this). Give 
me something that makes my life simpler.' " 
</P>
<P>
The idea here is that satisfaction, challenge and professional growth do not 
have to be linked to the next promotion. 
</P>
<P>
If a promotion is not in the cards, workers increasingly welcome a chance to 
try something new. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric in San Francisco urges employees 
to take assignments in different areas of the company, moving sideways rather 
than up. During the past decade, 43-year-old Chris Joyce has made four lateral 
moves. They have taken her into diverse roles that have ranged from managing 
building maintenance crews to supervising PG&amp;E's affirmative-action 
programs, her current job. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'm going to be the next vice president of any function at 
PG&amp;E. I'm realistic about that," Joyce says. She considers herself a 
success and anticipates more lateral moves. "What turns me on when I move to a 
new job is thinking maybe I can make it better," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Still, many find no satisfaction in a career path that leads anywhere but up. 
That prompts companies to sell workers on lateral moves by making them sound 
like promotions. "Companies are reluctant to tell people they aren't going 
anywhere, because they're afraid they'll lose their motivation," says Harry 
Levinson, who directs the Levinson Institute, a Belmont, Mass., consulting firm 
that specializes in psychological aspects of management. Indeed, University of 
Connecticut management professor John Velga found that 85% of the managers he 
surveyed characterized their last job change as a promotion, but 60% of their 
companies described it as a lateral transfer or demotion. 
</P>
<P>
Often, however, employees are sharp-eyed enough to see their future in those 
around them. Jeff Smallowitz enjoyed his first few years as an engineer with 
Hughes Aircraft Co., where he worked on projects, including the Galileo space 
probe. He quickly was promoted to managing a small team, but he soon realized 
that "the work that I was doing probably would not change dramatically. It was 
pretty much a set pattern. That was what caused me to leave. I didn't like the 
feeling that everything was preplanned," Smallowitz says. 
</P>
<P>
After seven years at Hughes, Smallowitz went into business for himself as a 
consultant. Now 33, he is planning a more dramatic switch. Within a few months, 
he expects to open a discount hair-cutting shop in the Palos Verdes area -- the 
first in what he hopes will be a string of Cost Cutters outlets. Buying a 
franchise appealed to him as an opportunity to put his entrepreneurial energies 
behind a proven business idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of say in what the future holds for me. I like the excitement in 
not exactly knowing how it pans out," he says, adding, "I'm the best boss I 
ever had." 
</P>
<P>
PLATEAUING SOLUTION NO. 3: NEW PAYOFFS 
</P>
<P>
EVEN WITH the growing awareness of plateauing, career-development specialists 
say that not enough companies have confronted the problem. "Basically what 
happens is plateaued people are ignored, and that's the worst," says 
psychologist Bardwick. "It's a cruel and stupid system. We need to expand our 
idea of success to something that people can continue to get. They need the 
opportunity to earn new challenges, empowerment and significance." 
</P>
<P>
And businesses need satisfied employees if they hope to compete in a world 
where the quality of their work force will be their chief edge over their 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Managers on the front lines are beginning to feel the urgency of finding 
solutions to plateauing, especially as they see valuable employees looking 
elsewhere. "What you're essentially saying is there isn't any opportunity. OK, 
I buy your concept. So how do I retain people?" snapped an executive for a 
leading high-technology firm in the Silicon Valley. "I lost a person last week. 
He said, 'I know I'm competing with a large pool of candidates here, and I'm 
not going to get promoted.' So he went to a smaller company. It's really awful. 
We lose our good people." 
</P>
<P>
In Bardwick's view, the payoff for a job well done should be recognition and 
new responsibilities. That used to mean a promotion, but now employers are 
experimenting with new rewards. Among their innovative approaches: incentives 
for employees who take lateral moves; team projects that give workers a sense 
of power; bonuses to remind people that they are valuable even if they are not 
promoted, non-management career tracks and assistance for those who want to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes has tried another tactic: It places "more authority, influence and power 
lower down in the organization," says Westerman of the company's human 
resources department. He points to Hughes' Fullerton plant, where the company 
manufactures consoles for controlling radar on ships. Each individual involved 
in making the consoles used to have a specialized job. Now, the work is done by 
a team of 50 people involved in all phases of assembly, and "you cannot tell 
the inspectors from the supervisors," Westerman says. Individuals can see the 
difference they have made in all stages of production. Absenteeism and 
discipline problems are down, he says, and quality of work has risen. 
</P>
<P>
Like PG&amp;E, Hughes also encourages lateral moves. "In our kind of company, 
that's a new thing," Westerman explains. "In the past, if you were a technical 
guy, you'd probably stay technical your whole life." Now, it is not unheard of 
for an engineer to move into finance. 
</P>
<P>
"As they get the new skill, we pay them for that skill," Westerman says. "They 
see themselves becoming more valuable. I think it's going to be the late-'90s 
version of (traditional) kinds of promotions." 
</P>
<P>
But what is most needed, Bardwick and other experts agree, is a new honesty on 
the part of employers. 
</P>
<P>
"In most of our companies, there is a level of graciousness that precludes 
telling the truth," Bardwick says. "People are not told that they are not 
likely to be promoted, and so they think they are doing well." 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, Bardwick says, when managers talk honestly about a worker's 
prospects, "people say, 'Thank you. Now I understand what is happening. Now I 
know I'm not a failure. I'm normal.' " 
</P>
<P>
Only then can people begin to assess their own values and write individual 
definitions of success. "Becoming plateaued," Bardwick writes, "is an 
opportunity to pause, reflect and change. It is a personal sabbatical, a time 
for self-examination that becomes our opportunity to grow in ways we never 
imagined."

<P>
AS THE LAST streaks of daylight play out in tremulous pinks and oranges, a 
steady drizzle of sensi ble Chevrolets, work- worn pickup trucks and family 
vans with tinted glass jolt over potholes into a dusty field, weaving to avoid 
couples strolling toward the National Guard Armory in Wilmington, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Earnest young men perspire in dark suits and paper-white shirts split by somber 
ties, clothes that hang unfamiliarly on their frames. They hover near the 
doors, pointing people toward the rows of long, foldaway tables covered in 
white paper tablecloths and, beyond them, the line of steel vats filled with 
good North Carolina grub -- barbecue pork, Brunswick stew, coleslaw, hush 
puppies. Postcard-size American flags fixed with patriotic bunting dot the 
white walls of the armory. 
</P>
<P>
A group of men discusses engine displacements; a few older women stir the hot, 
soupy air with paper fans, and the din of long Southern drawls rises to fill 
the brick cavern. Then, suddenly, the conversations fade and a splatter of 
clapping swells to a tide of applause as North Carolina's senior senator walks 
in. 
</P>
<P>
A smile of sorts ripples over Jesse Helms' lips as he plunges into the aisles, 
shaking hands, stooping to whisper a word to an acquaintance or pat a child on 
the head. As he moves along, he sheds his blue suit jacket. When he shuffles 
by, he extends a soft, pink hand, his eyes refracted through his clumsy, owlish 
glasses, and he gruffly purrs, "Glad to see you here." 
</P>
<P>
"Jesse's a man of common sense," a middle-aged woman patiently lectures a 
visiting Northerner. "He knows what human nature is. Grass-roots people will 
support him to the end." 
</P>
<P>
"Now you look here," says her husband, the owner of a small construction 
company, as he holds up a leaflet that has been left at each place setting. 
"He's against higher taxes, for the death penalty, against abortion and, right 
here, he's against using taxpayers' money to pay for obscene," -- he stumbles, 
wrestling with homoerotic -- "well, I can't pronounce that, but pornography and 
avant-garde art." 
</P>
<P>
His wife speaks up again. "I don't think the government should be funding art 
in the first place. To me, putting a crucifix in urine is disgusting. Now, 
who's the strongest opponent of spending federal dollars for supporting the 
NEA? People say he stands for what the Constitution intended. This nation is 
founded on the Bible by godly men. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about Jesse," she says conclusively, "is you know where he stands. 
The thing about Jesse is, what you see is what you get." 
</P>
<P>
Jesse. It's always Jesse. Not Senator Helms. Not Mr. Helms. It's just Jesse. 
More than anything, 69-year-old Jesse Helms has convinced many white North 
Carolinians that he's one of them, that Jesse Helms is just plain folks. 
</P>
<P>
In this, his fourth U. S. Senate campaign, he is counting, once again, on a 
powerful down-home style that melds folksiness, a bearlike embrace of 
traditionalism and his misty-eyed recollections of North Carolina's bucolic 
past with a finely tuned, state-of-the-art political money machine second to 
none in the country. He won his last election, widely regarded as one of the 
most vicious races in modern American politics (another was the 1950 Senate 
campaign in which Willis Smith, a former American Bar Assn. president, aided by 
Helms, defeated Frank Graham, president of the University of North Carolina, 
after months of rabid race- and redbaiting), by a hairsbreadth over former Gov. 
James B. Hunt Jr. This time, Helms' opponent is Harvey Gantt, a 47-year-old 
architect and former mayor of Charlotte. Gantt, though, is different from 
Helms' previous opponents: He is black. 
</P>
<P>
Although Helms insists that he is not running a racially tinged campaign, 
Gantt's very color has thrust the issue of race before every North Carolinian 
as it has never been before. The campaign also has become this year's most 
clearly drawn run for the Senate -- one in which Helms' unvarnished 
conservatism clashes starkly with Gantt's unapologetic liberalism, a contest 
that has remained neck-and-neck as the candidates push toward Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
As Jesse Helms steps onto the stage this evening in September, loosening, then 
stripping off, his tie, his eyes dance over the crowd, a gathering of white, 
middle- and lower-income people, his people, who spring to their feet, 
chanting, "Six more years! Six more years!" Then he speaks, his voice rising 
and ebbing in the cadences of his southern Piedmont roots. There's more 
storytelling than oratory, more homilies than stentorian exhortations. 
</P>
<P>
"I never promised any free money from Washington because there wasn't any free 
money from Washington," Helms reminds his faithful. "Every dime has to come 
from the taxpayers' pockets." He turns nostalgic, reminiscing about being sworn 
in on the floor of the Senate for the first time. "And I looked up. My father 
was in tears. He was my favorite man." He takes a deep breath to draw out the 
emotion. And then he tells of his recent fact-finding visit to Saudi Arabia and 
his determination that American troops should be able to send letters home free 
of charge. "I got that passed the first day of the session." 
</P>
<P>
"You see," the middle-aged woman says, nudging the visitor, "that's what I 
mean. Jesse's practical." 
</P>
<P>
Then, Helms flicks away the bugaboos that have followed him through life: "I 
hear talk of racism. But who was the senator, by the way, who chose a fine, 
highly qualified -- and I'm talking about a black man -- to serve in the No. 2 
spot on the minority staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee? I wonder 
who that senator was?" And finally, he turns to the fate of the nation. 
"There're two equally important No. 1 problems -- the federal debt and," his 
voice begins a slow climb, drawing each word out syllable by syllable, "the 
imperative need to restore moral and religious principles as the keystone to 
our survival as a free nation. I am persuaded that the Lord is giving us one 
more chance to turn this country around." 
</P>
<P>
Applause, shouts of approval and stomping feet smother his final words. 
</P>
<P>
THERE ARE FEW states in the waning decade of the century that could nurture a 
Jesse Helms. A product of small- town life, Helms grew up in a South of 
untroubled certainties, deeply held religious beliefs and fixed social 
relations. But the tranquillity of rural North Carolina life -- much taken for 
granted as the natural order of things -- even it was jarred by the events of 
Black Friday, 1929, when Helms was 8 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Helms has never described the effects of these national traumas on his boyhood 
or his home town, Monroe. There are, to be sure, WPA accounts of the impact of 
the Depression on rural America, great photographs by Walker Evans, but North 
Carolina's native son Thomas Wolfe, in "You Can't Go Home Again," described 
more lyrically the repercussions that events on Wall Street had on his state, 
even in little hollows like Monroe: 
</P>
<P>
"The collapse of the Stock Market, which had begun in late October, was in some 
ways like the fall of a gigantic boulder into the still waters of a lake. The 
suddenness of it sent waves of desperate fear moving in ever-widening circles 
throughout America. Millions of people in the far-off hamlets, towns and cities 
did not know what to make of it. Would its effect touch them? They hoped not. . 
. . But the waves of fear had touched them, and life was not quite the same." 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina, and the country, survived, but the path to recovery, through 
the New Deal and World War II, forever shattered the sleepy stability of the 
South. For those who remember wistfully the years before the war, before the 
onslaught of the civil rights movement, Southern society was almost Edenic, a 
place where the races respected each other's place, where the Bible was law, 
women were treated like ladies and morality was plain. Nostalgia, perhaps 
because it proved comforting, subsumed for many people the crueler realities of 
that era; it also became, because it idealized the past, a blueprint for the 
present. 
</P>
<P>
When he was a television editorialist in the 1950s and '60s, Helms would 
retreat to this fictive world. In 1964, as the currents of the civil rights 
movement flowed through his state, he told his listeners the story of "a young 
Negro mechanic" who had driven him home one day: 
</P>
<P>
"He recalled the days of his boyhood. 'We lived on this white man's place. We 
helped them pick their cotton, and they helped us pick ours. When some of us 
were sick, they come down and looked after us. And when some of them were sick, 
we did the same. We got along just fine for 19 years without a cross word.' " 
</P>
<P>
Declared Helms of the mechanic's tale: "His nostalgic memories of his family's 
relationship with their white neighbors were a contradiction of the evil image 
of the South which the agitators of today constantly seek to build." What's 
more, Helms noted, these "evil images" were "killing such books as 'Uncle 
Remus' and such plays as 'Green Pastures.' " 
</P>
<P>
In Wilmington, and elsewhere, Helms always summons up a bit of that old South, 
touching chords that resonate with unease over the pace of change. But Helms' 
state is changing -- and changing permanently. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 20 years, traditional agriculture (tobacco) and the state's 
principle industries (textiles and furniture-making) have been weakened by a 
reordered national and international economic environment. There is no longer 
one North Carolina. In the west, where the mountains tumble into Tennessee, 
there is deep poverty. Similarly, in much of the state's eastern swath, the 
coastal plain, nearly 25% of the population subsists below the poverty line. In 
contrast, along the central corridor of the state, called the Piedmont, a belt 
of flatland spreading out from Interstate 85 from Charlotte to Raleigh, urban 
growth, universities and high-tech research and development industries compete 
with top institutions in other states. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for every accomplishment that boosts the state's image, many others seem to 
hold it back. No state has a lower industrial wage. With the death of 11.5 out 
of every 1,000 infants born, North Carolina ranks fourth among all states in 
infant mortality. One out of six adults older than 19 is illiterate. And only 
this year did North Carolina manage to push past South Carolina to rank 49th in 
SAT scores. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there is a widening perception among many North Carolinians that the 
state may actually be regressing. "North Carolina used to rely on low wages, no 
unions, the work ethic," says John Dornan, executive director of the 
Raleigh-based Public School Forum, a private group concerned with education 
issues. "We can't do that anymore. As our industries -- textiles and furniture 
-- are hit by Third World competition, we have to rely on education." Billy Ray 
Hall, president of the Rural Economic Development Center, a private, nonprofit 
agency in Raleigh, paints a more despairing picture. "If we don't replace our 
manufacturing base, make investments that make us competitive internationally, 
we aren't going to make it." 
</P>
<P>
The inexorability of change, and the struggle between resisting or encouraging 
it, are at the root of Jesse Helms' appeal. Hoover Adams, the nominally retired 
founder and editor of the Dunn Daily Record in Harnett County, traces his 
friendship with Helms back to the Willis Smith campaign. Adams, who keeps a 
large brass Democratic donkey on his desk, has uneasily watched North Carolina 
evolve. "There's no question," Adams says, "that morals are laxer than they 
used to be. Even around here. You see couples living out of wedlock. You see 
single girls going into bars. In Chapel Hill and Durham, where you have the 
college element, you have a lot of longhair intellectuals -- I don't mean they 
have long hair necessarily -- and they're all liberals. They're not typical of 
small communities in North Carolina." 
</P>
<P>
James H. Pou Bailey, another of Helms' oldest friends, a poker-playing buddy 
and semi-retired judge in Raleigh who used to quietly place a pearl-handled 
revolver on the bench while holding court, nods when asked if Helms might be a 
bit out of step with the times. "I wouldn't disagree that time is passing him 
by," Pou Bailey says. "We grew up when the farmer was king. Now very few people 
are working on the farm. It's a different ball game, and that's led to Jesse's 
success. 
</P>
<P>
"In general, I would guess Jesse would deplore these changes. He wants the 
status quo. But he has enough sense to know these changes are irreversible. 
Take tobacco. Everyone who can see the tip of his nose knows its going down the 
tube. I think deep down in his heart he agrees that change is inevitable. But 
deep down in his heart, he would like to direct that change, to control it. But 
he can't. Given his druthers, he'd like to go back to the romance of 'Gone With 
the Wind,' which never really existed in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
JESSE HELMS IS not running again to eliminate poverty in North Carolina, to 
raise the state's abysmal college-entrance test scores, to improve newborn 
infants' chances of surviving their first year, to halt the degradation of the 
state's environment. In fact, one finds little in Helms' statements, speeches, 
campaign ads or Senate activities to suggest much concern for his state's dire 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, North Carolina's problems are, in Helms' view, of a different order. 
"Never," Helms declared in January as he announced his intention to seek 
reelection, "has America needed prayer more than now. To forget the power of 
prayer and make so much of politics? Everything's political? No, it ain't. No. 
1 is faith in God. . . . I submit to you that a nation that forgets God is 
committing suicide." Next to the primacy of belief in a supreme being (Helms is 
a Baptist with pronounced fundamentalist beliefs) is an unwavering opposition 
to abortion -- which he invariably describes as "the senseless slaughter of 
unborn babies" -- in all instances, except when absolutely essential to save 
the life of the mother. After these two themes, and only after them, does Helms 
discuss his opposition to new taxes (which would "pay for a spending spree of 
Congress"), to the federal deficit ("a bipartisan scandal"), to the return of 
the Panama Canal to the Panamanian government ("because some of those New York 
bankers wanted it to happen to bail them out from a bunch of bad loans made in 
and to Panama") and, most stridently of late, to the erosion of what he calls 
"family values." 
</P>
<P>
"If you'd told me, 10 or 15 years ago, that what's happening today was going to 
happen, I'd have laughed," Helms told the 1,700 supporters gathered for his 
reelection announcement at the State Fairground in Raleigh. "Think about it. 
Homosexuals and lesbians, disgusting people marching in our streets demanding 
all sorts of things, including the right to marry each other. How do you like 
them apples? Isn't our obligation, yours and mine, to get up and do some 
demanding on our own? What about the rights of human beings, born and unborn? 
What about the rights of women who want to stay in the home doing the most 
important job there is -- raising their children?" 
</P>
<P>
Coupled with this focus on traditional values, for the past year, has been a 
relentless assault on the National Endowment for the Arts, triggered by his 
becoming aware of the endowment's funding of works by Andres Serrano, 
particularly his "Piss Christ," a crucifix in a tank of urine, and a series of 
homoerotic photographs by the late Robert Mapplethorpe. Helms did not mince his 
words at the fairground: "What that perverted homosexual filth is, is not 
modern-day Michelangelo. It is modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah." 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, most of these issues have preoccupied Helms since his earliest days 
as a television editorialist. They are passionately held beliefs that emanate 
from the soil of rural North Carolina and from between the covers of the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 18, 1921, Jesse Alexander Helms Jr. was born to a policeman and his 
wife in Monroe, population 3,000. Helms attended, but did not graduate from, 
Wake Forest College before joining the Navy in 1942. He spent most of World War 
II as a recruiter in his home state, and when it ended, Helms returned to 
Raleigh, where he became city editor of the Raleigh Times. Then, in 1948, he 
discovered the budding electronic media, initially in the form of radio station 
WRAL and later its sister television station, where, except for three years 
working for Willis Smith in Washington, he remained until deciding to seek his 
own Senate seat in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
At WRAL-TV, "the Voice of Free Enterprise in Raleigh-Durham," Helms verbally 
battled the rush of integration, the erosion of traditional mores, the tumult 
of student protests against the Vietnam War, social programs, higher taxes, the 
Soviet Union and communism, and liberals on the Supreme Court who ordered 
busing to end segregated schooling in the South and who banned prayer in public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, Helms became known for his virulent antagonism toward the civil 
rights movement. In 1964, while the Senate was debating the provisions of the 
Civil Rights Act (described by Helms as "the single most dangerous piece of 
legislation ever introduced in the Congress"), he regaled his listeners with 
the tale of Walter Honaker, a luncheonette owner who refused to serve black 
customers. "Mr. Honaker's policy, wrong as some may believe it to be, is 
nevertheless no threat to the health or safety of any other citizen," Helms 
said. "He is merely asking that he be left alone to make his decision and to 
succeed or fail as a result of it." This editorial was typical of Helms' 
position on integration, one that invariably found sympathy for the 
practitioners of segregation who became, in his articulation, the real victims. 
</P>
<P>
After a rough-and-tumble campaign in 1972, Helms was sent to the Senate in the 
same year in which Richard Nixon steamrollered George McGovern. The new senator 
brought to Capitol Hill every one of the views he had expressed as a television 
commentator. The difference was that now he was in a position to make his views 
felt in the corridors of power. 
</P>
<P>
ONLY RARELY does a real hint of the passions stirred by Jesse Helms bubble to 
the surface in the Senate. In Septem ber, 1989, during a particularly vigorous 
debate on the Senate floor over a bill to award $20,000 each to the surviving 
Japanese-Americans who were interned during World War II, Sen. Bill Bradley of 
New Jersey castigated Helms to his face for his statements denigrating the 
measure. Eschewing the Senate practice of addressing colleagues through the 
chair, Bradley rose and looked directly at Helms. "I would implore you to use 
some restraint when it comes to issues as sensitive as this," remonstrated 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
Helms' well-honed strategy in the Senate -- attaching an endless string of 
amendments promoting his conservative causes to legislation, putting holds on 
bills in committee and stalling ambassadorial nominations -- has had, in the 
view of Capitol Hill insiders, a paradoxical effect of undermining his 
effectiveness and yet forcing the Senate leadership and the executive branch to 
pay attention to him. 
</P>
<P>
"He will bring the institution to a screeching halt to promote his own agenda 
over the interests of the nation and his state," says one senior Senate staffer 
who has been on the Hill for two decades. "He polarizes people, drives them 
apart." 
</P>
<P>
Another senior staff member sighs when asked about Helms. "The institution can 
only function if the individual power of a senator is exercised on a selective 
basis," he says. "What Helms does is exercise that power constantly on what 
many of his colleagues see as the trivial, aimed at 30-second TV spots rather 
than at serious public policy. There is enormous resentment against that. On 
the other hand, where he triumphs is against the weak. He can really screw up 
somebody's confirmation. Helms discourages the State Department from sending up 
names of people engaged in carrying out controversial policy. He is able to 
exact a price." 
</P>
<P>
Helms' senior aide in Washington, James P. Lucier, says he has heard all this 
before. "On issues that are compromisable, he compromises," Lucier says. "But 
on the issue of whether to compromise with an atheist government, or to kill an 
unborn child, or to raise taxes -- those are issues that precede politics. The 
abortion issue would have disappeared had it not been for Senator Helms. To 
him, it's not an issue. An issue is something you exploit to enlarge your 
constituency." 
</P>
<P>
Like an evaporating puddle on hot pavement, one of Helms' biggest issues has 
almost disappeared in the last year: the Soviet threat. Many people on Capitol 
Hill say the transformation in Eastern Europe is responsible for Helms' 
boisterous attacks on the NEA. One Senate staffer, marveling at Helms' 
political deftness, put it baldly: "Eastern Europe knocked him out of the box. 
Here was paramount evil crumbling before his eyes. Then along came Mapplethorpe 
and his pictures, and Helms had himself a new whipping horse." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was not Helms but New York Sen. Alfonse D'Amato who first stumbled 
across NEA grants to Serrano and Mapplethorpe last year. But D'Amato, a 
Republican who represents a constituency devoted to the arts, was persuaded to 
mute his views, leaving the field to Helms. So far, Helms has seized every 
opportunity to mention the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Often lost amid Helms' high-profile rhetoric has been the real substance of his 
presence on Capitol Hill. This year, North Carolina's major newspapers, which 
Helms lumps together with whomever his opponent happens to be -- this year, 
it's "my eight opponents, Harvey Gantt and the state's newspapers" -- have put 
the senator's legislative record under a microscope. They reveal a senator 
preoccupied not with his state's problems (apart from his rock-hard support for 
agricultural subsidies for tobacco farmers) but almost exclusively with an 
assortment of conservative causes, what have been called "hot-button issues." 
</P>
<P>
Seth Effron, a reporter for the Greensboro News and Record, examined Helms' 
voting record over the past 11 years and came up with a portrait of the senator 
that is largely predictable. Part and parcel of the Helms image is his strong 
support of defense spending, and his record reflects it -- 94 votes to sustain 
or increase the military's budget, with only six to trim funding (to cut the 
U.S. troop presence in Europe, for example). Helms has consistently rejected 
spending on social programs, voting 41 times to oppose increases in, or even 
cut, school lunch, child-care or child-health programs, 16 times against 
college-loan programs, 39 times against job training in public schools and 28 
times to kill or cut the food-stamp program. He also stands firm in his belief 
in the need for religion in public schools and in his opposition to 
integration, voting 17 times to reintroduce prayer in schools and 20 times 
against busing. And though he once voted for an AIDS program to help veterans, 
on 19 occasions he cast votes to cut or eliminate broader AIDS programs. 
</P>
<P>
But Effron also found that there were instances in which Helms abandoned his 
avowed principles. In 1982, he voted to approve a $99-billion tax increase, the 
largest in history. In 1986, Helms voted aye on a measure to raise $15.8 
billion in additional taxes. Moreover, there are times when Helms attempts to 
take credit for projects he has fought against. 
</P>
<P>
At the Wilmington rally, an enthusiastic Helms supporter told a visitor that he 
should be grateful for Helms' efforts to get Interstate 40 built, the highway 
that now runs from Raleigh to the coast. "You can thank Jesse for that," she 
said. In fact, although Helms was conspicuously present at the highway's 
opening, he opposed the project all along, favoring instead the widening of an 
existing state road. 
</P>
<P>
Most political pros in the state think that efforts such as Effron's will have 
little effect on voters. "There's a declining number of people spending time 
reading newspapers," says Thad Beyle, a political scientist at the University 
of North Carolina. "More and more information comes from drive-time radio or 
television. Helms is masterful with the 10-, 15-, 30-second commercial, which 
becomes fact. Political advertising is overtaking truth." 
</P>
<P>
JESSE HELMS HAS stayed in Washington in no small part because he is buttressed 
by a fund-raising machine that knows few rivals in American politics, a font of 
money that generates an endless stream of television commercials. The National 
Congressional Club, a political action committee run by friends from the Willis 
Smith race, and his Helms for Senate Committee have generated millions of 
dollars for him. 
</P>
<P>
When the fury, dust and tears of the Helms-Hunt campaign passed, it became 
clear that Helms had raised and spent $16 million in his winning campaign. The 
most recent campaign finance reports show that he will approach that Senate 
record this year. Not surprisingly, Gantt pursues Helms from a considerable 
financial distance, although his aides have spoken with more confidence of late 
about the inflow of campaign funds, especially from the film industry and arts 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
Since Gantt's Democratic primary victory in June, the Helms campaign, using 
Congressional Club mailing lists, has stepped up its pleas for money, with two 
or more letters going out to the faithful around the country each week. Because 
the letters are sent continuously to the same pool of voters, each is carefully 
worded to avoid repetition. 
</P>
<P>
A letter from Peter Moore Jr., Helms' campaign manager, begins this way: "Dear 
Friend: Have you thought about how devastating it would be if Jesse Helms lost 
his Senate campaign? The very next day, Ted Kennedy would choke up with emotion 
as he congratulated Harvey Gantt on his victory. Liberal reporters would barely 
be able to report their stories -- they would be dancing with glee." 
</P>
<P>
A more recent letter sent out under the signature of Helms' daughter, Jane 
Helms Knox, begins: "Dear Friend of My Father: I have never written a letter 
like this before and nobody knows I am writing it (a little hard to believe 
since it was churned out by the campaign's direct-mail operation). I have never 
known a man more decent, more honorable, more compassionate -- or more 
courageous -- than . . . my Daddy." The letter ends with the standard plea for 
money: "My father needs $63,000 in the next three weeks to keep his reelection 
campaign going." Helms' wife, Dot, has recently started appearing on the 
campaign trail, too. 
</P>
<P>
The Raleigh News and Observer, in a comprehensive review of Helms' campaign 
finance records, found that the average age of frequent contributors was 80. Of 
these supporters, nearly 70% live out of state. 
</P>
<P>
The money Helms will continue to raise right up to Election Day is now being 
poured into television commercials -- Helms' skillfully crafted "attack ads," 
which most political professionals think will ultimately decide the election 
since Helms has chosen not to grant interviews this year. One recent weekend, 
the campaign spent so much money that political ads were running even during 
Saturday morning cartoon shows. "Attack ads are very, very important," says 
Beyle, the political scientist from the University of North Carolina. "Helms 
didn't invent them, but he perfected them. And no one can slug it out with 
Helms ad for ad. He's got too much money." 
</P>
<P>
It is said in North Carolina that Helms was shocked when Gantt won the 
Democratic nomination. Conventional wisdom held that no black person could run 
for statewide office, although 22% of North Carolinians are black. Aware that 
he is dogged by accusations of ingrained racism, Helms made a public statement 
disavowing any appeals to voters on the basis of race. "I told my folks here, 
and I told my folks in Raleigh, that some heads will be cracked if anything is 
done that even appears to be racist." But then, Jesse being Jesse, he added, 
"Now what y'all call racist is one thing." 
</P>
<P>
The first hint that race as an issue had not been fully extinguished came only 
a month later when James Meredith -- the same James Meredith who enrolled at 
the University of Mississippi in 1962, protected by federal troops, and who now 
is a special assistant in Helms' Washington office -- issued a statement 
assailing the delegates to an NAACP convention in Washington. "I have a 
background profile on more than half of the delegates," Meredith wrote on 
Helms' Senate stationery, "and over 60% are involved in the Drug Culture and at 
least 80% are involved in criminal or immoral activities." Two days later, when 
questioned about Meredith's accusations, Helms simply replied that Meredith 
"had a point." 
</P>
<P>
None of Helms' television or print ads have overtly exploited race as an issue. 
As Helms' friend Hoover Adams puts it, "Why would Helms bring up race? 
Everybody can see that Gantt is black." Instead, Helms is intent on depicting 
Gantt as outside what he believes are mainstream North Carolinian principles. A 
typical Helms ad reads: "North Carolina Values vs. Extreme Liberal Values -- 
You Decide. . . ." As has been true in every campaign, Helms mixes the true and 
the false in depicting the opponent he wants North Carolinians to see. His ads 
correctly describe Gantt as opposed to the death penalty but incorrectly accuse 
him of wanting "to cut defense $300 billion" -- the entire defense budget for 
the nation. Another ad charges that Gantt supports abortions in the last 
trimester or for the purposes of selecting the sex of the child. Gantt denies 
this and has done so repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
As one of the most prominent architects in Charlotte, Harvey Gantt derives much 
of his success not from the political maelstrom but from such Helmsian virtues 
as hard work and professional excellence. Indeed, in 1963, television 
commentator Helms, while denouncing Meredith for entering Ole Miss under 
federal bayonets, praised an obscure young man who became the first black to 
enter Clemson: "He has stoutly resisted the pose of a conquering hero for the 
forces of integration. . . . He has rejected the fanfare and trappings of the 
NAACP. . . . He has refused to make pompous speeches and statements. . . . If 
ever a man put his best foot forward, Harvey Gantt has done so." 
</P>
<P>
For two terms, Gantt served as mayor of Charlotte, the city's first black chief 
executive. His color, for better or worse, has made him a household name in 
North Carolina far more rapidly than would have been true had his roots been 
Anglo-Saxon. For his campaign managers, this is a plus. But they must still 
battle the Helms machine and get across Gantt's relatively liberal vision. 
While Gantt expects virtually every black voter to pull the voting lever for 
him, he hopes for support from a significant percentage of white women because 
of Helms' position on abortion. That and a smattering of white male votes are 
the combination that Gantt believes will send him to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Gantt's style at rallies, an easygoing recitation of traditional liberal 
themes, contrasts vividly with Helms' predilection for emotionalism. At a 
September rally in Raleigh jammed with a multiethnic crowd, Gantt spoke softly, 
knowing his words fell on fertile ground. "It's time for us to make some 
changes," he said, "to get on with the business of sending somebody to 
Washington who's interested in bringing people together, not dividing them. . . 
somebody who's attuned to the times we're living in, someone who's concerned 
about the human condition. . . . We ought not be proud of our high infant 
mortality rate. We ought to be concerned about the low-birth-weight babies. We 
ought to be concerned about elderly citizens who work all their lives and can't 
even afford the cost of filling out a prescription. We ought to be challenged 
to do something about it. . . . Folks, isn't that a noble agenda for North 
Carolina to embrace?" 
</P>

After the first week of October, opinion polls showed a virtual dead heat, with 
Helms ahead of Gantt 47% to 46%. Still, Walter De Vries, executive director of 
the North Carolina Institute of Political Leadership in Wilmington, argues that 
the Helms campaign has and will continue to define the shape of the election. 
"This is not a personality race. Helms draws the agenda. This is what the paid 
media does. The Gantt campaign is basically reacting to Helms' paid TV 
commercials, more than to what Helms is saying on the stump or what Helms is 
saying in news conferences because he really doesn't have any." 
</P>
<P>
In its final 10 days, this campaign and its peculiar flavor lead those who care 
deeply about the South to reflect on Helm's place in the region's future -- and 
its past. Prof. Beyle puts Helms squarely in the receding past. "My view is 
that Helms represents the ghost of Christmas past, the way things were and the 
way they want it back -- whether its racial relations, family values, the way 
the economy used to be." 
</P>
<P>
Grasping the phenomenon of Jesse Helms, however, cannot rest solely with 
political science; North Carolina is too linked with a past of interwoven 
illusions and realities to succumb easily to academic analysis. One of the 
South's best-known novelists, Lee Smith of Chapel Hill, has contemplated the 
character, the idiosyncrasies, the humor and suffering of her land for much of 
her adult life. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a big difference between the perception of North Carolina from the 
outside and the reality of politics here inside," she says. "There're all these 
different strains here. There's the country music strain that's linked to 
machismo, drinking a lot, clear emotions, the family. But there's also this 
idea of outlaws, say Waylon Jennings. These people are liberals. 
</P>
<P>
"Jesse Helms, well, I'd say he's part of the Southern tradition of demagoguery. 
It's having a boss. You know, there's this trait of seeming to represent your 
interests against rich people, yet be working for rich people. It's a very 
powerful thing. I think the South is still a place of myth and legend, and if 
you can capture that, you've got everything. There's something about if you 
don't have anything -- you derive your pride from strange sources, like being 
better than black people. There's a real xenophobia. There is a real desire not 
to know. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a desire to perpetuate the Old South, and they want to hold on to it 
all the more now that it's gone. The South is in love with its image of 
itself." She pauses, her eyes wandering off into the distance. Then she says 
quietly, "It's just gone. And it's been gone for 10 years."

A GARDEN IN THREE ACTS; 
</P>
<P>
CAREFUL PLANNING AND PLANTING NOW CAN EXTEND THE SPRING BLOOMING PERIOD ALL THE 
WAY TO AUTUMN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Magazine.

<P>
IN CALIFORNIA, there are actually two springs. First to bloom are the bulbs and 
annuals; then about two months later come the perennials. With luck, the 
perennials flower through summer and into early autumn. So this month -- the 
optimal planting time in Southern California -- you're really planning and 
planting for two springs, plus summer. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, in Louis and Stephanie Snyder's West Los Angeles garden, the bulbs 
and annuals set out the previous fall -- a crisp mix of white and yellow -- 
peaked in March. By mid-May, the garden looked completely different. The bulbs 
and some of the annuals were gone, but the perennials, also planted at the same 
time, had taken their places. The multitude of flowers -- including roses, 
delphiniums, lavender, various salvias and coreopsis -- bloomed off and on and 
were still putting on a respectable show in late September. Many perennials 
grow in the garden for several years before they must be divided or replanted, 
unlike most of the bulbs and annual flowers, which are planted anew every year. 
</P>
<P>
Fall planting is almost foolproof in California. Shorter, cooler days and the 
occasional rain are kind to seeds and seedlings alike. Nature makes roots wait 
until fall to grow, and since most soil diseases are inactive in the autumn, 
anything planted between September and December is almost guaranteed to be off 
to a sure, if somewhat slow, start -- slow compared to the jump-start plants 
get from spring planting. 
</P>
<P>
Fall planting also saves considerable water because plants need less during the 
cooler months, and any rain helps out. This year, many home gardeners are 
waiting to plant until the end of October or even November, when rain is more 
likely, temperatures still cooler and the sun even lower. 
</P>
<P>
Those who like flowers would have a hard time coming up with a better plan than 
the one worked out for the Snyder garden. The long, somewhat narrow area allows 
plenty of room for two deep beds, and the path down the middle makes everything 
accessible. The garden is on the south side of the property so it gets as much 
sun as possible. And the linear plan of this garden is perfectly suited for 
drip irrigation. An in-line system (with the drip emitters hidden inside the 
tubing) or a porous tubing system (in which water leaks through the walls of 
the tubing) could be snaked among the beds. Although the Snyders moved from a 
much larger garden (shown in the Oct. 4, 1987, issue of Los Angeles Times 
Magazine), they have no regrets. In the new, smaller garden, good planning 
created more room for fun things. There is little "filler" -- no lawn or 
shrubbery to speak of -- just lots of flowers, a few dwarf fruit trees, and 
vegetables, which are in another little plot laid out like an early American 
knot garden. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance architect Edward Carson Beall designed the Snyders' house, which looks 
like it was plucked from a New Hampshire field. Instead of taking up the entire 
lot with house, an all-too-common occurrence in California nowadays, Beall 
reserved a long space for a garden and shoehorned the farm-style house around 
it. Even the color of the house (Dunn Edward's Barn Red) was chosen to 
complement the flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Kennedy of Sassafras Nursery and Landscape in Topanga laid out the 
garden, and her sister, Dian Kennedy, cares for it through the seasons. It was 
Sandy who cleverly designed the two rows of flowers to go with the two springs. 
</P>
<P>
In March, the path is lined with white tulips and big 'Mt. Hood' and 
'California Giant' daffodils, with an under story of white sweet alyssum and 
pansies. Much of the gray foliage comes from the low-growing perennials -- 
lamb's ears, lavender and snow-in-summer -- that come to life in time to help 
hide the fading bulbs. The bright yellow clumps nicely placed along the path 
are coreopsis. In spring, Dian plants a few summer-flowering annuals, including 
marigolds, where spring annuals have faded. 
</P>
<P>
The back row is planted with taller perennials and a few late bulbs and 
annuals, like larkspur and watsonia, which peak in May and June and then 
continue off and on into early fall. The tall spires in the back are blue 
delphiniums or pink larkspur and foxgloves, which are replanted every fall. 
</P>
<P>
No space is wasted, not even the space between paving stones (which are simply 
set on a tamped sand base). In these narrow cracks grow lobelia, dwarf yarrow, 
woolly thyme, ajuga, corsican mint, crocus, potentilla and the very dainty 
erodium.

SHERIFF'S DEPT. OFFERS SAFETY ADVICE FOR TRICK-OR-TREATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southeast area law enforcement officials have several tips for Halloween 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
As alternatives to traditional trick-or-treating, the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department advises parents to take their children to parties at a 
neighbor's home or in local parks. 
</P>
<P>
But for those parents who want their children to gather candy door to door, the 
department offered several suggestions. Parents should make sure their children 
start off while there is still light and cross only at corners. 
</P>
<P>
Parents should also dress children in light colors or reflective tape and check 
that the costumes are short enough to avoid being stepped on or getting caught, 
according to the Sheriff's Department. And children wearing masks should 
maintain clear vision. 
</P>
<P>
Children should carry a flashlight to make them easily identifiable on the 
streets, and parents or adults should accompany them at night, according to 
deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Ray Baytos of the Pico Rivera sheriff's station added that parents should 
supervise what kinds of treats their children pick up. Deputies "always tell 
kids to ask for candy that's been wrapped commercially and (avoid) homemade 
popcorn balls," Baytos said. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach Police Department suggested that children use makeup instead of 
a mask and wait until they get home before eating treats.

ISSUE OF BAN ON FIREWORKS CAUSES SPARKS IN CERRITOS

<TEXT>
<P>
Voters here are being asked to tell the City Council on Election Day whether 
they want to bar the sale and use of Fourth of July fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
The referendum on the Nov. 6 ballot is only advisory, but the council has 
promised to abide by the results. 
</P>
<P>
The ballot measure asks voters whether they want to continue the sale and use 
of fireworks, which means a yes vote is a vote against a ban. A no vote 
supports a ban. Fireworks manufacturers and local public-service groups that 
sell them to pay for their activities are waging a campaign against a ban. 
There is no organized effort so far in support of a ban. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers have long argued that it is better to allow what they have dubbed 
"safe and sane" fireworks than to bar all such items, forcing revelers to turn 
to illegal, "unsafe" fireworks that, manufacturers say, cause the fires and 
injuries that occur on the Fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"All the damage that is being attributed to my client's product is totally 
erroneous," said Dennis C. Revell, the Sacramento public relations spokesman 
for American West Marketing, Inc., a fireworks manufacturer.

Revell said that when communities bar the sale and use of all fireworks, the 
incidence of fires and injuries actually increases, because youngsters make 
dangerous explosive devices. Even in cities that allow fireworks, he said, 
fires are ignited by illegal types. 
</P>
<P>
Revell said all five fireworks fires that occurred this year in Cerritos were 
caused by illegal devices, not state-licensed "safe and sane" fireworks. He 
said his statistics came from the Los Angeles County Fire Department, which 
provides the city's fire services. 
</P>
<P>
American West is helping to pay for a mailer campaign against a ban. Revell 
will not say how much the firm is spending and insisted that the campaign is a 
grass-roots effort in cooperation with local Cerritos residents. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 groups each year obtain permits from the city to sell fireworks during 
the week leading up to the holiday. Among them are churches, Little League 
Baseball associations and such civic organizations as the Optimist Club. 
</P>
<P>
The Cerritos Rod &amp; Gun Club, which co-sponsors the city's annual fishing 
derby each June for youngsters under 15, receives about 90% of its annual 
income from fireworks sales, according to Dennis Peterson, past president of 
the club. 
</P>
<P>
The council announced last year that it planned to put the issue on the 
November ballot so groups would have plenty of time to come up with alternative 
fund-raising in case voter sentiment went against fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
However, Peterson said, his group has no alternative in mind. Fireworks sales 
generate $7,000 to $8,000 for the club each year. 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't a lot of activities that you can raise that kind of revenue 
with," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the groups selling fireworks, however, have fared as well financially 
as Peterson's organization. The Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 1846 stopped 
selling fireworks this year. Ray Vargas, past VFW commander, said the group's 
profit turned out to be very small after paying a percentage of the sales to 
the manufacturing firm. 
</P>
<P>
Vargas said the VFW made only about $500 last year. 
</P>
<P>
The VFW membership has mixed feelings about prohibiting fireworks, Vargas said: 
"It's about a 50-50 split, because a lot of residents are living now with shake 
roofs." 
</P>
<P>
When housing tracts were built in Cerritos 20 years ago, the city, as part of 
an effort to ensure uniform designs, required all houses to have shake roofs. 
The wood roofs were less expensive than tile roofs, but city and fire officials 
note that shake can be ignited easily by a bottle rocket or other incendiaries. 
</P>
<P>
New city regulations require that tile be used when a roof is replaced, but 
many residences still have their original roofs -- which is what prompted the 
council to take up the fireworks issue. 
</P>
<P>
Unsure themselves last year whether to outlaw fireworks or let community groups 
go on raising money through sales, council members left the decision up to 
voters.

'ROBERTO'S FAMILY in Colombia would send gifts, and friends saw them displayed 
in the house and loved them," says Vance Grosser, who with partner Roberto 
Concha took a chance when they opened their shop, Foresta. "We felt that the 
art was different enough from other ethnic arts, and Colombia is such a large 
country -- it touches the Caribbean, the Amazon, the mountains -- that it has a 
large area from which to draw crafts." 
</P>
<P>
Foresta is located in downtown Long Beach, currently in the midst of a 
redevelopment boom -- the new World Trade Center and Landmark Square are right 
up the street, and the Metro Rail Blue Line one block away. Specializing in 
arts and handicrafts from South America, its diversity of colorful, 
high-quality wares ranges from sophisticated leather goods (including a 
wonderful shoulder bag that expands to a carry-on flight bag) and chic straw 
hats to primitive werregue canasto, vegetable fiber baskets from the Pacific 
and Amazon regions of Colombia that are so tightly woven they can hold liquids. 
Other Colombian offerings include brightly painted clay bells in the shapes of 
peasant women, friars and birds; hammered copper bowls and pots, and fringed 
cotton scarves that can double as soft, wrapped belts.

IN THE EARLY DAYS of our country, quilts weren't only for keeping people warm; 
some also recorded important events or chronicled everyday life. "Wrapped in 
Glory: Figurative Quilts &amp; Bedcovers 1700-1900," at the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art through Jan. 13, features 32 such creations, including "The 
Suffragette Quilt" (pictured), which illustrates the story of the 
women's-rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
These works differ from floral and abstract quilts of the period: The figures 
are drawn from other images contemporary to the times, such as illustrations in 
ladies magazines. In "The Courting Scenes Bedcover and Shams," says Sandi Fox, 
curator of the exhibition, "the figures present not only the costume but pose 
and movement -- how people stood or worked."

NEW FEDERAL NOISE POLICY WON'T APPLY TO AIRPORT; 
</P>
<P>
REGULATIONS: THE LEGISLATION, PART OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET PACKAGE, EXEMPTS 
FROM FEDERAL REVIEW EXISTING GUIDELINES AT AIRPORTS SUCH AS JOHN WAYNE.

<P>
A new national airport noise policy approved by Congress on Saturday is not 
likely to upset the delicately balanced noise-control agreements that govern 
air traffic at John Wayne Airport, Orange County's top airport official said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the complex budget bill, the House and Senate approved aviation 
legislation that contained the noise-control policy and provisions for new 
passenger fees to finance local airport improvement projects. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation was written to "grandfather," or largely exempt from federal 
review, existing noise policies at airports such as John Wayne, according to 
local officials and congressional aides. 
</P>
<P>
"We're real pleased," said Jan Mittermeier, manager of the county-owned 
airport. "Orange County really went all out to get this grandfather provision 
in there. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt it was just not right to have the contract made with the citizens 
overridden by federal provisions, so we really pulled out all the stops. Our 
congressmen worked very hard to get this through." 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) has expressed concern about the 
extent to which the grandfather language will protect future changes in Orange 
County's noise-control plan. Cox is a member of the House Committee on Public 
Works and Transportation, and lobbied against adoption of the new noise policy. 
</P>
<P>
A noise-control agreement in effect at John Wayne Airport since 1985 bars 
operation of the noisiest, or so-called Stage II, aircraft such as Boeing 747s. 
The agreement mandates that outgoing flights take off no earlier than 7 a.m. 
and no later than 10 p.m., while incoming flights must land before 11 p.m. The 
agreement was reached as part of a settlement of a series of longstanding 
lawsuits that sought to block expansion of the airport. 
</P>
<P>
The grandfather language in the new national noise policy "is clearly intended 
as an exemption for Orange County," Cox said Saturday. "But it's not perfect." 
</P>
<P>
The new noise policy exempts from federal review all local airport noise 
policies in effect on the date of the legislation's enactment. However, future 
changes in local airport noise rules will escape federal scrutiny only if the 
changes do not restrict aircraft operations or affect aircraft safety. 
</P>
<P>
Cox said he could foresee circumstances under which an airline might argue that 
almost any change in an existing noise policy would restrict aircraft 
operations and thus make the change subject to review by the Federal Aviation 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Cox's reservations, Mittermeier said she believes the exemption 
language "will work just fine," because a future amendment to the airport's 
noise-control plan "would not change any of the basic concepts of the plan. It 
would change some of the mechanics." 
</P>
<P>
David C. Coggin, the top aide to Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), who also sits 
on the Public Works and Transportation Committee, agreed with Mittermeier. 
Packard represents southern Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"They can amend the policy at John Wayne and it won't be subject to review 
unless it has a safety impact, which it shouldn't, or unless it would reduce 
aircraft operations, which it shouldn't," Coggin said. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Lichman, a member of the Airport Working Group, the county's most 
influential anti-noise organization, said Saturday she is happy that John Wayne 
Airport appears to be exempt from the new policy. 
</P>
<P>
But she said she and the group remain outraged at "how the bill was passed and 
what it does to other communities" that do not have existing noise restriction 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
"We're happy about our own situation in a parochial way, but we will continue 
to fight the bill, if that means legal action, fine, or additional political 
action," Lichman said. 
</P>
<P>
Cox said overwhelming support from Orange County voters and officials helped 
push through the exemptions, however imperfect they are. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration had sought both the passenger fees and the noise 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner, as well as most major airlines, 
argued that a national noise policy is needed to lend consistency to what 
critics describe as a hodgepodge of local rules and regulations at airports 
across the country. The Department of Transportation estimates that 400 
separate noise rules are in effect across the country. 
</P>
<P>
The new fees, called passenger facility charges, could amount to as much as $12 
for a single, one-way trip. 
</P>
<P>
The charges are expected to generate up to $1 billion nationally every year for 
airport improvements.

BRIEFING: EVENTS IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All Hollow's Eve, in which the traditional ghosts and devils will compete for 
porch space with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Little Mermaids, is 
Wednesday. While Knott's Scary Farm has become the premiere Halloween event in 
the county for adults, there are still plenty of other local haunted houses, 
carnivals and parades. 
</P>
<P>
City-sponsored events on Wednesday include: the city of Orange's Spooky 
Spectacular from 2 to 6 p.m. at 326 E. Almond Ave.; the Haunted House and 
Carnival from 6 to 9 p.m. at the Cypress Community Center, 5700 Orange Ave.; 
Tustin Community Services Department's Halloween Carnival from 6 to 9 p.m. at 
200 S. C St.; and a Haunted House, from 5:30 to 8 p.m., at the Grant Howard 
Park and Community Center, 5th and Iris avenues in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Parents are strongly encouraged by local law enforcement officials to do the 
following if their children will be trick-or-treating door to door: 
</P>
<P>
* Children should not eat anything collected until someone has inspected it for 
tampering. Anything that is unwrapped should be thrown away. If something that 
looks suspicious is found in a child's bag, it should be taken to the local 
police department. 
</P>
<P>
* Costumes should be flameproof, easy to move around in and not impair a 
child's vision. 
</P>
<P>
* Children should stick to their own neighborhood if they are going door to 
door.

Bolsa Chica Field Trip -- The Sea and Sage Chapter of the National Audubon 
Society is sponsoring a field trip to the Bolsa Chica wetlands on Sunday, Nov. 
11. 
</P>
<P>
It is a good time for birders to visit the wetlands, according to field-trip 
chairwoman Nancy Kenyon, because "all the birds that winter here will have 
arrived." 
</P>
<P>
These birds include many shore birds and waterfowl, including ducks, gulls, 
grebes, willets, dowitchers, killdeers and black skimmers. 
</P>
<P>
"The skimmers are pretty spectacular," Kenyon said. "They are fairly large, 
black and white, with bright orange beaks, and skim for their food along the 
top of the water. Other birds, like terns, will be flying and diving." 
</P>
<P>
Those wishing to take part in the field trip should bring binoculars, any bird 
books they might have, and a jacket. Local bird expert Doug Willick will be the 
trip leader. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be about a 2-mile loop of the wetlands, all on flat ground," Kenyon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She added that a special session during the trip will be devoted to beginning 
birders. 
</P>
<P>
"When we do a field trip to a very popular area like Bolsa Chica, we try to 
include something for all levels," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The public is welcome. Those wanting to participate should meet at the 
ecological reserve parking lot, on the inland side of Pacific Coast Highway 
between Golden West Street and Warner Avenue, directly across from Bolsa Chica 
State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Bay Bugs -- Peter Bryant will be the guest speaker at the South Coast Audubon 
Society's regular meeting on Nov. 7. Bryant will discuss the different types of 
bugs to be found in the Back Bay area of Newport Beach. Bryant is the director 
of the Developmental Biology Center at UC Irvine. The meeting will be held at 7 
p.m. at the Orange County Marine Institute, 24200 Dana Point Harbor Drive, Dana 
Point. 
</P>
<P>
Mommy and Me at the Zoo -- The Santa Ana Zoo's program for parents and 
preschoolers begins on Thursday, Nov. 15. It gives children ages 3 and 4 the 
opportunity to learn more about animals through educational games, craft 
projects and touching live animals at the zoo. There will be five sessions held 
from 10 to 11 a.m. on Nov. 15 and 29 and Dec. 6, 13 and 20. Early sign-up is 
urged. Call (714) 836-4000 for more information. The zoo is at Prentice Park, 
1801 E. Chestnut Ave.

SCHOLARSHIP: A TEAM FROM GREAT BRITAIN DEFEATS LAGUNA HILLS HIGH IN AN

<P>
The seconds ticked away as Laguna Hills High School senior Jay Kim sat in mute 
concentration, his brow glistening with sweat from the glare of the television 
cameras set up in a corner of the Red Lion Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"What type of harmony demands a resolution and thus moves the music forward?" 
was the question for the captain of the Laguna Hills High School academic 
decathlon team, the reigning state champs. 
</P>
<P>
Just as the 10-second buzzer sounded, Jay blurted out, "Contrasting harmony." 
</P>
<P>
He was, as the master of ceremonies pointed out, wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry," said emcee Mike Valanti. "It is dissonance. I'm very sorry." 
</P>
<P>
The error cost the nine-member academic decathlon team a hoped-for victory 
Saturday in the 2nd International Academic Telecompetition with the King Edward 
IV Upper School of Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
The competition, sponsored by British Telecom, was held in conjunction with the 
Festival of Britain, a monthlong arts celebration and retail promotion in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Through satellite dishes that transmitted television signals across the planet, 
the teams tested their intellectual prowess while staying right in their own 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
The final score was 260 to 235. If Jay had answered the 30-point question in 
the category of fine arts correctly, the team would have enjoyed a narrow 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
The event marked the beginning of increased international competition among 
young academicians to "help build worldwide bridges," U.S. Education Secretary 
Lauro F. Cavazos said in a taped message. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, this event will serve as an educational springboard to academic 
decathlons around the world," Cavazos said in his message broadcast to 
audiences in the United States and Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Hills academic decathlon team was chosen to represent the United 
States because it won the state championship last year and went on to place 
second in the national competition. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted the (best) Orange County team because the Festival of Britain is in 
Costa Mesa," said county Department of Education Supt. Robert Peterson, who 
founded the International Decathlon for Academics Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The first competition was held in March 21, 1986, between students from 
Belfast, Northern Ireland, and Foothill High School in Tustin, Peterson said. 
The Foothill High School team won that contest. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's hourlong question-and-answer duel between the two high school teams 
was a precursor to a competition scheduled in May for students from 14 
countries, Peterson said. That competition is tentatively scheduled to be held 
at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not at all perturbed," Peterson said about the outcome. "It was to work 
out the kinks so that next May we can have a successful competition." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from a few audio problems, the bugs were kept to a minimum, despite the 
two audiences being 6,000 miles apart. 
</P>
<P>
A segment touting 15-year-old Laguna Hills High School during the competition's 
halftime did not include voice-overs for the British audience, and some answers 
by British students in response to reporters' questions in Costa Mesa were cut 
out or unintelligible. 
</P>
<P>
The most controversial portion of the show occurred when Laguna Hills High 
School senior George Danenhauer could not complete the sentence, "The velocity 
of a sky diver after 10 seconds of free fall will be . . . " 
</P>
<P>
George turned the question over to fellow senior Todd Faurot, who quickly 
answered that the sky diver would be traveling 100 meters per second. 
</P>
<P>
The correct answer, according to the judge, was 98 meters per second, which 
Todd challenged briefly. Later, he complained that both answers should have 
been correct, saying that in a science competition last year, he had answered a 
similar question using 98 meters per second. 
</P>
<P>
That answer was deemed wrong, he said, and judges at that time said that the 
correct answer was 100 meters per second. 
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be a differing opinion about that," Todd said, adding that if 
given the points, the team would have won the competition. In fact, if Kim had 
correctly answered the last question, the Laguna Hills team would have edged 
the British team. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pretty upset," Todd said. "It was a disappointment to me personally." 
</P>
<P>
Other students expressed disappointment as well, but congratulated the British 
team on a job well done. 
</P>
<P>
"Their team was just more prepared than we were," said senior Sian Baker, who 
emigrated from England six years ago and is planning to become a journalist.

PEDESTRIAN, MOTORCYCLIST KILLED IN ACCIDENTS

Two people died of injuries they suffered in separate weekend traffic 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Placentia police said Myung Park, 81, died early Saturday morning at UCI 
Medical Center after she was struck by a car Friday evening while crossing 
Yorba Linda Boulevard, west of Brookhaven Street. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Park was walking south on Yorba Linda about 5:27 p.m. Friday when 
she was hit. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was taken to UCI Medical Center where she was pronounced dead at 1:08 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car was not identified and police said they did not plan to 
file criminal charges in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The second victim, Eric Stephon Winfield, 22, of La Mirada, was killed early 
Saturday when he apparently lost control of his motorcycle while rounding a 
curve on Irvine Center Drive in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Winfield's 1990 Suzuki cycle struck the median shortly before 1 
a.m., slid across the roadway and into westbound traffic lanes, where he was 
struck twice. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield was hit first by a 1983 Ford van. Police said the driver pulled to the 
side of the road after hitting the man in the 9600 block of Irvine Center 
Drive, then continued on to the Irvine Meadows Amphitheater to call police. 
</P>
<P>
While another motorist attempted to direct traffic around the accident scene, 
witnesses said, the motorcyclist was hit a second time by an unknown driver who 
fled the scene and is now being sought by authorities. Winfield was pronounced 
dead at the scene. 
</P>

MIKE PENNER: MISDIRECTION PLAY HAS THE TITANS HEADED DOWN AND OUT

<TEXT>
<P>
The play is named "the naked bootleg" because it's supposed to fake the pants 
off the defense and misnamed because it suggests that there's nothing left to 
strip. 
</P>
<P>
With 2:23 remaining in Saturday's game against Cal State Long Beach, Paul 
Schulte and the rest of the Cal State Fullerton Titans learned the truth about 
the naked bootleg. When Schulte, the quarterback, took the center snap, rolled 
left and got rolled by Long Beach linebacker Pepper Jenkins, all sorts of 
things were stripped. 
</P>
<P>
The football. 
</P>
<P>
A one-point Fullerton lead. 
</P>
<P>
And, ultimately, any real hope the Titans had of avoiding the worst won-lost 
record in the school's football-playing history. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton had a 35-34 victory in the palm of its hand when Schulte lined up 
over center for the final time Saturday. Barring disaster, the Titans were in 
complete control -- they had the football, a second-and-nine play near midfield 
and an opponent with no timeouts. 
</P>
<P>
But you know the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
Disaster wasn't barred. 
</P>
<P>
The following nine seconds were the longest of this sorry Fullerton season. 
Schulte went with the play Coach Gene Murphy sent in from the sideline and went 
against the grain, which is the way the play is designed. Blockers go one way, 
quarterback goes the other. 
</P>
<P>
It is a risky play to begin with, because it leaves the quarterback all alone, 
isolated. Naked. Long Beach Coach George Allen, whose team scored one touchdown 
on a halfback option pass and set up another with a flanker reverse, flinched 
at the sight of this one, calling it nothing less than "a real gamble." 
</P>
<P>
It became riskier still with the player Murphy chose to run it. The best man 
for the job, probably, was Dale Bunn, but Bunn, the old option operator, ran 
out of eligibility in 1978 and now coaches linebackers for Murphy. The call 
instead went to Schulte, whose best footwork takes him as far as the back of 
the pocket. Murphy calls Schulte a tough kid, "a stallion," but in the open 
field, his stride more closely resembles that of a Clydesdale. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins, meanwhile, is a lean, mean, sacking machine, the 49ers' top defensive 
player. He lines up on the outside and doesn't take long to get inside, as his 
team-leading 16 tackles illustrated Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In the post-mortem, even Murphy had to admit: "When it's Jenkins against 
Schulte, there is no trickery involved." 
</P>
<P>
So why call the play at all? 
</P>
<P>
"Long Beach was out of timeouts, we wanted to hang onto the ball, go 
north-south, and stay on the wide side of the field," Murphy said. "We wanted 
to keep (Schulte) in bounds and keep the clock running. 
</P>
<P>
"He just got run down by a great athlete." 
</P>
<P>
More than that, Jenkins ran down the football. As he popped Schulte, Jenkins 
also sprung loose the ball, sending it bounding into the arms of defensive end 
Ed Lair at the Fullerton 44. 
</P>
<P>
Two minutes later, the 49ers were at the Fullerton three, and Sean Cheevers' 
chip-shot field goal turned the Titans into 37-35 losers. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the game," Schulte kept saying, hoping to convince himself. "I was 
trying to get as much yardage as I could. I was just trying to stay in bounds 
and get as much as I could. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins hit Schulte a yard behind the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
Schulte got as much as he could. 
</P>
<P>
As did Long Beach. Schulte wondered aloud about the fumble. He wondered if it 
actually should have been ruled a dead ball instead of the live wire it 
eventually became. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was close to being down," Schulte said. "I thought I was right on 
the ground, or at least very close to it." 
</P>
<P>
That sounded very close to sour grapes, which Schulte quickly noticed and cut 
off at the pass. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have had two hands on it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That's the kind of year it has been for Fullerton. That's the kind of year it 
has been for Schulte. On the cusp of the finest game of his college career -- 
Schulte shredded an indecisive Long Beach secondary for 343 yards and three 
touchdowns -- he loses everything but the statistics on one misdirected 
misdirection play around left end. 
</P>
<P>
This was going to atone for the five interceptions in the 48-17 loss to Akron. 
</P>
<P>
This was going to erase the sting of the six sacks against Hawaii and the five 
against Auburn and the four against Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
This was going to make all the pounding -- the bone- and soul-jarring hits 
Schulte is forced to endure play after play, Saturday after Saturday -- worth 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"He's taken a beating this year," Murphy says with empathy. "He's spent a lot 
of time on his back." 
</P>
<P>
But the cruelest hit was delivered by Jenkins, for all it meant to this 
Fullerton season, now the favorite to become the worst of all Fullerton 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's defeat left the Titans 1-8 with three games to play. The opponents 
in those games: San Jose State (co-leader of the Big West), Utah State (which 
tied the Big West's other co-leader, Fresno State, and lost to San Jose by a 
touchdown) and New Mexico State. New Mexico State is winless, but the game will 
be in Las Cruces, so you never know. 
</P>
<P>
Assume a victory at New Mexico State. That would make these Titans 2-10. The 
previous low at Fullerton is 2-9, set in 1975, Fullerton's first season at the 
Division I-A football level. 
</P>
<P>
"We've experienced a lot of frustration this year," Schulte said, "but I still 
enjoy it. I love football." 
</P>
<P>
Football, however, refuses to reciprocate. And unrequited love is the saddest 
love of all.

LINEBACKER REAL LIVE WIRE AFTER BRUSH WITH DEATH 
</P>

<P>
You never know about Aaron Gutridge, Tustin High School's surprise-a-minute 
linebacker. One moment he's a super- charged competitor, and the next, he's a 
pious lad, deep in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever he does, though, you can be sure he will be thankful for the 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, Gutridge and five teammates were driving home from a late night 
visit to Tijuana. Gutridge fell asleep at the wheel and their small pickup 
truck hit the center divider and flipped three times on Interstate 5 near 
Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
The three players in the back of the truck were thrown clear, landing in some 
bushes. 
</P>
<P>
Amazingly, no one was killed; all escaped serious injury except truck's owner, 
Steve Yu, who suffered a concussion and head wounds. He was hospitalized in La 
Jolla for three days but released after X-rays and CAT scans showed no serious 
injuries. This year, he is a part-time starting lineman for Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a miracle," said Gutridge, who said no alcohol or drugs were 
involved. "I woke up, and the windows were crashing in. When I turned around, 
the guys in the back of the truck were gone. I got out of the car and ran into 
the center lane, trying to stop someone. Nobody would stop. I ran across the 
freeway to a call box. The (dispatcher) couldn't tell what I was saying . . . I 
was so freaked out." 
</P>
<P>
Gutridge says the brush with death helped him put life in perspective. He says 
he lives every day as if it were his last. 
</P>
<P>
That attitude is apparent when Gutridge, a three-year starter, takes the field. 
His high-flying intensity is one reason Tustin, the county's third-ranked team, 
is 8-0, 3-0 in the Sea View League. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night against Newport Harbor, Gutridge intercepted a pass at Newport's 
10 and returned it for a touchdown. When he reached the end zone, he flipped 
the ball over his shoulder and accidentally hit a referee in the nose with it. 
</P>
<P>
He rushed to the sideline shouting "rad," "killer," and "dude" at his 
teammates, then knelt down and spent a few minutes alone in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
Such a persona deserves a quick character sketch: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gutridge is a 17-year-old senior who pours rubbing alcohol over his cleanly 
shaven head because he likes to "feel the burn." During games, he strides over 
to the team water jug and submerges his head in the icy water. "It helps me 
breathe," he said. His teammates still drink it throughout the game, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gutridge collects dolls -- GI Joes, actually. He has been collecting them 
all his life and has in his closet enough GI Joes, toy tanks, planes, 
helicopters and Jeeps to relieve half of the U.S. forces in the Middle East. He 
packs his lunch in a GI Joe lunch pail. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He has in his bedroom a toy bunny hanging in a noose from the ceiling. The 
rabbit has a knife stuck in its head, courtesy of Gutridge, who says he loves 
animals, especially his cat, Rambo. 
</P>
<P>
 -- His favorite movie is not "The Terminator," "Bloodsport," or the Rambo 
series. It's "The Little Mermaid." He even bought the soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
His father doesn't know what to think of his spontaneous, quick-thinking, 
never-a-dull-moment son. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just a weird kid," Lyn Gutridge said. "But we're just happy he's still 
with us." 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, California girls. Nebraska volleyball Coach Terry Pettit thinks you're 
overrated as volleyball players. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the biggest myths the last couple of years is the best volleyball 
players come from Southern California," Pettit told USA Today. "Nebraska is a 
hotbed of volleyball. It is the premier sport for ladies in the state of 
Nebraska." 
</P>
<P>
That's interesting. Volleyball Monthly's latest national rankings show La Habra 
at No. 3, Corona del Mar at No. 4, El Toro at No. 16, and Laguna Beach at No. 
17. 
</P>
<P>
No Nebraska team was ranked in the top 20. 
</P>
<P>
Say Iemsisanith, the Anaheim linebacker injured Thursday in a game against 
Savanna, will be out for the season, Anaheim Coach Raul Victores said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Victores said Iemsisanith bruised his spinal column and doctors told him to 
give up football this year. 
</P>
<P>
"He's OK, but he's still in a lot of pain," Victores said.

OCC RETURNS INTERCEPTION 98 YARDS, WINS

It wasn't a record, but Lawrence Hatch's 98-yard interception return for a 
touchdown changed the momentum in Orange Coast College's 24-19 victory over 
Saddleback in a Mission Conference football game Saturday at OCC. 
</P>
<P>
Hatch, a sophomore defensive back, was a yard short of the OCC record. Mike 
Lacy (1973) and Bill Craft (1986) each returned interceptions 99 yards for 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Hatch's interception occurred with Orange Coast leading, 10-7, but Saddleback 
was driving. On second and five at the OCC 16, Hatch stepped in front of a 
Saddleback receiver and caught the ball. He started up the middle, then cut to 
the left sideline and ran nearly untouched into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast scored later in the second quarter to take a 24-7 halftime lead. 
Saddleback scored a touchdown in the each of the final two quarters, the last 
with 52 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback quarterback Jeff Bailey completed a 28-yard scoring pass to Terry 
Isles, but the two-point conversion pass fell incomplete. Saddleback's onside 
kick went out of bounds at the OCC 37, and the Pirates ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense made some big plays," OCC Coach Bill Workman said. "We stayed 
conservative the second half and played the clock some. We won, and that's what 
is important." 
</P>
<P>
OCC (5-2, 4-2) was coming off a 43-15 loss to Rancho Santiago in which the 
Pirates turned the ball over seven times. They turned the ball over only twice 
against Saddleback, both on interceptions by Mike Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback's four-game winning streak was stopped. Each team is 1-1 in Central 
Division play. 
</P>
<P>
OCC took the opening kickoff and drove to the Saddleback 16 but settled for a 
31-yard field goal by Mike Wade. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback (4-3, 4-2) came back with a 14-play, 82-yard scoring drive that 
ended on a two-yard dive by Matt Carvalho that made it 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
OCC quarterback Greg Angelovic then led a 58-yard drive that he capped with a 
four-yard run for a touchdown to give OCC a 10-7 lead with 12:10 left in the 
half. Hatch's interception came at 10:47. 
</P>
<P>
OCC scored its final touchdown on a one-yard run by Jim Warren with 3:49 left 
to take a 24-7 lead. Angelovic was 11 for 16 for 173 yards, and his favorite 
targets were tight ends Derek Whiddon and Mark Rapp. Whiddon had six catches 
for 81 yards and Rapp had two for 53 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback's Chi Chi Biehn scored on a one-yard run with 2:21 left in the third 
quarter, but the extra-point attempt by Scott Hannah was wide and OCC led, 
24-13. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey was 18 for 31 for 210 yards, but three passes were intercepted.

THE LEGEND OF JIMMY SPOON BY KRISTIANA GREGORY (GULLIVER BOOKS/HARCOURT BRACE

Here's a puzzle: Would a 12-year-old white boy, taken from his home and family 
-- unexpectedly but not altogether unwillingly -- and plunked into a place of 
honor with an Indian band, accept his new role without question or objection? 
</P>
<P>
The year is 1854, the place Utah. Jimmy Spoon is mad at his father because he 
can't have a horse until his 14th birthday. Two Indian boys appear and offer 
him a horse if he'll visit their chief's mother -- or that's how Jimmy 
understands the invitation. Once he reaches the Shoshone camp, it becomes clear 
that the Indians mean for him to stay and be Chief Washakie's little brother. 
Why? Jimmy doesn't ask. He finds out much later, and then only by accident. 
</P>
<P>
He spends three years with the Shoshone, learning their ways and becoming a 
respected tribe member in his own right. Then he goes back to his family. 
That's it. That's the whole tale. 
</P>
<P>
This is a piece of historical fiction rich in its portrait of Indian philosophy 
and daily life but skimpy in the basics of story: character and plot. Jimmy 
learns to hunt, fish, tan hides and pluck the tail feathers of an eagle without 
harming the bird. He slowly becomes aware and ashamed of white people's 
imperialistic brutality toward the Indians. He observes how the Indian notion 
of a Great Spirit figures in all aspects of life, in contrast to the 
once-a-week religion he grew up with. He questions the need for war, and 
ultimately gets a chance to prevent a war by his own action. 
</P>
<P>
But why don't the Indians wonder why he so eagerly leaves his family and 
community? They don't ask him about it until the very end of the book. Why 
doesn't he ask them why they want him in the first place? And there's the 
matter of scalping, which is described but unfortunately not explored. Why 
doesn't Jimmy ask for some explanation or justification of an act he finds so 
repulsive? Why doesn't Jimmy try to contact his parents, and why do they wait 
three years before trying to get him back? 
</P>
<P>
Compressing three years' time into a children's book may leave little space for 
adequately developing character. Still, there's not enough depth even to the 
central figure of Jimmy to make us laugh with him, ache with him, or care very 
much what happens to him. Eileen Heyes

OUR SIXTH-GRADE SUGAR BABIES BY EVE BUNTING (HARPERCOLLINS CHILDREN'S BOOKS:

Babies, boys and big ears. These are the things on Vicki's mind. Babies, 
because she and her sixth-grade classmates have been assigned to carry around 
five-pound bags of sugar for a week as a lesson in what parental responsibility 
might be like. Boys, because a cute seventh-grade one has moved in across the 
street. And big ears, because she suffers from the fear that hers are 
unacceptably large. 
</P>
<P>
Vicki, narrator of "Our Sixth-Grade Sugar Babies," shares her insecurities and 
insights -- such as they are -- with the self-deprecating humor of a 
pre-adolescent aching to grow up. She and her overly freckled friend Ellie are 
gaga over the new boy, whom they call Thunk -- for Terrific Hunk. In her quest 
to appear terribly cool (or at least not be a total dweeb) before Thunk, Vicki 
ditches her sugar baby. Her deception seems to lead to the disappearance of an 
elderly neighbor, and Vicki must find them both and decide just how far to go 
in owning up to her errors. 
</P>
<P>
Vicki's family situation is pure '90s: She lives with her mother, a CPA who 
works at home. Her father, who fancied himself an artistic genius, ran off in 
search of his fortune when Vicki was a baby and only recently reappeared -- 
remarried and now father to a 4-year-old, a half-sister Vicki very much wants 
to be close to. 
</P>
<P>
With affection and sensitivity, author Eve Bunting captures the triumphs, the 
agonies and the self-absorbed melodrama of being an 11-year-old female. Vicki 
on her ears: "My Dumbo ears are my two biggest problems in life, requiring 
constant vigilance." On sixth-grade boys: He "hooked a finger around the rubber 
band that stretches across his top teeth, and pinged. . . . We do have the most 
disgusting boys in sixth grade. Not much wonder Ellie and I are attracted to 
more mature types." On an attractive seventh-grade girl: "Cynthia hurried along 
on the opposite side of the street, her hair bouncing nicely against the back 
of her neck. Ellie and I have tried to make our hair bounce like that, but 
there must be a trick to it and it's a trick we don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Bunting's story can be excused for giving rather short shrift to characters 
other than Vicki. Sensible Mom, elegant Mrs. Oda, even adorable Thunk come off 
as two-dimensional -- but perhaps that's as much as young Vicki can perceive. 
And the neat solution to Vicki's social-life woes, involving a boy's sudden 
change in behavior and Vicki's equally sudden and inexplicable change in 
attitude, comes too easily and abruptly to be credible. 
</P>
<P>
But this light, funny and well-crafted tale will entertain the pre-pubescent 
set who are beginning to confront the very important problems of babies, boys 
and big ears. Eileen Heyes

ISLAND OF THE BLUE DOLPHINS BY SCOTT O'DELL ILLUSTRATED BY TED LEWIN (HOUGHTON 
MIFFLIN: $18.95; 181 PP.; ALL AGES) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The reissue of "Island of the Blue Dolphins," Scott O'Dell's first and 
best-known work for children, may seem at odds with an adult's memory of the 
book as it first was published 30 years ago. The dull, musty library volume 
that was passed ceremoniously among children has been replaced with a 
rejuvenated, deluxe edition carrying luminous new illustrations by an artist 
hand-picked by O'Dell. 
</P>
<P>
Although O'Dell's recent death is mentioned in the amusing, generous 
introduction, the copyright page still lists only an open-ended annotation: 
Scott O'Dell, 1903- . Perhaps it's a sign; a really good yarn-spinner is never 
gone, as long as the stories go on being spun. 
</P>
<P>
O'Dell's view of a paradise lost takes its seed from a historical incident he 
learned of during his early years on the California coast. Karana, a 
12-year-old member of an island clan, finds herself in a solitary struggle for 
survival in a primeval setting. The fragile ecosystem of the girl's island home 
is disrupted by greedy hunters who plunder the sea lions and then kill most of 
the men of her tribe. 
</P>
<P>
When she and her younger brother are left behind by the ship that bears away 
her people, Karana must battle what seems to be all of nature. Wild dogs kill 
her brother; there are earthquakes, tidal waves, new seasons of hunters and 
endless solitude. She finds a measure of contentment during her survival and 
takes pleasure in small comforts -- the company of creatures she has tamed (and 
whose flesh she vows never again to eat), a pair of handmade earrings. She also 
acquires knowledge of weapon making, a skill taught only to boys. 
</P>
<P>
Man as hunter or shepherd, the island as planet, the encounter with nature -- 
these are but some of the large human themes dramatized in this story. Perhaps 
a male protagonist would have tried to sail beyond the horizon, or attempted to 
conquer the less-than-tame aspects of his surroundings. But O'Dell seems to 
insist that the feminine inclination to tend rather than confront is not only 
preferable but ultimately indispensable for humankind's survival. In the 
subsuming need to nurture, Karana is ultimately incapable of vengeful action. 
The pack of mad dogs is a reminder that nature may be cruel -- but that there 
is no place for premeditated and worthless killing. 
</P>
<P>
In the world of blue dolphins (so different from that of the white whale), 
O'Dell expresses an Edenic belief that human nature is essentially good and is 
corrupted only by social intercourse and the prejudices of urban life. But the 
author's equally strong conviction that there is a basic human need for 
companionship leads the older Karana to the evolutionary step from living in 
nature to "civilized" life. At age 30, the heroine finds solace in the shadows 
of her rescuers, smiling her welcome and wearing face paint to indicate her 
virginity, ready to be inducted into the society of others. Kimberly Olson

MY INDECISION IS FINAL; THE RISE AND FALL OF GOLDCREST FILMS BY JAKE EBERTS AND 
TERRY ILOTT (ATLANTIC MONTHLY PRESS: $29.95; 678 PP.)

Remember Goldcrest? Remember the flash of British film in the early '80s that 
gave us David Puttnam, Richard Attenborough, Roland Joffe and Hugh Hudson? 
Remember "Local Hero," "Chariots of Fire," "Gandhi" and "The Killing Fields"? 
These were all Goldcrest films and Goldcrest film makers, and at its height, 
the company's product racked up an unprecedented 19 Oscars, including Best 
Picture two years in a row -- "Chariots of Fire" in 1981 and "Gandhi" in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Then, suddenly, the man who founded and was most closely identified with the 
company abruptly left, his successors dropped two bombs -- "Revolution" and 
"Absolute Beginners" -- and it was all over -- history, as they say. 
</P>
<P>
"My Indecision Is Final" is an attempt to excavate that history: It is the 
story of a company that rode the crest of a wave of hits to become the great 
white hope of the British film industry, and then crashed and burned. 
</P>
<P>
The Goldcrest story is not an unfamiliar one -- too many independents in the 
last decade have suffered a similar trajectory. What is unusual about this book 
is the writers' extraordinary access to the records and recollections of the 
principals and the stunning attention to detail which informs their 
presentation. This, in an industry that throws a cloak of secrecy over all but 
the most trivial details of celebrity and production gossip. In fact, this 
678-page book, whose 61 chapters, preface, postscript and two appendices are 
studded with spreadsheets, charts, graphs and undigested chunks of minutes from 
board meetings, is not for the casual reader; rather, it is more of a how-to or 
how-not-to book for aspiring producers and venture capitalists. 
</P>
<P>
That being said, "My Indecision Is Final" is by no means uninteresting. A 
virtual primer to the movie business, it is told in tandem by two writers: 
company founder and production head Jake Eberts writing in the first person, 
and journalist Terry Ilott writing in the third, picking up and filling in when 
Eberts' career took him away from Goldcrest and providing a perspective that 
complements Eberts' personal account. 
</P>
<P>
When the story begins, Eberts is a mildly unsuccessful financier who drifts 
more or less by accident into raising development money for movies at a point 
when the British film industry is pretty much moribund. Eberts was to benefit 
from his own enormous energy, his uncommonly good common sense and his 
considerable skill in negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
After some initial modest successes, he stumbled onto David Puttnam and, 
knowing a good thing when he saw it, brought him into the fold. Then he met 
Richard Attenborough, and was sufficiently charmed by his enthusiasm and 
impressed by the "Gandhi" script to throw his weight behind the film at a time 
when it mattered. When "Gandhi" became a huge hit and succes d'estime, 
Goldcrest prospered and gradually became a company that not only developed, but 
produced. 
</P>
<P>
It prided itself on making films that mattered with a small group of 
experienced film makers in an atmosphere of trust and mutual respect, a far cry 
from the ethos of the ego and the deal that reigned across the ocean. But while 
Goldcrest was a "directors' company," Eberts also applied shrewd business 
criteria to the scripts he developed, and protected Goldcrest from too much 
financial exposure to any individual project. 
</P>
<P>
As the company became more successful, it also became more attractive to 
others, including one James Lee, who moved over from Pearson Longman, one of 
Goldcrest's main investors. Eberts, increasingly unhappy with the company he 
founded, was being strenuously courted by Jerry Perenchio at Embassy, and when 
Lee wouldn't meet Eberts' salary requirements, Eberts left for Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Lee, by all accounts a smart and energetic executive, had a lot of ambition but 
very little experience running a film company. He and the people he hired 
committed Goldcrest to three expensive and commercially problematic movies -- 
"Revolution," "Absolute Beginners" and "The Mission." Two bombed while "The 
Mission" did disappointing business. 
</P>
<P>
Hobbled by escalating overhead and a money-losing television division, 
Goldcrest was on the ropes. Eberts returned in an effort to save the company, 
but it was too late. Near bankruptcy, Goldcrest finally was sold in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The second half of the book is more interesting, because -- pace Horatio Alger 
-- however edifying the story of Eberts cobbling together Goldcrest, disaster 
always is more compelling than success. 
</P>
<P>
The best parts are the descriptions of the manner in which Eberts was seduced 
and abandoned by Jerry Perenchio. There is a highly amusing account of a dinner 
at Michael's with Perenchio and John Boorman, in which an intoxicated and 
unnamed Perenchio assistant boorishly attacked the script for "Emerald Forest"; 
and another description of a conference call among Eberts, Perenchio and a 
number of Bear Stearns investment bankers -- whom Eberts needed to sponsor his 
campaign to raise $100 million for Embassy -- during which Perenchio, after a 
night of serious partying, astonished the straight-laced bankers by giving them 
his rendition of "Blue Moon," thus dooming the prospectus before it got off the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
But if "My Indecision Is Final" bears a passing resemblance to "Final Cut," 
with "Revolution's" Hugh Hudson as its Michael Cimino, it lacks the drama of 
huge Hollywood egos in collision. It gives us black Bentleys rolling silently 
down London streets instead of Harleys on Mulholland. 
</P>
<P>
This is England, after all, and everyone is well behaved, gentlemanly and 
curiously muted. There are no heroes and villains here, and even at the end -- 
when some of the principals get to point fingers, to lay blame for the 
Goldcrest fiasco -- Eberts' mildly accusatory section is full of phrases like 
"partly my fault . . ." and "I share some of the blame." This may be a virtue, 
and Eberts' restraint may be commendable, but it would make -- let's face it, a 
dull movie. 
</P>
<P>
Worse, at the end of the book, after we have followed Goldcrest through every 
turn in every highway and byway, the book is curiously inconclusive. And not 
only does "Indecision" resist laying blame, it resists drawing any lessons 
whatsoever from the events it so circumstantially records. Neither of the 
writers is good enough to really bring the story to life, so finally, we have 
to ask, "So what?" 
</P>
<P>
It may indeed be, as the authors argue, that the collapse of Goldcrest marked 
the end of British investment in its own film industry and the resumption of 
Hollywood hegemony, which is indeed a pity. But it is well to remember that 
Goldcrest had no hand in the most exciting films that came out of Britain in 
the '80s, films like "Sid and Nancy," "The Long Good Friday," "Prick Up Your 
Ears" and "My Beautiful Laundrette." 
</P>
<P>
It's true that Goldcrest won a lot of Academy Awards, but that says only that 
there was an affinity between the Academy audience in its Sunday best out to do 
the right thing and the kinds of uplifting, well intentioned, missionary films 
("The Mission" was an apt title) in which Goldcrest specialized. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Eberts, summing up Goldcrest's achievement, says that it 
succeeded in competing with Hollywood on Hollywood's own terms, but this is, 
perhaps, more of a mixed blessing than he realizes.

<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON

<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Thompson's dark, chilling portrait of a two-bit sheriff in a jerkwater 
Southern town is best known as the source of Bernard Tavernier's film, "Coup de 
Torchon." Beneath his simple, good ol' boy exterior, Nick Corey conceals a 
vicious, calculating mind that enables him to pit his enemies against each 
other and continue eating, drinking, whoring and murdering. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson is a master of plot construction, and Corey's numerous intrigues 
dovetail as neatly as the sliding panels of a Chinese puzzle box. 
</P>
<P>
"Pop. 1280" inaugurates the Vintage reissues of the "Black Lizard" pulp crime 
novels published in the mid-'80s by the Creative Arts Book Co. in Berkeley. 
Included in the initial release are "The Grifters," "The Getaway" and "A Hell 
of a Woman" by Thompson; "The Burnt Orange Heresy" and "Pick-Up" by Charles 
Willeford; "Shoot the Piano Player" and "Black Friday" by David Goodis, and 
"The Hot Spot" by Charles Williams. Vintage has announced plans to publish 
three additional titles every two months during 1991.

Holley makes no mention of it, but one has to wonder if Bill Bryson, author of 
"The Mother Tongue," credits Sir Walter Scott at least in a footnote for the 
original observation ("Ivanhoe," 1819) that "after the invasion of the Norman 
French, the animals in the fields retained Anglo-Saxon names . . . but their 
meat, once brought to the table, was French."

'MERCI TRAIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am researching the French "Merci Train" of 1949, composed of 48 boxcars sent 
to the United States from France after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The cars were filled with gifts and designated to be delivered in each state. 
</P>
<P>
I am trying to locate people who remember the train, its arrival in the United 
States and what has become of the boxcars and gifts. More important, I am 
looking for information on the sentiment in France leading to the gesture of 
thanks.

CHERCE, BUT CRIBBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Kenneth Turan's review of "Preston Sturges" (Sept. 16), you quote Spencer 
Tracy from the movie "Pat and Mike" in praising the book (". . . may be lean, 
but it is cherce"). 
</P>
<P>
Spencer Tracy may have interpreted the lines beautifully, but Ruth Gordon and 
Garson Kanin wrote them. 
</P>
<P>
I have seen reviewers and journalists quote actors' lines from films for years 
as if the actors who spoke the lines actually invented them. This is a sorry 
practice, if journalistically convenient, especially when the article is about, 
in your own words, "the most gifted writer/director of comedy that Hollywood 
has ever seen."

It seemed impossible that Clover Adams, described as having "acerbic wit" in 
Florence King's review of "The Five of Hearts" by Patricia O'Toole (Sept. 23), 
could have gotten the good joke about Henry James backwards. 
</P>
<P>
My research (with thanks to the reference staff of the Glendale Public Library) 
finds the following in a letter from Adams to her father, dated December, 1881: 
"It is not that he (James) 'bites off more than he can chaw,' as T. G. Appleton 
said of Nathan, but he chaws more than he bites off."

ENVIRONMENTAL MEASURES STRUGGLING, TERM LIMITS FAVORED, POLL INDICATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Both Propositions 128 and 135, the competing environmental initiatives on the 
November ballot, are struggling to capture a majority among Orange County 
voters, but two measures that would limit state legislators' terms are leading 
by wide margins, a Times Orange County Poll shows. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 128 -- the so-called Big Green initiative that would impose strict 
regulations on pesticides, air and water, plus authorize $300 million in bonds 
to buy ancient redwood forests -- is leading in the county, 45% to 40%, with 
15% undecided, the poll shows. 
</P>
<P>
That lead disappears, however, among those in the county who are likely to 
vote; they opposed the measure, 44% to 41%. 
</P>
<P>
The county results jibe with those of a recent Times statewide poll that showed 
voters divided over Proposition 128, with 44% against, 42% in favor and 14% 
undecided. The margin of error in that poll was plus or minus 3%. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 135, a less-sweeping environmental measure endorsed by the 
agriculture industry, fares only marginally better in Orange County, with 46% 
favoring it, 34% opposing and 20% undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats and Republicans are roughly equal in their support of Proposition 
135, but opinion on Big Green -- which has been endorsed by Democratic 
gubernatorial hopeful Dianne Feinstein and opposed by Sen. Pete Wilson, the 
Republican candidate -- splits along party lines. Just 38% of Republicans said 
they will vote for the measure, against 53% of Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
While an earlier poll had shown much stronger support for Big Green, it has 
been the subject of intense campaigning recently by foes. 
</P>
<P>
Pollster Mark Baldassare said the latest results spell trouble for both 
environmental measures. 
</P>
<P>
"What's important is that they don't have a majority at this point," he said. 
"You look for initiatives to be going in with majority support. . . . They're 
very vulnerable to any kind of negative campaigns. If people have the slightest 
feeling that something is wrong, they'll vote no." 
</P>
<P>
The Times Orange County Poll was conducted Monday to Wednesday of last week by 
Mark Baldassare and Associates. Six hundred registered voters were interviewed 
by telephone, with a margin for error of plus or minus 4%. 
</P>
<P>
While county voters are apparently reluctant to enact sweeping environmental 
changes, they seem more than ready to rid Sacramento of multiterm incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
Both Proposition 131 and Proposition 140, which would limit statewide and 
legislative officeholders' terms, were favored by more than two-thirds of those 
polled, with Republicans slightly more likely to support the measures. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County support for the measures is running ahead of support statewide, 
based on results of a Times statewide poll completed last week. About half of 
all voters support the measures, with roughly a third opposed and 15% to 19% 
undecided, that poll found. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 131, which is supported by Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and 
includes provisions for public campaign funding, is leading in the county, 67% 
to 22%, with 11% undecided. The more-restrictive Proposition 140, which is 
supported by Wilson and does not include public campaign funding, held a 
similar edge of 69% to 19%, with 12% undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of these measures have "really captured the public imagination," 
Baldassare said. "I don't think people are differentiating between 131 and 140 
at this point. They're just looking for any means to have new people in 
office." 
</P>
<P>
Desmond Pencock, 61, a Republican from Santa Ana who responded to the poll, 
said he does not yet know enough about the two measures to distinguish between 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know which one is going to win, but I'm for anything that would limit 
our people in office," said Pencock, a librarian at Santa Ana High School. 
"They just keep hanging on. . . . Cranston has been in office ever since I can 
remember." 
</P>
<P>
Another statewide initiative, Proposition 133, which would increase the sales 
tax one-half cent to pay for drug enforcement and prevention programs, is 
clinging to a bare majority in Orange County, with 52% favoring the measure, 
35% opposing it and 13% undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Women are more likely to support the measure than men; 60% of women said they 
would vote for it, while the measure trailed, 44% to 46%, among men. 
</P>
<P>
How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
The Times Orange County poll was conducted Oct. 22 through 24 by Mark 
Baldassare &amp; Associates. The telephone survey of 600 Orange County 
registered voters was conducted on weekday nights using a computer-generated 
random sample of telephone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
For a sample of this size, the margin of error is plus or minus 4%. For the 
subgroup of likely voters, the margin is plus or minus 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Sampling error is just one type of error that can affect opinion polls. Results 
also can be affected by question wording, survey timing and other variables. 
</P>
<P>
All responses were anonymous, but some agreed to be re-interviewed later for a 
news story. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposition 128 
</P>
<P>
"The so-called Big Green initiative would regulate pesticides, air and water, 
authorize $300 million in bonds to acquire ancient redwoods and establish the 
elected position of environmental advocate. If the election were held today,

OWNER CRAMPED IN MANSION SAN MARINO CALLS PLENTY BIG

<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe cost is no object, but that doesn't mean it's easy to "mansionize" a 
mansion. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Kamal and Turkya Batniji, who for more than two years have battled 
city officials over their request to expand their 10-room Orlando Road 
residence, which already has 7,366 square feet of living space. 
</P>
<P>
"My family and I have the right to live in comfort," said Batniji, a 
50-year-old physician who wants to add two bedrooms, two bathrooms, an anteroom 
and an interior stairway totaling 403 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
But San Marino, California's 11th-wealthiest city, thinks the white stucco 
Mediterranean residence is quite comfortable enough as it is. 
</P>
<P>
The city Planning Commission has repeatedly turned down the couple's request 
for a conditional-use permit needed to expand the house. In July, the City 
Council upheld the commission's ruling and sent the matter back to the 
commission, which in September denied the permit again. Now the Batnijis have 
appealed once more. 
</P>
<P>
Built by architect Wallace Neff in 1928, the Batnijis' house already exceeds 
the maximum of 6,593 square feet of living space permitted for a house built 
today in San Marino. In addition, at least one neighbor is against the proposed 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
George Boone, who lives behind the Batnijis, on Aug. 15 wrote a letter to the 
city protesting the proposed addition. He said it would mar the view from his 
back-yard sculpture garden and devalue his property. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be good neighbors, but the integrity of the area should be 
maintained," Boone said, praising the Planning Commission for soliciting 
neighborhood comment. 
</P>
<P>
"We get about four or five (home expansion requests) a year," said Herb 
Worcester, the Planning Commission chairman. About 30% of the requests are 
followed by letters from neighbors for or against, he said, adding: "In 
Batniji's case, there were no letters for." 
</P>
<P>
When Batniji first applied in 1988, city law allowed 8,193 square feet of 
living space. But the addition was turned down because it would have "been an 
overpowering structure, almost to the property line," Worcester said. 
</P>
<P>
Then Batniji, with the help of city-recommended architect Robert Wood, scaled 
down the size of the addition and redrew the plans. 
</P>
<P>
But by then, the city ordinance had been changed to allow only 6,593 square 
feet of living space. 
</P>
<P>
Batniji's reworked application had so many changes in it that city officials 
considered it a new request under the new law. However, City Atty. Steven 
Dorsey noted that Batniji's earlier application could be considered in the 
doctor's favor. 
</P>
<P>
Like its gated neighbors on Orlando Road opposite the Huntington Library, Art 
Collections and Botanical Gardens, the Batnijis' house occupies about three 
quarters of an acre of land. 
</P>
<P>
Set back from the street by a tiered Roman fountain in the center of a circular 
drive, it has wide Gothic arches, intricate wrought-iron trim and a Romeo and 
Juliet-style balcony suspended on all sides but one. In the rear, there's a 
paddle tennis court and a waterfall added by the Batnijis behind the blue-tiled 
swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
Architect Neff, who designed homes for Hollywood stars such as Mary Pickford, 
Groucho Marx and Cary Grant, built the four-bedroom house for himself and his 
family. The Batnijis bought it in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
They say they need the extra space to accommodate their five children. The 
house has four upstairs sleeping rooms, but the Batnijis maintain that only 
three are proper bedrooms, complete with adjoining bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
They also want a guest room: "I can't put anyone to sleep in the library," 
Batniji said. 
</P>
<P>
Homes in San Marino -- a city of 3.75 square miles with about 14,000 
inhabitants -- range from about 1,300 square feet to more than 12,000, 
according to local real estate agents, who say the Batnijis' house is 
considered one of the city's larger residences. 
</P>
<P>
In some other cities, the term mansionization has been used to describe 
towering add-ons that allow once-modest homes to dwarf surrounding bungalows. 
</P>
<P>
In San Marino, there are those who say the term does not quite fit the Batniji 
case. Worcester, for instance, balks at calling it a case of mansionization 
because "the house is already a mansion." 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Paul Crowley disagrees. "Mansionization means that the home is 
built larger and more massive than before and then looks out of conformity with 
the neighborhood," Crowley said. "The Planning Commission intends to protect 
the rights of the neighbors, and it doesn't want to set a precedent (by 
allowing such expansion)." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as Batniji prepares for yet another appeal, he says the city was 
against him from the start. 
</P>
<P>
"If from Day One they told me, 'You cannot have this, you cannot have that,' 
probably I would have decided, 'Well, either I will cancel the project or find 
some other, bigger place to live in,' " he said.

MOTEL ORDINANCE CHANGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Changes in the city code regulating motel registrations were approved by the 
City Council on Tuesday in an effort to curb prostitution and drug activity. 
</P>
<P>
The amendments to the 6-year-old law mandate bookkeeping procedures to make it 
easier for city officials to spot registration inconsistencies that suggest 
possible illegal activity. Motel operators now are required to submit 
information on posted room rates and to segregate money collected for the city 
under its transient occupancy tax. 
</P>
<P>
A section of the retooled ordinance calls for an evaluation of the 
effectiveness of the changes in eight months. Another portion allows the city 
to modify or revoke the permit of any motel operator not in compliance.

PLANNING APPEAL DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An appeal of a Planning Commission decision rejecting an eight-home subdivision 
on Edwards Avenue was again delayed by the City Council last week. 
</P>
<P>
The council allowed owner Fun S. Tsang until its Nov. 27 meeting to prepare his 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Tsang is proposing to build the eight homes on two parcels in the 2700 block of 
Edwards Avenue just south of Garvey Avenue. One house currently occupies the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Tsang said the additional time is needed to allow the owner to 
come to agreement with neighbors who objected to the development. 
</P>
<P>
The commission denied approval of the plan in May, terming the site unsuitable 
for an eight-house development because of insufficient street access and the 
project's density. Edwards is a private street that would have to be widened if 
the project is approved.

SON'S WORK SCUTTLES PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 16-year-old's home business has scuttled his mother's bid to enlarge her 
house -- at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission on Wednesday refused to hear Gayle Young's request for 
an expansion permit because Young's son, Joseph, 16, runs a mail-order business 
from the home without a license. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager John Nowak said the city will try to resolve the matter 
informally. Meanwhile, Young's request for expansion will be heard next month. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Young, who calls his business "Prime Opportunities," sends out 
literature on ways to earn money. His mother said she didn't know a license was 
required for his endeavor.

PUBLIC TO VOTE ON FIREWORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents will be able to decide for themselves next year whether they want to 
allow the continued sale of so-called safe and sane fireworks in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council Wednesday voted 4 to 1, with Councilman Drexel Smith 
dissenting, to let the public vote on the matter during the November, 1991, 
municipal election. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-fireworks activists had favored a special election. But by scheduling the 
vote during a municipal election, Mayor Bert Ashley said the city could avoid 
the $16,000 cost of a special election.

COUNCIL REJECTS SITE PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the prime undeveloped commercial sites in Walnut will remain vacant 
until the owners of the property, Shea Business Properties and Wesmac Inc., 
come up with a development plan more acceptable to the city. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council enacted a 45-day moratorium Wednesday on any development of 
the approximately 37-acre site, which is near the intersection of Grand Avenue 
and Valley Boulevard. Walnut-based Shea owns 31.2 acres of the site, and Wesmac 
of Diamond Bar owns the remaining 5.9 acres. 
</P>
<P>
The council backed a staff report that concluded that the developers' 
proposals, including carwashes and auto repair shops, don't fit into the 
upscale commercial center envisioned by the city for the site.

PLANNERS' MISTAKES CITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two apparent zoning code violations approved in error by city planners are 
being considered by the City Council and the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The council must decide whether the city will pay to lop three feet off a 
townhouse deck on Calle Adriana that extends too far. 
</P>
<P>
In August, the development plan review board recommended that the deck be 
trimmed at the city's expense to comply with the zoning code. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Planning Commission will consider whether to grant a variance for 
room additions to a house on Calle Cristina. The additions were constructed too 
close to a neighbor's property. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say planners failed to go through the proper procedures before 
issuing the deck permit and misinterpreted the law when approving the room 
addition. They would not name the planners involved in either case.

PARTY-GOER'S SIDE OF THE STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have just returned from the court where the charges against me were never 
filed by the district attorney. Why? Because there were no complaining parties. 
The police tried to file the charges on four separate occasions, including 
trying to file downtown after failing to file in Pasadena!! Why? Because they 
had to cover themselves. 
</P>
<P>
They knew that they had no cause for arrest, the DA proved that. Then you must 
ask, why were we arrested? The citizen that called the police did not want 
anyone arrested, even after the police called here at 2 a.m. when they realized 
that they had no cause to enter the property! The police say that we were 
disturbing the peace. A direct quote from the district attorney's letter says, 
"An officer from the South Pasadena Police Department initially went to the 
neighborhood but left when he could not find a disturbance." He could not find 
a disturbance! 
</P>
<P>
Your professionals, the police, gave the police report and citizen complaints 
to the Los Angeles Times (Oct. 4), in violation of confidentiality. If the 
report was accurate I wouldn't care. For example, the report says that we were 
intoxicated! How would they know? They did not take field tests nor did they 
take any tests in the station! Why were we not arrested for intoxication? Is it 
simply that they saw beer and therefore we were intoxicated! What is going on? 
They knew we were all adults. 
</P>
<P>
Why did the police feel it was necessary to enter private property? This was a 
gathering of young adults, all over 21, no minors, to wish a friend well who 
was going off to college. What was our crime? Everyone at the gathering was 
South Pasadena born and raised. The police knew all of us. Why was it necessary 
to force the color of authority on us? Is it because we were not wearing 
tuxedos or suits or because of our age? 
</P>
<P>
How would you react if the police responded to your house where you are having 
a gathering for your birthday or promotion or graduation or just drinking beer 
in your back yard watching television and ordered you to send everyone home 
including those who were spending the night at your house? Maybe that's OK and 
the police will not do anything because you are over 40 or 50 or just over 25. 
Double standard? When does a party become a party? We are all adults, not the 
typical teen-age party. When I was told to go home, I did. The police report 
shows that I was arrested on the next block! Why? I was going home like I was 
told to! 
</P>
<P>
Quoting from the district attorney's office letter, "In addition, subsequent 
investigation has shown the noise generated by this party was not of a general 
disturbance to the immediate neighborhood." Not of a general disturbance! Again 
from the letter, "Therefore, insufficient evidence exists to prosecute the 
suspects. . . . " Insufficient evidence! In case you were wondering, let me 
further quote from the letter, "At no time did the suspects challenge the 
officers to fight." No challenge to fight! 
</P>
<P>
There is so much more that I could get into, like excessive force and why do 
the police who are sworn to protect us, turn over to the press information that 
they know is confidential? Are they fighting because they are afraid they will 
be exposed to a civil rights lawsuit? Now add libel and slander to that list. 
Perhaps they are just trying to strike fear into the hearts of anyone trying to 
file a complaint against them. When a report was being filed, the person was 
threatened with arrest! Others wanted to file complaints but they were afraid 
to! Think about that! 
</P>
<P>
Suffice to say, please don't judge us until you have all of the facts. I am an 
adult responsible for my own actions. If I were not the son of the city 
manager, would the police still be this interested in me? 
</P>
<P>
I felt that someone had to witness the outrageous physical and mental abuse 
given to us by the police. Someone had to witness it, but the police would not 
allow us a phone call! 
</P>
<P>
I had no intentions of taking the issue any further. After the fiasco circus 
that the police association and their attorney put on at the City Council 
meeting Wednesday night, I have to wonder. The president of the police 
association was present at the scene. Why is he so afraid of an investigation? 
</P>
<P>
I, as a resident of this community, am the target of attack by our own police. 
Why, because I filed a complaint against them? I did absolutely nothing wrong. 
No charges! If I did not believe in what I was doing, I would not have filed. 
Now I must pay the price. Am I afraid? Yes!

ELECTIONS: ALHAMBRA;

<P>
SCHOOL BOARD HOPEFULS STRESS THEIR EXPERIENCE 
</P>

Candidates for the Alhambra City and High School Districts board are stressing 
educational experience and business expertise as they campaign for two open 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
Five candidates, including 12-year incumbent Dora Padilla, are running in the 
Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla, 56, a homemaker and school board member since 1978, is running for her 
fourth term. "The condition of California schools, especially Alhambra, calls 
for knowledgeable, experienced leadership," Padilla says. She wants to see 
through several projects that began during her tenure, including the 
installation of a districtwide computer system and renovation of the district's 
three high schools. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Hirosawa, 46, an assistant principal at Hollenbeck Junior High in Boyle 
Heights, says he wants to bring basic values to education. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe everybody has to study and work hard in order to learn," Hirosawa 
says. If elected, the L.A. Unified administrator also wants to work with the 
state to introduce a more equitable way of funding local school districts. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Ling, 52, a director of admissions at Poly Languages Institute in 
Pasadena and its international student adviser, says that, if elected, he would 
bring 15 years of business experience to the school board. 
</P>
<P>
"My experience in financial management may be useful to the Alhambra district, 
which is experiencing budget cuts," says Ling, who earned an MBA from 
Pepperdine University. 
</P>
<P>
Sophie C. Wong, 53, is a businesswoman who co-owns a real estate company and an 
Alhambra thrift and loan. She is on the board of directors for the United Way 
West San Gabriel Valley region, the San Gabriel Valley Red Cross and the 
Alhambra YMCA. She is also on the Salvation Army Advisory Board and is a past 
president of the Monterey Park Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
She also co-founded a women's scholarship fund for Cal State L.A. and has 
served on advisory boards for the university and for East L.A. Community 
College. 
</P>
<P>
If elected, "my primary goal will be to link our community and business 
resources together to support our schools," Wong says. "Only by forming a 
community-business-school team can we ensure a bright future for . . . our 
children." 
</P>
<P>
The fifth candidate is Jeffrey Schwartz, 36, an independent contractor and 
business manager. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz, who attended Alhambra schools, said he was prompted to run for office 
when he concluded that his son wasn't receiving the same quality of education 
he had as a child. 
</P>
<P>
If elected, Schwartz wants to make the board more accessible to teachers and 
parents. He would form a volunteer committee to write grant proposals and would 
attempt to resurrect "Opportunity Room," an Alhambra district program that 
gives problem students a second chance at educational success. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz says he would also draw on his business experience to encourage more 
local firms to participate in Alhambra's "Adopt-A-School" program and would 
attempt to regain federal funding for an education program aimed at refugees. 
</P>
<P>
The Alhambra districts serve about 20,000 students in kindergarten through high 
school and covers all of Alhambra and portions of Monterey Park, Rosemead and 
San Gabriel. Candidates are elected at large to four-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
Charles C. Scanlon, the other member whose term is expiring, is not running for 
reelection. He has served 16 years on the board.

SAFEST CITIES ASKING VOTERS TO OK TAX TO KEEP THEM SECURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two of the San Gabriel Valley's safest cities are asking voters for money to 
maintain that distinction. 
</P>
<P>
In San Marino, it's called Proposition P, and in La Verne it's known as 
Proposition H. The bottom line is to raise tax dollars for police, fire and 
paramedic services. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes are the highest in San Marino, where such a measure has been on the 
books since 1982. If the public safety tax is not renewed for another four 
years, the city will lose about 33% of its police budget, 44% of its Fire 
Department budget and 75% of its paramedic service budget. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very optimistic and hopeful that the residents will back it again," said 
Lee Marangi, a member of the Citizens for Public Safety Committee, which 
supports Proposition P. "I think the community in general feels that protective 
services are very important." 
</P>
<P>
The city, although traditionally ranked among the most crime-free in Los 
Angeles County, recorded its first murder in more than 10 years when a 
Taiwanese businessman was shot to death in his driveway June 11. No arrests 
have been reported. 
</P>
<P>
But anti-tax crusader Ben Austin, who contends the measure only pays for 
bureaucratic waste, compared the tax to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's 
aggression in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not much we ordinary citizens can do to curb the insatiable appetite 
of a bloody dictator in the Middle East, but we sure to God know how to deal 
with the terrorist tactics of our local small-time politicians," he charged in 
a newsletter mailed last month to every residence in town. "We can simply vote, 
'NO' " 
</P>
<P>
Austin is founder of the San Marino Fiscally Conservative Assn., a 10-year-old 
group with more than 300 supporters. 
</P>
<P>
If passed by the required two-thirds margin, the measure would raise up to $1.5 
million a year in fees added to property tax bills. Payments would range from 
$266 to $722, depending on the size and location of the lot and home, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In La Verne -- which last year had one murder, six rapes, 33 robberies and 62 
assaults -- Proposition H seeks voter approval to raise up to $1.2 million a 
year through fees of $96 per home. 
</P>
<P>
Although the measure is only advisory, the City Council has vowed not to enact 
the tax should a majority of voters oppose it. Officials are hopeful, however, 
that recent events, such as last month's hostage drama at the McDonald's on 
Foothill Boulevard, have made residents aware of the need for a high level of 
emergency services. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing is geared to trying to preserve La Verne's quality of life," 
Assistant City Manager Jeff Allred said.

<P>
Invasion of the Body Snatchers (Channel 5 Sunday at 3 p.m.) The original 1956 
sci-fi classic, directed by Don Siegel, is about a small community whose 
inhabitants are being taken over by alien "pods." Serves as an effective 
parable on the hysteria of McCarthyism and stars Kevin McCarthy and Dana 
Wynter. 
</P>
<P>
The Wages of Fear (TNT Sunday at 11 p.m.) The 1952 H. G. Clouzot suspense 
classic focuses on four truck drivers transporting nitroglycerin across a South 
American backwash. Yves Montand and Charles Vanel star. Remade grandiosely by 
William Friedkin in 1977 as "Sorcerer." 
</P>
<P>
The Big Clock (Channel 5 Monday at 4 a.m.) Reworked -- or rather overworked as 
the 1987 "No Way Out," this taut, witty 1948 thriller involves an innocent man 
(Ray Milland) trying to avoid becoming a prime suspect in a murder while 
pursuing the actual killer. Directed by John Farrow and co-starring Maureen 
O'Sullivan, Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester. 
</P>
<P>
McCabe and Mrs. Miller (Channel 13 Saturday at 2 a.m.) One of Robert Altman's 
very best, an ironic, many-layered 1971 frontier saga in which a cocky but 
fundamentally naive opportunist (Warren Beatty) sets about opening a bordello, 
with Julie Christie as its madam.

MOVIES OF THE WEEK

<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Secret Life of Archie's Wife (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie, stars 
Jill Eikenberry as an unhappily married woman who falls in love with the inept 
bank robber (Michael Tucker) who has kidnaped her. 
</P>
<P>
Lethal Weapon (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a big, shallow, flashy buddy-buddy cop 
thriller salvaged by the unpredictability of its star Mel Gibson and Danny 
Glover as Gibson's apoplectic partner. 
</P>
<P>
Stakeout (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is another high concept item -- detective falls 
in love with a woman he has under surveillance -- but it too is brightened by 
its stars, especially by Richard Dreyfuss as the detective and Madeleine Stowe 
as the woman. 
</P>
<P>
To Kill a Mockingbird (Channel 5 Monday at 8 p.m.) is the 1962 milestone film 
in which Gregory Peck, in an Oscar-winning performance, stars as a small-town 
Southern lawyer who defends a black man accused of rape. 
</P>
<P>
Jasmine Guy and Anna Maria Horsford star in A Killer Among Us (NBC Monday at 9 
p.m.), about a young mother who starts her own manhunt after serving as a juror 
on a murder trial and hearing the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Beetlejuice (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.), an uproarious 1988 comedy, is a dazzling 
display of director Tim Burton's unique pop culture sensibility. It's an 
irresistible treat in which attractive, homespun ghosts Alec Baldwin and Geena 
Davis wreak havoc on the relentlessly upscale new owners of their New England 
home. With Michael Keaton as the decidedly weird "bio-exorcist" of the film's 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Biloxi Blues (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m., again Saturday at 6 p.m.) is Neil 
Simon's recollection of his life as a 1945 Army recruit in the Deep South, 
nostalgia with pinpricks of pain and a mood of hard-edged reverie that the 
actors, especially Matthew Broderick as Simon's alter ego, seize upon. 
</P>
<P>
The 1984 Missing in Action (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.) has been shrewdly 
tailored to Chuck Norris' stoic persona and physical skills, and it's one of 
his best, an action-adventure that finds him on a secret mission to Vietnam to 
rescue American soldiers still held captive there. 
</P>
<P>
The slight possibility that three convicts who vanished from Alcatraz in 1962 
didn't drown in San Francisco Bay provides the basis for the taut and dynamic 
1979 Escape From Alcatraz (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.). Clint Eastwood stars 
as the escapees' ringleader and once again is the archetypal strong man of few 
words. 
</P>
<P>
Braddock: Missing in Action III (Channel 5 Friday at 8 p.m.) finds Chuck 
Norris' Braddock discovering his wife did not die in the fall of Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
The 1982 Creepshow (Channel 13 Friday at 8 p.m.) is a homage to the gory old 
days of horror comics and has the look down pat. It's written by Stephen King 
and directed by George Romero, but only one of the film's five episodes, 
starring E. G. Marshall as a rich old misanthrope, really works. 
</P>
<P>
William Friedkin's underrated To Live and Die in L.A. (Channel 5 Saturday at 8 
p.m.) is a grim, bleak, harrowing true-life police drama close to the spirit 
and impact of his "French Connection." With William L. Petersen and Willem 
Dafoe. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to L.A. (Channel 28 Saturday at 11 p.m.), Alan Rudolph's multicharacter 
1977 debut film, captures mesmerically the quality and style of life in the 
City of Angels. Keith Carradine, Sally Kellerman, Geraldine Chaplin and Harvey 
Keitel head the large cast.

For the TV viewers who prefer to see the classic movies in black-and-white, the 
solution is very simple. Just turn the color knob on your TV set to the extreme 
off position. Presto, instant black and white! I tried it the other night on a 
colorized classic and it worked great.

A PERSONAL CHECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because I do rely upon your movie-rating system, I was confused and 
disappointed by your having given a single check ("Desperation Time") to the 
worthy film "The Seventh Sign" (Oct. 3, Channel 5). Aside from a miscast Jesus 
(Christ) and a penchant for some obviousness, I found the movie to meaningfully 
bring together biblical prophecy with current events, and to portray what a 
personal act of faith would be, in a rather inspiring way.

TURN IN, TUNE ON, SPEAK OUT; 
</P>
<P>
HERE ARE THE RESPONSES TO THE OCT. 7 QUESTION: WHAT ARE THE BEST OF THE NEW 
SHOWS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"American Dreamer" with Robert Urich was a thought-provoking gentle 
storywithout the violence and sex that seems to fill the screen today. 
</P>
<P>
Ida K. Miller, Tujunga 
</P>
<P>
New shows? Several really good ones! "Evening Shade," great cast, 
veryentertaining; both "Uncle Buck" and "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" provided 
somelaughs; Sharon Gless does a fantastic job in "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill." 
</P>
<P>
So, weUre pleased with most of the new shows. But what do we know? We 
loved"Slap Maxwell" and that show vanished. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne and Doris Sisk, Cypress 
</P>
<P>
Please convey the following to NBC: "American Dreamer" is refreshing, funny 
andreal. We hope it survives. 
</P>
<P>
Doug and Mary Scott, Laguna Niguel 
</P>
<P>
Please add two votes for best new show to our favorite, "Evening Shade." 
Thesupporting cast is hilarious, especially Charles Durning and Elizabeth 
Ashley.It's also unusual to find a show where the children are "just" the 
children, anddo not dominate the stories. 
</P>
<P>
Burt Reynolds is restrained and charming. But why isn't this show on the 
CBSMonday night lineup, where it would fit perfectly? 
</P>
<P>
Mr. and Mrs. Kenny Altman, Sherman Oaks 
</P>
<P>
We like "Hull High" and think the network should keep it on the air. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara and Cort Casady, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
I haven't been in school since the '60s, but that doesn't stop me from 
enjoying"Hull High." 
</P>
<P>
The "musical" is a true American invention. Bravo to "Hull High" for bringing 
itinto the '90s with style and good humor. As far as I'm concerned, MGM has 
metMTV ... and I couldn't be more pleasantly surprised. 
</P>
<P>
Ginger Smith, North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
I feel "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill" is off to a strong start, showing a lot 
ofpotential. Sharon Gless is marvelous. Great delivery and timing. She got 
theaudience immediately interested in her character. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Reedon, Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
"The Trials of Rosie O'Neill" is the best new show I've seen this season. 
Thewriting and directing have been solid. Sharon Gless is very likable and 
makesRosie a compelling character. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Cole, Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
Although the ratings don't indicate it at the present, I think "The 
FanelliBoys" is one of the best new programs on TV. It presents a combination 
of goodwriting, a fine mix of characters, an ethnic flavor which is not 
offensive.

There are two new shows that I really hope will be around for a long time. 
Theyare "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill" and "American Dreamer." They are both 
adult,thought provoking and thoroughly enjoyable.

FanelliBoys," a really funny show with good writing and good actors, it's one 
of my topfour favorite shows along with "Lenny" and "Dear John."

Thanks to NBC for the two best hours of network television: "Matlock" and 
"Quantum Leap." I set aside time to watch these two shows and also take note of 
the sponsors.

Q&amp;A: LARRY KING: HOW MANY JOBS CAN THIS MAN HOLD? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Daniel Cerone, Daniel Cerone spoke with King about his new variety special 
on NBC.

This is the year of Larry King. A stable broadcast institution for 30 years, 
Kingis branching out. Already a radio show host, TV talk show host, national 
newspaper columnist, best-selling author and occasional sports commentator, 
King is about to do...a variety show. 
</P>
<P>
"Sunday Night With Larry King" on NBC marks yet another evolution in the lifeof 
the man listed in the "Guinness Book of World Records" for interviewing 
morethan 30,000 people and logging an unprecedented number of hours on 
nationalradio. 
</P>
<P>
King grew up in Brooklyn as a welfare recipient following the deaths of 
hisolder brother and father. At 26, he found instant success and controversy 
inMiami with a radio interview show. Guests ranged from Lenny Bruce to 
RichardNixon. 
</P>
<P>
King, 56, hosts "The Larry King Show" nightly over the Mutual 
BroadcastingSystem and "Larry King Live," CNN's No. 1 program. He also writes a 
weeklycolumn, "Larry King's People," in USA Today and has a new book in the 
stores,"Larry King: Tell Me More." 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Cerone spoke with King about his new variety special on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
How did you get involved with NBC? 
</P>
<P>
I was in Los Angeles doing my radio show. (Former NBC president) 
BrandonTartikoff was a guest on the show and before it (started) he said, "Do 
you thinka variety show could work on television today?" I said, "They sure 
haven't."He said, "What if it were a mix, a variety show that was 
informational, with youhosting it?" I said, "Why me?" He said, "You fit the 
mold. You're not anentertainer, you're a presenter." 
</P>
<P>
What is "Sunday Night With Larry King?" 
</P>
<P>
We're going to try and do a sort of 1990 version of an old-fashioned 
varietyshow. Stallone will come on and show scenes from "Rocky V," and then we 
willshow a history of boxing on television. David Letterman will do a rare 
guestspot and some stand-up comedy. Bart Simpson will do an interview with me, 
ananimated interview. And Siegfried and Roy, the illusionists, are going 
toperform. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Turner holds your exclusive TV contract. Why did he agree to let you do 
ashow for NBC? 
</P>
<P>
It's not a conflict of interest because I'm not doing interviews. And in a 
senseit doesn't really hurt him. It's going to promote the fact that I'm on 
CNN. Tedhas a genuine friendship with me. He said, "If you want to give this a 
shot, Idon't want to stand in your way." 
</P>
<P>
I nearly left Ted two years ago because I had a great offer from NBC. I 
decidedto stay, and I signed a five-year contract in May. It was the best move 
I evermade. Loyalty counts a lot with Ted. If this show got a 50 share and NBC 
offeredme $80 million, I would not leave Ted Turner. 
</P>
<P>
Is doing a variety show a departure for you? 
</P>
<P>
I'm not going to dance or sing with the guests. I'm the host. I can be funny. 
Ithink I'm witty. I've done things like this. I've hosted lots of breakfasts 
anddinners. It's an extension of what I do. It's Sullivanish, I guess, if you 
haveto compare. The show is on Sunday night. That's the night (Ed) Sullivan was 
on. 
</P>
<P>
Not long after judging the Miss America Pageant, you were criticized for 
callingMiss Pennsylvania ugly on the Joan Rivers Show. What happened? 
</P>
<P>
When I was on, Joan was kidding around, I was kidding around and the 
audiencewas kidding around. She asked me who the ugliest contestant was. I 
didn't sayanything. But she asked me again. I thought it was a bit. So I said, 
"MissPennsylvania." To this day it mystifies me why this became a story. In 
fact, Ivoted her third in the pageant, and on a talent scale of 10, I gave her 
a nine. 
</P>
<P>
People who know me took it humorously. For one, I would never hurt anyone 
whocan't defend herself if I knew beforehand that she would be hurt. So 
Iimmediately apologized and sent her flowers. It hurt me that she was hurt. 
Ithurt me. I have a 22-year-old daughter, and I wouldn't want anybody to 
seriouslysay that about my daughter. 
</P>
<P>
We're in a different age today. Probably in my career I have said a great 
manythings to offend people. Tabloids today pick everything up, and that 
attitudehas worked its way into the larger media as well. 
</P>
<P>
Do you care what people think about you? 
</P>
<P>
I care if I'm misunderstood. I never go on the air thinking, "Will they 
likethis?" In other words, my mind isn't saying, "Are you enjoying this?" My 
mindis saying, "Am I enjoying this?" Johnny Carson said to me once, "If I 
don'tlike the joke, you won't like the joke." If I'm enjoying the show, then 
there'sa chance that you are going to enjoy the show. 
</P>
<P>
You're so busy as it is. Why take on this NBC special? 
</P>
<P>
I don't want to be Mr. Media. I really don't. I don't want to control 
theairwaves. I have a comfortable niche on CNN and on the radio, and both 
havetheir special audiences. I mean, I'm not Johnny Carson. I have a nice 
place. Iget to do what I want to do. This is a new challenge, and that's 
appealing. Ihosted the Goodwill Games (on TBS) this year because I'm a sports 
nut, and Ithought it would be a hoot. If it were a yearly event, I would have 
turned itdown. 
</P>
<P>
Do you have other enterprises planned? 
</P>
<P>
Right after the NBC special I'm going to take stock. I'll probably slow down 
myspeaking engagements. I'm doing very well financially now. I have all 
thesethings; I want to appreciate them. If you work every day, what's the 
differenceif you make $1 million or $1,000? I want to take stock and take 
advantage of thethings that I earn. I enjoy my work. I have contractual 
obligations. But I don'twant another year where I do the Goodwill Games and 
speaking engagements and TVspecials. It's too much.
