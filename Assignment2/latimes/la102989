THE OTHER CHILDREN OF THE HOLOCAUST; 
</P>
<P>
LEGACY OF SILENCE: ENCOUNTERS WITH THE CHILDREN OF THE THIRD REICH BY DAN 
BAR-ON (HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESS: $25; 338 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Ask them if they still want to kill in their dreams as I still want to die in 
mine," an Israeli student, whose mother survived the Nazis, asked Dan Bar-On as 
he set off on his first trip to Germany. But after he had finished his two-year 
mission of interviewing a different strain of the Holocaust's children -- the 
children of its perpetrators -- he found that in their dreams, they too wanted 
to die. 
</P>
<P>
Dreams are memory, blocked. Many of the sons and daughters of SS generals, 
concentration-camp doctors and high Nazi officials grew up largely ignorant of 
what their fathers had done. When revelation came -- it came late and 
imperfectly -- they coped in a dislocated mixture of pain, anger, 
rationalization, denial and profound shame. 
</P>
<P>
Theirs has been a life not of guilt -- they were not killers -- but of guilt's 
silence. Knowing the worst is terrible but, as Bar-On finds in this powerful 
and compassionate book, not knowing it is even more terrible. With persistence 
and an odd tenderness, he explores the psychic wounds of silence and 
suppression. 
</P>
<P>
"Legacy of Silence" is a journey as much as a study. Bar-On traveled with 
personal trepidation and on a dangerous intellectual borderline. When the 
daughter of Himmler refused, by telephone, to give him an interview, he writes: 
"I am not sure which of us felt the most relief." His father, a prescient 
German Jewish doctor, fled the Beast in 1933 when Bar-On was a baby. 
Interviewing the Beast's children is scary. 
</P>
<P>
But the borderline is scarier. He writes in his preface that the Holocaust was 
an absolute evil. But psychological and cultural profiles of those who 
participated show no particular difference from those of the "rescuers" -- 
those Germans who made their repugnance clear, and helped their Jewish 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Looking at things in black-and-white terms is correct so far as judgment goes, 
he argues, but it is dangerous as well: It ignores the possibility that many of 
us, given the circumstances, the society and the pressures, could succumb as 
well. Gray is a vital area for therapeutic study; and what could be more truly 
gray than those who, innocent themselves, knew evil as their father? 
</P>
<P>
Bar-On located 58 children of what he calls the perpetrators -- figures who 
played active and responsible parts in the Nazi terror. Only nine of these 
refused to be interviewed; of the rest, he selected 13. Among these are the 
nephew of Heydrich, the butcher of Czechoslovakia, and children of a top deputy 
to Himmler, an SS general in charge of repression in the Baltic, several 
concentration- camp doctors, and the daughter of one of Hitler's closest 
associates. Like most of the perpetrators, this man is not identified by name, 
but it becomes clear that it is Goering. 
</P>
<P>
Gerda, the daughter, is an academic, respected by her colleagues for her quiet 
integrity. Like many of those interviewed, she is at least as nervous as her 
interviewer. Gradually she warms to him; finally, she is calling him "my 
therapist." 
</P>
<P>
But about her father -- Goering -- she is frozen out of judgment. He was 
impulsive, affectionate, "a real human being" ("er war so ein Mensch"). In the 
early days -- she was born in 1922 -- she would drive with him at night from 
party meeting to party meeting. Never, she insists, were the Jews discussed at 
home. Pressed by Bar-On, she says that her father had no "direct 
responsibility" for the slaughter; pressed further for a judgment on the Third 
Reich, she says it is too painful for her. 
</P>
<P>
Bar-On is convinced that she wants to speak and cannot; that she suffers a true 
disability. She cannot be free of her father. The only way she manages a kind 
of criticism of the treatment of the Jews is by quoting her father as saying 
toward the end of the war that "we will never be forgiven for what we did to 
them." She also produces a ranting final testament written before his suicide 
at Nuremberg, in which he simultaneously insults the Jews and proposes that 
Germany, not Palestine, become their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Gerda is the spookiest of the lot. Monika, whose father was an SS general 
hanged by the Russians in Riga, has spent her life working toward unsparing 
judgment. As a child, she accepted her mother's rosy picture of him; as an 
adult, she tracked down his role as the executor of the 1938 Kristallnacht 
pogrom. He never had told her mother about this; in fact, when she expressed 
her horror, he agreed that it was awful. It was this dissembling, above all, 
that enraged Monika and left her free to judge him. 
</P>
<P>
Manfred, a professor, also has been freed by hearing the truth. His father was 
a doctor who took part in the death-camp selections and killed himself in 1947, 
when Manfred was 8 months old. His mother never dissembled to him; she was 
harsh in her condemnation both of the Nazis and of her husband. As with Monika, 
Manfred's story suggests that it is not the bad news about a father that 
cripples; it is not knowing it. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Bar-On's subjects turned to religion to break with the past. One, the 
son of an SS officer, became an Orthodox Rabbi and moved to Jerusalem. The 
other, whose father was an associate of Himmler and lived a privileged life 
among the party elite, became a Catholic priest. 
</P>
<P>
In their interviews, both are curiously unrevealing; they speak in religious 
generalities. As another interviewee told the Rabbi, whom he knew: "You've 
never really confronted the thing and dealt with it. You just drew a line, 
threw everything away, made a new start and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
The speaker is the subject of the most extraordinary of the portraits. He is 
Thomas Heydrich, nephew of the man who, as Hitler's viceroy in Czechoslovakia, 
was the arch-symbol of Nazi atrocity, and was assassinated for it. 
</P>
<P>
Heydrich, a big, bearded, vociferous man, has made an art and a vocation out of 
confronting his past. He is a cabaret performer, and one of his specialties is 
reciting the work of Jewish poets such as Heinrich Heine and Walter Mehring. He 
tells Bar-On that his ambition is to appear in Jerusalem. "A Heydrich in Israel 
reading Heine in German . . . they would kill him," Bar-On reflects. He is 
attracted to Heydrich's openness, and he is made uneasy by his theatrical 
flamboyance. 
</P>
<P>
So are we; could this be an inverted form of denial? But bit by bit, Heydrich 
-- part buffoon, part tragedian -- takes on a near-saintly aspect. His memories 
of childhood are grotesque and, in a way, heartbreaking. Lucidly and 
unsparingly, he tells of his life as a Nazi crown prince. His father was an SS 
official; his uncle was sheer Nazi royalty. He recalls visiting the uncle in 
Hradcany Castle in Prague. He was 8, and an actor even then; he put together a 
kind of royal costume and basked in the guards' salute as he descended the 
great staircase. 
</P>
<P>
His father -- who loved his murderous brother and was his antithesis -- 
committed suicide in 1944, fearing discovery. With the power of his SS 
position, he'd forged 100 passports to get Jews out of the country. And in 
1945, at 14, transformed from crown prince to grand penitent, young Heydrich 
began to study the Nazi record. In years in which few Germans were saying much 
about it, he denounced it loudly, and, eventually, theatrically. 
</P>
<P>
Theatricality is transcended. At the end of the piece, Bar-On goes to hear 
Heydrich recite a Mehring poem about two Jewish children and a Nazi butcher. 
Afterwards, he goes backstage and finds Thomas weeping. "This Heydrich will 
follow me to the last days of my life," he says. Bar-On weeps too and embraces 
him. 
</P>
<P>
While he was making his trips to Germany, Bar-On writes, his step-son, Yariv, 
was dying of lymphoma. "Why are you doing this?" the youth asked him on one of 
his last visits; and then answered his own question: 
</P>
<P>
"I know why, you are looking for hope, for them and for yourself . . . You once 
told me that for you, the quest for hope has to do with confronting the truth."

FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
Daughter's Identification -- In a review by Richard Eder of "Legacy of 
Silence," a book by Dan Bar-On about children of prominent Nazis, one of the 
children was identified as the daughter of Hermann Goering. The identification 
was not made by the Bar-On, who had promised confidentiality to his subject, 
but by the reviewer. This was done on the basis of similarities between Goering 
and the description of the man in question -- with corroboration from a person 
in a position to know. Prof. Bar-On has written denying that it was Goering; 
continuing to respect his pledge of confidentiality, he does not disclose the 
identification. The corroborator, checking further, confirms the denial, and 
apologizes. So does Eder.

impersonate her twin sister, an FBI agent. 
</P>
<P>
David Cronenberg's 1981 Scanners (Channel 5 Monday at 8 p.m.) is intelligent 
and artful yet truly horrifying in its effects. It concerns a small band of men 
and women whose ESP has developed to inhuman levels. 
</P>
<P>
Chiller (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.), a so-so 1985 Wes Craven TV movie, 
imagines what happens when a young man (Michael Beck) is thawed out after 10 
years frozen in cryogenic suspension. 
</P>
<P>
Settle the Score (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie, stars Jaclyn Smith in 
a suspense drama about a Chicago policewoman who, having been raped as a 
teen-ager, returns to her hometown 20 years later to discover that similar 
assaults are still being committed. 
</P>
<P>
Halloween III: Season of the Witch (Channel 5 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) provocatively 
links ancient magic and modern electronics, but this promising premise is 
overwhelmed by gore. Not a sequel, this 1982 release features Dan O'Herlihy as 
a mad toy maker with a plan to destroy the children of America on Halloween 
Eve. 
</P>
<P>
The 1982 Some Kind of Hero (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) gave Richard Pryor a 
long-deserved solid starring role as a returning Vietnam vet, one of the 
longest-held POWs, who must deal with the overwhelming repercussions of his 
signing a "confession" for the Viet Cong in return for care for his desperately 
ill buddy (Ray Sharkey). Although the film is highly uneven, Pryor makes it 
worth watching. 
</P>
<P>
The White Buffalo (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), an offbeat take on Wild Bill 
Hickok, is the first of three Charles Bronson movies screening on KTLA this 
week. The others are less impressive: Assassination (Thursday, again on 
Saturday at 8 p.m.) and Murphy's Law (Friday). 
</P>
<P>
John Carpenter's 1978 Halloween (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) has become a 
horror classic and a seasonal perennial, but it's nevertheless pretty morbid 
business. Jamie Lee Curtis stars as an endangered baby sitter. 
</P>
<P>
Burt Reynolds' Malone (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m., again on Saturday at 1 
p.m.) is the Mysterious Stranger, strong and silent, who happens upon some 
decent, ordinary folk in need of a larger-than-life Good Guy to defend them 
against a big-deal Bad Guy. It's a familiar genre piece, but done with respect 
and care. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Hart Benton (Channel 24 Wednesday at 8 p.m., Channels 28 and 15 at 9, 
Channel 50 at 10), a documentary on the late American artist, is the newest 
work from the talented Ken Burns, whose previous documentaries on American 
subjects include the incisive "Huey Long." 
</P>
<P>
Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge (Channel 11 Friday at 8 p.m.) was a 
not-as-scary sequel to the hair-raising original, which screens Thursday on 
Channel 11 at 8 p.m. The original film poses the question: When a film is 
designed to drench the screen in blood -- with maximum violence directed, as 
usual, mainly toward women -- rather than to give a good, fun fright, what 
finally does it matter how well it is made? Anyway, this is the film in which 
Robert Englund created Freddy, the hideous ghoul who attacks boys and girls in 
their sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Silent Rage (Channel 13 Saturday at 8 p.m.) is a nifty Michael Miller-directed 
1982 release in which Chuck Norris, cast as the sheriff of a small Texas town, 
is pitted against a contemporary Frankenstein's monster. 
</P>
<P>
Breaking Away (Channel 28 Saturday at 10 p.m.) merges the spirits of Booth 
Tarkington and "American Graffiti" in a 1979 sleeper directed by Peter Yates

THE PHYSICIST AGAINST THE HACKERS; 
</P>
<P>
THE EMPEROR'S NEW MIND: ON COMPUTERS, MINDS, AND THE LAWS OF PHYSICS BY ROGER 
PENROSE (OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS: $24.95; 428 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David G. Stork, Stork (Ph.D. physics) works on neural models of vision and 
cognition and is adjunct assistant professor of psychology and electrical 
engineering at Stanford University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Could a computer ever think? Be intelligent? Have a mind? Be creative? Be 
conscious? Or is there something special about humans that endows us with these 
wonderful properties but, being absent in current computers, dooms them to a 
dark and mindless existence? 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of "strong artificial intelligence" (AI) claim that intelligence and 
consciousness arise somehow from the way in which a device computes -- 
described by its set of rules, its algorithms. Thus consciousness can be evoked 
not only in biological brains but also in properly programmed computers, or, 
for that matter, in an astoundingly complex contraptions of gears and pulleys. 
The task, according to such proponents, is to ascertain the proper algorithms. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, claims Roger Penrose, the distinguished mathematical physicist from 
Oxford University; the brain is uniquely suited to harness non-algorithmic 
aspects of the world, and thus can be conscious. As its title suggests, "The 
Emperor's New Mind" is Penrose's attack on strong AI; it is based on recent 
research on quantum mechanics, quantum gravity, black holes, cosmology, 
fractals, quasicrystals and more, all as they relate to the question of 
algorithmic processing. 
</P>
<P>
His general argument builds on the ideas of philosopher Karl Popper. First, 
Kurt Goedel's celebrated theorem demonstrates that there are mathematical 
truths that are forever beyond proofs using merely the algorithms of 
mathematics itself -- which is all that a standard computer could employ. Next, 
conscious beings seem to be able at times to recognize truths directly, 
apparently without deriving them by any algorithms. Thus, in his effort to 
understand consciousness, Penrose seeks properties of the physical world 
involving non-algorithmic behavior, aspects which biological brains might 
exploit. But are there any properties of the physical world such that their 
behavior can not be captured in a computer program? 
</P>
<P>
For Penrose, astounding complexity of behavior and chaos such as the billowing 
dust from a volcano will not suffice, since this could in principle be 
simulated in a very large computer. Nor will quantum mechanics -- the branch of 
physics typically treating very small or very fast processes such as the decay 
of a radioactive atom -- suffice, despite its "magical" aspects such as the 
wave-particle duality, "collapse of the wave function," and so on. The problem 
here is that, as quantum mechanics is currently understood, random 
probabilities underlie all phenomena -- hardly what Penrose would like in a 
being that has will, consciousness, intelligence and ethics. 
</P>
<P>
Penrose's central hypothesis is that a current dilemma in physics -- how to 
reconcile quantum mechanics with Einstein's relativity -- may hold the clue. If 
a so-called "correct quantum theory of gravity" ever is devised, perhaps it 
will be non-algorithmic. 
</P>
<P>
What could be more intriguing -- a book that relates forefront physics research 
with the age-old philosophical question: "What is consciousness?" 
</P>
<P>
But, frankly, the book is disappointing -- and at times frustrating -- despite 
the clarity of the writing and the manifestly interesting topic. Time and time 
again Penrose defers objections or alternate interpretations, breezing along 
with his line of thought; when he finally has to meet these objections -- often 
quite late in the book -- many of his "explanations" collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Here is just one example. The crushing disappointment concerns his central 
hypothesis that the key to having a brain function non-algorithmically is to 
exploit phenomena of an as yet undiscovered "correct quantum gravity," for 
which standard quantum mechanics is but an approximation. He is forced to 
postulate special nerve cells in the brain -- as yet not recognized -- that 
operate on fundamentally quantum gravitational processes in a manner as yet not 
even postulated. After about 100 pages related to such wild speculations, he 
then admits that the brain is too "hot" for the scheme to work anyway; the 
random motion of its components would swamp any quantum gravity effect. He 
concludes this analysis somewhat despondently: "Perhaps we are doomed to be 
computers after all!" 
</P>
<P>
After Penrose paints himself into an unpleasant corner this way, he tries to 
paint a doorway out. It simply doesn't work. He turns in the last chapter away 
from his field of expertise -- physics -- and into territories where he is, 
frankly, an unreliable guide; for instance, psychology, cognitive science and 
the evolution of consciousness. Some of his analyses here are mere 
recapitulations of ideas presented elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, there are issues that have preoccupied other thinkers on these 
subjects -- most notably the importance of levels of description, and 
flexibility of response -- that get only cursory treatment by Penrose. 
</P>
<P>
Although the current status of computers and algorithms is not central to 
Penrose's argument -- he is talking about computers "in principle," after all 
-- what little he does describe is surprisingly out of date; for instance, 
computer "psychoanalyst" programs, now nearly two decades old. When he mentions 
the current status of chess-playing computers, he can tell us only the level 
(grand master) at which they perform, giving us no insight into whether any new 
ideas were necessary for such improved performance. Since he feels that the 
deduction of truths outside a mathematical system is unique to humans, it would 
have been interesting to see what he would have written about recent computer 
programs that have found mathematical proofs not devised by humans. 
</P>
<P>
His intuitions concerning computers seem to be based on limited experience in 
front of a video screen with canned programs, rather than with flexible and 
adaptive computer systems that interact with the environment. In the last few 
years, there have been important new insights and successes incorporating the 
interactive and flexible function of the type in biological brains into 
computer programs -- variously known as neural networks, parallel distributed 
processing, or connectionism -- that have led even some stalwart opponents of 
strong AI to now embrace the concept of computer mind. 
</P>
<P>
Surely no one can fault Penrose for failing to solve the mind-body problem; but 
his book, given its frequent reliance on narrow intuition and the 
unpersuasiveness of its central, novel hypothesis, should be viewed with 
skepticism by the lay reader and only approached after checking on any of a 
number of good books (on both sides of the strong AI debate): "Brainstorms" (D. 
Dennett), "Godel, Escher, Bach" (D. Hofstadter), "The Self and Its Brain" (K. 
Popper and J. Eccles), "Neurophilosophy" (P. S. Churchland) or "Minds, Brains 
and Science" (J. Searle). 
</P>
<P>
The greatest value in "The Emperor's New Mind" is its clear descriptions of 
difficult but fascinating physics, material that will interest the lay reader 
even though it may have little direct relevance to the strong AI debate. The 
analyses of fundamental issues in quantum mechanics such as the "Schrodinger's 
cat" conundrum, the origin of the "direction" of time (past to future), and the 
process surrounding the creation and destruction of black holes all are 
presented very well. The mathematics accompanying the explanations is 
illuminating, though rarely essential to an understanding. 
</P>
<P>
The profound mind-body problem and the strong AI debate come to all of us at 
one time or another in our reflective moments; it motivates many of us working 
in the field. Although we are surely a long way from demonstrating or refuting 
the strong AI hypothesis (indeed it might never be demonstrated to everyone's 
satisfaction), any important advances will require insights from a variety of 
disciplines: philosophy, computer science, psychology, mathematics, biology, 
and so on. The greatest benefit Penrose's book may have is to help attract more 
physicists into the debate.

"Tobacco Road" and "Deliverance." Lil' Abner, Snuffy Smith, the Snopeses and 
the Kallikaks. Clay eating, hookworm and pellagra. Hooded Klansmen and 
pot-bellied sheriffs. The South's poor whites have been poorest of all, 
perhaps, in the way we have stereotyped them over the decades. An exception was 
James Agee, who lived with Alabama sharecroppers in 1936 and whose book, "Let 
Us Now Praise Famous Men," with photos by Walker Evans, illuminated their lives 
with the clarity of a flash of summer lightning. But Agee was an outsider who 
stayed only a few weeks. Ever since then, his poetry has called for a prose 
supplement, with tables and graphs, by a historian who could address the 
broader questions: How did so many Americans get so poor? What kept them in 
poverty for generations? And what happened later?

sharecroppers, has provided just such a supplement in "Poor but Proud." 
Blending scholarly research with oral histories, he points to the Civil War as 
the beginning and World War II as the end of a long, downward slide. In 1860, 
about 85% of white Alabamians owned land. By 1930, nearly two-thirds of the 
state's white farmers were tenants. Flynt concludes: "No other cycle in 
American history resulted in so sustained and extensive a downward mobility for 
so numerous a population." 
</P>
<P>
"Poor but Proud" is written dryly and dispassionately, but a distinct, liberal 
point of view emerges. Contrary to the "white- trash" stereotype, Flynt blames 
circumstances, not character defects, for Southern poverty. He criticizes state 
government for doing so little to help, and credits New Deal relief, however 
spotty, with preventing thousands of deaths during the Depression. He faces the 
fact of racism but points out that it created its own punishment: Poor whites' 
unwillingness to ally with poor blacks crippled their efforts to unionize labor 
and gain political power. And at a time when the poor, not just in Alabama, are 
still being blamed for their misfortune, he aims to remind us of "where we came 
from and the price others paid for our journey." Michael Harris

Applause for Randy Fitts and his chiding of the poor diction in TV (Viewers' 
Views, Oct. 8). While it would be fine to get Martha Ray to put the "g" back in 
"strength," there are worse offenses, such as anchorpersons who keep saying 
"Bill," "Kel," "Linda," "Bree," "Keith," etc. to each other as they read the 
news off the TelePrompTer.

I agree with Francis Albert of Long Beach that the canceled CBS show "The 
People Next Door" had an "idiotic concept" (Viewers' Views, Oct. 8), but any 
program with Jeffrey Jones as its star couldn't be all bad. He's one of the 
most underrated actors around today, full as he is with sly wit and sharp, 
funny malice. I didn't care for the show's overblown premise either (about a 
cartoonist whose imagination comes to life), but it was a pleasure seeing Jones 
every week.

After forcing myself to sit through "Roseanne," I know why Roseanne Barr didn't 
receive an Emmy nomination. She didn't deserve one and never will unless they 
put in a whining category. The entire cast needs basic acting lessons, which 
still would do little to improve the show because it is written on the level of 
6th-grade bathroom humor. I cannot believe "Roseanne" gets better ratings than 
"The Cosby Show." I hold little hope for the future of TV.

Photo, More foreigners visited Korea for the 1988 Olympics than had done so in 
all of the 20th Century to that point. The resulting scrutiny, during the 
months that preceded the games, became a weapon in the hands first of student 
demonstrators and later of others who brought democracy to Korea. The story of 
their victory is captured in "From the Streets to the Olympics: Korea, 
Democracy and the 24th Olympiad, 1987-88" (Art Space Publications, P.O. Box 
74-1447, Los Angeles 90004; 300 pp.), a book of extraordinary photographs by 
Hyungwon Kang, who clearly took some of his photographs at great personal risk. 
With a brief opening text and well-placed captions in Korean as well as 
English, the book is a unique memorial to a historic transition.

As one who suffers from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (now called Chronic Fatigue 
Immune Dysfunction Syndrome), I very much appreciated the two recent episodes 
of NBC's "The Golden Girls" that dealt with this baffling and debilitating 
ailment. The shows did not exaggerate the enormous frustration of trudging from 
doctor to doctor only to be told, "It's all in your head," or dismissed 
altogether.

On Oct. 10, my teen-age daughter was watching an NBC movie titled "Desperado: 
Outlaw Wars." I sat down for just about 10 minutes to see what it was like, and 
I was appalled. In the scene I viewed, a man was shot in cold blood for no 
reason other than to flaunt the killer's bravado. Then, after the victim was 
down, the gunman emptied his gun into the body. Several other men, all armed, 
stood around watching this and didn't do anything about it. 
</P>
<P>
I fully understand that this was only a movie, and that Westerns always have 
had "shoot-'em-up" scenes. But this wasn't like that. It seemed to be conveying 
a powerful message to my daughter and other impressionable young people that 
you can get away with murder if you're tough enough, thus glorifying the 
killer.

'THE POOL HALL' TAKES ITS CUE ON A&amp;E CABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
James Earl Jones, who plays a pool hall owner in "Third and Oak: The Pool 
Hall," has a pool table in his suburban home. He piles books on it. But, in 
case his 6-year-old son ever wants to learn to play, it's there. 
</P>
<P>
"Third and Oak: The Pool Hall," a three-character play by Marsha Norman, will 
be shown on the Arts &amp; Entertainment cable network Thursday (6 p.m. and 10 
p.m.) and again next Sunday. It's the first of four hourlong plays by Pulitzer 
Prize-winning playwrights to be shown on A&amp;E on the first Thursday of every 
month through February as "American Playwrights Theatre," a GM Mark of 
Excellence presentation. 
</P>
<P>
The play takes place in a run-down pool hall that Jones' character is preparing 
to sell. His best friend's son (Mario Van Peebles) stops by and what starts out 
as a casual chat turns to more intimate talk of secrets, promises, friendship 
and the high cost of loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Jones wasn't sure he wanted to play the character, saying he likes to 
portray people who are worthwhile. "That was the problem here. I had to accept 
he was a jerk. I'm playing not a villain but not a right guy. I had to readjust 
my thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"He is one of the blind ones. I defined Troy Maxson in 'Fences' (Jones played 
Maxson on Broadway) as a man who didn't distinguish his principles from his 
prejudices. This is such a man. He seemed gratuitously racialist if not racist 
when it came to references to people outside his race, particularly to the girl 
who visits the pool hall. She is blond. She qualifies, in his eyes, for 
derision. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a problem with that. I don't like to promote gratuitous racialism at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
"I had to understand that white people had never meant anything good to him. He 
can't understand how on a romantic level they can mean something good to a 
young man he thinks of essentially as his son. He can't see genuine affection 
and love between people who come from different worlds. 
</P>
<P>
"My character, who's in a closed society, behaves as if he's a Mafia don. He 
expects obedience and the mantle to be passed." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Mario Van Peebles (of the TV series "Sonny Spoon"), the cast 
features Debra Cole. 
</P>
<P>
The author, Marsha Norman, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1983 for " 'night Mother." 
The other playwrights to be represented in the series are Eugene O'Neill, Paul 
Zindel and Tennessee Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Jones has been around a long time, but he said that doesn't mean good scripts 
are going to come "flowing your way in excess. There are more good actors than 
good works." 
</P>
<P>
But the actor stays busy. He was a poet in the film "Field of Dreams," played 
civil-rights leader Vernon Jordan in the first installment of "Saturday Night 
With Connie Chung" on CBS and recently narrated "Ivory Wars," about African 
elephants, on the Discovery cable channel. 
</P>
<P>
He has made several movies, not yet released, since "Field of Dreams." "I have 
a 6-year-old. I have to keep working. I don't make multimillions per movie. I 
don't think anybody should, frankly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran actor was complimentary about the young crowd of actors coming up. 
"The young man who played my son in 'Fences,' Courtney Vance, is in 'Hamburger 
Hill.' It's on cable and I've seen it five times to see his scenes. He's a 
phenomenal actor. He ranks with young actors like Eric Roberts, Terence Booth, 
Alec Baldwin, Kevin Costner. They're strong without being macho bulls. They're 
strong as people." 
</P>
<P>
Jones next is going to Louisiana to play a man who runs a store in the movie 
"Convicts." The wardrobe mistress told him to bring clothes that he wore in 
"Matewan," which was about coal miners in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
Some moviegoers recognized his voice as Darth Vader in "Star Wars," though the 
credits listed the actor inside the costume and helmet. Using his voice was an 
afterthought, after the movie was shot, Jones said. "I didn't feel it was 
proper for me to take credit. I had been a member of the board of directors of 
the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences when Mercedes McCambridge's 
voice was in Linda Blair's body in 'The Exorcist.' 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to get involved with that sort of thing again. I denied it 
during the whole exposure of the first episode. I took credit in the third 
('Return of the Jedi') because I was going to be bumped off." 
</P>
<P>
When a criticism that black voices shouldn't be used for villains is quoted, 
Jones erupts. "That's a racialist point of view, as destructive, limiting and 
negative as racism is. I heard a lot of it. That's when black people who need a 
platform can't find anything better to talk about. That's embarrassing. There 
are a lot of really important issues and they had to light on that to talk 
about." 
</P>
<P>
Jones, whose training was on stage, mostly acts in movies and TV now. "The 
energy factor gets more and more difficult. I'm not happy unless I have a role 
that's totally engaging. I commit for more than six months and I get burned 
out. If I did a small part I'd be happier, but I wouldn't be able to make a 
living from it. 
</P>
<P>
"So I will do less stage work, only special things and probably short 
engagements. I think my days of commercial theater are probably coming to an 
end. I'll go to pasture in movies and TV." 
</P>
<P>
But he won't retire. "When we stop doing, we stop being. Most actors can keep 
functioning till they can't walk any more." 
</P>
<P>
He says with a laugh that he's considering modifying his rich, deep voice for 
TV commercials. "I just finished doing the voice of a car. They wanted a kind 
of Darth Vader voice. I did enjoy doing those commercials. I will have to look 
for another road to do commercials. Maybe some squeaky voice. I don't know."

The tidings at this year's Bouchercon, a recently concluded annual encampment 
of mystery writers and mystery lovers, was not simply that the mystery field is 
burgeoning (nearly 1,500 titles in 1988, according to a tabulation by the Drood 
Review of Mystery in Boston). The news within the news, so to speak, was that 
women are not only writing mysteries, they are writing mysteries with female 
protagonists. 
</P>
<P>
In his history of crime fiction, "Mortal Consequences," Julian Symons 
identifies Ann Katharine Green as the first American woman to write a detective 
novel, "The Leavenworth Case," in 1878. Green's father was a criminal attorney 
and her research was near at hand. Among the English pioneers was F. Tennyson 
Jesse, a grandniece of Lord Alfred. She wrote a series of stories about an 
amateur detector named Solange Fontaine. 
</P>
<P>
In modern times, women have had an importance in the field quite 
disproportionate to their numbers. Any popularity poll of mystery writers in 
the 20th Century would surely put Agatha Christie at the top, with Dorothy L. 
Sayers, Margery Allingham, Josephine Tey and Ngaio Marsh high on the list. P. 
D. James, Ruth Rendell, Martha Grimes, Amanda Cross, Antonia Fraser, Dorothy 
Salisbury Davis (honored here at Bouchercon) and Mary Higgins Clark might lead 
a list of active writers. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in the reading if not in the writing, the mystery was taken to be a man's 
game. Although she later invented Jane Marple and the husband-and-wife team of 
Tommy and Tuppence Beresford, Agatha Christie established her fame and her 
readership with Hercule Poirot (whom she later found exasperatingly tiresome). 
Sayers' creature was the archly mannered Lord Peter Wimsey, and while his wife 
Harriet Vane received increasing attention and was by no means a stereotyped, 
reactive figure, the series was essentially all Wimsey. Allingham spent more 
than 30 years with the deceptively vacuous Albert Campion (now emerging on 
television). Ngaio Marsh's man was Roderick (Rory) Alleyn. P. D. James 
generally writes about Adam Dalgliesh, with just one outing thus far for a 
woman, Cordelia Gray, in "An Unsuitable Job for a Woman." 
</P>
<P>
Rendell's series characters are Inspector Wexford and his sidekick Mike Burden. 
Grimes has given us Richard Jury. And so it has gone. 
</P>
<P>
But the job is no longer thought unsuitable for women. In England, Amanda 
Fraser broke the pattern decisively with her Jemima Shore, a television 
personality who is an inadvertent sleuth but a clever one and who is as well 
the very model of the liberated woman, with a married lover to whom she is not 
subservient. 
</P>
<P>
Now the United States, where Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler established 
a whole genre, has a commanding lead in generating a new genre, or a co-genre, 
in which remarkable, non-traditional women, often professional private eyes, 
work as crime-solvers in a style and milieu about as far as you can get from 
Nancy Drew. 
</P>
<P>
The nearest Drew equivalent, though only in the limited sense of being a 
well-mannered lady, would have to be Amanda Cross' Prof. Kate Fansler, an 
academic whose work-life presumably echoes that of Carolyn Heilbrun, the 
Columbia professor for whom Cross is the nom-de-crime. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Pickard's Jennifer Cain is not a private eye but runs a civic foundation 
in a small Eastern city, a position from which she has no trouble stumbling 
onto greedy developers and other wellsprings of crime. 
</P>
<P>
But Fansler and Cain are anomalies. The new norm is the female private eye who, 
without sacrificing sensitivity, is in many details quite the same as her male 
forebears. The incomes tend to range from low to non-existent (one sleeps on 
the floor of her office). The investigating ladies endure many a beating, and 
they are as familiar with the dark, mean streets as ever Philip Marlowe or Sam 
Spade was. Above all, they are no less dedicated to discovering truth and 
seeing justice done, whether within the law or outside it. 
</P>

Sara Paretsky's V. I. Warshawkski was once a lawyer in the public defender's 
office. She is now a Chicago PI (private investigator, of course) whose cases 
run a gamut of hot social issues, from industrial pollution to incompetent 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
At a panel discussion called "After Equality -- What?," Paretsky, who began 
writing after she earned a Ph.D. at the University of Chicago, said: "I'm sick 
of our being called women writers instead of just writers." 
</P>
<P>
She was asked if the new fictional women were too tough. " 'Are the women 
tough?' is a tough question," Paretsky said. "I've been re-reading all of 
Chandler. Marlowe is so alone. I. V. has connections. She can be weak and 
wounded and need help. In our society, tough means you're alone, and when you 
think about it, that's pretty sick." 
</P>
<P>
Sue Grafton of Santa Barbara writes about Kinsey Millhone, a private eye who 
first appeared in " 'A' Is for Alibi" in 1982 and has been working her way 
through the alphabet. Millhone could have had coffee with Ross Macdonald's Lew 
Archer, so similar is their milieu and the kind of personal, impassioned crime 
they encounter. 
</P>
<P>
Marcia Muller's Sharon McCone is a private investigator for a San Francisco law 
firm. Somewhat less well-defined than Millhone so far, she is a comparable 
mixture of sensibility and toughness and her detecting is not done from an 
armchair. 
</P>
<P>
Now as always, there seems no more fertile turf for the private eye than 
California. During Bouchercon, St. Martin's Press and the Private Eye Writers 
of America presented the fourth Best First Private Eye Novel award -- $10,000 
and publication by St. Martin's. It went -- for the fourth time -- to a 
Californian, Gar Anthony Haywood, whose "Fear of the Dark" will be published 
next year. The third winner, Karen Kijewski, is a former English teacher now 
tending bar in Citrus Heights to support her writing habit. Her heroine in the 
recently published "Walk" is Kat Colorado, a PI specializing in the corporate 
jungle, where she takes many a hard knock. 
</P>
<P>
A well-reviewed 1988 novel was "Donato &amp; Daughter" by Jack Early, about a 
weary NYPD detective who is outranked by and alienated from his daughter, an 
NYPD lieutenant. "Early," it was disclosed at Bouchercon, was in fact Sandra 
Scoppettone, who thought the pseudonym went better with a first-person male 
narrator. Her next book, Scoppettone told an audience, will be under her own 
byline and feature a lesbian detective. The dominance of male characters in 
crime fiction is eroding fast. 
</P>
<P>
The changing patterns in crime fiction are nicely symbolized by a new group 
called Sisters in Crime, which took form at a breakfast meeting at Bouchercon 
three years ago and now has 400 members, from writers to publishers. Organized 
by Sara Paretsky, the group agitates for equal review space for women writers 
(a sore point) and against gratuitous violence toward women in mysteries and 
all other fiction forms. 
</P>
<P>
The organization tabulated three years of crime-novel reviews in the New York 
Times and found only 14% of the books were by women. The Drood Review of 
Mystery made its own count of the 1988 mystery output. The journal found that 
of 1,487 titles published (or which came to their attention), 1,065 were 
written by men, 358 by women (a few others were by mixed teams or authors not 
identifiable by gender). The 3-1 ratio turned out to be the same ratio in which 
Drood itself reviewed books by men and women. 
</P>
<P>
(A rough count of the reviews in 24 monthly editions of "Bloody Sunday" in this 
newspaper showed the same ratio, 131 books by men, 45 by women, just about 3 to 
1.) 
</P>
<P>
Why women should have such an affinity to mysteries as both readers and writers 
is a lively question. Prof. B. J. Rahn of Hunter College, who teaches a course 
in crime fiction by women and who conducted a penetrating interview with Ruth 
Rendell at Bouchercon, noted some of the possible answers in a recent magazine 
piece. 
</P>
<P>
"Women," Rahn said in an interview, "are way out in front when it comes to the 
whydunit." They are themselves sensitive, she said, and they have insights into 
the deep emotions that can lead to acts of sudden rage or slow revenge. 
</P>
<P>
P. D. James, Rahn wrote, has observed that women "have a keen eye for the 
commonplace details used in constructing clues and spotting inconsistencies in 
suspects' stories." 
</P>
<P>
That women do the most reading is no surprise, says Rahn. "It's been that way 
for 200 years. They had the leisure to read. The novel was written for them, 
and of course the novel was not then thought to be real literature." 
</P>
<P>
It also may be that the leisure to write (or the traditional inability to find 
satisfying work in a male-dominated world) helped initially to explain the 
presence and the prestige of women in crime fiction. 
</P>
<P>
In the postwar years, Rahn has concluded, women have pioneered in the whydunit, 
taking the mystery from an intricate puzzle to a full-blown novel. "They have 
mastered the form with ease, wit and charm." 
</P>
<P>
Bouchercon, named after the late mystery writer-critic-anthologist Anthony 
Boucher, who preferred the name to his own William Anthony Parker White, this 
year had as honored guests Simon Brett, Ruth Rendell, Dorothy Salisbury Davis, 
the veteran editor Joan Kahn and H. R. F. Keating. The film of Keating's 
Inspector Ghote novel, "The Perfect Murder," was shown. It has no American 
distribution, although with all else it is a vivid look at present-day Bombay. 
This year's event, the 20th, drew about 250 writers, of whom half were women, 
and 750 fans, the clear majority of them women, as if to confirm tangibly what 
the surveys have been showing. 
</P>
<P>
At the panel on "After Equality -- What?" the participants agreed that crime 
fiction still was regarded as an inferior, stepchild literary form. Did they 
care? Panelists and audience in unison shouted a reverberating "No!"

A BANQUET RESURRECTS AN ALMOST-FORGOTTEN MEXICAN CULINARY TRADITION

<P>
THE FEAST began with a blur of wings. 
</P>
<P>
Days before, my grandmother Delfina had decided to get rid of the pigeons 
crowding the coop that leaned against my aunt's back-yard fence in Canta Ranas 
(Singing Frogs), one of the older Southeast Los Angeles barrios. The pigeons 
roosting in the tall, battered coop had become too fertile, and when I looked 
up into the coop's feather-tufted plywood boxes, I saw that they squirmed with 
plump, young birds. It was the late '50s. I must have been 8 years old. 
</P>
<P>
My grandmother set our feast in motion by calling her sons and nephews to 
slaughter the innocents. My cousin and I were assigned to clear out the large 
abandoned grocery store next door, where the meal could be served more easily. 
A confusion of smells -- overripe fruit, dust, cilantro -- lingered amid the 
store's clutter of old furniture and splintered sawhorses. Next door, under my 
Aunt Estela's patio, my father and his brothers had their hands full -- 
literally -- of gray down as they plucked and dressed dozens of birds. 
</P>
<P>
DELFINA, I LATER discovered, had turned to the past for the day of the feast. 
She had unearthed the sopa de pichones (loosely translated, squab on saffron 
rice) recipe from a collection recorded in an elegant, elliptical script by my 
great-great-aunt, Catalina Clementina Vargas. The recipe is one of 109 dated 
June 7, 1888, and it has little to do with today's notions of nouvelle Mexique 
or the Tex-Mex fare we've come to associate with Southwest cookery. Instead, 
Catalina's old recipe typifies the cuisine of Guadalajara, which is roughly 
comparable in function and complexity to provincial Cantonese or French 
cuisines. Unfortunately, in Los Angeles, history conspired to drive this aspect 
of Mexican cooking underground. But it is part of a rich, 400-year-old urban 
tradition that endures in the private kitchens of families like mine. 
</P>
<P>
My grandmother simmered the squabs with parsley, onion and garlic in her large, 
weathered pot. She cooked the rice in the broth of the squabs, adding freshly 
ground cloves, cinnamon and saffron. Finally, minutes before serving, she 
returned the squabs to simmer again in the broth and rice suffused with 
paella-like spices. The trick, my aunt recalls, was leaving enough broth to 
impregnate the squab with the spices without leaving the rice too dry. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, my cousin and I had cleared enough space in the empty store 
for a long row of tables. By early evening, when everyone had arrived, my 
grandmother and my aunt proudly made their entrance with platters of squab on a 
bed of fire-orange rice. Garnishes of raw, sliced onion immersed in vinegar, 
salt and a hint of oregano, and gallon jars of iced, sweetly sour jamaica 
(hibiscus tea) also were brought to the table. My grandmother took her 
customary pleasure in serving my uncles, cousins, aunts and eldest sister, who 
wasn't quite sold on the idea of eating baby birds. Midway through the meal, 
Estela says, Delfina probably made everyone laugh by telling how her first try 
at getting rid of the pigeons failed when the birds returned to their old coop, 
flying all the way back from her brother-in-law's house a dozen or so miles 
away in Artesia. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not sure what else Delfina prepared. My aunt says she's certain the meal 
would have opened with steamy bowls of puchero, a hearty soup swimming with 
carrots, turnips, zucchini, parsley, beef bones, some chicken and garbanzos or 
rice, which Delfina cooked in the pot tea-bag-style by placing the grains in 
small cheesecloth sacks. A simple lettuce salad dressed with olive oil and 
vinegar might have preceded the main course. The whole affair would end with a 
sancocho de guayaba, a typical Mexican dessert of halved guavas stewed in 
cinnamon and piloncillo, an unrefined, flavorful sugar. 
</P>
<P>
It is the taste of squab and saffron that stays with me. I found the faintly 
bitter, smoky intensity of saffron, made bolder with cinnamon and cloves, 
intoxicating. Between bites of pickled onion, I sucked the dark meat from 
diminutive bones and probably stained my shirt. Afterward, the tables were 
pushed aside and our parents began to dance. I lay my head on my grandmother's 
lap and fell asleep as she smoothed my forehead. 
</P>
<P>
But my great-great-aunt's squab recipe wasn't the only source of my 
grandmother's culinary inspiration. A year before she was married, my 
grandmother and a cousin had copied another 141 recipes from Catalina's mother, 
Trinidad Vargas. All of these recipes, in their own curious way, open windows 
to another time. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Catalina's consume violento (violent consomme) is as much an 
elegant, subtle soup as it is a proclamation of romantic sentiment. The recipe 
gets its name from the manner in which an egg yolk and Jerez (Spanish sherry) 
are briskly whisked into a steamy tureen just before it is served to admiring 
guests. Delfina kept the memory of Catalina's time alive by preparing her soups 
for both her immediate and extended family. 
</P>
<P>
MY GRANDMOTHER'S culinary influence also followed me home. Besides the typical 
recipes from her home state of Jalisco, Delfina taught my mother how to prepare 
a delicate, aromatic stew that has a poetic title -- conejo en huerto meaning 
"rabbit in the garden." This stew, fragrant with quince, plantain and Spanish 
olives, was derived from one of Catalina's recipes with substitutions for 
hard-to-get ingredients such as tejocotes, a pungent, apple-like fruit from 
central Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe she (Delfina) was a superb cook," my mother, Lilly Valle, told me 
recently. "If she taught anyone, she wanted them to learn to do things her way. 
Like the recaudo (a puree of roasted tomato with onion or garlic added to soups 
or sauces), which is a basic part of Mexican food. To me, some of these things 
seemed like minor details. But she would get angry if you didn't do it her 
way." 
</P>
<P>
I'm convinced that for Delfina, the recipes were nothing less than formulas for 
invoking cultural and culinary values as well as personal memories. They 
reminded her that she was both Mexican and a daughter of Guadalajara's mestizo 
(racially mixed European, Indian and African) petit bourgeoisie. 
</P>
<P>
After doing some culinary archeology, I realized that many of the recipes 
represented a distinct Guadalajara cuisine. The recipes that follow, for 
example, don't appear in 19th-Century Mexican cookbooks, such as "El Nuevo 
Cocinero Mexicano," a dictionary of Mexican cuisine that was published in Paris 
in 1872 and is only available in rare-book collections, or, to my knowledge, in 
any texts published since then. This isn't surprising. 
</P>
<P>
Recipes in 19th-Century Mexico were usually passed from mother or aunt to 
newlywed daughter or son. A middle-class Mexican kitchen was more likely to 
contain an updated 18th-Century version of a Spanish cookbook than a Mexican 
cookbook. It would take a revolution in 1910 and its convulsive nationalist 
aftermath for Mexico to take greater pride in preserving its mestizo art forms. 
</P>
<P>
For me, these recipes have more than a strictly culinary meaning. Knowingly or 
not, my great-great-aunt, my grandmother and my aunt passed along to their 
descendants a tradition of recording family history while preserving Spanish as 
a written language in a sometimes hostile English-speaking world. Despite the 
stereotyped peasant image of Mexicans, these recipes are reminders that a huge 
portion of Mexican cultural history was written in cities, which still shape 
artistic styles and gastronomic revolutions. These recipes spring from a rich 
urban cuisine that predates fajitas or nouvelle experiments to elevate comida 
casera (home cooking) to haute elegance. More lie buried in all the places 
where memories are hidden. Estela and my wife, Maria, by reviving the following 
recipes, have merely indicated a way of excavating this culinary history in our 
midst.

PRIVATE LIVES: THE WHAT-TO-WEAR NIGHTMARE; 
</P>
<P>
IN CORDUROY WHEN EVERYONE ELSE IS IN CHIFFON, SHE'S OUT OF THE FASHION LOOP

<TEXT>
<P>
IN NEW YORK,where I grew up, I knew what to wear. I learned the rules at my 
mother's knee which was almost always covered by a very sheer nylon stocking. 
My mother had natural fashion instincts, honed by years of working in garment 
district offices. It was the '50s and there were a lot of rules, but she had 
years to explain and enforce them: Black was always smart but not to be worn to 
weddings. White was all right between Memorial Day and Labor Day but not 
encouraged (bone or beige were "smarter"). Each season and each hour of the day 
or night had its appropriate fabrics. Buttonholes should be hand-bound, hems 
and lining hand-tailored. Fluff, clutter and bright colors were to be avoided. 
So were fads, which in a month would be a "Ford," the worst solecism in my 
mother's fashion book. "Forget about those bright fall colors," she advised 
every August. "By November, every smart woman will be wearing black." 
</P>
<P>
I rebelled, of course. My first spring after college, I used a chunk of my own 
paycheck to buy a machine-tailored mint-green coat. My mother turned out to be 
right. The green didn't work often enough, and the coat lost its shape. I slid 
back into her rules, as if they were a bowl of warm oatmeal -- the color a good 
spring coat ought to be. 
</P>
<P>
But then life changed in incalculable ways. The fashion industry was turned 
inside out by the youth culture of the '60s. My mother died. And I moved to 
California, where there are no rules, no seasons and hardly any coats. Cast 
adrift, I found that I was often wearing the wrong thing. 
</P>
<P>
At first, I blamed my husband. In our first years here, invitations came 
through him. "The Atwells asked us to come over on Saturday night," he would 
announce, utterly oblivious to the important question of how dressy the evening 
would be. Filtered through my husband, "come over" sounded like slacks and a 
sweater. To the Atwells, I learned, it meant a formal dinner for 12, a 
hairbreadth below black tie. 
</P>
<P>
More often, I was wrong in the other direction, failing for years to catch on 
to California casual. When I knew it was a dinner party, I would get into one 
of the little black dresses my mother swore would always be perfect -- except 
at weddings. But in Southern California, everyone else comes to dinner in loose 
cotton things, a category of clothes I have since learned is called "weekend 
wear." (Weekend wear is a literal term. People put the stuff on to do the 
marketing on Saturday morning and stay in it until they go to bed on Sunday 
night, no matter what activities intervene.) 
</P>
<P>
My husband's view, of course, is that it doesn't matter. He knows what he'll 
wear -- his blue blazer. That's what he always wears, sometimes with a tie, 
sometimes without, usually with the tie in his pocket. "Just wear what you want 
to," he'll say. "Be yourself." But every women knows that awful sinking feeling 
of walking into a room and knowing she's gotten it wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Most think it's worse to have overdressed. It makes you seem stuffy, like 
someone who tries too hard, and maybe has time on her hands. But being 
underdressed is almost as humiliating. You feel clunky and boorish with all 
that chiffon swirling airily around your cord blazer. 
</P>
<P>
But what I wonder each time is how the others got it right. There may be no 
rules -- at least none that I can figure out after 20 years here -- but there 
seems to be a silent network, an invisible sorority that passes the word. I see 
women having lunch in subtle variations of the same outfit. Maybe they 
telephoned each other in the morning. But then, on an otherwise ordinary day in 
February, every woman on the street is wearing pale-ivory hose, as if they were 
all anticipating spring together. I am still in opaque black. Is there some 
telephone tree that I'm not on? A loop I'm out of? 
</P>
<P>
It seems childish for grown women with important things on their minds to call 
each other and ask, "What are you wearing?" But I have started doing it, hoping 
that, if at least two of us make the same mistake, we can commiserate over the 
appetizers. The most futile move is to call the person who invited you. She 
will lie because she doesn't want you to go to any trouble. "It's a Sunday 
afternoon in the Valley," said a good friend who had sold me tickets to a 
fund-raiser. "People will practically come in their pajamas." Yeah, sure, as we 
say in New York. But the pajamas were Ungaro and Armani and under a lot of 
jewelry. I was in brown slacks. 
</P>
<P>
But the worst event for the out-of-the-loop dresser is a California wedding. 
The phrase is almost oxymoronic. Weddings -- to say nothing of marriages -- are 
too conventional, too etiquette-bound for hang-loose Californians. That's why 
so many people here get married on horseback or catamarans. There is no point 
in asking anyone what to wear. No one knows, and everyone will wear what she 
pleases. Weddings are elaborate festivals of self-expression. There will be 
women in taffeta poufs and gold lame drape, movie stars in bag lady dresses, 
close relatives of the bride in denim jumpsuits. And almost always, somebody 
will wear sneakers. Since there is no prevailing look, I inevitably end up (a) 
feeling that I could have saved money by wearing something I already had, or 
(b) regretting that I didn't buy something dressier. 
</P>
<P>
So I have turned certain knowledgeable friends into fashion advisers, 
mother-substitutes perhaps. Gwen is social and always perfectly turned out, as 
the magazines say. She knows what's in style each season before the clothes are 
out of the cartons at Neiman's. And she has my mother's sense of 
appropriateness, updated for the '80s. (Patent leather, for instance, is now a 
year-round shoe.) 
</P>
<P>
What she lacks is any sense of middle-class economics. When I mention that I 
need a winter coat for a week in New York, she brightly suggests mink. "There 
are times when nothing else will do," she explains. When I needed clothes for a 
book-promotion tour a few years ago, Gwen scouted the stores and recommended 
five outfits by a designer whose low-priced line started in four figures, 
American money. 
</P>
<P>
My friend Nancy is a more practical adviser. She dresses well, too, and since 
she used to work in the fashion trade, I believe she has a finger on the pulse 
of the invisible network. But sometimes, my advisers -- who have never met -- 
disagree, especially when I am trying to get pulled together for a California 
wedding. "Dyed-to-match shoes," says Nancy. "Only black, gold or silver for 
evening," says Gwen. Confused, I wander into shopping malls and pour my 
troubles out to salesclerks and other strangers. In this state, I will ask for 
fashion advice from women with their blouses buttoned lopsided and young girls 
with hair in primary colors. 
</P>
<P>
So last week, I went to the local branch of Loehmann's, the store at which my 
mother trained me, and I sidled up to a smartly dressed middle-aged woman with 
a New York accent. "I need something to wear to a wedding," I muttered. 
</P>
<P>
"Black," she said. "I had five weddings last summer, and I wore black to every 
one. It looks stunning and no one notices if you wear it again." This woman is 
close to my age, despite her resemblance to my mother. 
</P>
<P>
"Black?" I said. "I thought you weren't supposed to wear black to weddings." 
</P>
<P>
She waved this away with a confident hand. "That went out years ago." 
</P>
<P>
I nodded in amazement. How did she know that? Who called her?

GARDENS: GROWING FOR SHOW; 
</P>
<P>
AT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BOTANICAL GARDENS, THE FIRST SIGN OF SPRING IS THE FALL 
PLANTING THAT PROMISES ACRES OF SPECTACULAR COLOR 
</P>

Arboretums are places of experimentation, where experts work to discover what 
plants can grow in our climate and how best to grow them. The autumn months are 
an especially busy time at Southern California's botanical gardens. Says 
Francis Ching, director of the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum system: 
"We wish we could plant everything in the fall, but we have to spread the work 
out. So in the fall, we concentrate on those things that must be planted now -- 
spring's flowers and bulbs." Fall is the best time to plant just about 
everything in the California garden -- spring flowers and winter vegetables, 
bulbs, perennials, ground covers, shrubs and trees. Last spring, we 
photographed some of what botanical gardens had planted the previous fall. 
Discussions with four of the gardens' plantsmen led us to some fascinating 
combinations of plants and some surprising cultural tips. 
</P>
<P>
VOLUNTEERS DO MOST of the fall planting in their own corner of this very large 
and under-funded garden, but not everything is planted at the proper time 
because many of the plants are donated by nurseries after their fall sales. In 
fact, some spring flowers aren't set out until early February. But they still 
manage to bloom in time for spring. 
</P>
<P>
Full of wonderful and often-unexpected mixes of flowers, this former dump site 
looks like a cottage garden in a storybook. "Because this garden is planted 
entirely by our volunteers, they can do whatever they want," says Norma 
Cantafio, who directs the volunteers' South Coast Botanic Garden Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Surprises occasionally come from flowers that return each year from seed. Red 
flax and calendulas are two varieties that make a delightful mix, reappearing 
on their own each winter, if the volunteers simply water and weed. 
</P>
<P>
A big bed of Tecolote ranunculus planted from tubers in October is also full of 
linaria, which looks like baby snapdragons. (The garden is so wild that the 
occasional weed -- in this case, the sow thistle -- sneaks in.) The same effect 
could be achieved by purposely sowing seeds of these easy-to-germinate annuals 
-- especially the red flax (Linum) and the linaria -- among other plants. 
</P>
<P>
DESPITE ACRES of camellias, roses, perennials and fall-planted annuals, tulips 
are superintendent George Lewis' favorite spring flower. Not only does he grow 
them on a scale unheard of in California, but he also grows them perfectly -- 
not an easy feat here. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis and his staff buy bulbs as early as possible and immediately refrigerate 
them for a minimum of six weeks. Loamy clay soil is amended with organic 
matter, plus an amazing addition: A four-inch layer of washed builder's sand is 
mixed in to improve drainage. "Tulips hate wet feet," says Lewis, who 
landscaped rooftop gardens in New York City before joining the Los Angeles 
arboretum system 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Bulbs are planted 8 to 12 inches deep, much deeper than the usually recommended 
6 inches. (Planting occurs at the end of December, in time for an array of 
blooms for the Spring Garden Show that begins on April 1). A handful of bone 
meal is dropped into each hole, and bulbs are set on top of it. They are not 
watered but survive on rainfall and moisture already in the soil (beds are 
thoroughly watered a few days before planting) until foliage breaks through the 
ground. Withholding water prevents rotting and encourages what Lewis proudly 
terms a "massive" root system. 
</P>
<P>
After leaves appear, plants are watered frequently -- every other day by March. 
When new growth reaches 3 inches, high-nitrogen liquid fertilizer is applied 
every two weeks. As flowers wither, bulbs are pulled out of the ground and 
tossed on the compost heap. Tulip bulbs grown here are not successfully 
recycled, as they are in the East Coast. "Only three out of 10 would return 
next year," Lewis estimates. 
</P>
<P>
BECAUSE THIS GARDEN is devoted to native California plants, horticulturist 
Carol Bornstein keeps a close eye on weather forecasts. She plants just before 
fall's first good rain, usually in November. In October, she and her staff 
decide what to plant and ready seed. Then they wait. 
</P>
<P>
Wildflowers are annual plants and must be sown from seed every fall, but 
Bornstein, who has a master's degree in horticulture, reports that she no 
longer tries to plant huge meadows of them. Instead, she says, her staff is 
"dribbling in wildflower seed in smaller swaths" because weeds can quickly 
smother wildflowers and smaller areas make weeding easier. Permanent clumps of 
native bunch grasses and perennials break up these meadow areas so that they 
don't look completely bare in summer. For example, the buttercup-yellow meadow 
foam, Limnanthes douglasii, disappears for the summer. California poppies and 
blue-eyed grass, a blue-flowered relative of the iris, hang on. 
</P>
<P>
To plant wildflowers, Bornstein's staff clears several square feet, scatters 
seeds, then gently rakes or waters them in. Plants appear after the first rain 
and bloom all spring. When flowers drop their seed in summer, they are covered 
with a mulch of wood chips to keep weeds and dust down. The following fall, the 
area is cleared away and seed sown again. 
</P>
<P>
NARY A WEED nor a dead bloom lingers here. This tiny botanical garden, which 
occupies one city block on Coast Highway, is perhaps best known for its 
spectacular, picture-perfect flower displays. "How do you get your plants to 
look so good?" is the question director Wade Roberts hears most often. 
</P>
<P>
"The answer is simple," says Roberts, who was a landscape designer and Cal Poly 
San Luis Obispo-trained horticulturist before he joined Sherman Gardens 23 
years ago. "We fertilize and water consistently. It doesn't matter what you 
feed with as long as you are consistent," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
Calendulas, cyclamen, pansies and stock are planted in beds throughout the 
garden in October, but the sunniest flower bed is saved for ranunculus, the 
garden's most dazzling spring crop, which is planted in mid-February. Though 
ranunculus are usually planted in the fall as tubers, here they are planted 
from 4-inch (quart) pots, good news for those home gardeners who don't get 
around to fall planting on time. In October, the bed is planted with Iceland 
poppies, and when they poop out (or get flattened by winter rains), in go the 
ranunculus. Roberts plants a special seed-grown strain, Bloomingdale, that is 
sold and planted already in flower. Though this strategy is more costly than 
planting tubers, he believes it is worth the expense because beds are kept full 
of flowers -- bare dirt never greets visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Another favorite is Primula obconica, which likes rich soil with ample organic 
matter and grows in the shade. "We plant these from 4-inch pots in mid-October, 
and they last for five or six months, blooming all the time. They're an 
incredibly sturdy flower; even rain doesn't knock them down," Roberts says. 
</P>
<P>
Weeds and dead blooms disappear quickly, however, "thanks to our tireless 
volunteers who are issued buckets every morning."

Everybody wants to make thrillers these days. West German director Wolfgang 
Petersen ("Das Boot") starts production on his contemporary thriller, "Plastic 
Nightmare," Jan. 8 in San Francisco. Tom Berenger stars as a man suffering from 
amnesia. The West German film maker will write, produce and direct for 
FilmAccord Productions. . . .

<P>
Meanwhile, negotiations continue for Kurt Russell to play the lead in 
"Ricochet," an urban crime thriller for producer Joel Silver and HBO 
Productions. Fred Decker ("Monster Squad") will write and direct. This film 
gets under way in January in L.A. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Carl Weathers will play a hit man on the trail of a serial killer in the 
thriller "Fever of the Hunt" for Esparza/Katz Prods. The twist in Larry Cohen's 
script is that Weathers has been hired by victims' families. No director is yet 
set for the production which hopes to get under way in early 1990, probably in 
Texas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Corey Haim ("Lucas") is currently tooling around Utah in "The Dream Machine" -- 
actually a Porsche that, unknown to Haim's character, contains the body of a 
murder victim in its trunk. Lyman Dayton directs the independent feature for 
International Creative Exchange. . . . Bruce Dern has signed to do his 50th 
feature film. 
</P>

WINE: GAUER POWER; 
</P>
<P>
VINEYARD'S FIRST RELEASE IS A SILKY CHARDONNAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WHEN I FIRST visited the Gauer Estate Vineyards last month in the mountainous 
backdrop of the Alexander Valley in northern Sonoma County, two oft-heard 
phrases came to mind: "Wine is made in the vineyard" and "the Chardonnay vine 
is a tool for extracting flavor from the soil." 
</P>
<P>
The particular soil at Gauer is volcanic, of a complex composition, and has 
resulted in grapes that have led to gold-medal wines for several north coast 
wineries. But Gauer, now intent upon extracting the wonders of the soil for its 
own benefit, has produced a wine under its own label. 
</P>
<P>
Gauer President Allan Hemphill, wine maker Kerry Damskey and I drove up from 
the valley floor to the vineyards, which include the Pinnacle and the 
Wellspring, both set at an elevation of 1,600 to 2,000 feet, and Monument 
Vineyard, between 800 and 1,200 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
From the ridge back of the Pinnacle Vineyard, we could trace the red volcanic 
soil between the vine rows to a point where the rows descended to an 
outcropping of gray basalt earth. From there, they went upward again to the 
craggy Wellspring, then down to the Monument Vineyard, strewn with granite 
boulders. The porous soil gives the roots ideal drainage. We were aware of the 
natural air-conditioning system -- cool marine air being drawn in from the 
Pacific, providing even-ripening weather. All the vines, which appeared 
virtually manicured, are individually drip-system irrigated with natural spring 
water. 
</P>
<P>
"Our object," Hemphill said as we made our way down the mountainside, "is to 
bottle the essence of these wonderful vineyards." 
</P>
<P>
The vineyards, all part of the 5,000-acre Gauer Ranch, began with Ed Gauer, who 
planted them in 1970. Now 86, Gauer maintains his home there, although he sold 
the ranch in January to the Huntington Beach Co., a division of Chevron. 
</P>
<P>
Vinwood Cellars, the wine-making facility on the valley floor, offers custom 
crushing services for both small lots and major vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, Damskey drew samples of an '88 Cabernet Sauvignon from Nevers 
oak-barrel storage. Beyond the soft tannins were plummy tastes of potential 
elegance. These samples were followed by an '88 Cabernet Franc, almost 
green-peppery in taste. And finally a blend of these and 5% Merlot was tasted. 
The blend is delightfully greater than the sum of the individual parts. It will 
be released in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
At lunch, I tasted the first released wine of the Gauer Estate Vineyard, the 
1987 Alexander Valley Chardonnay ($16), the golden essence of those mountain 
vineyards. Damskey vinified grapes from four vineyards separately. Eighty 
percent of the final blending underwent malolactic fermentation, and the wine 
was aged in two French oak barrels, Vosges and Nevers. The Chardonnay is 
delicate. It has aromas of fruit and flowers and is silky soft. 
</P>
<P>
This wine is an arresting California experience. Although it is one of the 
newest entries in the Chardonnay derby, its California origins should be one of 
our rightful sources of pride.

THE GODFATHER'S SON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having opposed Brooklier in a loan-sharking case some years ago while I was a 
special attorney with the Organized Crime Strike Force, I have no quarrel with 
those who are impressed with the trial skills of the son of L.A.'s former don. 
It is the aura of glamour (or is it a halo?) that Murphy constructs around 
Brooklier that does a disservice to those who accept the burden of immigrant 
status without resorting to illegal activities to make their way. That Tony 
Brooklier's father may have been faced with the difficult and soul-searching 
choices of immigrants the world over does not excuse, or sanction, an end run 
around those barriers by the use of extortion and racketeering. I object to the 
rendering of criminal figures in sympathetic terms by the sleight of hand of 
humanizing the experience of someone like Tony Brooklier. I recall, with as 
equal and untainted an affection as Tony Brooklier has for his father, my 
grandfather pressing pants for 50 years in the poor but proud sections of 
Brooklyn for the munificent sum of $65 per week, 25 cents of which was usually 
shared with the grandchildren. A tattered picture of my grandfather with a sign 
reading "Please to tell your friends" in his tailor shop as he sought to 
scratch out a living on the Lower East Side trumpets more courage than an army 
of racketeers and hoodlums.

The article glorified the mob, Mafia, organized crime and all they represent by 
idolizing the lawyer son of an infamous crime figure. Many of the types of 
organized crime and its roots are in the past, though certainly operant today. 
It made me wonder if in the not so distant future this same Sunday magazine 
will be featuring an article on the offspring of our now infamous gangs.

<P>
How offensive! Featuring Anthony Brooklier on the cover, and with the 
sentimental mush in the article about what an upstanding citizen he is! 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't help being born into that "family" -- and growing up with organized 
crime -- but he could have used his education to defend victims of their 
drug-running, murderous "business." M. CAMPBELL

Wow! Revlon says it's OK for me to grow older this year ("Fall Beauty Report: 
Ageless Grace," by Paddy Calistro, Sept. 17)! Too bad it's not good business 
for your magazine to show human beings accepting each other as they are.

The fall season is always the most active time for pop record releases, as the 
music industry gears up for its November-December season, during which nearly a 
third of all records, tapes and CDs are sold. But that can mean confusion for 
even the most serious music fans, as old favorites compete with newcomers for 
consumers' attention. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the albums expected to generate the most critical and commercial 
interest of all the post-Labor Day releases during the hectic year-end rush. 
The selections, presented in alphabetical order, cover all parts of the pop 
music spectrum, from heavy-metal fathers (Aerosmith) and sons (L.A. Guns) to 
rap innovators (the D.O.C., Young M.C.); from rock kings on the rebound (Bob 
Dylan, the Rolling Stones) and pop queens living the lush life (Linda Ronstadt, 
Barbra Streisand) to country chartbusters (Randy Travis) and folkie mavericks 
(Tracy Chapman, Michelle Shocked). 
</P>
<P>
 The comments are by the Times pop writers indicated, but the star ratings (one 
is poor, five a classic) sometimes reflect additional pop staff input. 
</P>
<P>
 The reviewers are Robert Hilburn, Dennis Hunt, Mike Boehm, Richard Cromelin, 
Jonathan Gold, Steve Hochman, Connie Johnson, Craig Lee, Kristine McKenna, 
Randy Lewis, Don Snowden, Chris Willman, Paul Grein, Duff Marlowe and Don 
Waller. 
</P>
<P>
*** HIGHWAY 101, "Paint the Town,"Warner Bros. The band can boast Paulette 
Carlson's dusky, tremulous lead vocals, twangy, Buck-inspired electric guitars 
and singing pedal steel lines, wrapped around a solid batch of songs in which 
lovers depart, hearts break and the losers and winners both wind up at the 
local honky-tonk. (Lewis) 
</P>
<P>
* OAK RIDGE BOYS, "American Dreams,"MCA. Had the original "Saturday Night Live" 
crew ever gotten around to a "Bad Country Music" skit, it couldn't have been 
any funnier -- or sadder -- than this is, albeit unintentionally. This 
compendium of cliches is as sincere as Joe Isuzu and as authentic as the 
synthesized accordion on an ersatz Cajun tune. (Lewis) 
</P>
<P>
*** POCO, "Legacy,"RCA. Granted, this reunion isn't quite up there with a 
Beatles comeback, but that's a bonus in this case, since there aren't 
stratospherically high expectations of this seminal country-rock group's five 
original members. There are a few modest love songs by Richie Furay and Jim 
Messina, a stone-country waltz from ex-Eagle Randy Meisner and plenty of 
luscious harmonies from all concerned. (Lewis)

*** DEBORAH HARRY, "Def, Dumb &amp; Blonde,"Sire. Harry shows her Blondie roots 
in a focused collection of yearning pop and sassy synth-dance maneuvers. A 
welcome return to form for a pop-punk pioneer. (Lee)

*** 1/2 BARBRA STREISAND, "A Collection -- Greatest Hits . . . and 
More,"Columbia. She wisely omitted high-charting but vapid duets with Donna 
Summer and Don Johnson to make room for such less commercially potent but far 
more compelling works as "All I Ask of You" and "The Way He Makes Me Feel." The 
album includes two new songs: the elegant but powerful ballad "Someone That I 
Used to Love" and the plodding rock ballad "We're Not Makin' Love Anymore."

*** HEAVY D. &amp; THE BOYZ, "Big Tyme,"Uptown/MCA. "Big Tyme" is a new style 
of rap album, achieving a fine balance of deft beats, heavy attitude, funky 
lyrics and catchy melodies. There are the usual quota of James-Brown inspired 
soul grooves, but Heavy D., the self-described overweight lover, stretches out 
too, raiding the heavy funk file with a vengeance. (Marlowe) 
</P>
<P>
**** SOUL II SOUL, "Keep On Movin',"Virgin. This diverse alliance of female 
vocalists, deejays and musicians borrows beats from the mellow side of New York 
hip-hop and adds string backing in lieu of standard R&amp;B horns, arriving at 
a natural, uncontrived sound with strong reggae and African influences. A 
bright, cheery and appealingly innovative debut. (Marlowe)

</P>
<P>
** 1/2 AEROSMITH, "Pump,"Geffen. In this era of total Aerosmithification, the 
band comes out with an oddly non-Aerosmithy album. The hooks are of the 
lightweight, catchy variety, and the songs are stripped down to the point where 
they seem almost pop sketches. (Gold) 
</P>
<P>
*** 1/2 THE D.O.C., "Nobody Does It Better,"Ruthless/Atlantic. This year's hot 
hard-core hip-hop sound comes from Dr. Dre, the Compton deejay behind Ruthless 
Records, which in the last several months has released million-selling rap LPs 
by J.J. Fad, Eazy-E and N.W.A. Dre has transformed this Texan into something of 
a Compton-style Big Daddy Kane, a guy who plays the English language the way 
Itzhak Perlman plays a Strad. (Gold) 
</P>
<P>
** FASTER PUSSYCAT, "Wake Me When It's Over,"Elektra. Faster Pussycat is rock 
'n' roll about marketing rock 'n' roll, the hard-rock answer to the Pet Shop 
Boys. Their neo-Sweet second album is, if anything, even less glossy than their 
decidedly unglossy debut, funny, fast and clever. (Gold) 
</P>
<P>
*** ICE-T, "Freedom of Speech . . . Just Watch What You Say,"Sire. Wherein the 
lisping legend in leather listens hard to N.W.A, funks up his beats and finally 
makes the awesome hardcore gangster-rap album you always knew he had in him. 
After all, he invented the genre. It's crude -- if this LP didn't offend you, 
it wouldn't be doing its job -- but effective. His best one yet. (Gold) 
</P>
<P>
*** 1/2 BIG DADDY KANE, "It's a Big Daddy Thing,"Cold Chillin'/Reprise. Kane 
has always been the most virtuosic of hardcore rappers, fast-flowing rivulets 
of words leaping and splashing across the beat. Finally he has rhythm tracks as 
smooth as his seamless rhymes and beats that are funky enough. Definitely the 
street-rap record of the fall. (Gold) 
</P>
<P>
* 1/2 L.A. GUNS, "Cocked and Loaded,"Vertigo/PolyGram. L.A. Guns shares 
influences, image and misogynist lyrics with Guns N' Roses. Though Tracii Guns 
is an appealingly thrashy guitarist, Phil Lewis' vocals are flat and 
characterless. L.A. Guns' first album was raw andpunky, but felt genuine. This 
second album seems as if the band has been staring too long at the golden ring. 
(Gold) 
</P>
<P>
*** MOTLEY CRUE, "Dr. Feelgood,"Elektra. Their strongest album since "Shout at 
the Devil" half a dozen years ago. Of all the L.A. glam-metal bands of the 
'80s, Motley Crue has always understood both the Bay City Rollers kind of 
teen-dream appeal and the importance of the riff: the pounding, shrieking, 
two-chord monoliths that have always powered the best hard rock. (Gold)

Randy Lewis, Don Snowden, Chris Willman, Paul Grein, Duff Marlowe and Don 
Waller. 
</P>
<P>
*** MELISSA ETHERIDGE, "Brave and Crazy,"Island. A far superior effort to its 
Grammy-nominated predecessor. Bad relationships, Etheridge's lyrical raison 
d'etre, are dealt with in more interesting (i.e., not just angry or tragic) 
terms, and the music strikes more major keys and different palettes. (Willman) 
</P>
<P>
*** 1/2 RICKIE LEE JONES, "Flying Cowboys,"Geffen. "When I was young I was a 
wild, wild one," Jones sings on two different songs. The album, her first in 
five years, has elements of melancholy and loss, but the awareness of time 
passed has made her sweeter and more good-tempered. Not as moving as 1981's 
"Pirates" nor as complex as 1984's "The Magazine," but scarcely less valuable. 
(Willman) 
</P>
<P>
*** LENNY KRAVITZ, "Let Love Rule,"Virgin. Overflows with enough exhumed peace 
and love to maybe make even Wavy Gravy choke. For most of the album, Kravitz is 
knocking off either Lennon or Prince. His shocking derivation would be plenty 
irritating if he didn't pull it off with such naive nerviness. (Willman) 
</P>
<P>
*** LINDA RONSTADT, "Cry Like a Rainstorm -- Howl Like the Wind," Elektra. The 
material recalls her middle-of-the-rock-road '70s work, but the approach -- 
mostly contemporary ballads written by tunesmiths like Jimmy Webb, drenched in 
swirling, overbearing orchestral arrangements -- is as highly conceptualized as 
on her last few albums. The presence of angelic-voiced Aaron Neville as duet 
partner on a third of the 12 cuts is a big plus. See interview. (Willman) 
</P>
<P>
*** 1/2 MICHELLE SHOCKED, "Captain Swing,"PolyGram. In the kind of unexpected 
stylistic turn typical of Neil Young, Shocked has mostly put her country-folk 
aside in favor of a big-band blues effort full of horns and electric guitar. 
Her wry, powerful voice is more than up to the task of making this a full-blown 
success and not just a novel sidetrack. The more political side of her writing 
is missed, but gee, this is a blast. (Willman) 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 TEARS FOR FEARS, "The Seeds of Love,"Mercury. The ivory-flashing English 
duo is back with an ambitious effort that eschews rampant technology for 
"organic" band playing. After the opening three songs, even a skeptic might 
primal-scream in praise of the lads' growth and scope, but the remaining five 
tracks make any hollering seems a tad premature. (Willman) 
</P>
<P>
**** NEIL YOUNG, "Freedom,"Reprise. An album of minimalistic, expressionistic, 
mostly just plain raw rock and folk in a down-tempo, pessimistic mode that 
recalls stark '70s efforts like "Tonight's the Night" more than any mood 
Young's affected in recent years. Though it's not always easy to grapple with, 
it may be his best album of the decade. (Willman)

POP MUSIC SPECIAL; 
</P>
<P>
THE RECORD INDUSTRY'S BIG PUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Boehm

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fall season is always the most active time for pop record releases, as the 
music industry gears up for its November-December season, during which nearly a 
third of all records, tapes and CDs are sold. But that can mean confusion for 
even the most serious music fans, as old favorites compete with newcomers for 
consumers' attention. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the albums expected to generate the most critical and commercial 
interest of all the post-Labor Day releases during the hectic year-end rush. 
The selections, presented in alphabetical order, cover all parts of the pop 
music spectrum, from heavy-metal fathers (Aerosmith) and sons (L.A. Guns) to 
rap innovators (the D.O.C., Young M.C.); from rock kings on the rebound (Bob 
Dylan, the Rolling Stones) and pop queens living the lush life (Linda Ronstadt, 
Barbra Streisand) to country chartbusters (Randy Travis) and folkie mavericks 
(Tracy Chapman, Michelle Shocked). 
</P>
<P>
 The comments are by the Times pop writers indicated, but the star ratings (one 
is poor, five a classic) sometimes reflect additional pop staff input. 
</P>
<P>
 The reviewers are Robert Hilburn, Dennis Hunt, Mike Boehm, Richard Cromelin, 
Jonathan Gold, Steve Hochman, Connie Johnson, Craig Lee, Kristine McKenna, 
Randy Lewis, Don Snowden, Chris Willman, Paul Grein, Duff Marlowe and Don 
Waller. 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 GRATEFUL DEAD, "Built To Last,"Arista. The best songs are the three 
valedictory numbers sung and co-written by Jerry Garcia. When it's Uncle 
Jerry's Band, the Dead is something to hear. But when he steps back and lets 
the other guys take over, "Built to Last" subsides into something less durable. 
(Boehm) 
</P>
<P>
*** BILLY JOEL, "Storm Front,"Columbia. He's obnoxious, derivative, almost 
always playing to the grandstand with oversized gestures. But that can be 
overlooked when the craftsmanship and tunefulness are as strong as they are 
here. A rock-oriented treat for Joel's fans, and maybe even a guilty pleasure 
for those who think of him as an obnoxious, derivative grandstander. (Boehm) 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 ELTON JOHN, "Sleeping With the Past,"MCA. The album is dedicated by John 
and Bernie Taupin to soul pioneers, but it's no juicy soul update. Instead, 
it's a savvy piece of smooth pop craft, with warm singing, consistently 
hummable melodies and as strong a sequence of tunes as John has put together 
since his mid-'70s days as a dominant force on the pop charts. (Boehm) 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 THOMPSON TWINS, "Big Trash,"Red Eye/Warner Bros. While nothing here is 
as good as the Twins' mid-'80s hits, "Big Trash" does serve as a credible 
comeback album. Tom Bailey and Alannah Currie don't have anything deep or 
original to say, and they are fairly shameless about stealing from such sources 
as the Doors and Talking Heads, but they offer more humor and vitality than 
most of the dance-rock competition. (Boehm) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coming Up: 
</P>
<P>
Other albums scheduled for release in the coming weeks include: 
</P>
<P>
ABC, Art of Noise, Basia, Bobby Brown (dance mixes), Club Nouveau, Phil 
Collins, Erasure, Gipsy Kings, Ofra Haza, the Jesus and Mary Chain, Joan Jett, 
Quincy Jones, Kid Creole, Kris Kristofferson, Yngwie Malsteem, Roches, 
Shinehead, Keith Sweat, Tiffany, the Time, Jody Watley (dance mixes), 
Whitesnake and Peter Wolf.

MUSIC AND DANCE NEWS: OPERATIC LIFE AND DEATH IN BOSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Boston now has three opera companies -- one rising, one moribund and one newly 
born -- as the historic city closes this decade. 
</P>
<P>
Newly born is Boston Opera Theater, a company established in the spring of 1989 
by some former leaders of Sarah Caldwell's still-embattled Opera Company of 
Boston, and now raising money and support for a 1990-91 season expected to 
begin in December of next year. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be misleading to characterize our group as just disgruntled," says 
Opera Theater executive director Robert Cannon, who at one time was president 
of Caldwell's company. 
</P>
<P>
"Simply, we felt that the time had come to establish a new and dynamic opera 
producing company to take Boston into the next century. Our assessment of the 
previous company was that it could not be reorganized." 
</P>
<P>
Among the national and international artists who will work with the new 
company, Cannon says, are stage director Peter Sellars and his artistic 
associate, Craig Smith. (In Los Angeles, Sellars declined to say more to The 
Times beyond confirming that he would be involved with Opera Theater.) 
</P>
<P>
"But this will be more than a company for Peter, who, after all, has a contract 
in Los Angeles. It will be a broad-based company with an international outlook, 
and one that will bring in important productions from the outside, as well as 
mount its own, new work. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are doing now is raising money and putting the pieces together. We 
expect to make a major announcement of our plans in January." 
</P>
<P>
Moribund is Caldwell's Opera Company of Boston, which has yet to announce its 
artistic plans for 1989-90, and is beset by a deficit reportedly in the 
neighborhood of $7 million. Repeated calls to the company netted no one willing 
to speak to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Rising out of academia is Boston Lyric Opera. Formerly connected with 
Northeastern University, but recently broken off from that connection, Lyric 
Opera opened its 16th season in a new theater, and with high hopes, last month. 
</P>
<P>
According to general director Justin Moss, a Californian who came to 
Massachusetts from Baltimore Opera, "We have taken a whole new direction with 
this season." 
</P>
<P>
He says two performances of Puccini's "Tosca" in September were sold out and 
artistically successful; yet to come are concert performances of Wagner's 
"Fliegende Hollander" in January and staged "Traviatas" in March. Is there room 
for three opera companies in Boston? 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely. As a theater town, for instance, Boston has audiences for 
everything. Opera is no different. We have a very educated and discerning 
population." 
</P>
<P>
JOFFREY CHANGES: Gerald Arpino, artistic director of the Joffrey Ballet, has 
announced the promotions of Scott Barnard to assistant artistic director and 
Barbara Forbes to ballet mistress, plus the addition of seven new dancers to 
the 1989-90 roster. 
</P>
<P>
New members are: Daniel Baudendistel, who rejoins the Joffrey after dancing 
with American Ballet Theatre and the Lar Lubovitch Company; Pascal Benichou, 
formerly of the San Francisco Ballet; Alexander Brady, formerly with the 
1988-89 Joffrey II Dancers; James Conlin, who has danced with the companies of 
San Francisco and Berkeley; Pierre Lockett, formerly of Dance Theatre of 
Harlem; Jacob Rice, who has performed with companies in Washington State, 
Connecticut and Virginia, and Amanda Smith, a member of Joffrey II Dancers from 
1987 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
CELEBRATING: American Music Week, this year scheduled for Nov. 6-12, will be 
noted locally in different ways: 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

"as inspired by the Robert Longo exhibit." Information: (213) 857-6010. 
</P>
<P>

offer a concert, Nov. 6 at 8 p.m. in Gindi Auditorium at the University of 
Judaism, featuring music by Dvorak, Lou Harrison and Ingolf Dahl. 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE: Violinist Nina Bodnar has been appointed concertmaster of the St. Louis 
Symphony, effective in January. Winner of several prestigious international 
competitions, including the Jacques Thibaud competition in Paris, the 
California-born violinist, 28, has been concertmaster of the Santa Barbara

transportation. Vargas has been associated with the San Bernardino Museum and 
City Theatre Company in Pittsburgh. . . . Milton Salkind, president of the San 
Francisco Conservatory since 1966, will retire at the end of June, 1990. In his 
24-year tenure as head of the conservatory, Salkind has overseen growth and 
development of the institution from a 42-student school of limited resources to 
its present size as a 250-student, degree-granting college with a $9-million 
endowment. . . . Sylvia Kunin, originator of the Musical Encounter television

NOTEBOOK: MA MAISON WELCOMES CIGAR SMOKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The after-dinner cigar is pretty much a thing of the past in American 
restaurants today. Some eating places, of course, ban smoking altogether. 
Others allow cigarettes, but forbid cigars and pipes as well -- or, at the 
least, restrict the enjoyment of them to bar areas or lounges. 
</P>
<P>
At least one Los Angeles restaurateur thinks this is a shame, and has decided 
to do something about it -- once a month, at any rate. Starting Nov. 6, Patrick 
Terrail will institute monthly "Cigar Smokers' Nights" at his Ma Maison in West 
Hollywood's Ma Maison Sofitel Hotel. A special seven-course menu degustation 
(at $59 per person) will be offered in addition to the regular menu, and 
Dunhill will set up a "cigar buffet," offering a large selection of cigars to 
smokers who have not brought their own. A newly enlarged selection of Cognacs 
and other after-dinner drinks will supplement the cigars. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of guests who enjoy a cigar after their meal," Terrail explains, 
"and usually we have to ask them to move to the bar. But somebody who spends a 
couple hundred dollars on a good meal doesn't necessarily want to be moved 
around the minute he's finished. So I decided to have one night a month when 
the cigar smoker would have the right of way." 
</P>
<P>
But won't the ghost of cigar smoke linger in the room for a day or two after 
the event, possibly offending later diners? Terrail replies that the entire 
roof of the restaurant opens, giving Ma Maison "wonderful ventilation." 
</P>
<P>
Cigar Smokers' Nights will be held on the first Monday of every month at Ma 
Maison until further notice. Terrail stresses, in conclusion, that non-cigar 
smokers will be welcome on these evenings -- "But, of course," he adds, "they 
won't be able to say, 'Will you please put that thing out.' " 
</P>
<P>
A NO-SHOW PLAN THAT MIGHT JUST FLY: Whenever the issue of charging restaurant 
"no-shows" for unkept reservations is being debated, supporters of the notion 
tend to point out that hotels do levy such charges; opponents counter that 
airlines do not. That latter point isn't completely valid anymore. The 
government of Singapore now permits all airlines serving that tiny nation to 
charge the equivalent of about $80 to customers who buy tickets and make 
reservations in Singapore itself and then let those reservations lapse. The 
airline no-show problem is particularly dire in Singapore, as it happens, since 
local law prohibits overbooking or the resale of seats which are already 
theoretically sold. 
</P>
<P>
NEW TABLES IN TOWN: Tara Govind, former co-proprietor of Gitanjali on La 
Cienega and proprietor of Shanta in Santa Monica, has remodeled the latter 
establishment and reopened it as British Raaj, featuring both traditional 
Northern Indian cuisine and a repertoire of Anglo-Indian dishes. . . . Other 
local restaurant newcomers include Hurry Curry of Tokyo in West Los Angeles, 
opened by the proprietors of the Famous Enterprise Fish Company in Santa 
Monica; the Star Cafe in Montrose, specializing in pasta and "gourmet pizza"; 
Manhattan West on La Cienega, said to be inspired by "New York's famed SoHo 
loft district"; the Malibu Deli in Malibu (where -- Celebrity Alert! -- Pia 
Zadora reportedly has been seen buying cookies for her children), and Raphael's 
Trattoria in Palm Springs, an offshoot of Raphael's in Beverly Hills. WHAT'S 
COOKIN': If you hurry, you might still be in time to find a place at tonight's 
second annual anniversary-and-Hallowe'en party at Champagne in West Los 
Angeles. A six-course dinner (culminating with a dessert called Chocolate 
Fright) will be served for $85 per person. There will be dancing to a live 
orchestra and costumes are encouraged. . . . If you're too late for the party 
tonight, you can catch up with Champagne proprietors Patrick and Sophie Healy 
when they join restaurant critic Larry Lipson, wine maker Randall Grahm (of 
Bonny Doon Vineyard), and wine educator Larry Tepper for an afternoon symposium 
on French food and California wine, next Sunday from noon to 3:30 p.m. at 
Champagne. The event, which costs $65 per person, is sponsored by the 
California State University, Northridge, extension program. Call (818) 885-2644 
for details. . . . Also next Sunday, chefs Guy Gabriele and Ramon Cardenas from 
Cafe Pierre in Manhattan Beach join colleagues Michel Blanchet of L'Ermitage, 
Robert Bell of Chez Melange, Jean-Pierre Bosc of Fennel, Claude Alrivy of Le 
Chardonnay, and Jean-Luc Chassereau of The Cookery in Sacramento in a 
celebration of the bicentennial of the French Revolution at the Culbertson 
Winery in Temecula. The chefs will collaborate on a menu that will attempt to 
demonstrate "the evolution of French cuisine both in its native country, the 
U.S.A. and the world." Music and dancing will also be featured at the all-day 
event. Call (213) 545-5252 for more information.

HERE'S LOOKING AT YOU, PORT DE PECHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Restaurant du Port de Peche, Port de Peche, Casablanca. Telephone: 31.85.61. 
Dinner for two, food only, $20-$50. 
</P>
<P>
"All my traveling," Ford Madox Ford once wrote, "has always been one long 
planning to return. One should skim through a place and if one likes it 
establish little contacts, with a waiter, a marketwoman, an honest merchant, an 
eating-place, or merely those contacts that are part of memory. Then, when one 
returns to stay a little, one has already made some sort of preparation for 
digging in." 
</P>
<P>
The first time I dined at the Restaurant du Port de Peche in Casablanca, that 
legendary seaport on Morocco's Atlantic coast, these words (or at least some 
approximation of them) came back to me. I knew that business would bring me to 
Casablanca again in the months to come, and I knew that this, above all, was an 
eating place with which I wanted to establish "little contacts." I also knew 
that when I did return to the Port de Peche, "digging in" would be exactly what 
I'd want to do. 
</P>
<P>
Morocco is famous for its seafood, and Casablanca is famous for its seafood 
restaurants. The best known of these, along the Boulevard de la Corniche near 
the lighthouse of El Hank, invariably have French names -- La Mer, Le Cabestan, 
Ma Bretagne, Au Petit Rocher, etc. -- and serve fish and shellfish in the 
French manner, to diners who are themselves either French or Francophone (and 
apparently Francophile) Moroccan. The food can be very good at these places -- 
Le Cabestan is perhaps the best -- but there is a certain sameness to them, and 
they tend to be a bit too reminiscent of the portside restaurants of the Cote 
d'Azur -- which is presumably not what one comes to Morocco for. 
</P>
<P>
The Restaurant du Port de Peche is different. Obviously, it too has a French 
name -- meaning simply "The Fishing Port Restaurant," after the unglamorous, 
hard-working fishing port behind whose gates it is located. (There is, in fact, 
a bare-bones fisherman's cafe downstairs from the main restaurant, with a 
blackboard menu written only in Arabic.) But both the dishes it serves and the 
people who eat them are considerably more diverse than usual. 
</P>
<P>
The clientele includes everything from young German backpackers to elderly 
French merchants obviously long-ensconced in "Casa" (as nearly every 
French-speaker calls the city), from large Moroccan families in traditional 
dress to local swells in polo shirts and blue jeans. The food is not so much 
French as all-purpose Mediterranean (steamed clams and mussels, fried calamari, 
grilled swordfish, etc.) with a few Moroccan seafood dishes not commonly found 
in the tourist haunts thrown in -- all of it fresh, honest, delicious. 
</P>
<P>
What attracted me to the place immediately, though, was something more elusive: 
It simply had a kind of buzz to it, a warm, rackety energy that told me right 
away that this was the place to be. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was the crowds. The restaurant seats about 150, and is always 
jam-packed, usually with a few dozen people waiting in line. (Reservations are 
not accepted.) 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was the lived-in, or at least dined-in, self-confidence of the corny 
but comfortable interior, with its red tile floors, white stucco walls, red 
tablecloths overlaid with pink paper, fishnet curtains on ships'-stern windows, 
red-shaded table lamps, and fish prints and seascapes on the walls. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was the casual efficiency of the waiters, bustling this way and that, 
forever grinning, chattering, dispensing recommendations and cautions. 
</P>
<P>
On my first visit to the Port de Peche, I ate a big bowl of sweet little 
carpetshell clams steamed in butter and their own juices; a first-rate grilled 
langouste or spiny lobster (more or less what we call Pacific or rock lobster), 
so full of flavor that I had to suck and lick every bit of juice and roe and 
butter from its every crevice; and finally a tajine of sea bass. The tajine is 
a staple of traditional Moroccan cuisine -- a dish of meat, fish or fowl with 
vegetables, braised with spices in the dome-topped clay vessel that gives the 
specialty its name. Besides big hunks of excellent sea bass, this particular 
tajine included green peppers, green olives, tomatoes, carrots, potatoes and a 
blend of spices in which paprika and cumin seemed to predominate. It was 
exquisite. 
</P>
<P>
Returning to the restaurant recently, I started with one of the great secrets 
of Moroccan gastronomy -- a platter of impeccable oysters from the village of 
Oualidia, 50 miles or so southwest of Casa. People who have never visited this 
corner of Morocco are usually surprised to learn that there are oysters raised 
on this coast at all. In fact, the oysters of Oualidia are superb -- 
medium-small, salty-sweet, wonderfully full of flavor. (Adventurous travelers 
might wish to visit one of the several oyster "parcs" open to the public in 
Oualidia itself. Here, if you don't insist on such amenities as bread, lemons, 
wine, napkins, or even forks, you can eat wonderful oysters taken out of the 
water before your very eyes . . . for a third or a quarter of what they cost in 
a good restaurant in Casa.) 
</P>
<P>
After the oysters, I sampled fried baby squid and a combination of fried merlan 
or whiting and miniature sole. The whiting and sole were excessively battered, 
and didn't seem to have been fried to order -- but the fish was very fresh, and 
the batter was excellent. I finished with the redundantly named boulettes de 
merlan kefta (both boulettes and kefta mean meatballs), tiny dumpling-like 
spheres of ground, spiced whiting in a thick sauce flavored with cumin and what 
I think was coriander. My anticipation was not betrayed. 
</P>
<P>
This time at the Port de Peche, incidentally, I got to know a couple of waiters 
-- strengthening the contacts, as it were. And I'm already thinking about what 
I'm going to, shall we say, dig into the next time I get there. Some mussels, 
maybe, small and barnacled; fried baby squid, if it's the season; gigantic red 
prawns, simply grilled.

It was business as usual inside the Star Trek attraction at Universal Studios. 
Volunteers from the audience had taken the stage dressed as Starship Enterprise 
crew members, Klingons and other aliens. The Enterprise was about to be 
attacked, as it is four to six times every Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Admiral, estoy detectando una nave Klingones (Captain, I am detecting a 
Klingon spaceship)," a crew member said. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish-speaking director kept up a rapid-fire stream of instructions to 
actors and jokes to the audience. In the dressing room backstage, 
Spanish-speaking Universal staff members looked after costume and wardrobe 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
When the show was over -- "Hasta la vista, Kirk," said the Klingon commander -- 
the actors gathered at the stage apron. Clearly, they felt a post-performance 
exhilaration. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw that program many times at home and it was a lot of fun to be in it," 
Claudia Reyes of Los Mochis, Mexico, said through a translator. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish-language Star Trek adventure is part of a growing campaign by 
Universal Studios Hollywood to attract Latino customers. Each weekend for the 
past three years, several of Universal's tram tours have been conducted in 
Spanish. The amusement park in Universal City drew large crowds with an 
international mariachi festival in August and an appearance in March by stars 
of telenovelas, or the Latino soap operas that appear on Spanish-language 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
Universal also built a theater for production of the television show "Hablamos 
de Cine" ("Let's Talk About Cinema"), a program of movie reviews broadcast on 
KMEX -- Channel 34. Park visitors can watch as the show is taped. 
</P>
<P>
David Weitzner, worldwide head of marketing for Universal Studios Hollywood, 
said the special attractions are working. 
</P>
<P>
"Our Latino attendance so far this year is up 67% from the total for all of 
1988, and we only expect that to increase," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The potential for growth appears to be enormous. Last year, 65,000 of the 
park's 4.2 million visitors were Latino, Weitzner said, a scant 1 1/2%. 
Meanwhile, Latinos make up an estimated 2.6 million, or 30%, of Los Angeles 
County's 8.5 million population. Weitzner expects the park to draw 5 million 
visitors this year, with Latinos numbering 100,000, or 2% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
With such a large market to tap, other amusement parks and attractions are 
tailoring events and marketing to the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
This year the Joffrey Ballet, with help from the service organization Plaza de 
la Raza, sent representatives to a meeting of a Latino business association to 
promote its "Billy the Kid" program and distribute half-price ticket coupons. 
The Joffrey held a cocktail reception at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for 
those who attended the show. 
</P>
<P>
"Four hundred people came," said Nancy Neal Davis, the Joffrey's West Coast 
general manager. "That's how you build a following. They had a great time, and 
they'll tell others." 
</P>
<P>
The Joffrey also invited Latino schoolchildren to rehearsals, where principal 
dancer Beatriz Rodriguez spoke in Spanish about the various jobs available in 
ballet and theater. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Museum of Art offers tours in 
</P>
<P>
Spanish by appointment and, as part of its "Sundays in the Museum" program, 
buses in families from community centers in Latino neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Some attractions have not done extensive tailoring of programs to bring in 
Spanish-speaking patrons. Magic Mountain in Valencia has only a Father's Day 
promotion featuring Latino bands and disc jockeys. 
</P>
<P>
"Our basic philosophy is we market the park to the Southern California 
community and a lot of that community is Spanish-speaking," said Courtney 
Simmons, the park's public relations manager. "We advertise in their newspapers 
and on TV and radio." 
</P>
<P>
The leader in the effort clearly is Universal, where admission is $21 for 
adults and $15.50 for children 3 to 11. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Bension, president of Universal Studios Hollywood, said the campaign began 
because Latino visitors asked to take the tour in Spanish. Universal has 
expanded its foreign-language program to include, by appointment, tours in 
German, French, Japanese, Hebrew and American Sign Language. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the park hired Valdes Zacky Associates, a Century City advertising 
and public relations firm, to improve its Latino attractions and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
"The Spanish language like any language has a unique culture and a unique 
sensitivity, and you have to take that into account," said Dolores Valdes 
Zacky, the firm's co-owner. "For the international mariachi festival, we did a 
talent search for la nueva voz ranchera (the new ranchera voice). There are 
many ranchera singers and their dream is to be accompanied by mariachis of top 
quality." 
</P>
<P>
Amateur singers performed with Mariachi Vargas from Mexico City, Los Camperos 
from Los Angeles and other well-known groups. The mariachi festival's five 
concerts drew 6,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Valdes Zacky said Latinos can be a boon to a theme park not only because of 
their numbers, but also because of their life style. 
</P>
<P>
"The Hispanics spend more money in general than the mainstream," she said. 
"They want to have a good time now with their families. If you go to their 
songs, they talk about today. They don't care so much about tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
As with the mariachi shows, the park used audience participation to draw 
customers to its Novela (short for telenovela) festival. Patrons acted in 
scenes with six soap opera stars. 
</P>
<P>
The novelas are immensely popular. On a recent Spanish-language tour of the 
park, a boy was chosen from the audience to play the part of Elliot in a 
re-enactment of a scene from the movie "E. T." Asked by the emcee to name his 
favorite screen character, the boy did not mention Elliot, E. T., Luke 
Skywalker or the like. 
</P>
<P>
"Rosa Salvaje," he said, naming a novela star. 
</P>
<P>
Tour guide Patricio Flores said Spanish-speaking visitors ask the same 
questions as 
</P>
<P>
heir English-speaking counterparts -- "How are special-effects produced," "What 
are stars like in person?" Some, however, react differently to the park's 
earthquake attraction. 
</P>
<P>
"I have seen people crying," he said. "You have people from El Salvador, from 
Nicaragua, where there were bad earthquakes. But I think it helps by teaching 
them to be calm. After they leave, they aren't so scared of earthquakes." 
</P>
<P>
Marc Medina, head of the Spanish-language tour program, said the guides he 
hires must be bilingual because English-speaking visitors often stop them to 
ask questions. Medina, who started as a guide three years ago, said the strong 
family orientation of Latinos is another reason the park is seeking them as 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a different type of group," he said. "Normally an English tour is two 
people, four people. These people, they come with everybody. There's 
grandmother and uncle, sometimes 20 people."

FILM FINANCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rani Josephine de Castille (Letters, Oct. 22) writes that she is producing a 
black-oriented family film but that potential distributors and financiers are 
urging she fill it with negative stereotyping. 
</P>
<P>
I have a suggestion: Forget the big-name companies and seek out smaller, more 
serious independent organizations that might be willing to back such an 
unconventional project. 
</P>
<P>
There is certainly a market -- millions of black moviegoers would find such 
films a dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
There are also plenty of individuals -- including this writer -- who have done, 
or are working on, similarly positive projects. 
</P>
<P>
Since Megabucks Hollywood has proven itself incapable of producing valid 
black-oriented entertainment without Cosby, Murphy or Hall, the obvious 
solution is to go to companies unbound by conventional restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
I have often talked with enterprising souls about starting black distribution 
organizations, and maybe even a black theater chain, but since that will never 
be, the above seems the most logical way to go.

EXPRESSING SOME ROQ-SOLID POSITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It doesn't take a genius to figure out why KROQ has been slipping in the 
ratings. Reeb acknowledges the deejays' talkiness, but he neglects to mention 
problems such as a skewed format that sounds like "New Wave Oldies" on the 
weekend and "talk radio" during the week. 
</P>
<P>
While in London recently, I heard some great music on the air and in the clubs 
-- the kind of music that used to find its way onto KROQ in its "hip" days. Of 
course, the present management would rather play the Rolling Stones than try 
something new. It is unfortunate that the accountants and time salesmen who 
make up most of L.A.'s radio station managements insist on copying each other.

Reeb speaks of wanting to maintain KROQ's "nutty, offbeat and unpredictable"

a contradiction in trying to research, format and market unpredictability? 
</P>
<P>
He then goes on to state that he fired deejay Dusty Street because she was a 
"renegade." Well, it was such deejays who made KROQ the nutty, offbeat and 
unpredictable station it once was. Obviously, there's no place for them in Mr. 
Reeb's new scheme of things.

RESTAURANT REVIEW: KAKTUS UNVEILS NEW MENU THAT MOVES TOWARD L.A.-MEX 
CLASSICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here's a trend that doesn't seem likely to go away: elegant Mexican restaurants 
where an enchilada isn't basically mass quantities of cheese and sour cream, 
and where margaritas come, if at all, in glasses distinctly smaller than your 
head. 
</P>
<P>
We needn't be talking about anything experimental and Southwestern. The food 
could be just neat and refined versions of the Mexican dishes we've been eating 
all these years: nothing regional, nothing mesquite-smoked or cooked in banana 
leaves, nothing wild. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing wild is sort of the style at Kaktus, which has been purveying neat and 
refined Mexican food to Beverly Hills since early last year. The whole style of 
the place is a little subdued. No neon, no mirrors, no murals -- hardly any 
decor at all, except for some geometric spots of turquoise, a Day of the Dead 
mask here and there and a tiny potted kaktus plant at every table. 
</P>
<P>
Still, things change even at Kaktus. It just got a new menu, which has moved a 
little bit away from the pan-nouvelle tendencies of L.A. restaurants. There's 
no more attempt to serve American Heart Assn. dishes, so far as I can tell. The 
items that seemed like compromises with California cuisine are gone, such as 
chicken in ground sweet pepper sauce. 
</P>
<P>
These are no great losses, at least gastronomically. On the other hand, the 
only tamale left is the tiny, unstuffed tamalito, a little pillow of sweet 
steamed corn pudding. The seafood cocktails seem to be gone, though there's 
still a solid ceviche generous with green olives. I do miss one dish, roasted 
fish served with a mixture of red chiles and fried garlic chips. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, much is the same. They still bring you a thin, dark green, very 
appetizing salsa in a pitted stone mortar. It smells largely of vinegar and 
cilantro, and with it comes crumbly white cheese and thick, home-style corn 
tortillas. Kaktus still uses no bean that is not a black bean, for instance in 
its frijoles refritos and its tostadas. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the black bean is the official bean of the '80s, as goat cheese is 
the official cheese, and here Kaktus is still marching with the crowd. In fact, 
it may be using more goat cheese than before, sometimes prompting one to wonder 
whether sharp, rank goat cheese should always be the queso of choice. Camarones 
Cancun -- bacon-wrapped grilled shrimp stuffed with goat cheese -- lead to such 
dark ruminations. 
</P>
<P>
So what have we got? Chewy sopes topped with potato and the restaurant's own 
chorizo, as well as beans. . . . Plump quesadillas made from small folded 
tortillas and excellent, subtle cheese. . . . A combo plate that includes these 
two plus ceviche, a couple of miniature tostadas, a tamalito and guacamole. . . 
. Tortilla soup, and a fresh-tasting chicken lime soup that itself has a couple 
of tortilla strips in it. 
</P>
<P>
Whoa, this looks new: pavo Azteca, essentially turkey scaloppine in a sweet 
dark mole sauce that tastes as if it has honey in it. This may not be what you 
call a showcase for the flavor of turkey, but the delicious sauce will use up 
many a tortilla. Chicken breast now comes in a snappy light chipotle sauce. Or 
so they call it; this red-orange sauce scarcely has any of the smoky flavor of 
a chipotle pepper. Some other things -- enchiladas, for instance -- get the 
same pleasant, neutral, slightly hot red-orange sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Pavo tequila somehow sounds like something from the old menu: duck breast in a 
molasses sauce (a little less sweet than it sounds) dashed with tequila. It's 
an oddly sensible thing to do to duck, though a bit of raw alcohol flavor does 
show up in the sauce. Serape, I'm sure, is from the old menu: a filet steak 
pounded about as thin as a tortilla, nearly covering the dinner plate. It's 
topped with a hash of fried onions with a couple of mild peppers mixed in, 
making this a surreal sort of steak smothered in onions. 
</P>
<P>
At dessert time, the rice pudding is gone, and the range of flans is down to 
one: a plain one with a nice resilient texture. The crepes with toasted almonds 
are still around, but no longer with any claim of chocolate in the caramel 
sauce. They're probably the best of the desserts, and in a crazy way the most 
Mexican in effect, the crepes turning soggy in the sauce as if in a sweet 
cousin of budin Azteca, the dish Americans turned into tamale pie. The other 
desserts are L.A. staples, such as a chocolate mousse like chocolate-candy 
filling served in slab form. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, things are still unfailingly neat and refined; the only trouble on 
this horizon seems to be the grilled zucchini slices, which sometimes get 
practically blackened. Kaktus has made its culinary direction quite clear, a 
sort of L.A.-Mex classicism. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: plato surtido (combination appetizer plate), $12.95; 
chicken lime soup, $4.50; pavo tequila, $18.75; crepes with toasted almonds, 
$5.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaktus, 400 N. Canon, Beverly Hills. (213) 271-1856. Open for lunch from 11:30 
a.m. to 3 p.m. and for appetizers only from 3 to 5:30 p.m. Monday through 
Saturday; for dinner from 5:30 to 10 p.m. Monday through Thursday, till 11 p.m. 
Friday and Saturday. Full bar. Valet and street parking. All major credit cards

MANTEL AS CENTERPIECE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A FIREPLACE, ONCE the home's primary source of heat, is used today mostly for 
decorative purposes. Sometimes it is grand enough to be the centerpiece of a 
room; sometimes it's just a subtle accent to a well-thought-out design. 
</P>
<P>
To fit a new design scheme, an old fireplace may need to be altered -- a task 
that is not as difficult as it may seem. According to Anthony Zografides, owner 
of Newport Mantel &amp; Panel Co. in Newport Beach, a custom-made wooden mantel 
can be "designed to fit the ambience of a house and built to order. We pick up 
where the contractors leave off, and do the finishing touches." 
</P>
<P>
When considering a new mantel, the first things you need to decide are exactly 
how much you want to replace and how much you want to spend. A relatively plain 
5-foot mantel shelf costs from $150 to $300; a full surround (shelf, skirt and 
legs) from $400 to $650. A hand-carved version can go for as much as $3,000. 
Most mantels are made from oak, alder or birch. 
</P>
<P>
Installing a wood mantelpiece is actually not as intimidating as it seems. 
Still, most homeowners opt for installation by a professional, usually adding 
$150 to $200 to the tab. Removing old mantels is a relatively simple job; they 
are attached by screws or nails. The new mantel attaches to a support board 
mounted on the wall studs or brick backing. 
</P>
<P>
Style is the next choice. "Today, people want plain mantels; 20 years ago they 
wanted extensive routing and detailing," says Don Goodenough of Long Beach. 
Zografides, as do most mantel retailers, agrees: "Most want pretty simple lines 
-- not Gothic, not heavy-traditional like back East, but more contemporary." 
And simple lines get simple treatment: Most contemporary mantels get either a 
light stain or a coat of paint. 
</P>
<P>
A caveat: One man's "custom-made" is another man's "factory prebuilt." In many 
shops, the customer chooses from a catalogue of models and styles that can be 
ordered from the manufacturer. The mantels are assembled from solid moldings; 
sometimes carvings are attached to the front of the mantel. Although they are 
built to order, they are not exactly one-of-a-kind models. 
</P>
<P>
 Mantels can be found at Newport Mantel &amp; Panel Co. in Newport Beach (mail 
order); Don Goodenough Custom Wood Mantels in Long Beach; Korth's Patio &amp; 
Fireside in Granada Hills; Mantel Magic in Carlsbad; The Fireplace Shop in 
Glendale; Arroyo Hardwoods in Pasadena; Mission Moulding in San Diego.

CHIPPENDALE CHAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM BURCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE GOLDEN AGE of English cabinetmaking and furniture design was the period 
from 1714 to 1830 -- generally called the Georgian period, after the four 
English kings who reigned during those years. However, it is really more 
important to know whether a piece was designed by Hepplewhite or Sheraton or 
Chippendale than whether it was made during the reign of, say, George III. 
Matters were far different in France, where furniture styles were named after 
reigning monarchs: Louis XIV, Louis XV, Louis XVI. If nothing else, this shows 
that wealth and taste were more the province of the British upper classes than 
of British royalty. Britain had its own rising class of minor nobility and 
wealthy merchants who determined trends in the decorative arts, and the English 
kings had little interest in such things. The richness of the period, both in 
England and in France, is extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the 18th-Century English designers and cabinetmakers, the one whose name 
is most familiar today is Thomas Chippendale. Born in Yorkshire in 1718, he was 
the son of a joiner. As a young man, he was apprenticed to a cabinetmakers' 
firm in London. Within a decade, he had his own shop, and it soon turned into 
one of the largest furniture-making businesses in that country. His work was 
renowned for its exquisitely carved decoration, cabriole legs and elaborate 
chair backs. He was famous for the exotic Oriental designs and lacquerwork that 
came to be called Chinese Chippendale. 
</P>
<P>
In 1754, he published a book, "The Gentleman and Cabinet-maker's Director." The 
first edition had 16 plates, along with many drawings of Chippendale's own 
designs for chairs and settees and for such imposing furniture as commodes, 
dressing tables, bookcases, library tables and breakfronts. His designs were by 
no means original, but the book served to bring his name before a wide public, 
and he became a celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
It is, however, misleading to think of Chippendale as the greatest of all 
18th-Century English cabinetmakers and furniture designers. His reputation was 
chiefly founded on one popular book, but the designs in it were for the most 
part derivative, and he personally was no more than an average craftsman. But 
he was a fine publicist and a man of great business acumen, the head of a large 
and successful firm known throughout the British Isles. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Chippendale chairs sold at auction these days are 19th-Century 
copies, and others are handsome (and expensive) examples made in the American 
Colonies, before and after 1776. Typical 18th-Century English Chippendale 
pieces are often found for good prices. In 1988, for example, you might have 
acquired eight Chippendale mahogany dining chairs with pierced ladder backs for 
$10,000; or 12 carved mahogany armchairs for $15,400. Per chair, prices are not 
excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for Chippendale chairs at Morey Palmer Associates, Museum Antiques in Los 
Angeles; Richard Gould Antiques in Santa Monica; Richard Yeakel in Laguna 
Beach; G.R. Durenberger in San Juan Capistrano, and Jay's Antiques in Pasadena. 
Reproductions can be found at Melrose House, Baker Knapp &amp; Tubbs, Panache, 
Charles Pollock Reproductions Inc., all in Los Angeles.

THE NBC STUDIO Tour is designed to demonstrate how a television program is 
created and how a show is broadcast. NBC has outfitted a mini-studio 
specifically for the tour and equipped it with a simulated control booth so 
that visitors have a chance to see themselves on television. Depending on the 
highly variable demand for studio space and taping schedules, the tour also 
stops at the wardrobe, set storage and prop departments, and possibly "The 
Tonight Show" set, KNBC News studio and the Skypath satellite broadcast system. 
The tour concludes at the Sound and Special Effects Center, where TV's great 
mysteries -- such as how faces change color and where all those weird noises 
come from -- are explained. 
</P>
<P>
Children are welcome on these regular tours, but NBC has designated November 
and May as Youth Months, with special children's tours oriented to the 
interests and comprehension level of elementary school students. The Youth 
Month tours visit the same locations as the regular tour, but guides tailor 
their descriptions to first- through sixth-graders. Each tour makes its own 
simulated TV production, with heroes, heroines, villains and production 
personnel recruited from members of the tour group. 
</P>
<P>
 Advance reservations are not required for groups of fewer than 20. The price, 
$6.50 for adults and $4.50 for children, includes peacock jacket patch during 
the month of November. There is no minimum group size for the tour, but 
children cannot take the tour unescorted. Picnic areas are available in Buena 
Vista Park, across from the studios. NBC Studios is located at 3000 W. Alameda 
Ave., Burbank; for information, telephone (818) 840-3537.

CLINIC SEES AN AIDS 'SECOND WAVE'; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: THE FUTURE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE IS LIKELY TO BE AMONG MOSTLY 
HETEROSEXUAL IV DRUG USERS, THEIR SEXUAL PARTNERS AND THEIR CHILDREN, EXPERTS 
SAY.

<P>
An unusual public-private clinic that offers early treatment of HIV-infected 
individuals is bracing for "the second wave" of AIDS -- in the heterosexual 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, AIDS victims have been mostly homosexuals. Some heterosexuals have 
caught the virus from intravenous drug needles, or from transfusions of blood. 
But they are in the minority. 
</P>
<P>
The result of this circumstance, said Susan Rooney, administrator of the 
clinic, "is an 'it can't happen here' factor in the general public. Whole 
communities don't seem to accept the risks." 
</P>
<P>
Among blacks, for example, human immunodeficiency virus infections are about 
double the expected rate. 
</P>
<P>
But doctors now think that "the second wave will come through IV drug users, 
who are largely heterosexual, to women and children," Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is much easier for a male to transmit the HIV to a female -- four or five 
times more likely -- than vice versa. We don't know why," she added. 
</P>
<P>
"And from the woman, there is about a 50-50 chance of transmission of the HIV 
to the unborn child," who may live two, three or four years. 
</P>
<P>
"A few years ago, nobody expected AIDS to go into the heterosexual population. 
In other parts of the world, especially Africa, AIDS is not a gay problem. It 
is spread throughout the population." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, it is possible for individuals to be carrying HIV for five years and 
not even know it. Perhaps even 10 years, but it is unlikely that the symptoms 
wouldn't have shown up by then. 
</P>
<P>
This "window" between the contracting of the virus and the illness of AIDS is 
the business of the clinic that Rooney administers, the regional Center for 
AIDS Research, Education and Services, or CARES, in mid-town Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
About four years ago, death from AIDS came one or two years after diagnosis. 
But now, potential victims are volunteering for testing and doctors are 
learning to treat AIDS as a chronic disease like other chronic diseases. 
</P>
<P>
"They are getting to be more sophisticated. Now you hear predictions of seven 
to 10 years from early diagnosis to getting sick," Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
"Changes have been incredibly fast so far. To me, the whole face of the disease 
is changing," she added, mentioning the drug AZT and "other drugs on the 
horizon." 
</P>
<P>
CARES opened in May after a group of hospital administrators -- usually 
competitors -- discussed the potential burden of the AIDS epidemic on all of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
A task force of hospital administrators and physicians decided on a separate 
clinic specializing in early detection, treatment, education, psychological 
counseling and something called "behavior change support" for asymptomatic 
HIV-positive persons, on an outpatient basis. 
</P>
<P>
Physicians could meet their AIDS patients at the clinic. Rooney said there was 
early concern about AIDS victims frightening other patients in a doctor's 
waiting room, but that has changed. Most physicians now see their AIDS patients 
in their own offices. 
</P>
<P>
Initial funding included $100,000 from 11 Sacramento-area hospitals, $75,000 
from the Sierra Foundation, and a $156,165 state subcontract making CARES one 
of eight state AIDS Prevention and Follow-Up Centers, serving Amador, El 
Dorado, Nevada, Placer, Sacramento, Sutter, Yolo and Yuba counties. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Foundation is a Northern California philanthropic organization that 
has dedicated $3 million to the fight against AIDS in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
In the first 90 days there were about 100 clients, which is not many for the 
3,200-square foot facility. But more are showing up. There were about 250 
visits in August. There is a part-time physician, Dr. Neil Flynn of UC Davis 
Medical Center in Sacramento, and a physician's assistant, among other 
specialists. 
</P>
<P>
With regard to "behavior change support," a recent Gallup Poll showed that 
although one-fourth of all Californians are fearful of contracting AIDS, only 
15% say they have changed their behavior as a result. Of those who changed, 49% 
said they had limited the number of sex partners, and 5% said they had 
abandoned sex altogether. 
</P>
<P>
But only 9% of those polled said they now use condoms in response to the AIDS 
risks. 
</P>
<P>
It appears to be the other way around at CARES. Rooney said the HIV-infected 
clients tell the health education specialist that they have indeed changed 
their behavior. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, they all volunteered for testing, which Rooney recommends for 
all members of the high-risk groups: homosexuals, heterosexuals with multiple 
sex partners, and IV drug users. 
</P>
<P>
Testing can be obtained on a confidential basis at any "anonymous test site," 
of which there are six or seven in the Sacramento area. They may be found under 
"Health" in the government pages of the telephone directory. Private physicians 
and blood banks also test for HIV. 
</P>
<P>
But CARES has no way of reaching IV users, the anticipated spreaders of "the 
second wave," who often pass unclean needles among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney said, "We don't deal with drug addiction. The least they could do is 
clean up their works. Use bleach. It kills the virus. We say if you can't stop 
using IV drugs, then clean up your works."

SKIN CANCER RATES APPEAR TO BE WANING, STUDY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After decades of soaring rates of skin cancer -- largely because of suntanning 
-- Americans finally may be wising up to the dangers of the bronzed look, a 
medical researcher says. 
</P>
<P>
Rates of malignant melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer, appeared to 
start leveling off in 1988, after 27 years of steep rises, said Dr. Andrew 
Glass of Kaiser Permanente's Center for Health Research in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take some more time to follow that along," Glass said in a 
recent interview. But early figures from the National Cancer Institute in 
Bethesda, Md., appear to indicate a similar leveling off, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Glass' remarks came after he reported on long-term tracking of 300,000 members 
of the Kaiser Permanente prepaid health plan in the Portland, Ore., and 
Vancouver, Wash., areas. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers found that from 1960 to 1987, annual cases of a type of skin cancer 
called squamous cell carcinoma increased 2.6 times in men and 3.1 times in 
women. 
</P>
<P>
Squamous cell carcinoma is one of the most common skin cancers, occurring in 
thousands of people each year. Usually starting as a scaly patch on the lip, 
ear or hand, it grows, spreads and even causes death if untreated. 
</P>
<P>
"Squamous cell skin cancer clearly seems to be related to skin exposure -- it 
is more common among fair-skinned individuals, especially those with frequent 
or long-term exposure to sunlight," said a report by Glass and Dr. Robert N. 
Hoover of the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Their findings represent the first systematic report over time of squamous cell 
skin cancer, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers also looked at melanoma and found its incidence rose 3.5-fold 
and 4.6-fold among men and women, respectively, during the same 27-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Greater exposure to sunlight is only one of many factors believed to have 
contributed to the increased rates of melanoma, the researchers said in their 
report in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
But the occurrence of melanomas on the body's trunk rose much faster than 
cancers involving the head and neck or the extremities, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
"These observations are consistent with the impression that the rising 
incidence of both malignancies may be attributable to increased voluntary 
exposure to the sun," the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
Malignant melanoma, which often starts in an existing mole that becomes 
enlarged, is the kind of cancer most likely to spread and kill. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers found 2,453 cases of invasive skin cancers among members of the 
health plan. 
</P>
<P>
The American Cancer Society has estimated that half of all people who live to 
age 65 will have skin cancer at some point in their lives and predicted that 
malignant melanoma will kill 6,000 people this year. 
</P>
<P>
"As individuals and as a society, it is only prudent to take precautions to 
save our skins," said an editorial in the journal by Dr. Martin A. Weinstock of 
Brown University in Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
He called for preservation of the Earth's ozone layer, which blocks harmful 
ultraviolet radiation, and early detection and treatment of skin cancers, as 
well as increased public awareness and use of sunscreens.

NIGHTS CAN TURN TO TERROR FOR CHILDREN SUFFERING FROM SLEEP DISTURBANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SALLY SQUIRES, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Suddenly and with no warning, a peacefully sleeping child jumps out of bed with 
a blood-curdling scream. No amount of comforting helps to quell the terror. And 
then just as quickly, the child is silent again and quietly goes back to sleep, 
often never even recalling the episode the next day. 
</P>
<P>
A psychotic attack? No. A bad dream? Not exactly. It's a night terror, one of 
the many sleep disturbances known to afflict most children and adolescents at 
some time during their lives. Children who experience night terrors are 
suspended in an altered state of consciousness between deep sleep and dream 
sleep. Unlike nightmares, which may be recalled in minute detail, youngsters 
who suffer night terrors often have no recollection of the event. 
</P>
<P>
Night terrors are one of a group of sleep disturbances known as parasomnias. 
These disturbances range from the benign sleep talking to bruxism (teeth 
grinding), sleep walking and the most extreme -- night terrors. 
</P>
<P>
But despite their sometimes bizarre appearance, sleep problems are a common 
event of childhood. For many youngsters, they are a kind of rite of passage as 
a child moves from one developmental brain stage to another. 
</P>
<P>
"Thirty to 40% of all children have a parasomnia attack once or twice during 
childhood," said Thomas Anders, a physician who directs the division of child 
and adolescent psychiatry at Brown University Medical School in Providence, 
R.I. "Less than 1% of children have it as a serious recurrent problem that 
requires major attention." 
</P>
<P>
But for parents who encounter their children in this altered state of 
consciousness, the experience can be very scary. "It's as though your child is 
seeing a dinosaur, as though he is being devoured by animals," said David 
Dinges, a biological psychologist who does sleep research at the University of 
Pennsylvania's unit for experimental psychiatry. "They jump out of bed, pulling 
and screaming and slamming things down. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very frightening, even to me. I remember when my son, Justin, was 4 or 5 
and had a night terror. I remember vividly trying to arouse him, and I couldn't 
get him to wake up. I remember feeling panic." 
</P>
<P>
Sleep disturbances can begin as early as the first year of life. Nightlong 
video camera studies of babies show that infants sleep for about three to four 
hours, then wake up. 
</P>
<P>
Some babies are particularly good at putting themselves back to sleep early on 
in life -- a trait that leaves their parents mistakenly thinking that they have 
slept through the night. Other infants wake and cry for comfort or for food and 
do not go back to sleep until they have attention from their parents. It is not 
until the end of the first year of life that most babies are able to sleep six 
to seven hours before waking. 
</P>
<P>
But for about 20% of youngsters, night wakenings are a regular occurrence that 
continue through the first two years of life, said William Sonis, director of 
the mood, sleep and seasonality program at the Philadelphia Child Guidance 
Clinic. By age 2 to 3, about 11% to 14% of children still wake up regularly, 
and by age 4, about 8% of parents report that their youngsters still do not 
sleep regularly all night. 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters who do not sleep through the night either experience one of the 
parasomnias or they have nightmares. Although it can sometimes be difficult for 
parents to tell the difference between the two, the general rule of thumb is 
that night terrors occur in the early part of the night, within the first two 
to three hours of sleep. Nightmares, on the other hand, happen most often 
during the early morning hours during the part of sleep known as rapid eye 
movement (REM) sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Children are more vulnerable to all sorts of sleep disturbances because they 
fall more quickly into deep, non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep than do 
adults. During non-REM sleep, the brain rests and restores itself. 
</P>
<P>
REM sleep, by comparison, enables the brain to dream. During REM, muscles are 
paralyzed, the eyes may twitch rapidly and the heart rate can fluctuate 
greatly. Four to six times each night, the brain normally cycles between 
non-REM and REM sleep. 
</P>
<P>
For children who experience frequent sleep disturbances, it appears that this 
switching mechanism "is immature and slower to develop," said Brown 
University's Anders. 
</P>
<P>
Boys are three to four times more afflicted with night terrors than girls 
although researchers do not yet know why. And there is some suggestion that 
night terrors "seem to run in families," Anders said. 
</P>
<P>
To understand a night terror, imagine having a few shots of alcohol before 
going to bed. Then shortly after you have drifted off to sleep, there is a 
sudden, very loud horn outside your bedroom that wakes you up and leaves you 
very disoriented. "You jump up, run around the room in a very crazy manner and 
just aren't able to get clear-headed," said Richard Ferber, a physician and 
director of the Center for Pediatric Sleep Disorders at Children's Hospital in 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Parasomnias of all types also can be triggered by loud sounds that may occur 
just after a youngster has drifted into deep sleep. University of 
Pennsylvania's Dinges said that when he accidentally drops a cup into the sink 
after midnight, he frequently hears one of his sons begin talking in his sleep 
for a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
In younger children, between the ages of 1 and 3, parasomnias often begin 
gradually with whining and whimpering during sleep. "They can last about 15 to 
45 minutes," Ferber said. Afterward, the child usually just relaxes, yawns and 
gently goes back to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
But for older children and adolescents, these sleep disturbances often start 
with a terrifying shriek. Children may sit up in bed screaming. Or they can 
"run around the room wildly," Ferber said. In extreme cases, some may be so 
frightened that they can injure themselves or others. Two teen-age boys that 
Ferber treated on separate occasions were so frightened during night terrors 
that they hurled themselves through second-story windows. Both teens survived. 
</P>
<P>
But most children who experience the gamut of parasomnias, from sleep walking 
to night terrors, never remember the event the next day. If they are awakened 
by those around them during the attack, night terror sufferers say that they 
feel very frightened but cannot explain why. Their hearts race, and they show 
all the physiological symptoms of being scared, but unlike those who have had a 
nightmare, they simply cannot articulate what has frightened them. 
</P>
<P>
This same type of disorientation has been simulated in experimental sleep 
studies by keeping people awake for several days, then allowing them to fall 
asleep for a few minutes. Being sleep deprived, they quickly go into non-REM 
sleep, but when they are awakened by researchers about 20 minutes later, they 
show all the signs of a night terror. 
</P>
<P>
For most children, night terrors seem to abate by adolescence. Whatever has 
been immature in the brain usually matures and functions well in 95% of teens, 
making night terrors, by the age of puberty, a relatively infrequent 
occurrence. A small percentage of cases -- perhaps just 1% -- continue into 
adulthood. When they do, "it's worth going to a neurologist and getting an EEG 
(electro-encephalogram)," Anders said, since night terrors in adults may 
pinpoint some kind of seizure disorder. "Sometimes, anticonvulsant medication 
can make them go away," he said.

ROBOT 'N-RAY' TO RESCUE; 
</P>
<P>
AIR FORCE NEUTRON GUN MAY PROBE JETLINER INNARDS FOR CORROSION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a concrete fortress, a huge military robot with a neutron ray gun in its 
claw is looking through metal like Superman to spot deadly corrosion in fighter 
jets. Its creators say it could do the same for commercial airliners. 
</P>
<P>
The potential of the unique new machine at McClellan Air Force Base has added a 
major element to the federal government's search for ways to make commercial 
air travel safer after a series of problems with aging jetliners. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration has commissioned a study on high-technology 
structural testing methods that will focus in part on whether versions of the 
$7.3-million robot and hangar at McClellan would be practical for use on 
airliners. 
</P>
<P>
The report on the corrosion-detection system took on greater significance with 
word the government is preparing orders that will force airlines to regularly 
strip the interiors of aging jetliner fuselages, which have failed in some 
cases, for corrosion inspections. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, airline industry representatives said there are major drawbacks 
to the system. But engineers who created the machine said it could be applied 
to the private sector and would fill a gap in airline testing. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Froom, who designed the device, which is the first neutron-ray or "N-ray" 
system in the world to move and scrutinize an intact aircraft, said he hopes 
airlines will adopt the technology. 
</P>
<P>
There's no reason for structural failures that have hit aging airliners, Froom 
said. "You've got to find that Achilles heel. That's what this system is good 
at." 
</P>
<P>
Private engineers who build the machine said larger versions of the system 
could be designed to scan entire airliners within hours, ending the 
time-consuming process of dismantling and visually inspecting for corrosion. 
</P>
<P>
Airline industry representatives, however, said there would be 
multimillion-dollar costs to each of the competing airlines. Practical 
complications include coping with the radiation it gives off and adapting the 
machinery so that it could quickly scan airliner fuselages, they added. 
</P>
<P>
Air Transport Assn. spokesman Dave Lotterer said that although airlines rely 
heavily on visual checks, X-rays, electrical currents and sound are being used 
more frequently to test portions of planes. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer groups, which criticize the efforts as outdated and inadequate, said 
they want to make sure the controversy over N-ray centers on the effectiveness 
of the device rather than solely on cost. 
</P>
<P>
"Any device that detects . . . evils that come with aging aircraft is certainly 
desirable to have available," said Richard Livingston of the International 
Airline Passengers Assn. "If it reveals corrosion in the places in which 
traditionally it's been hard to find, then what price safety? It's hard to 
imagine anything costing too much to safeguard human life." 
</P>
<P>
Experts said corrosion can weaken essential aircraft components or the fuselage 
itself, causing major damage or possible crashes. 
</P>
<P>
Recent airline accidents have been linked largely to metal fatigue and 
government directives have focused on that problem, but the latest federal 
orders are expected to require carriers to set up their own anti-corrosion 
programs with periodic inspections on various sections of each airliner. 
</P>
<P>
Corrosion is more closely related than metal fatigue to age, the care the 
airliner is given, the environment in which it is flown, and conditions within 
the aircraft. Frequent coffee spills in the galley, for example, can accelerate 
corrosion. 
</P>
<P>
The corrosion-detector at McClellan shoots neutrons, a particle in atoms, 
through an aircraft to a receiver on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
Neutrons penetrate metal but are absorbed by the hydrogen in the dust produced 
by corrosion. The neutron flow is translated into a "real time" television 
image -- one that can be watched live and recorded. 
</P>
<P>
The scanner is held by a flexible arm that hangs from a moving overhead beam in 
a hangar with concrete walls thick enough to contain errant low-level 
radiation. The machine is operated from a remote-control center. 
</P>
<P>
N-ray operators are programming the system to automatically scan jets, 
including the F-111 fighter-bomber, the largest in the Air Force. The facility, 
just big enough to take in an F-111, is scheduled to be in regular operation by 
mid-1990. 
</P>
<P>
Adjacent facilities use X-rays, a longtime tool that is better at revealing 
structural damage such as cracks but less efficient at showing problems such as 
corrosion. 
</P>
<P>
"With X-rays you can't find the cancer. With N-rays you can, and when you find 
problems in the early stages, you go in, doctor it up and extend the life of 
the plane," Froom said. 
</P>
<P>
The X-ray facilities include a unit that, for the first time, will scan intact 
aircraft and provide a television image rather than just taking pictures that 
must be developed. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, by March, the Air Force will be able to inspect flawed parts with 
a separate, stationary N-ray system at McClellan powered by a small, 1-megawatt 
reactor. 
</P>
<P>
Together the systems, known as "non-destructive inspection" devices because 
they check planes and components intact, will cost $28.7 million. But Air Force 
officials say they should pay for themselves in reduced maintenance costs in up 
to two years. 
</P>
<P>
The N-ray, for example, can do in 16 hours what human inspectors would need 
several months to do if they had to dismantle the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the FAA, which oversees commercial air transportation, 
awarded a New Jersey-based research firm, Galaxy Scientific Corp., a 
$47-million contract to study the N-ray and other inspection techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeking information for commercial application," said Galaxy 
Scientific's vice president, Bruce McCoy, who agreed with those who say the 
technology is excellent at detecting corrosion and could be used on airliners. 
</P>
<P>
"But you can see where we're in the middle, trying to bring technology through 
the gap" between expensive testing technologies and financially competitive 
airlines, he said. 
</P>
<P>
From the military's viewpoint, the expense of the N-ray is less than that of 
losing one aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The firm that built the N-ray robotics, Cimcorp Robotic Systems of St. Paul, 
Minn., said it could construct a machine big enough to scan the largest 
commercial airliner for roughly $30 million, not including the 
radiation-shielded building itself. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at that cost against the cost of one airliner and that number (for 
N-ray) becomes small again," said Ken Bucher of Cimcorp. A commercial jetliner 
can cost more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Industry representatives said N-ray appears impractical for several reasons, 
with cost near the top of the list. The military depends on tax revenue, while 
the profit-seeking airlines compete with one another, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Airlines, unlike the Air Force, would each have to own a facility and perhaps 
several of them so they were handy, industry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Gamble, a Boeing Co. spokesman, when pressed for the industry's other 
complaints about N-ray, said: "I'm not going to give 10 reasons why we don't 
want to use it. It's a technical question." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the technical hitches cited by the industry are discounted by engineers 
who created McClellan's N-ray. 
</P>
<P>
Industry representatives said the materials in airliners are so different from 
jet fighters that N-ray would not be as effective as it is for the military, 
but N-ray engineers reject the objection as unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials noted that the machine does not swiftly scan fuselages now. 
Instead film is placed inside and exposed. But N-ray engineers said a receiving 
device could be designed to track inside an airliner's passenger compartment, 
providing the "real time" scan that already is possible on areas such as wings. 
</P>
<P>
It would be difficult for the private sector, which has to deal with workers' 
unions, to manage a plant that involves radiation, according to the industry. 
But N-ray engineers said they use low-level radiation that is not difficult to 
manage. 
</P>
<P>
Although N-ray proponents believe airlines should adopt the technology, they 
are skeptical that will happen anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
Froom believes it would take government pressure to force the airlines to 
widely employ N-ray: "The point of it is, the FAA's got to drive them to it."

Four men who went down a well dating back to the Phoenician period in the hope 
of finding treasure suffocated and died, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said the four, who died last week, were among a group of 10 
amateurs who discovered the well in this southern port city, which was a major 
Phoenician trading center more than 3,000 years before Christ. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the well dated back to that period. 
</P>
<P>
The six other people emerged safely from the 18-foot-deep well, the spokesman 
said.

TRAGIC LOSS OF 5 YOUNG MEN TURNED THEIR FAMILIES INTO JOB-SAFETY ACTIVISTS

<P>
When tragedy tore Linda Link's life apart, she struggled with anguish, then 
anger. Finally, she turned her emotions into action. 
</P>
<P>
She took up the fight for worker safety. It is little solace for the loss of 
her son, Jeff, who died in an accident on the job, but she is devoted to the 
cause. So are her comrades who share her sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
One is Edna Freeze. Her son, Bill, died trying to save Jeff. 
</P>
<P>
And there is Bob Hensinger. His son, Larry, was also killed in the rescue 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
And Sue Irish's son, Barney, died when he rushed to help the others. 
</P>
<P>
And Brenda Fogle. Her son, Craig, the last man to come to the others' aid, also 
died. After two days in a coma, his respirator was turned off. 
</P>
<P>
Five families buried sons, their futures unfulfilled. Now, more than a year 
after the young men -- ages 19 to 29 -- succumbed to toxic fumes at Bastian 
Plating Co., their parents are writing letters, calling lawmakers, rallying -- 
and pleading, "Never again." 
</P>
<P>
"If we can do any good, it gives us the satisfaction to know that the boys 
didn't die in vain," Link said. "We can't bring them back, but in their name, 
we can maybe help make it so these things don't happen ever again. And it gives 
us something to think about other than the tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
"You're hoping you'll change things . . . you'll get people to listen," 
Hensinger said. "It's always worth a try. Only a fool sits back and does 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
The families' demands are modest. No sweeping changes. Just a little more 
caution and a lot more accountability from employers. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if one factory would be really safe, that would make us feel good," 
Freeze said. 
</P>
<P>
The campaigners were brought together by the June 28, 1988, tragedy at Bastian, 
where Jeff was overcome by hydrogen cyanide fumes while cleaning a holding 
tank. Bill, a plant worker for only four weeks, and Larry, climbed in to help, 
investigators were told. 
</P>
<P>
Barney, once Bill's schoolmate, valiantly tried to save them, according to 
accounts. Then Craig, the last rescuer, slid down the side of the tank and 
struck his head, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
The workers did not know there was zinc cyanide residue in the tank, said David 
Bear of the Indiana Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Muriatic 
acid, a dilute form of hydrochloric acid, was the cleaning agent, he said, and 
the mixture produced the toxic gas. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana OSHA fined Bastian $41,700, claiming that it had not provided adequate 
training, respirators or rescue equipment -- such as a lifeline for pulling the 
workers out of the tank. It also had not conducted air tests in the tank before 
anyone entered it. 
</P>
<P>
Bastian has contested the "knowing" violations and paid the remainder of fines 
that total $1,700. It has refused to comment since it released a statement 
shortly after the accident saying: "We are sorry that it took a tragedy of 
these proportions to focus attention on the issue of industrial safety." 
</P>
<P>
The parents say they knew their sons' job could be hazardous; they came home 
with burns on their arms and legs. Larry once told his ex-wife, " 'If I don't 
get out, the job's going to kill me,' " his father said. "I took it as a figure 
of speech." 
</P>
<P>
After the accident, the families said Bastian made a terrible situation worse 
by not telling them how it had happened. 
</P>
<P>
"We need answers," Irish said. "A lot of them." 
</P>
<P>
A worker safety watchdog group asked DeKalb County Prosecutor Monte Brown to 
convene a grand jury probe of the accident, but he refused to comment pending a 
report from the state Department of Environmental Management. 
</P>
<P>
"Five guys went to work and expected to return home," said Bill Groth, a leader 
of the watchdog group. "They didn't. Something went drastically wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Their families are frustrated, he added. "They want to know why there was a 
delay in calling the ambulances. . . . They can't find out what happened to 
their sons." 
</P>
<P>
With Groth's guidance, the families began meeting with consumer groups, talking 
with reporters and lobbying for stronger OSHA enforcement, changes in worker 
compensation laws and measures to allow injured employees to sue employers who 
remove cautionary warnings or safety devices from machines. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good catharsis for them," Groth said. "We've encouraged them to channel 
emotions in a positive way, through political action." 
</P>
<P>
They also consulted a lawyer, Mike Kendall, about legal action, but with few 
exceptions, workers' compensation is the exclusive remedy for on-the-job 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Kendall said the families have been "radicalized" by the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they have learned a hard lesson in civics, discovering that 
government moves slowly and its agencies are hamstrung by rules, laws and 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought OSHA inspected every place every year," Freeze said. "They 
don't have the money or the inspectors to do everything. . . . It's going to 
have to be the employer that's going to have to look out for his employees." 
</P>
<P>
"You get so many slaps in the face, all the things you find out," Link said. 
</P>
<P>
Workers' compensation, for one. 
</P>
<P>
Because Jeff was single, "all we got was $2,000 for funeral expenses," Link 
said. "They don't give you any compensation . . . for the love you lost . . . 
not that any amount of money can bring him back." 
</P>
<P>
Together, the families took flowers to the graves on the first anniversary of 
the accident. It helped, but anger remains. 
</P>
<P>
"They had their whole lives ahead of them. None of them were married," Fogle 
said. "You have so many hopes and dreams for your children. You never think 
you're going to have to bury your children."

INDONESIANS CLEAVE TO CLOVE CIGARETTES

KUDUS, Indonesia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A young woman uses scissors to snip the tobacco strands at either end of the 
cigarette while her partner rolls another with frenetic speed. 
</P>
<P>
The partner puts clove-spiked tobacco on a small sheet of cloth and deftly 
wraps it in a pre-glued piece of paper. 
</P>
<P>
It's midday. Hot. The air thick with the smell of cloves. 
</P>
<P>
Working since five in the morning, the pair should be on about their 6,000th 
cigarette of the day for Indonesia's PT Djarum company. 
</P>
<P>
"Hand rollers are paid by the number they produce," said staff manager 
Sugiyanto Utomo, explaining the speed at which the women work. 
</P>
<P>
Sweat dripping from his forehead, he gestured around the cavernous shed where 
500 women, mostly young farmers' wives, sit at long benches rolling the pungent 
clove cigarettes, a favorite Indonesian indulgence, at one of the largest such 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
The clove cigarette industry is so labor intensive, and much of heavily 
populated central Java so poor, that the government will not let makers abandon 
hand-rolled cigarettes completely. 
</P>
<P>
A large proportion of Djarum's 27,000 workers still roll and pack the clove 
cigarettes, or kretek, by hand. 
</P>
<P>
"The average worker gets at least 3,500 rupiah (about $2) a day producing about 
4,000 cigarettes," Sugiyanto said, stressing that most produce and earn much 
more. 
</P>
<P>
That, coupled with an annual bonus, gives the women far more than the average 
Indonesian income of $500 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Cloves were one of the spices that enticed European merchants and colonizers to 
the tropical islands of Indonesia in search of fabulous wealth and ways to 
enliven European dinner tables. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred years later, the little clove flower finds its most ardent fan 
in Indonesian smokers, who puff well over 100 billion kretek cigarettes a year. 
</P>
<P>
The country grows and exports some of the world's finest tobacco. But most 
Indonesian smokers, whether cabinet members or peasants, prefer cigarettes 
heavily laced with the dark brown, woody spice. 
</P>
<P>
Kretek, a Javanese onomatopoeia, describes the crackle and spitting of burning 
cloves, and it was at Kudus, a smallish town in central Java, that the kretek 
was invented. 
</P>
<P>
A little over 100 years ago, Kudus asthma sufferer Haji Jamahri tried cloves as 
a cure. 
</P>
<P>
From rubbing clove oil on his chest he progressed to chewing cloves, and 
finally the most effective method, mixing ground cloves with pipe tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
The kretek was born. 
</P>
<P>
Although no manufacturer now actively promotes this aspect of their product, 
kretek packets do not carry any health warning. Indonesia does not have an 
anti-smoking lobby. 
</P>
<P>
PT Djarum, spawned by Haji Jamahri's discovery, is the biggest -- or second 
biggest, depending on who's talking -- producer of kretek in the country. It 
tussles for the top spot with PT Gudang Garam, located farther east in Java. 
</P>
<P>
Kretek sales raised nearly $600 million in duty for the government last year 
from the 10 major manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
The firms prefer not to open their books to public scrutiny, but their owners, 
mostly ethnic Chinese families, are reputed to be among Indonesia's wealthiest. 
</P>
<P>
The kretek, and increasingly the machine-rolled version considered more 
sophisticated, is fast taking over from ordinary tobacco. In eight years, 
market share for ordinary tobacco has plunged from 40% to just over 10%. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to say what the difference is," one addict said. "Once I tried 
foreign cigarettes, but kretek is still the best." 
</P>
<P>
Most Indonesians seem to feel much the same. As the Djarum company handbook 
says, "Cigarettes must be able to deliver maximum ecstasy and peace of mind."

LAWYER HELPS SPOUSES DRIVEN TO DIVORCE 
</P>

Lawyer Robert Nordyke says only one person has objected to his office's 
drive-through divorce window: his mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never gotten a negative comment, except from my mother," Nordyke said. 
"She wanted me to be a corporate lawyer. She was embarrassed by it." 
</P>
<P>
But most people have been intrigued or charmed or amused by the window, which 
Nordyke opened almost three years ago when he moved into his present office. 
</P>
<P>
"Right off the bat a couple of people came in and were interviewed for divorces 
in it," Nordyke said. "They were real simple cases -- uncontested, no major 
assets. One lady drove up in her pickup." 
</P>
<P>
Since then the window has mainly been used to pick up or drop off legal papers, 
but it remains a source of fascination. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people's reaction is: 'Are you serious?' " Nordyke said. But once people 
get used to the idea, he said, they generally think it's an interesting 
promotion. 
</P>
<P>
"The benefit has been that I'm noticed," said Nordyke, who has practiced law in 
Oregon's capital city since 1970. "I've been in Salem all my life, but that has 
gotten me more notice than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
He said it also helps to relax his clients, most of whom are seeking a divorce 
or bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for a drive-up legal window occurred to Nordyke years ago, when he 
concluded that the increasing number of simple divorce cases and America's 
"fast-paced society" might make the plan viable. 
</P>
<P>
When office space in a former bank building opened up in 1986, Nordyke saw his 
chance, and rented the end of the building where the bank's drive-up window had 
been located. Except for hanging up a sign, little was required to transform 
the window from a place where people could get some money to one where they 
could lose a spouse. 
</P>
<P>
Today the window still has a buzzer to warn of arriving customers and the 
bank's old mechanical drawer that can transfer things to people waiting in a 
car. About the only changes are the presence of the office stereo system and 
Nordyke's golf balls and putter, used for occasional practice sessions. 
</P>
<P>
But after a flurry of publicity and a few early cases when the window first 
opened, people quickly stopped using it for extensive legal work. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people want to conduct intimate business through a drive-up 
divorce window," Nordyke said. 
</P>
<P>
But people do stop to ask simple questions, sometimes deciding to park their 
cars and go inside for a consultation. 
</P>
<P>
Nordyke said his fellow lawyers have never complained about the window, 
although he admitted that some are probably less than thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have to believe that some of them think that's tacky and beneath a 
lawyer, but some of those same lawyers still wear white shirts to work 
everyday," said Nordyke, who looked very unlawyer-like in a purple shirt and 
purple tie. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever tackiness the window might have is hopefully offset by the deluxe Art 
Deco decor inside," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Nordyke's office of glass bricks and fashionable furniture looks more 
like the set of "Miami Vice" than "L.A. Law." Behind his desk sits a 1925 Deco 
clock that includes a sculpture of a reclining, semi-nude woman holding a bow. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a divorce lawyer you can get away with being a little more flamboyant," 
Nordyke said. 
</P>
<P>
But are there any other lawyers flamboyant enough to have opened a drive-up 
divorce window? 
</P>
<P>
"Not in the known universe, I hope," Nordyke said. "Everybody wants to be 
unique for something."

SUPREMACIST PILLAR STIRS RACIAL TENSION

<P>
An attempt to quietly remove a nearly century-old stone monument honoring white 
supremacists has sparked racial tensions and threatens federal funds for a 
construction project, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the 20-foot obelisk must be removed because of road 
construction and because of commercial development of the area near the 
monument. 
</P>
<P>
"They're lying in their teeth," said Wayne Ponthieux of Boh Brothers 
Construction Co. Inc., foreman of the crew doing the street work. "I can work 
all around that monument. That monument does not have to be touched." 
</P>
<P>
None of the street work comes closer than 15 feet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Streets Director Betty Jo Everett, who said that the move was forced by road 
work, said later last week that electrical and traffic engineers told her the 
obelisk might be damaged by the work. 
</P>
<P>
The monument also could block the view of traffic signals that will be 
installed after the road work is done, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a safety hazard in the way that we have redesigned the 
intersection," said Everett. "When uses change over the years, you have to make 
decisions for the safety of the public, both pedestrians and drivers." 
</P>
<P>
Erected in 1891, the monument bears the names of 16 people, all members of the 
White League, who died in a brief, bloody battle in 1874 between the white 
supremacist group and the Reconstruction government. 
</P>
<P>
An inscription added in 1932 says: "United States troops took over the state 
government and reinstated the usurpers but the national election in November 
1876 recognized white supremacy and gave us our state." 
</P>
<P>
It's the second time in eight years that an official in this predominantly 
black city has tried to remove the pointed pillar officially called the Liberty 
Place Monument. 
</P>
<P>
Everett said she gave the order to remove the monument without consulting Mayor 
Sidney Barthelemy, who is running for reelection in February, 1990. Barthelemy 
has not publicly commented on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
While the road work continues, the order to remove the obelisk was put on hold 
until officials decide where it should go and whether moving it would violate 
federal law. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Montecino, an aide to state representative and former Ku Klux Klan leader 
David Duke, said moving the obelisk could mean the construction project will 
lose federal funds since it could be a candidate for the National Register of 
Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
Although the monument isn't yet on the National Register, federal rules require 
preservation officials be consulted before work starts at a site that might 
qualify for the register, said Leslie P. Tassin, Louisiana's historic 
preservation officer. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, blacks demanded removal of the monument, which had long been and 
continues to be a rallying point for white supremacists. Their demands were 
rejected, but a plaque repudiating the references to white supremacy was added 
in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Former Mayor Dutch Morial, the city's first black mayor, advertised in 1981 for 
a firm to remove the monument from the center of a tiny traffic circle. The 
City Council said the obelisk had to stay, but agreed to let the 1932 
inscriptions be removed. 
</P>
<P>
They were filled in, whitewashed over, and covered up. But the covers since 
have been removed, leaving bolts sticking out from partly erased inscriptions. 
The 1974 plaque also is nowhere to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
Morial's move, like Everett's order, sparked challenges from the National Assn. 
for the Advancement of White People, founded by Duke. 
</P>
<P>
Duke, former imperial wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, founded the 
NAAWP after repudiating the klan. He was elected last February to the state 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The NAAWP held a small protest at the monument earlier this month in which 
about 20 people showed up. The group said it would be satisfied if the city 
assured it the monument would be erected somewhere within the 10 blocks covered 
by the Battle of Liberty.

PROSECUTIONS INITIATED IN CASES OF DEATHS, INJURIES

<P>
Criminal prosecutions have been initiated in a wide variety of job-related 
deaths and injuries. Here are outlines of some recent cases: 
</P>
<P>
Michigan: A decision is pending from the Michigan Court of Appeals on whether 
there is sufficient evidence for a trial in the carbon-monoxide death of a 
cable TV installer. Prosecutors want to charge a company foreman with 
involuntary manslaughter. They say he knew the van in which the man died had a 
faulty exhaust system. Two lower courts have disagreed on the evidence issue. 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin: A jury convicted a company of reckless homicide in the death of a 
man who drove a front-end loader off a 60-foot cliff. Prosecutors said the 
employer knew the man had epilepsy, had given him less than 40 hours of 
training and had no on-site supervisor. Another company pleaded no contest to 
an endangerment charge and was fined in the death of a man killed when a crane 
collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Texas: Two construction companies and one executive were convicted of 
criminally negligent homicide in the deaths of three workers in separate trench 
cave-ins. The three convictions were overturned on the grounds that state law 
was preempted by federal occupational safety regulations. They are being 
appealed. A third company has been charged in a similar case. 
</P>
<P>
New York: An appeal is pending in the assault convictions of two executives of 
Pymm Thermometer Corp. for exposing workers to toxic mercury. A judge dismissed 
the verdict on preemption grounds.

<P>
WEIGHT-CONSCIOUS NAVY TELLS ITS BRASS TO SHAPE UP OR SHIP OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Senior Chief Tom Cook would punch a wall when he got angry at his crew aboard a 
guided missile frigate, and then he would eat. And eat, and eat. His weight 
fluctuated between 205 and 260 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
After 12 years of unswerving loyalty to the Navy, the 6-foot-1 Cook was 
recently told to lose weight or lose his job. "I was very, very angry," said 
Cook, 32. "I'm just fat, but I'm doing my job. Why get rid of me?" 
</P>
<P>
Because the Navy says overweight sailors and officers aren't fit for combat, 
and it is cracking down. 
</P>
<P>
In a last-ditch effort to rescue their careers, the best and the biggest 
sailors worldwide today vie for a spot at the six-week weight-loss program held 
at Miramar Naval Air Station's Alcohol Rehabilitation Center. 
</P>
<P>
In the Navy, after a minimum of three warnings, anyone can be discharged if 
still overweight. An individual also can be prevented from transferring or 
advancing in rank because of weight. For every dollar spent on an individual in 
treatment, $12 would be spent to replace the person, according to Navy 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"It provides more productive man-hours, I feel, than any other program in the 
Navy today" because it saves personnel from being discharged, said Capt. Ronald 
B. Lewis, commanding officer of the rehabilitation center, which treats 192 
alcoholics, drug abusers and overeaters during a six-week period. Almost a 
quarter of those patients are usually overeaters. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy considers any man overweight if he has more than 22% body fat; for a 
woman, the level is 30%. Last year, the Navy tried to help about 26,000 
enlisted men and women, or 4% of its personnel, lose weight. Almost 900 were 
treated in residential programs. Officials declined to say how many personnel 
were discharged because of weight. But the Navy estimates that about 10% of its 
614,598 personnel weigh too much. 
</P>
<P>
At Miramar, the largest of four such Navy facilities across the nation, the 
average person who attends the overeaters' program is about 50 to 100 pounds 
overweight. Without any lasting success, they've tried everything from 
diuretics to laxatives, fasting to purging. 
</P>
<P>
Most have spent many years in the military, and for them, success means staying 
in the Navy. Of those who enroll at Miramar, about 70% succeed in keeping their 
weight down, according to one-year follow-up surveys. 
</P>
<P>
For some participants at Miramar, food had become the focal point of their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
Chief William Newsom is an example. Stationed on the frigate Francis Hammond in 
Long Beach, he would issue an order and then return to his locker, where he had 
a cache of sour balls, peanut butter, breakfast cereals and cheese-flavored 
chips stashed away in plastic bags. 
</P>
<P>
"My locker was the center of the day, it was the center of everything I did," 
said Newsom, a 29-year-old St. Paul, Minn., native. "I'd check on someone and 
go back to my locker. I'd issue an order and go back to my locker." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, all Navy personnel are measured about every six months for fat and 
put through an hourlong "physical readiness" test that includes a 1 1/2-mile 
run, push-ups and sit-ups. Newsom, at 5 feet 8 inches, had trouble with the fat 
measurements. At his heaviest, he weighed 240 pounds and his body fat was 35%. 
</P>
<P>
Newsom, who enlisted 11 years ago, used to run marathons. But when he quit 
running, he gained about 60 pounds, he said. His weight threatened to sink his 
career. When he came up for promotion, he was ordered to slim down; he was 
awarded the rank of chief but not the increased pay. If he couldn't lose 
weight, he said, he would have been demoted. 
</P>
<P>
Newsom fasted for four days, ate one meal and fasted for another four days to 
pass the fat measurement test, he said. Then he applied to the Miramar program, 
knowing his crash diet would not prevent the pounds from returning. Still 
enrolled, he now weighs about 218. 
</P>
<P>
Miramar is open only to supervisory officers, or those whose ranks are 2nd 
class petty officer and above. After investing what can add up to millions of 
dollars in training, the Navy is reluctant to discharge an individual because 
of weight, said Lt. Cmdr. Jim Blunt, an administrator involved with the 
reduction program. But the Navy will enroll only those considered valuable and 
those who want to continue their service for several more years. 
</P>
<P>
"The Navy is not interested in investing six weeks' treatment in someone who is 
going to be a poor sailor," Blunt said. 
</P>
<P>
To the shock of most commanding officers who send personnel to Miramar's 
weight-loss program, many don't return dramatically slimmer than when they 
left. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not our intention to melt the weight off, because it won't work and the 
weight will come right back. We try to have a more long-term solution," Blunt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Many arrive at Miramar calling it a "fat farm," figuring they will be placed on 
strict diets and run through a treadmill of rigorous exercise. They are usually 
surprised to learn they are allowed to eat whatever they want. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing stops me from going to chow hall and pigging out," said Chief Marc 
Rioux, in his final week at Miramar. "When I first got here, I thought this was 
asinine. How the hell would anyone lose weight with three meals a day? I 
thought they would give me a strict diet and run your butt off, and then I 
realized this place is working on your mind. I found myself asking for less and 
less food -- and I was getting full." 
</P>
<P>
Blunt and a staff of 22 counselors hope to help the individual initiate a 
different life style. They believe the chronic overeater uses food just as an 
alcoholic drinks or a drug abuser takes dope. Each abuser, they say, has a 
disease over which they have little control. The weight-loss program is modeled 
after Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous courses. To the surprise of 
some, alcoholics, drug abusers and overeaters are placed in one program at 
Miramar. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't figure out what I had in common with these AA and NA types, but 
then I realized it was the same basic compulsion. Instead of drinking or doing 
drugs, I ate," Newsom said. 
</P>
<P>
While alcoholics and drug abusers learn to stop consuming drugs and alcohol, 
overeaters must learn to control their compulsive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"They get the opportunity to re-enter their disease three times every day. 
Alcoholics put the plug in the jug and that's it," said Blunt, a former 
overeater. "We have to take the tiger out of the cage and pet it three times a 
day." 
</P>
<P>
Applicants to the program sometimes wait months to enroll. Miramar's waiting 
list used to be 10 months; it's now down to one because the Navy doubled the 
center's capacity during the past year and encouraged three other 
rehabilitation centers to treat overweight personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, individuals frequently wait several months before their senior 
officers can find a suitable time to allow a leave from duty to attend the 
program, at a cost to the Navy of $3,200 per person. 
</P>
<P>
For several years, the Navy, Army and Air Force have tried to tackle the 
problem of unhealthy weight gain. Officials say the military has been affected 
by the fitness trend sweeping the nation. Doctors warn that roughly 33 million 
Americans are so overweight that they are at high risk for a range of 
life-threatening conditions, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, 
diabetes and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
While some in the Navy say they've had lifelong problems with overeating, 
others can pinpoint the times in their lives when eating became a salve for 
jangled nerves. But for all the participants, the program means confronting 
their past and how they cope with emotions. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Rioux, a hospital corpsman now stationed in Alaska, began bingeing and 
eating almost constantly after he returned from Vietnam, where he spent a year 
in the intensive care unit of a hospital ship. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to put up with the pain and misery of caring for these young kids and 
knowing they were going to die," Rioux said. "I kept swallowing down my 
feelings. And I swallowed a lot because I thought no one would care." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, food became a buffer that separated him from the world. The 
6-foot-1 Rioux weighed 285 at his heaviest, and tests indicated that about 33% 
of his body was fat. Shopping for his clothing became painfully embarrassing 
since stores never stocked his size. 
</P>
<P>
"Eating to me was an outlet like alcohol. It comforted me," he said. "It 
relieved my anger and tension. Instead of sharing my emotions with my family or 
friends, I'd share it with my refrigerator or cupboard." 
</P>
<P>
Rioux and others say the real test comes when they leave Miramar, returning to 
the same jobs and tensions that drove them to eat. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure I'm scared," Rioux said. "But this is something I'll have to deal with 
the rest of my life." 
</P>

MARSHLAND REVIVED AFTER HARD WORK ON OIL SPILL; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: A REMARKABLE RECOVERY IN AN ECOLOGICALLY SENSITIVE REGION TOOK 14 
MONTHS AND COST SHELL OIL CO. $12 MILLION.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Crawdads crawl and killdeer call again less than two years after 440,000 
gallons of oil spilled into an intricately sensitive marshland here. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not totally OK, but I would say it's 90% back," said Richard Bogaert, the 
biologist who monitors the 120-acre wetlands. "The marsh shrubs and grasses 
seem to have grown back, coming up from the roots. And we've had good nesting 
this year: pintail ducks, mallards, cinnamon teals." 
</P>
<P>
The remarkable recovery had its price. It took 14 months and cost Shell Oil Co. 
$12 million, nearly $30 for each gallon spilled. A small part of that money was 
paid to fishermen, but most was spent on labor-intensive oil cleanup, said Bill 
Sharkey, community relations manager for Shell. 
</P>
<P>
This success does not necessarily inspire hope about the thousands of oil 
spills reported to the Coast Guard each year, including the 11 million gallons 
that coated 9,600 square miles of Alaskan waters and shoreline in late March. 
Each spill is different. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Rugg, a water-quality biologist who was the state's overseer at the 
Martinez cleanup, is hesitant to draw comparisons between the Alaskan spill and 
the Martinez marsh. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount was so different up there and conditions are so different," he 
said. "You've got open ocean there and the arctic weather. And the equipment 
that we used was not available there." 
</P>
<P>
The Martinez wetland's thick stands of cattails and acres of dusty green 
pickleweed were cleaned manually, square foot by square foot. Crews of 20 
contract laborers worked 40 hours a week for six months. They sought out oiled 
plants and trimmed them down to ground level, trying not to disturb their 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
"The marsh is like tundra in that human footprints damage it," Bogaert said. 
"That opens up the area for annual grasses and weeds that replace the marsh 
habitat. The marsh's grasses and shrubs are perennials and take longer to get 
established. They're battling it out right now in some areas." 
</P>
<P>
The wetland is unusual in that its pre-spill condition was well documented. The 
marsh has been maintained by the Mountain View Sanitary District since 1984 to 
provide habitat for migratory birds and other creatures that need the 
now-scarce wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
Bogaert, who works for the district, has observed waterfowl and analyzed water 
nutrients at this marsh and another owned by the district for eight years. He 
had completed his spring bird census just days before the flood of heavy crude 
oil started down Peyton Slough toward the marsh on April 22, 1988. A drainpipe 
in a 12-million-gallon storage tank at the Shell refinery a quarter-mile away 
had ruptured, and a safety valve that was supposed to be closed was open. 
</P>
<P>
In much of the marsh and the slough, Bogaert said, the oil was a black carpet 
about four inches thick, suffocating everything in its path, down to the 
bacteria. Hundreds of birds died. 
</P>
<P>
Early on, the spill managers decided to sacrifice the wetlands, hoping to 
contain the spill and prevent further damage downstream. Workers dammed the odd 
little wildlife oasis, which is sandwiched between an interstate freeway and a 
railroad line. It became a holding pond for the tide of poison. 
</P>
<P>
"About half the oil was recovered from the marsh and Peyton Slough," said Rugg, 
who works for California's Department of Fish and Game. The remainder was 
distributed downstream in the slough and in the nearby open waters of Carquinez 
Strait and Suisun Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The oil tainted other wetlands, although less severely than the district's 
marsh, and fouled some rocky intertidal zones. 
</P>
<P>
"Altogether," Rugg said, "about 50 miles of coastline were affected to one 
degree or another. About five to eight miles were severely affected." 
</P>
<P>
Rugg, whose job is to make sure that cleanups comply with state requirements, 
has worked in the aftermath of about 20 major oil spills since 1970 in San 
Francisco Bay. He says that each spill requires a decision on how aggressively 
to respond. "We have to take into account the residual damage from the cleanup 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
In a marsh, he said, "foot traffic can drive the oil into the substrate. That 
damages the root structure and can result in more loss of habitat and 
vegetation than just leaving the oil there. 
</P>
<P>
"The oil companies, in general, have taken the position that oil, being a 
biodegradable material, will break down in time and any cleanup in the fragile 
areas will cause more damage than benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Rugg recognizes some merit in that position, he said, "but in this case, we had 
endangered species and migratory birds using these wetlands. The potential 
effect of oiling on these birds was so severe that immediate cleanup and 
removal of the oil was prudent." 
</P>
<P>
In the first stage of the cleanup, as much oil as possible was vacuumed off by 
trucks at the marsh's edge. 
</P>
<P>
From there, the wetlands crews had to step more lightly. The marsh was drained 
to harden the top layer of soil, so walking on it wouldn't damage roots. Drying 
out the marsh didn't hurt it because wetlands are seasonal and dry up in summer 
under normal circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
After the earth was firm, around mid-June, 1988, laborers began mowing down the 
oil-fouled salt grass, spike rush, and alkali heath with hand-held weed-cutting 
tools. They bagged the cuttings and carried them out on their backs. 
</P>
<P>
"They had the whole marsh marked off with little stakes and flags," Bogaert 
said. The root systems of the perennials survived for the most part. And with 
the wetland's reflooding this fall and winter, the marsh recreated itself. 
</P>
<P>
Bogaert is still concerned with the oil's long-term effects in the nearby 
waters, where cleanup couldn't be so thorough. "This spill has been cleaned up. 
But that's not the end of its impact," he said. "The effects show up in the 
reproductive cycles of marine animals: with lower fertilization success, lower 
embryo survival rates, lower larvae survival." 
</P>
<P>
But any of that, he said, will be hard to blame on one spill. 
</P>
<P>
"The oil got so dispersed that it will be difficult to find effects that stand 
out from the background pollution -- from the tanker traffic, the refineries, 
and the industrial traffic." 
</P>
<P>
In the course of this and other cleanups, Rugg has come across areas tainted by 
old residues of oil spills. They form a tar-like surface over the shoreline, he 
said: "It never recovers." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, he said, at the marsh and in the rocky areas cleaned after the 
Shell spill, laborers carefully removed as much oil as possible and then 
allowed nature to work. "What we learned from this spill," Rugg said, "was that 
if you can effectively remove the oil, recovery is almost immediate."

HIGH PRICE OF PARK SHOPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Encinitas' Parks Commissioner Nancy Orr's justification for spending $25 
million for new parks employs about the same logic as if she were going to 
spend an afternoon shopping at Nordstrom. 
</P>
<P>
FACT: To pay for the park bonds, our property taxes will be raised based on the 
assessed values of our homes. Because of Proposition 13, those who have lived 
here for several years have lower assessed values and will pay much less. 
However, those who bought their homes more recently have higher assessed values 
and will pay much more -- as much as five to 10 times more. That's 
discriminatory. Newer residents could wind up paying for as much as 75% of the 
new parks. Yet many live in areas that already have parks that were paid for in 
the cost of their homes. Should they be expected to pay for parks twice? 
</P>
<P>
FACT: Ms. Orr claims we are "deficient" in parks because the city only owns 40 
developed acres. That is false and misleading. There are hundreds and hundreds 
of acres of beaches, parks, trails and open space in and around our city. The 
city doesn't include that in their totals because they don't own it. But most 
is still publicly owned land and there for all of us to use. And, regardless of 
what public agency maintains it, we aren't deficient in anything (except maybe 
a parks commissioner with some bottom-line common sense). 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Orr needs to figure out how her Parks Department can improve and pay for 
what they already have. And until they do, the voters can't afford to give her 
a $25-million blank check to go shopping.

BIG BEAR PACKAGES A WORTHY CONCEPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Plastic grocery bags in recent years have become standard at most markets. 
Sometimes the bagger will ask "plastic or paper?" but, if they don't, the 
likelihood is that you'll be lugging groceries home in plastic sacks. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego-based Big Bear Markets is trying to change this. In recent weeks the 
30-store chain has started encouraging the use of paper bags once again. 
Plastic is still available, but paper is pushed. 
</P>
<P>
Paper containers also have replaced plastic foam in Big Bear delicatessens, and 
the stores are sprinkled with signs trying to educate customers on such things 
as buying pump sprays rather than aerosol. 
</P>
<P>
As with many environmental issues, the merits of plastic vs. paper packaging 
are hotly debated. For our money, paper sacks seem the better choice. But the 
arguments can get complicated. Plastic bags are less bulky, so they take less 
energy to transport and take up less room in landfills, goes one argument. But 
paper degrades more easily, is more readily recyclable and comes from a 
renewable resource. 
</P>
<P>
Which products are environmentally safer will take years to sort out. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no question that we need to produce less packaging. And Big Bear's 
program addresses that as well. It will pay customers 2 cents for each large 
paper sack they bring back to be reused in packing their next grocery purchase. 
</P>
<P>
That is a move in the right direction. Using a grocery sack two or three times 
genuinely means there will be less waste for the landfill and less pollution in 
manufacturing and transporting the packaging. 
</P>
<P>
Two cents may not be enough incentive to prompt very many customers to bring 
their own bags to the supermarket, but it's a start. And, combined with an 
aggressive marketing program, it helps promote recycling. It's a way to make 
people stop and think about packaging and recycling in the grocery store -- the 
place where we buy so much of what ends up in our trash.

A 14-year-old newspaper carrier is credited with saving the life of an elderly 
woman who had spent 10 days lying on her back in a bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
Christy Wenrich alerted police after she noticed a pile of newspapers on the 
stoop of 83-year-old Ellen Gilmour's home. Wenrich had just resumed delivering 
The Record of Hackensack after her sister had taken over the route for a few 
days. 
</P>
<P>
When police went to Gilmour's home, they heard faint pleas for help coming from 
inside. "They broke into the back and found her in the bathtub on her back," 
said Ramsey Police Capt. Anthony Del Colliano. 
</P>
<P>
Gilmour told police she had been cleaning the tub when she fell in 10 days 
before her rescue. 
</P>
<P>
She was hospitalized in fair condition Friday.

LANDMARK CASE IS A GIANT STEP BACKWARD; 
</P>
<P>
EPILEPSY: MANY PEOPLE STILL LINK THE DISEASE TO INSANITY, VIOLENCE, LACK OF 
INTELLIGENCE, EVEN POSSESSION BY DEMONS. 
</P>

<P>
In a so-called landmark case, jurors recently held a local neurologist 
responsible -- to the tune of $3.14 million -- for his epileptic patient's auto 
accident. What may be considered landmark by some, especially the plaintiff's 
attorney, actually represents a giant step backward for my son and the other 2 
million or more Americans (23,000 in San Diego County alone) who have epilepsy. 
</P>
<P>
As a group, people with epilepsy (please do not categorize them as epileptics) 
have had to fight and claw their way out of the dark ages of public 
misinformation and superstition. This verdict, which is full of flaws anyway, 
promises to set them back considerably in this county, state, even nation. 
</P>
<P>
And the timing couldn't be worse for my son Matt, who looks forward to applying 
for his driver's license on his 16th birthday next month. Before this case 
reached the courts and the media, we assumed the license was practically in his 
wallet. 
</P>
<P>
After two nightmare years of trying five different anticonvulsants, Matt now 
takes a medication that has controlled his seizures for 26 months -- a good 20 
months longer than the standard generally applied by the California Department 
of Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
We understood the licensing process might take a little longer for Matt because 
the DMV would contact his neurologist and possibly require an interview before 
granting a license. Now, thanks to the chilling effect that this case is bound 
to have on everyone involved, the process might take a lot longer or stall 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
As parents, we add this new concern about a driver's license to all our other 
fears about his future. In this so-called Age of Information, many people still 
link epilepsy to insanity, violence, lack of intelligence, even possession by 
demons. 
</P>
<P>
We are not alone in our concern about the right to drive, says Margaret Holt, 
executive director of the Epilepsy Society of San Diego. She reports a dramatic 
increase in phone calls from people in a panic over their own driving future in 
this transportation wasteland. 
</P>
<P>
"The natural fallout from this verdict will be that everyone involved will 
exercise extreme caution," Holt says. 
</P>
<P>
Holt fears that this verdict may even lead us back to a time when there was a 
mandatory three-year waiting period in California for anyone with a seizure 
disorder. Such a lengthy waiting period makes no sense at a time when the vast 
majority of people with epilepsy can expect to have their seizures controlled 
completely by modern medication. 
</P>
<P>
We can only hope that the DMV will continue to look at the individual rather 
than the category, while also taking into account the relevant accident 
statistics. According to a survey of traffic accidents in the United States and 
Western Europe, conducted by Dr. James A. Trostle of UC Berkeley, people with 
epilepsy have no greater risk of being involved in auto accidents than people 
with heart disease, stroke, diabetes and alcoholism. The only reason Trostle 
can find for stricter regulations for people with epilepsy is lingering social 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
One of his most interesting findings is that only 27% of the auto accidents 
involving people with epilepsy were actually caused by seizures. In this local 
case, there is serious doubt about whether 18-year-old Trudy Stevenson's 
epilepsy had anything to do with her accident. 
</P>
<P>
Although her attorney spent an inordinate amount of trial time trying to prove 
a seizure caused the accident, the jury remained unconvinced. How, then, can 
they possibly hold her neurologist accountable for the accident? Have we gone 
so far beyond the notion of personal responsibility that a doctor can be held 
liable for every action his patient takes? 
</P>
<P>
Take that "logic" a little further, and the optometrist is responsible for his 
patient who fails to wear prescription eyeglasses while at the wheel, the 
cellular telephone manufacturer for the driver who fails to pay attention while 
dialing, the cosmetic company for the woman putting on her mascara in the 
rear-view mirror. 
</P>
<P>
The logical lapses in this "landmark" verdict should be exposed in the planned 
appeal, but that will not be in time for Matt's birthday. So far, he's faced 
seizures, medication changes, regular blood drawings, hospital stays and one 
diagnostic test after another with surprising equanimity. We hope this verdict 
won't make him face being one of the only 16-year-olds in Southern California 
who can't drive.

DIVERSE FIELD VIES FOR EL SEGUNDO SEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A large and diverse group of candidates will greet El Segundo voters when they 
go to the polls Nov. 7 to fill four school board seats. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven hopefuls are seeking a seat on the five-member board, which sets policy 
for the 1,950-student district. Of the candidates, only two, Timothy Chang and 
Ruth Parks, currently serve on the board. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbents David Jones and Janice Cruikshank did not seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Although no dominant issue has emerged in the campaign, a major issue new board 
members will confront in coming months is how to make money from the district's 
surplus property and pay for long-delayed maintenance projects at various 
school sites. 
</P>
<P>
The district, with a budget this year of $8.6 million, has been too poor in 
recent years to pay for the projects -- projects it now estimates will cost 
$1.5 million. The district operates one elementary, one middle and one high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"El Segundo is real estate rich as a school district, and cash poor," said 
candidate Ken Schofield. 
</P>
<P>
Some maintenance money could be forthcoming soon. Just last week, the district 
completed a deal with the city to swap a downtown parking lot it did not need 
for a 22,000-square-foot parcel of land on Imperial Highway. 
</P>
<P>
The property, which is already zoned for apartment construction, could bring 
the district $500,000 to $800,000 when it is sold, according to school 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
But bigger decisions over what to do with the district's surplus property loom. 
A citizen's committee in September recommended that the district develop the 
property where a former elementary school now sits. The school was shut down 
years ago because of declining enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, whose members were appointed by the present school board, also 
suggested that the district sell a property now used as a maintenance yard -- a 
move it estimated could generate $1.5 to $2 million. The group also recommended 
that the district turn a former junior high school, also closed because of 
declining enrollment and now leased by the Los Angeles Raiders, into a middle 
school, and then develop the property where the present middle school sits. 
</P>
<P>
The district has hired a consultant to help it develop a detailed plan for the 
surplus property. 
</P>
<P>
Of the candidates, two are seeking the unexpired term of Andrew Wallet, who 
resigned from the board last year. Board members appointed Chang to temporarily 
fill Wallet's seat, which expires in 1991, and Chang has decided to seek a 
four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
One of the candidates for the two-year term is Martha Castillo Del Muro, 24, 
who graduated from El Segundo High School in 1983. Del Muro, who received a 
political science degree from the University of California, Berkeley, said she 
thinks the district should improve its academic counseling program for all 
students, regardless of whether they plan to go to college or into a vocation. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Del Muro, who sells insurance, said the district should be more 
academically rigorous. "We have good teachers. The thing is, I think sometimes 
our classes are watered down," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Del Muro's opponent is 38-year-old Keith Wise, a project superintendent for an 
electrical contractor. Wise said he would like to see the board have a more 
"hands-on" approach to district affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we don't have that kind of leadership from our existing board," 
Wise said. "I think they depend too much on (the) administration." 
</P>
<P>
Wise said the district should think about using any funds generated by the 
surplus property to boost the salaries of beginning teachers and perhaps offer 
early retirement incentives for older teachers. 
</P>
<P>
These are the candidates seeking a four-year term: 
</P>
<P>
Jim Butterworth, 34, an engineer. Butterworth said he believes that the present 
school board has been unresponsive to parents. In the lower grades, the school 
day should be lengthened, he said, and at the high school level, more stringent 
graduation requirements are needed. 
</P>
<P>
"We have kids who graduate and don't have enough credits to get into a 
four-year college," Butterworth said. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Chang, 40, an attorney. In July, the state Supreme Court ordered Chang 
disbarred after finding that he misappropriated more than $7,000 from a client, 
the Mellon Bank of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Chang said he is innocent of any wrongdoing and that he plans to appeal the 
decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Chang said he believes that the most important issue facing the district is 
maintaining and increasing its revenue base through its surplus property. The 
money should be used for deferred maintenance projects and for teacher 
salaries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Chang said that the district's elementary school is overcrowded and that 
new board members will have to come up with solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Parks, 68, a two-term board member. Parks was a school secretary for 25 
years until she retired in 1981. She said she decided to run for a third term 
because she believes that the board would be well-served by her experience. 
Parks praised the present board for working to beef up drug- and alcohol-abuse 
programs in the elementary school, and for tightening up student disciplinary 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Reed, 46, a self-employed music teacher and former computer programmer. 
For years, Reed has lobbied before education officials locally and elsewhere to 
change the way music is taught. He said he has devised methods for teaching 
music that are much easier to learn than conventional ones and that he would 
like to see them used in El Segundo schools. 
</P>
<P>
Reed said his methods extend beyond the teaching of music to math and 
languages. "The idea is to reduce unnecessary complexity that makes some 
students fail," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Schofield, 46, a real estate broker. Schofield said the present board has 
not been assertive enough in setting district policy. He said he wants to 
improve relations between the district and teachers, and find ways to increase 
the salaries of younger teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Walters, 42, a security supervisor for an electronics company. Walters 
said he wants to improve communications between the community and the district. 
He also said he wants to scrutinize the district's budget to determine how 
present money is spent before deciding whether to sell any surplus property. 
</P>
<P>
"Until we find out how much we spend on brooms, the land is there," Walters 
said. "It is a good safety valve." 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Walker, 47, a banker. She said she believes that the district should 
strive to earn money from its surplus property without actually selling any of 
it. She also said the district must attend to the "basic fundamentals in 
education." 
</P>
<P>
"We have to make sure we are preparing our students to function well when they 
get into the outside world," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Wellfonder, 43, a print shop owner. Wellfonder said he wants the board 
to become more accessible to the public, and that board members should strive 
to visit school campuses more often. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, I think the schools have done a pretty good job," Wellfonder said. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Wernick, 43, a self-employed financial consultant. Wernick said present 
board members are not sufficiently versed in budget matters, and she would work 
to change that. "I would like to stop signing blank checks without question," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Wernick said she would like to see community advisory councils formed at 
each educational level.

TRADE SCHOOL IN LAWNDALE OPENS WITHOUT LICENSE; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: AUTOMOTIVE SCHOOL DRAWS CITATION AFTER IGNORING CITY COUNCIL'S REFUSAL TO 
GRANT PERMIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The city of Lawndale has issued two misdemeanor citations to an automotive 
trade school that last week defied a City Council decision by operating without 
a business license. 
</P>
<P>
Unified Schools of America on Monday began holding classes at its facilities on 
the 15000 block of Hawthorne Boulevard -- three weeks after the City Council 
unanimously voted to deny the school a business license. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Starler, an attorney for Unified Schools of America, said the trade 
school was forced to move to the Lawndale site after a building the school used 
in Inglewood was condemned for failing to meet earthquake standards. 
</P>
<P>
"None of what we are doing is intended as a defiance of the council's 
decision," he said in interviews Thursday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Trade school officials and the city are meeting in an effort to resolve the 
problem, both sides said. 
</P>
<P>
The misdemeanor citations that were issued Monday and Tuesday carry possible 
penalties of $1,000 and six months in jail, said Assistant City Manager Paula 
Cone. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood officials said Friday that they had cited Unified Schools four times 
this year for violating city codes, including operating without a special 
permit required of schools and failure to get building permits, said Inglewood 
City Atty. Howard Rosten. 
</P>
<P>
Problems for Unified with Lawndale began in September, when the Planning 
Commission refused to issue a business license for it. The school appealed to 
the City Council, which on Oct. 5 agreed that zoning ordinances prohibit trade 
schools from operating along Hawthorne Boulevard. At the meeting, 
representatives of Unified Schools criticized the decision, noting that the 
city has approved business licenses for two other trade schools on Hawthorne 
Boulevard: Barclay College and South Bay College Automotive Training Center. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Sarann Kruse said last week that city staff approved business licenses 
for the two trade schools under a misinterpretation of city zoning code. 
</P>
<P>
To correct any ambiguity, the council also added language to the zoning code 
that explicitly prohibits trade schools, as well as other schools. 
</P>
<P>
Kruse said the city is willing to discuss the matter, but added that by 
operating the school without a license, Unified Schools is "going to make the 
situation more difficult to solve." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Starler said Thursday that Unified Schools, an Encino-based 
company that has five locations in Los Angeles County, will continue to do 
business in Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
Cone said that the city decided not to issue a citation for each day that the 
school stays open. If the school does not close, she said, the city will 
consider referring the matter to the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Lawndale fire officials also cited the school for six fire code 
violations, including failure to provide fire extinguishers and exit doors that 
open from the inside, Cone said. Unified Schools has 14 days to correct the 
fire code violations. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the city also ordered Unified Schools to halt construction work 
on the Hawthorne Boulevard facility, because the school has failed to get a 
building permit, Cone said. 
</P>
<P>
Starler said Unified Schools is in the process of addressing the fire code 
violations and has stopped the construction. 
</P>
<P>
In Inglewood, Rosten said the trade school was cited in October, 1989, for 
operating without a special permit required of schools. The trade school also 
was cited twice in September, 1989, and once in May, 1989, for making 
alterations to the facility without a building permit. 
</P>
<P>
Rosten said he does not know when Unified Schools began to operate in the city. 
But he said that, according to city documents, Unified Schools' business 
license lapsed in January, 1988, and was not renewed until at least that 
October. 
</P>
<P>
He said the city tried to negotiate a settlement to the problems with Unified 
Schools but ultimately dropped all charges when the trade school moved out of 
Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal was only to get compliance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With regard to the Inglewood citations, Starler said he was unaware that a 
special permit was required for the school. 
</P>
<P>
Starler said he was not familiar with the details of the building violations. 
But the Unified attorney said he believes the city issued some of the citations 
for violations that the trade school inherited from a previous tenant. 
</P>
<P>
He said the trade school applied for a business license but did not receive one 
because of an "administrative foul-up" with the city.

SYLMAR HOMEOWNERS DRAFT GROWTH PLAN TO GUARD RURAL CHARACTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leaders of a Sylmar property owners group said Saturday that they are 
formulating an area plan to ensure that future development does not damage the 
rural character of the community. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal by the 429-member Sylmar Landowners Assn. for Fair Development 
would require that new buildings use architectural styles and colors that blend 
with the surrounding mountains, and includes plans to bring light-rail service 
into the area and build a privately funded equestrian center at Stetson Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for the expansion of industries and businesses that would 
make the foothill community more self-sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
Specific details of the plan, which group leaders describe as preliminary, were 
being revised Saturday during a daylong meeting. The organization's president, 
Linda Chambers, said the final plan will be presented to Los Angeles City 
Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who represents Sylmar, and city planning officials 
within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not experts on planning or development, but we have an advantage in 
knowing what's good for the community," said Chambers, who has lived in Sylmar 
for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We have driven down each and every street, and we know what would be good for 
that street," she said. "We have valid proposals that should be considered." 
</P>
<P>
Chambers added that the group is not anti-development. "If something is built 
well and with care, then it can only help property values," she said. "But we 
don't want large projects squeezed on small parcels. We don't want a 
hodgepodge. We want uniformity of development." 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar, nestled along the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains within the 
northeastern border of Los Angeles, is one of the city's rural outposts. 
Numerous residents raise horses, sheep and chickens. 
</P>
<P>
The area became the fastest-growing community of the city between 1980 and 
1986, with a 27% increase in population from 41,922 to 53,392, according to the 
Los Angeles Planning Department. 
</P>
<P>
Most of that growth took place between 1984 and 1986, when the population 
soared 3,000 above the 1977 estimate of the figure for 1990, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Chambers said the group is not concerned with overdevelopment. The plan says 
new single-family homes and apartment complexes should be built to accommodate 
the new growth, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Chambers added that growth of the community should be planned so that the 
rural character is not lost. 
</P>
<P>
Extensive buffering between residential neighborhoods and industrial areas 
should be done with trees, open space and walls, the plan says. All apartment 
and condominium complexes should contain large areas of open space and 
greenery. 
</P>
<P>
To make the community more self-sufficient, the plan calls for bringing in 
service businesses, such as electrical and welding firms, so that residents 
would not have to travel long distances to reach them. 
</P>
<P>
The group proposed that such businesses could be located along the 
predominantly industrial corridor of Roxford Street. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can have businesses to service ourselves, we could ease the gridlock on 
the already crowded freeways," Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
The group applauded the possibility of light-rail service in the area. The Los 
Angeles County Transportation Commission on Wednesday voted to study speeding 
up construction of a light-rail line linking Los Angeles International Airport 
and Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
But Chambers said the line should extend into Canyon Country. "That is a 
growing area, and all those cars are going to come through Sylmar on their way 
to and from Canyon Country," she said. "We need more rapid transit." 
</P>
<P>
Another aspect of the plan deals with establishment of a satellite 
sewage-treatment plant. Such a plant would help lift some of the burden from 
Los Angeles' troubled sewer system, which is nearing capacity. 
</P>
<P>
The group said they wanted the equestrian center built at Stetson Ranch, which 
is presently open space, by a private organization.

POLICE, SHERIFF'S RESERVES HELP FILL LAW ENFORCEMENT GAPS AS VOLUNTEERS IN THE 
WAR ON CRIME

Patty Williams spends most nights serving cocktails at a restaurant in Acton. 
But at least four nights a month, she straps on a gun and cruises the streets 
of Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
Williams is not hanging out with a gang or dealing drugs. The gun is a police 
service revolver, and she rides in a Los Angeles Police Department 
black-and-white. 
</P>
<P>
Williams is one of the 740 reserve officers in the Los Angeles Police 
Department and 1,000 reserve deputies in the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department who donate part of their time each month to chase criminals down 
alleys, patrol crime-ridden streets on horseback, scour canyons for lost hikers 
and perform most of the other duties of their full-time counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
For Los Angeles police reservists, the only monetary compensation is a $15 
monthly stipend to cover dry-cleaning of uniforms. Sheriff's reservists are 
paid $1 a year to qualify for the department's liability insurance, which 
covers only paid employees. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say reserves are an increasingly essential part of the war against 
crime in the San Fernando and neighboring valleys as law enforcement agencies 
struggle to keep up with growth in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
"The reserves fill in the gaps," said Sgt. Bob Kellar, who is in charge of 
reserve officer training at the Los Angeles Police Academy in Elysian Park. "It 
adds up to a tremendous contribution to our police needs in the city of Los 
Angeles, not to mention tax savings." 
</P>
<P>
The reserves saved the city at least $1.5 million last year, Kellar said. The 
figure is four times that amount by the reckoning of James C. Lombardi, a 
Police Department reservist who is president of the California Reserve Peace 
Officers Assn., which represents the more than 10,000 reservists at law 
enforcement agencies statewide. Counting the benefits for the equivalent number 
of full-time officers and other savings, the reserves saved the city about $6 
million, Lombardi said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department reserves saved county taxpayers more than $11.8 million in 
the 1988-89 fiscal year, according to Sheriff's Department statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Reservists come from all walks of life but share a love for police work, Kellar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have everything from zookeepers to bus drivers, plumbers, electricians, 
bankers, lawyers -- you name it, we've got it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some reservists intended to become full-time police officers when they were 
younger but wound up in other careers. As reservists, they say, they can 
satisfy their interest in police work while continuing to make a living in 
other professions. 
</P>
<P>
Many of them want to fight crime in their communities, while some have special 
skills -- such as search-and-rescue training, ham radio proficiency or foreign 
language skills -- that police departments need on a part-time basis but cannot 
afford full time. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to be a police officer," said Stan Brittsan, a Thousand Oaks 
resident who supervises telephone repair technicians for Pacific Bell and is a 
reserve observer in a Los Angeles police helicopter every other weekend. "But I 
became interested in another career, so I put aside police work. Later, I 
thought, 'I'm pushing 30 years old. Maybe it's too late for a career change, 
but I can become involved in law enforcement by becoming a reserve officer.' " 
</P>
<P>
Along with having the same responsibilities as regular officers, many 
reservists face the same risks. 
</P>
<P>
John Cresto, a La Crescenta computer consultant and reservist who was assigned 
to the Rampart Division about three years ago, said he was helping other 
officers make an arrest when shots rang out. 
</P>
<P>
"I was standing in the middle of the street and somebody decided to do a 
drive-by shooting at the black-and-whites," Cresto said. No one was hit, and 
other officers later arrested the gunman, said Cresto, who is now assigned to 
the Police Department's Foothill Division. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 30 years, at least 11 sheriff's reservists have been killed in the 
line of duty, said Sheriff's Capt. Stanley Backman, commander of the 
department's Reserve Forces Bureau. Among Los Angeles police reservists, one 
has been killed on duty over the past 21 years, Lombardi said. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, Los Angeles police reservists were mostly assigned routine patrol 
and desk assignments, Kellar said. But today reservists often are assigned 
special duties such as operating the Immediate Booking and Release System, or 
IBARS, in which arrested suspects are booked in the field during gang or 
prostitution sweeps, and they take part in foot patrols in crime-plagued 
neighborhoods, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are increasingly relying on our reserves," Kellar said. "We are utilizing 
them more and more and in a more varied manner." 
</P>
<P>
Using reserves for special assignments gives the Police Department's 7,900 
full-time officers more time to respond to the overwhelming number of emergency 
calls that take up almost all of an officer's shift, Kellar said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike often overworked full-time officers, reserves have the time to do the 
kind of nuts and bolts, old-fashioned police work that has become a luxury in 
Los Angeles, officials said. That includes patrolling city parks to keep away 
drug dealers or even taking so-called "community enhancement" reports from 
residents complaining of potholes or other non-criminal neighborhood nuisances. 
Police send those reports to whatever agency has jurisdiction over the 
particular problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the idea of an officer being able to help rather than saying, 'Hey, 
there's nothing I can do,' " said Sgt. Gary Merrifield, the reserve coordinator 
for the Police Department's Foothill Division, which serves the northeast 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"If I use these reserves to the maximum to relieve a patrol officer, then what 
I've done is give the patrol the little extra time to handle extra calls," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 740 police reservists, 225 are classified as "line reserves" -- meaning 
they carry a gun and are authorized to perform the same duties as full-time 
officers. About an equal number are "technical reserves" who do not carry a gun 
and are typically assigned desk duty or other administrative tasks. The 
remaining 300 are "reserve specialists" -- people who have expertise in 
computers, for example, or clergymen who volunteer as department chaplains. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff Department's 1,000 reservists include 698 uniformed deputies, with 
the rest divided among the department's Mountain Search and Rescue Team and 
Mounted Posse. About 450 of the uniformed reservists perform the same functions 
as full-time deputies. The other 248 are specialists assigned to a variety of 
details, such as the Media Specialists Company, which helps produce training 
films for deputies. 
</P>
<P>
The 38 reservists and 45 civilian volunteers in the Media Specialists Company 
produce, among other films, a series based on shootings involving deputies, 
said Sgt. Mark Aguirre, supervisor of the Sheriff's Media Resources Section, 
which oversees the company. The 35-millimeter films, aimed at demonstrating the 
right and wrong procedures, are videotaped and sold or loaned to law 
enforcement agencies nationwide, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the company's volunteers are successful Hollywood directors, writers 
and directors of photography, Aguirre said. "They are motivated by a basic 
civic pride and a willingness to become involved and a real dedication toward 
law enforcement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In both departments, only reservists who undergo the same training as full-time 
officers are authorized to carry a gun on and off duty. 
</P>
<P>
Line reserve recruits in the Police Department train for almost 10 months at 
night and on weekends to receive the same amount of training as full-time 
officer recruits do in six months. Technical reservists graduate after 17 
weeks, Kellar said. In the Sheriff's Department, reservists go through an 
18-week academy, also at night and on weekends, and those who want to join the 
mountain rescue team receive additional training. 
</P>
<P>
Both reserve programs have fewer participants than when they were begun during 
World War II to replace officers who had joined the military, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department's contingent of 740 is "at about as high a figure as 
we've ever been in recent years," Kellar said, although the number is far short 
of the record 2,000 men and women who signed up in the mid-1940s. Still, the 
figure represents a large increase over the all-time low of about 150 in the 
early 1950s, Kellar said. 
</P>
<P>
Lombardi said minimum training requirements for reservists -- in effect since 
passage of a state law in 1981 -- have led to a decline in interest in such 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"The requirements are heavy," he said. "That discourages a lot of people, but 
that's fine because we're after the finished product. We're not out to just 
give a gun to somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Reservists stay with the department for an average of nine years, about as long 
as the average full-time officer serves, Lombardi said. 
</P>
<P>
Backman of the Sheriff's Reserve Forces Bureau blames attrition and a general 
loss of interest in volunteer work for the decline in his ranks from 1,200 in 
1982 to today's 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more difficult to recruit volunteers for anything," Backman said. "I 
think it's because so many people work at least one job and sometimes two jobs 
apiece. They just aren't as volunteer-minded as the previous generation." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, hundreds of young professionals in typically high-paying jobs -- 
the average California reservist is 32, with an annual income of $40,000 -- 
donate an average of 32 hours each month to help fight crime. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent Friday night in the Foothill Division, for example, Williams the 
cocktail waitress teamed up with Cresto the computer consultant and a Lockheed 
engineer to arrest a suspected drug dealer sitting in a car next to a Tujunga 
park known for drug dealing. 
</P>
<P>
The officers were patrolling the park because neighbors regularly complain of 
drug dealers there, Sgt. Merrifield said. Though they found no large amounts of 
drugs in the car and ended up arresting the man on three outstanding traffic 
warrants, the officers achieved their main objective: visibility. 
</P>
<P>
"The reserves augment our manpower," Merrifield said. "The guy's away from the 
park. People have seen the arrest made. The park will be dead for the rest of 
the night, and we've put a lid on it." 
</P>
<P>
While many in the reserve unit usually patrol the streets in cars, others ride 
horseback, fly in helicopters or hike through rugged terrain, looking for 
missing people. The mounted reservists supply their own horses and pay for 
their upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Pedrick, for example, searches for downed planes or lost hikers in the 
hills behind Santa Clarita when he isn't working as an agent for Great-West 
Life Assurance Co. in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the all-reserve Sheriff's Mountain Search and Rescue Team in the 
Santa Clarita Valley since 1966, the 61-year-old Granada Hills resident has 
witnessed the kinds of emergencies that he insures clients against in his other 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, a lengthy search for a lost motorcyclist ended when Pedrick and 
other team members found the woman's body in an open field. She apparently had 
died of heat exhaustion after abandoning her disabled motorcycle to seek help 
on foot, Pedrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Pedrick assisted in removing the body of a man killed Aug. 15 when a private 
plane crashed into a steep ravine off Templin Highway, north of Castaic. While 
county Fire Department paramedics prepared the injured pilot to be hoisted into 
a rescue helicopter, Pedrick and other rescue team members were flown to the 
scene in a sheriff's helicopter to search for victims who might have been 
thrown from the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Pedrick said participation in the search-and-rescue team allows him to pursue 
an interest in mountaineering and hiking. He said he enjoys the camaraderie of 
the other 14 reservists on the Santa Clarita team. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was in college, I was a rock climber," Pedrick said. "When I got into 
my 30s, I had a family, so I couldn't go rock climbing anymore. This is local. 
And it's a fun group of guys to be with -- everyone there is interested in 
helping people." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, many reservists say the most rewarding part of the work is helping 
others while taking a break from making a living. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of us got into it because we wanted to do something for our 
communities," Williams said. "You can maintain your enthusiasm. It's not like a 
regular job where you have to go in every day."

MEETING SET, BUT MEMBERS OF CARLSBAD-BASED HUMANITARIAN AID GROUP STILL 
HOSTAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Carlsbad-based humanitarian aid volunteers taken captive earlier this week 
by government forces in Mozambique were flown to that country's capital for a 
meeting today with American officials but remain hostages, a spokesman for the 
group said late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
David Courson, president of the Christian Emergency Relief Team, said his 
politically conservative aid organization learned of the meeting Saturday and 
also was told that eight people, not seven as had been thought originally, had 
been abducted. 
</P>
<P>
The group, taken hostage by forces believed to be allied with the Frelimo 
party, the ruling party in Mozambique, was set to meet early this morning with 
U.S. Ambassador Melissa Wells, Courson said. The president of Mozambique, 
Joaquim Alberto Chissano, had taken an "interest" in the meeting, sending a 
letter to Wells, but had not guaranteed the hostages' release, Courson said. 
</P>
<P>
The letter indicates "there are no formal charges although the group is still 
in captivity," Courson said. "Also, it reiterates what (Chissano) has said 
privately, that he has no intention of seeing this escalate into some type of 
an international problem and that he will do the best he can in his power to 
make sure the hostages are not abused. 
</P>
<P>
"But it does stop short. It does not say they will be guaranteed to be 
released." 
</P>
<P>
Without a release, the meeting will serve as the "first time anyone from the 
United States government has been able to personally see how (the captives are) 
doing, their condition, to confirm they're all alive and well, all things 
considering," Courson said. 
</P>
<P>
The eight members of the group, led by Dr. Ken Daugherty, a San Diego minister, 
were believed to have been flown Saturday to Maputo from Tete, a town in the 
northwestern part of the country where they were "forcibly abducted" Tuesday 
night, Courson said. 
</P>
<P>
Original reports were of seven captives, six Americans and one South African. 
But Courson said he learned Saturday that there actually were eight hostages, 
six Americans and two South Africans. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept hearing about a team of eight," he said. "Actually, we heard of seven 
Americans and then two South Africans and we thought it was a mistake at first. 
But then we learned the State Department had counted seven Americans and I was 
one of them, so that was straightened out, so there are six Americans and two 
South Africans." 
</P>
<P>
Along with Daugherty, group members included surgeon Dr. Fred Leist, 48, and 
his wife, Lucille, 43, from Seattle; Dr. John Cannon, 69, a dentist, from 
Davenport, Iowa; Steven Sherrill, 48, a paramedic from Stroudsburg, Pa., and 
Carol Roberts, 26, another paramedic from Syracuse, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Courson identified the two South Africans in the group as Peter Hammond and 
George Bezedenhout. He did not release their ages or home towns. 
</P>
<P>
CERT, a non-profit group, supplies aid to war-torn countries through 
volunteers. Emergency medical forays usually last about two weeks, and members 
pay their own transportation and expenses, Courson said. 
</P>
<P>
Courson first received details about the abduction of this group Friday from a 
contact in South Africa. Hours later, the State Department in Washington 
confirmed the abduction. 
</P>
<P>
Mozambique, a former Portuguese dependency on the southeastern coast of Africa, 
has been torn for years by a right-wing insurgency attributed to the 20,000 
guerrillas of the Mozambique National Resistance. State Department sources said 
the region where the abduction took place is notorious for atrocities, 
generally attributed to MNR rebels. 
</P>
<P>
However, the group was believed to be in the hands of Frelimo forces, Courson 
said, noting that the ruling party is not on friendly terms with the U.S. 
government. Their motive in taking the group hostage was unknown.

MAN HIT BY CAR, KILLED ON FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 38-year-old man believed to be a transient was hit by a car and killed early 
Saturday while standing on an interstate freeway, the county coroner's office 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel MacDonald was facing west in the left-hand lane of northbound Interstate 
5, about 900 feet south of Balboa Avenue, when he was hit at 4:45 a.m. by a car 
driven by Rick Maloney of Mountain View, Deputy Coroner Charles Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
Maloney was apparently unable to avoid the accident and he was not ticketed in 
connection with the accident, Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities believed MacDonald was a transient because he had only a 
Metropolitan Transit System card in his pockets, Kelly said.

MAKING ENDS MEET IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I want to commend you for focusing on the housing problem in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
Housing, transportation, work and violence are increasingly more of a problem 
to most people. For instance, I worked for a year or so as an apartment 
hostess, leasing and showing apartments. They paid me $5 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
If a worker makes $5 per hour ($200 per week) what is left for food, clothing 
and transportation, when the worker pays "the lowest" $500 per month for a 
place to live? The government still gets its share even though it considers the 
income poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
A vehicle is a must in California. Try riding a bus to work, or to shop. Ice 
cream will melt, meat will thaw and bathrooms are almost unknown -- yet the 
system takes four to five hours of your time. There are many people who want to 
work, are able, are qualified -- but the work they find doesn't pay enough to 
rent the $500-a-month apartment and still get them to work. I hope you talk to 
some of these people and write about them. Maybe then the system will listen.

PREPARATIONS FOR QUAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the lingering questions that arose out of the rubble in San Francisco is 
how much preparation is enough. The thornier question, being asked in Orange 
County and throughout the state, is how much should be spent to prepare for a 
disaster that is predictable only in that -- some day -- it will happen. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Board of Supervisors must weigh earthquake preparedness against 
serious obligations for health care, roads and other vital services. When the 
earth is quiet, or only issues an occasional palm-shaking tremor, it is easy to 
put earthquake preparedness behind daily pressing needs. The Bay Area 
earthquake should serve as a timely reminder that the county needs to put a 
high priority on readiness for the major quake that seismologists tell us will 
hit Southern California. Whether that will be a time of finger-pointing for 
things not done, or a time to thank planners for thinking ahead, is up to 
today's board. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, the board, to its credit, ordered a study that detailed a 
$12-million preparedness plan. It voted in 1987 to go ahead with $3 million 
worth of the plan, but it did not follow through with adequate funding or even 
check to see the progress. As a result, less than half of the measures have 
been carried out by county departments. Still unfunded is $1.6 million for 
emergency generators for county buildings that would enable vitally needed 
services to be carried out in the event of a power outage. 
</P>
<P>
County Administrative Officer Larry Parrish said last week he assumed the 
supervisors knew there wasn't enough money for implementation of the $3-million 
plan so he did not bother to include it in budget discussions two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish was right when he said that it is "not realistic" to spend "all of your 
resources getting ready for Judgment Day." And he even was right when he said 
that it would be unfair to suggest that Orange County would be ready for such a 
quake even if it spent the full $12 million for preparedness. Earthquakes have 
a way of humbling even the most ambitious preparedness plans. 
</P>
<P>
But, as the San Francisco quake clearly illustrates, much can be done to be 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish was wrong to let up on the pressure on the supervisors. He should have 
kept reminding them of their commitment to finance those things they said were 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the board will re-evaluate the county's preparedness. Now, before 
complacency sets in once again, is the time to move forward with the plan 
already approved by the board.

WHITE SINGERS LEARN THE BLACK GOSPEL BEAT; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: A LONG BEACH PASTOR PROMOTES RACIAL HARMONY BY SHARING RELIGIOUS CULTURE 
IN PREPARATION FOR A CONCERT NOV. 19. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The rafters at St. John Baptist Church in Long Beach received a thorough 
shaking on a recent Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
First came the rousing strains of such popular gospel numbers as "I'm Blessed" 
and "Follow Me." Then, singing a tune called "Holy, Holy," the choir practiced 
marching up the aisle behind director Johnie Mae Chambers. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you going to show us how to walk now?" one singer asked. "You haven't done 
that yet." 
</P>
<P>
"Give a little shoulder movement," responded Preston Sterling, Chambers' 
assistant. "You're just gonna slide." 
</P>
<P>
Later Chambers advised the group to practice at home by "walking the holy holy" 
during household chores because, she said, it "looks like we're gonna need lots 
of practice." And some choir members expressed the frustration of doing 
something that not too many before them have ever done. "I'm having trouble 
with the time," Lorraine Roberts said. "I'm used to singing with music." 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to an unusual experiment in interracial harmony and the first step in a 
grand vision by the Rev. Ralph J. Mosby, a black minister. His idea: to promote 
racial understanding through the sharing of religious culture. More 
immediately, his goal is to teach white people how to sing the gospel like 
blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to do something creative to draw us all together," said Mosby, the 
pastor of St. John Baptist and president of the South Coast Ecumenical Council. 
An interdenominational group with members from 100 churches in Long Beach, 
Carson and the Palos Verdes Peninsula, the council's goal is to promote ethnic 
and religious understanding in the areas that it serves. 
</P>
<P>
As the spiritual leader of a mostly black congregation, Mosby saw an 
opportunity to do that through music. Like other black church choirs, he said, 
St. John's sings in a uniquely black style that has evolved through generations 
into a genre called "black gospel." According to Mosby, it speaks of his 
people's heartfelt experience from slavery to the ongoing struggle for 
equality. But the music's message is universal, he said. So why not put 
together an interracial black gospel choir whose members and audience would 
expand their horizons by learning from each other through the sharing of music? 
</P>
<P>
Mosby's original vision called for a 500-voice ensemble that would put on a 
concert in downtown Long Beach's historic First Congregational Church on Nov. 
19. The concert date still stands. But the number of respondents -- 
representing churches throughout the area -- has been disappointing, the pastor 
said. And rather than the racial diversity he envisioned, Mosby said, the vast 
majority of singers attending the regular rehearsals scheduled at various area 
churches have been white. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't be disheartened," he told the 15 singers, mostly members of their own 
church choirs, gathered on a recent Saturday morning. "You just do what you 
have to do and have a joyous time in the Lord." 
</P>
<P>
Mosby said he still expects to have 50 to 100 singers by Nov. 19, including a 
large number of blacks who are not attending rehearsals because they already 
know the music. Eventually, he said, he hopes to expand the project to include 
the music and participation of other ethnic and religious groups. But for now, 
he said, it would be nice to have more black singers on hand to help 
demonstrate their musical style to the whites. 
</P>
<P>
"We want (the choir) to learn the rhythms and tonalities of black gospel," 
Mosby said. "Black people have grown up with it." 
</P>
<P>
One obstacle, according to Chambers, an experienced black gospel singer who is 
St. John's minister of music, is that white people tend to clap on the downbeat 
while blacks clap on the upbeat. Another, she said, is the general stiffness of 
the whites as they attempt to perform in an unfamiliar style. And a third, she 
said, is their customary dependence on sheet music as opposed to the 
unstructured sing-it-from-the-heart style in which black gospel is generally 
performed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult," conceded Jean Gebhart, a white singer from Wesley United 
Methodist Church in Long Beach. "We're used to sticking to written music and 
here we just learn as we go along." 
</P>
<P>
Said Chambers: "I don't want it sung pretty. We're making a definite statement; 
we're trying to get them to walk, clap and move their feet." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the whites seem to be enjoying the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's wonderful," Gebhart said. "It's a chance to get to know other 
people and be part of something ecumenical." 
</P>
<P>
Said Mabel Thomas, from First Christian Church of San Pedro: Black gospel 
singers "sing it like they mean it. They really sing it like they're talking to 
the Lord and we could use a little of that." 
</P>
<P>
While the white singers have made remarkable strides, Chambers said, they still 
have a way to go before becoming black gospel artists. "Everybody has it in 
them," she said, "we just need to bring it out." 
</P>
<P>
And what of the characteristic walking, clapping and swaying that usually 
accompanies black gospel music and stems from something commonly referred to as 
"soul?" Chambers smiled and shook her head slightly. "It could be better," she 
said, "we're having a little rhythm problem, but I think rehearsal will take 
care of that."

GOLF COURSE PLAN IN HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a recent Huntington Beach Town Hall meeting, Lynn Shackelford of American 
Golf Corp. assured concerned citizens that there would be no problem getting 
water for the "wall-to-wall irrigation" of their proposed golf course in 
Central Park. According to Shackelford, if future shortages develop, the water 
will be taken from allocations for agriculture and there will be no water 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach City Council would be well advised to examine this 
situation in light of the recent water rationing announced by San Clemente 
officials. Each of San Clemente's two municipal courses uses 600,000 gallons of 
"reclaimed" water per day. 
</P>
<P>
While our neighbors to the south are planning to conserve water, we're planning 
to use our municipal drinking water for "wall-to-wall irrigation" of a golf 
course! This water will be provided to American Golf at a reduced rate, a cost 
that will be subsidized by residential users of water in the city.

MEASURE M'S IMPACT ON COUNTY'S TRAFFIC, TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sharen Heath opposes Measure M (Oct. 22) because it uses a sales tax to raise 
revenue instead of a gas tax. 
</P>
<P>
I agree that we should be paying for streets, roads and highways with an 
increase in the gas tax. But does she realize that it would take about a 
50-cent increase, (up from the present 9 cents per gallon), to raise the same 
amount of money as a half-cent sales tax increase? I think anyone would 
recognize that a 50-cent increase in the gas tax for Orange County alone would 
place an intolerable burden on our retailers of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
I am a strong advocate of an increased gas tax at the state level. This does 
not mean that Orange County can fail to pay its fair share. We are surrounded 
by counties that have already enacted a half-cent sales tax for transportation. 
We will be unable to compete for state and federal matching funds if we defeat 
Measure M. 
</P>
<P>
California was once a leader in transportation in the nation. We are now ranked 
50th, the bottom, in per capita spending for transportation. Orange County 
ranks 43rd out of 58 counties in the state in per capita spending. It is time 
to stop blaming others, assume responsibility and pay for what we get. So far 
we have paid for congestion and a disintegrating infrastructure.

IRVINE'S MEASURE N AND THE ISSUES OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND PRIVACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rev. Louis P. Sheldon's response (Oct. 15) to the editorial entitled "The 
Freedom to Decide" was, to say the least, quite interesting. 
</P>
<P>
The crux of his argument is that homosexuality is not prescribed in the genetic 
code. My question for the reverend is: Since when is bigotry contained in the 
genetic code? 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon states that the act of sodomy is the underlying connection of 
homosexuals. And I ask: Is prejudice not the common link of bigots? And most 
unfortunately, I know of no reparative therapy or medical treatment for those 
who desire change.

IRVINE'S MEASURE N AND THE ISSUES OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND PRIVACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It disturbs us that both proponents and opponents of Irvine's Measure N have 
chosen to play on the fears of the voters. Opponents say if you support Measure 
N, then you are a religious and political extremist and a gay and lesbian 
basher. Supporters say that if you oppose Measure N, then you advocate 
destruction of family and church and promote deviant sexual activity. Neither 
position is supported by the facts. Both positions are wrong morally and 
legally. Measure N is not a civil rights issue, it is a privacy issue. 
</P>
<P>
Should we create special legal categories to protect people because of their 
sexual behavior? Do we add to the affirmative action programs "sexual 
orientation" as a special protected category? Gay activists say that they are 
discriminated against like racial religious minorities. How do we know if we 
are discriminating? 
</P>
<P>
The Human Rights Ordinance insists that we recognize "sexual orientation" and 
disclose it to our employers, landlords and government institutions to prevent 
discrimination. If sexual practices are a basis for special recognition in the 
law, then why not other behaviors? The law does discriminate against certain 
behaviors. It discriminates against and regulates the behavior of smokers, drug 
users and alcohol abusers. Aren't their behaviors equally in need of special 
protection? 
</P>
<P>
It is unquestionably wrong to persecute or discriminate against gays, lesbians 
and bisexuals. They deserve the full protection of the law because they are 
ordinary citizens, but not because of their sexual behavior. Without the 
language of "sexual orientation" in the Human Rights Ordinance, the law 
protects and reaffirms the protection of fundamental rights of all citizens 
guaranteed by the U.S. and state constitutions. 
</P>
<P>
Measure N is not a civil rights issue, it is a behavior issue. The right of 
privacy protects our sexual behavior from invasion by others. Present law 
grants the right of privacy and decriminalizes sexual practices. Our sexual 
practices are protected from disclosure. But the Human Rights ordinance invades 
that privacy. 
</P>
<P>
No one's sexual conduct is entitled to special legal protections. The right of 
privacy becomes immediately invaded when our employers, landlords and 
government must look into our homes to check our sexual orientation in order to 
prevent discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
You are neither a sinner nor a bigot if you vote Yes on N. A Yes vote will keep 
your sexual orientation your own business, not the city's. A Yes vote on N 
preserves civil rights by protecting the rights of persons based on their life 
status or religious beliefs, not their behavior. Protect your freedom and your 
privacy. Vote Yes on N.

IRVINE'S MEASURE N AND THE ISSUES OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND PRIVACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christina L. Shea's Commentary (Oct. 22) in defense of Measure N is fraught 
with the hypocrisy, contradiction and legal ignorance characteristic of the 
entire campaign by the Irvine Values Coalition to trash Irvine's Human Rights 
Ordinance. It is hypocritical, as well as illogical, for Shea to claim that the 
ordinance is unnecessary because there is no discrimination against homosexuals 
in Irvine. How absurd! The coalition's campaign clearly shows -- in word and 
deed -- that latent discrimination against homosexuals is all too abundant in 
Irvine. We dare not imagine how fashionable it will become to openly manifest 
such attitudes if the "sexual orientation" clause of the ordinance is repealed. 
</P>
<P>
The question of whether homosexuality is behavior-based or an innate 
characteristic is legally irrelevant. We do not need to decide whether one is 
born a homosexual or becomes one in order to treat homosexuals as a protected 
minority. 
</P>
<P>
Protection against discrimination neither implies nor creates "special rights" 
or "affirmative action requirement." To reject Measure N is to affirm our 
collective belief in the right of all individuals to lead lives free from 
unwarranted governmental intrusion and discrimination. Irvine's Human Rights 
Ordinance cannot eliminate Shea's suspicion and hatred of homosexuals, but it 
can prevent those attitudes from determining the course of local public policy.

NFL SUPERMAN NOT REACHING THEIR USUAL HEIGHTS THIS SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY LARIMER, ALLENTOWN MORNING CALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They're known as "athletes," as if the rest of the quarterbacks in the National 
Football League have trouble getting out of a huddle without tripping. 
</P>
<P>
They're known as "prototypes" of the NFL quarterback of the future, as if Roger 
Staubach and Fran Tarkenton never played the game. 
</P>
<P>
And they're both called "Superman," although both are acting more like Clark 
Kent these days. 
</P>
<P>
They're John Elway and Randall Cunningham, and they are the worst nightmares of 
defensive coaches in the NFL. They specialize in turning beastly plays into 
beauties with their improvising, their nimble feet and their rifle arms. 
</P>
<P>
And about the only thing they wanted to say Thursday was that although they'll 
both be on the field at Mile High Stadium in Denver Sunday, they won't be 
playing each other -- or even paying that much attention to each other, for 
that matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think John Elway and I are looking at it like that," Cunningham said 
when asked about Sunday's showdown between the two quarterbacks everyone seems 
to think are the most athletic in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"All this prototype thing is blown out of proportion," Cunningham insisted, 
noting there are many other athletic quarterbacks in the league, including a 
newly emerging one, Green Bay's Don Majkowski. 
</P>
<P>
Elway, in a conference call with the Eagles' press corps, said, "The press 
always makes a big thing about quarterback versus quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
He agreed with Cunningham that whoever had the best game between the two 
quarterbacks Sunday would probably win the game, but added, "That's the case in 
just about any football game." 
</P>
<P>
The pair had nothing but nice things to say about each other, as might be 
expected the week before they meet. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, who has been compared with Elway ever since he broke in as a 
starting quarterback, said, "I thought when you're compared to John Elway, that 
was a compliment. I like his style, he's low-key and not controversial. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been to the Super Bowl twice. Unfortunately, he hasn't won one, but give 
him time. He'll get one." 
</P>
<P>
Elway said he had only seen Cunningham play in two Monday night games. "I've 
been impressed with him. He's a better runner than I am. He has great speed and 
a very strong arm." 
</P>
<P>
The two have more than that in common this season, however. Both are having 
off-seasons statistically, both seem to be running less and both are winning 
more. The Broncos sport a 6-1 record and a three-game lead in the AFC West, 
while the Eagles are 5-2 and trying to keep pace with the 6-1 New York Giants 
in the NFC East. 
</P>
<P>
Elway said that, at least in his case, his numbers are off because his team is 
running better. Cunningham said that as long as his team is running and 
winning, he's not going to complain about poor passing numbers, either. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't been throwing nearly as much because now we have a running game," 
Elway said. "My objective is to go out and win. I'm not going to worry about it 
(his quarterback rating)." 
</P>
<P>
Elway's running numbers also fell off last season, something he attributed to 
leg injuries. "I'm as healthy now as I have been in a couple of years," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He's picked up 107 yards on 26 carries, including runs of 29 and 31 yards. But 
the Broncos sport a decent 1-2 running punch of Bobby Humphrey and Sammy Winder 
that enables them to control the ball without having to resort to their passing 
game as they have in the past. 
</P>
<P>
And, Elway said, that he and Cunningham are running less might have something 
to do with the fact that they're improving as quarterbacks. "It'll decrease as 
time goes on and we're more comfortable with our offenses. You often scramble 
because you're not sure what you're doing when you're back there." 
</P>
<P>
Denver Coach Dan Reeves said there's little to choose between the two 
quarterbacks. "I think both of them are outstanding and we're fortunate to have 
athletes like that at quarterback."

FOR OPENERS SOCKERS TAKE SIDE KICKING; 
</P>
<P>
SOCCER: WHILE TATU WAS GIVING THE CROWD THE SHIRT OFF HIS BACK THE SOCKERS WERE 
BEING UNDRESSED IN THEIR SEASON OPENER AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

DALLAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every time Tatu gave the fans the shirt off his back Saturday night, it was a 
reminder to the Sockers that this is a new season and they are no longer 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
He reminded them five times, throwing his jersey into the stands after each 
goal he scored. Five goals. Five jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
So it was a typical season opener for the Sockers, who were dismantled by the 
Dallas Sidekicks, 9-3, in front of 10,782 at Reunion Arena. The Sockers have 
won just one road opener in their indoor history. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it happens every year in San Diego," goalie Victor Nogueira said. 
"It's natural for you to be cocky after you've won the championship." 
</P>
<P>
Said defender Kevin Crow: "We don't start off with the right kind of intensity 
that the other teams do. We ponder (our decisions) for a while, saying 'Do I 
want to go there? Do I want to make that run?' People that think quickly and 
react quickly are usually going to have a better night." 
</P>
<P>
That explains it. Maybe the Sockers were still thinking a little bit about how 
they defeated this team in the playoffs last season and then went on to win 
their seventh championship. All the while, Tatu, leading scorer in Sidekicks' 
history, was thinking how much better he feels this year. His confidence wasn't 
all there last season, following a year of rehabilitation on his right knee, 
which he injured on the first game of the 87-88 season. 
</P>
<P>
"I have my speed back," said Tatu, whose five goals were a career high. "I'm 
not a step slow like I was last year. I feel I'm healthy." 
</P>
<P>
In the early part of the game there was a lot of give and take. Tatu gave 
Dallas a 1-0 lead midway through the first quarter, drilling a shot under 
Nogueira's right hand off an assist from midfielder Mark Karpun. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers came right back less than three minutes later when Branko Segota 
was in perfect position to score off a deflection from Sidekick defender Wes 
McLeod. Rookie Rod Castro put the Sockers ahead, 2-1, with his first Major 
Indoor Soccer League goal. But not long after his bright smile faded, McLeod 
scored to tie the score again. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers hurt themselves with penalties during the remainder of the half. 
Zoran Karic (charging) and Waad Hirmez (pushing) served two-minutes in the box 
and the Sidekicks capitalized, forward Steve Kinsey and Tatu each scoring to 
make it 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
Socker Coach Ron Newman elected to pull Nogueira and put in a sixth attacker at 
the end of the half. Brian Quinn donned the oversized jersey and did some 
flashy footwork in front of McLeod before sending a left-footed shot through 
goalie Krys Sobieski's legs with 55 seconds remaining in the half. If it was a 
championship team that disappeared into the locker room for intermission, it 
was something a good deal less than that that returned in the second half. The 
offense went flat and the defense just sat. 
</P>
<P>
Sidekick Mike Powers scored with a minute to go in the third quarter. Tatu 
scored three in a row in the fourth. And defender Troy Snyder wrapped things up 
with a goal in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Sockers are so used to starting the season this way that this 
really can't be too much of a concern, right coach? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, but nine goals?" Newman asked. "If you're going to get beat, I thought 
you might get beat by a goal or two if you're not ready. It looked like we were 
manhandled by them. Our regulars weren't ready to mix it." 
</P>
<P>
Still, for the Sockers there is consolation in history. In nine previous 
seasons of starting at or below .500 in the first 10 games, they have come back 
to win five championships. So there weren't too many long faces Saturday. 
Players were critical, but also confident that the questions left over from 
this inauspicious debut can soon be answered. 
</P>
<P>
"It was more or less like a day at the beach," defender George Fernandez said. 
"We were pretty flat." 
</P>
<P>
After a whole summer of thinking about losing to the Sockers in the seventh 
game of the last season's semifinals, the Sidekicks were determined to make 
sure the Sockers left the beach with a nice burn. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been waiting for this game all off-season," Powers said. "It seemed 
every day during training camp somebody mentioned the opener. I think that made 
us more aggressive than them."

A 63 PUSHES LEVI INTO ONE-SHOT LEAD; 
</P>

AFTER SHOOTING A 74.

<P>
Wayne Levi didn't regard his round of golf as exceptional Saturday, saying 
nonchalantly, "I was just playing along." 
</P>
<P>
It was, however, exceptional by any standard. 
</P>
<P>
Levi shot an eight-under-par 63 in the third round of the Nabisco Championships 
at Harbour Town Golf Links, tying records in the process. 
</P>
<P>
On a chilly, overcast day, Tom Kite, who had a four-stroke lead after 36 holes, 
came back to the field, but remained in contention. 
</P>
<P>
However, Levi, a 36-year-old pro, who earnestly plays the stock market, is the 
front-runner now. His 54-hole score of 206 has provided him with a one-shot 
lead over Donnie Hammond. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kite, who soared to a 74 after shooting a six-under-par 65 Friday, is at 
208, while Fred Couples, Greg Norman and Mark O'Meara are at 209. 
</P>
<P>
Levi had eight birdies without a bogey on his round. He had a 30 on the front 
nine, equaling the course record. And his 63 also tied the Harbour Town record 
held by Jack Nicklaus, Denis Watson and Jim Hallet. 
</P>
<P>
Levi, who was 29th on the money-winning list coming into the tournament and 
barely qualified for the 30-man field, said he has been playing well this year, 
but has squandered strokes. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't squander any Saturday and got a big lift when he chipped into the cup 
from 40 feet off the green for a birdie on the par-four, 439-yard eighth hole. 
That was his fifth birdie and he got three more. 
</P>
<P>
With a first-place paycheck of $450,000 awaiting the winner of the tournament, 
one would assume that there is considerable pressure on Levi going into today's 
final round. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't look at it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a lot of pressure," Levi said. "I'm going to make a big check no 
matter what." 
</P>
<P>
There is seemingly plenty for everyone with a Nabisco purse of $2.5 million. 
The second-place finisher gets $270,000, with third-, fourth- and fifth-place 
finishes worth $172,000, $120,000 and $100,000, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't won a tournament since 1985, but I had a lot of good chances to win 
tournaments this year, but just let them get away," Levi said. "I've been happy 
with my play generally. 
</P>
<P>
"There really isn't the pressure here that there is other tournaments like the 
Masters, or the U.S. Open. I don't know if it's because there's a lot more 
hype, or a lot more people around in those tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Levi conceded, though, that blowing a shot today could cost him $50,000, or 
making one would make up $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what's fun," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Levi also has the incentive of making up for his stock market losses on paper. 
</P>
<P>
"I need the money. I need to cover my margin calls from the last mini crash," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Levi said he won't beat his brains out for another $5,000 if he happens to 
slip below the first 15 finishers. 
</P>
<P>
"But if you're near the top, that's a different story," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kite set the tone for his round when his drive off the first tee went out of 
bounds. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a little shocker. It wasn't a good shot, but it didn't deserve to go 
out of bounds," Kite said. "It was right down the tree line and caught one of 
the low branches." 
</P>
<P>
Kite wound up with a double bogey on the par-four, 397-yard opening hole, not 
the most demanding on the course. 
</P>
<P>
He got back to even par for the round with birdies on the second and ninth 
holes. But then he had three consecutive bogeys from the 12th through the 14th 
holes. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't play very well today. That should be fairly obvious by my score," 
Kite said. "It was just one of those days, similar to what Curtis (Strange) had 
yesterday with his 75. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit a few poor shots today that cost me. And the good shots I hit didn't 
turn out very well. But I'm still in a very good position." 
</P>
<P>
So is Hammond, the first day leader with a 65. He lost the lead with a 73 
Friday, but shot a two-under-par 69 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I played real well again today, just like I played the first day," Hammond 
said. "I drove the ball really well and that made a lot of holes really easy. 
</P>
<P>
"But those last couple of holes got me again." 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the par-three, 169-yard 17th and the par-four, 458-yard 
18th. Both holes are near Calibogue Sound, where the wind was whipping up later 
in the day. Wind, however, wasn't as much of a factor overall as it was Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond bogeyed the last three holes Friday. He bogeyed the final two holes 
Saturday, but got a birdie at No. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of being intimidated by those holes, Hammond said he expects to do 
better on themtoday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping that 16, 17 and 18 owe me something," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Couples, who shot a four-under-par 67, was paired with Levi. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fun watching him play," Couples said. "He had a fantastic round. He 
made it look easy. I had a pretty good round myself, but if I hadn't played 
with Wayne, it would have looked a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
Norman, who had a 74 Friday, is back in the hunt now with his 68. 
</P>
<P>
"Today was the day you just wanted to get yourself back in contention," he 
said. "It'sa major championship with a lot of money and a lot of pride on the 
line." 
</P>
<P>
Levi, the stock market plunger, is mainly interested in the money. 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Scott Hoch and Payne Stewart came in at 210. Stewart, the tour's leading money 
winner, shot a 71. Ted Schulz, Paul Azinger, Dave Rummells and Curtis Strange 
are tied at 211. Like Tom Kite, Strange had a double bogey on the first hole. 
"It isn't the way you want to start your day," he said.

MORNING BRIEFING: THIS SOVIET STAKES HER CLAIM IN VANCOUVER SUPERMARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARR KLUENDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How is life in the West for Soviet players in the National Hockey League and 
their wives? 
</P>
<P>
Robert Fachet of the Washington Post writes: "Lena Larionov, whose husband, 
Igor, is a center for the Vancouver Canucks, was returning from an outing with 
Jennifer Smyl, wife of Vancouver captain Stan, when they stopped at a 
supermarket to buy milk. 
</P>
<P>
"Lena, accustomed to food shortages in Moscow, saw the meat cabinets and began 
to fill her shopping cart with beef. She told the bewildered Jennifer, 'You 
must buy it while it's here.' It took a lot of persuasion before she believed 
it would still be there the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"Left wing Vladimir Krutov participated in his first practice with Vancouver 
and, when the 90-minute session ended, he asked Coach Bob McCammon what was 
next. Told the team was through for the day, Krutov thought he was being teased 
and said, 'No, I can't believe that.' 
</P>
<P>
"McCammon said: 'One of the big adjustments for them is all the free time they 
find themselves with. In the Soviet Union, everything was regimented. They rose 
at 8, brushed their teeth, ate breakfast, practiced, watched videos, ate lunch, 
practiced, had conditioning drills, ate supper, had an hour to call their wives 
and went to bed. That was for 11 months of the year.' " 
</P>
<P>
Add Soviets: Said Philadelphia Flyer General Manager Bobby Clarke of the Soviet 
players: "They don't belong here . . . they shouldn't be playing in our league. 
It's ridiculous. It's absolutely stupid. I'm totally against having them in our 
league. Why should Russians come over here, get paid a lot of money and take 
away jobs from Canadian and American players?" 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who were the only two World Series managers who never lost a game? 
</P>
<P>
No-basis oasis: Burt Grossman of the Chargers on playing in the heat against 
the Cardinals in Phoenix: "In the two-minute drill, I got so tired that I 
started seeing mirages. I remember I saw a swimming pool with a bunch of beer 
on ice -- no lie -- right about the 50." 
</P>
<P>
The dome curse: Vito Stellino of the Baltimore Sun on the Herschel Walker 
trade: "The Vikings with Walker might not be much different than the Vikings 
without Walker -- a contending team, but not a Super Bowl team. 
</P>
<P>
"But the Vikings have two things going against them in that quest. The first is 
that they don't have a great quarterback. Neither Wade Wilson nor Tommy Kramer 
qualifies. The second is that they play in a domed stadium and a dome team has 
yet to get to the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Add trade: Pro Football Weekly's Jerry Magee: "When you have (Viking General 
Manager) Mike Lynn matched against (Cowboy owner) Jerry Jones, you have to make 
Lynn odds-on. 
</P>
<P>
"Back up that turnip truck that Jones must have ridden in on. Jerry's going for 
another ride, courtesy of Mike Lynn." 
</P>
<P>
Last add trade: Lynn on selling Walker and his wife on living in Minnesota: 
"They really didn't know anything about this state and, like most Americans, 
think this is Siberia." 
</P>
<P>
The Fitchburg State watch: The Falcons' emotional letdown apparently continued 
as Framingham State rolled to a 37-16 victory Saturday. Fitchburg State is 1-7. 
</P>
<P>
There ought to be a law: During an interview on WHYY-FM in Philadelphia, Terry 
Gross asked Oakland Athletic Manager Tony La Russa if having a law degree 
helped when La Russa argued with umpires. Said La Russa: "Nothing comes in 
handy when you're arguing with an umpire." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Hank Bauer (4-0) guided the Baltimore Orioles to a sweep of the 
Dodgers in 1966. George Stallings (4-0) led the Boston Braves' sweep of the 
Philadelphia Athletics in 1914.

<P>
The Cincinnati Reds open the National League's 1990 season April 2 against the 
Houston Astros in the Reds' traditional home opener. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time since 1978 that the Reds and Astros have played on 
opening day. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds will be trying for their eighth consecutive opening day victory, 
having defeated Atlanta, New York, Montreal, Philadelphia, Montreal, St. Louis 
and Los Angeles the past seven seasons in openers. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds, who date their origin to 1869, traditionally open the National 
League's season at home each year as baseball's oldest professional team. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 opener will mark the 104th time in the Reds' 106 seasons in the 
National League that the team has opened a season at home. In 1877 and 1966, 
the Reds started the season on the road because of rainouts at home. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds beat Houston 11-9 in the 1978 season opener and also defeated Houston 
in the 1976 opener. The Astros won the only other opener between the teams, in 
1964. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 opener begins a three-game series with Houston. The Reds said they 
will announcetheir full 1990 home schedule soon. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds skidded to fifth place in the National League West this season after 
four consecutive second-place finishes. Cincinnati's 75-87 record was its first 
losing record since going 70-92 in 1984.

IT'S TIME TO GET READY FOR A NEW BALLGAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN CHAD, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You're sitting in a Hilton, Sheraton or Westin in Los Angeles, Chicago or 
Washington. You're exhausted, and there's nothing on the TV. So you decide to 
take the pay-TV plunge: For $5.95, your choices are "No Way Out" or a soft-porn 
flick or ... the Denver Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the brave new world of ordering the NBA as room service. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend two black Chicago businessmen joined with Washington-based 
Communications Satellite Corp. (Comsat) to purchase the NBA Nuggets for $54 
million. Not only did the deal mark a major advance for minorities in the 
business of professional sports, but it also signaled the next major step in 
sports television: pay-per-view. 
</P>
<P>
Comsat came into the picture at the request of NBA Commissioner David Stern. 
Partners Peter C.B. Bynoe and Bertram M. Lee were faltering in their attempt to 
buy the Nuggets, so Stern contacted Robert Wussler, Ted Turner's longtime top 
gun at TBS and the newly appointed chief executive officer of Comsat Video 
Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
"I think David was looking to provide some help to these people at the 11th 
hour, took a flyer, picked up the phone and called me," Wussler said. 
</P>
<P>
Wussler then huddled with Comsat officials -- "It shocked them," he said of the 
idea of owning an NBA team -- and finalized the deal that put the international 
communications satellite company onto the hardwood. The key selling point: that 
the Nuggets represented a key programming acquisition in Comsat's attempt to 
reverse losses in its financially troubled entertainment subsidiary that 
primarily puts pay movies into hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Turner once marketed the Atlanta Braves as America's Team. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Wussler will market the Denver Nuggets as, well, Ramada's Team. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the pay-per-view business," Wussler said of his new employers. "I'm a 
strong believer in pay-per-view. The opportunity to put Denver Nuggets games 
and other NBA games into these hotel rooms is tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
A handful of teams have been involved in broadcasting ownership. Some teams own 
stations -- the NBA Celtics just bought a radio and TV station, for instance, 
and the NHL Sabres just sold the TV station they owned. Some teams own cable 
facilities -- MSG with the NBA Knicks and NHL Rangers, Home Sports 
Entertainment with the baseball Astros. Some stations own teams -- WGN and the 
baseball Cubs, TBS and the NBA Hawks. But Comsat's Nuggets interest would take 
the franchise-broadcast link to a new level. 
</P>
<P>
Pay-per-view is not new to the NBA. At least four teams -- Portland, Dallas, 
Houston and San Antonio -- have experimented with it, according to the NBA's Ed 
Desser. In San Antonio and Portland, for instance, viewers can subscribe to a 
package of games for a flat rate or buy single games. But pay-per-view never 
has been targeted on a national scale like Wussler's Nuggets intend. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Wussler plays down any comparision between the Comsat-Nuggets deal and 
Turner's earlier franchise purchases. When Turner bought the baseball Braves 
and NBA Hawks, they essentially were programming acquisitions for what became 
one of America's most-watched superstations. "But I'm not putting this in a 
mainstream distribution center. I'm not putting this on a network," Wussler 
said. "I'm just trying to put this on a pay-per-view basis at three or six or 
nine dollars. I don't know what the answer is (in regards to pricing). I do 
know that movies in hotel rooms work. Now I'd like to see if we can sell other 
programming." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure how viable a tool (the Nuggets) will be as a pay-per-view vehicle 
in hotel rooms," said John Mansell, an analyst at the media consulting firm 
Paul Kagan Associates. "I guess it might be a good late-night option." 
</P>
<P>
According to Mansell, 12 or 13 percent of hotel guests use in-room pay movies 
when they're available. Of those, 75 percent plug into the soft-porn features, 
which generally are viewed by an overwhelmingly male audience. So Doug Moe and 
the Nuggets would offer these men a sporting alternative to skin flicks. What 
Wussler needs to do is convince hotels that Comsat's film and sports offerings 
are a better option than its main competitor, Spectradyne. Comsat currently is 
in about 300,000 hotel rooms to Spectradyne's 600,000. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the Nuggets, it might seem logical for Comsat to engage the rest of the 
league in putting selected games on hotel pay-per-view. Comsat has the 
technical capacity to do this. So in turning to Wussler, Stern might be giving 
the NBA a toehold in the future of pay-per-view. (Stern was in Rome much of the 
week after the McDonald's Open and unavailable for comment.) 
</P>
<P>
"I think the league has been encouraging, and to the extent the league wants to 
experiment, I want to help," Wussler said. " ... The league has a good shot of 
taking games around the world electronically, and we want to be in a position 
to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Wussler said Comsat's pay-per-view approach with the Nuggets won't threaten or 
harm the NBA's network and cable packages. "This is an additive, a way for some 
clubs to broaden their in-stadium marketing. ... The league would get a piece, 
the other team would get a piece and Denver would get a piece." 
</P>
<P>
The Nuggets could be in hotels some time this season. Further Wussler is 
talking about Comsat expanding into other sports acquisitions. Suddenly 
America's innkeepers might become America's most sophisticated sporting arenas.

CRIMSON TIDE, AFTER REACHING LOW EBB, ON RISE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON MARKUS, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The low point came last year. It was homecoming at the University of Alabama. 
It was the day that a museum honoring the legendary Bear Bryant opened on the 
Tuscaloosa campus, the day the Crimson Tide lost to Ole Miss, 22-12, the day a 
rock came crashing through a window of second-year coach Bill Curry's house. 
</P>
<P>
The high point came last week. National television cameras, and sixth-ranked 
Tennessee, were at Legion Field in Birmingham, ready to see if Alabama's 5-0 
start was merely the result of loading up the early-season schedule with 
non-conference opponents such as Memphis State and Southwestern Louisiana and 
Southeastern Conference games such as Kentucky and Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure it was perceived as the biggest win we've had the last couple of 
years," Curry said of Alabama's 47-30 victory over the Volunteers. "But I can't 
say. There have been so many." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, there have been many great victories in the storied history of 
Alabama football. But in the three seasons since Curry arrived from Georgia 
Tech, a move that brought former university president Joab Thomas a couple of 
death threats for hiring a coach with a 31-43-1 record, the defeats have been 
more glaring. 
</P>
<P>
There was a 13-10 loss to Memphis State in the fifth game of the 1987 season. 
</P>
<P>
There were the successive defeats to state rival Auburn the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Even some victories, such as last season's 29-28 Sun Bowl win over Army, were 
treated with disdain. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned that if you just don't quit, you can outlast most problems," Curry 
said Tuesday from Tuscaloosa. 
</P>
<P>
Though Alabama is 6-0 and ranked sixth heading into Penn State territory 
Saturday, the problems have not gone away. Despite his team's early success 
this season, there is still an undercurrent of uncertainty surrounding Curry's 
job security. But that is nothing new for Curry. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never paid much attention to what other people say about me," said Curry, 
46, who is in the third year of a five-year contract. "If I did, I would have 
never made it through my first week of training camp in the NFL, when I was 
trying out for the Green Bay Packers in 1965. It was funny to people that I 
would try out for that team. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always started out as the underdog. When I was a player, people thought I 
was too small or too slow or not strong enough. Then, as a coach, I wasn't the 
right one for the job. The only asset I have is that I keep working hard every 
day. That's something I learned from my parents." 
</P>
<P>
But there was nothing to prepare Curry for what happened upon his arrival at 
Alabama. It hardly mattered that Ray Perkins had been there three years and, 
depending on one's perspective, had been either mildly successful (33-15-1) or 
an outright failure (no major bowls or national championships). 
</P>
<P>
A 7-5 record and three straight defeats that first season, as well as a number 
of highly publicized off-campus incidents involving some of Curry's players, 
did not endear the new coach to the community. There were calls to local radio 
shows demanding his resignation. There were nasty, unsigned letters to Curry 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"It got pretty ugly," said one former athletic department official. "This was 
not your typical fire-the-coach kind of thing. There were some around here who 
worried about Bill's safety." 
</P>
<P>
Nor did it help that Thomas stepped down in the summer of 1988 to become a 
university biology professor, a move precipitated in part by the pressure he 
was under after Curry's hiring. Or that Athletic Director Steve Sloan, a close 
friend and coaching rival when both were in the Atlantic Coast Conference, 
resigned last summer because of philosophical differences with Roger Sayers, 
Alabama's new president. 
</P>
<P>
Or that Heisman Trophy candidate Bobby Humphrey opted last spring to forgo his 
senior year to play in the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
But as Curry likes to say, "If you're a mountain climber, you want to climb 
Everest." 
</P>
<P>
The Crimson Tide, behind senior quarterback Gary Hollingsworth, is halfway up 
its mountain. Last week's victory gave Alabama sole possession of first place 
in the SEC and served as Hollingsworth's official coming-out party: After not 
playing a down his first three years, Hollingsworth was 32 of 46 for 379 yards 
passing and three touchdowns against Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most impressive performances I have ever seen by a quarterback," 
said Tennessee Coach Johnny Majors. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from Hollingsworth, one of the biggest reasons for Alabama's turnaround 
this season is offensive coordinator Homer Smith, in his second year. Generally 
regarded by his peers as an offensive innovator, Smith has opened up a game 
plan that had been criticized recently as bland and predictable. 
</P>
<P>
It has opened a lot of eyes, Curry's included.

"The whole approach, and it's not that unusual, is that we want to run a 
balanced offense," said Curry. "In the past, that's meant to run and pass an 
equal number of times. But we want to have the capacity to run or pass wherever 
we are on the field, depending on the situation. It might mean a trap up the 
middle or a post pattern. We want to force the other team to defend the whole 
field." 
</P>
<P>
The Crimson Tide is averaging 423.5 yards of offense, 17th in the nation, 235.7 
passing. The latter stat is the one that frightens Penn State Coach Joe 
Paterno, whose team's pass defense ranks 40th in the country (202.5 yards), 
right between Wake Forest and Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
"They can beat you a lot of different ways," Paterno said Tuesday from State 
College, Pa. "This is the best Alabama team I've seen since 1979." 
</P>
<P>
That was the year Alabama finished 12-0, beat Arkansas in the Sugar Bowl and 
was a unanimous choice as national champion. The same kind of talk has started 
around Tuscaloosa and Birmingham and Mobile.

<P>
SOUTH CAROLINA LOSES ELLIS AND THE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
South Carolina, a big winner over North Carolina State the last two seasons, 
lost more than game Saturday when the 20th-ranked Wolfpack defeated the No. 25 
Gamecocks, 20-10, at Columbia, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina senior quarterback Todd Ellis suffered torn ligaments in his 
left knee on the Gamecocks' first possession and will be lost for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis, seventh on the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. list of career passing 
yardage leaders, had started 43 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
N.C. State quarterback Shane Montgomery led the Wolfpack (7-1) of the Atlantic 
Coast Conference, completing 22 of 31 passes for 294 yards. He teamed with Al 
Byrd on a 31-yard touchdown pass play in the fourth quarter that broke a 10-10 
tie. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd caught Montgomery's pass at about the South Carolina 25-yard line in the 
middle of the field, cut to his left and ran down the sideline, breaking at 
least three tackles. 
</P>
<P>
For South Carolina, Dickie DeMasi, a junior quarterback who had not played this 
season, took over less than two minutes into the game when Ellis was hurt. 
DeMasi, sacked five times, completed only four of 12 passes for 65 yards and 
one interception. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina, an independent, is 5-2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson 44, Wake Forest 10 -- The 22nd-ranked Tigers, scoring on their first 
seven possessions, rolled over the Demon Deacons in an ACC game at Clemson, 
S.C. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Morocco completed nine of 14 passes for 171 yards and two touchdowns in 
the first half as the Tigers, 7-2 overall and 4-2 in the ACC, grabbed a 34-3 
lead. Morocco did not play in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Wake Forest, which last beat the Tigers at Death Valley in 1961, fell to 1-6-1 
and 1-4 after suffering its 13th consecutive loss to Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
Duke 30, Georgia Tech 19 -- Fullback Randy Cuthbert rushed for 234 yards and 
three touchdowns in 32 carries to lead the Blue Devils to an ACC victory at 
Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
With Guthbert scoring on runs of two and 11 yards, Duke led, 17-3, after a 
sloppy first half. The Blue Devils had three turnovers, and the Yellow Jackets 
were assessed 44 yards in penalties while rushing for only 22. 
</P>
<P>
On the Blue Devils' first possession of the second half, Roger Boone scored on 
a 39-yard run to make it 24-3. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech came back to pull within 24-10 on a 59-yard touchdown run by Jerry 
Mays, then cut the margin to 24-17 on Shawn Jones' 28-yard scoring pass play to 
Emmett Merchant. 
</P>
<P>
Cuthbert's third touchdown, coming on a 59-yard run with 6:05 left, gave Duke a 
more comfortable 30-17 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Then on the extra-point attempt, holder Steve Prince could not get the ball 
down, elected to pass and Georgia Tech free safety Ken Swilling intercepted and 
returned the ball 99 yards to give the Yellow Jackets a two-point safety. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland 38, North Carolina 0 -- The Terrapins recorded their most decisive 
victory in five years by shutting out the Tar Heels at College Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second shutout of the season for the Terrapins (3-6 and 2-4). The 
other came six weeks ago when Maryland blanked Western Michigan, 23-0. The 
38-point winning margin was its most decisive since a 43-7 victory over Duke in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
The Tar Heels (1-7 and 0-5) committed six second-half turnovers, including an 
interception by Maryland safety Mike Thomas that was returned 26 yards for a 
touchdown. Thomas' interception return gave Maryland a 21-0 lead 3:33 into the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Tech 30, Tulane 13 -- Inside linebacker Randy Cockrell intercepted two 
passes to set up scores, and outside linebacker Jock Jones returned an 
interception 55 yards for a touchdown to lead the Hokies over the Green Wave at 
Blacksburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Tech held Tulane (2-6) to one yard in net rushing and 182 yards 
passing. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman tailback Vaughn Hebron had 118 yards rushing and gained another 45 
yards on four receptions for Virginia Tech (4-3-1). 
</P>
<P>
Tulane, which had been averaging 380 total yards a game, went into the fourth 
quarter tied with the Hokies, 13-13. 
</P>
<P>
But Virginia Tech went ahead for good after a blocked punt gave Virginia Tech 
possession at the Tulane one. Arche Hopkins got the block, and Taron Page 
recovered it. Quarterback Cam Young dove in from the one for the score. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Tech Coach Frank Beamer, who is recovering from surgery to widen a 
constricted coronary artery, went to Lane Stadium shortly after being released 
from a hospital Saturday and talked briefly to his players. But he went home 
and watched the game on television, leaving assistant coach Billy Hite to run 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
Beamer suffered chest pains last Saturday during the Hokies' 14-10 loss at East 
Carolina, admitted himself to a local hospital the next day and underwent the 
surgery Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia 16, Louisville 15 -- Jake McInerney kicked a 37-yard field goal as 
time expired to give the Cavaliers a victory at Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
McInerney's winning kick, a school-record 12th consecutive field goal, capped 
an 81-yard, 10-play drive by the Cavaliers in the final 3:26 after Louisville 
had gone ahead on a 27-yard field goal by Ron Bell. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia, which had lost to the Cardinals on a final-minute field goal last 
year, improved to 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville (3-4) lost its third consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Mississippi 31, Memphis State 7 -- Brett Favre passed for a 
career-high 345 yards and two touchdowns as the Golden Eagles won at Memphis in 
a battle of independents. 
</P>
<P>
Favre completed 24 of 41 passes, including touchdown passes of 15 and 17 yards 
to Eugene Rowell. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Eagles are 4-5; Memphis State is 2-6. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana Tech 34, Tulsa 31 -- Derrick Douglas rushed for 203 yards in 36 
carries in leading the Bulldogs to a come-from-behind victory over the 
Hurricane at Ruston, La. 
</P>
<P>
Tulsa (5-4) took a 17-0 first-quarter lead, but a 78-yard interception return 
helped Tech (4-3-1) battle back.

WEBB, KELLY LEAD NO. 11 TENNESSEE OVER LSU

<P>
Tennessee Coach Johnny Majors had a hard time singling out a turning point 
Saturday, there were so many. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Webb, who rushed for 134 yards in 30 carries, ran for three touchdowns, 
Greg Amsler scored twice, and Carl Pickens ran a kickoff back 93 yards as the 
11th-ranked Volunteers outlasted Louisiana State, 45-39, at Baton Rouge, La. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee is 6-1 overall and 3-1 in the Southeastern Conference. LSU is 1-6 and 
0-3, the Tigers' worst start since 1956. 
</P>
<P>
"There were so many plays, I can hardly think about when the big play was in a 
game like that," Majors said. "Without a question, the kickoff return had to be 
as big a play as any we've had this year." 
</P>
<P>
LSU led 14-0 at the end of the first quarter, but Tennessee came back to go in 
front, 28-17, early in the third. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteer quarterback Andy Kelly, who during a stretch in the first half had 
nine consecutive completions, led the comeback. 
</P>
<P>
LSU built its early lead on a pair of touchdown pass plays by Tommy Hodson -- 
30 yards to Tony Moss and two yards to Eddie Fuller. 
</P>
<P>
Hodson also hit Fuller with a 23-yard scoring pass midway through the fourth 
quarter and connected with Todd Kinchen for an 11-yard touchdown with 26 
seconds left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Hodson, who holds almost all of LSU's passing records, had his first 300-yard 
passing game and first rushing touchdown. He threw for 438 yards, completing 31 
of 49 passes. 
</P>
<P>
After LSU took a 17-14 lead on a field goal with 19 seconds left in the half, 
Pickens took the ensuing kickoff at his seven-yard line, started up the middle, 
swung to the right sideline and broke into the clear at midfield. He got a key 
block on kicker Pedro Suarez at the 25-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee scored twice in the third quarter, a one-yard plunge by Webb and a 
two-yarder by Amsler sandwiched around Hodson's two-yard scoring sneak for LSU. 
</P>
<P>
Webb scored his final touchdown on a three-yard run in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn 14, Mississippi State 0 -- James Joseph rushed for a career-high 172 
yards and one touchdown in 35 carries in what otherwise was a defensive 
struggle that the No. 16 Tigers won at Auburn, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
After a scoreless first half, Mississippi State was forced to punt from its six 
after taking the second-half kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers quickly drove 48 yards, with quarterback Reggie Slack scoring from 
the two. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph, a redshirt junior, later scored on a one-yard run to cap an 81-yard 
drive that followed a missed 29-yard field-goal attempt by Joel Logan. The kick 
hit the left upright. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn is 4-2 and 3-1; the Bulldogs are 4-3 and 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi 24, Vanderbilt 16 -- For a third consecutive week, Ole Miss used a 
fourth-quarter comeback to pull out a victory, using touchdown runs by Russ 
Shows and Tyrone Ashley in an SEC game at Oxford, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Ole Miss scored a touchdown with 31 seconds to go defeat Georgia 
and then a week ago beat Tulane on a touchdown with four seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
This time around it was a relative laugher. 
</P>
<P>
Ole Miss trailed 10-0 at halftime and 13-10 early in the final quarter against 
nine-point underdog Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
But Mississippi drove 70 yards in 11 plays with Shows, a backup quarterback, 
scoring from three yards on an option play to make it 17-13. Ole Miss went 79 
yards in just four plays for the clinching touchdown, a 16-yard run by Ashley. 
</P>
<P>
Ole Miss, 6-2 overall, its best record at this point since 1971, is 3-1 in the 
SEC. Vanderbilt is 1-6 and 0-5. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia 34, Kentucky 23 -- Rodney Hampton scored touchdowns on runs of 18, 20 
and 35 yards as the Bulldogs continued their domination of the Wildcats in this 
SEC game at Athens, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Bulldogs' 11th victory over the Wildcats in the last 12 years and 
saddled Kentucky with its 15th consecutive road loss in SEC play. 
</P>
<P>
Hampton gained 184 yards in 31 carries and also caught four passes for 43 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Hampton's third touchdown came with 2:45 left in the game and was followed by 
Kentucky's biggest play of the day, a 100-yard kickoff return by Kurt Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia (4-3 and 3-2) got its other touchdown on a 34-yard pass play, Greg 
Talley to Arthur Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky (4-3 and 1-3) hasn't won an SEC road game since beating Tennessee, 
17-2, in 1984.

NFL NOTES; 
</P>
<P>
JETS HEADED IN DIRECTION OF NO. 1 DRAFT PICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG LOGAN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the next National Football League draft were held now, the New York Jets 
would hold in their hands the No. 1 pick, which is something that never 
happened even when the team was called the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Namath? He was the fourth overall pick of the 1965 American Football League 
draft. If form holds, this would be the Jets' first "first." 
</P>
<P>
It's a long season, but the Jets (1-6) may be down to it. The Dallas Cowboys 
(0-7) forfeited their No. 1 pick to take quarterback Steve Walsh in the 
supplemental draft in July. The Detroit Lions also are 1-6, but the Jets would 
choose first based on strength of schedule, which is the tie-breaker in these 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
Four other teams could sink as low as the Jets and Lions, including the 2-5 
Atlanta Falcons, New England Patriots and San Diego Chargers and the 3-4 
Phoenix Cardinals, who have a ton of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the Jets drafted so high was in 1980, when they traded up for the 
No. 2 pick of the draft. The player they wanted was USC tackle Anthony Munoz, 
who has set the standard at the position since he joined the Cincinnati 
Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets were prevented from taking him, former coach Walt Michaels has said, 
because team physician James Nicholas failed Munozm on the physical exam 
because he had undergone reconstructive knee surgery. Instead, the Jets settled 
for Texas wide receiver Johnny "Lam" Jones, which did not turn out well. 
</P>
<P>
But back to the Jets' future and the "awesome responsibility" of picking No. 1. 
It's just the Jets' luck to be very bad in a year when the college crop is 
considered lean. And guess what? The one true blue-chip player in the 
collective opinion of the scouting community, Penn State running back Blair 
Thomas, is coming off reconstructive knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
If it sounds as if Thomas could be the next Munoz-style Jets reject, you've got 
the picture. Joel Buchsbaum, the draft maven for Pro Football Weekly, still 
rates Thomas as the top prospect. "Blair Thomas has run about 4.42 in the 
40-yard dash," Buchsbaum said. "In the last two games, it looks like he's back 
to his old form. The only problem is that he was so brilliant before the injury 
that you expect miracles on every play." 
</P>
<P>
The strongest positions in the draft should be running back and linebacker, but 
after Thomas, there are no so-called "prototype" players. "It's the worst year 
to be up there drafting high," Buchsbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
There have been rumors that West Virginia quarterback Major Harris, Florida 
running back Emmitt Smith and, possibly, Tennessee running back Reggie Cobb all 
may come out early for the draft. But all have drawbacks that could keep them 
from becoming the top pick. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some names to watch from Buchsbaum for all you draftniks, and in the 
case of Jets fans, this guessing game is bound to be more entertaining than the 
rest of the season: 
</P>
<P>
Running back -- Blair Thomas, Penn State; Darrell Thompson, Minnesota; Anthony 
Thompson, Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
Outside linebacker -- James Francis, Baylor; Andre Collins, Penn State; Aaron 
Wallace, Texas A&amp;M; Bobby Houston, North Carolina State. 
</P>
<P>
Inside linebacker -- Percy Snow, Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end -- Renaldo Turnbull, West Virginia; Jeff Alm, Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver -- Reggie Rembert, West Virginia; Rob Moore, Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
Offensive tackle -- Glenn Parker, Arizona; Richmond Webb, Texas A&amp;M. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers-Patriots game Sunday at Stanford Stadium attracted an estimated crowd 
of 75,000 fans eager to celebrate life again after a grim confrontation with 
death resulting from the earthquake that shook the Bay Area Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
But on the second play of the game, 49ers free safety Jeff Fuller suffered a 
neck injury that left his right arm partially paralyzed in a collision with 
Patriots running back John Stephens. 
</P>
<P>
The scene on the field at the time of the injury served as a reminder of the 
earthquake rather than an escape. Medical attendants unscrewed Fuller's 
facemask from his helmet and administered oxygen and attached an IV as he lay 
motionless. 
</P>
<P>
"You think about all that's happened this week, and then, you see your buddy go 
down with eyes as big as golf balls," running back Harry Sydney said. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Fuller's injury isn't as serious as originally feared. He was 
moved out of intensive care Tuesday at Stanford Medical Center. But the muscles 
on the right side of Fuller's neck are torn, and it's feared some nerve endings 
in his fifth and sixth vertebrae may be torn, in which case he never would 
regain the full use of his right arm. Two of his transverse processes, the 
wing-shaped part of the vertebrae, are fractured but will mend, and Fuller has 
regained some movement in his right arm and fingers. 
</P>
<P>
"He has an incredibly positive attitude toward his injury," Dr. James Klint 
said. "He was very realistic. We had some private things we talked about." 
</P>
<P>
Now, residents of the Bay Area have one more survivor to care about, and they 
certainly showed they cared about the earthquake victims. Some luxury-box 
patrons donated their refunds from the 49ers to the San Francisco Earthquake 
Relief Fund. A portion of the proceeds from the 20,000 extra tickets the 49ers 
had available to sell as a result of moving from Candlestick Park to Stanford 
went to the fund, and club owner Edward DeBartolo Jr. made a sizable 
contribution. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue from the sale of game programs went to the American Red Cross, and the 
49ers' players were planning to make a contribution of at least $20,000 to the 
Red Cross. NFL Charities also made a donation of approximately six figures to 
the relief fund. 
</P>
<P>
Around the league 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Cowboys' trading frenzy has left them with 19 picks in the first three 
rounds of the draft over the next three years, and owner Jerry Jones said, "And 
we haven't even traded Steve Walsh yet." Jones also indicated he offered 
running back Herschel Walker to the Philadelphia Eagles straight up for 
defensive end Reggie White and was turned down before trading Walker to the 
Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 49ers cornerback Tim McKyer is back on the active roster after serving 
three games of a four-game suspension for insubordination, but his wallet is 
lighter by about $93,000 in lost wages. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Dolphins lost running back Troy Stradford (knee) for the season, and 
running back Marc Logan (knee) may go on injured reserve, but No. 1 pick Sammie 
Smith (44 carries, 131 yards) says he is 90 percent recovered from a sprained 
ankle and is expected to start Sunday in Buffalo. Smith's backup is Nuu Faaola. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The World League of American Football announced Tuesday it will stage an 
invitation-only tryout Saturday at Hofstra as part of the selection process to 
determine 96 American players who will be assigned to European teams when the 
league begins play in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Audibles: Reflecting on free safety Jeff Fuller's severe neck injury in the 
wake of the earthquake, 49ers quarterback Steve Young said, "It was another 
sobering blow. It seemed like it went along with what had been happening during 
the week."

CHIP BANKS TRYING TO COME ALL THE WAY BACK 
</P>

<P>
Chip Banks has won his battle to get back in the National Football League. Now 
the Indianapolis Colts linebacker is trying to win his private war to stay in 
the league. 
</P>
<P>
Five days after he joined the Colts, Banks played in his first NFL game in 
nearly 22 months. The former All-Pro started and was on the field for 49 of 64 
defensive plays and made a significant contribution to the 23-12 upset of 
defending AFC champion Cincinnati last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Banks, 30, is a two-time loser under the NFL's drug program and faces a 
lifetime suspension if he tests positive again. 
</P>
<P>
But, opposing linemen, runners and quarterbacks concern him more than anyone's 
nagging doubts over his drug rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect to be treated any differently than anyone who makes a mistake. 
For me, I feel that I just have to concentrate on my priorities . . . stick 
with the program and I'll be fine. . . . My actions will speak a lot harder 
than my words will." 
</P>
<P>
Banks was obtained by the Colts from San Diego on Oct. 17 for a future 
undisclosed draft pick. The next day he practiced with Indianapolis for the 
first time and five days after the trade he was playing a football game for the 
first time since Dec. 27, 1987 -- following a suspension and a season-long 
contract dispute that was not resolved until the day of the trade. 
</P>
<P>
"I never doubted I could play. I kept myself in condition and studied the play 
book intently after I arrived," said Banks. 
</P>
<P>
"I spent about 20 hours studying the Indianapolis defense," said Banks, adding 
that teammate Duane Bickett, who was also his teammate for one year at USC 
tutored him intently during that time. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I could have done it, understood the system, so quickly without 
Duane," said Banks, who made three solo tackles and was credited with four 
quarterback pressures -- making him the team leader for the season. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question Chip was a significant reason we performed so well 
defensively," Coach Ron Meyer said. "We knew he would play some, but quite 
frankly, were surprised he played as much as he did." 
</P>
<P>
The Colts, who took a chance on Tony Collins last year only to see him fail an 
NFL drug test and eventually become hospitalized, know they're throwing the 
dice again on Banks. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe you have to acknowledge statistical facts that relapse is 
prevalent," said General Manager Jim Irsay when he announced the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't worry about that," said Banks. "There are always going to be critics 
and skeptics about my situation or anybody who made mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Banks' mistakes include being arrested four times in his native Atlanta on 
cocaine and marijuana possession charges between February 1988 and June of this 
year. On Oct. 11, an Atlanta judge sentenced him to five years probation on a 
cocaine possession conviction. The probation term runs concurrently with a 
five-year probation for a March marijuana conviction.

He was released from a drug rehabilitation center earlier this month and is 
working with therapists in San Diego and here. In addition, he must subject 
himself to random urinalysis tests. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just glad that the powers to be saw fit to give me this opportunity to let 
me play again and to reinstate me to the league. That's what counted for the 
most part, being reinstated and playing ball this year. Those were big hurdles 
I made over. Those were the most important things I had to deal with," Banks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On the field, Banks has always been impressive. At Lucy Laney High School in 
Augusta, Ga., he played linebacker, tight end, quarterback and also punted 
while receiving prep All-America recognition. He started two games as a 
freshman for Southern Cal, led the Trojans in tackles as a junior and senior 
and received All-America honors in his final year. 
</P>
<P>
The Cleveland Browns made him the third pick overall in the 1982 college draft 
and he was a Pro Bowl starter as a rookie. Another Pro Bowl start followed in 
1983, along with selection to The Associated Press All-NFL first team. Banks, 
who has started all 86 of his NFL games, also was selected a Pro Bowl starter 
in 1985 and a first alternate in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had the talent and I still believe I have it. I felt I was in pretty good 
shape and I went out Sunday wanting to make my assignments crisp, do those 
well, create some havoc and be an impact," he said. "I surprised myself 
somewhat in the way I what I was able to accomplish."

RAZORBACKS TAKE THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST HOUSTON; 
</P>
<P>
ARKANSAS: QUARTERBACK QUINN GROVEY BEATS COUGARS AT THEIR OWN GAME WITH DEEP 
PASSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arkansas quarterback Quinn Grovey knew that Houston would give the Razorbacks 
the deep pass -- and he took it. 
</P>
<P>
Grovey completed touchdown passes of 65 and 51 yards on his way to 335 yards in 
total offense and five touchdowns Saturday night as the 13th-ranked Razorbacks, 
rolling up 647 yards, remained in the Southwest Conference race with a 45-39 
victory over No. 12 Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"Their free safety was playing us right," said Grovey, who scored three 
touchdowns. "They gave us the deep route time and time again, and we took it." 
</P>
<P>
"Quinn Grovey keeps getting better and better," Arkansas Coach Ken Hatfield 
said. "He threw the ball extremely well. He didn't force anything. We knew we 
had to throw the ball against them. 
</P>
<P>
"It was as big a game as I've been in because of the nature of the opponent and 
the fact our backs were to the wall in the conference race. Now we're still in 
the fight for the conference championship." 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas is 6-1 overall and 3-1 in the SWC to Houston's 5-2, 2-2. Texas leads 
the conference with a 3-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
The teams combined for 1,228 yards, second most in SWC history. Houston and 
Southern Methodist set the record of 1,406 last week, with the Cougars rolling 
up a National Collegiate Athletic Assn. record of 1,021 yards in a 95-21 romp. 
</P>
<P>
The Razorbacks also got 100-yard-plus rushing performances from James Rouse and 
Barry Foster and scored on six of their last seven possessions. 
</P>
<P>
With Grovey at the controls, Arkansas had touchdown drives of 77, 69, 78, 81, 
76 and 62 yards. Grovey's two-yard run with 3:08 remaining put Arkansas up 
45-31, the first time either time either team led by more than seven points. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars amassed 571 yards against the Razorbacks, and quarterback Andre 
Ware completed 34 of 46 passes for 352 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Houston led 28-24 after three periods but Grovey hit Derek Russell with a 
51-yard scoring pass on the first play of the final period to put Arkansas 
ahead 31-28. 
</P>
<P>
Houston's Roman Anderson tied it with a 46-yard field goal and Rouse then 
capped a 76-yard scoring drive with a three-yard run that made it 38-31. 
</P>
<P>
Grovey's yardage total was the third best in Arkansas history. Bill Montgomery 
set the Arkansas total offense record of 360 yards in the 1970 Sugar Bowl. 
Grovey, who had never thrown for more than 174 yards, equaled that in the first 
half and wound up 11 of 14 for 256. He also rushed for 79 yards. 
</P>
<P>
He produced Arkansas' first touchdown on a 65-yard pass to Russell and scored 
three times on two-yard runs.

<P>
Cornerback Malcolm Frank and linebacker James Francis returned interceptions 
for touchdowns Saturday to lift Baylor to a 27-9 Southwest Conference victory 
over Texas Christian at Waco, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Baylor evened its overall record at 4-4 and is 3-2 in the conference. TCU

</P>
<P>
Frank went 32 yards for a touchdown on a second-quarter interception off 
freshman quarterback Leon Clay, and Francis returned an interception 50 yards 
for a score off Ron Jiles in the third period, . 
</P>
<P>
The Bears played the second half without starting quarterback Brad Goebel, who 
suffered a bruised right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Texas A&amp;M 45, Rice 7 -- Darren Lewis rushed for 201 yards to become the No. 
2 rusher in Texas A&amp;M history, and Lance Pavlas threw three touchdown 
passes to lead the Aggies at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Pavlas completed touchdown passes of 36 yards to Percy Waddle, 20 yards to 
Cornelius Patterson and 12 yards to Robert Wilson before leaving the game early 
in the fourth quarter. Pavlas completed 13 of 16 passes for 161 yards. 
</P>
<P>

Southern Methodist 35, North Texas 9 -- Only a week after losing to Houston, 
95-21, the Mustangs rebounded at Dallas with their second victory of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Romo threw for 427 yards and three touchdowns as the Mustangs snapped a 
four-game losing streak. SMU is playing football after a two-year suspension 
for repeated rules violations. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Bergfeld caught two touchdown passes as SMU (2-5) took a break from 
Southwest Conference play with its second victory over a Division I-AA 
opponent. The Mustangs' other victory was over Connecticut, 31-30, Sept. 16.

<P>
Dan McGwire, plagued by interceptions throughout the night, scored on a 
one-yard run midway through the fourth quarter Saturday to give San Diego State 
a 34-31 Western Athletic Conference victory over Texas El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire, who entered the game ranked ninth in the nation in passing efficiency, 
had six passes intercepted, including three that led to UTEP scores. 
</P>
<P>
But his winning touchdown, with 8:17 left, capped a 14-play, 80-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State improved to 4-3-1 overall, 2-2 in the WAC. UTEP is 2-7 and 1-4. 
</P>
<P>
The Miners' Dominick Cefalone was short on a 58-yard field-goal attempt that 
would have tied it with 1:44 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
UTEP led 21-7 after one quarter. Howard Gasser passed 62 and 45 yards to Reggie 
Barrett for two touchdowns, and linebacker Ken Sale returned an interception of 
a pass from McGwire 27 yards for another. 
</P>
<P>
But San Diego State answered with 17 second-quarter points, starting with 
McGwire's nine-yard pass to Robert Claiborne. Andy Trakas kicked a 35-yard 
field goal and Darren Wagner scored from the five-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs amassed 554 yards of total offense but had seven turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Wyoming 24, New Mexico 23 -- Quarterback Tom Corontzos threw a 34-yard 
touchdown pass to halfback Dabby Dawson in the fourth quarter and the Cowboys 
held on for the win at Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys' victory wasn't secure until New Mexico quarterback Jeremy Leach, 
passing for the two-point conversion attempt, hit the crossbar. Leach had 
thrown an 18-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Terance Mathis as time ran 
out to close the score to one point. 
</P>
<P>
The touchdown pass was tipped by Wyoming linebacker Vaughn Henderson, but 
Mathis, who became the all-time National Collegiate Athletic Assn. leader in 
career receiving yardage, grabbed the ball in the middle of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico, which has lost four games this season by seven points or fewer, 
went for the victory, but Leach could not find an open teammate and finally 
fired a pass that sailed into the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
Wyoming improved to 3-5 overall and 3-2 in the conference. New Mexico, losing 
its seventh in a row, is 1-8 and 0-5. 
</P>
<P>
Mathis finished with eight catches for 110 yards to move past Marc Zeno of 
Tulane in all-time receiving yardage. Mathis now has 3,772 yards. Zeno had 
3,725 yards from 1984-87. 
</P>
<P>
Leach, who completed 26 of 50 passes for 343 yards, threw an 82-yard touchdown 
pass to Eric Morgan, and wide receiver Mike Henderson scored in the first half 
on a 33-yard reverse. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State 50, Utah 10 -- Tony Alford ran for a WAC record 310 yards and 
three touchdowns as the Rams won at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Alford scored on runs of 54, 42 and 63 yards and broke the conference rushing 
record of 302 yards, set by Kevin Lowe of Wyoming against South Dakota State in 
1984.

Paul Justin completed 33 of 47 passes for a school-record 534 yards and four 
touchdowns and Ron Fair had a school and conference-record 19 catches for 277 
yards and three touchdowns as Arizona State upset No. 23 Washington State, 
44-39, in a Pacific 10 game Saturday night at Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
The winning touchdown for the Sun Devils came on a two-yard run by Kelvin 
Fisher with 1:02 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Justin broke the old school record of 532 passing yards, set by Jeff Van 
Raaphorst in 1984 against Florida State, as the Sun Devils improved to 4-3-1 
overall and 1-2-1 in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State drove 82 yards in nine plays for the winning score. After 
Fisher's touchdown, a two-point conversion pass failed. 
</P>
<P>
Nathan LaDuke preserved the victory by intercepting a Washington State pass at 
the Sun Devils' 10-yard line with 33 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Washington State (6-3 and 3-3) had taken a 39-38 lead with 5:40 to play on 
Steve Broussard's one-yard run -- his third touchdown of the game -- and his 
two-point conversion catch. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State had 651 yards in total offense -- 477 in the second half. The 
Cougars finished with 566 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Sun Devils, trailing 17-13 at halftime, went ahead 20-17 on Jeff Simoneau's 
one-yard run with 5:20 remaining in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Broussard, the conference leader in all-purpose running this season, returned 
the ensuing kickoff 98 yards for a 24-20 lead. It was the second-longest 
kickoff return in Washington State's history and the first one run back for a 
touchdown against Arizona State since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State 25, California 14 -- Pat Chaffey scored two touchdowns and Tony 
Bussanich kicked four field goals at Berkeley as the Beavers boosted their 
chances for their first winning season since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
The Beavers, who upset UCLA last week, struggled in the first quarter, gaining 
only 15 yards. But Cal was unable to capitalize on its early opportunities and 
Oregon State (4-3-1 and 3-1-1) put the game away with 22 second-half points. 
</P>
<P>
The Beavers have not had a winning record since going 6-5-0 under Dee Andros in 
1971. 
</P>
<P>
Cal (2-6 and 0-5) sealed its fate with turnovers on three consecutive 
possessions in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona 38, Pacific 14 -- Redshirt freshman George Malauulu, making his first 
start, directed three touchdown drives as the No. 17 Wildcats beat the 
overmatched Tigers of the Big West Conference at Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
Malauulu directed the Wildcats in the first and third quarters and junior 
Ronald Veal played the second and fourth periods as Arizona raised its record 
to 6-2 overall. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats remain 4-1 in the Pac-10 Conference and trail only 4-0 USC. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific, 1-8 overall and 1-4 in the Big West, trailed only 21-14 in the third 
quarter after a 26-yard touchdown pass from Troy Kopp to Bryan Baldwin.

<P>
It began as a dream in the mid-1980s, when local health club owners Marv 
Wolfenson and Harvey Ratner made a bid for the Milwaukee Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
It became an obsession in 1986, when Wolfenson and Ratner -- or Marv and Harv, 
as they are known around the Twin Cities -- said they came "within an eyelash" 
of buying the Utah Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
It started to take shape in 1987, when NBA owners voted to give Marv and Harv 
an expansion team -- the Minnesota Timberwolves -- for 1989-90 at a cost of 
$32.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
It got closer last June, when the Wolves drafted 11 players off existing team's 
rosters and three more prospects in the college draft. 
</P>
<P>
And it will become a reality next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
When the Timberwolves open at Seattle against the SuperSonics, they will be the 
first NBA team to represent Minnesota since the Minneapolis Lakers left for Los 
Angeles on April 28, 1960. 
</P>
<P>
"This is definitely a dream come true," said Wolfenson, who owned three percent 
stock in the old Lakers. "When you want something for so long and then finally 
get it, it's an indescribable feeling." 
</P>
<P>
The dream doesn't stop with Marv and Harv. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Stein, Wolfenson's son-in-law, has gone from being a pro football player to 
an attorney and player's agent to the boss of a professional organization as 
team president. Billy McKinney, a journeyman NBA player, runs the player 
personnel department. Bill Musselman, who felt he was blackballed out of the 
league when he ran the Cleveland Cavaliers into the ground in the early '80s, 
is back to coach in Minnesota where, in 1972, he led the Gophers to their first 
Big Ten title. 
</P>
<P>
Ten of 15 players on the team's roster as preseason ended (not including 
holdouts Rick Mahorn, Tyrone Corbin and Steve Johnson) spent time in the 
minor-league CBA. Five of them -- guard Sidney Lowe and forwards Tony Campbell, 
Sam Mitchell, Tod Murphy and Scott Roth -- played for Musselman when the CBA 
was the only league in which he could get a job. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all chasing a dream," Murphy said. "We all want to show we belong in the 
NBA." 
</P>
<P>
Organizationally, things have gone well for the Wolves. They have sold about 
15,000 season tickets and set an exhibition-game record when 35,156 fans 
streamed into the Metrodome for an Oct. 18 game against the Lakers. They will 
play in the Metrodome this year before moving into a state-of-the-art, $75 
million, privately-funded, 18,000-seat downtown arena for 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
On the court, however, there's already been turmoil. The Timberwolves' top 
three picks in the expansion draft, forwards Mahorn and Corbin and center 
Johnson -- who were expected to form the starting frontcourt -- all want their 
contracts renegotiated. None reported and Stein steadfastly refuses to 
negotiate until after they prove their worth to the Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
Without those players, Minnesota has little veteran leadership, few proven 
players, hardly any rebounding and almost no inside scoring. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't sound pretty," Campbell said, "but I guarantee we'll surprise some 
people. Bill Musselman will never let us quit. We'll win some games just 
because we outwork people." 
</P>
<P>
The Timberwolves certainly aren't going to outscore them. During the exhibition 
season, they had trouble reaching 90 points. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson could solve part of that problem. The 6-10 center averaged 12.4 points 
in eight NBA seasons mostly from around the basket and his .574 career 
percentage is fourth best in league history. 
</P>
<P>
But the 32-year-old has been hampered by a variety of injuries the last few 
years and wants more security than he currently has in the final year of a 
contract that would pay him about $800,000 this season and make him the 
Timberwolves' highest paid player. 
</P>
<P>
Mahorn and Corbin would help keep Minnesota from getting killed on the boards. 
But Mahorn wants his $625,000 salary doubled and Corbin wants a big raise from 
$287,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to find people who can score in the paint," Musselman said. "I'm not 
gonna lie. We're lacking that." 
</P>
<P>
Adrian Branch, signed to a two-year contract last week, has helped reduce the 
logjam at shooting guard. Campbell, who signed a four-year, $2.9 million 
contract after playing out his option with the Lakers, is expected to be the 
team's "go-to" guy. Seven-footer Brad Lohaus has displayed a nice outside 
shooting touch. 
</P>
<P>
Lowe, who turns 30 in January and who has played only 113 NBA games, starts at 
point guard ahead of top draft pick Pooh Richardson and second-year pro David 
Rivers -- mostly because he helped Musselman win three CBA titles. 
</P>
<P>
"He's so unselfish, really the ultimate unselfish player," Musselman said. "Sid 
is an unusually strong leader. He has one of the greatest basketball minds I've 
ever been around."

NANCY FORTNER AIMS TO OVERCOME A LOSING HABIT FOR THE CSDH WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL 
TEAM -- AND HER OWN CAREER DISAPPOINTMENTS; 
</P>
<P>
COACHING: EX-OLYMPIAN NANCY FORTNER WAS NEVER GIVEN A FULL-TIME POSITION 
DESPITE LEADING DOMINGUEZ HILLS, IN AN EARLIER STINT, AND LOYOLA TO NATIONAL 
RANKINGS. SINCE SHE LEFT, BOTH PROGRAMS DECLINED. THIS TIME SHE HOPES HER 
EFFORTS WILL BE REWARDED, AND NOT JUST ON THE COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brilliant sunlight burned off the overcast shrouding the campus of Cal State 
Dominguez Hills, sending shards of light through a field house window and 
across Nancy Fortner's desk. 
</P>
<P>
Fortner, the third women's volleyball coach here in the past five years, 
squinted, wrinkling her nose. It was early in the morning and the room glowed, 
unlike the sport she was rehired to turn around. A decade ago she coached a 
successful program here. But she, like the sun, found things in a fog. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a certain attitude that needs to be changed," she said off the top. 
"You get into a mode where you get used to losing, and then you can't win. I 
think I can build a program here, but it will take time." 
</P>
<P>
In the South Bay, where volleyball flourishes on the beaches, in public schools 
and private clubs, the Dominguez Hills women's program has not been a shining 
star. Fortner is supposed to lead women's volleyball out of its malaise, a 
not-so-bright prospect even for a woman who professes to like a good challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Toros have had only one winning season since moving to the Division II 
level in 1982. This year, with few recruits available because Fortner was hired 
in midsummer, Dominguez Hills is 7-13 overall and once again winless in the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Fortner was hired as part of a master plan by Athletic Director Dan Guerrero, 
who wants to build Dominguez Hills into a national power on the Division II 
level. In just over a year Guerrero has taken a personal hand in recruiting 
athletes; he has hired four new coaches, a sports information director and an 
athletic fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
As a member of the 1964 and 1968 U.S. Olympic volleyball teams, Fortner fits 
nicely into Guerrero's plans. She is internationally known, a former 
All-American at Pepperdine. She competes on the senior tour of the U.S. 
Volleyball Assn., and her coaching record is proven: a fourth-place finish 
nationally among small schools at Dominguez Hills in 1978 and Loyola 
Marymount's only conference title and appearance in the Division I playoffs in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
But more important, says Guerrero, she brings a ray of hope to the university 
because she is a winner: "She has a reputation for being an outstanding person, 
and she has instilled in her the work ethic that we want here at Dominguez 
Hills." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her successful record, Fortner has never held a full-time coaching job 
until now. 
</P>
<P>
She was the first volleyball coach Dominguez Hills had when the program began 
in 1973, but was passed over for a full-time faculty position here in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
She moved into another part-time role at Loyola, where the upgrading of her 
status to full time was promised but never delivered. She gave the school an 
ultimatum in 1986 after the Lions won the West Coast Athletic Conference title, 
then upset UCLA in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament. When her request 
to be hired full time was rejected, she resigned to go into the private sector. 
Her ability to make a living at the sport she loved had temporarily come to an 
end. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, she and her husband, Ron, the women's basketball coach at Pepperdine, 
hadn't been doing so well at making a living at all. Their personal debts 
mounted each season that Nancy did not bring home a full-time salary. Ron had 
to take a second job driving an airport shuttle van at night. They had to sell 
their San Pedro home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very unsettling feeling to be in debt, very stressful," Fortner said. 
</P>
<P>
Her bright blue eyes twinkled as she squinted against the bright sunlight. 
They're not out of the financial thicket yet, she said. "It's scary." 
</P>
<P>
Fortner's inability to financially capitalize on a sport that had been a major 
part of her life left deep emotional scars because she allowed herself to get 
close to each of her teams. 
</P>
<P>
"She is very motherly to her athletes," said Loyola Athletic Director Brian 
Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
And dedicated, according to friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"She is a very loyal person, wherever she worked," explained Ron. "She never 
really wanted to leave Dominguez Hills the first time." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy took the disappointment at Loyola very hard. 
</P>
<P>
"Where I'm from, you work hard, do a good job, and they should reward you for 
that," Fortner said. "That's basic." 
</P>
<P>
Fortner built the Lions into a Division I conference winner with virtually no 
financial support from the school's administration. She asked Quinn to create a 
full-time position for her. She felt she deserved that because of what she had 
done for the school's image. But her request was just too much for a 
tight-fisted administration to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
Said Quinn: "At that point in our history we were a small school; then 
overnight we moved into the warfare on the Division I Level. . . . At that time 
the university could not provide (full-time) employment (for Fortner)." 
</P>
<P>
Despite urging by Quinn, the Rev. James N. Loughran, president of Loyola, 
vetoed a request to create a full-time women's volleyball coaching position. 
</P>
<P>
"The funds just weren't there," Quinn explained. 
</P>
<P>
The same thing was becoming evident to the Fortners each time they sat down to 
pay their bills. Nancy, rebuffed by Loyola, said the university did not care 
about women's athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"All (the Loyola administration wants you to do each year) is to continue to be 
contenders," Fortner said of the university's women's program. "The kids 
deserve something more tangible, like more scholarship money. It was very 
frustrating. I was traipsing from gym to gym, and for what they were paying me 
it just wasn't worth it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Fortner resigned by phone. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the conversation with Brian," she said. "I was holding the phone to 
my ear and telling him, 'Well, Brian, if that's the way it's going to be, then 
I won't be back,' " and I'm thinking to myself, 'I'm not really saying this, am 
I?' " 
</P>
<P>
Loyola's record under Fortner was 144-89. Since her departure, the school is 
31-47. Ironically, Loyola recently created a full-time position to handle both 
men's and women's volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
Fortner's coaching successes didn't help her land the full-time position at 
Dominguez Hills the first time around in 1979, either. She capped a six-year 
stint with an 18-6 record and guided the Lady Toros to the league championship 
of the Pacific Coast Athletic Conference, part of the now-defunct Assn. of 
Intercollegiate Athletics for Women. 
</P>
<P>
The team finished fourth nationally that season. Fortner thought that was good 
enough to have earned a full-time position. But when the school opened the job, 
she was passed over. The university said it had been overwhelmed by applicants 
from around the country, many with previous full-time experience. That made 
Fortner expendable. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, she said: "I was fired." 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, not getting the two positions were "the best things that 
happened to me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But not without rough spots. Although Ron and Nancy have a 12-year old daughter 
and have been married for 15 years now, coaching pressures back then 
complicated financial woes. The couple had marital problems and separated 
shortly after Nancy left Dominguez Hills for Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a difficult period in my life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Fortner has never liked recruiting wars. "It goes against my grain," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Those who know her say her distaste for recruiting probably cost her the 
Dominguez Hills job the first time around. Now, ironically, her success will be 
measured in great part by her ability to attract top-flight players to a school 
that has had difficulty selling itself to the volleyball community in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Said Ron, who has experienced recruiting wars at Pepperdine: "Nancy will have 
to sell this program. She'll have to recruit, convince people that this program 
can win." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola's Quinn agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"Dominguez Hills, that's a tough recruiting market in the past. It's a good 
school, and if they have the funds, well, the South Bay is loaded with talent. 
There are a lot of (third-string) players out there (that will do well at a 
place like Dominguez Hills). 
</P>
<P>
"Nancy can get these kids," he continued. "But it won't be easy. I think the 
kids will wait (for a couple of years) and see how she does." 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero is confident that Fortner can turn the program around. 
</P>
<P>
"Immediately, she has brought a greater sense of local autonomy to the 
program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Training regimens under Fortner "are intense," according to Guerrero. "She is 
focused, and it's strictly business." 
</P>
<P>
Getting down to business on the volleyball court, contends Fortner, is what she 
likes to do best. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm good with people one on one. When you are recruiting, you go to these 
tournaments and you watch them play. It's like a game of chess. You make a move 
and they make a move. I try to not let it bother me." 
</P>
<P>
"I think Nancy has worked hard to learn how to recruit," said Guerrero, who 
predicted that "it's not inconceivable that in the next few years we could be 
nationally ranked and playing for a championship in our conference." 
</P>
<P>
Fortner's track record seems to assure that, even though she was not hired 
until late July when even third-string prospects had committed to other 
schools. In fact, Guerrero did most of the recruiting for this year's team. 
</P>
<P>
Despite key injuries, the Lady Toros have already matched last year's win 
total. 
</P>
<P>
"The team has really come a long way," Guerrero said. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Fortner was driving a shuttle bus and working with the elderly at a 
retirement home near her San Pedro residence when she heard about the opening 
at Dominguez Hills by chance. Todd Corman, the women's basketball coach at 
Loyola, stopped by her house one night to drop off game films for Ron. He had 
seen the job posting from Dominguez Hills and he was curious if Nancy had 
applied. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't that interested when he told me about it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
That night second thoughts haunted her as she slept. 
</P>
<P>
"I woke up the next morning and thought that maybe it would be good to apply. I 
went to church and talked it over with my pastor, and he prayed for me." 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, said Nancy, two years away from athletics was difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"Volleyball," she said, "had been my entire life." 
</P>
<P>
Ron noticed Nancy's mood swings. 
</P>
<P>
"She would never admit it to me, but I think she missed coaching. In that first 
year, I think she had second thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
Two seasons later, she found herself questioning her ability. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know if I would be able to come back at first, to adjust," she said. 
"But I did. Coaching gets in your blood." 
</P>
<P>
Working with the elderly taught her a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"I became part of their family, and they became part of mine. They would tell 
me, 'Don't ever grow old.' I see kids with ability taking so much of it for 
granted. Up at the home . . . those people know. . . . A lot of them are not 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
"There is so much more people can do if they just try a little harder, push 
themselves a little. Athletics is doing things you've never done before, going 
beyond the average." 
</P>
<P>
It is a tenet she says she will preach at Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The Toro Gym was nearly empty the other night as Dominguez Hills dropped a 
three-game decision to Cal Poly Pomona, one of five nationally ranked team the 
Toros must face in the CCAA. It was not an easy loss for Fortner, since 
Dominguez Hills was even 13-all in the first game before it made two mental 
mistakes that enabled Pomona to gain the momentum. 
</P>
<P>
She had drilled the team hard for this one, the conference opener. Before the 
game, she took her players into a corner of the gym, removed her shoes, and, 
dressed in slacks and blouse, drove spike after spike at them with a closed 
fist. 
</P>
<P>
As the game progressed, Ron, seated behind the Lady Toro bench, wondered aloud: 
"This job here may just be Nancy's biggest challenge yet." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy called a timeout as Pomona ran away with the second game. Ron, watching 
nervously, said: "I think she missed coaching. The challenge is good for her. 
Nancy is very competitive." 
</P>
<P>
The game ended in Pomona's lopsided favor. Ron, wriggling in his seat, still 
managed an upbeat tone. 
</P>
<P>
"In some respects," he said, searching for a ray of hope, "this Dominguez Hills 
thing is the best thing that has ever happened to us" -- a statement that his 
wife had echoed several days before on that brightly lighted morning.

EL SEGUNDO EVENS RECORD, BLANKS PATER NOSTER, 19-0 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
El Segundo, which lost its first four games this year, is playing a season from 
the bottom up. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles defeated Pater Noster, 19-0, in Glendale on Saturday, their fourth 
win in a row, to even their record at 4-4 overall and 4-1 in league play, good 
for second place behind undefeated St. Monica (5-0). 
</P>
<P>
And they've done it by accomplishing just enough on the field to survive. 
</P>
<P>
With 2:40 remaining in Saturday's game, Pater Noster had a first and goal on 
the El Segundo three-yard line and ran up the middle four straight times. El 
Segundo did what was necessary, stopping the drive twice within the one. 
</P>
<P>
That preserved the shutout and sustained El Segundo's hopes for a league title. 
Pater Noster fell to 3-5 overall and 1-4 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
"That really showed a lot by holding them when they really didn't have very far 
to go for a touchdown," said El Segundo Coach Steve Newell. 
</P>
<P>
And when El Segundo needed a score in a similar situation with 43 seconds 
remaining in the first quarter, the offense produced. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a fourth-and-goal, sophomore running back Eran Taulua crashed in 
from three yards out for a 6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
That score stood until late in the third quarter, when senior quarterback Tom 
Cover hooked up with receiver T.D. Mayer for a 23-yard touchdown. In the fourth 
quarter, backup quarterback Brett Newell tossed a 25-yard TD pass to Eric 
Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo intercepted four Pater Noster passes and gave up just 135 yards in 
total offense.

WEST TORRANCE BEATS SOUTH, LEADS LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
John Black, co-coach of West Torrance High's football team, rejected the idea 
Friday night that the Warriors are in the driver's seat for the Ocean League 
title. 
</P>
<P>
But how else would you describe it? 
</P>
<P>
After the Warriors' 16-3 win over South Torrance, they clearly have the 
smoothest road to the championship. 
</P>
<P>
West moved into sole possession of first place and secured a spot in the 
Southern Section Division VII playoffs with a performance punctuated by the 
dominating play of its defense and the multiple talents of Josh Moore. 
</P>
<P>
It was the seventh consecutive win for the Warriors (7-1 overall, 5-0 in league 
play), who lead South (4-4, 4-1) by one game with two to play. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say we're in the driver's seat, but we're happy," Black said. "We 
had to have this one. We didn't want to back into (the championship). We wanted 
to win this by ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
The victory at South's homecoming was satisfying for another reason. After two 
straight losing seasons, West can clinch its first league title since 1986 with 
a split in its last two games against North Torrance and Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long haul for us the last few years," Black said. "You have to 
give credit to the seniors. They've worked hard." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the hardest workers Friday night were West's defensive players. They 
shut down South's option attack and tackled quarterback Kevin Fitzpatrick nine 
times for losses, including a safety by outside linebacker Matt Vincent in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We made a challenge to our down linemen this week," Black said. "Having to 
face a good option quarterback (Fitzpatrick), we told them they had to play 
their best game in order for us to win." 
</P>
<P>
Defensive tackles Cedric Lee, Mark Gehley and Jake Nilges responded with big 
efforts, helping the Warriors limit South to a second-quarter field goal by 
Brian Hannah. 
</P>
<P>
"Their defense took us out of what we wanted to do," said South Coach Don 
Morrow, whose team finished with 106 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
South did manage to drive into West territory three times in the fourth 
quarter. On each occasion, though, the Warriors held their ground. 
</P>
<P>
Inside linebacker Jae Kim sacked Fitzpatrick on two consecutive plays after 
South had driven to the West 22 to end a scoring threat early in the fourth 
quarter. Kim added a third sack on South's next possession, which fizzled at 
the West 48. 
</P>
<P>
Offensively, West needed little more than the exploits of Moore. The senior 
running back-defensive back-kick returner broke loose for a 34-yard touchdown 
run late in the first quarter, and he returned a free kick 77 yards for a score 
after Vincent's safety to make it 16-0 with 10:23 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Moore had a 91-yard kickoff return for a TD against Redondo. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like we do anything special," Black said. "With a player like that, 
he makes us look good. Our special teams have kept us in games. We have the 
personnel for it." 
</P>
<P>
While West moved a step closer to the title and South remained in good position 
to make the playoffs, the next five teams in the Ocean League find themselves 
in a logjam. 
</P>
<P>
A half-game separates the teams, all of which are fighting to remain in playoff 
contention. Redondo and Culver City (both 2-2-1) are tied for third following 
their 14-14 tie Friday night, while Mira Costa, Morningside and North Torrance 
each have 2-3 records. 
</P>
<P>
Since South has not clinched a playoff spot, that means there are six teams 
contesting for two guaranteed berths in the Division VII playoffs. That should 
make for some interesting games in the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Next Friday, South visits Morningside, a team that suddenly has rediscovered 
how to win after losing its first six games. The Monarchs, last year's league 
champions, defeated Mira Costa, 13-10, Friday night for their second straight 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Other teams facing must-win games next week are Mira Costa, which plays host to 
Culver City, and North, which plays at West. 
</P>
<P>
It's tough to be satisfied with a tie, but Redondo Coach Les Congelliere made 
the right decision by going for a one-point conversion after his team scored a 
touchdown with no time remaining against host Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Hawks scored on a 25-yard pass from quarterback Brian Davison to 
running back Antoine Humble to pull within 14-13. 
</P>
<P>
By going for a one-point conversion and a tie, Congelliere put Redondo in 
position to make the playoffs heading into their last two Ocean League games 
with Centennial and Mira Costa. 
</P>
<P>
If the Sea Hawks had failed on a two-point try, their season would have been 
over. 
</P>
<P>
A blocked field goal by senior lineman Dan Beck prevented Rolling Hills from 
falling out of playoff contention in the Bay League. 
</P>
<P>
Beck's block on a 21-yard attempt by Santa Monica's Sheldon Phillip-Guide with 
55 seconds left preserved a 22-20 victory for the Titans, who jumped from sixth 
to fourth in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
Although only the league's top three teams are assured spots in the Division II 
playoffs, Rolling Hills (6-2-1 overall, 2-2-1 in the Bay League) presently has 
the best shot of gaining the division's wild-card berth, which will go to the 
fourth-place team with the best overall record from the five leagues within 
Division II. 
</P>
<P>
However, Coach Gary Kimbrell doesn't want to look any farther ahead than next 
Friday's game with Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we can't worry about what's going to happen to other teams," he 
said. "We have to worry about ourselves. We've got to win next week, and 
Torrance is (tough as) nails." 
</P>
<P>
In a see-saw game featuring strong running attacks, Rolling Hills scored the 
game-winning touchdown on a 32-yard pass from quarterback Greg Schwartz to wide 
receiver Terry Rose on third-and-23 with 3:39 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica, behind the running of tailback Sean Smith (135 yards, three 
touchdowns on 30 carries), drove to the Rolling Hills 3-yard line on its last 
possession. But on third and goal, cornerback Mike Lemons came up to stop Smith 
in his tracks and force the Vikings into a field-goal try. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz enjoyed his finest day at quarterback for the Titans. He rushed 15 
times for 62 yards, including a 21-yard touchdown and two-point conversion in 
the second quarter, and he passed for 71 yards and one TD. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills tailback Robert Coulter, the area's leading rusher, led his team 
with 118 yards on 23 carries and scored on a five-yard run in the first 
quarter. The Titans are 6-0-1 when Coulter has reached 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrell was asked about Coulter's problem with fumbling, which seems to happen 
when the junior fails to tuck the ball away. The transfer from Texas lost a 
fumble on Rolling Hills' first play of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a bad habit," Kimbrell said. "He must have picked it up in Texas. 
I've got to blame it on something. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a bad habit from Texas too -- Dwaine Lyon." 
</P>
<P>
Lyon, who was raised in the Lone Star state, is Rolling Hills' offensive 
coordinator and one of Kimbrell's closest friends. 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste gave unbeaten Valley Christian a scare Friday night in a key Olympic 
League football game, but a turnover in the fourth quarter put the game out of 
reach for the Marauders. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 22-14, Miraleste fumbled on a punt return with seven minutes to play, 
and Valley Christian converted it into a touchdown to improve to 8-0 overall 
and 4-0 in league play. Miraleste dropped to 5-3 and 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a breakdown on special teams, and that was the ball game," said 
Miraleste Coach Todd DeAngelis. 
</P>
<P>
The Marauders, who played without leading rusher Dan Sarner because of a broken 
thumb he suffered in practice this week, got a big game from another sophomore 
running back. Dan Crofton carried the ball 13 times for 122 yards, most of them 
coming on an 80-yard touchdown in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Revenge was sweet for the Palos Verdes girls tennis team Wednesday, as the Sea 
Kings defeated rival Miraleste, 11-7, in a non-league match at Miraleste. 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste beat Palos Verdes by the same score earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I was ticked off when we lost to Miraleste last time," Palos Verdes Coach 
Kathy Ross said. "I really wanted to beat them." 
</P>
<P>
A third meeting between the South Bay's top teams could occur in the Southern 
Section 4-A playoffs. Miraleste entered last week ranked No. 2 in the division 
and Palos Verdes was No. 3, so it's likely they could be headed for a date in 
the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste, which has won four CIF titles in the last eight years, also lost to 
top-ranked Corona del Mar, 13-5, on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time we've lost two matches in one week since I've been here," 
said Miraleste Coach Jim Hanson, who is in his sixth year. "(Palos Verdes) 
wanted it more than us this time. They came out more determined." 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes has clinched its ninth Bay League title in 10 years. The doubles 
team of Lorren Lotesta and Paully Hackathorn has lost only two sets this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Banning's football team, which landed in Coach Joe Dominguez's doghouse last 
week after an uninspired 14-0 win over Washington, got back on track Friday 
night with a 42-14 Southern-Pacific Conference win over Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback John Ma'ae passed for two touchdowns and ran for a third, and 
tailback Travis Davis rushed for two scores as the Pilots improved to 6-0-1 
overall heading into their Pacific League opener Friday against Crenshaw.

EL CAMINO DEFENSE HALTS MT. SAC, 29-12 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
For the second week in a row, El Camino looked sluggish at the start of a 
Mission Conference football game. And quarterback Frank Dolce, the league's 
best passer, never really got going. 
</P>
<P>
But the Warriors, ranked No.1 in the state by the JC Athletic Bureau and No. 3 
nationally by the JC Grid-Wire, still managed a 29-12 victory over No. 20 Mt. 
San Antonio College. 
</P>
<P>
The home victory lifted El Camino's record to 7-0 overall and 6-0 in the 
conference. Mt. SAC fell to 4-3 and 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
Dolce had his worst performance of the season. In the first half, the 6-foot-1, 
200-pound sophomore threw two interceptions and completed only seven of 22 
passes. He finished the night 13 of 30 for 206 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino's running game and tough defense earned the victory against a Mt. SAC 
club that was held scoreless in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors held Leonard Russell, the league's top rusher, to 125 yards. 
Running back Alfred Lowe led El Camino with 118 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense won this game for us," said El Camino Coach John Featherstone. "We 
were just sloppy on offense." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino didn't score until the end of the first quarter, on a 13-play, 
59-yard drive. On fourth and six at the Mt. SAC 11-yard line, El Camino set up 
for a field goal. Instead Niu Sale ran up the left side for the touchdown. Lowe 
threw a pass to David Blakes for the two-point conversion, which put the 
Warriors up, 8-5. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino drove 82 yards in six plays in its next possession. The drive was 
capped by Dolce's 47-yard touchdown pass to Shannon Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
The Mounties got their only touchdown of the half when a long snap floated over 
El Camino punter Scott Peters' head. On Mt. SAC's second play Russell sprinted 
21 yards into the end zone, narrowing the Warriors' lead to 15-12. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. SAC had scored in the first quarter on a safety and a 28-yard James 
Petrotta field goal. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, El Camino scored on a 10-yard run by Al Savea, a Louis 
Perez field goal and a 10-yard pass from Dolce to David Blakes.

PIERCE RALLIES IN FOURTH QUARTER TO DEFEAT SANTA MONICA, 24-13

Pierce College exploded for 12 fourth-quarter points within a one-minute, 
20-second span and rallied to defeat Santa Monica, 24-13, Saturday in a Western 
State Conference game at Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce trailed, 13-12, when Mike Burns capped a 14-play, eight-minute drive by 
kicking a 29-yard field goal, his third field goal of the game, to lift the 
Brahmas to a two-point advantage with 6:07 to play. 
</P>
<P>
On the ensuing series, the Brahmas stopped Santa Monica in three plays at the 
Corsair 15. On the fourth-down punt, the snap from center Mario Hull sailed 
over punter Chris Jackson into the end zone for a safety with 5:10 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen seconds later, Chad Zeigler ran back the free kick 64 yards for another 
Brahma score. 
</P>
<P>
The win lifted Pierce to 3-4 overall, 2-4 in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce got on the scoreboard first when Keith Brooks recovered a Santa Monica 
fumble at the Corsair 45. Five plays later, Louis Vann scored from nine yards 
to give the Brahmas a 6-0 lead early in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Vann rushed for 89 yards in 18 carries, including 77 in the first half, before 
leaving midway through the third period because of an injury. Anthony Mitchell 
added 49 yards in 12 tries. 
</P>
<P>
Burns booted a 33-yard field goal to increase the margin to 9-0 with 4:40 left 
in the half and also connected from 26 yards in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica (3-4, 2-4) was limited to 17 yards rushing in the first half. The 
Corsairs were only able to drive inside the Pierce 40 once in the first half, 
but Aaron McDaniel picked up a Charles McKenzie fumble at the Brahma 40 to 
squelch the only scoring threat. 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie ran in from two yards to open the second half and Charles Frazier 
added a one-yard plunge at the end of the third period to account for Santa 
Monica's scoring. KIRBY LEE

Santa Clara 35, Calabasas 0 -- Scottie Tripp rushed for 166 yards and Kwinn 
Knight scored three touchdowns to lead Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
The game matched teams at opposite ends of the league standings, so the result 
came as no surprise. Santa Clara (6-2, 3-0) amassed 334 first-half yards and 
limited Calabasas (1-7, 1-2) to only 40. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara led at halftime, 35-0, and the officials allowed a running clock in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara quarterback Tim Gutierrez, who didn't play in the second half, 
completed six of 10 passes for 119 yards. JEFF RILEY

<P>
The Cal State Dominguez Hills women's soccer team closed out its most 
successful season here Saturday with a 3-0 victory over San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Toros, ranked No. 2 in Division II, got first-half goals from Kristi 
White and Jenny Grasso and a second-half goal from White to improve to 18-2. 
</P>
<P>
Goalie Chris Pezzullo, who only had to record one save, was credited with her 
15th shutout, giving her a school career record. Freshman forward Heather 
Rolland had assists on all three goals. White, a senior, has 17 goals and 16 
assists this season. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State is 3-4. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Toros now await an invitation to the NCAA Division II tournament. The 
four teams will be announced early this week. Domiguez Hills has applied to be 
the host site. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount's men placed third while the women finished last in the West 
Coast Conference cross-country meet at Belmont, Calif. Portland won both team

CAMP KILPATRICK NOTCHES 8TH WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who needs 11 men on a side to play a great football game? 
</P>
<P>
Certainly not Faith Baptist and Camp Kilpatrick, the Nos. 2- and 3-ranked teams 
in the Southern Section Eight-Man Large Division. 
</P>
<P>
The two unbeaten teams tangled Saturday at Faith Baptist and waged a classic 
battle, replete with emotion, great plays, and a vocal crowd of about 300 
cramped into tiny quarters. 
</P>
<P>
So who won? 
</P>
<P>
Why, undoubtedly, that would be Camp Kilpatrick, 41-30. 
</P>
<P>
After all, one had to like the squad that featured Super- . . . , er, Blockman. 
</P>
<P>
Tayon Blockman, that is. 
</P>
<P>
The Camp Kilpatrick junior quarterback-tailback-defensive back engineered the 
exciting come-from-behind win by doing everything but unveiling a red 'S' on 
his chest. 
</P>
<P>
Blockman was able to: 
</P>
<P>
rush for 252 yards in 30 carries. 
</P>
<P>
score three touchdowns, including the Mustangs' final two scores in the fourth 
quarter to erase a 30-27 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
play defense for the first time all season, and he capped his performance by 
breaking up two Faith Baptist passes on the final drive. 
</P>
<P>
"In a tough situation, you go with your best," said Coach Mo Friedman of Camp 
Kilpatrick (8-0). "And he's our best athlete, our best competitor, our greatest 
leader." 
</P>
<P>
Faith Baptist (7-1) , however, put on quite a show itself. Trailing, 27-17, at 
halftime, the Contenders burst out in the second half behind quarterback Gavin 
Amos. After the opening kickoff in the third quarter Amos, who finished with 
130 yards passing and 68 yards rushing, marched Faith Baptist 63 yards and 
scored on an eight-yard run to make the score, 27-23. 
</P>
<P>
After a Mustang fumble was recovered by the Contenders, Amos directed his team 
47 yards before throwing an eight-yard touchdown pass to Alex Estrada to make 
it 30-27 with four minutes to play in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
That set the stage for Blockman's fourth-quarter heroics. "What makes us 
proudest is that the team came back in the fourth quarter when we had to," 
Friedman said.

CAMARILLO AND AGOURA CONTINUE RUN ON TITLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE GLAZE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Little has changed since the Camarillo High boys' cross-country team and Agoura 
High girls' team won titles in the Ventura County championships in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams repeated last year, and both won a third consecutive title in the 
meet held Saturday at Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
There were other constants too. Bryan Dameworth and Deena Drossin, both of 
Agoura, mirrored their performances of the past two years in winning individual 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo placed all five of its scorers among the top 12 to total 35 points, 
well ahead of runner-up Agoura (73) and third-place Westlake (132). 
</P>
<P>
"Agoura High School looked sensational," Camarillo Coach Mike Smith said. "They 
were right in our uniforms." 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth recorded a personal best on the three-mile course of 14 minutes, 56 
seconds to win by 220 meters over Ventura's Roman Morales (15:39). 
</P>
<P>
Drossin (18:00) pulled away from Jeanine Rothman of Westlake at the 1 3/4-mile 
mark to claim her championship by 120 meters. Rothman clocked 18:27 for second 
place. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' team race Agoura, the state's top-ranked team, held on to edge 
Buena, 46-54. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers placed three runners among the top 15, including three in the top 
10. Buena, ranked second in the Southern Section 4-A Division, placed its five 
scorers among the top 16. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it would be close," Agoura Coach Bill Duley said. "At the Fountain 
Valley (Invitational) two weeks ago, I figured them into our race and us into 
their race and we beat them by four points (on paper)." 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth had said that he was pleased with the way he ran the third mile last 
week in the prestigious Mt. San Antonio College Invitational, which he won in 
14:41.8. Despite struggling slightly through the wind and the final mile 
Saturday, the Charger senior still managed to eclipse his best on the Moorpark 
course by 16 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I lost it in the last mile," he said. I was just sort of doggin' it. I 
didn't feel like fighting the wind." 
</P>
<P>
Drossin, however, decided that a slower start would be more advantageous than 
pushing an early pace. 
</P>
<P>
"At Mt. SAC last weekend, I went out way too fast," the junior said. "I was 
really trying to keep my pace slow that first half (mile)."

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / PAUL R. KRUGMAN: CAN WE AVERT THE NEXT FINANCIAL 
CRISIS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL R. KRUGMAN, PAUL R. KRUGMAN is professor of economics at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Consider the following picture: It is a time of peace and prosperity, of 
capitalism triumphant. The Republican Party has overwhelmingly won the past 
three presidential elections, apparently establishing a permanent lock on the 
White House -- and why not, because Republican policies have brought steadily 
rising employment and consumption. Businessmen are the heroes of the age; 
organized labor is in retreat. 
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, a few blots on the picture. Battered by low export prices 
and the burden of their foreign debt, less developed countries do not share in 
the prosperity of the industrial world. Protectionist pressures are rising. 
There are strains on the international system because the traditional leader of 
the world economy is in relative decline, while the most economically dynamic 
major nation remains unwilling to take on its full responsibilities. 
Nonetheless, the fundamental picture is so strong that few would suppose that 
disturbances in the financial markets could produce more than a brief, mild 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
The year, of course, is 1929. Herbert Hoover is President. Britain is the 
declining leader of the international system, and the United States the dynamic 
nation unwilling to step into Britain's shoes. And the greatest economic 
catastrophe of modern history is about to happen. 
</P>
<P>
As the market hiccupped this year on Friday the 13th, the question that 
everyone asked two years ago came around once more: Can it happen again? 
</P>
<P>
A group of economists and policy-makers met recently in Cambridge, Mass., to 
discuss just that issue. Although the discussion was full of disagreements, and 
off the record anyway, I concluded several things from it. 
</P>
<P>
First, in a purely financial sense, crises on the scale of 1929 are if anything 
even more likely than they were 60 years ago. Black Monday in 1987 was actually 
worse than Black Thursday in 1929, and the global spread of the stock crash in 
1987 was faster and more complete than that of 1929. Computers and faster 
communications apparently don't make markets any more rational; they just allow 
panic to spread more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the modest reforms undertaken since 1987 have done little if 
anything to reduce the vulnerability of the market to crashes. As it turned 
out, Friday the 13th didn't develop into a full replay of Black Monday -- but 
it certainly could have. 
</P>
<P>
On the more optimistic side, financial crises do not have to turn into real 
depressions. In October, 1987, a few sensible things were done, and the effect 
was to insulate the real economy almost completely from the effects of 
financial panic. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, the Federal Reserve acted quickly to pour credit into the economy 
after the crash, abandoning for the time being both its monetary targets and 
any attempt to stabilize the dollar. Money growth accelerated to levels that 
horrified monetarists, and the dollar plunged 17% against the Japanese yen; but 
the crisis was contained. For most of the population, the stock market crash 
was purely a spectator event. 
</P>
<P>
What I learned from the historical discussion, however, was that the contrast 
between disaster in 1929 and successful containment of crisis in 1987 was not 
because of any fundamental change in the vulnerability of the economy. Had the 
Federal Reserve acted in 1929 as it did in 1987, there would almost surely have 
been no Great Depression. On the other hand, had the Federal Reserve acted in 
1987 the way it did in 1929, we would not now be shrugging the whole thing off 
as a temporary market aberration. The difference between then and now was 
primarily one of leadership, not institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders deserve praise, of course, but it is worrisome when so much hangs 
on having a few men do exactly the right things. As one conference participant 
put it, we have relied on brilliant chairmen of the Federal Reserve to deal 
with financial crises twice in one decade; will our chairmen always be so 
brilliant? 
</P>
<P>
What is particularly worrisome is that many economic pundits advocate policies 
that would have ruled out the actions that insulated the real economy from 
financial panic in 1987. Suppose, in particular, that the kind of economists 
favored by the Wall Street Journal -- people such as Stanford's Ronald McKinnon 
or Columbia's Robert Mundell -- had been at the helm in the weeks after Black 
Monday. What would these people, whom we may refer to as "global monetarists," 
have done? The answer is, nothing -- or worse than nothing. 
</P>
<P>
As advocates of a real or simulated gold standard, they would have fiercely 
opposed the policy of rapid credit expansion that sterilized the real impact of 
the crash while driving down the dollar; this is especially true because the 
global monetarists insist on regarding the dollar as seriously undervalued. 
Since the crash would have placed downward pressure on the dollar even without 
a rapid credit expansion, and since this downward pressure would have been 
reinforced by speculation about possible future dollar depreciation, a global 
monetarist approach would actually have required a considerable credit 
contraction. 
</P>
<P>
The result would have been to turn the market slump into a major real slump as 
well. Probably our economy is not as depression-prone as the economy of 1929, 
but the result would still have been disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of this scenario is not to emphasize how bad the economic analysis 
is at the Wall Street Journal or how bad the advice given by some economists is 
(although both points are true enough). Instead, the point is that we were all 
very lucky: The sensible and timely policies that actually averted disaster 
were carried out in the teeth of advice from seemingly reasonable and 
respectable voices. 
</P>
<P>
Someone once pointed out that the reason that the Romans, not the Greeks, ended 
up ruling the world was that while Hellenistic armies could perform miracles 
under brilliant leadership, Roman armies could manage adequately with mediocre 
generals -- which is more important in the long run. Unfortunately, we seem to 
have a Greek, not a Roman, world financial system. So the answer is yes -- it 
can happen again, though not under current management. 
</P>
<P>
Yet that was not the observation that most depressed me about the conference on 
crises. For the time being, at least, we seem to know what to do about stock 
market crashes and to have a leadership that is prepared to act on what we 
know. There is, however, another kind of international financial crisis: the 
kind of crisis that happens when a heavily indebted country's creditors decide 
that it is no longer a good risk. This is the kind of crisis that hit Latin 
America in 1982 and that may someday hit the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, we do not seem to know how to manage debt crises. The same 
people who averted financial crises in 1982 and 1987 have attempted to deal 
with the Latin American problem for the past seven years. They have organized 
emergency loans, collective bargaining between debtors and creditors, 
international coordination on a grand scale. And the result? A decade of 
declining living standards, soaring unemployment and hyper-inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Latin America has done worse in the '80s than it did in the '30s. Predictions 
of a hard landing for the United States have so far not come true, but then 
people who worried about Third World debt were widely regarded as cranks right 
up to the moment of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
So there won't be a replay of 1929 in the near future; but if you want to see 
America turn into Argentina, it's a possibility.

WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: EVEN THE PROS ARE FED UP WITH PROGRAM TRADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CRUDELE, JOHN CRUDELE is a financial columnist for the New York Post. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is one consolation for the small investor whose confidence in the stock 
market might have been shaken by its volatility because of computerized program 
trading. Wall Street professionals -- the guys who make their living trading 
stocks -- aren't very happy with program trading either, and their confidence 
is also shot. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a high level of frustration right now regarding program trading," a 
trader for one of Wall Street's top brokerages said on the floor of the New 
York Stock Exchange. "This type of volatility is not good for anyone." His 
firm, incidentally, is one of the nation's biggest program traders. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't quite true that program trading helps no one. 
</P>
<P>
A volatile stock market, while it might do long-term damage to investor 
confidence, can be a bonanza for quick and agile money managers and traders who 
can instantly shift millions of dollars among stocks, bonds and equity futures 
and options. If you are playing the arbitrage game, then this volatility is 
perfect for you. 
</P>
<P>
Said one Wall Streeter: "They like the volatility. It gives them a chance to 
make money. It's the only way they can make money." 
</P>
<P>
And there is another short-term benefit of chaos: Brokerages are likely to reap 
extra commissions if small investors are scared into selling their stocks when 
the market hits one of its sinkholes. And they pocket another commission if the 
small investors decide to buy the stocks back, as they did on Oct. 16, once 
prices have fallen. But most Wall Street pros realize, after the tremors of the 
past week, that something has to change to keep the stock market from 
degenerating into the biggest gambling hall outside Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the pros have really had it. If they don't put an end to this, I don't 
know what will happen," another irate trader said. 
</P>
<P>
That opinion was widely shared last week. While many traders were willing to 
express their opinions, they all asked for anonymity. Their bosses, they 
assumed, still like program trading. 
</P>
<P>
This disdain for program trading among professionals is new. Most Wall 
Streeters have been tolerating program trading in much the same way that New 
Yorkers put up with slow traffic. If you can't do anything about it, why 
complain? 
</P>
<P>
Professional traders still may not be able to do anything about program 
trading, (especially now that the New York Stock Exchange is adding a program 
trading instrument of its own), but after this week, complaining about it makes 
them feel better. 
</P>
<P>
Kemper Financial Services, a Chicago-based company that manages about $57 
billion in assets, took its protest one step farther. It stopped doing business 
with four brokerages that use program trading for their own accounts. Late last 
week, Hartford, Conn.-based Phoenix Mutual Life, which manages more than $8.6 
billion in assets, said it refused to do business with firms using program 
trading. And Paine Webber said it will not execute program trading orders for 
customers; the Wall Street brokerage has not used program trading for its own 
account since May 1988. If you had to pinpoint when the pros' tolerance for 
program trading turned to hate, it was probably between 10:30 and 11 last 
Tuesday morning, when the Dow Jones industrial average started rallying from an 
unexpected 85-point deficit. The index ended that day at a loss of just under 4 
points, in what was one of the most volatile and perplexing sessions anyone 
could remember. 
</P>
<P>
"This industry is in a sad state of affairs," said yet another trader, who 
added that he, personally, isn't buying or selling many shares these days. 
"We're out of the market," he said. Why? He answered that it's too dangerous 
even for him. 
</P>
<P>
Here's what happened last Tuesday that got traders so upset: 
</P>
<P>
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and Salomon Bros., two of Wall Street's biggest 
investment houses, that morning began selling bushels-full of stocks in 
asset-allocation programs, according to sources. An asset-allocation program 
uses computers to decide how much should be invested in stocks, bonds and other 
financial instruments. By allocating assets, Goldman Sachs and Salomon, for 
whatever reason, were simply deciding that it was time to sell stocks and buy 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
That burst of selling, along with the price of UAL stock going into another 
free fall, put the entire stock market on its ear and had even the coolest pros 
thinking that another crash was coming. 
</P>
<P>
Then, suddenly -- and mysteriously -- the selling stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman, Sachs; Salomon and other brokerages turned on a dime and started 
buying huge volumes of stock through trading programs. The word on Wall Street 
was that regulators had warned the brokerage firms that they must "cease and 
desist" using computerized programs to unload stocks. But whether there was 
such a warning or this was simply Wall Street gossip, an attempt to explain the 
unexplainable, could not be determined. 
</P>
<P>
The change in direction Tuesday morning was so abrupt that even fleet-footed 
professional traders got caught by surprise. And with that, the pros all of a 
sudden could understand what small investors have been going through these past 
few years. 
</P>
<P>
The pros, almost in unison, started murmuring under their breath that they 
despised program trading as much as the next guy. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate the market," said a trader. "We are doing virtually nothing. The market 
is a big casino. If that's what they want to convey to the public, they should 
continue program trading." 
</P>
<P>
This sense of ire over program trading comes at an odd time. A strong case 
could be made that there is nothing keeping the stock market at current levels 
except programmed buying that kicks in whenever stock prices fall. 
</P>
<P>
The market will decline in time, anyway, but without an assist from the 
computers, stock prices would be falling right now, in reaction to the nation's 
weakening economy. 
</P>
<P>
By now even the most stubborn optimist realizes that companies aren't doing as 
well as they have been in recent years. But just how much has their profit 
performance deteriorated? 
</P>
<P>
Boston Co. has been keeping track of third-quarter profit reports during the 
past few weeks, and it thinks that if the current earnings trend continues, 
profits will be up a modest 6% this year. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, profits risen around 20% a year for the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
That 6% growth this year, however, is mostly thanks to strong profits in the 
first quarter. Profits have been sliding all year, and third-quarter profits 
will probably be down 5% to 8% from last year's third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Earnings-per-share performance looks even worse, although in calculating 
earnings on a per-share basis, the figures are often skewed by extraordinary 
occurences such as one-time charges against earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Boston Co., meanwhile, thinks the worst is yet to come. Allen Sinai, its chief 
economist, says that "with the economy slowing down and labor costs still high, 
the squeeze on profits will continue. The outlook for corporate earnings in 
1990 would be flat to somewhat higher, at best." 
</P>
<P>
"That's a symptom and a possible cause of some sort of recession," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
Lower corporate profits, of course, should mean a weaker stock market. And the 
worse the profit picture gets, the harder the market is going to fall. 
</P>
<P>
Last week was the first time in a long while that the market started reacting 
to weak earnings. While the bond market rallied on the prospect of lower 
interest rates early last week, stock traders realized that borrowing costs 
would only fall because the economy is in bad shape. 
</P>
<P>
The stock market could soon be bothered by something else. According to the 
investment firm Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan, the profits being reported by 
corporations are lower than Wall Street had expected. 
</P>
<P>
Often, the stock market will ignore poor earnings if it was expecting them, but 
it doesn't like to be surprised with bad news. 
</P>
<P>
Did you know that the estate of Elvis Presley earns $41,095.80 on an average 
day? President Bush earns $547.95. Those facts are from a strange but 
interesting new paperback full of tidbits, "On An Average Day" (Fawcett 
Columbine). . .

WHAT ROLE SHOULD THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY PLAY AS CALIFORNIA RECOVERS FROM THE 
QUAKE AND PLANS FOR THE FUTURE?

<P>
Should business take a greater role in helping to upgrade California's roads, 
bridges and other infrastructure after the devastating Bay Area earthquake? If 
so, what should business do? Privatize government services? Coordinate real 
estate development? Fund research programs on improved highway construction? 
Pay user fees? 
</P>
<P>
 To get answers to these and other questions, Times researcher Melanie Pickett 
conducted separate interviews with Jane Pisano, president of the L.A. 2000 
Partnership; Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles Area Chamber of 
Commerce; Nelson Rising, senior partner with Maguire Thomas Partners, a Santa 
Monica-based real estate developer; Tom Schumacher, executive vice president 
and general manager, California Trucking Assn., and Robert W. Taggart, vice 
president-public affairs, Southern Pacific Transportation Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Excerpts of the interviews follow: 
</P>
<P>
 How can business become more involved in upgrading California's 
infrastructure? 
</P>
<P>
Pisano: The best thing the business community can do is be supportive of the 
investment that will be required to both retrofit existing infrastructure and 
also provide the infrastructure we will need as we anticipate (future) 
population growth . . . What we're seeing now is a failure of our entire 
community -- of which the business community is only one part -- to invest in 
our infrastructure over a long period of time, dating at least back to the 
passage of Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
Schumacher: It's time for local governments to say, "Hey, we can't have any 
more growth in this area because if we have a disaster we're going to be unable 
to cope." Maybe it's time for business to sit down with local entities (to) 
geographically balance our employment and investment programs so that we don't 
have these high densities along these corridors that get so seriously disrupted 
in times of disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Rising: The biggest problem we face in this state is we have been living in a 
fool's paradise for 20 years. The gas tax has been almost static, with one 
slight raise, while inflation has taken things completely out of kilter. In the 
post-Proposition 13 era, we haven't been able to spend for important public 
works projects, and as a result our infrastructure is woefully inadequate, and 
that's one of the reasons we have the terrible traffic problems that we have. 
</P>
<P>
How can business get involved? 
</P>
<P>
Pisano: You already see discussion of some innovative solutions. The prospect 
of a toll road in Orange County (or privatizing) either the building or 
operation and maintenance of some infrastructure services, whether it's a 
sewage treatment plant or whatever. But there is a limit to what the business 
community can and should do. 
</P>
<P>
Taggart: One of the many lessons that we've learned from this earthquake is how 
fragile our highway system really is (and) how we really have to concentrate on 
alternative modes (of transportation) . . . A lot of what is included in the 
Rail Bond Initiative (a measure on the June, 1990, ballot that would raise 
money to purchase existing railroad rights of way in California to be used for 
public transportation corridors) perhaps deserves even more attention now. 
</P>
<P>
Kyser: We (in California) are very strong in architecture and engineering, and 
I think architecture and engineering firms are in for a lot of business in the 
years ahead. It was announced (recently) that a research program (funded by the 
construction industry) at USC School of Engineering (will) look at how they can 
improve concrete structures. The business community is going to have to get 
more involved, educate their constituency. 
</P>
<P>
(Business can't afford to be) so inward looking, it's going to have to have a 
more public face. They will have to get out and take stands on this. . . . 
Infrastructure is going to be a key need in the '90s. It's going to be a burden 
for us, but it will also be an opportunity because we have the strength in 
architectural and engineering firms here and the engineering schools. 
</P>
<P>
How do you assess the various proposals to raise revenues for these projects: 
gas tax increase, user fees, higher sales tax? 
</P>
<P>
Kyser: The big challenge for all industry in Southern California is several 
things on the June, 1990, ballot. One is the split-roll tax initiative (in 
which residential and commercial property would be assessed at different rates 
for tax purposes). The other is the proposal to increase the gas tax to provide 
more money for our transportation infrastructure -- both freeways, regular 
highways and mass transit. They also want to make alterations so we aren't so 
constrained by the Gann limit. 
</P>
<P>
Do you think that business is going to go for the split-roll tax? 
</P>
<P>
Kyser: No. I think everybody in the business community is saying this is not 
the way to go. Because (it will) really put a tax burden on business and would 
serve to make California a less attractive place for business. And we're 
already fighting the image of having high operating costs and high housing 
costs. We are just a high-cost place in which to do business. And that puts us 
at a competitive disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
Rising: At some point there is going to be a recognition that there are 
important functions of government that should be carried out and should be 
encouraged. And people are going to reject the politician who blindly says "I 
won't raise taxes no matter what." If somebody had said, "Look, we need to have 
an intelligent rebuilding or continuing upgrade of our transportation 
infrastructure" and just had the gas tax go up with inflation, nothing more, 
then we'd have a lot of our problems solved. 
</P>
<P>
Because industry relies so heavily on infrastructure, can an argument be made 
that it have a greater share of the responsibility for maintaining and 
upgrading those facilities? 
</P>
<P>
Kyser: Everybody has to pay their fair share. And I think that's what you want. 
The favorite trick is to try to say we're going to load all the cost on 
business and they can afford it. Maybe they can't. Because 94% of the 
businesses in Southern California are small businesses with 50 or fewer 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Rising: The real fair way to do it would be to say that if it's a 
transportation-related item then why not have those who use transportation 
services pay for it in the form of gas taxes. . . . I think the same thing goes 
for sewer fees or for the use of any other utility. 
</P>
<P>
Do you see business opposing user fees since, as larger users, they would pay 
more? 
</P>
<P>
Rising: If the business community looks intelligently about how they can 
prosper in California, it's going to be with a state that has adequate 
infrastructure. One of the reasons California grew and prospered in the '50s 
and the '60s was because we were far-sighted. Because there was enough 
foresight to build the California aqueduct project and the freeway system and 
the university system. There is no magic solution, there is no quick fix other 
than an approach and a philosophy to government that would say there are 
certain valid functions of government we should tax in order to have those 
dollars.

ERMA BOMBECK: A FEW OF HER DAD'S UNFAVORITE THINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My father has always been hard to buy for. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone in the family even has a clue as to what to get for his birthday or 
Christmas, we guard it like the last soft cream in a Whitman's Sampler. 
</P>
<P>
When he became less active, the choices became fewer and fewer. I was down to 
peanut brittle, a subscription to TV Guide and cute coffee mugs when I came up 
with the idea of a canary to keep him company. I knew it would bring joy to his 
passive life. 
</P>
<P>
The bird drove him nuts. According to my father, it chirped and dropped 
disgusting things from its body on a paper all day. I told him the bird did not 
demand an audience to evaluate it and applaud every minute. 
</P>
<P>
Then one day the bird stopped chirping and that drove him up the wall too. My 
father said he knew it was something he did. It only sang when "Santa Barbara" 
came on, and annoyed my mother. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, I thought the zap gun for bugs was a winner. I saw it in the drugstore 
and figured it was a marriage made in heaven. My dad hates crickets, and he 
hates to get out of his chair to swat them. This was a little plastic gun with 
a string and a cork attached so that when you pulled the trigger, it zapped 
anything two or three feet away. 
</P>
<P>
For the first few months, my dad shouted, "Make my day!" and let loose with his 
new secret weapon with regularity. But eventually the novelty of the toy wore 
off. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, I entered a store and saw before me a field of dancing flowers 
(batteries not included). They were activated by sound . . . preferably a loud 
rock 'n' roll beat. Aloud, I said: "My father needs this." 
</P>
<P>
When he took it out of the box, he looked at the 12-inch potted blossom wearing 
sunglasses and clutching a saxophone in its leaves and said, "That's nice." I 
said, "Wait a minute! It dances!" Call me crazy, but as I watched him stare at 
the flower gyrating, I had the feeling this pastime would never replace the 
Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge to present him with a gift that will get his attention goes on. 
I'll come up with something. I always do. As I dried the dishes after the 
flower fiasco, one of my kids wandered into the kitchen and picked up a mug I 
had given my dad last Christmas. It showed a pregnant girl saying, "I forgot my 
pill." I explained to my son that when I gave it to his grandfather, it had a 
special meaning for him. My son just looked at me. Maybe it was a bit of a 
stretch.

MS SUFFERERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Please be advised that Falana speaks as an individual with MS and not as a 
spokesperson for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. MS is a remarkably 
complex disease that, unfortunately, still has no cure and only limited 
treatment. In many cases the disease is progressive; in others, people will 
suffer severe symptoms and then return to close to their original functioning. 
</P>
<P>
The factors which contribute to the disease's course are still largely unknown. 
There are an estimated 250,000 people in the United States with MS and the 
methods they use to deal with it are as varied as the people themselves. If the 
disease progresses, it certainly isn't a negative reflection upon their will, 
faith or desire to heal. 
</P>
<P>
We hope that the day will soon arrive when we can finally put this disease to 
rest.

SAVAGING REV. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.'S REPUTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is interesting to note that Ralph David Abernathy is vice-president of the 
board of directors of the American Freedom Coalition, one of the most 
ferociously right-wing, allegedly Moonie-backed groups that currently exists in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Is his biography of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. truly a quest for truth, or 
is it one more attempt to discredit those men and women who fight for the civil 
liberties of the disenfranchised?

MS SUFFERERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lola Falana may believe that her faith in God "cured" her multiple sclerosis 
(MS), but she has no right to imply that the rest of us with this disease are 
her spiritual inferiors because we haven't been cured of a disease that medical 
science recognizes as incurable at the present time ("Private Lives," by Betty 
Goodwin, Oct. 19). 
</P>
<P>
Besides holding out false hopes, Falana's comments are guilt-inducing and 
promote a blame-the-victim attitude that is both unfair and damaging to people 
with MS. 
</P>
<P>
As one who has lived with this disease for many years, some of which I have 
spent as a peer counselor for others with MS, I also resent Falana's comments 
on the use of canes, crutches, etc. She has the right to reject such items 
herself, but for some people, going without walking aids leads to broken bones 
and/or an unnecessarily limited life style. Her statements simply make a hard 
situation even harder. 
</P>
<P>
In short, Ms. Falana, don't use your prominence as a performer to preach a 
message that does nothing more than undermine the efforts of other people who 
are dealing with MS.

POSTER CONTEST SHOWS YOUNGSTERS' VIEW OF AREA IS SLANTED TOWARD SLOW GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN YAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To win $150 in a poster contest, 11-year-old Sherwin Arzani was supposed to 
paint a "Wonderful Westwood," but instead, he painted "Help, please" over 
Westwood high-rises sticking out of a globe. 
</P>
<P>
Like many children who entered the poster and essay contests to celebrate 
Westwood's 60th birthday, Sherwin saw the down side of Westwood and echoed the 
slow growth philosophy that their parents advocate. 
</P>
<P>
Sixth-grader Tracy Nishida wrote that "tons of things will be better" if there 
were fewer people in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
On a more poetic but just as serious note, Jaclynn Davis, 8, said in her essay, 
"Oh Westwood, how you fill me with glory, but I really have to say, you need to 
be quieter in the middle of the day." 
</P>
<P>
Those thoughts and similar ones from young minds revealed a surprise to contest 
judges and sponsors: Children share with adults the concerns about serious 
problems. About 250 children wrote essays on ways to improve Westwood -- hiring 
the homeless to build a park and barring car traffic from the city -- and 
painted posters in contests to involve the young, an effort spearheaded by 
Celebrate Westwood's 60th, the group overseeing the city's festivities. 
</P>
<P>
The contests' organizer, David Hekmat, interpreted Sherwin's artwork. "He's 
concerned about development, congestion, pollution," Hekmat said, "and what 
he's trying to say is that if you don't do something, Westwood is going to be a 
time bomb and one of these days, it's going to explode." 
</P>
<P>
One of the essay judges, a 20-year Westwood resident, said the children's 
writing opened his eyes to the problems in the city and to what children are 
thinking about. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't noticed there was that much graffiti in Westwood and that much 
homelessness in Westwood," said UCLA professor Sol Cohen. "I was quite 
impressed by the thoughtfulness in which the kids approached the contest. The 
most surprising thing is their sympathy for the homeless, the hungry, the broke 
. . . more sympathetic, I imagine, than their parents would be. They want 
something done about the homeless . . . giving them jobs, planting trees and 
flowers, so they can buy food. There was none of this 'Clear them out.' " 
</P>
<P>
Some children, including Sahar Tchaitchian, saw Westwood in a more romantic 
light. Her poster, which won first place in the elementary level, featured a 
birthday cake and stars with words such as boutiques describing what she likes 
about Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always excitement when you're there," the 11-year-old said in an 
interview. "You feel the warmth from the people and there's energy from UCLA. 
It's like a little village and people everywhere come and leave their worries 
behind." 
</P>
<P>
Westwood merchants and residents finished judging about 250 essays and posters 
last week, picking four winners for each contest. Local banks and businesses 
donated $1,200 in cash prizes. Posters are on view at Westside and Westwood 
savings banks until Tuesday, and Celebrate Westwood's 60th is considering 
publishing the essays. In addition, contest winners got a chance to ride in a 
fire engine Friday as part of UCLA's homecoming parade. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sherwin, the time bomb artist, did not win the poster contest, he 
said, "Everywhere you look in Westwood there's a problem, and I was trying to 
see if I could find a solution to one of them." 
</P>
<P>
And if contestants like Sherwin are Westwood's future, Cohen said he is 
optimistic about the coming years. "Most people don't see kids as public 
spirited and concerned citizens. I think they'd like to be involved, like to be 
asked to clean up, plant trees, help the homeless. I only hope that they don't 
move too far away and that they indeed become adult citizens of Westwood and 
retain their caring concern for the future of Westwood."

HAZARDOUS WASTE IN HOME A CONCERN; 
</P>
<P>
TOXICS: LONG BEACH TURNS TO DEVELOPING A STATE-REQUIRED PLAN FOR DEALING WITH 
DANGEROUS HOUSEHOLD WASTE, EVEN THOUGH SOME QUESTION WHETHER THERE IS A 
PROBLEM. 
</P>

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paint thinner, oven cleaner, fingernail polish they can all develop split 
personalities around the house. 
</P>
<P>
On the garage shelf or under the kitchen sink, they're everyday household 
items. In the trash can, they suddenly become hazardous waste, possessing some 
of the same corrosive, flammable or toxic qualities as the carefully regulated 
hazardous waste of industry. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the half-empty bottle of garden pesticide or carburetor cleaner typically 
gets tossed in the trash to be carted away by the garbage truck to the local 
landfill, or in the case of Long Beach, to the local trash incinerator. 
</P>
<P>
For all the attention heaped on industrial hazardous waste during the past 
decade, domestic hazardous waste has gotten relatively little. Like the 
majority of cities in the state, Long Beach has no program for collection and 
special treatment of household hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
"You know there is nothing and everybody is appalled," insisted Virginia 
Siegel, a recycling activist and member of the city's new solid waste advisory 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Well, not quite everybody. "Historically, household hazardous waste has not 
been viewed as the top problem we have had to deal with," commented Bill Davis, 
manager of the city's solid waste bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, a wide-ranging state recycling law passed last month will require 
all California cities to develop plans for dealing with household hazardous 
waste by July of 1991. Next year the state will also start distributing grant 
money to counties and cities to develop household hazardous waste programs. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Long Beach Health Department is talking to Los Angeles County 
about holding a county collection day in Long Beach, probably once a year. And 
when the recently created city position of hazardous materials coordinator is 
filled, that person's responsibilities will include household hazardous waste, 
said Dick Smith, hazardous waste operations officer in the city's Health and 
Human Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
A wide variety of household products are considered hazardous waste, such as 
used motor oil, varnishes, nail polish remover, insecticides and window 
cleaners. Some of them can legally be disposed of in a landfill, others, like 
motor oil, cannot. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the quantities of such materials that wind up in municipal garbage 
vary enormously. When consultant Gary Mitchell conducted a study for the 
federal Environmental Protection Agency three years ago, his company concluded 
that only about one-half of 1% of typical municipal trash was household 
hazardous waste. His company also failed to document any environmental damage 
that could specifically be traced to household hazardous waste, other than 
occasional fires in garbage trucks. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Mitchell found that the cost of collection programs can be 
enormous, ranging as high as $9 a pound, which amounts to $18,000 a ton. 
Indeed, the six collection days held by the city of Los Angeles so far this 
year have cost about $1.5 million, including publicity, collection and 
disposal, according to the Los Angeles Public Works Department. Some of the 
material is recycled and some is shipped to special hazardous-waste treatment 
facilities, which are very costly. 
</P>
<P>
"These collection days are extremely expensive," Mitchell said in a telephone 
interview from Georgia. "They are not cost effective. The money could be better 
spent to educate the public about household hazardous waste. . . . I think the 
furor over household hazardous waste is blown way out of proportion." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell argues that it would be more prudent for government to concentrate on 
eliminating household hazardous waste to begin with. For instance, 
environmental programs should be mounted to get people to use up all of their 
pesticides by sharing them with neighbors, or letting paint dry out before 
discarding it. With a bit of a chuckle he even suggests using up odd remnants 
of paint by brushing it on old pieces of wood and throwing out the wood. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists also advocate using nontoxic alternatives around the house, 
such as a mixture of vinegar and water instead of window cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's arguments notwithstanding, there is a camp that contends that 
however small the quantity, household toxics can have a cumulative harmful 
effect in landfills and trash incinerators, contributing to water and air 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Some are also dubious of strategies to reduce domestic hazardous waste. Sniffs 
Siegel, "Just for fun I wanted to take a can of paint and see how long it would 
take to dry." 
</P>
<P>
City officials insist that Long Beach's new trash-to-energy incinerator was 
designed to burn whatever shows up in typical household trash, including small 
amounts of hazardous waste. Davis said the boilers can handle the small 
explosions from such things as a can of paint, adding, "These are designed to 
take almost literally land mines." 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the regional air quality board said that while environmental 
tests are still being conducted on the plant, which burns refuse to produce 
electricity, thus far there have been no air pollution problems that could be 
linked to the burning of household hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the practical arguments over collection programs for domestic 
hazardous waste, Smith said his office gets a call about once a week from 
someone wondering what to do with their leftover paint or motor oil. "People 
want to do something," he noted.

CAMPBELL LEAVING SENATE WHERE EVEN PALS CRITICIZE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: SOME SAY THE STATE SENATOR FROM HACIENDA HEIGHTS RESIGNED BECAUSE HE 
WAS TIRED OF BEING UNDER ATTACK FOR THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS.

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With sweat running down his neck and his jaw working a wad of gum, Sen. William 
Campbell stormed the committee room during the closing days of the legislative 
session, chasing down his colleagues and pleading for their support. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) was scouring the crucial Assembly 
Ways and Means Committee for the one last vote he needed to resurrect his most 
controversial measure of the year -- a $1.4-million tax break for a Contra 
Costa County millionaire who was donating his classic car collection to UC 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Unofficially, however, the stakes were much higher for the senator, who 
represents Whittier, La Mirada, La Habra Heights and portions of Orange County. 
Campbell, 54, "Hacienda Fats" to his friends, was buttonholing his colleagues 
for votes with the argument that his reputation was on the line. 
</P>
<P>
"He convinced me . . . based on the appeal to his honor," said Assemblywoman 
Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), who gave Campbell the vote he needed after she 
publicly railed against the bill, which was criticized as a tax break for a 
rich man. "The press was calling him a crook. The vindication for him was not 
to run away from it but to keep on going." 
</P>
<P>
It's been a tough time lately for Bill Campbell's honor. Whether that played a 
role in his decision Thursday to quit the Legislature in January to become 
president of the California Manufacturers Assn. is not clear. But some 
political insiders said that Campbell, who was first elected to the Assembly in 
1966 and became a senator in 1976, was tired of being under attack for the last 
two or three years. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell has been criticized for carrying special interest legislation and 
making tens of thousands of dollars for himself, his family and his staff 
through speaking engagements and special functions sponsored and promoted by 
his office. Those activities have been scrutinized by the state Fair Political 
Practices Commission (FPPC), the state attorney general's office and the 
federal Small Business Administration (SBA). 
</P>
<P>
The focus of some of this scrutiny has been Jerome M. Haleva, Campbell's 
longtime top aide, close friend, landlord, legislative tactician, political 
fund-raiser and alter ego. An intense, mustachioed behind-the-scenes operative, 
Haleva, 43, is among the highest paid Sacramento staffers and virtually the 
dean of legislative aides, almost a 41st member of the 40-member Senate. Once 
Campbell leaves the Legislature, Haleva is expected to leave the Senate staff 
and take up lobbying himself. 
</P>
<P>
Together and apart, Campbell and Haleva have made the kind of headlines that 
have given the senator's reputation a drubbing. These include: 
</P>
<P>
* Campbell's sponsorship of the bill tailored to give a large tax break to one 
person -- Kenneth Behring, multimillionaire owner of the Seattle Seahawks and a 
Contra Costa developer. Despite intense publicity and public criticism from his 
colleagues, Campbell and UC officials scraped up barely enough votes to slip 
the measure through in the waning hours of the legislative session. It was 
signed into law by Gov. George Deukmejian on Oct. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said he worked on behalf of Behring because it was "good government" 
to secure such a valuable donation for the UC system. He emphasized that 
Behring has never given him a political contribution. 
</P>
<P>
* Reports about how Campbell's wife, Margene, Haleva and a former top aide, 
Karen L. Smith, have made $452,500 from annual nonprofit conferences for women 
first organized seven years ago on government time by Campbell's staff. As of 
this year, Campbell no longer is associated with the conference, which at its 
height attracted 14,000 women. The attorney general's office is investigating 
payments made to his wife for her job as a consultant to the 1987 conference. 
</P>
<P>
* Several instances in which Campbell or Haleva have failed to disclose gifts 
or outside income. In one case, Haleva failed to report $15,000 he received as 
director of the women's conference in 1986. And this year, both men failed to 
disclose a gift of free limousine service supplied by a New Orleans businessman 
and contributor who asked Campbell for a favor. 
</P>
<P>
* Accepting $46,900 last year for speaking engagements. Campbell, quick-witted 
and glib, consistently has been among the highest paid speakers in the 
Legislature. While defending his income from speeches, which more than doubles 
his annual $40,816 Senate salary, Campbell said recently he understood 
uneasiness about the practice. Reformers have attacked honorariums as a bold 
way for special interests to circumvent contribution laws and put money 
directly in legislators' pockets. Last summer, Campbell voted with his 
colleagues to put a measure on the ballot to ban honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
* Intervention last year by Haleva on state contracts for two campaign 
contributors. One of the contributors, Frank Eugene Raper, had earlier lent 
Haleva $20,000 at below-market interest rates to purchase a home. Raper is a 
close friend of Campbell and managed one of his campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
By Campbell's own interpretation, his reputation already had become somewhat 
muddied when he was brought into the investigation several years ago of 
fireworks manufacturer W. Patrick Moriarty. While never accused of anything 
illegal, Campbell carried legislation on behalf of Moriarty, a friend and 
constituent, to prohibit cities and counties from outlawing so-called "safe and 
sane" fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
The bill -- approved by the Legislature but vetoed by then-Gov. Edmund G. Brown 
Jr. -- became the focus of a wide-ranging investigation of corruption in the 
Capitol. Moriarty eventually went to prison after pleading guilty to bribing 
public officials and public corruptions charges in connection with a poker 
casino he owned in Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with The Times, Campbell defended himself against 
criticism, saying he was a skilled legislator who looks out for the best 
interests of his district. In Los Angeles County, his district also includes 
Hacienda Heights, Rowland Heights, the City of Industry, Walnut, Diamond Bar 
and West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still my own agent," Campbell said. "My responsibility is not to anyone 
who contributes to me. My responsibility is to the people of the 31st 
Senatorial District. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"If I can't provide adequate representation and honest representation to people 
of that district, then I ought to get out of here." 
</P>
<P>
Yet even colleagues who expressed a great deal of affection for Campbell said 
they had begun to wonder about his judgment, especially in a era of heightened 
sensitivity to ethics. They were particularly concerned about the women's 
conferences -- a sore point with the senator that he refused to discuss. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill does things that I wouldn't do," said Sen. William A. Craven 
(R-Oceanside), a veteran legislator who also is a close friend. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I should be in a position where I'm setting up things where I, 
in effect, make money under the guise of a governmental operation," said 
Craven, who added that a women's conference he sponsored in his district lost 
money. "To me, it runs contrary of my concept of what I should be doing." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, who said he was hurt by these and other comments by his colleagues, 
attempted to explain what he characterized as "an unfair assessment." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a very happy person," Campbell said, "and I think there's a feeling that 
if you enjoy what you are doing, and you are getting a lot (more) happiness out 
of it than other people seem to be getting out of it, then maybe there's a 
hidden agenda somewhere, maybe you know something that other people don't 
know." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said he believes he was unfairly tainted as author of the Moriarty 
fireworks bill. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Moriarty) was one of my constituents," said Campbell. "He came to me with 
a problem, we attempted to resolve the problem. But everybody kind of looks 
beyond that and they look and they say, well, something was wrong on that 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said recently he saw nothing wrong with helping out his friends, of 
which he has many inside and outside the Legislature. He has been able to 
easily work with members of the opposite party and counts among his best pals 
both Republicans such as Senate Minority Leader Ken Maddy (R-Fresno) and 
Democrats such as Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) and Assembly 
Speaker Pro Tem Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Many people have stories about Campbell's legendary love of food -- going for 
multiples of desserts, scarfing down 24-ounce steaks, sneaking hamburgers under 
the conference table before lunch. Now he's on a liquid crash diet and exercise 
regimen in which he walks two miles a day with 25-pound weights strapped to his 
body. 
</P>
<P>
"Hacienda Fats," a nickname that amuses him as much as anyone, also is 
extremely funny, poking fun mostly at himself. He was in rare form Thursday 
when the question of his weight came up at the press conference to announce his 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last 10 years, I have lost 1,853 pounds . . . for a net gain of 38," he 
said to a crowd of journalists roaring with laughter. He added: "Let me say 
this about stress -- I've handled stress reasonably well . . . by eating." 
</P>
<P>
But in private, Campbell admits that his ability to amuse is sometimes to his 
detriment. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of my sense of humor, sometimes I'm not taken as seriously as I 
probably ought to be," Campbell said. "But it's my nature and there's nothing 
I'm going to do to change that (but) I'm going to curb it at times." 
</P>
<P>
Having served in the Legislature for all but two of the last 23 years, Campbell 
is skillful in the political process and has built up many friendships that 
help grease the wheels of lawmaking. 
</P>
<P>
As Craven said, "People who are wobbling on an issue will say, 'Oh, hell, it's 
Campbell's bill. It has to be all right. I like him. He's a good fellow. I'll 
vote for him.' " 
</P>
<P>
Campbell counts among his major legislative accomplishments streamlining the 
state's response during disasters such as last week's Bay Area earthquake. He 
sponsored legislation in the last two years that allows the governor to spend 
disaster relief money without first calling an expensive and time-consuming 
special session of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
He also was a key negotiator in the new transportation proposal that goes 
before voters in June. The proposal would raise gasoline taxes to help pay for 
new highways and transit systems. 
</P>
<P>
First elected to the Assembly in 1966, Campbell quit in 1972 and made an 
unsuccessful bid for a seat on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. Out 
of public office, Campbell set up shop in Sacramento as a lobbyist before 
winning reelection to the Assembly in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
It was during that year that Campbell first hooked up with Haleva, who was 
working for an Assembly Democrat and who had arranged for a small number of 
legislators, including Campbell, to travel to the Soviet Union. Shortly 
thereafter, Campbell insisted that Haleva be hired as staff to a new committee 
on fire and emergency services of which Campbell was to be chairman. 
</P>
<P>
"Those two guys, they live together, they eat together, they vacation together. 
It's incredible. I don't understand it fully," says Assembly Speaker Brown, who 
calls Haleva "probably the super staff guy in the Legislature" with "more 
chutzpah than the Lord." 
</P>
<P>
The duo engineer legislation and showcase Campbell's speaking talents while 
keeping up a running dialogue on everything from serious policy-making to 
trivia contests. 
</P>
<P>
"One time we were on a train going from New York to Washington, D.C., or maybe 
it was vice versa, I don't remember which, and for some reason or another, we 
went through Baltimore," Campbell said. "And he (Haleva) said Baltimore is the 
capital of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Annapolis would be sure surprised to hear that,' " Campbell said. 
Thus began an ongoing contest to see who could name the most state capitals. 
</P>
<P>
What Haleva could do was raise money and run Campbell's legislative office. And 
when Campbell won his Senate seat in 1976, he took Haleva with him. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, when Campbell took the plunge and ran for statewide office, Haleva 
took a leave of absence to run his boss's quixotic and expensive campaign for 
state controller. A $400,000 debt remains from that ill-fated effort, according 
to campaign reports this year. 
</P>
<P>
The loss also embittered Haleva, who believes his boss has been given short 
shrift in the political world, said one confidante who asked not to be 
identified. While Haleva's Senate annual salary has grown from $26,136 to 
$100,680, not counting outside income he makes as a political consultant to 
Campbell and others, Campbell's salary has topped out at just over $40,000 plus 
whatever he makes in honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry legitimately feels that Bill is entitled to some benefit," said the 
confidante. "Not illegal benefit, but some benefit from being in that office 
because he does not get paid very much and never particularly had anything." 
</P>
<P>
Whether this had led to indiscretions or not, the two men's political style 
left many with the impression that they were out for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Said one senator about Campbell: "He loves to travel, he loves the good life, 
and so does Jerry Haleva. Both Jerry and Bill have cultivated this life style 
and they've got to find a way to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
That impression was reinforced by recent stories about how Campbell and Haleva 
benefited financially from the women's conference and personally intervened 
with state agencies on behalf of Campbell's contributors. 
</P>
<P>
Records for the women's conferences show that Haleva has earned $15,000 and 
Campbell aide Karen L. Smith $72,500 for the meetings between 1984 and 1987. In 
addition, a consulting firm formed by Campbell's wife and Smith was paid 
$365,000 for setting up the 1987 and 1988 conferences. 
</P>
<P>
When the controversy over the payments erupted last year, Campbell said he saw 
nothing wrong with his wife collecting money as a consultant from an event 
sponsored by his office. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see it as a problem, in all honesty," Campbell told The Times. "The 
question is, 'Could anybody else do that?' I don't know the answer to that, but 
why should I change a successful conference merely because the people 
responsible for the conference happen to work for me or be married to me?" 
</P>
<P>
"When you say, 'Do I profit from it?' indirectly, yes, I do profit from it," 
Campbell continued. "I don't think there's any doubt about that. But why the 
attack on Karen and Margene?" 
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, Campbell has steadfastly declined comment on the 
conferences or to say whether he intends to repay $43,000 to the SBA as the 
agency has requested. The SBA said Campbell violated an oral agreement on how 
much Smith would be paid. 
</P>
<P>
In more recent months, Campbell and Haleva were criticized for trying to help 
out Raper, a neighbor, longtime friend and former campaign chairman for 
Campbell. Raper, owner of United Packaging Corp. of Industry, also loaned 
Campbell $100,000 for his state controller race, which was repaid. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on behalf of Campbell, Haleva called procurement officials on behalf of 
United Packaging as it faced disqualification on a $1.6-million contract to 
supply all of the state's garbage bags. Although the firm was lowest bidder, it 
could not promise delivery within the six-week deadline demanded by the state 
and was in danger of losing the business. 
</P>
<P>
Following Haleva's call, however, procurement officials rewrote the bid 
specifications allowing for the longer delivery time. United Packaging 
eventually was awarded the contract. 
</P>
<P>
Haleva's phone call on behalf of Raper came 16 months after Raper loaned the 
aide $20,000 at a below-market interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
Haleva also pressured the office of state architect to go easy on Asbestos 
Environmental Controls Inc. of New Orleans, which faced disqualification on 
thousands of dollars worth of state contracts because it lacked the proper 
certification for the work. Following Haleva's telephone calls, the architect 
decided to hold off on the disqualification long enough to allow the New 
Orleans firm to file its papers with the state. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the firm had donated $27,000 to Campbell in 1987 and 1988. The 
company's president also provided free limousine service for the senator and 
his aide during the 1988 Republican National Convention in New Orleans.

PUTTING BLACK BEAT IN WHITE GOSPEL SINGERS; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: A LONG BEACH PASTOR PROMOTES RACIAL HARMONY BY SHARING RELIGIOUS CULTURE 
IN PREPARATION FOR A CONCERT NOV. 19. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The rafters at St. John Baptist Church in Long Beach received a thorough 
shaking on a recent Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
First came the rousing strains of such popular gospel numbers as "I'm Blessed" 
and "Follow Me." Then, singing a tune called "Holy, Holy," the choir practiced 
marching up the aisle behind director Johnie Mae Chambers. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you going to show us how to walk now?" one singer asked. "You haven't done 
that yet." 
</P>
<P>
"Give a little shoulder movement," responded Preston Sterling, Chambers' 
assistant. "You're just gonna slide." 
</P>
<P>
Later Chambers advised the group to practice at home by "walking the holy holy" 
during household chores because, she said, it "looks like we're gonna need lots 
of practice." And some choir members expressed the frustration of doing 
something that not too many before them have ever done. "I'm having trouble 
with the time," Lorraine Roberts said. "I'm used to singing with music." 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to an unusual experiment in interracial harmony and the first step in a 
grand vision by the Rev. Ralph J. Mosby, a black minister. His idea: to promote 
racial understanding through the sharing of religious culture. More 
immediately, his goal is to teach white people how to sing the gospel like 
blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to do something creative to draw us all together," said Mosby, the 
pastor of St. John Baptist and president of the South Coast Ecumenical Council. 
An interdenominational group with members from 100 churches in Long Beach, 
Carson and the Palos Verdes Peninsula, the council's goal is to promote ethnic 
and religious understanding in the areas that it serves. 
</P>
<P>
As the spiritual leader of a mostly black congregation, Mosby saw an 
opportunity to do that through music. Like other black church choirs, he said, 
St. John's sings in a uniquely black style that has evolved through generations 
into a genre called "black gospel." According to Mosby, it speaks of his 
people's heartfelt experience from slavery to the ongoing struggle for 
equality. But the music's message is universal, he said. So why not put 
together an interracial black gospel choir whose members and audience would 
expand their horizons by learning from each other through the sharing of music? 
</P>
<P>
Mosby's original vision called for a 500-voice ensemble that would put on a 
concert in downtown Long Beach's historic First Congregational Church on Nov. 
19. The concert date still stands. But the number of respondents -- 
representing churches throughout the area -- has been disappointing, the pastor 
said. And rather than the racial diversity he envisioned, Mosby said, the vast 
majority of singers attending the regular rehearsals scheduled at various area 
churches have been white. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't be disheartened," he told the 15 singers, mostly members of their own 
church choirs, gathered on a recent Saturday morning. "You just do what you 
have to do and have a joyous time in the Lord." 
</P>
<P>
Mosby said he still expects to have 50 to 100 singers by Nov. 19, including a 
large number of blacks who are not attending rehearsals because they already 
know the music. Eventually, he said, he hopes to expand the project to include 
the music and participation of other ethnic and religious groups. But for now, 
he said, it would be nice to have more black singers on hand to help 
demonstrate their musical style to the whites. 
</P>
<P>
"We want (the choir) to learn the rhythms and tonalities of black gospel," 
Mosby said. "Black people have grown up with it." 
</P>
<P>
One obstacle, according to Chambers, an experienced black gospel singer who is 
St. John's minister of music, is that white people tend to clap on the downbeat 
while blacks clap on the upbeat. Another, she said, is the general stiffness of 
the whites as they attempt to perform in an unfamiliar style. And a third, she 
said, is their customary dependence on sheet music as opposed to the 
unstructured sing-it-from-the-heart style in which black gospel is generally 
performed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult," conceded Jean Gebhart, a white singer from Wesley United 
Methodist Church in Long Beach. "We're used to sticking to written music and 
here we just learn as we go along." 
</P>
<P>
Said Chambers: "I don't want it sung pretty. We're making a definite statement; 
we're trying to get them to walk, clap and move their feet." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the whites seem to be enjoying the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's wonderful," Gebhart said. "It's a chance to get to know other 
people and be part of something ecumenical." 
</P>
<P>
Said Mabel Thomas, from First Christian Church of San Pedro: Black gospel 
singers "sing it like they mean it. They really sing it like they're talking to 
the Lord and we could use a little of that." 
</P>
<P>
While the white singers have made remarkable strides, Chambers said, they still 
have a way to go before becoming black gospel artists. "Everybody has it in 
them," she said, "we just need to bring it out." 
</P>
<P>
And what of the characteristic walking, clapping and swaying that usually 
accompanies black gospel music and stems from something commonly referred to as 
"soul?" Chambers smiled and shook her head slightly. "It could be better," she 
said, "we're having a little rhythm problem, but I think rehearsal will take 
care of that."

WASTE-DISPOSAL FIRM AGREES TO SELL LAND INTENDED FOR PUBLIC LANDFILL; 
</P>
<P>
TRASH: THE PRELIMINARY ACCORD WITH THE CITY AND COUNTY SQUASHES EFFORTS BY 
STATE AGENCY TO OBTAIN PARKLAND IN THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In a preliminary accord reached last week, BKK Corp. agreed to sell Los Angeles 
County and city its land holdings at Elsmere Canyon north of Sylmar, moving the 
site a step closer to development as a public landfill, County Supervisor Deane 
Dana said. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary agreement, which Dana said is still "at the handshake stage," 
climaxed nearly a week of intensive maneuvering and political intrigue over 
control of the proposed Elsmere dump, which city and county officials say is 
critical to solving trash-disposal problems. 
</P>
<P>
Dana said the deal, which was made Wednesday night, will be worth about $125 
million to BKK, which had amassed at least 500 acres of land at Elsmere Canyon 
along with options and an agreement in principle with the U.S. Forest Service 
to acquire nearly 1,000 acres of federal lands needed for the dump. 
</P>
<P>
The deal also signified BKK's 11th-hour withdrawal from a unique mutual-aid 
pact with the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, which was scheduled to 
acquire BKK's lands last Thursday -- thus making them condemnation-proof and 
giving the conservancy a bargaining chip in its effort to preserve three other 
canyons as parkland. 
</P>
<P>
Publicly revealed about two weeks ago by The Times, the secret agreement 
between the parks agency and waste disposal firm was meant to strengthen their 
bargaining power in pursuit of vastly different goals. 
</P>
<P>
BKK, which wanted to develop and run the Elsmere dump itself, faced the threat 
that the county would use its power of condemnation to take the land if BKK did 
not agree to sell its interests at a price the county and city were willing to 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
And the conservancy -- a state agency that buys parkland in and near the Santa 
Monica Mountains -- wanted a promise that three other canyons would be saved if 
it acquiesced in the destruction of Elsmere Canyon. The conservancy wanted 
Mission, Rustic and Sullivan canyons in the Santa Monicas, owned by the county 
and independent County Sanitation Districts, to become parkland. 
</P>
<P>
After disclosure of the secret deal, which took effect Thursday, city and 
county officials began intensive negotiations with BKK. The roughly $125 
million BKK will receive is about midway between the county's initial offer of 
more than $50 million and BKK's demand of $200 million to $225 million. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy's secret plan to forcibly inject itself as a figure in the 
negotiations surprised and angered some city and county officials. Yet it 
appeared that the conservancy may get something from the preliminary agreement, 
according to Dana and the conservancy's executive director, Joseph T. Edmiston. 
</P>
<P>
They said that the deal appears to call for Sullivan and Rustic canyons, deep 
pristine clefts covering 1,900 acres, to become parkland either through 
donation or sale to the conservancy or another agency. 
</P>
<P>
But the deal reportedly is silent on the fate of Mission Canyon, where 
politically powerful developer Ray Watt wants to develop 500 expensive homes. 
The 400-acre canyon is already ringed by homes and was used by the Sanitation 
Districts as a dump for a while in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston said parkland status for Sullivan and Rustic canyons would be "a major 
step forward." But he predicted that legislation in Congress to transfer Forest 
Service lands in Elsmere to the city and county will face tough scrutiny from 
environmental interests, which will question whether enough new parkland is 
created to justify a trash dump on Forest Service holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Dana said the conservancy had caused considerable disruption, but was no longer 
a factor because of the 11th-hour deal with BKK. He claimed the conservancy's 
gambit was completely inappropriate because the agency "was going to get . . . 
Rustic and Sullivan canyon anyway." 
</P>
<P>
In their effort to break up the pact between the conservancy and BKK, top city 
officials, including Mayor Tom Bradley, last week had considered orchestrating 
an emergency vote of the conservancy board to void the deal with BKK, Deputy 
Mayor Mike Gage said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
State Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti (D-Los Angeles) confirmed reports 
that Bradley called him Tuesday afternoon to complain about the conservancy-BKK 
deal. He quoted Bradley as saying the BKK-conservancy deal would make 
development of the dump more costly for the city. Bradley also reportedly tried 
to reach Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
Roberti and Brown each appoint one member of the conservancy's decision-making 
board. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti aide Rick Dunne said that, after Bradley's call, he discussed the issue 
with Gage. Dunne said that when Gage mentioned a possible vote on the BKK pact, 
he told Gage that Roberti "tries to appoint quality people but we do not tell 
our appointees . . . how to vote."

NATURAL HISTORY SEEMS TO BE A NATURAL AT ALTADENA BOYS' HOME

Nine-year-old Bobby had never seen much wildlife and had never been to a 
museum. With a mixture of curiosity and excitement, he regarded the life-sized 
stuffed animals, touched the deer antlers and wrapped the fox fur around his 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, volunteers from the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County 
took their show on the road to reach about 40 kids like Bobby -- abused, 
abandoned and emotionally disturbed boys who live and attend school at The 
Sycamores in Altadena.

The official purpose of the museum volunteers' visit was to provide children 
who are unable to visit museums an opportunity to learn about subjects like 
mammals and dinosaurs. But for many of the boys, it was much more than that. 
</P>
<P>
Getting the boys to participate was no problem. With each question asked, they 
raised their arms eagerly, competing to answer first. 
</P>
<P>
They patted coyote and grizzly bear furs and bison horns and howled when they 
were asked to identify a picture of a wolf. One boy volunteered to place the 
largest fur in the exhibit over his body and crawl about the floor, imitating a 
black bear. 
</P>
<P>
Museum volunteers not only answered questions from the boys, but also used a 
story board to teach them about mammal wildlife and took them on an imaginary 
journey through animal habitats. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like it's still real," Bobby said while touching a stuffed prairie 
dog. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby, wearing a yellow T-shirt, blue jeans and tennis shoes, then picked up a 
coyote fur, wrapped it around his head, and said, "It's neat." 
</P>
<P>
Bobby is one of 60 residents at The Sycamores. They range in age from 6 to 14 
and are referred by the Los Angeles County Departments of Mental Health and 
Children's Services, public schools and occasionally by area families. 
</P>
<P>
Cecille Rasmussen, a volunteer docent for the museum, started off the 45-minute 
class by asking her group of 8- to 11-year-old boys, "What is a mammal?" 
</P>
<P>
A boy, wearing a cap, a Batman T-shirt and jeans, eagerly raised his hand and 
answered, "Mammals are warm-blooded animals that reproduce." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a group of older boys, aged 11 to 13, were learning about 
dinosaurs in another room. They handled dinosaur models, snake skins, fossils, 
plants and dinosaur teeth. 
</P>
<P>
A 12-year-old boy from North Pasadena said he enjoyed the program because "it 
was real educational." The youth touched furs and horns for the first time 
during the presentation. 
</P>
<P>
"You normally wouldn't get to touch the horns of buffaloes," he said. "It's sad 
to see how they are all getting extinct." 
</P>
<P>
The youth, who has lived at The Sycamores for more than a year, said he had 
grown socially and academically at the home. 
</P>
<P>
"I like reading and writing. I want to be a writer. I like to write rap 
(songs)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's program was the first time volunteers from the museum's Special 
Educational Outreach Program visited the boys' home, said Michael Schaller, 
principal and director of educational services. 
</P>
<P>
Outside regular classroom activities, there have been speakers and other 
educational programs provided for the boys, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gone out to the Huntington Library to have botany classes. We've had 
people from the sheriff's and fire department come out, too," Schaller said. 
</P>
<P>
The boys are encouraged not to limit themselves academically. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these boys will graduate from college," he said. "We try to show them 
that they have to apply themselves to work hard. We want them to work up to 
their potential. We try to make them feel like they have control over their own 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
The Sycamores was founded by a group of concerned women in 1902 as a home and 
training school for neglected, homeless, orphaned and abandoned children. It 
was called the Pasadena Children's Training Society until the institution moved 
to Altadena in the 1960s, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Today, three cottages house 14 boys each, and three group homes house six boys 
each. 
</P>
<P>
Although the education they get is important, the main benefit for boys at The 
Sycamores is that they have a safe and stable home environment, said Rebecca 
Chapman, director of development and public relations. 
</P>
<P>
"They learn trust and problem-solving," Chapman said. "These kids get bounced 
around enough as it is. Our goal is to keep them as long as we can do them some 
good and then move them to better homes."

MASTER PLAN FOR CIVIC CENTER: LET WISDOM PREVAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pasadena has been blessed frequently in the past when, after much labor and 
debate, the city Board of Directors did not adopt a proposed plan. This has 
enabled us to avoid serious mistakes and gross errors in direction planning. 
</P>
<P>
The Livingston/Blaney study of Colorado Boulevard was such a case where we 
would have destroyed the center of town if we had carried out the plan. The 
study did provide valuable review and input for later planning consideration, 
however, and it was the trigger for revitalization of the central business 
area. 
</P>
<P>
The present Civic Center Master Plan is a similar case where the study and 
review is of tremendous value for our future, provided we do not take its 
pontifical self-important edicts too much to heart and do not bind our future 
in a straitjacket of detailed requirements that can only stifle the creativity 
that needs to be available in our planning process. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena Chamber of Commerce &amp; Civic Assn. would like the city board to 
leave this "Plan" as an unadopted legacy of study, containing many useful ideas 
and thoughts but not an absolute mandate from anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately most of us do not have the gift of long foresight. Because we see 
backward much better, we prefer to plan from that vantage point while extolling 
the virtues of that time. There is nothing wrong with building on the past, but 
we should let our successors have the right to their visions, too. 
</P>
<P>
This is particularly true when changes are all about us. Much of the future of 
the Civic Center area is in a state of flux even as the plan is proclaimed. 
What is in this plan is a one-person description, in detail, of what will be 
permitted in Pasadena's future. And what of the major costs that will be 
required to bring it to pass? 
</P>
<P>
We sincerely hope that wisdom and caution will prevail over impetuous 
self-service in concluding this study.

RESOURCES FEED SEARCH FOR THE PAST; 
</P>
<P>
GENEALOGY: LOOKING UP ONE'S PAST RELATIONS CAN BE TRICKY, ESPECIALLY WITH NAME 
CHANGES IN THE JEWISH EXPERIENCE. BUT TWO SLEUTHS WILL TEACH OTHERS ABOUT 
RESOURCES.

<P>
Herb Mautner and Geraldine Winerman search for clues the way the best 
detectives do. They ask a lot of questions, consider at length even the most 
remote possibilities and never give up. As genealogists, what they want to 
discover is anything about their families' pasts. 
</P>
<P>
Mautner, 66, a retired industrial engineer, has spent thousands of hours over 
the past 16 years tracking down about 2,000 of his ancestors from the last 10 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
Winerman, 49, has made less progress -- she has been researching her roots only 
since 1983. But, she says, "I've been bitten by a genealogy bug that won't let 
go. 
</P>
<P>
"My mind is whirling on a constant basis. I'm constantly thinking, 'What can I 
do to find this tidbit of information?' " 
</P>
<P>
Mautner and Winerman have started to research their spouses' relatives. "I 
think it's terrific. It's the first time she's been really interested in 
something," said Winerman's husband, Gerald, an administrative law judge. 
</P>
<P>
Mautner's wife of 41 years, Maryanne, is equally enthusiastic. So far, Mautner 
has uncovered the genealogy of Maryanne Mautner's four grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
Mautner and Winerman met by chance through the Los Angeles Jewish Genealogical 
Society. They began teaching a class on Jewish genealogy in the spring of 1988 
at Valley Cities Jewish Community Center in Van Nuys and will be conducting 
another session in early November. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the 12-hour course, presented over five sessions, is to inform 
students of the resources available to help them discover their family 
heritage. Students are also taught how to effectively use these resources. 
</P>
<P>
Many people assume that Jewish genealogy is impossible because many of the 
records have been destroyed, but Winerman says it's just a matter of knowing 
where to look. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most outstanding centers for this type of research is the Los 
Angeles Family History Library in West Los Angeles, which is owned and operated 
by the Mormon Church. 
</P>
<P>
With more than 65,000 reels of microfilm, 30,000 sheets of microfiche and 
12,000 books, the library is the second-largest of its kind in the country. 
(The largest genealogy library, also owned by the Mormons, is in Salt Lake 
City.) 
</P>
<P>
Because of the Mormons' strong belief in keeping the family together, they have 
traditionally tried to preserve genealogical records and assist others in 
learning about their family heritage. 
</P>
<P>
The library in West Los Angeles has seen a 35% to 50% increase in the number of 
people using its facilities over the past two years, said librarian Dora Holt. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this increased interest in genealogy, the library extended its hours 
about a year and a half ago. In addition, Holt added, to accommodate the large 
volume of visitors, the library no longer closes for two weeks in August and 
December, as it used to do. 
</P>
<P>
Holt said a recent issue of Reader's Digest stated that genealogy has replaced 
stamp collecting as the No. 1 hobby in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Writing personal histories, which can be passed down from one generation to 
another, has also become popular, and many of the people who visit the Family 
History Library are involved in compiling such documents. When asked why they 
search for their roots, many enthusiasts say they got hooked after talking with 
someone who was already involved in genealogy. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Family History Library acquired documents confiscated by the 
U.S. government in 1928 from Russian consulates in seven U.S. cities. The 
records cover 1870 to 1914 and include valuable information about Russian Jews 
who contacted the consulates during that period. The consular documents were 
transferred to about 145 reels of microfilm in 1986, Holt said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the various reference texts and documents the library houses, 
Mautner and Winerman present a special four-hour session there as part of their 
course. They also make use of a variety of published resources, including the 
Jewish Family Finder, a New Jersey computer listing composed of about 1,150 
genealogists, 7,200 surnames and 4,000 towns. Such publications provide a way 
for those studying genealogy to link up with others across the country who 
share their interest. 
</P>
<P>
When the Los Angeles Jewish Genealogical Society was established in 1979, there 
was only one other organization of its kind, in New York City. Since then, 35 
other Jewish genealogy societies have sprung up, including ones in Holland, 
France and Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
One of the major difficulties facing Jewish genealogists is that Jews 
frequently changed their names, especially during times of persecution. Jewish 
family names have only existed about 200 years, Mautner explained. Before then, 
the names were mainly Hebrew. 
</P>
<P>
But even if a person's ancestors changed their names, Mautner and Winerman have 
several suggestions for genealogists. 
</P>
<P>
First, they recommend asking lots of questions of the oldest relatives. With 
reference to the town a family came from, it's important to get not only the 
name of the town but also the specific location, because there were often 
several towns by the same name. 
</P>
<P>
Check official documents, such as the U.S. Census and birth, marriage and death 
certificates. Also, find out if there were rabbis in the family, because rabbis 
keep genealogical records, some as far back as 1,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
Once people start to gather facts about their families, they'll usually need to 
practice more than a bit of patience, the pair say. When Mautner was working, 
every day during lunch he would write one letter, as part of his search for his 
roots. One time, he contacted the Czechoslovakian Embassy and had to wait about 
2 1/2 years for a reply. After paying them $200, Mautner received a list of 40 
of his ancestors. In his opinion, the fee was well worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have a little luck," Mautner said. "But sometimes, you hit a dead 
area. Then you can go for hours, days and weeks and not find anything." 
</P>
<P>
Learning about one's family can be an eye-opening experience, too -- sometimes 
pleasant, sometimes not. "We all find skeletons in our closet," Winerman said. 
</P>
<P>
When she was investigating her family's past, Winerman learned through an old 
newspaper clipping about one relative who, as a young man, married a woman in 
her 60s. Subsequently, Winerman's relative gambled and lost all his wife's 
money on horses. "Eventually, he became a mailman and settled down," she said 
with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
However, she also learned of ancestors who were Sephardic Jews living in Spain 
in the 1600s. "These people could not openly practice their religion, so they 
had to do it secretly," Winerman said. "If they were caught, they would have 
been persecuted or even executed." 
</P>
<P>
She also learned that some relatives died in Nazi concentration camps. 
"Learning all of this made me feel much more connected with my Judaism. Finding 
out that my family remained Jewish, what they did despite all the persecutions, 
made me proud," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Genealogy seems to lead to stronger family ties. 
</P>
<P>
After taking Mautner and Winerman's class, Eileen Wasserman, 40, of West Los 
Angeles, began to contact relatives she hadn't seen in 20 or 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's brought me much closer to family members I hadn't been emotionally close 
to," Wasserman said. "It's added so much to my life." 
</P>
<P>
And for Dr. Hillel Lazarus, 53, of North Hollywood, the result was much the 
same. After writing an 800-page family history that included 1,100 photos, 
Lazarus planned a family reunion, which was held Memorial Day. The event 
attracted 130 guests, some of whom Lazarus had not seen in 30 years. "It made 
me feel great," Lazarus said. "It gave us all a sense of togetherness. It was a 
good way to expose the younger generations to the family."

HOUDINI LEGEND PERSISTS AT AGING ESTATE BUT FACTS ARE ELUSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SZYMANSKI, Szymanski is a West Hollywood-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even on hot sunny California days, it is cool and dark among the tree-shaded 
ruins. Crumbling staircases lead to dead ends choked with ivy. Devilish 
markings are scrawled on the walls of spider-infested caverns, and the faint 
scent of incense is in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Remnants of this house in the hills above Hollywood seem like the perfect 
haunting grounds for the world's most famous magician, Houdini. 
</P>
<P>
Even 63 years after his death, psychics hold seances at the ruins known as the 
Houdini Estate -- at midnight on Halloween, the day Houdini died -- because he 
vowed to perform his greatest escape and return from the dead if he could. 
</P>
<P>
Local legends persist of people seeing a dark-haired man in a black suit walk 
the grounds and disappear. Others claim to see a woman dressed in green -- a 
ghost called "The Green Virgin" -- walking through the archways of the gardens. 
Treasure hunters have scoured the terraces with metal detectors and pickaxes in 
search of a box of jewels rumored to be buried there. 
</P>
<P>
But there is some doubt that Harry Houdini ever lived in the house on the 
northeast corner of Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Lookout Mountain Avenue, and 
the question has been resurrected now that the property is for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The ruins' reclusive owner, Fania Pearson, 70, has shunned publicity about the 
house since she bought it in 1958 to build a girls school. The ornate 
Italian-style villa burned to the ground a year later, and after futile efforts 
to save it, she had parts of the house razed. 
</P>
<P>
"People said Houdini lived here, but it never mattered to me," Pearson said. 
"Visitors kept coming, and it got to be a real bother." 
</P>
<P>
Pearson said she herself spread the word that Houdini never lived there. She 
pointed curiosity seekers to a vacant lot up the hill and hired security guards 
to keep people from poking around her land. 
</P>
<P>
"Neighbors always said he lived there," Pearson said, but neighbors who would 
have known Houdini 70 years ago have long since died. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is little evidence that Houdini lived in the house, legends and 
believers abound. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants in the servants' quarters in the back told Pearson how Houdini's ghost 
wanders the grounds quietly. 
</P>
<P>
Sightings of the lady in green lingerie stopped years ago, but some say they 
still see the tall dark man with suit and bow tie. 
</P>
<P>
Another legend about the grounds involves the son of a large department store 
magnate accused of throwing his lover off the balcony of the house in an 
argument. The spirit of the victim is said to frequent the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a kid, I climbed around this place and heard it was haunted by 
Houdini -- it was just something everyone knew," said Rod Snyder, 42, who is 
now the real estate listing agent for the 3 1/2 acres for sale at $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent stroll through the labyrinth of stone bridges and pagodas, workers 
were cleaning up the three flights of stairs and empty waterfalls. In one cave, 
pentagrams and triangles were drawn on pillars in orange crayon. Deeper into 
the gardens, mounds of candles were melted over a broken stone bench. High up 
on the hill was a large wooden cross with half-burned candles and strands of 
beads. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like seances go on pretty regularly around here," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
The maze of walkways often lead to nowhere, or to cold stone meditation areas 
draped with poison oak. High brick walls and thick grottoes make it easy to get 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
Half a dozen tour guide books of Hollywood mention 2398 Laurel Canyon Blvd. as 
Houdini's house. The oldest of the books, "This Is Hollywood," was written by 
Kenneth Schessler, who lives in LaVerne. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard about the controversy, but I proved it by finding it in a directory of 
some sort," Schessler said. "I just can't remember where." 
</P>
<P>
Schessler insists that Houdini lived at the house in the early 1920s and 
refuses to change any reprintings of his Hollywood guide. Another Hollywood 
writer, Maurice Zolotow, in 1979 researched Houdini's life for a Los Angeles 
Magazine article. 
</P>
<P>
"Houdini resided in Hollywood for about two years, yet I've never been able to 
discover where he lived," Zolotow said. 
</P>
<P>
A Halloween television special two years ago in which William Shatner played 
host was filmed at the Houdini ruins. This year, "In Search of Haunted 
Hollywood," scrapped filming at the ruins because producer Neal Hitchens 
couldn't confirm that the magician lived there. 
</P>
<P>
"We found no sound evidence he ever lived there, so I'm skeptical," said 
Hitchens, who added that ghosts hampered his film crew at other Hollywood 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
The mystery for Merrill Lynch real estate agent Linda Snyder is why her "For 
Sale" sign keeps getting destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like someone doesn't want us to sell the property," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The hillside land can be divided into three large lots for homes, said Snyder, 
Rod's sister. 
</P>
<P>
A release by Merrill Lynch Realty calls it "the Harry Houdini Estate" and urges 
prospective buyers to "build your dream house on this magnificent estate and 
own a part of Hollywood's history." But they have just added a disclaimer. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't say it definitely was Houdini's, we say it is " 'known as,' " said 
Harry Polim, Merrill Lynch vice president in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The real estate company is extra cautious after threats of a lawsuit by Houdini 
historian and collector Manny Weltman of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
"Houdini never set foot on those grounds, and anyone who says so is lying," 
said Weltman, who is also a magician. "If anyone comes up with proof I'll eat 
my magic hat." 
</P>
<P>
Weltman said he spent 45 years studying Houdini's life and found nothing 
mentioning the Laurel Canyon house. Merrill Lynch hired two title search 
companies and found no records of the property before 1922. The owner and her 
lawyers have searched owner and tenant records decades ago without success. 
</P>
<P>
This Halloween, Magic Castle's resident medium Leo Kostka will attempt a 
Houdini seance at 1:30 p.m., the time at which the magician died of a ruptured 
appendix in Detroit on Oct. 31, 1926. Kosta's seance at the Magic Castle will 
be attended by magicians and historians, who will bring some of Houdini's 
personal items. 
</P>
<P>
This year's seance in Los Angeles is organized by Tom Boldt, who helped create 
a Houdini exhibit in his hometown of Appleton, Wis., where Houdini may have 
been born. Even though Appleton has a school, a statue, a plaza and a museum 
for Houdini, historians cannot be sure he was born there. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything about him is a mystery, from his birth until his death. So it 
doesn't surprise me that they don't know if he lived in that house," said 
Boldt, who has toured the ruins. "But I tell you, as much as I know about him, 
I think he would have liked a spooky place like that." 
</P>
<P>
But all the ghost stories, seances, and such mean little to Pearson. "All these 
people say they've seen ghosts, and I've seen nothing," she said. "I just want 
to sell the property and be done with it."

LEARNING-DISABLED STUDENTS TURN TO ART TO DESCRIBE EXPERIENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gigi Foller is trying to explain what it is like not to be able to count 
change. 
</P>
<P>
Stammering in frustration, the normally articulate 38-year-old moves first one 
way and then the other, gesturing with increasing futility and starting again 
and again before giving up with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
So she points to her painting, and the painting says it all. 
</P>
<P>
Titled "The Adventures of Jellowoman," the witty cartoon in four parts depicts 
a matronly supervisor casually asking Gigi to watch the cash register for a 
minute. Gigi -- depicted in the first panel as a mild-mannered librarian -- 
starts to dissolve, until in the last panel she is reduced to gelatin, her 
horn-rimmed glasses floating on the glutinous mass. 
</P>
<P>
Gigi is a student at Los Angeles Community College, and her painting is part of 
an exhibit of artwork by learning-disabled students at the school that is 
designed to explain their learning problems through art. The 10 artists whose 
work makes up the exhibit have constructed sculptures and paintings that use 
dark humor and harrowing images to depict what it is like to live with 
disabilities that many people do not believe exist. 
</P>
<P>
They are learning disabled, and they suffer from disorders as well-known as 
dyslexia, the reversal of words and letters, and as obscure as dysgraphia, the 
inability to write while thinking. They are all of average or above-average 
intelligence, but their brains have difficulty processing essential 
information. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all of the artists in the show are adults. They have failed at careers 
or have found niches in professions where their disabilities don't matter. For 
virtually every one, the exhibit is something of a coming out -- the first time 
they have gone public with what they describe as their private nemeses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for me to explain why I have a teaching credential I can't use, why 
I've been careening through my life losing at different careers," Foller said. 
"Up till now I haven't had a hope in hell of telling anyone about this. It's 
been absolute hell since I was 4 years old. So you can see why I sometimes feel 
like the Jellowoman." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit is titled "A Picture Is Worth a Thousand Words," and it opens 
Wednesday. It is the climax of an art therapy program that began in the spring 
when California community college officials gave the learning-disabilities 
program at LACC $4,500 to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Matrenga, director of the 10-year-old tutoring and counseling program at 
the Los Feliz-area college, said she and her colleagues came up with the idea 
after noticing that some of their clients took notes by drawing pictures. After 
discussing the phenomenon with art instructors at the school, they decided to 
collaborate with the art department to seek a grant for an art show. 
</P>
<P>
When they are not organizing art shows, the two learning disabilities 
specialists who run the LACC program spend hours with students designing ways 
for them to learn. They find tapes of books for people who read painfully 
slowly, buy screens and gels for people who have difficulty reading under 
bright light and stock a large selection of audio and visual aids for all the 
students who seek their help -- this year 120 in all. 
</P>
<P>
The program is one of a number of such learning centers dotted throughout the 
California community college system. Two years ago the system became the first 
in the country to adopt criteria for determining which students are 
learning-disabled. Beginning next fall, community colleges in California will 
ask them to identify themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The show will continue for a month. Matrenga also will hold a workshop in which 
learning-disabled students will explain their work to faculty and staff. 
</P>
<P>
If the experiences reflected in the show are typical, few teachers understand 
the students' difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
There is, for instance, the dilemma of Marianne Skalicky, 32, who suffers from 
an attention deficit disorder, a neurological problem that makes it difficult 
for her to focus on one thing at a time, and from scotopic sensitivity, an 
acute sensitivity to bright light. She said she has been unable to explain to 
teachers for years why she reads best in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
There is Kippen Melville, an actress who said she was so embarrassed about her 
disabilities that for years she didn't feel she had "the right to step on a 
college campus." 
</P>
<P>
And there is Richard Littlefield, a dyslexic who finds reading so painful that 
the painting he is exhibiting depicts a small Richard overwhelmed by a 
monster-size book. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in front of the mural-size work on a recent day, Littlefield read 
aloud a poem within the painting: 
</P>
<P>
 repeating nightmare child 
</P>
<P>
 A small me 
</P>
<P>
 overwhelmed in crushing 
</P>
<P>
 hurting, paranoid emotional devastation. 
</P>
<P>
 A small me 
</P>
<P>
 crying in anxiety 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in a monster 
</P>
<P>
 large book 
</P>
<P>
 knowing I can't get through to the end 
</P>
<P>
 crying in confused pain 
</P>
<P>
 a small me. 
</P>
<P>
 mommy daddy 
</P>
<P>
 save me 
</P>
<P>
"There's a great, big glitch in my computer program," Littlefield said. "I knew 
in my nightmares and in my daytime life that I just couldn't get through this 
great, big, huge book." 
</P>
<P>
The work being set up at LACC's DaVinci Hall Art Gallery draws the stares of 
passers-by. There is a sculpture of black tears, a painting of a woman moving 
her head left and right in a swirl of colors and a mixed-media work of a baby's 
head surrounded by a blur of indistinguishable words. 
</P>
<P>
As the exhibit takes form, however, the students talk not about the pain but 
what they have overcome. There is an intense closeness among students and 
therapist, which those in the program say has to do with gratitude and relief. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to start crying sometimes, crying in the anxiety of being sort of 
locked up within myself," Skalicky said. "But once you know what it is, it's 
like the whole world really opens up to you."

NO NEED TO LOOK FAR TO SCARE UP SOME TALES ABOUT HAUNTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
They're back. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the canyons, houses and museums. And in the minds of true believers in 
the supernatural. 
</P>
<P>
Halloween makes its annual visit next week, with young, make-believe Jasons and 
Freddys ready again to stalk the streets. Meanwhile, some people believe the 
ghosts of another time and place stalk their own hideaways. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is possible," said Richard Senate, who has written a book about 
haunted places in California and lectures at area colleges about his research. 
"Anyone who doesn't believe is closing their eyes to a reality. So many people 
have seen them that they can't all be crazy. Ghosts have been seen by people 
all over the world for thousands of years. Who are they? We still don't know, 
but they are very legitimate to study." 
</P>
<P>
Like rumors, ghost stories can't always be easily traced to an original source, 
and they sustain a life of their own long after they first emerge. Sometimes 
they are passed on by old-timers who heard the stories from the previous 
generation's old-timers. And sometimes the stories are chronicled in written 
documents, permanent testimony for future residents. 
</P>
<P>
"I was open before to the possibility of ghosts, and now I'm a definite 
believer," Dan Hobbit, a documentary film maker, said after claiming to witness 
an apparition at a San Fernando Valley hospital. "And I know many people who 
have seen ghosts in their homes throughout the Valley. For obvious reasons, 
they don't want to make public where they live. They just want to get rid of 
the ghosts." 
</P>
<P>
What follows are some of the ghost stories that have circulated through the 
Valley and surrounding areas for years, sometimes decades. 
</P>
<P>
* The Stagecoach Inn Museum in Newbury Park: According to psychics, the ghost 
of Pierre Devon, a guest murdered by an unknown assailant at the inn in 1885, 
has stayed around to make periodic appearances over the last century. 
</P>
<P>
The ghost was first identified as Pierre by psychic Sybil Leek in 1966, who 
came to the inn after employees claimed they saw a ghost. Earlier, in 1964, 
Beth Needham, 60, of Thousand Oaks visited the inn. By this time, the 
Stagecoach served as a gift shop, no longer a hotel. Needham was browsing when 
Judith McIntyre, the shop's longtime manager, introduced her to a "friend." 
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'Come here, I want you to meet a friendly ghost,' " Needham said. 
"And then she introduced me to Mad Alice. I don't know why she called her Mad 
Alice." 
</P>
<P>
Needham said that according to McIntyre, Mad Alice (who later was known as 
Pierre) would take huge bites out of the oak railing of the inn's long 
staircase. The railing, otherwise sturdy and in perfect condition at the time, 
had areas with large chunks missing. 
</P>
<P>
Needham said she didn't feel or see anything at the time, but two years later, 
when she became an inn guide, she was standing by the staircase when "I felt a 
draft. I knew it wasn't a draft." She said she felt chosen by the ghost because 
of her introduction to the ghost two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
In 1965, the inn was moved 1 1/2 miles from its original site to allow for 
extension of the Ventura Freeway. The ghost reportedly made the move with the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
According to "Resident Ghost of the Stagecoach Inn Museum," a written account 
of the apparition, when several workers took a break for a bite to eat, two 
2-by-4s came flying out of the second-story parlor window. A quick check of the 
premises didn't reveal anything or anyone to explain the accident. The workers 
didn't wait around. 
</P>
<P>
"They took a shot of something to drink and left," Needham said. "They thought 
the place was spooked. There was nobody else around but them." 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, a fire, caused by faulty electrical wiring, destroyed the inn. The 
presence of the ghost -- now being called Pierre -- was never cited as a 
possible cause. After a fund-raising campaign by the historical society, the 
rebuilt inn reopened in 1976. Pierre was again a tenant, according to psychic 
Grace Coveney, 63, of Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw Pierre," said Coveney, who visited the inn in 1987, making certain that 
she wasn't too familiar with its history beforehand. Using her psychic 
abilities, she said, she immediately sensed an apparition, whom she also 
identified as Pierre. "He went to a certain room and went behind the door, but 
he was there." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, historian Pat Allen searched the records of 1880 to 1890, but 
failed to produce any written account of a Pierre Devon ever having lived in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
But California did not require death records during that period, Allen pointed 
out. 
</P>
<P>
* A hospital in the San Fernando Valley: Dan Hobbit, 37, a film maker who is 
producing United Cable Television's "Psychic Connections," a discussion of the 
paranormal, claims to have filmed an apparition in March. Hobbit won't identify 
the hospital, saying he was threatened with a lawsuit by a hospital official if 
he ever released its location. The official, Hobbit said, told him to "leave 
our demons alone.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hobbit, says a friend being treated for a foot infection at the hospital 
observed various unnatural happenings: nurses' clipboards flying out of 
baskets, lights flickering on and off, sounds of people crying in empty rooms. 
Hobbit's friend asked him to bring his video camera to record the strange 
events. And so he did. 
</P>
<P>
For several nights, Hobbit filmed a dark examination room and, when he viewed 
the tape, saw a transparent ball of light that floated across and off the 
screen. One morning, he brought the camera back to the hospital, placed it on a 
tripod and let it run for two hours while he ate lunch in another room. He came 
back and immediately watched the tape in another part of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
On the tape, Hobbit saw the same ball of light "materialize into a very slender 
man in his 40s. He looked like he had an examination coat on," and he kept 
getting up to actually turn the camera on and off. "I couldn't believe what I 
was seeing." 
</P>
<P>
Hobbit said a hospital official who viewed the tape told him that the 
unidentified man looked like a former patient, who had died of cancer three 
years ago. Hobbit added that the same official told him about the presence of a 
former female patient who periodically reassures the terminally ill that 
"things aren't so bad on the other side." 
</P>
<P>
Soon afterward, on Hobbit's urging, Nonie Fagatt, a psychic in Beverly Hills, 
visited the hospital and said she sensed the presence of a ghost. 
</P>
<P>
"In my mind, I felt a man in his wheelchair," Fagatt said. "That hospital is 
quite an infested place. You'd have to resort to some type of exorcism to get 
rid of the ghosts." 
</P>
<P>
For now, Hobbit plans no immediate return to the hospital. He said he has sent 
his video to the Psychic Research Institute in England and has shown it to 
other prominent psychics. He may use the hospital tape on "Psychic Connections" 
when it airs later this fall. 
</P>
<P>
* Andreas Pico Adobe in Mission Hills: Because of neglect, the adobe was in 
ruins until it was restored in 1930 by Mark Harrington, an anthropologist who 
bought the property. According to Elva Meline, the adobe's curator since 1976, 
every night when Harrington would go to bed, he'd hear heels clicking across 
the tile floor and up the staircase. 
</P>
<P>
Meline said Harrington told her the story soon before he died in 1970. She said 
he would wait until the sounds got closer to his upstairs bedroom, then sneak 
out of bed hoping to catch the ghost. Each time, he saw nothing. He lived in 
the adobe until 1945 and said he heard the sounds frequently. 
</P>
<P>
The ghost, according to Harrington's account, is Catarina Pico, who lived in 
the adobe from 1874 to 1895. At 14, Catarina married Romulo Pico and helped 
modernize the adobe. Meline said she doesn't know why Catarina would stick 
around, "other than the fact that this was her home for so long." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Meline said, there have been few sightings, or senses, of 
Catarina's presence, although something strange happened just three weeks ago 
when two women toured the adobe. 
</P>
<P>
"These two women both remarked that they felt a very strong presence in the 
adobe," Meline said. "One said she felt it on the patio, the other the living 
room. They both said it was a very peaceful feeling, which is what people have 
said about Catarina in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Meline said she hasn't encountered Catarina. "I'm so busy running this place 
that perhaps I haven't been open to the possibility of it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
* Plumb Canyon in Saugus: Herman, 73, a longtime resident of the area who asked 
that his last name not be used, said he was hunting for cottontail rabbits one 
day in 1938 or 1939 when he spotted something unusual in the canyon between 
Bouquet and Mint canyons. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw this Spanish-looking woman by the path," he said. "She had some kind of 
strange hairdo and had something in her hand. She wore a light satin dress and 
a blue shawl. I don't know why I saw it." 
</P>
<P>
At first, Herman said, he thought it was one of the Cortez girls, members of a 
family that inhabited that part of the canyon. But he knew the family and soon 
realized that it wasn't one of them. Herman was about 23 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I wasn't drunk and hadn't been drinking," Herman said. "and I don't 
want people to think I'm nuts, but I know what I saw. If I had only seen it 
myself, I would've thought it was my imagination, but people for years have 
claimed to see the Spanish woman." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Reynolds, curator of the Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society, 
couldn't give actual figures, but said there have been frequent sightings of 
the Spanish woman since the mid-19th Century. As recently as last year, 
Reynolds said, he heard that a resident spotted the woman floating along the 
path from the east side of the canyon to the west. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to be more of a summer phenomenon," Reynolds said. "We've done 
research to see if there was some kind of murder or other tragedy that took 
place there, but we haven't found anything. We do know there were a lot of 
Spanish settlers in the area in the early 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
"People here say their grandparents saw her in the 1860s. We don't who she is 
or why she is still around."

CEMETERY OF STARS NOT ENTIRELY A GRAVE MATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actress Marion Davies, mistress of William Randolph Hearst, has been dead for 
almost 30 years, but someone remembers. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, a fan left a red rose on her mausoleum in Hollywood Memorial 
Park. "Dear Marion, you are still loved and missed," read the accompanying 
note. 
</P>
<P>
"Practically all of Hollywood's history can be revisited here," said Frank 
Cooper during a preview of the upcoming Halloween tour of the cemetery 
sponsored by the Art Deco Society of Los Angeles. This year Cooper, who began 
the tours five years ago, and his colleagues will take groups through the 
cemetery on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
As Cooper walked the 57-acre grounds, he pointed out the graves of Hollywood 
founder Harvey Wilcox and other city fathers and of dozens of celebrities, from 
swashbuckler Douglas Fairbanks Sr. to director John Huston. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, whose day job is with a firm that mails press releases, is master of 
the odd Hollywood cemetery fact. 
</P>
<P>
He explains, for instance, that Davies' handsome white mausoleum, with its 
stone cherubs, was not a macabre gift from Hearst to his pretty protegee. 
Davies had the tomb, which has room for 12, built for her family. 
</P>
<P>
As an anthropology student at USC, Cooper wrote a thesis on death and culture 
that took him to most of the area's memorial parks. The Hollywood cemetery, an 
eclectic jumble of 73,000 graves, crypts, mausoleums and cenotaphs, is his 
all-time favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"Forest Lawn," he opined, "looks like a golf course. It has no character." But 
Hollywood Memorial Park, with its miniature Egyptian temples, stained-glass 
windows and tombstones shaped like rocket ships, is fraught with character, he 
said. Like the streets of Hollywood, the cemetery tolerates dozens of different 
styles. "There's room for personalization," the cemetery aficionado said. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper insists there is nothing strange about liking cemeteries. "We're not 
concerned with what's beneath the ground. We're concerned with lawn level and 
above. It's not morbid. It's quite beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
It's also a cheap date, noted Cooper, who sometimes visits the cemetery with 
girlfriend Suzanne Tarbell. 
</P>
<P>
Established in 1899, the cemetery is best known for its film-industry burials. 
Producer-director Cecil B. De Mille is lavishly entombed, purportedly with his 
feet pointing toward Paramount. Rudolph Valentino's marker in the Hollywood 
Cathedral Mausoleum almost always bears the lipstick imprint of a kiss. Jayne 
Mansfield, who was decapitated in a car accident in 1967, is buried in 
Pennsylvania, but her bereaved fan club bought her a memorial plaque in 
Hollywood cemetery. On it is a publicity shot of the blonde star and the 
inscription: "We live to love you more each day." 
</P>
<P>
As Cooper pointed out, dead moguls and stars are the cemetery's major draw, but 
many of the most interesting graves have nothing to do with the famous. 
</P>
<P>
In several Armenian areas of the cemetery, graves are marked with headstones 
decorated with photo-like portraits of the dead sandblasted on polished 
granite. One of the deceased is shown as a young man, wearing a rakishly angled 
hat. Little gardens, planted with mint and other herbs as well as flowers, 
flourish on some plots, many of which are edged with brick borders. The grave 
of a beloved toddler is decorated with his toy cars and other playthings. Some 
graves are topped with Eastern Rite crosses fashioned out of plastic pipe. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said Valentino's place of interment is the one every visitor wants to 
see.

SPEAKING OUT: WHO WILL PAY FOR A BETTER CITY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN J. TUITE, Tuite is administrator of the Community Redevelopment Agency 
of the City of Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's an easy piece of logic. 
</P>
<P>
A developer constructs a building downtown. The space is rented, business is 
expanded, more jobs are created, the region's wealth is increased. Furthermore, 
the city's role is enhanced, its tax base broadened, and the developer, broker 
and investment partners are enriched. 
</P>
<P>
Sounds simple, doesn't it? It seems that everyone wins. But the consequent 
growth makes the morning and evening rush hours more congested and increases 
the demand for city services. 
</P>
<P>
New development also crowds the agenda, sometimes overshadowing our need to 
preserve our old buildings, the treasures of the past. The new development 
leaves less room for parks, walking spaces, fountains and sky. 
</P>
<P>
Who's going to preserve and recycle those historic buildings? Who's going to 
pay for more traffic cops, street lights and public transportation? Who's going 
to clean the air we breathe, house the new downtown workers, provide expanded 
police and fire protection, schools, child care, cultural facilities and parks? 
</P>
<P>
And who will prime the pump for greater economic prosperity by building new 
public facilities such as the larger and more competitive Convention Center? 
</P>
<P>
In other words, who's going to pay to make Los Angeles not just a big city but 
a great city? After all, it's the amenities and support systems surrounding 
commercial development that give the city the flavor and quality of living that 
we're all looking for. 
</P>
<P>
The far-sighted developer understands that the value of his property is 
enhanced by the richness of the neighborhood in which he builds. He recognizes 
his responsibility to be a primary contributor to community amenities. 
</P>
<P>
The short-sighted critic claims that someone should pay to build a great city 
to leave to our descendants, hoping the bill will be theirs, not his. 
</P>
<P>
Will developers, who reap the benefits of growth, help pay for that legacy or 
merely pass it on to their clients and the taxpayers? 
</P>
<P>
These are the issues that were skirted in the "Speaking Out" column of Oct. 15. 
("CRA's Fee Bodes Ill for Healthy Downtown," written by commercial real estate 
broker John C. Cushman III). 
</P>
<P>
In the article, the writer bemoaned the fact that phenomenal growth has spawned 
serious urban problems that threaten the continued prosperity of downtown and 
the region. Nothing new there. We're grappling with these problems every day. 
He chose not to offer any constructive solutions, but merely to flail once 
again at the bureaucratic process. 
</P>
<P>
Redevelopment has been successful in this city. A robust financial center has 
bloomed and the assessed property valuation in Los Angeles' Central Business 
District has tripled within the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
The developer of 10 years ago took a risk for a lower price. Today's developer 
may be paying full market value but his investment is more of a sure thing. 
</P>
<P>
But redevelopment doesn't stop at the edge of a visibly successful commercial 
core. 
</P>
<P>
A larger, more complex central city presents an agenda that cries out for 
action. Homeless families with no place to go live on the streets of Skid Row. 
Some 6,000 dilapidated housing units must be upgraded. An estimated 6 million 
square feet of vacant or under-used commercial space in historic buildings goes 
begging for tenants. 
</P>
<P>
A viable 24-hour residential community in South Park must be nurtured in order 
for it to take root and eventually provide 15,000 to 20,000 units for downtown 
dwellers of all economic levels. 
</P>
<P>
These are some of the issues in Los Angeles that developer fees help us to 
address. 
</P>
<P>
Pending before the City Council is a proposal prepared by the Community 
Redevelopment Agency in response to the council. (Effective June, 1988, a city 
ordinance required the CRA to develop a uniform procedure for regulating 
density transfers and providing for public benefit contributions.) The proposal 
is designed to provide for public benefits without choking new development and 
to give order to a previously chaotic and arbitrary system of density 
transfers. 
</P>
<P>
There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding about this proposal. It is nothing 
new for a large project to contribute significant public benefits. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the massive assembling of development rights to allow the 
construction of Library Square, which consists of the 73-story First Interstate 
World Center and the Southern California Gas Center, is generating upward of 
$50 million for the rehabilitation and expansion of the Central Library, 
restoration of the west lawn and construction of the Bunker Hill Steps. 
California Plaza provided for the Museum of Contemporary Art and for the future 
Bella Lewitzky Dance Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
The landmark Bradbury Building at 3rd Street and Broadway was saved from 
demolition by the agency's approving the use of its unused development rights 
to raise funds for the cost of seismic upgrading. The Home Savings Tower at 7th 
and Figueroa will include a major portal into the Metro Rail and Light Rail 
station beneath the building. Citicorp Plaza made Seventh Market Place 
possible, which, in turn, kept two department stores from abandoning downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, essentially a procedure to implement a city ordinance to regulate 
TFAR, an acronym for transferable floor area ratio otherwise known as 
development or density rights, could become one of the most important pieces of 
city legislation in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure is quite simple. It's based on the proposition that if the city 
grants additional building rights to a developer that will enhance the value of 
his land, then the city can rightfully ask the developer to pay a fee to help 
offset the impact of the additional development. 
</P>
<P>
The new proposal, which will get full discussion before the City Council in the 
months to come, follows a common real estate practice in cities all over the 
United States today. 
</P>
<P>
In downtown Los Angeles, zoning regulations allow six square feet of building 
for every square foot of land on a site. A 100,000-square-foot site gives 
property owners the right to a 600,000-square-foot building. Developers who 
want to build a 1 million-square-foot building must ask the city to transfer 
additional unused development rights from another site. This action is called a 
density transfer. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure under consideration by the City Council states that everyone who 
is awarded additional development rights, or density transfers, should pay a 
public benefit fee. This fee can be used by the city to satisfy the needs 
brought about by the development itself, such as extra open space, housing and 
child care. 
</P>
<P>
A public task force made up of developers, appraisers and real estate attorneys 
worked for over a year to design a procedure that supports both the efforts of 
the developer and the interests of the community. The Central City Assn., a 
civic-minded coalition of private downtown interests, helped shape a proposal 
that is sane, equitable and necessary to combat the problems that threaten the 
future of our city. 
</P>
<P>
The CRA estimates that the city will garner upward of $209 million over the 
next 20 years in public benefit payments resulting from density transfers. And 
where will the money go? To support housing for families and individuals of all 
income levels who work and live in downtown. To beautify the streets and make 
them more secure. To build much needed open space? To save our stock of fine 
historic buildings. To provide child care facilities for today's working 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, public benefit payments will help create an environment that 
contributes to the financial health of a development. A project that enhances 
the community reaps the rewards of good corporate citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
With the year 2000 just a decade away, city leaders pondering the future of Los 
Angeles are trying to achieve a union between the city's continued growth and a 
modern, efficient and balanced urban environment that provides an improved 
quality of life for all of its citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than listening to a misplaced solo that may be out of tune, a full 
representation of a vast choir of diversity must be heard. All of our efforts 
must go forward in full partnership if we are to secure the future. 
</P>
<P>
The problems have received anxious attention. The solutions demand our 
thoughtful discussion.

SAM HALL KAPLAN: CLIFF MAY: DESIGNER OF DREAM HOUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM HALL KAPLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California has had more than its share of architects and designers who 
have won worldwide attention -- Charles and Henry Greene for their exquisite 
bungalows, R. M. Schindler and Richard Neutra for their modernist renditions, 
John Lautner for his singular visions, and, most recently, Frank Gehry for his 
constructivist exercises. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in a class by himself outside the design establishment, is Cliff May, a 
self-taught architect who was one of the most productive and successful 
designer of houses here or anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
May died 10 days ago at his office in Brentwood at the age of 81, generally 
ignored by the profession's pedants, respected by the building trade, hailed by 
his clients and loved by his friends. 
</P>
<P>
Arguably, no other home designer who has ever practiced in Southern California 
was more sensitive to the region's unique climate, evolving life styles and 
rich architectural history than Cliff May. 
</P>
<P>
It was May more than any other architect who developed and perfected the style 
known as the California ranch house, which blossomed in the 1950s to become the 
quintessential suburban home. 
</P>
<P>
The style was distinguished by its single-story profile, accented by 
low-pitched roofs and informal, free-flowing living spaces oriented through 
sliding glass doors to the adjoining terraces and gardens. 
</P>
<P>
In a career that spanned 57 years, May designed about 1,000 custom homes and 
produced plans that were used in the development of an estimated 18,000 other 
houses and numerous subdivisions across the United States and in other 
countries. In addition, his plans and concepts have been freely adapted with 
some license around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Cliff, as everyone who knew him called him, was an unpretentious original who 
never went to architecture school -- indeed he eschewed it -- and never 
bothered to become a licensed architect until a year ago. The result was that 
May never became a member of the American Institute of Architects, and 
therefore was not eligible for a host of the professions's awards and 
accompanying publicity. 
</P>
<P>
A sixth generation Californian, Cliff was fiercely proud of a heritage that 
included a great grandfather, Jose Maria Estudillo, who was the last mayor of 
San Diego under Mexican rule. There also was in Cliff a streak of Yankee, which 
he applied to the rendition of the courtyard ranchero he grew up in to fashion 
the California ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted the houses to be attractive and somehow express and serve the 
California life style of informality and outdoor living -- that is my Southwest 
heritage -- while, of course, also being penny-wise and affordable -- that is 
my Yankee heritage," he once told me. 
</P>
<P>
The result was a series of innovations, beginning in 1931 with his first houses 
he designed and built. These included focusing the living room toward the back 
yard and a patio rather to the front, and siting the garage as close to the 
street as possible, freeing the rear for play space and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
"Houses should be designed primarily not the way they will look from the 
street, but rather with their practical use in mind," Cliff said once while 
reviewing a set of plans with me. 
</P>
<P>
"Houses should be designed so people can live in them the way they want to, not 
they way the architect wants them to," he added. "Everything else follows from 
that." 
</P>
<P>
What Cliff said he liked to think he was designing was each client's dream 
house, and he was, be it a 1,000-square-foot construction for $10,000, as they 
were in the 1930s, or 5,000 square feet and up for $500,000 and up in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, popular magazines such as Sunset and the former House and Garden often 
referred to a Cliff May design it featured as a California Dream House. 
</P>
<P>
It was an appropriate label, for Cliff captured in his designs the spirit of 
his time and place, in particular the buoyant late 1940s, the 1950s and early 
1960s, when Southern California, with its benign weather, lush landscape and 
youthful optimism, embodied the dream of a better life. 
</P>
<P>
Cliff gave form to that dream with casual, comfortable, affordable houses that 
embraced the landscape. He also designed some luxurious houses for a 
well-heeled clientele, here and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Cliff would note with sadness on how the dream of the better 
life that lent Southern California its unique character was being eroded in a 
smog-laden haze of insensitive, avaricious development. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't they realize how special Los Angeles is?" he would say. 
</P>
<P>
Yet to the end Cliff expressed the belief that if only architects and builders 
would think more about the people they were serving instead of profits and 
publicity the dream would persist. 
</P>
<P>
"In the end it's the people that count, not the buildings," he said to me a few 
months ago at a community gathering. 
</P>
<P>
With the death of Cliff May, I fear, the California dream slips further from 
our grasp. 
</P>
<P>
In honor of his memory, friends and family suggest contributions be made to the 
Los Angeles Conservancy to fund an annual Cliff May lecture series on the 
region's architectural history.

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: CASUALTY LOSS MUST BE 'SUDDEN OR UNEXPECTED' TO BE 
TAX-DEDUCTIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS, Robert J. Bruss is a San Francisco-area lawyer, author and 
real estate broker. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: The soil underneath our home is gradually sinking. We have learned 
that our house was built on top of an old garbage dump that was closed in the 
mid-1950s, filled and converted into a subdivision for about 150 homes. 
</P>
<P>
Some owners have jacked up their homes to make them level, but our house is 
built on a slab foundation, so leveling it will cost at least $30,000. If we 
decide to go ahead, can we deduct this major expense as a casualty loss on our 
income tax returns? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: You are asking a very difficult question to which there is no right or 
wrong answer. To be able to deduct a casualty loss on your income tax return, 
the loss must be "sudden, unexpected or unusual." 
</P>
<P>
The IRS could argue your loss is caused by the gradual subsidence of the land 
underneath your house, so it does not qualify. However, if the land suddenly 
sank under one portion of your home, then it could qualify for the casualty 
loss tax deduction. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest that you consult your tax adviser. He or she will also explain that a 
casualty loss deduction is allowed only to the extent it exceeds 10% of your 
adjusted gross income. For example, if you and your spouse have a $50,000 
adjusted gross income, the first $5,000 of a casualty loss would not be 
deductible. 
</P>
<P>
You should also be aware the IRS loves to audit casualty losses because 
taxpayers often cannot prove these deductions. However, if you and your tax 
adviser conclude your problem does not qualify as a casualty loss, your expense 
is then a capital improvement, which can be added to your adjusted cost basis 
for your home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Should Commission Be Split With Lawyer? 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am a real estate broker. Recently, I met the owner of a large apartment 
complex who listed his building for sale with my firm. I called a few of my 
business contacts and located a buyer within about a week. When I brought the 
full-price offer to the seller, he insisted his attorney review it. 
</P>
<P>
But the attorney says he wants half my sales commission if he is to recommend 
his client accept the offer. I asked the attorney if he is a licensed realty 
broker and he replied that attorneys do not have to be licensed as brokers. I 
said I would think about the situation. As the sales commission is almost 
$140,000, do you think I should split it with this crooked attorney? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Attorneys are exempt from real estate license laws but they are not 
permitted to share in real estate sales commissions without a real estate 
license. I suggest your correct reply should be: "The real estate license law 
does not permit me to split my sales commission with an unlicensed person. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure you don't want me to lose my license. If you insist on receiving part 
of my sales commission, then I must report your illegal demand to your client 
and to the state Bar Assn." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sell Your Home Before You Buy a New One 
</P>
<P>
Q: I know we made a bad mistake but hope you can get us out of our mess. We 
committed ourselves to buy a new house before selling our old one. Since our 
purchase offer had a contingency for the sale of our old home, we thought we 
were safe. 
</P>
<P>
But then another buyer made an offer to purchase the house we want to buy, and 
the seller insisted we either remove our contingency or give up the house. So 
we waived the contingency. That was two months ago and we haven't had any 
offers for the sale of our current home. What should we do? 
</P>
<P>
A: Your situation is a classic example of why prospective home buyers should 
sell their old home before buying a new residence. 
</P>
<P>
One solution is to forfeit your earnest money deposit on the new home if there 
would be no further liability. That might be your cheapest solution. 
</P>
<P>
But another choice is to obtain a "bridge loan" on your old home so you will 
have the cash to buy your new home. But this can be an expensive choice. The 
interest rate on bridge loans isn't low. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sometimes It's Better to Rent Than Own 
</P>
<P>
Q: Recently I attended a real estate investment seminar where the speaker, who 
seemed very knowledgeable, said it is cheaper and smarter to rent your home 
than to own it. My wife and I pay about $1,200 per month for the mortgage 
payment and property taxes on our home. But we could rent a similar house down 
the block for $950 per month. Do you think we should sell our home and rent 
instead? 
</P>
<P>
A: No, no, no. The seminar speaker you heard is absolutely correct in telling 
you that it is cheaper and smarter to rent your home than to own it. However, 
most folks don't like the idea because they want to own the home where they 
live. 
</P>
<P>
The solution is to rent the residence in which you live and own an equivalent 
rental house. For example, you could rent that house down the street for $950 
while you rent your present home for $950 to tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, you will have a negative cash flow of about $250, plus maintenance and 
insurance. However, you will be able to depreciate your former residence, thus 
resulting in a tax loss. If your adjusted gross income is less than $100,000, 
you can deduct up to $25,000 of such a loss against your ordinary income, such 
as job salary, interest and dividends. 
</P>
<P>
I must admit although it makes sense to rent a residence instead of owning it, 
I don't do that. There is something about the security of owning your home that 
can't be compensated no matter how great the tax benefits. Before you move out 
of your home and rent one down the street, please consult your tax adviser for 
full details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Realtor Defends Need for 6-Month Listing 
</P>
<P>
Q: As a realtor for the past 12 years, I find your column must reading. In 
fact, we often start out our Monday morning sales meetings by discussing your 
articles. We don't always agree, but you certainly provoke a lively discussion 
among our sales associates. However, one thing we strongly disagree about is 
the term of the listing. 
</P>
<P>
I realize you hear from the unhappy home sellers who signed six-month listings 
and their agent did a poor job. I have no apology for those agents. But most 
realty agents need 90 days to sell a home in a typical market. By the time we 
get the listing into the local multiple listing service, begin our advertising 
program, and work with interested buyers, it takes at least 30 days. If the 
local market is slow, as it is in many cities today, homes don't sell 
instantly. Isn't it about time you rethink your ideas about the listing term? 
</P>
<P>
A: Thank you for sharing what Paul Harvey would call "the rest of the story." 
The big drawback of a 90-day listing is most realty agents work hardest, 
smartest and fastest just before a listing expires. As a real estate salesman 
for several years, I know how that works. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, I have received many letters from home sellers who signed 
long-term listings, only to discover their agent is not doing everything 
possible to professionally market the home. 
</P>
<P>
For example, perhaps you recall the recent letter from the home sellers who 
learned that their agent didn't promptly submit their listing to the multiple 
listing service for 30 days. That wouldn't have happened with a 30-day listing. 
</P>
<P>
For this reason, I recommend home sellers sign a 30- or 60-day listing with the 
understanding that the listing will be renewed if the agent is doing a good job 
when the listing expires with the home unsold. This strategy prevents the home 
seller from getting stuck with a lazy agent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Move Back Into Rental to Avoid Paying Tax 
</P>
<P>
Q: About three years ago we moved to a new town about 75 miles from our former 
home. Since we weren't sure about our new jobs, we rented our old residence to 
tenants. Now we've decided to buy a home in our new location. To do so, 
however, we must sell our old home to get the cash for our down payment. How 
can we accomplish this and avoid tax on our sale profit which we estimate will 
be about $75,000? 
</P>
<P>
A: That's easy. Just move back into your former residence. Then sell it and buy 
a replacement principal residence of equal or greater cost within 24 months 
before or after the sale. This is the "roll-over residence replacement rule" of 
Internal Revenue Code 1034. 
</P>
<P>
The tax code does not require a minimum occupancy time but most CPAs recommend 
six to 12 months. Please consult your tax adviser for further details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Life Estate May Protect Property for a Son 
</P>
<P>
Q: We have three wonderful adult sons. I am 74 and my husband is 82. As we both 
have heart problems, we could die any day. One of our children is mildly 
retarded and we want to be sure he receives our house when we die. 
</P>
<P>
He lives with us now. But we are worried about one son who might challenge our 
wills, since my husband has Alzheimer's disease. In your opinion, what is the 
best way to make certain our retarded son receives our home? Incidentally, we 
have provided for all three sons through a trust, so they will have handsome 
incomes. 
</P>
<P>
A: A life estate could solve your problem. You could deed your home to the 
retarded son now but reserve a life estate in it for the lives of you and your 
husband. It would then be very difficult for either of your other sons to take 
the house away from the retarded son after you both pass away. But please 
consult your attorney and tax adviser for further details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Need to Reinvest All in Replacement 
</P>
<P>
Q: Two months ago, we sold our home. But after paying off our mortgage and 
pressing personal bills we have only about $33,000 left with which to buy 
another house. Our real estate man says we must reinvest all the cash from our 
home sale into a replacement home if we are to avoid paying tax on our sale 
profit, which was about $58,000. How can we get out of this mess? 
</P>
<P>
A: What mess? To defer the tax on your home sale you do not have to reinvest 
all your cash received into the purchase of a replacement home. Your real 
estate agent is mistaken. 
</P>
<P>
All that matters if you are to avoid paying tax on your sale profit is that you 
buy and occupy a replacement principal residence of equal or greater cost 
within 24 months before or after the sale of your old home. Internal Revenue 
Code 1034, known as the "roll-over residence replacement rule," says nothing 
about reinvesting all the cash received from your home sale into the purchase 
of a replacement home. 
</P>
<P>
An extreme qualifying example would occur if you sold your old home for all 
cash and bought a replacement principal residence of equal or greater cost for 
nothing down, such as with a no down payment VA mortgage. Then you could pocket 
the tax-deferred cash to spend as you wish. Please consult your tax adviser for 
more details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Home Sale Tax Losses Are Not Deductable 
</P>
<P>
Q: We bought our home last year, expecting to stay here forever. But then my 
wife received a tremendous job opportunity in New York City. Since I am a 
free-lance writer and can live anywhere, we decided to sell our home and move. 
But our problem is, if we sell our home we will have a loss of about $6,500 on 
the sale of our home after we pay the realtor's commission. Is this loss tax 
deductible? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Unfortunately, losses on the sale of your personal residence are not tax 
deductible. But Uncle Sam is very quick to tax home sale profits, unless the 
sale qualifies for the "over 55 rule" $125,000 tax exemption or the "roll-over 
residence replacement rule" tax deferral. Please consult your tax adviser for 
further details.

S.F. HIGH-RISES SURVIVE QUAKE WITH ONLY MINOR DAMAGE; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY: REVISED BUILDING CODES AND NEWER CONSTRUCTION SHOULD KEEP TALL 
BUILDINGS IN SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES STANDING FIRM AFTER A STIFF QUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The gleaming skyscrapers that make this city the Manhattan of the West Coast 
survived the shuddering vibrations of the Oct. 17 quake with only minor damage, 
city officials and structural engineers say. 
</P>
<P>
A Bechtel engineer who participated in a crash inspection program, as well as a 
Los Angeles city engineer, said the results should be encouraging for Los 
Angeles, where tall buildings are of more recent vintage. 
</P>
<P>
The 52-story Bank of America building, built in 1969, received a mere $5,000 in 
damage. The landmark TransAmerica building, finished in the early 1970s, had 
minimal damage. 
</P>
<P>
And the newer 101 California building, a recent glass-and-steel addition to the 
Market Street canyon, came through unscathed except for cracks in stairwell 
plasterboard and minor damage to a loading dock. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Chiu, San Francisco's chief building inspector, said as the high-rise 
inspection program wound down that none of the estimated 400 buildings taller 
than 75 feet that had been inspected since the quake, sustained major 
structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
Only six received damage severe enough to restrict access, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He attributed this to the city's strict, updated earthquake code that mandates 
that buildings built under looser requirements be modernized and to a good 
enforcement team. 
</P>
<P>
"That is why the high-rises could withstand this 7.0 quake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chiu led a team of city building and fire inspectors, supplemented by about 100 
volunteer Bechtel Corp. engineers. 
</P>
<P>
Concentrating at first on the buildings constructed before 1975, when building 
code amendments inspired by the 1971 Sylmar quake took effect, the inspectors 
looked for obvious structural problems, as well as damage to facades and 
jutting parapets. 
</P>
<P>
While no major structural problems were reported, Bechtel Corp. engineer Jim 
Appleton said damage to the parapet on the old Channel 7 building on Golden 
Gate Avenue was visible from across the street. "Another shake and she would 
have come down on the building adjacent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 20 -- after completing inspections on almost all of the older buildings 
-- the team began focusing on more modern buildings. The results from the first 
inspections of the modern buildings were even more reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
At the 101 California building, the emergency power kicked in right after the 
quake, and the sprinkler system stayed in place. Nothing fell off the exterior. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing," said Jim Barjioni, the building's chief engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Terry McGillivray, a Bechtel structural engineer who helped organize the 
volunteer inspector corps, said a number of factors contribute to the good 
performance of modern high-rise buildings under the strains of an earthquake: 
</P>
<P>
* Because they are bigger, they are less likely to resonate in step with the 
typical ground vibrations that can cause a smaller structure to shake more and 
more violently. 
</P>
<P>
* The steel frame construction, which can sway more than a foot at the top of a 
tall building, can absorb vibrational energy and is far less likely to fly 
apart, compared to load-bearing walls made of brick or unreinforced concrete 
block. 
</P>
<P>
* Larger new buildings typically are engineered better than older, smaller 
buildings. Careful analysis of the soil underneath makes settling less likely. 
</P>
<P>
McGillivray said a more careful analysis of the performance of San Francisco's 
skyscrapers will be done, along with an examination of ground motions and 
stress calculations for specific structures. 
</P>
<P>
In a few weeks, a computer will re-enact the quake motions of the 101 
California building, which had seismographs in its basement as well as on the 
8th, 24th and 48th floors. 
</P>
<P>
McGillivray said his experience in inspecting San Francisco high-rise buildings 
has led him to conclude that Los Angeles would fare as well or better in a 
quake the same force of Tuesday's in San Francisco. The Los Angeles code is 
similar to San Francisco's for high-rise construction. 
</P>
<P>
"For Los Angeles, with a newer skyline, you would be awfully surprised if there 
was any kind of damage at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The more modern buildings that have been designed for more recent (building) 
codes should be good for larger earthquakes (than the Oct. 17 temblor)." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles building code is updated every three years, and requires 
minimum standards designed to save most lives but not prevent all damage in a 
quake the strength of the San Francisco temblor, said Doc Mghiem, an engineer 
in the city of Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety, earthquake safety 
division. 
</P>
<P>
"We're using basically the same code (as San Francisco), Mghiem said, and 
modifying it as needed, taking into account the condition of the soil, a 
building's distance from known faults and its likely distance from the 
anticipated epicenter of a quake. 
</P>
<P>
"High-rises (in downtown L.A.) behaved pretty well after the Whittier quake," 
he said. "We would expect the same good behavior if we got a quake similar to 
the San Francisco quake." Buildings would remain standing, he said, but 
ceilings and partitions would fall and business as usual could not continue. 
</P>
<P>
Mghiem said the Los Angeles code is just the minimum required for basic safety 
and "in order to get a building behaving better than that, you have to do 
something better than barely the minimum. If a real big one hits, if ceilings 
come down -- and they do come down -- there will be some damage, some 
interruption of business and some destruction here and there, depending on how 
much above code the buildings were designed." 
</P>
<P>
Mgheim said the city's priority for building quake safety in Los Angeles since 
1981 has been on rehabilitating older high-rises where low-income residents 
live. 
</P>
<P>
"The City Council is very concerned about giving the homeless something safe so 
they (don't end up homeless again)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a few weeks, a computer will re-enact the motions of San Francisco's 101 
California building, which had seismographs in its basement and on the 8th, 
24th and 48th floors. 
</P>
<P>
But Betty Brookes needed nothing fancy to tell her the building was shaking 
badly at 5:04 p.m. Tuesday -- even though the damage was minimal. 
</P>
<P>
An administrative assistant for Thomas A. Greene &amp; Co. Inc., which has 
offices on the 46th floor of the 101 California building, Brookes said, "All of 
a sudden, things started dancing all over my desk. Things started popping out 
of the ceiling. The doors opened. The drawers slid open." 
</P>
<P>
Crouched under her desk, she said, she had the feeling that the top of the 
building was making a slow arc from side to side. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt like we were swinging in space," she said. 
</P>
<P>
After the quake, she and others who had been in the office began the long climb 
down 45 stories. 
</P>
<P>
About half way, she said, she met a woman who said she worked for a firm that 
analyzes how buildings perform in earthquakes. The woman told her that the 
building was one of the best in the state, as far as earthquake resistance was 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"Yet it seemed miraculous that we weren't under the rubble," she said.

IN THE GARDEN: PIONEERING PERENNIALS NOW AVAILABLE HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, TIMES GARDEN EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These are exciting times for those who like flowers. Thanks to a phenomenal 
interest in flowers -- perennials in particular -- commercial growers have been 
trying all sorts of unusual plants in a search for new flowers to brighten our 
garden beds and borders. 
</P>
<P>
Since this is the perfect time to plant perennials and most other plants (so 
they are completely established by spring with a minimum of watering), let me 
introduce you to a few of these newcomers to pique your interest. 
</P>
<P>
Even if you cannot find these particular plants, they are but a sampling; when 
you're out shopping for things to plant this fall, keep an eye open for the new 
and unusual. They will make spring all the more surprising when they flower for 
the first time in your garden. 
</P>
<P>
These were discovered at two particularly adventuresome wholesale growers. You 
cannot order these directly from the growers, but can ask your nurseryman to 
order them for you. El Modeno Gardens sells to most nurseries. Hi Mark Nursery 
only sells to nurseries from about Culver City north, though Roger's Gardens in 
Corona del Mar, Heard's County Gardens in Westminster and Palos Verdes Begonia 
Farm are regular customers further south. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best perennials to come along -- the spectacular and nearly 
ever-blooming alstroemeria -- was hard to find until very recently, but now 
nurseryman Jan Groot at El Modeno is growing them by the thousands, from tubers 
imported from Holland. 
</P>
<P>
These are not the home-grown alstroemerias that have caused quite a stir in San 
Diego County. The plants are shorter (about 2 feet tall) and the flowers 
smaller, but they are still excellent as cut flowers, lasting a week or more in 
a vase, and bloom most of the year in the garden. 
</P>
<P>
They have five varieties: two reds, two different pinks and a yellow are 
offered. 
</P>
<P>
"Sunrise" is a new wrinkle in marguerites that came from the U.C. Irvine 
arboretum. It has streaked flowers that open a hot pink and fade to a softer 
shade. Near the center of each flower is a band of yellow. 
</P>
<P>
It flowers most of the year but Jan's son, Dana Groot, tells me they are more 
brightly colored in summer and the plants are more upright, tending to sprawl a 
little in winter. They suggest cutting them back in January or February after 
the first year in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other marguerites which object to any attempt at pruning, these rebound. 
Plants grow 2 1/2- to 3-feet tall and are 3 to 4 feet across. 
</P>
<P>
El Modeno is also growing a number of salvias which are the stalwarts of the 
late summer and fall garden. The most interesting are the varieties of Salvia 
greggii, which can stand a great deal of heat, and some drought. This is 
actually a small shrub, growing about 3 or 4 feet around. It can be sheared, 
and blooms for a very long season. 
</P>
<P>
They have a rosy red, bright red, one named "Furman's Red" that is quite dark, 
and a white-flowered form. Inland and even desert gardeners should give this 
one a try. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Bartholomew at Hi Mark Nursery is growing a salvia with flowers so blue it 
is startling, and they come at a most useful time -- right now, in late summer 
and fall. It is Salvia azurea grandiflora and the flowers are larger than those 
on most salvias. 
</P>
<P>
They are large enough, and numerous enough, to cause the plant to topple over, 
making this a very untidy perennial, but some control can be had by cutting it 
back severely just as it is about to flower. 
</P>
<P>
It immediately bounces back, but is shorter and more manageable, with even more 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Teucrium hircanicum is another late-summer bloomer with bold purple spikes and 
wooly green leaves that are also tinged with purple. 
</P>
<P>
From a distance, it has a misty appearance, as if it were about to disappear in 
a purple haze. It is a perennial that grows to 2 or 3 feet across and almost as 
tall when in flower. 
</P>
<P>
Hi Mark is also growing two perennial foxgloves with intriguing flowers. One, 
Digitalis laevigata, has flowers that look like gold helmets and a beard 
beneath that is striped gold. And, I mean gold, like the metal, not like a 
marigold. It makes a dense permanent clump and sends up spikes to 3 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Digitalis lanata has white flowers with purple veins and a yellow throat. It, 
too, sends spikes to about 3 feet. Both prefer shade inland but take full sun 
on the coast. 
</P>
<P>
From Mexico, comes a marigold that is a perennial: Tagetes lucida. It grows to 
about 3 feet tall and as big around, and then flowers in fall. The large golden 
yellow heads are made up of hundreds of tiny, tiny marigold flowers. It is 
commonly called Mexican tarragon for its culinary uses. 
</P>
<P>
Verbena bonariensis is a cousin of one of my favorite flowers, Verbena rigida. 
It, too, has pure purple flowers all summer and fall, but they come atop thin 
but sturdy 4-foot stems so they seem to float over the garden like little 
purple clouds. It has the same stiff foliage at ground level. When it finishes 
flowering, simply cut it back and it begins again. 
</P>
<P>
Adenophoras, also called ladybells, are campanula relatives and Hi Mark is 
growing one named Adenophora lillifolia that sends up spikes of lilac-blue 
bellflowers about 2 to 3 feet tall from a clump of deep green leaves. It has a 
definite cottage garden look. 
</P>
<P>
These plants are all new enough so you will also be pioneering their culture in 
California. Even the growers are not sure how long they will persist in the 
garden, or even exactly how large they will get, but even that can be 
considered part of the fun of growing anything new. 
</P>
<P>
One thing is certain -- you will not be disappointed in their flowers.

FLOWERS: CALIFORNIA POPPIES AND OTHER SELF-SEEDING PLANTS WILL POP UP WITHOUT 
WORK, BUT NOT ALL TYPES MAY FIT THE DESIRED COLOR SCHEME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ELLEN GUFFEY

<TEXT>
<P>
Every spring, clusters of California poppies slip into the corners of my garden 
near the rock walls or between the stepping stones. Their tiny carrot tops 
quickly grow into clumps of copious blooms that any flower grower would 
normally prize. 
</P>
<P>
But their powerful orange hue often sabotages my planned color scheme, and 
their assertive growth obstructs my garden paths. Yet, it's difficult to refuse 
these eager volunteers. They're beautiful, they're easy to grow and they're 
free. 
</P>
<P>
I've learned over the years to cope with, and indeed encourage, many 
self-seeding flowers, particularly those that retain their best 
characteristics. Some volunteers, through open-garden pollination and lack of 
selection, become lanky, like coreopsis, or lose their color range, like 
larkspur. Others, apparently because they are not hybrids, return year after 
year looking exactly like their parents. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite garden volunteers are gaillardia and rudbeckia. These flowers, with 
their Indian reds and blazing golds, epitomize California summer gardening. 
Unlike English gardens bathed in filtered light and washed by almost daily 
showers, where muted colors and restrained plantings dominate, our gardens are 
soaked in brilliant sunshine under cloudless blue skies. 
</P>
<P>
California gardens look insipid, even wimpy, without strong color; and these 
two flowers, both natives of the Americas, are soures of bold and brash hues. 
</P>
<P>
I planted Gaillardia pulchella from seed many years ago, and now it returns 
every year, even though I dig up the area. This gaillardia produces 2-inch 
barn-red blooms with petals tipped in gold. 
</P>
<P>
Its sister plant G. grandiflora has somewhat larger blooms. Mine are a 
wonderful gold with red tips. Gaillardia seedlings are easy to identify in the 
spring; their hairy leaves are light green and slightly toothed. They thrive in 
ordinary well-drained soil and get along nicely on sparse water rations. 
</P>
<P>
Complementing the reds and golds of gaillardia flowers is Rudbeckia hirta, 
commonly called black-eyed Susan or gloriosa daisy. The large cone-centered 
flowers in the picture are descendants of double gloriosa daisies planted in my 
garden more than eight years ago. Some are still double, although others have 
reverted to single status -- which is fine with me because the singles tend to 
stand up better when the wind blows. 
</P>
<P>
Other volunteer rudbeckias in my garden were originally planted as species 
forms of R. hirta. The 2-inch gold blooms appear on rounded 18-inch plants, and 
because of their symmetrical shape and their ability to remain upstanding, I'm 
beginning to like them better than the larger gloriosa daisies. 
</P>
<P>
Poppies are reliable self-seeders, returning year after year to gardens they 
like. California poppies have to be introduced only once; after that, they 
produce seeds that are determined to germinate and perpetuate themselves 
seemingly ever after. By the way, they bear more flowers if they're not overfed 
or overwatered. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley poppies are also prodigious seed makers, but the lovely, frilly flowers 
from seed packets result from careful selection and crossbreeding. In the 
garden, without that purposeful selection, succeeding year's crops become less 
varied and less fancy. Still, Shirley poppies are always pretty, their 
volunteers always welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Other annuals eager to make repeat performances are alyssum, cosmos, gilia, 
scabiosa, forget-me-nots, summer chrysanthemums, strawflowers, and linaria. 
</P>
<P>
A few perennials grow easily from their own seeds without a gardener's 
attention. In my garden, I continually find baby statice (Limonium perezii) 
plants coming up. When they're small, it's easy to transplant them to the right 
spot or to grow them in a flat for later use. 
</P>
<P>
Rose campion (Lynchnis coronaria), its silver foliage contrasting with stunning 
ruby-colored flowers, delivers babies by the dozen, some so determined to live 
that they dangle from rock walls, daring me to remove them. Columbine and 
foxglove volunteers abound, as do dusty miller plantlets. As a bonus, all these 
plants are fairly drought-tolerant. 
</P>
<P>
To encourage volunteer plants, here are some tips. Let some flowers go to seed; 
don't pick them all for bouquets and don't be too fastidious in cleaning up the 
garden. To ensure a big return from likely volunteers, shake the dried seed 
capsules from the plants when you're pulling them up at this time of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Don't cultivate too heavily. I must admit, however, that I dig up most of my 
garden every year, and the volunteers return regardless. 
</P>
<P>
Learn to recognize the seedlings of the good guys. Actually, it may be easier 
at first to learn to distinguish the bad guys. Normally, a garden has only a 
few kinds of weeds. If you can identify them when they are small, you can 
remove them, watching the other seedlings to see what develops. In time, you'll 
know all the good plants in their seedling forms. 
</P>
<P>
If I let my Scot's genes and instincts take over, I could grow an entire garden 
using just volunteers and perhaps some divisions from overgrown perennials. 
</P>

COMMERCIAL SCENE: DEVELOPER CREATES NEW FIRM, SEEKING PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Developer Alan Lowy has created Pacific Prime Properties Inc. to replace 
troubled Lowy Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Within the last year, Lowy's company was forced to bow out of several 
construction projects and take two partnerships into bankruptcy. All the 
projects are now sold -- with the exception of a deep hole at 4848 Wilshire 
Blvd. in the Park Mile area of Los Angeles that was set to become a 
60,000-square-foot office building. 
</P>
<P>
Parkmile Associates Ltd. filed for Chapter 11 protection in February after 
lender ITT Commercial Finance filed a notice of default on its $3.18 million 
loan. Lowy says he expects to sell the property within the next 45 days for 
between $2 million and $2.6 million, with ITT taking a hit for the balance. 
</P>
<P>
Lowy pre-leased most of the planned office project before construction began, 
but financial difficulties with other projects in downtown Los Angeles dried up 
his financing, he said, leaving him little choice but to fold. 
</P>
<P>
The longtime Los Angeles developer said he is searching for projects in Orange 
County and the Antelope Valley with new partner Howard Fuhrman. Fuhrman 
recently left his post as vice president-finance at Janss Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"I've tried very hard to protect my reputation through all of this," Lowy said. 
"I hope people still feel good about me personally."

ACQUISITION: CANADIAN DEVELOPER KEPT AFTER PROPERTY OWNED BY DATAPRODUCTS UNTIL

If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. 
</P>
<P>
Such seems to be the moral for investors serious about buying a well-located 
property. For a primer on the pursuit, just ask Trizec Properties. 
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Trizec made an unsolicited offer for about 22 acres of plum 
Woodland Hills property, currently home to Dataproducts Corp. When the printer 
company refused, however, Trizec didn't settle for a no. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Calgary, Canada-based developer cut a deal to acquire two parcels 
along Erwin Street for $57 million from DPC Acquisition Partners, a group of 
dissident Dataproducts shareholders seeking a hostile takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Had the deal gone through, DPC was committed to vacating the premises so that 
Trizec could redevelop a chunk of it as 500,000 square feet of high-end office 
space. 
</P>
<P>
The plan didn't exactly work. 
</P>
<P>
Financially troubled Dataproducts decided to fight back, hiring Goldman, Sachs 
&amp; Co. to evaluate potential suitors, and Landauer Associates Inc. of West 
Los Angeles to directly market their prized property adjacent to Warner Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
But, as DPC's bid faltered, Trizec wasted no time presenting Dataproducts with 
yet another bid -- this one for $63 million, which won Dataproducts' consent. 
</P>
<P>
Trizec is set to close escrow on its all-cash purchase sometime in November. 
Meanwhile, DPC investors, led by the New York investment firm Crescott Inc., 
announced yet another hostile bid for Dataproducts in mid-October. All parties 
involved -- including Trizec, Dataproducts and DPC -- expect the sale to go 
forward as planned, however. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't enough quality property available for people looking to buy," said 
Ivan Faggen, real estate services group director at Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Almost everybody with money to invest is looking for property in Southern 
California, reports Faggen, and investors are trying "whatever works" to 
acquire the right site. This summer, Schickler Meringoff Properties of Los 
Angeles even went so far as to offer a new Porsche to any broker who could get 
the company into escrow on a suitable investment property. 
</P>
<P>
The competition among buyers for top-tier properties may best explain Trizec's 
perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of people who wanted to buy our property in Woodland Hills," said 
Frank McQuaid, vice president of Dataproducts. "But, we weren't ready to sell." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he said, the company decided it didn't make sense to hold on to a 
$63-million property for manufacturing plants. The best way to fight a 
takeover, reasoned executives, was to divest the company of its real estate 
holdings and eliminate marginal operations. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Dataproducts announced plans to lay off 400 mostly local 
employees over the next year. Also up for sale is a New England division for 
between $40 million and $45 million and 25 acres in Austin, Tex., for $2 
million. So far, reports McQuaid, there are no takers. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of staying in the San Fernando Valley, McQuaid sees his company 
relocating to an area such as the Simi Valley, where land is available for well 
below the $2.9 million an acre it is getting from Trizec. 
</P>
<P>
Trizec, in turn, gets some of the West Valley's most coveted properties and an 
almost guaranteed leasing market once construction is completed. Trizec also 
has two years to obtain all needed development rights, while Dataproducts 
leases back its facilities at $6.5 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We originally couldn't get Dataproducts to talk to us," recalled Trizec's 
broker, Seth Dudley. The repeated attempts finally paid off, however, said the 
Julien J. Studley Inc. vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"There is intense competition for these kinds of properties," he said. In fact, 
six other buyers were seriously in the running too. Up against such odds for 
the privilege of buying a property, he advises investors to "stretch further, 
know more and take bigger risks."

COMMERCIAL SCENE: SEVERAL LEASES SIGNED IN SOUTHLAND LOCALITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Local brokers report a relatively quiet commercial leasing scene this fall but 
all is not dead. In Seal Beach, lock maker Masco Corp. is leasing 40,000 square 
feet of office space from the Bixby Ranch Co. in a 10-year contract worth more 
than $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company plans to relocate 130 employees from Long Beach to the Bixby Office 
Park at Old Ranch early next year. Gregory Gill and Robert Alperin of 
Matlow-Kennedy represented the tenant in lease negotiations. Steve Reaume of 
Cushman Realty Corp. represented the developer. 
</P>
<P>
At the Cerritos Towne Center, Canadian computer firm System House signed a 
10-year, $10.5-million lease for 42,000 square feet. Coldwell Banker 
represented the tenant and Tim Stilley of Grubb &amp; Ellis Commercial Real 
Estate Services represented landlord Transpacific Development Co. 
</P>
<P>
In downtown Los Angeles, U.S. Bancorp Financial Inc. is relocating from the 
Jewelry Mart on Hill Street to 20,000 square feet at Figueroa Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Acerra of Jones, Lang, Wooton Realty Croup represented U.S. Bancorp in the 
10-year, $6-million lease. David Cushman and Peter Berrington of Cushman Realty 
Corp. represented owners Raffi Cohen Industries and Melvin Simon &amp; 
Associates Inc. 
</P>
<P>
And in West L.A., Apple Computer announced plans to take 46,000 square feet at 
Bramalea California Inc.'s just completed 600 Corporate Pointe tower. The 
270,000-square-foot building cost $22 million and is Bramalea's sixth within 
the 35-acre Corporate Pointe near the San Diego Freeway and Slauson Avenue. 
Coldwell Banker represented Apple in the five-year, $5.5-million lease. WESTMAC 
Commercial Brokerage Co. represented the developer.

EXPERIENCING RAIN FOREST RUSH IN AUSSIE PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
LAMINGTON NATIONAL PARK, Australia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of my loves in the world of nature is dense rain forest where trails have 
been cut so that walking is easy amid a stillness that is never quite silent. 
</P>
<P>
In such a setting one can get caught up in a kind of tropical, botanical rush. 
Lamington National Park, 70 miles southwest of Brisbane in Queensland, is one 
of my favorites. 
</P>
<P>
Established in 1915, Lamington is shining, sweet-smelling and innocent. It can 
be seen easily on day-hikes from Binna Burra Lodge, a rustic hotel atop Mt. 
Roberts in the McPherson Ranges from where it looks down upon mist-enshrouded 
waves of throttling green. 
</P>
<P>
The lodge is a perfect spot for escaping the hustle and bustle of the Gold 
Coast. From Binna Burra, armed with a packed lunch and adequate water, you can 
wander through 50,000 square acres of subtropical rain forest laced with cool 
mountain streams and more than 500 waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
Within the velveteen jungle the air is cool and dank and underwater green, and 
ignores the crushing intensity of the sun vibrating on the forest canopy. 
</P>
<P>
The forest is alive with liquid, musical calls, and the whistles, sudden 
squawks and raucous screeches of lorikeets and honey eaters squabbling among 
the hoop pines. In the treetops, unseen creatures are on the move. 
</P>
<P>
Lamington has a short "Senses Nature Trail" designed for the blind, with 
Braille signs and recorded descriptions along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Although more than 100 miles of well-maintained track weave through this 
woodland retreat, you don't have to venture far to get close to Lamington's 
magnificent wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Satin bower birds are common around Binna Burra. In the morning you can hear 
the pure notes of a white-lined honey eater's song, like a woman calling out 
for her lover. 
</P>
<P>
Or the thud of the red-necked pademelon, a small, timid relative of the 
kangaroo, as it forages at the grassy edge of the forest. 
</P>
<P>
Sugar gliders and brush-tailed possums settle by the kitchen window at night. 
And rainbow lorikeets are always sure to be begging a bite. 
</P>
<P>
Although Australia's rain forests occupy less than one-thousandth of the 
continent -- gathered together they would fit into a circle only 45 miles in 
radius -- they support one-third of Australia's flora and fauna. 
</P>
<P>
Lamington contains creatures, plants and trees that exist nowhere else; some of 
them have yet to be classified; others are what are known as "green dinosaurs," 
plants so primitive and ancient that they seem to have been left over from a 
period before the Ice Age. 
</P>
<P>
Still others -- pademelons, potoroos and quolls -- have names that are as 
strange as the animals look. 
</P>
<P>
(As elsewhere in the world, Australia's rain forests are vanishing at a 
frightening pace. Lamington, which was named a preserve in 1915, is a luxuriant 
remnant of the great tropical forests that once covered much of Queensland.) 
</P>
<P>
It is a place of peace and renewal, like a vast, vaulted cathedral -- 
mysterious, strangely silent and of Gothic proportions. A 14th-Century 
stonemason would probably have felt at home in Lamington, with its buttressed, 
moss-columned, towering trees and dark recesses. 
</P>
<P>
Plunging deep into the forest, one is soon struck by how much variety there is. 
First, giant strangler figs sweep upward 100 feet or more before merging like 
giant umbrellas to choke off the light. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath, seeping in moisture, huge piccabeen palms burst upward like solidified 
fountains glistening in the sunbeams slanting in from above. On more exposed 
slopes the rain forest is drier and species such as hoop pines emerge from the 
canopy. 
</P>
<P>
Less fertile soils support eucalypt forest, while Antarctic beech forests 
thrive in the mists and cloud peaks above 3,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Vicious, whiplike wait-a-while vines and endless snaking lengths of smooth 
lawyer-cane grapple their way up to the canopy. On every available surface, 
giant elkhorns, mistletoe and bird's nest ferns hang in great galleries, often 
reaching such weights that whole limbs are torn away and crash down to join the 
decaying litter on the forest floor. 
</P>
<P>
The rich rain forest-green backdrops the jewel colors of its many inhabitants. 
Sit still for a while and the hidden creatures may get used to your presence 
and emerge from the shadows. Don't be surprised if a squadron of scarlet 
eclectus parrots flashes by, followed by an enormous Ulysses butterfly floating 
past like a torn sheet of turquoise tissue. 
</P>
<P>
Is that vine really moving? Most likely it's a brilliantly costumed green 
python, so green it is almost iridescent, draped in seductive coils on a 
branch. Or the beautifully marked yellow-and-black lace monitor or 
tree-climbing goanna, which can grow to six feet long. 
</P>
<P>
In the canopy, forest trees flower and produce fruit in the steaming tropical 
sunshine. Sugar gliders -- a species of "flying" possum -- leap and run along 
the branches, fossicking for nectar and insects, while white-eared monarchs and 
other insectivorous birds watch from their vantage points for any movement that 
will betray a stick insect or leaf-green tree frog to scoop up for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
The "zeeet, zeeet" you hear is the sound of the rainbow-colored, double-eyed 
fig parrot. Musk lorikeets -- green with bright red headbands -- plunge and 
sway in the canopy blossoms, announcing their play-act with an outburst of 
shrieks. 
</P>
<P>
Dislodged and partly eaten fruits patter to the ground below, to be scavenged 
by scrubfowl, brush turkeys and rat kangaroos. The meowing of catbirds comes 
with the twilight. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly the lisping of insects begins; there is a faint rustle as marsupial mice 
and possums come out to forage and feast in the litter, and the squabbling of 
fruit bats replaces that of the birds. All around, myriad beetles and moths are 
taking wing in the moist velvet blanket of the subtropical night. 
</P>
<P>
Venturing out at night on a guided moonlit walk, you might also see sparkling 
glowworms, as at Natural Bridge Cave, or even luminous fungus. 
</P>
<P>
The graded walking track system at Lamington is one of the best of any national 
park in the world, with well-posed and well-maintained trails to suit every 
ability. 
</P>
<P>
But beware. Rains and moisture bring leeches. And Lamington, like most rain 
forests, has its fair share of leeches. To discourage them, rub plenty of soap 
or insect repellent onto your shoes and socks. They find the chemicals far less 
appetizing than blood. 
</P>
<P>
From Binna Burra, a walk on the Tullawallal Circuit (three miles) will take you 
to a patch of Antarctic beech trees, remnants of a once-widespread vegetation 
type that characterized a cooler, wetter period in Australia's past. 
</P>
<P>
The Swimming Pool Track (six miles) descends to Gwongoorool, a large pool in 
the Coomera River where you can swim with tame eels and also see catfish. The 
top of the track is a good place for spotting Lumholtz's tree kangaroos, or 
even koalas munching on eucalyptus high in the canopy. 
</P>
<P>
That prince of dancers, the lyrebird, is best seen along the Border Track near 
Joalah Lookout. And the Orchid Bower-Araucaria track is most noted for its 
spectacular orchids, of which the park has more than 700 species. 
</P>
<P>
The most scenic track? Perhaps Bellbird Lookout Circuit, where -- at Bellbird 
Lookout -- the forest opens up like a theater curtain to reveal the blue waters 
of the Pacific Ocean in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
Guests can choose activities organized by the Binna Burra guides, or hike 
alone. The daily program includes guided walks, adventure hikes through rugged 
terrain, abseiling (descending a cliff or mountain by rope; beginner lessons 
are given) and bus tours for the less active. The lodge offers special courses 
on photography and gardening. And there is plenty of rock climbing. 
</P>
<P>
Bush walks require only appropriate clothing, a sturdy pair of boots or shoes, 
a small daypack and a water bottle. Bring a sweater -- it can get cold even in 
summer. And rain gear is a must, for when the rain comes, it thunders down 
vertically. 
</P>
<P>
Binna Burra Lodge offers three grades of cabin: single, shared single and 
double. Prices range from $83 U.S. to $230 a night. Most have their own shower 
and toilet, with heating and electric blankets for the cooler months, plus 
refrigeration and tea-making facilities, and a veranda overlooking the valley. 
</P>
<P>
Daily, midweek, weekend and seven-day packages that include meals and selected 
activities are available. Reservations are recommended. 
</P>
<P>
You also can spend a weekend "wilderness camping" in the mountains. Get a 
permit from the chief ranger at Binna Burra. 
</P>
<P>
For more information and reservations, contact the North American sales 
representative for Binna Burra Lodge -- SH Enterprises, 520 Monterey Drive, Rio 
del Mar, Calif. 95003, (408) 685-8902. 
</P>
<P>
Lamington is 90 minutes and a world away from Brisbane and the Gold Coast. The 
Mountain Coach Co. offers daily service each afternoon to Binna Burra from the 
Brisbane Transit Center on Roma Street. It costs about $18.50 U.S. each way. No 
reservations are necessary. 
</P>

TRIP OF THE WEEK: CAPISTRANO IS NOT JUST FOR THE BIRDS 
</P>

SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the swallows of Capistrano left town Monday to fly back to their 
winter home in South America, the 200-year-old mission is worth visiting 
anytime. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, archeologists have unearthed foundations and relics that make 
a tour of the old Spanish compound even more interesting. 
</P>
<P>
Among the discoveries was the first metal smelter in California, where Indians 
made wrought iron. A railing they crafted for the choir loft is still in the 
historic Serra Chapel that dates to 1777. 
</P>
<P>
That narrow adobe structure continues to be used daily for religious services, 
and is the oldest building in the state where Father Junipero Serra said Mass. 
He founded the mission as the seventh in the chain of 21 Spanish outposts 
established by Franciscan friars up and down the state. 
</P>
<P>
Also visit the new St. John of Capistrano parish church, named in honor of the 
mission's patron saint. It replaces the Great Stone Church that was destroyed 
by an earthquake in 1812. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Also Tour Other Sites 
</P>
<P>
On Sundays you can join a guided tour to other historic sites in San Juan 
Capistrano, Orange County's oldest town. Gift shops and restaurants offer 
additional enjoyment for visitors. 
</P>
<P>
A pleasant way to reach Capistrano is aboard Amtrak, which has eight trains 
daily from Los Angeles and San Diego, as well as less-frequent service from 
Santa Barbara and intermediate stations. Call toll-free (800) 872-7245 for 
schedules and fares. You'll arrive at the 1895 depot, which has been converted 
into a popular restaurant and is two blocks from the mission. 
</P>
<P>
If you drive from Los Angeles, head south on Interstate 5 to the Ortega Highway 
exit and go west three blocks to the mission entrance. Park on the street 
without charge. 
</P>
<P>
Known as the Jewel of the Missions, the walled-in compound covers 10 acres and 
can be explored daily between 7:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. on a self-guided tour. 
You'll received a tour map at the entry gate, where adults pay $2 and children 
under 12 years 50 cents. The visitor center telephone number is (714) 493-1424. 
</P>
<P>
On most Sundays volunteer docents in period dress wait just inside the entrance 
between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. to show visitors around. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grounds Are Flowered 
</P>
<P>
Although the Indians and padres planted only fruit trees, vegetables and other 
crops for food, today the mission grounds are covered with flowers and 
ornamental plants. Beyond the rose garden in the entry plaza, bougainvillea 
frames a statue of Father Serra with a young Indian. 
</P>
<P>
It's flanked on the right by ruins of the Great Stone Church, and on the left 
by the bells that once hung in the church tower. The bells are rung only once a 
year, on March 19, when the swallows traditionally return to Capistrano from 
Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
New efforts to save the vintage buildings are evident around the compound. 
You'll notice roped off structures that are being reinforced as part of a 
10-year project to prevent damage by earthquakes. Off-limits are the soldiers' 
barracks, but you can visit the padres' kitchen and quarters a few steps away. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen is inside a huge chimney that has ovens in its four corners. In one 
of the padre's rooms you'll see a model of the original mission and a picture 
of St. John of Capistrano. The adjoining wing holds the Serra Chapel that's 
highlighted by an ornately carved altar brought from Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relics Excavated 
</P>
<P>
Across the quadrangle are museum rooms with Indian artifacts and relics of the 
Spanish soldiers. Excavations inside and behind the building have revealed vats 
for making wine, for tanning animal hides and rendering fat for soap and 
candles. 
</P>
<P>
The last Saturday of every month is Living History Day at the mission, when 
Native Americans and docents weave rugs and blankets, spin and cook in a 
beehive oven as in days gone by. Two volunteers roam the grounds dressed as 
Father Serra and a Spanish soldier. 
</P>
<P>
To learn more about Capistrano's early times, join the guided walking tour of 
town that leaves at 1 p.m. Sundays across from the mission at El Peon Plaza. 
Adults pay $1, children 50 cents. Proceeds from the hourlong tours are used to 
restore the city's old adobes that you'll see on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
Also visit the O'Neill Museum to view local memorabilia in a restored 
century-old home that serves as headquarters for the San Juan Historical 
Society. It's open Sundays from noon to 3 p.m. and Tuesday through Friday from 
9 a.m. to noon and 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is on the other side of the railroad tracks at 31831 Los Rios St. 
Stroll along that street to see several of the historic adobe homes built 
during the mission's early days. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rides for the Kids 
</P>
<P>
Across from the museum is the Jones Mini Farm, where children can ride ponies 
or a donkey on weekends between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Rides costs $1.75. Call 
(714) 496-7328. Hayrides are available for groups and birthday parties. 
</P>
<P>
If you're hungry, visit the nearby restaurant in the Capistrano Depot, which 
houses vintage railroad cars. A Dixieland jazz band plays there Sunday 
afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street is Franciscan Plaza, a new multimillion-dollar tourist 
complex due to open soon with shops, a five-screen cinema and several places to 
dine. 
</P>
<P>
Along San Juan's main street, Camino Capistrano, is El Adobe, a longtime 
favorite for Mexican food that's served for lunch and dinner daily except 
Sundays. Mariachis perform during Sunday brunch (10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.) and at 
dinner Thursday through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Closer to the mission are Sarducci's Cafe-Grill, with tables indoors and 
outdoors, and Cafe Capistrano. Well known for fine food with a French flair is 
L'Hirondelle, serving Sunday brunch (11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.) and dinner daily 
from 5 p.m., except Mondays. 
</P>
<P>
Just across the street you'll see the imposing St. John Church, built in 
18th-Century California style and marked by a bell tower more than 100 feet 
tall. Enter through the side doors. 
</P>
<P>
Round trip from Los Angeles to San Juan Capistrano is 120 miles.

If you're planning a visit to New York, "The Streets Where They Lived" by 
Stephen W. Plumb will provide something extra to see. It's a walking guide to

journalists, as well as nearly 400 other noted people. There's a thumbnail 
description of each entry that also includes hotels and apartments of 
notoriety. The 212-page guide of 37 one-hour-or-less walking tours offers maps 
and historic photos. It's available at most bookstores for $12.95, or you can 
call toll-free (800) 669-4908 (MarLor Press).

The area between San Diego and San Luis Obispo is a gigantic playground for 
both children and adults, and you can discover it all in "Places to Go With 
Children in Southern California" by Stephanie Kegan. The guide details hundreds 
of things to see and do in 10 counties, including Los Angeles. The various 
theme parks are only a part of what the area offers: magnificent canyons, trout 
farms, ghost towns, aquariums, missions and much more. For $9.95 you'll find 
more than 400 entertaining diversions, many of them free (Chronicle).

When making a purchase abroad, many travelers have discovered too late that 
apparel sizes are much different from U.S. sizes. In addition, they are 
sometimes inferior or incorrectly marked. Not to worry, Fielding's "1989 
Selective Shopping Guide to Europe" by Joseph and Judith Raff lists more than 
1,400 shops and markets in 17 countries where you can buy a $5 memento or a 
$500 luxury item with confidence. Many tips are included on what to buy, when 
to haggle, customs regulations and how to order by mail (William Morrow: 
$9.95).

If you have ever had altitude sickness, tried to fend off mosquitoes or been 
concerned about the many other health challenges while traveling, the "1989 
International Trave Guide" by Dr. Stuart R. Rose should relieve your worries. 
The book is packed with checklists, maps, diagrams and explanations of 
worldwide diseases, illnesses and how to cope with them before leaving and upon 
arrival in more than 200 countries. Consider it indispensable (Travel Medicine: 
$12.95).

includes a complete director to 5,000 historic inns nationwide. It is 
delightful, succinct, detailed and well-organized. Its easy-to-follow style 
includes more than 650 illustrations. There also is a supplementary listing of 
inns that were associated with the Revolutionary and Civil wars, with details 
on famous literary, historic and political personalities (Assn. of American 
Historic Inns: $14.95).

DRIVE WAS LESS DAUNTING BY LIMOUSINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Southern California and a free-lance writer.

MONTEREY, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For me, Big Sur is the high point of any drive along California 1. 
</P>
<P>
With its immense cliffs, untamed forests and crashing surf, this classic 
90-mile coastal stretch may be the state's most dramatic landscape. 
</P>
<P>
But spectacular or not, one aspect of the journey is frequently overlooked: It 
is a terrifying drive for many people. 
</P>
<P>
I am one of those. Put me on a winding mountain road -- a hair's breadth from 
the great beyond -- and my palms go clammy. My chest constricts. Panic sets in. 
</P>
<P>
Such episodes can occasionally be hazardous. Driving the Colorado Rockies once, 
I abruptly froze in the middle of the road and had to turn over the wheel to a 
companion. 
</P>
<P>
I wanted to avoid such trauma on a recent trip to Big Sur, so I checked out the 
dangers beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it scary?" I sheepishly asked friends. Their answers were hardly 
reassuring. "It's not so bad," said one who suggested traversing the two-lane 
road from south to north. "That way you'll be on the inside." 
</P>
<P>
Others were less sanguine. My mother told of a neighbor who drove California 1 
with her husband "screaming all the way." I queried one hotel concierge who 
admitted: "I live here and I get nervous doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Making matters worse, such fears are not irrational. People do drive off the 
cliffs. The plateau beneath famed Hurricane Point "is littered with 
irretrievable vehicles whose drivers took the sharp curve with too much speed 
and too little attention," an area guidebook blithely recounts, inviting 
sightseers to peer down at the unfortunate remains. 
</P>
<P>
That was it: I would not do the dreaded drive. Neither would my mother, my 
traveling companion-to-be whose fear of heights was worse than mine. Someone 
would have to take us. 
</P>
<P>
We decided that the most convenient plan was to make Big Sur a day-trip from a 
Pebble Beach hotel less than an hour away. As for available tours, our options 
were fewer than expected. 
</P>
<P>
I found two companies offering Big Sur jaunts. However, they used vans whose 
bench-style seats seemed ill-suited to the four-hour trip. And the discomfort, 
for my mother especially, of climbing in and out. 
</P>
<P>
That left one alternative: Big Sur by limousine. At $50 an hour -- $200 plus 
tip for a four-hour trip -- the cost was admittedly steep. But considering our 
driving anxieties, this low-stress option hardly seemed like a frivolity. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Big Sur by limousine? The thought of going back to nature via this 
classic symbol of yuppie ostentation appalled even my sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
But my mother strongly favored the limo option. So I called Monterey Limousine, 
which had been recommended by our hotel. Dino Gerosolimo, the driver and 
proprietor, turned out to be a buoyant Italian who frequently did Big Sur 
tours. I blanched as he described his car: a 1988 white Lincoln stretch. 
</P>
<P>
I now had new anxieties: What would low-key locals think of our oversized 
mogul-mobile? Would it fit on the road (said to be less than 1 1/2 lanes wide 
at some points)? And would we see well enough out of those black tinted 
windows? 
</P>
<P>
We decided to take our chances. At 9 a.m. on the appointed day the limo showed 
up at our Pebble Beach hotel. Gerosolimo, the driver, was a dapper man with 
sideburns, tinted Italian sunglasses and a black suit. 
</P>
<P>
"You're in good hands," he said as we sank into the red velvet interior. 
"Relax." That didn't seem difficult. We had a bar, TV set, tape player, enough 
space for half of the Lakers basketball team and our own cellular phone (though 
this last amenity, our driver informed us, was useless in the mountainous 
terrain). 
</P>
<P>
The big car rolled toward Carmel and California 1 South. Gerosolimo had come to 
Monterey two years earlier after working in the restaurant and nightclub 
business in Brooklyn. He works mostly weddings and airport hops, transporting 
the likes of Bruce Willis and John Travolta to tony area resorts. 
</P>
<P>
Gerosolimo told us that driving Big Sur reminds him of the coast near Naples in 
his native Italy. He does about two tours a month, mostly for phobic types such 
as ourselves. Some passengers have been so scared, he said, that "I had to stop 
so they could get out." 
</P>
<P>
While unafraid himself, he can understand such reactions. The area's most 
famous landmark, Bixby Bridge, is so high and narrow that "sometimes cars shake 
in the wind." Hearing this, my mother gasped. 
</P>
<P>
On the way through Carmel we passed the Carmel Mission, established by Father 
Serra in the 18th Century. On Ocean Avenue we admired the upscale eccentric 
designs of the street's ocean-front bungalows. Gerosolimo told us that one of 
them belonged to Hugh Hefner, who stays there "maybe one or twice a year." 
</P>
<P>
On the outskirts of town, we picked up California 1. Gerosolimo pointed out a 
compound where he thought Kim Novak lives. Farther down was a sloping spread 
with a corral in front, said to be owned by Merv Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
The houses thinned out. We started to climb. My viewing worries were quickly 
assuaged. Our vision was actually enhanced by the dark windows, which 
eliminated glare like a good pair of sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
Finally we passed over the dreaded Bixby Bridge. The scenery was spectacular. 
My mother was in awe. I moved around our oversize seating space for various 
viewing angles. 
</P>
<P>
Then something occurred to me: The ride had not been that scary. Not scary at 
all. Exhilarated, I announced that I might drive it myself next time. My mother 
rolled her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
We arrived at our destination, Nepenthe, the famous cliff-hanging restaurant 
that evolved from Orson Welles' forest hideaway. Out on its deck we had a 
late-morning snack of homemade pie, gazing down through the mist into the surf. 
The air was fragrant with eucalyptus. We were relaxed and cool. 
</P>
<P>
By the time we returned to the car to leave, my limo anxieties had dissipated 
with the mist. As it turned out, we'd hardly gotten stares from low-key types, 
in part because there were so few around. I noticed only one man nearby, an 
Arlo Guthrie look-alike who seemed completely oblivious. He drove off in a red 
Jaguar. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Several limousine and van services on the Monterey Peninsula offer Big Sur 
day-trips. 
</P>
<P>
The going rate is about $50 an hour plus a 15% gratuity for a minimum 
three-hour trip. The white, late-model stretch seems to be the vehicle of 
choice for most companies. 
</P>
<P>
Dino Gerosolimo, the proprietor of Monterey Limousine Service, is at 237 Laine 
St., Monterey, Calif. 93940, (408) 646-9635. The best time to call is early 
morning or late afternoon. Other limo services include: Bungay's Celebrity 
Limousine, (408) 624-1407; Your Maitre'D, (408) 624-1717, and A-One Chartered 
Limousine Service Inc., (408) 649-1425. 
</P>
<P>
A lower-cost option is the van tour. Steinbeck Country Tours, (408) 625-5107, 
offers 4- and 4 1/2-hour Big Sur trips for $25 per person. The catch is that at 
least three people have to be signed up for the tour to take place. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the weather and the driver, picture-taking stops may include 
Hurricane Point, Bixby Creek Bridge, Point Lobos and Pfeiffer Beach, with lunch 
at Ventana or Nepenthe restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Private van rentals are $40 an hour, with a three-hour minimum. The company 
generally uses airport-style vans. For larger groups, mini-buses are available 
at $50 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
A second van service is Otter-mobile Tours and Charters, (408) 625-9782. They 
offer a similar four-hour Big Sur Tour for $25. The trip includes a walking 
tour of Point Lobos, with photo stops at Coast Gallery, the Redwood Forest and 
other locations. Private van rental costs $35 an hour for a minimum of four 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Those preferring a cozier mode of transport might consider area taxi services 
such as Joe's Taxi at 8th and Mission, (408) 624-3885. 
</P>
<P>

Business Assn. at (408) 624-2522, or the Monterey Chamber of Commerce at (408)

YOUTH BEAT: SWITZERLAND HOSTELS ARE SKI OPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON, Izon is a Canadian travel journalist covering youth budget 
routes.

<TEXT>
<P>
St. Moritz, Zermatt, Klosters. Thinking of these Swiss winter resorts conjures 
up images of the international jet set spending outrageous amounts of money. 
</P>
<P>
That may be true, but it doesn't mean that these, and other Swiss resort areas, 
are out of reach for budget travelers visiting Europe this winter. 
</P>
<P>
The Swiss Youth Hostel Federation has 87 properties, many near ski slopes, and 
most offer dormitory lodging for under 17 Swiss francs (about $11 U.S.) a 
night. Many of the resort-area hostels serve both breakfast and dinner. And if 
you really want to keep your costs down, there are kitchens in which you can 
prepare your own meals. 
</P>
<P>
You can use the hostels for a single night if you want, but if you plan to stop 
for at least a week you may want to contact Jugi Tours, the travel company of 
the SYHF, before you leave home. Jugi Tours offers economical packages for the 
independent traveler that include hostel accommodations, breakfast and dinner 
plus a ski pass. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to join other visitors your own age, you can sign up for special 
ski camp weeks designed for international travelers ages 16 to 27. Ski camps 
include accommodations, breakfast, dinner, the services of a guide and a ski 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
If you have to rent ski equipment, the weekly fee for skis, poles and boots is 
about 150 Swiss francs ($98 U.S.). 
</P>
<P>
World-famous St. Moritz has 236 miles of ski slopes, 93 miles of cross-country 
trails, the oldest bobsled run in the world and a 190-bed youth hostel. 
One-week packages for independent travelers are 455 francs; two-week packages 
go for 785 francs. With lessons it's 635 francs for one week and 1,140 francs 
for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Car-free Zermatt, where eight of the 18 ski lifts stay open all year, has a 
138-bed hostel. One-week hostel packages are 485 francs, two weeks is 880 
francs. Ski camps will be held Feb. 3-10 and March 31 to April 7, for 545 
francs. 
</P>
<P>
Klosters is a typical mountain village with a not-so-typical clientele. It's a 
favorite of the famous, having been a vacation spot for Prince Charles and 
Diana. Ski camps will be held Dec. 26 to Jan. 2 and Feb. 3-10, for 445 francs. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere in Central Europe do glaciers extend as far into a valley as they do at 
Grindelwald. From the cozy common room of the 132-bed hostel you can enjoy the 
fireplace and breathtaking view across the valley. 
</P>
<P>
Grindelwald has 80 miles of ski runs and 20 miles of cross-country trails. 
One-week packages are 410 francs, two weeks is 710 francs. Lessons are 
available. Ski camps will be held Dec. 26 to Jan. 2 and Feb. 10-17. The price 
is 465 francs. 
</P>
<P>
Arosa is a small mountain village with skating, snowboarding, tobogganing, 45 
miles of downhill ski runs, 20 miles of cross-country ski trails and a 180-bed 
youth hostel. Independent packages for one week are 415 francs; two weeks is 
730 francs. Lessons are available. Ski camps will operate Dec. 30 to Jan. 6, 
and Feb. 10-17, for 470 francs. 
</P>
<P>
Braunwald is a terraced, car-free resort that can only be reached on foot or by 
using a funicular railway. It's a 30-minute walk from the funicular to the 
90-bed hostel. Sleigh taxis are available. If you find that extra expense 
frustrating, at least there, when you buy a hostel package, you get a bonus -- 
lunches are included. Ski camps will operate Dec. 26 to Jan. 2, and Jan. 27 to 
Feb. 3, for 485 francs. 
</P>
<P>
Cross-country skiers should keep in mind that there is also a hostel at Maloja, 
which has 97 miles of touring trails and is the starting point of the Engadine 
Marathon, a major cross-country ski event held every March that draws as many 
as 10,000 participants. 
</P>
<P>
For more information on any of the packages, contact Jugi Tours, Neufeldstrasse 
9, 3012 Bern, Switzerland.

CRUISE VIEWS: ALL AT SEA ON THE MEXICAN RIVIERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH, Slater and Basch are Los Angeles free-lance 
writers.

<TEXT>
<P>
Cruise veterans can expect a deja vu season on the Mexican Riviera this winter, 
with one familiar ship sporting a major face lift, another carrying a different 
name and a big, bright ship coming in to replace its medium-size sister. 
</P>
<P>
Princess' newly refurbished Fair Princess, the former Fairsea, kicked off its 
winter Mexican Riviera season from the Port of Los Angeles in early October, 
and is set to sail every Saturday through May 5 to Mazatlan, Puerto Vallarta 
and Cabo San Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
Fares begin at $1,095 per person, double occupancy, including round-trip air 
fare. Passengers not needing air fare can deduct a travel allowance. Princess 
has lowered its Mexican Riviera cruise prices for 1990 across the board, by 
$170 to $325 per person. 
</P>
<P>
Biggest new features include an upgraded and expanded stage area in the 
remodeled showroom, with the latest in sound and lighting systems. Live 
satellite TV has also been installed to present televised sports events on 
board. There are also new shops, plus new carpeting and upholstery and improved 
service areas in the dining rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Caribbean Cruise Line makes its debut in the Los Angeles area this winter 
with an already-familiar vessel, Admiral Cruises' Stardancer, which will be 
transformed in early January into the Viking Serenade. Both companies are owned 
by Royal Admiral Cruises. 
</P>
<P>
The transfer will be made at the conclusion of the Stardancer's Jan. 6 sailing 
to Mexico, when the ship will go into drydock for two weeks. Its car-carrying 
capabilities will not be marketed by RCCL, and eventually the car deck will be 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Seven-night cruises to the Mexican Riviera begin Jan. 27, calling at the same 
ports as the Stardancer did -- Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlan and Cabo San Lucas. 
Prices begin at $995 per person, double occupancy, including round-trip air 
fare. Passengers who don't use the air program will receive a $250 travel 
allowance instead. 
</P>
<P>
Carnival's 1,022-passenger Tropicale, based in Los Angeles since its debut in 
1982 (except for two brief Alaska summers), will reposition to the East Coast 
after its Dec. 31 New Year's cruise to Mexico. It will be replaced April 8 with 
the bigger, newer Jubilee, which came into service in 1986 and carries as many 
as 1,850 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Prices and ports of call will be the same, with seven-day sailings that include 
round-trip air fare costing from $995 to $2,295 per person, double occupancy, 
and calling at Mazatlan, Puerto Vallarta and Cabo San Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Cruise Line's Crown Odyssey will make two nine-day round-trip sailings 
from Los Angeles Jan. 18 and 27. The nine-day cruises call at Puerto Vallarta, 
Zihuatanejo, Acapulco and Cabo San Lucas, with four full days at sea to enjoy 
the ship and its activities. 
</P>
<P>
Prices begin at $1,998 per person, double occupancy, for a fairly spacious 
inside double cabin (154 to 162 square feet) with two lower beds and bath with 
shower. Passengers not using the add-on air fares can deduct $100 from the 
cruise fare. 
</P>
<P>
The 212-passenger Seabourn Pride, from San Francisco-based Seabourn Cruise 
Line, sails from Acapulco to Los Angeles Nov. 28 on a seven-day voyage priced 
from $3,725 per person, double occupancy. You can expect top-of-the-line food 
and service on this new suites-only vessel. 
</P>
<P>
Other seven-day sailings between Los Angeles and Acapulco are scheduled through 
Feb. 13; 14-day round-trip cruises from Los Angeles are priced from $6,700 per 
person, double occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
Princess' Island Princess will make a series of 10-day sailings round trip from 
Los Angeles that call at Acapulco, Mazatlan, Puerto Vallarta and Cabo San 
Lucas, as well as a seven-day Christmas cruise that departs Dec. 22 but does 
not visit Acapulco. Prices begin at $1,645 per person, double occupancy, 
including air fare, for the 10-day cruises and $1,545 for the Christmas cruise. 
</P>
<P>
And from San Diego, Bermuda Star Line's 713-passenger Bermuda Star departs 
Saturdays between Nov. 11 and April 14 on seven-day round-trip Mexico cruises 
calling at -- you guessed it -- Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlan and Cabo San Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
Economy inside cabins begin as low as $895 per person, double occupancy, 
including round-trip air fare or a $200 travel-allowance deduction. But unless 
you're really economizing, you might prefer the mid-price cabins on this 
vessel. Outside cabins cost from $1,095 per person, double occupancy, with $200 
off that if you don't need the air fare. 
</P>
<P>
Princess' Island Princess, the Seabourn Pride and the Crown Odyssey Cruise Line 
also call at Zihuatanejo/Ixtapa. But what the Mexican Riviera really needs are 
more new ports of call that can handle large ships and offer shore excursions. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller expedition and shallow-draft vessels are introducing some different 
ports, including the new resort development of Huatulco (Windstar Sail Cruises' 
Wind Spirit on a repositioning voyage from Alaska to Barbados, Sept. 23, 1990), 
and the charming fishing and surfing village of Puerto Escondido (Special 
Expeditions' Sea Lion on a sailing from Costa Rica to Manzanillo, departing 
Dec. 27).

THE TIMES SHOPPER: YOU CAN CAPTURE YOUR OWN LAS VEGAS BANDITS 
</P>

<BYLINE>

LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All the glitter and gaming and glamour in this neon city quicken the heartbeat 
and excite the senses. That's what Las Vegas is known for, and no other city so 
captures its essence in its offering of collectibles and souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
You can take home some Las Vegas excitement with an unusual selection of 
memorabilia or kitsch, ranging from vintage slot machines to light-up earrings 
or bow ties that flicker like The Strip. 
</P>
<P>
For vintage gaming devices and a glimpse into Las Vegas' colorful history, 
visit A-1 Casino Collectables, 2240 Paradise Road. This is one of the world's 
best sources for own-your-own slot machines and other gaming memorabilia. A-1 
is a division of International Game Technology, a major manufacturer of 
contemporary slots that accepts vintage machines in trade for new ones and 
resells the antiques at the shop. 
</P>
<P>
Usually about 100 machines are for sale on the floor, with more available in 
the warehouse. There are three categories of slots: all-mechanical models date 
from the 1900s, electro-mechanical types were introduced by Bally in the 1970s 
and contemporary computerized video poker players are made by International 
Game Technology. 
</P>
<P>
Prospective buyers are allowed to try out the various vintage machines, using 
the company's pennies or 5, 10 or 25-cent coins, or dollar tokens, which are 
presented in small cups that look like miniature versions of coin containers 
used in the casinos. As with any Vegas grub stake, all borrowed coins must be 
returned -- along with any winnings -- to the company cash register. 
</P>
<P>
A-1, which opened in 1987, is as much a museum as it is a shop. One of the 
advantages of a visit is learning more about the history of gaming and the 
workings of the slot machines. In decoration and themes the machines reflect 
events and conditions, and their technology is typical for the years when the 
machines were made. 
</P>
<P>
For example, machines made during the 1930s reflect Depression-era conditions 
and values. Penny and nickel machines were prevalent, and enticed players with 
the promise of a fistful of coins prominently displayed behind glass reinforced 
with chicken wire. 
</P>
<P>
A 1935 Watling slot machine ($3,295) is semi-disguised as a gum ball machine. 
Put a penny in the slot and collect a wad of gum, before pulling the handle for 
your chance to win the jackpot. During the Depression 10 or 20 pennies were 
preferable to one, and this gum ball machine was particularly popular with 
people who would otherwise shun gaming. 
</P>
<P>
The notorious one-armed bandit exists in an Old Reno Aristocrat slot machine 
that is encased in a larger-than-life-size, hand-carved wooden cowboy. The 
figure stands six feet tall. This "bandit" has two arms -- one functions as the 
machine's lever, the other is stationary, with the hand resting on the cowboy's 
gun holster. It was made in 1949, takes a quarter and pays 20 quarters for 
straight bars. 
</P>
<P>
A Mills Little Perfection ($1,295) dating from the 1920s takes nickels, but 
offers no monetary payback. Instead, this slot, which sat in a saloon and was 
known as a trade stimulator, promised each winner a drink on the house. 
</P>
<P>
A-1's selection of fully mechanical slot machines sell for between $2,000 and 
$5,000, on average. Bally's electro-mechanical slots, introduced during the 
1970s, usually cost less than $1,000. In addition to greater ease in pulling 
the machine's arm or handle, the Bally slot features a large interior hopper 
that automatically counts out winnings and ceremoniously pays out coins with 
clanking sounds and flashing lights. 
</P>
<P>
The newer computerized video slots sell for about $2,000. These mesmerizing 
machines deal poker hands and offer you one chance, by pushing buttons, to 
change your cards and beat the house. 
</P>
<P>
One computerized video slot is called Gold Fever. It features a video miner 
digging for buried treasure. You choose the chamber he digs into and lead him 
to discover a pot of gold, a dragon or a devil. The graphics are terrific, but 
it's unlikely that you'll encounter this slot in many Vegas casinos, where game 
masters think that Gold Fever takes patrons too long to play. 
</P>
<P>
A-1 also sells tables for blackjack and other games as well as books about 
gaming and slots, manuals for fixing slots, antique dice and a wide variety of 
cards and chips.

Each of the states has its own laws regulating ownership and use of slot 
machines. California, for example, allows residents to own slots predating 
1956. New York allows slots predating 1941. In Nevada and Arizona, all slots 
are legal. A-1's personnel are knowledgeable about these laws and will help you 
to buy a machine that's allowable in your state. The company ships everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
If your budget doesn't allow for high rolling on antique slots for souvenirs, 
cheaper facsimile machines as well as toy slots and specialty slots are sold at 
A-1 and throughout town. A good source is the gift shop at Caesars Palace, 
which offers about five varieties of inexpensive slots for between $30 and $80. 
Some of these accept and pay money, others simply spin wheels and make sounds 
or flash when three bars appear. 
</P>
<P>
Blackjack and other gaming tables that have been converted into coffee tables 
(from about $2,000) or home bars (from about $2,400) are sold at Bally's gift 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
If you've exhausted your impulse for gaming, you can still take home some of 
Las Vegas' pizazz and sparkle in the form of inexpensive light-up objects that 
are completely in keeping with Glitter Gulch and The Strip. 
</P>
<P>
A large selection of sunglasses ($20 for adult sizes, $15 for kids' sizes), 
visors ($10.50), earrings (in many styles and colors, $20 to $30), headbands 
($10.50), bow ties (in red or black satin, $10.50), masks ($10.50) and yo-yos 
($6.50) that blink perpetually with tiny red, blue, yellow and/or green lights, 
are sold by the candy and cigarette girls that circulate through the casinos 
and cabarets. 
</P>
<P>
There are also sweat shirts (about $50) featuring flickering Las Vegas 
marquees, plus dice, cats and cactus plants. The lights are controlled by tiny 
insulated batteries, and are perfectly safe and even washable. Marshall Rousso 
shops, at Caesars Palace and in several other hotel arcades, has a good 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
Light-up sweat shirts in children's sizes (about $50) show spooky monsterlike 
creatures, cats or other animals with glowing eyes, and are available in the 
Toy Store, with branches at Caesars Palace and other hotel arcades. 
</P>
<P>
If flashing lights on wearables seem to you to be tasteless rather than 
amusing, local chocolatier Ethel M's souvenir selection, called "A Taste of Las 
Vegas" ($30 for two pounds), might better suit your appetite. The selection of 
liquor-filled chocolates, plus coconuts, caramels, pecan patties, nuts, almond 
butter crunch and other delectables is cleverly packaged so that a double strip 
of individually wrapped candies, in brightly colored pieces of foil, winds 
across the box that's otherwise filled with dark and milk chocolates. It is 
very pretty and looks very much like a nighttime overview of The Strip. 
</P>
<P>
"A Taste of Las Vegas" is sold at a dozen Ethel M shops in hotels (Flamingo 
Hilton, Stardust, Holiday Inn, Tropicana and others) and throughout Las Vegas, 
but the factory outlet (on Sunset Road, just east of Green Valley on the 
outskirts of Las Vegas; call 702-458-8864 for exact directions) offers free 
samples, as well as a tour that shows how chocolates are made.

HER WORLD: DISCOVERING BEAUTY IN NORWAY'S FIORD COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JUDITH MORGAN, Morgan, author of California (with photographer Dewitt 
Jones), is a La Jolla travel writer.

<P>
There was as much sun in Lillesand that afternoon as there had been rain in 
Bergen the day before. It splashed in gold on the town's grassy square, a block 
from the tiny harbor on Norway's southern coast. 
</P>
<P>
Baby strollers were parked near a glinting pretzel-and-crown sign at Knudsen's 
bakery, while young mothers and their toddlers trooped inside. Crimson roses 
climbed over bright picket fences and around lamp posts. 
</P>
<P>
The hammers of restoration crews tapped in the air in this proud town of white 
frame houses, which is a summer favorite of city folks from Oslo. Even Norway's 
popular monarch, King Olav V, could not resist signing his name to a rock when 
he sailed his yacht in these waters. His royal graffito is the only such 
scribbling allowed in tiny Lillesand. 
</P>
<P>
Lillesand was not on our cruise itinerary, which clearly said "Day At Sea." It 
came as a sunny surprise, a makeup game for a rain-slogged stop in Bergen. Such 
improvisations are possible on smaller new cruise ships such as the Seabourn 
Pride, the Sea Goddess or the Wind Song. Such flexibility is welcomed by a new 
breed of traveler who does not believe that comfort and adventure are 
necessarily incompatible. 
</P>
<P>
Our captain was Daniel Danielsen, a son of Lillesand who came out of retirement 
after a career with Royal Viking Line to launch the Seabourn fleet. His voice 
had boomed over the public address system that morning, inviting us to follow 
him home. 
</P>
<P>
When we tied up at 2 p.m. his wife was at the pier, as were his daughter and 
grandsons. Several of the captain's lifelong buddies joined in the welcome and 
lingered by the pier, swapping yarns. 
</P>
<P>
As the town became our park for the day, so our ship became a local diversion. 
Towheaded boys hung by their knees from the thick ropes that linked vessel to 
shore. Children crowded by the gangway to wave and chatter for the visitors' 
video cameras. Teen-agers on bicycles wheeled down the hill simply to stare at 
the streamlined ship, which would soon head south for the winter. 
</P>
<P>
After admiring watercolors in an art gallery and ship models in the museum, I 
boarded a tender for a tour of the archipelago. Handsome cottages were tucked 
into forests of spruce and fir. Steep wooden ladders zigzagged up from the 
shore. 
</P>
<P>
"Summer homes?" inquired an American. 
</P>
<P>
"All are homes," responded the earnest Norwegian boatman. 
</P>
<P>
The deep woods and rock-bound shores reminded me of Mt. Desert Island in Maine, 
another enclave of timbered retreats that is ringed by bobbing masts. Lillesand 
has the same sense of tradition. It was a hard port to leave. 
</P>
<P>
But from stem to stern -- about as far as from Maine to Florida -- Norway is 
seafaring country. Its Western fiords and sheltered waterways offer spectacular 
scenery and sailing. An armada of flat-rock islands called skerries forms a 
barrier against the wrath of the open sea. The Gulf Stream rules out ice. 
</P>
<P>
Sognefiord is the largest and longest of the fingers of water, probing 125 
miles inland to the hamlet of Flaam, with its cozy Fretheim Hotel. 
Geirangerfiord is reputedly the most beautiful, although the competition is so 
rigorous that I refuse to take a stand. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite fiords may be the snug ones, such as the enchanting Trollfiord in 
the snowcapped Lofoten Islands north of the Arctic Circle. 
</P>
<P>
A call in the Trollfiord is never guaranteed. It is a bonus of late light and 
calm winds. Your vessel cannot be too wide or long. Your captain cannot be too 
skittish. 
</P>
<P>
I first sailed into that slip of deep water a dozen years ago aboard a 
Norwegian coastal steamer. Those sturdy ships sail every day, all year, from 
Bergen on the 2,500-mile round trip north to Kirkenes on the Russian border. 
</P>
<P>
The coastal steamer is the Greyhound bus of Norway, stopping by night and day 
to deliver mail, furniture and people, caskets, prams and food. It is the only 
link for many far-flung villages. 
</P>
<P>
There is a vast difference in price and amenities between the mail boat and 
most cruise ships. 
</P>
<P>
On the mail boat Polarlys my cabin had narrow bunks and a single porthole with 
a heavy curtain to blot out the midnight sun. The bath was at the end of the 
hall. On the Seabourn Pride all cabins are suites and all windows are five feet 
wide. 
</P>
<P>
But this much they have in common: Norwegian spunk and heritage, and enough 
maneuverability to sail into Trollfiord in the full of a moon and silently turn 
on a kroner. 
</P>
<P>
It is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that I have been blessed to have twice.

FISHING RIGHTS AND WRONGS: CONGRESS MUST CATCH AN OVER-EFFICIENT INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By William McCloskey, William McCloskey, who has worked as a fisherman, is the 
author of Highliners, a novel about commercial fishing (McGraw-Hill) and the 
coming Fish Decks (Paragon), on North Atlantic fishermen.

<TEXT>
<P>
In April, 1976, the United States passed a controversial law claiming 
jurisdiction over all marine harvests within 200 miles of its coasts. By the 
time the law took effect a year later, Canada, Mexico and a host of other 
coastal nations had followed the U.S. lead in declaring their own 200-mile 
fishery jurisdictions. The actions altered forever -- or at least for the 
current generation -- the rules of a coastal nation's rights to resources 
within its contiguous waters. 
</P>
<P>
In 12 years the 200-mile fishing act has changed the U.S. fishing scene beyond 
recognition -- for good and, some say, bad. 
</P>
<P>
Congress must now reauthorize the 1976 act. No one doubts that this will occur, 
but the changes deemed necessary have led to hot lobbying within the fishing 
industry. During the next weeks appropriate committees of Congress -- Merchant 
Marine in the House and Commerce in the Senate -- will carry multiple 
amendments to the floors of both bodies. Too many interests are involved to 
expect easy passage. 
</P>
<P>
Last March an incident drove home the need for new rules. A fleet of large, 
Seattle-based U.S. fishing ships that process their catch on board was headed 
to the great Alaskan fishing grounds in the Bering Sea, more than 2,000 miles 
away. They stopped about halfway off Kodiak, Alaska, to gather some extra fish. 
For two weeks, deck crews gleefully filled their nets to bursting while teams 
below processed the catch. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, with a dogged efficiency that free-enterprise Americans might 
have admired in another activity, the ships scooped up Kodiak's entire annual 
quota of pollock -- a fish harvested in large quantities for paste, filets and 
meal. This left the remote island's shore plants without the pollock they 
needed to remain in full operation for the rest of the year, and left smaller 
Kodiak fishing boats without the fish projected for their nets throughout the 
autumn. It meant the loss of 2,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The big Seattle ships then compounded the outrage. They stripped the females of 
their roe -- for which the Japanese pay inflated prices -- and dumped 
carcasses, from which they harvested nothing, over the side. The greedy action 
not only wasted 60,000 tons of fish that shore plants could have converted to 
food and meal, but it covered the sea floor with rotting fish that plugged the 
nets of local fishermen trying for other species after the outsiders had gone. 
</P>
<P>
The American processor-trawler fleet of about 50 ships barely existed six years 
ago. Their numbers now grow with success, and the fleet has become 
overcapitalized. Worse, about 50 more large trawler-processor ships are under 
construction, waiting to compete in a year or two. Yet the existing fleet must 
already catch more fish than scientists deem safe for conservation of the 
stocks, in order to meet huge payrolls and boat mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
None of this could have happened in U.S. fishing 15 years ago, when virtually 
all U.S. and Canadian fishermen on the east and west coasts of North America 
were being wiped out by foreign fishing fleets. Back then several countries, 
led by Japan and the Soviet Union, had taken advantage of high-seas freedom to 
send fleets of efficient large catcher-processor ships to the prime fishing 
coasts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
In waters off the United States, such ships -- dwarfing the boats and gear of 
local fishermen -- scraped the grounds within sight of shore, from Gloucester 
and Long Island to Fort Bragg, Coos Bay and Kodiak. Canadians saw similar 
exploitation. American inshore fishermen, many of whom followed in the steps of 
fathers and grandfathers, turned into a dying breed. Worse, to pragmatic 
politicians, none of the foreign catch contributed a nickel to the domestic 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
Then in 1976 Congress passed the Fishery Conservation and Management Act, since 
named the Magnuson Act after its chief sponsor, the late Sen. Warren Magnuson 
(D-Wash.). The act provides that U.S. fishermen can harvest all the sea 
creatures of the U.S. 200-mile waters, within scientifically established 
quotas, that they prove able to catch. These areas off the United States 
coasts, with their richly productive continental shelves, happen to contain 
approximately 20% of the world's entire natural seafood supply. 
</P>
<P>
During the early years of the Magnuson Act, foreign nations were able to catch 
negotiated quotas of American fish. In the past two years the foreign quotas 
have been drawn down, virtually to zero as Americans have proved able to do all 
the catching and processing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
No one in the fishing business really expected that to happen so fast. But the 
new American taste for fish as a healthy protein alternative to beef, combined 
with high world prices for fish (particularly Japanese yen prices) and ready 
foreign capital to augment dollars (particularly from Japan and Norway) have 
made fishing attractive to the bold and the ambitious as well as to those 
Americans who have always wanted to fish for a living. Suddenly there are no 
longer enough fish to go around, even among Americans. 
</P>
<P>
By Oct. 1, 1989, Congress was supposed to have reauthorized the Magnuson Act. 
But this self-imposed deadline -- the start of the new fiscal year -- is going 
to be missed by several weeks, perhaps months, as more than 60 proposed changes 
run the gauntlet. Among the plethora of amendments that the House Merchant 
Marine and Fisheries Committee reported out on Oct. 5 are provisions to improve 
the effectiveness of enforcement, to make certain any foreign allocations will 
benefit U.S. interests, to speed passage through the bureaucracy of emergency 
actions -- and, through international pressure, to curb the use of miles-long 
gill nets on the high seas. One amendment affecting fishermen on both coasts 
would place tuna, a migratory species hitherto exempted from management under 
the act, under the same controls as more stationary species. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the amendments center around conservation, which opens a conflict 
between two prime tenets of the original act: to develop an American fishing 
industry from the great resource available, and to conserve the resource for 
the benefit of the nation. Ironically, despite the word "conservation" in the 
name of the act, the provisions for development have been the ones employed 
most effectively. 
</P>
<P>
Most responsible people in the fishing industry now declare that conservation 
should receive the highest priority under the Magnuson Act. Yet they do not 
necessarily agree on who should do the conserving. As a congressional staff 
person noted: "One man's conservation is another man's allocation." 
</P>
<P>
The roe-stripping incident off Alaska last spring was bad enough, but the 
pressures that big boats feel to generate income on investment appear to be 
growing worse. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Fuchs, mayor of Dutch Harbor (the Alaskan seaport closest to the Bering 
Sea fishing grounds), has had ample opportunity to observe what is happening. 
The big U.S. ships catch vastly more than their quotas, Fuchs says, and get 
away with it because nobody is there to watch them. They work grounds 
unnecessarily where their nets take great quantities of such by-catch as crab 
and halibut -- which by law they cannot keep -- as well as fish too small for 
the processing machinery. 
</P>
<P>
A volunteer witness at a recent fishery council meeting in Anchorage supported 
Fuchs' contention. The man, who testified that he had worked as a crewmen on 
one of the ships, said he saw more fish wasted, thrown back dead, than he saw 
processed. Fuchs termed it "rape and piracy," a haunting reminder of the 
accusations leveled 15 years ago against foreign fleets. 
</P>
<P>
The only solution to such overfishing appears to be an expensive, on-board 
observer program. 
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Japan last fall, I heard an impassioned five-hour lecture on 
wasteful American overfishing from the owners of a Japanese fishing company 
forced to retrench after the loss of U.S. quotas off Alaska. Shun-Ichi Kanai, 
president of Kanai Fisheries Co. Ltd., a thin, bald man in his 70s, spoke 
emotionally as he leaned across the conference table, although the 
interpreter's translation smoothed the words: 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to express you're overdoing it. Since you're a free country, even 
a barber can take as many fish as he wants. But the American resource belongs 
in a big term to the world." Ironic words from the people Americans once felt 
were destroying the fish resources of the nation, whose actions helped 
precipitate the Magnuson Act. 
</P>
<P>
For American fishermen, in fact, the very success of the Magnuson Act has 
shifted the problem from one based on deprivation to one based on opportunity.

CALIFORNIA: WHERE BLACK POLITICS BEGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The biggest elections news next month will be whether Manhattan Borough 
President David N. Dinkins becomes the first black mayor of New York City and 
whether Lt. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder becomes the first black governor of Virginia 
-- or any other state. 
</P>
<P>
The underlying question in both contests: Can a black candidate be elected in a 
constituency where blacks are a relatively small minority? While the outcomes 
of the November races are still too close to call, Californians may be 
especially interested in the results, having already answered the question. 
Although blacks made up less than 15% of Los Angeles, Tom Bradley was elected 
mayor in 1973, 16 years before Dinkins was nominated in New York, where black 
people are 25% of the city's population. Current Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally 
(D-Compton) became the first black person elected lieutenant governor of 
California in 1975, 10 years before Wilder won the same position in Virginia. 
Then in 1982, when the black population of California was proportionately much 
smaller than the black population of Virginia is today (about 19%), Bradley ran 
for governor and lost by a hairbreadth margin. 
</P>
<P>
California's brand of black politics has led the nation in other ways. Willie 
Brown (D-San Francisco) was elected Speaker of the State Assembly nine years 
before Washington's Ron Brown was elected chairman of the Democratic National 
Committee. State Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) was elected chair 
of the Democratic Caucus four years before Rep. William H. Gray III (D-Pa.) was 
elected chairman of the Congressional Democratic Caucus. In 1986, Waters wrote 
a law, vetoed by Gov. George Deukmejian, requiring state fund managers to 
divest stocks of companies doing business in South Africa. That was the same 
year black congressmen finally rammed through apartheid sanctions over 
President Reagan's veto. 
</P>
<P>
If the old axiom, "As Maine goes so goes the nation," is true of presidential 
elections, the paraphrase -- as California goes, so goes the nation -- is true 
in black politics. California has set the agenda for important issues and 
developments in black politics across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Geography and demography help explain California's exemplary position. Because 
most of state's black population did not arrive until after World War II, 
California had no long history of legal segregation. The West didn't experience 
the freedom rides or anything like the Montgomery bus boycott of 1955. 
California's three largest cities do not have black majorities, unlike 
Georgia's Atlanta, Michigan's Detroit or New Jersey's Newark. So in the early 
'70s, California did not experience a period when black people were first 
assuming political control in the biggest cities of a state. 
</P>
<P>
In 1962, however, voters in Watts elected Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles) 
-- one of only five predominantly black congressional districts in the entire 
nation then represented by a black member of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Major precedents for black politics were set in 1970, when Berkeley elected 
Rep. Ron Dellums, the first black Democrat to win in a district where whites 
were in the majority. It would be 12 more years before another black candidate, 
Katie Hall of Indiana, won such a position -- and only for one term. 
</P>
<P>
The importance of the California experience has implications for the future. In 
the next decade, the tests will not be what black people can accomplish within 
their own communities, but what they can accomplish in coalition with other 
interest groups. Other than improving the numbers of registered voters and 
turnout, blacks have already mined the prospects within majority-black areas. 
</P>
<P>
Excepting New Orleans, every congressional district with a black majority now 
has a black member of Congress. And, according to the Joint Center for 
Political Studies, the leading black think tank, every black-majority city with 
a population of more 200,000 people has a black mayor. Future growth of black 
political power then depends on what blacks can accomplish in coalition with 
whites, women, unions, business groups, political parties and other minorities. 
The key is coalition-building and that is where black people in California have 
had some truly remarkable successes. 
</P>
<P>
With four black members of Congress, California and New York have the largest 
black delegations in the House, yet New York has more black citizens than 
California. Perhaps more important, all New York black congressmen are from 
districts where blacks make up no less than 47% of the voting-age population. 
Only one black congressman from California, Hawkins, comes from a heavily black 
area; Democrat Julian C. Dixon's district, Culver City, is less than 40% black. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of one Missouri district, represented by Democrat Alan 
Wheat, only in California have black candidates been elected to Congress with 
so few black votes available -- and survived for more than one term. 
</P>
<P>
Turning the perspective around, California is where people who aren't black are 
most likely to support a black candidate. A combination of political and 
psychological factors make the Golden State a fertile ground for black 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
"In California, black elected officials can act as honest brokers between other 
ethnic groups, which is a situation where race is not as important as consensus 
building" said California native Jeffrey Stewart, now a history professor at 
George Mason University. "This is particularly true vis-a-vis blacks and 
Mexicans or Asian-Americans, who are not as well organized yet." 
</P>
<P>
John Smith, who has worked with Hawkins for more than 25 years, agrees that 
organization has been critical in building black clout. "The fact that black 
people are such a small group in California helps make them more cohesive and 
focused, with clear objectives. None of this came easily. I was living in 
Pasadena when Tom Bradley first ran in 1969. Nearly every black person I knew 
in my neighborhood . . . was stuffing envelopes or putting stamps on mailers." 
</P>
<P>
However Bradley's current problems are resolved, one reason for his past 
success is that California's population includes the most educated, successful 
black people in America. According to the Joint Center for Political Studies, 
the metropolitan areas of San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco have the 
highest levels of black educational achievement. These are also three of the 
four areas where blacks own the most expensive homes. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to socioeconomic stature, black political success is a reflection 
of an unconventional electorate that could consecutively support such 
dissimilar governors as Ronald Reagan and Edmund G. Brown Jr. According to 
former Rep. Yvonne Burke, "As a whole, California voters are not particularly 
liberal or particularly conservative. What they really are is non-traditional; 
so many of the issues they're involved with, like ecology, don't fall along old 
racial lines." 
</P>
<P>
Dixon points out that California politics are not characterized by machines 
that decide -- or limit -- who runs for office. He agrees that California 
voters are an independent bunch: "After all," Dixon said, "that's how the state 
wound up with a Republican governor and a Democratic lieutenant governor. I'm 
not saying that there are no racial problems in California, but because voters 
are somewhat more open-minded and independent, they are much more willing to go 
past race and look at a black politician as a politician who just happens to be 
black."

Here's a commentary on life in Los Angeles: My neighbor was driving en route to 
Palm Springs when his car developed trouble. He pulled over to the side and 
started walking for help. Several motorists stopped offering help, but being 
wary of strangers my neighbor refused, and continued walking 3 miles to the 
nearest gas station. Life ain't what it used to be!

'SOCIAL' SOLUTION FOR HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I must commend Hartman on his article. We have all heard the statistics 
concerning housing costs, government policies and ultimately about the millions 
of people who end up on the streets, but proposing a solution instead of 
pussyfooting around the issue was a fresh angle that Hartman tackled superbly. 
</P>
<P>
We all must come to the realization that providing the best housing, at the 
best cost for the most people, is going to have to be a nonprofit effort. 
</P>
<P>
Hartman's ideas about a restructured housing system and reallocated government 
expenditures are not unrealistic. Before they can work effectively, however, we 
have to dismount from our high horses and recognize the housing crisis for what 
it is -- an increasingly severe product of a lax system which has been fueled 
by greediness.

'SOCIAL' SOLUTION FOR HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Chester Hartman's column "U.S. Housing Needs 'Social' Solution," 
Op-Ed Page, Oct. 6: 
</P>
<P>
Hartman's "social" solution to the nation's housing problem is exactly that, 
"socialism." 
</P>
<P>
Both he and our local politicians are under the same delusion that somehow more 
welfare and more regulation will result in decent, affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
Excess profits breed competition. That is what built this country, including 
its housing, and gave our people the highest standard of living in the world. 
There were times, before rent control, when landlords competed against each 
other in providing services and amenities, and tenants had their pick of 
affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
It has been said that welfare is like drugs, at first pleasant, then 
habit-forming and ultimately destructive. Welfare robs people of their 
self-respect and gives them a disincentive to find work. 
</P>
<P>
Excessive regulation, especially rent control, has the opposite of its intended 
effect. It discourages investment in new multifamily housing, thereby reducing 
the supply and forcing up rents for everyone. As a result, low-income families 
are outbid for existing housing that would otherwise be within their reach. 
</P>
<P>
The for-profit system has not failed, it is being destroyed by well-meaning 
socialists.

In response to the article "U.S. OKs Covert Operations That May Kill 
Foreigners" (by Robin Wright, Part A, Oct. 14), I was appalled at the 
legislation that would permit the Bush Administration to perform "Clandestine 
operations even if they threaten the lives of foreign figures." Despite the 
fact that the Administration denies that it is a change of policy, it allows 
the government to assassinate any foreign threat and blow it off as an accident 
or just something that happened as a result of an attack. The entire idea is 
ludicrous because it basically gives the Bush Administration the power to kill 
any foreigner who poses a threat to the United States with total disregard to 
the present or future effects that it will have on the country. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the redefining of this order, your article states, is because 
"the Bush Administration has clearly felt cramped by the restrictions during 
its first two foreign policy crisis this year -- the hostage crisis in Lebanon 
and the effort to remove Noriega from power in Panama." I can't believe that 
the government would feel so cramped that it would have to resort to legalizing 
killing in order to make America look better. 
</P>
<P>
Don't get the wrong idea, I am not anti-American by any stretch of the 
imagination, but I am just questioning the morality of the Bush Administration 
to justify something so severe as assassinations to be made legal. When is 
America going to stop playing the role of "policeman of the world" to benefit 
itself rather than looking at the global picture? With the approval of these 
deadly operations, not only would it jeopardize the state of America and its 
foreign policy, but it could cause irreversible damage to the world.

I am amazed and appalled by the U.S. government's claim of worldwide FBI 
jurisdiction. Knowing that there can be no legal basis for such claim in light 
of other nations' sovereignties, our government has refused to reveal the basis 
of its claim. Any self-respecting sovereign state can be expected to oppose 
what any civilized system of law defines as kidnaping within its borders. If 
there can be any doubt about this, imagine what the reaction of the Bush 
government would be were the Soviets to make such a claim for the KGB, their 
equivalent agency. 
</P>
<P>
Along similar lines, efforts to constitutionally repeal First Amendment rights, 
such as the move to amend the Constitution to provide for lese-majeste laws in 
the guise of protecting the honor of the flag, impugn and threaten our 
constitutional framework of liberty. Supporters of such proposals should be 
recognized as enemies of liberty. Those who have collaborated with such enemies 
by enacting obviously unconstitutional statutes of a similar nature have shown 
a profound contempt for our rights and have betrayed their oaths to uphold the 
Constitution.

LBOS OUT ON A LIMB, WITH CYCLICAL BREEZES BLOWING; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETS: THIS MONTH'S PANIC WAS A STRIKE AGAINST A FINANCIAL SECTOR THAT SEEMS 
TO PUSH TOO HARD FOR MORE BORROWING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

American Enterprise Institute in Washington.

<P>
The 1987 stock market crash occurred while the world's central banks were busy 
propping up the dollar, thereby applying tremendous pressure to push up U.S. 
interest rates and cool an overheating economy. 
</P>
<P>
This month's Friday the 13th panic was superficially a muted version of the 
1987 crash, but the fundamentals were very different. 
</P>
<P>
After April, 1988, the Federal Reserve began to withdraw some liquidity from 
the U.S. banking system, resuming its attempt to slow inflation. The Fed's 
effort kept interest rates at a higher level, drawing in billions of dollars of 
capital from abroad. The attraction of U.S. capital markets has become so 
strong that so far in 1989, central banks have spent $50 billion trying to keep 
the dollar from appreciating. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of September, frustrated by what they considered a "too strong" 
dollar, finance ministers of the industrial democracies tried to engineer a 
further drop in the dollar. After two weeks of concerted dollar selling, they 
gave up -- and tried to underscore their determination to weaken the dollar by 
raising interest rates in Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the interesting part that precipitated the 7% stock market plunge on 
Oct. 13. The U.S. stock market has for the past year been driven almost 
exclusively by leveraged buyouts and rumors of leveraged buyouts. A leveraged 
buyout occurs when a group of outside investors offers to buy up the stock of a 
company with money raised by issuing junk bonds. Junk bonds carry high yields 
because they are riskier than government bonds, which yield about two-thirds as 
much. Since the interest on junk bonds is deductible, some companies find it 
attractive to switch from stock or equity financing to debt financing. 
</P>
<P>
The first firms subject to LBOs were not so vulnerable to cyclical forces and 
therefore were better able to bear the risk of a constant need to pay interest 
on high-yield bonds. Typically, companies dealing in food or other staples were 
good candidates. 
</P>
<P>
As the stock market was coming back after the 1987 crash, awash in liquidity 
provided by central banks understandably anxious to avoid a 1929-style debacle, 
the best takeover candidates were snapped up. Lately, takeover managers have 
turned to riskier, cyclical companies like UAL, Resorts International, Hilton, 
the Campeau retailing empire and Ramada Inns. As far as the takeover artists 
were concerned, these companies had a lot of equity on their balance sheets and 
therefore were good targets for leveraged buyouts financed by junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
But by late summer of 1989, things began to change. Signs of a weaker U.S. 
economy began to appear. The Group of Seven's attempts to push down the U.S. 
dollar in the foreign exchange markets eventually resulted in higher interest 
rates in Europe and Japan. Leveraged buyouts began to run into difficulty late 
in September. On Oct. 13, the leveraged buyout deal for UAL was put on hold by 
American and Japanese banks. Stock traders decided to sell some of their 
exposure, a perfectly normal response to difficulties with LBOs. However, late 
on Friday afternoon, no one was willing to buy the shares of UAL, and in the 
ensuing panic the stock market dropped by almost 200 points, or 7%. 
</P>
<P>
The American and Japanese banks, with some coaching from our Federal Reserve 
and Japan's Ministry of Finance, had decided that they did not want to push 
aggressively on a deal that involved a sharp increase in borrowing in a highly 
cyclical industry. Many felt that the U.S. economy was headed for a recession 
or at least sharply lower profits. Further, it turns out that American 
money-center banks now have more exposure to junk bonds than they do to Third 
World debt. Memories of the painful experience with that debt no doubt prompted 
top management in American banks to back away from the UAL deal and other 
similarly shaky leveraged buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
Friday the 13th provided a chilling reminder of the reason why cyclical 
companies don't have much debt on their balance sheets. When the economy slows 
down, they probably won't be able to make interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
The panic was strike two against a financial sector that seems to take its turn 
at bat as an opportunity to push too hard for more borrowing. The LBO wave has 
performed a service by restructuring some balance sheets and keeping management 
on its toes, but for now it is largely over. 
</P>
<P>
We had better hope that, while pulling itself back together, the financial 
sector does not start setting itself up for a third strike by pushing too hard 
for more debt financing. If that happens, we will be headed for a global market 
crash that won't be over until the financial sector of the world gets around to 
reconnecting itself with the real economy.

A major Ethiopian rebel group said it has agreed to open preliminary talks with 
the government. The Tigre People's Liberation Front, which launched a new 
offensive in late August, said the talks will begin in Rome next Saturday and 
be observed by representatives of the Italian government. The Tigrean rebels 
pushed the government out of Tigre province in February. Last week, the 
insurgents claimed to have captured the town of Mekane Selam, 100 miles north 
of the capital of Addis Ababa. The government is also scheduled to resume peace 
talks with another rebel group, the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, next 
month in Nairobi, Kenya.

Italy said it is prepared to take the "consequent decisions" in the case of an 
Italian who was shot and set afire in Libya during anti-Italian protests. The 
government called on Libya to disclose the circumstances of the murder 
Wednesday of Roberto Ceccato, 35. In an interview with Italy's RAI Television, 
Libyan leader Col. Moammar Kadafi said he had not heard about Ceccato's 
slaying, which has shocked Italy and strained relations between the two 
countries. In a further comment that outraged many Italians, Kadafi added: "I 
hope he had life insurance."

A Muslim religious court heard charges of apostasy, or abandonment of religious 
faith, against a women's rights advocate running for Parliament. Islamic 
conservatives prosecuting Toujan Faisal, one of 12 female candidates in next 
month's general election, want the Islamic court in Amman to declare her 
incompetent, dissolve her marriage and give immunity to anyone shedding her 
blood. Faisal, 40, is a former television journalist who aired topics such as 
child abuse and wife beating. Women received the right to vote and run for 
Parliament in 1974, but no woman has run in any of the by-elections held since. 
Next month's election is the first national poll since 1967. The judge set a 
hearing for Nov. 9, one day after the election, to rule on the court's 
competence to deal with the case.

Operators of the voter-closed Rancho Seco nuclear power plant in Sacramento 
were fined $50,000 by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for failing to properly 
train key workers to respond to emergencies. The Sacramento Municipal Utility 
District, which is shutting down the publicly owned plant, said it would pay 
the fine even though the problems have been corrected. The NRC found that 43 of 
the 77 workers belonging to the core of Rancho Seco's emergency response team 
were not properly trained.

has five children and 11 grandchildren, wants to use his winnings to buy a 
house and open a real estate business, said his son, Gilbert. Other winners 
included, Randall Sell of Stockton and James Mullins of Hollister, who each 
received $50,000. William Sager of San Gabriel, Gilda Jones of Los Angeles and 
Elizabeth Fucuals of San Jose each took home $40,000. Guadalupe Cavazos of 
Caruthers won $30,000. The $20,000 winners were Hugo Brescia of Inglewood, 
Robert Miller of McKinleyville, Terry Gartman of Newark and Segundo Llamas of 
Santa Maria. Fred Davis of Oxnard got $10,000. Over the last four years, 2,536 
finalists have won a total of $412.7 million in the game. Reynoso was the 199th 
spinner to win $1 million or more.

Pacific Bell proposed a $135-million rate reduction, which if approved would 
save the average California customer 35 cents a month. The reduction is part of 
a recently approved system that allows Pacific Bell and GTE, the two largest 
phone companies in the state, to have more control over rates. The Public 
Utilities Commission will review the company's application by the end of the 
year.

HE WON'T GIVE UP TILL CRA BACKS DOWN;

GOVERNMENT: WILLIAM TUT HAYES TAKES HIS FIGHT WITH THE COMMUNITY REDEVELOPMENT 
AGENCY PERSONALLY.

<P>
The Community Redevelopment Agency meeting hadn't even begun, and already the 
gadflies were buzzing. 
</P>
<P>
As pinstriped bureaucrats filed into one side of the city agency's downtown 
conference room, graying men and women on the other side cackled over jokes 
about "this rubber-stamp agency," "the Bradley machine" and "gangster boss 
commissioners." 
</P>
<P>
Slow-growth advocates scoured the agenda for fodder for their regular attacks 
on the CRA. A woman from a Hollywood political action committee traded barbs 
about the agency's chief, James Wood, with a man wearing a "CRA Go Away" 
button. 
</P>
<P>
And near a far wall, William Tut Hayes was quietly getting ready to raise hell. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be at every meeting until the CRA gives me what I want," said the 
rail-thin activist, pulling some documents from a portfolio. "I don't plan on 
giving up, which is what they want me to do." 
</P>
<P>
The agency's agitator nonpareil, Hayes, 54, has waged a celebrated four-year 
fight with the CRA over money he insists the agency has owed him since it 
evicted him in 1985 from an apartment in which he was living. The home has 
since been razed to make way for new development. 
</P>
<P>
CRA officials point out that they have doled out nearly $50,000 in storage and 
moving fees and direct payments to Hayes. Now, they complain, Hayes is just 
trying to bilk them. 
</P>
<P>
The debate over the discrepancy has landed both Hayes and Wood behind bars and 
led to the assignment of a police officer to the agency's meetings. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 15, Judge Lois Anderson-Smaltz found Hayes guilty of disrupting a CRA 
meeting and slapped him with a highly publicized 155-day jail sentence. The 
judge suspended the sentence 12 days later, when Mayor Tom Bradley's office 
urged the Police Department to assign an officer to monitor the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
While most political gadflies are content with just excoriating government 
officials during public meetings, Hayes also has picketed the homes of the 
agency's commissioners and subpoenaed them for testimony in court hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"The others are simply interested in the CRA activities," Hayes said of his 
fellow gadflies. "I'm actually a victim of their activities. That's why my 
fight is different." 
</P>
<P>
Hayes' pluck has awed his friends. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not like the rest of us," said Howard Watt, another CRA opponent. "He 
gives them hell. He pickets and yells at them. Now, Tut can blink and they'll 
arrest him." 
</P>
<P>
And it has angered his foes. 
</P>
<P>
Since last December, Wood has personally made at least three citizen's arrests 
of Hayes for disrupting CRA meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"He's unreasonable," said Melanie Lomax, one of four attorneys assigned to 
Hayes' case by the CRA. "I'm convinced that you cannot satisfy him. He has to 
realize other people in those meetings have rights too." 
</P>
<P>
As a condition of Hayes' release, Anderson-Smaltz ordered him to stay away from 
the commissioners' homes. But Hayes said the restrictions have not hindered his 
fight for redress. 
</P>
<P>
According to his calculations, the CRA owes him $7,000 for moving expenses and 
property he lost during the eviction, an undetermined sum in punitive damages, 
and, more importantly, a place to live. 
</P>
<P>
"I was homeless after they evicted me," said Hayes, who has lived in a 
storefront on Central Avenue for the last four years. "That's not supposed to 
happen. They are supposed to relocate you. They did not do that for me." 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, a commercial photographer now collecting disability compensation, said 
he also lost camera equipment and business. 
</P>
<P>
But CRA officials said they have been "more than fair" with Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Littman, a CRA spokesman, said the agency paid out $11,592 directly to 
Hayes. Littman said the CRA also spent more than $35,300 to move and store 
Hayes' belongings. 
</P>
<P>
While CRA officials said they don't know the total cost of their feud with 
Hayes, Wood conceded that it probably would have been cheaper to give Hayes the 
money he requested. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably could have saved some money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Wood added that writing Hayes a blank check could have also forced the 
agency to do likewise for other dissatisfied "relocatees." 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot make decisions based on threats," he said. "People will say, 'Give me 
what I want or I'll come down and sit in the board room.' You can't run an 
agency that way." 
</P>
<P>
In a recent meeting, however, the agency did agree to reconsider Hayes' request 
for repayment for camera equipment he said he lost. Also, Littman said, the CRA 
will reissue Hayes a $1,225 check for moving expenses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Watts Project 
</P>
<P>
Although redress sparked his fight with the CRA and is still his main gripe, 
Hayes said he also has heatedly challenged the agency on its highly touted 
Watts Redevelopment Project. 
</P>
<P>
CRA officials said they expect the project to revitalize more than 1,900 acres 
of mostly blighted residential, commercial and industrial property. 
</P>
<P>
But Hayes said he thinks the plan will leave many poor blacks homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"They are going to put up residences there that the people of Watts cannot 
afford," he said. "The blacks there will suffer." 
</P>
<P>
In a broader sense, Hayes contends that his fight is not just with the agency 
but "the system." 
</P>
<P>
Hayes said he also has picketed appearances by former President Ronald Reagan 
and Bradley, the latter for giving the key to the city to South African 
government leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm against the status quo," he said, "because what's good for the system is 
usually bad for black people. That's part of the reason why I fight them. These 
white boys at the CRA think they are so powerful that they can take this little 
black guy, throw him in jail and hear nothing from him." 
</P>
<P>
An ideological holdover from the turbulent '60s, Hayes said many of his ideas 
were shaped while he was a member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating 
Committee and a community patrol group. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a follower of Marcus Garvey and Malcolm X," said Hayes. "I believe in 
black people doing for themselves and in a separate black state. Don't get me 
wrong, I am not anti-white but pro-black." 
</P>
<P>
Remembering his days with SNCC, a prominent civil rights group of the 1960s, 
Hayes recalled helping to draft a secession plan for Watts. 
</P>
<P>
"But for some reason all the white city officials seemed in favor of it," he 
said, chuckling. "We knew right then if they liked it, there must be something 
wrong with it; so we dropped that idea fast." 
</P>
<P>
Hayes acknowledges that over the years his activism got him in trouble. He said 
he was arrested 57 times in one year during the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
In total, he said, he has been arrested well over 200 times, mostly for his 
protests. But the Sept. 15 conviction was his first. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time when it seemed like I would get arrested just for walking to 
my door," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, Hayes has been placed on probation for disrupting one CRA 
meeting and has another disruption case pending. 
</P>
<P>
In the latter case, Hayes and Howard Watt were arrested by Wood on May 17 for 
heckling CRA commissioners and throwing an audio cassette tape at one. 
Transcripts of the meeting show Watt openly challenging Wood while Hayes is 
quoted only as saying, "There's (a microphone) on the table." 
</P>
<P>
However, charges against Watt, who is white, were dropped. This led the CRA's 
other resident gadflies to accuse Wood of racism. 
</P>
<P>
Insisting that he was not racist, Wood said the city filed the charges -- not 
the CRA. 
</P>
<P>
"I know this is not a racial issue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the trial after the May 17 arrest, Hayes subpoenaed five of the 
commissioners for testimony, but they failed to appear. Bench warrants were 
issued, and Wood and Commissioner Daniel Horwitz were jailed for two hours. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason they were (in jail) was because they misunderstood the order," 
said Lomax, the CRA attorney. "They did not intentionally violate the law." 
</P>
<P>
Hayes said the commissioners had underestimated his ability to use the law to 
his advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"A big mistake," he said. "They aren't too intelligent. If they were, they 
would just give me my money and leave me alone."

PHONY MESSENGER ENTERS L.A. HOME; MAN FATALLY SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man was shot to death in his West Los Angeles home early Saturday after his 
wife opened the door to an intruder pretending to be a Western Union messenger, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
David Elias Isaac, 47, was fatally shot by an unidentified man who forced his 
way into the home located on a quiet street in the up-scale community of 
Beverlywood. West Los Angeles Division police who are investigating the 
shooting said the gunman fled the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the victim's wife opened the front door, shortly after midnight, 
after a man rang the doorbell identifying himself as a telegram company 
messenger. Since it was her birthday, she was not surprised that she might be 
receiving a telegram, police said. 
</P>
<P>
After she opened the door, a man forced the door open wider and held a gun to 
her head. Her husband, hearing a struggle at the front door, came to his wife's 
aid. During the struggle that ensued, Isaac was shot, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said they heard at least five shots coming from the house in rapid 
fire succession.

THANKS TO WHITTIER QUAKE, DAY-CARE CENTER HAS HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mariachis played. Children danced. A politician spoke. And everyone thanked the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The people who live around Vernon Avenue in South-Central Los Angeles gathered 
Saturday to celebrate the opening of a new day-care center. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers said that if it weren't for the 5.9-magnitude Whittier earthquake 
two years ago, the David Roberti Child Development Center might never have been 
built. 
</P>
<P>
The new center replaced an old one -- previously called La Promesa -- that had 
been making do in slightly cramped quarters that it shared with the All 
People's Christian Church on 20th Street downtown. The quake of Oct. 1, 1987, 
left the building unsound and the center searching for a new home. 
</P>
<P>
The two-year odyssey -- which included temporary stops at a church gymnasium, a 
warehouse and a pair of abandoned homes -- ended Saturday when state Sen. 
Roberti (D-Los Angeles) cut the ribbon on the new center that bears his name. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very much like the Phoenix rising from the ashes," said Marilyn 
Prosser, director of the statewide organization that operates the center and 17 
others. "The earthquake pushed us to do something much sooner." 
</P>
<P>
Private donors who asked to remain anonymous gave $600,000 to the foundation 
that runs the centers to pay for the property and construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
The new center stands out like an oasis on a stretch of Vernon Avenue south of 
downtown that is lined with grimy radiator shops, carpet remnant stores and 
battered apartments. The Spanish-style building is surrounded by a well-tended 
lawn, sandboxes and children's play equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish-speaking mothers said their children can hardly wait to attend the 
center, which is expected to pass final inspection within the next two weeks -- 
the last hurdle before it can open. 
</P>
<P>
One hundred children ages 2 to 6 will receive Montessori instruction there. 
Enrollment is free to most of the low-income parents, immigrants from Mexico 
and Central America who typically work in the garment district. 
</P>
<P>
"They keep asking me when the school will open," Corina Cordova said of her 
children. "They even want to come on weekends." 
</P>
<P>
Cordova and her husband, Fernando, both 29, came to California from Guatemala 
nine years ago. She works as a seamstress in the garment district and he is 
employed by a furniture factory in Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel so good because my children are getting such a chance," Corina Cordova 
said. "Anyone would be envious of what they are getting here."

PREP QUARTERBACK PULLS SNEAK, DODGES LEGAL SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AP 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON, Pa. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has all of the elements of a Perry Mason thriller. 
</P>
<P>
A star quarterback with a perfect grade-point average is surprisingly indicted 
for involvement in a burglary ring. His coach and school officials rush to his 
defense, only to have the star break down in tears when he's found delinquent 
and ordered not to play football. 
</P>
<P>
Then, under cloak of night, the player defies a court order and turns up at a 
private military school 1,500 miles away, where he's welcomed with open arms 
and wide-open receivers. 
</P>
<P>
But this isn't fiction, it's real life. And it's not the big-buck world of 
college football, where shady recruiting has been a way of life for decades. 
It's a high schoool football controversy that involves authorities in two of 
the sport's top hotbeds, Pennsylvania and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Perry Mason may have called it the Case of the Quarterback Bootleg . . . or, 
perhaps, the Case of the Bootleg Quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"He is one of the brightest young men, I've ever met," one of J.B. Kulik's 
teachers said. "If there is one word to describe him, it would be 
'exceptional.' " 
</P>
<P>
He is exceptional, but Jackson Blair Kulik also is an enigma. 
</P>
<P>
Brilliant in the classroom, Kulik aced advanced math exams so difficult they 
would test a rocket scientist. Bold and cocky on the football field, schools 
such as UCLA and Miami have recruited the 6-foot-5, 195-pounder because of a 
passing arm his coach describes as "a rocket." 
</P>
<P>
One day he scores 700 of a possible 800 on the verbal portion of the Scholastic 
Aptitude Test, the next day he throws three touchdown passes. He turns off some 
teachers and classmates with an arrogant, I'm-hot-stuff attitude, but everybody 
who knows him agrees Kulik has it all: brains, ambition, confidence, ability. 
</P>
<P>
And, while some high school football players have trouble eluding a single 
tackler, the just-turned-18 Kulik has dodged an entire state's legal system. 
</P>
<P>
It might be the ultimate quarterback sneak. 
</P>
<P>
"He just had an attitude about him," Pennsylvania state trooper Larry Maggi 
said. "He was very uncooperative. . . . He had an attitude that (being 
arrested) was very trivial, wasn't very serious." 
</P>
<P>
Just when it seemed J.B. Kulik had everything, he almost lost it all. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, just before beginning his senior year at Washington High School, 
Kulik was found delinquent in Washington County Juvenile Court of three 
first-degree felony counts. Authorities proved he was involved in -- some say 
he was the ringleader of -- a youthful burglary gang that stole more than 
$10,000 worth of stereo and satellite TV equipment and a Rolex watch. 
</P>
<P>
After being placed under house arrest Aug. 9 and ordered not to play football, 
Kulik -- who had bragged to friends he would get off without punishment -- 
broke down and cried. His mother pleaded he instead be allowed to attend a 
military academy for rehabilitation, but county Common Pleas Court Judge Thomas 
J. Terputac refused, saying: 
</P>
<P>
"He showed arrogance and disdain to the police officers that investigated this 
case. . . . Regardless of the testimony of character witnesses, we find this 
young man has a serious attitude problem, instilled in him probably by his 
family as well as his friends." 
</P>
<P>
After telling Washington High coach Guy Montecalvo that his attorney would 
appeal the decision to Pennsylvania Superior Court, Kulik decided he could live 
without Washington, a blue-collar town of 18,636 about 30 miles from 
Pittsburgh, but he couldn't live without football. 
</P>
<P>
Backed into a legal corner, unable to play the sport he lived for, J.B. Kulik 
did what comes instinctively to great quarterbacks: he ran a bootleg. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first heard he was coming here, I honestly thought it was a joke," said 
Harold G. Glasgow, a retired Marine Corps major general and the superintendent 
of the 402-student Marine Military Academy in Harlingen, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
In late August, defying the specific orders of a Pennsylvania court, Kulik, his 
mother and younger brother and sister fled the state. They arrived two days 
later in Harlingen, a town of 40,000 about 30 miles from the Mexican border. 
Relatives had told Kulik's mother about the Marine Military Academy, an 
ultra-strict prep school where Kulik immediately enrolled. His mother, Karen 
Adams, took a nursing job after using her $11,000 savings to pay her son's 
tuition. 
</P>
<P>
Kulik's father, John, a self-employed businessman and inventor who has been 
separated from Kulik's mother for 10 years, remained behind in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
A strait-laced school with a reputation for boot camp-like discipline and 
superior academics -- more than 60 graduates are enrolled in either the Naval 
Academy or West Point -- the Marine Military Academy seemed an unlikely place 
for a student with a court record as blemished as his academic record was 
brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
"I was advised by our attorneys we could enroll him . . . but I didn't think 
he'd be here in two days. When he was picked up by police on a bench warrant 
and taken to federal court in Brownsville, I thought we'd seen the last of Mr. 
Kulik," Glasgow said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Pennsylvania juvenile authorities are wondering if they'll ever see 
Kulik again. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 19, Cameron County, Tex., Judge Rojelio Valdez ruled that since Kulik 
had been remanded to his mother's custody, he had not absconded by fleeing to 
Texas and could remain in Harlingen. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just happy I'm still here," Kulik said. "If they want rehabilitation, this 
is where I should be." 
</P>
<P>
Pennsylvania authorities disagree. 
</P>
<P>
The Texas judge's decision reportedly infuriated Terputac, who immediately 
directed authorities to appeal the ruling under the Juvenile Interstate 
Compact, an agreement signed by all 50 states that sets guidelines for juvenile 
offenders to be extradited from one state to another. 
</P>
<P>
"I intend to pursue every avenue, in accordance with the law, to see that J.B. 
Kulik be brought back to Pennsylvania to answer charges and to have a hearing 
for violation of probation," Terputac said. 
</P>
<P>
The case has embarrassed and angered Pennsylvania juvenile authorities who 
can't recall another state refusing to extradite a convicted offender. 
Authorities also are considering filing additional charges, possibly against 
Kulik's mother for taking her son across state lines. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never run into anything like this before," said John Penderville, a 
Washington County juvenile court supervisor in charge of filing the appeal. 
"Different states have different laws, but this is very unusual." 
</P>
<P>
"In the last 10 years, which is about as long as anyone can recall, we have 
never had a (juvenile extradition) request rejected," said Matt Jones, a 
spokesman for the state Department of Public Welfare, which handles Interstate 
Compact filings. 
</P>
<P>
Some say Kulik's midnight run to daylight was merely a masterful checkoff at 
the legal line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
"Many times we've had kids here with a worse record than we've seen in Mr. 
Kulik," Glasgow said. "We've had students who (previously) were involved in 
stealing a car and worse, but these youngsters usually trip up and fall out 
academically. . . . But Mr. Kulik has a record that's most commendable. When I 
returned from court in Brownsville and told more than 400 youngsters that his 
case was under advisement for another week, every kid was on the edge of his 
seat. He's gained acceptance and recognition like no one I've ever seeen." 
</P>
<P>
Kulik's case is a graphic illustration of the the best and the worst of the 
American judicial and educational systems. 
</P>
<P>
Should he return to Pennsylvania before age 21, Kulik could face additional 
charges, including violation of probation. But with a favorable court ruling 
behind him, Kulik said he is concentrating on graduating from the MMA and 
attending college -- and with playing college football. 
</P>
<P>
He's making the grades in the classrooms, and his football statistics -- 50% 
passing completion rate, three touchdowns, three interceptions in less than a 
half a season -- also are earning passing grades. 
</P>
<P>
"But if he didn't play a down of football in this school, nobody would care. 
We've won two games and probably will win only two games but our primary 
purpose is for every graduate to be accepted into a major college, and that is 
our sole goal," Glasgow said. 
</P>
<P>
Kulik's football concentration has been adversely affected by missing preseason 
practice and the anxiety associated with his court case, but, off the field, he 
has been one of the academy's best and brightest, Glasgow said. 
</P>
<P>
As a first-year plebe, Kulik ranks lower than cadets years younger, and "some 
youngsters can't respond to a a ninth-grader who's half his size telling him to 
drop and do 20 pushups, but Mr. Kulik was accepted by the plebe system faster 
than any other plebe we've ever had," Glasgow said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was totally wrong about Mr. Kulik and everybody's eaten some crow because of 
him. He is the top first-year cadet we have in the school. He's made a believer 
out of everyone who's here." 
</P>
<P>
Recruiting experts disagree whether Kulik's end run will affect the recruiting 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Before he fled to Texas, Super Prep magazine -- the so-called "Rolls Royce of 
Recruiting" -- called Kulik the best quarterback prospect in Pennsylvania and 
his school's best player since Brian Davis, a running back who the Parade 
Magazine national player of the year in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Butler, who runs the influential Metro Index scouting service in 
Pittsburgh, isn't so high on Kulik's ability, but doesn't doubt he will sign 
with a Division I-A school. 
</P>
<P>
"There are kids everywhere who've been in trouble and signed with colleges," 
Butler said. "They'll check into his background . . . but they'll also evaluate 
his talent. And he'll get a shot at Division I."

<P>
USC: TROJAN HAS DEDICATED SEASON TO HIS COUSIN, THE LATE SAL AUNESE OF 
COLORADO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Linebacker Junior Seau of USC wears a towel with the name 'Sal' printed in 
large letters. 
</P>
<P>
Sal refers to Sal Aunese, the Colorado quarterback who died last month after a 
six-month battle with stomach cancer. Seau and Aunese were cousins who grew up 
together in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very close," Seau said. "He lived down the street from me and we went 
to church together." 
</P>
<P>
Seau has dedicated his season to Aunese. 
</P>
<P>
"I talk to him every day," Seau said. "I say, 'Sal here we go again.' And I 
know he's up there listening." 
</P>
<P>
Aunese would have been proud of the way Seau played in USC's 19-0 win over 
Stanford Saturday at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Seau (pronounced Say-ow) sacked Stanford's Steve Smith three times for 19 yards 
in losses. 
</P>
<P>
Seau said he saw fear in Smith's eyes when the Stanford quarterback surveyed 
the defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Smith was always peeking at me," Seau said. "When you get the quarterback 
peeking at you, you know you're doing something right." 
</P>
<P>
Seau and USC's defense did a lot of things right, limiting Stanford to 
minus-six yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're the best defense in the country," Stanford Coach Dennis Green 
said. "I don't think there is any doubt about it. They have great personnel 
with guys like (Tim) Ryan and Seau and (Mark) Carrier and (Cleveland) Colter. 
Those are four guys that will be All-Americans, and I'm sure I hurt somebody's 
feelings and left a couple of guys out. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a good team and they can explode and put a lot of pressure on you if 
you're not able to run, and nobody has been able to run on them so far this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Stanford couldn't run or pass against the Trojans, due in large part to a 
fierce rush applied by Seau, who leads the Pacific 10 with 10 sacks, most by a 
Trojan since Marcus Cotton had 12 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Junior Seau is a real force on the field," USC Coach Larry Smith said. "He's a 
great pass rusher and a fine football player. We try to move him around so 
people don't know where he is and can't double up on him." 
</P>
<P>
Seau played four different positions against Stanford, lining up at nose guard, 
tackle, end and linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
"It was real confusing for them," Seau said. "They'd see me at nose guard and 
then they'd see me at linebacker. It was a big shocker to them and it worked 
out for us." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Whitfield, the Stanford freshman tackle who spent the game watching Seau 
rush past him, said Seau confused him. 
</P>
<P>
"You can tell a lot about a pass rusher by the way he lines up," Whitfield 
said. "I wasn't sure which way he was going to go, in or out. Seau is a very 
excellent player." 
</P>
<P>
Whitfield seemed to handle Seau easily at first, but Seau said he was just 
setting up the Cardinal tackle by using a straight ahead rush to set up his 
outside rush. 
</P>
<P>
The tactic worked well. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone in the country can block Junior Seau one up," USC 
defensive tackle Tim Ryan said. "I don't care if it's a lineman or a running 
back." 
</P>
<P>
After sitting out his freshman season in 1987 because he was ineligible due to 
Proposition 48, Seau has blossomed into one of the leaders of the Trojan 
defense. A reserve last season, Seau said he didn't feel comfortable until this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a young buck in the system last year," Seau said. "This was USC and I 
didn't really get a grasp of things here. I felt that it was too good for me. 
But I believed I could compete, and I built my confidence in the spring and I 
played football the way I thought I can." 
</P>
<P>
Seau said he was an outcast at USC as a freshman because he was ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very disappointing to not have friends and have nobody to be around and 
look up to," Seau said. "I'm used to the limelight and it was very hard to deal 
with." 
</P>
<P>
Seau concentrated on academics and spent his free time lifting weights. 
</P>
<P>
"The weight room was my world," Seau said. "No one ever wanted to be associated 
with a Prop. 48 person at USC. I didn't have my social group with me so I had 
to train alone." 
</P>
<P>
The weightlifting has helped Seau overcome injuries such as the compound 
fracture of his left index finger sustained during two-a-day drills last 
August. 
</P>
<P>
But Seau also drew inspiration from Aunese. 
</P>
<P>
"He was fighting cancer at the same time I had a compound fracture in my 
finger," Seau said. "And I looked at it like he's fighting for his life and 
here I am with a compound fracture. I told myself that I'd better get out there 
and play."

LEWIS LEAVES MARK ON BRUINS; 
</P>
<P>
HUSKIES: TAILBACK RECOVERS AFTER A VIOLENT TACKLE AND FOOLS UCLA DEFENSE WITH A 
10-YARD RUN FOR WINNING SCORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Cary Conklin released the ball, and Greg Lewis looked back for it as he headed 
up field. He didn't see Matt Darby coming. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I caught the ball, though, I felt him," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Darby realized the dream of every defensive back who has ever played. He got a 
one-on-one tackle in the open field with a running back three inches shorter 
and five pounds lighter -- and didn't blow the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis caught the screen pass from Conklin, the Washington quarterback, three 
yards behind the line of scrimmage and turned up field. Darby made contact and 
lifted Lewis off the ground. He stuck his helmet in Lewis' stomach and laid him 
out on the Rose Bowl grass. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis stayed down for a few moments, the wind having been knocked out of him 
and his injured hands hurting. 
</P>
<P>
"About nine fingers are sprained now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies' starting tailback sat out only one play before going back in, his 
chance to do damage only moments away. 
</P>
<P>
Capping a day in which he rushed for 112 yards in 24 carries, Lewis crossed up 
the entire Bruin defense and scored on a 10-yard draw play with 1:02 remaining. 
When John McCallum added the extra point, Washington had a 28-27 victory 
Saturday, and the 5-foot-11 junior tailback had something besides aspirin to 
make to the Darby-induced hurt go away. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the end zone," Lewis said afterward, recalling the play that resulted in 
Washington's first road win over UCLA since 1979. "I saw a lot of open space." 
</P>
<P>
Just enough to bury the Bruins and their six defensive-back alignment. The pass 
they all expected never came. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing we could do about it," UCLA cornerback Carlton Gray said. 
"We were so spread out. I was shocked. Everybody on the field was shocked." 
</P>
<P>
The play worked to perfection, as much because of the previous nine calls as 
the last one. The Bruins were set up for the final play by the entire 78-yard, 
2-minute, 10-second drive. It was sort of like a batter who sees one curve- 
ball after another before the pitcher fools him with a fastball. 
</P>
<P>
First-and-10 on the Washington 22-yard line: Conklin connects with split end 
Mario Bailey over the middle for a 16-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
First-and-10 on the 38: Darby puts Lewis out of the game with the hit. Lewis 
holds onto the ball but losses three yards. 
</P>
<P>
Second-and-13 on the 35: Lewis sits this one out. Conklin loops a pass over the 
middle to Bailey, good for 26 yards. 
</P>
<P>
First-and-10 on the UCLA 39: Lewis bursts through the line for a 14-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
First-and-10 on the 25: Conklin connects with Bailey in the right flat for a 
four-yard gain. Washington calls a timeout with 1:45 left. 
</P>
<P>
Second-and-six on the 21: Conklin throws incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
Third-and-six on the 21: Conklin, trying to hit Bailey in the front of the end 
zone, throws incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-and-six on the 21: With the crowd on its feet, Conklin hits Bailey over 
the middle despite tight coverage by safety Eric Turner for a seven-yard gain 
and a first down. 
</P>
<P>
"That was obviously No. 1 on the hit parade on the drive," Washington Coach Don 
James said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Conklin, who was 20 of 36 for 183 yards, including six passes for 80 yards 
to Bailey: "Mario wanted the ball. You could see it in his eyes." 
</P>
<P>
First-and-10 on the 14: Conklin scrambles for four yards. 
</P>
<P>
Washington calls a timeout with 1:04 remaining. James huddles with Conklin and 
runs through the possibilities for the next play. They decide to put three 
receivers wide left and have flanker Orlando McKay slant across the middle. 
Conklin heads back to the huddle. . . but James changes his mind. Fifty draw, 
he shouts. The draw to Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Second-and-six on the 10: After watching Washington pass on seven of the 
drive's nine plays, UCLA defenders are on their heels as the Huskies come to 
the line. Lewis makes them regret it. 
</P>
<P>
"That last drive," Conklin said, "it was the greatest feeling I've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis wasn't feeling so bad himself. The hurt lingered, but his condition was 
being upgraded with every moment, thanks to 50 draw.

OAKLAND ATHLETICS VS. SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS; 
</P>
<P>
GIANT STAFF VIRTUALLY UNARMED AGAINST A'S POWERFUL LINEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the 162 games of their fife and drum march to a National League 
championship, the San Francisco Giants employed 15 starting pitchers. Each 
member of their original rotation spent time on the disabled list except Don 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with physical shortcomings of a similar nature in the best-of-seven World 
Series, it was not surprising that the Giants came up short in other ways as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
The critical category was games won. The Oakland A's swept the Series, four 
games to none. The score Saturday night was 9-6, the aforementioned Robinson 
lasting only 1 2/3 innings as the Giants' starter. 
</P>
<P>
Over the long season, the Giants' patchwork pitching staff finished third in 
the league in team earned-run average at 3.30. 
</P>
<P>
In the Series, with Robinson nursing a sore knee that restricted him to 8 1/3 
innings over the previous six weeks, and with Scott Garrelts complaining of a 
sore elbow and Rick Reuschel in and out of the rotation with back, groin and 
shoulder problems, San Francisco's starters compiled an ERA of 11.77 and 
averaged 3 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing that surprised me most," Giant Manager Roger Craig said, "is 
that we didn't pitch up to expectations. Some of our guys weren't 100%, but I'm 
not going to use that as an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had pitched to expectations, we'd still be playing, but we were four or 
five runs behind in every game, and it's tough to have to keep battling back in 
a short series." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants were outhit, 44-28, and outscored, 32-14. Of their 14 runs, 10 came 
after they trailed, 13-3, and 8-0, in Games 3 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
The staff ERA was 8.21 compared to the A's 3.50. 
</P>
<P>
Attempting to keep the Giants alive, Robinson said his knee was a factor 
Saturday night, but he also played it down. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough enough trying to beat that team when you're 100% and almost 
impossible when you're 80%," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't have been out there if I hadn't thought I was capable of pitching, 
but it did take away some from my velocity. I wasn't able to push off like I 
normally do." 
</P>
<P>
The pitch that proved fatal to Robinson was a two-strike, two-out fastball to 
opposing pitcher Mike Moore in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
Moore swung and missed at two high fastballs, but this one was down a little 
and he hammered it over the head of center fielder Brett Butler for a two-run 
double and a 3-0 Oakland lead. Moore scored on a single by Rickey Henderson, 
and Robinson left, trailing, 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
"They scored three runs off one pitch," Robinson said of Moore's double. "I 
wanted to get it in the same place as those first two pitches but made a 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe if I had pitched more in the last few weeks I'd have had more confidence 
in a breaking pitch or a cutter (cut fastball) in that situation, but I'm not 
going to second-guess the selection, just the location." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson opened the game by falling behind Rickey Henderson, throwing two 
consecutive balls on cut fastballs. He had to come in with a fastball, and 
Henderson hit it over the left-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
"My cutter wasn't working at all," Robinson said of his best pitch. "Part of 
that was the knee. Part of it was not having been out there much recently. I 
fell behind and had to make too many good pitches to too many good hitters. 
</P>
<P>
"The A's have everything, and we didn't do the job in any category, especially 
starting pitching. We won a National League pennant with the third-best ERA in 
the league, but we didn't pitch well against the A's. We weren't in any game. 
We didn't give our offense a chance. That's a disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
Having dismissed the injuries as a reason for the pitching breakdown, Craig 
also dismissed the uncertainty of the 10-day layoff created by the Oct. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"Oakland's starters were off the same number of days and didn't seem to have 
any problems," he said. "We just didn't make the pitches we wanted to make. 
</P>
<P>
"We were outpitched, outhit and outplayed. I give the A's a lot of the credit. 
They have the type team that should be up there for a number of years to come." 
</P>
<P>
Craig had a brief team meeting after the final out Saturday night and said he 
told his players they have nothing to be ashamed about. 
</P>
<P>
"I reminded them that nobody even expected us to be here, that they battled 
back all year to win a National League championship and that they could expect 
to be even better next year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them that was all I wanted them to think about. I mean, we were beat by 
a great club, and as much as I hate to lose four in a row, I won't go home 
feeling badly about this. 
</P>
<P>
"My dauber isn't down." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants have responded aggressively in previous winters to correct deficient 
areas. They signed Butler as a free agent to play center field and be the 
leadoff hitter. They traded for Steve Bedrosian as the stopper out of the 
bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
Craig said that he and club president Al Rosen have already addressed the 
club's needs, and the acquisition of a starting pitcher is among them. The 
Giants are expected to pursue free-agent pitcher Mark Langston while also 
bidding to beef up their hitting. A new right fielder is another need. 
</P>
<P>
Against the A's, the bottom five hitters in the Giant lineup were 10 for 68. 
The A's also controlled Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell, who drove in a combined 
total of four runs and were nine for 33. 
</P>
<P>
Said National League playoff star Clark, sitting at his locker: "Their pitching 
was very good, very consistent. They held us down in crucial situations. 
Everyone talks about their big boppers, but I think their pitching and defense 
is very underrated." 
</P>
<P>
Said Terry Kennedy, the Giant catcher: "It hurts to get beat as soundly as we 
did, but I'm not going to let that take anything away from what we did this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"Being league champion is no small thing, and I think it's a crime what some 
people are saying now about some of our pitchers, considering what they 
accomplished this year. The A's just kept pushing at the door, and we didn't 
have enough guys to keep it shut." 
</P>
<P>
Enough guys physically healthy enough to keep it shut, but that may be 
corrected now that it's finally the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
Said Craig, forcing a smile: "We'll do anything to improve the club except 
change managers."

PENSION PLANS LOOTED AS SAFEGUARDS WEAKEN; 
</P>
<P>
FRAUD: DESPITE WARNINGS, ABOUT $4 BILLION IN RETIREMENT INCOME MAY HAVE BEEN 
TAKEN BY RACKETEERS.

<P>
When his wife fell gravely ill, George Hohol wanted to quit his job as a welder 
so he could get his pension money to pay her soaring medical bills. But she 
begged him to keep working so they would have health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Hohol stayed on the job, but his health insurance was canceled a few months 
later without warning because his employer had stopped paying the premium. Then 
the paychecks started to bounce, and finally the company closed in late 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The worst was yet to come. When Hohol tried to get the $29,000 accumulated in 
his pension plan over 22 years, he got excuses and delays instead. Ultimately 
he learned the money was gone, lost in an elaborate fraud scheme by the owner 
and a lawyer for the small company, DuPage Boiler Works, in the Chicago suburb 
of Naperville. 
</P>
<P>
Hohol, a proud man who came to the United States from Poland after spending 
World War II in German labor camps, was $52,000 in debt and had been on 
unemployment for the first time in his life when his wife died in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife cried and cried because she hadn't let me quit before and get my 
money," Hohol said. "Her heart was broken, and I'm sure she died faster." 
</P>
<P>
Hohol and his wife were victims of what a federal official describes as "a new 
generation of racketeers" -- businessmen and lawyers who exploit weak 
government regulation to misuse and steal the retirement income of workers 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Labor Department, according to its acting inspector general, has 
proved powerless to deter abuse or to bring the wrongdoers to justice. The 
inspector general estimates that $4 billion in pension funds are being misused, 
but in reality, no one knows how deep the problem is. 
</P>
<P>
"The nation's pension and welfare plans are vulnerable to fraud and corruption 
because of a flawed enforcement strategy adopted by the Labor Department that 
relies too much on civil remedies and not enough on criminal prosecution," said 
Raymond Maria, the acting inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
Most pension plans, the experts say, are run honestly. Most workers will find 
their money waiting for them when they retire. And many pension plans -- but by 
no means all -- are federally insured in case the money runs out. 
</P>
<P>
Most abuse is found among relatively small employers -- the same ones that are 
least likely to be covered by federal insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The wrongdoers include small business owners who can't resist dipping into 
pension funds, such as a California construction company where $227,000 in 
pension funds was used to run the business. 
</P>
<P>
And they include those who appear intent on looting the funds from the start, 
such as a New Mexico potash mine owner accused of siphoning off $9 million in 
worker retirement funds to pay personal debts and finance a lavish life style. 
</P>
<P>
The enormous size of today's pension funds makes them attractive targets for 
the unobserved and the unscrupulous. 
</P>
<P>
Assets in private pension funds tripled in the last 10 years to $1.7 trillion 
-- about $7,000 for every man, woman and child in the country. More than 76 
million workers and retirees are covered by a pension plan. 
</P>
<P>
But internal government audits, interviews and court records raise questions 
about whether the federal government's ability to keep this vast pool of money 
safe for workers has kept pace with the mushrooming growth. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this statistic: The U.S. Labor Department agency responsible for 
monitoring the nation's 870,000 pension plans has only 260 auditors and 
investigators assigned to the task. 
</P>
<P>
They review fewer than 1% of the plans each year. The least attention goes to 
the most vulnerable plans, the small ones that are not supervised by the 
outside auditors and layers of lawyers hired by large corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Congress and the Labor Department inspector general's office, the internal 
watchdog that is supposed to make sure the department is doing its job, have 
issued repeated warnings about the inadequate resources. In 1986, a Senate 
committee concluded that inadequate staffing has dangerously compromised the 
department's ability to protect worker pensions. 
</P>
<P>
And earlier this year, a study of 168 plans by the inspector general's office 
uncovered $18.7 million in misused funds. At that rate, the office said, there 
would be $4-billion worth of fraud and abuse systemwide. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, the problem was far worse. Before Congress enacted the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in 1974, only a minuscule 3% of workers 
received the full benefits to which they were entitled. 
</P>
<P>
The 1974 law put the Labor Department's Pension and Welfare Benefits 
Administration in charge of monitoring pension plans. In 1978, when Jimmy 
Carter was President, the office conducted 8,598 reviews and investigations. By 
1988, the figure had plummeted to 1,632 despite the threefold increase in 
pension-fund assets. 
</P>
<P>
A PWBA spokeswoman explained that the agency has undertaken larger, more 
sophisticated cases in recent years. "Our enforcement strategy is that quality 
is more important than quantity," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The agency concentrates on the largest 5% of the plans, which hold roughly 90% 
of pension assets. The 93% of the plans with fewer than 100 participants are 
least likely to be reviewed, and they are not required to hire outside auditors 
to ensure that the money is being handled legally. 
</P>
<P>
"Making sure $1.7 trillion is invested wisely for the workers and retirees is 
an impossible task," said Karen W. Ferguson, director of the Pension Rights 
Center, an advocacy group for workers based in Washington. "It is not the fact 
that the Labor Department is not doing its job, but the fact that it is an 
impossible job to do given their limited resources." 
</P>
<P>
Government regulators such as the Internal Revenue Service and the Securities 
and Exchange Commission try to maximize limited resources through criminal 
prosecutions that send a strong message of deterrence. 
</P>
<P>
But the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration relies almost entirely on 
civil and administrative sanctions. Of the PWBA's 5,000 investigations in the 
last three years, only 95 were classified as criminal and only 26 convictions 
resulted. 
</P>
<P>
Maria, the acting inspector general, contends this strategy reassures would-be 
pension pillagers: The worst that will happen, in the unlikely event they are 
caught, is likely to be a civil fine. 
</P>
<P>
Pension-fund regulation today, the inspector general's office and others argue, 
is comparable to the woeful monitoring that contributed to the collapse of the 
savings and loan industry, a debacle expected to cost taxpayers at least $150 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., which was set up by the 1974 ERISA law to 
insure workers' pensions, has a deficit of $4 billion -- the difference between 
what they owe pensioners and what they can expect to receive in the form of 
employer premiums. 
</P>
<P>
A big chunk of the $4 billion is a disputed $2.3 billion in pension obligations 
left by the 1986 bankruptcy of LTV Corp. Although the PBGC has gone to court 
against LTV in a fight over responsibility for making the pension payments, it 
has also been making the payments for the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, for the first time, the PBGC paid out more money to cover pension 
obligations than it collected in employer premiums. The General Accounting 
Office, an investigative arm of Congress, warned that the fund would be broke 
-- unable to meet its current obligations -- by 2001. 
</P>
<P>
Congress reacted by increasing the insurance premium paid by employers, now the 
sole source of revenue for the PBGC. But PBGC officials are still concerned 
about potential problems with under-funded pension plans in big industries, 
such as the airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department's inspector general's office says a major shortfall could 
ultimately land in the taxpayers' laps, just as Congress turned to the 
taxpayers after another government insurance agency fell short of the funds it 
needed to pay insured depositors at failed S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
Pension fund system representatives and some Labor Department officials say 
such concerns are exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, the private pension system is probably stronger than it has ever 
been," said Alan D. Lebowitz, deputy assistant secretary for operations at the 
PWBA. "People should not be overly concerned about the stability of the system 
or the integrity of the system." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the Labor Department recently informed Congress that it was 
considering tighter regulations on audits by outside accountants, one of the 
recommendations from the inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
Although he maintained that corruption has been restricted to a small number of 
pension plans, Lebowitz acknowledged: "I think they are highly vulnerable to 
abuse. Pension funds are pots of money sitting there to pay future benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Jeanette Kurns grew concerned in early 1986. Paychecks from DuPage Boiler 
Works, the company where her husband -- like George Hohol -- had worked for 22 
years, were getting tough to cash. The local bank refused to honor them, and 
she had to be on the doorstep of the bank that issued the checks early in the 
morning to get them cashed before funds in the account ran out. 
</P>
<P>
For a half century, DuPage Boiler Works had run smoothly, if somewhat modestly. 
The work was steady, the overtime occasional. And if the hourly pay was less 
than other places, the workers were reminded every year that the company was 
setting money aside for them in a pension fund. 
</P>
<P>
But in October, 1984, the company had been sold to a man who identified himself 
as Robert Caldwell. He had big plans and built a fancy new office to go with 
them. He was driven to work in a limousine and gave the workers free turkeys 
the first Thanksgiving and again that Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Only later would they discover that their pensions had probably financed that 
generosity. 
</P>
<P>
Within two weeks of taking over, Caldwell had begun raiding the profit-sharing 
account, according to court records. He had $350,000 transferred to another 
account and used some of the money to pay debts of another company he owned. 
Some of it went to such expenditures as a fur coat for himself and $45,000 
worth of clothes for his wife, according to Joan B. Safford, a federal 
prosecutor in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Caldwell was actually Morton Scherl, a white-collar criminal with an arrest 
record dating to the mid-1960s in Los Angeles. When he bought DuPage Boiler, 
using the company's own money for the purchase, he was a fugitive wanted in New 
York, Massachusetts and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
By May, 1986, Scherl and William B. Goodstein, a Chicago lawyer, had wiped out 
DuPage Boiler's $741,000 profit-sharing account. About $35,000 had gone in 
small amounts to retiring workers to silence their complaints about not getting 
their pensions. The rest, court records show, went to Scherl and Goodstein and 
a variety of their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
In sucking the cash out of DuPage, Scherl had also stopped paying the utility 
bills or paying for raw material. And even though money was still being 
deducted from paychecks, he stopped paying withheld taxes to the IRS and 
cancelled the health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
For seven months in 1986, Jeanette Kurns tried to get someone to take a look at 
what was going on at DuPage. She wrote to President Ronald Reagan, the Labor 
Department, the IRS and various state agencies. She has a large blue binder 
filled with her futile correspondence and notes of her telephone conversations. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a brick wall everywhere I turned, especially at the Labor 
Department in Washington," Kurns said. "The Department of Labor told me this 
was going on in such wide numbers that they didn't have enough investigators to 
go out and check." 
</P>
<P>
Wives of other workers also were urging the Labor Department to look into the 
problems, with similar results. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Lerner, the PWBA enforcement director, refused to comment directly on 
the DuPage Boiler case. But he said citizen complaints are one source for the 
agency's investigations of pension-fund problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We get thousands and thousands of phone calls," he explained. "The numbers are 
so huge." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually state authorities and the U.S. attorney's office began to 
investigate DuPage Boiler Works in the fall of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
That October, an IRS agent approached Scherl in the coffee shop of a Sheraton 
Hotel outside Chicago and told him he was under arrest. Scherl dashed through 
the hotel kitchen into the parking lot and fled. It was a year and a half 
before he was captured in Baltimore, where he was in the midst of another 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Scherl recently pleaded guilty in federal court in Chicago to misusing DuPage 
Boiler's pension funds and other charges and is awaiting sentencing. Goodstein, 
the lawyer, was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
At Goodstein's trial, George Hohol and Jeanette Kurns were among several 
witnesses who testified about the financial hardship resulting from the pension 
fraud. Safford, a veteran prosecutor with a reputation for toughness, was so 
upset by Hohol's story that she left the courtroom to avoid crying in front of 
the jury. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses also described their frustrations with the Labor Department, 
prompting the presiding judge, Charles P. Kocoras, to offer lawyers in the case 
his view on the department's response. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the witnesses said she called Washington and they told her not to worry 
about it," Kocoras said from the bench. "Here they are getting fleeced out of 
all of this money, and Washington is advising these people not to worry." 
</P>
<P>
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. was established by the ERISA law to insure 
the pensions of workers and retirees. If employers do not provide enough money 
to cover promised benefits when a plan is ended, the agency will pay them up to 
a ceiling that is now set at $2,028 a month. 
</P>
<P>
However, the PBGC insures only what are called defined-benefit plans, which 
promise a specific monthly benefit at retirement. As a result, only 107,500 of 
the 870,000 pension plans are insured, although the covered plans represent 40 
million workers and retirees out of the 76 million enrolled in pension plans. 
</P>
<P>
Defined-contribution plans, whose ultimate pension benefit is not 
predetermined, are not insured by the PBGC. Most common among these are 
profit-sharing plans, employee stock ownership plans and 401(k) savings plans. 
</P>
<P>
James B. Lockhart, executive director of the PBGC, said the percentage of 
workers covered by defined-benefit plans has declined steadily in the 1980s. 
More worrisome to Lockhart is the fact that most new pension plans are 
defined-contribution plans, which are not insured by the government. 
</P>
<P>
The DuPage Boiler Works profit-sharing plan was not insured. After the company 
closed its doors, a court-appointed trustee for the pension plan recovered 
enough during bankruptcy proceedings to pay workers about 80% of their 
pensions. But the faith of people like Jeanette Kurns was shaken badly. 
</P>
<P>
"You think that money is as safe as the money in your bank account," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lerner, the PWBA enforcement director, said the agency has tried to cover more 
plans by focusing its enforcement on financial consultants who advise multiple 
plans and on financial institutions that hold the assets of many plans. 
</P>
<P>
But an examination of cases against consultants and financial businesses in 
recent years raises doubts about the agency's effectiveness in this arena. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, the department filed a civil lawsuit against the New York brokerage 
house Shearson Lehman Hutton, two smaller investment firms, three former 
brokers and several fund trustees. The defendants played a role in managing 
$560 million belonging to several Teamsters Union pension and welfare plans in 
Utica, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, which is pending, charged that the plans lost money in a scheme in 
which the brokers bought stocks and placed them in a holding account for 
several days. Losing trades were assigned to pension-fund accounts and 
profitable trades went into the accounts of friends, relatives and other 
customers, including some plan trustees, the suit contends. 
</P>
<P>
But this was not a case of the Labor Department's ferreting out alleged 
wrongdoing. The lawsuit followed a 6-year-old criminal investigation by federal 
prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which had already led 
to guilty pleas by three brokers. 
</P>
<P>
The department was equally late in the case of Glen E. Dawson of Annapolis, 
Md., a former IRS auditor who invested funds for about 200 small pension funds 
and drove a Mercedes-Benz sports car bearing a license plate reading "ERISA." 
</P>
<P>
Dawson, who handled pension investments for doctors and accountants, promised 
high returns for the pension funds of the professionals and their employees. 
</P>
<P>
ERISA prohibits those responsible for pension money from accepting fees for 
investing the funds in a particular institution. But for several years, 
according to a lawsuit filed in Baltimore, Dawson invested pension-fund assets 
with companies that paid him substantial commissions and fees in return. 
</P>
<P>
One client, a Midwestern accountant, said he was questioned by a Labor 
Department investigator in 1983 about Dawson's operation. The accountant said 
he provided a sworn statement to a department lawyer that year but never heard 
anything further and kept using Dawson. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson stayed in business until outside events intervened. He was also chairman 
of a Baltimore savings and loan association, and the state seized the S&amp;L 
in December, 1985, because it was insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
Court records show that the S&amp;L had lent Dawson $105,000 and that he had 
invested pension-fund money in the thrift when it was struggling to survive 
what Maryland regulators charged was "gross mismanagement and plundering" by 
its officers, including Dawson. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1986, the Labor Department filed a civil lawsuit accusing Dawson of 
violating ERISA. Court files indicate the pension plans operated by Dawson, 
which were uninsured, had lost up to $1 million in what the lawsuit called a 
pattern of unlawful transactions covering seven years and 130 plans. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a federal judge banned Dawson from the pension business and ordered 
him to repay the plans a total of $70,000 in restitution. Dawson had filed for 
bankruptcy earlier, and a lawyer in the case said $70,000 was about all he had 
left by the time the Labor Department got to him.

DEATH SQUADS TEAR AT FABRIC OF SRI LANKA

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The old woman was shrieking and wailing and beating her head with her fists as 
she wildly circled the bloodied body of her son, a local grocer known only as 
Simon. 
</P>
<P>
"My God, can't you all see?" she screamed to the crowd of villagers who had 
gathered around. "He is still alive. He is still breathing. Can't you see it? 
My son is dying. Help him! Help him!" 
</P>
<P>
But the villagers who had known Simon all their lives just stared at the grisly 
scene, paralyzed with fear. They couldn't help poor old Simon, several of them 
explained. If they did, they said, they surely would be next. 
</P>
<P>
The blood-red letters on a sign left in the mud near Simon and the bodies of 
his son and another village merchant who lay bound and hacked to death on the 
roadside explained why. 
</P>
<P>
The three men had been helping the police, the poster stated. They had been 
identifying members of Sri Lanka's insurgent People's Liberation Front, who 
themselves are being slaughtered in record numbers these days by pro-government 
death squads. 
</P>
<P>
"So we have punished them by killing them," the insurgents' poster declared. 
</P>
<P>
Not quite all of them, though. Simon the grocer clearly was still alive. As his 
mother and his wife wailed and called for help, his chest rose and fell with 
his last breaths. His right hand twitched. His left had been chopped off. He 
was in shock and bleeding to death. 
</P>
<P>
An army patrol, summoned by one brave villager, arrived in a jeep. The soldiers 
studied the dying grocer. Then they walked over to the poster. Expressionless, 
they picked it up and turned to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"But this man is alive," an outsider reminded them. "The poster said he was one 
of yours. Why don't you help him?" 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the army's job. This is for the police," an officer explained 
before driving away. 
</P>
<P>
But the police never came. And old Simon, the grocer of Kiriwelgolla village, 
was left to die in the early morning sun as his wife and his mother wept and 
his village watched in silence. 
</P>
<P>
It was a typical morning in Sri Lanka's newest killing ground, the jungle 
villages surrounding the country's historic Buddhist capital of Kandy. It is 
the latest chapter in a civil war that has grown so brutal and so 
all-encompassing that it is now consuming almost every institution of this 
island nation's society -- religion and family, as well as the islanders' once 
sacred sense of community and justice. 
</P>
<P>
It is here in Sri Lanka's religious heartland, around the world's 
second-most-important site of Buddhist pilgrimage, that the latest "front" has 
emerged in a guerrilla war that is now taking the highest toll of any conflict 
in the world -- about 50 deaths a day. 
</P>
<P>
Every morning, dozens of bodies are left strewn across the countryside around 
Kandy. Some have been beheaded or tied to burning tires. Those killings are the 
work of vigilante death squads that critics say are now sanctioned by the 
government under a new get-tough counterinsurgency campaign. It is an all-out 
effort to defeat the rebels, who say they are waging a grass-roots war against 
a corrupt and elitist government. 
</P>
<P>
Others, like Simon the grocer, are hogtied and hacked to death, left as 
reminders from the hit squads of the People's Liberation Front of the price to 
be paid for cooperating with the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, not even the region's venerated Buddhist monks have been exempt. 
</P>
<P>
Amid strong suspicion that some of them are aiding the insurgents, more than 
two dozen young monks have been killed in the last month alone, according to 
the high priest at Kandy's ancient Temple of the Tooth, which is said to house 
Buddha's eyetooth. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, older monks, who have voiced public support for the 
personally devout President Ranasinghe Premadasa, say they are being killed by 
the insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine, we have seen monks still wrapped in their saffron robes floating dead 
in the rivers here," said Amunugama Athadasi Nayaka Hamuduru, the head priest 
at the temple, which has been a world Buddhist center for centuries. "Yes, it 
is true, Lord Buddha teaches we are not to kill even an ant. But now, it is not 
safe even to be a monk. 
</P>
<P>
"We are more worried than ever nowadays. Even the army says they do not trust 
any monk under 40. And when I cross the street from the temple, I never know if 
I will come back." 
</P>
<P>
What is more, rural temples suspected to be insurgent strongholds have been 
raided by the army, and their sacred shrines smashed, during searches for rebel 
weapons caches. And several young monks suspected of being guerrilla 
sympathizers have fled their temples and are now believed to be in remote 
jungle guerrilla hide-outs. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a terrifying atmosphere at the moment," said Shelton Ranaraja, a 
prominent Kandy political leader and Sri Lanka's former deputy justice 
minister. He said the latest government crackdown is succeeding only in 
deepening the nation's fears. 
</P>
<P>
"We are taught not to kill even an animal or an ant, and here we are killing 
everything and everyone in sight. I don't understand what is happening anymore. 
It is just violence met with violence. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the security forces have broken the back of the insurgents. They 
(the rebels) are going slow, and their ability to organize has been hurt badly. 
But they will regroup. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid all that has been broken is the spirit of the people." 
</P>
<P>
Behind the escalating carnage in Kandy is a new dimension to the war, a single 
man. He is the new police chief in the region, handpicked by President 
Premadasa to implement his new get-tough policy in the country's key central 
regions. Even before he arrived in Kandy three months ago, Deputy Police 
Inspector General Premadasa Udugampola had become a national legend here. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no one more feared in this entire nation of 16 million," said one of 
the president's top aides, who asked not to be identified by name. "Everywhere 
he has gone, death has followed. Now, he has been turned loose in Kandy, and it 
is having some effect. Everyone is scared, and the (insurgents) are lying low. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether it will work or not in the long term, who knows? But, in the meantime, 
Mr. Udugampola clearly is a man with a license to kill." 
</P>
<P>
And, just as clearly, the new police chief is as proud of that license as he is 
of his image. He has prominently placed a poster of Timothy Dalton as James 
Bond in the movie "License to Kill" behind his desk. He uses hand grenades and 
machine-gun bullets as paperweights. And his office is cluttered with Uzi 
submachine guns, automatic pistols and even small artillery pieces. 
</P>
<P>
What is less visible is Udugampola's motivation. That is something of a Sri 
Lankan version of the Charles Bronson series of "Death Wish" movies. 
</P>
<P>
Udugampola's mother and sisters were raped and massacred by the insurgents in 
his home village several years ago. Their bodies were left in pieces as a 
message. 
</P>
<P>
The police officer heeded the warning. He moved his wife and children to Los 
Angeles. But ever since, Udugampola has led an elite squad of similarly 
motivated men on a singular mission -- to wipe out the insurgency at whatever 
human cost. 
</P>
<P>
He already has been posted in three major Sri Lankan cities, and, within weeks 
of his arrival in each region, vigilante death squads sporting such names as 
"Black Cats," "Green Tigers" and now, in Kandy, "Eagles of the Highland" have 
appeared on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The squads work only at night, rounding up rebel suspects from their homes, 
killing them as brutally as possible and leaving their bodies by the roadside 
as a message. 
</P>
<P>
There are no accurate or official counts of such deaths in Kandy's Central 
province since Udugampola arrived. But there are scores of stark illustrations. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, for example, a People's Liberation Front hit team assassinated 
an assistant registrar of Kandy's main university. The next morning, the death 
squads answered. They neatly arranged 15 severed heads of rebel suspects around 
the traffic circle outside the campus. And the next day, there were 18 more. 
</P>
<P>
And Wednesday, the day after Simon and the other victims were found, the bodies 
of 24 young men, their throats slashed, were strewn across a road near Kandy. 
Residents and police sources said a poster near the bodies claimed 
responsibility for the Eagles vigilante group and made clear they were in 
retaliation for the deaths of Simon and the others. 
</P>
<P>
Military sources said 20 other people were killed in separate incidents in Sri 
Lanka in the 24 hours ending Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Udugampola has insisted several times that he has nothing to do with the 
vigilante squads, but one of his own officers indirectly confirmed it: "It is 
tit-for-tat now. They kill one of ours at the university, we answer with 15 of 
theirs. That is our slogan -- 15 of yours for each one of ours. 
</P>
<P>
"But this man, Mr. Udugampola, is the greatest patriot of our nation. The 
politicians sit and talk while he is out ending this war. He is the only one 
who is fighting like this to save his country." 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats and neutral Sri Lankan politicians are not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the government's crackdown, which began in earnest after the 
insurgents put up posters nationwide announcing plans to kill the families of 
police officers and soldiers, one Western diplomat in the capital of Colombo 
said it has been a success, but only in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a feeling we've seen the worst for a while," the diplomat said. "The 
(insurgents) are really hurt badly. Their ability to move around has been 
crippled. They can no longer stage nationwide strikes. And they're on the run. 
</P>
<P>
"But what you have left behind is a crippled country. And how you recover from 
that, I just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Ranaraja, the former deputy justice minister, doesn't know either. 
</P>
<P>
"Our entire society is disintegrating," he said on the balcony of his Kandy 
home, which he said he now leaves only for emergencies. "There are no 
institutions left. The courts are at a standstill. . . . Not even murder is 
tried in the courts. The security forces and the (insurgents) just go out and 
kill. Everything is extrajudicial now. 
</P>
<P>
"The universities have been closed for two years. No one goes out after 7 p.m., 
not even to visit family. And people are now becoming physically and mentally 
sick from the tension. The children are sick. It's tormenting me, and I am 
getting sick. 
</P>
<P>
"In a sense, things are working now. The security forces have pushed it all 
underground, and some things have the appearance of normalcy. But it is all on 
the surface. Behind it, the spirit of our people has been broken, and it will 
take years for us to recover. I know it is not possible I will see it in my 
lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The Organization of American States was established in 1948. Based in 
Washington, D.C., it has 32 permanent members and 24 permanent observers. As 
outlined in its charter, the organization's purpose is to achieve "an order of 
peace and justice, promoting solidarity among the American states; (to 
strengthen) their collaboration and (defend) their sovereignty, their 
territorial integrity and their independence . . . as well as to establish . . 
. new objectives and standards for the promotion of the economic, social and 
cultural development of the peoples of the hemisphere, and to speed the process 
of economic integration."

<P>
President Bush on Saturday denounced Nicaragua's decision to resume warfare 
against the Contras, calling the move by President Daniel Ortega "shameful" and 
"outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
Ortega announced Friday that his Sandinista government will unilaterally end a 
19-month cease-fire in the war with the U.S.-backed rebels. 
</P>
<P>
In a press conference Saturday, however, Ortega appeared to back off his threat 
slightly, saying that he would reconsider the decision to resume offensive 
operations this week if the United States moves to cut off its remaining 
assistance to the guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
"We are proposing a way out," Ortega said. "If the U.S. government . . . says 
'we will assign these funds to demobilize the Contras,' then we will 
immediately renew the truce," Ortega said. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. spokesman rejected that proposal. The remaining U.S. aid to the Contras 
is "humanitarian," said Roman Popadiuk, White House deputy press secretary. 
Demobilization of the Contras, he added, has to be a "voluntary decision" by 
the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Saturday, Bush said that an end to the cease-fire would 
"change the equation 180 degrees" in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
But with typical caution, the President refused to say what the United States 
might do if Nicaragua's army begins an all-out offensive against the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to get out ahead of where I think things may be right now," Bush 
said, noting that fighting in Nicaragua had not yet actually intensified. "We 
didn't come here to have a contretemps with this little man showing up in his 
military uniform at a democracy meeting." 
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement at the press conference, Bush called Ortega's action 
"a shameful blow to democracy." He also said the decision to announce the end 
of the cease-fire here was "an offense to the president of Costa Rica," who had 
invited hemispheric leaders here for the summit. "It is the most outrageous use 
of a meeting on democracy that I can think of." 
</P>
<P>
Likening Ortega to "an animal at a garden party," Bush predicted that an end to 
the cease-fire would "bring down on (Ortega) the outrage of every president." 
</P>
<P>
Ortega, responding to Bush just before boarding his airplane to leave Costa 
Rica, said "the tone of the (President's) statement was not in harmony with the 
spirit of the summit." 
</P>
<P>
Ortega's decision shocked participants at the summit. Friday night, during a 
gala dinner for the heads of government, Costa Rican President Oscar Arias 
Sanchez and Venezuelan leader Carlos Andres Perez spoke to Ortega and "gave him 
a hammering," a participant at the dinner said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ortega seemed to pull back from a confrontation," the source added. 
</P>
<P>
As the leaders entered the dinner, a large crowd of Costa Ricans cheered Bush 
but jeered Ortega. The crowd seemed to be reacting more to Ortega's decision to 
wear a military uniform in this demilitarized country than to his announcement 
of an end to the cease-fire, which had not yet received wide publicity here. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Sergio Gomez, 30, who works in Costa Rica's social security 
administration, said that Ortega was "not respecting the customs of Costa Rica. 
It's an insult that he comes to a very democratic country with military clothes 
on." Gomez was one of tens of thousands of Costa Ricans who jammed the new 
Democracy Plaza for the summit's closing ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega was one of only two of the 16 summit participants to skip the ceremony. 
Even though a sheet of bulletproof glass protected the presidents' box on a 
stairway of the National Museum overlooking the plaza, Ortega's aides cited 
"security concerns" for his absence. 
</P>
<P>
The other absentee, President Jose Sarney of Brazil, had to depart for home 
before the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
At his press conference, however, Bush did clearly rule out one option, saying 
that he would "encourage the Contras in every possible way not to engage in 
military action." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the Contras ought to attack," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a Contra spokesman said, because of the cutoff early last year of U.S. 
military supplies, the rebel forces have virtually no chance of standing up to 
an assault by the Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation is very grim," rebel spokesman Bosco Matamoros said. "Ortega 
could deal the final blow to the resistance because of the position of the 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost any confidence in dealing with the Americans," he added. "They have 
brought the resistance to the edge of annihilation." 
</P>
<P>
In February, Bush abandoned the Reagan Administration's policy of arming the 
rebels, agreeing with congressional leaders that the United States would supply 
only food, clothing and medical supplies to rebel forces in their Honduran base 
camps while concentrating on support for Ortega's domestic opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Bush held his press conference after a breakfast meeting with Violeta Barrios 
de Chamorro, the presidential candidate of the main opposition coalition in 
Nicaragua. Chamorro's alliance is receiving several million dollars in support 
from Washington. The election is scheduled for next Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega's announcement is "most worrisome," Chamorro said after the meeting. "It 
is clear that he doesn't want democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Before Ortega's announcement of an end to the cease-fire, White House aides had 
portrayed Saturday morning's meeting, which also included leaders of the 
opposition to Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, as the main event of 
Bush's participation in the two-day hemispheric summit here. 
</P>
<P>
But the meeting -- indeed the summit itself -- largely faded into the 
background amid the prospect of renewed warfare in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
In his press conference, Ortega rejected criticism of his decision, accusing 
the international community of hypocrisy in overlooking the deaths of 
Sandinista soldiers killed by the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States government wants to keep the Contras around indefinitely to 
exert pressure against Nicaragua," Ortega said. "This is a source not only of 
continuing criminal attacks against the Nicaraguan people (but) in the face of 
inevitable Sandinista victory in the coming elections, the Contras are trying 
to torpedo the voting process." 
</P>
<P>
In the 19 months of the cease-fire, he said, the Contras have killed 736 
government soldiers and civilians and wounded 1,150 others. U.S. officials have 
challenged those numbers but do not flatly deny them. 
</P>
<P>
Noting the stunned reaction to his announcement here, Ortega said that "we did 
not find the same concern, the same alarm when 19 Nicaraguans were murdered" in 
a rebel attack on a Sandinista militia convoy a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
Contra spokesman Matamoros said he could neither confirm nor deny that the 
rebels committed that attack. 
</P>
<P>
Several leaders here joined in the criticism of Ortega. 
</P>
<P>
"We profoundly lament that this has happened," Costa Rican Foreign Minister 
Rodrigo Madrigal Nieto said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are making many efforts so that this situation may be saved," Madrigal 
added, but Ortega's announcement came "at a particularly inopportune moment." 
</P>
<P>
El Salvador's president, Alfredo Cristiani, said in an interview on CNN's 
"Newsmaker Saturday" program that he was "very disappointed" with Ortega's 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
A renewal of fighting would show that Ortega "really is not looking for a 
peaceful solution but some means of staying in power beyond democracy," 
Cristiani said. 
</P>
<P>
During Friday's summit session, Cristiani had challenged Ortega to cease 
shipments of arms to the Marxist rebels who are fighting the Salvadoran 
government. At his press conference, Ortega was less than categorical in 
denying that such aid efforts continue, but he demanded that Cristiani show 
proof. 
</P>
<P>
In his press conference, Bush supported Cristiani's position and said that El 
Salvador had made "dramatic improvements" in its human rights situation. 
Independent observers have challenged that position, saying that death squad 
violence in El Salvador has increased this year after several years of decline. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also repeated his contention that efforts to bring down Panama's Noriega 
will eventually prevail. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a question of when, not if," Bush said. "It is the judgment of history. 
The day of the despot, the day of the dictator -- over, finished." 
</P>
<P>
Before beginning the meetings, Bush took time for some recreation, playing a 
doubles tennis game with Baker against Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem 
and Rodrigo Borja Cevallos, the president of Ecuador. The leaders had jokingly 
said Friday night that they would wager their respective national debts on the 
outcome of the match. 
</P>
<P>
"We blindsided those guys; we totally destroyed them," Bush joked later to a 
gathering of American residents of Costa Rica at the U.S. Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
The match had ended with the U.S. team ahead when Borja injured an ankle.

<P>
When President Mikhail S. Gorbachev began to speak more than three years ago 
about "new political thinking" as the basis for the Soviet Union's foreign 
policy, it was taken in the West as just another slogan from an Establishment 
that had produced many others over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"What about Afghanistan?" Western commentators would ask. "What about East 
Europe -- Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland? What about the massive concentration 
of Warsaw Pact forces in Central Europe? What about support for Third World 
Marxists? What about human rights?" 
</P>
<P>
What, in other words, had changed? What was new in this policy that Gorbachev 
proclaimed would be based on "universal human values?" 
</P>
<P>
Those changes are now appearing with increasing rapidity around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet forces completed their withdrawal from Afghanistan in February. With 
Soviet approval, Poland's Parliament has installed the first non-Communist 
government in Eastern Europe in 40 years. Hungary has opted for a true 
multiparty, parliamentary democracy. A costly and often dangerous 30-year rift 
in relations with China has been ended. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow is halfway through a unilateral 500,000-man reduction in its armed 
forces, and the cutbacks in Central Europe are sharply, and deliberately, 
curtailing its offensive capability there. Soviet arms shipments to Nicaragua 
have been suspended in support of a political settlement in the region. And 
Soviet efforts to improve its observance of human rights were praised this 
month by one of its sternest critics, Amnesty International. 
</P>
<P>
Taken individually, the changes are quite significant, reducing the 
confrontation between East and West and helping to end regional conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
Together, however, they constitute a dramatic, profound and unparalleled 
reorientation of Soviet foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting last week on the reasons for such a fundamental shift, Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister, attributed it primarily to 
perestroika, the Soviet Union's domestic reforms, and he implied that further 
changes lie ahead as the reform process here deepens. 
</P>
<P>
"Perestroika gives new meaning to the questions of what place socialism and the 
Soviet Union occupy in the world, of the correlation of interests, of values 
and priorities," Shevardnadze said in a major address to the Supreme Soviet, 
the country's legislature, on the philosophical underpinnings of the new 
foreign policy. "Perestroika, in other words, dictates the necessity of a 
thoroughly new foreign policy." 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze stressed, as Gorbachev has, the primacy of "universal human 
values" over Marxist class struggle and traditional national interests alike. 
"No national and state interests," he declared, "can justify a political 
decision or a diplomatic action, however pragmatic, unless they are moral." 
</P>
<P>
To underscore his point, he went on to describe the Soviet Union's military 
intervention in Afghanistan a decade ago as a violation of international law, 
of Soviet law, of Communist ethics and of the "universal human values" that he 
said should be the basis of Soviet foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan was a grievous error, he said, but there were others equally 
serious in recent years -- the construction of a large radar station in Siberia 
in direct violation of an arms control treaty with the United States, the 
"continued mass production of toxic agents" despite a halt by the United States 
in the manufacture of chemical weapons in 1969, and the whole arms build-up 
beyond the minimum necessary for the Soviet Union's defense. 
</P>
<P>
"As minister, I shall comply with every lawful decision," Shevardnadze 
declared, breaking political precedents here, "but I reserve the right to 
resign when I cannot agree with any decision for moral or political reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze's candor itself was breathtaking, particularly after years of 
diplomatic waffle and quite deliberate deceit. 
</P>
<P>
Not only had the Soviet people been lied to, he told the lawmakers, but so had 
members of the Communist Party's leadership. The decision to send troops into 
Afghanistan was made by a few members of the ruling Politburo with the others 
confronted with the result, and the real capability of the controversial 
Krasnoyarsk radar station, now being dismantled, was kept from Gorbachev until 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze's speech was itself a historic attempt to place Soviet foreign 
policy under parliamentary oversight as part of a broad process of 
democratization and, at the same time, offset the influence of those 
institutions, such as the military, that have had a preponderant voice in 
determining Moscow's stance and actions. 
</P>
<P>
"When you say to our Parliament, 'This is how you are being cut out of the 
action,' you can be sure today of a reaction, a countermove," a Soviet foreign 
policy specialist said. "Shevardnadze's speech was his own little 'declaration 
of independence' from the traditional foreign affairs establishment. The people 
will now have a voice through Parliament. . . . For sure, that means no more 
Afghanistan." 
</P>
<P>
But the philosophical shift in Soviet foreign policy is far greater than even 
these statements suggest. 
</P>
<P>
In asserting that socialism veered badly off course in the Soviet Union under 
the dictator Josef Stalin and is only now being corrected, the Communist Party 
has acknowledged that its rule has been undemocratic and its policies 
frequently and often fundamentally wrong. 
</P>
<P>
And what is true for domestic policies is being seen as equally true for Soviet 
foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a deformed socialism at home -- that's the best we can say of it -- 
and we exported the result as the salvation of the rest of the world," a senior 
Soviet diplomat commented after Shevardnadze's speech last week. "If you start 
with a political system that was undemocratic to the point of being a tyranny 
under Stalin, how can you pretend that its foreign policy was any different? We 
cannot even argue today that we acted in our national interests, for how do you 
determine national interests without democracy?" 
</P>
<P>
Nikolai Popov, a Soviet political scientist, had argued earlier this year that 
the Soviet Union could only blame itself for the "culture of confrontation" 
with the West -- and suggested that this had also helped excuse its own 
failings. 
</P>
<P>
"For prewar Europe and the United States, our country . . . was above all the 
country of bloody, enforced collectivization, mass repressions and camps, of 
terror and dictatorship -- the country of Stalin," Popov wrote in a seminal 
article in the influential weekly Literary Gazette. 
</P>
<P>
"We must try to see our country through the eyes of the rest of the world, both 
half a century ago and today, to understand the sources of the policy of the 
Western states towards us. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"If we want to melt the ice of mistrust, then we must show an example of 
self-purification, of profound criticism of our past vices, including those of 
the not-so-long-ago past." 
</P>
<P>
A senior Western ambassador, whose service here over more than three decades 
has made him a normally cautious observer, commented after Shevardnadze's 
speech last week: "We always assume that the Soviet Union, like other 
countries, acts in its own national interests, but how it views those interests 
is changing so fast that it is hard to predict how far it will go in what is 
becoming a total transformation of its foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, the changes are now coming with such great rapidity that we cannot 
project future developments -- except that they will come faster and probably 
be greater in dimension than we expect." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials are fully aware that these changes have brought a new energy 
to international relations and are giving Moscow unprecedented opportunities to 
reshape the balance of political power. 
</P>
<P>
"The peoples of the world associate with our perestroika their hopes for peace, 
for the settlement of global problems and for the improvement of their general 
well being," Shevardnadze said. "This may flatter our national ambitions or 
irritate others, but it is a fact. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The world interprets perestroika as a living symbol of faith. It has long 
ceased to be our internal affair, and it is now seen as a truly universal 
cause. People are not indifferent to the way the process of renewal struggles 
ahead for they associate our internal stability with global stability. . . . 
There is no exaggeration here -- it is really that way." 
</P>
<P>
Changes were attempted earlier, Shevardnadze said, recalling two previous 
"thaws" in East-West relations, first under Nikita S. Khrushchev and then under 
Leonid I. Brezhnev, but they failed, first, because "a new generation not 
guilty of the notorious deformations" under Stalin had not yet come to power 
and because the country was not yet secure from foreign threat. 
</P>
<P>
Through the 1950s, '60s and even into the '70s, he said, "there was no firm 
awareness of our nation's safety.". 
</P>
<P>
"The danger of war was felt as imminent, even inevitable. This could not but 
curtail the possible reforms. We had to become assured, to get rid of our sense 
of vulnerability, if we were to appraise the present situation objectively, 
without bias." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, such fundamental changes -- and the break that they mean in Soviet history 
-- have aroused considerable opposition, Shevardnadze acknowledged in a further 
burst of candor, saying that Moscow ought to stop "pretending that all our 
disarmament actions are unanimously supported." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet-American treaty to eliminate intermediate-range missiles, a landmark 
in disarmament, had brought strong criticism of the negotiators for "having 
gone too far and conceded too much to the detriment of our defense," he said, 
citing it as an example of the continuing political resistance the Soviet 
leadership faces on defense issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, we have the treaty and live with it. Where are the critics? Soviet 
people feel more secure -- the other side has no missiles capable of hitting a 
target in the European part of the Soviet Union with the terrible accuracy of 
several meters . . . . after seven miles of flight. And the treaty helps us 
save 400 million rubles a year (about $640 million). . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Such is the price of the 'concession.' There can be no compromise without 
concessions, and there can be no accord or even diplomacy without compromise 
solutions." 
</P>
<P>
Answering other critics, Shevardnadze declared, "Our people and socialism at 
large have paid a heavy price for the notion that we can supposedly ignore the 
rest of the world and disregard the interests of others." 
</P>
<P>
The "new political thinking" is based on a "balance of interests," which 
accepts at the outset the need for compromise and thus for concessions. 
"Changes are necessary in many instances," Shevardnadze said, speaking as much 
about the Soviet Union's old friendships as its new relationships, "and if we 
want to change anything we have to sit at the negotiating table with the other 
party to reach understandings on new conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Under the triple political prism of perestroika, glasnost, or openness, and 
democratization -- all implemented largely for domestic reasons -- the changes 
in Soviet thinking on foreign policy are kaleidoscopic. 
</P>
<P>
What was indisputably right in Soviet terms a decade ago -- the invasion of 
Afghanistan or the Krasnoyarsk radar station -- became unsustainable, then 
regrettable and now finally wrong. 
</P>
<P>
And what was unthinkable, such as a non-Communist government in a Warsaw Pact 
member, the transformation of another East European country into a 
Western-style parliamentary democracy and the broad retreat from Communism as 
it has been practiced for the past 50 years, is now accepted and even praised 
as good. 
</P>
<P>
"We put forward our model of socialism for our neighbors in Europe, for China, 
for other developing countries, and now we ourselves see that it is flawed, 
deformed or even, some here say, not even socialism," another Soviet foreign 
policy specialist said this month. "So, now that Poland and Hungary seek to 
find different paths of development, how can we say anything but 'God bless' 
and wish them the best? 
</P>
<P>
"We ourselves are grappling with what socialism is, what it should be, what its 
goals should be and the means to them -- all core issues. In acknowledging our 
own errors, how can we tell others that they are wrong in wanting to go back, 
as it were, to the point from where we diverted them?" 
</P>
<P>
For many reasons, this is a touchstone issue for Moscow's "new political 
thinking." It involves Eastern Europe, first of all, but also those other 
countries, from China and North Korea to Cuba and Nicaragua, that followed the 
Soviet Union into Marxism-Leninism and those liberation movements across the 
Third World that still look to the Moscow model for guidance and inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
Almost from the time that the Bolsheviks came to power in the 1917 revolution, 
the Soviet Union has made the spread of communism one of its principal foreign 
policy goals. The Western response to what was seen as an aggressively 
expansionist and totalitarian system provided the rest of the dynamics for much 
of international relations, especially since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the U.N. General Assembly last December, Gorbachev chose this issue 
to demonstrate the break with past Soviet policy. "Freedom of choice is a 
universal principle that should allow no exceptions," he declared. Refusal to 
recognize this, he said, leads to "extremely grave consequences for world 
peace." 
</P>
<P>
Poland and Hungary have tested this Soviet commitment over the past year in 
developing their new, pluralist political systems. Moscow now expects other 
East European nations to follow and sees the need for what Shevardnadze called 
"new pivotal principles in the entire system of Soviet links with socialist 
countries." 
</P>
<P>
"We recognize every country's right to absolute freedom of choice," 
Shevardnadze said, reaffirming one of the principles of Moscow's "new political 
thinking." 
</P>
<P>
"New forces are emerging on the political scene," he continued. "They are not 
pushed forward by anyone; they appear because the people want them. This does 
not mean that these states stop being our neighbors, allies or friends. All our 
commitments remain in force. 
</P>
<P>
"One further thing is clear: We can no longer act within obsolete structures. 
Economic, scientific, technological and cultural cooperation must be 
transferred to a new basis. We understand the striving of our friends to have 
versatile, broad relations with the whole world. We ourselves are following the 
same course." 
</P>
<P>
In Warsaw, later in the week, he told Solidarity's newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza in 
confirmation of Soviet acceptance of political pluralism in Poland, "We may not 
ultimately like the fact that Poland is led by non-Communists, but we respect 
the will of the Polish nation." 
</P>
<P>
Looking at Soviet-American relations, Shevardnadze was able to focus on some of 
the early results of the foreign policy change. He characterized in almost 
rhapsodic terms the once-confrontational relationship as a "dialogue (that) has 
ascended to a new level of openness and businesslike attitudes with broad 
issues under discussion and high degree of mutual understanding and good will." 
</P>
<P>
"For all the differences in our political philosophies and world outlooks," he 
said, "the two sides . . . see their priorities and project their plans of 
action in similar categories -- going in the same direction. There is also the 
understanding that the conditions are ripe for a major new step forward." 
</P>
<P>
"Both the Soviet and the American leadership are guided by long-term prospects 
in the growing, positive and constructive cooperation in bilateral relations 
and in the whole range of world problems." 
</P>
<P>
This, quite clearly, was a partner, not an adversary, that Shevardnadze was 
speaking about. 
</P>
<P>
Another measure of Moscow's changing foreign policy came in Shevardnadze's 
discussion of relations with Cuba and Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Confirming the suspension of Soviet arms shipments to Nicaragua in support of a 
political resolution of the conflict there, Shevardnadze praised Washington for 
its "realism" nearly as much as it did the Sandinista government in Managua for 
agreeing to general elections there in February. 
</P>
<P>
Any remaining doubts were dispelled as the Soviet foreign minister called for a 
"radical improvement" in Moscow's economic relations with Cuba, saying that 
"serious work" was needed to make them profitable and that this was the "top 
priority" now in the overall relationship. 
</P>
<P>
All this, of course, depends on perestroika, how deep it goes, how long it 
lasts. 
</P>
<P>
"Major difficulties await perestroika," Shevardnadze said, "but today we can 
guarantee that it will never make a U-turn. This is essential for our foreign 
policy."

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds of club-swinging riot police on Saturday broke up a protest by more 
than 10,000 people demanding the removal of Czechoslovakia's orthodox Communist 
leader Milos Jakes and chanting, "We want another government." 
</P>
<P>
The protesters also chanted "Dialogue, dialogue," and called for the release of 
political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
It was the largest demonstration in the country since 1969, when at least 
100,000 people protested on the first anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion 
that crushed the "Prague Spring" reform movement. 
</P>
<P>
The riot police moved into Prague's central Wenceslas Square, where the crowd 
had gathered to mark the 71st anniversary of national independence. They 
quickly cleared the vast square, but demonstrators regrouped in side streets 
and other squares, chanting: "No violence!" 
</P>
<P>
Vehicles with water cannons appeared but did not hose down the crowd. Two 
ambulances rushed to the square to treat the injured. 
</P>
<P>
Police detained 250 people, state television reported, saying police had used 
"mild" means to cope with the demonstration. The official news agency CTK said 
3,000 people, among them "a number of provocateurs," tried to disrupt peace and 
order. 
</P>
<P>
Several people spread a large banner saying, "We won't have our republic 
subverted" -- a line often used by the Communists since the takeover in 1948 to 
put down dissent. It was signed by the Movement for Civil Freedom, a new 
opposition group. 
</P>
<P>
When police tried to arrest those holding the banner, the crowd fell upon them. 
One officer was severely beaten, and blood streamed down his face. 
</P>
<P>
City streets and most bridges across the Vltava River that runs through Prague 
were sealed off as sporadic demonstrations continued. Sirens wailed through the 
city and dozens of police vans raced through the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Police seized the film of several Western photographers. 
</P>
<P>
An elderly protester who overheard a Western reporter speaking English said, 
"You see our democracy in Czechoslovakia." 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the 20th Century, it is terrible," he said, making the gesture 
of a man in handcuffs. "But I have hope for the future." 
</P>
<P>
Another 4,000 people staged a peaceful protest in the provincial city of Brno 
against the hard-line leadership, witnesses said. Hundreds of police were on 
hand but did not intervene. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations were called by the Charter 77 human rights movement and four 
independent political groups. 
</P>
<P>
The organizers were encouraged by developments in East Germany, where street 
protests have forced the government to start talks with the New Forum 
opposition group. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovak party chief Jakes, who oversaw the purge of half a million 
Communists after the 1968 invasion, has refused demands for talks with 
opposition groups. 
</P>
<P>
The Prague crowd roared its approval of Charter 77 and its co-founder, banned 
playwright Vaclav Havel, who was denounced last week by Prime Minister Ladislav 
Adamec as an "absolute zero." 
</P>
<P>
"Long Live Havel!" they cheered, many waving the red, blue and white 
Czechoslovak flag. 
</P>
<P>
About two dozen supporters gathered outside the hospital where Havel is 
believed to be undergoing treatment for respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
Police detained Havel on Thursday to prevent him attending the demonstration 
but he was released after he demanded to see a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Human rights sources said other leading dissidents also were detained. 
</P>
<P>
The protest started at the top of the square when a group unfurled a large 
banner proclaiming: "We Won't Allow the Republic to Be Disrupted," a phrase 
frequently invoked by authorities who denounce critics as enemies of the state. 
</P>
<P>
Another large banner declared "Truth Will Prevail," the slogan of 
Czechoslovakia's founding president, Tomas Masaryk. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador to Czechoslovakia, Shirley Temple Black, watched from the 
sidelines. In a speech at the U.S. Embassy Friday, she praised Masaryk's 
devotion to individual liberty and said it must not be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia was founded on Oct. 28, 1918, out of territory which was 
formerly part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It was a multi-party democracy 
until the Nazi German occupation during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The Communists took power in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to thwart Saturday's rally, the government staged a show of 
military might. 
</P>
<P>
A group of 1,500 soldiers paraded through Wenceslas Square, where mobile 
missile launchers were stationed as part of an annual ceremony for new 
conscripts. It was the first time since 1949 that the ceremony was held in the 
square. 
</P>
<P>
The government forces included Interior Ministry troops who have attacked a 
series of anti-government demonstrations in the square over the past 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
Blank cannon fire rang out when a military band played the national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
"The enemies of socialism would like to exploit the difficulties that have 
become manifest and are trying to lead us off the tested path, but we shall not 
give them a chance," National Council leader Josef Kempny told the soldiers.

GONZALEZ, WIFE SHOO-INS IN SPAIN VOTING

<P>
At the rostrum, an earnestly bearded candidate is in full cry, but all seven 
photographers in the homey auditorium with butterscotch walls ignore him, 
focusing instead on a smiling schoolmarm in the first row. 
</P>
<P>
When her turn comes to promise Socialist elixir to quench Spanish political 
thirst, the graying, blue-collar crowd of 400 rises in welcome. 
</P>
<P>
"We Socialists have the spirit to win this election, and many after it," said 
companera Carmen Romero, pledging a better deal for all Spaniards, but 
particularly the disadvantaged -- the old, the poor, the women. "Schools, 
social centers, health care, the equality of opportunity -- we are opening the 
way," she said to rhythmic applause. 
</P>
<P>
In elections today, the 42-year-old Romero, a teacher-turned-First Lady, is a 
shoo-in for a seat in Spain's Parliament from this sherry-bulls-and-cork region 
of Andalusia. 
</P>
<P>
As virtually certain is the national choice of her husband, Felipe Gonzalez, to 
be Spain's prime minister for a third term. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, unless all the polls are wrong, the question is not so much if Gonzalez 
and his Socialists will win today, but by how much: Will they retain an 
absolute majority in the 350-seat Parliament or need to add a few votes in 
giant-pygmy coalition with some regional party? 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez and Romero, who by Spanish tradition uses her maiden name, are 
disparate symbols of breathtaking change in a young democracy. 
</P>
<P>
So routine are free elections now in a country that lived for more than three 
decades under dictator Francisco Franco that as many as a third of Spain's 29.5 
million registered voters may not bother to go to the polls today. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, a graying 47 whose socialism has become nominal after seven years in 
power, is running on a record of solid achievement. Rushing to catch up, once 
backward Spain is growing faster economically than all of its partners in the 
European Community. 
</P>
<P>
Despite 16% unemployment that is West Europe's highest, growth will be a solid 
5% again this year in a country that has gained 1.2 million jobs -- and nearly 
3 million cars -- since it joined the community in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, who polished his statesman's image during the campaign with an 
official visit to President Bush in Washington and as host to French President 
Francois Mitterrand, has long since scrapped his early leftist rhetoric and 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
Under Gonzalez, Spain has become increasingly active in the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization, and an outspoken advocate of the European Community, which 
is spending billions to help on badly needed infrastructural improvements. Amid 
all the development, Spanish phones whistle, Spanish trains sigh, and potholed 
national highways are decades out of date. 
</P>
<P>
Amid all the change, Romero's candidacy is a microcosm of social restructuring 
undreamed in Franco's day. Tourists here in Andalusia can still buy tiles 
painted with the inscription "Women and sardines to the kitchen," but the 
stereotyped Spanish woman, smothered in black, beads clicking, is history. 
</P>
<P>
For this election, the announced goal of the ruling Socialist Workers' Party 
was to have women candidates for one quarter of Parliament's seats. "There is a 
change of mentality. Women are incorporating themselves in political life, in 
jobs and skills that have been traditionally closed to them," said candidate 
Romero, a mother of three who grew restive as a Moncloa Palace decoration. 
</P>
<P>
By most counts, the Socialists will win around 40% of the vote today, and 
170-180 seats in Parliament, down slightly from their 44% and 184-seat showing 
in Gonzalez' 1986 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Second place will again fall to the conservative Popular Party, which, under 
Jose Maria Aznar, a 36-year-old regional politician from Valladolid making his 
national debut. Campaigning for privatization of state industry, reduced 
government spending and lower taxes, the conservatives may not keep all of the 
105 seats that they won last time. 
</P>
<P>
Aznar assumed the party leadership from Franco-linked founder Manuel Fraga less 
than two months before Gonzalez called the elections -- eight months early to 
take advantage of opposition disarray. "I did as much as I could," said Aznar 
as campaigning ended for a "day of reflection" Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Centrists under former prime minister Adolfo Suarez, 58, are unlikely to 
improve today on their 28 seats in the outgoing Parliament despite a call for 
the abolition of obligatory military service that appeals to young voters. 
</P>
<P>
The United Left, under Julio Anguila, a 48-year-old Communist and former mayor 
of Cordoba, by contrast, is expected to at least double its seven seats, thanks 
largely to disaffection among members of Socialist unions who believe that 
Gonzalez has sold out to unchecked capitalism.

ISRAELIS SEE BASIC MISCALCULATION BY U.S.; 
</P>
<P>
MIDEAST: SHAMIR AIDES SAY HE IS NOT LOOKING FOR A FACE-SAVING WAY TO INCLUDE 
THE PLO IN PEACE TALKS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's government are searching 
doggedly for a way to avoid a confrontation with the Bush Administration over 
approaches to peace in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
But top aides to Shamir say that the effort is hampered by what they view as a 
basic miscalculation by American officials, and notably by Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III, about Shamir's willingness to change his mind on issues 
regarding talks with Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
The issue at stake, as it has been for the past year, is whether Israel will 
sit down with the Palestine Liberation Organization and negotiate a settlement 
to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens sent a list of proposed modifications 
to a plan advanced by Baker to get talks leading to a Palestinian-Israeli 
dialogue under way. The Israeli government hopes that the changes will be 
accepted and that a showdown between Shamir and the U.S. Administration will be 
avoided as a mid-November date for a Shamir-Bush meeting approaches. 
</P>
<P>
Senior aides to the combative prime minister assert that the Bush 
Administration is assuming that Shamir is looking for a face-saving formula to 
open talks with the PLO. Washington supposes that Shamir remains opposed to 
talks with the PLO because of domestic political pressures reflected in a need 
to keep his own Likud Party in line behind his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
That is not the case, Shamir's advisers insist. Shamir firmly opposes such 
talks, not for reasons of convenience but from conviction. Thus, the U.S. 
effort to obscure PLO involvement in talks is bound to fail, the advisers add. 
</P>
<P>
"The impression we get is that the United States believes that the prime 
minister is looking for a cover to make talks with the PLO possible," said 
Yosef Ben Aharon, one of Shamir's closest political associates. "It is not so." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's objection is based primarily on the PLO's demand for setting up an 
independent state in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israel argues such 
a state would threaten Israel's security. 
</P>
<P>
Baker has presented Israel with a five-point proposal to be discussed at a 
meeting attended by Israel, Egypt and the United States. The meeting of the 
three would be aimed at working out the formation of a Palestinian peace 
delegation. The latter panel would discuss with Israel details for putting into 
effect Israel's plan for West Bank and Gaza elections. 
</P>
<P>
According to Baker's plan, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, Israel 
would meet with Palestinians in Cairo. Egypt would not sit in for the 
Palestinians; rather, Israel would meet a selected panel "after a satisfactory 
list of Palestinians has been worked out." The Palestinians "would be free to 
raise issues that relate to their opinions on how to make elections and 
negotiations succeed." 
</P>
<P>
Advisers to Shamir say that the plan undermines Israel's election proposal 
because it leaves loopholes that guarantee participation by the PLO -- this 
even though the name of the organization is not mentioned. Once the PLO is 
seated at talks, the advisers contend, follow-up elections would only serve to 
ratify the organization's de facto leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to draw the line," said Ben Aharon. "We have to ensure that no 
legitimacy is given to the PLO." 
</P>
<P>
To close the loopholes, Israel has suggested three changes: 
</P>
<P>
In Point 1, which calls for the eventual formation of a "Palestinian 
delegation," Israel wants the wording altered to read a delegation from "Judea, 
Samaria and Gaza, hereafter referred to as Palestinians." Judea and Samaria are 
biblical names for the region covered by the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The change has at least two important meanings. First, it would limit the 
Palestinian panel to residents of the occupied land, in keeping with Israel's 
desire to talk only with local Arabs. And two, in Israeli political language, 
the terms Judea and Samaria indicate a historic claim to the occupied land. 
</P>
<P>
In Point 3, Shamir is asking for Israel to be given an explicit veto over 
selection of the Palestinian panel to ensure no PLO involvement. Under Baker's 
formula, the Palestinian delegation would be formed in consultation with 
Israel. Israel wants wording that says Israeli agreement must be sought. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Point 4 of Baker's plan says, twice, that Palestinians would be able 
to discuss "elections and negotiations." In the Israeli government's opinion, 
the word negotiations opens the way for Palestinians to raise demands for 
statehood, an issue Israel is unwilling to discuss. Shamir wants the reference 
to talks eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
There is no indication yet that Baker is willing to accede to the Israeli 
demands. On Saturday, Israel Radio reported that the United States had agreed 
to an Israeli veto over the makeup of the Palestinian delegation, but officials 
here and in Washington denied that any such accord had been reached. 
</P>
<P>
Confirming that Israel had asked for "a number of changes," a senior State 
Department official in Washington said, "This is not nailed down, and it 
remains to be seen if it can be nailed down." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, officials close to Shamir are chafing under what they call 
Washington's "therapy diplomacy," aimed at persuading Shamir that, in his heart 
of hearts, he really wants to talk to the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bush Administration thinks it is helping Shamir overcome psychological 
barriers, letting him see the light present in his own soul. Well, we don't 
need a psychiatrist, thank you," the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
They point out that neither Baker nor his spokesmen ever says just who are the 
Palestinians with whom Israel is supposed to meet. Israel suspects it's the 
PLO. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 15, Shamir sent a letter to Baker in which he insisted that Palestinian 
participation be limited to residents of the West Bank and Gaza. During the 
summer, the United States suggested that Palestinians living abroad be let in 
on the talks, a move that Shamir believes is a cover for PLO entry. 
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to prevent such a development at all costs," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the Shamir-Bush meeting, the Israeli government has launched 
the latest in a series of public relations campaigns aimed at persuading 
Washington to break off its own dialogue with the PLO. Israel has compiled a 
report listing alleged instances of terror in Israel and the occupied lands 
ordered by the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials are suspicious that the Americans are carrying out their own 
campaign to put pressure on Israel by leaking embarrassing news to the U.S. 
media. A report on NBC that Israel had helped South Africa build a ballistic 
missile is seen as one example. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FIVE POINTS FOR PEACE 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III has presented Israel with a five-point 
proposal to be discussed at a meeting attended by Israel, Egypt and the United 
States. These are the five points: 
</P>
<P>
 The United States understands that because Egypt and Israel have been working 
hard in the peace process, there is agreement that an Israeli delegation should 
conduct a dialogue with a Palestinian delegation in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
The United States understands that Egypt cannot substitute itself for the 
Palestinians, and Egypt will consult with Palestinians on all aspects of that 
dialogue. Egypt will also consult with Israel and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The United States understands that Israel will attend the dialogue only after a 
satisfactory list of Palestinians has been worked out. Israel will also consult 
with Egypt and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The United States understands that the government of Israel will come to the 
dialogue on the basis of the government of Israel's May 14 initiative. The 
United States further understands that Palestinians will come to the dialogue 
prepared to discuss elections and negotiations in accordance with Israel's 
initiative. The United States understands, therefore, that Palestinians would 
be free to raise issues that relate to their opinions on how to make elections 
and negotiations succeed. 
</P>
<P>
In order to facilitate this process, the United States proposes that the 
foreign ministers of Israel, Egypt and the United States meet in Washington 
within two weeks.

INTIFADA'S 'SHOCK TROOPS' MASKED; 
</P>
<P>
ISRAEL: PALESTINIANS CLING TO IT AS A SHOW OF POWER AND DEFIANCE; AUTHORITIES 
SEE IT AS A SINISTER SYMBOL.

<P>
In the end, the dispute over the circumstances of the killing of Nidal Habash, 
a 21-year-old Palestinian business student, centered not on whether he was 
throwing stones or gasoline bombs or anything else, or whether he was a 
terrorist. It all came down to whether he wore a mask. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian witnesses say that the slender youth had pulled off his red mask 
and surrendered, hands up, to an Israeli soldier who had shot him in the legs 
and then, while the youth lay prone, shot him three times in the stomach from 
close range. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli army officials say the youth was masked, and thus fair game for 
pursuing troops. They deny he had surrendered and consider the case closed, 
despite calls by a British diplomat and an Israeli human rights group for an 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
That a mask should be the main focus of debate is indicative of the 
increasingly unpredictable course of the Arab uprising against Israeli rule and 
Israel's response to it. Perspective is the latest casualty: A man is killed 
and everyone wonders if he was masked or not. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli military officials have seized on the mask as a sinister symbol of the 
violent underside of the intifada, as the Arabs call the uprising. They have 
given soldiers permission to open fire on anyone in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip wearing a mask, be it a hood or a wraparound scarf. The soldiers are 
supposed to aim at the legs. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the masked Palestinians) are the hard core facing the security forces in 
their war against the uprising," Amnon Strashnow, the army's advocate general, 
recently told Israeli reporters. "They oil the wheels of the uprising." 
</P>
<P>
Strashnow said the new firing orders had been approved by the Justice Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
The intifada is entering its 23rd month. Almost 600 Palestinians have died, 
most of them from Israeli rifle fire but occasionally from beatings. Another 
125 Palestinians have been killed by nationalist militants as suspected 
collaborators with the Israeli authorities. Diplomacy designed to bring 
together Israeli and Palestinian negotiators is at a standstill. 
</P>
<P>
Rebel Palestinians cling to the mask as a show of power and defiance despite 
the evident danger in wearing it. If anything, the danger seems to add glamour, 
especially among the young. 
</P>
<P>
"People know they can depend on us. They know we are willing to face death," 
said a young activist who gave the false name of Arafat. Among the general 
population, such youths are known simply as munafthamiin -- "masked ones." 
</P>
<P>
Nablus, a city that is considered by both sides to be the white-hot core of the 
uprising, was where the elaborate use of masks was pioneered. It was here that 
the traditional Arab scarf known as the kaffiyeh gave way to a variety of hoods 
-- first garbage bags with holes poked in them, later knitted hoods decorated 
with nationalistic designs. 
</P>
<P>
Youths parade in neighborhood "armies," sometimes with homemade sabers, clubs 
and maces. Color codes often identify the wearer with rebel factions: black and 
white for Fatah, the main faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization 
headed by Yasser Arafat; red and white for the Popular Front for the Liberation 
of Palestine, a doctrinaire Marxist PLO group, and black with a green stripe 
for Hamas, an Islamic movement opposed to Israeli rule in any part of historic 
Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
Red, white, green and black Palestinian flags are converted into ready-to-wear 
masks; the munafthamiin also stitch the colors into the checked pattern of the 
kaffiyeh or around the eye holes of hoods. 
</P>
<P>
In a pinch, offbeat disguises will do. Halloween-style gorilla masks are a 
favorite in some villages. 
</P>
<P>
In practical terms, the rebel youth embrace the mask as protection for 
themselves against the preying eyes of informers or the Israeli cameras that 
photograph demonstrators from rooftop outposts in cities and towns. 
</P>
<P>
They also feel the need to spare relatives and associates who are not directly 
involved from the consequences of their acts -- interrogation, harassment, 
sometimes even the demolition of a family home by the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"The boys have to defend themselves even against people they know. Why should 
they expose even their relatives to questioning by Israeli interrogators by 
letting their deeds be viewed publicly? It is better for no one to see," said 
an activist in Nablus. 
</P>
<P>
There is a story circulating in the West Bank and Gaza that illuminates the 
double life of activists and their use of masks. A group of masked youths 
confronted a man over his possession of an Israeli-issued identification card. 
The youths were collecting and destroying the cards in order to discourage 
Palestinians from cooperating in any way with the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The man denied he had been issued a card. 
</P>
<P>
"Give it over," the youths insisted, but the man persisted in his denials. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, one of the boys pulled off his mask and said, "Papa, give them the 
card." 
</P>
<P>
The psychological power that a mask confers may be the most compelling reason 
for the Palestinians to ignore the danger of using it. 
</P>
<P>
"They feel like someone else. It is like Clark Kent changing into Superman. The 
powerless become powerful," explained a college professor in Nablus. "It is no 
longer just little Ahmed, the baker's son, who is out in the streets. It is 
Ahmed the masked one, part of a group and a movement." 
</P>
<P>
The masks also have historical significance for the Palestinians. During 
revolts against British rule of Palestine in the 1920s, dashing horsemen 
wearing kaffiyehs around their faces became the romantic symbol of resistance. 
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians believe they link themselves with this past by wearing 
masks," commented Daoud Kutab, a nationalist journalist. 
</P>
<P>
The authorization from the Israeli government to shoot at anyone masked is only 
the latest policy adjustment designed to force an end to the intifada while 
keeping the repression palatable to Israeli society. During the past year, 
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin has issued a series of rulings liberalizing the 
conditions under which soldiers may open fire, with ammunition that has ranged 
from live lead-tipped rounds to plastic bullets -- really a blend of plastic 
and metal effective up to 80 yards -- to rubber-covered metal balls. 
</P>
<P>
There has been little public outcry over the order on mask wearers, which was 
handed down earlier this month. Some observers contend that Israelis, sedated 
by the endless rhythm of the intifada, no longer pay attention to the daily 
violence in the West Bank and Gaza. Others contend that the masks themselves, 
by distancing the person behind the disguise from outsiders, make it easier for 
Israelis to accept the increasing bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
"The masks erase the personality of the Palestinians and emphasize the presence 
of them as a group," remarked Yaron Ezrahi, a political theorist at Hebrew 
University. "The masks are the uniform of the intifada, and it always easier to 
shoot at uniforms than at people whose clothing suggests individuality." 
</P>
<P>
Ezrahi pointed out that in the collective memory of recent Israeli history, 
masks are a particularly powerful symbol of the harm that some Palestinian 
groups have done to innocent Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I hear about the masks, my mind flashes to the photo of the 
terrorist standing on the balcony of the dormitory at the Munich Olympics 
during the killing of Israeli athletes," Ezrahi noted, referring to 1972. 
</P>
<P>
The war on masks comes against a backdrop of generally tougher measures taken 
by the Israeli army against any forms of resistance to Israel's occupation. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli jails now hold 13,000 Palestinians, including thousands who are 
detained for periods of up to a year without trial. Towns and villages are 
placed under curfew for days and even weeks at a time. Property is confiscated 
and phone lines and even water supplies cut in punishment for protests or stone 
throwing or for not paying taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the cities and towns in the West Bank, Nablus is the one closest to a 
state of full-scale insurgency, albeit one still without weapons to face the 
M-16 rifles of the Israelis stationed in and around the city. 
</P>
<P>
For months, many of the demonstrations and stone throwing took place mainly in 
the Old City, a rambling quarter of crumbling arches and labyrinthine alleys. 
But as the army cracked down hard on the neighborhood -- soldiers once blew up 
two houses belonging to the families of rebels who dropped a brick on the head 
of a soldier and killed him -- the action moved to the other end of the steep 
valley city. 
</P>
<P>
According to an independent count, 20 residents, mostly teen-agers and mostly 
masked, have been killed in Nablus during the past two months. Israeli human 
rights groups estimate that more than 100 Nablusis have died in the uprising, 
meaning more than one in six of the Palestinian fatalities has occurred in this 
city of 120,000. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the well-to-do Nablus neighborhood of Rafidia, on Oct. 9, following a 
parade of masked youths, that a soldier shot down Habash in a vacant lot after 
the army had scattered the youths and pursued stragglers. The marchers were 
identified as belonging to the Popular Front. Army spokesmen said they were 
inciting residents to riot. 
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked," recalled Asma Masri, who watched the shooting from the balcony 
of an apartment building that overlooks the field. "He had his hands up and a 
soldier fired from about 50 yards. The boy fell and the soldier approached 
slowly until he was about 10 yards away. Then he fired three more times." 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials justify the tougher measures by pointing to the increasing 
incidents of violence by Arabs against Arabs. The attacks on collaborators, 
they insist, are meant to keep Palestinians from freely accepting the 
government's proposals for election and local self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
"If one of these youths is walking in the streets, I don't have to wait until I 
find two alleged collaborators murdered in that area the next day," said 
Strashnow, the army's advocate general. 
</P>
<P>
Nablus, along with the Gaza Strip, has become known as a grim center of such 
reprisals, against both suspected collaborators and Arabs accused of crimes 
against morality such as drug trafficking and prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, the underground leadership of the uprising gave the green light 
for assassinations on the grounds that it was necessary to protect rebel 
organizers in the face of mass roundups and the increasing threat of 
assassination by soldiers and plainclothes agents. 
</P>
<P>
The killings quickly got out of hand. Over the summer, about 80 Palestinians 
were killed by other Palestinians; until then the total of such assassinations 
had only reached 20. Some of the reprisal squads even turned to crime and 
intimidation. In response, two masked groups were formed to control them. But 
the intifada leaders soon lost control of these vigilante groups and some 
weeks, they killed more Arabs than the Israelis did. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, a debate broke out last week over whether soldiers should be 
given leeway to shoot at masked Palestinians who live in mainly Arab East 
Jerusalem, which was fully annexed to Israel in 1967. Police Chief Haim Bar-Lev 
opposed any such order because, he said, full Israeli law applies in the city 
and there is no statute that would permit such liberal firing orders. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not reached the conclusion that a law should be initiated that makes 
it possible to open fire on a man with a mask in sovereign Israeli territory," 
the police chief said, referring to the Palestinians as simply "people with 
masks." 
</P>
<P>
Rightists who are pressing the army to do more to crush the uprising argued 
that there is no reason to exclude Jerusalem Arabs from the deadly consequences 
of wearing a mask in occupied areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything possible must be done in order to make clear to the masked men and 
those behind them that Israel will not reconcile itself to these and similar 
phenomena in East Jerusalem as in other places under its control," the rightist 
religious newspaper Hatzofeh declared. "We must stop this forgiving approach, 
see the phenomenon of masked men in all its severity and not treat them as 'men 
with masks.' " 
</P>
<P>
For all kinds of men with masks, the coming winter could be the most dangerous 
season of all. Arabs commonly wrap their faces with kaffiyehs as a protection 
against the chill wet winds of the Holy Land.

IOWA AIR CRASH LAID TO METALLURGICAL FLAW; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATION: TESTS PERFORMED ON TAIL ENGINE PART CONFIRM THE ROOT CAUSE OF 
THE ACCIDENT.

A tiny metallurgical flaw that developed 19 years ago in a Nevada plant led to 
the explosion of a tail engine and the crash of United Airlines Flight 232 in 
Sioux City, Iowa, last July, a federal official said Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators were able to determine the root cause of the accident, which 
killed 112 of 296 people on board the DC-10, after performing tests on an 
engine part found earlier this month in an Iowa cornfield. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony J. Broderick, acting executive director of the Federal Aviation 
Administration, said the flaw was detected in a 300-pound titanium disk that 
spins the blades in the engine's forward fan assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick, confirming a report by the Washington Post, said the imperfection 
developed when the titanium was manufactured in 1970 at the Henderson, Nev., 
plant of Timet, a division of the Titanium Metals Corp. of America. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA, which had suspected a metallurgical flaw even before tests confirmed 
it this week, recently ordered an examination of 232 other titanium disks that 
may have developed similar problems. 
</P>
<P>
The tests on those disks will not be completed until February. Broderick said 
that irregularities already have been found in two of the disks and that 
further tests are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
A federal hearing in Sioux City on Tuesday will seek to determine whether the 
problem could have been detected before the crash and whether a recurrence of 
the unprecedented explosion of the United engine can be prevented. 
</P>
<P>
The engine's disk ruptured after the metallurgical flaw led to the development 
of fatigue cracks, Broderick said. 
</P>
<P>
The titanium for the disk was manufactured in a process called "double 
melting." This involves reducing the metal to a liquid to remove impurities. 
About 15 years ago, the industry switched to "triple melting," decreasing the 
likelihood of metal flaws tenfold, to fewer than 1 per million pounds of 
titanium produced, Broderick said. 
</P>
<P>
A microscopic change in the metal's crystalline structure produces a knotty 
imperfection known as a "hard alpha." The flaw cannot be detected in tests but 
a new ultrasonic probe can pick up cracks that grow from the flaw, Broderick 
said. With the disk submerged in water and high frequency sound waves, 
computers can analyze any irregularities in the echoes. 
</P>
<P>
"At some point after the melting, cracking develops," Broderick said in 
describing what happened to the United disk. "And those cracks can be the 
source of fatigue cracks. The growth of the fatigue cracks caused the problem. 
We are quite confident that the testing we are doing now will weed out any 
possible defective disks." 
</P>
<P>
The metal produced by Timet was forged by the Aluminum Co. of America. GE 
Engines, a division of General Electric Co., finished the part in 1972 and 
assembled the engines. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the companies could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
After its engine exploded in flight, cutting the plane's hydraulic lines, the 
United aircraft spiraled toward Sioux City, almost totally out of control. 
Debris from the exploding engine pierced the tail and severed hydraulic cables 
that control altitude and direction. By increasing the thrust of one of the 
wing-mounted engines and reducing it in the other, Capt. Alfred C. Haynes was 
able to turn the plane slightly. 
</P>
<P>
The jumbo jet cartwheeled on the runway, broke apart and burst into flames.

Hundreds of mourners, including Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and Boston Mayor 
Raymond L. Flynn, packed a church Saturday for the emotional funeral of a 
pregnant woman whose slaying has rocked Greater Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Friends and family members at St. James Church in suburban Medford read aloud 
messages of love and grief over the loss of Carol Stuart, 30. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart was seven months pregnant when she and her husband, Charles Stuart, 29, 
were abducted, robbed and shot Monday night shortly after leaving a birthing 
class at a Boston hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The husband, unable to attend the funeral because he was hospitalized with a 
bullet wound to the abdomen, sent a message from Boston City Hospital that was 
read aloud by a family friend. 
</P>
<P>
"Good night sweet wife, my love. God has called you to his hands. Not to take 
you away from me, but to bring you away from the cruelty and the violence that 
fills this world," the message said. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Stuart's brother, Carl DiMaiti, spoke at the service, saying: "Sweet 
dreams, little sister. I know you're in heaven waiting for each and every one 
of us. We love you; we miss you; we'll never forget you." 
</P>
<P>
The Stuarts had just left the birthing class at Brigham and Women's Hospital 
when a man climbed into their car, forced them to drive to Boston's Mission 
Hill area, robbed them and then shot them before fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Stuart was shot in the head and died that night after a son, who has been 
named Christopher, was delivered two months prematurely by Cesarean section. 
The baby was in the neonatal intensive care unit at Brigham and Women's. 
Charles Stuart was described as being in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn, Dukakis, Boston Police Commissioner Francis Roache and Cardinal Bernard 
F. Law all attended the service at the picturesque brick church. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting has prompted anger from Boston officials, police and area 
residents and has touched off a renewed push for the death penalty in 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
Boston police said they were able to obtain a detailed description of the 
gunman from Charles Stuart and have narrowed their list of suspects to three or 
four.

PEDESTRIAN SPAN COLLAPSES AFTER BEING ROCKED; 5 DIE

A pedestrian bridge with as many as 50 people on it collapsed Saturday 
afternoon, killing five people and seriously injuring 18, after some rocked the 
span back and forth, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
One other person was believed missing after the 50-foot-high, 200- to 
300-foot-long steel suspension bridge fell into the Little Red River in 
north-central Arkansas, said Wayne Milligan of the Cleburne County Sheriff's 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
Rescue crews used chain saws and cranes to remove the tangled remains of the 
77-year-old bridge as darkness fell. 
</P>
<P>
There were 30 to 50 people on the popular bridge, including members of a church 
group from nearby Prim for their annual meeting and a Boy Scout troop, when the 
accident occurred, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the people rocked the span, Milligan said. "The cable on the upstream 
side broke and the bridge fell to one side. The other cable broke, and the 
whole thing came down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had just gotten here, and they were rocking the bridge," said Daniel 
Rafferty of Seymour, Mo., who was part of the Free Holiness church group. "We 
thought it was kind of fun, and it scared some people." 
</P>
<P>
The collapse "just happened so quickly that no one had a chance to cry for 
help," he said. " . . . They didn't know what happened. It was pure terror. 
Arms were flailing. People were panicking. Everyone was trying to save 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen people were taken to Cleburne County Memorial Hospital in Heber 
Springs, 5 miles northwest of the bridge, hospital administrator George Fray 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the injuries were broken bones," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nine people were hospitalized, including three who were transferred to a 
hospital in Little Rock nearly 60 miles to the southeast and three who went to 
a hospital in Searcy nearly 20 miles southeast of Heber Springs, Fray said. The 
remaining nine were treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
Ambulances from three neighboring counties helped take the injured to 
hospitals, county dispatcher Gary Hooten said. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, there were so many injured, people were taking them to the hospital 
in personal cars and police cars," Hooten said. 
</P>
<P>
The bridge was built in 1912, Milligan said. It was closed to vehicles in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kept as a walking bridge," said Polly Burkeen, whose Swinging Bridge 
Boat Dock sits below the span. "It was placed on the National Register of 
Historic Places four years ago."

FLORIDA RESTAURANT LOAN SCHEME GOES SOUR

Law enforcement authorities say pension-fund officials who have little loyalty 
to their members are especially vulnerable to the sort of approach that Florida 
businessman Leonard J. Mercer Jr. used on his friend, Joseph J. Higgins. 
</P>
<P>
Mercer, a Ft. Lauderdale hotel owner, told Higgins that he needed $375,000 to 
purchase the Ta-Boo, a Palm Beach restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Higgins had access to that much money and more. He had been retained by New 
Jersey Teamsters Local 701 to invest $20 million worth of union pension funds 
in residential and commercial loans. 
</P>
<P>
But Higgins told Mercer that union rules, which were designed to protect 
members, restricted how Higgins' company, Omni Funding Group Inc., could invest 
the Teamsters' pension funds. In particular, no funds could be placed in 
high-risk ventures such as bars, restaurants and bowling alleys. 
</P>
<P>
According to federal court records, Mercer then devised a scheme for Omni 
Funding to advance him the money under the guise that it would be used to 
refinance his hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Omni provided the loan and submitted false reports about it to the Teamsters 
local, which forwarded them to the U.S. Labor Department. In return, Mercer 
paid $42,500 in kickbacks to Higgins in the form of cash, free hotel suites, 
meals and other gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Reporting false information about pension-fund loans is a violation of the 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which Congress passed in 1974 to 
tighten up supervision over pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on an insider's tip, the Labor Department's Office of Labor 
Racketeering, in conjunction with the U.S. attorney's office in Miami, launched 
a criminal investigation into Mercer and Higgins that led to guilty pleas by 
both men and their eventual imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
Mercer pleaded guilty to kickback charges as well as perjury for lying to a 
federal grand jury when he testified that Higgins had paid for his stays at 
Galt Ocean Mile Hotel, which Mercer owned. Identified by the Pennsylvania Crime 
Commission as a longtime associate of Philadelphia mob figures, Mercer received 
four years in prison and a $40,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate court appearance, Higgins pleaded guilty to perjury, wire fraud 
and mail fraud and was sentenced to eight years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Two trustees and two lawyers for the Teamsters' New Jersey pension fund also 
were eventually implicated in similar corrupt dealings with Higgins. One of 
those implicated pleaded guilty and the other three were convicted of 
racketeering and mail fraud. 
</P>
<P>
And nothing worked out for Mercer. Before he went off to jail last spring, his 
hotel and restaurant went bankrupt.

HANDICAPPING HOLLYWOOD'S YULE DASH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Cinema Paradiso." Note the title, write it down on your Christmas calendar, 
consider it a little surprise gift that you can unwrap yourself during the 
holidays. Do it now because once the onslaught of advertising and publicity for 
the major studio Christmas fare begins, it will be hard for independent movies 
-- even those of gem quality -- to shine through. 
</P>
<P>
"Cinema Paradiso," or "Paradise Theater," is the story of a successful Italian 
filmmaker who is led by the death of an old friend into reflecting on his 
childhood in a small town in Italy where the lone movie house served as both 
the community's social center and its window on the real and romanticized 
worlds outside. 
</P>
<P>
The movie focuses on the relationship between a young boy and the man who runs 
the theater, but it is more a tribute to the allure and power of film itself. 
It's a reminder of those seminal moments when those of us who have come to love 
movies first felt the tug. "Cinema Paradiso" was one of the hits of this year's 
Cannes Film Festival and is being delivered on these shores by independent 
Miramax Film just in time for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hollywood has a whole new generation of moviegoers to romance and 
this Christmas, major studios are sending out more than a dozen movies aimed at 
seducing them. Sixteen pictures are now set to open nationally between Nov. 17 
and Christmas. More than a half-dozen others will be given limited send-offs in 
order to qualify for the next important event, the Oscar Derby. A scattering of 
others -- "Cinema Paradiso" and Cinecom's "Handmaid's Tale" among them -- will 
try to be heard above the din. 
</P>
<P>
Much weeping and gnashing of teeth occurs in studio suites whenever attempts to 
handicap the Christmas field make their way into print. But given the amount of 
horse manure that accompanies the release of most movies, and the frequency 
with which marketing people go to their whips during the holiday run, a horse 
race is pretty much what it has become. 
</P>
<P>
So, with the educated opinions of well-placed industry experts, plus eyewitness 
reports from a handful of early screenings, the careful reading of career 
curves and the usual seat-of-the-pants guesswork, here's one touter's look at 
how Hollywood's last Christmas of the '80s will finish at the box office.

Back to the Future II, (Universal Pictures, release date, Nov. 22): Time travel 
has always been an intriguing theme for film makers, but rarely has it worked 
as well as in the 1985 "Back to the Future," in which Marty McFly (Michael J. 
Fox) went back in time to help his parents fall in love so they could get 
married and have him. The series could go on forever, and may. In Part 2, Marty 
goes into the future for his time-warped adventure. Part 3 (all three episodes 
are directed by Robert Zemeckis) is currently being shot in northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Harlem Nights (Paramount, Nov. 17). Eddie Murphy is one of the modern screen's 
only true movie stars, a star being defined as someone who can draw crowds even 
to a bad movie, which most of his have been. Murphy is the writer, director and 
executive producer of this film, as well as its star, and is working with what 
he says is a personal passion -- the music and people of 1930s Harlem. The 
story is set in a Harlem nightclub that is run by Murphy and a partner/mentor 
played by Richard Pryor, with help on the floor from a croupier played by Redd 
Foxx, and challenged from the outside by racketeers and crooked cops. There's a 
fresh score from Herbie Hancock, and plenty of classics from the likes of Duke 
Ellington and Louis Armstrong. The soundtrack, at least, ought to be great. 
</P>
<P>
Always (Universal, Dec. 15). Steven Spielberg directed this remake/adaptation 
of Victor Fleming's 1942 "A Guy Named Joe," and when Spielberg directs, people 
watch. Part romantic adventure, part fantasy, it stars Richard Dreyfuss as a 
daredevil pilot who flies to his death while fighting a forest fire in the 
Northwest, only to be returned to duty as the guardian angel for a young pilot 
played by newcomer Brad Johnson (Van Johnson was discovered in that role the 
first time around). Holly Hunter ("Broadcast News") plays Dreyfuss' wife; the 
part was originally played by Irene Dunne. 
</P>
<P>
The Little Mermaid (Disney, Nov. 17) and All Dogs Go to Heaven (MGM, Nov. 17). 
The studios won't like it, but we'll pair them here as an entry since they 
represent the complete resurgence of classical animation and will undoubtedly 
scoop up more than $100 million in box office receipts between them. "Little 
Mermaid," based on the Hans Christian Anderson story about a mermaid who falls 
in love with a man (shades of "Splash!), is Disney's first animated fairy tale 
in 30 years, and the studio was so excited about it that it began screening the 
film in rough cut form for critics months ago. Credit for part of the new 
revived commitment to animation at Disney goes to former Disney animator Don 
Bluth, who led an animation department mutiny at the Burbank studio 10 years 
ago, and eventually set up a studio in Dublin. "All Dogs Go to Heaven" is the 
third Bluth film sent home from Ireland ("An American Tail" and "The Land 
Before Time" preceded it) to compete head-to-head with his old studio. 
</P>
<P>
She-Devil (Orion, Dec. 8). Meryl Streep and Rosanne Barr -- an elegantly 
serious actress with limited box office appeal and a slovenly comedian with 
immense TV ratings -- are both cast against type in a dark comedy about a 
discarded wife (Barr) plotting revenge against her husband (Ed Begley Jr.) and 
his new toy (Streep). The film could move way up or way down on the box office 
list, depending on how well the casting takes. Orion, which had no hits during 
Hollywood's recent record-shattering summer, badly needs one now. 
</P>
<P>
Steel Magnolias (Tri-Star, Nov. 17). Robert Harling's hit stage play about the 
events in the lives of six Southern women who congregate at a residential 
beauty parlor has, under the direction of Herbert Ross, become a movie with the 
sentimental aspirations of "Terms of Endearment." The high-powered cast 
includes hairdresser Dolly Parton, her assistant Daryl Hannah, the diabetic 
beauty Julia Roberts and her baleful mother Sally Field, grumpy neighbor 
Shirley MacLaine and the proper widow Olympia Dukakis. Dukakis and Field share 
the kind of scene in the final reel that usually brings Oscar nominations. 
</P>
<P>
War of the Roses (Fox, Dec. 8). After 18 years of a seemingly perfect marriage, 
Washington, D.C.'s most enviable couple -- Oliver and Barbara Rose (Michael 
Douglas and Kathleen Turner) -- decide they have in nothing in common except 
their mutual admiration for their house. With Oliver's law school buddy (Danny 
DeVito) serving as his divorce lawyer, the house becomes a battleground. 
DeVito, reunited here with his "Romancing the Stone" co-stars, also directs the 
dark comedy adapted from a Warren Adler novel. 
</P>
<P>
National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (Warner Bros., Dec. 1). For whatever 
reason, Chevy Chase is a star (see above definition) and this formula comedy, 
in which Chase's well-intentioned bumbling dad Clark Griswold leads his family 
into a series of sit-com disasters, has found a large audience. Its steady 
customers will get it off to a fast start, but it should fade quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Blaze (Touchstone, Dec. 13). Paul Newman and newcomer Lolita Davidovich co-star 
as Louisiana Governor Earl Long and the stripper, Blaze Starr, who brought him 
down. Ron Shelton had the hot land last summer, as writer and director of the 
baseball comedy "Bull Durham," but sex scandals are a whole new ball game. 
</P>
<P>
Family Business (Tri-Star, Dec. 22). Sean Connery, Dustin Hoffman and Matthew 
Broderick are the grandfather, father and grandson who plan a low-risk, 
high-return robbery in this drama directed by Sidney Lumet. Lumet has been hot 
and cold in recent years, but he's still one of the most gifted directors of 
drama around and the cast is certainly hot. 
</P>
<P>
Tango and Cash (Warner Bros., Dec. 15). Does Sony know about this? Before 
producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters signed their five-year pact with Warner 
Bros., and before they agreed to run Columbia Pictures for its new Japanese 
owner, long before Sony and Warner Bros. began suing each other over the rights 
to Guber-Peters, the celebrated producers hatched this oddly cast prison drama 
co-starring Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell. As negotiations went on behind 
closed doors at Sony and Columbia, "Tango and Cash" was reportedly going wildly 
off track. Director Andrei Konchalovsky ("Runaway Train") was replaced three 
months into filming by Albert Magnoli ("Purple Rain"), reportedly after 
refusing to sacrifice major scenes in order to make the Christmas deadline, and 
sources say the budget has escalated past the $50 million mark. 
</P>
<P>
The Wizard (Universal, Dec. 15). This road story about a young teen-ager (Fred 
Savage from TV's "The Wonder Years") who discovers that his dysfunctional 
half-brother (Luke Edwards) is a genious at video games sounds like an 
adolescent version of "Rain Man." It also sounds like an attempt to tap that 
shrinking youth audience that has begun to let Hollywood down. 
</P>
<P>
We're No Angels (Paramount, Dec. 1). Robert De Niro and Sean Penn together in a 
comedy? Don't laugh. De Niro was hilarious in last year's "Midnight Run" and 
Penn, in his break-out performance, was a riot in "Fast Times at Ridgemont 
High." With a script by David Mamet and the direction of Neil Jordan ("Mona 
Lisa"), this chase film about two escaped cons and the Molly (Demi Moore) they 
encounter on the road is the dark horse of the Christmas field. 
</P>
<P>
Prancer, (Orion, Nov. 22). Family films are hot, and a family film with a 
holiday hook could be very hot. Newcomer Rebecca Harrell stars as a young girl 
who rescues a wounded reindeer thinking it belongs to Santa and tries to nurse 
it back to health before the all-important Christmas Eve flight. Sam Elliott 
plays her father and Cloris Leachman is the (rhymes with witch) who runs the 
local park. 
</P>
<P>
Among the films going into limited release before Dec. 31 to qualify for the 
Academy Awards: 
</P>
<P>
Valmont (Orion, Nov. 17). Milos Forman's first film since "Amadeus" will 
inevitably be compared to Stephen Frears' "Dangerous Liaisons," which earned an 
assortment of Oscar nominations last year. Eyewitnesses say Forman's film is 
vastly richer in texture to Frears' film, but the performances -- Colin Firth 
as Valmont, Meg Tilley as Madame de Tourvel, and newcomer Annette Bening as the 
Marquise de Merteuil -- will be unfairly weighed against those of John 
Malkovich, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Glenn Close in last year's film. 
</P>
<P>
Glory (Tri-Star, Dec. 13). Edward Zwick directs this historical Civil War drama 
about the North's first black infantry regiment which was led into battle 
against the South by a white officer (Matthew Broderick). The ensemble cast 
also includes Denzel Washington and Jane Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
Enemies, a Love Story (Fox, Dec. 15). Co-writer and director Paul Mazursky 
adapts Isaac Bashevis Singer's 1972 post-World War II novel about a Jewish 
emigree (Ron Silver) whose new life in New York City is complicated by the 
three women -- two wives (Anjelica Huston and Margaret Sophie Stein) and a 
mistress (Lena Olin) -- he simultaneously loves. 
</P>
<P>
Driving Miss Daisy (Warner Bros., Dec. 22). Director Bruce Beresford directs 
this adaptation of Alfred Uhry's Pulitzer Prize-winning play that chronicles 
the changing American South through the relationship of an elderly Jewish 
matron (Jessica Tandy) and the black man (Morgan Freeman) who becomes her 
chaeuffeur and companion. 
</P>
<P>
Born on the Fourth of July (Universal, Dec. 22). With "Platoon," 
writer-director Oliver Stone relayed the day-to-day hell that was Vietnam; in 
this adaptation of Marine veteran Ron Kovic's award-winning autobiography, he 
takes on the hell that Vietnam vets found when they got home. Tom Cruise, in a 
performance that will make or break the film, plays Kovic. 
</P>
<P>
Music Box (Tri-Star, Dec. 22). Jessica Lange stars in this Costa-Gavras 
conscience drama as a criminal lawyer defending -- while not quite sure of his 
innocence -- her immigrant father who faces charges of having committed war 
crimes.

ROBATA: TOKYO WITHOUT A VISA;

WHERE ELSE CAN YOU GET SEAWEED TOPPED WITH FOIE GRAS?

Robata, 250 N. Robertson Blvd., Beverly Hills. (213) 274-5533. Open for dinner 
Monday through Saturday. Full bar. Valet parking. All major credit cards 
accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $80-$140. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No matter what you might be expecting when you arrive, Tokyo will be differ 
ent. It is the most surprising city on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
You know, of course, that it's big and bustling. You know that the trains and 
subways work with extraordinary efficiency. But you might be surprised to 
discover that when you get into a taxi, your driver will probably not know 
where to go. Addresses make no logical sense -- buildings are numbered 
according to the date they were built -- and most people find where they're 
going by following little maps with references to local landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
You know that the Japanese have an enormous reverence for tradition. Still, 
it's something of a shock to get on the subway and find women wearing 
traditional kimonos standing next to young girls in Mary Janes and poodle 
skirts. 
</P>
<P>
You know that you'll find great sushi and tempura. Perhaps you even know that 
Tokyo has more restaurants than any other city you can think of -- some half a 
million at last count. 
</P>
<P>
But you might still be shocked by the impact of food upon the life of this 
city. It's everywhere. You can't walk half a block without encountering pastry 
shops, fast food joints, noodle parlors, fine French restaurants . . . after a 
while you get the sense that all anybody does is eat. When you walk into a 
department store you discover whole floors devoted to food -- and shopkeepers 
eager to entice you with free samples. 
</P>
<P>
Why is all this so surprising? Probably because here in Los Angeles, the 
Japanese restaurants all seem so similar, so traditional, so staid. 
</P>
<P>
But now along comes Robata, which maybe the first local restaurant to give us a 
real taste of Tokyo. The food is not more authentic than what you get in other 
fine Japanese restaurants in California, but this is one restaurant that seems 
to be looking to the future, not to the past. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the name. When you walk into a robata restaurant in Japan you find 
chefs standing behind mountains of beautifully arranged food. You point to what 
appeals to you, they cook it on a grill and then hand it to you, across the 
mountain, on a long wooden paddle that looks a lot like an oar. Well, here at 
this Robata there are no mountains, no paddles, no visible grills. It's not 
really a robata restaurant at all. Only a small portion of the menu is devoted 
to traditional robata dishes. And here they are called "demi plats chaud en 
brochettes." 
</P>
<P>
Consider the menu itself. It is an elegant document that looks as if it belongs 
in a design contest. Open the heavy gray folder and you discover that all the 
categories are written in French, followed by English descriptions so cryptic 
that they belong on one of those nonsense T-shirts that you find all over 
Japan. Haut plats chaud, for instance, are "various methods of warm preparation 
evolve with a variety of seafoods, meats and vegetables in masterpieces to the 
eye and the palate." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the main menu is yet another menu, offering the kaiseki, or multi-course 
meal. This is all fairly straightforward: the usual set Japanese courses (wan, 
mukozuke, agemono, sunomono, etc.) are listed with simple descriptions. The 
price is also straightforward: the 12-course dinner is $70. 
</P>
<P>
And now consider the restaurant itself. It is a handsome, modern room filled 
with granite, glass and wood. Out in front is what looks at first like a sushi 
bar. When you look more closely you notice that the counter is set with not 
only plates and chopsticks but also knives, forks and wine glasses. The chefs 
working behind the counter with enormous grace are all Japanese, but the 
waiters and waitresses are not. In this room, as in Tokyo itself, nothing seems 
out of place. When you look up and see a man in a short-sleeved shirt walking 
in with a woman in a very expensive kimono, you are not even surprised. Of 
course. 
</P>
<P>
The times I've been to the restaurant the clientele has been largely Japanese. 
As one friend explained, "In Japan, $70 per person for a kaiseki dinner would 
be very, very inexpensive." No wonder the tourists all seem to be indulging in 
the multi-course menu. 
</P>
<P>
This has varied every time I've tried it. The first time the meal began with 
little chips of dried stingray sprinkled with chiles and served in a beautiful 
bamboo basket. It was a lovely presentation, a perfect way to whet the 
appetite. On another occasion the course consisted of rather tired potato puffs 
and turnip chips.The next course is called sakizuke, which means delicacies of 
the season. In this season that means matsutake mushrooms, the truffles of 
Japan. Last time I had them they were sliced into icy slivers, set on a slice 
of lemon, and served in a martini glass. It was a surprising -- and refreshing 
-- presentation. 
</P>
<P>
The soup in this season is likely to contain matsutake as well -- only this 
time the mushrooms will be warm, which demonstrates a wholly different side of 
their character. Served in a broth with little pieces of fish, the mushrooms 
seem more like sea creatures than something that grows in piney woods. The soup 
arrives in a little metal kettle; you should know that it is considered gauche 
to eat out of the kettle itself. The proper procedure is to pour the soup into 
the little bowl on the side. The next course is sashimi. The Japanese know that 
you go to a sushi house for the best sashimi, and while the fish here is fine, 
it is not extraordinary. The most impressive thing about it is that the wasabi 
hiding beneath slices of squid, tuna and shrimp is the real thing, not the 
stuff that comes powdered in a tin. And that the portions of ginger on the side 
are whole marinated pieces, far more refreshing than the ubiquitous shavings 
you usually are served. 
</P>
<P>
If you're lucky, the next course, a salad, will be "Taisho's special" (which 
costs a hefty $10 on the a la carte menu). It contains various interesting 
greens tossed with fried yam chips, fried lotus root, fresh slices of fig and 
large pieces of raw tuna. What holds this eclectic blend together is an Asian 
vinaigrette that is subtle, and yet powerful enough to marry these diverse 
ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
Next comes yakimono -- a grilled dish. This is the only real robata you'll get 
all evening, and it might be chicken meat balls, or steak -- something quite 
clean and simple. It will be followed by a fried dish: Once this was wonderful 
soft-shelled crab; another time, less impressive shrimp tempura. 
</P>
<P>
But the final dishes are invariably interesting. One night there were delicate 
dumplings made of lobster and whitefish and wrapped in bean curd skin; they 
don't seem to be on the menu, but I'd go back just for those. Another night 
there was marinated salmon served with a single ginger shoot and punctuated by 
the richness of a roasted chestnut. If you can talk the waitress into letting 
you order the boiled short ribs with mustard soy sauce for your nimono course, 
do it; this is a fabulous dish. Or order it a la carte: the short ribs are 
simply two little pieces of meat, each resting on a slice of turnip with a dab 
of mustard sitting on top. They are immersed in a broth rich with the flavors 
of meat and wild mushrooms, and if there is a dish more evocative of fall in a 
forest, I haven't had it. 
</P>
<P>
The chef likes to start slowing to the denouement with a sort of salad course 
of slippery seaweed in a tiny chilled glass; one time this was topped with foie 
gras, another time with caviar. Both times it was superb. 
</P>
<P>
Then there will be a rice or noodle dish, and finally fruit. Compared to the 
sort of showy fruit you get in Japan at kaiseki meals (where you might get rare 
melons so expensive they'd easily serve as the down payment on a car, or 
strawberries the size of golf balls), this is pretty plebeian stuff. 
</P>
<P>
And no wonder; serving the fancy fruit of Japan could easily double the price 
of the meal. Japanese visitors would probably still find the meal a bargain, 
but for those of us for whom a visit to Robata will have to serve as a visit to 
Japan, the price of the ticket is already pretty high.

A TREND WATCHER CATCHES THE SCENT OF SPECTACLE AND AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION

<TEXT>
<P>
Where is theater going? Critics get asked the question all the time, and this 
critic never knows what to say. Theater isn't an industry -- yet. It is going 
where its individual artists want to go, and they are not all facing in the 
same direction. 
</P>
<P>
Nor do the artists have the total say. The critics and the audience also get a 
vote. And they will always be a little behind the artist. It has taken 30 years 
for us to see that "Waiting for Godot" is indeed a play, in fact a traditional 
play -- not a barren experiment in terminal stasis. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, sometimes the audience turns out to be correct. Not every 
theatrical experiment is vindicated by time. When was the last time you took 
part in a "happening"? All of this makes it impossible to say where theater is 
going. All that one can do is say what it has been up to lately. 
</P>
<P>
The most obvious difference over the theater of the recent past is the new 
emphasis on spectacle. Before the film era, of course, theater was the place to 
go for it -- to the extent that Henry James worried in the 1880s that the 
spoken play would be shouldered out of the theater entirely. 
</P>
<P>
The movies relieved the stage of the need to knock the audience's eye out, and 
the old-time chariot races and reenacted sea battles went to the warehouse. But 
with "Cats" and "Starlight Express" and "Les Miserables" and "Phantom of the 
Opera," the eye was back in the picture. The recently opened "Miss Saigon" in 
London is said to be the greatest spectacular of them all. 
</P>
<P>
Is this a vicious trend? Not necessarily. The eye does need to have something 
to do in the theater: It needn't preclude the working of the mind's eye. The 
giant dump heap in "Cats"; the barricades in "Les Miz"; the candle-lit grotto 
in "Phantom" -- all helped support the story and the score. What's worrying is 
when the evening is exclusively smoke-and-mirrors, as in "Starlight Express." 
That way lies Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Another kind of spectacular was recently delivered at Royce Hall, UCLA, by 
artist Robert Longo. "Dream Jumbo: Working the Absolutes" was its title. It 
linked five of Longo's performance pieces ("tableaux," to use an old-fashioned 
word) into a surprisingly accessible whole -- surprising, in that Longo is 
supposed to be on the cutting edge of the visual arts. 
</P>
<P>
His way of confronting the bourgeoisie, however, is give them the sort of image 
to which they have become accustomed, thanks to films and TV, and ask them to 
decode it for its underlying message of political oppression. 
</P>
<P>
Whether anyone actually does this is not known to me. I did notice an audience 
having a very good time processing "Dream Jumbo" on the first level, as a 
skillful mix of screen images and living performers -- sopranos, clowns, 
dancers, slow-motion wrestlers, all beautifully spaced and lit. It's quite 
possible that the next five years will see somebody present such a dream show 
for a mainstream audience, and find success with it. If so, the source to 
credit won't be Robert Longo, but Robert Wilson, whose tableaux go back to the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"Dream Jumbo" was, like Wilson's work, absolutely self-contained -- an event 
perfectly happy to be taking place within its frame. One could imagine it being 
performed in an empty hall or a full one: The dynamics wouldn't change. Which 
makes it the polar opposite of "Tony n' Tina's Wedding." 
</P>
<P>
Here's another avant-garde form gone mainstream: participatory theater. 
Remember when people felt daring about going onstage to mingle with the actors 
in the Company Theatre's "James Joyce Memorial Liquid Theatre"? Remember when 
people felt weird about taking part in "Center Earth Trialz" at San Diego's 
Crystal Palace Theatre? 
</P>
<P>
That started to change in the mid-'80s with "Tamara," which, incredibly, is 
still running in the marble mansion in Hollywood known as "Il Vittoriale." 
"Tony n' Tina's Wedding" also has a real-life environment, the Park Plaza Hotel 
at MacArthur Park -- exactly the hall that Tina's mother might hire for a ritzy 
wedding reception. 
</P>
<P>
As at "Tamara," the spectator is allowed to simply walk around and follow the 
action. But he can also mingle with the other guests and the wedding party. 
Tina herself (Nancy Cassaro) might even come along and stick an olive in his 
mouth, with a suggestive smirk. "Don't tell Tony, he'll be jealous." 
</P>
<P>
What do you say to that? What do you say to Tina's mother (Susan Varon) when 
she demands to see pictures of your family -- and you have to admit that you 
don't carry pictures in your wallet? It is all in fun, but it puts a strange 
responsibility on the spectator: now no longer a spectator, but a certified 
member of the wedding. It also induces a strange headiness -- that of Alice 
entering the magic mirror. And it instructs you that all big social events 
could be this much fun, if you would only loosen up. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a future for this sort of show? Certainly. "Tony n' Tina's Wedding" 
has already run for a year in New York, and promises to do well at the Park 
Plaza. We also have the seen the proliferation of the murder-mystery-weekend 
shows, where the viewer also gets into the game. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of evening is easy to do, and terribly difficult to do well. "Tony n' 
Tina's Wedding" does it well. It has a hugely experienced cast -- actors who 
know their characters so intimately that they can't be fazed: try it, and they 
end up fazing you. But gently, so that you don't feel put down. 
</P>
<P>
Nasty situations can arise at such events if the improvising spectator doesn't 
understand exactly the limits of the make-believe. Director David Pellegrini's 
actors somehow convey these limits without coming out from behind the fiction: 
We all know how far we can go, and within those margins we have the time of our 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies, other occasions might not be quite so much fun. "Uncle Luigi's 
Funeral" would not, I think, have appeal. This branch of the 
theater-of-the-future has enormous potential, but will also require special 
handling. In any case, we have definitely caught up with it.

Composer Mel Powell swings open the door to his Van Nuys studio, a dark 
sprawling room with every surface, including the top of a baby grand piano, 
buried under a morass of letters, books, manuscripts and score paper -- most of 
it spread wide open. 
</P>
<P>
Groaning bookcases contain everything from Gesualdo madrigals to full scores of 
Wagner operas. And an early model Macintosh computer hints of a thoroughly 
modern man who at times favors electronica over pens, ink and erasers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my playroom," says the proud, make-no-excuses academic who, at 66, 
looks back on a career of teaching -- first at Yale as the successor to Paul 
Hindemith and since 1969 at CalArts, as incumbent of the Disney-endowed chair 
in music composition. "It's lovely. From early in the morning until the dark of 
night all I do is pursue what catches my fancy. Who knows the adventure or 
discovery a person might come upon here?" 
</P>
<P>
The scene, circa 1940: A teen-aged Melvin Epstein hides in the restroom at 
Nick's, a jazz club in downtown New York where he sits in on piano with Bobby 
Hackett, Eddie Condon and Sidney Bechet. Too young to join the union, he's 
ducking officials who have come calling. 
</P>
<P>
One night, after a set, the audience breaks into earthy applause -- everyone 
but a large dour man who slowly claps one hand on the table. The young pianist 
is brought over to meet the seeming skeptic, who turns out to be Art Tatum. 
"You gonna be a real one," he tells the youngster. 
</P>
<P>
Tatum was right. Within months Benny Goodman comes by Nick's and, marveling at 
the 16-year-old's virtuosity, hires him as pianist and arranger. It is then 
that Melvin Epstein becomes Mel Powell, thrilled to be part of big band swing 
and "its sound of hungry lions coming at you with a lusty schrei. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my good fortune to happen onto the jazz scene during its heyday," he 
says now. "There are very few times in history when the best of art captures 
the mass imagination and thus achieves popularity. What transpired in America 
with jazz also was true in Italy, during Verdi's lifetime. His operas were the 
day's big popular events -- not remotely the kind of private art that occupies 
today's composers. It's rare. I was lucky." 
</P>
<P>
The scene: spring, 1989. An elegant Brentwood garden party for 100 guests. The 
musical elite of Los Angeles settle into rows of white folding chairs for the 
formal part of an awards ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Powell, accepting an honorary lifetime membership from the Friends of the 
Arnold Schoenberg Institute, has just been introduced. But he stays seated in 
his Mobie, an electric scooter chair, where earlier, he bantered with admirers 
in his best "sit-down comic" style. 
</P>
<P>
No one would guess from his open-faced joviality that the man suffers a 
degenerative muscle disease, one that has begun to affect his hands as well as 
his legs. As he begins to speak, now in a more formal cast, his tones become 
patrician, professorial; they conjure the image of an almost-English don. Even 
here, though, humor finds its way to the urbane message. 
</P>
<P>
The condition he suffers was originally diagnosed as muscular dystrophy. Its 
symptoms, afflicting Powell's quadriceps or frontal thigh muscles, appeared 
suddenly in 1982. He confesses that the major loss he suffered was his tennis 
game -- "an addiction I shared with Schoenberg but not one that brought me 
invitations to Wimbledon," he says self-mockingly. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I've turned myself over to the rheumatology department at UCLA, as a 
guinea pig. I take whole drawers of medication including steroids, but the 
working diagnosis has been changed to all-body-inclusive myesitis." His 
longtime colleague Nick England says that the additional hand symptom "was 
frightening -- as it possibly signals the end of his piano performance -- but 
it has been arrested with treatment and the ruling out of muscular dystrophy is 
good news. Still, the whole thing is a crap-shoot." 
</P>
<P>
Powell doesn't complain about his illness. Or about the small audiences for the 
type of austere, non-populist music he writes. His challenge lies in the realm 
of "non-consensual" music, a place where anarchy reigns, where one can discern 
no common theme, no steady beat, no compelling cadence. 
</P>
<P>
(Examples of his music can be heard next Nov. 6 at 8 p.m. on KUSC-FM (91.5), 
when Gail Eichenthal hosts "My Lunch With Mel: An American Musical Feast," 
aired nationally by American Public Radio as part of American Music Week.) 
</P>
<P>
Why, many ask, has Mel Powell entered the monastery of his "private art"? And 
why has he seemingly forsaken his American heritage -- jazz -- to chase a 
European tradition, one that embraces an arcane post-Schoenbergianism and 
alienates all but a precious few followers? 
</P>
<P>
Musicologist Leonard Stein has an answer of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
"Each piece Mel writes is a revelation," he says, "never a repeat of an earlier 
challenge." In a sense, always looking for the next challenge defines Mel 
Powell's manifold careers. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's what he calls "the bitch goddess of my past, the great 
pacifier," which brought glamour and acclaim. In his swing heyday, he earned an 
astounding $25,000 a year, which enabled him to stay at hotels like the 
Waldorf-Astoria and support his Depression-poor family. "But playing the same 
tunes and arrangements night after night became routine," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Drafted into the service during World War II, Powell was recruited by Glenn 
Miller for the Army Air Force Band. There he composed his first serious works 
-- string trios and brass quintets that the Miller musicians tried out for him. 
</P>
<P>
But when the war ended, he found himself once again on an odyssey, one that had 
begun in childhood with a prodigious mastery of classical music. Always evident 
was the intellect that led him at 15 to City 
</P>
<P>
College of New York and a major in math and French literature (he dropped out 
after a year to join Goodman). 
</P>
<P>
He returned briefly to the Goodman band, then took jobs as a pianist at ABC and 
the Met playing for auditions ("Boy, did I know 'Vissi d'Arte' after three 
weeks!"). 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1946, he got a call from "this kid in California, Andre Previn," 
inviting him to work for MGM at the fabulous rate of $500 a week. By that time 
he had married actress Martha Scott (William Wyler's "Desperate Hours," and, 
more recently, Herb Ross' "The Turning Point") and they decided Hollywood might 
be good for both of them. 
</P>
<P>
"Here I was composing all this stuff for the studio. Checks came in every week 
but hardly any calls, except to accompany Mario Lanza and coach Katherine 
Grayson. I palled around with Andre and Oscar Levant -- what wonderful 
comedians! -- and enjoyed the camaraderie of James Mason and William Saroyan 
who also lived in our building at Hollywood and Vine. But I grew weary of it 
all and was dissatisfied with my technical skills as a composer. 
</P>
<P>
"The remedy: to study with Paul Hindemith at Yale, which brought me full circle 
to serious music. My career took an A-B-A form. However, the B part (jazz) was 
very brief, lasting just a couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
For all intents and purposes the man who would become, with Milton Babbitt and 
Elliott Carter, "the difficult trio," left the jazz/pop/commercial world in 
1947 for the halls of academe. 
</P>
<P>
"The success, money and fame I got from the old days have gone a long way 
towards comforting me," he says, referring to the esoteric world of new music, 
where, with others, he now thrives in a tiny ghetto far from public 
consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
"I walked away (from the Goodman band) satisfied, ready to spend the rest of my 
life unnoticed, composing music that will be heard by a handful of people. But 
what a treat it is to still find myself salivating like a child when I look at 
a page of (Richard Strauss') 'Don Quixote.' " 
</P>
<P>
At Yale, Powell not only flowered under Hindemith's tutelage but eventually 
succeeded the German composer-pedagogue as chairman of the composition 
department. And he played the role like a consummate actor. 
</P>
<P>
"My speech was a mix of distant German and soft British," he laughs. "It was 
pure affectation." He says he jumped gleefully into the intellectual atmosphere 
and, in a nod to the Zeitgeist, translated music theory into the voguish 
language of "scientism." 
</P>
<P>
"After all, Yale was a brand-name institution and I had to make sure the kids 
would not ask for their money back. So we spoke of such things as isochronous 
units or striated time and I taught under such rubrics as 'foundations of sonic 
structures.' Don't get me wrong. I'm only talking about a couple of C-sharps. 
And chords, well, would you believe we called them verticalities?" 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, though, he saw himself as an outsider at Yale. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides being the campus radical," he says, "I also represented a discipline 
no one else was interested in. While I became conversant in their fields -- 
theoretical physics, deconstructionist philosophy, etc. -- and loved those 
Monday evenings of talk and brandy and cigars, the most they knew about music 
was the Beatles." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the call in 1969 to start up a music school for the newly founded 
CalArts fell on grateful ears. Powell and his family said goodby to New Haven 
and trekked to Los Angeles, a move that astonished his Ivy League colleagues. 
They saw him, naturally, as the grand Renaissance man moving to a cultural 
wasteland. 
</P>
<P>
The Bronx apartment building on 161st Street where he lived with his brother, 
sister and immigrant parents was across the road from Yankee Stadium -- a 
coincidence not to be lost on one of the few erudite composers to have played 
serious first base. The Garcia Grande cigars people paid him and his teammates 
$1 a game to compete in a sandlot park across from the stadium. A rank rookie 
then, with hitting talent, he got special coaching from Yankee catcher Bill 
Dickey, "this tall Southerner with the soft accent who called me -- a little 
blond kid -- 'Whitey.' " When Dickey witnessed his protege's 275-foot drive he 
said: "If you keep that up, Whitey, you'll get to Newark (where the Yankees' 
farm team played)." 
</P>
<P>
"At 9 years, I had three heroes," Powell says, breaking into a broad grin and 
palpably recalling his enthusiasm. "They were Babe Ruth, Debussy and Franklin 
D. Roosevelt -- all of them positively equal in my mind. I was their passionate 
fan." 
</P>
<P>
An injury to his third finger, however, brought about the decision to choose 
piano study over baseball. 
</P>
<P>
But music had a head start, thanks to his maternal grandfather -- "a terribly 
stern Talmudic scholar with a Spinoza bent" -- who lived with the family and, 
recognizing the 4-year-old grandson's talent, bartered Hebrew for piano lessons 
with one Sara Barg. 
</P>
<P>
"You could say I began to compose under her influence," Powell muses. 'She 
focused on music theory. Jazz was unknown to me then. But my brother Lloyd was 
an aficionado and had me listen to live radio broadcasts." 
</P>
<P>
Joining Goodman and changing his name, Powell remembers that "even Epstein was 
a fraud. My father's father chose it as a concession to the customs agent at 
Ellis Island who otherwise would have had to stumble over Poljanowsky. Powell 
gives back some heritage points." 
</P>
<P>
Change of name, change of venue -- Powell seems to collect them. But what 
attracted him to CalArts, where he has performed the duties of provost, dean, 
composer-in-residence and professor, was the idea of "becoming central rather 
than occupying the fringe -- although I certainly don't want to gainsay Yale 
and its achievements. But to find music, dance and theater as the primary focus 
was irresistibly exotic." 
</P>
<P>
In a verbal wink he also explains the transcontinental shift as a "desire to 
meet Gloria Swanson and Jane Fonda . . . and to leave behind in the slush and 
snow all thoughts of Adrian's perception theory and the depolarization of the 
axon. Instead I wanted to pursue studies in health food and real estate, to 
find out if a composer accused of intellectual tendencies could win a game or 
two from a tennis pro, or at least become suntanned." 
</P>
<P>
His CalArts indoctrination included a little fiasco called "Contempo '70." At 
UCLA's Pauley Pavilion the Los Angeles Philharmonic, under Zubin Mehta, was to 
conduct Powell's "Immobiles" on the same program with Frank Zappa narrating his 
"200 Motels." Outraged by Zappa's "blathering on about masturbation -- my 
14-year-old-daughter was in the audience" -- an offended Powell walked out, 
much to Ernest Fleischmann's chagrin. 
</P>
<P>
"Only later did the Machiavellian truth of this elaborate plan dawn on me. As 
CalArt's music man I was to be the bridge between Disney money and the 
Philharmonic. It didn't work then, but $50 million later the orchestra will 
have a new hall, thanks to Disney. And I even got a commission this year from 
Ernest -- a double piano concerto to be premiered in January." 
</P>
<P>
But messy politics lie outside his concerns. "I joined a guild peopled by Bach 
and Mozart," he says. "How dare I sit and whine while belonging to that domain? 
You do the noblest you can do and then hope to be embraced for it." 
</P>
<P>
Embraced he is, with such accolades as the Schoenberg and the Brandeis Award 
which constitute "my Andy Warhol 15 minutes in the spotlight," quips Powell. 
However, his colleague England says that the tributes are entirely deserved: 
"Mel's extraordinary intellect knows few boundaries. And especially now, he is 
composing at an unprecedented rate." 
</P>
<P>
But does Mel Powell pay dearly for pursuing an art that doesn't land him 
Grammys and other symbols of mass validation? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a composer," he says. "And that's a vain assessment on its own. All the 
rest is subsidiary. So I can have no ill feeling against those who care little 
for what I do or even disapprove of it. What consoles me is that posterity may 
prove the greatness of my work. If worthy, it will be there when I'm gone. 
That's the reward."

JAMES FLANIGAN: NO NEW TAXES MEANS MORE BORROWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Crises, while they sometimes call forth strength, can also reveal weaknesses in 
a society -- as for example, the government's difficulty with California 
earthquake relief. 
</P>
<P>
The story for now has a happy ending -- relief funds are on their way to the 
Bay Area because President Bush signed the law that will allow the Treasury to 
borrow the money needed to shore up roads and bridges and to care for people 
living in tents. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury must borrow, of course, because the federal government is already 
way over budget. In fact, there was some dithering over relief while the 
Administration and Congress tried to devise a way to raise the money without 
further violating Gramm-Rudman deficit limits. 
</P>
<P>
But in the end, it was decided that it had to be in the budget, so the 
$3.5-billion relief program will add to the $100-billion government deficit. 
"It will add to the deficit. Is that preferable to a tax increase? Yes," is how 
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater stated the policy. 
</P>
<P>
On earthquake relief as on other matters, said a White House aide, "the 
President's position is clear: No new taxes." 
</P>
<P>
Which sounds like a battle cry, but is really a cop-out. Because no new taxes 
means more loans from abroad to fund the deficit. Last year foreign investors 
in U.S. Treasury bonds and bills loaned the U.S. government about $48 billion 
-- roughly 40% of the deficit (with Japan, the leading lender, accounting for 
roughly $24 billion). Foreign investors will fund relief for victims of the 
earthquake and Hurricane Hugo in South Carolina. The money has to come from 
somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Which raises a question: If no new taxes is merely an excuse for borrowing -- 
and creating new interest payments -- are we kidding ourselves? And if so, are 
we paying a price? 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, people understand the answer is yes. But false economy goes far 
beyond Washington. According to the Government Finance Officers Assn., a 
12,000-member organization of state, county and municipal treasurers and budget 
directors, America faces an overdue bill for infrastructure repair amounting to 
$100 billion. Infrastructure is a big word meaning roads and water mains, 
bridges and tunnels, sewers and freeways. 
</P>
<P>
And the bill for their upkeep is overdue because, like railroad companies years 
ago, the cities have deferred maintenance. When voters turn down bond issues 
and new taxes, explains director Jeffrey Esser, of the Government Finance 
Officers, you use available funds for schools and police and fire departments 
and cut maintenance to stay within budget. "It's something you can get away 
with -- for a while." 
</P>
<P>
But now neglect is catching up. In Chicago, Transit Authority trains must slow 
to six miles an hour in the Loop because the track system can't take the 
vibrations of greater speed. Water mains are corroded in New York, and there 
are potholes on superhighways all over America. 
</P>
<P>
What is being done? Some intelligent solutions -- voters approved more public 
works initiatives in 1988 than in previous years. But state legislatures still 
prefer the easy way out. Lotteries and other public gambling schemes have 
become a mania -- 32 states have lotteries, Oregon has legal poker machines, 
Iowa has riverboat casino gambling. Lotteries alone raise almost $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But it's a wasteful way to raise public money. The state keeps only 37% of 
gambling proceeds. Taxes raise money more efficiently -- and do it fairly. The 
odds on state lotteries, say professional gamblers, are a rip-off -- the bettor 
risks too much for too little potential reward. And gambling takes 
proportionately more from the poor than the better-off. A voluntary activity, 
gambling might be all right if it were only to raise money for extras. But when 
the state makes suckers of its citizens to fund schools and safe water, it's an 
injustice. 
</P>
<P>
What can be done? We can pay our way. If they had the political will, the 
President and Congress could have funded earthquake relief easily with a 
temporary 10-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax, which would have brought in $10 
billion in one year. 
</P>
<P>
For the long-term, tax experts are thinking of a super-sales tax that would 
exempt all savings, tax all spending and encourage business investment. The 
intent, says John Shoven, head of economics at Stanford University, would be to 
lower the cost of capital for U.S. industry. 
</P>
<P>
Still, you say, the economy is puttering along and inflation is low. Do we 
really pay a price for the budget deficit? The answer has just been supplied by 
the Federal Reserve, which reports annually on America's wealth -- the value of 
all its homes, goods and businesses, minus how much is owed on them. The new 
Fed survey, taking a 10-year look, shows that America's wealth increased more 
slowly in the 1980s than in any previous decade, because of the buildup of 
public debt -- which all Americans must now work to pay off. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe in the next decade we'll stop kidding ourselves with phrases like "No new 
taxes" and return to an earlier American boast: "We pay our way."

MICRONICS VS. THE PENTAGON; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: THE BANKRUPTCY OF THE BREA CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBLE FOR A KEY MISSILE 
COMPONENT POINTS TO FLAWS IN PENTAGON PROCUREMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY 
PROCEDURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
On a still, abandoned, shipping dock at the Micronics International Inc. plant 
in Brea sits a pile of cardboard cases, neatly packed with rows of 
10-inch-long, odd-shaped, aluminum devices. 
</P>
<P>
Known as "fuzes," the devices look harmless, a bit like an axle poked through a 
thick wheel. But put to their intended use, they are the triggers that unleash 
the destructive power of the warheads in Phoenix air-to-air missiles, the 
primary weapons for "Top Gun" pilots in Navy F-14 jets. 
</P>
<P>
The Phoenix fuzes -- in Navy lingo, the FSU-10 -- may also have destroyed 
Micronics. And therein lies a story of institutional conflict, costly 
misjudgments, bureaucratic shortsightedness and investigative zeal. 
</P>
<P>
The demise of Micronics -- a 175-employee company swept into bankruptcy court 
in mid-September after the Defense Department declared that the firm's 
quality-control systems had collapsed -- is also a story of a procurement 
system that can make crushing demands on small businesses and then let 
accountability slip away. 
</P>
<P>
One employee calls the FSU-10 the "demon baby" of Micronics. Born in the tumult 
after the Shah's fall in Iran, the fuze bound Micronics, the Pentagon and Navy 
engineers in the Mojave Desert in a rancorous tryst. Today, the reverberations 
sweep from Orange County to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Production has been halted at Micronics on not only the FSU-10, but also on 
safety-and-arming mechanisms for the Sparrow and Sidewinder missiles -- both 
stalwarts of the nation's air defense system. A bankruptcy judge has allowed 
Hughes Aircraft Co. to temporarily reopen a corner of the plant to complete a 
set of fuzes for the AMRAAM, the proposed new-generation missile for F-15 and 
F/A-18 fighters. Preparing other companies to replace Micronics as the supplier 
to these programs will be costly and will take years, Pentagon officials say. 
</P>
<P>
In Baldwin Park, meantime, the Navy has put a Micronics subcontractor out of 
the defense business. Near Dayton, Ohio, a tiny firm is trying to recover from 
the onslaught of investigations that began when Micronics merely proposed using 
it as a subcontractor. 
</P>
<P>
And while criminal investigators pick through the rubble of Micronics in Brea, 
careers are on the line in Washington as the military and Congress sort out the 
mess. 
</P>
<P>
For all the turmoil, the parts that Micronics' workers assembled get the job 
done. The company didn't follow every specification, the investigators say. Its 
quality processes may have been muddled. The paper work may be wrong. Over 
time, missiles will need more testing to make sure that they haven't 
deteriorated prematurely. But government testing agencies say virtually 
everything that Micronics delivered works just fine. 
</P>
<P>
So it's no surprise that Micronics' laid-off workers feel jilted. Each day, 
they marched into work past a plaque that reads, "The Best Damned S-A Devices 
and Fuzes in the World Are Manufactured Behind This Door." They believed the 
motto, even when the Pentagon didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"The girls on the line gave it everything we had, and I don't think we deserve 
this," said Cheryl Breneman of La Habra. "We're not the enemy." 
</P>
<P>
The Beginning 
</P>
<P>
The FSU-10 fuze was a problem child right from its start in 1977, when the Navy 
proposed development of a radical new safety-and-arming device for the Phoenix 
missile. Micronics' old version simply ignited the missile warhead. The new 
fuze was meant to prevent premature firings, too. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, the prime contractor on the Phoenix, opposed the Navy proposal, arguing 
that it seemed too risky. Yet the Navy not only went ahead with the project but 
also assigned the task to Micronics, which had little experience in design 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the job would have gone to Navy engineers at China Lake, the 
sprawling Naval Weapons Center in the Mojave Desert. The design was conceived 
by the engineers, iconoclastic wizards often at odds with the Pentagon bean 
counters in the Naval Air Systems Command, or NavAir. But China Lake's 
engineering staff had recently been cut, so the work was handed to tiny 
Micronics. 
</P>
<P>
The redesign was far from complete when Islamic fundamentalists drove the Shah 
of Iran from power in 1979, leaving the original version of the Phoenix in 
enemy hands. NavAir rushed a new version -- including the FSU-10 -- into 
production. And disaster unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
Once production began, the Navy initiated hundreds of changes to the fuze's 
specifications, Micronics officials say. "There was an awful lot of pressure to 
hurry up development," said Gerry Chalmers, China Lake's chief engineer on the 
program from 1983 to 1986. "They skipped the prototype step and went from 
engineering development right into production. They were trying to hold the 
Naval Weapons Center and Micronics' feet to the fire and make this thing work 
without a prototype." 
</P>
<P>
China Lake engineers said they repeatedly warned NavAir that the fuze could not 
be produced in large numbers because the design wasn't workable. Indeed, the 
FSU-10 never passed Navy qualification tests. Nonetheless, the Navy rewarded 
Micronics with new contracts -- at least $8.5 million in contracts from 1984 to 
1988, when the Navy finally concluded that, since the fuze worked, the design 
was adequate. 
</P>
<P>
Chalmers says China Lake's own shortcomings contributed to the problems. "We 
should have taken a stronger position with NavAir once we found out there were 
problems," he says. "But then, China Lake's livelihood comes from NavAir. We 
have to be responsible to them." 
</P>
<P>
Micronics' mistake, perhaps, was in getting so deeply involved in the Phoenix 
program that it couldn't pull back. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe where they went wrong was in the very beginning, where they (agreed) to 
do something they thought there were problems with," says Danielle Brian-Bland, 
an analyst at the Project for Military Procurement, a Washington watchdog group 
that has monitored Micronics' problems. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the seed of potentially bigger problems for Micronics and the 
Pentagon was being planted 15 miles north of Brea in Baldwin Park. 
</P>
<P>
There, Asher Engineering Corp. fabricated $15 electronic switches used by 
Micronics and most of the other companies that made arming systems for U.S. 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Year after year, Asher's production and testing programs won the blessings of 
the Pentagon's electronics czars at the Defense Electronic Supply Center in 
Dayton, Ohio -- what a center spokesman described as "the Good Housekeeping 
Seal of Approval." 
</P>
<P>
What investigators didn't learn until this spring, though, was that the 
35-employee company may not have been conducting required tests on the switches 
or building them to military specifications. 
</P>
<P>
Although unaware of Asher's troubles, China Lake employees were feeling the 
toll of working on the FSU-10. One engineer after another was worn down by 
bureaucratic bickering and intractable problems. 
</P>
<P>
One former Phoenix program manager says health problems forced his retirement 
in 1985. And former Phoenix chief engineer Chalmers believes that the job may 
have contributed to the heart attack that led to his retirement in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a damn stressful program, the hardest job I ever had in my life," 
Chalmers says. "I still am frustrated by it and think about it." 
</P>
<P>
Micronics was having turnover of its own. Between 1982 and 1987 the company had 
three owners -- International Signal &amp; Control, a Pennsylvania electronics 
firm; Gardena machine shop owner Walter Neubauer, and La Jolla-based Precision 
Aerotech. Each new owner brought in new managers -- some more competent than 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Neubauer bought Micronics in 1982 for $2 million. A jowly man with a thick 
German accent, he says he was sure that there was money to be made in the 
company because Micronics had been willing to buy parts from his machine shop 
for triple the going price. 
</P>
<P>
Neubauer guessed right: He sold the firm to Precision Aerotech in 1987 for $5.3 
million. But the new owners inherited a mess at least as large as the one that 
Neubauer took on, as the events of the next two years would make clear. 
</P>
<P>
A 1987 report by three China Lake engineers listed some of the main problems 
with the FSU-10 program: Micronics' inexperience at product design; its 
"serious managerial and financial problems . . . during critical phases of the 
program"; a speeded-up development program that didn't allow adequate time for 
testing and changes; the fuze's "complicated" design. 
</P>
<P>
"We found just incredible things that had transpired," said Wayne Thurston, 
whom Precision Aerotech installed as president in February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Investigator 
</P>
<P>
The arrival of a new quality inspector at Micronics in March, 1988, made 
certain that the problems wouldn't be ignored. Joseph Selfinger, a heavyset man 
with a bulldog face and wavy brown hair that curls over his shirt collar, had 
clear marching orders for his first assignment as an on-site inspector for 
DCAS, the Defense Contract Administration Service: Clean up the mess at 
Micronics. 
</P>
<P>
During the next 11 months, Selfinger would lead teams that uncovered a 
breakdown in manufacturing procedures and quality controls in Micronics' 
mainstay programs, the fuzes for the Navy's Sidewinder and Sparrow missiles, 
according to DCAS reports. He set government inspectors and investigators on 
the path to discovering an array of deficiencies in the FSU-10: fuze covers not 
made to specifications, the use of below-grade Asher switches and more. 
</P>
<P>
But Precision Aerotech and Micronics officials have portrayed Selfinger as a 
zealot obsessed with shutting down Micronics. 
</P>
<P>
G. Addison Appleby, chairman of Precision Aerotech, says Selfinger was verbally 
abusive, threatened workers with the loss of their jobs and removed Micronics 
products and documents from the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Micronics officials contend that after Selfinger joined the company, the number 
of critical quality problems identified by DCAS soared. Where in past years 
DCAS -- the agency that monitors compliance with the terms of military 
contracts -- had issued 10 to 35 "Quality Deficiency Reports" to Micronics, 
there were 110 during Selfinger's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
Micronics maintains that many of the reports were frivolous and that Selfinger 
was firing them off faster than company managers could reply. 
</P>
<P>
In one instance, Micronics officials said Selfinger issued a deficiency report 
because labels on devices about to be shipped were facing "the wrong way." They 
say the company previously had sent out 7,000 of the items with the labels 
applied the same way -- without objection from government inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
After months of complaints from Micronics, DCAS transferred Selfinger out of 
the Brea plant last January -- but only as a courtesy to the company, says Gay 
Maund, a regional spokeswoman for DCAS in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
"We find no reason to suspect the credibility of anything he says and we do 
find reason to suspect the credibility of what Micronics has alleged," Maund 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Maund specifically denied Micronics' allegations that Selfinger removed 
property from the company, threatened employees with loss of their jobs, 
claimed to have closed down other companies or promised to put Micronics out of 
business. Selfinger declined through Defense Department spokesmen to be 
interviewed for this story. 
</P>
<P>
DCAS's position gets support from Wayne Thurston, the former Micronics 
president, who says it's wrong to paint Selfinger as the company's enemy. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy was somebody who was brought in to say, 'Either clean up your act or 
you are not going to be in the business,' " said Thurston, now president of 
Space Ordnance Systems in Canyon Country. "(He) had a lot of knowledge about 
the manufacturing process and he uncovered a lot of the crap that was going 
on." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, it is Selfinger's zeal that Micronics officials have made the 
focal point of their effort to vindicate the company. They brought their 
complaints to the attention of the area's congressman, Rep. William Dannemeyer 
(R-Fullerton), who met with a group of Micronics employees last month to hear 
their allegations firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Naslund, a senior legislative assistant to Dannemeyer, says the Micronics 
employees substantiated the company's claims of "high-handed, arrogant and 
obnoxious behavior" by Selfinger. Dannemeyer has requested a meeting with DCAS 
to discuss the employees' allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The Micronics story provides a vivid example, Naslund says, "of what everyone 
has been crying about military procurement for years -- the Byzantine manner in 
which the Pentagon concocts these requirements" for its contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Appleby and Micronics officials see Selfinger as the instigator of an ongoing 
criminal investigation of the firm by the Defense Criminal Investigative 
Service, to which he was detailed after leaving Micronics. Criminal 
investigators have recommended that the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles 
file charges against Micronics and Asher. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors haven't moved on the recommendation in months, though. And skeptics 
wonder if the investigators' zeal has painted them into a corner. 
</P>
<P>
DCIS "is in it so deep that they can't walk away from it without egg on their 
face," says a NavAir contracting official familiar with the situation. "And 
they don't know what to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
Adds Precision Aerotech Chairman Appleby: "There are a number of people now 
whose careers are in jeopardy if they can't actually prove Micronics is a 
crook." 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon 
</P>
<P>
As Micronics failed, competing interests within the military skirmished over 
the nature of the damage inflicted by the problems with the fuzes and Asher's 
switches. Was national defense imperiled? What would be the consequences of a 
crackdown? 
</P>
<P>
On the first score, the DCIS -- busy trying to establish criminal cases against 
the two firms -- painted the bleakest picture. 
</P>
<P>
In April, a month after it began probing Asher, the agency's deputy director 
sent a memorandum to the armed services' top legal and investigative officials 
warning that the switches "could present a serious hazard to both the missile 
system and to national security." 
</P>
<P>
Later in the spring, Navy officials said, the agency pressed to pull out of 
service for testing every missile thought to contain an Asher switch -- a 
sweeping demand that would have stripped the Navy of most of the air-to-air 
missiles put in service since 1981 and a large share of the air-to-surface and 
surface-to-surface arsenal as well. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy officials responsible for equipping the fleet would have none of that. 
</P>
<P>
Their test data -- from examination of Asher switches and Micronics fuzes by 
China Lake, the Naval Avionics Center in Indianapolis, the Pacific Missile Test 
Center at Pt. Mugu and independent testing firms -- indicated that the products 
worked, even if they weren't made to specification, according to Navy memos and 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
So, Navy quality officials told the contract officers in charge of missile 
programs that, from a technical standpoint, there was no reason not to keep 
accepting and using missiles containing the suspect parts. NavAir concurred, 
allowing some contractors, including Micronics, to use Asher switches, despite 
the shortcomings in the Baldwin Park firm's manufacturing processes. 
</P>
<P>
The investigative service and its allies in the bureaucracy were in a fury. 
</P>
<P>
At a June 1 meeting with missile program officials, investigators said they 
wanted all shipments from Asher stopped because its switches were not up to 
specifications, according to a DCIS memo leaked after the meeting. The Navy, 
however, wanted the switches used because they worked. 
</P>
<P>
At the Pentagon, W. J. Willoughby, the Navy's top quality-control official, 
seemed to side with the investigative service. In a memo to NavAir, he warned 
of "the potential serious hazard to personnel, aircraft and missiles" stemming 
from the Asher switches and scolded a Navy lab for concluding that the switches 
posed little risk. 
</P>
<P>
Within days, Willoughby's memo was in the hands of the House Energy and 
Commerce Committee, whose chairman, Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), is known as 
one of Congress' fiercest investigators. Dingell fired off -- and 
simultaneously released to the media -- a letter to Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney stating that the problems with Asher switches could force the "recall of 
seven years of missile production." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until after the flurry of news stories generated by Dingell's letter 
that it became clear that Willoughby's staff had not been fully briefed on the 
tests conducted by the Navy. Once he got the details, according to a NavAir 
official familiar with the test results, Willoughby agreed that the switches 
and missiles were safe to use. 
</P>
<P>
"They're in the higher level management and sometimes they don't have the 
day-to-day insight into the technical details," the official explained. "One 
might say we just failed to keep them fully informed." 
</P>
<P>
The Fallout 
</P>
<P>
Neither the consensus that the switches and fuzes work nor the closure of 
Micronics has cleared the Pentagon's decks of its problems with the Brea firm. 
</P>
<P>
Half a dozen weapons programs have been delayed or forced to rely on single 
sources by the shutdown of Micronics' production line. And two weeks ago, when 
the Navy suspended all dealings with Asher, it eliminated the only 
government-qualified manufacturer of switches used in most of the its tactical 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes Aircraft Co. says it fell behind schedule in delivering AMRAAM missiles 
to the Air Force before a Santa Ana bankruptcy judge gave his OK on Oct. 3 for 
Micronics to resume limited production of AMRAAM fuzes. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix missile production, meantime, may have to be halted for six months 
after the existing stock of FSU-10s is depleted, the Navy says. By February, 
the Navy plans to resume using fuzes from the old version of the Phoenix. But 
the Navy doesn't expect to be able to qualify a Connecticut firm, Raymond 
Engineering, as the new producer of the FSU-10 fuze until May, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the company that could offer the military a new source for switches 
is reeling from the forces unleashed by the Micronics debacle. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon inspectors, not wanting a replay of the problems with Asher, swept 
through Kemp Precision Circuit Inc.'s plant in Dayton, Ohio, this summer. They 
cited the tiny firm for more than 120 quality deficiencies. Although no serious 
problems were found, Kemp was required to undertake a costly quality 
improvement program. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the costliest fallout from the Micronics episode, though, is the years 
of testing that the Navy will conduct to assure that none of the shortcuts 
allegedly taken in making the switches and fuzes has shorn the missile arsenal 
of its long-term reliability. 
</P>
<P>
NavAir plans to take apart as many as 1,458 missiles containing Asher switches 
-- Phoenix missiles, Sidewinders, Sparrows, Tomahawks, HARMs and Harpoons -- to 
study the fuzes. Tests, including firings, will determine whether quality 
problems have shortened the effective life of the fuzes. 
</P>
<P>
"If they had been manufactured to the full specification," a top NavAir 
official said, "we would not need to do this." 
</P>
<P>
The Future 
</P>
<P>
Twelve years have passed since the conception of the demon baby, 12 months 
since the Defense Department launched its criminal investigation of Micronics. 
</P>
<P>
The missile builders in the Pentagon would like to get the production lines in 
Brea restarted. The Navy's Configuration Control Board, which grants waivers to 
contract specifications, has given its OK for Micronics to use Asher's 
below-grade switches, Navy spokeswoman Susan Supak confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
But the stances adopted by the key players at this juncture -- Micronics' 
owner, Precision Aerotech, and DCAS -- seem to guarantee that Micronics won't 
be back in business any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of bitter meetings and cross letters, DCAS has told Micronics 
officials that, in addition to correcting all the other deficiencies that led 
to the company's shutdown, they must verify that the thousands of parts in 
inventory at the Brea plant conform to military specifications before DCAS will 
resume inspections of Micronics' products. 
</P>
<P>
That demand, Micronics said in a Sept. 29 response, "constitutes an enormous, 
almost impossible task with prohibitive costs." 
</P>
<P>
Precision Aerotech, in fact, has no plans to reopen Micronics. "We want to sell 
it," explained Appleby, Precision's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to understand why. Precision's reputation has taken a battering, 
Appleby says, in the two years that it has owned Micronics. And dumping the 
company into Chapter 11 has brightened Precision's financial picture 
significantly. While losses last year at Micronics produced a loss for 
Precision as a whole, Appleby says the La Jolla firm expects to show a profit 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Rather then trying to meet the government's demands, Precision has turned to 
the task of assigning blame for Micronics' fall. The company is readying a 
$20-million claim charging that government misconduct destroyed Micronics. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy, however, pins responsibility for the FSU-10 debacle squarely on 
Micronics. 
</P>
<P>
The Brea firm "was unprepared for the type of sophisticated product processes 
and management controls required for the manufacturing of this device," the 
Navy said in a written response to questions from The Times. The problems could 
not be corrected, despite the Navy's "extraordinary efforts." 
</P>
<P>
Out in the Mojave Desert, though, the engineers say no one can duck 
responsibility. "With all our successes, we really screwed this one up," says 
Chalmers, now retired from China Lake. "It's like icing on a cake. There's 
enough blame to cover everything." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FSU-10 FUZE ON THE PHOENIX AIR-TO-AIR MISSILE 
</P>
<P>
The AIM-54 Phoenix missile is the U.S. Navy's primary air-to-air missile for 
the F-14 fighter.One of the main missions of the Phoenix is attacking bombers 
before they launch cruise missiles aimed at U.S. ships. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE FUZE'S FUNCTION 
</P>
<P>
The FSU-10 fuze is the device that detonates the Phoenix warhead and also 
prevents the warhead from detonating prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PHOENIX DESCRIPTION 
</P>
<P>
The Phoenix missile can hit a target more than 100 miles away. It scores hits 
on supersonic, high-altitude planes as well as high-and low-altitude cruise 
missiles. The Phoenix can survive against sophisticated counter-measures. More 
than 3,500 Phoenix missiles have been delivered to the Navy since 1974.

CONEY ISLAND LIGHTHOUSE, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frank Schubert, 74, is the last civilian lighthouse keeper in America. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a relic," laughed Schubert, a tall, husky man who rapidly climbed the 78 
steps of the circular iron stairway leading to the top of the narrow 
75-foot-high Coney Island Light. 
</P>
<P>
The century-old lighthouse overlooks the entrance to New York bay at the 
southern tip of Brooklyn. It is located just down the street from the parachute 
jump at the famous amusement park and not far from Nathan's Coney Island hot 
dog stand. 
</P>
<P>
As he climbed the steep stairway with obvious ease Schubert explained why he 
called himself a relic. "I hired on with the U.S. Lighthouse Service in 1937. 
At first, I was a quartermaster on the Tulip, a ship that maintains markers and 
sea lanes." 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, when the Coast Guard took over the Lighthouse Service, 
Schubert stayed on as a civilian employee and became a lighthouse keeper. He 
has been operating the Coney Island Light since 1960. 
</P>
<P>
But this era is coming to an end. Within a year all of the six remaining manned 
lighthouses in the United States will be automated. They are Coney Island and 
five others cared for by Coast Guard personnel: Boston Light; Egmont Key, Fla.; 
Block Island, R.I.; Goat Island, and Kennebeck, Me. 
</P>
<P>
All the other lighthouses in the United States along the Atlantic and Pacific 
seaboards, the Gulf Coast and Great Lakes have been automated over the past few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Boston Light, originally constructed in 1716 as the nation's first lighthouse, 
is scheduled to be the last one automated. That is, unless legislation 
introduced by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) to prevent automation and keep 
the Boston Light manned is passed. 
</P>
<P>
Civilians operated lighthouses for the U.S. Lighthouse Service until 50 years 
ago when the U.S. Coast Guard was assigned the task. Gradually, over the years, 
the Coast Guard phased out all remaining civilians until finally only Frank 
Schubert was left. 
</P>
<P>
Schubert is the last of thousands of civilian lighthouse keepers who guided 
ships at sea into safe harbors for 273 years. Since Boston Light was erected in 
1716, America has built more than 1,500 lighthouses, but there were never more 
than 850 operating at any given time, according to Wayne Wheeler, president of 
the San Francisco-based U.S. Lighthouse Society. 
</P>
<P>
George Worthylake was America's first lighthouse keeper. In 1718, two years 
after he went to work at the Boston Light, he and his family drowned when his 
boat overturned in stormy seas. Benjamin Franklin wrote a poem about 
Worthylake's tragic end. 
</P>
<P>
Although Coney Island Light will be fully automated before the end of the year, 
Schubert will continue to live in the century-old, two-story brick-keeper's 
house next to the light tower. 
</P>
<P>
"The Coast Guard wants me to stay on and I surely don't want to leave," said 
Schubert. "I will remain here as caretaker because of the threat of vandalism." 
</P>
<P>
If the lighthouse were unattended, he added, "there wouldn't be much left of 
the place after a few days. The Coast Guard could put up steel doors and steel 
blinds on the windows, but it would not make any difference. Thieves would come 
in and strip the place of everything of any value." 
</P>
<P>
"I was painting the outside of the house recently and came in to get a cup of 
coffee. When I returned, the ladder and can of paint were gone. Nothing is safe 
or sacred around here," he gloomily noted. 
</P>
<P>
Schubert, who was born on Staten Island across from the lighthouse, raised his 
three children at the Coney Island Light. His wife of 43 years, Marie, died 
three years ago. "She loved it here as much as I do. The Coast Guard says I can 
stay as long as I want. My plan is to stay as long as I live." 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't had a vacation since 1958 -- by choice. The only time he leaves, he 
said, is for a death in the family. He does all the plumbing, electricity, 
carpentry, painting and gardening on the two structures. 
</P>
<P>
He is responsible for maintaining the lighthouse and the light, which is 
visible for 14 miles and flashes 3/10ths of a second every five seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"The most excitement I can remember around here was about 10 years ago when a 
tanker and a freighter collided in the bay. They drifted by the lighthouse 
looking like a tremendous torch from the explosion. More than 19 men lost their 
lives aboard the two ships," recalled Schubert. 
</P>
<P>
Coney Island Lighthouse is still vital to scores of ships that come in and out 
of New York harbor every day. "Years ago most of the skippers on the ships 
would give me a three-whistle greeting," mused the lighthouse keeper. 
</P>
<P>
"That was in the good ol' days when all the lighthouses were manned. Captains 
on ships today probably think no one lives here any more, so why bother 
blasting the whistle. It's too bad. Times change."

WOMEN SPEAK OUT ON EFFECTS OF AIDS;

BOOKS: ANTHOLOGY EMPHASIZES THAT GAY WHITE MEN ARE NOT THE ONLY TARGETS OF

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tema Luft, a 36-year-old telephone company employee, took pride in never 
missing a day of work. She exercised five days a week, watched her diet and 
didn't drink or smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Then her doctor told her she was infected with the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept saying, 'This is all a mistake,' " she recalls. "It's not supposed to 
get people like me. I'm not gay. I'm not a man. I don't do drugs." 
</P>
<P>
It was no mistake. Luft, of Baltimore, now believes she was infected during a 
two-year sexual relationship with a former state trooper. 
</P>
<P>
"My doctor said the man could have used drugs or he could be bisexual and that 
never occurred to me," she says. "You can't judge a book by its cover." 
</P>
<P>
Luft is one of 41 women who tell their stories in "AIDS: The Women," an 
anthology from Cleis Press, a small publisher of feminist works in Pittsburgh 
and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Like Luft, some of the women in the book have been infected by acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome. Some have watched a husband, son or other loved one die of 
AIDS, and others are working to stop the disease from spreading. 
</P>
<P>
All of the stories challenge the myth that women are largely unaffected by the 
disease because they are just 9% of the 99,000 adult AIDS cases reported in 
this country. 
</P>

"AIDS is not just a disease affecting white gay men," says Ines Rieder, 
co-editor of the book. "It's something that concerns all of us, including 
women, and not just some particular risk group. Women really share in this 
disease." 
</P>
<P>
In New York City, AIDS is the leading cause of death among women aged 25 to 39, 
according to the city's health department. Besides killing these women, the 
disease is infecting their newborn children, who often die following a short, 
painful life. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving 
victims susceptible to infections and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by 
drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to 
their offspring. 
</P>
<P>
Luft's ordeal began more than two years ago when a co-worker noticed a lump on 
her neck. Three doctors were unable to determine why her lymph nodes were 
swollen. A fourth doctor finally tested her for the AIDS virus in February, 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, she has continued to work as a technician at C&amp;P Telephone Co. 
despite chronic diarrhea, fevers and fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
The job helps her forget. 
</P>
<P>
"I had long-term plans and I don't any more," she says. "I'm never going to 
have a relationship. I obviously never could consider having children. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like, 'Gee, do I keep working? Do I die at the phone company?' " 
</P>
<P>
Despite the opposition of her mother and other relatives, she went public with 
her story to help other women. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish more women like me would come forward," she says. "I'm not going to say 
it's easy. I took a lot of heat from my family, my friends and some business 
establishments." 
</P>
<P>
Luft has been thrown out of two beauty shops where she had her nails manicured 
and "got nicely uninvited" from a baby shower when the father-to-be learned she 
carried the AIDS virus. Still, she continues to speak at schools and anywhere 
else she is invited. 
</P>
<P>
"Women are just not aware that their partners could be IV (intravenous) drug 
users or could be bisexual," she says. "Let's face it, the average man is not 
going to come home and say to his partner, 'By the way honey, I was with this 
guy last night.' " 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Hampton, a 39-year-old former prostitute, writes in the book about her 
experiences tracking down prostitutes in Atlanta to hand out condoms and test 
for the AIDS virus as part of a federal study. 
</P>
<P>
One 23-year-old prostitute told Hampton she bought used, bent needles to shoot 
cocaine into her veins and laughed at the suggestion she should be concerned 
about the threat of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"Honey, I'm amazed I'm alive right now," the woman told Hampton. "I've got to 
come up with $400 each and every day, just to put in my arm. . . . That's what 
I have to worry about, not some disease that may kill me in five years. Get 
real." 
</P>
<P>
Another woman, Judi Stone of San Francisco, watched her homosexual 19-year-old 
son, Michael, die of AIDS in 1984. He had told her that after he died and was 
cremated he wanted her to be creative with his ashes. 
</P>
<P>
"I used them as fertilizer and I planted three bottlebrush (bushes)," she 
wrote. "I believe in recycling. Life goes on in different forms." 
</P>
<P>
Rieder, 34, also of San Francisco, began considering how women are affected by 
AIDS after spending three months at the bedside of a friend who died of the 
disease in 1986 in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
"You expect to grow old with your friends," she says. "You have this idea that 
you'll be 70 and sitting around a kitchen table chatting. AIDS really takes 
young people away." 
</P>
<P>
Rieder says she agreed to work on the book after research convinced her that 
men have been the focus of most books, television documentaries and news 
stories concerning AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"Women cannot afford to say we're not going to deal with the question of AIDS 
because it does not concern us," she said. "That doesn't correspond to reality 
any more."

PR PUSH IS ON FOR VODKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES SOCIETY WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The guest of honor was being treated to a party at the China Club, L.A.'s new 
chi-chi night spot, with celebrity guests, balloons, kleig lights and a price 
tag of $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
The guest of honor was a bottle of vodka. 
</P>
<P>
Tanqueray introduced its new Sterling vodka with such a party recently, hosted 
by Movietime on-air personality Katie Wagner and saluting the "trend-setters of 
the 1980s." The company commissioned a painting from artist/songwriter Allee 
Willis (an eclectic work prominently featuring Tanqueray Sterling bottles), 
served a chocolate cake in the shape of a Tanqueray Sterling bottle and invited 
actresses Justine Bateman, Katey Sagal and Lesley Ann Warren. 
</P>
<P>
While product launch parties are hardly new to the social scene, the party 
circuit has become crowded in recent months with events hosted, underwritten or 
having some tie-in to imported vodkas. 
</P>
<P>
An increasingly competitive market may be the reason. While hard liquor sales 
have dropped to the lowest point since the industry began surveying sales in 
1970, sales of imported vodkas have risen (although the imports still represent 
a small share of the U.S. vodka market). Last year, the sale of Absolut vodka 
from Sweden increased by 34%. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the newest entries to the field of imported vodkas are Great Britain's 
Tanqueray Sterling and Icy Vodka from Iceland. Absolut dominates the market, 
with the Soviet Union's Stolichnaya, Finlandia from Finland and Denaka from 
Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
Since all vodkas are flavorless, persuading consumers that one brand is 
superior to another in this crowded field is in good part a matter of image and 
has sparked marketing creativity, highlighted by eye-popping ads (Absolut's 
series of unusual bottles is one) and moving in on the glamorous social scene. 
</P>
<P>
Advertising can only go so far -- especially when hard liquor companies are 
restricted to print ads and while other pricey luxury items like perfumes and 
cosmetics offer sample cards in magazines, vodka can hardly follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
What better way to get consumers to sample their products than by offering them 
at glamorous social scenes? 
</P>
<P>
Companies have devised various ways of promoting their products on the party 
scene from underwriting charity events to donating bottles of their vodka at 
events to hosting theme parties that feature only their brand. 
</P>
<P>
Just how prominently the product is featured at events varies from company to 
company and party to party. Icy supplied several bottles of its vodka at a 
private dinner for patrons of the Los Angeles opera. The drink was served 
during the first course, with waiters pouring from sleek bottles perched on 
trays -- hardly a hard-sell. 
</P>
<P>
The sell began the following day when a reporter was contacted by the company's 
publicity firm, asking if the product was going to be mentioned in the party 
write-up (it was not), and if the publicist could call when Icy was served at 
subsequent parties to see if the same could be done. 
</P>
<P>
Carillon Importers, which distributes Absolut, has a West Coast publicist who 
often shows up at parties in traffic-stopping one-of-a-kind Absolut dresses 
designed by Seventh Avenue's finest, including Stephen Sprouse, Perry 
Ellis-label designer Marc Jacobs and Carmello Pomodoro. 
</P>
<P>
"Schieffelin &amp; Somerset (Sterling's distributor) has traditionally relied 
on public relations activities like sponsoring American Ballet Theatre or other 
charitable events to be one of the main engines to market a brand," says Clint 
Rodenberg, the company's senior vice president of marketing. Glamorous, 
celebrity-filled parties are a way to associate the product with the affluent, 
upscale market the vodka companies are after. "Our primary audience," says 
Rodenberg, "are young professional adults, 25 to 35, who make over $35,000 a 
year and live in metropolitan areas. If people associate Tanqueray Sterling 
vodka with Ally (Sheedy) and Katie (Wagner) and that young, affluent crowd, 
it's a very favorable association for us." 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest sell is the first one," says Bill Creason, senior brand manager 
for new products at Brown-Forman, the Louisville-based company that distributes 
Icy vodka. 
</P>
<P>
It is word-of-mouth that Icy -- which is going after the same yupscale market 
as the other premium vodka brands -- relies upon. 
</P>
<P>
"For trend-setters to adopt the product, it starts the word-of-mouth going," 
says Creason. "When that works in combination with advertising and in-store 
promotions and having it available at bars and restaurants, then people will 
see it and remember it." 
</P>
<P>
Tricia Barroll found "unchartered territory" when Carillon Importers made her 
its West Coast publicist to promote Absolut through parties. "Basically I make 
sure our product is in all the appropriate parties, where we can get good 
exposure to the right people, and I try to get press for us" she says. "The big 
thrust right now is tasting. We've done lots of tie-ins with L. A. Style 
magazine because that's a good crowd for us." 
</P>
<P>
The relationship between Absolut and L.A. Style is a mutually beneficial one. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes our magazine go 'round from a business point of view is 
advertising," says L.A. Style publisher Karen Fund. "We understand that the 
advertiser is looking for a certain kind of buyer, not just someone who is 
discerning, but a trend-setter in the community. With an advertiser we can say 
not only can we run an ad for you, but we can get the customer much closer to 
you than that with an event . . . and we can get them to taste your product."

There were about 3,600 work-related deaths and 5.6 million occupational 
injuries and illnesses among 83 million private-sector employees, a 1986 Bureau 
of Labor Statistics survey said. One-third of the injuries and illnesses were 
in manufacturing, which accounts for more than 20% of the work force. 
</P>
<P>
One of every 11 workers will be seriously injured or killed at work, according 
to the National Safe Workplace Institute. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. worker is injured every 16 seconds and one of every six workers will die 
from occupation-related diseases, the institute said. 
</P>
<P>
Disabilities 
</P>
<P>
Permanent work-related disabilities rose from 60,000 to 70,000 from 1986 to 
1987 -- nearly a 17% increase, the National Safety Council said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the rate of disabling work injuries per 1 million exposure hours 
dropped from 8.3 to 8.1 in the same period, the council noted. 
</P>
<P>
Dangerous Industries 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, ship building and repairing led the nation with 40.1 injuries and 
illnesses per 100 full-time workers, the government said. Among other hazardous 
industries were meatpacking and mobile homes construction. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. vs. Others 
</P>
<P>
The United States had the highest worker fatality rate compared with six other 
industrialized nations, the workplace institute said. Figures compiled by the 
International Labor Office showed the industrial accident death rate was 3.6 
per 100,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
Japan was second-highest with 2.3 deaths, followed by Italy, 1.6; France, 1; 
West Germany, 0.8; the United Kingdom, 0.4; Sweden, 0.1. (All figures 1986 
except Italy, 1984). 
</P>
<P>
Repetitive Trauma 
</P>
<P>
Reported repetitive trauma disorder cases, including hearing loss, rose from 
26,700 in 1983 to 72,940 in 1987, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
Such cases accounted for 38% of occupational illnesses in 1987, contrasted with 
28% in 1984, according to a Labor Department survey. Such ailments hit 4 of 
every 100 poultry processing and meatpacking workers in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Meatpacking 
</P>
<P>
More than a third of packinghouse workers will suffer a serious illness or 
injury this year, translating into more than 52,000 workers annually or 200 
daily, the United Food and Commercial Workers Union said. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1981 and 1983, meatpacking production jumped by 52%, the union said, 
while employment declined by almost 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Poultry 
</P>
<P>
Workers doing evisceration work handled 50 to 70 birds a minute in the '70s; 
now they're processing up to 90 birds a minute, the Institute for Southern 
Studies said. 
</P>
<P>
Construction, Mining and Manufacturing 
</P>
<P>
In construction, total lost workdays per 100 workers in 1987 came to 135.8, 
contrasted with 69.9 for all private-sector industries, the government said. 
The comparable statistic was 144 in mining and 95.5 in manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
Autos 
</P>
<P>
Total injury rates in large plants in the motor vehicle industry reported to 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 1987 were 2.5 times those reported in 1985, 
according to congressional testimony by the United Autoworkers Union. 
</P>
<P>
Costs 
</P>
<P>
The workplace institute estimates that a worker fatality costs the economy $1.4 
million, including lost income and taxes. Other estimates range from $900,000 
to $1.9 million.

Joseph Coria. The following information about Joseph Coria, a candidate for the 
Montebello City Council, was deleted from a list of candidates and their 
backgrounds in last Sunday's Southeast section. Coria, 46, has lived in the 
community for 14 years. He works as medical administrator at the Garmar Medical 
Group in Montebello. He is on the board of the Montebello Chamber of Commerce 
and is a member of the board of the Montebello Downtown Business Assn. Coria 
supports the right of the city to use eminent domain to acquire property for 
redevelopment, one of the hottest issues in this year's election. He is running 
on a seven-point platform that, among other things, calls for better police, 
fire and paramedic service in the city, more youth activities and more health 
awareness in the community.

SUPERFICIAL TRAITS RATED AS PIVOTAL IN TV-AGE ELECTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: AMERICANS PICK THEIR CANDIDATES THE WAY THEY BUY VEGETABLES, A 
RESEARCHER SUGGESTS. LOOK GOOD AND USUALLY YOU'VE GOT AN ADVANTAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Americans choose their elected leaders, in part, the same way they buy 
vegetables -- by appearance. 
</P>
<P>
By using only photographs, UC Irvine political science professor Shawn W. 
Rosenberg asked 700 people over the last year to rate real and mock politicians 
on characteristics such as competence, trustworthiness, leadership ability and 
political demeanor. He concluded that the best-looking, best-dressed candidates 
got much higher marks. 
</P>
<P>
By manipulating appearances -- showing pictures in which hair styles, clothing 
and makeup had been altered -- of six test candidates, Rosenberg found that he 
could push positive ratings up or down 20 percentage points. In a real 
election, the right looks could add 5% to 8% to a candidate's vote total, 
enough to swing a close race, concluded Rosenberg and his research partner, 
Boston University economics professor Shulamit Kahn. 
</P>
<P>
The manipulation study revealed that smiling, conservatively dressed 
politicians project a positive image. But Rosenberg also uncovered a few quirks 
that he is at a loss to explain, such as the strong preference for one eye 
shape. A rounded upper eyelid with a straight lower lid, he found, is preferred 
over eyes that do not curve on top or curve equally on top and bottom. And 
while baldness is bad for men, a widow's peak hairline is regarded as a sign of 
competence in women. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg, whose academic background is in both political science and 
psychology, set out to explore how Americans make sense of politics. He 
concluded that most people don't. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disturbed, yes. But surprised? No," Rosenberg said. "The amount of 
attention we pay to politicians is really minimal, even during an election 
period, and the overall understanding of issues is quite rudimentary. As a 
result, we rely on often superficial cues or pieces of information to direct 
our judgment of candidates and events. 
</P>
<P>
"What people are doing is saying, 'I don't really understand politics, so let 
me look at this person and decide if this person is trustworthy and competent.' 
But how you look is not necessarily who you are, because that can be 
manipulated so readily." 
</P>
<P>
The study focusing on manipulation of features and dress was the latest in a 
series of candidate preference works Rosenberg has done since 1984. It is 
expected to be published next year in the scholarly journal Political 
Psychology. The appearance studies have drawn attention -- and mixed reviews -- 
from politicians and the strategists who play a role in shaping the candidates' 
public images. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we haven't spent a lot of taxpayer money on these surveys," said 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who acted as a consultant in Christian F. 
(Rick) Thierbach's unsuccessful state legislative race against Republican Curt 
Pringle of Garden Grove last year. Katz discounted the study, in part because 
the mock candidates used by Rosenberg were unknown and presented without the 
context of a normal political campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Appearance plays a role in political success -- just as dressing appropriately 
for a job interview can help determine who gets the position, Katz agreed. And 
although he said that Thierbach's strait-laced demeanor and perceived 
standoffishness hurt the campaign, he said issues and party affiliation have 
more to do with winning votes than capped teeth. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to take (appearance) into account, but you can't let it be the 
determining factor," Katz said. "There is some truth to the notion that people 
get impressions based on how you hold your head, your body language, your 
dress. But I believe voters pay attention to the message. 
</P>
<P>
"I tend to give voters a lot of credit," Katz said, noting the several ballot 
measures that voters waded through last fall to overwhelmingly select one 
insurance reform measure over others. "People who live in ivory towers don't 
understand voters." 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Garden Grove), who hosted a cable television 
talk show for seven years before entering politics, said good looks and 
professional attire are critical to political success. 
</P>
<P>
"All things being equal, the candidate with the neatly combed or well-coiffed 
hair, the conservative dress and the professional demeanor will get elected," 
Dornan said. "Some congressmen get away with wearing some peculiar forms of 
dress -- you look at them and think, 'Maybe it was the issues there, maybe he's 
a good old boy who fits his district.' " 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Englander, a Newport Beach political consultant who has directed 
campaigns for Democrats and Republicans during a 21-year career, said he has 
used Rosenberg's findings and common sense to make over some of his candidates 
to enhance their election chances. But he doesn't consider such packaging a 
manipulation of voters. 
</P>
<P>
"I've changed a candidate's hair style, glasses, and gone shopping with the 
candidate for new suits and ties," he said. "My clients have a message to 
impart, and we want to create an atmosphere where that message is heard. I 
don't think the public will follow the message if they don't feel comfortable 
with the messenger." 
</P>
<P>
Light-colored shirts and dark suits work well for television appearances, but 
may not appeal to less formal voters in a rural district, Englander said. He 
also believes that candidates can't be too good-looking. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard that the average elected legislator is more attractive than the 
average person," he said. "I don't know if that's true. But I do know voters 
don't go for people who are too slick -- a George Hamilton look is not good for 
a candidate. There are no absolutes." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg, who has turned down offers to act as a paid image consultant to 
political candidates (whom he declines to name), said the emergence of 
television has forever changed the face of politics. 
</P>
<P>
Appearances have always played a role, but since the Kennedy-Nixon debate in 
1960, looks have been highlighted. Sen. John F. Kennedy, who wore a dark suit 
and used theatrical makeup, was a dramatic visual contrast to his presidential 
campaign opponent, Vice President Richard M. Nixon, who refused makeup to cover 
his 5 o'clock shadow, perspired profusely and looked gaunt and pale in a 
light-colored suit. 
</P>
<P>
"Before television, the key to election was manipulating the political party 
structure," Rosenberg said. "What you knew and who you knew, and family 
connections were also important. With the advent of television politics, the 
content of what you have to say is much less important. The party machinery is 
less important. 
</P>
<P>
"Visual impressions and image are far more important." 
</P>
<P>
To find out whether a candidate's appearance projects an image of his or her 
fitness for office and to what extent image affects voter preference, Rosenberg 
drew on family connections in the California film industry. 
</P>
<P>
"We used a makeup artist and a studio photographer," he said. "We found out we 
could manipulate most of the things we're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Using six women, aged 19 to 65, Rosenberg rearranged hair, dress and background 
settings. Makeup made broad faces appear narrower, long faces broader and 
changed hairlines to add a widow's peak or blur a natural peaked hairline. 
</P>
<P>
Positive and negative photographs of the six candidates were then presented in 
phony campaign flyers as Republican and Democratic party nominees. Regardless 
of party affiliation or issue positions, the candidates who rated highest on 29 
appearance characteristics also consistently won the highest voter ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Photographs of male candidates, including dozens of real congressmen and 
senators, were rated in a previous study with similar results. Mature age -- 
perhaps associated with wisdom by voters -- was a plus for both men and women. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his findings, Rosenberg would not advise a radical make-over or 
cosmetic surgery for political hopefuls. If the only object is winning, 
American political life is diminished, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had plenty of successful politicians who would not conform to my notions 
of the best-looking," he said. Senate Majority Whip Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) 
has overcome the potential negatives of his bald pate and thin build, Rosenberg 
said, and Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) has turned his unfashionable bow ties into a 
trademark. 
</P>
<P>
"Political skills and ideas still count for a lot. And half of the game is just 
getting to the point where the voting population can assess you," Rosenberg 
said. "First, you have to be a party nominee." 
</P>
<P>
TURNING THE BEST POLITICAL CHEEK 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine political science professor Shawn W. Rosenberg found that by changing 
hair styles, clothing and makeup of test candidates in certain ways, it was 
possible to alter ratings by 20 percentage points. In a real election, 
Rosenberg contends, the right looks could add 5% to 8% to a candidate's vote 
total, enough to swing a close race.

Two men have admitted digging at an Indian burial ground without a permit. 
Bruce Owens, 50, of Oak Run, Shasta County, and Frederick Lindauer, 55, of 
Manton, Tehama County, pleaded guilty to one felony count of unauthorized 
excavation of archeological resources on federal land. U.S. Forest Service 
rangers arrested the two men while they were digging with shovels in the Lassen 
National Forest about 30 miles north of Chico. The men had found arrowheads and 
small tools in a 1,000-year-old Yana Indian village site.

NEWPORT PASTOR WAS A NIXON CONFIDANTE IN THE WATERGATE ERA 
</P>

NEWPORT BEACH

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rev. John Huffman reached for a worn Bible in his book-lined study. It was 
a gift, he said, a gesture of graciousness, from a man in the midst of a 
glorious but doomed career. The inscription says that Huffman, as a messenger 
of God's word, "strengthened each of us in the work of peace and human 
justice." 
</P>
<P>
It was signed Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
Now pastor of the 4,000-member St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church in Newport 
Beach, Huffman wrestles with the day's political issues, like abortion and 
homosexuality. But he's no stranger to the moral hot seat. From 1968-73, the 
years dominated by the war in Vietnam and the Watergate scandal, he was the 
confidante of a besieged President. 
</P>
<P>
Though Huffman, 50, has been pastor of St. Andrew's for 11 years, he said few 
members of his congregation are aware of his past. He has rarely been asked 
about Nixon since the turmoil of the final days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual interview he granted recently, he stressed he could not, as a 
pastor, reveal any confidences made by Nixon at that time. But he did talk 
about his feelings toward Nixon and some of the drama surrounding that 
turbulent era. 
</P>
<P>
He recalled that Nixon, reared an evangelical Quaker, rarely attended church 
services in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"He lived with the fear that the same thing would happen to him that happened 
to Lyndon Johnson -- that he would go to church and be attacked from the 
pulpit." 
</P>
<P>
But when Nixon vacationed in Florida, he and his family attended services at 
Huffman's Presbyterian church in Key Biscayne, Fla., which was recommended to 
Nixon by his friend Bebe Rebozo, a regular churchgoer. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon came to church on Easters, after his inauguration and following his trips 
to China and the Soviet Union. When he came, the services drew about 80 
reporters and were usually picketed by war protesters. One called Huffman a 
"pig" and threatened him with an ice pick, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, news analysts called Huffman, who had his own radio and television 
shows, "flamboyant" and "handsome and not particularly modest." They noted that 
Huffman's rise in prominence paralleled his association with the President. 
Photographs of the two show dark, wavy-haired men who could be brothers. 
</P>
<P>
After Nixon came to his church, he was indeed offered his own television 
ministry but turned it down, he said. "I predicted then the TV ministries would 
get tripped up by finances." 
</P>
<P>
Huffman, who once aspired to politics "as a Christian witness," said Nixon 
appreciated his worldly views as well as his sin-and-repentance style of 
preaching. At Nixon's request, Huffman preached at the White House and held a 
special televised service at Key Biscayne to mark the cease fire in the Vietnam 
War, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The day before the United States invaded Cambodia, Nixon shared intelligence 
information with Huffman over breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked with him behind the scenes about his (political) problems," Huffman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After the Easter Sunday service in 1973 -- amid increasing revelations about 
the Watergate scandal -- Huffman said he walked Nixon to his car and asked him 
directly whether he knew anything about the 1972 break-in at the Democratic 
National Committee offices. "Nixon assured me, 'I knew nothing about it.' I can 
picture his eyes. They were . . . intent." 
</P>
<P>
While Huffman believed him, that day heralded the beginning of a long 
estrangement of the two. Huffman's sermon that day used a Biblical allusion -- 
"The King knoweth of these things . . . this thing was not done in a corner." 
It was widely interpreted by the media as criticism of Nixon's involvement in 
the cover-up and a call for him to repent. 
</P>
<P>
Huffman said the sermon was written before he knew Nixon would attend and was 
not directed at him. But he learned through the "White House people" that 
eventually Nixon suspected the worst -- that he had been attacked from the 
pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the publication of secretly taped conversations between Nixon and his 
aides revealed him to be active in the Watergate cover-up. A Key Biscayne news 
account that included Huffman's reaction carried the headline, "Nixon Lied to 
Me, Former Minister Says." That day, he said, the husband of a church member 
spat in his face and called him "traitor." Although he had moved by that time 
to be pastor of a church in Pittsburgh, Huffman said, "I received hundreds of 
letters across the country, castigating me for attacking the greatest President 
this country ever had." 
</P>
<P>
"It would break my heart if I would ever say anything unkind to him. At the 
same time, the record has to stand as it is. He was one of the most complex, in 
my view brilliant, presidents. And he has a sinister side to him. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"He certainly dealt with fear, or whatever, in terms of the Kennedys, but he 
would say to this day that he was loyal to John Mitchell and loyalty was one of 
his highest priorities. Others would say, 'How come (White House aides H.R.) 
Haldeman and (John D.) Ehrlichman are in jail?" 
</P>
<P>
As for himself, Huffman said, "I love Richard Nixon." He used the word gracious 
repeatedly to characterize Nixon then and now. 
</P>
<P>
Huffman said he and Nixon have become friends again. He said he wrote the 
pardoned president several years ago praising his speeches on international 
relations and saying he regretted the parting of their paths in 1973. "I said I 
was honestly trying to express my viewpoints on things and I loved him like my 
own father. He wrote back very graciously, saying let's let bygones by bygones. 
Life is too short to carry feelings too long. 
</P>
<P>
"And he sent me his book on leaders, which is very graciously inscribed." 
</P>
<P>
This one reads, "To John Huffman, with best wishes."

<P>
The lingering effects of a years-old kickback scandal and divisive labor 
disputes have made the Orange Unified School District board race the most 
crowded and controversial of the eight school contests on the Nov. 7 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Plagued by the scandal and a seven-day teachers' strike last spring, the first 
in the county in three years, the district also has had more recent problems. 
Board members were accused of making a controversial school-boundary change out 
of the public eye by traveling to Palm Springs in August and making the 
decision there. 
</P>
<P>
This tumultuous atmosphere has resulted in 19 candidates vying for four 
single-district seats and an unexpired term in a fifth area. 
</P>
<P>
The three incumbents seeking reelection to the seven-member board have 
struggled to get out from under the shadow of Orange County's biggest school 
scandal in a decade. One of them, county General Services Agency supervisor Joe 
J. Cherry, could face a new trial on charges in connection with the kickback 
scandal that rocked the district more than three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say that by running again, Cherry is prolonging the district's 
inability to move beyond its infamy. Cherry, however, says he's running partly 
to vindicate himself. 
</P>
<P>
Six candidates have filed to run against him in Area 5, the highest number of 
challengers in any of the Orange Unified races. 
</P>
<P>
"The shadow is not only over the board, but it's all over the whole district," 
said Kevin Rice, a businessman who is seeking election to another vacant seat. 
</P>
<P>
The other two trustees implicated in the matter, Ruth C. Evans, who has served 
20 years on the board, and Robert James Elliott, who has served for 25 years, 
are not seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
The three were accused by the 1986-87 Orange County Grand Jury of "willful 
misconduct in office" for allegedly not minding the store while thousands of 
dollars in kickback contracts were negotiated from the district's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The other two incumbents seeking reelection besides Cherry, board President 
Sandy Englander and trustee Jane McCracken, have consistently reminded voters 
that they were not on the board when the alleged incidents of mismanagement 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
McCracken was named to the board in February to fill a vacancy when member 
William Steiner was appointed to the Orange City Council. By law, the district 
must put his position on the ballot even though there are only two years left 
in Steiner's four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
The district has more than 25,000 students and includes the cities of Orange 
and Villa Park, and portions of Anaheim, Garden Grove and Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign has been marked by high spending -- some candidates say they are 
spending as much as $20,000 -- political consultants advising the candidates 
and a variety of forums in which district employees have tried to challenge 
incumbents on the issues. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, about 80% of the district's 1,200 non-teaching employees 
staged a sickout to protest a breakdown in wage negotiations. An agreement has 
yet to be reached in that matter. On Thursday about 200 chanting non-classified 
employees demonstrated outside the district's offices as board members were 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Also this month, parents criticized the board for making a controversial change 
in school attendance boundaries while they were at a retreat in Palm Springs, 
with no members of the public present. 
</P>
<P>
Several representatives of the teacher's union, wearing buttons that said, 
"Kids, not Politics," presented a "State of the Schools" report to the board 
Thursday night, citing overcrowded classrooms and lack of support for the 
district's bilingual education program. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the district's teachers staged a seven-day strike over wage 
negotiations, and relations between them and the district are still less than 
cordial. 
</P>
<P>
The unions for both employee groups have jointly endorsed a field of 
candidates, but did not support any incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
They endorsed Nancy Moore, a former teacher who is now an administrator for the 
Azusa Unified School District, for Area 3, the seat now held by McCracken; Lila 
Beavans, a consultant to the Orangewood Children's Foundation, in Area 4, 
Elliott's seat; Barry Resnick, a department chairman at Rancho Santiago College 
for Area 5, who is running against Cherry; and James Preston, a medical doctor, 
for Area 7, Evans' old seat. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers did not endorse in the Area 1 race, the seat held by Englander. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it's time for a change," Stover said in a recent interview. "We feel 
there's got to be a change in the direction of the school board. We're tired of 
politics being the major motivator in this district. 
</P>
<P>
"Teachers are very frustrated because we know this is a good district in spite 
of everything around us," she said. "Yet it's getting more and more difficult 
to stay here and fight the good fight when you really don't have the support, 
when downtown has other priorities." 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest issue facing incumbents during this election is the ghost of 
the past few years' troubles. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Bennyhoff, who delivers sharp barbs to the board every chance he gets or in 
Common Talk, a community newspaper partly owned by his wife, says the board has 
not overcome the taint of the bid-rigging scandal. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a general sense of unease, a general sense of mistrust dating back to 
the early '80s," he said recently. "I don't believe the people of this district 
have confidence in this board. . . . People still believe things are just not 
right down there, and they will not support any of the current board members." 
</P>
<P>
Several candidates running for public office for the first time say that it was 
those events that prompted them to enter the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
In his campaign literature, candidate Al Irish, an accountant running for the 
Area 7 seat, talks about "the lack of trust and confidence the public, parents 
and school employees have here in Orange." Candidate Beavans says in a flyer: 
"The lack of leadership at the board level has caused serious problems in poor 
morale among parents and employees." 
</P>
<P>
Other candidates say that the current board has spent so much time keeping 
itself out of legal hot water that it hasn't had time to deal with the business 
of educating children. 
</P>
<P>
"Our district has declined into a private club that is concerned less with our 
children or schools and more with politics," said James Preston, another Area 7 
candidate. "I honestly believe the Orange Unified school board has let our 
children down." 
</P>
<P>
Terri Sargent, a part-time land-use planner with the county, said she is 
challenging Cherry "because I want to put the focus back on the needs of 
children." 
</P>
<P>
A two-year investigation by the Orange Police Department and the district 
attorney's office resulted in the 1987 indictments of former district 
maintenance supervisor Steven L. Presson, his wife and two contractors. They 
were charged with misappropriation of public funds, but the complex case has 
been stalled by delays and has yet to go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
While no criminal action was taken against three members who were on the board 
at the time of the alleged bid-rigging, the civil charges against them could 
lead to a loss of office. A fourth board member, Eleanore Pleines, was also 
accused by the grand jury, but she resigned her seat in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Cherry continues to fight the charges because he believes he should not be 
penalized for the criminal actions of someone else. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just beyond me to know how I'm supposed to know what happens in the heart 
of an organization when I come in part time and only as a policy-maker," he 
said. "We (the trustees) are actually policy-setters. We set policy and give 
direction to the superintendent." 
</P>
<P>
He added that he would not be spending so much money to defend himself if he 
was not innocent. The three board members have been told that if they do not 
seek reelection, the charges will be dropped, because the only penalty is 
removal from office.

"If I don't run, I still have an obligation for a good deal of money to a legal 
firm, and if I don't run, . . . it's all over, I'll have been smeared and I'll 
never have an opportunity to defend myself. The decision to run was not 
difficult. The decision not to run would have been extremely difficult for me." 
</P>
<P>
The incumbents say they realize that the baggage they bring from the past few 
years could weigh them down during this campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess right now I think we've been through a very hard last four years," 
Englander said. The investigations and charges "really put most of us back a 
while," she said. "A lot of effort went into not so much defending (the three 
board members), but we did file our own lawsuit against Presson and that took 
up a lot our time. . . . It really has been a drain on our energies."

DIANNE KLEIN: IF HE CAN SELL YOU A JAGUAR, THEN WHY NOT A BURGER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dianne Klein 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lee West sells cars -- Jaguars, Ferraris, Aston-Martins, Lotuses, Range Rovers 
-- and hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
"I sell cars for up to $200,000," he says. Each. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. West doesn't know what his hamburgers go for. He'd have to look at a menu, 
which would be downstairs, in the diner. 
</P>
<P>
We are sitting on upholstered chairs in Mr. West's office at Newport Imports, 
which overlooks the marble showroom floor on which polished Jaguars rest. The 
diner -- chrome, marble, tasteful muted gray -- is just off the showroom, 
through the side doors, across the breezeway from the Jaguar boutique. 
</P>
<P>
"We did the diner just like this place," Mr. West says with an expansive wave 
over his auto empire. "You see how this office is. It's done first-class." 
</P>
<P>
About 20 years ago, Mr. West says, proffering hamburgers, let alone Jaguars, 
was just a dream. He had been a metallurgist, working for General Motors, when 
he sensed the excitement of sales. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to call on dealerships, trying to sell them RVs," Mr. West says. 
</P>
<P>
One of those trips took him to Galpin Ford, in Van Nuys, home of the nation's 
first car dealership-restaurant. Mr. West liked the idea -- "If you think about 
it, it makes sense" -- but back then, he did not have the means to do much 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
That was before Mr. West built this nice office on Coast Highway, or acquired 
his two diamond rings, his thick gold bracelet, his diamond-studded Rolex and 
his gold jaguar cuff links, possessions of which he is justifiably proud. 
</P>
<P>
"I am somewhat of a self-made individual," he says. "Whatever I have, I worked 
for." 
</P>
<P>
But on the day that I visited Mr. West, he was in no mood to rest on his 
laurels -- not that he seems the type of person to do much resting. 
</P>
<P>
"For $300, a guy can stop my whole process," Mr. West says, disgusted. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jan Dr. Vandersloot, a dermatologist who lives in Newport Beach, is the guy 
to whom Mr. West refers. Actually, it was $331 that Dr. Vandersloot spent on an 
appeal to the Newport City Council to overturn the Planning Commission's 
approval of Mr. West's diner. 
</P>
<P>
This approval has been rather fickle. Two years ago, when Mr. West submitted 
plans for a new dealership and employee cafeteria, the city approved. But then 
Mr. West says he changed his mind about the employee cafeteria part. 
</P>
<P>
"As I started building the dealership, and you looked at the thing, how nice it 
was, I said, 'How are you going to keep the public out of here?' " he says. 
</P>
<P>
But when word leaked out about the Jaguar Diner, the city said no go, citing 
increased traffic among other concerns. Nonetheless he opened the illegal diner 
in May. The city filed a lawsuit, but never pursued it. 
</P>
<P>
Then Mr. West commissioned his own traffic study, which turned out to be 
favorable to his cause, and the city approved the diner last month. 
</P>
<P>
Now Dr. Vandersloot hopes, but doesn't really expect, that the city will 
commission yet another traffic study at a council meeting Monday night and 
close the diner in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
"The city is letting him get away with all this," Dr. Vandersloot says. "I am 
rankled because what he is doing is illegal. It is not right and the city is 
sweeping it under the rug. This is an in-the-face-type challenge to the city of 
Newport Beach." 
</P>
<P>
Mr. West, of course, does not see it in quite the same way. He is a 
businessman, a dreamer, a man with plans. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no place around here where you could get a hamburger," Mr. West 
says, "a cheap and decent meal. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"You see that eyesore over there?" he says as he motions through his office 
window toward a building he is buying next door. "I can't clean any of that up. 
I'm still waiting." 
</P>
<P>
Mr. West hopes to demolish the building and put up a parking lot, which would 
be extremely convenient for the Jaguar Diner, which, incidentally, was 
originally designed with the help of Ruby's Diner, the restaurant chain based 
in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Ruby's owners say their company has since pulled out of the Jaguar Diner, at 
least until all this permit business is straightened out. (If they do become 
involved again, however, they say they might replace the diner's life-size, 
rotating gold jaguar -- the animal, not the automobile -- with a bumper car.) 
</P>
<P>
But all that is just talk, of which, quite frankly, Mr. West is tired. He wants 
to get on with things. For starters, although the diner is still open, he is 
losing money on it. He hasn't advertised so as not to make things any messier. 
</P>
<P>
Bert Boeckmann, for one, knows about those kind of people. When Mr. Boeckmann, 
owner of Galpin Ford, opened his Horseless Carriage restaurant in 1966, he 
heard from his share of naysayers as well. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem we had was people really didn't have any place nice to go when 
their car was being repaired or when they wanted to think about things," Mr. 
Boeckmann says. "This way, when they say, 'Oh, gee, give me a little time to 
think about it,' we can say, 'Have lunch and dinner right with us. We're here 
to serve you. We'll be here after dinner too.' " 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Boeckmann, voicing a concern similar to Mr. West's, says that when he 
opened the Horseless Carriage, the only other nearby restaurant was a Howard 
Johnson's down the street. 
</P>
<P>
"And they weren't doing half the business we were. I know that because I bought 
it and turned it into a Hyundai dealership!" 
</P>
<P>
The experience of Mr. Boeckmann, who says he has never heard of Mr. West, will 
undoubtably do little to assuage the fears of people such as Dr. Vandersloot. 
Had he to do it over, Mr. Boeckmann says he would have made the Horseless 
Carriage much bigger, with lots more parking. 
</P>
<P>
"People come from all over to come to the restaurant," he says. "We're open 
from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. We're fully staffed. We do catering. . . . Why, two 
weeks ago, I stopped by on a Sunday after church and I met a man who's been 
coming here for 23 years." 
</P>
<P>
And all Mr. West asks for is a place to get a hamburger. For the time being, he 
can still find it right downstairs.

Corridors -- An agreement to preserve more than 9,500 additional acres of open 
space in Irvine, approved Tuesday by the City Council, includes provisions for 
narrow "spines" of land connecting the parcels to each other and to the 
Cleveland National Forest and Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife will use these natural corridors to move between the open spaces, 
biologists say, adding that such passageways will become more vital as Southern 
California's natural areas are reduced. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement with the Irvine Co., Irvine will have more than 16,000 
acres of protected open space. Among the areas protected in the latest deal is 
Quail Hill -- along the San Diego Freeway near Sand Canyon Road -- where 
hundreds of migrating Canada geese spend the winters. 
</P>

OLLIE NORTH GETS CELEBRITY WELCOME AT GOP MEETING

Former Lt. Col. Oliver North, a hero to conservatives despite his conviction in 
the Iran-Contra affair, retained his celebrity status Saturday in Orange County 
at a Republican Party-sponsored dinner, where he spoke of the evils of big 
government, communism and Nicaraguan leader Daniel Ortega. 
</P>
<P>
Like some box-office-busting movie star, the fired White House aide was 
interrupted during dinner on several occasions as fans trickled up to his table 
to get autographs and have their picture taken with North, despite requests 
they remain seated. 
</P>
<P>
"Please let the colonel eat," said Bill Harrison, a director of the South 
Orange County Republican Assembly, which held the $50-per-person fund-raising 
dinner at the Southampton banquet hall. 
</P>
<P>
North reacted with a smile and chuckle to Harrison's remark. And after his 
30-minute speech before 190 people, North good-naturedly posed for photos. 
</P>
<P>
He briefly touched on the news that Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega on 
Friday had renounced a 19-month-old cease-fire with the Contra rebels and 
ordered the Nicaraguan army to resume offensive military operations next week. 
</P>
<P>
"How could the major media be shocked that Ortega is throwing out the cease 
fire?" remarked North, who became a celebrity during Senate hearings on the 
Iran-Contra affair and his subsequent trial. "That government never had any 
moral authority." 
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the way U.S. citizens have warmly embraced Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. "Oh how I wish I had his (public relations) agent," North 
said, calling Gorbachev "a media meister." 
</P>
<P>
"We ought not to succumb to the personality of one man who at any moment could 
cease to be on the scene," North said. 
</P>
<P>
Although North failed to draw a capacity crowd in the 300-seat banquet hall, 
the audience was peppered with notables such as state Sen. Marian Bergeson 
(R-Newport Beach) and Harold Ezell, former western regional director of the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
"When I heard Col. North was coming here, I was interested to hear what makes a 
man like that tick," Ezell said. "This is a man who has done something for his 
country and got in trouble for it." 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson introduced North to the audience, saying, "What we need in the United 
States are more heroes, those people we can hold up to emulate the ideals that 
mean so much to all of us." 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone on the scene was an Ollie booster. 
</P>
<P>
Bret Gross Johnson, 37, of San Clemente stood in front of the hall wearing a 
sandwich board sign plastered with various messages, among them: "Stop the 
Murder," "No More Vietnams," "Hands Off Central America" and "Question 
Authority." 
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned. A lot has happened in the Iran-Contra affair that may never 
come to light," said Johnson, who was needled by several people entering the 
function. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, North told the audience that a bigger government would not solve the 
nation's problems. Instead, North said, the populace should return to the 
ideals espoused by Thomas Jefferson of "God-given" life, liberty and justice.

2 HURT AS MOTORCYCLE CRASHES AT HIGH SPEED IN COSTA MESA

Jose Guillermo Olmedo Rojas, 22, bought his powerful motorcycle just a week 
ago. He was proud of the bike and so, when he met 18-year-old Camille Jones at 
a party in Costa Mesa on Friday night, he suggested a spin. 
</P>
<P>
The pair hadn't driven too far when Olmedo, traveling at more than 60 m.p.h., 
lost control of his Suzuki 1100 on a curving stretch of Iowa Street and plowed 
into two parked cars, said investigator Steve Rautus of the Costa Mesa Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Olmedo, who was wearing a helmet, suffered a mangled right leg when he slammed 
into the cars and then became entangled in the rear wheel of the motorcycle, 
Rautus said. In addition, he suffered a broken right arm and nerve and tendon 
damage to the arm. Jones, who was not wearing a helmet, was thrown from the 
bike. She suffered a concussion and scrapes. 
</P>
<P>
Olmedo, of Costa Mesa, and Jones, of Coto de Caza, were in stable condition 
Saturday at United Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"The passenger is alive by the grace of God," said Rautus, who had just 
returned from visiting Jones and Olmedo at the hospital. "She has a scrape on 
her shoulder, but not even a mark on her face." 
</P>
<P>
Rautus said Jones told police she met Olmedo at a friend's party. 
</P>
<P>
"He had just gotten the motorcycle," Rautus said. "He was a friend of one of 
(Jones') friends, so she decided to go for a ride with him on the motorcycle." 
</P>
<P>
High speed was the apparent cause of the crash, which is still under 
investigation, Rautus said. Olmedo, who carried a valid driver's license but 
had no motorcycle validation, was not ticketed. 
</P>
<P>
"We have established that he was traveling in excess of 60 m.p.h. in a 
25-m.p.h. residential zone," Rautus said. "Traffic was light and alcohol was 
not a factor." 
</P>
<P>
No other drivers were involved in the crash, which occurred near New Hampshire 
Drive.

OWNERS PICKET POUND FOR PUP IN PRISON 
</P>

<P>
He may be in puppy prison, but he's still got family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 of them picketed the Orange County Animal Shelter on Saturday, calling 
for the release of Beijing Blue, a chowchow facing a hearing for biting two 
people in less than a month. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with placards stenciled with the words "Free Beijing" and "Your Dog Could 
Be Next," the Laguna Hills couple who own the imprisoned animal marched along 
with several neighbors and friends in front of the county shelter in Orange for 
about three hours. 
</P>
<P>
"It's absolutely ridiculous," said Chris Chrestay, who with her husband, Mark, 
owns the dog. "They have sentenced our dog to death. He's not an aggressive 
dog. They're playing games with us." 
</P>
<P>
Workers at the shelter declined to comment on the pickets or the dog's case, 
but said Beijing Blue remained penned up inside throughout the three-hour 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Eric Stavenhagen of the county animal shelter said he does not know when a 
hearing on the dog's case will be held, but noted that a death sentence is not 
always the result of such cases. Some dogs are released to their owners with 
requirements that the animal be strictly restrained and placed in a muzzle when 
in public, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Beijing Blue was seized by animal control officials in early September after 
two separate biting incidents were reported involving the dog. 
</P>
<P>
In August, the chowchow bit a neighbor while the woman was attempting to break 
up a fight between Beijing Blue and her own dog. A few weeks later, Beijing 
Blue bit an 11-year-old neighborhood girl who was visiting the Chrestays. The 
attack came when the girl's own dog was trying to force its way onto the 
couple's property, Chris Chrestay said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the girl's wounds did not require stitches, a doctor who treated the 
child reported the episode to county animal control officials as required by 
law, according to the Chrestays. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an unfortunate accident," Chris Chrestay said. "But the girl's family 
does not want the dog to be held. The family wants Beijing to come home to us." 
</P>
<P>
Animal control officials, however, investigated the biting incidents on Sept. 
10 and decided to impound the dog, citing the county's vicious animals 
ordinance, which gives them authority to destroy dogs involved in repeated or 
particularly violent attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Beijing Blue has remained incarcerated in the Orange County Animal Shelter ever 
since, while his owners have waged a spirited defense in hopes of legally 
springing him from his pen. 
</P>
<P>
The couple has hired an attorney to press the dog's case and a behavioral 
scientist to produce a canine psychological profile, which shows Beijing Blue 
to be a basically non-aggressive pet. So far, the Chrestays have spent $6,000 
to fight for the return of their pet, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"This all is very painful to us," Chris Chrestay said. "This dog is not a dog 
to us. He's a member of our family. We want him home with us. If they want 
restrictions on us, fine. We'll abide by that." 
</P>
<P>
Chrestay said she was told a hearing to determine the dog's fate may be held 
Nov. 14 before an arbitrator. If the ruling goes against Beijing Blue, the 
couple's attorney will file for an injunction in Superior Court to block any 
action against the dog, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people don't realize that they have a recourse they can take," she 
said. "I've had several people call me to say they've had this same thing 
happen to them." 
</P>
<P>
She doesn't understand why animal control officials will not relent, but 
suspects they have a predisposed bias against chowchows. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very careful with him," Chris Chrestay said. "We love him. But they 
won't give us our dog back. They're just bent on killing him."

SCOUTS CLIMB, CUT, COOK IN CARDBOARD TO ENTERTAIN 35,000 AT ANAHEIM STADIUM

<P>
Learning how to cook in a cardboard box may not be an answer to the microwave, 
but as any Scout will say, it sure can come in handy. 
</P>
<P>
That exhibit, along with others such as pole climbing and log sawing, were 
among the many skills that were demonstrated Saturday at the annual Orange 
County Scout Fair at Anaheim Stadium, which drew more than 35,000 participants 
and onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
About 350 exhibits transformed the stadium's parking lot and a part of its 
interior into a fair-like festival, titled "Friendship, Fellowship and Fun," 
where Scouts displayed their know-how in typical and not-so-typical Boy 
Scouting activities. The annual event has been held in Orange County for more 
than 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
One troop built a makeshift beach -- complete with sand and volleyball court -- 
and another sponsored a Batman beanbag toss as several groups put on 
non-traditional displays in an attempt to add contemporary appeal to the nearly 
80-year-old national organization. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always some group that comes up with something crazy and unique," said 
Devon Dougherty, a spokesman for the Orange County Council of the Boy Scouts of 
America, which has about 79,000 members. "There's physical activities, there's 
mental activities, and there's pretty much people having a good time." 
</P>
<P>
That's what 9-year-old David Clark was doing. 
</P>
<P>
"We're having lots of fun," said David, a member of Troop 314 in Westminster. 
"This is a really special day. It's like a fair; all the troops do their own 
exhibits and then a lot of people come here and see." 
</P>
<P>
It was literally good, clean fun when the Orange County Firefighters Assn. 
turned on their foam bubble machine -- something used for extinguishing oil 
fires -- and offered some hot, tired Scouts a chance to cool off. 
</P>
<P>
Local police officers, search and rescue team representatives and members of 
the American Red Cross demonstrated first aid and safety tips, including 
information on earthquake preparedness and survival. 
</P>
<P>
Also scattered throughout the exhibits were anti-drug and anti-gang displays, 
evidence of Scouting's attempt to match its ideals with contemporary issues. 
"It's something we've been doing for a while," Dougherty said. "We keep pushing 
it more and more." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the parents at the event said their children benefit not only from 
Scouting's fun, but also from the guidance the organization offers them. 
</P>
<P>
"Scouting provides the tools to be good human beings," said Michael Ceccanese, 
who was once a Scout and is now Scoutmaster for his son's Troop 699 in Irvine's 
Meadow Park. "It teaches camaraderie, loyalty . . . what you need to be a 
solid, caring, outgoing human being."

SIBERIAN ISLAND, WITH FEW AMENITIES, SEEKS INVESTORS

YUZHNO-SAKHALINSK, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet Union is trying eagerly to lure investors to Sakhalin, but foreign 
businessmen think Moscow is naive in thinking that foreigners will flock to the 
remote island off Siberia under present conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Sakhalin, in the Soviet Far East, opened to foreigners only last year, has 
recently played host to foreign businessmen, mostly from South Korea and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
But a gulf seems to separate the two sides on what comes first -- 
infrastructure or foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
"This question of infrastructure may be solved only by foreign capital from 
joint ventures," said Ivan Kuropatko, a Sakhalin official. "The Japanese are 
hesitating just because they don't want to lose their money. There are no real 
obstacles (to investment)." 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's possible to establish joint ventures from zero by reorganizing 
certain existing enterprises and using foreign capital to modernize them," said 
economist Piotr Baklanov of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences in Khabarovsk. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade official Valerian Timofeev said he believed that the rich 
resources of timber and fish on the island -- which lies some 25 miles to the 
north of Japan's northern island of Hokkaido and covers almost 30,000 square 
miles -- would provide the main lure to foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
An internal Japanese Foreign Ministry memorandum obtained by Reuters was 
doubtful that Japanese businessmen should leap into ventures in Sakhalin. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sakhalin authorities eagerly press for foreign joint ventures, but 
transport, accommodation and other infrastructure need to be taken care of by 
them beforehand," it said. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese, wooed assiduously for their technology and money, worry that 
there is no clear-cut law or government policy on joint ventures, the memo 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
A Japanese official who visited the Soviet Far East recently said he was asked 
repeatedly by his Soviet counterparts why the Japanese are not flocking to 
invest there. 
</P>
<P>
He cited problems of communications -- three hours or more to place an overseas 
call. "That's even without a typhoon as an excuse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"And after midnight, the water stops in these places," the official said. "On 
top of that, there's a labor shortage. How can you expect Japanese to put money 
into such a place?" 
</P>
<P>
It will take at least 20 years before the infrastructure could be in place -- 
unlike the three years predicted by the Soviets, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
H.K. Kang, a Tokyo-based South Korean businessman who was in Sakhalin to 
explore business opportunities, said he left without making a deal. 
</P>
<P>
"Although they talk about perestroika, their allocations of electricity, 
gasoline and other key things are totally inadequate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He bemoaned a lack of precise data on local conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to many groups about population, etc., but everybody gave me 
different figures, especially on industry. This wouldn't work with the 
Japanese, who want precise data." 
</P>
<P>
So far, six joint ventures have been made, including a Japanese restaurant in 
the southwestern Sakhalin port of Kholmsk. The largest is a $26-million 
fish-processing plant venture, also with Japanese partners. 
</P>
<P>
One grave problem on Sakhalin is the complete lack of decent hotels to attract 
foreign businessmen or tourists. 
</P>
<P>
The shabby Tourist Hotel where a group of Western reporters stayed lacked hot 
water and had leaky toilets, with the water level rising to ankle-level.

MILLIONS BURNED AS REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS FIZZLE; 
</P>

INVESTMENT: ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO BENEFITED FROM DEPRECIATION NOW FIND THOSE 
HUGE WRITE-OFFS COMING BACK TO HAUNT THEM IN THE FORM OF HIGHER TAXES.

<P>
Real estate limited partnerships, the sizzling tax-shelter investment strategy 
of the early 1980s, are leaving millions of Americans feeling burned as the 
decade closes. 
</P>
<P>
A victim of its own excesses, overbuilding in major real estate markets and 
flip-flops in federal tax policies, the real estate limited partnership 
industry is withering, according to numerous speakers at the Real Estate 
Securities and Syndication Institute conference here this month. Investment 
levels have plummeted, leaving the formerly high-flying sponsors of the 
programs struggling to survive. 
</P>
<P>
Many investors, meanwhile, are just beginning to realize that they will not 
recoup their money, they could face serious tax consequences and they may be 
forced to take responsibility for failing real estate ventures -- office 
buildings, apartment complexes, hotels and strip shopping centers -- all around 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are viewing the end of an era," Samuel Zell, chairman of the board 
of Equity Financial &amp; Management Co., a real estate syndication firm, told 
a glum crowd of limited partnership industry executives. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all directly related to the fact that the real estate industry has played 
much too great a role in the economics of the country in the last 20 years," 
said Zell, who compared the situation to the aftermath of the Holland tulip 
craze in the 17th Century and the South Seas bubble in Great Britain in 1720, 
two schemes of long ago that attracted widespread investments but later went 
awry. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate limited partnerships, also known as real estate syndication, first 
soared in popularity in the early 1980s, propelled by inflation-driven 
increases in property values during the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government made investment in real estate even sweeter in 1981 by 
enacting the Economic Recovery Tax Act, which dispensed additional incentives. 
High-income people who invested in real estate could quickly write off expenses 
and losses against income earned from other sources, while a lower capital 
gains tax rate meant that subsequent profits would be taxed at a lower rate. 
Many investors found they could deduct up to $4 for every $1 they invested, and 
some were able to avoid taxation entirely. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, real estate limited partnerships became an incredibly attractive 
investment to millions of American investors. 
</P>
<P>
From 1980 to 1985, the amount of money put into real estate limited 
partnerships increased six-fold, climbing from about $2 billion in 1980 to 
$12.7 billion in 1985, according to the investment advisory firm of Robert A. 
Stanger &amp; Co. Cumulatively, the industry raised about $67.9 billion from 
1979 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But real estate investing became more popular in other circles as well. Newly 
deregulated savings and loan institutions, allowed to venture into commercial 
real estate investments for the first time, launched many projects, as did 
insurance companies and pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
What resulted was a virtual tidal wave of construction nationwide as cash-flush 
developers rushed to build, build, build. 
</P>
<P>
By their own admission, few investment sponsors and developers showed much 
self-restraint during those years, with most of them focusing their efforts on 
raising as much money as possible and building as much as possible without 
regard for whether there was demand for the structures they were building and 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
"If you allow (us) to have as much alcohol as we want, we will get drunk," said 
Roland D. Freeman, executive vice president for acquisitions of the Hall 
Financial Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The underlying overbuilding problem was exacerbated in 1986 when the federal 
government abruptly reversed its tax policies, stripping many real estate 
investors of quick write-offs and the ability to deduct expenses against income 
earned from other sources. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of the tax benefits combined with overbuilding to drive down real 
estate prices. Rents had already plummeted as competition for tenants 
increased, which translated to lower investment returns. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, property owners were unable to attract any tenants and buildings 
remained vacant, so-called see-through buildings. 
</P>
<P>
At this point it is unclear how many real estate partnerships are faltering. 
Thomas Fendrich, managing director for real estate and partnership finance at 
Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Group, said 40% to 60% of the widely sold public 
real estate partnerships he has reviewed are in trouble, with investors 
unlikely to recoup their money. 
</P>
<P>
Private partnerships, which are typically made up of smaller groups of more 
affluent investors, are in even worse shape, according to some industry 
experts, although less information on their performance is publicly available. 
In many cases, private partnerships were more dependent on tax breaks than 
public partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, the tax implications of their investments are beginning 
to haunt investors as well, because write-offs for depreciation enjoyed years 
ago must now be repaid to the federal and state governments. 
</P>
<P>
When the partnership ends, whether through the sale or foreclosure of the 
building or through liquidation of the partnership, the tax write-offs are 
"recaptured," or picked up as a gain. Thus, the limited partners in 
transactions, including those that failed, are required to repay tax deductions 
they took earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people failed to realize they would pay back Uncle Sam some day," said 
Stephen Lawrence, senior tax manager with Touche Ross in Washington. "It was a 
deferral of taxes, it was not an avoidance." 
</P>
<P>
Many investors are so angry by the outcome that they may sue the project 
sponsors or the financial planners who promoted the investments, Lawrence said. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's actually gone into a courtroom, but I guess that will happen as more 
people get hit with these tax liabilities," Lawrence said. 
</P>
<P>
The full scope of the problem has yet to surface because the general partners 
in the projects-generally the people who proposed and have managed the 
properties-have been hanging on and paying partnership expenses out of their 
own pockets, waiting and hoping for real estate markets to improve, according 
to speakers at the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, they are running out of money and are unable to raise additional 
cash from the regular investors, who have now soured on real estate 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
"The minute the dough stops coming in the door, the syndicator can't pay the 
bills," said investment adviser Robert A. Stanger, who has tracked the industry 
for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Investors may soon see an epidemic of general partners abandoning their 
projects and forcing their limited-partner investors to form steering 
committees to manage the properties as best they can, some analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of sad general partners," said Chicago real estate syndicator 
E. James Keledjian, formerly with VMS Realty Corp. "They want out. They are 
managing products in which they will never make a dime." 
</P>
<P>
Such gloominess permeates the syndication industry these days, in marked 
contrast to years where fund-raising reached new record levels each year. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the group that gathered in Philadelphia this month -- 100 of them, 
compared with 175 last year -- looked somber, sober and notably lacking in 
ostentation. Gone, for the most part, were the Rolex watches, the hand-tailored 
monogrammed shirts, the soft Italian leather shoes and the smooth operators who 
sold syndication so well. 
</P>
<P>
"We're moving from a sales and marketing orientation to hands-on management of 
real estate," said Joseph L. Ferst of accounting firm Spicer &amp; Oppenheim. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of marketing, participants at the seminar talked about survival. 
</P>
<P>
A panel of experts on distressed real estate, for example, offered cost-cutting 
strategies that included firing janitorial staff and deferring maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
"The one expendable thing is always the human resource," said Robert H. 
Weitzman, founder and partner of Chicago-based Group One Investments. 
</P>
<P>
Weitzman said that owners of distressed properties could also become more 
efficient in other ways, such as painting only the front of a weather-beaten 
building, which he said could save 60% of the cost of painting the entire 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Limited partnership industry executives also engaged in a certain amount of 
soul-searching as they sought to explain to themselves and others what had 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
Some blamed it on inexperience in an industry that grew much too quickly, and 
that permitted young MBAs to make investment decisions that failed to consider 
whether there was adequate demand for the buildings being constructed. 
</P>
<P>
The "industry became obsessed with mathematical calculations," Zell said. 
</P>
<P>
Others blamed it on themselves and said the industry is now suffering for the 
sins of the past. 
</P>
<P>
"Greed and avarice -- the twin sisters -- are the cause of it," Keledjian said. 
They were ruined by too much of a good thing, another said.

A WHOLE NEW BREED OF CEO RUNS THE BIG BUSINESSES; 
</P>
<P>
MANAGEMENT: LISTENING TO PEOPLE, KNOWING WHAT'S ON THEIR MINDS, AND MAKING THEM 
FEEL RESPECTED AS INDIVIDUALS IS ESSENTIAL, A CEO ADVISES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Autocrats, tyrants and eye-gougers are a vanishing breed on the American 
corporate landscape, according to top executives at several major firms. 
</P>
<P>
The notion that a successful corporate chief must be a modern day Genghis Khan, 
as suggested by former Gannett CEO Al Neuharth in his book, "Confessions of an 
S.O.B.," is simply not accurate, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't work here," says George B. Harvey, chairman, president and chief 
executive officer of Pitney Bowes Inc. "The employees would throw you out." 
</P>
<P>
Successful CEOs recognize that satisfying the needs of company employees can be 
just as important as satisfying the demands of stockholders and customers, 
Harvey says. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to listen to people, know what's on their minds and what they worry 
about," he says. To a greater degree than ever before, corporate employees 
"want to feel respected" as individuals. 
</P>
<P>
The key to productivity at Stamford, Conn.-based Pitney Bowes, a company that 
reported $2.6 billion in revenues last year, is synergy, not adversity. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like 'creative tension,' " says Harvey, referring to a management 
style that pits employees against one another. "People ought to be free and 
willing to express their views. . . . Any manager that doesn't solicit ideas 
from everyone is making a big mistake." 
</P>
<P>
James P. Schadt, president and chief executive officer of Cadbury Schweppes 
Beverages in Stamford, appears to take that philosophy a step further. Because 
his company competes with corporate monsters like Coca-Cola and Pepsi, Schadt 
encourages his managers to think creatively and act quickly. That's the best 
way for a company like Cadbury Schweppes to score hits on its larger opponents 
in the marketplace, he believes. 
</P>
<P>
"The only weapon we have is our people. . . . My job is to make people feel 
secure so they'll be creative and open with their ideas," he says. "In our 
company, no one ever gets punished for being open." 
</P>
<P>
The price of this freedom, however, is a heavier load of personal 
responsibility. "If I ever hear someone say, 'I could have told you that would 
happen,' I will do what I have to do and that person won't be in the company," 
Schadt says. 
</P>
<P>
Like Harvey, he frowns on internal politicking. But that doesn't rule out 
competition between managers. In fact, a degree of intramural competition is 
essential because the company owns several competing brands of soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
What prevents this sort of competition from turning ugly is a clear set of 
corporate values spelled out in a little white manual entitled "The Character 
of the Company." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to fostering a sense of fair play, the manual serves as a good 
recruiting tool for Schadt. The company's size (it recorded $1.1 billion in 
sales last year, contrasted with $8.3 billion for Coca-Cola) prevents Schadt 
from offering prospective executives mega-salaries or huge departmental budgets 
to play with. "They come here because they want to be here, in our culture. 
It's not just another job," Schadt says. 
</P>
<P>
Because today's employees are better educated and more demanding than their 
predecessors, corporate leaders need a whole new set of skills to motivate 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"The key things are communication and concern," says David E. A. Carson, chief 
executive officer of Bridgeport, Conn.-based People's Bank, a $6.3-billion, 
multiservice financial institution. "No organization that intends to be around 
for a while forgets its people." 
</P>
<P>
In an age of rapid-fire mergers and overnight acquisitions, a CEO's reputation 
for honesty and sensitivity can prevent valuable employees from jumping ship 
when most needed. "The worst announcement you can make to employees is that 
nothing is going to change," says Carson, noting that People's Bank has been 
through six mergers in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
Candor is paramount when competing in a rapidly changing marketplace, many 
believe. In a recent article in the Harvard Business Review, John F. Welch Jr., 
chairman and chief executive officer of General Electric, stresses the 
importance of facing reality, rather than denying or hiding it. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had managers at GE who wouldn't change . . . ," he says. "They wanted to 
sit back, to keep things the way they were. And that's just what they did -- 
until they and most of their staffs had to go. That's the lousy part of this 
job." 
</P>
<P>
Welch, whose company reported revenues of $50 billion last year, says that many 
managers are still afraid to let go of the bureaucracy that cushioned them in 
the past. "Real leaders don't need clutter. You can't believe how hard it is 
for people to be simple." 
</P>
<P>
Gone forever are the days when a corporate boss could fly by the seat of his 
pants, relying on personal experience and gut instinct to safely guide his 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Today's CEO is "a professional manager, not a hip-shooter," says William J. 
Alley, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of American Brands in 
Old Greenwich, Conn. A former U.S. Air Force captain, Alley now pilots a 
company that had revenues of $12 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
Alley believes that consistency is the prime ingredient in the recipe for 
modern CEOs. "If they're going to be a tyrant or a nice guy, they've got to be 
consistent one way or the other," Alley says, offering two successful generals, 
George C. Marshall and George S. Patton, as examples. "Marshall was a nice guy 
all the time; Patton was a tyrant all the time." 
</P>
<P>
The ability to play the role of a leader is also indispensable. "You can't ask 
someone to do something you would not do yourself. It's very difficult to set a 
standard you don't maintain yourself. . . . If I want people to be on time, I'd 
better be on time." 
</P>
<P>
Setting appropriate standards of behavior and performance are part of the 
challenge of modern management, most executives agree.

Ron Lee (Chuckie) Mullins, a University of Mississippi free safety, suffered a 
paralyzing neck injury Saturday when he made a first-quarter tackle in the 
Rebels' game against Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
Mullins, a 6-foot, 170-pound redshirt freshman from Russellville, Ala., was 
airlifted 75 miles to Baptist Central Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. A spokesman in 
the hospital's critical care unit said no condition was immediately available.

Mullins suffered a fractured-dislocation of the fourth and fifth cervical 
vertebrae in the neck, said Leroy Mullins, Mississippi's trainer. 
</P>
<P>
Mullins, was carried from the field on a stretcher with 6:57 left in the first 
quarter of the Rebels' 24-16 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Mullins was injured when he made a jarring tackle on Vanderbilt's Brad Gaines 
at the Ole Miss three-yard-line to break up a pass play. 
</P>
<P>
"He immediately told us he could not feel anything," Leroy Mullins said. 
</P>
<P>
The trainers cut off a portion of Mullins' face mask and hinged it back in case 
they needed to assist his breathing, said school spokesman Langston Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
"Shallow breathing was evident," said Leroy Mullins, who is not related to the 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
"Chuckie (Mullins' nickname) is paralyzed from the neck down. I've been an 
athletic trainer for more than 25 years, and this is the worst on-the-field 
injury I have been involved with. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the type situation you constantly worry about and hope you never face." 
</P>
<P>
Rogers said Mullins never lost consciousness and talked to the trainers the 
entire time they worked with him.
