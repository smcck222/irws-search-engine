UGO TOGNAZZI; KING OF ITALIAN MOVIE COMEDIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ugo Tognazzi, the barrel-chested onetime bookkeeper who portrayed a series of 
comic film characters baffled by life's cruel jests, has died of a cerebral 
hemorrhage. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian news agency ANSA reported Sunday that the actor died late Saturday 
night in a Rome clinic where he was undergoing treatment after a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Hailed by audiences around the world as the king of Italian comedy, Tognazzi 
became a fixture in the international film community in 1979 when he appeared 
as Renato, the proprietor of the bizarre club "La Cage aux Folles," or The Cage 
of Crazy Ladies. 
</P>
<P>
It was all of that and more. 
</P>
<P>
Tognazzi portrayed the employer and 20-year lover of the club's star performer, 
the female impersonator Zaza (Michel Serrault), in the adaptation of the stage 
farce. 
</P>
<P>
In the picture, Tognazzi's straight son has just gotten engaged and informed 
his father that he is about to bring to dinner his fiancee's parents, two 
bastions of conservatism. 
</P>
<P>
Chaos follows. 
</P>
<P>
Although the picture, and two sequels, established Tognazzi as a star outside 
Italy, he had been appearing in movies for two decades after abandoning a 
career as a bookkeeper and accountant. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the illness of his father, Tognazzi had been forced to go to work at 
age 15, keeping records in a salami factory. But he found time to act on the 
amateur stage. 
</P>
<P>
In 1950, he made his first movie, "I Caddetti of Guascogna" (The Cadets of 
Guascogna). He followed that with a series of films in the 1950s that made him 
a popular character actor. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, Tognazzi matured as an actor with a series of creative roles in 
satirical films such as Luciano Salce's "Il Federale" (The Fascist), which is 
still considered one of Tognazzi's greatest. 
</P>
<P>
After his success in "Il Federale" and Dino Risi's "La Marcia Su Roma" (The 
March on Rome), Tognazzi met Marco Ferreri, the director who gave him some of 
his greatest roles. 
</P>
<P>
With Ferreri, Tognazzi made films such as "Una Storia Moderna: l'Ape Regina" 
(The Conjugal Bed) in 1963; "La Donna Scimmia" (The Ape Woman) in 1964; "Marcia 
Nuziale" (Wedding March) in 1966; "L'Udienza" (The Audience) in 1971, and "La 
Grande Bouffe" (The Grand Comedy) in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
He also starred in Roger Vadim's film futuristic comedy "Barbarella," starring 
Vadim's then wife, Jane Fonda. 
</P>
<P>
In many of his pictures he was a husband who married well but whose seeming 
good fortune turns to sardonic horror. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s and early 1980s, Tognazzi tackled more dramatic roles. In 1981, he 
won the Cannes Film Festival Palme d'Or award as best actor for his role in 
Bernardo Bertolucci's "La Tragedia di un Uomo Ridicolo" (The Tragedy of a 
Ridiculous Man). 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, he sparked a controversy in Italian government circles when he 
improvised lines about corruption in high places during a stage version of 
Moliere's classic "The Miser." 
</P>
<P>
Tognazzi is survived by his wife, Franca Bettoia, and four children.

NOBUTAKA SHIKANAI; BUILT JAPAN'S LARGEST MEDIA COMPANY

<P>
Nobutaka Shikanai, who built the Fujisankei Communications Group into Japan's 
largest media company, died Sunday at age 78, the company announced from its 
London office. 
</P>
<P>
He was instrumental in establishing the Praemium Imperiale awards, and his 
company reportedly paid $2 million to Ronald Reagan to visit Japan, where the 
former President attended the first awards ceremony -- a fund-raiser for the 
Reagan Presidential Library -- one year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Shikanai died at Keio University Hospital in Tokyo. Cause of death was not 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Shikanai, born in Hokkaido, was a 1936 graduate of Tokyo's Waseda University. 
</P>
<P>
In 1954, with the creation of the Nippon Broadcasting System, Shikanai began 
building the Fujisankei Communications Group, which describes itself as the 
world's fourth-largest media conglomerate. Its holdings include the Fuji 
Television Network Inc., the newspaper Sankei Shimbun, the Nippon (radio) 
Broadcasting System and record and video companies. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, he transferred the chairmanship of the group to his son and took the 
title of senior executive adviser. 
</P>
<P>
He founded the Hakone Open-Air Museum in 1969 and the Utsukushi-ga-hara 
Open-Air Museum in 1981.

CIGAR SMOKERS

<TEXT>
<P>
My husband and I have had season tickets to the USC home games for about 25 
years and were in attendance at the USC-Arizona game Oct. 20 in the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
During half-time we were astounded to see two very pleasant, well-behaved men 
who sit near us being handled roughly, grasped by their shirt collars and 
hustled out of Tunnel 19 by four policemen, two to each man. We didn't know 
what their offense was, but later learned they were indeed guilty -- of smoking 
cigars! 
</P>
<P>
When murder, rape and robbery abound in the area, four policemen are busy 
stamping out cigar smoking! Has the world gone mad or is it only in Los 
Angeles?

CHEAP WATER FOR FARMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article is right on target. We discover that agriculture uses 83% of the 
state's water, while representing only 3% of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Also that four crops -- alfalfa, rice, cotton and irrigated pasture -- use 
almost a third of our water, yet represent less than 1% of our economy. And 
that if farms could conserve only one-tenth of the water they use, we'd have 
enough for all urban use for the next 20 years. My suggestion: Let agribusiness 
switch to some less wasteful crops, just as homeowners are asked to switch from 
grass lawns to water-saving plants.

Your endorsement of Republican Bannister is an endorsement for more Sacramento 
gridlock. Whoever is elected must go to the Legislature for laws that will put 
his policies into effect. 
</P>
<P>
The October issue of the California Journal lists 16 of the 20 Senate and 42 
Assembly seats as "safe Democratic" in the November election. If the GOP wins 
all the other seats (unlikely), the state Legislature will still be controlled 
by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Some of your past editorials have deplored the effects of the Deukmejian-Honig 
feud on California education. Why promote another? 
</P>
<P>
The only sensible vote in 1990 is to vote a straight Democratic ticket. That 
way if the Democrats don't produce before 1994, "Throw the rascals out" will be 
a real option for California voters. If every incumbent was turned out this 
election, the gridlock mix would still be in place, only the party affiliations 
would be changed.

Your editorial makes a good case for voting for Bannister. But another issue 
comes through loud and clear. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi has been in Sacramento for 16 years. He has run for governor and 
state controller. And he's going to continue to try for various public offices 
until he gets into one in which he is incompetent. (The Peter Principle at 
work.) He's part of the problem, not the solution. He's got the political and 
fund-raising connections to trample an unknown like Bannister no matter how 
well-qualified for office the latter individual may be. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi is an example of why we need term limitations. Holding public office 
should not be a lifetime career.

FEINSTEIN: WORKING PEOPLE'S REAL ALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN T. NUTTER, Int'l Ladies Garment Workers Union 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Growing up in all-white Westchester in postwar Los Angeles, I thought that 
people who worked hard could make a good life for themselves and a better life 
for their kids. Now I know that this dream never came true for lots of people, 
especially minorities, women and low-income whites, no matter how hard they 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
Today, white and minority Californians alike need a wake-up call to vote their 
self-interest, because the dream is vanishing for just about everybody. 
</P>
<P>
Real income for working Californians has eroded steadily since 1980. Families 
must send two wage-earners into the daily fray to survive. Forced overtime and 
long commutes on crowded freeways have made a mockery of the eight-hour 
workday. Millions of Californians go without basic health care. Increasingly, 
employers are hiring temporary workers to avoid paying benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Who can working Californians turn to in such times? The Republican Party will 
do what it has always done in this century: protect the wealthy and their class 
privileges. Democrats, while sometimes needing a boot to get started, are the 
only party that fights for fairness in our economy. 
</P>
<P>
Dianne Feinstein and the Democrats, not Pete Wilson and the Republicans, 
believe that the state minimum wage should be periodically adjusted for 
inflation. And they will defend the eight-hour workday against the drive by 
corporate Republican interests to pass a 12-hour overtime law. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein and the Democrats, not Wilson and the Republicans, will try to give 
all working Californians access to affordable health care -- and they'll see to 
it that employers who provide health care won't have to subsidize those who 
refuse to do so. 
</P>
<P>
My union was formed in 1900 to clean up the garment sweatshops and to win 
decent pay and the eight-hour day. Today we must continue this fight against a 
powerful retrograde movement led by the Republican Party. That is why we 
support Dianne Feinstein and oppose Pete Wilson.

WILSON: RISK-TAKING, EXPERIENCED LEADER

<P>
California, the Golden State, the land of opportunity. A dynamic state with a 
worldwide reputation for excellence, innovation and economic might. A state 
whose future will be strongly influenced by the new governor we will elect next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
As a local elected official, I appreciate the depth of experience and breadth 
of knowledge that it will take to guide the state through the issues of today 
with a vision of tomorrow. I also know that Pete Wilson is a proven visionary 
leader, clearly the kind of leader California needs and deserves. A 
well-rounded person whose life in public service has been marked by a high 
level of sensitivity to the needs of the people. A man with a record of success 
that began as mayor of San Diego, where he delivered solutions and left the 
rhetoric at home. 
</P>
<P>
Leadership requires taking risks and a spirit of frontierism like the kind that 
resulted in the development of the San Diego Trolley, which delivered a local 
solution -- on time and under budget -- to a problem that now plagues cities 
statewide. I want to elect a governor willing to take the strides of courageous 
leadership. Pete Wilson would be that kind of governor. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when countless children in our state sleep on the floor to hide from 
the bullets flying through the streets outside, we must have a governor whose 
record reflects a priority of community safety. As a former police officer, I 
value a governor who knows how to fight crime and who has the safety of the 
citizens as his top priority. As a citizen and a parent, I consider the safety 
of my family and the protection of my property to be of the utmost importance. 
</P>
<P>
As both a state legislator and a U.S. senator, Pete Wilson has relentlessly 
pursued legislation that would protect the lives and property of Californians 
and impose the death penalty on drug kingpins. It's going to take that kind of 
determination to rein in the criminal elements that have made our streets 
unsafe and turned some neighborhoods into war zones. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 7 when the results are in, I'd like to think that California will be 
poised to meet the challenges ahead. But it will take a governor who leads with 
a compass and not a weather vane. It will take a leader who is not afraid to 
take the risks of leadership. It will take a person with depth of experience 
and a record of success. Pete Wilson is that leader.

The story of the 1990 governor's race is a tale of two cities, and of two very 
different visions of California's future. 
</P>
<P>
As mayor of San Diego, Pete Wilson spent 11 years building a city with a 
quality of life that is even today the envy of people throughout America. San 
Diego is the quintessential California dream, combining scenic beauty with a 
healthy economy, good schools, safe roads, affordable housing and clean water. 
</P>
<P>
Dianne Feinstein, twice defeated badly for San Francisco mayor, inherited the 
job after the murder of then-Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk. 
She retained most of Moscone's staff and let San Francisco political boss 
Willie Brown take over her election campaign a year later. The next year, Brown 
again mobilized his forces to help her escape a recall challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by Assembly Speaker Brown's machine, Feinstein ran San Francisco for 
nine years, collapsing a $152-million surplus that developed early in her 
tenure into a $172-million budget shortfall, the largest in the city's history. 
San Francisco's urban problems, from drugs to AIDS to street crime to taxes, 
may be no different from New York's or Chicago's; and San Francisco will always 
retain its tourist charm. But most Californians would rather raise their 
families in a place like San Diego. To them, Pete Wilson's shining city by the 
bay looks much different and much better. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Wilson's vision for San Diego is now his vision for California. To realize 
that vision, however, Wilson will have to bring radical change to a State 
Assembly dominated by Willie Brown, who has now spent more than a quarter of a 
century in office. Whether on taxes and spending, merit pay for teachers, 
educational choice, fighting drugs and crime, hiring quotas or campaign reform, 
Willie Brown will be Pete Wilson's enemy -- just as he was George Deukmejian's. 
</P>
<P>
But Brown, who made and kept Feinstein as mayor of San Francisco, is very much 
her friend. It's no accident that Feinstein, the alleged candidate of "change," 
opposes the Wilson-endorsed term-limitation initiative on the November ballot. 
So Brown, set for yet another decade as Speaker (and perhaps, if Feinstein 
wins, as vice-governor), has raised millions of dollars to defeat term limits. 
</P>
<P>
As mayor, Pete Wilson saw first-hand how local law enforcement had been 
hamstrung by liberal-left judges who gutted California's criminal law. Later, 
he joined forces with Californians who worked hard to get rid of Chief Justice 
Rose Bird and two other Jerry Brown-appointed justices who favored criminal 
defendants and civil plaintiffs. But Dianne Feinstein isn't likely to be a 
force for that kind of change; despite her tough talk, she would likely bring 
back more of the same liberal, activist judges. 
</P>
<P>
That scenario is less vision than nightmare for millions of Californians. With 
good reason, they're looking forward to ending the holidays for criminals, the 
last-minute budget fiascos, the red ink, the bloated government spending, and 
the hyper-regulation that has come from too many desensitized politicians too 
long in office. That is why their term-limitation initiative will win, and that 
is why Pete Wilson will be California's next governor.

PETE? OR DIANNE?;

<P>
A RANGE OF VOICES ARGUES THAT CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE A CHOICE; 
</P>
<P>
FEINSTEIN: GUIDE FOR A CRITICAL DECADE

In an election where many people initially complained that, other than gender, 
there was no real distinction between the two candidates for governor, clear 
differences have become apparent in several areas, including abortion rights 
and AIDS. Dianne Feinstein is committed to the rights of all women, including 
the poor and the young, to reproductive choice, and to adequate funding for the 
treatment and search for a cure for AIDS. Pete Wilson isn't. 
</P>
<P>
But even without the distinctions that have emerged, there has always been one 
truly compelling reason to vote for Feinstein: It's 1990, a reapportionment 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The state's legislative districts are being redrawn to reflect the census. 
Whoever is elected governor will have to approve or veto the redistricting, 
thus affecting the state's, and to a great extent the country's, course in the 
decade ahead. Remember, California's congressional delegation is expected to 
increase by at least 15%. Whether the expanded delegation is primarily 
Democratic or Republican will depend to a large extent on the next governor. 
</P>
<P>
I want to keep Don Edwards, the leader of the pro-choice forces in Congress, 
there. It's unthinkable that Henry Waxman, who has led the battle for us in 
health care (for AIDS treatment and research funds, diabetes research and 
public health money,) should have his district redrawn in such a way as to 
jeopardize his seat. George Brown, long a champion of liberal causes, is 
certain to be one of the casualties. It's frightening to think that we could 
lose Tony Beilenson, Howard Berman, Mel Levine, Julian Dixon -- just to mention 
valuable representatives from Los Angeles alone. I don't want them put in 
jeopardy because a Republican governor has vetoed the Legislature's plan, or 
succeeded in bringing it before a California Supreme Court composed largely of 
Republican appointees. 
</P>
<P>
We also must have a Democratic Legislature to help ensure that access to safe 
and legal abortions for all of California's women, rich and poor alike, 
continues as a matter of right. 
</P>
<P>
The only way to make the California of 2000 better than the California of today 
is to make certain that a Democratic governor is elected in 1990. I'll sleep 
better election night if I know that Dianne Feinstein will be the next 
governor.

'BILLBOARD POLICE' HELP ADVERTISERS GET MONEY'S WORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trying to attract more listeners during the summer, radio station KTWV-FM, "the 
Wave," plastered many thousands of dollars worth of billboards all over town. 
</P>
<P>
The outdoor ads, which said "Because life's too short for ordinary music," were 
purchased from several big billboard companies for as much as $5,000 a month 
each. 
</P>
<P>
With those kinds of price tags, KTWV executives decided not to just take the 
word of the outdoor ad firms that all the boards would magically appear on the 
prescribed dates. Instead, the station hired a company that specializes in 
monitoring billboards. What they discovered was appalling. More than 20% of the 
billboards that the station purchased were not up on time or were in some way 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that the billboard companies are trying to rip anyone off," said 
Bonny Benedict, director of creative services at KTWV. "It's just that there 
are so many billboards in Los Angeles. It's a huge animal to control." 
</P>
<P>
So KTWV, like some others, turned to a relatively small Paramount company, ACI 
Outdoor Audit, which has made a business out of doing the dirty work for 
outdoor advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
During the night, ACI sends crews out in trucks to make certain that every 
billboard, bus banner or transit shelter ad a client pays for is up -- and in 
good condition. Call them billboard police, if you will. Some billboards are 
damaged by vandals or weather. Some have lights that fail to go on. And worst 
of all, some ads aren't even up. 
</P>
<P>
Clients are charged 1% to 2% of their outdoor ad budgets. Generally speaking, 
the company charges $5 each to check smaller billboards and bus signs, and $25 
each to monitor giant painted billboards. That can add up fast, considering 
that many of its clients have from 100 to 500 billboards to monitor. 
</P>
<P>
It is no irony that ACI chose the Los Angeles market. With so many commuters, 
the Southland is the largest outdoor advertising market in the country, with an 
estimated 40,000 billboard, transit shelter and side-of-bus ads. As a result, 
advertising executives say, nowhere is the problem of billboard discrepancies 
more acute than it is here. Radio station KTWV, for example, was given many 
thousands of dollars in future advertising credits as a result of ACI's 
billboard audit. 
</P>
<P>
"Outdoor (advertising) is the only business where advertisers spend millions of 
dollars and never know if they're getting full value," said Ben Somers, who two 
years ago founded ACI's billboard inspection division. Magazine advertisers 
usually get copies of the ads. And radio and TV advertisers are often sent 
signed affidavits that the ads appeared. But generally speaking, there is no 
accurate verification for outdoor advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a billboard advertiser here, you've got to audit," said Jack 
Kornarens, a billboard industry consultant in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
No one is saying that the billboard companies intentionally rip off clients. 
But whatever the reason, said Somers, billboard advertisers often don't get 
everything they pay for. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the big billboard companies take exception to that. Gannett 
Outdoor Advertising, one of the billboard giants, figures that its billboard 
postings in the Los Angeles market are correct about 98% of the time -- and 
nearly 100% in other markets. 
</P>
<P>
"In Los Angeles we generally don't make 100% because of the size of the market, 
the sheer number of ads and all of the last-minute changes by advertisers," 
said Robbynn Lystrup, sales service manager at Gannett. But she said Gannett 
has no objections to these new audit companies. "We're not afraid to find out 
when we've made a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
The other giant billboard firm in Los Angeles, Patrick Media, declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
One of the largest Los Angeles companies that specializes in buying billboard 
space for advertisers insists its clients get what they pay for. "We place 25% 
of the outdoor business in Los Angeles," said Mark Barnes, chief executive of 
the Sherman Oaks-based office of Outdoor Services Inc. "And less than 1% isn't 
up on time." 
</P>
<P>
Executives at the Outdoor Advertising Assn. of America, an industry trade 
group, said it was the first time that the notion of outside billboard 
monitoring had been brought to their attention. "It's certainly the right of 
any client to have any oversight they want," said Kippy Burns, a spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, many commuters in Southern California might feel that the fewer 
billboards around the better. So what if some billboards or bus shelter ads get 
blitzed? 
</P>
<P>
Well, advertisers certainly don't feel that way. Recently, KNX radio was 
informed of nearly $27,000 in outdoor advertising discrepancies after a 
billboard audit by ACI. "I'm a big believer in outdoor advertising," said Fred 
Bergendorff, director of advertising and promotions at KNX. "But I wouldn't do 
it without some type of auditing."

Shareholder Sues CalFed: A shareholder sued four former and current officers of 
the parent company of California Federal Savings &amp; Loan on behalf of 
himself and others who bought stock between Jan. 1, 1987, and Oct. 19, 1990, 
alleging that it inflated its securities to boost stock market prices. 
</P>
<P>
The federal court class-action suit filed on behalf of Arnold Cohen alleges 
that CalFed Inc. misrepresented its financial condition in annual reports filed 
between 1986 and 1989. CalFed reported a third-quarter net loss Oct. 19 of 
$92.3 million. (Case No. 90-5753. Filed Oct. 24, 1990.)

Regulators Seize Rancho Bernardo Savings Bank: The Office of Thrift Supervision 
placed long-struggling Rancho Bernardo Savings Bank in receivership and created 
a new federally chartered S&amp;L that will assume many of the failed 
institution's assets and liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
The regulatory action dashed a planned recapitalization by Orange County thrift 
consultant Jim Gough. The savings bank had $119 million in assets and about 
5,000 depositors. Most of its $4.8 million in losses the past two years were 
linked to a troubled real estate development in Escondido.

A NEW ERA IN AIRPLANE PHONE SERVICE FORECAST; 
</P>

COMMUNICATIONS: IN TWO YEARS THERE ARE LIKELY TO BE PLANE-TO-PLANE HOOKUPS,

The next two years will bring important breakthroughs in telephone 
communication with airplanes, telecommunications companies say. 
</P>
<P>
Not only will passengers be able to place phone calls -- as they can now -- 
they'll be able to receive them, along with facsimile messages and data from 
portable computers. Some are describing it as "the office in the sky." 
</P>
<P>
Kirkland, Wash.-based McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. and Germantown, 
Md.-based Hughes Network Systems are two of the companies that hope to cash in. 
They have formed a limited partnership to build and operate a nationwide phone 
and data system for commercial aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The service, called Clairtel, will use 80 ground stations around the United 
States to provide radio links with aircraft, McCaw spokesman Bob Ratliffe said. 
</P>
<P>
The venture will be a competitor of the leader in the field, GTE Airfone, a 
subsidiary of Stamford, Conn.-based GTE. Airphone is the largest operator of 
airborne pay phones, with 1,300 installed on planes owned by 17 U.S. and 
Canadian airlines. It was the first to enter the market, on Oct. 15, 1984, 
under an experimental license from the Federal Communications Commission, 
spokesman Kevin Petschow said. 
</P>
<P>
The FCC is expected in the coming months to issue licenses to a number of 
companies -- Clairtel and GTE Airphone included -- that want to offer airplane 
phone service on a permanent, nonexperimental basis. The deadline for the 
license applications was last week. 
</P>
<P>
Each plane equipped with an Airfone system has a radio transmitter-receiver and 
computer. The computer selects one of 90 GTE ground stations in North America 
and Hawaii to establish a radio link. Outside the United States, the phones 
work off Comsat's satellite service. 
</P>
<P>
It's not cheap. Calls in the United States or Canada are $2 a minute, plus a $2 
setup charge. 
</P>
<P>
So far, they can be placed only from the aircraft to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Petschow said Airfone will have a second-generation system in operation by 
1992, however. That will allow calls from the ground to the aircraft, from one 
plane to another, and personal computer hookups, fax transmissions and message 
services. Information hot lines, stock information services and other features 
may be added, Petschow said. 
</P>
<P>
Ratliffe said Clairtel at first will install a system similar to Airfone's, but 
eventually wants one that is part of McCaw's cellular system. McCaw operates 
one of the nation's largest cellular networks. It is in 100 markets across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
The ultra-high-frequency radio bands for cellular phones are near those 
assigned to aircraft phones, so it may be possible to have a cellular phone 
that can receive both, Ratliffe said. 
</P>
<P>
McCaw is working with other cellular companies to develop a North American 
network. With a nationwide switching system, it should be possible to dial a 
cellular phone number in Seattle, for instance, but find that phone wherever it 
is in the nation, Ratliffe said. That includes on an aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Clairtel also envisions computer data transmissions, pager messages, faxes and 
other advanced services. 
</P>
<P>
Ratliffe said there's the potential to deliver video entertainment to 
passengers' seats and for phone-toting passengers to dial up drinks or food 
from the aircraft galley.

SOME OF CONGRESS'S S&amp;L LETTERS MISSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Dozens of letters are missing from the special file of correspondence from 
members of Congress to savings and loan regulators, according to the Office of 
Thrift Supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the letters were written by lawmakers on behalf of constituents who 
complained about problems in their dealings with S&amp;Ls, such as accounts 
that were transferred from one thrift to another as the result of mergers. 
</P>
<P>
But some letters provide evidence of members of Congress pressing regulators on 
behalf of S&amp;L operators, some of whom contributed to the lawmakers' 
political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
There are thousands of letters, all maintained by the OTS and filed 
alphabetically under the names of the senators and representatives who sent 
them. The Office of Thrift Supervision, the federal agency created by last 
year's S&amp;L bailout legislation, keeps the letters for its own use and opens 
them to members of the public by appointment. 
</P>
<P>
There is no supervision of people perusing the letters, which are kept in an 
area of OTS's Washington headquarters that is out of view of agency employees. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Cohen, OTS's director of congressional correspondence, said she is aware 
of at least one entire file that is missing. Each file contains dozens of 
letters written by a member of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen declined to say which file is missing or who may be suspected of taking 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The agency has only one copy of each letter in the centralized archives, 
although individual regulators may have kept their own copies, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I know something's missing, and it really bothers me," she said. "I think it's 
real important to the agency" to make the files secure, she added, saying that 
she has complained about the situation to high-level OTS officials. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a problem; we're trying to address the problem," said Robert 
Schmermund, OTS's director of public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Allegations that some lawmakers interceded on behalf of beleaguered savings and 
loans, and that some of the same S&amp;Ls made contributions to lawmakers, have 
become a hot issue in this election year. The escalating S&amp;L crisis has 
made the letter file a sought-after source of information. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters have been the most frequent users of the files, but in recent months 
congressional aides, political consultants and law firms also have looked at 
them, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an election year; everyone wants to see their own file," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Those wishing to examine the files are asked to make an appointment and bring 
with them a letter to OTS making a Freedom of Information Act request for 
access to papers of specific members of Congress. When they arrive, they are 
left alone with the files in an area separated by partitions from OTS 
employees. Users are allowed to photocopy the letters. 
</P>
<P>
There is no inspection of bags and cases of people leaving the OTS office. 
</P>
<P>
Schmermund said the agency is concerned about the vulnerability of the current 
system but wants to continue giving the public access. OTS Director Timothy 
Ryan wants the agency to be "as open as possible," Schmermund said. 
</P>
<P>
To obtain other OTS documents, outsiders must use them in the agency's 
supervised reading room or submit formal Freedom of Information requests that 
can take weeks to be answered.

Volunteers of America Sues State: Volunteers of America of Los Angeles Inc. 
sued the state for breach of contract, alleging that it botched a planned work 
furlough center by failing to award the contract in time. The Los Angeles 
Superior Court lawsuit alleges that the charitable organization leased a 
Chinatown building at $3,600 a month and renovated it at the urging of the 
Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the DOC was to deliver the operating contract within two 
months of Volunteers' pricing proposal. But the DOC did not meet the deadline, 
and in the meantime, the city rezoned the property so that it could not be used 
for a work furlough program, the suit said. It seeks unspecified general 
damages. (Case No. BC013391. Filed Oct. 23, 1990)

Nansay International Inc. of Tokyo and ITT Sheraton Corp. are launching a 
$1-billion venture to buy and operate hotels in the United States, the Pacific 
and in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Sheraton will manage three hotels that Nansay is developing at the Kohanaiki 
resort on the island of Hawaii, Sheraton Chairman John Kapioltas said in 
Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
Work is also under way on hotels in Los Angeles, Guam and Saipan. 
</P>
<P>
Under the arrangement, Nansay will be responsible for financing and project 
development, while Sheraton will manage the hotels and determine opportunities 
for additional projects. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the companies plan a second joint venture in which each will put up 
capital to buy hotels and ownership will be shared equally, Kapioltas said. He 
said the hotel industry on the mainland is depressed, and in many cases 
investors are willing to sell, giving Sheraton opportunities to expand.

PLAYING ON HAL SEESAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tale of HAL Inc., the beleaguered holding company for Hawaiian Airlines, is 
a good lesson for anyone who wants to play thinly traded, rumor-buffeted 
stocks: You're probably better off with the horses at Santa Anita, but if you 
really love excitement and have money to blow, trading a stock like HAL is a 
perfect diversion. 
</P>
<P>
If you would have regularly bought and sold HAL stock during the past decade at 
just the right times, you could have made 50% to 100% almost yearly. There 
aren't too many stocks that equaled HAL for that kind of potential. The flip 
side is that you could have gotten murdered in HAL just as easily. Many traders 
did. 
</P>
<P>
The latest wave of players to be burned in the stock were those who purchased 
their shares early this year, following former Olympic organizer Peter 
Ueberroth and his partner, J. Thomas Talbot, into the stock. The two men led a 
group that purchased 77% of HAL's shares for $22 apiece last December. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaiian, which flies inter-island, to Samoa and to the West Coast, has had 
organizational troubles for years, badly needs new planes and is bleeding 
mightily trying to compete with stronger carriers. In the past nine years, the 
airline has been profitable only in two full years. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, incredibly, the stock continued to trade mostly above $25 a share from 
1987 through 1989 -- and frequently spiked much higher -- on expectations that 
the airline might be sold to another carrier or that it might finally get its 
act together. In many ways, the stock was a small trader's dream: Most 
institutional investors couldn't (and can't) play this issue, because on any 
given day only a few thousand shares might trade. But a small trader dealing in 
100-share lots could enter and exit relatively easily. 
</P>
<P>
After Ueberroth and Talbot took control late last year, the other shareholders 
who remained in HAL thought enough of the two men to keep the stock at about 
$20 for most of the first half of this year, even as red ink continued. HAL 
lost $43.4 million ($19.89 a share) in the first half, on revenue of $161 
million. 
</P>
<P>
But by August, investors' patience wore thin as the broad market sank, oil 
prices leaped and HAL showed no signs of a turnaround. The stock fell to $13 by 
mid-August, then plunged to $5 by Oct. 3. The small trader's dream once again 
became a nightmare -- and Ueberroth's investment had lost 77% of its value. 
</P>
<P>
Then, just as suddenly, the stock rocketed to $12 by Oct. 19, an easy 140% for 
anyone who bought at the $5 low. What was behind the jump? Talbot, HAL's chief 
executive, speculated that investors were reacting to HAL's award on Oct. 15 of 
a new route between Honolulu and Fukuoka in Japan. That route could be 
lucrative because the Japanese consider Hawaii a premium vacation spot. 
</P>
<P>
But at this point, HAL will have to divert planes from other routes to serve 
Fukuoka, because it doesn't have the money to buy new planes. What's more, 
Talbot said he remains unsure how quickly the airline might return to 
profitability, admitting that he had been overly optimistic with projections 
early this year. 
</P>
<P>
Some traders had another explanation for the leap in HAL's stock: Rumors 
surfaced that friends of Ueberroth and Talbot might be buying HAL shares and 
placing them in non-loanable accounts, to confound the short-sellers -- traders 
who have been borrowing and selling HAL stock since June, betting that it would 
drop. Some traders contended that a classic short "squeeze" was occurring, as 
HAL stock rose and the shorts tried desperately to find stock to buy to cover 
their positions. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard a rumor that some guys out of Chicago were buying it," said Randy 
Havre, head of J. B. Havre Securities in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Talbot "categorically and specifically" denied that anyone was asked 
to buy the stock. He noted that only a couple of hundred thousand of HAL's 2.1 
million shares are available for trading, since his and Ueberroth's group have 
the rest. So it isn't unusual for the stock to move quickly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
By last Friday, the stock had fallen back to $8. And on Friday, Security 
Pacific Bank disclosed that it has now essentially become HAL's largest holder. 
By virtue of the huge credit line it has extended to HAL ($137 million) since 
last year, Security has taken warrants convertible into 42.3% of HAL's stock. 
The deal also cuts the stake controlled by Ueberroth and Talbot to about 35%. 
</P>
<P>
The Security news doesn't change much. The questions that have made HAL a 
speculator's favorite for years remain: Can management make it profitable? Will 
another airline ultimately buy it? Or is this just a long-delayed bankrupt 
waiting to happen? 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, HAL's crazy trading history may be a good illustration of what 
investors can expect from other small stocks in the year ahead. As the bear 
market goes through its paces, speculators will grow more dominant in the 
market, and wild mood swings will be the exception rather than the rule. HAL 
has never really been an investor's stock, but rather a short-term trader's. If 
that's your game, you'll probably have many more opportunities to try your hand 
in the months to come. 
</P>

DEALS: MARKET WATCH; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN IT COMES TO AIRLINE BUYOUTS, NEITHER BORROWER NOR LENDER BE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Talk about good luck. A year ago, people at United Airlines were getting ready 
to slash their wrists because the $6.8-billion leveraged buyout of the company 
had fallen apart. Today, they ought to be sending thank-you notes to the 
Japanese bankers whose last-minute reluctance to lend blew the deal out of the 
sky. 
</P>
<P>
Because, you see, if the $300-a-share LBO had gone through, United would now be 
choking on a combination of high interest payments and Saddam Hussein-inspired 
fuel bills, the way that debt-ridden airlines such as Continental, Pan Am, 
USAir, Eastern, Northwest, TWA, Midway, Hawaiian Airlines and America West are 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, United, like the country's two other major, relatively debt-free 
airlines -- American and Delta -- can stand the strain of higher fuel bills 
because its balance sheet is relatively debt-free. In fact, United has just 
ordered new airplanes and is in a dogfight with American for the right to buy 
choice European routes from debt-ridden Pan Am, which is once again selling 
prime assets in an attempt to keep itself afloat. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that United was lucky rather than smart is beside the point. If you 
compare the United that is to the United that would have been, you begin to see 
why, from the dawn of airline companies until junk bonds came briefly to rule 
the earth, loan officers were taught to be very careful about lending money to 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, when you think about it, is obvious. Airlines can be very 
lucrative, but they're also very risky. There are expensive planes to buy, 
unpredictable fuel costs to meet, fickle customers to lure. As Chairman Herbert 
Kelleher of Southwest Airlines said in an issue of Forbes magazine earlier this 
year, "You (can) go from spilling cash to bleeding red ink like the Mississippi 
River going through the Delta." 
</P>
<P>
Risks such as those are known as "operating leverage." Any time a company with 
operating leverage borrows a lot of money, it's piling financial leverage onto 
operating leverage. This doesn't merely add risk to risk; it multiplies them. 
It's the financial equivalent of mixing drinking and driving. 
</P>
<P>
But because shrewd and lucky financial operators such as Frank Lorenzo of Texas 
Air Corp. (now Continental Airlines Holdings) seemed to be the wave of the 
future, the old rule about not combining operating risk with financial risk 
went out the window. 
</P>
<P>
Any airline that wasn't loaded with debt was accused of not having done the 
right thing by its shareholders. Analysts snickered at Delta for not being 
daring enough. Marvin Davis, the California billionaire, raided United. Donald 
J. Trump, then a real estate mogul, now a deadbeat, was threatening to raid 
American. 
</P>
<P>
Who's laughing now? Northwest Airlines, which went private in a leveraged 
buyout that Chairman Alfred A. Checchi boasts is two years ahead of schedule in 
repaying its debt, is talking about "major layoffs." Hawaiian, another LBO, is 
on the brink of financial failure. TWA, hocked to the eyeballs by Carl C. Icahn 
to buy out its shareholders and make huge payments to him, is choking. Braniff 
has gone broke for the second time. USAir, which borrowed heavily to buy other 
companies, is being squeezed, as are Midway and America West. 
</P>
<P>
"We have proven that airlines are not candidates for LBOs," Pan Am Chairman 
Thomas G. Plaskett told a group of travel agents earlier this month. "They 
generate enough operating and financial leverage on their own, let alone adding 
to the leverage to provide payouts to shareholders." Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's our old friend Continental Airlines Holdings, formerly Texas Air. 
The news leaked last week that Continental had considered going Chapter 11 but 
decided not to do so. The disclosure that the company had thought of going 
Chapter 11 may well end up forcing it into Chapter 11 because suppliers will 
probably cut back on credit and travel agents may stop booking Continental 
flights. They remember getting burned in 1983, when Texas Air put Continental 
Airlines into bankruptcy, and again in 1989, when it was Eastern's turn to go 
belly up. 
</P>
<P>
Continental, which had $2.6 billion in debt and long-term leases on its books 
as of June 30 -- not counting Eastern's multibillion-dollar debt -- said it is 
thinking of selling its foreign routes to help buy its way out of trouble. The 
problem is that Continental has pledged its foreign routes to the U.S. Pension 
Benefit Guaranty Corp., the federal agency that insures pensions. The agency 
got Continental to pledge those assets to guarantee payment of the shortfall in 
Eastern's pension plan, a gap that the agency puts at $565 million. Continental 
is still on the hook for Eastern's pension plan, even though a bankruptcy judge 
took control of Eastern away from Continental six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Continental's press relations people, as usual, wouldn't take my call. I didn't 
even bother trying to find Lorenzo, whom I've called for more than 10 years but 
who has never called me back. 
</P>
<P>
But the Chapter 11 prospect makes Lorenzo's departure from Continental this 
August look more than a little suspicious. Lorenzo, you recall, bailed out with 
$27 million, thanks to a deal he cut with Scandinavian Airline Systems to sell 
his Continental stock and stock options for about triple the market price. 
That's continuing the pattern in which Lorenzo cut special deals with the 
company that put millions of dollars in his pocket at the expense of other 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Poor Frank. He said in August that he was leaving Continental to let SAS run it 
unhindered. Yeah, right. At least when the Titanic sank, the captain had enough 
class to go down with the ship. 
</P>
<P>
Oops Department: Last week, in my Boston Celtics column, I wrote that master 
limited partnerships will lose their tax breaks after 1997. I should have said 
"most MLPs," because the post-1997 rule doesn't apply to real estate and 
natural resource MLPs.

STEELERS' DEFENSE GETS CURTAIN CALL; 
</P>
<P>
TONIGHT'S GAME: PITTSBURGH RANKS NO. 1 IN THE NFL AGAINST THE PASS. FOR THE 
RAMS, GARY COULD BECOME THE KEY.

PITTSBURGH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Statistics lie, but worried offensive coordinators seldom do. 
</P>
<P>
Ask Ram offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese about the Pittsburgh Steelers' 
defense his squad will face tonight, and the respect in his voice comes through 
as clear as his point. 
</P>
<P>
Unless you're talking about luck as the residue of design, talent and 
ill-tempered defensive backs, the Steelers have a defense that has fought for 
its No. 1 ranking against the pass. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the best pass defense in the league," Zampese said. "You watch them 
play, and they should be (No. 1). Stats are misleading as hell, but you watch 
them play and I believe it. 
</P>
<P>
"They held (49er quarterback Joe) Montana to 157 yards (last week)." 
</P>
<P>
So when Zampese studies San Francisco's 27-7 victory over Pittsburgh (3-4) last 
week, he knows that the Steeler defense, which intercepted two Montana passes, 
wasn't at fault. The Steeler offense (ranked 27th) has had its problems. But 
not the defense. 
</P>
<P>
The Pittsburgh led by cornerback Rod Woodson, has 11 interceptions -- tied for 
second-most in the league -- and given up an average of only 159.1 yards 
through the air and a total of four passing touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams and quarterback Jim Everett come into tonight's nationally televised 
game with the fourth-rated pass offense in the league, having fattened its 
statistics against an Atlanta Falcon defense that is Swiss cheese against the 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
If playing Atlanta was "fast-break football," as Ram Coach John Robinson called 
it, then Pittsburgh is a stalling four corners. For comparison, the Rams have 
given up 14 touchdown passes and scored 14 touchdowns through the air. The 
Steelers have given up four and scored seven. 
</P>
<P>
So if the Rams (2-4) want to continue their drive toward a wild-card berth, 
they will have to do it with patience, grace and power on offense -- not with 
the big plays that produced 44 points against Atlanta. The longest pass Montana 
threw against Pittsburgh was 19 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not trying to make a big deal out of this, but these guys are good," 
Zampese said of the Steelers. "They are good. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to get points on them, it's hard to get many points on these guys. 
We have to be patient and just sort of hope we can keep moving the ball, and 
then when we do get a chance to score, we've got to get sevens and not threes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how many opportunities we will have to get seven points against 
these guys." 
</P>
<P>
The key is patience. Not forcing things. Avoiding the interception. Long, 
sustained drives. Accept the fact that receivers Flipper Anderson and Henry 
Ellard will not be open for long passes very often. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Cleveland Gary suddenly becomes the Rams' offensive focal point, which 
is something Robinson has been waiting for all year. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a type of team that wants to eliminate the big play," Everett said. 
"They want you to earn that 12-play drive that goes 80 yards and if you earn 
the touchdown, then so be it. They really want you to hunt and peck and 
self-destruct. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a team that forces you to be patient and wait for your opportunity. I 
couldn't think of a team offhand that has their young, good secondary and just 
a solid upfront group." 
</P>
<P>
What the Steelers do is let their talented secondary roam the seams in what 
they call a matchup zone, then collapse quickly to the ball. They apply enough 
to pressure to force quarterbacks into pushing the ball where the Steelers want 
it to go. Then Woodson and Co. take over. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very physical people back there, and they all run well, all of them," 
Zampese said. "You see guys running with the ball, and then they're tackled. 
You don't see tackles missed. They remind me a little of Denver, when Denver 
was outstanding defensively. They don't miss tackles. Somebody always tackles 
the guy." 
</P>
<P>
Said Pittsburgh quarterback Bubby Brister: "In training camp we were having 
problems moving the ball against our defense. And now I know why. They're a 
pretty good defense." 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers didn't score an offensive touchdown in the first four games of the 
season, and the quarterback was complaining long and loud about new offensive 
coordinator Joe Walton's complicated system. 
</P>
<P>
Walton finally simplified things, and Brister is happier and more comfortable 
now. 
</P>
<P>
But the Steelers are still gaining only 246.6 yards a game, second-to-last in 
the league, and the offense still struggles to put points on the board. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, the Steelers have gone to massive rookie tight end Eric Green. 
</P>
<P>
"You try to get the ball to your best people," Steeler Coach Chuck Noll said. 
"I think everybody does that. And for a long stretch here, our best people were 
our wideouts, and we went almost exclusively to our wideouts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm talking about when we had (Lynn) Swann and (John) Stallworth and Frank 
Lewis and that type of thing. We'd get the ball to the people that could make 
the big play. 
</P>
<P>
"And then, we started getting it to the backs a little bit more because we had 
people who could catch it. Now, we've got people at tight end who can catch the 
ball, so it's a natural progression." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh hasn't won on Monday night since 1985, losing five in a row. 
"Hopefully, we can show the nation on Monday night that we've got everything 
squared away," quarterback Bubby Brister said. "Yeah, we're looking forward to 
it. This week we've got a chance to show the people in the world that we do 
have a good team and we're better on offense." 
</P>
<P>
This game will mark Ram offensive tackle Jackie Slater's 200th appearance in an 
NFL game. . . . Quarterback Jim Everett's next touchdown pass will be his 100th 
in the NFL.

DAY AFTER TRAGEDY, THE DEBATE CONTINUES

Another horse broke down during training hours at Belmont Park Sunday morning. 
As thoroughbreds go, it was simply another horse. But Sunday's breakdown was 
another addition to a lengthening list of injured horses here, a list that 
includes Go For Wand, Criminal Type, Gorgeous, Deposit Ticket and Garden Gal, 
all of whom couldn't win a Breeders' Cup race because of mishaps. 
</P>
<P>
All of the injured horses missed the Breeders' Cup except Go For Wand, who is 
dead because she raced. In the aftermath of the death of the nation's top 
3-year-old filly, whose right foreleg snapped less than a sixteenth of mile 
before the finish of Saturday's Breeders' Cup Distaff, respected horsemen are 
asking serious questions. 
</P>
<P>
They are wondering whether the Belmont racing surface contributed to the fatal 
injury, and whether the injuries to about a dozen other horses in recent weeks 
can be written off as coincidental. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Badgett, Go For Wand's trainer, declines to blame Belmont Park. "It was 
just a tough break," the ashen-faced Badgett said at his barn Sunday morning. 
"She just dug down trying to beat that mare (Bayakoa, who went on to win the 
Distaff). If she hadn't been a special filly, this wouldn't have happened. She 
was just determined to win that race." 
</P>
<P>
Breeders' Cup day claimed the lives of two other horses, their deaths clearly 
not related to the debate over the safety of the track. Mr. Nickerson, running 
in the Sprint, apparently had a heart attack, and Shaker Knit, who fell in the 
same spill, suffered partial paralysis and was destroyed Saturday night. Since 
last Tuesday, at least five horses have died from either racing or training 
injuries at Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Lukas, whose stable has been hardest hit by the wave of injuries, said 
that one of the reasons he withdrew Deposit Ticket from the Breeders' Cup 
Juvenile was the track's recent wave of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a track superintendent," Lukas said, "but this is something that 
should be looked in to." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry McKeon, the president of the racing association that runs Belmont, 
compared Saturday's Breeders' Cup with "having one of your relatives die at 
your wedding." 
</P>
<P>
Belmont's track superintendent, Joe King, enjoys a national reputation. King is 
even known as a "track doctor," who is frequently called in by other tracks 
with surface problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The track is fine," McKeon said. "It's just that accidents do happen." 
</P>
<P>
LeRoy Jolley, who trains Meadow Star, the undefeated winner of the Breeders' 
Cup Juvenile Fillies, was critical of Belmont's racing surface even before 
Saturday. Jolley refers to the track as "Big Sandy." Brian Mayberry, the 
California trainer who was forced to pull Garden Gal out of the Juvenile 
Fillies, said that Belmont is "like the Sahara Desert." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Belmont surface is about 90% sand. "You get weather like we have 
in the fall, with a lot of wind, and it's difficult to keep water on the 
track," Jolley said. "And since it's also such a big track (the only 1 1/2-mile 
oval in the country), that makes it tougher to maintain. The sand just doesn't 
hold the water as well. I've been a heavy critic of the track recently, but 
it's odd, after what has happened in recent weeks, because I think the track's 
better now than it's been in the two previous years." 
</P>
<P>
Told of Jolley's remarks, Mayberry said: "If it was worse two years ago, I 
can't believe how bad it could have been, because it was an awful track on 
Saturday. When you see world-class sprinters running (six furlongs) in only 
1:09 3/5, you have to believe there's something wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe this sounds like heresy around here, but I think the California tracks 
are far better for horses than the one they have here. One of the most 
difficult things a horse has to do is to adjust to different surfaces, and the 
Belmont surface is so much different than most surfaces, I can see where horses 
will have problems." 
</P>
<P>
Nick Zito, whose Thirty Six Red ran third in the Breeders' Cup Classic, felt 
that Go For Wand's injury was more a matter of physics than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a 1,000-pound horse running 45 miles an hour," Zito said. "And trying 
to do all that with ankles only as big as ours." 
</P>
<P>
Go For Wand, because of the wishes of her owner, Jane du Pont Lunger, will be 
buried at Saratoga, where the filly ran some of her best races. Mr. Nickerson 
will be buried in the infield at Belmont, not far from the graves of Ruffian 
and Timely Writer, other horses who died while racing. 
</P>
<P>
Missing at Go For Wand's barn Sunday morning was Rose Badgett, the filly's 
exercise rider, who married the trainer less than a month ago. Her husband was 
back at work, mainly going through the motions, but his wife could not yet face 
the reality of looking into that open stall. 
</P>
<P>
"Rose is not doing so great," Badgett said. "She loved that horse more than she 
loved me. We're all going to have to reach down and keep going. It's hard to 
walk past her stall and see it empty." 
</P>
<P>
Go For Wand was always a handful around that stall, a high-strung filly who 
required much handling. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was her groom, I'd quit," Badgett once said. 
</P>
<P>
Badgett was an assistant trainer for Woody Stephens when Swale won the 1984 
Belmont Stakes and then died from an undetermined cause about a week after the 
race. "I was standing right next to him when he went down (in the shed row)," 
Badgett said. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, Jane du Pont Lunger called Badgett and they tried 
unsuccessfully to console each other. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope you can find another one like her," Lunger said. 
</P>
<P>
Both knew that there is only a remote chance of that ever happening.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<P>
Even in callous Las Vegas, horseplayers wept after Go For Wand broke down in 
the Breeders' Cup Saturday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What made things worse was NBC replaying the tragedy over and over and over 
again. It was sickening. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Go For Wand's death is a reminder that the most fragile of all athletes is the 
thoroughbred, a 1,000-pound animal racing as fast as 40 m.p.h. on spindly legs. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Not enough credit has been given the winner of the Distaff, Bayakoa, a 
remarkable mare who has won 16 of her last 21 races and two consecutive 
Breeders' Cups. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled won the two biggest races, the Kentucky Derby and the Breeders' Cup 
Classic, but horse-of-the-year honors should go to Criminal Type, who was more 
consistent and beat much better fields. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If Sprint runner-up Dayjur had jumped a shadow in his previous race, how come 
he wasn't wearing a shadow roll at Belmont Park?. . . . 
</P>
<P>
No wonder Chris McCarron didn't win a race. His mounts went off at odds of 
113-1, 17-1, 36-1 and 23-1. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens' ride on Turf winner In The Wings was as good as any all day. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
What did Evander Holyfield prove Thursday night when he won the heavyweight 
title from Buster Mathis -- uh, Douglas -- in Las Vegas? He can jab. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I left after the first round," ringsider Bill Cosby said. "Holyfield outjabbed 
Buster. I didn't need to see any more. The fight was over. The tip-off came 
when Buster entered the ring and his breasts bounced off his face." 
</P>
<P>
.. . . 
</P>
<P>
The trouble with Buster was that he hadn't eaten in almost eight minutes and 
was in a hurry to return to his dressing room for a snack. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Now it's easy to believe those reports that Douglas weighed 275 pounds when he 
finally got back into the gym after his upset of Mike Tyson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Douglas joins Tim Witherspoon, Greg Page and Tony Tubbs on the list of recent 
heavyweight champions who came into the ring flabby for their first title 
defense and lost. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Winner-take-all is unrealistic, but maybe a percentage of the purse should go 
to the winner and a lesser amount to the loser. In boxing, champions have been 
guaranteed 20 times as much as challengers. But in tennis or golf, being the 
defending champion assures you of nothing except a spot in the field. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Second best-conditioned heavyweight on the card Thursday was Riddick Bowe. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: Holyfield and former New York Giant linebacker Harry Carson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
British promoter Mickey Duff on Holyfield-George Foreman: "It will be a tough 
fight for five rounds. Then youth will prevail.". . . . 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield opened as a 5-1 favorite over Foreman at one Las Vegas betting parlor 
and 3 1/2-1 at another. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If Holyfield had lost to Douglas, he would have been guaranteed $3 million and 
Foreman $4 million for a non-title match. Instead, Holyfield will get $20 
million and Foreman $12 million. . . . 
</P>
<P>
All three fights at the Mirage have been stinkers -- 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield-Douglas, Michael Nunn-Marlon Starling and Sugar Ray Leonard-Roberto 
Duran. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The rematch of a great fight, Julio Cesar Chavez-Meldrick Taylor, is set for 
February. No title will be at stake and the weight will be 144 pounds, four 
over the junior-welterweight limit. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Name game: Junior-middleweight boxer Kenneth Whack. . . . 
</P>
<P>
That increase in box seat ticket prices at Dodger Stadium should help Peter 
O'Malley pay Darryl Strawberry. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Because of the body of his work, Todd Marinovich deserves to get his starting 
quarterback job back at USC if his classroom attendance picks up. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Washington is playing the finest college football in the nation. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Michigan is the best 4-3 team. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Lou Holtz doesn't give Raghib Ismail enough to do. The Rocket takes off from 
the line of scrimmage faster than maybe anybody ever. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's upset of Notre Dame becomes more incredible every week. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, Pat Dye would have gone for the tie if Auburn had been in the same 
situation as Mississippi State Saturday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The improved Miami Dolphins now can win easily even on days when Dan Marino 
throws only one touchdown pass. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Think New Orleans' offense is conservative enough? Steve Walsh completed 19 
passes for a grand total of 120 yards against Detroit. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Sunday wasn't quite the same without the Raiders. . . . 
</P>
<P>
From Jerry Tarkanian, coach of NCAA basketball champion Nevada Las Vegas: "We 
got H Waldman and if we would have gotten Shon Tarver, we would have had two 
honor students in the backcourt. I don't know if I could have related to them."

UCLA CENTER ZIMMERMAN MIGHT NEED SURGERY ON KNEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UCLA basketball team, which already has lost Ed O'Bannon to a season-ending 
knee injury, is also concerned about freshman Rodney Zimmerman, Coach Jim 
Harrick said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman, a 6-foot-9 center from Colorado Springs, Colo., is suffering from 
tendinitis in his right knee and could face arthroscopic surgery, or even major 
surgery, trainer Tony Spino said. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman's knee has locked on him twice, the first time during a drill on the 
first day of practice Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Tests have revealed no damage, but Harrick said that exploratory surgery has 
been recommended. Both Harrick and Zimmerman, however, prefer to wait. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman has not practiced since Tuesday. He will be held out for at least 
another three days, Harrick said, and probably will not play Thursday night in 
the Bruins' annual intra-squad game at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
A decision on possible surgery will be made next week. 
</P>
<P>
Spino said that in 20 years as a trainer he had never seen a more acute case of 
patella tendinitis. "I took care of Bill Walton when he was here, and Bill was 
never that bad," Spino said. 
</P>
<P>
If surgery were to be required on the patella, Spino said, Zimmerman would be 
sidelined for about 4 1/2 months. If the problem is the meniscus, Spino said, 
the cartilage could be repaired arthroscopically and Zimmerman would be 
sidelined for only about three or four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Of the more serious procedure, Harrick said: "We're not going to do that this 
year unless -- well, I really shouldn't say we're not going to do that. I guess 
it's up in the air." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA opens the season against UC Irvine in the first round of the Great Alaska 
Shootout Nov. 23 at Anchorage, Alaska.

SPOTLIGHT / A GLANCE AT THIS WEEK IN THE NFL; 
</P>
<P>
HAUNTED HOUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't a very good day for home teams, it was a bad day for dome teams, but 
if you really wanted to suffer, you were a home dome team. 
</P>
<P>
There was no home-field advantage on this given Sunday as visitors won six of 
12 games, including five of the six morning games. The only home team to win a 
10 a.m. PST game was the Green Bay Packers, who weren't even playing in Green 
Bay. Playing in Milwaukee, the Packers beat the Minnesota Vikings, who were out 
from under their Metrodome. 
</P>
<P>
But it was even worse for those dome teams playing in familiar surroundings: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Houston Oilers, playing in the Astrodome, were surprised by the New 
York Jets, 17-12, on the Jets' first fourth-quarter touchdown of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The New Orleans Saints, usually so tough in the Superdome, were anything 
but super against the Detroit Lions, turning the ball over eight times in a 
27-10 loss to the Detroit Lions. The Lions, of course, are another dome team, 
but they were fortunate enough to be playing on the road this Halloween week. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Hoosier Dome roof caved in on the Indianapolis Colts against Miami. The 
Colts lost quarterbacks Jack Trudeau and Jeff George in the Dolphins' 27-7 
victory and Eric Dickerson rushed 10 times for 27 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Dallas Cowboys (well, they're practically a dome team with that roof at 
Texas Stadium) lost to Philadelphia in the last minute, 21-20. 
</P>
<P>
The Seattle Seahawks had a bye. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BIG PLAYS 
</P>
<P>
Mike Cofer's 45-yard field goal with five seconds remaining gave the San 
Francisco 49ers their 15th consecutive victory, 20-17, over the Cleveland 
Browns. 
</P>
<P>
Randall Cunningham's 10-yard touchdown pass to Calvin Williams with 44 seconds 
left gave the Philadelphia Eagles a 21-20 victory over the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Thompson ran 12 yards for his first career touchdown and Shawn 
Patterson returned an interception nine yards for another score as the Green 
Bay Packers handed the Minnesota Vikings their fifth consecutive loss, 24-10. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Williams returned a fumble 53 yards for a touchdown and the Detroit Lions 
intercepted three of Steve Walsh's passes to beat the New Orleans Saints, 
27-10. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie defensive end Darrell Davis recovered a fumble by Houston's Warren Moon 
in the end zone as the New York Jets defeated the Oilers, 17-12. 
</P>
<P>
Miami linebacker Cliff Odom recovered a fumble for a touchdown and made a 
vicious sideline tackle that knocked quarterback Jack Trudeau from the game 
Sunday as the Dolphins beat the Indianapolis Colts, 27-7. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NO CHOKE 
</P>
<P>
Coaches Jimmy Johnson of the Dallas Cowboys and Buddy Ryan of the Philadelphia 
Eagles have had a running battle of words since Johnson entered the league, and 
it came to an ugly, name-calling head during the Bounty Bowl last November. 
</P>
<P>
But there weren't any harsh words this week. Only pork chops, which was this 
week's main course at the Cowboys' media luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
In December 1988, Ryan choked on a pork chop during a coaches' meal the week 
before the Eagles played the Cowboys. Ted Plum, then the Eagles' offensive 
coordinator, administered the Heimlich maneuver to clear Ryan's airway. 
Evidently somebody in Dallas has a good memory -- and a unique sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles didn't choke against the Cowboys, however, with Randall Cunningham's 
last-minute touchdown pass giving Buddy and Co. a 21-20 victory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
The Colts lost two quarterbacks. Jack Trudeau sustained a torn ligament in his 
right knee and will be out for the season. Rookie Jeff George went out with a 
bruised left knee on a sack by Miami's Karl Wilson late in the third quarter, 
leaving 40-year-old Joe Ferguson as the only injury-free quarterback for 
Indianapolis. Trudeau also missed most of the 1988 season with torn ligaments 
in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Sherrard, the 49ers' oft-injured receiver who missed most of the past two 
seasons after twice breaking his right leg, broke a bone in his left ankle and 
will be out the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman hurt both elbows in the loss to the Eagles, but 
neither of the injuries was thought to be serious. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago cornerback Donnell Woolford was taken off the field on a stretcher 
after injuring his left ankle in the first quarter. An examination in the 
locker room showed that he suffered a sprained ankle and pulled groin muscle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PACKERS ON THE RUN 
</P>
<P>
When the Green Bay Packers drafted Brent Fullwood in the first round in 1987, 
they thought he would be the answer to their rushing woes. He wasn't. Fullwood 
fell so far short of expectation that he was released a couple of weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, the Packers were able to run the ball against Minnesota, gaining 126 
yards and taking some of the heat off quarterback Don Majkowski, who was sacked 
six times. It was their second highest rushing total this season. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a nice change," said Majkowski. "This is what the doctor ordered for 
us. It was a desperately needed win." 
</P>
<P>
The new hope for the Packer ground game is Darrell Thompson, a first-round pick 
from Minnesota. Thompson says he momentarily forgot that his 12-yard touchdown 
run in the second quarter was the first of his career. "Sterling (Sharpe) told 
me to go back and get the ball. I think I'll keep that ball." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OLD FRIENDS 
</P>
<P>
Plan B? Plan Backfire? 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Cliff Odom wanted a chance to play when he left Indianapolis to sign 
with Miami. Sunday he hurt the Colts, literally, when his violent hit knocked 
out quarterback Jack Trudeau. He also recovered a fumble for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit's Robert Clark was Rodney Peete's favorite receiver against the Saints, 
the team that didn't protect him in 1989. Clark caught six passes for 127 yards 
in the Lions' 27-10 victory. 
</P>
<P>
And cornerback Donnie Elder, a Buccaneer last season, made his first 
interception as a Charger in San Diego's 41-10 victory over Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GETTING RUSTY? 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots' 27-10 loss to Buffalo doesn't bode well for Rod Rust, New 
England's 62-year-old rookie coach. 
</P>
<P>
The last time New England lost six of its first seven games was in 1970. Clive 
Rush was fired as coach after the seventh game. John Mazur succeeded him and 
also went 1-6. 
</P>
<P>
The worst record in the Patriots' other 30 seasons was 2-14 in 1981, when they 
lost their last nine games. Ron Erhardt was fired after the season. 
</P>
<P>
There is no indication that management is ready to make a coaching change, but 
with the poor start and the team's off-the-field problems (the Lisa Olson 
crisis, the Irving Fryar-Hart Lee Dykes crisis) it could be a close shave for 
Rust. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NAMES AND NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
Al Toon caught seven passes for 119 yards and moved into third place on the New 
York Jets' all-time receiving list behind Don Maynard and Wesley Walker. He has 
5,006 career receiving yards and moved past George Sauer into the No. 3 spot. 
Toon also extended to 70 games his streak for catching at least one pass. 
</P>
<P>
Oiler quarterback Warren Moon passed for more than 300 yards for the 21st time 
in his regular-season NFL career. . . . Oiler kicker Teddy Garcia, replacing 
the injured Tony Zendejas, kicked field goals of 42 and 49 yards, but missed 
two field goals and an extra point. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Morgan of Indianapolis recorded his ninth reception of the season in 
the third quarter, moving past Lance Alworth into 13th place on the NFL 
all-time list with 542 catches. He finished with two catches for 35 yards, 
bringing his total yardage in 14 years to 10,511. . . . Indianapolis center Ray 
Donaldson played in his 156th consecutive non-strike game. That would have been 
a club record, but his streak was officially ended when he missed three strike 
games in 1987. The NFL ruled that all streaks for consecutive games were broken 
by players who sat out the strike. 
</P>
<P>
Miami limited Indianapolis to 32 yards rushing and 117 yards passing. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix Cardinal wide receiver Roy Green became the franchise's all-time leader 
in reception yardage. Green caught five passes for 89 yards and has 8,002 yards 
in his 12-year NFL career. He entered the game five yards shy of tight end 
Jackie Smith's mark of 7,918 set from 1963 to 1977 and eclipsed that on a 
nine-yard catch 1:39 before halftime. . . . Phoenix rookie Johnny Johnson, 
going for his third consecutive 100-yard rushing game, managed 74 yards in 16

Tampa Bay quarterback Chris Chandler, who threw four interceptions and fumbled 
in the Buccaneers' 41-10 loss to San Diego: "I have to say this was the worst 
game I've ever played at any level."

<P>
Tampa Bay Coach Ray Perkins: "I'm embarrassed. They (the Buccaneer players) 
should be, too. If they're not, they should be in another profession." 
</P>
<P>
New York Giant linebacker Lawrence Taylor: "We have a three-game lead and you 
should win the division with a three-game lead. We should win unless we do 
something stupid and we don't plan on doing something stupid."

Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson: "We've come a long way but we're not there yet." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit linebacker Jimmy Williams, who returned a fumble 53 yards for a

GIANTS IMPROVE TO 7-0 WITH 21-10 VICTORY; 
</P>
<P>

<P>
The New York Giants continued their mastery of the Washington Redskins Sunday 
with the help of some lucky bounces that gave the unbeaten Giants a 21-10 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants (7-0), who have defeated the Redskins six consecutive times, were 
leading, 14-10, when Washington quarterback Stan Humphries threw what appeared 
would be a touchdown pass to a wide-open Earnest Byner with 6:51 left. 
</P>
<P>
The ball, however, bounced off Byner's shoulder pad and into the hands of New 
York's Greg Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Two minutes later, Everson Walls intercepted a pass from Humphries and returned 
it 28 yards for the first touchdown of his 10-year career to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a three-game lead and you should win the division with a three-game 
lead," Giant linebacker Lawrence Taylor said. "We should win unless we do 
something stupid and we don't plan on doing something stupid." 
</P>
<P>
Said Washington defensive end Charles Mann: "They just believe they're going to 
do it and they have so much confidence it becomes reality. I'm not saying we're 
not confident but there's that ounce of doubt and that kills us." 
</P>
<P>
Giant quarterback Phil Simms completed 15 of 24 passes for 145 yards and two 
touchdowns. The Giants took a 14-0 lead on a four-yard touchdown pass play from 
Simms to Stephen Baker and a 13-yard scoring play from Simms to Mark Bavaro. 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins pulled to within 14-3 at halftime on a 45-yard field goal by Chip 
Lohmiller. 
</P>
<P>
Washington (4-3) dominated the third quarter, scoring on a five-yard scramble 
by Humphries at the end of a 54-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with 12:29 left, the Giants failed on fourth down when Ottis Anderson, 
who finished with 92 yards in 24 carries, was stuffed with inches to go for a 
first down at the Washington 45. 
</P>
<P>
From there, the Redskins moved to the New York three. Humphries, who at that 
point had 11 consecutive completions, rolled left and threw the ill-fated pass 
to Byner that bounced right to Jackson, who had two interceptions in New York's 
24-20 win over the Redskins two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared at first," Jackson said. "Luckily, he dropped the ball. I saw it 
up in the air when it hit his hand. There was a second. . .then I was 
relieved." 
</P>
<P>
Then came Walls' interception, the 48th of his career and his fourth in this 
comeback season, and the Giants had beaten the Redskins once again. 
</P>
<P>
Humphries completed 19 of 28 passes for 141 yards and had three passes 
intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
Washington tight end Don Warren had a career-high 10 receptions for 66 yards 
but Art Monk, Ricky Sanders and Gary Clark, had just four receptions among 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Washington Coach Joe Gibbs seemed resigned to fighting for a wild-card berth in 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not conceding anything but it's going to be awfully hard," Gibbs said.

Cliff Odom was cut loose by the Indianapolis Colts last spring and Sunday the 
veteran linebacker made his former team pay for it, even though he was not 
trying to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Odom, a 10-year pro out of Texas Arlington, recovered a fumble for a touchdown 
and made a jarring sideline tackle that sidelined quarterback Jack Trudeau for 
the season during the Miami Dolphins' 27-7 victory over the Colts. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth consecutive victory for Miami (6-1), its longest winning 
streak in five years. 
</P>
<P>
"My intent was just to go out there and play the same type of football that 
Cliff Odom always plays," said Odom, a former defensive captain for the Colts 
who led the team in tackles during two of his eight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Odom's touchdown, the first of his career, came on the second play against the 
Colts (2-5), who left him on the unprotected free agent list last spring. 
Trudeau fumbled the snap at the one-yard line and Odom fell on the ball in the 
end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Odom stopped Trudeau with a clean shot three plays into the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack's a good friend of mine," Odom said. "I didn't want him to be hurt. It's 
unfortunate it happened. I hate for anybody to be hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Trudeau, who missed most of the 1988 season with torn ligaments in his left 
knee, sustained a torn ligament in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
"Odom was trying to do everything he could to make a play," Colt Coach Ron 
Meyer said. "It wasn't a malicious hit, it wasn't a late hit. Unfortunately, 
that's football." 
</P>
<P>
Rookie quarterback Jeff George went out with a bruised left knee on a sack by 
Karl Wilson late in the third quarter, leaving veteran Joe Ferguson as the only 
healthy quarterback for the Colts. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins' defense limited Indianapolis to 32 yards rushing and 117 yards 
passing from its trio of quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Dickerson, playing in just his second game since rejoining the Colts, was 
limited to 27 yards in 10 carries, ending a streak of six consecutive 100-yard 
games against the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
Liffort Hobley intercepted a pass by Ferguson on the final play of the third 
quarter to set up Miami's final touchdown, a two-yard run by Tony Paige that 
completed a 14-play, 70-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Pete Stoyanovich kicked two field goals and Jim Jensen caught a 
five-yard touchdown pass from Dan Marino, who completed 21 of 29 pases for 161 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Trudeau completed all three of his passes for 19 yards before he was injured. 
George completed eight of 15 passes for 77 yards and Ferguson completed two of 
eight passes for 21 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't very pleasant out there," Meyer said. "We were beaten soundly in 
virtually every aspect."

BILLS GO TO WORK EARLY IN A 27-10 VICTORY;

Buffalo didn't need any miracles against the New England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills, who won their previous three games with improbable fourth-quarter 
comebacks, were cruising by that time Sunday to a 27-10 victory over the 
Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to come from behind even though we played well (in the last three 
games)," Buffalo Coach Marv Levy said. "We knew we had to get off to a good 
start (against New England.)" 
</P>
<P>
Don Smith scored on a one-yard run to give the Bills a 7-0 lead on their first 
possession. Thurman Thomas, who rushed for 136 yards, scored on a three-yard 
run midway through the second quarter and Buffalo (6-1) had a 14-3 lead at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills put the game away by scoring on three consecutive possessions in the 
third quarter to make it 27-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots (1-6) have lost their last five games and are off to their worst 
start since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
"It serves no purpose (to discuss the poor start)," New England rookie Coach 
Rod Rust said. "(The Bills) did what they wanted to better than we did what we 
wanted to." 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in six games, the Bills never trailed. They outgained the 
Patriots, 353 yards to 262. 
</P>
<P>
The memory of last year's 33-24 loss in which a poor Patriots' team scored 20 
points in the last nine minutes at Foxboro spurred the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
"This team was very aware that last year's game slipped away," Levy said. 
"We're not taking anything for granted." 
</P>
<P>
Jason Staurovsky's 32-yard field goal 12 seconds before intermission cut the 
lead to 14-3, but the Patriots didn't score again until they trailed by 24 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"We're asking too much of the defense," New England tackle Bruce Armstrong 
said. "We're asking them to stop the other team time and time again and that's 
not fair." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who missed most of a 30-27 victory over the New York Jets last week 
with a right knee injury, returned to the lineup and picked right up where he 
left off. 
</P>
<P>
"Thomas had a very good game," said quarterback Jim Kelly, who completed 14 of 
20 passes for 208 yards and a touchdown. "The offensive line gave me time to 
throw." 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 14-3, the Bills punted on their first possession of the third quarter, 
then scored on two 35-yard field goals by Scott Norwood and a 20-yard pass from 
Kelly to Keith McKeller. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots made it six consecutive games with just one offensive touchdown 
when quarterback Steve Grogan, who missed the previous four games with a neck 
injury, threw a 19-yard scoring pass to Sammy Martin with 3:19 gone in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth time in five games, a New England opponent scored on its first 
possession when Kelly led the Bills on a 12-play, 68-yard drive lasting 7:08. 
Kelly completed all five of his passes for 60 yards, with Smith's touchdown 
capping the drive.

CUNNINGHAM, EAGLES FEELING BETTER AFTER RALLY BEATS COWBOYS;

Randall Cunningham was battered and bruised, but not beaten. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, working against the clock with a bruised hand and knee, drove the 
Philadelphia Eagles 85 yards in 13 plays for the go-ahead touchdown that gave 
the Eagles a 21-20 victory over the Dallas Cowboys Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The winning score came on Cunningham's 10-yard pass to Calvin Williams with 44 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"This ranks right up there with the best of our comeback wins," said 
Cunningham, who passed for 66 yards and ran for 10 on the drive. "This was a 
major gut check and we pulled it off. 
</P>
<P>
"Our two-minute drill worked great and our feeling in the huddle was we weren't 
concerned. We knew we could do it." 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles (3-4) got their first victory over an NFC Eastern Division foe in 
four tries in beating the Cowboys (3-5) for the sixth consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, who also suffered a blow to the head during the game, said, "I was 
close to coming out of the game because my knee hurt so bad. But I stuck it 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Issiac Holt blocked a punt to set up Emmitt Smith's three-yard 
touchdown run with 4:02 left to give Dallas a 20-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like the blocked punt was going to kill us but Randall put together 
one heck of a drive," Philadelphia Coach Buddy Ryan said. "Dallas played a 
great game. We were very fortunate to pull it out at the end." 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way we seem to do things. It was a big game for us and our season." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said last week there was no way Philadelphia was going to lose to Dallas 
and although he was right, he refused to rub it in. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the way that Troy Aikman plays," Ryan said. "Dallas gave us a good 
game. Cunningham told me he wanted to win it and he did." 
</P>
<P>
Dallas charged back after Cunningham's last-minute scoring pass, but Ben Smith 
broke up a fourth-down pass at the Philadelphia 35 as the final gun sounded. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to give Philadelphia credit," Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson said. "They 
made the plays when it counted. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a tough, tough loss. I just wish there was something I could say to 
the team to make them feel better." 
</P>
<P>
Reserve fullback Heath Sherman broke four tackles on a 19-yard, fourth-quarter 
touchdown run to give the Eagles a 14-6 lead with 10:30 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
But Dallas went 64 yards in four plays, with Aikman connecting with Jay Novacek 
on a 19-yard touchdown pass play to narrow the Eagles' lead to 14-13 with 7:53 
left. 
</P>
<P>
The blocked punt gave the Cowboys their first lead of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia tight end Keith Jackson said the sellout crowd of 63,599 at Texas 
Stadium was guilty of celebrating prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
"With four minutes left the people were celebrating like the game was over or 
something," Jackson said. "When you have a quarterback like Cunningham anything 
is possible."

Jennifer Capriati won her first professional tournament by beating top-seeded 
Zina Garrison, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, in the finals of the Puerto Rico Open Sunday at 
San Juan. 
</P>
<P>
Since turning pro in March, the 14-year-old Capriati had reached the finals of 
the Virginia Slims of Florida and at Hilton Head, S.C., but lost both times. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati got in only 41% of her first services and committed 26 unforced errors 
compared to Garrison's 76% service accuracy and 32 errors. Capriati, however, 
committed only eight unforced errors in the last two sets.

Boris Becker, playing one of the best indoor matches of his career, breezed to 
a 6-4, 6-0, 6-3 victory over top-ranked Stefan Edberg in the championship match 
of the Stockholm Open. 
</P>
<P>
Becker turned an early hard-hitting duel into a rout in the second set and 
destroyed any hopes of what was supposed to be a dream final between the 
world's Nos. 1 and 2 players. 
</P>
<P>
The German, who also won the event in 1988, served and returned to near 
perfection on the fast Supreme Court at the Globe Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Becker earned $137,450 for his fifth ATP Tour title of the year. He also beat 
Edberg in the Sydney Indoors final earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg, playing his 50th career final, dropped to 9-17 in career meetings with 
Becker. 
</P>
<P>
Steffi Graf won her ninth tournament of the year, beating Helena Sukova, 7-5, 
6-3, in a $350,000 indoor tournament at Brighton, England. It was Graf's 17th 
consecutive victory over Sukova. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Birch upset her Stanford teammate and doubles partner, Debbie Graham, 
6-2, 3-6, 7-5, in the final of the Riviera Country Club's All-American Tennis

singles champion.

Hextall was playing his first game since Oct. 11, when he suffered a pulled

The Philadelphia 76ers dropped veteran guard Derek Smith and acquired rookie 
Jayson Williams from the Phoenix Suns in exchange for a 1993 first-round draft 
pick. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, a 6-10 forward, was the Suns' 21st selection in the June draft. The 
trade is contingent on Williams passing a physical and signing a contract, 
which the 76ers expect today. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 29, a former Clipper, underwent knee surgery Sept. 26 and played in none

1 SLAIN, 2 HURT IN GANG FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bloody street brawl between rival gangs in Van Nuys this weekend left one 
youth dead and two others injured, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with guns, knives and baseball bats, as many as eight members of two 
rival gangs clashed in a melee that erupted in the 13200 block of Vanowen 
Street about 8:20 p.m., on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
When police arrived they found Jesus G. Gilberto, 17, of North Hollywood 
mortally wounded by gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager died two hours later at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Two other victims of the same brawl arrived at another hospital for treatment a 
short time later. A 21-year-old North Hollywood man was in critical but stable 
condition with a stab wound, while an 18-year-old, also from North Hollywood, 
was treated for injuries caused by a baseball bat, police said. The 18-year-old 
was treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
Neither of the men was identified, and police did not say if the two men or the 
dead youth were gang members. The two men were not arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they were looking for others involved and had not determined what 
sparked the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
Residents living in apartment buildings in the neighborhood said they heard 
shouting in the street, followed by a series of gunshots in quick succession. 
After the shots, they said, as many as seven people fled from Vanowen and Atoll 
Avenue, leaving the dead youth behind in the street.

MONEY BATTLES AT UCSD SPUR PRENATAL FLAP; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: DOCTORS' FEES LED TO A DECISION -- NOW APPARENTLY RESCINDED -- TO 
DROP A PROGRAM THAT USES NURSE-MIDWIVES TO GIVE PRENATAL CARE AND DELIVERY 
SERVICES TO POOR WOMEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
To the outside eye, UC San Diego's Medical School, Medical Center, Department 
of Reproductive Medicine and doctors and nurses are one and the same. But 
divisions between competing interests -- particularly financial ones -- in the 
institution can run deep. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere was that more apparent than in the recent fiasco over whether UCSD was 
going to shut down its pioneering program that uses nurse-midwives to give 
prenatal care and delivery services to poor women. 
</P>
<P>
At least in part, you could call it a case of the right hand not having access 
to $961 that was in the left pocket. 
</P>
<P>
First, the Department of Reproductive Medicine, a division within the medical 
school, issued an Oct. 16 memo saying the program would end because of 
financial difficulties. Chiefly blamed for the shutdown were anticipated losses 
of $250,000 to $350,000 a year in physicians' fees. 
</P>
<P>
These are fees that wouldn't be paid to faculty obstetricians for their help 
with Caesarean section and other problem deliveries of women in the perinatal 
program, said the former director of the Comprehensive Perinatal Program (CPP), 
Ann Bush-Sheresh. Instead, under a standing agreement between the CPP and the 
medical school's Reproductive Medicine Department, such fees have long gone to 
the perinatal program to help it operate. 
</P>
<P>
But if the women were not receiving prenatal care through the CPP, the faculty 
obstetricians would receive up to $961.20 from Medi-Cal for each woman who 
walked into the emergency room in labor. 
</P>
<P>
Bush-Sheresh left CPP in April because, she said, she couldn't bear to see the 
program she spent 10 years building dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
Suspicions about this potential financial incentive for killing CPP was one of 
several reasons that the shutdown plan brought a storm of anger and disbelief 
when it was revealed publicly last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
How, critics asked, could a state-funded institution deliberately add 1,000 
babies a year to the 4,000 in San Diego County whose mothers get no medical 
care at all during their pregnancies? Fragile premature babies, hooked to tubes 
and wires instead of safe inside their mothers' wombs, are often the result of 
the lack of prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
The end of the Comprehensive Perinatal Program also surprised key parts of the 
hospital's bureaucracy -- emphasizing the separate roads that different parts 
of the UCSD medical establishment can choose to travel on the same issue. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did the action make the hospital look like it was backing away from 
caring for the poor (an issue on which administrators are particularly 
sensitive) but it also came when the hospital was trying to work out agreements 
to get more -- not less -- prenatal care for poor women. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, the administrators' "damage control" messages had intensified: 
The decision to close the perinatal program hadn't ever really been made, UCSD 
spokeswomen contended. It was a departmental move, not an administrative 
decision, they said. 
</P>
<P>
All this backtracking made it apparent that there had been little coordination 
in making the decision between the Reproductive Medicine Department and 
hospital administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Contacts also were lacking with county officials and other university 
departments, such as the joint UCSD-UC San Francisco master's program that 
trains nurse-midwives as part of the CPP program. 
</P>
<P>
"I have already gotten calls from across the country asking, 'Is your program 
closing?' " said Judith Fullerton, director of graduate nursing programs at 
UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
The midwives can be trained at other area hospitals, but Fullerton said she is 
concerned that in the meanwhile, the CPP crisis will scare away potential 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a decision that was made in a vacuum," said County Supervisor 
Brian Bilbray of the CPP closure. 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray and other county officials were particularly upset because the county 
subsidizes UCSD Medical Center every year for care to poor people. That 
amounted to $8.5 million in 1989-90. The county also helped make the hospital 
eligible for $2.6 million in state aid under AB-75, the tobacco tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
"We backfilled millions of dollars by being willing to bite the bullet in other 
areas and provide for (UCSD) programs that had been funded in the past," 
Bilbray said. 
</P>
<P>
But this money for uncompensated care -- $11.1 million total last fiscal year 
-- goes to the medical center, not necessarily to the medical school 
departments or doctors. So state Medi-Cal reforms that helped hospitals didn't 
end UCSD obstetricians' continuing complaints that they weren't being paid for 
individual medical procedures. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Bush-Sheresh points out, the physicians can expect little 
sympathy from the public. They are state-paid faculty at an academic 
institution, complete with the research opportunities, prestige and job 
protection of tenure. 
</P>
<P>
"These are faculty physicians at a university, and their base salary is being 
paid by the university," she said. "They're public employees. These people are 
being paid regardless." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are questions about another reason given for shutting down 
CPP, that the hospital's obstetrical facilities are too crowded. But at the 
same time, the university has been actively pursuing arrangements to deliver 
babies for private practices or community clinics whose patients would come 
with their own doctors and insurance or Medi-Cal funding. 
</P>
<P>
Any public perception of UCSD's hospital or doctors as greedy or insensitive to 
the community's needs comes at a particularly inopportune time for the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD is building a luxurious new hospital in La Jolla that critics had feared 
symbolized a lessening of UCSD's commitment to the poor. The lavishly decorated 
rooms at the new hospital will feature large picture windows, polished wood 
floors and other amenities that make them look like comfortable hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
In that context, those concerned with medical care for the poor ask, how much 
commitment to the poor is enough? Hospital officials say that, through their 
emergency room and clinics, they provide a great deal of free care already. 
</P>
<P>
But more than free care, the university has to provide responsibility and 
leadership in finding solutions to the poor's medical care problems, Supervisor 
Bilbray and others said. Killing CPP did the opposite, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"The UC system can't expect to be an ivory tower set aside from the realities 
of the people and the communities that they serve," Bilbray said. "The 
taxpayers, rich and poor, pay the bills for that operation, so the taxpayer 
should gain a cross-section benefit of those expenses." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the week, high-level UCSD hospital and medical school officials 
were behaving as though they agreed. Discussions on how to save CPP, with 
fiscal responsibility outside of the medical school, were continuing. 
</P>
<P>
But university officials did not return repeated phone calls and spokeswomen 
refused to release any details of the financial underpinnings of the initial 
decision to close CPP. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing in the discussions that indicates that the service that has 
been provided is going to change, but to restructure it so that the fiscal 
responsibility for it lies elsewhere, outside the department of medicine," 
public information chief Leslie Franz said. 
</P>
<P>
She denied that physicians had any financial incentive to shut CPP down, but 
did not provide any details. More information won't be released until an 
agreement is reached, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole thing has been turned into mass confusion because of the bits and 
pieces coming out in the press," Franz said. "If there's egg on our face, 
that's the point at which it will be wiped off."

GROWTH MEASURES GIVE RISE TO PERPLEXING CAMPAIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Growth management, a staple of San Diego politics that, under the best of 
circumstances, is a thorny, complex subject, will be before voters again next 
month in an election that seems destined to raise the normal confusion 
surrounding it to new levels. 
</P>
<P>
In a scenario dubbed the "stealth campaign" by one slow-growth advocate, the 
building industry spent several hundred thousand dollars qualifying two growth 
initiatives for the city and county ballots, then backed away from the 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the murkiness, while no one is actively campaigning for Propositions 
D and M, many builders decline to say whether they support or oppose the 
measures. Typifying most developers' attitude, one construction industry 
spokesman said simply: "It would be nice if they just dropped off the ballot." 
</P>
<P>
Skeptical opponents, meanwhile, have accused developers of cleverly trying to 
pass the initiatives by distancing themselves from the two propositions, known 
as the Traffic Control and Comprehensive Growth Management Initiatives. 
Moreover, with the campaign attracting little public attention, opponents worry 
that the measures may pass on Nov. 6 simply because of their appealing titles. 
</P>
<P>
"Our biggest fear is that a lot of voters who know nothing about (the 
propositions) will be swayed just by their nice-sounding names," said Peter 
Navarro, chairman of the slow-growth group Prevent Los Angelization Now, or 
PLAN. "The builders' best chance for passing these things is to become 
invisible. They realize they're the kiss of death for any proposition they 
publicly support." 
</P>
<P>
Although overshadowed by Proposition M and its companion measure dealing with 
county lands, Proposition D, two other growth and open space measures also 
appear on the city's ballot. Proposition E asks voters to authorize a 
$100-million bond for the acquisition or improvement of parks and open space, 
while Proposition L would amend San Diego's charter to require public approval 
of the sale of 80 acres or more of city-owned land. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of strong opposition to the open-space bond measure and with 
Proposition L seen as having limited application, the low-profile campaign on 
Propositions D and M has become this year's version of San Diego's almost 
annual electoral debate over growth management. 
</P>
<P>
Originally envisioned by developers as a safeguard against potentially tougher 
growth restrictions, the two measures left the construction industry in a 
peculiar position when those more stringent possibilities failed to materialize 
either on the ballot or at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, after PLAN decided not to place an initiative on the ballot and the 
City Council diluted its own growth plan this fall, many developers were 
chagrined to realize that the two propositions created to protect their 
interests conceivably could raise, not lower, development expenses. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, builders strongly oppose the propositions' major component: a 
so-called transportation impact fee designed to make new development help pay 
for new major roads, freeways and expansion of the San Diego Trolley. Over the 
next two decades, the fee -- which would be levied on developments both in the 
city of San Diego and the county's unincorporated areas -- would raise an 
estimated $643 million. 
</P>
<P>
Under the propositions, those fees would be capped at $200 per "average daily 
trip" produced by new development, or $2,000 per single-family home. In a 
paradox that neatly underlines the polarity of San Diego's growth-management 
battles, slow-growth advocates dismiss those limits as unrealistically low even 
as builders lament that they are too high. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed fees, critics complain, would raise only about one-third of the 
money needed to pay the public costs associated with growth. Builders, though, 
hasten to note that the fees are almost twice as high as the $1,100-per-home 
first-year ceiling tentatively approved by the City Council -- a cost that 
could be reduced or even postponed when the city's growth plan returns to the 
council for further action next month. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt the industry could be hurt if D and M pass, because they 
establish fees that would not be in place otherwise," said Mike Madigan, senior 
vice president of Pardee Construction Co., who helped draft the measures that 
he now opposes. 
</P>
<P>
To Gary London, a spokesman for the San Diego 2000 Committee, the group that 
sponsored the two ballot measures, that too low-too high dichotomy is proof 
that the propositions represent more of a compromise than a one-sided, 
pro-development plan. 
</P>
<P>
"When neither side is entirely happy, maybe that means you've found a pretty 
good middle ground," said London, an economist who jokingly bills himself as 
the "one-man campaign" behind the propositions, whose ranks of public 
supporters have thinned almost weekly. 
</P>
<P>
The measures' major attributes, London argues, are that they approach 
growth-management on a regional basis, establish comprehensive planning 
guidelines in areas ranging from air and water quality to recycling and 
day-care centers, and require annual reports from public agencies on their 
progress in meeting those goals. 
</P>
<P>
But opponents, who include environmentalists, the entire county Board of 
Supervisors and most San Diego City Council members, complain that the 
propositions do little to strengthen -- and could even weaken -- the city's and 
county's existing growth-management programs. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, critics note that, in most cases, the propositions do not mandate 
stricter air, water reclamation, recycling or traffic-reduction standards, but 
rather simply establish goals. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, this just calls for reports, not implementation, on a lot of apple 
pie and motherhood issues like air and water quality," said Supervisor Susan 
Golding. "The last thing we need is more reports gathering dust. Besides, the 
initiatives call for less than we're doing now." 
</P>
<P>
While conceding that the propositions partly overlap existing programs, 
supporters argue that their passage could expedite the regional approach to 
growth management called for in an advisory 1988 ballot proposition. Despite 
professing support for that concept, local lawmakers have been reluctant to 
give up their autonomy over development within their individual jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
"This would give a good kick in the pants to the city and county, which have 
done a lot of talking about that but not much else," said San Marcos Mayor Lee 
Thibadeau. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond imposing the transportation impact fee, the propositions also would 
require that public facilities such as fire stations, parks and libraries be in 
place as new development occurs. But those provisions, too, are riddled with 
loopholes, thanks to the calculated vagueness of phrases such as "timely 
construction" and "where feasible" that appear in the propositions' ballot 
language. 
</P>
<P>
PLAN's Navarro, who derisively refers to the propositions' letter designations 
as standing for "Deceit" and "Manipulation," argues that more than 80% of 
development already proposed would be exempt from the initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not even an inch forward, but two giant steps backward," Navarro said. 
"To call this growth management is one of the bigger frauds we've ever seen 
foisted on the public." 
</P>
<P>
Reiterating a theme from past growth-management campaigns, opponents also argue 
that ballot initiatives are a poor mechanism for establishing major growth 
policy. The defects of one initiative can only be corrected by public approval 
of another initiative -- a costly and time-consuming procedure that severely 
limits legislative bodies' flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
"We should place the responsibility for resolving these issues where it belongs 
-- squarely in the laps of those we have elected to represent us," said 
University City activist Harry Mathis, another original supporter of the two 
propositions who now urges their rejection. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the propositions, however, emphasize that the Board of Supervisors 
or City Council could modify the measures by a two-thirds vote. "It doesn't 
take away legislative latitude," Thibadeau explained. 
</P>
<P>
In the growth-control plan that it adopted earlier this month, the San Diego 
City Council scaled back some tougher proposals by, among other things, 
rejecting a controversial plan to limit future development by linking building 
permits to strict standards for traffic congestion. The council also agreed to 
phase in the new citywide impact fees, with the estimated cost per 
single-family home rising from $1,100 this year to $4,400 by late 1993. 
</P>
<P>
That action was interpreted by some builders as evidence of the council's 
heightened sensitivity to how the nationwide economic downturn already is 
acting as a brake on development. Combined with the fact that the propositions' 
fees ultimately could exceed those set by the council, that helps explain why 
many developers have backed away from the measures. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a case where time and circumstance have overrun the original intent of 
the propositions," said Frank Panarisi, president of the Construction Industry 
Federation, whose organization has remained officially neutral in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Still suspicious of developers' motives, Navarro argues that builders' 
"now-we-support-it, now-we-don't" stance is ample reason for rejecting 
Propositions D and M. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no reason to trust them when they put these things on the ballot, 
and there's no reason to believe them now when they say they've changed their 
minds," Navarro said. 
</P>
<P>
There is considerably less disagreement over Proposition E, the proposed 
$100-million bond issue that, if passed, would enable the city to purchase and 
improve parks and open space. 
</P>
<P>
Called "an investment in San Diego's future" by City Councilman Ron Roberts, 
Proposition E is intended to replenish a $65-million open-space fund that the 
city's voters approved in 1978. That now-depleted fund, used to acquire 
hundreds of acres of open space throughout the city over the past decade, was 
repaid through franchise fees paid by San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Proposition E, whose supporters have adopted the slogan "Leave 
Something Green," would impose a surcharge of $16 per $100,000 of assessed 
valuation on property taxes for up to 30 years, with the fee gradually 
declining as the city's tax base expands. 
</P>
<P>
Of the $100 million raised by the tax, $15 million would be used to acquire 
land in the San Dieguito River Valley for a planned regional park, and another 
$15 million would be earmarked for land purchases in the Otay and Tijuana river 
valleys. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining $70 million would finance park projects throughout the city, 
particularly in older neighborhoods with limited recreational facilities. A 
14-page list of recommendations specifying how the money might be spent 
includes projects in virtually every community, including property purchases, 
funds for playground equipment, restrooms and game rooms, and plans to turf 
over asphalt school fields in communities where open space is lacking. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pretty modest request for a pretty important priority," Roberts said. 
"If we delay, all that will happen is that costs will rise and more open space 
will disappear." 
</P>
<P>
A diverse cross-section of business and interest groups has endorsed 
Proposition E, including the Sierra Club, various community councils, the San 
Diego Assn. of Realtors, the Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce and the San 
Diego County Taxpayers' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The limited criticism of the measure has come largely from members of the San 
Diego Libertarian Party, who argue that the city should not be assuming a new 
debt for parks at a time when it cannot afford to hire enough police or meet 
other higher priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Critics also view the proposed creation of a citywide park assessment district 
as a means of circumventing Proposition 13's requirement of a two-thirds public 
vote for approval of new taxes. In addition, they dismiss the "Santa Claus" 
list of recommendations as a disingenuous strategic gambit intended simply to 
attract votes, arguing that it would cost nearly $3 billion to complete all of 
the projects mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same old story of elected officials coming up with new schemes to get 
around Prop. 13," said Libertarian Dick Rider. "Our only hope is that voters 
don't get snookered by this phony shopping list." 
</P>
<P>
The major concern of Proposition E's proponents, meanwhile, is that the more 
than dozen state tax proposals and bond measures on the ballot will leave 
voters in no mood for even a modest local tax increase, particularly in light 
of the uncertain state of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"Our biggest worry is that voters might be so angry that they say 'no' to 
everything," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining growth-related matter on the ballot, Proposition L, would require 
public approval of any City Council plan to sell or exchange 80-acres-plus 
parcels of city property. One exception would be the sale of city land to 
another governmental agency for public use. 
</P>
<P>
Because such sales occur infrequently, the proposal has generated little debate 
and no organized opposition. Even council members, who often view such 
proposals as an infringement of their legislative prerogatives, support the 
proposition, viewing it as protection against ill-advised sales of scarce city 
property. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good check against poor short-range decisions," Roberts said. "If a 
sale is such a good thing, voters will approve it. Sometimes it helps to have 
someone looking over your shoulder."

Kenuel Ogwaro started early as an exterminator. At the age of 4, he was given 
his own termite mound near his village in Uganda and expected to protect it and 
to harvest it for vital foodstuffs for his family. 
</P>
<P>
His termite catch was boiled or dried to produce a dish that tasted like a mix 
of sour cream and peanut butter. 
</P>
<P>
There were snakes and scorpions just as interested in Ogwaro's termite mound 
for a hearty meal as he was. Ogwaro's termite traps -- deep holes lined with 
slippery banana leaves to keep the termites from escaping -- attracted frogs 
interested in a termite feast. And frogs attracted snakes, which dined on 
frogs. And just out of sight awaiting their chance to feed upon the youngsters 
themselves were lions, hyenas and other carnivores. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very, very dangerous growing up. When I was young, I was part of the 
food chain," Ogwaro said, describing the dangers that decimated the children of 
his village. "There were biting ants, and the people of the village were poor 
and did not have pants. We were bitten in very sensitive places." 
</P>
<P>
Mosquitoes were a more serious threat to Ogwaro and his young counterparts. 
With mosquitoes comes malaria, he explained, "and many of us died. I was near 
to death several times." 
</P>
<P>
Ogwaro is still killing termites, though not to eat them. Despite his early 
experiences, or perhaps because of them, the former African child, now a 
resident of Rancho Penasquitos, has become a pioneer in the exterminating 
business, using the knowledge of predator and prey he began learning as a child 
to control pests by balancing nature rather than using chemical pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
Entomologists applaud Ogwaro's methods and call them the coming thing in pest 
control. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a few other firms today who are going in the same direction," said 
Michael Rust, urban entomologist at UC Riverside. "But it is a growing trend. I 
would say that in a few years from now, five or 10 years, there will be many 
others in this field following the same general direction." 
</P>
<P>
Ogwaro's early and informal studies of insects led him to obtain a Ph.D. in 
biology from the University of Nairobi, Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
But when he left the academic realm and began to apply his knowledge, Ogwaro 
realized his educational theories and the real world did not mix. 
</P>
<P>
He had learned and had been taught that natural methods should be used to 
obtain a balance in nature, but chemicals reigned supreme in the pest control 
business and research in the field of entomology was aimed at finding new, more 
deadly and longer-lasting pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
Ogwaro's interests lay in the biological control of insects, the use of 
parasites and predators to control exploding populations of pests, manipulating 
the environment to accommodate the needs of all living creatures. 
</P>
<P>
With chemical companies funding most of the research and awarding grants to 
most of the universities, Ogwaro found himself on the outside, unwanted despite 
his years of study and wealth of expertise. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a decade, Ogwaro worked in pure research at the International 
Center for Insect Physiology and Ecology in Kenya, concentrating on insect 
behavior and the relationships between insects and their host plants. Then he 
struck out for the United States, where he hoped to find a position teaching 
his environmentally oriented brand of pest control, called integrated pest 
management. 
</P>
<P>
Ogwaro investigates the factors causing the pest infestation, modifies the 
environment to control the problem, then monitors the situation to keep the 
problem in check. 
</P>
<P>
After an unsuccessful attempt to obtain a teaching position at UC Davis, he 
decided to go into private practice. Ogwaro, now 47, settled finally in Rancho 
Penasquitos, started his own firm -- Eco-Care -- in 1987 and began recruiting 
San Diegans to his theories of controlling ant, gopher, rat, roach and other 
pest problems. 
</P>
<P>
Affluent Rancho Santa Fe residents are among his best customers, he said, and 
have spread the word about Eco-Care. In recent months, De Anza Group has joined 
his client list, adding the Mission Bay Golf Course, De Anza Mobile Home Park 
and Campland to his purview. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people are happy with my methods because they don't like the idea of 
spraying chemicals in their homes," Ogwaro said. "But then there are others, 
like the lady who told me that she had the man come in every month and spray. 
When I asked her what the man was spraying for, she said: 'Everything.' She was 
so proud, and what could I say to her, that she was doing a bad thing? No, I 
could not." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Cowley, a Rancho Santa Fe resident, is sold on Ogwaro's methods. He has 
been keeping her house and yard free of pests, four-footed and six-legged 
kinds, for more than two years now and she's "very pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard of him through my dog-groomer and I've passed the word about him to my 
friends," Cowley said. "I used to have one of those big companies come in and 
spray, but I'm very much against pesticides. (Ogwaro) only uses poisons as a 
last resort." 
</P>
<P>
Ogwaro pops in periodically at the Cowley estate and checks out the balance of 
nature. Then, if the Cowleys have a special problem, ants or a mouse or gophers 
in the lawn, she calls him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very responsive," she said. "He comes in a day or two and takes care of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
For the first time this year, Ogwaro has taken charge of the Cowleys small 
orchard. "He introduced some insect or other to eat up the aphids and it seems 
to be working very well," Cowley said. 
</P>
<P>
Ogwaro tackles an ant infestation like a detective, seeking to find the source 
of the infestation, the point where the pests enter the home and the bait that 
is luring them out of their natural outside environment. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes his job is as simple as plugging cracks in the baseboard or caulking 
around windows to keep the interlopers out. Sometimes, it requires the 
introduction of parasites or insect diseases to control the ant population. As 
a last resort, he will spray, using pyrethrins -- insecticides produced from 
flowers that lose their toxicity within minutes of application. 
</P>
<P>
He also traps snakes, relocating the friendlier ones where they can maintain 
the balance of nature without interfering in back-yard barbecues. He draws the 
line on rattlesnakes, however. "They are nasty creatures," Ogwaro said, "and I 
kill them." 
</P>
<P>
The entomologist uses his lore of nature's remedies to remove grub worms from 
golf courses and roaches from restaurants. He blames careless plumbers for 
making roaches almost immune to efforts to evict them. 
</P>
<P>
Ogwaro also has a thriving clientele for his gopher-removal service and admits 
to using traps to rid the homeowner of his burrowing interlopers. He is 
considering the use of traps that will leave the gopher unharmed, but has yet 
to find a place where live gophers could be transplanted without cries of 
outrage from the humans who reside nearby. 
</P>
<P>
He frowns on use of poisoned grain in exterminating gophers, saying gophers are 
canny animals that often push the poisoned grain out of their burrows, leaving 
it exposed for birds and other more trusting creatures to consume. 
</P>
<P>
Plumbers "make such big holes for pipes that roaches can get back into places 
where it is almost impossible to reach them, even with chemicals," Ogwaro 
explained. He usually solves the problem by closing up the crawl spaces and 
sealing up the cracks so the the insects have no place to hide. 
</P>
<P>
Ogwaro can walk in a house and, within minutes, trace the pest to its lair 
because he knows what insects eat and where they lay their eggs. Eradicate 
their eating-breeding sources and the problem goes away, Ogwaro contends. 
</P>
<P>
The entomologist shakes his head at American buying habits, pointing to 
coupon-clipping and bulk buying as causes for insect infestations in many 
pantries. His wife, a devoted coupon clipper, ignores him. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't buy anything that you won't use up in three months or less," he 
counsels. "If you keep things around longer, you forget you have bought them 
and they become a place for insects and other pests to breed and feed." Anyone 
who has found weevils in their corn-bread mix would nod in assent. 
</P>
<P>
Ogwaro has been lecturing at homeowners' associations, preaching his policy of 
natural controls to maintain the balance of nature and showing homeowners how 
to do it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Most measures to control pests are simple ones, like proper sanitation 
measures," Ogwaro explained. "People can do it for themselves or they can hire 
me to do it for them." 
</P>
<P>
One prerequisite for Ogwaro's clients is patience. It takes time to strike a 
balance of nature that keeps ants outside the house and aphids out of the 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes two to five years to control a problem completely," Ogwaro admits, 
but hastily adds that the control, with proper monitoring, remains effective -- 
while chemical sprays must be reapplied every seven months. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Cawthon, a San Diego County vector control supervisor, has never met 
Ken Owgaro but she wholeheartedly approves of his methods and his efforts to 
maintain a balance of natural forces. 
</P>
<P>
"We would all like to live in a chemical-free world," Cawthon said. "It is our 
department's goal." 
</P>
<P>
Whether that is a practical solution to all cases of disease and infestation, 
she is not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
Ogwaro can discourage pests by blocking the entry points and by removing the 
food and water sources they seek, but can he reeducate the entire population, 
from producer to consumer? Insects can infest food products at any place from 
the farm to the consumer's cupboard, Cawthon pointed out, and once the pests 
are in residence, "it's a devil of a job to get them out." 
</P>
<P>
County vector controllers deal mainly with pests that carry diseases 
transmittable to humans, such as rats and mosquitoes, and usually use the most 
expeditious methods to attack them, including poisons and chemical sprays. 
</P>
<P>
"There are only eight of us in the department to cover the entire county and 
nearly 2.5 million people," Cawthon said, "but we are trying to get the word 
out about proper storage and sanitation practices, educating homeowners' 
associations, contacting Neighborhood Watch groups. 
</P>
<P>
"And we can use all the help we can get. It sounds like Ken Ogwaro is giving us 
a lot of help." 
</P>
<P>
Herb Field, entomologist and vice president of Lloyd Pest Control, does not 
quarrel with Ogwaro's contention that less is better when it comes to 
chemicals, but he does frown on Ogwaro's contention that pest control companies 
are poisoning more than the pests they are sent after. 
</P>
<P>
Thermal termite eradication, a non-chemical heat treatment, is Lloyd's answer 
to environmentally sensitive termite control, Field said, and other companies 
use freezing or low-voltage electrical applications to treat exposed termite 
nests. 
</P>
<P>
Pest control companies also endorse preventive work to control roof rats -- a 
Southern California scourge -- by trimming thick overhanging trees, screening 
attic openings and removing popular rat habitats such as wood piles and food 
sources, Field said. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Field admits, he has used pesticides on the job and in his own home, "but 
I don't go in and spray everything from top to bottom. I spray a specific spot. 
I've got three kids and I don't want to endanger them or anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Ogwaro, who said that in one year he was hired and fired by 11 pest control 
companies for his heretical methods, admits that Field's chemical methods are 
simpler and quicker. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people want someone to come in and get rid of their problem quickly 
and then leave so they can get on with what they were doing. These people do 
not want me," Ogwaro said. 
</P>
<P>
He will keep to his ways, recommending natural control methods and live mouse 
traps, he said, because "all living things can live together on this earth in 
harmony. My goal is to help that happen."

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: RENT CONTROL LAW TO BE REVIEWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HULSE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mobile home owners in unincorporated areas of Ventura County could expect 
annual rent increases on their spaces to stay at the current 5% ceiling under a 
proposed new rent control ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The current ordinance expires Dec. 15, and on Tuesday the County Board of 
Supervisors will consider a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Except for minor changes, the proposed ordinance is virtually the same as the 
old one. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors have been bombarded with letters from mobile home owners, 
mostly elderly residents, urging them to continue rent control because they 
cannot afford high rent increases. 
</P>
<P>
The rent control ordinance was adopted in 1981. It applies to 24 mobile home 
parks scattered throughout the unincorporated area, with spaces totaling 1,555. 
The average space rental is $185 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Last December the supervisors changed the ordinance to include a provision that 
allows park owners to raise space rent as much as they want when a home changes 
hands. JANE HULSE

<TEXT>
<P>
Oxnard City Council and mayoral candidates will get a chance to present their 
views to both English-speaking and Spanish-speaking voters Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
A three-hour forum, sponsored by the League of Women Voters and a variety of 
local civic groups, will give the public a chance to meet the 12 council 
candidates and six mayoral candidates. 
</P>
<P>
At stake are two council seats and the mayorship. 
</P>
<P>
Because Oxnard is more than 50% Hispanic, the event's sponsors believed that it 
would be appropriate to offer on-the-spot Spanish translation, as well as 
Spanish and English telecasts of the event, said Gloria Postel, a League of 
Women Voters member and coordinator of the forum. 
</P>
<P>
Questions for the forum will be formulated by both the Oxnard Community College 
students and the audience. The forum will be held in the community college's 
Room LA 6 from 7 to 10 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A videotape of the forum has been scheduled, twice in English and twice in 
Spanish, for Oxnard cable subscribers later in the week on Channel 19. JOEL

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTY MAY PROVIDE EMERGENCY RIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County employees who car-pool would be guaranteed a ride home when 
their travel plans are disrupted, if a new policy is approved by the Board of 
Supervisors on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed policy is aimed at encouraging the county's 6,000 employees to 
leave their cars at home and car-pool, van-pool, ride the bus, bicycle or walk 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
A ride home would be guaranteed if the employee had to work overtime 
unexpectedly, had to leave early because of illness or a family emergency, or 
if the car-pool driver was called away from work. 
</P>
<P>
Under the policy, employees might use a county vehicle to drive home or even 
call a taxi if they could not find a ride with another employee. If 1,500 
employees participate in the county's ride-sharing program, no more than 150 
rides home are anticipated, officials said. The cost, including cab fare, would 
be less than $5,000 a year. JANE HULSE

CLUB MARKS 50 YEARS BUT FUTURE IS DIM

<P>
Fifty years of dinner meetings and impromptu speeches were celebrated Saturday 
on the golden anniversary of Ventura's International Training in Communication 
club, formerly known as the International Toastmistress Club. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the happy memories generated as past members gathered, the event was 
sad, too, because of a drastic drop in membership, said Pauline Romero, a 
26-year member. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the group had close to 100 members; it now is down to 12. 
</P>
<P>
The club changed its name in 1985 to make it clear that it is, and always has 
been, open to men and women, although the Ventura club's membership has been 
primarily women. 
</P>
<P>
Romero said competition from International Toastmasters, which now accepts 
woman members, has made inroads into her group's membership. 
</P>
<P>
"But we've held on . . . for 50 years," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the anecdotes Romero related was an incident years ago when the charter 
president of the organization, the late Guidotta Lowe, forgot a news clipping 
at her home in Oxnard. She left the meeting as the entree was being served, 
rushed home, and returned to the Ventura restaurant in time for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
"From then on we called her the 'go-gotta girl' because she got back in time to 
give the topic for the evening," Romero said. GERRY BRAILO SPENCER

<P>
A Fillmore man was in critical condition Sunday after the car in which he was 
riding careened off South Mountain Road, flew 160 feet and plunged down a deep 
embankment. 
</P>
<P>
Adrian Galvan, 18, of Oxnard was driving west, near Balcom Canyon Road, about 
5:30 p.m. Saturday when he overcorrected on a curve and went off the side of 
the road, California Highway Patrol officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The car went through a barbed wire fence and across a field, hit a tree and 
went down the embankment. 
</P>
<P>
Passenger Jeff Asenas, 18, of Fillmore was listed in critical condition with 
head and chest injuries in the intensive care unit of Los Robles Regional 
Medical Center in Thousand Oaks. Galvan had chest injuries and was listed in 
stable condition in the intensive care unit of Santa Paula Memorial Hospital. 
Another passenger, 17-year-old Michelle Alvarez of Moorpark, was treated at the 
Santa Paula hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County firefighters and search and rescue team members spent more than 
three hours freeing Galvan and his two passengers from their 1987 Chevrolet 
Spectrum, said Fire Department dispatcher Paula Aliano. STEPHANIE STASSEL

QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS; 
</P>
<P>
ASSEMBLY: 37TH DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Questionnaires were distributed to candidates this month. Answers have been 
edited to fit the available space. 
</P>
<P>
Family Sick Leave 
</P>
<P>
Q. Gov. Deukmejian recently vetoed legislation that would have granted workers 
as much as four months of unpaid leave every two years to care for sick 
children, spouses and other family members without fear of losing their jobs. 
Do you favor this type of legislation? 
</P>
<P>
Wright: No. It is a decision that should be negotiated between employee and 
employer regardless of the total work force. 
</P>
<P>
Petrie: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner: No. Private-sector matters should be considered on an individual basis 
-- optional and arbitrated, but not legislated. 
</P>
<P>
Teacher Salaries 
</P>
<P>
Q. The Legislature approved a 4.7% cost-of-living raise for school employees, 
and Gov. Deukmejian reduced it to 3%, placing the difference in an account for 
special education programs. Should this money be used for salaries? 
</P>
<P>
Wright: I do not believe so because under Proposition 98, passed by the voters, 
there is to be a reserve set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Petrie: Yes. California must value the critical work of our teachers. 
Compensation has to be at a level that keeps educators in the field and 
enthusiastic in their endeavors. We must pay teachers what they're worth. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner: No. The California education system needs revision, reform and 
competition. All tax-funded pay raises should be put to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Big Green 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 128, the so-called "Big Green" initiative on the November 
ballot, seeks to eliminate ozone-depleting chemicals by the year 2000, phase 
out pesticides known to cause cancer and require that trees be planted in all 
new developments. Do you support this initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Wright: No. First of all, ozone depletion is a worldwide issue. Secondly, 75% 
of cancer is self-induced by smoking/overeating. Of the remaining 25%, only 3% 
is pesticide-related and only from over-exposure, not from residue on food 
stuffs. It would result in higher food costs and water bills. 
</P>
<P>
Petrie: Yes. Big Green forces California to address the pressing environmental 
issues we are saturated with. Although it is complex and rigid, it compels the 
state Legislature and citizens to activate efforts toward environmental 
reverence. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner: No. There would be too much power in an appointed position. Chemicals 
do not deplete ozone. There is a better way to reduce the need and use of 
pesticides and we don't need a statute to plant trees. 
</P>
<P>
Tree-Cutting 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 130 on the November ballot would restrict clear-cutting of 
forests, allow the sale of $710 million in bonds to preserve ancient redwood 
forests and provide $32 million to retrain unemployed loggers. Do you support 
this initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Wright: No. It is too drastic in that it reduces the total timber industry by 
70% and gives government the right to condemn property. 
</P>
<P>
Petrie: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner: No. State bonds almost double the tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
Limited Terms 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 131 on the November ballot, authored by Atty. Gen. John K. Van 
de Kamp and Common Cause, would limit most statewide elected officials to eight 
consecutive years in office, and senators and Assembly members to 12 years. 
Proposition 140, sponsored by Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum, is 
more stringent, limiting lifetime service to eight years in the Senate and six 
in the Assembly. Do you support limiting the number of terms state legislators 
can serve? If yes, how long should the limits be? 
</P>
<P>
Wright: No. Fair reapportionment is necessary to make competitive districts and 
then voters could choose. These two initiatives do more than just limit a 
voter's right to choose. Proposition 131 would put in place taxpayer financing 
of 200 legislative campaigns every two years. Proposition 140, by vesting the 
legislators' pensions, would cause taxpayers to pay for the legislators' 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Petrie: No. I don't agree with mandated terms. It is counterproductive to the 
process of democracy. When the public loses its apathetic demeanor and 
participates in the political process, terms will naturally be limited by the 
actions of the voter. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner: Yes, two terms. Any more would be "write-in" to be selected by voters. 
</P>
<P>
Sales Tax 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 133 on the November ballot would raise state sales and use taxes 
by 0.5% for four years to raise $7.5 billion for drug enforcement and 
treatment, anti-drug education, and prison and jail construction and operation. 
Do you support this initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Wright: No. People don't need any more taxes. There are bond measures 144 and 
147 for prison and jail construction and there is funding in the education 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
Petrie: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner: No. No tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Liquor Tax 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 134 on the November ballot would substantially raise taxes on 
beer, wine and liquor, and dedicate the revenue from the tax hike to programs 
for the treatment of drug and alcohol abuse. Do you support this initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Wright: No. The way the initiative is written, if the projected funds for the 
programs decline, which they are likely to do, the state general fund would 
have to back-fill. 
</P>
<P>
Petrie: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner: No. It does not generate enough revenue to cover the expenses 
projected. 
</P>
<P>
Inmate Laborers 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 139 on the November ballot would allow private companies to hire 
state prison and county jail inmates as laborers. Do you support this 
initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Wright: Yes. It is only fair with the rising cost of incarceration that the 
prisoners pay their costs and make restitution to the victims. 
</P>
<P>
Petrie: No. Prison labor in the work force is an attractive concept. However, I 
am not in support of this particular proposition, as written. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner: No. This is unfair to businesses not hiring inmates and to the local 
labor market. Inmates would get preferential hiring. 
</P>
<P>
Death Penalty 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support capital punishment? If so, do you think it should be imposed 
on those convicted of importing or selling drugs? 
</P>
<P>
Wright: Yes. I support the death penalty and I would support it being imposed 
on drug dealers if they caused the death of one person due to their actions. 
</P>
<P>
Petrie: Yes. No, for drug offenses. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner: Yes. Yes. Drug dealers are accessories and conspirators with drug 
gangs and addicts who die from their products. The best and most inexpensive 
way to eliminate import and sales is to legalize it. 
</P>
<P>
Handgun Controls 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support additional limits on handgun purchase or possession in 
California? 
</P>
<P>
Wright: No. Law-abiding citizens who choose to own guns should not be penalized 
as law-breakers. 
</P>
<P>
Petrie: Yes. I support a 15-day waiting period between the purchase and 
delivery of any firearms. I support education on the use and storage of 
firearms. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner: No. We need the limits on the people who use guns for criminal 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion Rights 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support a woman's right to unrestricted abortions within the first 
three months of pregnancy? 
</P>
<P>
Wright: Not really. The decision should be with the doctor and patient. 
</P>
<P>
Petrie: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner: No. It should be a "licensed" option in case of rape, incest or 
life-threatening risk for the mother. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion Funding 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support government funding of abortions for women who cannot afford 
them? 
</P>
<P>
Wright: No. Government should not pay for what is a private decision. 
</P>
<P>
Petrie: Yes. Choice should apply to all women regardless of position or 
socioeconomic standing. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner: No. 
</P>
<P>
Day-Care Services 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you believe the state should require private employers to subsidize 
day-care services for employees who request them? 
</P>
<P>
Wright: No. Employers should make those decisions without government 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
Petrie: I support the state generating incentives so that private employers 
will consider providing day-care services for employees. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner: No. It should be optional. 
</P>
<P>
War on Drugs 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you believe our present strategy of criminal prosecution, interdiction of 
supplies and imprisonment of users and dealers will ever significantly reduce 
the level of drug use in the United States? If no, what should be done? 
</P>
<P>
Wright: Yes, but it will take a long time without the education of our young 
people to end the demand for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Petrie: Yes, but not in and of themselves. Education and prevention programs 
are needed in addition to increased recreation, after-school activities and 
youth employment opportunities. Strict penalties should be imposed on 
businesses that launder drug money. The export of chemicals used to 
process/produce drugs should be withheld. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner: No. History has proven a defensive war cannot be won. 
</P>
<P>
Drug Decriminalization 
</P>
<P>
Q. Would you consider supporting the decriminalization of drug use? 
</P>
<P>
Wright: No. 
</P>
<P>
Petrie: No, not without explicit qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Oil Exploration 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think the present Mideast crisis justifies opening up additional 
parts of the California coastline to oil exploration? 
</P>
<P>
Wright: I never was opposed to oil exploration as long as it was done with the 
environmental concerns addressed. 
</P>
<P>
Petrie: No. Mass-transit programs and conservation efforts throughout the state 
and country is the approach I would take -- move or transition from a 
consumer-disposable society to a preservation or conservationist policy. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner: No. In my opinion, the Mideast crisis is contrived to raise oil prices 
and shift the source of oil to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Parkland Exchange 
</P>
<P>
Q. Should the National Park Service exchange 50 acres in Cheeseboro Canyon in 
southeastern Ventura County for about 1,100 acres of the neighboring Jordan 
Ranch owned by entertainer Bob Hope, permitting park agencies to buy another 
4,600 acres of Hope's land in the Santa Monica and Santa Susana mountains for 
$10 million? 
</P>
<P>
Wright: Yes. I support this transfer because local government would control the 
development through land use. Ideally, the improved development would generate 
enough taxes to replace the loss to local government of the 4,600 acres taken 
out of private ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Petrie: Yes. This exchange should be given careful and thoughtful 
consideration. A pragmatic posturing would be beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner: No. Government should not buy land, only govern its use. 
</P>
<P>
Mandatory Ride-Sharing 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you favor mandatory ride-sharing in an effort to meet government air 
pollution standards? 
</P>
<P>
Wright: No. I don't feel government has a right to mandate how one should 
change their lifestyle, only to educate the public. Incentives would also be 
good to voluntarily get people out of their cars. 
</P>
<P>
Petrie: No. The state should work with industry to generate appropriate 
incentives toward ride-sharing. Mass transit in the form of light rail, subway 
etc. must become the state's transportation priority. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner: No. It should be optional. 
</P>
<P>
Political Funding 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support full or partial public funding of political campaigns? 
</P>
<P>
Wright: No. I do not support taking badly needed tax dollars for mental health 
and education and using it to campaign for public office. 
</P>
<P>
Petrie: No. I support a mandate which would require media to offer space and 
time to candidates at no cost or substantially reduced rates. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner: No. Funds raised for political campaigns should be put into the 
general fund when campaigns are finished -- not into the incumbents' retirement 
or personal account. 
</P>
<P>
Income Disclosure 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are you willing to publicly release your income tax returns and those of 
your spouse prior to the November election? 
</P>
<P>
Wright: No. The reports now necessary to be made public tell all there is to 
know of my situation while in public office. 
</P>
<P>
Petrie: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Porter Ranch 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support development of the massive Porter Ranch project in the hills 
north of Chatsworth as presently configured? 
</P>
<P>
Wright: Development is land use, the only decision-making left to local 
government without interference from the state. I would hope they would 
carefully scrutinize the plans before approval. Petrie: No. Community and 
economic needs would be better suited if this project were scaled down and 
built in the Simi and Santa Clarita valleys with appropriate infrastructure 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner: No. Massive developments overload public systems, freeways, schools 
and utilities, not to mention the present water shortage. Developments should 
be organized, incremented and built to solve problems, not make them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS;

<P>
ASSEMBLY: 37TH DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Questionnaires were distributed to candidates this month. Answers have been 
edited to fit the available space. 
</P>
<P>
Family Sick Leave 
</P>
<P>
Q. Gov. Deukmejian recently vetoed legislation that would have granted workers 
as much as four months of unpaid leave every two years to care for sick 
children, spouses and other family members without fear of losing their jobs. 
Do you favor this type of legislation? 
</P>
<P>
Wright: No. It is a decision that should be negotiated between employee and 
employer regardless of the total work force. 
</P>
<P>
Petrie: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner: No. Private-sector matters should be considered on an individual basis 
-- optional and arbitrated, but not legislated. 
</P>
<P>
Teacher Salaries 
</P>
<P>
Q. The Legislature approved a 4.7% cost-of-living raise for school employees, 
and Gov. Deukmejian reduced it to 3%, placing the difference in an account for 
special education programs. Should this money be used for salaries? 
</P>
<P>
Wright: I do not believe so because under Proposition 98, passed by the voters, 
there is to be a reserve set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Petrie: Yes. California must value the critical work of our teachers. 
Compensation has to be at a level that keeps educators in the field and 
enthusiastic in their endeavors. We must pay teachers what they're worth. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner: No. The California education system needs revision, reform and 
competition. All tax-funded pay raises should be put to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Big Green 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 128, the so-called "Big Green" initiative on the November 
ballot, seeks to eliminate ozone-depleting chemicals by the year 2000, phase 
out pesticides known to cause cancer and require that trees be planted in all 
new developments. Do you support this initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Wright: No. First of all, ozone depletion is a worldwide issue. Secondly, 75% 
of cancer is self-induced by smoking/overeating. Of the remaining 25%, only 3% 
is pesticide-related and only from over-exposure, not from residue on food 
stuffs. It would result in higher food costs and water bills. 
</P>
<P>
Petrie: Yes. Big Green forces California to address the pressing environmental 
issues we are saturated with. Although it is complex and rigid, it compels the 
state Legislature and citizens to activate efforts toward environmental 
reverence. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner: No. There would be too much power in an appointed position. Chemicals 
do not deplete ozone. There is a better way to reduce the need and use of 
pesticides and we don't need a statute to plant trees. 
</P>
<P>
Tree-Cutting 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 130 on the November ballot would restrict clear-cutting of 
forests, allow the sale of $710 million in bonds to preserve ancient redwood 
forests and provide $32 million to retrain unemployed loggers. Do you support 
this initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Wright: No. It is too drastic in that it reduces the total timber industry by 
70% and gives government the right to condemn property. 
</P>
<P>
Petrie: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner: No. State bonds almost double the tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
Limited Terms 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 131 on the November ballot, authored by Atty. Gen. John K. Van 
de Kamp and Common Cause, would limit most statewide elected officials to eight 
consecutive years in office, and senators and Assembly members to 12 years. 
Proposition 140, sponsored by Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum, is 
more stringent, limiting lifetime service to eight years in the Senate and six 
in the Assembly. Do you support limiting the number of terms state legislators 
can serve? If yes, how long should the limits be? 
</P>
<P>
Wright: No. Fair reapportionment is necessary to make competitive districts and 
then voters could choose. These two initiatives do more than just limit a 
voter's right to choose. Proposition 131 would put in place taxpayer financing 
of 200 legislative campaigns every two years. Proposition 140, by vesting the 
legislators' pensions, would cause taxpayers to pay for the legislators' 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Petrie: No. I don't agree with mandated terms. It is counterproductive to the 
process of democracy. When the public loses its apathetic demeanor and 
participates in the political process, terms will naturally be limited by the 
actions of the voter. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner: Yes, two terms. Any more would be "write-in" to be selected by voters. 
</P>
<P>
Sales Tax 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 133 on the November ballot would raise state sales and use taxes 
by 0.5% for four years to raise $7.5 billion for drug enforcement and 
treatment, anti-drug education, and prison and jail construction and operation. 
Do you support this initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Wright: No. People don't need any more taxes. There are bond measures 144 and 
147 for prison and jail construction and there is funding in the education 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
Petrie: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Spooner: No. No tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Liquor Tax 
</P>
<P>
Q. Proposition 134 on the November ballot would substantially raise taxes on 
beer, wine and liquor, and dedicate the revenue from the tax hike to programs 
for the treatment of drug and alcohol abuse. Do you support this initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Wright: No. The way the initiative is written, if the projected funds for the

on drug dealers if they caused the death of one person due to their actions.

gangs and addicts who die from their products. The best and most inexpensive

<P>
Q. Do you support additional limits on handgun purchase or possession in 
California? 
</P>

as law-breakers. 
</P>
<P>

supplies and imprisonment of users and dealers will ever significantly reduce 
the level of drug use in the United States? If no, what should be done?

ROOF CAVES IN, BURNING 2 FIREFIGHTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Los Angeles County firefighters received first- and second-degree burns 
when the roof fell in as they battled a blaze that destroyed a house in Santa 
Clarita early Sunday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Joe Romero received second-degree burns when the falling debris knocked 
off his air mask and dropped hot embers under a protective hood covering his 
neck, Capt. Dennis Adkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Romero and firefighter John Hannah, who also was burned on the neck, were 
treated at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
No one was in the house in the 27000 block of Pine Hills Avenue when the fire 
broke out about 12:12 a.m. The cause was under investigation. Damage to the 
house and contents was estimated at $350,000.

regulation and one from Vince Bianchi in overtime for a 2-2 West Coast 
Conference tie with visiting St. Mary's College (9-8-3, 2-1-1). Toby Taitano, 
Lee Ronces and Philip Burton each had assists for USD. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis McAlister recorded his eighth shutout and host San Diego State beat 
Santa Clara, 1-0, in a nonconference match. SDSU's Brian Craft-Negrete scored 
in the 61st minute off an assist from Jeff Wale. SDSU is 11-6-2. Santa Clara, 
ranked No. 1 in the nation earlier in the year, is 11-3-3.

BIATHLON 
</P>
<P>
Brent Steiner of Tempe, Ariz., won his fifth race in the 1990 Coors Light 
Biathlon Series, covering the San Diego course in 1 hour 7 minutes 42 seconds. 
The lower times were due to a shorter bike course than the standard 30 
kilometers. This was the final race before the series championship Nov. 11 in 
Phoenix. Joel Thompson of Encinitas was third in 1:09.44 and Oceanside's John 
Groulx was fourth in 1:09.59. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Grand of Plymouth, N.H., won the women's race in 1:18:05. Leucadia's 
Colleen Gallagher finished sixth in 1:22.55 and Del Mar's Nancy Thomas was 
ninth in 1:24.41.

<P>
Anaheim's Gordon Jennings, Jr. scored 800 points in his superstocks flat-bottom 
runabout to win the 16th Gordon Jennings Memorial Regatta off Mission Bay. 
Jennings defeated Mike Anderson by 200 points. Among the other winners was San 
Diego's Jon Church, who won the formula cobra/inboard hydroplane race, 
defeating El Cajon's Scott Del Nero and Kevin Aylesworth.

B+ QUARTERBACKS 
</P>
<P>
All those who booed Billy Joe Tolliver may apologize by contacting Stella, the 
Chargers' receptionist, at 280-2111. No collect calls, please. 
</P>
<P>
B RUNNING BACKS 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver on Marion Butts: "He'll give you religion in a hurry if you're trying 
to tackle him." Amen. Rod Bernstine brings Bucs to their knees. 
</P>
<P>
C- RECEIVERS 
</P>
<P>
Instead of dressing as a ghost for Halloween, youngsters may want to go as 
Charger wide receivers. Same difference. Only Anthony Miller stands out. 
</P>
<P>
B- OFFENSIVE LINE 
</P>
<P>
Who are these guys? No sacks. Four rushing touchdowns. What's next? It's like 
waking up to discover Rosanne Barr has been selected Miss America. 
</P>
<P>
A DEFENSIVE LINE 
</P>
<P>
Lee Williams drops Howard Hughes imitation and breaks out of hiding to get 
first solo sack since Cleveland. Burt Grossman has 17 sacks in last 17 games. 
</P>
<P>
A LINEBACKERS 
</P>
<P>
Asking Gary (the plowhorse) Plummer to cover Gary Anderson is like asking 
Buster Douglas not to eat. Fat chance, but then check out the final stats. 
</P>
<P>
B- DEFENSIVE BACKS 
</P>
<P>
All-out blitz backfires, but stats have Chargers tied for NFL lead with 14 
interceptions. After the Reds swept the A's, you knew anything was possible. 
</P>
<P>
A SPECIAL TEAMS 
</P>
<P>
Chargers make mulligan count in re-signing John (never a doubt) Carney. Kickoff 
unit limits Bucs to average return of 10.8 yards a try. Why bother? 
</P>
<P>
A COACHING 
</P>
<P>
All those who were asking for Dan Henning's firing may apologize by contacting 
Stella, the Chargers' receptionist, at 280-2111.

SHOOTING STARS: LINE MAKING SOME PROGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PATTERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forget about the Charger offensive linemen being big, strong and steadily 
getting steadier. 
</P>
<P>
Tight end Rod Bernstine likes them because they can play hoops. 
</P>
<P>
"In years past we didn't have a lot of athletic ability there," he said. "Now 
we have guys who can go out in the gym and play basketball. So they're young, 
but they're talented. If they stay together and stay healthy they're going to 
be great." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a sackless afternoon in Sunday's 41-10 victory over the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium is evidence that this line can help 
make things happen. But basketball? Are these guys good enough to compete with 
those of you at the skill positions? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, they've got a ways to go," Bernstine said, smiling, "but I'm just saying 
that they're not big, fat linemen. They can go out and shoot baskets and enjoy 
life." 
</P>
<P>
And in the meantime, players such as Bernstine, Billy Joe Tolliver and Marion 
Butts can enjoy the games more, knowing they're not going to get clobbered 
every time they get to the line of scrimmage. There was speculation early in 
the season that playing behind this offensive line could land a guy in the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dan Henning opted to do a bit of reconstruction six days before the start 
of the regular season. "During training camp, we just couldn't figure out what 
to do at that the left guard position," Henning said. "After the Raider game, I 
sat down with (offensive line coach) Alex (Gibbs) and looked at the film, and 
we talked about it and he said it would be a tough decision to make. And I 
said: 'Make it.' " 
</P>
<P>
A day later, guard Dennis McKnight, a Charger for eight seasons, was waived 
along with Larry Williams, his backup. Rookie Frank Cornish was moved to the 
starting center position and Courtney Hall was switched to left guard. 
</P>
<P>
And, sure, a lot of people thought Henning was nuts. The move even surprised 
some of the remaining linemen. 
</P>
<P>
"I questioned it, of course," tackle Broderick Thompson said. "We gave up some 
experienced players. I can say that a couple of those losses could have changed 
with that experience in there. You know it's a gamble that they took." 
</P>
<P>
The eight remaining games will determine whether it was a jackpot or a long day 
at the craps table. Up to now, the Chargers (3-5) have been inconsistent and so 
has the offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday was a step in the right direction. Consider the hole Bernstine ran 
through in the fourth quarter en route to a 20-yard touchdown. And the 
statistics sheet show that the Chargers have given up 11 sacks in eight games 
to 19 through eight last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're seeing some fruits of (the) decision, but it's been a little 
struggle here and there," Henning said. "We still have to get over the hump. 
When we get behind . . . we have to have that protection." 
</P>
<P>
These days, Tolliver is full of praise for the men up front. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yeah, they do a good job for us," he said. "Those guys are playing with a 
lot of confidence now." 
</P>
<P>
Which has helped Butts rush for 654 yards in 145 carries. And he's happy to 
give away plenty of the credit. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it can be attributed to the offensive line," Butts said. "I mean, you 
stick me in front of 11 guys and what can I do? Without the offensive line I 
couldn't get a yard. You'd be a fool to take on 11 guys by yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Those who score touchdowns are quick to express their appreciation for blocking 
services rendered. 
</P>
<P>
"We never force a fumble," guard David Richards said, "we never make a sack. 
But what we do is give Butts and Bernstine, Billy Joe and Anthony Miller the 
opportunity to get to the end zone. They know we made it possible and that's 
what's important."

BERNSTINE BEATS BUTTS TO THE PUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Running back Marion Butts was caught with his helmet down. 
</P>
<P>
Butts had just scored his third touchdown of the game and had gone to the 
sideline to take a breather as the Chargers kicked off. Tampa Bay's Danny 
Pebbles, however, fumbled the kickoff and the Chargers recovered. 
</P>
<P>
"The coach said, 'regular,' and he (Rod Bernstine) took off," said Butts. "I 
said, 'hold it,' but he said, 'oh, no,' and gave me a stiff arm. He beat me to 
the field. I would have had him, but I had to put on my helmet and he had his 
on." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers took possession of the ball at the Bucs' seven-yard line and 
handed the ball to Bernstine five carries in a row. 
</P>
<P>
He appeared to have scored his second touchdown of the day on his third carry, 
but the Chargers were penalized for illegal motion. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a race onto the field," said Butts, "and he beat me to it. I was just 
unsuccessful as you might say." 
</P>
<P>
The last time Butts scored three touchdowns in a game was at Worth County High 
School in Sylvester, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
At Florida State, where he was used primarily as a blocking back, he was lucky 
to carry the ball three times a game. "I was lucky to get one sometimes," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Gill Byrd tied and then went past former cornerback Dick Harris to 
become the Chargers' all-time interception leader with 30. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought I'd be here a year let alone eight years," said Byrd, "and 
then let alone get this record. I'm just excited about it." 
</P>
<P>
Byrd has yet to earn Pro Bowl recognition, but in his last 40 games, he has 19 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a marvelous player," defensive coordinator Ron Lynn said. "The guy just 
keeps making plays week after week. He plays hurt, he plays with all kinds of 
other things going on, and yet he's a professional in every sense of the word 
and is able to get himself ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
Placekicker John Carney has eight successful field goals in a row, but for the 
first time in three weeks failed to chip a ball off the upright. 
</P>
<P>
"I must be getting better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to another episode of "As the Pendulum Swings." 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers embarrass the Chargers and then the Chargers humiliate the Jets. 
The Raiders thump the Chargers and then the Chargers destroy the Bucs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're like that program, 'Unsolved Mysterys,' " linebacker Gary Plummer said. 
"I wish I knew what it took to get us going like we did against the Jets and 
Tampa Bay. If I knew, I'd be coach of the year." 
</P>
<P>
As the pendulum swings, oh, no . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in my heart we can win two in a row," guard David Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
In their quest to win two in a row for the first time this season, the Chargers 
travel to Seattle, where they haven't won since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end Burt Grossman was asked if he thought Coach Dan Henning might 
have fabricated the story that had Tampa Bay Coach Ray Perkins guaranteeing a 
victory for the Bucs. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know," he said. "We never heard the tape." 
</P>
<P>
Defensive lineman Lee Williams, who led the AFC in sacks with 14 a year ago, 
has had one-half sack in the team's previous four games. But in the third 
quarter, Williams broke free and slammed Chandler to the ground for a 12-yard 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who has been moved from end to tackle, now has 4 1/2 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
"It took a hell of a lot off my mind," Williams said. "I had never been through 
a drought like that. It was almost as important as my first one; it's been that 
long." 
</P>
<P>
Grossman leads the Chargers with eight sacks, followed by Leslie O'Neal's 6 
1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Billy Ray Smith and tackle Joel Patten returned to the active roster 
and made cameo appearances against the Bucs. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm starting over and I played like it," said Patten, who has been 
sidelined with a knee injury. "It was good to get into a game and get some 
playing time, but for me, practice time is more important than game time. I was 
just trying to chip the rust off." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who is coming off strained stomach muscles, said, "I only played on PATs 
and field goals, but it felt good to get back on the field. I feel I'm ready to 
play defense and get back in the lineup, but we have some defensive guys 
playing well, who are already in there." 
</P>
<P>
Memorial services for former Charger General Manager John Sanders have been 
moved. They will be at the College Avenue Baptist Church, 4744 College Avenue 
today at 11 a.m. Sanders, who was instrumental in the rise of the Chargers from 
1975-1987, died Friday.

CHILLING GROUND OF 'SECRET RAPTURE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rapture seems an unlikely term with which to associate the majority of the 
venal, weak, self-centered characters in David Hare's "The Secret Rapture" at 
South Coast Repertory. The word is not used in the scuba diving sense, as in 
rapture of the deep, although spiritual euphoria is part of the mystery Hare 
attempts to evoke. As he explains it, "The 'secret rapture' is that moment at 
which a nun expects to be united with Christ. In other words, it's death." 
</P>
<P>
If that sends a shiver through you, it should. A kind of chill stalks "The 
Secret Rapture" from the moment light slices through blackout as a woman 
nervously opens a door and is startled to find her sister sitting in the dark 
room. Their father has died; his body is on the bed. Lives will be changed, not 
by the event of death, which is only a trigger, but by the forces of 
interpersonal and public politics that will rush in to fill the void. 
</P>
<P>
Hare has not made a secret of his fascination with how larger societal forces 
shape our private ends. He tackled that notion in "Plenty," a psychological 
dissection of post-World War II England seen through the collapse of one woman. 
In "Rapture," he has taken the fallout of Thatcherism and created an unlikely 
morality play through the secular canonization of another. 
</P>
<P>
Of the sisters mentioned earlier, Marion (Bairbre Dowling) is a junior minister 
in a hidebound conservative government while Isobel (Caroline Goodall) is an 
artist. They have only one thing in common: their late father's widow, 
Katherine (Libby Boone), a much younger woman, alcoholic and incapable of 
coping responsibly. She becomes their unequally shared responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Isobel loves, lives and works with Irwin (Simon Templeman), another artist with 
whom she ekes out a contented living. She is interior, tender, idealistic. 
Marion is exterior, self-righteous and, by her own eventual admission, 
incapable of feeling ("I don't have the right equipment"). She is married to 
Tom (Hal Landon Jr.), a born milquetoast and born-again Baptist who heads 
something called Christians in Business. 
</P>
<P>
The road to destruction is subtle, even if Hare's play isn't always. First 
Marion allows Katherine to inflict herself on Isobel. Later Marion and Tom in a 
"Christian" desire to "help," bedevil Isobel's and Irwin's life with 
self-serving temptations that alter chemistries and wreak ultimate chaos. 
</P>
<P>
The play, which achieves this with uneven success, ends with a tortured 
epiphany that won't bear repeating. "Secret Rapture" is not about plot or 
cause, but about effect. It's about the malice of weakness and the 
powerlessness of strength. It's about currents and resistance, humanity and 
honor. In short, it is dangerous, difficult stuff. After such plays as 
"Speed-the-Plow," "Serious Money," "Glengarry Glen Ross," "Palladium Is Moving" 
and even "Other People's Money," "The Secret Rapture" is, as Hare himself 
recognizes, an attempt "to buck the trend. Unfashionably," says he, "I have a 
heroine." 
</P>
<P>
And then some. Under David Emmes' spare and precise direction, the production 
at SCR is a part of Orange County's ongoing Festival of Britain. The design 
team and the cast are a hands-across-the-sea mixer, with the excellent Goodall 
and Templeman hailing from England, along with set designer Robert Jones, whose 
supply of ever-changing, meticulously detailed locales would seem to defy the 
logistics of storage and wing space. 
</P>
<P>
Boone is a vibrant manic-depressive as Katherine, and Dowling's Marion is 
shrill and obnoxious enough in her tailored suits to conjure up the inevitable 
associations. Elizabeth Dennehy provides some entertaining man-eating moments 
as her shallow assistant Rhonda, while Landon's apologetic piety and limpness 
seem a loaded act of perpetual self-erasure. But the play pivots around the 
complex Isobel and, only because he is so inextricably the instrument of her 
fate, around Irwin. Templeman manages to embody weakness with plenty of 
presence, while Goodall's generous and inviting Isobel thoroughly eludes 
self-pity. 
</P>
<P>
This is a play destined to arouse polemics, but it is curious to recall that it 
did so earlier this year for the wrong reasons, when Hare challenged New York 
Times critic Frank Rich to a duel of words after Rich reacted negatively to the 
New York production Hare had directed. Rich declined, but the furor persisted 
-- unfortunately so. The play deserves to be talked about not for its Rich 
review, but for the richness of its content.

Nudes Unveiled: Officials have relented and have allowed the removal of fig 
leaves covering three nude figurines displayed at Dallas City Hall after the 
artist accused the city of censorship. Last Monday, park officials ordered the 
"Getting Better Ain't Always Easy" exhibit by Lubbock artist Future Atkins 
covered, fearing the 7 1/2-inch pieces would offend visitors. By Thursday, they 
had changed their minds and removed the makeshift leaves. CLAUDIA PUIG

It's Only Rock 'n' Roll: Saying there's no evidence rock music leads youngsters 
to sex and drugs, New York Education Commissioner Thomas Sobol on Friday 
rejected a parent's plea to remove rock posters from a junior high school 
classroom. Sobol said the parent who brought the complaint failed to show that 
any of the students who use Room 109 have been adversely affected. CLAUDIA PUIG

Paulmania: Paul McCartney won't wait another 13 years to return to the road, as 
he did before his 1989-90 tour. 
</P>
<P>
The one-time "cute Beatle" is already making plans for an international stadium 
tour beginning in late 1991, and possibly some smaller club shows before then. 
"There are plenty of small places we can go without having to have the 
organization we had last time," McCartney said in a statement released through 
Capitol Records. "There are many exciting little gigs, and I'm into that, 
really, just to keep our hands in." A live album from the recent tour is due

RHAPSODY IN TAPS PERFORMS HINES WORK AT JAPAN AMERICA; 
</P>
<P>
DANCE: ENERGY, GOOD HUMOR AND ENSEMBLE SKILL FAIL TO SUSTAIN AN EVENING-LENGTH 
SHOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite bountiful energy, sunny good humor and well-honed ensemble skills, 
Rhapsody in Taps really doesn't have the resources to sustain an evening-long 
program like the one they offered Friday night at the Japan America Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe something's amiss with the concept of an all-woman tap company, which 
can't indulge in the theatrically effective gambit of teasing byplay between 
the sexes. Maybe tap just wasn't meant to be performed by bodies that aren't 
all small-boned and whippet-lithe. Or maybe the company's lack of riveting 
personalities and virtuoso-level body control is to blame. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, it was a long haul until the highlight of the evening, "Toeing the 
3rd and Fifth," a new piece set on the company by tap star Gregory Hines to 
music by Clayton Cameron. 
</P>
<P>
From the opening moments, with the five dancers profiled in swooping side bends 
that fluttered up into a series of little jumps, Hines' stress on forceful 
dynamic contrasts was evident. 
</P>
<P>
Crisp turns and statue-like, off-balance poses punctuated crisp volleys of 
taps. Breezy unison movements suddenly stopped cold; brief solos evoked snappy 
comebacks from the other dancers. As in other program offerings, however, only 
company artistic Linda Sohl-Donnell mustered the requisite economy of movement 
and self-possessed stylishness. 
</P>
<P>
Her Los Angeles premiere, "Raindance," to music by Al (Tootie) Heath, was 
embroidered with a quasi-African theme. Dancers in midriff-revealing tops and 
harem pants squatted in wide-legged poses, swung their hips chastely and toted 
a couple of poles filled with pebbles. 
</P>
<P>
This touch of sensuality was most welcome -- as was the aural contrast of 
churning pebbles, primitive percussion instruments and tapping -- but the piece 
meandered and the venture into earthiness needed lots more soul. 
</P>
<P>
The only other moments of note occured in "Piru Bole" -- a flavorful rhythmic 
conversation between tabla player M. B. Gordy and Sohl-Donnell's taps, 
evocative of Indian kathak dance -- and "Eddie's Suite," an occasion for 
indefatigable old-timer Eddie Brown to do his deceptively careless thing with 
feet that barely moved off the stage floor.

COUNTERPUNCH: A ONCE-BANNED AUTHOR BELIEVES IN CENSORSHIP FOR THE GOOD OF 
SOCIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRADLEY STEFFENS, Steffens, who lives in the San Diego area, is the author 
of six juvenile nonfiction books, including The Printing Press. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No newspaper in the country would print the unexpurgated lyrics to "As Nasty as 
They Wanna Be" any more than it would have printed the transcripts of the 
Watergate tapes without the expletives deleted. Why not? Because children 18 
and younger enjoy ready access to the daily paper. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, we adults choose to restrict what they find there. To those of us 
who support this choice, it is not anti-democratic, totalitarian or fascist. 
It's part of life in an open society. We take it in stride. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, I was not unduly upset when my book, "The San Francisco Earthquake," 
was banned from my children's elementary school simply because it contained the 
word brothel in its description of the old Barbary Coast district. I disagreed 
with what the librarian chose to censor, but not with her right to do so. I 
believe my own son and daughter are equipped to handle the word in context, but 
I also know that they are not prepared to handle the material in, say, Screw 
magazine. I appreciate the librarian's effort to maintain a collection 
appropriate for the age group she serves. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors in Florida who convicted the Ft. Lauderdale record store owner of 
obscenity have chosen to restrict which records are available not only to 
children but also to adults. 
</P>
<P>
I have not seen the transcript from that 2 Live Crew case. I do not know what 
instructions the jurors received from the judge. But I have a strong hunch 
about the motives of the Florida jurors who voted guilty. Whether they stated 
it explicitly or not, they were probably acting on behalf of their community's 
children, who form, after all, the primary market for the 2 Live Crew album. 
One of the first arrests involving the 2 Live Crew album was of a 19-year-old 
who sold "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" to an 11-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
The decision of the Florida jurors may not have been good law, but neither was 
it the act of political terrorism that anti-censorship activists make it out to 
be. Even if the jurors were acting to protect the adults of their community, 
they were not out of line. Ours is not a society without limits. We are free to 
restrict the sale of published material. We do so routinely, though you could 
hardly tell from the rhetoric of the anti-censorship activists. 
</P>
<P>
In article after article, leaders of the anti-censorship movement rely on scare 
tactics to incite a mindless indignation about the supposed threat posed by 
community censors. Almost without fail, the anti-censorship activists employ 
the hoariest propaganda technique of all, the "slippery slope" argument, to 
further their cause. The argument usually goes something like this: "If we 
allow the censorship of 2 Live Crew today, the next thing you know the censors 
will limit the expression of Madonna, then Springsteen, then Paul Simon, and, 
eventually, all of us! The absurdity of this notion deserves a response. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, the reasoning is illogical. Action taken in one instance does not 
predetermine action to be taken in another. The censorship of 2 Live Crew will 
not lead directly and inevitably to the censorship of Paul Simon or anyone 
else. To suggest that it will is deception, pure and simple. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the argument is historical nonsense. Never has a government established 
totalitarian control over the press incrementally, beginning with sexually 
explicit material and proceeding to the daily press. If a government wants to 
end the freedom of the press it starts with the newspapers and goes from there. 
Artists and pornographers hate to admit this, however, probably because it 
makes them look less important than they believe they are. 
</P>
<P>
What is worst about the slippery slope argument in this case is the implied 
message it gives to us as a people. It suggests that we are somehow very, very 
close to losing our most basic human rights. It implies that the only thing 
keeping us from losing our freedom is the diligence of our self-appointed 
protectors. 
</P>
<P>
To believe this line of thinking, one must accept the notion that some sinister 
force is poised to wrest our freedom from us. What is this force? Who is behind 
it? 
</P>
<P>
Judging from the Florida case, it must be we ourselves, of course, the American 
people, working through our legislators, our courts, our judges and jurors. We 
who have children to protect. We who have fought and died for our country. We 
whose ancestors suffered all kinds of hardship just to come this land. We want 
to strip ourselves of our own freedom! 
</P>
<P>
This idea -- which is the foundation of the anti-censorship movement -- is a 
lie. Those who promote it should be ashamed. Those who hear it should reject it 
without guilt and without fear. We are a good people, a fair people. We are not 
absurdly self-destructive. We must not believe otherwise.

AFRICAN POP BY THE FOUR STARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's hard to imagine the cooperative approach of the Quatre Etoiles (Four 
Stars) in the competitive context of the American pop world. At the Music 
Machine on Saturday, not only did the Four Stars perform a hit song by Kass 
Kass, a side venture of two of its members, but the group also backed singer 
Sam Mangwana in his local debut. 
</P>
<P>
When these Paris-based Zairians are clicking, there isn't a superior band in 
soukous -- the lilting music that's the most popular of African styles -- but 
the group's two 45-minute Music Machine sets suffered from lack of focus. 
</P>
<P>
In part that's because the group expanded on soukous' characteristic 
combination of crystalline guitar lines and gentle rhythm grooves, injecting 
such Western pop touches as riff melodies and gospel chord changes. The opening 
instrumentals were shaky, but the intensity level took a measurable leap when 
the high, bittersweet lead vocals of Nyboma and the muscular, mid-range 
harmonizing of Jean Papy Ramazani joined the instrumental mix. 
</P>
<P>
But only at first. The Four Stars never managed to sustain the momentum they 
sporadically generated throughout the performance. Mangwana took over the lead 
vocals for the second set, but he couldn't break the hit-and-miss pattern. A 
two-song salvo fired by a stirring Syran M'benza guitar solo was typical. 
</P>
<P>
M'benza's reticence was another problem, even if his clear, piercing tone did 
split the difference between Zaire and the Ventures on one tune (African surf 
music?). M'benza is a brilliant lead guitarist, one of the handful on the pop 
scene seemingly capable of spinning off inventive variations for hours on end. 
But he stepped up front far too infrequently Saturday. DON SNOWDEN

PULNOC MAKES L.A. DEBUT AT AL'S BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ROSENBLUTH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In their original incarnation as the Plastic People of the Universe, members of 
the Czechoslovakian band Pulnoc spent years in jail throughout the '70s and 
'80s for allegedly disturbing the peace with their rock around the Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
That atmosphere of repression has clearly shaped their music. 
</P>
<P>
At the band's Los Angeles debut on Saturday at Al's Bar, Pulnoc evinced a 
free-form, angry sound that challenged convention with every note. More often 
than not tuneless and occasionally atonal as well -- and sung in the group's 
native tongue -- the music nonetheless was insistently appealing, authentic and 
powerful. 
</P>
<P>
Pulnoc (pronounced POOL-notes) makes no bones about its influences: the Velvet 
Underground, Lou Reed and more Velvet Underground. The sincerity of its "Sweet 
Jane," which seraphic lead singer Michaela Nemcova gallantly sang in clipped 
English, put the Cowboy Junkies' to shame. Pulnoc's own "Song for Nico" didn't 
fare quite so well, however; the long, lugubrious jam indulged the worst 
tendencies of art rock. 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, this was not Pulnoc at its best. The band, which is on its 
second U.S. mini-tour, played on despite a persistent squeal from the equipment 
that lasted for the first third of the show. In addition, the group was limited 
to a one-hour set with no encore, to accommodate the other two bands on the 
bill. JEAN ROSENBLUTH

'INSANITY' RECALLS GARFIELD ASSASSINATION TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Insanity on Trial," an "American Experience" segment airing tonight at 9 on 
Channels 28 and 15, is a problematic mix of documentary and "dramatization." 
The documentary portion maintains the high level of quality we've come to 
expect from this fine PBS series, the dramatization portion less so. 
</P>
<P>
"Insanity on Trial" is about the trial of Charles Guiteau, who fatally shot 
President James Garfield in 1881. His trial was a 19th-Century media circus -- 
every event was chronicled, every minute statement reported and dissected. 
</P>
<P>
It was an important trial, well worth remembering today, because of its battle 
over the legal definition of insanity. Guiteau claimed that the idea to 
assassinate Garfield came from God; his lawyer argued that he could not be held 
legally accountable because he didn't have criminal intent. The argument is 
still reverberating in courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Producer-director-writer Matthew Collins touches on all the great issues of the 
day -- political, religious, medical, legal -- in an America braced against the 
first winds of the modern age. But he fails to examine most of them seriously, 
in great part because he squanders so much of this hourlong effort on the 
dramatic re-creations. The scenes -- based on court transcripts, letters and 
first-hand accounts -- are accurate but are ultimately shallow and distracting. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, "Insanity on Trial" is a frustrating show. If you believe that 
half a loaf is better than no loaf, it's worth a look. If you don't, there's 
always the next "American Experience" to look forward too. MARTIN ZIMMERMAN

EX-CON TELLS OF DEA AGENTS' DRUG DEALS; 
</P>
<P>
CORRUPTION: TRAFFICKER TESTIFIES ABOUT PAYING AGENTS FOR COCAINE STOLEN FROM 
AGENCY'S EVIDENCE VAULT. TWO MEN HAVE PLEADED GUILTY, WHILE A THIRD AWAITS 
TRIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Bunny" is a heavy-set, street-savvy New Yorker who knows his way around 
Brooklyn. He has made and lost fortunes trafficking in cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
A 60-year-old ex-convict with a criminal record going back four decades, Bunny 
knows people on both sides of the law. So, when he was convicted eight years 
ago on drug trafficking charges, he went to work with the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration in an undercover role to avoid a long prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
That was how he first met DEA agent John Jackson, the drug dealer recalled. 
Together, they helped convict a reputed Mafia boss and seven others. By then, 
Mahlon Joseph Steward -- known as Bunny to his associates -- had become close 
friends with Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Their friendship, prosecutors now contend, led to the biggest corruption 
scandal in the DEA's 17-year history. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, Bunny surfaced as a key witness against Jackson and two other 
former DEA agents, all who worked in the agency's downtown Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
Although a federal trial is not scheduled to begin until next month in Los 
Angeles, Steward was ordered to begin his testimony Aug. 1 because the 
government feared that he might die before the trial began. Less than a week 
after appearing before a federal grand jury on Jan. 27, 1988, Steward suffered 
a massive heart attack that resulted in quintuple bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
During his five days of videotaped testimony, which only recently became 
available, Steward recounted how he trafficked for three years in cocaine and 
heroin supplied to him by two of the three DEA agents. 
</P>
<P>
He said he mailed the federal agents more than $1 million in drug profits -- 
some of it shipped directly to the DEA's Los Angeles headquarters in the World 
Trade Center. 
</P>
<P>
Steward also recounted how he and the agents became such close friends that 
they vacationed together in Hawaii with their wives and dined and 
window-shopped in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Steward testified that some of the cocaine that Jackson supplied him was stolen 
in 1984 from the DEA's evidence vault. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that much of the drug profits the men made were generated by the 
theft in 1985 of more than 150 kilograms of cocaine from a drug hide-out in 
Pasadena, which the government called "The Big Rip." That theft accounted for 
$1 million in profits, Steward said. 
</P>
<P>
Steward, an unindicted co-conspirator, agreed last year to become a prosecution 
witness. After the agreement, he returned to New York, where he pleaded guilty 
to violating terms of his probation, which grew out of a 1982 heroin 
trafficking conviction. He hopes his testimony will win him a sentence 
reduction. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning from Assistant U.S. Atty. Joyce Karlin, Steward said Jackson 
told him he waited until the timing was right before taking the cocaine from 
the stash house. The agents got two-thirds of the drug profits, Steward said, 
and he got the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that the enormous drug profits financed a luxurious 
lifestyle for Jackson, 41, of Claremont, and the two other former DEA agents, 
Darnell Garcia, 43, of Rancho Palos Verdes, and Wayne Countryman, 47, of 
Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
The government contends that Jackson and Garcia used the profits to buy 
expensive homes and to open multimillion-dollar bank accounts in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson and Countryman have pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges, but 
Garcia -- a bespectacled, black-belt karate expert -- has chosen to fight the 
indictment. His trial is to begin in federal court on Nov. 13 before U.S. 
District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. 
</P>
<P>
During his emotional testimony, Steward locked eyes with "J.J.," as Jackson is 
called, and broke down and wept on the witness stand. Hatter recessed the 
hearing until the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Steward recalled that he was such friends with the agents that in 1985 he sent 
Jackson $70,000 in cash as a Christmas present. The money came from drug 
profits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In April of the following year, Steward said he dined with Jackson and Garcia 
in Beverly Hills and then, accompanied by their wives, went "window shopping" 
on Rodeo Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Four months later, Steward and the two agents, along with their wives, 
vacationed for two weeks in Hawaii, staying in the same hotel in Honolulu. 
Steward said they had made so much money off "The Big Rip" that they were in 
high spirits. Garcia and Jackson looked into buying some island real estate, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a vacation and to relieve tension," Steward testified, "We didn't need 
any more money at that point. . . . We all were over the hump, and all had made 
some money." 
</P>
<P>
Two days after Steward completed his testimony, Jackson pleaded guilty to drug 
trafficking, including charges that he stole drugs from the DEA's evidence 
vault and participated in the theft of drugs from the Pasadena stash house. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Jackson's plea, Countryman pleaded guilty to participating in the 
same narcotics trafficking conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors see Steward's testimony as an important component in their case 
against Garcia, even though he has admitted committing perjury twice two years 
ago when he testified before a federal grand jury investigating the DEA agents. 
At the time, he denied that he had any knowledge that Jackson and Garcia were 
trafficking in drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Steward admitted in August that he lied twice before the federal grand jury to 
protect Jackson and because he did not think federal investigators had enough 
evidence to convict him and the agents. 
</P>
<P>
"Most everything I said was a lie," Steward testified. 
</P>
<P>
Steward now maintains that Jackson came to him in 1983 with a proposition to 
traffic in a "girl," his street jargon for a kilo of cocaine. The two men had 
just completed their undercover investigation of the Mafia family and Jackson 
was returning to Los Angeles to resume work on other cases. 
</P>
<P>
"(He) told me that he was going to send me a kilo of cocaine, a little girl," 
Steward recalled. "Actually, I didn't believe it fully until it came." 
</P>
<P>
Steward said he assured his friend J.J. that he could turn the kilo over to his 
New York network and his people would sell it on the street. He said the kilo 
from Jackson soon arrived at Steward's Brooklyn residence, in waterproof brown 
wrapping. 
</P>
<P>
By 1984, Steward said, more drugs were sent to him by Jackson. Under 
questioning from rosecutor Karlin, Steward recounted how the federal agents 
used sleight of hand to steal drugs from the DEA property room vault. 
</P>
<P>
Steward testified that Jackson and his partner, whom he did not identify, used 
a ploy to divert the property clerk's attention, and then stole the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I don't know which one did the flimflamming, but they flimflammed 
somebody down in the property room," Steward said. 
</P>
<P>
Steward said he did not meet Garcia until 1986, when he was in New York 
preparing for the Mafia trial. Steward testified that while standing in a 
parking lot next to the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, he gave Jackson 
$9,000 from a cocaine sale while Garcia watched. 
</P>
<P>
Karlin: And what did you see Mr. Jackson do with the money? 
</P>
<P>
Steward: He handed it to Mr. Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
Karlin: And did you see what Mr. Garcia did with that money? 
</P>
<P>
Steward: Yes. He put it in his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Karlin: And did Mr. Garcia say anything at that time? 
</P>
<P>
Steward: Yes, he would like to get some more Federal Express packages. 
</P>
<P>
Subtracting his commission, Steward testified that he would mail the cash 
profits back to Jackson and Garcia via express mail. Some of the illicit cash 
was addressed to Jackson at the DEA's Los Angeles office, he said, and some of 
it went to Jackson's post office box in the same building. 
</P>
<P>
Mark E. Overland, one of Garcia's two defense attorneys, said Steward is a 
liar, citing his perjured testimony before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were a juror, I wouldn't believe anything he says," Overland said. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, incarcerated at the federal Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown 
Los Angeles, declined to be interviewed for this story. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia's attorneys must persuade a jury that his lifestyle -- which included an 
expensive home and approximately $3 million currently frozen in Luxembourg bank 
accounts -- was generated largely through jewelry smuggling and related 
business for an Italian firm. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty obvious where the money came from -- jewelry transactions, 
including some smuggling," Overland said. "That accounts for all of the $3 
million. There's no drug money." 
</P>
<P>
Government prosecutors contend the $3 million represents drug trafficking 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
Because he was extradited by Luxembourg on drug trafficking-related counts, 
Garcia cannot currently be charged with jewelry smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia also is charged in the indictment with passing on DEA intelligence 
information to fugitive drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
"He helped them move money," Steward said. "He also helped them avoid being 
caught." 
</P>
<P>
Steward said that Garcia had an FBI contact who provided Garcia with 
information that helped one of the drug dealers avoid arrest on one occasion in 
downtown Los Angeles.

"Well," Steward said, "there was a little laughing joke that (the FBI) just 
missed (one of the fugitives) on South Figueroa Street. They went in one door 
and he came out the other." 
</P>
<P>
An FBI spokesman in Los Angeles said the agency had no comment on Steward's 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Steward said he decided to tell the truth because he was convinced that the 
government had built a solid case against him and the DEA agents. 
</P>
<P>
"In plain language," Steward said, "they got us."

<P>
CAMPAIGN FUNDS: CRITICS SAY REPS. HOWARD L. BERMAN, MEL LEVINE AND HENRY A. 
WAXMAN BUY INFLUENCE BY DIVIDING UP MONEY AMONG OTHER DEMOCRATS, ALTHOUGH IT IS 
PERFECTLY LEGAL.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Between floor votes, committee sessions and meetings with constituents, Reps. 
Henry A. Waxman, Howard L. Berman and Mel Levine recently huddled behind closed 
doors in Waxman's spacious, high-ceilinged office to engage in a political 
ritual unique on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Working from handwritten prep sheets, the three Los Angeles-area Democrats 
discussed how to jointly dispense about $50,000 of their own campaign funds to 
other Democrats in Congress and Democratic challengers in competitive races 
around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Berman then called the lawmakers' shared campaign treasurer and instructed her 
to issue $1,000 checks from each of their campaign committees to various 
candidates, including fellow Reps. George E. Brown Jr. (D-Colton), Louise M. 
Slaughter (D-N.Y.) and Jim Jontz (D-Ind.). It is a practice well-honed by the 
trio over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Their cumulative generosity is unmatched in Congress, according to a 
computer-assisted study of congressional campaign spending for 1989-90 
conducted by The Times. In addition to congressional contests, Waxman, Berman 
and Levine routinely provide hefty support in state legislative, gubernatorial 
and local races as well as to various Democratic campaign organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its informality, this process is at the heart of one of the most 
effective and unusual Democratic alliances on Capitol Hill, where proximity 
generally breeds competition rather than cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
It is also controversial. Critics contend that the practice amounts to 
influence-buying within Congress, although it's perfectly legal. 
</P>
<P>
"It buys something -- if not votes, then compromises and bills introduced or 
bills not introduced, voice votes instead of recorded votes, actions not 
taken," said Ellen S. Miller, executive director of the Center for Responsive 
Politics. "It has the same kind of corrosive impact on the system as direct 
contributions from corporate PACs," or political action committees. 
</P>
<P>
In the current election cycle, the trio distributed a total of $110,611 to 
other candidates from their respective campaign committees, through the Oct. 15 
campaign reporting deadline. Waxman gave an additional $85,000 from his own 
political action committee. 
</P>
<P>
Since the close of the reporting period, they have contributed at least another 
$100,000. This includes $75,000 to California Democratic gubernatorial nominee 
Dianne Feinstein, given after a federal district judge overturned state 
contribution limits. 
</P>
<P>
All told, they have given to a total of 50 congressional candidates, of which 
18 have received contributions from all three. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, Berman ranks sixth among all members of Congress in contributing to 
other candidates, Waxman is 11th and Levine is 12th, The Times found. In the 
full 1987-88 election cycle, the three combined made 256 contributions totaling 
$453,320. 
</P>
<P>
Many other lawmakers make similar contributions. But what sets Waxman, Berman 
and Levine apart is that they pool at least some of their giving to maximize 
its electoral impact. Not incidentally, distributing the funds jointly also 
multiplies the benefits of the giving in an institution where campaign money is 
often the coin of the realm and members rarely forget who filled their coffers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the political equivalent of the sum being greater than the parts," 
said Rep. Robert G. Torricelli (D-N.J.), a prolific fund-raiser himself. "They 
are heard out of all proportion to their numbers because they represent real 
political strengths." 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say that dispersing campaign dollars is the sole key to the 
clout wielded by Waxman, who represents the 24th Congressional District, Berman 
of the 26th District, and Levine from the 27th District. Each is respected for 
his legislative abilities and Waxman has been called the most effective liberal 
in the House. 
</P>
<P>
The three lawmakers insist they attach no strings to their contributions. But 
they acknowledge that the money helps them pursue their legislative agendas. 
</P>
<P>
"It clearly builds relationships with colleagues to help them in their 
elections just as it builds relationships with colleagues to help them with 
their legislative activities," Waxman said unabashedly. "And those 
relationships are important because ultimately, to do anything around here, you 
have to have coalitions and support." 
</P>
<P>
Waxman, Berman and Levine are longtime friends and charter members of a 
progressive political alliance based in Los Angeles' affluent Westside and 
southern San Fernando Valley. They like to describe the operation -- which 
includes state and city officeholders and political consultants -- as friends 
who share political goals. 
</P>
<P>
Others call it the Waxman-Berman machine. 
</P>
<P>
Among the alliance's unofficial allies are fellow Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los 
Angeles), state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), Assemblymen Burt 
Margolin (D-Los Angeles) and Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles), and City 
Controller Rick Tuttle. Los Angeles political consultants Michael Berman, 
Howard's brother, and Carl D'Agostino represent the alliance's savvy, 
take-no-prisoners campaign arm. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers have been raising large amounts for like-minded candidates since 
their days in the California Assembly. Their ideological agenda is headed by 
support for Israel, first and foremost, as well as environmental protection and 
a woman's right to an abortion. Friends, fellow Californians and allies on 
specific issues get special consideration. 
</P>
<P>
The threesome and their associates are able to function, in effect, like a 
self-contained political party because they have a loyal base of donors -- 
particularly among Jewish supporters -- and face little election threat 
themselves. Waxman last had his own campaign headquarters when he first ran for 
the Assembly in 1968; Berman when he first ran for Congress in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"It's assumed that they'll help other people," said Marc Nathanson, a longtime 
fund-raiser for the three lawmakers and chief executive officer of Falcon 
Holding Group Inc., a cable television company based in Westwood. "It goes 
beyond their campaign." 
</P>
<P>
In their efforts to help others as well as themselves, Waxman has raised 
$413,009, and Berman has raised $452,919, during the current two-year 
legislative cycle. Levine, who is eyeing a 1992 U.S. Senate bid and enjoys the 
demands of fund raising more than the others, garnered $1,119,669, one of the 
highest figures for a House member. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond their shared base, Waxman, a congressional leader on health issues, 
generates 20% of his money from health-related PACs; Berman, a former labor 
lawyer, is a favorite of organized labor; and Levine, the scion of a wealthy 
Beverly Hills developer and old California family, gets significant support 
from family and personal friends. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman also has his own PAC, which allows him to exceed the $1,000 maximum on 
contributions from his own campaign committee and to give another $5,000 to 
candidates he supports in primary and general elections. Such "leadership PACs" 
help advance or solidify their organizer's House or Senate leadership 
aspirations or can be used to pay the costs of an unannounced presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time that Waxman, Berman and Levine give unto others, they spend 
relatively little directly on their own campaigns. Berman spent 17% of his 
campaign committee funds on his own election activities, Waxman, 19%, and 
Levine, 35%, The Times survey found. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see a line to be drawn between the political process and the 
legislative process," Waxman said. "I think they're all one and part of the 
same. Those people who are here in Washington, voting on bills, are elected 
through the political process. And whether I get my legislation passed depends 
on who's here." 
</P>
<P>
Waxman, in fact, in 1978 helped pioneer the tactic of steering campaign dollars 
to colleagues to advance one's goals within the House. As a two-term member, he 
decided to challenge Rep. Richardson Preyer, a senior and respected Democrat 
from South Carolina, for the vacant chairmanship of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee's health and environment subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Preyer's bid was hurt by his ownership of pharmaceutical stock, which he had 
inherited, and his sympathy for the home-state tobacco industry. At the same 
time, drawing on lessons learned as a state lawmaker in Sacramento, Waxman 
dispensed $24,000 in campaign funds to fellow members of the subcommittee. Some 
colleagues and observers criticized the contributions as a brazen bid to buy 
votes. Nevertheless, he won the chairmanship in a stunning upset. 
</P>
<P>
Since that time, Waxman has continued giving campaign money to subcommittee 
allies as part of his effort to win a tougher clean-air law, expanded health 
insurance and more money for AIDS treatment and research. 
</P>
<P>
Panel members Gerry Sikorski (D-Minn.), Jim Bates (D-San Diego) and Cardiss 
Collins (D-Ill.) have been among the beneficiaries of Waxman, Berman and 
Levine. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman's assistance goes beyond such contributions. He said that when Collins 
faced a primary challenge, he scheduled subcommittee hearings in her Chicago 
district "to let people back there know what she's doing." He has also attended 
fund-raisers there for her. 
</P>
<P>
On occasion, the lawmakers individually or collectively hold fund-raisers or 
ask major donors in Los Angeles to help gather money for another candidate. 
Berman and Levine raised more than $75,000 for their House Foreign Affairs 
Committee ally Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) during Reid's victorious Senate race in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
"The strength of the machine is how much money they can raise for other 
people," said a Democratic strategist with close ties to "the boys," as their 
friends often call them. "And you can never track that." 
</P>
<P>
Equally difficult to determine are the benefits that accrue from the 
contributions. But congressional insiders and observers agree that such 
assistance engenders goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
"When something comes up that is no big deal to you one way or another, you're 
going to be cognizant of your friends," said political scientist Norman 
Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. "The people who 
succeed in politics over the longer haul tend to be those who build their base 
of friends." 
</P>
<P>
Berman said that when he waged an uphill fight to win a coveted spot on the 
House Budget Committee in 1989, "the fact that I was the kind of Democrat who 
helped other Democrats was a help." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he noted that he began his campaign a year early and 
aggressively wooed members of the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, 
which makes such appointments. 
</P>
<P>
"It's part of a total picture," said Berman, a four-term lawmaker who has 
played central roles on arms control and immigration issues, where 
institutional power tends to reside. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the recipients of the largess are in positions to be especially 
helpful. Two examples are Rep. David R. Obey (D-Wis.), chairman of an important 
Appropriations subcommittee dealing with foreign operations, and Rep. Sidney R. 
Yates (D-Ill.), who chairs the Appropriations subcommittee that plays a major 
role in determining how much money the Santa Monica Mountains National 
Recreation Area receives to buy parkland. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, critics of this process -- including Common Cause and other 
groups that support campaign law reform -- maintain that it increases the need 
for special-interest money, provides a way around contribution limits, 
undermines party discipline and leaves colleagues feeling indebted. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-area lawmakers disagree. 
</P>
<P>
Recipients of their campaign funds are less beholden to them than they would be 
to corporate PACs, which would prefer to give to candidates directly, in any 
case, the lawmakers maintain. And they portray themselves as filling a partisan 
vacuum left by a Democratic Party unable to match big Republican donors. 
</P>
<P>
"We never suggest that any response is appropriate," Levine said. "If you have 
helped somebody, they are going to be more willing to listen to you. But I 
don't think that buys you anything."

NO 'HAPPY BIRTHDAYS' FOR MEDICARE AT 25 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL S. GREENBERG, Greenberg is editor and publisher of Science &amp; 
Government Report, a Washington-based newsletter. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington's grueling budget strife allows little time for ceremonial 
observations, especially when the celebrant is the focus of some of the 
capital's nastiest money battles. But it should not go unnoted that this year 
is the silver anniversary of Medicare, a benevolently intended assist for the 
elderly that has become a runaway monster in politics and medical economics. No 
one is singing "Happy Birthday." 
</P>
<P>
The trouble with Medicare is that it is primarily a tax-supported system in a 
free-enterprise health-care market. And the market has demonstrated boundless 
ingenuity in selling services, necessary and otherwise, despite a great array 
of restraints on hospital and doctor bills. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Medicare cost $35 billion. Last year, it was $107 billion. The 
estimate for 1995 is $180 billion, but past estimates have often been overrun. 
The producers of new medical technologies are endlessly inventive. The Medicare 
population, now 30 million over 65, plus 3.5 million disabled, keeps growing, 
as do the medical expectations of the American people. It's a rare year in 
which Medicare spending does not substantially outpace the inflation rate. 
</P>
<P>
Every attempt to restrain spending or to raise cost-sharing by the elderly 
provokes threats of political retribution that few officeholders are willing to 
face. Congress turned and ran last year when Medicare recipients rose up in a 
fit of irrational pique against a generous catastrophic-care measure that 
required cost-sharing by upper-income beneficiaries. The provision was 
canceled, leaving the elderly to savor a spectacular political victory, and 
back where they were with limited coverage for costly illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Exasperation with Medicare politics is strong on Capitol Hill, though few 
legislators show it openly. The latest episode, however, brought a public 
outburst from Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader. Noting that the 
higher Medicare fees in the rejected legislation were keyed to income, Dole 
exclaimed: "Somebody mentions the word Medicare, it is like crying 'Fire!' in a 
crowded theater, and we did not do anything in Medicare that touched poor 
people. Why should the taxpayer pay the Medicare premiums of millionaires in 
America?" 
</P>
<P>
The paradox of Medicare is that it is both expensive and inadequate. It pays 
only about half the health-care costs of the elderly, leaving the balance to 
their own resources or various skimpy public assistance programs. Though 
Medicare has the appearance of a mini-national health insurance program for the 
elderly and disabled, it merely helps with rather than covers health-care 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
Various new measures are in the works to hold down Medicare spending, including 
annual caps on hospital expenditures and a revision of doctors' fees that will 
favor primary and preventive care. But the basic problem with Medicare is that 
it is embedded in the American health-care system, and that system tends to be 
extravagant when it sniffs the possibility of reimbursement. In response to 
Medicare's money-saving moves, the health industry has proven itself to be 
endlessly ingenious in providing services that it insists are essential for the 
well-being of patients. 
</P>
<P>
One example is in treatment for fatal kidney disease, which is reimbursed under 
Medicare. A recent report by the House Ways and Means Committee, which writes 
legislation for Medicare, notes that the number of patients has for no apparent 
reason risen far above the number forecast. An unexpected part of the growth is 
in patients over 75 years of age, which the report says "reflects a shift in 
physician practice patterns." It adds that in the past, such patients would not 
have been accepted for treatment. The reason for accepting them now is not 
medically clear, the committee suggested, leaving the implication that perhaps 
economic factors are at work. 
</P>
<P>
When the political dust settles from the latest budget battles, bruises will be 
visible on many federal programs. Medicare will at worst show a few scratches. 
At age 25, it is an entrenched power on the American political landscape, and 
sure to become even more powerful through demographics and legislative 
timidity.

On Thursday, AT&amp;T and its Japanese counterpart, Kokusai Denshin Denwa Ltd., 
will donate part of the first cable system to span the Pacific to two 
scientific organizations that plan to use it to supply electricity and a 
communications link to ocean-floor systems in the western Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
The vital link, which has been replaced by a fiber optics system, will allow 
scientists for the first time to install permanent seismic monitoring stations 
on the ocean floor between Guam and Japan. Eventually, scientists hope to 
extend the program as other cables become available. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a great deal of excitement" over the potential of the program, said 
Rhett Butler, a seismologist with the Incorporated Research Institute for 
Seismology (IRIS) of Arlington, Va., one of the organizations that will receive 
title to part of the trans-Pacific cable next month. The institute, which 
coordinates seismic research for 70 U.S. colleges and universities, will be 
joined in the program by the Earthquake Research Institute of the University of 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tremendous opportunity for scientists," said Alan Chave, an 
oceanographer with AT&amp;T's Bell Laboratories. The cost of laying cable 
across the oceans is so great that "we could never possibly do it" for 
scientific purposes alone, he said, but since the cables are there already they 
provide a chance to create a true global network of monitoring stations at a 
bargain-basement price. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, scientists will be able to study offshore seismic activity 
on a continuing basis, including movement along faults, changes in the contour 
of the ocean floor that could indicate an imminent quake, and electromagnetic 
emissions from the Earth before and during quakes. The program could also aid 
research in a number of other areas that are global in scope. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanographic applications hold great promise for such areas as global changes 
in the oceanic environment, a matter of concern to scientists who fear that the 
planet may be warming because of the greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
The only way to find out if that is true, Chave said, is to monitor the entire 
planet simultaneously, and collect data continuously over a period of many 
years. One crucial tool in that effort could be the cables that are being 
abandoned around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The program is so new that no price tag has been set yet, but scientists 
believe they have come across a resource that is so valuable it cannot be 
wasted. 
</P>
<P>
"This will give the cables another life after retiring from telephone use," 
said Butler. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases the cables are in extremely good shape, although the link between 
California and Hawaii was somehow severed off the coast of California about a 
year ago. That cable could still be usable from Hawaii to the point where it is 
broken near the California coast, and it could eventually be reconnected to the 
mainland if that proved worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
Except for that problem, the trans-Pacific cable "is just about as good as it 
was when it was first put down in the early 1960s," said Bell's Chave. The 
cable should be useful for "at least another 20 years," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Chave said the cable can provide three things for science: a line to transmit 
power to ocean-floor instruments; a communications link to extract data 
immediately from those stations; and an ability to operate a wide range of 
instruments remotely. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't do any of those (without the cable)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, scientists were able to put instruments in the sea for up to two 
years, but the life of the instruments was limited by their batteries and it 
was not possible to retrieve data as it was collected. 
</P>
<P>
And eventually, "you have to drive a ship out there and pick it up," Chave 
said. All of that adds to the cost and reduces the effectiveness, and it 
creates gaps in the data. 
</P>
<P>
During a "workshop on scientific uses of undersea cables" in Hawaii earlier 
this year, Junzo Kasahara of the University of Tokyo singled out the primary 
problem in today's research when he noted that scientific data is collected 
"unequally" over the Earth because two-thirds of the planet is covered by 
oceans and little data is collected there. 
</P>
<P>
"We have estimated the nature of the Earth using these incomplete data," 
Kasahara told the workshop. 
</P>
<P>
Retired undersea telephone cables could help fill those gaps by allowing 
scientists to put permanent facilities on the floors of the oceans and collect 
data as it is generated. That is particularly important in seismic research, 
because scientists generally see only the part of the picture that happens on 
land. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, there is a huge gap," said Butler, who has been active in the 
effort to convert the cables for several years. He noted that there are many 
seismic stations in California, but "once you leave the coast, the next station 
is in Hawaii." 
</P>
<P>
There are still many bugs, including financing, to be worked out, however. 
Bell's Chave said the biggest problem is finding a way to install instruments 
along the cable at a reasonable cost. When AT&amp;T crews needed to install 
repeaters, for instance, they did it by cutting the cable, lifting both ends to 
the surface and splicing their equipment into it. 
</P>
<P>
"That's half a million dollars a pop," he said, and that kind of money is hard 
to come by in scientific circles. 
</P>
<P>
So the program is expected to get off to a slow start and will initially be 
centered in the seismically active zone between Guam and Japan. U.S. 
participants hope to build the equipment in Guam that will power the 
instruments at a cost of "several hundred thousand dollars," Butler said. The 
system was designed to transmit power from Guam, not Japan, and it is not 
reversible, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Japan plans to install three stations on the sea floor. Two of those will be 
purely for the study of seismic phenomena, such as the propagation of seismic 
waves along the ocean floor after an earthquake. The third will also include 
electromagnetic and oceanographic sensors to monitor such things as changes in 
water temperature and electromagnetic signals emitted by the Earth before and 
during earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
Chave said there is also considerable interest in a cable that stretches from 
Rhode Island to Spain, because that could monitor the Atlantic, including a 
giant geological structure called the Mid-Atlantic Ridge that bisects the ocean 
floor and marks the area where the tectonic plates are pulling apart. That 
cable will become available in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
"There are going to be a lot of opportunities coming up like this in the next 
10 years," Chave said. 
</P>
<P>
The Incorporated Research Institute for Seismology is putting together a 
proposal for funding from the National Science Foundation. Although the biggest 
cost of the project has already been paid by the companies that installed the 
cables, it will not be cheap to build sophisticated ocean-floor systems and 
install them. 
</P>
<P>
Chave said several cost-cutting concepts are being studied, including the 
installation of "junction boxes" along the cables. That would require a 
one-time splicing into the cable for each box, and instruments could be added 
at any time by simply "plugging them in." 
</P>
<P>
And ways will have to be found to attach the instruments firmly to the ocean 
floor so that such things as seismometers will not be confused by currents and 
shifts in the mud at the bottom of the sea. 
</P>
<P>
The program is so new that there is no consensus on how those objectives would 
best be met. But U.S. scientists believe they will be able to learn much at 
bargain basement prices in the initial effort, because the government of Japan 
plans to spend $10 million on the three ocean-floor stations, far more than the 
U.S. obligation. 
</P>
<P>
Since the power to run the cable between Guam and Japan must originate in Guam, 
it will be up to American scientists to provide that at a cost far less than 
the Japanese investment in the program. In exchange, U.S. scientists will share 
fully in the research and results from the Japanese stations. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an instance where we can learn a great deal about working with cables 
for very little money," said Chave. "The Japanese are budgeting $10 million. If 
we can learn whether this is worth doing (for the cost of providing the 
facilities in Guam), then it's a good deal." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SEISMIC RESEARCH NETWORK 
</P>
<P>
Telephone cables that span much of the world's oceans will become available for 
other uses within this decade, and scientists hope to see at least some of them 
to run seismic and oceanographic instruments on the ocean floor. 
</P>
<P>
This map shows cables that are expected to be replaced by fiber optics systems 
by the end of this century. Part of a cable that links the United States and 
Japan will be turned over to research organizations on Nov. 1. That cable runs 
from Guam to Japan, and scientists plan to use it to supply power and extract 
data from three subsea stations along that route.

KNICKS STILL LOOKING FOR A STARTING POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURTIS G. BUNN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PURCHASE, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York Knicks Coach Stu Jackson says that he will not announce his starting 
lineup for the regular season until right before game time Friday in Charlotte, 
N.C., which means Mark Jackson will not know until then if he has won back his 
starting job. 
</P>
<P>
The coach would not say why he is keeping his point guards in the dark, other 
than to say, "I like to keep my starting lineup a secret." 
</P>
<P>
Maurice Cheeks, the incumbent point guard, played sparingly in the exhibition 
season as Stu Jackson tried to preserve the 34-year-old veteran of a dozen 
National Basketball Association seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Then Cheeks had back pain that kept him out of the last two exhibition games 
against the Dallas Mavericks and San Antonio Spurs. Meanwhile, Mark Jackson, 
who already was having a stellar camp, flourished even more while starting and 
playing extended minutes in Cheeks' absence. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson ran the club with aplomb and had 25 points against the Mavericks. 
Against the Spurs, Jackson had 23 points, eight assists and three steals. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the kind of situation I look forward to," the 26-year-old guard said. 
"It wasn't a perfect preseason, but I'm very happy with the way I played. I 
just feel great." 
</P>
<P>
Stu Jackson said: "Mark's certainly capable of starting, I think right now 
we'll leave it as is and go on with our practices and see. But I don't think 
it's a big deal who starts. As long as both guys are pulling in the same 
direction, then that's all that matters to me." 
</P>
<P>
But there is more that matters to the players. Cheeks, who initially was 
obtained to be Jackson's backup but was elevated to a starter last March, has 
said he wants to start -- but if he is not going to be the starter, he wants to 
know in advance so he can make the mental adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
And Mark Jackson said after the Spurs game Saturday night, "Starting is 
important to me. It's very important, I'm not going to lie. If I don't start, 
it's not the end of the world. But I've worked hard and shown that I'm capable 
of doing the job." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "One of my goals for the preseason was to make the other teams 
respect me. I had that in my first two years. I think I've gotten that back. 
And I can sense that my teammates are confident with me running the show." 
</P>
<P>
Said shooting guard Gerald Wilkins: "Mark's been great. The fans appreciate 
him, and it's well-deserved. He's been humiliated, but he's a smart guy. And a 
smart guy doesn't make the same mistake twice." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said the three necessary cuts to reduce the roster to the maximum 12 
players probably will be made Tuesday. The Knicks might be able to keep someone 
they would otherwise cut because of Kenny Walker's strained left knee. Walker 
more than likely will start the season on the injured list. 
</P>
<P>
The battle for positions is at backup center between Eddie Lee Wilkins, Earl 
Cureton and Stuart Gray, and at guard between Greg Grant and John Starks. 
Wilkins, having served adequately as Ewing's backup in the last three years, 
seems assured of that job once more. 
</P>
<P>
Cureton has impressed the coaches by providing the intangibles of setting solid 
screens, playing tough interior defense and rebounding well on both ends of the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-foot Gray had an inspired game against Dallas last Sunday. But in other 
games he's been his worst enemy by pressing to do more than he's capable of 
doing, which resulted in mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he still likes the 5-foot-7 Grant, although Grant repeatedly has 
had trouble defending taller players, which puts pressure on his teammates to 
cover for him. Starks had a rocky exhibition season, but when he performed well 
-- as he did against Dallas at Madison Square Garden and at San Antonio -- he 
excelled as a scorer. That the 6-5 Starks is a tough and quick defender should 
work to his advantage, but the Knicks' coaching staff seems higher on Grant.

SMALL VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Detroit's 27-10 victory over New Orleans was the Saints' third loss to a 
run-and-shoot offense in four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints, ranked eighth in the NFC in team defense, lost to Houston, 23-10, 
last week and to Atlanta, 28-27, three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Reaching for a positive note, the Saints can offer only defensive end Jim 
Wilks, who registered their first sack of a run-and-shoot quarterback this 
season when he got to Rodney Peete in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Peete, however, was only momentarily grounded. The former USC quarterback got 
up and completed 16 of 24 passes for 246 yards, including a five-yard touchdown 
pass to Robert Clark.

THE JOHN WILLIAMS ENIGMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID ALDRIDGE, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The day in 1986 came, and John Williams decided to leave Louisiana State 
University. It wasn't pleasant for him. It has often seemed basketball hasn't 
been much fun for Williams since. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Bullets have been locked in a 10-month battle with their star 
over his weight, his work habits and, most recently, his money. He is in Los 
Angeles waiting to be paid; the Bullets have just concluded an 0-7 preseason 
but say they will pay him nothing until he comes east, undergoes a physical 
examination and continues rehabilitation of his injured right knee under their 
supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Life has not been the same for John Williams since Dec. 2. That's when a 
misstep tore the medial collateral ligament and partially tore the anterior 
cruciate ligament in his knee and put on hold one of the league's more 
promising careers. 
</P>
<P>
It's a case in which neither side appears to be a victor -- the Bullets faced 
with playing an 82-game NBA schedule without their best player, Williams 
sitting on the West Coast knowing that, as the "Peanuts" philosopher Charlie 
Brown said, "A great potential is man's heaviest burden." 
</P>
<P>
"John did not want to leave LSU," said his coach there, Dale Brown. "When he 
came to see me he was in tears. I think (his time at LSU) was the happiest he 
ever was. I think he felt very comfortable here; there wasn't any pressure 
here. He could just play. 
</P>
<P>
"He said 'I've got to go.' (I said) 'Well, what happened, John?' (He said) 
'Well, I've just got to go.' Some of those kids just aren't ready to go. John 
just wasn't ready. Everyone was just pulling on him. John was like a big teddy 
bear. I really loved John. John was real easy to coach. He was very gentle. He 
had no ego whatsoever. His only problem was he was just too nice to too many 
people. He couldn't say no." 
</P>
<P>
Who were they? Friends, acquaintances, people who hooked onto the star of John 
Sam Williams and helped convince him he belonged in the NBA. "A lot of those 
people," Brown said, "I thought were parasites." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who declined to be interviewed for this article, told the (Baltimore) 
Sun on Friday he would sit out the season if the Bullets didn't give him the 
more than $276,000 they've withheld from his $1.2 million contract since 
mid-July. They did that because he failed to attend rehabilitation sessions at 
Kerlan-Jobe clinic in Los Angeles, his home city. 
</P>
<P>
"John has had a history of this with us," former Bullets general manager Bob 
Ferry said. "It could be anything. Over the years we've heard a lot of his 
answering machine. He just doesn't face reality and by not communicating he 
doesn't have to. He's really a nice guy but he's an irresponsible person." 
</P>
<P>
No one with the Bullets is surprised at Williams's behavior. For three years, 
they held their breath, they talked to him, they cajoled him, they praised him, 
they cursed him. They let him do what he wanted in previous offseasons, but 
requested he stay here last offseason. Ten months have passed. They're still 
waiting to see him. 
</P>
<P>
If John Williams were a selfish ballplayer, he probably could average 25 points 
a game. He's got the heft to go around most big men, yet possesses a feathery 
shooting touch around the basket. But what makes him special is his willingness 
to integrate teammates into the flow of a game. 
</P>
<P>
He's as good a passer for a big man as anybody not named Magic Johnson. As a 
sophomore at LSU, he took over, leading the Southeastern Conference in 
rebounding and earning MVP honors in the SEC tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"He never really liked the publicity," Brown said. "He shied away from it. He'd 
have his greatest game ever, and as soon as I came in he'd say 'Hey Coach, 
didn't Don (Redden) have a great game?' He always did that. The kids just loved 
him." 
</P>
<P>
He had a solid relationship with the Bullets players, and as Washington's needs 
grew, so did his responsibilities: point guard against pressure defenses, 
low-post defender, ballhandler in the half-court offense, rebounder. This 
continued for three seasons, and he never complained. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought what he got most of his effectiveness from was his versatility," 
Bullets Coach Wes Unseld said. "I also thought it probably stopped him from 
getting some of the notoriety as far as all-star games and things like that. 
But I never did that without consulting him or talking to him about it. He sort 
of regaled in that opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
But there always was another problem, and Williams has acknowledged it in the 
past. He'd always carry extra weight. He'd take enough off in training camp 
that he could play, and because the team was asking him to do so much bumping 
in inside traffic, it was probably better that he have a little extra heft. 
</P>
<P>
The Bullets grudgingly accepted that Williams wasn't going to be a 
chiseled-physique specimen. His contracts never have included weight clauses, 
but incentive bonuses (last season, up to $200,000) if he held to a certain 
weight. 
</P>
<P>
After his injury, he spent several weeks in a cast, then was fitted with a 
range-of-motion brace. He worked out in Bethesda and the knee started coming 
around, albeit slowly. Then Williams asked to work out in Los Angeles during 
the summer and the Bullets said okay. 
</P>
<P>
But he gradually stopped. He told the Sun the reasons were personal -- the 
death of a close friend and his father's stroke. He withdrew from public view. 
One of the people he did see in Los Angeles was Delbert Wright, his junior high 
school coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Every Saturday the older guys come up and play," Wright said. "I told him, 
'John, I'll dedicate my whole summer to getting you healthy and getting your 
knee better and getting that weight off you.' He said, 'Okay, Coach.' I only 
saw John once after that." 
</P>
<P>
People grow apart, and it's happened with Williams and Wright. But it's left 
Wright angry. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a big head," said Wright, who's known Williams since seventh grade. 
"He won't listen anymore. It hurts when they act like they don't even know you. 
... To me it was more than a coach and a basketball player. It was like a 
father and a son, or a big brother." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, the Bullets decided to stop paying him, and all this trouble began. 
They lost track of him, and club owner Abe Pollin began using "back channels" 
to find him. 
</P>
<P>
The Bullets didn't regain contact with him until Oct. 11. And then the squall 
over whether he'd get his money back all at once or in increments ensued. 
Neither side is budging, and Williams says he is prepared for a long siege. His 
teammates wonder. They don't want to talk much about it. Potential gradually 
gives ground to reality.

FRICTION OVER FACT VERSUS FICTION; 
</P>
<P>
BOOKS: AN EX-LOVER OF AUTHOR TERRY MCMILLAN CLAIMS A CHARACTER IN 'DISAPPEARING 
ACTS' IS A DISTORTED PORTRAIT OF HIM. HIS SUIT CHILLS THE WRITING WORLD. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a suit that could affect virtually anyone who writes fiction in this 
country, a former lover of novelist Terry McMillan has filed a $4.75 million 
defamation suit against her. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Welch's suit claims that he is recognizable as the model for the 
central character in McMillan's novel "Disappearing Acts" (Viking, 1989), and 
that the book defames him. The suit also names Penguin USA, the parent company 
of Viking, and Simon &amp; Schuster, which published the book in paperback, as 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
The case is frightening, said novelist Marita Golden, "because some of the 
greatest fiction is based on real people." If Welch wins the suit, said Golden, 
author most recently of a novel called "Long Distance Life" (Doubleday), "It 
would definitely put a chilling effect on fiction writers." 
</P>
<P>
Welch was unavailable for comment on the suit, filed in August in the Superior 
Court of King's County (Brooklyn). A hearing has not been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
His lawyer, Peter Gordon, said he and his client object to the way the book 
allegedly portrays his client in a character named Franklin Swift, as "hostile, 
angry and lazy," a "racist," someone who "drinks on the job" and is "intolerant 
toward homosexuals," a "stool pigeon," a "rapist," a "drug user" and "a man who 
is crazy and sick." 
</P>
<P>
On advice of counsel, McMillan declined to discuss the case. Martin Garbus, the 
lawyer for Penguin USA, called Welch's action "a private passion, a vendetta." 
Acknowledging that Welch and McMillan lived together in Brooklyn for three 
years and had a child, as did the main characters in "Disappearing Acts," 
Garbus added: "It is not so much a lawsuit as a marital dispute." 
</P>
<P>
He said the suit was in part a reflection of the book's success. 
</P>
<P>
"Disappearing Acts" won praise from critics for its portrait of the 
relationship between Zora, a black would-be singer, and Franklin, a black 
construction worker. McMillan was lauded particularly for her skill in 
depicting a male point of view. The book was hailed as a "crossover" work, 
appealing equally to black and white audiences. It sold moderately well for a 
first novel. 
</P>
<P>
"If this book had been totally obscure and if Terry McMillan were an obscure 
writer, you would have a different case," Garbus said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's just part of the general nastiness of the time, that people see 
someone doing well and they want part of it," Golden said. "It's part of the 
whole intolerance of the imagination." 
</P>
<P>
But Gordon, Welch's attorney, contends McMillan's portrait was too realistic. 
"If you're going to call it fiction, make it fiction," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
His 27-page complaint outlines the instances in the book that he says defame 
his client. He said he and Welch arrived at the $4.75-million figure for 
damages by "figuring out what each cause of action was worth." He said that as 
a result of McMillan's book, Welch "has been shunned in different areas. People 
have been looking at him differently, suspiciously." 
</P>
<P>
Garbus, representing Viking, branded the monetary damages claimed in the suit 
"preposterous." The law of libel and defamation is changing, Garbus said, "so 
that someone would have to be nearly driven out of work" in order to collect 
damages. "So far, we have no reason to believe that has happened" to Welch, 
Garbus said. 
</P>
<P>
Garbus concedes there are some similarities between Welch and Franklin Swift, 
such as that both are tall black construction workers. 
</P>
<P>
But, Garbus said, "What Terry McMillan has done is no different than what other 
writers have done. 
</P>
<P>
"It has to be permissible to draw on your real-life experiences. Otherwise, you 
can't write fiction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Garbus cites the precedent seven years ago of Springer vs. Viking Press, in 
which Lisa Springer argued unsuccessfully that she had been libeled when her 
former love, Robert Tine, used her as the model for a character in his novel 
"State of Grace." 
</P>
<P>
That case, Garbus wrote in an article in the Brooklyn Law Review, found that "a 
libel claim based on fiction must be dismissed unless a reasonable reader of 
the allegedly libelous material would understand that the fictional character 
was an actual portrayal of the plaintiff." 
</P>
<P>
"The question is, is it recognizable to a large number of people out there?" 
Garbus explained. "Merely because a certain number of people can recognize it, 
it's OK." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon, however, said that "the standard in the law is that anybody who knows 
my client who read the book would have to be able to recognize" the character 
as Welch. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon also said the suit alleges that McMillan acted "maliciously" in writing 
"Disappearing Acts." 
</P>
<P>
"What Terry McMillan was thinking was vindictiveness, revenge," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon also faults Viking, McMillan's publisher. "You can't let a book like 
this go through without making certain checks," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
But Gordon, like Garbus, was quick to point out that a victory for his client 
could set an unhappy precedent. 
</P>
<P>
"If this becomes a precedent, it's going to be bad law," Gordon said, in that 
there would be a lot of frivolous cases filed. "I'd hate to put a chilling 
effect on future fiction writers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If Welch were to win the case, Garbus said, "it would be ghastly. It creates a 
bad atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Garbus said, if a fiction writer felt he or she had to "make a 
6-foot, 3-inch Jewish lawyer into a 7-foot, 2-inch black basketball player, it 
would change the story." 
</P>
<P>
Faith Sale, vice president and executive editor of G. P. Putnam's Sons, echoed 
the lawyers' concerns. "Fiction writers write best when they know what they 
write about," said Sale, the editor for Joseph Heller, Alice Hoffman and Amy 
Tan, among other fiction writers. 
</P>
<P>
"It really is a difficult problem," said Tim O'Brien, whose most recent novel 
is "The Things They Carried" (Houghton Mifflin). Novelists necessarily write 
about their own experiences, O'Brien said. But, "On the other hand, an author 
does have an obligation to protect the privacy of an individual." A novelist 
does this, said O'Brien, by working "to create a balance, to try to disguise as 
much as possible anything that is brought out of the real world." 
</P>
<P>
Still, O'Brien said, "Just the fact that these suits are filed is very, very 
frightening. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone can recognize themselves in anything," O'Brien said. "I can recognize 
myself in Ahab." 
</P>
<P>
Garbus said he would move to have the case dismissed.

GRAND STYLE FOR A CAROUSEL RIDE

<P>
The pretty people went all out dressing up for Barbara Davis' Carousel Ball for 
diabetes charities on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Vaults were cleared out for the evening -- make that jewelry vaults, not fur. 
</P>
<P>
And, for a change, Los Angeles women abandoned their beloved rhinestones, 
sequins and beads for gowns of satin, chiffon and velvet. 
</P>
<P>
The big exceptions were the tiny rhinestone-encrusted handbags with four-figure 
price tags designed by Judith Leiber and clutched by nearly all. The bags come 
in a variety of shapes and sizes, but this evening there were so many 
egg-shaped Leibers, it looked like a strange bird had laid an egg on every 
table. 
</P>
<P>
Dresses were grand and full-skirted -- from Ivana Trump's chartreuse, fuchsia 
and orange gown from Christian Lacroix's couture collection to chairwoman 
Davis' pink Scaasi. (Pink is Davis' favorite color, and she matched the roses, 
balloons and even the carousel horses on the napkin rings.) 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there were so many people swathed in so many yards of fabric that 
maneuvering through the Beverly Hilton was no easy feat. 
</P>
<P>
If someone wasn't stepping on your skirt, you were stepping on theirs. 
</P>
<P>
"Dangerous dress," allowed Anne-Marie Graff, wife of London jeweler Laurence 
Graff, as someone walked across her Hanae Mori gown. 
</P>
<P>
"Sorry, you caught me," said designer Pat Kerr as her own dress suffered the 
same fate. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen women anywhere look so good," said Rose Marie Bravo, chief 
executive officer of I. Magnin, herself dressed in Yves Saint Laurent's slim 
plaid skirt and jacket. 
</P>
<P>
"They really outdid themselves."

THE SITCOM BEHIND THE SITCOM; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THE COUNTDOWN TO AN 'EVENING SHADE' REHEARSAL CAN BE COMEDIC. JUST 
ASK WRITER AND PRODUCER LINDA BLOODWORTH-THOMASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
To those people in Hollywood who fill up empty computer screens writing comedy 
and drama, Linda Bloodworth-Thomason is an amazement. She has written 61 
"Designing Women" scripts in the past four years, most of them scrawled on 
yellow legal pads the Saturday and/or Sunday before the first cast rehearsal on 
Monday. That's like running the three-minute mile in spike heels. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to take six to eight hours on a script," she says. "Now I take about 12 
to 14 hours. I'm going downhill. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Of course," she adds, "a lot of writers will read this and wonder, 'Who does 
this broad think she is?' Listen, not all these are gems." 
</P>
<P>
But "Designing Women," a monster hit for CBS (No. 6 for the season), is widely 
regarded as one of the best-written series on the air, and Bloodworth-Thomason 
is now applying her talents to "Evening Shade," the new Burt Reynolds comedy. 
She created the show and produces it with husband Harry Thomason. 
</P>
<P>
CBS will re-introduce the series in a different time period tonight at 8, 
spelling "Uncle Buck" for the week. "Evening Shade" will also play at 8 p.m. 
Friday, its usual time slot. 
</P>
<P>
"Evening Shade" ranks 57th in the season-to-date ratings (out of 90 prime-time 
series). But, cautioned Michael Eisenberg, CBS vice president for audience 
measurement, ensemble series are notoriously slow to build an audience. If the 
episode tonight does "substantially well," a shift in time period might be 
recommended. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the legend growing up around Bloodworth-Thomason's writing feats, the 
preparation of tonight's "Evening Shade" episode, called "Fast Women," turned 
out to be a sitcom within a sitcom. The episode took 12 to 14 hours to write, 
spread over three days instead of the usual two, because of digressions. 
</P>
<P>
She waxed philosophic late one Monday night in September, knowing that the cast 
would be waiting for her words the next morning: "The interesting thing is that 
when you have five hours to write 30 more pages and these people are here from 
Poplar Bluff (her Missouri hometown) and your brother told them that you 
personally are gonna give them a tour of the whole lot and there's a reporter 
on the phone asking you to comment on Burt and it's for USA Weekend and the 
hairdresser did not work out and two of the actors didn't get here from Dallas 
for dubbing and you're just standing there with a big smile on your face . . . 
then you really know what it's like to be Miss Congeniality." 
</P>
<P>
As for the plot: Wood Newton (Reynolds) is prevailed on by wife Ava (Marilu 
Henner) to intervene in the romantic pursuits of son Taylor (Jay R. Ferguson) 
and Ava's father, Evan (Hal Holbrook). Taylor is entangled with a senior who 
announces to Newton that she intends to "have sex with your son" and will be 
gentle. Evan is likewise entangled with the town stripper, who dances with a 
very long scarf. 
</P>
<P>
By ready resume, Bloodworth-Thomason comes to her present position via the 
University of Missouri, the Wall Street Journal (selling ads), a high school in 
Watts (teaching), then "MASH," "One Day at a Time," "Rhoda," "Limestreet" and 
"Filthy Rich" (writing scripts). 
</P>
<P>
She is an ebullient woman who talks considerably, and considerably like a 
composite of her "Designing Women" cast. She seems more earth mother than 
Hollywood producer. 
</P>
<P>
Her talent is (1) writing and (2) putting off writing. "I get distracted very 
easily," she said. 
</P>
<P>
On the Saturday afternoon that she commenced writing "Fast Women," before the 
series had made its debut, a friend called from Poplar Bluff with an hour of 
town gossip. Meanwhile, Burt Reynolds had been hammering on the walls of the 
show's office at MTM Studios in North Hollywood. "He's hanging photos of his 
life," she explained, "and now he's hanging them in my office and my bathroom 
-- since he's out of space in his office. He is a hanging-picture fanatic." 
</P>
<P>
Husband Harry brought in a deli feast for a picnic on the set. Pam Norris, who 
now produces "Designing Women" and does most of its writing, came by for more 
digression. Like the Miss America Pageant. "We just watch the part where the 
girls come in and shout their states," Bloodworth-Thomason said. "Then we're 
satiated." 
</P>
<P>
She and Norris have an odd bond. Each needs a deadline hanging over her head 
like the sword of Damocles. Wherever they are on Sunday nights at 7, they yell 
when the ticking clock starts on "60 Minutes" -- a ritual panic signifying that 
they're not ready for the messenger who's been dispatched by the script-typing 
service to collect their pages. 
</P>
<P>
"Without Pam, there's no way I could do this new show," Bloodworth-Thomason 
said. "We shoot her scripts as they are. If I died tonight, I know that as a 
personal favor, she'd finish this script." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday was dead for writing. CBS desperately needed the hour pilot to send to 
the press for reviews -- and it was 24 minutes long! She spent day and night in 
the editing trailer. The cast was told to report for the week's script reading 
on Tuesday instead of Monday. 
</P>
<P>
She resumed writing Monday, amid: Script reading for the new "Designing Women." 
Visit by a CBS official and some members of the Federal Communications 
Commission. Press interview. Casting. More editing. More press. 
</P>
<P>
The messenger finally picked up "Fast Women" about 3 a.m. Seven hours and 20 
minutes later, a box of fresh scripts was carried into the sound stage to 
awaiting performers. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 cast and staff members laughed and laughed over the pages. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the reading, a few actors rushed to the boss to seek refinements. 
Elizabeth Ashley, who plays the raucous Freida, suggested a few line 
adjustments. Reynolds marveled over the way Bloodworth-Thomason had captured 
the actors' rhythms so fast. 
</P>
<P>
An executive from CBS, likewise smiling, had minor requests for changes dealing 
with taste. Purple Crackle Whorehouse in Hot Springs, Ark., sounded naughty and 
was changed to Purple Dawn. A couple of other sexual references were 
questioned; the writer pleaded, "This morning about 2 o'clock, I couldn't think 
of a euphemism for that." 
</P>
<P>
Back in her office, Bloodworth-Thomason tried to relax and chat about writing 
-- how "Everybody's a writer," spoken with irony. "It's not like a brain 
surgeon," she said. "You never meet a brain surgeon and tell him, 'Listen, I've 
been meaning to talk to you about another way to do that operation. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Then there was someone asking what clip of the show to run on Johnny Carson. 
And the pilot still was two minutes, 30 seconds too long. 
</P>
<P>
She reflected, "If Lawrence Tisch (president and dominant shareholder of CBS 
Inc.) could see the process that two of his biggest shows go through, he'd 
probably get rid of some of that stock!"

COLE PORTER: RED, HOT AND NEW; 
</P>
<P>
FUND-RAISING: 26 YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH, THE GREAT AMERICAN SONGWRITER'S MUSIC 
STILL INTRIGUES POP FIGURES. ARTISTS FROM U2 TO TOM WAITS PERFORM ON AN ALBUM 
FEATURING HIS SONGS THAT WILL BENEFIT AIDS CHARITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cole Porter couldn't have been farther from the working-class-hero profile of 
your average rock 'n' roller. 
</P>
<P>
Born into privilege, the man who wrote such pop classics as "Night and Day" and 
"I've Got You Under My Skin" before Elvis entered grade school attended Yale, 
where he led the Glee Club and was a member of the Whiffenpoofs. 
</P>
<P>
The Indiana native studied composition in Europe and spent much of his life 
hobnobbing with what is now called the jet set. 
</P>
<P>
So why does the music of Cole Porter, who died in 1964 at age 73, serve as the 
foundation of an AIDS campaign that is shaping up as the most ambitious pop 
charity project since the 1988 Amnesty International world tour? 
</P>
<P>
The campaign begins Tuesday with the Chrysalis Records release of "Red, Hot and 
Blue," an album that features interpretations of Porter songs by 22 
contemporary pop artists, including U2, Talking Heads leader David Byrne, 
Sinead O'Connor, k.d. lang, Tom Waits, Neneh Cherry and the Neville Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Leigh Blake, a London-based filmmaker and the project's co-director, said 
Porter's music was chosen for both aesthetic and thematic reasons. Porter 
himself, Blake said, was homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
"Cole Porter was one of America's greatest songwriters, and his music spoke 
about love and sex and experimentation with intelligence -- and that's what you 
want when dealing with an AIDS benefit," Blake said by phone from London. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember in the early days of the project, listening to the lyrics and 
thinking, 'My god, how appropriate.' Lines like 'Just the thought of you . . . 
makes me stop before I begin . . . 'cause I've got you under my skin.' " 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Blake said, there was great enthusiasm among today's artists for 
Porter's songs -- and the challenge of interpreting music from an earlier era. 
</P>
<P>
Neneh Cherry, the London-based singer whose "Buffalo Stance" was one of the 
most enticing singles of 1989, opens the warm, imaginative album with an 
especially bold version of "I've Got You Under My Skin." 
</P>
<P>
Using only a trace of Porter's original lyric and melody, Cherry turns the 
lighthearted expression of romantic obsession into an aggressive hip-hop 
warning about AIDS. The title line, in the new context, can be seen as either 
the statement of an AIDS victim or a pregnant woman who fears her baby may have 
the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Porter's own classic rhyme "Use your mentality / Wake up to reality" 
-- which Cherry preserves -- becomes an AIDS slogan, both a warning and a cry 
for greater support of AIDS research and its victims. Cherry adds her own rap 
slogan: "Share your love / Don't share the needle." 
</P>
<P>
A few other artists also take considerable liberties with Porter's music, but 
most keep it pretty much intact. U2 approaches "Night and Day" -- one of 
Porter's most memorable love songs -- with the same anxious rock intensity the 
group brings to its own expressions of devotion. And O'Connor sings "You Do 
Something to Me" in a '40s torch style that preserves the confessional tone of 
her "I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got" album. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne offers an appropriately playful treatment of "Don't Fence Me In," while 
lang gives an especially affecting vocal intimacy to "So in Love." Not 
everything, however, works; "Love for Sale," for instance, a once-scandalous 
song about prostitution, is embarrassingly labored by the Fine Young Cannibals. 
</P>
<P>
One reason Porter's songs hold up better than almost any other pop composer of 
his day is that there was an underlying tension in many of them -- a sly, 
almost mocking humor in the lighter tunes and a melancholy pessimism in many of 
the most beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the lyrics on "Red, Hot and Blue" serve as a poignant and uncanny 
commentary on the suffering and heartache of the AIDS struggle -- a commentary 
that Annie Lennox seemed to sense in her moving vocal on "Ev'ry Time We Say 
Goodbye." Sample lines: 
</P>
<P>
"Ev'ry time we say goodby / I die a little / Ev'ry time we say goodby /I wonder 
why a little / Why the gods above me / Who must be in the know / Think so 
little of me / They allow you to go." 
</P>
<P>
Blake, who's organized the project with New York art critic and lawyer John 
Carlin, said one disappointing note about the "Red, Hot and Blue" campaign was 
the inability to secure a corporate sponsor, which would have made initial 
financing easier. "We approached lots of potential sponsors and were given all 
sorts of excuses, but the (truth is) there is still a stigma associated with 
AIDS that people and corporations don't want to deal with," Blake said. 
</P>
<P>
The album will be followed by an ABC-TV special Dec. 1 and a home video in 
April. Both will feature various short films as well as videos of more than a 
dozen of the songs made by directors Alex Cox, Jonathan Demme, Jim Jarmusch, 
Wim Wenders and others. Proceeds will go to AIDS charities.

NEW LAW COULD END LONG WAIT FOR IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Felipe Gomez, a native of Mexico who has lived in Fullerton and worked for the 
same nursery 11 years, became a legal resident of this country last year. His 
three children were born here, so they are U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
But Felipe's wife did not qualify for amnesty. So she has placed her name on 
the long list of foreigners seeking legal residency in this country. Because 
the number of applicants for visas far outpaces the legal ceiling imposed by 
Congress, Rosalva Gomez had faced a 10-year wait for that piece of paper saying 
she can stay here permanently. 
</P>
<P>
But the most comprehensive reform of U.S. immigration laws in 25 years, passed 
by Congress Saturday night by a vote of 264 to 118, could dramatically reduce 
the long wait for Rosalva Gomez and thousands of others like her waiting to 
become legal residents or citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The landmark measure would expand the number of people allowed to enter the 
United States by an estimated 40% and change the mix of skills and ethnic 
backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
When the law goes into effect in 1992, it will more than double the number of 
immigrants allowed entry because of their job skills, grant temporary "safe 
haven" to Salvadoran refugees and open the borders to tens of thousands of 
immigrants from Ireland and other nations who have been largely excluded under 
current laws. 
</P>
<P>
It also wipes from the statute books decades-old restrictions barring entry to 
people on the basis of their beliefs or homosexuality. President Bush has 
indicated he will sign the bill. 
</P>
<P>
For California, which has about 54% of the nation's immigrants in the amnesty 
program, it would mean the legalization of many people who are already here 
illegally, and it could mean a chance for employers who have trouble attracting 
workers to import more people from overseas. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very smart bill," said Maria Hsiu, a co-chair of the Pacific 
Leadership Council, a Los Angeles-based national lobbying group of Asian 
business leaders and professionals. "Everybody is very happy." 
</P>
<P>
For two years, she said, a number of groups representing immigrants and 
business leaders have been in Washington buttonholing congressional 
representatives to hammer out a compromise on the complex issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked real, real hard," Hsiu said. "We went back to Washington once a 
month and walked from office to office to lobby this bill." 
</P>
<P>
About 500 members of Hermandad Mexicana Nacional, a Latino civil rights group, 
traveled from California, Illinois, Texas and New York to Washington this 
summer, said Nativo Lopez, executive director of the Orange County chapter. 
</P>
<P>
"We've watched this very carefully for two years," she said. "And we're now 
watching very closely the negotiations in the conference committee." 
</P>
<P>
The new law would remove prohibitions on some immigrants and would open the 
nation to many new immigrants who are skilled workers and managers. It would 
permit a total of 700,000 immigrants annually in 1992, 1993 and 1994, up from 
the current 500,000, and 675,000 a year thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
While it is difficult to quantify what that would mean for Orange County, which 
had the second highest number of amnesty applicants in California after Los 
Angeles, immigrant rights experts and lawyers who specialize in the field say 
the changes would be significant. 
</P>
<P>
The new mix of immigrants allowed to enter the country would include more 
skilled workers such as scientists and engineers, who are expected to be in 
short supply in the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Jim David Acoba, an immigration lawyer in Buena Park, said that Orange County, 
with its ever-expanding economy, would gain because employers would face a more 
streamlined process for importing much-needed technical workers such as those 
in the medical field, computer engineering and aircraft industries. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that as more companies that do business abroad locate here, there 
is a need for foreign professionals, such as lawyers, who could help the parent 
company understand the ways of doing business in a country with different laws 
and culture. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of businesses here that are extremely concerned about what is 
going to happen because, frankly, there are a lot of skills that we need here 
that we don't have workers for," said Acoba, who is also chairman of the 
immigration section of the Orange County Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 700,000 people allowed to enter in the first year, 465,000 would be 
relatives of American citizens and permanent resident aliens; 140,000 would be 
skilled workers or their close family members -- up 80,000 from the current 
levels; 40,000 would be residents of nations that have been allowed relatively 
few immigrants in recent years; and 55,000 would be spouses and children of 
aliens who gained legal status under the last major immigration reform law -- 
the amnesty bill -- in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The bill provides more generous quotas for immigrants from most countries, but 
it especially would open the nation's doors wider to Europeans, some Africans 
and other foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed change in the law would benefit a Filipino-born client of Acoba, 
who married her childhood sweetheart just before she became a U.S. citizen. She 
and her husband, who did not yet have his U.S. citizenship, adopted a daughter 
in the Philippines. But because the daughter had not lived with the mother the 
two years required by current immigration law for adopted children and the 
father's citizenship was also pending, they could not bring the daughter to 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Her application for a visa was placed on a waiting list that is seven years 
long, Acoba said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we now classify her as the child of a U.S. citizen under the proposed law, 
they should be able to apply and bring her over within about three months," he 
said. "The effect is drastic." 
</P>
<P>
The new law would also benefit Claro and Tayde Rojas of Santa Ana, natives of 
Mexico. The husband came to Orange County in 1980 and works at a company that 
builds irrigation systems. His wife and two children joined him four years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
He has obtained legal residency through the amnesty program, and two of their 
children born here since they arrived are also U.S. citizens. But Tayde Rojas 
and the other two children are not. 
</P>
<P>
If the new law passes, they too would be able to gain legal residency in a 
matter of months, something that would enable her to travel back and forth to 
Mexico to visit her parents, who have never met her two youngest children, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Claro Rojas, newly legalized himself, was among the group of delegates from the 
Orange County chapter of Hermandad Mexicana Nacional who traveled to Washington 
to lobby for the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"We went from building to building to speak with senators and congressmen," he 
said. "I thought it was very beautiful. We went to work for all the Latinos. I 
am very happy. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say to myself, 'Well, we are Mexican so they won't want to listen to 
us,' but they did. We would go once, and if they could not see us, we would ask 
what time we should come back. We would wake up at 5 in the morning to prepare 
for the meetings. Nativo told us, 'Tomorrow when you see on television that 
they passed this bill, it will be because of you."' 
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Kathryn E. Terry, a board member of the Orange County Coalition for 
Immigrant Rights, said she is pleased that this proposal would clear the way 
for more employer-sanctioned immigration -- something she said the 1986 amnesty 
bill discouraged. But the part of the proposed new law she likes the best, she 
said, is that it emphasizes unity of citizens and legal residents with their 
immediate family members. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality is that in Orange County we still have a tremendous influx of 
illegal aliens, and not just Mexicans -- that's a misnomer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of law deals more with the reality that they are already here, so 
let's let them into our system and let them and us benefit from it," she said. 
"This kind of immigration policy also announces to the world what our national 
values and goals are, that we have a commitment to family unity and a 
commitment to pluralism."

MYSTERY OF THE DEEP: The extremely rare megamouth shark captured off Dana Point 
last week is only the latest in a series of local marine oddities. . . . Over 
the past two years, usually rare sea turtles, sea otters, huge Risso's 
dolphins, blue whale, sperm whale, minke whale, king salmon and giant squid 
have been sighted. On the other hand, normally plentiful sharks and white 
croakers are scarce. . . . What's going on? "I don't completely understand it," 
says marine biologist Dennis Kelly of Orange Coast College, who has monitored 
the county's sea life for 22 years. "Everyone wants answers, but we don't have 
them." Marla Cone and Steve Emmons

VOTER OFFICIAL PREDICTS 55-60% TURNOUT IN O.C. IF GOVERNOR'S RACE GOES TO WIRE 
</P>

Registrar of Voters Donald Tanney says a close governor's race between Sen. 
Pete Wilson and Dianne Feinstein, plus some controversial statewide and local 
ballot measures, could drive 55% to 60% of Orange County's 1,090,950 registered 
voters to the polls Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
If Tanney's prediction is correct, the turnout of more than half a million 
county voters in the general election would far surpass the 39% who turned out 
for the June 5 primary. But it would not be as good as the 77% turnout in 
November, 1988, the last presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect a turnout that is comparable to other gubernatorial elections," 
Tanney said. "It won't be as big as, say, the election turnouts in presidential 
years." 
</P>
<P>
In the last gubernatorial election in November, 1986, 60% of Orange County's 
registered voters went to the polls. In November, 1982, the turnout was 68%, 
good but significantly less than the 78% who voted in Orange County 1984 to 
elect Republican President Ronald Reagan to a second term. 
</P>
<P>
Tanney said his office's registration and elections division sent out a record 
117,000 absentee ballots for the coming election. Just 45,519 absentee ballots 
were returned in the November, 1986, general election, Tanney said then. 
</P>
<P>
"Absentee ballots are the wave of the future," he said. "They are convenient 
and give voters the opportunity to sit down and study and discuss the issues in 
the privacy of their homes." 
</P>
<P>
The registrar added that candidates, their campaigns and political parties are 
encouraging the use of absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
The number of registered voters in the county -- 1,090,954 -- is about at the 
same level as in 1986, Tanney said. It was at a high of 1,183,166 in the fall 
of 1988, when Republican George Bush was running against Democrat Michael S. 
Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans have a commanding lead in Orange County registration, with 606,889 
voters to the Democratic Party's 370,179. The remainder is made up of those who 
decline to state their party preference or who registered in smaller parties. 
</P>
<P>
In the June primary, the county registrar of voters predicted a 50% turnout, 
but just 39% showed up at the polls -- putting the county 50th among the 
state's 58 counties. Other Southern California counties did even worse, with 
Los Angeles ranked 57th, Riverside 55th, San Diego 54th and San Bernardino dead 
last. 
</P>
<P>
Experts said a lack of exciting races -- especially for Republicans, who had no 
contest for governor -- may have caused the low turnout statewide, especially 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Tanney, however, said he thinks that voters will crowd the polls Nov. 6 because 
of the close gubernatorial race and a multitude of hotly contested statewide 
propositions, such as Proposition 138, the so-called Big Green initiative, and 
Orange County's Measure M, a half-cent sales tax for county transportation 
projects.

SCHOOL OFFICIALS TO MONITOR PROP. 146 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
On Election Day, officials of the Santa Ana Unified School District will be 
paying close attention to the fate of Proposition 146, an $800-million 
statewide school construction bond measure that could give the district some 
much-needed financial help to build new schools. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the district's school board unanimously passed a resolution in 
support of the measure and later complained about the lack of attention the 
proposition has received. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ridiculous that the way a proposition gets passed has to do with the 
amount of money in the campaign war chest," school board President Audrey 
Yamagata-Noji said. "We don't have another viable funding measure, and passage 
of this proposition is critical for us in this community." 
</P>
<P>
Only about $35,000 has been available to run the statewide campaign for the 
proposition, said Peter Birdsall, campaign manager of the Sacramento-based "Yes 
on 146" campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very low figure to deal with," Birdsall said. "That amount is only a 
little more than what it costs to run a 30-second commercial on prime-time 
television." 
</P>
<P>
The district, the largest in Orange County with 43 schools, is in the midst of 
a $225-million school construction program that has schools being built at a 
rate of about two per year. 
</P>
<P>
The new schools are needed to house a student population that has been growing 
at a rate of about 1,000 students annually. The district has added hundreds of 
portable classrooms to school sites and has placed some schools on a year-round 
calendar to ease overcrowding.GREG HERNANDEZ

A PLACE FOR NEW ARTISTS TO BLOOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the past two months, a transformation has been occurring in the basement of 
the historic Santora Building. 
</P>
<P>
Young artists have been busy turning 6,400 square feet of what was once an 
empty basement into the Underground, an art gallery and studio designed to 
serve as a haven for aspiring artists from the inner city who are looking for a 
chance to create art and have their work displayed. 
</P>
<P>
The Underground is the dream of Greg Johnson, a 36-year-old Long Beach man who 
said he is determined to give disadvantaged young people a chance to realize 
their artistic potential. 
</P>
<P>
"The Van Goghs are out there, the Michelangelos are out there," Johnson said. 
"How many of them are falling through the cracks because they don't have a 
chance to develop their talent?" 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Johnson formed the Society for Economic and Environmental Development, 
a nonprofit corporation that sought to get underprivileged youths off the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
The Underground is the corporation's first venture. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to give them a vehicle," Johnson said. "A lot of the young artists 
don't have a vehicle in which to express themselves. Most galleries aren't apt 
to look at a young artist unless they have an agent behind them." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's longtime dream of opening the Underground finally began to take form 
earlier this year when he was able to rent the basement of the Santora Building 
at a reduced monthly rate of $6,400. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Johnson said, he has spent a sizable amount of his own savings on the 
venture but is hoping to garner both corporate and city financial support in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
Once the studio is ready, Johnson said, it will have room for up to 40 young 
artists to work on their paintings, sculptures and other projects. 
Additionally, they will have a place to socialize with other young artists. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Morgan, an art teacher at Santa Ana High School, said a place like this 
has been needed for some time. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan said many of her former students come to visit her after graduation and 
say they are frustrated about not having a place to work or the opportunity to 
have their work noticed. 
</P>
<P>
Since finding out about the Underground, Morgan has encouraged some of the 
youths to become involved. 
</P>
<P>
One of her former students, Raul Garcia, has been spending up to seven hours a 
day at the Underground since September. He and a handful of other young artists 
have been helping Johnson prepare for the facility's grand opening on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
From Morgan's standpoint, a place that can provide youngsters with an identity 
and a sense of belonging is sorely needed. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a lot of dreams and aspirations," Morgan said. "There needs to be 
some steppingstones out there for them. I hope the Underground will prove to be 
that steppingstone." GREG HERNANDEZ

COUNCIL TO CONSIDER VAGRANT ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council this week will consider an ordinance that would allow police 
to cite transients sleeping on private property without first warning them to 
move along. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Neil Purcell said the law is needed to help officers handle 
trespassing vagrants who have become "a big problem" in the community. 
</P>
<P>
Police have on file about 250 letters from residents who want police action and 
are willing to testify in court against trespassers. 
</P>
<P>
"We find them in the doorways of businesses, we find them on balconies, 
alcoves, you name it," said Police Capt. Bill Cavanaugh, who drafted the 
ordinance. In one instance, a transient camped on Irvine Co. land next to the 
city long enough to harvest three crops before he was caught, Cavanaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they had previously cited transients without warning, but a recent 
change in state law requires police to first give trespassers a chance to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, when a homeowner is away, a transient will start a fire or light 
a barbecue to keep warm, or even break into a home to sleep in a bed, Purcell 
said. "They'll burrow underneath the home if they're right off the ocean 
front," Purcell said. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SMOG ALERT CALLED IN NORTHERN COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coastal fog that pushed its way inland caused a first-stage smog alert in 
portions of northern Orange County on Sunday after it mixed with smog trapped 
by a high pressure system that is expected to remain until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Low clouds are being kept close to the ground because of a shallow inversion 
layer that is making the clouds produce the fog," said Stephen Burback, a 
meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., which forecasts the weather for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Burback said the high pressure system will remain over Southern California for 
at least another day, creating the unusual fog-and-smog mixture that wreaked 
havoc with Orange County motorists over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Once the fog lifts, high temperatures are expected in the low- to mid-80s, with 
some cooling expected by mid-week, Burback said. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Santa Ana reported a warm 83 degrees after the fog lifted. Newport 
Beach, which spent much of Sunday under a thick blanket of fog, was 68 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim had a high of 85 and San Juan Capistrano had an 81. 
</P>
<P>
In Brea, morning fog gave way to a smoggy afternoon "that never cleared up," 
said Brea Fire Department Capt. Paul Bartley. 
</P>
<P>
Although the air quality was unhealthful, it resulted in few calls from 
residents with respiratory illnesses, Bartley said. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District posted the first-stage smog 
alert at 3 p.m. Sunday after the Pollutants Standard Index (PSI) level reached 
205. The PSI measures the amount of pollutants in the air, whether ozone, 
carbon monoxide or nitrogen dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
"Unhealthful for sensitive people" warnings occur when the PSI registers from 
101 to 199. A first-stage smog alert, meaning the air is unhealthful for 
everyone, occurs when the PSI registers 200 to 275. 
</P>
<P>
The high-pressure system should start shifting east by mid-week, Burback said, 
and Hurricane Trudy, which brought three- to five-foot breakers on south-facing 
beaches over the weekend, is also expected to help clear out the smog. 
</P>
<P>
Trudy, with winds well over 100 knots, is about 1,000 miles west of the tip of 
Baja, Mexico, and about 1,200 miles south of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"The lid holding the pollution and the fog would be pretty much gone in maybe 
one more day, or possibly a second day before a northern storm moves down the 
coast," Burback said. DAVID REYES

A 19-year-old Westminster man suffered a skull fracture during a fight in the 
parking lot of a 7-Eleven store early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they answered a call about a fight at Newland Street and Warner 
Avenue at 1:20 a.m. and found Robert Rounsefell unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
He was listed in critical but stable condition Sunday at Humana 
Hospital-Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives interviewed witnesses and people involved in the fight, but no 
arrests were made Sunday. Information on the cause of the fight was not 
available from police. 
</P>
<P>
A clerk at the store said that two people were involved and that they were 
beating and kicking each other, but he didn't know what the fight was about.

MIKE PENNER: HOW ABOUT MINNESOTA ANTEATERS?

You can't always get what you want, so for the next basketball season, Orange 
County's NBA expansion seekers will have to content themselves with the Bill 
Musselman Compromise, which specifically states: 
</P>
<P>
1. Orange County will be granted an NBA franchise. 
</P>
<P>
2. It will play its home games in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Starting at one forward will be Tod Murphy, formerly of UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Coming off the bench at another forward will be Johnny Rogers, formerly of UC 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Checking in at backup point guard will be Scott Brooks, also formerly of UC 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
And, filling out the roster as designated three-point pistol -- final cut 
willing -- will be Leon Wood, formerly of Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Ladies and gentlemen, your 1990-91 Minnesota Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
Or, as Brooks calls them, "The Orange County All-Stars." 
</P>
<P>
A quick background check of Musselman, the Timberwolves' head coach, indicates 
no just cause for regional prejudice. He did not graduate from UC Irvine. He 
does not owe Bill Mulligan money. 
</P>
<P>
But if they ever peeled off a rebound or knocked down a bank shot in some 
Orange County gymnasium, Musselman had them coming to his summer rookie camp. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Engelstad (UC Irvine, 1984-88) showed up. So did Richard Morton (Cal 
State Fullerton, 1984-88). Ronnie Grandison (UC Irvine, 1983-84) impressed 
Musselman enough to get invited to the Wolves' September training camp, where 
he was cut two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"And now there are rumors of a trade for Bob Thornton (UC Irvine, 1982-84, and 
Philadelphia 76ers, present)," says Bill Robertson, the Wolves' director of 
public relations. "People keep asking me, 'Where is this UC Irvine?' They're 
starting to call us 'the UC Timberwolves.' " 
</P>
<P>
Robertson, by the way, is a graduate of Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Of course. 
</P>
<P>
Musselman has succeeded in updating Horace Greeley. "Go North, West man," is 
the new rallying cry for the Have Jump Shot, Will Travel crowd -- and has been 
ever since Minnesota rejoined the NBA and named Musselman to head the talent 
search. 
</P>
<P>
An expansion team in Minnesota meant more work for those on the play-for-pay 
periphery and Musselman as coach meant good news for anyone who played for or 
against him in the Continental Basketball Assn. As veterans of Musselman's old 
Albany Patroons, Murphy and Brooks had easy ins. Once aboard, Murphy and Brooks 
told Musselman about Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
And Wood? 
</P>
<P>
He'll play anywhere anyone will have him. Last season, that took Wood from one 
coast (the CBA's Santa Barbara Islanders) to the other (the NBA's New Jersey 
Nets). Now, he's attempting to find the middle ground. 
</P>
<P>
In Minnesota, Wood is a long shot, which is both his blessing and his curse. 
The Wolves need a three-point shooter and Wood fits the bill, but he hasn't 
played much in the exhibition season and has just three more days to persuade 
Musselman to keep him and not Tim Legler or Doug West or Anthony Bowie. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters III appear in better standing. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy played in all 82 games of the Wolves' inaugural season -- starting most 
-- and averaged 8.3 points and 6.9 rebounds. His job is all hard hat -- guard 
the other guy's best big man, trade some elbows, count those bruises -- and 
he's expected to keep it until he requires traction. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks, beginning his third NBA season, came over in a June trade with 
Philadelphia, in exchange for a No. 2 draft choice. He's a mini-Murphy -- he 
doesn't mind diving on the floor and at 5-11, he's a lot closer to it -- which 
Musselman has admired since their days together in Albany. 
</P>
<P>
And, no, Brooks insists, it has nothing to do with looks and, no, he is not 
Musselman's long lost son, an ongoing tease since his arrival in the Twin 
Cities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an insult," Brooks says, feigning outrage. "I'm sooo much better looking 
than he is. He's a feisty little guy and he's blond, like me, but I'm too tall 
to be in his family. He's only 5-7." 
</P>
<P>
Rogers, just off the plane from Spain, is closing in on the sixth and final 
forward position. His competition is Gary Leonard, a Wolves holdover, but 
Leonard lacks Rogers' outside shooting touch. Rogers averaged 23 points while 
playing last season for Valencia in Spain's top division of professional 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect to make the team," Rogers says, but adds, warily, "although with 
Musselman, you never know. He could go out tomorrow and bring in three new 
guys. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm on the fringe, but right now, it looks like I'm going to make it. From 
there, I'd like to get into the top eight or nine. Musselman plays eight men 
deep and I've got to get into that top eight." 
</P>
<P>
The simple fact that all three are this close, still teammates after all these 
years, is, in Brooks' words, "pretty incredible. It's mind-boggling." 
</P>
<P>
"Irvine is not a powerhouse. But here we are -- three Irvine guys on the same 
professional basketball team. You could see that happening with Vegas or 
Georgetown, one of the big schools, but UC Irvine?" 
</P>
<P>
One question begets another. 
</P>
<P>
How come this triumvirate couldn't manage more than a 17-13 record and a 
second-round NIT ouster when it was assembled in front of Mulligan during the 
1985-86 season? 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to say," Rogers admits. "We had a lot of talent. Besides us, there 
was Wayne Engelstad, JoJo Buchanan, a top guard, and Mike Hess. It was a real 
frustrating year. We beat Las Vegas twice, we beat UCLA, but we lost three 
times to Fullerton and we lost to Oral Roberts at home. We were very 
inconsistent." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks has a theory. 
</P>
<P>
"John and Tod were just not very good then," he deadpans. "I hate to admit it." 
</P>
<P>
But seriously . . . 
</P>
<P>
"John, Tod and myself were not half the players then that we are now," Brooks 
says. "We have to be. You can't make the NBA any other way. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can bad-mouth Mulligan. We all could've played better. We 
could've played better defense. We were fun to watch, we ran up and down the 
court, but we could have done a much better job on defense." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks thinks a moment. 
</P>
<P>
"Then again," he continues, "we might not have been capable of playing better 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
Now, they stand to hold Anteater reunions all over the country, from Seattle to 
San Antonio to Charlotte, 82 nights over the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
They don't stop in Anaheim or Santa Ana, but there's always cable. At long 
last, Orange County has an NBA team to call its own, even if it has to call 
long-distance to do so.

SISTERS BIG HIT AT LAGUNA BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
VOLLEYBALL: ASHLEY AND RACHEL WACHOLDER HAVE LED THE ARTISTS TO A 16-4 RECORD 
THIS SEASON AND A NO. 3 RANKING IN THE COUNTY COACHES' POLL.

LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ashley and Rachel Wacholder grew up on the beach, so it only makes sense that 
they spent most of their time surfing and playing volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
But the strand of sand offered a different temptation for the sisters -- a soft 
landing pad for the favorite sport of their youth . . . gymnastics. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to go out on the beach and practice all the time," Ashley Wacholder 
said. "We were completely dedicated to gymnastics." 
</P>
<P>
But that all changed six years ago, when Ashley joined the Orange County 
volleyball club as a seventh-grader. She quit gymnastics after the summer of 
her eighth-grade year, devoting most of her time to volleyball and soccer. 
</P>
<P>
"We practiced gymnastics 5 to 9 p.m. four days a week," Ashley said. "I 
remember going to soccer practice, then straight to gymnastics. My mom was like 
a taxi driver, taking us to all the practices. 
</P>
<P>
"We spent so much time in gymnastics, we would only come to the (volleyball) 
tournaments." 
</P>
<P>
Rachel said: "Gymnastics was like major commitment. It was taking up so much of 
our time. That's why we quit." 
</P>
<P>
And Laguna Beach High School volleyball fans are glad they did. 
</P>
<P>
The sisters have led the Artists to a 16-4 record this season and a No. 3 
ranking in the Orange County coaches' poll. 
</P>
<P>
Their club coach, Charlie Brande, calls them "the leading hitting combination 
of sisters in Southern Section history." 
</P>
<P>
Ashley, a 5-foot-9 senior, averages 16 kills per match. Rachel, a 5-7 
sophomore, averages 12. 
</P>
<P>
As a freshman, Rachel was honorable mention all-Pacific Coast League in 
volleyball. She also finished ninth at the Southern Section diving meet last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
But Rachel keeps her diving in perspective. She has been diving competitively 
since the second grade, but says it takes a back seat to volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll miss diving meets to go to volleyball (club) practice," Rachel said. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach Coach Lance Stewart said the Wacholders' multiple sports 
backgrounds have made them better volleyball players. 
</P>
<P>
"They have good hand-eye coordination and they always seem to be in control of 
what they're doing," said Stewart, who played football, basketball and 
volleyball at Laguna Beach. "They're never off-balance when they're going up 
for the ball. I would just as soon have three three-sport athletes on the court 
all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Rachel and Ashley realize volleyball is their future, their ticket to college. 
Ashley is being recruited by several schools, including Duke, Loyola Marymount 
and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a Division I player, no doubt about it," Stewart said. "She's really, 
really solid. She's not as tall as a lot of college recruiters would like, but 
hits as hard as any high school girl I've seen this year. She can jump and 
touch 9-feet-11, and I don't know of any high school girls doing that." 
</P>
<P>
Ashley played volleyball as a freshman and sophomore at St. Margaret's before 
transferring to Laguna Beach. Rachel came along, too. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like I had outgrown St. Margaret's," Ashley said of the small Catholic 
school in San Juan Capistrano. "I had been going there since the third grade." 
</P>
<P>
Southern Section rules required Ashley to sit out her junior year because of 
the transfer, so she practiced with the varsity and played with the junior 
varsity while her sister played with the varsity. 
</P>
<P>
"Ashley was no doubt the best junior varsity player in the state last year," 
Brande said. 
</P>
<P>
So Ashley sat on the sidelines and watched her younger sister play. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the toughest thing," Ashley said. "I cried when he (Stewart) would 
put her in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Ashley made a quick impression when she joined the Artists this fall. 
</P>
<P>
She had 40 kills and Rachel added 21 in the Orange County championship final 
against La Habra. The Artists lost, but Ashley was named to the all-tournament 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"Ashley came in and did a great job right away," Stewart said. "Rachel's 
improving all the time. She's only a sophomore, and I sometimes forget that. 
She's one of the best left-side attackers in the county. She can put the ball 
away."

THE REAL BRITAIN WAS NOT SEEN IN ARTS FESTIVAL; 
</P>
<P>
THE ORANGE COUNTY CELEBRATION WAS MORE A RETAIL PROMOTION THAN A CULTURAL 
EVENT.

Item: British crafts people who gambled a chunk of money to fly overseas and 
rent booths at "Chelsea Comes to California," a Festival of Britain event at 
South Coast Plaza's Crystal Court, watched glumly while a trickle of visitors 
gawked politely at what they assumed was a museum show. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, no one had informed Orange County viewers that the jewelry, 
clothing, furniture and objets d'art on view, selected by a panel of British 
crafts professionals, were for sale. Although the confusion eventually cleared 
up, a week after the event opened several booth occupants were only guardedly 
optimistic about whether the event was worth the trip. 
</P>
<P>
At the original Chelsea Crafts Fair in London, named for the chichi district 
where the event has been held for the past decade, there is no confusion. 
People come to buy, just as they do at any other crafts fair. 
</P>
<P>
It is amusing that the Festival of Britain -- whose marketing folks kept 
insisting they were putting on a real arts festival, not a just a consumer 
goods promotion -- managed to obscure the straightforward commercialism of 
"Chelsea" in a misty haze of high culture. 
</P>
<P>
Item: About half of the objects in "British Design 1790-1990" -- an exhibit of 
British crafts organized by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London -- were 
made during the past two years, and many were lent directly by the designer or 
manufacturer, not the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1988 appointment of Elizabeth Esteve-Coll as director of the museum, 
the revered institution -- founded in 1852 and known for its extraordinary 
collection of medieval-to-modern objects and preparatory studies for works of 
art -- has suffered radical changes. 
</P>
<P>
The changes include exhibitions revealing closer -- some would say incestuous 
-- ties with commercial firms, a far greater stress on pop culture and 
contemporary life in general (the current show is a 40-year retrospective of 
couturier Pierre Cardin), and a reorganization of the staff that overrides the 
expertise of trained and experienced curators. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1989 article in the New York Review of Books, "The Fall of a Great 
Museum," eminent scholar John Pope-Hennessey, a former director of the museum, 
accused Esteve-Coll of being "a relentless vulgarizer," an administrator 
(rather than an academic) who is merely a tool of the philistine trustees of 
the museum, appointed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
For an annual visitor to Britain, the notion of a Festival of Britain poses a 
conundrum: Which Britain are they celebrating -- the real one or the fond 
concoction of some PR office? 
</P>
<P>
Is it the average American tourist's rose-colored set of half-truths -- a land 
where a Queen still rules, tweedy individuals with fancy titles own rambling 
country estates packed with chintz-covered furniture, universities are 
ivy-twined bastions of plummy privilege, people drink tea and pick daintily at 
clotted cream and crustless sandwiches every afternoon, judges in the courts 
still wear wigs, fancifully costumed guards stand at attention at the Tower of 
London and trilling accents make every word sound like Shakespeare? 
</P>
<P>
Or is it the Britain where centuries of stuffy privilege have ceded authority 
to a legion of go-getters and self-starters? A country where, as many critics 
allege, Conservative Party leadership has introduced a cynical dog-eat-dog 
mentality -- in which government funding of social welfare and arts 
organizations is dramatically slashed, a poll tax is levied on homeowner and 
poverty-level renter alike and yuppie greed has replaced altruistic concern? 
</P>
<P>
Is it a country fighting a civil war with inhabitants of Northern Ireland? A 
country serviced by Third World street cleaners and dishwashers? A land where 
artistic vitality is fueled at street level by the descendants of '70s punk 
bands and the dogged survival of anti-Establishment "fringe" theater groups? 
</P>
<P>
Unsurprisingly, the noisiest emphasis in the festival was on hoary tradition 
and snazzy contemporary trends. 
</P>
<P>
The rose-colored crowd got its "300 years of British pomp and pageantry" at 
South Coast Plaza in the guise of a group of ceremonial royal robes, a sampling 
of teatime treats, a Rolls-Royce balanced on Wedgwood teacups, an "authentic 
London taxicab" and a visit from Princess Alexandra. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County nouveau riche contingent -- who'd likely be Thatcher 
supporters if they lived Over There -- presumably got their jollies from 
various consumer goods events, including the British design show, a model house 
equipped with British goods, and a series of lectures on business-related 
topics. 
</P>
<P>
But anti-Thatcher voices were in notably short supply, despite their 
significant role in British arts today. We heard from their corner only in 
indirect ways. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Cragg's sculptures at Newport Harbor Art Museum are often made of 
fragments of industrial refuse, sometimes resembling distorted natural forms or 
science lab tools. With the exception of his vast wall relief, "Riot" -- a 
brilliantly "common" reconceptualizing of a type of imagery found in ancient 
Roman reliefs, using bits and pieces of old plastic objects -- Cragg's work may 
appear to be apolitical. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the diverse appearance of the sculptures Cragg has produced over 
the past 15 years, his work overwhelmingly indicates a belief in a 
relativistic, unpredictable universe, knowable only by direct personal 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the sculptures are made of humble castoffs reimagined into new forms. 
Other pieces are large-scale bronzes that -- contrary to the solid majesty of 
the medium -- have a loosely experimental quality. In his refusal to 
acknowledge hierarchies of subject matter and materials or assumptions of 
stylistic integrity, he flies in the face of the conservative preference for 
works of art (and social groups) that are neatly defined and know their place. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Onslow-Ford, whose visionary paintings (in "Pursuit of the Marvelous" at 
the Laguna Art Museum) have as little as possible to do with things of this 
world, loathed the strictures and stuffiness of England of the 1920s, as he 
said in a recent interview. As a young man he happily turned his back on his 
native land for the delights of Paris, Mexico and Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley William Hayter, a painter and experimental etcher also in "Pursuit of 
the Marvelous," was an avowed leftist who used his art to support the 
Loyalists' cause during the Spanish Civil War. He died in 1988, a year before 
Thatcher took office. 
</P>
<P>
Calum Colvin and Ron O'Donnell, showing installations and large-scale 
photographs at Cal State Fullerton, send up some ingrained attitudes of their 
fellow Scots in gentle ways. But the biting edge of Scottish nationalism, the 
barely controlled fury at what is perceived as economic favoritism of Southern 
Britain, is not discernible in their work. 
</P>
<P>
The one imported British theater offering, Alan Plater's "Sweet Sorrow" at the 
Irvine Barclay Theatre, performed by the Hull Truck Theatre, had a distinctly 
literary theme (the poetry of Philip Larkin) without significant political 
overtones. 
</P>
<P>
And of course the tripping melodies and devilishly clever rhymes of Gilbert and 
Sullivan's "The Mikado" and "The Pirates of Penzance" -- the D'Oyly Carte Opera 
Company's offerings at the Performing Arts Center -- are products of the 19th 
Century. Even back then, the benign anti-Establishment digs that pepper the 
lyrics were perceived as simply jolly good fun. 
</P>
<P>
It looks like the only place we can hope to hear the authentic voice of British 
liberals looking for a return of basic values will be South Coast Repertory's 
West Coast premiere of David Hare's "The Secret Rapture," which I saw a couple 
of years ago in London. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the play is a genuinely saintly woman, Isobel, who owns a 
small commercial art firm. Her sister Marion is a coldly calculating junior 
minister in the Conservative Party; Marion's husband is an impossibly unctuous 
born-again Christian who runs an outfit called Christians in Business. When 
Isobel's and Marion's alcoholic mother needs help, everyone's true colors are 
revealed. 
</P>
<P>
Hare has said that he doesn't see the play in political terms, which doesn't 
mitigate its power: Art is most effective when it doesn't clobber viewers over 
the head with a bag full of propaganda. But Isobel's painfully lonely position 
-- her refusal to make life easy for herself by capitulating to the 
opportunistic folks around her -- says a lot about the temper of the times in 
today's Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe you're thinking it would have been unrealistic to expect a festival 
partially sponsored by the British government and British corporations to bite 
the hands that feed it. But that's one of the difficulties of having a cultural 
festival enrobed within a retail promotion (in itself, a concept that reeks of 
Thatcherism). 
</P>
<P>
Had the festival been the brainchild of a cultural group or a Peter 
Sellars-style impresario, had it been conceived solely as an arts event -- with 
input from a broad range of British arts groups, large and small, radical and 
mainstream -- we'd have stood a better chance of understanding the real 
Britain, and the overwhelming social tensions confronting it today.

LIFE OF THE DEAD MAN'S PARTY ON MEADOWS LAWN; 
</P>
<P>
FANS: FOR MANY, A NIGHT OF SLAM-DANCING AND PUMPKIN HURLING IS AS ENTERTAINING 
AS THE CONCERT.

It was indeed a Dead Man's Party on the lawn at Irvine Meadows Amphitheater on 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Without the restriction of seats, the hordes of almost-fanatical Oingo Boingo 
fans acted out their darker impulses, slam-dancing to "Only a Lad," spraying 
each other with florescent paint throughout the night and screaming wildly each 
time the spotlights panned across the lawn. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the place to be. It's crazy," said Nick Strickland, 20, a.k.a. the Bum 
From Hell, of Canyon Lake. 
</P>
<P>
Like many others who packed the lawn Saturday for the second night of Oingo 
Boingo's three-day pre-Halloween stand, Strickland and his buddies from Cal 
State Fullerton have made the trek to Irvine a not-to-be-missed 
Halloween-season ritual. This was Strickland's fourth annual pilgrimage. 
</P>
<P>
Although the concert date was four days shy of Oct. 31, many dedicated Boingo 
fans remained true to the 5-year-old tradition and dressed up in costumes that 
ranged from the wacky to the weird. 
</P>
<P>
"I had my costume ready (for Halloween) and thought it would be fun," said 
Brenda Stewart, 21, of Lake Elsinore, who dressed up as a red-caped devil. 
</P>
<P>
Interspersed with witches, ghouls and skeletons were chickens, caped crime 
fighters, cave men and yes, even Homer and Marge Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
One unlucky tennis player with bloodied tennis balls embedded in his face and 
chest and a broken racket hanging from his neck wished everyone a happy 
Halloween as they filed in. 
</P>
<P>
The slanted lawn at Irvine Meadows is much like the bleachers at Boston's 
Fenway Park, where the seating area itself is as much a happening as the event. 
</P>
<P>
Before the music started, one couple wearing florescent skeleton masks passed 
out lollipops to fellow concert-goers who were smacking beach balls around and 
tossing glowing Frisbees that sported bats and otherworldly images. 
</P>
<P>
"We love Oingo Boingo," said Cliff (who declined to give his last name) of 
Canoga Park as he weaved his way through the growing crowd and pulled candies 
from his trick-or-treat bag. His wife, Jaylene, chimed in, "We are trying to 
make this a family tradition." 
</P>
<P>
The party started long before the concert did. 
</P>
<P>
Drawn by a weeklong promotion by KROQ-FM morning disc jockeys Kevin Ryder and 
Gene (Bean) Baxter, hundreds of concert-goers arrived early at the parking lot 
to watch a 480-pound pumpkin be hurled from a 100-foot platform. 
</P>
<P>
"It was awesome," said Thomas Harper, 27, of Orange. "It just went splat." 
</P>
<P>
Harper explained the band's draw. 
</P>
<P>
"They are a Southern California band and they've been around for so long. And 
(lead singer) Danny Elfman is a genius." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Yenzer, a Cal Poly engineering student, agreed. Dressed as a crash dummy, 
Yenzer, 23, arrived at Irvine Meadows in a large tour bus with 25 friends from 
Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it," said Yenzer, a three-time Halloween Bash veteran. "You get to come 
out, drink beer, dress up and go crazy."

Friday night's concert by the Empire Brass was a study in contradictions, of 
virtuosity with amateurism, of calculated effect with aggressive overstatement, 
of variety with monotony. The concert -- the first presentation of the Orange 
County Philharmonic Society in the new Irvine Barclay Theatre -- was nothing if 
not frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
The program itself turned out to be a miscalculation. It consisted of a 
hodgepodge string of hit tunes, jazz, Broadway, classical, mostly short and 
mostly upbeat. It was like eating dessert all evening. "Summertime," Polovstian 
Dances, Peer Gynt . . . 
</P>
<P>
The players -- Rolf Smedvig and Jeffrey Curnow, trumpets; Eric Ruske, horn; 
Scott A. Hartman, trombone; J. Samuel Pilafian, tuba -- stand center stage 
while performing, bells (even the French horn's) pointed directly at the 
audience. Forget subtlety. They play the music aggressively, expertly, loudly. 
They don't persuade, they slam home their points with gusto. 
</P>
<P>
As intermission approached, one of the players announced that the group's 
compact discs would be on sale in the lobby. When intermission arrived, there 
were the players themselves selling them. At $15 a pop. 
</P>
<P>
Smedvig announced that both his music and his tuxedo had been stolen from his 
hotel room. He appeared in shirt-sleeves and played from memory. He also showed 
fatigue as the concert progressed. The group's arrangements (the program 
consisted of nothing but arrangements, all uncredited) reveal little variety of 
timbre, all of the musicians playing most of the time. It becomes fatiguing to 
the ear. And Smedvig, who played lead all evening, grew tired. Why not allow 
Curnow a few numbers? 
</P>
<P>
They play well, both individually and as a group. Hartman impressed with his 
slippery smooth solo in "Caravan." Ruske had two extended features in a row, 
revealing muscle and flexibility. Smedvig dashed up and down the trumpet all 
night. Pilafian contributed some dazzling low-note comedy. But the whole was 
definitely less than its parts.

MOZART CAMERATA LAUNCHES 11TH SEASON ON HIGH NOTE

<P>
Beginning its 11th season with a concert at St. Andrew's Presbyterian 
Auditorium, the Mozart Camerata continued to shine with the same polish that 
has distinguished previous appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Music Director Ami Porat bills his ensemble as a "Classical Orchestra," and 
though the selections do not always fall into that historical period, the 
transparent clarity associated with that era is a hallmark of this group. 
Friday night, a program of Rossini, Beethoven and Mozart emerged clean, precise 
and energetic, admirably controlled despite echoey acoustics in the church. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Daniel Pollack joined the orchestra as the protagonist in Beethoven's 
"Emperor" Concerto. Pollack is perhaps best known to the general public for his 
prize-winning, pyrotechnic ghost performance (for actress Amy Irving) of 
Prokofiev's Third Concerto in the movie "The Competition." He brought the same 
technical mastery to serve an abundantly lyrical reading of the fifth Beethoven 
concerto. 
</P>
<P>
Beethoven offers the pianist a wealth of opportunity for virtuosic display in 
this work. But Pollack emphasized beauty over bravura, even in some of the most 
tempting chordal passages of the opening movement. And while the pianist drew 
less contrast between lyric and tense sections than did his orchestral cohorts, 
he nevertheless held appealing command. 
</P>
<P>
There were some exciting moments of abandon in Pollack's performance -- 
larger-than-life chordal sections and fiery scale passages with which to close 
the Rondo. Still, his caressing attention to a naturally unfolding, sweeping 
line in the Poco adagio, defined by thoughtfully weighting each note, created 
the most lasting impression. 
</P>
<P>
On their part, orchestral members brought the same spirit to their well-honed 
machine that characterized their reading of Rossini's Overture to "L'Inganno 
Felice" and Mozart's "Linz" Symphony. Porat knows how to demand a gracefully 
majestic phrase and still keep overall structure in sight. As witnessed 
particularly by the symphony, he seems to encourage sympathetic listening among 
his players, both individually and in sections. The piece shimmered with an 
illuminating interplay of lines defined by apt control of dynamics and accent, 
all unhindered by even the most vigorous of presto finales.

EARTHQUAKE FORECAST SENDS SHIVERS THROUGH HEARTLAND; 
</P>

SCIENCE: AN ECCENTRIC SCIENTIST'S PROJECTION HAS MANY IN THE MIDWEST AND SOUTH 
PREPARING FOR THEIR BIG ONE.

NEW MADRID, Mo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's no one alive who remembers the last big earthquake here, it happened so 
long ago. 
</P>
<P>
For that very reason, residents don't get shaken up by talk of tremors, even 
though scientists have been warning for years that the heartland is due for a 
doozy. 
</P>
<P>
This monster quake, seismologists say, could be the worst natural disaster in 
American history. The losses could be staggering. Still, folks sitting right on 
top of the potentially deadly New Madrid Fault only yawned. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I see it, if you're gonna die, you're gonna die," convenience store 
clerk Laura Holmes said the other day, echoing the sentiments of other stoic 
Missourians who have refused to let fear dominate their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Folks hereabouts still say such things -- they are, after all, Missourians -- 
but show-me-state residents tend to say them while buying earthquake insurance, 
storing up supplies and holding disaster drills. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout a huge portion of the Midwest and South, people who formerly 
shrugged off talk of earthquakes now are frantically making preparations for 
the Big One -- all because an eccentric scientist from New Mexico predicted a 
50-50 chance of a quake of magni tude of 7.0 or greater occurring here between 
Dec. 1 and Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
"To me it's a lot like dying," said New Madrid (pronounced MAD-rid) Mayor Dick 
Phillips, trying to explain the sudden, uncharacteristic wave of anxiety in a 
large part of the central United States. "If you know when you're going to die, 
the closer you get to that date you'll make preparations." 
</P>
<P>
Although a few seismologists who have studied Iben Browning's forecasting 
techniques take him seriously, most dismiss his projections out of hand. But 
that hasn't stopped school districts in a number of communities near here from 
announcing that their doors will be closed Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Small towns throughout the Mississippi Valley have been holding meetings to 
prepare their residents. And town officials in nearby Malden, Mo., plan to shut 
down the 51-year-old city hall for an eight-day "earthquake drill." All 
municipal operations will be moved into a sturdier fire station for the 
duration. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider it a deathtrap," Malden Mayor W. M. (Bill) Johnson said of the city 
hall. As for the fire station, he said: "I hate like the dickens to be in 
there, but it's better than nothing. I don't want to be here." 
</P>
<P>
People are reacting to Browning's forecast as far north as Chicago, 450 miles 
away from the New Madrid Fault, where even a major quake is not expected to 
have much effect. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had earthquake insurance on my house," said Roger Spencer, a vice 
president at PaineWebber Inc. in Chicago, "but I've put it on now. And I don't 
plan on being in the tall (PaineWebber headquarters) building on Dec. 3." 
</P>
<P>
Spencer's office is on the 38th floor of the downtown skyscraper. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care what anybody else does," he said with a chuckle, "but I ain't 
going to be there. The worst that can happen to me is that everybody will call 
me a chicken. If that's the worst that happens, I can live with that." 
</P>
<P>
Browning, a 72-year-old scientist and business consultant who lives in Sandia 
Park, N.M., started the commotion with his 5-year-old forecast. It was released 
to the media by a business client last year. 
</P>
<P>
Actually what Browning forecast was that there is a good chance of a 
cataclysmic occurrence somewhere in the world between the 60 degrees north and 
30 degrees north latitudes within 48 hours either way of Dec. 3. It could be 
the New Madrid Fault. It could be the San Andreas Fault. It could be a 
devastating quake in Tokyo. Or it might not be an earthquake at all; it might 
be a volcanic eruption at any of four locations in the United States and 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't project things categorically," said Spencer, the PaineWebber vice 
president, who has known Browning for years and whose firm had hired him as a 
consultant until recently, when Browning's health began to fail. "He just says 
that if something's ready to go off, if there's a bullet in the chamber, the 
tidal forces on that date might be the trigger that will ignite it." 
</P>
<P>
Browning, through a spokeswoman, declined to be interviewed for this article, 
but seismologists who have studied his methods say his projections -- he 
eschews the word "prediction" -- have been uncannily accurate in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Using a highly sophisticated computer analysis of tidal forces, he accurately 
forecast last October's San Francisco earthquake, the Mexico City quake of 
1986, the Mt. St. Helens volcanic eruption in 1980 and the San Fernando quake 
in 1971, said Michael D. Coe, co-director of the Center for Earthquake Studies 
at Southeast Missouri State University. 
</P>
<P>
Browning publicly mentioned the time and location of the Bay Area earthquake at 
an industrial equipment industry convention in San Francisco a week before it 
happened, according to people who attended the conference. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times after the Oct. 17 earthquake, Browning said he 
told the group of his projection to "lend a certain amount of credibility" to 
his work. But he said he hesitated to go public because "if you go about saying 
this on street corners it could cause a riot and panic." 
</P>
<P>
Even though he forecast the quake, he said he was shaken when it occurred. "I 
wept," he said. "There is no scientific attitude toward disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Browning's forecasts aren't limited to geological occurrences. 
</P>
<P>
He was hired to share his views on a myriad of subjects with PaineWebber's 
clients, Spencer said. "He was talking about the disintegration of the Eastern 
Bloc many years ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A panel of scientists who studied Browning's forecast for the U.S. Geological 
Survey dismissed the earthquake prediction as having no scientific basis. 
</P>
<P>
Brian J. Mitchell, a seismologist from St. Louis University, added that 
"studies of the correlation between earthquake and tides have been done a 
number of times in the past and the results have always been mixed." 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that on or about Dec. 3 the Northern Hemisphere will experience 
a peak in tidal forces -- one of the strongest in years. "There'll be a lineup 
of the sun and the moon on that day," Mitchell said. "They'll both be pulling 
together." But he said that neither of the last two New Madrid earthquakes that 
were magnitude 6.0 or higher occurred at a tidal peak. And he said that while 
the largest earthquake in the nation's history -- a devastating New Madrid 
quake in 1811 -- did occur during a tidal peak, it was not an unusually large 
peak. 
</P>
<P>
But Coe, whose Cape Girardeau, Mo., offices are perched on the northern edge of 
the fault, said he has faith in Browning's forecasts. His co-director, David 
Stewart, has spent time with Browning in New Mexico and studied his forecast 
methods, which Coe said are different from most past examinations of tidal 
forces in that they also factor in vector forces. 
</P>
<P>
He explained vector forces: "If you had a rope tied to a cart and you pulled it 
to the north and someone else was pulling to the east, the cart would tend to 
go to the northeast. What speed it had and whether it went more easterly or 
more to the north would depend on your force in relation to the other person's 
force." 
</P>
<P>
Most earthquake studies in the past have not looked at vector forces, he said. 
Browning claims to have advanced degrees in biology, genetics and bacteriology 
as well as physics from the University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
He makes his living as a lecturer and consultant to businesses on climatology. 
He took up the study of earthquakes, at first as a hobby, in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
Coe said he thinks Browning lacks the respect of the scientific community 
because he doesn't publish his findings in scientific journals and because he 
tends to work directly for business clients rather than in government- or 
university-owned laboratories. As a result, he said, most scientists hear of 
his forecasts after the events he predicted have already happened. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be hopeful that there might be something to it," he said of this most 
recent forecast. "Not hopeful that we're going to have an earthquake, but 
hopeful that the science of earthquake prediction can be advanced. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that if in fact on Dec. 2nd or 3rd there is an earthquake or 
volcano anyplace in the world between the 30 and 60 latitudes . . . I would 
think it would indicate that essentially he has accomplished something that 
other people have not done." 
</P>
<P>
Expert opinions on the likelihood of a large New Madrid quake vary widely, but 
it is generally agreed that a catastrophic earthquake sometime in the next 50 
years is a real threat. One recent study estimates the probability of a 7.6 
quake before the year 2035 to be between 20% and 30%. The same study says there 
is a 2.7% to 4% chance of an 8.3 earthquake occurring during the same time 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Because of soil conditions, the possibility of earthquake-caused flooding and 
the lack of seismic-designed buildings in the Mississippi Valley region, even a 
moderate quake here is expected to cause much more extensive and widespread 
damage than a similar-sized earthquake in California, according to a Federal 
Emergency Management Agency study released in June. 
</P>
<P>
"Thousands of people will be homeless," the study said. "Property damage is 
expected to total billions of dollars. Flooding and other secondary effects 
would seriously compound these problems." A federal study on the effects of a 
major New Madrid earthquake on tall buildings in Chicago, Kansas City, Atlanta 
and Dallas found that, generally speaking, well-built buildings in those cities 
could resist the quake with only light structural damage. St. Louis and 
Memphis, Tenn., and countless small towns in between, could suffer greatly, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
Now, thanks to Browning, the people who would be most affected by such an 
earthquake are finally starting to take the possibility seriously. A Missouri 
law passed in May requires jurisdictions in the eastern third of the state for 
the first time to have seismic codes, Coe said. Companies in downtown St. Louis 
have started having earthquake drills for their employees. And spokesmen for 
earthquake preparedness agencies say they have been flooded with requests for 
information. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that it's nothing but positive," Ray Briggler of the Arkansas Office 
of Emergency Services said of Browning's earthquake forecast. "It's produced 
great awareness in the area." 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledges some overreactions. "I have a friend in the airline industry, 
and he tells me that flights out of Memphis are booked up for Dec. 2." 
</P>
<P>
But noting that one study projects a 50% to 60% chance of an earthquake of 
magnitude 5.5 to 7.0 occurring in the next decade, he said: "The reality is 
that (the New Madrid area) is a very active seismic area. The probability of a 
quake in that area is very good on any given day." 
</P>
<P>
His fear is that Dec. 3 will come and go without an earthquake and people will 
revert to their former nonchalance.

GULF CRISIS: U.S. TROOPS DROP FROM A HELICOPTER ONTO THE VESSEL AFTER IT 
IGNORES WARNING SHOTS. NO PROHIBITED CARGO IS FOUND.

<P>
In a new show of force aimed at ending Iraqi defiance at sea, U.S. Marines 
swung from helicopters to the deck of a homeward-bound Iraqi ship and forced it 
to halt Sunday as American fighter planes screeched overhead, military 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The aerial assault off the coast of Oman marked the first time the United 
States has forced a boarding on a moving Iraqi ship and the first use of 
American warplanes in an interception. 
</P>
<P>
Although U.S. forces have previously fired warning shots to intimidate Iraqi 
captains into stopping, they had always awaited the captain's permission before 
dispatching what is usually a combined Navy-Coast Guard team to inspect the 
ship and its cargo. 
</P>
<P>
The armed Marines met no resistance in the helicopter-borne operation against 
the 900-foot merchant vessel Amuriyah. But the ship had defied warning shots 
from an American frigate's five-inch gun, and a Navy official said: "I'm sure 
(the Marines) weren't welcome." 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi ship was later permitted to continue to Iraq after a joint boarding 
party of U.S. and Australian personnel found it to be carrying no cargo 
prohibited by U.N. sanctions, according to a military spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The changed American tactics came a week after another Iraqi vessel ignored a 
barrage of warning shots and continued on its course for more than a day in a 
move suggesting that Iraqi captains may no longer be intimidated even by heavy 
naval gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. commanders ordered the assault by Marines on Sunday morning, just two 
hours after the Iraqi ship first rejected an American order to stop. The 
assault suggested a new American unwillingness to permit prolonged standoffs at 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
According to an account provided by military officials here, the Marines 
descended unannounced on the Iraqi vessel on ropes from a helicopter dispatched 
from the U.S. amphibious ship Ogden. The ship is part of a fleet carrying 
10,000 Marines in the gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time, two fighter planes from the U.S. carrier Independence 
streaked at low altitude past the Iraqi vessel half a dozen times in a display 
that officials here said was intended "to underscore our resolve to enforce the 
U.N. sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear how the Marines forced the 157,000-ton Amuriyah to a halt. A 
military statement said only that the Iraqi vessel "was stopped" at 9:50 a.m. 
local time after the team of Marines "was inserted" by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
Military officials here said they could not disclose how many Marines had 
boarded the ship or how many helicopters were involved in the operation. They 
also declined to provide an account of what happened aboard the Iraqi vessel 
except to say there had been no shots fired and no casualties. 
</P>
<P>
The assault was ordered after the Iraqi vessel reported that it was bound for 
the Iraqi port of Basra but refused to stop despite the firing of about 200 
machine-gun shots across its bow by the Australian frigate Darwin and the 
firing of two five-inch shells by the American frigate Reasoner. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a whole lot of lead," one U.S. military official said. 
</P>
<P>
The disregard for the warning shots continued an Iraqi pattern of defiance 
adhered to most stubbornly last week by the Al Bahar al Arabi, which agreed to 
turn back to Iraq but then continued on its course for more than a day despite 
heavy firing across its bow. 
</P>
<P>
That episode illustrated the limits of U.S. tactics that had relied principally 
on warning shots to persuade ships to stop and submit to a search. 
</P>
<P>
It also proved somewhat embarrassing to U.S. officials who, on the basis of an 
initial search, announced that the ship was carrying a prohibited cargo of 
plywood and steel. When finally halted, the Iraqi vessel proved to be empty. 
Officials said the ship's crew had apparently dumped the prohibited cargo at 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the Iraqi ship stopped Sunday was close to Navy vessels 
carrying Marines and helicopters in international waters near Masirah island in 
the northern Arabian Sea. They indicated that the principal reason for the 
helicopter-borne assault was to set a new example for Iraqi captains. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to make clear we mean business," one military official said. 
</P>
<P>
Also Sunday, in eastern Saudi Arabia, hundreds of troops in cowboy hats and 
19th-Century uniforms witnessed a formal change of command in their division. 
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony that brought a touch of the Wild West to the Saudi desert, Army 
Col. Harold Burch symbolically handed a cavalry flag to Col. Richard Fousek, 
his successor as head of the 1st Cavalry's support unit. 
</P>
<P>
Burch, of Lake Wales, Fla., broke with tradition and rode not on a horse, but 
on a camel.

CHILDLESS COUPLES -- NEW HOPE;

FOR THOSE WHO HAVE HAD MULTIPLE MISCARRIAGES, BLOOD CELLS FROM THE MAN ARE

Rhonda Gale took a red-eye flight from Los Angeles to Chicago one day in early 
1989, arriving in Chicago just as the sun was rising. Carrying a cooler 
containing vials of her husband's blood, Gale climbed into a limousine and was 
driven to the University of Chicago Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
Medical staff there took the blood from Gale and, several hours later, injected 
a mixture containing Philip Klein's white blood cells under the skin on Gale's 
arm. She flew home the same day. 
</P>
<P>
After several months and a second trip to Chicago, Gale and Klein were on their 
way to achieving a long-held dream: Gale soon became pregnant. And after three 
previous miscarriages, this pregnancy resulted in the birth of twin girls. 
</P>
<P>
Gale and Klein are among a growing number of couples seeking a new and 
controversial treatment for repeated miscarriage. Called paternal leukocyte 
immunization, the treatment involves transferring immune-boosting white blood 
cells from the potential father to the potential mother before conception in 
order to improve the chances that the mother's body won't reject the fetus. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates for the treatment are couples who have had three or more unexplained 
miscarriages early in the pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
While the treatment is still under investigation, it offers some hope in an 
area of obstetrics that has been one of the last to benefit from a wide range 
of new reproductive technologies. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have realized astounding success in the last decade in the treatment 
of infertility. Through advances in surgery, hormone therapy, in vitro 
fertilization, donation of eggs and sperm and surrogacy, the process of getting 
people pregnant now holds many options. 
</P>
<P>
But staying pregnant can present another problem. When the cause of miscarriage 
is known, treatment is often available to improve the chance of a successful 
pregnancy. But for unexplained miscarriage, physicians traditionally could only 
tell couples to keep trying or consider artificial insemination with donor 
sperm. 
</P>
<P>
"Recurrent pregnancy loss is something of an orphan among medical specialties," 
says Dr. Pamela J. Boyer, who is studying the paternal leukocyte immunization 
at UCLA School of Medicine. "There aren't a lot of options (for treatment), and 
there aren't a lot of people interested in it. There hasn't been a good place 
for patients to go." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the issue of treatment, the emotional aftermath of miscarriage and its 
effect on couples who desperately want children has been ignored by the medical 
profession, says Susan Speraw, a registered nurse and doctoral candidate who is 
studying the subject for her thesis at the California School of Professional 
Psychology. 
</P>
<P>
"There really is no literature on the psychological aspects of miscarriage. 
It's like a nonentity," she says. "I think the general concept is that because 
the pregnancy is lost so early it doesn't have much meaning to the couple." 
</P>
<P>
Speraw's ongoing study of couples who have experienced early miscarriages shows 
most feel a loss -- "even if it's just a loss of hopes and dreams." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years researchers have learned that miscarriage is exceedingly 
common. Most pregnancies spontaneously end within the first 28 days, before a 
woman usually knows she's pregnant. Of pregnancies that are confirmed by a 
physician, another 15% to 25% end in miscarriage. 
</P>
<P>
About half of those miscarriages are due to genetic defects of the fetus or 
structural problems that prevent the mother from carrying the fetus, such as a 
weakened uterus or cervix or hormonal problems. 
</P>
<P>
Another large group of couples -- several thousand, according to fertility 
experts -- experience repeated miscarriages for unknown reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the important advance that paternal leukocyte immunization might 
represent, some fertility experts are concerned that couples are seeking the 
treatment before studies have shown that it actually works or why it works. 
</P>
<P>
"It's at a semi-experimental status," says Dr. Susan Cowchock, a researcher at 
Jefferson Medical Center in Philadelphia who has been using the technique for 
about five years. "There is plenty of evidence that it's helpful, but I don't 
think anyone would feel it's standardized treatment yet." 
</P>
<P>
Several thousand couples worldwide -- many in England -- have undergone the 
therapy. But only a few small, controlled studies have compared the success of 
couples treated with paternal leukocyte immunization to untreated couples, says 
Dr. D. Ware Branch, an assistant professor at the University of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
At Utah, physicians are attempting to conduct a large, controlled, double-blind 
study but are having trouble attracting couples to the study because the 
couples fear they might be assigned to the untreated control group. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Branch says the study is necessary because evidence is lacking that the 
treatment works. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we don't really know if it works," he says. "Physicians over the years 
have felt confident about things that haven't panned out. I think (the 
interest) is well- intentioned, but circumstantial evidence often doesn't hold 
up to closer scrutiny." 
</P>
<P>
The treatment was first suggested in 1981 in research published by a British 
physician, W.P. Faulk, and Chicago physician Alan Beer, who treated Gale. 
</P>
<P>
Both physicians were interested in studies that show immunological factors play 
an important role in establishing a successful pregnancy. And researchers say 
the studies related to paternal leukocyte immunization could illuminate basic 
mysteries of the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the human body rejects foreign material. Organ transplants, for 
example, are rejected unless the patient receives special, potent drugs to 
prevent the body from recognizing the organ as foreign tissue. 
</P>
<P>
Since a fetus has half its genetic material from its father, a woman's body -- 
theoretically -- should react to the fetus as foreign material. 
</P>
<P>
Because that usually doesn't happen, pregnancy has long been a source of 
wonderment to biologists. Years of studies have suggested that the mother's 
body secretes protective antibodies in response to the fetus that keeps the 
fetus from being rejected by her immune system. Changes in the mother's immune 
response during pregnancy have been detected, but experts disagree on which of 
these might be the protective factors. 
</P>
<P>
"Somehow this baby that is half the father sits there and grows," Boyer says. 
"I've always been fascinated by that process." 
</P>
<P>
Because of this paradox, some experts suggest that couples with repeated, 
unexplained miscarriages have similar immune system characteristics that 
somehow interfere with the normal protective mechanism. If the father and 
mother share similar immune system characteristics, "the baby, ironically, is 
not different enough so the mother doesn't recognize it enough to lay down the 
protective layer," says David Hill, laboratory director at the Center for 
Reproductive Medicine at Century City Hospital, whose program is an adjunct to 
Beer's popular program in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"This condition can be tested for by taking blood from the husband and the wife 
to see if this type of sharing phenomenon occurs," Hill says. 
</P>
<P>
Receiving an injection of the potential father's blood -- in effect, an 
immunization -- causes numerous responses in the woman's body, not all of which 
are understood, Boyer says. But when the "immunized" woman becomes pregnant, 
her body apparently recognizes the genetic material and responds appropriately 
to protect the baby. 
</P>
<P>
"Her body has learned from the immunization to recognize her husband's cells 
and respond appropriately," Boyer says. "But no one seems to know how it 
actually works." 
</P>
<P>
Cowchock says the explanation is not that simple. 
</P>
<P>
"(The treatment) may have nothing to do with interaction between the husband 
and wife," she says. "No one knows why it might be helpful. It might be helpful 
in a mild way." 
</P>
<P>
While similar genetic material between the mother and father might be part of 
the problem, something else is probably going wrong in the mother's ability to 
recognize the fetus, Boyer says. 
</P>
<P>
"The going theory now seems to be that's it's a recognition problem," she says. 
"(The fetus) has to be recognized and there has to be a response." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the mystery of how it works, Cowchock and other researchers say their 
studies show that couples who undergo the treatment have a 75% to 80% chance of 
carrying their next pregnancy to term. 
</P>
<P>
But statistics show that women who have had three miscarriages have a 30% to 
40% chance of carrying the next pregnancy to term without any treatment. So 
it's impossible to know if the treatment helped couples or if they would have 
been successful anyway, Boyer says. 
</P>
<P>
"Thirty to 40% are going to be successful anyway," Boyer says. 
</P>
<P>
But a growing number of patients are true believers. 
</P>
<P>
Gale and Klein began trying to conceive in 1986. Because Gale had 
endometriosis, a condition of abnormal tissue growth outside the uterus, the 
couple underwent a procedure called gamete intra-Fallopian transfer, or GIFT, 
in late 1987. GIFT involves placing a mixture of eggs and sperm in the 
Fallopian tube. 
</P>
<P>
Gale, an attorney, got pregnant three times with GIFT but miscarried all three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
After the third miscarriage, Gale made an appointment with an adoption lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd had enough," she said. "I had been tested for everything. I knew something 
was the matter, but no one could figure out what it was." 
</P>
<P>
But while pursuing adoption, Gale and Klein heard about paternal leukocyte 
immunization. They shipped blood samples to Beer and were informed that the 
treatment might help them. Blood types do not matter except where the mother 
has an Rh negative blood type while the father is Rh positive, which could lead 
to complications. 
</P>
<P>
Gale traveled to Chicago twice for transfusions. She became pregnant a few 
months later through a GIFT procedure. Early in the pregnancy, Gale received 
another boost of her husband's blood. The twins, Allison and Juliana, were born 
Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Gale says some doctors familiar with the couple's history have told her they 
doubt that the treatment was responsible for the successful pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
But, she says, "I really believe that without this treatment my kids would not 
be born. I don't really think you can dispute it." 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the amount of laboratory tests needed, the treatment ranges from 
several hundred dollars to $2,000, experts and patients say. 
</P>
<P>
Some insurers vary in their decision to cover the cost of the treatment. But 
those who call the American Fertility Society in Birmingham, Ala., an umbrella 
organization for fertility treatment centers, are told that the treatment is 
still under investigation, says spokeswoman Joyce Zeitz. "We have to tell them 
it's purely experimental," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The completion of the double-blind study at Utah could help resolve many 
questions about the treatment. Utah officials are offering couples free 
treatment to enter the study. Couples who are assigned to the control group and 
don't achieve a full-term pregnancy will be offered paternal leukocyte 
immunization later at no charge, Branch says. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, research on why the treatment works could yield significant 
information. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hill, researchers are intrigued by the possibility that the 
treatment might improve the odds for couples who have no success at in vitro 
fertilization or GIFT. 
</P>
<P>
An immune problem might also be a factor for couples with unexplained 
infertility -- about 10% of all couples who cannot achieve pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know whether or not this thing can be extrapolated to the in vitro 
fertilization experience. But there is some evidence that this is so," Hill 
says. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA is also performing research on key immunological aspects of the treatment 
that might be beneficial in organ transplantation, Boyer says. 
</P>
<P>
But even a modest reduction in miscarriage rates is significant, Boyer says. 
Women who miscarry often feel at fault because so little is known about the 
causes of miscarriage. In the past, some women have been told by doctors that 
they have a psychological aversion to pregnancy, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be something people covered up," she says. "The standard 
(treatment) was to tell people to try again. It has really been in the last 
five years that this has changed. This is a legitimate medical problem. This 
isn't something you should suffer with and bury. You should get help." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PATERNAL LEUKOCYTE IMMUNIZATION 
</P>
<P>
Several thousand couples who desire to become parents experience repeated 
miscarriages for unknown reasons. Some medical experts now suspect that the 
woman's body is failing to recognize the genetic material of the fetus and 
rejecting the fetus. 
</P>
<P>
How paternal leukocyte immunization works: 
</P>
<P>
1. The couple have blood tests to identify the similar characteristics of their 
immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
2. The husband's blood sample is processed to remove the white blood cells, key 
immune-system cells. 
</P>
<P>
3. The husband's white blood cells are transfused to the wife, triggering her 
body to produce antibodies and other immune responses crucial to recognizing 
and protecting a fetus that is half the father's genetic material. 
</P>
<P>
4. After the woman conceives, signals are released from a layer of tissue 
surrounding the fetus -- the trophoblast -- alerting the woman's body to 
produce protective cells and antibodies, protecting the fetus from rejection. 
</P>
<P>
According to the theory, the woman's body has learned from the transfusion to 
recognize her husband's genetic material. 
</P>
<P>
Blood sample

LUNG TRANSPLANT -- TAKING RISKS TO SAVE A LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: THE MOTHER-DAUGHTER SURGERY ILLUSTRATES THE CHANCES THAT DOCTORS AND 
FAMILY MEMBERS ARE WILLING TO TAKE WITH EXPERIMENTAL OPERATIONS. THE ULTIMATE 
SUCCESS WILL NOT BE KNOWN FOR YEARS.

<P>
The dramatic mother-to-daughter lung transplant at Stanford University Medical 
Center last week illustrates the risks surgeons and family members are prepared 
to take with potentially life-saving experimental operations. 
</P>
<P>
The complex procedure, planned by doctors for the last year and a half, also 
demonstrates that transplant surgeons are no longer satisfied with simply 
prolonging a person's life -- particularly a child's -- for a year or two. 
</P>
<P>
"A child that receives a transplant is going to need to grow and develop 
normally if you can ever consider that transplant successful," said Dr. Vaughn 
A. Starnes, the chief surgeon for the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Both mother and daughter, who have requested anonymity, were reported making 
good progress on Sunday as they continued their recovery from Thursday's 
operations, which are believed to have been the first of their kind in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
The child suffers from a rare, invariably fatal, lung disease known as 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia. She also had a heart defect, which was corrected 
during the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
But it now appears that the ultimate success of this and future living donor 
lung transplants will not be known for three to four years, when the girl's 
health and development can be assessed. 
</P>
<P>
The surgery is considered highly experimental because fewer than 20 lung 
transplants using cadaver donors have been performed in children worldwide and 
because of the potential risk to the mother. 
</P>
<P>
In adults, several hundred lung transplants have been done, with a one-year 
survival rate of about 70% and a three-year survival rate of 50% or less, 
Starnes said. By comparison, heart, kidney and liver transplants are far more 
common and the overall results far better. Physicians suspect that one reason 
is that the lung may trigger stronger immunologic reactions in the body than do 
other organs. 
</P>
<P>
Starnes, the director of Stanford's heart-lung transplant program, has been 
planning living donor lung transplants since 1989. While Stanford's results 
with dead unrelated donors compared favorably with many other programs, he had 
become frustrated by several factors. 
</P>
<P>
* About a quarter of the children awaiting lung transplants were dying while 
they waited, because of the shortage of suitable organs. A typical child waited 
six to 12 months for a donor. 
</P>
<P>
* Other children were surviving the operation, only to have their bodies 
ravaged by chronic rejection episodes -- during which the breathing passages of 
the lungs are destroyed -- and by the side effects of the powerful drugs needed 
to fight rejection. This was particularly true for children between the age of 
3 and puberty. 
</P>
<P>
"Patients are coming back to us and saying this is not such a great 
experience," Starnes said. "I have had several rejection episodes. I am on 
chronic steroids. I am fat. I have hair everywhere. I feel like I'd rather 
die," are some of the comments he has heard. 
</P>
<P>
Starnes reasoned that partial lung transplants from living related donors, like 
the partial liver transplants from living donors that were pioneered at the 
University of Chicago last year, might solve some of of these problems. 
</P>
<P>
Not only would there be a ready source of organs, but better tissue matching 
might lessen or eliminate rejection episodes. While surgeons who transplant 
livers or kidneys have a day or two to match the tissues of cadaver donors and 
recipients, this is not possible with hearts and lungs, which can only be 
stored for a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with bits and pieces of data from research in pigs and lung transplants 
in adults, Starnes persuaded Stanford's Institutional Review Board, which is 
charged with monitoring the safety and medical soundness of human experiments, 
that the time was right to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
But, in an interview, Starnes acknowledged that their were many unknowns. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Starnes' experiments in pigs, which have yet to be published, 
demonstrated that a segment of lung transplanted from an adult pig can take 
over immediate lung function in a small offspring. But because the transplant 
lasted only 24 hours (all the animals were killed so the lung tissue could be 
examined), researchers do not know the long-term effectiveness of the 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Starnes said he plans -- but has yet to do -- experiments in which segments of 
lungs from adult pigs are transplanted into piglets, who are then followed to 
see if they grow normally to maturity. 
</P>
<P>
Starnes also does not know if a segment of an adult's lung can handle the blood 
flow from the entire body as the child grows and how the lung tissue itself 
will grow. Only the girl's right lung was removed, but little blood or oxygen 
will flow through her deceased left lung. 
</P>
<P>
The transplanted right upper lobe of the mother's lung is expected to expand to 
fill her daughter's right chest cavity. As a result, the existing surfaces for 
gas exchange, known as alveoli, should become larger. But it is unlikely that 
new alveoli will develop, Starnes said. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the tissues of the mother and daughter are not a perfect match. 
This means that the daughter is still at significant risk for rejection 
episodes. 
</P>
<P>
Another significant issue is the potential surgical risk to lung donors. For a 
person with healthy lungs, the loss of one-third of one lung is unlikely to 
cause problems. But the surgery to obtain the lung segment is not entirely 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
The risk is not hypothetical, said Arthur Caplan, the director of the Center 
for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota. "People definitely die 
from removing parts of solid organs." 
</P>
<P>
Stanford surgeons first discussed last week's surgery with the family four 
months ago. Before final approval was given, members of the university's review 
board "interviewed the mother and child separately to make sure the 
investigators had not unduly biased them," Starnes said. 
</P>
<P>
Review board members will conduct similar interviews before authorizing each of 
the additional five to 10 surgeries that are planned. 
</P>
<P>
But despite this independent review, some experts in medical ethics doubt that 
meaningful informed consent for such surgery can truly be obtained from a 
parent with a dying child. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a pretty coercive environment," Caplan said. It is "hard to feel you can 
say no when you are talking about your own family and others will know if you 
say no." 
</P>
<P>
Starnes said he was sensitive to this issue, and believes that lung transplants 
using cadaver donors should remain the procedure of choice until his results 
are in. 
</P>
<P>
The use of cadaver donors "only puts one person at risk. That is the bottom 
line," Starnes said. If the results with living related donors "are very good 
three or four years out, then that will lend support to expanding the 
operation."

MIDDLEBORO, Mass. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joseph E. Walker remembers a time in the 1940s when dozens of ancient shady elm 
trees lined the streets of this town on Massachusetts' South Shore. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like driving through a cathedral," he said of the tunnel-like effect of 
passing under the branches of the stately elms. 
</P>
<P>
Today those trees are but a memory in Middleboro, the victims of the Dutch elm 
disease that has devastated the species. 
</P>
<P>
According to some estimates, the disease -- a fungus spread by beetles that 
breed under the bark -- has caused the death of more than 100 million trees 
nationwide since it was discovered around 1932. 
</P>
<P>
The disappearance of the American elm, which had been favored by communities 
since Colonial times because of its decorative and hardy qualities, has changed 
the face of main streets across the country. In New England, where elms were as 
integral a part of the traditional landscape as white churches and town 
commons, the change has been particularly marked. 
</P>
<P>
But gloom about the future of the American elm has recently been replaced by a 
surge of hope that the tree is headed for a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Fueling that hope is the recent development of elm varieties that closely 
resemble the traditional American elm but are resistant to Dutch elm disease. 
</P>
<P>
The Elm Research Institute in Harrisville, N.H., introduced one of those 
varieties, the American Liberty elm, in 1983, and a year later began a program 
to distribute it. 
</P>
<P>
The American Liberty elm resists Dutch elm disease because its vessels are too 
narrow to allow the tree-killing fungus to circulate, thus allowing the tree to 
"wall off the disease," said John P. Hansel, the institute director. The fungus 
kills traditional American elms by blocking needed fluids. 
</P>
<P>
Institute researchers had already introduced a fungicide capable, when injected 
into healthy elms, of slowing their infection. 
</P>
<P>
Under its "Johnny Elmseed" program, the nonprofit institute supplies young elms 
from its nursery to local Boy Scout troops, which raise the trees in plots in 
their home communities. After two to three years, the Scouts replant the trees 
around town or sell them to residents. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, the institute began inviting municipalities to subsidize the elm 
purchases by becoming institute members. Until then, Scout groups had to seek 
funding themselves from local governments or civic groups. 
</P>
<P>
The institute's goal is to distribute one million American Liberty elms by the 
year 2000, said Hansel, who founded the institute in 1967. To date, more than 
500 communities nationwide have received elms. 
</P>
<P>
The program appears to be a hit with residents in participating communities. 
</P>
<P>
"The people are very enthused," said Walker, a former selectman who arranged 
for the purchase of about 200 trees in Middleboro two years ago. "A lot of them 
can remember in their younger days when the streets were lined with trees." 
</P>
<P>
Walker said about 35 of the trees, now about 12 to 14 feet high, have been 
replanted around town, and the remainder will be replanted this fall. The trees 
will grow to 100 to 150 feet in height and have a life expectancy of about 200 
years. 
</P>
<P>
In Rutland, Mass., which acquired about 200 trees and has replanted 24, "the 
townspeople are happy to see" the sight of the elms returning, said Carl G. 
Christianson, superintendent of public works. He said elm trees are "almost 
part of your heritage." 
</P>
<P>
But the program has drawn caution from some experts. Lawrence R. Schreiber, a 
research plant pathologist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Ohio, 
noted that no elm varieties have yet proved to be immune to disease and that it 
would be a mistake for towns to plant only one variety. 
</P>
<P>
But Hansel said the institute has never advocated that American Liberty elms be 
planted to the exclusion of other trees, and that the million trees it hopes to 
plant would replace only a fraction of the 100 million or so that died. 
</P>
<P>
In California, meanwhile, a quarantine on the importation of elms remains in 
effect while researchers study the disease-resistant qualities of the American 
Liberty elm and other new varieties. Hansel said he hopes the ban will be 
lifted soon. 
</P>
<P>
For those who have planted the elms, the thrill of rekindling a lost species 
seems to outweigh any uncertainties about the future of the trees. Steve 
Savory, a former Rutland Cub Scout, said he hopes to return to his town one day 
and say: "Hey, look at that tree. I planted it."

of a new, disease-resistant species of American elm is fueling hope for a 
comeback for the trees, devastated by Dutch elm disease. The disappearance of 
the elms -- more than 100 million have been lost to the fungus since the 1930s 
-- has changed the face of main streets across the nation. American Album 
reports that in one "Johnny Elmseed" program in Massachusetts, Boy Scouts raise 
the new trees in plots and later replant them around town. KIRK R. WILLIAMSON /

With American fighter planes screeching overhead, U.S. Marines swung from 
helicopters to the deck of an Iraqi ship and forced it to halt. The aerial 
assault represented a major escalation in the use of force to carry out U.N. 
sanctions.

Iraqi President Saddam Hussein scrapped gasoline rationing and fired his oil 
minister, Baghdad Radio reported. Rationing, the report said, had been 
introduced "on the basis of erroneous information." 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, a statement released Sunday and signed by 81 House 
Democrats strongly opposed any offensive military action to force Iraq out of 
Kuwait. The move was organized by California Rep. Ronald V. Dellums 
(D-Berkeley). Six of those who signed are to be added to a congressional body 
set up to monitor the gulf situation during Congress' recess.

Diplomatic Front:

<P>
European Community leaders agreed not to send representatives of individual 
countries to Iraq to negotiate the release of their hostages but to urge the 
United Nations to send a special envoy. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrived in Paris for two days of talks 
with French President Francois Mitterrand. Gulf issues were likely to dominate 
the talks.

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and French President Francois Mitterrand, 
key players in the search for a diplomatic solution to the Persian Gulf crisis, 
Sunday opened two days of talks likely to be dominated by gulf issues. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet and French leaders met briefly Sunday afternoon and then dined 
together at the Elysee Palace amid rumors that Mitterrand had received a letter 
from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein outlining a new peace proposal. But at a 
press conference in Rome, where he was attending a summit of European leaders 
earlier in the day Sunday, Mitterrand denied having any contact with Iraqi 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
The Franco-Soviet summit takes place in an atmosphere of intense activity on 
the gulf front by both countries. A recent host of rumors and official 
statements seemed to highlight the significance of the talks between two 
leaders who are evidently regarded by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein as his 
best hopes for a diplomatic and unhumiliating solution to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev raised some expectations for a diplomatic settlement when he told a 
news conference Saturday in Madrid that he detected a softening of official 
Iraqi attitudes, and the Soviets then asked the U.N. Security Council for a 
48-hour postponement of a vote on a resolution condemning Iraq so that Soviet 
special envoy Yevgeny Primakov could complete talks with Hussein in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France has recently received a flurry of offerings from Iraq, topped 
by a decision last week by Hussein to release all of France's more than 300 
hostages in Iraq, including those held at strategic centers. French officials 
say the hostages are to fly to France today. 
</P>
<P>
The gulf crisis is likely to dwarf what was supposed to have been the main 
subject of the talks here, a treaty of understanding and cooperation between 
France and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement will be signed by Gorbachev and Mitterrand today after they meet 
for talks at a 14th-Century former royal castle at Rambouillet, 30 miles west 
of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev flew here from Spain, where he ended his official visit Sunday with 
Olympic and Picasso sightseeing in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife, Raisa, toured the refurbished stadium on Montjuich hill 
overlooking the city that will be used for the track events at the 1992 
Olympics. As they entered the stadium, the scoreboard lighted up with the words 
"Welcome to Barcelona" in both Russian and Catalan, the language of this region 
of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who greeted them were Juan Antonio Samaranch, the Barcelona-born 
president of the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The Gorbachevs also visited the new Saint Jordi Palace nearby that will be used 
for basketball and other indoor sports in the Olympics, and the well-known 
Picasso museum housed in a 14th-Century palace in the narrow streets of the 
oldest part of the city. Pablo Picasso studied art as a teen-ager in Barcelona 
at the turn of the century before leaving for Paris, and the museum has a 
unique collection of the Spanish painter's early work. 
</P>
<P>
Prince Felipe, the heir to the Spanish throne, was host for the Gorbachevs' 
visit to Barcelona largely because the area's two main political rivals -- 
Socialist Mayor Pasqual Maragall of Barcelona and Jordi Pujol, the Catalan 
nationalist who is president of the Generalitat or government of the region of 
Catalonia -- could not agree on how to divide the honors. But, though the 
prince was the official host, Maragall and Pujol seemed to bob up on television 
screens somewhere near the Gorbachevs all the time. 
</P>
<P>
With the fringes of hair around his baldness often unkempt, his face puffy and 
his eyes tired, Gorbachev frequently looked somewhat weary on his three-day 
visit to Spain. But when a television reporter, closing an interview late 
Saturday night, told him, "I will let you go to sleep now," Gorbachev shook his 
head and replied with a smile, "I am not sleeping until I have completed 
perestroika in the Soviet Union."

Thousands of Palestinians returned to work in Israel after a rare four-day 
closure of the occupied territories. But some found they had been fired because 
of a spate of attacks on Jews to avenge the police killing of 20 Arabs on 
Jerusalem's Temple Mount. Eight Arabs were wounded by army gunfire during 
clashes in the West Bank village of Dura, near Hebron, as the army allowed 
Palestinians back into Israel, Arab sources said.

Republican Jon Grunseth dropped out of the Minnesota governor's race Sunday, 
after publication of a woman's claim that she had an affair with him while he 
was married and other reports that he tried to get teen-age girls to swim nude 
with him in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"There are three things that are extremely important to me -- my wife, my 
family, first and foremost; the Republican Party, the people of Minnesota," 
Grunseth said from his home 20 miles east of Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
"And the events of the last three weeks have put enormous pressure on the 
family, and, I think, on the political process and on the people of Minnesota," 
he said. "I, therefore, decided to withdraw as the Republican candidate for 
governor." 
</P>
<P>
Grunseth's campaign was thrown into chaos on Oct. 15, when two women said he 
tried to get them to swim nude with them while they were teen-agers nine years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
The women said they refused but that Grunseth, his teen-age daughter and a 
16-year-old girl took off their bathing suits. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Grunseth told the Star Tribune newspaper he had had a "romantic" 
relationship with Tamara Taylor, 32, of Minnetonka, but he said it ended "a 
long time ago -- in the early '80s." 
</P>
<P>
Grunseth, 44, divorced Katharine Winston in 1983 and married his current wife, 
Vicki, in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said that she and Grunseth had an intermittent sexual relationship from 
1980 until 1989, during both his marriages. Grunseth said the affair ended 
before he remarried in 1984 and denied the nude-swimming allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The state GOP executive committee can replace Grunseth's name on the Nov. 6 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich is seeking a fourth term. State Auditor Arne 
Carlson, the runner-up in the GOP primary, last week re-entered the race as a 
write-in candidate for governor.

IN RACE TO ADJOURN, CRANSTON FINISHES OUT OF THE MONEY

Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) came up a penny, nickel, dime, quarter and 
half-dollar short early Sunday in his bid to push a coin-redesign bill through 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
After failing to attach the measure to a landmark housing bill that he 
co-authored, Cranston tried in the waning hours before adjournment to tack it 
on to a pair of smaller bills. 
</P>
<P>
But the effort went for naught. 
</P>
<P>
New York socialite Diane Wolf, 36, a frequent companion of the 76-year-old 
senator and the daughter of a wealthy Texas oilman and a member of the federal 
Commission on Fine Arts, has lobbied actively for the bill, which calls for 
redesigning the reverse side of the penny, nickel, dime, quarter and 
half-dollar. The reverse side is opposite the profiles of U.S. Presidents. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), co-author of the housing bill, said that he 
had moved to prevent Cranston's coin measure from being added to his 
legislation. "I believe in following the regular order," Gonzalez said, 
referring to rules that are intended to exclude provisions not germane to a 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston also sought to insert the coin bill in the $490-billion 
deficit-reduction package passed by Congress on Saturday, but that move was 
thwarted by Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Carmel Valley), the House Budget Committee 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would have required the Treasury secretary, in selecting new designs, 
to choose from several "constitutional concepts": freedom of speech and 
assembly, freedom of the press, the right to due process of law, the right to a 
trial by jury, the right to equal protection under the law, the right to vote 
and "the constitutional principle of separation of powers, including the 
independence of the judiciary." 
</P>
<P>
The legislation died with the adjournment of the 101st Congress, although it 
could be reintroduced when the new Congress convenes in January.

WHITE HOUSE TIES DEMOCRATS TO TAX HIKES; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: BUT PARTY OFFICIALS SAID FALLOUT FROM THE DEFICIT PACKAGE WOULD HELP 
THEM MAKE GAINS AT REPUBLICAN EXPENSE IN THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS.

<P>
Top White House officials Sunday sought to blame Democrats for increased taxes 
included in the budget agreement just passed by Congress, but Democratic 
officials predicted that fallout from the deficit package would help them make 
strong gains in the upcoming election. 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle sought to portray tax increases in the five-year, 
$490-billion deficit-reduction package as a bitter pill that Republicans were 
forced to swallow to get the best compromise available in a system of divided 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that the Democrats got their tax increases and we Republicans got 
the spending cuts," Quayle said of the deficit package during an appearance on 
NBC's "Meet the Press." 
</P>
<P>
His comments echoed those of President Bush, who during a pre-election campaign 
swing through the country is telling voters that if they don't like the budget 
and tax plans, they should elect more Republicans to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle said Sunday that Bush could not veto the final budget package, despite 
his opposition to the tax increases, because of "the sensitivity" of the 
situation in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
He also insisted that the package was a success in terms of instituting real 
controls over federal spending and added that the President would not suffer 
long-term political damage because of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
But Ron Brown, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, argued that the 
budget battle has given the Democrats a major political victory right before 
the election. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the party's candidates will do well in the upcoming elections 
because the party had stood up for tax fairness by requiring the wealthy to pay 
a larger share of the tax burden than they previously had done. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a much fairer package because the Democrats were there to look out for 
the working men and women of the country," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Democrats are listening to the people, and the people are saying we've 
had enough of Reaganomics. Because Democrats kept fighting, the middle class is 
much better off than they would have been under the President's budget plan," 
Brown added in an appearance on ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, on the other hand, credited Republicans for winning spending cuts and 
"tough enforcement provisions to get those spending cuts." 
</P>
<P>
He also challenged political analysts who contend that Republican congressional 
candidates are attempting to distance themselves from President Bush in the 
wake of widespread criticism of his handling of the budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been out there, and I can tell you that Republican candidates are for the 
President, they think he has been a strong President and a good President," 
Quayle said. "They believe this (budget agreement) was the best available 
option." 
</P>
<P>
Separately, White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, who has come under fire 
for his role in the budget negotiations, predicted that Republican candidates 
would not be damaged by the budget and tax package in the upcoming election. 
</P>
<P>
Sununu said that he believes Republicans should be able to "hold their own" in 
the Senate and post small losses in the House of Representatives, while making 
gains in the gubernatorial races around the country. 
</P>
<P>
"The Democrats said if you want a budget, you have to pay the ransom of higher 
taxes. But I think you will see a recovery very quickly," for Bush and other 
Republicans, S!nunu said on "This Week with David Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
Sununu also said that a new poll by Newsweek magazine showing Bush's approval 
rating at only 48% represents just a temporary blip on the screen. "There are 
six more years of this presidency for sure," Sununu said.

DAM SPILLS 9 MILLION GALLONS OF SODIUM CYANIDE

<P>
About 9 million gallons of potentially hazardous sodium cyanide spilled Sunday 
from a reservoir into a nearby creek when a dam broke, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The spill posed little threat to drinking supplies, but officials warned 
residents to keep animals from tainted water. 
</P>
<P>
The substance, a poisonous chemical when undiluted, spilled from a reservoir at 
Brewer Gold Co. when a dam broke, said Richard Carnes, emergency preparedness 
director in Chesterfield County. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy rain might have weakened the dam along the reservoir. Sodium cyanide 
spilled into Little Fork Creek, about 2,000 feet from the reservoir. The creek 
flows into Lynches River, about two miles from the spill. 
</P>
<P>
The company uses the chemical to separate gold from ore. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown, about 110 miles southeast of Jefferson, is the nearest municipality 
to draw drinking water from the lake system. 
</P>
<P>
"We really feel like by the time it gets that far it will be hard to even 
detect," said Thom Berry, spokesman for the state Department of Health and 
Environmental Control. 
</P>
<P>
The reservoir held 13 million to 14 million gallons of sodium cyanide, Berry 
said. He said leaking continued late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Results of water quality tests would not be available until today. 
</P>
<P>
Consumption of undiluted sodium cyanide can be fatal, but it is significantly 
weakened when mixed with water, Berry said.

CONSERVING A PRECIOUS RESOURCE

<P>
The Casitas Municipal Water District board and staff are composed of a 
distinguished group of business persons, engineers and farmers. This group has 
graciously agreed to work with district constituents regarding water rationing 
measures necessary to effectuate the laudable purpose of conserving our state's 
perhaps most precious resource. 
</P>
<P>
The characterization in the Los Angeles Times of district constituents as 
"violators," and the implication that the district board intends to punish 
anyone, is inappropriate and wrong. The Concerned Citizens Committee for the 
Casitas Municipal Water District thanks the district board, general manager and 
staff for their willingness to tackle difficult and complex matters, and 
applauds their efforts.

NEEDS OF PEOPLE ALREADY HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Instead of just listening to the proponents' tune that the Measure A sales tax 
is a necessity, think about some alternatives. Think about needs that are not 
being met in our neighborhoods and cities. 
</P>
<P>
Think about the need for adequate child care in thousands of families every 
day. Think about the need for adequate advance training to help high school 
graduates enter the work force. Think about preservation of open space so that 
Ventura County doesn't become wall-to-wall houses as is typical of the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Before giving a half-billion dollars to pay for road improvements that will 
open new land for development and help make certain landowners rich, think 
instead about the needs of our families and neighbors. Then ask: Couldn't the 
same money be better spent on meeting the health, education and environmental 
quality needs of people who are already here?

CITY COUNCIL PRIORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having known John Etter for some time, as well as having served on a 
Neighborhood Council Executive Board with him, I have observed many of his 
special attributes which the Simi Valley City Council desperately needs now. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, in my view, Etter maintains exemplary standards regarding 
environmental issues. He holds the environment in the highest regard, whether 
the issues are tree preservation, hillside protection, natural flood control or 
just plain aesthetics. 
</P>
<P>
These issues deserve the highest priority now more than ever, and they need a 
clear voice on City Council. And Etter, like no other City Council candidate, 
gives them the high priority and diligence that they deserve.

COUNTY ISSUE / IS IT TIME FOR DISTRICT ELECTIONS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than half of Oxnard's population is Latino, yet only three Latinos have 
been elected to City Council. Minority rights advocates blame this on at-large 
elections and back a single-member district system in which neighborhoods elect 
a council representative. Should Oxnard adopt a single-member district system? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jack T. Fowler 
</P>
<P>
President, Oxnard Elementary School District 
</P>
<P>
 No. I think it tends to lead to bad government in relatively small 
geographical areas and Oxnard is certainly that. People become very parochial. 
They feel they represent a particular group or part 
</P>
<P>
of the city and their governing decisions are based on being able to say to 
their constituency, look what I've done for you, and they're not concerned with 
the rest of the city. Also, I find it very interesting that we always talk 
about Hispanic percentages, based on somebody's last name. Yet we're very aware 
the Hispanic population has increased and many of these people who are here 
were not born here but entered the country illegally, are not citizens and 
don't have the right to vote. It seems to me advocacy groups will advocate the 
right to vote for anyone. I think that the city of Oxnard has a pretty good 
record of electing people regardless of their racial heritage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
M. Carmen Ramirez 
</P>
<P>
Executive director, Channel Counties Legal Services Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes. I think that the historical results of having three Latinos elected, 
which is maybe better than other communities in Ventura County, in comparison 
with the population are pathetic. It just doesn't seem 
</P>
<P>
fair to have people not really responsive to the different sectors of the 
community. Although Oxnard has had a couple of excellent people elected, we 
also have a pretty ethnically mixed city being governed by people who are not. 
I just think it's always more democratic to have single-member districts 
because a particular sector can elect a person to represent their interests. In 
Colonia and south Oxnard we don't have any people. If the elected official sees 
what kinds of problems are just outside on the sidewalk, then you're going to 
have a more responsive government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Joaquin G. Avila 
</P>
<P>
Voting rights attorney 
</P>
<P>
 Yes. In a place like Oxnard which has over 50% of its population Latino, it 
doesn't necessarily translate to 50% Latino eligible voters. When you have 
racially polarized voting, it's a recipe for 
</P>
<P>
defeat of those candidates that are preferred by the minority community. I 
don't think that the elected officials just represent citizens or voters, they 
represent everyone. They represent kids, people who come in from other parts of 
the state or move into the area from other parts of the country. They have a 
duty to represent everyone. Usually everyone is paying taxes and contributing 
to the economy, so in essence any limitation in that regard would be taxation 
without representation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nao Takasugi 
</P>
<P>
Mayor of Oxnard 
</P>
<P>
 Well I think that's a question that needs to be studied. Also it would 
probably need to be put to a vote of the people to determine if they wish to 
establish the system. I understand that 
</P>
<P>
this would certainly give representation to every geographical area of the 
city, in that every area would be represented by some council person with 
perhaps the majority being elected as our at-large representative. Under the 
district form of representation the needs of a particular district may be 
placed above the needs of the city as a whole and there is that danger. 
However, that could be probably ameliorated if the district representatives 
were elected by the entire electorate of the city rather than just by voters of 
that district. It's a question of by or from the district. I certainly would 
favor taking this to the electorate and see what they would like to see 
accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
John L. Soria 
</P>
<P>
Candidate for mayor of Oxnard 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, without a doubt the city should adopt a single-member district system. I 
think it's only fair in cities such as Oxnard. It's no longer a rural community 
where everyone knows 
</P>
<P>
everybody else. This system would lend itself to greater participation in the 
elections because the candidates would be known to the people in the 
neighborhoods. And more participants would seek election. The people would see 
the results of their voting and their campaigning in their neighborhoods. The 
representatives would be advocates for their particular area and concerns. And 
elections wouldn't be lost to candidates receiving large contributions from 
outside the area. Over the last several years developers have had an inordinate 
amount of influence in how Oxnard is developing.

BUSH, CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS TO TALK ON GULF

President Bush said today that he will meet Tuesday with congressional leaders 
about the U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf, a deployment that could 
expand while Congress is adjourned. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney raised the possibility last week that up to 
100,000 more American troops could be added to the U.S. presence in the region, 
bringing the total to 310,000. 
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers have raised concerns about dramatic changes being made in the 
U.S. deployment without their input. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to having talks with members of the leadership tomorrow," 
Bush told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also described the infighting over the budget approved last weekend as 
"class warfare." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's coast-to-coast traveling comes as a Newsweek poll out this weekend 
showed a dramatic plunge in the public's approval rating for his job 
performance. The drop coincides with public worries over the worsening economy 
and Washington's sluggish attempts to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
During a 10-minute news conference on the Tarmac at San Francisco International 
Airport before leaving for Oklahoma, Bush told reporters that he did not put 
much credence in such polls. 
</P>
<P>
Bush made appearances today on behalf of Sen. Pete Wilson, whose neck-and-neck 
gubernatorial bid against Democrat Dianne Feinstein is the Republican Party's 
top state priority in next week's elections. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he came to California to stump for Wilson because winning the 
governorship of the influential state is important for the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
"The governorship here is enormously important," Bush said. "It has national 
importance. I like the feel of this campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Bush has visited the state several times to stump for Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
After attending a $25,000-per-couple breakfast for Wilson at a private 
residence, Bush later today headed to Oklahoma to campaign for GOP 
gubernatorial candidate Bill Price. 
</P>
<P>
Security forces kept crowds away from the airport where Bush gave his news 
conference, but about 20 people managed to discover the location of the private 
breakfast Bush attended from 7:55 a.m. until about 9 a.m. in Hillsborough, a 
wealthy suburb in the south Bay area. About 50 people attended the breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
"This doesn't happen every day," said Scott Williams, who played hooky from 
work to take his two children, 9 and 6, to catch a glimpse of Bush as his 
motorcade drove away from the private residence. "I wanted my kids to get a 
chance to see the President."

U.N. SAYS IRAQ MUST PAY; 
</P>
<P>
FRANCE SHUTS ITS EMBASSY IN KUWAIT

<P>
The U.N. Security Council today adopted a resolution holding Iraq responsible 
for war damages and asking states to document financial losses and mistreatment 
of civilians arising from Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was 13 in favor and none against, with abstentions by Cuba and Yemen. 
</P>
<P>
The draft was sponsored by Britain, Canada, Finland, France, Romania, the 
United States, the Soviet Union and Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, which touches on various aspects of the Iraqi occupation, also 
demands an end to all hostage-taking and a halt to the destruction of property 
by Iraqi forces in Kuwait. It says Baghdad must resupply foreigners and the few 
embassies operating in Kuwait with adequate food and water. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, France ordered its diplomats to quit their besieged embassy in 
Kuwait and return home with 300 French hostages being freed by Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
That left just two embassies defying Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's order to 
close -- the United States and the British. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. vote had been scheduled for Saturday, but in a last-minute turnaround, 
the Soviet Union asked the council for a postponement in the hope that talks in 
Baghdad between Soviet envoy Yevgeny Primakov and Iraqi leaders would lead to a 
peaceful solution of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
But Primakov left Baghdad early today empty-handed after failing to persuade 
Hussein to compromise on Kuwait. However, Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev, speaking in Paris, held out hopes Iraq may yet be willing to give 
ground in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The new resolution sets up a mechanism that would make Iraq liable for 
financial damages caused by its invasion of Kuwait by "inviting" all states to 
document their economic losses. 
</P>
<P>
According to Council President David Hannay of Britain, states will begin 
"systematically drawing up the balance sheet" to provide evidence "as and when 
arrangements are made" in a final settlement of the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
But the resolution does not say how Iraq is to pay for any damage. Suggestions 
by British officials to compensate states and individuals from Iraq's assets 
abroad have been put aside for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
It also asks states to collect evidence on Iraq's mistreatment of civilians, 
which some diplomats defined as a first step toward action on war crimes at a 
later date. 
</P>
<P>
However, several council diplomats admitted this would prove extremely 
difficult to carry out. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile today, hundreds of French citizens left Baghdad on a flight to 
freedom after three months as hostages of Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Among the French were the last seven diplomats who endured an arduous siege of 
their embassy in occupied Kuwait. Also aboard the flight to Paris were nine 
Greeks, four Britons, two Filipinos, one German and one Spaniard. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Airways jetliner picked up more than 50 French evacuees in Kuwait 
City in the early afternoon before flying to Baghdad, where hundreds of 
hostages celebrated with beer and whiskey as the plane landed. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced last week that it would allow French hostages to leave. France 
stressed it had not engaged in negotiations to obtain their release.

An American Jewish organization opened the first independent office to monitor 
human rights in the Soviet Union today and vowed to defend all Soviet citizens 
in need of help. 
</P>
<P>
David Waksberg, vice president of the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews, 
acknowledged that a major goal of the new bureau is to help Jews who want to 
emigrate from the Soviet Union, but he said it also has a wider purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"The rights of Jews are intimately involved with the rights of all Soviet 
citizens (and) will be viewed in the context of general human rights in this 
country," Waksberg told reporters. To underscore the point, the office will 
share space with the Moscow Helsinki Monitoring Group.

K.C. POLICE UNDER FIRE AFTER SHOOTING

<P>
The accidental shooting death of a young stockbroker by an officer looking for 
a burglar is one more strike against a police force already struggling with 
allegations of brutality and racism. 
</P>
<P>
Terry D. Barnes, 24, was shot between the eyes in his apartment over the 
weekend. Police said an officer investigating a report of a prowler had entered 
the apartment at 3:30 a.m. and fired after Barnes got out of bed to see what 
was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
It was the seventh shooting death involving Kansas City police officers this 
year. In the previous three years, five people were shot and killed. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope that this case will draw the line on where the police can kill an 
innocent man. Where do you draw the line?" said roommate Andy Brez, 23, who was 
sleeping in another bedroom when police entered Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes was white, as is the officer who shot him; however, other recent 
incidents of alleged excessive force involved black citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they were told that the prowler might have run to the floor on 
which Barnes lived. Two police officers, whose names were not disclosed, 
noticed that the door to his apartment was not tightly shut and entered, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
An officer encountered Barnes, unarmed, in a T-shirt and boxer shorts, standing 
in his bedroom, police spokesman Sgt. Greg Mills said. Barnes made "a kind of 
lunging motion," and the officer fired from about 5 to 8 feet, Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
Friends of Barnes questioned whether his apartment door was ajar and whether he 
would have lunged at the officer. 
</P>
<P>
In June, several white officers bloodied a Nigerian-born Roman Catholic priest 
with nightsticks as he lay on the ground. Father Joseph Okoye said officers who 
stopped him on suspicion of drunken driving mistook his foreign accent for 
drunken speech. 
</P>
<P>
In May, another black clergyman was hit on the head with a shotgun by a white 
officer while lying on the ground. Police said a youth in the car of the Rev. 
William Fountaine matched the description of an armed robber. 
</P>
<P>
In another case, three undercover officers were suspended for a shooting this 
spring that left a young black man crippled. The officers and the victim 
accused each other of starting the fight that led to the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Also this year, four officers riddled a man brandishing a barbecue fork with 15 
bullets, killing him. And an officer killed a man who was spraying him with a 
fire extinguisher. No officer involved in the two killings was charged. 
</P>
<P>
The officer who shot Barnes was a two-year veteran of the force. He was placed 
on paid leave pending a police inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tragic chain of events that is regrettable for Mr. Barnes' family 
and for this officer," Bishop said. "The officers were reacting appropriately 
to a number of circumstances which together led them to that apartment."

<P>
Lottery officials said today that Thomlinson, 42, a bartender at the Green

ticket while cleaning the bar Friday and discovered he had won $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
The ticket was a gift Thursday night from Newport resident Russell Clark, who 
frequents bars and often leaves lottery tickets as tips, according to Ray

American Express Co. today announced new services that will let cardholders 
bill long-distance telephone calls using their familiar green charge cards. 
</P>
<P>
The move heats up competition in the credit card market for telephone services, 
following AT&amp;T's introduction of its Universal card earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
American Express said the service will eliminate separate long-distance 
telephone bills for users and can lessen the number of cards people carry when 
traveling. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based travel and financial services company said members will be 
able to have long-distance calls placed via MCI or US Sprint billed to their 
American Express card accounts. 
</P>
<P>
It said the billing statements will include full details, including date, time, 
place, number called, length and amount of the call. With the service, called 
Connect Plus, calls may be billed from home or while away, American Express 
said. 
</P>
<P>
MCI Communications Corp., based in Washington, is the nation's second-largest 
long-distance phone company after American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., which 
dominates the market. Sprint, the No. 3 long-distance company, is owned by 
United Telecommunications Inc. of Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
No exact figures on the size of the market were available.

Averting a split among the Daily News' newsroom employees, a group of reporters 
and photographers decided to remain on strike today rather than take up an 
offer to cross picket lines and reclaim their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're willing to give the strike more time," reporter Paul LaRosa said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no point in going back now." 
</P>
<P>
The News, hit by a walkout last week by nine of its 10 unions, had said 
striking workers were welcome to return to their old jobs at any time as long 
as permanent replacements had not been hired. 
</P>
<P>
A group of 40 reporters and photographers belonging to the 750-member Newspaper 
Guild sent a delegation to discuss the matter Sunday with guild President Barry 
Lipton. 
</P>
<P>
Some complained that the strike was called on the basis of a false report that 
replacements had already been hired to fill reporting slots. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of anger at the guild leadership," striking reporter JoAnne 
Wasserman said. 
</P>
<P>
But after the meeting, the group decided to stay on strike. The guild 
represents reporters, photographers and office workers. It could not be 
immediately determined how many guild members are honoring the strike. 
</P>
<P>
No new talks are scheduled. The News has said it plans to replace the strikers 
permanently.

Organic coffee and "retro-chic" appliances will be big hits in 1991, but the 
popularity of New Age religions and baseball double-headers will fade, "The 
American Forecaster 1991" predicts. 
</P>
<P>
Other anticipated hits are "success surgery" for executives, field trips for 
kids and "gourmet" ice. Home videos and the Southwestern interior design style 
will bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Long, 41, of Denver, began compiling the book on what's in and what's out 
in 1983. It sells about 10,000 copies a year. 
</P>
<P>
Organic coffee, grown without pesticides, "has all the makings of a major food 
fad," Long said. 
</P>
<P>
He predicts that the boxy appliances that marked the dawn of the post-World War 
II era will reappear next year. "It's the visual appeal, so solid and heavy -- 
the beginning of the Atomic Era," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Long says more executives will have cosmetic surgery and workers will eat at 
their desks so they can be more productive, signs of Americans' intensified 
interest in their work. 
</P>
<P>
The ideal look will be "relatively small noses, not a prominent chin, but a 
chinless look is unacceptable, and wrinkles would be out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, 1991 will not be the year for workaholics. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the '90s is going to be a fun decade," said Long. "Most people in the 
big 'baby boom' age group will be in their 40s and 50s. They will have earned a 
living and raised families. I think that equates to a potential situation where 
people will look to do fun things, to worry less about what the neighbors think 
or families think." 
</P>
<P>
A trend that has hit Japan and is expected in the United States is the 
popularity of "gourmet" ice. The ice, reportedly up to 10,000 years old, is 
chipped from Alaskan ice floes and valued for its purity. 
</P>
<P>
Next year will bring a reduced interest in New Age religions: "It won't die. 
But my observation is that it will just be less faddish." 
</P>
<P>
Long predicts a revival of interest in millennialism as the year 2000 
approaches, generating a fascination with "crackpot religions." 
</P>
<P>
Interest in home videos, a fad that soared this year with the success of 
television's "America's Funniest Home Videos," will also wane, Long said. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Fe fashion look, including laughing coyotes and cactus cutouts, has 
been over-marketed and will no longer be hip, the Forecaster says.

NFL: MONDAY REPORT; 
</P>
<P>
UNDER PARITY, MOST TEAMS EQUALLY BAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE GOLDBERG, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The byword for the NFL has always been parity, but almost midway through the 
season the word has to be parody. Seventeen of the 28 NFL teams are UNDER .500. 
That's 17, as in SEVENTEEN! 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in the last three weeks, just two of the 36 games have matched teams 
with winning records -- the two between the Giants and the Redskins. The next 
best was the 3-3 Steelers at the 6-0 49ers last week. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because so many of last year's playoff teams have fallen flat -- the 1-6 
Vikings, 3-4 Eagles, 2-4 Rams and 3-4 Broncos -- and none of the up-and-coming 
teams have truly emerged. 
</P>
<P>
So the 49ers and Giants are 7-0, and the Bears, Dolphins, Bills and Raiders are 
6-1. The Bengals are 5-3, the Redskins and Chiefs 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
And that's it. 
</P>
<P>
On the NFC front, the 49ers lead the West by four games, the Giants lead the 
East by three and the Bears lead the Central by two. The three will spend the 
rest of the season playing for home-field advantage in the playoffs and to 
avoid being the division winner relegated to the wild-card round. 
</P>
<P>
"We should win unless we do something stupid, and we don't plan on doing 
something stupid," Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor said after Sunday's 27-10 
victory over the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
The AFC is better off, but just barely. 
</P>
<P>
If the Raiders beat the Chiefs next Sunday, they'll have a three-game lead in 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
In the Central, the Bengals (5-3) were horrible Sunday night in Atlanta, but 
they're coming off a five-game road trip and have six of their final eight 
games at home. Houston, which lost at home to the Jets on Sunday, is only a 
game behind but has five of its final eight games on the road. 
</P>
<P>
So when is there an important game? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe next week in Kansas City between the Raiders and Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
Or Nov. 19 in Miami, a Monday night game between the Raiders and Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
Which is a good lead-in to Dec. 3, when the 49ers and Giants meet at 
Candlestick. 
</P>
<P>
BUD AND BUDDY -- Did Bud Carson save his job because his Browns rallied to tie 
the 49ers before losing on (what else?) Joe Montana's last-minute drive to set 
up a Mike Cofer field goal? Probably for a week or two before Jim Shofner takes 
over. 
</P>
<P>
Did Buddy Ryan save his job when his Eagles rallied to beat Dallas 21-20 on 
Randall Cunningham's 10-yard pass to Calvin Williams with 44 seconds to go? 
Probably for 1990 anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"I sure would rather have won than tried to figure out what to do for the rest 
of the season," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
WINNING ISN'T THE ONLY THING -- Winning may not be enough for the 49ers 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"I could swallow it better if we played our butts off and someone beat us," 
said Ronnie Lott after the 49ers edged Cleveland 20-17.

DAVIS' CRITICISM 'RUINED' THE JOY FOR REDS' SCHOTT

<P>
Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott is upset with outfielder Eric Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Schott said Davis' criticism that the Reds should have paid for his transfer 
between hospitals in Oakland and Cincinnati has taken her joy out of the team's 
World Series victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It has ruined it all for me," she said. "I just don't believe we have this 
after winning a World Series. I can't believe we'd ruin something as great as a 
World Series win with a silly . . . plane flight." 
</P>
<P>
Davis told reporters he is upset that the Reds did not pay the $15,000 bill to 
bring him back to Cincinnati from Oakland on Friday. He suffered a kidney 
injury in Oakland while diving for a ball in Game 4 of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, saying he will be stuck with the bill, complained that Schott showed "no 
concern . . . or any consideration" for his welfare. 
</P>
<P>
Schott said she is irked and disappointed by Davis' reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"I have stuck by this guy for five years," she said. "You would think this guy 
would have been rejoicing, but instead it's ruined everything." 
</P>
<P>
Davis took out a newspaper advertisement, published Sunday, to thank fans for 
the cards, letters and other signs of support he received while hospitalized. 
But he is still angry with the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said Schott declined to return his telephone calls about his 
transportation back to Cincinnati. He had hoped Schott would help set up a 
private jet to bring him back. Doctors said he had to fly on his back with 
medical personnel nearby to monitor his condition. 
</P>
<P>
Reds General Manager Bob Quinn visited Davis on Saturday and said their 
differences had been ironed out. But Davis said Quinn never brought up the 
matter of the bill to charter the jet.

SITUATION IN GULF WORSENS PROBLEMS FACING AIRLINES

The world's airlines face increasing turbulence because of rising fuel costs 
caused by the Persian Gulf situation, the head of the International Air 
Transport Assn. said today. 
</P>
<P>
Director General Gunter Eser said in the IATA's annual report that the 
financial outlook for airlines, already not very good in the first half of 
1990, had been worsened by the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"Fuel prices have been even more volatile than before and there have been sharp 
increases in hull insurance costs for operations in the Middle East," he told 
airline heads at their two-day annual gathering. 
</P>
<P>
Fuel costs generally range from 10% to 25% of total operating costs, so any 
movement in the price of fuel has a serious effect on the financial health of 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The price of oil has roughly doubled on world markets since Iraq invaded Kuwait 
on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Persian Gulf crisis, Eser said: "That is now the biggest cloud 
in the sky, creating business uncertainty but also actual hardship." 
</P>
<P>
IATA members agreed in September to raise passenger fares by between 5% and 8% 
and cargo rates by 7% to offset higher fuel costs. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 IATA report showed that the Persian Gulf crisis compounded a two-year 
decline in profitability despite gains in both passenger and cargo transport in 
1989. This was because interest charges rose by 27% while airlines competed for 
increasingly scarce capital to finance their fleets. As a result, net profits 
fell 80% to $300 million in 1989, the report said.

championship when his closest pursuer, Zimbabwe's Mark McNulty, finished in a 
four-way tie for fourth and won $35,207. 
</P>
<P>
Woosnam, from Wales, finished the season with $1,125,365, compared with 
$994,780 for McNulty. Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain was third, with $852,141. 
</P>
<P>
Woosnam's career earnings on the European tour climbed to a record $3.92

MAPLE LEAFS PROMOTE WATT TO HEAD COACH

Tom Watt, an assistant who has been running the Toronto Maple Leafs since 
Friday, today was named head coach of the NHL team. 
</P>
<P>
Watt becomes the 12th person to have the job in 13 seasons, and takes over a 
team that has only one victory and a tie in its first 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
It is the franchise's worst start ever. 
</P>
<P>
Watt, who was in his first year as an assistant to Doug Carpenter, was named 
coach on an interim basis when Carpenter was fired Friday. In Watt's only game 
as coach, the Maple Leafs lost Saturday night to the Buffalo Sabres, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Watt took over a Winnipeg Jets team that had won only nine games and 
compiled 32 points the previous season. The club responded by winning 33 games 
and collecting 80 points. That 48-point turnaround stands as the largest 
improvement in NHL history, and Watt was named coach of the year.

Denver Broncos running back Blake Ezor pleaded guilty today to attempted retail 
fraud and was sentenced to 24 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
Ezor said he agreed to the plea bargain to get the case over and to ensure he 
wouldn't be sentenced to any jail time. 
</P>
<P>
He originally was charged with second-degree retail fraud in the June 6 
incident at a Meridian Township store in Ingham County. 
</P>
<P>
The former Michigan State football standout said it actually was his brother, 
Burt, who switched price tags on a compact disc player and portable stereo. But 
he told the judge he knew what was going on, and abetted the crime by placing 
one of the items back on the store shelf. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not going to turn my brother in," Ezor said. "I told him I wanted no 
part in it and went to sit in the car." 
</P>
<P>
He said that after a store employee came running out of the store, "I could 
have drove off. I could have even outrun him. I did comply because I felt I was 
innocent. I know now it is wrong that I did not turn my brother in."

BACKLASH EXPECTED IN WAKE OF GO FOR WAND ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until the final yards, the duel between Go For Wand and Bayakoa in the 
Breeders' Cup Distaff had been a classic, one of those races that lovers of the 
sport would be watching on film 20 years from now. Instead, it became a 
spectacle that you can't stand to watch again, as Go For Wand snapped her 
ankle, collapsed, and then struggled to get up again -- only this time on three 
legs. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of any disaster, people invariably look for explanations, or 
for culprits. Most television viewers who watched, horrified, as Go For Wand 
was destroyed were surely speculating how this misfortune could have been 
avoided. 
</P>
<P>
But trainers, owners and veterinarians all know the distressing answer to that 
question: It couldn't. When Bayakoa's trainer, Ron McAnally, was interviewed in 
the winner's circle after the Distaff, he said sadly: "This is part of the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, there have been many cases where breakdowns of horses have been 
avoidable -- notably when owners and trainers abuse horses for economic 
expediency. In the 1970s, there was a justifiable public outcry about the use 
of drugs like Butazolidin that made thoroughbreds keep running when pain should 
have been telling them to stop. But such medications are illegal in New York 
and, besides, Go For Wand had been managed judiciously by Billy Badgett, who 
said Sunday: "She was the soundest horse I've ever trained in my life." Go For 
Wand, a 3-year-old filly, had been entered in the Distaff because Badgett 
thought that running her against males in the $3-million Classic would have 
been too stressful for her. 
</P>
<P>
Often, breakdowns may be traced to racing surfaces, and this was a popular 
suspicion Saturday at Belmont -- especially in view of the fact that two horses 
had gone down in the Sprint, an hour before Go For Wand's demise, and two 
others had broken down the day before. But Belmont has always been a 
well-maintained track -- neither too hard nor too deep. In any event, the 
mishaps in the Sprint surely had nothing to do with the condition of the track, 
for the colt Mr. Nickerson dropped dead of what appeared to be a heart attack, 
and Shaker Knit fell over him. Gerald McKeon, president of the New York Racing 
Assn., called this series of misfortunes a "statistical abnormality" -- and he 
is almost certainly correct. 
</P>
<P>
Thoroughbreds are delicate, finely tuned running machines, propelling a 
half-ton of muscle and bone at speeds up to 40 m.p.h. on narrow legs and 
ankles. If, for some reason, the animal takes one awkward step or its 
shock-absorption system fails for even a split-second, even a perfectly sound 
horse can be lost. It can happen in a $2,500 claiming race at Charles Town or 
it can happen in the most famous race in the world. But because Go For Wand's 
death happened so conspicuously, it is certain to trigger a backlash against 
the sport. 
</P>
<P>
The members of the increasingly vocal animal-rights lobby will cite Go For 
Wand's death as further evidence that thoroughbred racing is cruel and 
inhumane. But even people who considered themselves racing fans will be soured 
by the sport. That is what happened after the last such visible racing tragedy 
-- the death of Ruffian in 1975. In her book, "Tarnished Crown," author Carol 
Flake wrote that the great filly's death "cost the momentum of the sport." 
</P>
<P>
"Two years earlier, Secretariat's remarkable achievements had gotten people 
interested in racing again. (Ruffian's) death had told the public that racing 
wasn't . . . for those who loved animals; it was for coolheaded gamblers who 
could look at horses as numbers or chances in a lottery. . . . A huge audience 
had learned the hardest lessons that racing can teach about the cruelty of 
fortune, the overreaching nature of man, the fleeting nature of success." 
</P>
<P>
It is this mixture of fleeting success and cruel fortune that enables horse 
racing to stir emotions more deeply than any other sport, and which accounts 
for the enduring popularity of the game over centuries. In the last few months, 
even casual television viewers have had the chance to witness and appreciate 
the extremes of emotion that horses can generate. In the spring, as Unbridled 
was roaring down the Churchill Downs stretch to a victory in the Kentucky 
Derby, millions of people were touched by the sight of trainer Carl Nafzger 
clutching the colt's 92-year-old owner, Frances Genter, and shouting: "We've 
won the Kentucky Derby, Mrs. Genter!" And then: "I love you, Mrs. Genter!" 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, NBC's cameras showed the faces of Badgett and his wife, Rose, who 
was Go For Wand's exercise rider, as they watched the filly's final agony. They 
were clutching each other for support, fighting back tears, and they both 
looked dazed and disbelieving that an incipient triumph could turn into tragedy 
so abruptly. Those faces will be the most indelible images from this whole year 
of racing. 
</P>
<P>
We would love it, of course, if the sport could produce the joy without the 
pain, let us savor Frances Genter's elation without having to endure the 
suffering that the filly and the people around her experienced Saturday. But 
they go inextricably together. It's part of the game.

GO FOR WAND BURIED AT SARATOGA

Go For Wand, the filly who was destroyed after a nasty spill at the Breeders' 
Cup, has been buried at the site of two of the greatest triumphs of her short 
career. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-year-old filly was buried Sunday night in the infield of the Saratoga 
Race Course, the 126-year-old track 30 miles north of Albany. Officials said a 
marker would be erected on the gravesite. 
</P>
<P>
No ceremony was held to mark Go For Wand's burial. Track officials had 
originally said the filly would be buried today, and that the public and the 
press would not be allowed to observe the burial. 
</P>
<P>
Go For Wand won the Test Stakes on Aug. 2 and the Alabama Stakes on Aug. 11 at 
Saratoga. At the time, Jane du Pont Lunger, her 76-year-old owner, said she 
felt the Alabama was the most important race of her filly's career. 
</P>
<P>
"She has a kind of a sentimental place in her heart for Saratoga," trainer 
Billy Badgett said, referring to Lunger. "She thought it would be a good 
place." 
</P>
<P>
Badgett, who said he considered it "an honor" to have Go For Wand buried at 
Saratoga, said he was not planning to take time off from the rest of his barn. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough game. You just gotta keep going," he said Sunday night from his 
home in Floral Park, Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Badgett nor Lunger would be present for the burial, said Lenny Hale, 
senior vice president of the New York Racing Assn. 
</P>
<P>
In her maiden race on Sept. 14, 1989, Go For Wand won by four lengths. She 
culminated her 2-year-old season with a victory in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile 
Fillies and was named divisional champion off three wins in four starts. 
</P>
<P>
She won the 110th edition of the one-mile Alabama in stakes record time of 2:00 
4/5. 
</P>
<P>
At Saturday's $10-million Breeders' Cup, three horses died on one of the 
biggest days of racing. 
</P>
<P>
Hale recalled a conversation he had with Lunger after the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
"She said she was a great champion, and she died like one," Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Racing Assn. had offered to bury Go for Wand at Belmont alongside 
another great fallen filly, Ruffian, who died in 1975 after breaking down in a 
famous stretch duel with Foolish Pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
Shaker Knit and Mr. Nickerson, the other two fatalities on Saturday's Breeders' 
Cup card, will be buried at Belmont. Mr. Nickerson collapsed during the 
Breeders' Cup Sprint and Shaker Knight tripped over him.

MELVIN DURSLAG: BREEDERS' CUP HASN'T QUITE SERVED AS A TONIC FOR THE RACING 
GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An endangered species, not yet known to breed in captivity, the American 
horseplayer has become an object of worry among those dedicated to his 
propagation. 
</P>
<P>
At the last census, there were 75,000 thoroughbreds on which to bet on this 
continent, and candidates to carry out this worthy mission were vanishing 
slowly. 
</P>
<P>
Attempting to head off this distressing trend, race tracks have introduced 
exotic betting systems such as the pick six, super pick six, exacta, perfecta 
and trifecta, not to mention daily doubles and quinellas. 
</P>
<P>
They also have resorted to giving away gifts, ranging from beach balls to Hong 
Kong watches. 
</P>
<P>
And convinced that more yet must be done to develop interest in horseplaying 
from among the general pool of sports fans, racing has offered the last seven 
years a grandiose promotion called the Breeders' Cup. The Breeders' Cup program 
comprises seven races, worth $10 million in purses. 
</P>
<P>
"Racing needs a World Series or a Super Bowl," a Breeders' Cup executive once 
explained to us. "This is our answer. It brings together the world's finest 
horses. And the show is televised nationally for more than four hours. Such 
exposure has to create interest in our sport." 
</P>
<P>
It's a romantic idea and one of unmistakable merit, if you want to overlook a 
few flaws. 
</P>
<P>
First, the Breeders' Cup program, designed to attract the best horses, hasn't. 
Many horses don't come, turned off by airport crowds, security checks and 
reservations problems. 
</P>
<P>
As for television, ratings since the inception of the Breeders' Cup have been 
embarrassingly low. 
</P>
<P>
And, certainly, race crowds haven't increased and, in fact, have decelerated in 
most places. 
</P>
<P>
To add to the problem of the Breeders' Cup, they put the show on television 
last Saturday at Belmont Park -- and viewers think they are looking at 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
In the first three races, two horses are killed and a third is critically 
injured. He later dies. A jockey goes to the hospital on a stretcher. And two 
others are roughed up. 
</P>
<P>
So aimed at enhancing the image of racing and creating new fans, the Breeders' 
Cup winds up with viewers questioning the safety of the track and whether 
racing isn't cruel to horses. 
</P>
<P>
As a general rule, it is crueler to horseplayers. 
</P>
<P>
But what has happened the last seven years isn't what the sport had in mind 
when it created the Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
At horse casinos throughout North America, people were betting this year's 
Breeders' Cup races seen on television. At Santa Anita, for instance, first 
post was 10:55 a.m., local time, or earlier than the average horseplayer is 
accustomed to getting into action. At that time of day, the delicate cerebral 
turbine of this scientist hasn't yet fired, meaning that it isn't at least 
until the third race that he is functioning normally. 
</P>
<P>
So, finally in stride, he bets the 3-5 favorite, Go for Wand, in the third, 
and, a likely winner, the poor animal breaks a leg 100 yards from the wire. 
</P>
<P>
Watching this tragedy, and recalling that two horses fell in the first race, 
the player has lost confidence now in his ability not only to pick a winner but 
also to pick a horse that finishes. 
</P>
<P>
If the Breeders' Cup was to offer an upbeat moment, it would come in the fourth 
race, won by a rider named Lester Piggott, the Pete Rose of England. 
</P>
<P>
Like Rose, Piggott roamed the sporting scene an immense hero, the all-time 
horseback champion of his country. At 53, he is suddenly removed from society; 
he gets a year in prison for an oversight. He forgets to pay income tax. 
</P>
<P>
He is released from jail after serving his time, and England allows him to be 
licensed again as a rider. And he comes to the Breeders' Cup and wins a 
$1-million race astride Royal Academy. 
</P>
<P>
So the burning question is as follows: If English racing permits Piggott to go 
back to work, will American baseball do the same for Rose?

7 NEW INDUCTEES PICKED FOR ROCK HALL OF FAME;

Soul stylists Ike and Tina Turner and country-rock stars the Byrds are among 
the seven new inductees to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame announced today at a 
press conference in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Other performers to be honored at the Jan. 16 induction ceremony in New York's 
Waldorf-Astoria include John Lee Hooker, the Impressions, Wilson Pickett, La 
Vern Baker and Jimmy Reed. 
</P>
<P>
Howlin' Wolf was chosen as this year's honoree in the early 
influence/forefather category along with producers Dave Bartholomew and Ralph 
Bass as non-performing professionals. 
</P>
<P>
Despite legal disputes in the Byrds camp, all five members of the original 
lineup are expected to be on hand at the January ceremony. Byrds' leader Roger 
McGuinn said he was "thrilled" to hear the news. 
</P>
<P>
"What's important is that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has chosen to honor 
the music of the Byrds," McGuinn said. " Whether there is any personal 
disagreement between the band members is inconsequential." 
</P>
<P>
Ike Turner, who is serving a four-year sentence in the California Men's Colony 
in San Luis Obispo for a misdemeanor drug conviction, could not be reached for 
comment. Carol Pinkins, associate warden at the facility, said she doubted that 
Turner would be allowed to attend the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Impressions leader Curtis Mayfield, who was paralyzed from the neck down Aug. 
13 in a freak accident at an outdoor concert, told The Times that he expects to 
join the Impressions at the event. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking it day be day," Mayfield said in his first interview since the 
accident. "I'm very moved that the Impressions will be honored, and I hope to 
attend." 
</P>
<P>
More than 300 performers, producers, writers, record executives and 
broadcasters voted in this year's election. This year's 15 nominees were chosen 
on the basis of contributions to or influence on the course of rock 'n' roll, 
and all released records in 1965 or before. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has inducted 68 performers, 
non-performers and forefathers since the nonprofit organization was conceived 
in 1985 by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun.

Cobblestones will be put down today in front of novelist Anne Rice's house, 
where a movie company is filming part of a movie based on Kate Chopin's novel 
"The Awakening," starring Kelly McGillis. 
</P>
<P>
The novel, set in the 1880s, is about a woman who rejects Victorian moral and 
sexual standards, with tragic consequences. Along with playing its main 
character, artist Edna Pontellier, McGillis also is the executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
Rice's house turned out to be unexpectedly perfect for the Pontellier mansion 
because her husband, Stan, paints and has a studio on the third floor. 
</P>
<P>
"Our search for a third-floor atelier -- I guess that's French for studio? -- 
ended when we found that Stan already had one," location manager Mike Neale 
said.

Parents need to be disciplinarians rather than buddies to their children, 
actress Jennifer O'Neill says. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to have discipline. Sometimes we try to be their buddy over being a 
disciplinarian. 
</P>
<P>
When given a choice, you should be there to guide them. In the long run, it's 
going to be better," O'Neill said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill, who has a 23-year-old daughter and sons age 10 and 3, participated in 
a program titled "Today's Woman and Her Kids" at Johnson City Medical Center 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"As a single mother, having communication with the child's father is important. 
He's the only father they have, and even if you don't get along, you have to 
have unity," said O'Neill, 42. 
</P>
<P>
The star of "The Summer of '42" and former model said she has sold a script to 
Paramount called "White Lies" and will co-produce the film.

"I HATED to let you kiss me, I only did it because you begged me, you hounded 
me! And after you did, I used to wipe my mouth -- wipe my mouth!" -- Bette 
Davis as the slatternly waitress Mildred, cutting Leslie Howard to the quick in 
the 1934 movie of Somerset Maugham's "Of Human Bondage." 
</P>
<P>
All right, perhaps Bette's Mildred wasn't the nicest hash-slinger you'd ever 
want to meet, but her performance was the turning point of her career. 
</P>
<P>
And it seems that one of the best ways for an actress to attract attention is 
to portray a waitress! 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Susan Sarandon, who has garnered rave reviews for her steamy stint in 
the current sizzler "White Palace." 
</P>
<P>
Sarandon, who has been on the delicious edge of all-out movie stardom for 
several years, seems a virtual shoo-in for an Oscar nomination. 
</P>
<P>
She follows such famous cinematic hamburger hefters as Joan Crawford in 
"Mildred Pierce," Ellen Burstyn in "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore," Cher in 
"Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean" and Karen Black in 
"Five Easy Pieces." 
</P>
<P>
Even Elizabeth Taylor played a waitress once! (Maybe "Hammersmith Is Out" 
wasn't one of the great movies of our time -- but the sight of ET dishing out 
chow, in a blond wig and miniskirt was memorable.) 
</P>
<P>
BACK TO "White Palace" for a minute. Many are hoping that Sarandon's young 
co-star, James Spader, will nab a nomination for his performance in this movie 
as the up-tight yuppie who can't resist the way Susan slaps that burger on 
those buns. 
</P>
<P>
He was overlooked for "sex, lies, and videotape" last year.

In their annual Halloween look at what's up next year, American witches today 
predicted that Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and Oliver L. North will record a rap 
album attacking the Soviet Union and the National Endowment of the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Muffin juggling also will became a big fad. 
</P>
<P>
In the 17th annual survey compiled by the New York Center for the Strange, the 
witches also forecast shortages of volleyballs, garlic and chopsticks and a new 
book will claim that Elvis Presley was a Soviet agent. 
</P>
<P>
Not only that, Jimmy Carter, Michael Jackson and Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher will buy homes on Staten Island, and Dan Quayle will begin his 
campaign for the presidency in '92. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the predictions for next year: 
</P>
<P>
* Walter Cronkite will host a TV game show based on current headlines with 
Vanna White. 
</P>
<P>
* "Inspired by his close friendship with Jane Fonda," Ted Turner will launch a 
24-hour, all-exercise cable TV network. 
</P>
<P>
* Donald Trump will franchise a pizza chain called "The Don."
