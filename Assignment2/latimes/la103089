WON'T BUDGE FROM PARK, GROUP SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
HOMELESS: VOLUNTEER GROUP THAT FEEDS HOMELESS IN WEST HOLLYWOOD WILL FIGHT CITY 
ORDER EVICTING THEIR PROGRAM FROM A PARK.

<P>
A West Hollywood volunteer group that has served food to the homeless every day 
for the last three years says it won't budge, despite a recent order from city 
officials to move the program out of city-owned Plummer Park. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers for the Greater West Hollywood Food Coalition, which is partially 
funded by a $29,000 grant from the city of West Hollywood, said the city can 
cut off the money, but cannot constitutionally prevent the group from serving 
food to homeless people on public property. 
</P>
<P>
"We have decided we are not going to leave, are not going to be treated this 
way," said volunteer Ted Landreth. "We are citizens of this country, and the 
homeless are too. This is a public park." 
</P>
<P>
City staff on Oct. 17 sent a letter to coalition president Mike Dean telling 
the group it would have to leave the park by Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
City Council support for the program has slowly eroded in recent months after 
reports of violence, intimidation and unsanitary conditions began to trickle in 
from city park staff. 
</P>
<P>
"A worse element of the homeless has come to make up the larger segment of the 
total population they are serving. I have heard about some incidents of 
violence among the people who come there for food," said City Councilman Paul 
Koretz, who until recently had supported the giveaway. "The fact that the 
coalition does not do any kind of screening and does not adequately supervise 
the homeless has made this too dangerous a situation." 
</P>
<P>
But volunteers at the program that serves as many as 200 meals a day scoffed at 
"paranoid" reports to the City Council and maintained that their program is 
clean, well-run, and even helps prevent violence. They said Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies have only been called to the site twice in the last two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a clean-running organization. We are putting people back on the streets 
with a full belly instead of hungry," said coalition vice president Chip 
Ermish. Ermish said turning some people away, such as those intoxicated with 
alcohol or drugs, as suggested by City Councilman John Heilman, amounts to 
"using food as punishment. We will not turn anybody away." 
</P>
<P>
Ermish and volunteer Landreth criticized council members for relying on what 
they said was second-hand information about the program. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been a volunteer since we started, and what is astonishing to me is 
that since 1986 only one member of the council has ever been around to see what 
we do, much less to investigate complaints," Landreth said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Steve Shulte, who has consistently supported the meal kitchen, has 
visited the food giveaway on several occasions, at least once in Plummer Park. 
Shulte said evicting the program from the park may complicate the problem, but 
acknowledged 
</P>
<P>
that some undesirable things are going on at the giveaway. 
</P>
<P>
"It has a kind of rag-tag image. But after all, we are serving homeless people 
who are very desperate, not Beverly Hills housewives," Shulte said. "Now I'm 
afraid that not only are we going to have these homeless people out here, but 
they are going to be hungry." 
</P>
<P>
Shulte said he favors moving the giveaway from site to site to avoid 
concentrating a problem in a single location, but said the program should 
"tighten up so there are not going to be people who abuse others." 
</P>
<P>
Though the program was originally slated to end Nov. 1, the council approved an 
ambiguous resolution at its Oct. 16 meeting that coalition members interpreted 
as extending the deadline to Nov. 6, which would have allowed them to come up 
with alternative sites. 
</P>
<P>
Coalition president Dean said he had understood that the food group would be 
allowed to plead its case one last time at the council's first November 
meeting. But on Oct. 20 he received a letter telling the group the council's 
resolution had been "clarified," and that the group would have to be out of the 
park by Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Koretz said he believed the food coalition "has an extension until Nov. 6, but 
it is possible that because the resolution was so vague that staff could have 
made the decision," to cut off the program as originally scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Coalition volunteers said they held last-minute negotiations with city Human 
Services department officials, including director Lloyd Long, but that their 
proposal to move the giveaway from site to site was rejected late last week. 
</P>
<P>
But even if the city's order to vacate stands, food giveaway supporters believe 
they are on firm legal ground for refusing to leave the park, even if they do 
lose use of a city kitchen. One volunteer has even spoken to the nation's 
leading homeless advocate, Mitch Snyder, about the city's order. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder is the fiery, controversial, Washington activist who in recent years has 
become an outspoken critic of the way local governments handle their homeless. 
Snyder was the subject of a 1986 television movie, "The Mitch Snyder Story," 
starring actor Martin Sheen and praising his activism. 
</P>
<P>
"Snyder knows these issues backwards and forwards, what one's rights are. They 
(the city) have absolutely no right to throw you out of a public park," said 
volunteer Landreth. 
</P>
<P>
The food giveaway has been operating out of the park on the east side of West 
Hollywood since August, 1988. The program was originally run from the Crescent 
Heights United Methodist Church on Fairfax and Fountain Avenues, but was 
ordered to move by the City Council last year after neighbors complained about 
the program.

PESTICIDE POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the most part, President Bush's plan to tighten controls over pesticides 
that are used on or around food crops would be an improvement. But the plan 
also would give ground on two important aspects of existing law, changes that 
probably would be unwise and certainly are unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
In last week's briefings on the bill, which is still being drafted, the 
President and officials of the federal Environmental Protection Agency said 
that they want to cut the time it takes to get a dangerous pesticide off the 
market and out of fields and orchards by about half. The legislation also would 
improve procedures for registering chemicals and assessing the risk of using 
them, and stiffen penalties for violating pesticide regulations. 
</P>
<P>
One of two questionable features of the plan would change the formula by which 
EPA decides whether exposure to pesticide residue on food is so small that 
there is "negligible risk" of its causing cancer in a consumer. At present, the 
risk is considered negligible if there is a 1-in-a-million chance that the 
chemical will cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The President's plan would allow the EPA to set the "negligible risk" level as 
high as 1 in 100,000. EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said in briefings 
last week that the 1-in-a-million standard would continue to apply in most 
cases and it was not clear what factors the EPA would use in settling for the 
higher risk. Assessing risk is a subjective art rather than an objective 
science, so common sense says the low risk assessment is the right one when 
there is doubt about the data. 
</P>
<P>
The other proposal under attack would repeal the right of states to apply 
tougher pesticide controls to food products and turn standard-setting over to 
the federal environmental agency. The risk-assessment problem probably can be 
negotiated. Cutting the states, particularly California, out of writing 
pesticide law cannot be, particularly with the history of state laws as 
inspiration for tougher federal laws and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA's argument for uniformity stresses the difficulty of growing crops 
under a lower standard in one state and trying to sell the food in a state 
where higher standards prevail. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, though, the agency says uniformity of law already is about as 
high as it can get; even California goes along with federal standards virtually 
all of the time. One agency official said that "we actually didn't have a lot 
of problems with the way the law is now." The strongest case for uniform 
pesticide regulation is made by food distributors and processors. One industry 
spokesman downplayed the importance of the proposal by saying that only a 
couple of dozen of the 300 pesticides used on food would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
That is not a compelling argument against California's right to decide what 
protections its citizens need. The state should not budge.

Since the Supreme Court decision Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services 
earlier this year, I have read scores of articles in both lay and legal 
publications on its significance. Nothing I have read was as sweeping in scope 
and penetrating in analysis as Assemblyman Friedman's article. 
</P>
<P>
With tacticians as brilliant as Friedman leading the pro-choice movement, 
anti-abortionists may come to regret that they overturned the status quo.

NICARAGUA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How short is our memory regarding Nicaragua? Prevented by public opinion from 
launching an invasion of Nicaragua, the Reagan government bought and created 
mercenaries, the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
When the law said, "don't arm the Contras," it was continued illegally. Caught 
in the act, our government manages to supply the Contras, who still kill 
civilians in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has strangled Nicaragua with a paralyzing embargo and CIA economic 
sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to defeat the Nicaraguan people in other ways, it's trying to rig the 
upcoming elections. President Bush is asking $9 million over the next four 
months to buy the Nicaraguan election (Part A, Oct. 17). 
</P>
<P>
A small, poor country, receiving more than $5 American dollars per every man, 
woman and child, could have a consequential impact. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the U.S. money will not be seen by thousands of poor, war-ravaged 
people. $1.3 million will go to rent cars at $20 a day for presidential 
candidate Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's National Opposition Union party. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. senator is quoted as asking, "Do we really want free elections and fair 
elections in Nicaragua, or do we want an election bought and paid for by the 
U.S. government?"

CLIFF MAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OK, California, drop those barbecue aprons to half-mast and pause a moment in 
memory of Cliff May (Obituaries, Oct. 20). 
</P>
<P>
Here was a man who made practical applications of the American spirit of the 
times after WWII. 
</P>
<P>
I lived in a Cliff May-inspired house in Long Beach and, except for a Wilson's 
infielder's glove I used during the summers of 1958-1962, it was the most 
elegantly form-fitting piece of construction I have ever occupied. 
</P>
<P>
May's designs recognized and anticipated the middle-class social contour in 
post-war California: the need for cheap housing for the returning GIs; lots of 
space to expand for the growing families; removal of the public front porch to 
the private back yard -- sans garage, of course; open, flowing space within the 
houses to accommodate the interactions of family life. 
</P>
<P>
Since May there have been others who have interpreted the changing zeitgeist, 
notably the designers of all those apartment buildings with the underground 
garage and just enough height to avoid the terrible expense of high-rise 
building codes. In their own way, they are as important as May. 
</P>
<P>
But how mean-spirited and glum are these buildings compared to the glowing 
optimism of May's bourgeois charmers. What a lucky man he was to have designed 
the architectural equivalent of hope.

NOT FORGOTTEN, NEVER CRUSHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"They tried to instill into our minds that we would be forgotten in a few 
years' time," said a black South African, a former political prisoner. "They 
did everything to crush our morale." 
</P>
<P>
The "they" in this case are the South African authorities, and they failed 
completely in their attempt to break the spirit of their political prisoners or 
the popular black equality movement they represent. African National Congress 
leader Walter Sisulu and seven other South African political prisoners are free 
from confinement, although their liberation is far from complete. Their recent 
prison release, a gesture by the white minority government toward negotiations 
with the black majority, provided them the opportunity to tell the world about 
their lives behind the walls of Robben Island, South Africa's version of 
Alcatraz, and Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
After Sisulu, still-imprisoned ANC leader Nelson Mandela and others were 
convicted of conspiring to sabotage and overthrow the minority government, they 
were put to work at hard labor. That meant breaking big rocks into small rocks 
with a hammer, as a large guard with a swastika tattoo looked on. After a day 
at hard labor, they had to strip naked outdoors and wash down with cold sea 
water; black prisoners had to work in short pants and without socks, even in 
the dead of winter. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the prisoners fought back through hunger strikes and work stoppages and 
won concessions from prison authorities. Robben Island and Pollsmoor provided 
an excellent political education, former prisoner Ahmed Kathrada said, because 
they "really confirmed our belief that the South African authorities do not 
suddenly undergo a change of heart . . . nothing is done without pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Their countrymen outside never forgot them, as South African authorities had 
vainly hoped some 25 years ago. The freed prisoners emerged, morale uncrushed, 
and were greeted with joyful sobs from South Africans who were not even born 
when they were locked away. Largely cut off from communication with the outside 
world, they spent a generation of darkness in prison -- but they can be proud 
of the light they have helped to shine on South Africa.

U.S. ILLUSIONS SHATTERED IN SNOWS OF KRANOYARSK; 
</P>
<P>
ARMS CONTROL: THE SOVIET CONFESSION OF WILLFUL VIOLATIONS SAYS MUCH TO GIVE US 
PAUSE ABOUT THEIR BEHAVIOR -- AND THAT OF MANY PROMINENT AMERICANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK J. GAFFNEY JR., Frank J. Gaffney Jr., director of the Center for 
Security Policy in Washington, held senior positions in the Reagan Defense 
Department. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is perhaps appropriate that the week that saw the Soviet Union announce the 
"Frank Sinatra Doctrine" as the guiding force in its foreign policy began with 
the admission that Moscow had been lying for six years about a violation of the 
1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty. It is instructive that the Soviets 
themselves would see fit to draw a parallel between the entertainer with such a 
colorful, not to say checkered, past and their own behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Even more instructive has been the truly astonishing reaction to the disclosure 
by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze that Moscow had known for 
some time that its construction of a large, phased array radar near the 
Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk was illegal. By and large this admission has 
simply been accepted as one more indication of the wondrous benefits of 
glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
What seems to be totally absent is an appreciation that the confession speaks 
volumes about Soviet behavior -- and that of many prominent Americans. We 
ignore these insights at our peril. 
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, it is now an unassailable fact that the Soviet Union is 
capable of consciously and willfully violating arms-control agreements. For 
years, the Ronald Reagan Administration was berated for asserting this; indeed, 
some suggested that the very act of accusing the Soviets was proof that 
President Reagan was not truly interested in nuclear arms control. 
</P>
<P>
This observation is particularly significant insofar as there are a number of 
other examples of suspected Soviet violations of formal arms-control 
agreements. While the evidence to support these charges has not always been as 
clear-cut as Krasnoyarsk, it is only prudent now to assume Soviet culpability 
in these areas as well -- at least until an opportunity is afforded for a 
complete and independent accounting. 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis placed by the last Administration on the verification of 
U.S.-Soviet arms-control agreements is, obviously, fully warranted. Here again, 
his critics claimed that President Reagan's obsession with exacting 
verification arrangements was nothing more than an effort to sabotage the 
prospects for agreements. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, toward the end of his Administration, notably in the treaty on 
intermediate-range nuclear forces, President Reagan became considerably less 
insistent on effective verification -- even as Moscow became more adept at 
accepting inspection regimes that appeared intrusive but were, in fact, of 
little value should the Soviets be determined to cheat. The resulting 
procedures, especially if applied as precedents in other agreements, may well 
invite future Soviet arms-control violations. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze's confession on Krasnoyarsk provides an embarrassing indictment of 
those self-styled American authorities on arms control who for years contended 
that the Soviets were right in averring that this radar was not a violation of 
the ABM treaty or who, at the very least, trivialized the significance of this 
treaty breach. A list of those who made such representations is a virtual Who's 
Who of the U.S. arms-control community. To name but a few of these discredited 
apologists: McGeorge Bundy, George Kennan, Robert McNamara, Gerard Smith, Paul 
Warnke, Rep. Tom Downey (D-N.Y.) plus the Arms Control Assn., the Federation of 
American Scientists and the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
Incredible as it may seem, few -- if any -- of these individuals or 
organizations have had the grace to admit their errors. To the contrary, we are 
now being told that the Soviet admission on Krasnoyarsk, and Moscow's stated 
determination to tear down this illegal radar, in no way vindicates the firm 
and outspoken position taken by the United States government about Soviet 
non-compliance. 
</P>
<P>
This is simply absurd. Even if one takes at face value Shevardnadze's 
preposterous statement that it took Moscow four years to "sort out" the facts 
with respect to the illegal character of the Krasnoyarsk facility, there is 
simply no reason to believe that such a sorting out would have taken place -- 
let alone produced the results it did -- absent concerted U.S. pressure. At the 
very least, the demonstrated inability of such "experts" to assess correctly 
past Soviet behavior and to advocate effective American responses should call 
into question their future analyses and recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, it should be borne in mind that the Krasnoyarsk radar is but one facet 
of a comprehensive and ongoing Soviet program designed to reduce Soviet 
vulnerability to nuclear attack -- a program fundamentally at odds with the 
object and purpose of the ABM treaty. Even if the Krasnoyarsk facility is 
destroyed, we should be under no illusion that Moscow has abandoned its 
commitment to strategic defense. Instead, the United States must press forward 
with its own Strategic Defense Initiative, both as a means of providing for a 
more effective deterrent to nuclear war and as a hedge against 
as-yet-unacknowledged and future Soviet arms-control violations.

WEBSTER HAS DEFINITION OF KINGS: AWFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After being shut out for the first time in 262 regular-season games last week 
against Calgary, the Kings came to Winnipeg with a sense of urgency. But when 
the Kings beat the Jets Friday night, it got on a plane and left for somewhere 
else. Pittsburgh, they hope. The spiritless Kings stayed behind and lost, 6-1, 
Sunday night in the rematch against the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Having spent three days and four nights in a town that only Nanook of the North 
could love, it appeared as if rigor mortis had set in on the Kings by the time 
they arrived at Winnipeg Arena. But King Coach Tom Webster slapped that excuse 
away when it was offered to him after the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings were outshot, 42-20. They also were outhustled and outhit. But 
Webster had not seen enough. He called a practice for 8 o'clock this morning, 
three hours before the Kings are scheduled to catch a plane for Pittsburgh. 
They will play the third game of a six-game, 11-day road trip there Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Kings reserved ice time at Winnipeg Arena for this morning's 
workout before the loss. But Webster made it sound like a punishment when he 
informed the players of it Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he would not discuss his postgame remarks to the players. But he 
could not have been much more blunt with them than he was with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
When one asked how he liked the Kings' effort, a bewildered Webster said, "How 
can you ask that question?" 
</P>
<P>
Webster answered it anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just an awful effort," he said. "We did not come determined to play. It 
was very evident from the start. Winnipeg wanted this hockey game. We got 
frustrated when we couldn't score, and we quit working. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to sit back and give them the benefit of the doubt, but right now 
it's hit the boiling point." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike last season's coach, the taciturn Robbie Ftorek, who always appeared as 
if he needed a Rolaids, Webster is amiable and patient. No one was even sure if 
he had a boiling point. 
</P>
<P>
But after three truly terrible performances in four games since last Sunday -- 
a 7-4 loss at Chicago, a 5-0 loss at home against Calgary for the Kings' first 
scoreless game in more than three years and this 6-1 loss to the Smythe 
Division's last-place team -- it was no more Mr. Nice Guy. 
</P>
<P>
If any of the Kings disagreed with Webster's assessment, none dared talk back 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
Later, sitting on a chair outside the locker room with his head bowed, team 
captain Wayne Gretzky sympathized with his coach. 
</P>
<P>
"All three of the coaches are pretty frustrated," he said, speaking of Webster 
and his two assistants. "They've been patient with everybody, but sooner or 
later their patience runs thin. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're all very disappointed in the way we've handled ourselves. 
Winnipeg played well tonight, but we didn't rise to the occasion. We just 
played awful." 
</P>
<P>
They rose to the occasion 48 hours earlier, playing as if they had something to 
prove after Wednesday night's embarrassment against Calgary and beat the 
improved Jets, 3-1. But that seemed to satisfy the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
"When you win, you've got to be happy," Gretzky said. "But then you've got to 
forget about it. You've got to be . . . (ticked) off to play the next game. We 
haven't done that yet." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, who was held pointless for the third time this season, almost did not 
stay around for the end of the game. He was sent to the penalty box for the 
first time this season for high-sticking with 3:39 remaining. Unfortunately for 
him, it was only a two-minute penalty and he had to return. 
</P>
<P>
With 1:30 remaining, King goaltender Kelly Hrudey also was charged with a 
penalty for roughing after delivering a forearm to Winnipeg winger Paul Fenton. 
</P>
<P>
That certainly was the result of frustration. He said that he was angry at the 
Jets for not respecting his space. 
</P>
<P>
Hrudey could have been just as angry at the Kings' defensemen, who should have 
had to pay for tickets to watch the game along with the 14,367 fans. Hrudey was 
the only player Webster praised. The goaltender had 36 saves, one more than he 
had in the 3-1 victory Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
But when baited by reporters about his teammates, Hrudey would have nothing of 
it. He did not even criticize them for not delivering a new stick to him for 
four minutes in the third period after his broke. 
</P>
<P>
By then, it hardly mattered. 
</P>
<P>
For one reason, Jet goalie Daniel Berthiaume had his best game of the season. 
That came as a surprise to the fans, who booed him lustily before the game, 
because he gave up four goals in the first 10 shots of a 6-4 victory last week 
against Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But the Jets (5-6) got major-league goaltending against the Kings (6-6) from 
rookie Tom Draper Friday night and Berthiaume Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings, however, made heroes of a lot of Jets Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Left winger Brent Ashton scored not only his first goal of the season, but also 
his second. Defender Fredrik Olausson scored his first goal. Another defender, 
Dave Ellett, scored two goals. 
</P>
<P>
The lone King goal came on a sneaky shot by center Bernie Nicholls from the 
right side after he took a pass behind the net from right winger Dave Taylor. 
That came with 6:54 remaining in the second period. Winnipeg got the goal back 
three minutes later on a perfect slap shot by Ellett that sent defender Barry 
Beck and Hrudey sprawling. 
</P>
<P>
That is a good adjective for the Kings as they head to Pittsburgh, feeling a 
sense of urgency. Whether that is just a 24-hour bug or can be sustained 
probably will not be known until later in the week.

RAMS CAN'T BREAK THEIR FALL, 20-10 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rams extended the wrong losing streak here, theirs, and showed no signs of 
stopping at three with capable streak-stretchers such as the Minnesota Vikings 
and New York Giants next on the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
If the Rams were planning on playing this season in bunches -- five consecutive 
victories here, five consecutive losses there -- they seem smack-dab in the 
bunch that's rotting off the vine. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, the Chicago Bears were working through their own mini-dramas Sunday, 
attempting to shake the effects of a three-game losing streak, an 
injury-depleted defense and a quarterback controversy that officially broke out 
with 5:50 left in the half, when Jim Harbaugh replaced Mike Tomczak. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Bears had plenty left to defeat the Rams, 20-10, in front of 65,506 
at Soldier Field. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are in need of a football repairman. Their third consecutive loss was 
similar to the first two; the Rams couldn't stop the rush, run the ball, or 
keep balls from flying over their cornerbacks' heads. 
</P>
<P>
Stop themselves? The Rams did that well. 
</P>
<P>
There were glimmers of progress, especially on defense, as the Rams played the 
Bears to a 3-3 snug-fest late into the third quarter. But two big pass plays 
later, one over corner LeRoy Irvin, the other over corner Jerry Gray, set up 
the touchdown and field goal that sent the Rams to their corner. 
</P>
<P>
As opposed to past weeks, when sieve was the operative word in describing the 
Rams' defense, the secondary held its own for nearly three quarters before 
giving in. A fine week for the offense not to show up. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in the league 10 years and every day shows up in my face," Irvin 
said later. "I wonder what I'll look like tomorrow?" 
</P>
<P>
Bear defensive end Richard Dent, by the way, was able to wrap up a sore thigh 
and play some, leaving a piece of his helmet in tailback Greg Bell's chest on 
one vicious third-quarter tackle -- you had to hear it to believe it -- while 
also chipping in with a fumble recovery and a sack of Jim Everett. 
</P>
<P>
Sacks are becoming old hat for recent Ram opponents, an effective wrench thrown 
into what was once an effective offensive machine. The Bears took Everett down 
three times Sunday, making that 10 sacks against the Rams in three weeks. 
Everett was sacked only eight times in the first five games, all victories. 
</P>
<P>
Do you sense any connection? 
</P>
<P>
With the running game limping along with 84 more net yards Sunday, Everett is 
left to the mercy of the rush. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes sense," Everett said of the strategy. "It's something we have to deal 
with, especially with Minnesota next week. I'm sure you'll see them do the same 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Everett, rushed on many of his timing passes, completed only 13 of 35 passes 
for 185 yards with two interceptions. He has completed 46% of his passes in the 
losing streak, 65% in the five victories. 
</P>
<P>
"He's like all the rest of us," Ram Coach John Robinson said. "We're a football 
team out of sync. We were sailing along for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Now, all masts are down. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's game didn't get going until late in the third quarter, both teams 
mired in a defensive struggle highlighted only by Bear Coach Mike Ditka's 
second-quarter decision to replace Tomczak with Harbaugh, although it couldn't 
be considered a stroke of genius. 
</P>
<P>
Tomczak threw 11 consecutive incompletions at one point in the half, making the 
decision almost unavoidable. 
</P>
<P>
Harbaugh was a spark, no doubt, leading the Bears on a second-quarter march to 
a field goal, which tied the score, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
How was Tomczak taking it? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to get down every time something goes wrong," he said. "I didn't 
have a first half and it showed. That's why he took me out. I was excited, even 
though, because we started to put points on the board." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams had their best chance in the third quarter, with a first and 10 on the 
Bears' 43-yard line in a 3-3 game. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, who didn't start because of lower back strain, fumbled when the ball was 
stripped from him by William Perry, Dent recovering at the 44. It was only 
Bell's second fumble in 147 carries this season, but the timing couldn't have 
been worse. 
</P>
<P>
Harbaugh took over and marched the other way, the key play a 24-yard pass 
interference call on Rams' safety Anthony Newman, accused of jumping over tight 
end Cap Boso's back at the Ram 24. The flag was thrown late, much to Newman's 
dismay. 
</P>
<P>
"I touched the ball before I touched him," Newman claimed later. "The flag 
seemed to come five minutes later. There were no flags when I first looked. I 
guess that's part of football. Flags happen." 
</P>
<P>
After using a 14-yard pass to fullback Brad Muster to get inside the Ram five, 
the Bears scored on third down on a one-yard Muster run, giving the Bears their 
first lead at 10-3 with 39 seconds left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams went three-plays-and-out on their next possession, with the Bears 
taking over on their 30. Chicago moved to the Rams' 37, where Harbaugh burned 
Irvin on third and six by lofting a 36-yard pass to Wendell Davis. Harbaugh 
dived in from the one, making it 17-3 with 11:11 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams cut the lead to seven on a one-yard Bell run with 6:03 remaining, but 
the Bears came back, Harbaugh hitting Dennis McKinnon on a 41-yard pass over 
Gray to set up Kevin Butler's 46-yard field goal with 2:47 left. 
</P>
<P>
"In the fourth quarter, two passes were thrown over our head and basically took 
us out of any chance to win," Robinson concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Irvin concluded three good quarters of defense weren't good enough. 
</P>
<P>
"People have lost respect for us," Irvin said. "That's what hurts. We're not 
dominating anybody. We had Buffalo on the ropes and let them off. We had these 
guys on the ropes and let them off the ropes. It hurts." 
</P>
<P>
It's no secret that the Rams haven't had much spunk since the dramatic Monday 
night loss to Buffalo two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It all started in Buffalo, mentally, losing that type of game," Everett 
conceded. 
</P>
<P>
And another one Sunday, three in a row if you're keeping tabs. And another long 
plane ride home. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the game to point fingers," said Bell, limited to 32 yards in 12 
carries. "Everyone here lost this game." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dale Hatcher probably saved his job with a strong kicking effort, finishing 
with a 44.4 average in seven punts. Hatcher entered the game as the National 
Football Conference's lowest-rated punter. "I made up my mind, I knew I was up 
against the wall," Hatcher said. "This was a good test to see what I was made 
of. I prayed about it a lot." Hatcher said he wasn't nervous beforehand, even 
knowing his career possibly lay in the balance. "I was more nervous in practice 
than here," he said. "I just had that good feeling. That's the real me. That's 
the way I should be kicking." 
</P>
<P>
Bear quarterback Jim Harbaugh completed 10 of 13 passes for 157 yards. When 
Tomczak left, he had completed only four of 16 passes for 29 yards. . . . The 
Rams reported no serious injuries. . . . Gaston Green started the game at 
tailback but was out after five carries and 14 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Bell said afterward his back felt fine in warmups and that he could have 
started. "He's been making the decisions about how he wants to play me," Bell 
said of Robinson. "I didn't question his decision." Bell, however, did make it 
clear he wanted to play. "I just kept standing in front, helmet in hand," he 
said. "I was getting antsy."

RAIDERS FIND A CHIEF IN WIN OVER REDSKINS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: BEUERLEIN LEADS UNTIL HIS KNEE GIVES OUT AND HIS TEAMMATES FOLLOW 
TO A ROUSING 37-24 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's morning in Raiderdom, where they've finally spotted a light at the end of 
the tunnel that wasn't the headlight of an oncoming train. 
</P>
<P>
It was bright as the rising sun, happy as Steve Beuerlein's smile, right up to 
the moment that a Redskin tried to redesign his knee. 
</P>
<P>
Taking over for Jay Schroeder Sunday, Beuerlein came, he saw, he whipped the 
Raiders into a lead that grew to as great as 37-10 as they cruised to a 37-24 
victory over the Washington Redskins before 52,781 in the Coliseum, the largest 
crowd of this bizarre season. 
</P>
<P>
Was Beuerlein's enthusiasm the difference? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," Mervyn Fernandez said. "Definitely. He's a leader." 
</P>
<P>
On his way to a really big celebration, however, Beuerlein took a hit from 
Redskin defensive tackle Darryl Grant in the third period and hobbled off on 
what was diagnosed as a strained right knee. 
</P>
<P>
For caution's sake, he was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he was 
to undergo a Magnetic Resonance Imaging test and every other space-age 
technological innovation known to man. This could be the Raider future we're 
talking here, Doc. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I could go back in," Beuerlein said. "I tried to drop back (on the 
sideline) and it buckled on me. 
</P>
<P>
"Am I frustrated? Well, it ain't over yet. I'm hoping I'm ready to go this 
week. I've always been a quick healer. It really is tender now but by 
Wednesday, I could be 100% better, so we'll see." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders like what they've seen so far. This was their best game in, say, 
two years. Not since the brief Bo Jackson explosion against the Seattle 
Seahawks and Buffalo Bills late in the forlorn 1987 season have they been truly 
impressive. 
</P>
<P>
They were all of that Sunday in a performance that included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jackson's 79-yard touchdown run and 144 yards overall, in his first start. 
He now has a 6.0 rushing average this season and is on a pace that would make 
him a 1,000-yard rusher . . . despite having played in only three games, two as 
a sub, averaging fewer than 17 carries. 
</P>
<P>
He would have had an even bigger day, but his 45-yard touchdown bolt up the 
middle in the fourth period was called back for holding. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Greg Townsend's 3 1/2 sacks, giving him 6 1/2; Howie Long's 1 1/2, plus two 
tackles at or behind the line and a fumble recovery; the unit's seven sacks 
against the Redskin Hogs, who had allowed seven all season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Raiders holding Redskin rushers, admittedly without star Gerald Riggs, 
who had an injured ankle, to 21 yards in 14 carries . . . and minus-one in 10 
carries in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Raiders forcing eight turnovers, including two interceptions by red-hot 
Eddie Anderson, the stand-in free safety, one of which he returned 45 yards for 
a touchdown. In four starts subbing for the injured Vann McElroy, Anderson has 
four interceptions, two touchdowns and forced a fumble with a jarring hit of 
Christian Okoye. He also showed off the first choreographed Raider end-zone 
dance Sunday, the "Fish Out of Water," and announced his availability for car 
ads, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two touchdown catches by Fernandez in the first period, giving him seven 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Beuerlein, the catalyst for so much of this, left with modest 
numbers -- 11 for 22, 154 yards, two touchdown passes, one interception. 
</P>
<P>
But it was his game. He drove the Raiders 73 yards in seven plays on their 
first possession, finishing it by zipping an 18-yard slant to Fernandez 
slashing unattended up the middle of a Redskin zone. 
</P>
<P>
On Beuerlein's second possession, the Raiders went 50 yards in five plays. This 
time the outmanned Barry Wilburn, subbing for injured ace Darrell Green, took 
the inside away on Fernandez and Beuerlein floated a lovely, arching fade, 
eight yards to Mervyn, who took it easily over his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
It was midway through the first period and the Raiders led, 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt good coming into the game," Beuerlein said. "I felt a little nervous 
but I do better when I'm a little nervous at first. We jumped on 'em right away 
and everybody just really felt good about everything." 
</P>
<P>
The first drive was perfection itself, no play gaining fewer than five yards, a 
lightning-bolt strike for a team that had one first-half touchdown in three 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty nice, wasn't it?" Beuerlein said. "You can't draw it up any 
better than that. Bo was running the ball real well. The pass routes were 
clicking. The timing was there. The right calls were made. 
</P>
<P>
"People were on the same page. When you're on the same page like that and 
everybody's in cahoots and people are holding off up front like they were the 
whole game, it makes it a lot easier. I've just got to get it to the open guy 
and these guys get open." 
</P>
<P>
After that, it was fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
Moments after the Raiders took their 14-0 lead, they kicked off to rookie Joe 
Howard, who stepped into an alley the size of Pershing Square and went 99 yards 
for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
It was 17-10 one play into the third period when Jackson, who'd scuffled for 14 
yards in his preceding seven carries, found running room at last. Starting wide 
to the left, he cut back inside middle linebacker Greg Manusky, turned upfield, 
took a hit from the normally sure strong safety, Alvin Walton, who slammed into 
his hip . . . and fell off like a mosquito hitting a bulldozer. Bo got a 
downfield block from Fernandez and it was see you later. 
</P>
<P>
Catch Bo? Remember, he was timed at 4.18 in the 40-yard dash as a college 
senior, the fastest clocking for any football player ever to that date. Bo 
knows speed, for sure. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it's just one of those things," Jackson said, smiling. "I'm just doing 
what they ask me." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders weren't about to be caught, either. 
</P>
<P>
Townsend sacked Mark Rypien, who fumbled for the 10th time this season, and the 
Raiders recovered at the Redskin 14. Jeff Jaeger kicked one of his three field 
goals, from 29 yards, and it was 27-10. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson intercepted his first pass. Jaeger hit from 37 and it was 30-10. 
</P>
<P>
Redskins reliever Stan Humphries threw Anderson's second interception. Like the 
first, the ball skipped off a receiver's hands to Anderson, who scooped it up 
just before it hit the ground. As on the first, Anderson took off toward the 
right sideline, with a convoy of blockers. Unlike the first, when he tripped 
over his own blocker just as he saw daylight, he made it all the way, 45 yards 
into the end zone. Dance fever ensued and the Raiders led, 37-10. 
</P>
<P>
After that, the Redskins threw the last 29 of their 63 passes, making it not 
only one of the Raiders' finest games in recent history, but at 3:45, one of 
the longest. 
</P>
<P>
These routs can be tough, too, but it had been so long, nobody remembered. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
Howie Long: "I think Steve Beuerlein is a very exuberant, energetic guy who's 
got a real fever for the game. And I think it flows to the other people around 
him." . . . Tale of two quarterbacks: Jay Schroeder replaced the injured 
Beuerlein in the third period, was booed loudly and showed that his struggles 
continue. He went one for eight, the lone completion on a screen pass. "I don't 
think it was a hard week," Schroeder said. "It was a disappointing week. You 
know you aren't going to start the football game but you still keep working." 
</P>
<P>
Middle linebacker Jerry Robinson intercepted a pass thrown by Mark Rypien in 
the second period and took a fearsome hit from 290-pound Jim Lachey, separating 
him from the ball (Lachey recovered it) and his senses (Robinson left the game 
and recovered them much later.) Did Raider physician Bob Rosenfeld ask Robinson 
where he was? "He asked us where he was," Rosenfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Townsend, the "linebacker" who is actually an end on the Raider base 
defense, a 4-3: "I'm 99.9% lineman. I haven't been in coverage yet and this is 
what, the eighth game? I did stand upright once. I was told to. They told me to 
get back down the next play." . . . Townsend on the injured Gerald Riggs, the 
NFC rushing leader: "We were watching the film and he was making big things out 
of little things. We thought it was more him than the Hogs. I'm just glad he 
didn't play." . . . Going deep, continued: Beuerlein's numbers would have been 
better but Willie Gault, seven yards behind the nearest Redskin, dropped 
Beuerlein's pass in the second period, on what would have been a 63-yard 
scoring play. . . . The yardage in the first period: Raiders 161, Redskins 
minus seven.

MARINO STREAK ENDS AS BILLS GET 2 SACKS; DOLPHINS LOSE, 31-17

Thurman Thomas rushed for 148 yards in 27 carries and Larry Kinnebrew had 121 
in 21 tries and each scored a touchdown as the Buffalo Bills emphasized the run 
and the pass rush in a 31-17 victory over the Miami Dolphins Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills have won three in a row and five of their last six and lead the 
American Conference East with a 6-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
The game was played before 80,208 fans -- the largest crowd ever at Rich 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo twice sacked Dan Marino, who had gone 19 games without being sacked, 
and gained 280 against the Dolphins. Thomas and Kinnebrew accounted for all but 
11 of those yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills ran on 51 of their 60 plays. 
</P>
<P>
With Frank Reich at quarterback, Buffalo has won all three games since Jim 
Kelly separated a shoulder in a 37-14 loss to the Indianapolis Colts on Oct. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Wright snapped Marino's streak of 759 pass attempts without a sack in the 
second quarter, and Cornelius Bennett had another sack in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Marino also threw three interceptions, with Kirby Jackson returning his second 
of the game 40 yards for a touchdown with three minutes to play. Scott Secules 
then replaced Marino, who had 20 completions in 36 attempts for 255 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins (4-4) managed only 65 yards rushing in losing for the first time 
in four games. 
</P>
<P>
A 21-point second quarter by the Bills blew the game open and gave them a 21-3 
lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Kinnebrew opened the explosion two seconds into the quarter with a one-yard 
touchdown run. All 15 plays on the 76-yard drive were rushes. 
</P>
<P>
A Bennett interception at the Miami 42-yard line set up the score that put 
Buffalo ahead, 14-3. Bruce Smith, who stopped Dolphins running back Sammie 
Smith several times for losses in the first half, hurried Marino into throwing 
the interception. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas finished the four-play drive with a 30-yard scoring run. The play began 
as a sweep to the right and Thomas dodged four would-be tacklers before cutting 
to the left and into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
The final touchdown of the quarter came on a 63-yard pass from Reich to rookie 
Don Beebe. 
</P>
<P>
Miami's two touchdowns came on two 44-yard passes, one from Marino to Mark 
Clayton and the other from Secules to Andre Brown.

PATRIOTS EDGE COLTS IN OVERTIME, 23-20;

NEW ENGLAND: DAVIS KICKS 51-YARD FIELD GOAL AFTER MISSING 46 YARDER IN 
REGULATION.

<P>
New England kicker Greg Davis knew how to make up for his missed 46-yard field 
goal at the end of regulation play against the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Just move him back five yards. 
</P>
<P>
Davis kicked a 51-yarder at 9:57 of overtime, lifting the Patriots to a 23-20 
win. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe it or not, longer field goals are easier," said Davis, who signed with 
the Patriots as a free agent this year. "There's no pressure on 50-yard field 
goals. You are a lot more comfortable, especially in a dome because there are 
no weather conditions to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt coming into this game, it was going to come down to this, either 
(Indianapolis kicker) Dean Biasucci or myself to win it." 
</P>
<P>
It was the third straight game between the AFC East rivals that was decided in 
the closing seconds. Last year, at New England, quarterback Doug Flutie scored 
on a 13-yard run with 23 seconds to go for a 21-17 win by the Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the rematch at the Hoosier Dome, a 28-yard field goal by Biasucci with 
2:22 to go and a miss by Jason Staurovsky at the gun gave the Colts a 24-21 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's victory lifted the Patriots to 3-5. Indianapolis is 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't hesitate to go for the field goal," New England Coach Raymond Berry 
said of the fourth-and-two situation. "I thought he could put it through." 
</P>
<P>
The field goal was set up on a disputed pass reception by Sammy Martin at the 
New England 36-yard line. The game replay official said he couldn't determine 
conclusively that Martin caught the ball out of bounds, so he had to go with 
the call on the field. 
</P>
<P>
Indianapolis Coach Ron Meyer saw it differently. Had it been ruled incomplete, 
it would have forced New England to punt from its eight. 
</P>
<P>
"It was right in front of me. I saw it. But I'm not allowed to comment on it," 
Meyer said. "Obviously, you know my feelings." 
</P>
<P>
New England quarterback Steve Grogan said he didn't know it was completed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an awful throw but a great catch," he said. "I just threw it in the 
general vicinity and hoped he would get it. Someone hit me, and when I rolled 
up, I saw their bench screaming 'Out of bounds.' I really couldn't see what the 
official had indicated." 
</P>
<P>
Grogan, the third New England starter this season, passed for 355 yards. He 
completed 28 of 46 passes, both career highs. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question, he just played magnificently for the better part of the 
game," Meyer said of Grogan, 36. "His receivers made some good catches, and he 
had the ball right on target." 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots started the winning drive from their 12 after an Indianapolis 
punt. Grogan was driven back to his four on a sack, but completed three 
consecutive passes, including the 28-yarder to Martin, to bring the Patriots to 
the 44. 
</P>
<P>
Five straight runs took New England to the Indianapolis 33. Grogan recovered a 
fumble on the snap for a one-yard loss before Davis hit the winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Davis hit field goals of 47 yards in the first quarter and 48 in the final 
period.

COWBOYS' SKID CONTINUES; PHOENIX WINS, 19-10

Jimmy Johnson's 0-for-the-NFL ordeal continues. This time, a Tom 
Landry-schooled coach beat him. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Stallings' Phoenix Cardinals let the Dallas Cowboys make all the critical 
mistakes and cruised to a 19-10 victory Sunday as Johnson, Landry's successor, 
saw his National Football League coaching record go to 0-8. 
</P>
<P>
Stallings, an assistant under Landry for 14 years, threw a simple mistake-free 
offense and a blitzing defense at Johnson and rookie quarterback Steve Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted the clock to run in this game and that's why we were conservative," 
Stallings said. "We wanted the game over so that's why we didn't come with 
anything special on offense." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Zordich returned an interception 16 yards for a touchdown and Al Del 
Greco kicked four field goals as the Cardinals evened their record at 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
"I was right there when Walsh threw the ball and it fell right in my hands 
after it was tipped," Zordich said. "There was nobody in front of me. It was 
just a matter of catching the ball and taking it in." 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys' 0-8 start is their second-worst in club history. Only the 1960 
expansion team, which lost its first 10 games on the way to an 0-11-1 record, 
was worse. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson admitted his team was pressing. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying so hard that we're making mistakes," he said. "For the second 
straight week, our opponent didn't have any turnovers. I guess we are pressing 
as we try to make something happen and that in turn causes errors." 
</P>
<P>
Zordich's third-quarter touchdown put Phoenix ahead 13-3. Cedric Mack tipped 
the pass and the alert Zordich pulled it in. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody got a hand up and deflected the ball," Walsh said. "It was a big 
play." 
</P>
<P>
Stallings agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of the key plays of the game. That and the fumble by Shepard on the 
punt late in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Tim McDonald's fourth-quarter interception set up Del Greco's third field goal, 
a 31-yarder that made it 16-3 with 6:40 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, booed heavily by the crowd of 44,431, struck back with 4:27 to play on a 
37-yard scoring pass to Derrick Shepard, who outjumped two Cardinals for the 
ball.

Dalton Hilliard didn't want to get fancy. 
</P>
<P>
He just wanted to do his job. 
</P>
<P>
Hilliard accounted for 190 yards of offense and two touchdowns Sunday, his 
second touchdown coming a one-yard run with 2:12 to play, giving the New 
Orleans Saints a 20-13 victory over the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
Saints offensive tackle Stan Brock went to congratulate Hilliard after the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me, 'Hey, man, it's my job to get it in the end zone.' He didn't want 
any of that," Brock said. 
</P>
<P>
Hilliard rushed for 93 yards in 25 carries and caught seven passes for 97 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys up front gave me the option to go inside or out," Hilliard said. "The 
blocking was great." 
</P>
<P>
Saints linebacker Pat Swilling sacked the Falcons' Chris Miller three times and 
forced two fumbles, both turnovers ending Atlanta scoring threats and helping 
the Saints to their third consecutive victory after four losses in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"The big difference now is that everybody's making plays," Swilling said. 
"We're just trying to win some ball games and get back into the race." 
</P>
<P>
The Saints improved to 4-4, while Atlanta fell to 2-6. 
</P>
<P>
Saints scores came on a 21-yard pass from Bobby Hebert to Hilliard, the rushing 
touchdown by Hilliard and two field goals by Morten Andersen, one from 32 yards 
and one from 44. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Tyler blocked a 23-yard attempt in the fourth quarter when holder John 
Fourcade gave Andersen a poor set. 
</P>
<P>
All of Atlanta's scoring came in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons' Shawn Collins caught an 18-yard touchdown pass from Miller, and 
Paul McFadden kicked field goals of 41 yards and 48 yards, his longest of the 
season. The field goal tied the game at 13-13 with 4:06 left in the game.

Warren Cromartie began a three-run, fourth-inning rally with a double, then hit 
a home run in the seventh as the Yomiuri Giants defeated the Kintetsu 
Buffaloes, 8-5, Sunday to win the Japan Series. 
</P>
<P>
The Central League champion Giants rallied for the victory after losing the 
first three games of the best-of-seven series, Japan's version of the World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
In the top of the fourth, Norihiro Komada scored on an error by shortstop 
Yasunaga Makishi, Takayoshi Nakao had a one-run single and Masahiro Kawai had a 
one-run double to give the Giants a 4-0 lead. Komada had earlier homered for a 
1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants then extended the lead to 7-2 in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Cromartie has said this will be his last season in Japanese baseball. The 
former Montreal Expos star led both leagues in batting with a .378 average 
during the regular season.

FUHR IS STILL SHARP DESPITE LAYOFF

<TEXT>
<P>
Grant Fuhr was well-rested and eager to begin his season Sunday night at 
Montreal, but his Edmonton teammates were very weary. 
</P>
<P>
Although Fuhr showed early in his first game that he is still an outstanding 
goaltender, the Oilers squandered a 2-0 lead and were beaten by the Canadiens, 
5-4. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth game in eight nights for the Oilers and they finished the trip 
at 1-2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Fuhr, who announced his retirement before the season, then changed his mind, 
underwent an appendectomy just before the season began and missed the first 11 
games. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens didn't waste any time putting the 27-year-old Fuhr, a key figure 
in the Oilers' four Stanley Cup championships, to the test. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the opening faceoff, Sylvain Lefebvre went in alone, but Fuhr 
made a fine glove save. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Martin Gelinas and Jari Kurri scored to give Fuhr a 2-0 lead. The 
Canadiens scored twice in the last two minutes of the first period to get even. 
</P>
<P>
It was 3-3 before Russ Courtnall scored on a power play at 8:23 of the third 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 4, Boston 3 -- Clint Malarchuk is making the two goaltender system work 
for the Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
Malarchuk stepped in Friday night after No. 1 goalie Daren Puppa gave up four 
goals in eight minutes and played brilliantly. 
</P>
<P>
He came back in this game at Buffalo to play brilliantly for 55 minutes. The 
Bruins scored twice in the last five minutes to make it close, but the Sabres 
held on for their fourth victory in the last five games. 
</P>
<P>
Boston scored first, but the Sabres scored four quick goals in the second 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Malarchuk had 38 saves, including two difficult ones after the Bruins pulled to 
within a goal. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 1, Washington 0 -- The Capitals are playing excellent defensive hockey, 
but they suddenly have no offense. 
</P>
<P>
Trent Yawney scored in the first period at Chicago and the Capitals, 0-5-1 in 
the last six games, lost their second consecutive 1-0 game. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks regained first place in the Norris Division. DAN HAFNER

Steffi Graf of West Germany won her 13th tournament title of the year Sunday by 
defeating Monica Seles, 7-5, 6-4, in a seesaw final in which each player ran 
off impressive streaks. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, the world's No. 1-ranked woman, claimed the championship of the Brighton, 
England, indoor tournament for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not happy with my form earlier in the week, but today was definitely 
better," Graf said. "But I still made some mistakes that are not so usual." 
</P>
<P>
Seles fell behind, 5-1, in the second set, then won three games in a row to 
pull within 5-4. But after saving one match point on a ball that hit the net 
and fell onto Graf's side of the court, Seles hit a service return wide on the 
second match point she faced. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Lendl used his scorching forehand and some rare delicate touches to beat 
fellow Czechoslovak Miloslav Mecir, 6-2, 6-2, 1-6, 6-4, and win the European 
Community Championship in Antwerp, Belgium, for the fifth time in the 
tournament's eight-year history. 
</P>
<P>
No. 1-ranked Lendl earned the $220,000 first-place prize as he kept Mecir 
unsettled for most of the match.

Kevin Curren defeated Petr Korda of Czechoslovakia, 6-2, 7-5, to win the

HEART-BREAKING ACCOUNT OF A COMING APART IN AMERICA 
</P>

<P>
The Incorporation of Eric Chung by Steven C. Lo (Algonquin Books: $14.95; 199 
pages.) 
</P>
<P>
As a would-be scholar, I've been wondering for a long time what the term 
postmodern actually means; or what it is to be a deconstructionist. After 
reading "The Incorporation of Eric Chung," I think I know at least one working 
definition of both literary terms. 
</P>
<P>
They refer to the America that emigrant writers find when they come to this 
country, in which the imaginative "construction" they put together in their 
minds does not exist. The "modern" haven they'd expected has gone, vanished -- 
disappeared completely in a mountain of plastic wrap and condoms and cars that 
don't work. 
</P>
<P>
"The Incorporation of Eric Chung" is a wonderful, wonderful novel. But it is 
billed all over the place as funny. "Very funny," says one blurb. "I found 
myself laughing out loud," novelist Amy Tan remarks. And the editor of Fortune 
magazine calls this book "wry and canny." 
</P>
<P>
Are all these people in an elaborate conspiracy with Steven Lo to pretend that 
this is a funny book? Or do they mean "funny as a crutch?" My own take on this 
one, despite the cowboy boots on the cover and the smiling Asian systems 
analyst on the back, would be "heartbreaking and profound." 
</P>
<P>
This (autobiographical?) novel is the story of Eric Chung, refugee from the 
People's Republic of China before he's even born, calling his home the island 
of Taiwan where he remembers kids playing in open ditches for diversion, and 
the cops coming by in the evening just to see if there's someone around who 
might like to get arrested. Eric's father spends his life savings to send his 
son to "America," which in this case turns out to be Lubbock, Tex. (Sure, it's 
wry, canny, funny.) 
</P>
<P>
There are several other Chinese students at this strange Texan outpost: Victor 
Liu, George, Edward, Frank and Tang-I. These boys get in all kinds of troubles 
with the language, buying sanitary napkins for instance instead of regular 
napkins. Funny, funny. And when a round-eye attacks their beliefs, they retreat 
to their dorm, friendless and desperate, to sing the only three songs they all 
know the lyrics to: "Killing Me Softly With His Song," "I Could Have Danced All 
Night," and "Edelweiss." It's funny, but they're crying. 
</P>
<P>
Eric is eventually co-opted by an American hotshot who sells the idea of a 
Chinese-American Trade Corp. to another billionaire. Eric can help the project 
with his knowledge of his "countrymen." But Eric is as baffled by the People's 
Republic as he is by America. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chinese students drift away from each other, cut loose in the 
meaningless American system. They rack up broken hearts, smashed careers, 
crimes, misfortunes, a suicide. Eric Chung goes home alone each night to his 
apartment. Night after night after night. He becomes president of the company, 
then presides over its dissolving. Why? 
</P>
<P>
Why would an American billionaire go through this kind of meaningless exercise? 
"Don't ask me," the narrator seems to say. What he really does say -- 
Chinese-fashion -- is, "I don't want anybody getting excited, at any time, 
thinking I am going into a great romance or drama or even something important 
here." He's right, of course. It isn't important what happens to one man lost 
in America, where it used to be "modern," but where now it's falling apart? 
Where every "construction" is crashing down, and where it's next to impossible 
to get "incorporated" at all.

INTO THE NIGHT

The Scene: A benefit for Childhelp USA, the organization that provides a 
toll-free hot line for runaway kids. The Thursday-evening tribute was for 
designer/artist Zandra Rhodes, with an invitation-only reception at the Dyansen 
Gallery in Beverly Hills, followed by an even more invitation-only supper at 
Jimmy's. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: Zsa Zsa Gabor, the teachers' strike, police confiscating forgeries 
from some of the city's most famous art galleries. There's a lot to talk about 
in Beverly Hills these days. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: Zandra Rhodes; event chair Ellen Byrens; Childhelp founder and 
president June Haver MacMurray; supporters Frances Franklin and Monty Hall; 
B.H. Mayor Maxwell F. Salter and his wife, Janet; B.H. School Supt. Robert 
French and wife Mary; Ted and Rhonda Fleming Mann; Dyansen Galleries chairman 
Harris Shapiro and wife Jane; Gary Collins and Mary Ann Mobley; Cesar Romero 
and Anne Jeffreys, and several hundred of B.H.'s most staunch charity 
supporters. Dress Code: Those brave enough to wear Rhodes' unique creations did 
so; otherwise, it was dangerously understated power suits for the men and 
designer originals for the women. There was also enough full-length mink and 
chinchilla to send Bob Barker into apoplexy. 
</P>
<P>
Fashion Statement: Rhodes wore a pink and green gown of her own creation. The 
other sartorial splash was made by a man wearing pink pants and a water-filled 
transparent plastic tie containing live goldfish. Both man and goldfish were 
ejected. 
</P>
<P>
Chow: Hors d'oeuvres at the gallery; an excellent seafood salad, chicken and a 
chocolate souffle at Jimmy's. 
</P>
<P>
Trend Watch: People were talking about a new drink containing vodka, cranberry 
juice and peach schnapps. It goes by the name of Sex on the Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Money Matters: Rhodes' watercolors were in the $5,000-to-$10,000 range, with 
20% of the proceeds from the sale benefiting Childhelp. More money came in at 
Jimmy's with a $50,000 gift or two to Childhelp in preparation for a benefit in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
Triumphs: With so many events these days taking place in the unorganized, 
poorly run atmosphere of the latest bright-lights, big-zero private club, it's 
nice to see that Beverly Hills is still Beverly Hills. The evening was smooth 
sailing from start to finish. 
</P>
<P>
Glitches: Polite but overzealous security guards kept guests shivering in the 
cold autumn air outside the gallery. Perhaps they should be trained to 
recognize their city's mayor and police chief before the next event. 
</P>
<P>
Exit Line: Mayor Maxwell Salter to the crowd at Jimmy's: "Now all we gotta do 
is keep our other art galleries honest and we'll be all right." KEVIN ALLMAN

THIEVES MARKET REBORN FOR CHARITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's a Thieves Market? A place to steal a bargain. Junk mixed with goodies. A 
way to raise a charity dollar. And UCLA Art Council, with the revival of its 
once-famous Thieves Market, this past weekend combined all that. 
</P>
<P>
When the council launched its first Thieves Market in 1964, the event was a 
co-production by Frances Brody and the late Palmer Ducommon. Within a few 
years, the net had built to $290,000, making the biennial event one of the 
city's biggest fund-raisers. It was a place to find whole sets of sterling, 
antique chests and dining room tables with 12 chairs straight from the most 
elegant confines of Hancock Park. Over the years, until 1982, the benefits 
raised$1.75 million for UCLA art projects. 
</P>
<P>
Then costs escalated. Trucking fees for merchandise pickup became prohibitive. 
Finding free warehouses and sale locations became a problem. (Bekins Moving and 
Storage and Gucci both contributed warehouse locations this year.) Garage sales 
competed. Tax breaks made it much less attractive for donors to part with 
treasures. And, seven years ago, the market was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of it all, Art Council president Connie Nagler and co-chairs Marian 
Mandel and Muriel Simkin decided to revive the legendary market for the 
council's 35th anniversary. It got its send-off Friday evening with a preview 
show for 600 (tickets $150) in a hangar at Santa Monica Airport donated by Judi 
Barker, who moved out planes Wednesday for the merchandise that 800 Council 
members had spent thousands of volunteer hours collecting, carting, cataloguing 
and pricing. 
</P>
<P>
Friday evening, the live auction conducted by Bob Abell wasn't always getting 
top prices from an audience that had feasted nicely on Rococo-catered cuisine 
and wanted to chat instead of bid. The touted 1926 Ford went for $3,200 of the 
anticipated $10,000. However, with Angie Dickinson cajoling, the gold necklace 
she modeled brought a favorable $6,500 from Stanley and Marian Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the auction was expected to bring in nearly $60,000, and with the 
public sale, held Saturday, a total net of more than $150,000 is predicted when 
figures are tallied. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the audience had been at the first Thieves Markets -- Jerry and 
Virginia Oppenheimer, Judith and Dr. Franklin Murphy, Yvonne Lenart, Margot 
Bamberger, Hannah and Edward Carter, Mabel and James Pollak, Carmela Speroni, 
Rupert Allan, Lani Bernhard, Bob and Marilyn Ehrman, and Ann Straus. 
</P>
<P>
Most walked out with treasures and gifts that included luncheons for two at the 
Bullocks Tea Room. "It was a good revival," Nagler said. "I'm sure we'll do it 
again."

CRITICS CIRCLE PICKS 'MISANTHROPE' FOR BEST PRODUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Misanthrope," the La Jolla Playhouse update of Moliere's classic about an 
artist's frustration with the shallow values of his culture, won for best 
production at the sixth annual San Diego Critics Circle Awards ceremony held at 
the Abbey Restaurant Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But "The Misanthrope" picked up no other awards in a year when no one 
production swept the votes as the Old Globe's "Coriolanus" did last year and 
the La Jolla Playhouse's "A Walk in the Woods" did the year before. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the 14 winners were drawn from 11 shows and eleven of the awards went 
to the Old Globe (seven) and the La Jolla Playhouse (four). 
</P>
<P>
The remaining three awards went to the Lawrence Welk Resort Theatre for best 
musical ("She Loves Me"), Starlight Musical Theatre for best choreographer (Don 
and Bonnie Ward, Starlight's artistic directors, for "My One and Only") and UC 
San Diego for best scenic design (J. Michael Griggs, "Strindberg Sonata.") 
</P>
<P>
Only two shows, the Old Globe's "The School for Scandal" and its current hit, 
"Breaking Legs," won more than one award apiece. 
</P>
<P>
"Scandal," the Richard Brinsley Sheridan play about malicious gossip mongers in 
18th century England, garnered a win for Old Globe executive director Craig 
Noel as best director, (Noel was last recognized in 1987 with a special award 
commending his 50 years in San Diego theater), Paxton Whitehead as best actor 
and Robert Wojewodski for best costume design. 
</P>
<P>
"Legs," Tom Dulack's world premiere comedy about a playwright who gets into 
trouble when mobsters want to finance his play, picked up a best supporting 
actor award for Michael Genovese (who won the same award in 1986 for "Gillette" 
at the La Jolla Playhouse) and a best supporting actress award for Sue Giosa in 
her San Diego theater debut. 
</P>
<P>
"Legs," the only winner still running, plays at the Old Globe through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Globe, which had dominated the nominations for the October, 1988, through 
Sept. 16, 1989, season with 24, won all the directing and acting honors, with 
the best actress award going to Sada Thompson for "Driving Miss Daisy," Alfred 
Uhry's Pulitzer Prize-winning play at the Old Globe. 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla Playhouse, which picked up 14 nominations for a season half the 
length of the Globe's, won the awards which emphasized overall production, 
including best production ("The Misanthrope"), best road show ("Dangerous 
Games") and best new play ("Nebraska," Keith Reddin's story about tensions 
among the people who watch the missiles). 
</P>
<P>
But the San Diego Repertory Theatre, which had 10 nominations, including six 
for the critically acclaimed "Burning Patience" -- the most nominated show of 
the evening -- left empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego critics differed sharply from New York critics in their 
assessment of "Dangerous Games" as best road show. "Dangerous Games," 
co-created by Broadway choreographer Graciela Daniele and Jim Lewis as a 
dance/music/theater piece about torture, eroticism and machismo in a nameless 
Latin American country, closed on Broadway shortly after being savaged by the 
New York critics a little over a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
A Broadway failure of 26 years ago was also honored by the San Diego critics 
when they gave the best musical nod to Lawrence Welk's "She Loves Me." The 
story, about two people who meet through the personals under pseudonyms and 
don't realize they work in the same shop, has achieved cult status over the 
years in the regional theater circuit. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Critics Circle gave out two special awards in addition to the 14. 
The financially beleaguered La Jolla Playhouse, a strong presence in the awards 
scene since the theater was revived in 1983 after a 19-year absence, was 
commended for "outstanding achievement in choosing and sustaining a standard of 
artistic integrity invaluable as a catalyst in San Diego's emerging theater 
renaissance." 
</P>
<P>
Sledgehammer Theatre, a small, homeless theater which has made a practice of 
building temporary theater spaces in abandoned warehouses, was praised "for 
outstanding achievement in the creative carving of theater out of the void and 
their proof that rowdiness and art are not necessarily contradictory terms." 
</P>
<P>
The award winners were: 
</P>
<P>

</P>

NBC has stopped production of "The Nutt House," the new sitcom starring veteran 
actors Harvey Korman and Cloris Leachman. The first-year comedy series has been 
unable to hold a significant portion of the audience that tunes in to watch its 
lead-in, "Night Court," on Wednesday nights. NBC will air an extra episode of 
"My Two Dads" in the "Nutt House" time slot on Wednesday at 9:30 p.m. A 
full-time replacement was not immediately named. SHAUNA SNOW and CLAUDIA PUIG

OSMOND: COMEBACK KID STOPS IN ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL GREIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the next two months, you're going to be bombarded with pop-culture trivia 
about the '80s: The biggest new star . . . the top-grossing movie . . . the 
best and worst TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
But why wait for all the recaps? The instant-history award for most surprising 
comeback, pop music division, goes to Donny Osmond. 
</P>
<P>
Osmond, who headlined the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim on Saturday, had been 
counted out by virtually the entire music industry. But Osmond, the butt of a 
thousand "squeaky-clean" jokes, has had the last laugh. The Utah native scored 
back-to-back Top 15 singles this year with the frisky dance hit "Soldier of 
Love" and the soulful ballad "Sacred Emotion," and is in the early stages of 
his first tour in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The singer -- a star at 13, a has-been at 21 -- is now 31, and at the Celebrity 
he appeared remarkably untouched by his ride on the pop roller coaster. He made 
just one brief reference to his struggle for re-acceptance. "I've got to tell 
you, I have been looking forward to this year for a long, long time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Osmond's well-paced, hourlong performance featured all the songs on his current 
album, a mix of trendy pop/dance songs in the style of George Michael or Prince 
and a few medium-tempo ballads. His only nod to his teeny-bopper past was a 
loose, rhythmic version of the Osmonds' bubble-gum smash, "One Bad Apple." 
</P>
<P>
The performance showed that Osmond is a far better singer than such other faded 
teen idols as Bobby Sherman and David Cassidy, whose success owed more to their 
dimples and their TV exposure than their vocal chops. Osmond has a sturdy, 
elastic voice, which served him well on a tender reading of Stevie Wonder's 
"Love's in Need of Love Today." 
</P>
<P>
Osmond also showed that he has an understanding of, and an affinity for, 
contemporary music rhythms. It would have been easy for him to go the Wayne 
Newton route, but he chose the much harder road of seeking credibility in the 
pop/rock world. 
</P>
<P>
The key to earning that credibility lies in developing his own style. Osmond's 
recent hits are too much in the George Michael vein. 
</P>
<P>
Osmond, who is set to headline the Wiltern Theatre next month, interacted well 
with his racially and sexually integrated seven-member band. But he needs to 
loosen up, reveal more of himself, preview some new songs, take more chances. 
</P>
<P>
Osmond was effective on the one b-i-g chance he took -- a loose, playful 
version of Sly &amp; the Family Stone's funk classic "Thank You (Falettinme Be 
Mice Elf Agin)." (Osmond didn't fool anyone, however, when he pretended the 
performance was ad-libbed. That's the kind of show-biz phoniness the singer 
must purge if he wants to be taken seriously.) 
</P>
<P>
The strong response from the audience -- a mix of new fans and women who 
remember Donny fondly as their first big crush -- should give Osmond the 
confidence to experiment more as the tour progresses. PAUL GREIN

'REVERIES' SERIES AT MELNITZ HALL

<TEXT>
<P>
"Reveries" is the umbrella title given to four UCLA student films screening on 
campus tonight at 7:30 and 9:30, and it's a good choice. Though quite different 
in tone, ranging from childlike whimsy to grown-up doom 'n' gloom, all four 
feature protagonists who are profoundly alone in one way or another, given to 
daydreaming or wishes that can't come true. It's a lonely ol' night in Melnitz 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The best and most haunting of these is Bruce Muller's "Caruthers," which puts a 
severe, almost cruel spin on its theme of unrequited longing by making its hero 
a limping, disabled lounge drummer and the object of his affection a beautiful 
woman who leads him on and spurns him in equally potent doses. Set in two 
different desert towns, Muller's astonishing, aching mood piece isn't big on 
story but contains two great characterizations -- of yearning from Tom McCray, 
who beguiles with a smile both compassionate and nervous, and teasing from 
looker Audrey Wells, who suggests tragic pain beneath the uncaring mood swings. 
</P>
<P>
Also recommended are Suzanne Smith's "One Book, One Summer," about a schoolgirl 
in love with a book about pioneers, and Keping Qiu's "Au Pair," about a Chinese 
student working for an elderly Beverly Hills man. Robert Castle's "The Water 
Man" completes the bill. Famed director Robert Wise ("West Side Story") will 
speak as part of tonight's program.

A VERY SERIOUS 'IDOMENEO' AT WAR MEMORIAL IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are scholars who regard "Idomeneo" as Mozart's masterpiece. It is 
grandiose, graceful, eminently noble. It documents a daring expansion of 
conventional idioms and Baroque forms. It stands as an archetypically serious 
example of the ancient genre known as opera seria. 
</P>
<P>
With its symmetrical set-piece rituals, its concern for a vaguely heroic 
antiquity, its unabashed length and its blithe manipulation of Greek mythology, 
"Idomeneo" has never appealed very much to the masses. First performed in 
Munich in 1781, it didn't reach America until 1947, when Boris Goldovsky 
ventured a modest production in Tanglewood. The San Francisco premiere occurred 
only in 1977, and the mighty Metropolitan didn't get around to the challenge 
until 1982, when the title role served as an unlikely vehicle for Luciano 
Pavarotti. 
</P>
<P>
The new production at the San Francisco Opera, seen on Friday, is essentially a 
labor of love on the part of John Pritchard, the resident music director. He 
had assisted Fritz Busch in the epochal Glyndebourne premiere back in 1951. 
After the death of the great German conductor, Pritchard took over the baton 
the next summer. He went on to lead numerous revivals as well as a historic 
recording. This man knows "Idomeneo." 
</P>
<P>
At least he knows one version of the opera. It is a version based, rather 
loosely, on the edition Mozart prepared for an amateurish production in Vienna 
five years after the Munich premiere. This version, arranged at least in part 
by the uncredited Hans Gal, re-aligns some portions of the score, sanctions 
generous cuts and transposes the castrato role of the prince, Idamante, for a 
tenor. (Some modern stagings have coped with the vocal and sexual identity 
crisis by casting a mezzo-soprano in the part.) 
</P>
<P>
One can argue that there are better ways of performing "Idomeneo." Even the 
excellent San Francisco program magazine makes that argument ("It would be a 
mistake," writes Max Loppert, "to insist that this Vienna version represents 
the composer's last word"). One also can argue that Pritchard's affectionate 
scheme of music making -- suave, clean, eminently poised -- is somewhat at odds 
with the more vital, more florid style sanctioned by contemporary musicology. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the dedication and authority at work here are admirable. "Idomeneo" can 
be more exciting, more flamboyant, more authentic than San Francisco suggests. 
It certainly can be better embellished. But if this "Idomeneo" errs, at least 
it errs tastefully. 
</P>
<P>
The physical production, directed by John Copley and designed by John Conklin, 
reflects complementary conservatism. The quasi-Cretan sets -- a clever network 
of overlapping scrims and sliding wall panels -- project stylized vistas that 
accommodate classical cliches, literal details and gently surreal distortions. 
The costumes adhere to the banal but elegant anachronism of 18th-Century 
fashions for survivors of the Trojan War. The action scheme savors the economy 
of repose. 
</P>
<P>
The cast, generally able, turns out to be more notable for eagerness than for 
virtuosity. Wieslaw Ochman conveys the mature agonies of the titular king with 
knowing restraint and sings eloquently despite limited agility. Hans Peter 
Blochwitz -- a tiny jewel glittering oddly in his ear -- personifies refinement 
as his potentially sacrificial son. The other tenors in this tenor-heavy 
ensemble are William Lewis, a dignified Arbace sadly deprived of his arias, and 
Randall Outland, a High Priest with a high and feeble voice. 
</P>
<P>
The central women cannot provide the wonted conflict of lyricism vs. drama. 
Karita Mattila looks exquisite and sounds limpid as the virtuous Ilia. Nancy 
Gustafson looks equally lovely and sounds just as radiant as the nasty and 
tempestuous Elettra. Neither musters much force when it comes to the demands of 
ornate flight. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Cox, the lone bass on the premises, intones Neptune's deus-ex-machina 
pronouncements from afar -- too far afar. The chorus, trained by Ian Robertson, 
performs with resonant splendor and even a trace of urgency. In this context, 
one is grateful for any trace of urgency. 
</P>
<P>
Incidental intelligence: The huge nylon net suspended just below the ceiling to 
catch falling post-earthquake plaster has thus far caught very little. Nor does 
it seem to have had any adverse effect upon the reverberant acoustic of the War 
Memorial Opera House.

ECLECTIC ACTS AT STREET FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Quick: At what community's street festival would you expect to find a guy 
selling Ginsu knives next to a yoga meditation booth? 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood it is, where old age meets New Age -- literally, in the two 
musical acts that opened the five-year-old city's fourth annual Street 
Festival. On one of two main music stages Saturday was the spritely female 
geriatric sextet the Dixie Belles, while over in another corner of West 
Hollywood Park was the mellow jazz of the Ellen Schimmel Quartet -- both 
competing with the booming bass of a disco pavilion. Following the Belles, and 
eclectic in its own right, was the band Rotondi, with its polkadelic mix of 
Cajun and African rock: Post-Modern hipness you can dance to -- though no one 
did. 
</P>
<P>
The only disharmonious note of the sunny afternoon came when five people 
graphically but silently protesting meat consumption were removed from the park 
by security personnel. The vegetarians' leader, who identified himself only as 
Jingles, accused the city of ejecting them in deference to meat-selling 
vendors, but officials said that only organizations paying for booth space were 
allowed to use the event as a forum for their causes. 
</P>
<P>
The festival -- also featuring reggae group the Skanksters, Tex-Mex rockers 
Alienz, Latin pop group Tierra and country-rocker Lucinda Williams -- drew more 
than 100,000 people, event organizers said. The Sunday conclusion was expected 
to draw at least 150,000. STEVE HOCHMAN

PASADENA SYMPHONY OPENS 62ND SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Showoff programs sometimes materialize toward the middle or at the end of 
symphonic seasons. To begin the 62nd year of the Pasadena Symphony, however, 
Jorge Mester jumped right in with a bold agenda: Stravinsky's "Petrushka," the 
Fifth Violin Concerto of Vieuxtemps, and Ravel's "La Valse." 
</P>
<P>
In the event, Saturday night in the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, the orchestra's 
music director -- who recently signed a contract extending his leadership in 
Pasadena through 1993 -- made it work, and rather effortlessly. The orchestra 
played superbly well, in near-perfect wind-string balances and with brilliant 
solo contributions from the first-desk players. 
</P>
<P>
"La Valse" closed the proceedings with an illuminating clarity of instrumental 
textures and a Ravelian kaleidoscope of colors; this is the kind of playing 
Pasadena Civic does not always hear when famous orchestras from far away occupy 
its stage. 
</P>
<P>
"Petrushka," too, profited from a well-wrought, transparent fabric of sound and 
from the high energy produced by genuinely confident, virtuosic players. 
</P>
<P>
In between, Anne Akiko Meyers, the 19-year-old, California- and 
Juilliard-trained violinist, brought vigorous mastery, unflinching technical 
skills and stylish elegance to the still-viable Romantic requirements of 
Vieuxtemps' quirky but lovable A-minor Concerto. She made the old-fashioned 
rhetoric seem compelling, and faltered never in the apparently unending 
mechanical hurdles the work presents. Affectionately, Mester &amp; Co. followed 
suit. DANIEL CARIAGA

5 MORE DIE IN 2 HOURS AS GANG GUNS ERUPT ANEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five people were killed in Los Angeles County during a two-hour flurry of 
gang-related violence late Saturday and early Sunday, including two men shot in 
separate gang-sponsored Halloween parties and two bystanders in the path of 
bullets meant for a rival gang member, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A 24-year-old woman died, a 17-year-old boy was fatally wounded, and two men 
were in critical condition as the result of a shooting outside a liquor store 
in the Willowbrook area about 10:15 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's spokesman Bill Wehner said a teen-ager armed with a handgun yelled 
out the name of a gang and then fired into a group of about 10 people standing 
near the Direct Liquor Store at 12800 San Pedro St. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman fled with another youth in a small blue pickup truck that had been 
parked behind the store, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Store manager Floyd Frazier said the violence erupted when the gunman, who had 
been leaning on an ice cream cooler in the store, "like he was waiting for 
something to happen," encountered another young man who was standing outside 
the doorway. 
</P>
<P>
When the other youth replied, "Piru," the name of a Compton gang, the gunman 
opened fire and then ran toward the truck, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
The identities of the dead woman and the teen-ager, a clerk at the store who 
died shortly after arrival at a hospital, were not released. 
</P>
<P>
A 26-year-old man and a 40-year-old man were in critical condition at Martin 
Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center with bullet wounds in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
The violence continued in South Gate, where a 19-year-old Huntington Park man 
was killed as he and several other alleged gang members left a Halloween party 
on St. James Avenue about 11 p.m. to observe a fight outside between two rival 
gangs, said South Gate Police Sgt. Russ Galbreath. 
</P>
<P>
Four teen-agers fleeing the fight fired at the spectators, hitting the victim 
in the chest. The identity of the victim, who died after friends took him to 
Rancho Los Amigos Hospital in Downey, was not released. 
</P>
<P>
At another Halloween party near MacArthur Park, a fight between rival gang 
members spilled onto Carondelet Street about 11:30 p.m., resulting in the death 
of a 20-year-old man, Los Angeles police spokesman Roosevelt Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Delgado ran from the others and was chased by a group of young men, one 
of whom shot Delgado. One suspect was being questioned and five or six others 
are being sought, Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
In other gang-related violence, Juan Antonio Ramos, 33, was killed early Sunday 
by a shot fired shortly after midnight through a security screen on the door to 
his home on West 47th Street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A friend of the victim had argued with two suspected gang members in a car 
outside the home moments before the shooting and police speculated that the 
bullet was meant for the friend. Ramos responded to a knock on the door when he 
was shot in the face. Police said the gunmen and Ramos' friend fled, leaving 
the bleeding victim, who died at California Medical Center at 12:30 a.m.. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate incident shortly after midnight in El Sereno, three people were 
injured in an apparent gang-related drive-by shooting, Los Angeles Police Sgt. 
Mario Mojarro said. 
</P>
<P>
The victims, two men and a youth whose identities were not released, were 
leaving a gas station mini-mart at Eastern Avenue and Huntington Drive at the 
time. They were in stable condition at County-USC Medical Center, police said.

IRELAND UNDER ATTACK BY NEW ZEALAND WORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ireland has suffered a mysterious invasion from the other end of the Earth that 
threatens to do serious long-term damage. The invader, which has spread out 
across Northern Ireland and is now entering the Republic of Ireland, is a lowly 
New Zealand worm called Artiopositalthia triangulata, which is slowly wiping 
out the native population of Irish worms. 
</P>
<P>
How the 6-inch-long New Zealand worm got to Ireland nobody knows. But it is 
thought that it probably arrived in Northern Ireland as egg capsules on the 
roots of a shrub more than 20 years ago. Since then it has proliferated in 
Northern Ireland and has recently been found on the southern side of the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
The respected British journal The New Scientist reported recently, 
"Agricultural productivity in Northern Ireland could dip by at least one-third 
because a plague of flatworms has depleted the province's population of native 
earthworms by 90%."

PAROLE OFFICER WALKS A DELICATE BALANCE BETWEEN BEING A FRIEND AND A 
DISCIPLINARIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 5 foot, 3 inches, Mary Cupp had difficulty landing a job keeping ex-cons on 
the straight and narrow. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not much demand for a small, white woman with a Southern accent," 
said Cupp, 57, who was turned down for several parole officer jobs before being 
hired 3 1/2 years ago by the Van Nuys branch of the Department of Corrections' 
Parole and Community Services Division. 
</P>
<P>
Cupp, who has a background in psychiatric social work, a knowledge of 
government bureaucracy and a will of steel, has become an expert at securing 
social services for parolees who are mentally ill, physically handicapped or 
have a history of drug and alcohol abuse, her superiors say. 
</P>
<P>
"She is one of the most important people I have in this office," said Hugh 
Alcott, unit supervisor of the Van Nuys parole office, and Cupp's boss. "She is 
a tenacious little bulldog, and she will not take no for an answer." 
</P>
<P>
Cupp knows her efforts will not prevent some of her parolees from returning to 
prison. In fact, if she considers them a danger to the community, she orders 
them sent back. She said her top priority is to protect the community. 
</P>
<P>
"You want them to succeed," Cupp said. "And the more you know them, the more 
you like them. But you work always for the community." 
</P>
<P>
Before becoming a parole officer, Cupp worked with the mentally ill at 
Camarillo State Hospital for 12 years. As a psychiatric social worker there, 
she grew tired of protecting patients who came to the hospital merely to "beat 
a rap," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Cupp walks a tightrope between being a loyal friend and a strict 
disciplinarian to the 69 felons, many of whom are mentally ill, who are under 
her supervision. 
</P>
<P>
No statistics are available on the number of mentally ill parolees in 
California. But the total number of parolees is expected to soar from about 
54,000 to about 82,000 in the next three years, and to about 98,000 in five 
years, according to the Department of Corrections. Of state parolees, about 46% 
live in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Cupp said the Department of Corrections is hiring more parole agents to cope 
with the increased demand, but she has 69 clients, which is more than she would 
like. Cupp said she sometimes feels that she cannot spend enough time with her 
clients. And as soon as one case is off her list, another is added, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I do shotgun therapy," said Cupp, who makes $42,216 a year. "If someone needs 
to see me, I do my best to see and help them as quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Cupp, who moved to California from her native West Virginia in 1970, said her 
petite size has never been a problem in dealing with ex-cons, who often resent 
law enforcement officials. Sometimes it has even been an asset. 
</P>
<P>
"My appearance is disarming," she said. "I had one parolee who would just sit 
there and chuckle." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Cupp knows she is vulnerable. She said that because of threats she plans 
to take a weapons-training class next year so she can carry a firearm on duty. 
</P>
<P>
During the course of a week, Cupp spends hours preparing reports, finding 
housing for prisoners facing release, attending parole violation hearings and 
filling out extensive paper work. 
</P>
<P>
But most of her working hours are spent at her favorite part of the job: 
unannounced home visits. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent October morning, Cupp called on Jesse Duran, 40, a former heroin 
addict and twice-convicted burglar with schizophrenia. Duran, whom Cupp 
considers one of her success stories, now lives in a board and care home for 
the mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
"I have put him together," she said. "He is up to his capacity, and he is not 
hurting anyone, and all it costs the taxpayers is $650 a month. To me, that is 
cost-effective." 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't easy. She had to battle the Los Angeles County Department of 
Mental Health to get money for him to live at the board and care home, which 
offers the supervision, services, stability and shelter necessary tor keep him 
away from drugs and crime. 
</P>
<P>
The county lends money from its general relief fund to mentally ill people who 
require sheltered living but who do not have approved Social Security benefits 
or Supplemental Social Income. But before Cupp sought the services on Duran's 
behalf, the service was closed to parolees. 
</P>
<P>
After the county turned down Duran for a loan four times, Cupp found a 
nonprofit legal service that helps the mentally disabled gain access to 
government benefits. Cupp and lawyers for the service argued that by closing 
general relief to parolees, the county violated a state civil rights law. 
</P>
<P>
"If I want services for a parolee, there is no such thing as the word 'no,' " 
she said. "If he is out there fending for himself, he cannot supervise money, 
he is confused, and sooner or later he is going to steal again." 
</P>
<P>
During the morning visit with Duran in his small but tidy room, the parolee 
seemed like a shy pupil trying to gain the respect of a teacher he fears and 
admires. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't take drugs. I don't drink. I am a loner. I don't want trouble," he 
said. "I feel good. I have good health, and I am keeping my nose clean. I go to 
church on Sundays." 
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes after her arrival, Cupp was back in her unmarked car. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the parolees on Cupp's circuit deals with her differently. Sharon 
Larson, 39, the next to be visited, seemed to be testing her to see how much 
latitude the parole officer would allow. 
</P>
<P>
Upon Larson's release from state prison, she rented a room from a Panorama City 
housewife named Daisy, and found a job at a fast-food restaurant. On a previous 
day, Cupp had given Larson money to buy work shoes, and Cupp's purpose was to 
be sure that Larson had not bought drugs with the cash. 
</P>
<P>
While Cupp talked to her, Larson -- who has a history of methamphetamine and 
heroin use, and a criminal record stretching back 20 years -- sat at her dining 
room table and drank beer out of a red coffee mug. 
</P>
<P>
Larson, who most recently spent a year and four months in state prison on a 
burglary conviction, protested vehemently when Cupp told her she would have to 
take a urine test for drug use. 
</P>
<P>
Larson's parole does not prohibit her from drinking, but Cupp asked, "Does 
Daisy know you're hitting the sauce already?" She then advised the woman, "You 
might consider taking a few breath mints before you go to work." 
</P>
<P>
As she was leaving, Cupp said Larson probably wouldn't make it to work that 
day. She was right. 
</P>
<P>
Later that afternoon, Larson argued with her landlady, picked up her paycheck 
and moved out of her room. Although Cupp has not been able to locate Larson, 
the parole officer takes it in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a relationship with Sharon," Cupp said. "She will call me when she is 
down and out." And when she does, Cupp said, "I will take her right back to 
jail." 
</P>
<P>
Many parolees have no idea where they will live once they are released from 
prison, so they use the parole office as a forwarding address. After visiting 
Larson, Cupp had mail to deliver to William Bennett, a former physician who 
shot and wounded two people during a random shooting rampage. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, who served a six-year sentence for assault with a deadly weapon, has 
been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. Now living in a comfortable Van 
Nuys nursing home, his medication has slowed him physically and mentally. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett's mail includes a letter with bad news from the Veterans Administration 
Hospital in Sepulveda. It said security guards will call police if he returns 
to the hospital. In the future, the letter said, he can only seek treatment at 
the Brentwood VA Hospital, which is more than an hour away by bus. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett told Cupp that while he was at the Sepulveda hospital for urological 
treatment, he had jokingly asked a young night nurse to marry him. When she 
told him she was already married, Bennett said he replied, "If I kill your 
husband, will you marry me?" Bennett insisted that he had not meant the comment 
as a real threat. 
</P>
<P>
But Cupp chides him, "You can never tell a joke like that." 
</P>
<P>
Although Cupp believes that Bennett was trying to intimidate the young nurse, 
she is also outraged that the hospital would ban a mentally ill man in need of 
medical care. After leaving Bennett, she promised to seek reinstatement of his 
rights to medical treatment at the Sepulveda facility. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are on parole, you are still entitled to adequate medical treatment," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Cupp said she generally maintains an emotional distance from her parolees but 
admitted that she has become attached to some. 
</P>
<P>
Her last visit of the day took her to the Salvation Army Harbor Light Center in 
downtown Los Angeles to say goodby to Joseph Fay, an alcoholic and convicted 
burglar. Fay has been one of Cupp's favorites, although he periodically has 
gotten himself into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Twice in the last two years, an intoxicated Fay was hit by a car while crossing 
the street. Both times he called her to take him to the hospital. She said he 
was so apologetic that she found it easy to forgive him. 
</P>
<P>
Fay had been living on the streets in Van Nuys until Cupp enrolled him in the 
downtown alcohol treatment program. She said it was critical for him to get 
away from Van Nuys, because "all his drinking buddies are there." But as a 
parole officer assigned to the San Fernando Valley, she cannot continue to 
supervise him. 
</P>
<P>
Fay was visibly shaken when Cupp told him in the din and chaos of the Salvation 
Army common room that his case had been transferred to another parole officer. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any people in California," he said, his eyes avoiding hers. "It 
was nice to know I could always call somebody." 
</P>
<P>
She smiles brightly and pats his hand. "You can still call me -- you can even 
call collect." 
</P>
<P>
Driving back to the Van Nuys office, Cupp said that her goodbys are rarely that 
tough. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing you can say to a parolee is, 'I hope I never see you again,' 
because if you do see them, it means they are in trouble." 
</P>

PROTEIN HELPS TO AVOID TRANSFUSION 
</P>

<P>
A naturally occurring protein that stimulates blood production apparently can 
help many patients avoid transfusions with donated blood that might be tainted 
by diseases such as AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
A new study found that the protein, a hormone known as erythropoietin, boosted 
the amount of blood that surgery patients could store up for their own use, 
researchers reported in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The findings indicate that patients who know they are going to need blood 
during surgery but do not have time to store up enough of their own or are too 
anemic to do so could be injected with the substance to avoid donated blood, 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
In the new study, headed by Dr. Lawrence Goodnough, an associate professor of 
medicine at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, researchers asked 47 
patients scheduled for surgery at hospitals across the country to store up 
blood for three weeks. Half the group was given erythropoietin injections twice 
weekly. The other half received a useless substitute. 
</P>
<P>
The patients who received erythropoietin produced 5.4 units of blood, compared 
to only 4.1 from the other group. 
</P>
<P>
Also, blood from those who received the protein contained 41% more 
oxygen-carrying red blood cells, the researchers reported.

NEW VACCINE AGAINST WHOOPING COUGH TESTED

<P>
A promising candidate for a new, safer vaccine against whooping cough has been 
developed by a team of Italian, American and Japanese researchers, the 
scientists said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"All the animal studies have confirmed that the molecules we have identified 
are excellent vaccine candidates," said researcher Rino Rappuoli of the Sclavo 
Research Center in Siena, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Tests of the vaccine on human volunteers began recently and early results 
should be known in "a couple of months," Rappuoli said in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Whooping cough kills an estimated 1 million children annually around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Although a vaccine is widely available, many parents elect not to give it to 
their children because it can cause serious side effects, including brain 
damage and other nervous system complications. 
</P>
<P>
The three-component DPT vaccine guards against diphtheria and tetanus as well 
as whooping cough, whose scientific name is pertussis because it is caused by a 
type of bacteria known as Bordetella pertussis. 
</P>
<P>
Writing in last Friday's Science magazine, scientists from the Medical College 
of Wisconsin in Milwaukee and the National Institute of Health in Tokyo as well 
as the Sclavo center said they used genetic engineering techniques to produce a 
nontoxic version of the toxin, or chemical poison, produced by the B. pertussis 
bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
The unaltered toxin forms the basis of the current vaccine; it is first 
weakened by a chemical process, then injected, tricking the body into producing 
antibodies against the pertussis bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
Although the genetic engineering procedure produces nontoxic mutant toxin 
molecules, the researchers said animal studies indicate that these molecules 
retain their ability to trigger the immune response required to prevent 
whooping cough but without the harmful side effects of the current vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
In tests in mice, the experimental vaccine was able to protect the animal 
against a lethal dose of virulent whooping cough bacteria, they said. "So far, 
so good. Everything we anticipated is happening," Rappuoli said.

WINDS CAUSE SCATTERED POWER OUTAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Powerful Santa Ana winds Sunday knocked down small trees, tore off branches, 
activated burglar alarms and caused brief electrical outages for about 4,000 
residences in Chatsworth, Canoga Park and Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The northeasterly winds gusted to nearly 40 m.p.h. across the northern San 
Fernando Valley, causing the National Weather Service to issue a high-wind 
advisory. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Jensen, a Los Angeles Department of Water and Power spokeswoman, said 
scattered power outages were reported beginning about 4 a.m. and a varying 
number of customers were without power until shortly after 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
She said the outages are caused by the winds blowing wires together, making 
them short-circuit. Branches blown from trees also knocked wires down, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale police said the wind was activating burglar alarms, causing an 
unusually high number of false alarms to be reported.

STUDENT DRIVER LOSES CONTROL, KILLS HIS WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An early-morning driving lesson turned into a fatal accident Sunday when a 
motorist struck and killed his wife in a parking lot in Griffith Park, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved her and she loved me," Jesus Herrera, a car wash attendant, said of 
his wife, Imelda Calderon. "It was an accident." 
</P>
<P>
Herrera, 54, and Calderon, 49, were in the park with three of their eight 
children to teach Herrera how to drive, police said. Herrera was at the wheel 
of the 1977 Mercury Cougar with his 30-year-old son beside him. 
</P>
<P>
"I got nervous because the car started to build up speed, and I didn't know 
whether to speed up or stop," Herrera told police, explaining how he lost 
control of the car which struck a tree, then Calderon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just one of those things," said Sgt. Wayne Ridders. "I've seen people run 
over their children while backing out of a driveway. Accidents like this 
happen."

CHICAGO'S DENT IS BACK AND BOUNDING;

BEARS: WITH A FLYING TACKLE, A SACK AND A FUMBLE RECOVERY, DEFENSIVE LINEMAN 
HELPS CART OFF RAM OFFENSE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Desperate times demand desperate measures, which is why Chicago Bear Coach Mike 
Ditka celebrated his upcoming one-year anniversary of his heart attack by 
sending his blood pressure to new post-mellow heights. 
</P>
<P>
Ditka ranted. He raved. He relieved Bear offensive coordinator Greg Landry of 
his play-calling duties in mid-game. He jerked starting quarterback Mike 
Tomczak from the lineup and replaced him with Jim Harbaugh. No one was spared. 
</P>
<P>
"I yelled enough that I don't have any friends left," Ditka said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a much-criticized Bear secondary (ranked 25th against the pass), 
resorted to superstition and switched from white to black turf shoes. This is 
what happens when a team unfamiliar with losing finds itself in the middle of a 
three-game winless streak. 
</P>
<P>
"It was 'de-feet,' " safety Dave Duerson said. "It was just something for the 
secondary to rally around." 
</P>
<P>
Turns out that the Ditka tirade-athon was a waste of effort, nothing more than 
filler for the 11 o'clock news. As for the Bear defensive backs and their 
quaint notion of shoe changes -- please. 
</P>
<P>
This was a game decided Sunday morning when Bear defensive end Richard Dent 
walked, not limped, into the Soldier Field locker room. At last, his injured 
right leg, the victim of a freak collision with a runaway food cart, was 
healed. Dent was back and eager to introduce himself to various Ram linemen, 
quarterbacks and running backs. 
</P>
<P>
Hello, he said, to tailback Greg Bell, who was cut down by Dent's acrobatic 
flying tackle early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Howdy, he said, to Jim Everett after a sack and numerous other close calls. 
</P>
<P>
Hi, there, he said, to offensive tackle Irv Pankey, who didn't fare quite as 
well as the legendary food cart. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just glad to have Richard back," Duerson said. "He made some incredible 
plays out there. When Richard's on the field, you're going to have to designate 
two guys to block him." 
</P>
<P>
Said Ditka: "The addition of Richard Dent seemed to make a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
Seemed? Dent was in the Ram backfield more than Gaston Green Sunday. And 
Everett probably knows what brand of cologne Dent wears. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, Ditka still can't entirely believe he lost Dent for a game because 
a caterer's cart smacked into a tender thigh bruise. At one point, he 
questioned the severity of the injury, to say nothing of Dent's dedication. 
</P>
<P>
Now all is forgiven. Dent practiced this week and managed to dodge all moving 
metal objects. In return, Ditka placed the former Super Bowl MVP back in the 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"A food cart can't stop me this time," Dent said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither could the Rams, who tried a little bit of everything in their quest to 
slow down Dent. Few things worked, as Dent often roamed free. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we had to win this game more than anything," Dent said. "We had to 
play this game like it was the last game in our lives." 
</P>
<P>
Melodrama aside, Dent managed to inspire a Bear team in dire need of something 
other than Ditka's tired theatrics or the apparel changes of a battered 
secondary. 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely call it urgency," Duerson said. 
</P>
<P>
Not since 1984 against the Raiders, said Duerson, had the Bears faced this sort 
of critical regular-season game. Oddly enough, that was the same game that Dent 
set a career high in solo tackles. 
</P>
<P>
He was at it again Sunday, most noticeably with his tackle of Bell, whose back 
appeared to be bent at a right angle. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't get a good view, but I heard it," Bear safety Markus Paul said. "I 
heard the clack." 
</P>
<P>
Or as Bear defensive tackle Steve McMichael explained: "Having Richard Dent 
back . . . geezus!" 
</P>
<P>
All Dent did was hurdle over the low block of Ram fullback Buford McGee and 
then knock the bejabbers out of Bell, who took the handoff but a moment 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"He just surprised me with it, that's all," Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
Well, not exactly. The tackle electrified a heretofore Anaheim Stadium-like 
crowd, as well as the sluggish Bears. 
</P>
<P>
"(McGee) came and cut me before, and he was laughing and talking about it, 
saying he timed me right," Dent said. "Next time I knew that I had an 
opportunity to make a good play. I was really hoping that the ball would come 
out more than anything." 
</P>
<P>
On the next Ram series, Dent got his wish. William Perry pried the ball from 
Bell and Dent fell on it. The turnover resulted in a Bear touchdown six plays 
later. 
</P>
<P>
Dent even managed to get into a brief wrestling match with a frustrated 
Everett. Nothing happened, except that Everett pointed at Dent and Dent pointed 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him that wasn't necessary," Dent said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Dent's contract expires at the end of this season, which makes him eligible for 
the National Football League's version of free agency. Don't think he hasn't 
thought of the financial possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't follow anybody, I try to lead," he said. "I've been a leader since I 
left home to go to college. 
</P>
<P>
"I like doing things that people aren't used to seeing a big guy do." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams saw. They wish they hadn't.

BO'S HIT-AND-RUN ROUTINE HAS THE REDSKINS GRASPING FOR AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tailback Bo Jackson of the Raiders took a pitch from quarterback Steve 
Beuerlein and sprinted around left end. Linebacker Greg Manusky wrapped his 
arms around Jackson, but Jackson eluded him and cut back across the field. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo made a nice cut," Manusky said. "I got an arm on him and I tried to wrap it 
around him and he broke through." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson also broke another tackle on the way to a 73-yard touchdown run in the 
Raiders' 37-24 win over the Washington Redskins Sunday at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Strong safety Alvin Walton hit Jackson on the hip, but Jackson bounced off and 
ran for the end zone. Bo ran 10 yards out of the end zone and flipped the ball 
over his shoulder in celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing better than a run like that," Jackson said. "I felt (Manusky) 
right on my heels and at the last minute I cut back across the field and I knew 
that he wasn't going to catch me. If I would have run straight like I ran the 
last leg I knew he would have caught me." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Steve Beuerlein, who watched the play unfold, marveled at Jackson's 
ability to escape the Redskin defenders. 
</P>
<P>
"Once Bo gets a head of steam going these guys don't seem to realize that you 
can't hit him high and expect him to go down," Beuerlein said. "The only way 
you can get him down is to go at his legs. If you don't get his legs I don't 
think there's anyone that has the speed to catch him." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody caught Jackson Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
After rushing for a total of 164 yards in his first two games, Jackson made his 
first start and gained 144 yards in 19 carries against Washington. It was the 
second time in his three-year National Football League career that he has 
rushed for more than 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo Jackson was no surprise," Washington Coach Joe Gibbs said. "He broke that 
run at the beginning of the third quarter and that was really a big play." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson seemed to get stronger as the game wore on, rushing for 118 yards in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"You could say that I get more fired up as the game goes on," Jackson said. 
"The whole team is like a locomotive. We start off slow and just pick up speed 
and momentum and everything just goes with it." 
</P>
<P>
With the crowd chanting, "Bo, Bo, Bo," Jackson had a 45-yard touchdown run 
nullified by a holding penalty in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Was Jackson disappointed that the touchdown run was nullfied? 
</P>
<P>
"Nope," Jackson said. "If it was a play deciding the outcome of the game I 
probably would have been disappointed. But we had a comfortable lead. It was 
just one of those things that happen." 
</P>
<P>
Like any smart running back, Jackson praised his offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
"The offensive line blocked their . . . off today and I hope they do it again 
next week," Jackson said. "If they give me holes like I got this afternoon you 
can bet the farm that I'm going to do everything I can to score." 
</P>
<P>
Raider guard Steve Wisniewski doesn't think Jackson needs many blocks to break 
a long run. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of pointless to chase after him because I know I'm not going to make 
any type of block for him," Wisniewski said. "You make a block and you just 
stop and look at him. That run was sweet. I just had my mouth open just 
watching him run down the field." 
</P>
<P>
After joining the Raiders three weeks ago, Jackson has rushed for 308 yards in 
three games, an average of 102.6 yards per game, and is on a pace that would 
give him his first 1,000-yard season as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
Although NFL defensive coordinators have designed defenses to stop Jackson, Bo 
knows how to break the big play. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody's capable of breaking a big play," Jackson said. "When a team is 
keying on our running game it opens up the passing game and when they key on 
the running game it opens up the passing game." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders have flourished since Jackson joined the team. After starting the 
season with a 2-3 record, the Raiders are 2-1 since Jackson reported. The 
Raiders, who averaged 121.8 yards rushing in their first five games, are 
averaging 157.3 yards on the ground since Jackson joined the team. 
</P>
<P>
Has he made the difference? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just one of the 11 guys out there playing," Jackson said. "If the team 
plays better when I'm out there, that's great. But I don't think that's the 
case. We want to get back to the old Raiders and let all of this talk die that 
the Raiders are getting soft."

Mother Nature conspired against this struggling marathon Sunday, serving up 
balmy, windy weather and wilting both the men's and women's fields. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures during the Old Style/Chicago marathon hovered in the mid-60s, with 
53% humidity. The heat sapped the strength of most runners, giving the patient 
and steady runners a distinct advantage. Among the men, Paul Davies-Hale of 
England proved the most patient, winning in a rather pedestrian 2 hours 11 
minutes 25 seconds, in his first marathon ever. 
</P>
<P>
It was the slowest winning time in this race since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Among the women, Lisa Weidenbach of Issaquah, Wash., repeated as champion, with 
a personal best of 2:28:15, impressive under the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second-hottest race in Chicago history, only 1978 was worse. By 
comparison, last year's race was 30 degrees cooler at the start. Most distance 
runners prefer temperatures in the 40s, with cloud cover. 
</P>
<P>
The race conditions were simply more bad luck for the 12th running of Chicago's 
marathon, which has been fighting for respectability since losing its sponsor 
in 1986 and staging no race in 1987. After a week of summer-like weather, race 
organizers hoped to be salvaged by a good race; to have, if not impressive 
times on this flat and fast course, at least a memorable race. 
</P>
<P>
That developed, at points, Sunday, as about 8,000 runners started at Daley 
Plaza downtown and wended their way through city streets. A pack of five men 
took off fast, maintaining a 2:09 pace at nine miles. 
</P>
<P>
Those early leaders: El-Mostafa Nechchadi of Morocco, Don Janicki of Colorado, 
Gerardo Alcala of Mexico, Carlos Montero of Spain and Gabriel Kamau of Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
They did the early work against the wind, while a second pack hovered 20 
seconds behind. The lead pack went through the half-marathon at 1:04:50, a pace 
that would wither in the second half. No one who was in the lead pack at the 
halfway point, with the exception of Montero, finished in the top five. 
</P>
<P>
Davies-Hale had been among those who had cagily stayed back, going with a more 
conservative approach. "I was concentrating on running five-minute miles," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He accomplished that, almost exactly. His time works out to 5:00.8 mile splits. 
</P>
<P>
Davies-Hale caught the second pack at 13 miles and met up with pre-race 
favorite Steve Binns, who lives 30 miles from Davies-Hale in England's West 
Midlands. The two quickly went in different directions -- Binns falling back 
(he eventually dropped out) and Davies-Hale moving up. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked Binnsie who was in the first group, he told me, and I went," 
Davies-Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
At 22 miles, Davies-Hale was in the lead and in control, running smoothly and 
not appearing to labor under the bright sun. Following him, and likewise 
picking off the fading runners in the first pack, were Ravil Kashapov of the 
Soviet Union, who was second in 2:13:19, and David Long, also from the British 
Midlands, who was third in 2:13:37. Ed Eyestone was the first U.S. finisher in 
fourth, 2:14:57. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's race, Weidenbach had not been the favorite and she agreed with 
that handicapping. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest with you, I was afraid of Cathy (O'Brien)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
With reason. O'Brien, a 22-year-old from Boston, has been on the verge of a 
breakthrough for a long time. She took off in Sunday's race with authority and 
ran with a 20-30-second cushion for 15 miles. Then, the heat from the sun and 
the perceptible heat of Weidenbach constantly gaining did her in. 
</P>
<P>
At 18 miles, Weidenbach came up on O'Brien, her New Balance teammate. They 
shared some water, then Weidenbach tossed aside the water bottle and put on a 
surge that left O'Brien flat. 
</P>
<P>
It was the same spot, the corner of Wells and North Avenue, that Weidenbach had 
taken the lead in last year's race. It was also where dozens of her family 
members and friends were posted. 
</P>
<P>
Carla Beurskens of the Netherlands, at 37 still an amazing runner, eventually 
passed the struggling O'Brien and placed second 2:30:24. O'Brien was third in 
2:31:19. 
</P>
<P>
Given the heat, the humidity and the wind, Weidenbach's time might have been as 
much as two minutes faster. Even the 2:28 is respectable -- only five U.S. 
women have run under 2:30. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess when you are having a good day, nothing is going to get you down," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Davies-Hale, a former plumber from Rugeley, Straffordshire, seemed bemused by 
the attention and nonplussed that he had just won $50,000 in prize money. About 
as far as he seemed willing to go, on the celebrity scale, was to say he had 
pitched the plumbing job. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll still do the odd washing machine . . . good rates," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Davies-Hale, 27, came to the United States in 1985 and settled in Boulder, 
Colo., the nation's unofficial running center. Davies-Hale may have shown a 
liking for running in heat when he won the Boulder Bolder that year in terrific 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
He was a 1984 Olympian in the steeplechase and, on the advice of others, moved 
up to 5,000 and 10,000 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Davies-Hale is unsure what his future in the marathon is. Like his 
fellow countrymen, he's low-key and practical and not interested in 
speculating. 
</P>
<P>
"I've already had a great track season," Davies-Hale said. "I may run another 
marathon next year . . . but I really want to get back on the track." 
</P>
<P>
Marathon Notes 
</P>
<P>
Race organizers insist that this race is at a world-class level, especially 
pointing to the world's richest purse. That may be so, but all major marathons 
have drug testing and Chicago has none. Race director Tim Murphy said the race 
was not selected by The Athletics Congress, which governs the sport, to conduct 
testing. . . . Men's and women's winners won $50,000, second place won $30,000 
and third place $20,000. . . . Scot Hellebuyck won the men's wheelchair race in 
1:45:30. Ann Cody Morris won the women's wheelchair race in 1:58:51.

SEVEN RIVERS HOLDS UP HIS END OF STABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In November of 1988, the Charlie Whittingham stable had high hopes for a pair 
of promising 2-year-old colts, one a near black son of Halo named Sunday 
Silence, the other a salt-and-pepper gray named Seven Rivers. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence went on to win the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes last 
spring and and probably will earn a horse of the year title if he wins the 
Breeders' Cup Classic on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Seven Rivers, on the other hand, dropped out of sight 11 months ago and did not 
resurface until the Del Mar meeting in August. Since then, the son of Irish 
River has been doing his best to catch up with his famous stablemate. 
</P>
<P>
After winning three of four races along the comeback trail, Seven Rivers ran 
the best race of his interrupted career Sunday at Santa Anita to take the 
$111,100 Volante Handicap. In the process, he upstaged his heavily favored 
stablemate, River Master, who beat only one horse. 
</P>
<P>
Seven Rivers reached the end of the nine furlongs on the grass three-quarters 
of a length in front of Bruho, and Jack Kent Cooke's Raise a Stanza finished 
another neck back in third. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie Davis and Seven Rivers circled five horses at the head of the stretch on 
their winning move. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't have much choice," Davis said. "Around the turn I saw it 
coming. None of those horses inside me were backing up, so I just saved as much 
ground as I could before swinging wide." 
</P>
<P>
At the head of the stretch, Bruho, under Gary Stevens, appeared to have the 
pacesetting Immortal Script measured. Raise a Stanza, on the outside, and Art 
Work, down on the rail, also were in the thick of contention. Then Davis 
unleashed his gray colt. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Delahoussaye felt helpless aboard 11-10 favorite River Master, whose only 
defeat in four starts on grass had come against the turf star Hawkster in the 
Del Mar Derby. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand he hurt in his last race, and it must still be bothering him, 
because something was hurting him," Delahoussaye said. 
</P>
<P>
Seven Rivers was clocked in 1:45 4/5 and returned $16.40, $8 and $5. Bruho paid 
$5.40 and $4.20, and Raise a Stanza returned $5 to show. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar Futurity winner Drag Race will try to erase the memory of his flop in 
the recent Norfolk Stakes when he takes on six other California sales products 
in the Desert Wine Stakes at 7 furlongs this Wednesday. . . . Laffit Pincay had 
a day to forget. He had mounts go lame, finish last and flip in the starting 
gate. Tokatee, his mount in the Volante, was scratched.

ARCHITECTURE: FRANK GEHRY: THE EVOLUTION OF A MASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON, Whiteson writes about architecture and design for the View 
section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone noticing a modern house being built in Bel-Air back in 1959 was 
witnessing the modest debut of Southern California's now most famous architect, 
Frank O. Gehry. 
</P>
<P>
Perched on the edge of a bluff overlooking the Sepulveda Pass, the Steeves 
family home was the first major independent commission in which Gehry was free 
to strut his stuff. But that early stuff bears little resemblance to the 
eccentric style that has carried the architect to the heights of acclaim. In 
the 20 years between the Steeves house and the radical home Gehry designed for 
himself in Santa Monica in 1978, a revolution has occurred in Gehry's mind -- a 
revolution that has shaken the ideas of designers and laymen alike. 
</P>
<P>
A comparison of the Steeves and Gehry houses, which seem to have come from 
totally different designers, illuminates the extraordinary journey the 
architect has made on the road to fame. 
</P>
<P>
The Steeves house is crisp, clear and free of any hint of quirks. Its spaces, 
indoors and out, are airy and uncomplicated. The details of the sliding doors, 
wooden fascias and stucco panels are clean, well-finished and unfussy. 
</P>
<P>
The house embodies what Gehry described as "my (early) preoccupation with 
hierarchical spaces and formal planning organization." 
</P>
<P>
Translated from "archibabble," this means that the architect wanted to achieve 
a logical plan for the house, then to express this logic in a straightforward 
manner. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years later, Gehry stood his early design logic on its head. 
</P>
<P>
The simple pleasures of clarity were supplanted by the subtler delights of 
ambiguity. Comprehension was replaced by provocation. Gehry found his form. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, Gehry enclosed a pink suburban house in a skewed shell of 
corrugated metal, glass and exposed timber framing. Nets of Gehry's trademark 
chain-link fencing and a tilted skylight over the kitchen add to the ambiguity 
of the design. All the lines between old and new, horizontal and vertical, roof 
and wall are blurred into oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
Internally, the Gehry house is a deliberately schizoid fusion of the ordinary 
and the incongruous. The spacious sunny kitchen is floored with black asphalt, 
like pavement. The original living room windows now overlook the kitchen. It's 
like a live-in hall of mirrors where the reflections are alternately expected 
and extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
When it was unveiled in 1978, the Gehry house was greeted by a mixed cocktail 
of cheers and jeers. "It's a dirty thing to do in somebody else's front yard," 
one neighbor complained. Others dubbed the design "a monstrosity" and an 
"eyesore," but the mayor of Santa Monica, summoned to inspect the house by a 
distressed resident, declared: "It's a masterpiece. I love it." 
</P>
<P>
Professional critics were no less divided. While one lauded its "sophisticated 
beauty," another characterized it as "a lumberyard vandalized by a rampaging 
teen-ager." 
</P>
<P>
Gehry, typically, expressed his evolution from conventional modernist to 
radical Pop-Modernist in down-home terms. "In the Steeves house, I was still 
trying for the perfect detail. Since perfection was impossible, I gave it up 
and started doing this rough stuff." 
</P>
<P>
More seriously, Gehry said: "What people often don't see is that I don't 
destroy order, I reinvent it. I break down the obvious, churn it about, hold it 
upside down, shake it and bake it and fry its assumptions. In this way I free a 
fresh order of forms out of the ashes of the old." 
</P>
<P>
Gehry says his urge to reinvent order was born in the back room of his 
grandfather's hardware store in downtown Toronto. There he tinkered with 
dismembered clocks and toasters, and the pathos of dismantled gears, springs 
and wires infected him with a tenderness for mechanisms that spill their guts 
for all the world to see. 
</P>
<P>
Gehry's sister, Doreen Nelson, suggested shrewdly that "when Frank bought that 
pink house, he did a transformation not only on the house but on himself. He 
put all this stuff around it to present himself as a new person, but an old new 
person who's still connected to where he came from and who he was." 
</P>
<P>
A New Life 
</P>
<P>
The old-new unconventional Gehry was transformed through a series of 
professional and personal changes that occurred in the late 1960s. On a 
personal level, his first marriage broke up in 1966, and 10 years later, he 
started a new life with Berta Aguilera, with whom he now has two sons. 
</P>
<P>
Another major personal influence was the noted psychologist Milton Wexler, 
whose long analysis helped the architect through his life change. 
</P>
<P>
"I first went to Milton because my world wasn't functioning very well," Gehry 
told architectural historian Thomas Hines in 1986. "He was the first shrink to 
engage me intellectually." 
</P>
<P>
Through Wexler, Gehry met many artists, including Ed Ruscha, Ed Moses, Jasper 
Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Richard Serra, Andy Warhol and Claes Oldenburg. 
Hines wrote that "their way of making art strongly affected (Gehry's) way of 
making architecture. . . . Slowly he learned to sublimate the anger, pain and 
fear of existing in a crazy, hostile world to architectural statements about 
those tensions. His work would frequently suggest 'unfinished business' or the 
poignant incompleteness of all human existence." 
</P>
<P>
Gehry's design for painter Ron Davis' Malibu house, completed in 1972, was his 
first powerful move towards a personal style. A deliberately skewed trapezoid 
clad in corrugated iron, the Davis house opened the Pandora's box of Gehry's 
imagination in search of a freer form of expression. 
</P>
<P>
"That building unlocked a whole lot of possibilities," he recalled. "I spent a 
lot of time out there, sitting and looking, watching where the shadows and the 
sunlight fell. I began to play with those reflections, exploring their visual 
and emotional potentials." 
</P>
<P>
Over the next 17 years, Gehry explored the visual and emotional potentials of 
his highly individual eye in such landmark designs as the Loyola Law School 
campus, the Exposition Park Aerospace Museum and the Santa Monica Edgemar 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
In these quirky projects, he refined his feeling that architecture in a time of 
rapid change will always have something of the look of "unfinished business." 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the Steeves house provides an ironic postscript to Gehry's 
self-reinvention. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, the house's new owners, Robert and Joanne Smith, asked Gehry to add a 
new wing. 
</P>
<P>
Gehry's addition, designed in his radical post-transformation manner as a 
cluster of mini-pavilions clad in sheet metal, raw plywood and chain link, was 
rejected by his clients and by the Bel-Air Fine Arts Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a house," the commission declared. "It's too broken up." 
</P>
<P>
The Smiths, who accuse Gehry of developing a "totally unsuitable and wildly 
expensive scheme," refused to allow the house to be photographed with the 
addition subsequently designed by architects Frank Mutlow and John Dimster in a 
style similar to Gehry's original. 
</P>
<P>
Eight years later, the Smiths are still so angry with Gehry that, after 
expressing these opinions on the telephone, they canceled a scheduled interview 
with the flat statement that they "wanted nothing more to do with the man and 
his works." 
</P>
<P>
Gehry lays the blame for this sad outcome at the feet of Joanne Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"Her fancy tennis club, interior decorator pals told her my design would make 
her look silly," he said. "I guess back then conventional taste still had a 
ways to catch up with me."

FOOTNOTES: NEW LOOK FOR NEW CREEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Creem magazine, the counter-culture rock 'n' roll tabloid, is going upscale 
next year with an LA Style look. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Jarrett and Shea Ralph, owners of Alternative Media Inc., bought the 
trademark logo (remember "Boy Howdy!"?) and plan to launch the new magazine, 
with editorial offices based in Los Angeles, next June. 
</P>
<P>
"It was always a very cutting-edge magazine," Jarrett says, "and the new Creem 
will be cutting edge but in a different sort of way." Jarrett, who was Creem's 
advertising manager, will be publisher and executive editor. 
</P>
<P>
The new Creem will be aimed at the 21 to 45 age group and graphically similar 
to LA Style, including an oversize format. 
</P>
<P>
Jarrett doesn't see much competition to Rolling Stone magazine. "Rolling Stone 
has gotten to be more of a popular culture magazine than strictly music," he 
says. Creem will devote itself to music. 
</P>
<P>
While the Boy Howdy! logo will be incorporated into the new format, Jarrett 
says the new Creem will drop old Creem's other descriptive: "America's Only 
Rock 'n' Roll Magazine." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drink Scotch, See Angels 
</P>
<P>
Angelenos familiar with angel's hair, the micro-pasta, can now sample Angel's 
Share, a very limited edition of 25 bottles of "divine" single-malt, 
single-cask 1966 Scotch whiskey packaged in an etched Baccarat crystal decanter 
and priced at -- well, if you have to ask you probably can't afford it. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, however, Jurgensen's has bought 10 bottles, which it plans to 
retail at $8,650 each. 
</P>
<P>
The fanciful name derives from the distiller's term for whiskey that evaporates 
during aging. The angelic theme, etched into the crystal by artists David Sugar 
and Carol Iselin of New York's Innerlight Crystal, depicts an angel rising 
through whiskey vapors with what one viewer, chef-owner Barry Wine of 
Manhattan's Quilted Giraffe, described as "an indescribably ephemeral quality." 
Wine added that "the images seem to move and shimmer as you view them from 
different perspectives." 
</P>
<P>
That illusion probably grows as the costly bottle empties -- the Inchmurrin 
Highland whiskey being bottled at unwatered cask strength of 63.4% alcohol or 
126.8 proof.

Will Logo Lure Tourists? 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau, as previously reported, had 
changed its name from the Greater Los Angeles Visitors &amp; Convention Bureau 
but was forced to operate without new stationery and business cards because a 
new logo was still being designed. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the wait is over. The new logo, created by 30Sixty Advertising &amp; 
Design in Los Angeles, has an overlapping L and A layered with stylized 
representations of sun, mountains and water. 
</P>
<P>
"We think this new design says a lot about our marketing approach to Los 
Angeles," said John F. Llewellyn, the bureau's chairman and president of Forest 
Lawn Memorial-Parks &amp; Mortuaries. "It reflects a diversity that you won't 
find in other cities, and we believe it will convey the message that L.A. is a 
unique travel destination."

CONSULATE JOB PRACTICES CAN BE A NIGHTMARE FOR U.S. WORKERS; 
</P>
<P>
WORKPLACE: SHIELDED FROM MOST AMERICAN LABOR LAWS, SOME CONSULATES ARE ACCUSED 
OF TOLERATING DISCRIMINATION AND REFUSING TO PAY OVERTIME. 
</P>

<P>
Most employers could count on trouble from the authorities if they refused to 
pay time-and-a-half for overtime, failed to withhold Social Security taxes from 
paychecks and stood accused of tolerating racist and sexist conduct around the 
office. 
</P>
<P>
But American officialdom has done nothing to bother the Japanese Consulate in 
Los Angeles -- where, employees say, just such practices have been in evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Shielded from most U.S. labor laws by international agreements and longstanding 
practice, the consulate for years has had a rocky relationship with some of its 
American employees. 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, the Americans threatened to strike. Last year, most signed, but 
chose not to press, a petition for better wages and benefits, extra pay for 
overtime and a voice in how the consulate was run. Some talked of getting 
together with workers at other Japanese missions in the United States to form a 
union. Every year, a few Americans quit. 
</P>
<P>
This spring, the employees bitterly complained to a Japanese inspection team 
about their salaries -- the first such grumbling from so-called local staff 
members that Japanese Foreign Ministry officials could recall. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with recent wage adjustments and some administrators making an effort to 
smooth relations with the Americans, the turmoil has subsided. But the 
employees have gotten vivid instruction in a little-understood fact: The 1,700 
Americans who work in this country for foreign missions have fewer rights and 
protections than the rest of the work force. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really an international disgrace," said one Southern Californian who quit 
a job at the Japanese Consulate last year after he was asked to work 200 hours 
of overtime in a two-month period for what he said was 75% of his regular wage. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say that consulates and other foreign missions operate in a legal 
no-man's land, with employment practices that are a pastiche of the foreign and 
the domestic. 
</P>
<P>
At the Japanese Consulate, for instance, employees get days off for U.S. and 
Japanese holidays. While some workers say the pay is less than at other 
consulates or in private industry, they receive, in Japanese fashion, a 
year-end bonus equal to a month's salary. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, they are paid their regular hourly wage for overtime work. That's 
because foreign missions are exempt from the wage and hour laws that require 
American employers to pay time-and-a-half. Still, it is more than many workers 
get in Japan, where long hours are the rule and most overtime is considered 
"voluntary" and therefore unpaid. 
</P>
<P>
Also, since foreign governments can't be required to act as agents for U.S. 
authorities, the Japanese Consulate withholds no state or federal income tax or 
Social Security tax from its employees' pay. Employees are expected to pay the 
levies themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Employment practices at other local consulates are similarly hodgepodge. 
</P>
<P>
At the South African Consulate, local staffers -- most of whom are British, 
Irish or Filipino, rather than South African or American -- all pay South 
African income taxes, according to Liz Aliado, an administrative assistant. 
They are not paid for overtime but can take extra vacation time later. 
</P>
<P>
An American worker at the French Consulate, asked to compare Americans' pay and 
benefits with those of officials sent from France, replied: "Oh my gosh, they 
don't!" After checking with the French Embassy in Washington, the American said 
the consulate's position was that its employment practices were "confidential." 
</P>
<P>
Extraordinary work rules don't necessarily translate into disgruntled 
employees, however. 
</P>
<P>
Many employees of the Japanese Consulate say they like their work and get along 
well with the top Japanese officials who are assigned to the mission for two- 
or three-year stints. Tensions were eased in July by pay raises that averaged 
6.9% and a one-time payment that corrected a shortfall in overtime pay during a 
12-month period. And even some of those angered by the consulate's employment 
practices stay on the job because they enjoy the chance to use their language 
skills or are reluctant to face the uncertainties of a job hunt. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, officials at the consulate, which coordinates Japanese trade and 
cultural relations in Southern California and serves travelers between the 
United States and Japan, say they are trying to listen better to their 25-odd 
American employees, who work as analysts, clerks, drivers and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
"Although we may not be able to accomplish or accommodate some things, we have 
to look at what are the aspirations and desires and frustrations and so on" of 
the American workers, said Gunkatsu Kano, who in June assumed the No. 2 post of 
deputy consul general. "And, as much as possible, we will consult with Tokyo in 
improving the standards and the levels of benefits." 
</P>
<P>
But Kano acknowledged that Japanese officials come to Los Angeles with no 
training in American labor relations and, often, with little awareness of 
American sensibilities -- shortcomings that the employees say can be glaring. 
</P>
<P>
"They're playing it by ear," said Michael Jamentz, a former cultural affairs 
analyst at the Los Angeles consulate who is now studying at Harvard University. 
"Whether things are settled to the satisfaction of local employees depends on 
whether the person running the office is sympathetic to them." 
</P>
<P>
Jamentz has mostly positive memories of his seven years at the consulate. But 
as many who have studied U.S.-Japanese business relations have noted, the two 
societies' notions about work are differ greatly. Jamentz said some American 
employees have adapted to Japanese ways better than others. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some American workers say that "sympathy" often is in short supply and 
explanations for Japanese conduct are lacking. 
</P>
<P>
"They keep everything hush-hush," said Alvaro A. Maldonado, an Alhambra man who 
has been a driver at the consulate more than three years. "If you don't ask, 
they don't tell," he said. "And the rule of thumb is: Never ask." 
</P>
<P>
The unusual legal status of consular employees further muddies relations. One 
former employee of the Japanese Consulate, for instance, said Japanese 
officials told her that when she entered the mission, which occupies three 
stories of a Little Tokyo office tower, she was on Japanese soil. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, that notion -- known as "extraterritorialty" -- has been discredited 
for decades. State Department lawyers say it ceased to play any part in 
international relations when several treaties were signed in the 1960s and with 
passage of a federal law in 1976 that limited the legal immunities extended to 
foreign missions and their staffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese claim, though, planted a powerful impression in the woman's mind. 
To her, it means that employees of the consulate "have no rights." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, too, confusion reigns. 
</P>
<P>
Take the question of discriminatory practices at work. Since 1985, the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission has claimed authority to investigate charges 
of race, sex and age discrimination made against foreign missions. Yet in 
California, attorneys for the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, to 
which the EEOC refers most bias cases, say they believe that foreign missions 
are exempt from bias laws. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the uncertainty, some current and past employees of the Japanese Consulate 
said they assumed they had nowhere to turn when their bosses engaged in what 
they viewed as discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, Maldonado recalled smoldering as he chauffeured a consular 
official and a visitor from Tokyo while they chatted about Los Angeles' racial 
makeup. According to Maldonado, the consular officer said: "There's too many 
blacks and too many Hispanics, and you can't go anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
One American who since has quit his job at the consulate said he was ordered in 
June, 1988, to make sure that neither a black nor a woman was chosen to address 
a group of Americans who were leaving to teach English in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Consul General Hiromoto Seki bridles at the suggestion that the consulate 
tolerates racism. He said Maldonado (who has a bachelor's degree in Japanese 
from Cal State Los Angeles) is a lackadaisical worker who does not understand 
enough Japanese to know what his passengers are saying. Women speak frequently 
at consulate gatherings, Seki added, although he could not recall a talk being 
given by a black during his 21-month tenure. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, he said: "One word here or there does not represent the policies 
or characteristics of our consulate." 
</P>
<P>
The policy, according to Seki, is to promote close ties with American 
minorities, an area in which he describes himself as a "pioneer." 
</P>
<P>
Seki said he encouraged the Japan Business Assn. to establish regional 
committees to address minority concerns in Southern California. He also 
persuaded Japanese manufacturers to donate $200,000 worth of musical 
instruments to the Music Center of Los Angeles County's lending program for 
disadvantaged students. And at his suggestion, he said, the Japanese government 
has underwritten visits to Japan for California leaders of minority 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials, nonetheless, are being urged to be more sensitive to 
matters of race, said Kano, the deputy consul. With little exposure to ethnic 
diversity at home, he said, Japanese people sometimes bring with them attitudes 
that Americans find offensive. 
</P>
<P>
"The cause may be basically ignorance, and therefore non-sensitivity," he said. 
"When one is ignorant of a situation, they tend to subscribe to any easy 
stereotype or bias." 
</P>
<P>
Americans who have worked for the consulate say that uncertainty over their 
legal rights and the fear of provoking consular officials have left them 
feeling powerless to improve their working conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no way to redress our situation," Maldonado said. The employees 
abandoned the one path they considered: forwarding a petition to Seki. After 16 
of the 26 local staff members signed a petition last year, all but a few got 
cold feet and decided against submitting it. 
</P>
<P>
For most employees of foreign missions, it seems, the marketplace provides 
enough protection that tougher oversight by the U.S. government is unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, foreign missions must offer competitive wages and benefits to 
attract capable employees, said Paula Todd, a principal in Washington with 
Towers Perrin, a benefits consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to work for them," Todd said. "I suspect they would be unable 
to attract and maintain people if their practices were too far out of line." 
</P>
<P>
In Little Tokyo, meantime, Seki and Kano are taking steps to clear up confusion 
about the consulate's employment practices. For the past year, new employees 
have received handbooks detailing the consulate's policies. Officials try now 
to make clear the rules regarding taxes and pensions. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese and their U.S. employees still have a way to go in understanding 
each other, though. 
</P>
<P>
To Kano, the American drivers' complaints about scheduling, for instance, can 
sound like so much dawdling. "It's, 'I've been to the airport driving a 
visitor, so I don't want to go a second time,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
To Maldonado, the Japanese consuls' demands can seem like slave-driving. Told 
to work 12 hours of overtime on a recent Saturday -- including three trips to 
Los Angeles International Airport -- Maldonado told his boss, "This is 
absolutely unreasonable," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
His boss' response? "He doesn't see it as unreasonable."

SHAPING CHINA'S ECONOMY; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERPRISES: SINCE THE CRACKDOWN ON WESTERN-STYLE REFORMS, CHINA'S LEADERS HAVE 
BEEN SEEKING A BALANCE BETWEEN MARKET FORCES AND STATE CONTROL.

SHANGHAI, China 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zhang Xiandi, head of a rural synthetic thread factory near Shanghai, talks 
like a hard-driving capitalist entrepreneur. 
</P>
<P>
"Some factories from neighboring provinces were selling this kind of thread in 
the Shanghai area, but after we started production, we ran them out of here," 
Zhang said in a recent interview, a triumphant grin flashing across her face. 
"The quality of our product was better, and we provide good service to 
customers." 
</P>
<P>
Aggressive "village and township enterprises" like Zhang's have boomed in China 
during the past decade. Often called "collectives," these market-sensitive 
firms usually belong to local governments but function like private companies, 
buying and selling on open markets. Profits go to bonuses, expansion and local 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, China's private and collective businesses, a total of about 28 
million enterprises employing 110 million people, are facing hard times. They 
lost their strongest backer when former General Secretary Zhao Ziyang was 
ousted from power early this summer for refusing to support a military 
crackdown on pro-democracy student demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
Zhao, who also favored experimenting with the sale of stock in large state 
corporations, always insisted that he was merely trying to improve socialism. 
But many observers felt that his ultimate goal was a Western-style market 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of Zhao's ouster, hard-line leaders in Beijing are showing renewed 
favoritism to large state-owned firms, even though many of those companies have 
records of poor management and inefficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Within the Communist Party, a complex struggle is under way over the shape of 
China's economy. Debate hinges on the proper balance between market forces and 
state control. The issue is expected to be a major focus of a pending meeting 
of the 175-member Communist Party Central Committee. The outcome may affect the 
pace of China's modernization and ultimately its prospects for social and 
political liberalization. 
</P>
<P>
Since the June 4 martial-law crackdown in Beijing, Premier Li Peng and Vice 
Premier Yao Yilin, backed by elderly hard-liners, have led an accelerating 
effort to reassert a wide range of central controls. 
</P>
<P>
Development of a true market economy has been explicitly rejected for as long 
as current leaders remain in power, and experiments with the issuance of new 
stocks have been put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
"If we persist in weakening and totally negate the planned economy, and try to 
create a completely market-oriented economy, it wouldn't work in China and 
would surely throw the economy and the entire society into confusion," 
Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin declared in late September in his 
first major policy address. 
</P>
<P>
China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, has stated that reforms must continue 
-- but within the context of continued primacy for the system of public 
ownership. 
</P>
<P>
These positions are the new orthodoxy, publicly supported by all of China's 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath the surface, there continues to be a severe clash of opinions. 
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese intellectuals and foreign analysts believe that the real goals of 
Li and Yao extend all the way to a rollback of reforms and re-establishment of 
a Stalinist-style command economy such as China had during the 1950s. Standing 
in the way of any such retreat are many officials committed to market-oriented 
reforms who remain entrenched in powerful positions both in Beijing and the 
provinces. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Deng himself, this reform faction includes leaders such as Vice 
Premier Tian Jiyun, National People's Congress Chairman Wan Li and Guangdong 
Governor Ye Xuanping. General Secretary Jiang and Politburo Standing Committee 
member Li Ruihuan, the two politicians who won the most important promotions in 
the wake of the June crackdown, also have long records of favoring moderate 
economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
Many changes of the past decade -- growing contacts with the outside world, 
investment by foreign businesses, freer thinking by Chinese intellectuals and 
the growth of collective and private enterprises -- are also powerful factors 
promoting a more open economy and society. 
</P>
<P>
"What I know is that everything is still in a process of change," Shao Jingwu, 
director of the Shanghai Diesel Engine Works, commented when asked about 
prospects for further reforms. "What things ultimately will change to be like 
is very difficult to say." 
</P>
<P>
Shao said he believes that return to a 1950s-style system is out of the 
question, but that "currently, we cannot foresee development of a complete 
market economy where the only restriction on our prices would be whether 
customers are willing to buy our products." 
</P>
<P>
Beijing is trying to direct a greater share of funds and raw materials to large 
state-owned firms such as Shao's company, which employs 11,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, new restrictions are being imposed on collective and private 
businesses, including rural enterprises. Such businesses stand accused of 
draining financial and material resources away from state-owned factories, 
sometimes through illegal means. They are also charged with frequent tax 
evasion and with being major sources of pollution. Officials in Beijing say 
those found to be wasting energy or raw materials, producing poor quality 
products or causing severe pollution should be shut down. 
</P>
<P>
These new pressures come in the context of a program launched late last year to 
"improve the economic environment and rectify the economic order." The key goal 
of the program is to reduce inflation, which ran at an official rate of 26% in 
1988, by stopping many construction projects, tightening credit and 
reintroducing some price controls. The program also aims at directing resources 
away from light industry and toward improvement of the basic infrastructure. So 
far, the main effects have been to provoke a severe economic slowdown and 
sharply reduce inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts also have been stepped up to restrict the highly profitable but illegal 
diversion of materials from controlled distribution channels, where goods sell 
at low, state-set prices, to free markets, where they are worth much more. 
</P>
<P>
Qiu Zongcheng, deputy director of the Shanghai Diesel Engine Works, complained 
that in recent years, small companies set up in the course of reforms would 
sometimes make money by buying his firm's diesel engines at state-set prices 
and reselling them illegally for high profits. 
</P>
<P>
"This problem now is being solved step by step," Qiu said. "This has eliminated 
interference that cropped up in the course of reform and brought us trouble." 
</P>
<P>
The diesel engine factory, which receives subsidized raw materials according to 
the state plan, still is not free to sell its products at market prices. But as 
part of the shift in government priorities, it received a loan equal to about 
$3 million that helped it boost production by about 7% this year, Qiu said. 
</P>
<P>
Reformists' hopes centered on Zhao had been largely to eliminate the two-track 
pricing system by allowing more goods to sell at market prices. But efforts 
toward this goal were sidetracked when the top leadership decided last year 
that first priority must go to the fight against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in the face of austerity and tightened controls, many enterprises in the 
market-oriented sector of the economy have collapsed for lack of loans, raw 
materials or markets, or have been shut down by administrative orders. 
</P>
<P>
The number of small individually owned urban businesses employing eight people 
or fewer fell by 2.18 million during the first half of this year, leaving a 
total of 12.34 million businesses employing a total of 19 million people, 
according to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. China also has 
about 220,000 private enterprises in a separate legal category for those 
employing more than eight people. 
</P>
<P>
Additional pressure has been placed on private businesses since midsummer, when 
a further effort was launched to "inspect and clean" such firms. While some 
aspects of the campaign aim to stop illegal activities such as the sale of 
pornographic publications or counterfeit goods, other features simply impose 
new bureaucratic barriers. 
</P>
<P>
Even more important than these privately owned urban businesses are the rural 
enterprises owned by peasants and local governments, which constitute the main 
force in the market-oriented sector of China's economy. Early this year, China 
had about 18 million of these enterprises, employing about 95 million workers, 
or 24% of the rural labor force, according to official statistics. Such 
enterprises produced $175 billion in goods last year, about 35% of China's 
total industrial production, according to Ministry of Agriculture figures. 
</P>
<P>
Rural enterprises enjoyed 30% real growth in output during 1988, according to 
the State Statistical Bureau. But production during August of this year, the 
most recent month for which statistics are available, was up only 9% above that 
of August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Guo Mantang, director of the Ministry of Agriculture's Township Enterprise 
Management Bureau, was quoted in May by the official China Daily as stating 
that as many as 30% of township enterprises in the country might go bankrupt 
this year because of the austerity policies. 
</P>
<P>
Things seem not to have reached that point of severity. But a sharp slowdown is 
under way. 
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture announced in August that 1.8 million rural 
enterprises, 10% of the nation's total, shut down during the first half of this 
year, and that 3.6 million more slashed production by 50% or more. Between 10 
million and 15 million workers lost their jobs, according to a ministry 
official who was quoted on state-run radio. 
</P>
<P>
But Zhang, head of the rural factory that dominates the Shanghai-area market 
for specialized thread used in making leather products, is still splitting her 
work force into three shifts to keep her spindles running 24 hours a day. Her 
firm, which buys synthetic fibers at 10% to 15% above the government-set price 
and sells thick thread to about 80 leather-working factories, is expanding. 
</P>
<P>
"Village and township enterprises have been affected to some degree by the 
economic retrenchment," Zhang said. "But if an enterprise is well-managed and 
produces good products, the effect isn't too great. We are still confident 
about the future of our factory."

Airlines carried a record number of passengers last year, boosting worldwide 
profits to $1.6 billion, the International Air Transport Assn. said in a report 
released today. 
</P>
<P>
The annual report from IATA, which is holding its general assembly in the 
Polish capital this week, predicted another bumper year in 1989, but warned 
that air congestion would limit future expansion, especially in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In a bid to improve security and safety measures, IATA said it plans to step up 
checks on airport security and review the problem of human error in air 
crashes. 
</P>
<P>
Air congestion and security are expected to be the main themes at IATA's annual 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The report said IATA's 187 member airlines carried 632 million passengers last 
year, a 2% rise over the record set in 1987. Of these, 190 million flew on 
international scheduled flights, over 6% more than in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Another 22 million people flew on domestic and international charter flights. 
</P>
<P>
The report predicted that international scheduled passenger traffic would grow 
8% in 1989 and 1990, but drop back to about 7% in the following three years. 
</P>
<P>
The report said the most rapid expansion should be in Asia and the Pacific. Air 
traffic in Europe and North America is expected to grow at a rate of about 6% a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Insufficient airport capacity could limit growth in Europe, where congestion 
problems are most acute, it said. 
</P>
<P>
"The lack of adequate airport and air space capacity to meet current and future 
demand continues to be the major problem facing the air transport industry 
today," the report commented. 
</P>
<P>
IATA has identified 35 airports in West Europe as "congested," and has said 
that Sydney, Bombay, Hong Kong and the Japanese cities of Tokyo and Osaka also 
are suffering from lack of airport space. 
</P>
<P>
It said recent airliner accidents have led to growing concern about the 
structural safety of older aircraft. But excess demand for new planes is 
forcing many airlines to modify rather than replace older aircraft. This would 
add to costs and impose yet another constraint on the industry's growth, it 
added.

CHIP MAKERS IN JAPAN BOOST PLANT SPENDING;

Japanese microchip makers, more optimistic than others that their industry will 
continue to grow, have announced increased investment in plants and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The new spending, on top of already large investment by the industry, has been 
called "excessive" by some foreign microchip makers. But Japanese firms say new 
funds, mostly for expensive plants to make next-generation chips, are 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"Four-megabit dynamic random access memory (DRAM) microchip plants cost a lot 
-- it's not excessive, only what's needed," a Mitsubishi Electric spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some foreign firms, expecting slower demand, fear a repeat of the excess supply 
that threw the industry into a depression and forced many U.S. firms out of the 
business in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a continuing trend among the Japanese companies to stay ahead of 
demand by a very large margin," Intel Japan KK Chairman Takahiro Kamo said in a 
recent interview. Intel Japan is a unit of Intel Corp. of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But the Japanese firms boosting investment say growth in demand for the current 
one-megabit DRAMs, while slowing, will remain positive in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, current investments are for four-megabit DRAM plants that will not 
come on line until 1990 or 1991, when demand should rise, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"Global demand is slowing now, but we think it will still be positive next 
year, and grow even more in 1991," said a spokesman for Hitachi Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
The company is boosting its microchip capital investment for the fiscal year to 
March 31 to $669 million (95 billion yen), 35.7% above last year's level. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Jeremy, electronics analyst at Baring Securities (Japan), said Japanese 
microchip makers were "front-loading" their investments now, before slumping 
microchip prices erode profitability next year and make extra spending harder. 
</P>
<P>
"They're spending prudently while they have cash and time in their favor," he 
said. "The longer they wait to introduce four-megabit DRAMs, the more chance 
there will be for a challenge from overseas competitors. They want to lead the 
four-megabit DRAM generation," he added. 
</P>
<P>
U.S., European and South Korean makers are aggressively pursuing Japan's 
technological lead, hoping they can catch up before demand soars, Jeremy said. 
</P>
<P>
Hitachi, Toshiba Corp., Fujitsu Ltd. and other Japanese makers plan to begin 
mass-producing four-megabit DRAMs in mid-1990. 
</P>
<P>
But demand for the chips is not expected to be strong until a year later, with 
the introduction of high-definition televisions and increased sales of 
engineering workstations and 32-bit personal computers, Jeremy added. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi announced the most dramatic increase in investment, raising its 
microchip-related capital spending for 1989-90 to $437 million (62 billion 
yen), 37.8% above last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made a big increase, but our amount had been low. Now we're catching up 
with our competitors' level," a Mitsubishi spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
He said all of the increased outlay would go toward a new four-megabit DRAM 
plant scheduled to go on line in 1991 with a capacity of 8 million chips a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Toshiba and NEC have also announced increases in investment.

Mobil to Cut 400 Employees at Unit: Mobil Corp. said a previously announced 
reorganization of its U.S. operations would involve the reduction of about 400 
employees in its Mobil Exploration &amp; Producing affiliate, which employs 
5,000 nationwide. The company said the biggest reduction would be at its Denver 
office, which will lose 105 of its 430 staff members. Offices in Dallas, 
Houston, New Orleans and Midland, Tex., will also lose workers, said Mobil 
spokesman John Lord, while offices in Bakersfield; Liberal, Kan., and Oklahoma 
City will gain some.

Mortgage Rates Dip: Fixed-rate home mortgages averaged 9.82% last week, the 
lowest level since early August, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said. 
That rate was down from 9.92% the previous week and was the lowest since 
fixed-rate mortgages averaged 9.68% the week ending Aug. 4. On one-year 
adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average initial rate of 8.58% 
last week, the same as the week before, Freddie Mac said.

Nine leading Australian business groups have attacked Prime Minister Bob 
Hawke's Labor government, accusing it of political expediency in delaying two 
large projects to ensure that the environment is protected. 
</P>
<P>
The government has refused to give the go-ahead for two large, export-earning 
projects: a $780-million pulp and paper mill in Tasmania and a gold, platinum 
and palladium mine in the Northern Territory. 
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement released in Canberra, the nine groups said recent 
government decisions had sent a clear message to Australian business. "That 
message is: Resource development and business investment are subject to 
short-term political expediency. 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest threat to business investment is uncertainty. The uncertainty 
created by a government that goes back on its undertakings is undermining 
business confidence." 
</P>
<P>
The government's decisions have not ruled out the projects altogether, but they 
face lengthy delays, and the participants are unsure whether the projects will 
ever begin. The groups said it was a fallacy for politicians and bureaucrats to 
assume that deferral of investment proposals was costless. 
</P>
<P>
"Business cannot confidently invest in the current climate," the groups 
declared. "We urge the government to renew business confidence by establishing 
and abiding by clear and firm guidelines for investment and environment 
protection."

Yaohan, a Japanese retail group, is moving its headquarters to Hong Kong and 
concentrating on developing overseas outlets in what is believed to be the 
first time that a Japanese company has shifted its base abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Kazuo Wada said Japan's law governing large retail chains hinders the 
expansion of department store groups. He has long been an outspoken critic of 
this law, claiming that its protection of small, family-owned shops contributes 
to high retail prices in Japan. The law has also become a target of U.S. 
government criticism on the grounds that it prevents the rationalization of 
Japan's anti-import distribution systems. 
</P>
<P>
The family-controlled company, based in a small town 100 miles west of Tokyo, 
has become famous among Japanese retailers for opening department stores in 
Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and the United States and for adopting American 
management practices. 
</P>
<P>
Sales abroad account for 35% of group turnover, which stands at $1.35 billion. 
Yaohan aims to raise the overseas share to 60% by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
Yaohan has a maverick reputation: It recently announced a four-day week for 
employees, unheard of in workaholic Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Its latest move will be welcomed in Hong Kong, where several local corporate 
groups have changed their domicile to Bermuda ahead of the reversion of the 
colony to China in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
Most large Japanese department store groups have concentrated on the domestic 
market, with only token representation in prestige locations such as London and 
New York. Yaohan has 22 stores overseas.

OLD TIES TO S. KOREA PAY OFF FOR U.S. ARCHITECT; 
</P>
<P>
CULTURE: A LONG PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIP PROVES WORTHWHILE WHEN ASIAN 
CONSTRUCTION FIRMS BECAME INTERESTED IN U.S. PROJECTS. 
</P>

William E. Swank Sr.'s Korean business connection began in Bahrain 19 years 
ago. The California architect was in the Mideast working on the Diplomat Hotel 
at the same time that big Korean construction firms were undertaking huge 
projects in the area. Swank came to know and respect the Korean firms, 
particularly Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction Co., which managed to build 
a dry dock despite material shortages and skyrocketing costs. 
</P>
<P>
"I was most impressed by their work ethic. They were obsessed with performing 
on time. Hyundai was willing to come in with whatever was necessary. They had a 
shipping line. They built a temporary dock, a cement factory." 
</P>
<P>
That early admiration turned into a professional relationship when Swank went 
to work for Hyundai on its Mideast projects. "A lot of the stuff in the Mideast 
was 180 degrees different than Korean courtesies and niceties. . . . I was 
known as a firefighter, as one who knew Korean capabilities," Swank explained 
during a recent interview in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
That was the beginning of Swank's long relationship with Korean business 
interests, which have proved most worthwhile upon his return to the United 
States from South Korea and China in 1985. He has succeeded in linking up with 
Korean firms in joint ventures for U.S. construction projects. His experience, 
Swank surmises, "enabled me to leap over whole issues of capability and 
cultural issues." 
</P>
<P>
He was a minority partner with Ssangyong Construction in developing the 
$20-million, 200-suite Marriott Residence Inn in Anaheim that opened earlier 
this year. The Korean firm, which has offices in Garden Grove, is part of 
Ssangyong Group, one of South Korea's giant family-owned conglomerates known as 
chaebols. Swank was initially involved with, but later dropped out of, another 
Ssangyong project, a Residence Inn in San Diego, which opened last month. 
</P>
<P>
He is now at work on a $15-million, 140-suite "extended-stay" hotel, a joint 
venture with Byucksan America, a U.S. subsidiary of another Korean 
conglomerate. The hotel will be managed as a Residence Inn by Marriott Inc. 
Swank says he is also working on a 252-acre, $120-million golf course/condo 
project for Palm Desert with private Korean investors, whom he declined to 
identify because the deal is not complete. 
</P>
<P>
Swank credits his new business ventures to his previous ties with Korean 
businessmen. They, like other Asian businessmen, value long business 
relationships. Swank and his 33-year-old son, William Jr., initially had 
developed the concept for the Anaheim Residence Inn with S. H. Cho, a former 
Hyundai executive who now lives in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Then Swank received a phone call from S. Joon Kim, president of Ssangyong 
Construction Co. "I don't know how S. Joon Kim got my name. He called me. I 
knew of him. He called from Century City. We met at the Hyatt in Anaheim that 
same day and went out to visit the construction site where there a big sign 
with blank space for the name of the general contractor. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'I'd like Ssangyong's name on that sign.' We made a handshake deal 
within 10 minutes. They had checked me out. I knew the capabilities of the 
Koreans and their work ethnic, so without prolonged discussion or debate we 
could decide OK, let's go do it. I knew there would be some difficulties along 
the way, but I knew we could do it." Ssangyong took a 70% interest in the 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
Swank, who says he understands some Korean but doesn't speak the language, said 
he figured that the Anaheim project was "big enough to be proud of it, but 
small enough to minimize the risks so we could do it." It also provided 
Ssangyong, which had developed the Bayview Plaza Shopping Center in San 
Francisco, an opportunity to learn a different segment of the U.S. construction 
business. The Korean company sent two employees from Seoul but used local 
subcontractors on the Anaheim project. 
</P>
<P>
Korean construction firms are interested in U.S. investments and projects 
because rules for investments abroad were recently liberalized in South Korea. 
Ssangyong, with the experience of three completed U.S. projects, has a head 
start over most other Korean construction firms in learning to how to analyze 
and assess U.S. projects. 
</P>
<P>
Swank says some U.S. interests see the Korean capital as an immediate gold 
mine. However, they send poorly conceived project proposals, mistaking the 
Korean firms' lack of U.S. experience for lack of construction knowledge and 
sophistication. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to get all kinds of proposals, from the ridiculous to the sublime. 
They would say, 'All you have to do is put out $300 million'. . . . 95% of them 
were just trash. All they had were ideas." 
</P>
<P>
He said many Korean construction firms want and need to learn about the U.S. 
construction business. "They don't completely understand the construction 
business in the United States. No one will hire them as a general contractor 
without experience. They have to hone their development skills. You can't take 
someone who is reasonably successful in the Mideast or Korea and send him here 
and expect him to be reasonably successful, because he has no background here. 
</P>
<P>
"My advice to anyone wanting to be involved with Korean firms is to search out 
the smaller firms, select a project modest in size to make sure you will have a 
successful project because everyone is trying to take too big a bite," Swank 
said. "You should try to establish a high level of communication, perhaps 
through a Korean attorney or bank, so you can present a project at an 
appropriate level. 
</P>
<P>
"Korean firms are searching, American firms are searching. Both are wandering 
around in the dark. If they just met, they could be a success. The fact that I 
knew a lot of people helped a lot. You have to search out intermediaries to 
meet with senior people in Korea, have references on all that you've done." 
</P>
<P>
Patience, he added, is important. "I don't push. Don't try to assume that your 
Korean counterpart is receiving and understanding everything. . . . You have to 
give them time to clearly understand." Completion and success of a project are 
more important than an American's percentage in a project. 
</P>
<P>
Last, "When there is a problem," he said, "solve it without noise. 'Noise' -- 
that's a word used a lot."

COMPOSITES TAKE OFF; 
</P>
<P>
WHILE SOME AEROSPACE SECTORS CONTRACT, THE SOUTHLAND'S MAKERS OF REINFORCED 
PLASTICS TRY TO KEEP UP WITH DEMAND.

<P>
When the Northrop B-2 Stealth bomber -- variously described as looking like a 
bat, a whale or an alien spaceship -- lifted off a Mojave Desert runway for the 
first time last July, world attention focused on the aircraft's unconventional 
aerodynamic shape. 
</P>
<P>
But the flight also signaled a major leap forward in the use of composite 
materials, the reinforced plastics that are finally coming out of research labs 
and into major production programs. 
</P>
<P>
The aerospace industry has researched and tested composites for decades, but 
only in the past several years have manufacturers made large-scale shifts to 
lightweight composites from traditional aluminum for aircraft structure. 
</P>
<P>
Although much of the aerospace industry faces a difficult contraction these 
days, the specialty companies that have staked out positions in composites are 
more concerned with managing explosive growth. 
</P>
<P>
"We are growing at an average of 25% a year, said Stephen Gill, president of M. 
C. Gill, a family-owned company in El Monte that specializes in making 
composite floors, ducts and cargo liners. "I have been here for 25 years and 
things have never looked better. If I could get the people in place, I could 
double in size tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
As in past aerospace industry evolutions, Southern California has emerged as 
the center of the composites industry, possessing a rich mix of major prime 
contractors, large specialty subcontractors and smaller vendors of everything 
from composite parts to capital equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of another area of the country that has more going for it than 
Los Angeles," Thomas Hynes, owner of Composites Horizons, a Covina-based 
producer of advanced composites for aerospace and health care. 
</P>
<P>
A major impetus of recent growth has been the development and production of 
stealth technology aircraft, which are designed to evade detection by enemy 
radar. Composite materials play a central role in the ability of stealth 
aircraft to absorb and deflect radar waves. 
</P>
<P>
The B-2 bomber is possibly the most advanced aircraft in its use of composite 
materials, although much is still secret. Northrop officials declined to 
discuss the types of materials or the amount of materials used in the B-2, but 
industry sources estimate that composites make up about 80% of the B-2 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
Composites are made of two essential ingredients: high-strength fibers that 
have been woven into tape or broadcloth and polymers that bind the fabric into 
a rigid and lightweight matrix. Carbon, graphite and glass are the most typical 
fibers used. Epoxy, polyester and phenolics are the most typical polymers used. 
</P>
<P>
In producing parts, the tape or broadcloth, which is impregnated with the 
polymer, is laid down on to a mold that represents the shape and contour of the 
part. Then, the entire piece is cured in an autoclave at a temperature of about 
350 degrees and a pressure of 100 pounds per square inch. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting part is typically 30% lighter than a comparable aluminum part and 
has four times the fatigue life -- critical parameters in aircraft design. Such 
parts can also be substantially stronger than aluminum because it is possible 
to orient the fibers so that the part is strongest in the direction that bears 
the greatest load. 
</P>
<P>
Art Rosene, Northrop project engineer for advanced programs, said the 
technology involved in producing the composite parts for the B-2 is just as 
advanced as the aircraft itself. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, Northrop built its Integrated Composites Center in Pico 
Rivera at an abandoned Ford Motor car factory, part of a $1.2-billion 
investment in new technology. Today, it is believed to be one of the biggest 
composites fabrication facilities in the industry, Rosene said. 
</P>
<P>
Rosene said Northrop has developed a computerized system that directly 
transfers three-dimensional designs for aircraft parts to machine tools in the 
factory. The company has also pioneered a new software system to automate the 
production of composite parts, increasing both efficiency and accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
Automating the fabrication of composite parts has been critical to increasing 
their usage. Northrop has developed what it calls a geodetic software system 
that permits complex contours to be built with automated tape-laying machines. 
Other manufacturers, including Lockheed, assert that they have the same 
capability. 
</P>
<P>
"It is like trying to wrap masking tape around an orange," Rosene said. "No 
matter how hard you try, there will be gaps where the tape doesn't touch the 
orange." 
</P>
<P>
So far, aerospace companies have turned to composites because they are best for 
the mission of the aircraft or spacecraft, such as in the stealth technology 
case. 
</P>
<P>
The drawback with composites is 
</P>
<P>
their cost, both for raw materials and labor. But automation is rapidly 
bringing down the manufacturing cost, and aerospace experts say the day is 
close at hand when composite parts can be built and assembled as cheaply as 
aluminum.

"In most cases, you can't beat the cost of making individual parts out of 
aluminum, but when you start putting the airplane together, that's where 
composites really shine," said Arthur James, a Lockheed program manager at its 
Composites Development Center in Burbank. "Most of the parts that make up an 
airplane are pretty small, and it costs a lot of money to put them together. 
So, we want to eliminate a lot of these smaller parts with more complex 
composites." 
</P>
<P>
In another vote of confidence for the future of composites and for the Southern 
California aerospace industry, Lockheed is building a major composites 
fabrication facility in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
James said composites will make up 40% to 50% of the advanced tactical fighter, 
the next-generation Air Force jet that is being developed in a competition 
between Lockheed and Northrop. By comparison, the F-15 fighter developed in the 
early 1970s had only 4% of its structural weight made up of composites. 
</P>
<P>
In gross measures, the aerospace industry is rapidly increasing its use of 
composites. Including both military and commercial sectors, the industry used 
41.1 million pounds of composites in 1989, up from 39.4 million in 1988 and 
36.4 million in 1987, according to Stuart Lee, technical director of the 
Society of Materials and Process Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
But in some specialized areas, particularly the use of high-strength carbon 
fibers, growth is even more rapid. Consumption of carbon fiber composites is 
projected to grow from 5.3 million pounds in 1988 to 11.3 million pounds in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
The next big breakthrough in composites will be production of thermoplastic 
composites, a breed apart from the current generation of thermoset composites. 
</P>
<P>
With thermosets, the parts take their final shape in the autoclave. But with 
thermoplastics, the heated laminates come out of the autoclave and are pressed 
into their final form, much like metal is stamped in a press. Thermoplastics 
could dramatically cut production costs and virtually eliminate current 
environmental problems with emissions of volatile solvents and other toxics. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the big aerospace firms and smaller subcontractors, Southern 
California has a huge supply industry, including six major firms that 
impregnate fabric with polymers. They are called pre-preggers. 
</P>
<P>
Hitco, Hexcel, Sargent-Fletcher, Air-Tec, Richmond Technology, Ferrow, 
Ciba-Geigy, American Cyanamid, Fiberite and others also are players in the 
local industry. Total employment is unknown but is believed to be in the tens 
of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
B. F. Goodrich makes composite aircraft brakes in Sante Fe Springs and is 
moving into building high-temperature parts for the new National Aerospace 
Plane, the craft that will take off like an airplane and soar into space like a 
rocket. 
</P>
<P>
The industrial infrastructure also includes three manufacturers of plastic 
vacuum bags that are used in the autoclaves. One small vacuum bag maker, 
Bondline Products in Norwalk, has as many patents as it has employees -- four. 
It is making a line of reusable bags to displace the costly throwaway bags. 
Cosby M. Newsom, president of the firm, said his technology can reduce by a 
hundredfold the time that it takes to bag a part. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Southern California has the largest pool of skilled aerospace 
workers in the country, composites companies face a severe labor shortage. 
</P>
<P>
"I have 30 companies looking for people," said Terry Price, chairman of the 
department of manufacturing technology at Cerritos College, a major regional 
center for composites studies. "Companies are just screaming for people. There 
are jobs for lab technicians, salesmen, engineers, lay-up fabricators and 
quality control inspectors." 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos College is opening a 10,000-square-foot manufacturing technology 
center for composites and plastics, James said, funded in part by a consortium 
of local aerospace firms. Meanwhile, at the higher academic research level, 
UCLA has become a leading center for research into high-temperature composites, 
including ceramic, metal and carbon composites, according to Professor J. M. 
Yang of the school's department of materials science and engineering. 
</P>
<P>
THE GROWING USE OF COMPOSITES 
</P>
<P>
Development of composites has reached the point where application is moving 
from military sectors into the commercial sectors of the aerospace industry. 
This raises expectations of revolutionary methods of airframe construction that 
will considerably exceed the potential of most present-day eqiupment. 
</P>
<P>
F-117A STEALTH FIGHTER: The Lockheed F-117A Stealth fighter makes the first 
broad application of composites technology to a U.S military jet. 
</P>
<P>
B-2 STEALTH BOMBER: The Northrop B-2 Stealth bomber is the first heavy aircraft 
built mostly of composites, used extensively in its skin and in its structure. 
The bomber has composite stringers, reinforcements that span its frames. 
</P>
<P>
B-1 BOMBER: This present-day bomber has incorporated the use of composite 
materials in the follwing places: 1) fuselage, 2) wings, 3) tailcone, 4) engine 
inlets. Use of composite materials in the next generation of aircraft coming 
into production will be even more widespread. 
</P>
<P>
SLATS: Used to chamber the wing for high lift at low speeds and high angle of 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
WING TANKS: Fuel is housed in self-sealing tanks inside the entire wing. 
</P>
<P>
TAILCONE: Houses a large part of the electronic countermeasures system. 
</P>
<P>
VARIABLE GEOMETRY WING: The swing wing is moved into the swept position by 
hydraulic screw jacks. The fully swept position is used for supersonic flight.

At Bell High School, they're working on ending "squawk box" interruptions over 
the public address system. At Micheltorena Elementary, they drew up a new lunch 
and recess schedule. And at Norwood Street Elementary, they tackled the irksome 
question of who gets to use the copying machine. 
</P>
<P>
In about 100 schools throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District -- and 
soon on the mammoth district's 500 other campuses -- newly elected local 
councils of teachers, parents and administrators are beginning to change the 
way decisions are made regarding the basics of daily school operations. 
</P>
<P>
Despite some initial complaints, the councils are producing surprising results. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it that they (the councils) are making decisions that would be 
dictatorial if they came from me," said Norwood Principal Angie Kasza. 
</P>
<P>
The new system is called "shared decision-making," a method of decentralizing 
power that is being tried in an increasing number of school districts across 
the country. It is taking shape in many forms. 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, an arrangement put into effect this fall gives parents significant 
power over local schools. In other cities such as Los Angeles, Santa Fe, N.M., 
and Rochester, N.Y., teachers are being given the dominant voice. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, educators say the councils signal a badly needed revamping of 
public education for the nation's second-largest school system, which has 
610,000 students. Educators across the country are watching how Los Angeles 
fares as it enters a largely uncharted area of educational reform -- one that 
says schools will not improve unless teachers have a major hand in running 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Giving more power to teachers sounds good, said Stanford University education 
professor Michael Kirst, "but there's not much basis for predicting how it will 
work." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the experiment has not been trouble-free. In several Los Angeles 
district schools, allegations of electioneering and failing to provide adequate 
information have marred the elections of parent and community representatives. 
</P>
<P>
For example, at Belvedere Elementary School in East Los Angeles, district and 
teachers' union officials delayed counting ballots until charges of ballot 
tampering and intimidating voters could be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Voter turnout at many of the year-round schools was abysmal; in some instances 
there were more candidates than people who showed up to cast ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Once elected, many parents have shown only spotty attendance. And after only a 
few meetings, some parents, feeling outnumbered and harboring years of 
frustration over low-performing schools, say they already are disillusioned. 
</P>
<P>
"It's power for principals and teachers," said Janice White, a parent 
representative at Main Street School in South-Central Los Angeles. "It 
alienates the parents and community at our school." 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the contract with United Teachers-Los Angeles, forged after 
last May's teacher strike, principals no longer can make unilateral decisions 
in five specific areas: continuing education programs for teachers; student 
discipline guidelines; scheduling of final exams and other school activities; 
spending of certain monies, such as lottery funds; and use of school equipment, 
such as the copier. Those decisions will be made by the council through a 
consensus process, with a vote being taken only as a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
The councils range in size from six to 16 members, depending on school 
enrollment. Half of each council must be made up of the local UTLA chapter 
chair and other teachers, while the remaining seats are filled by the 
principal, parent and community representatives and other school employees. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers at all schools chose their representatives over the summer. District 
and union officials said the election of more than 2,000 parent and community 
representatives will be completed in November. 
</P>
<P>
Campuses that operate year-round because of crowding were the first to form 
councils. These schools started their academic year in July. Councils at the 
district's other schools are expected to begin meeting soon. 
</P>
<P>
At Norwood, a year-round school near downtown Los Angeles, one of the first 
items on the agenda was to review the use of the school's only copying machine, 
which is operated by clerks and administrators. Teachers raised the issue 
because they were frustrated about a school policy that said they had to submit 
copying requests 24 hours in advance. 
</P>
<P>
The council reviewed the cost of running the machine, which Principal Kasza 
said amounts to $18,000 a year for the lease, maintenance and supplies. It 
decided to start a system for filling emergency copying requests so teachers 
could have copies made of lesson materials in the morning for use the same day. 
But the council imposed a limit, allowing no more than a daily total of 60 
copies per teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"I found that when they analyzed the cost of operating the machine, they were 
horror-stricken. They decided to restrict the use of it rather than open it 
up," Kasza said. "I wouldn't have had the nerve to make that decision. And you 
know what? It's working." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Romo, a Norwood second-grade teacher and council co-chair, described 
the new policy as an important morale booster. Teachers have long complained 
that they are victims of bureaucratic tyranny, with their powerlessness to 
control a piece of equipment as mundane as a copying machine a symbol of their 
lowly status. 
</P>
<P>
"I know when the average person reads in the newspaper about teachers wanting 
access to the Xerox machine, they think it's ludicrous. . . . But we won the 
right in our contract to make these decisions," Romo said, and teachers will 
demand a voice in setting 
</P>
<P>
more momentous policies in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll never go back to the point of accepting things from the top blindly. 
We're going to question things," he said. "(Teachers) keep coming up to me and 
asking, 'Is this the way things are supposed to be done? Can we change things 
and do things better?' I think it's great. It shows we are professionals." 
</P>
<P>
At Bell High, a year-round school in the city of Bell, the council has turned 
its attention to alleged abuses of the school's public address system. 
</P>
<P>
Bell teachers said the P.A. system too often is used to make "inane" 
announcements, such as reporting prom queen election results or the license 
plate of a car left with its lights on in the school parking lot. This disrupts 
classes, which are too short to begin with, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should 2,400 students be jolted out of what they are doing to hear someone 
say 'Will so-and-so please call the office,'?" music teacher Ken Salter said at 
a recent council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
After a lengthy discussion, the council agreed to turn the matter over to a 
subcommittee to draft guidelines. Principal Mary Ann Sesma agreed on the 
condition that a student would be included in the group. 
</P>
<P>
Then the council took up the matter of student discipline, a topic that 
provoked critical comments from several of the parent and community members. 
One member told the council of her children's complaints that school was 
boring. Another asked why the school hadn't contacted her about her son's 
truancy problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The outside community has the feeling that this (shared decision-making) isn't 
going to work," said Pat Quiles, a retired maintenance administrator for the 
city of Los Angeles whose four children attended district schools. "After all 
these years, there has been no (improvement in) achievement. So why do this 
now? 
</P>
<P>
"The record shows that our schools are down in the bottom as far as achievement 
levels go," Quiles said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Social studies teacher and council co-chair Beverly Cook said winning the 
parents' trust is going to be a challenge. "They blame us and want us to cure 
it all," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Principal Sesma agreed. "I'm trying to get people to think about where the 
school is now -- and where they want it to go. They have to create a vision of 
what they want to see in the school five years from now." 
</P>
<P>
Some say that it is hard to envision profound gains in school performance when 
the councils' authority is limited to such concerns as copying machines and 
when final exams should be given. But the councils will have a chance to 
demonstrate their need for more sweeping powers next year when district and 
union officials will begin inviting proposals for "school-based management," 
the next phase of the restructuring plan outlined in the teachers' contract. 
</P>
<P>
In Miami, changes undertaken by school-based management teams have included 
reorganizing the school day to create longer instructional periods, for 
instance, and hiring Berlitz instructors to teach foreign languages. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Bernstein, a UTLA vice president who is a co-chair of the districtwide 
central council on school-based management, said Los Angeles teachers are 
beginning to talk about such changes as combining primary grades into 
cooperative learning groups, personalizing large schools by breaking them up 
into several mini-schools, and providing child care on campus for students who 
are already parents. 
</P>
<P>
School-based management is the revolution that will turn around low-performing 
schools, Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
For now, teachers, principals and parents say, they are struggling to learn the 
basics: how to set up a school calendar, how to read a budget and boning up on 
district policies. And they are trying to get along without the adversarial 
roles to which many of them had grown accustomed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little awkward now," said Lucille Derrig, principal of Miles Avenue 
School in Huntington Park. "I'm used to making decisions sometimes without 
having to consult other people. Now I have to think twice about moving too fast 
in certain areas. 
</P>
<P>
"And it's a little awkward for teachers, too," she added, "because they need 
background information" before they can make decisions. 
</P>
<P>
For many parents, the challenge is to become equal partners with administrators 
and faculty. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that shared decision-making is a great idea," said Larry Galvan, a Bell 
High School parent member. "But you know what? It's not going to succeed unless 
the others remember the parent. There are some of us who do know what we are 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
School districts across the country are looking for new ways to decentralize 
authority and raise academic performance. One promising strategy is "shared 
decision-making," which involves giving greater power to teachers, parents and 
administrators in individual schools. Some experts say it could lead to 
dramatic improvements in the way schools operate.

QUAKE AID TAX HIKE? YES ON SALES, NO ON GAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By GEORGE SKELTON, TIMES SACRAMENTO BUREAU CHIEF

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most Californians are willing to pay a higher sales tax temporarily to raise 
money for Bay Area earthquake repairs and relief, but they strongly oppose 
increasing the gasoline tax, The Times Poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
Most people also say they want the state Department of Transportation to place 
its highest priority on repairing old freeways to make them safer, rather than 
building new roadways to relieve traffic congestion, the survey showed. 
</P>
<P>
Half the people, furthermore, think that Caltrans should cancel its plans to 
double-deck crowded freeways, such as the Harbor in Los Angeles, in view of the 
collapse of the double-deck Nimitz Freeway in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Half the people blame no one for the Nimitz's collapse, but a third say 
incompetence in construction may have played a part, and 15% even suspect 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The Times Poll, directed by I.A. Lewis, interviewed 1,377 adults by telephone 
Thursday through Saturday in the first statewide poll measuring 
earthquake-related attitudes since the San Francisco Bay Area and the adjacent 
Santa Cruz-Hollister regions were struck with a devastating temblor Oct. 17. 
The 7.1-magnitude quake killed at least 63 people and caused more than $7 
billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative leaders are scheduled to meet in 
Sacramento today to set the agenda for a special session of the Legislature to 
decide how to finance the state's share of earthquake repairs and assistance 
for victims. 
</P>
<P>
Both the governor and legislative leaders are considering a temporary increase 
in the sales tax, which now ranges from 6 to 7 cents in various regions, or a 
stopgap hike in the 18-cent-per-gallon state/federal tax on gasoline -- or a 
combination of both taxes. Deukmejian reportedly is leaning toward asking 
merely for standby authority to raise taxes on his own if he decides that the 
state's present tax system is not producing enough money for earthquake repairs 
and relief. 
</P>
<P>
Of those surveyed by The Times, 52% said they would accept a higher sales tax 
"for some period of time in order to pay for earthquake repairs and to aid 
earthquake victims in Northern California." Forty-one percent opposed a sales 
tax hike and 7% were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
For politicians trying to make the tough decision, the good news was that 
people who are registered to vote are especially supportive of a sales tax 
increase -- by 55% to 38%. Democrats and Republicans alike feel this way. 
Non-voters are about evenly divided on the question. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Southern California residents are less enthusiastic than 
Northern Californians are about paying a higher sales tax to benefit the Bay 
Area. 
</P>
<P>
By race, most whites and blacks support a sales tax hike, but Latinos are split 
about evenly. 
</P>
<P>
On the average, people said they would be willing to have the sales tax 
increased by about 1 cent on the dollar for a period of roughly two years -- an 
especially generous gesture. That would raise around $8.6 billion, far more 
than the state anticipates ever needing to finance victim assistance and 
structural repairs resulting from the Oct. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
But the gasoline tax is another matter. Of those interviewed, only 36% 
supported raising it. A whopping 60% opposed the idea, with just 4% undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Voters and non-voters, Democrats and Republicans, northerners and southerners 
alike all opposed a gas tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the disastrous earthquake has generated no new support for a 
sweeping ballot measure offered by Deukmejian and the Legislature that would 
permanently raise the gasoline tax by 9 cents a gallon and revise the state 
spending limit to finance highway construction and improvements. The proposal 
is destined for the state primary ballot next June. 
</P>
<P>
In this post-earthquake survey, only 25% of the registered voters favored the 
ballot measure, with 55% opposing it and 20% undecided. In an earlier, 
pre-earthquake survey by The Times Poll this month, the results were 
essentially the same: 29% in favor, 53% opposed and 18% undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Oct. 17 temblor, Caltrans Director Robert K. Best has conceded that 
earthquake safety in recent years "was not the highest priority . . . for the 
expenditure of whatever funds became available." However, Californians 
apparently now think that it should be. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether they think "a priority should be given to repairing old freeways 
to make them safer, or a priority should be given to constructing new freeways 
to help ease traffic congestion," 57% opted for making existing roads safer. 
Only 32% said build more highways, and 11% were not sure. People all over the 
state generally felt this way. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, where motorists daily encounter bumper-to-bumper traffic 
jams but also live with the nagging fear of someday being rocked by a massive 
earthquake, people by 2 to 1 favor placing the priority on freeway structural 
safety rather than on freeway expansion. 
</P>
<P>
And with 39 confirmed deaths in the Nimitz collapse freshly in their minds, 
Californians also believe, by a narrow 5-4 ratio, that Caltrans should scrub 
its plans to double-deck freeways. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, there are plans to double-deck not only 2.6 miles of the 
Harbor just south of downtown, but also parts of the Ventura, Santa Ana, San 
Diego and Santa Monica freeways. Los Angeles residents are more opposed to 
double-decking than other Californians, rejecting the concept by about 3 to 2. 
In the Bay Area, people still tend to favor double-decking. 
</P>
<P>
While half the people reject the notion that construction incompetence or fraud 
were to blame for the crumbling of the Nimitz, 61% nevertheless believe that 
"the government" has failed to do "all it could to make sure the freeways are 
safe enough to use." 
</P>
<P>
Californians say they are concerned about earthquake safety, but many also seem 
to accept temblors as a way of life in this state. 
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds say they have experienced an earthquake -- and more than half of 
these people report it was a "bad" experience. Moreover, according to this 
survey, people believe that the chances are better than 50-50 that "the big 
one" -- with a magnitude of 8 or higher -- will strike in or very near the area 
where they live. 
</P>
<P>
Yet 90% said that since the Oct. 17 earthquake they have not "thought about 
moving away" to another area. This generally was the sentiment all over the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said they do not have earthquake insurance 
and do not intend to get any. Roughly one-fifth reported they already had quake 
insurance before Oct. 17 and another one-tenth said they now plan to obtain it. 
</P>
<P>
Only 21% said that since the Northern California temblor hit have they "taken 
certain earthquake precautions around the house" -- such as securing loose 
objects, placing straps around water heaters, moving heavy objects closer to 
the floor, making window glass shatterproof or bolting the house frame to its 
foundation. People living in Los Angeles County and the Bay Area have tended to 
take these steps more than other Californians. 
</P>
<P>
Only 37% said they have stocked up on "certain supplies people ought to have on 
hand in case of an earthquake" -- such as a portable radio, flashlight, extra 
batteries, first-aid kit, adjustable wrench for turning off water and gas 
lines, bottled water and canned or dried food. 
</P>
<P>
However, 62% of those interviewed said they would feel safe at home "if 'the 
big' earthquake struck." Only 38% said they would feel safe at work. And just 
36% felt they would be safe driving on the roadways and bridges near their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
In the stricken Bay Area, 43% of the people said they had "experienced 
psychological aftereffects from the earthquake" -- such as loss of appetite, 
having trouble concentrating, being depressed, frequently fearing for their 
safety, being more irritable than usual or having sleepless nights. Even in the 
rest of the state, 21% reported experiencing these psychological aftereffects. 
</P>
<P>
But asked to name "the most important problem facing California today," 
earthquake preparedness ranked low on the list. Crime and drugs, as usual, 
rated at the top, being chosen by 69%. (People were given up to two choices.) 
Next came homelessness, 22%; education, 20%; auto insurance, 18%; earthquake 
preparedness and the environment, both with 14%; health care, 9%, and 
transportation, 8%. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, 69% agreed that it was "proper" to have resumed the World Series in 
the Bay Area 10 days after the earthquake. Another 15% felt it should have been 
played somewhere else and 8% think it should have been canceled. Men, more than 
women, favored keeping the series in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The margin of error for a survey of this size is three percentage points in 
either direction. Of those surveyed, 1,041 were registered to vote and the 
error margin for just these people was four points. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE BIG ONE 
</P>

MANAGUA, Nicaragua 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By first vowing to end Nicaragua's cease-fire and then seeming to back away, 
President Daniel Ortega has managed at least to refocus attention on a problem 
the world had almost forgotten -- the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
But whether or not all-out war resumes, Ortega's move is a risk that could 
shift the onus for any new fighting from the U.S.-backed rebels onto his own 
government and undermine faith in an upcoming election that is crucial for 
reviving this nation's shattered economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Contras were shunted off Washington's agenda last spring by a bipartisan 
agreement to keep their army intact but passive through that election, 
scheduled for Feb. 25. Four Central American presidents then joined Ortega in 
signing an Aug. 7 accord to "demobilize" the Honduras-based rebels but offered 
no means to enforce it. 
</P>
<P>
With the war reduced to skirmishes, few outsiders cared that up to 10,000 
rebels remained under arms. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, however, the Contras have filtered into Nicaragua by the 
hundreds, warned rural people not to vote for Ortega, assassinated a candidate 
of the ruling Sandinistas in a small-town election and, in a sharp escalation 
eight days ago, killed 18 army reservists being trucked to register to vote, 
according to government officials and independent monitors. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega now faces demands by the Sandinista army to end a 19-month-old 
cease-fire. One of his aides said the army has proposed a blitzkrieg to drive 
the Contras back to Honduras by December, hoping that the final three months of 
the election campaign can be peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
But when Ortega used a summit meeting with President Bush and 14 other Western 
Hemisphere leaders in Costa Rica last Friday to announce a truce suspension as 
of Wednesday, he was ostracized for overreacting and suspected of maneuvering 
to cancel the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Ortega has fudged that impending date and downgraded his vow to 
"hit the Contras hard" from a decision to a threat. Speaking in the town of 
Rivas on Sunday, he insisted "we cannot keep turning the other cheek." But he 
also said that he is "analyzing the situation" while seeking firmer diplomatic 
support for disbanding the Contras, and added that he will announce a decision 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea was a mistake," an aide to Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez 
said Sunday. "We're still hoping he will back out of it." 
</P>
<P>
While the Contra attacks have brought the delicate process of peace through 
elections to a crisis, the burden of solving it seems to have fallen on Ortega. 
U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar said Saturday that he was 
"deeply worried" about "the inherent danger of renewed combat" here just days 
before the Security Council is to vote on a plan by the Central American 
presidents to station U.N. truce observers throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tricky situation for Ortega," said a foreign election observer in 
Managua. "The Sandinistas have right on their side, but as the government in 
power, they have more responsibility to keep the war from revving up. The 
Contras are beyond the law, but if the cease-fire breaks down, the government 
would be the villain of the piece." 
</P>
<P>
Signs of a government offensive are already showing. Reporters saw Sandinista 
military forces in trucks and jeeps take up positions on three sides of a rural 
Contra stronghold in Jinotega province Friday and then heard heavy fighting. 
Ten Contras were reported killed in a clash last week in Chontales. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats and human rights monitors say a lightning offensive would be risky 
because once begun, it would be hard to shut off. They recall that the Contras 
waged their fiercest attacks against Sandinista civilian targets when the army 
tried to drive them over the border during a yearlong suspension of U.S. 
military aid in 1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
They also believe that the psychological effect of Ortega's announcement could 
intensify the fighting or intimidate opposition candidates even if the army 
does not launch a major offensive. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been more effective to step up their counterattacks without 
declaring the cease-fire over," an Asian diplomat said. "Ortega's reasons are 
obviously more than military." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Sandinista officials said Ortega made his announcement during the 
summit to dramatize his anger over continuing Contra hostility. 
</P>
<P>
Since the cease-fire took hold in March, 1988, Ortega said, rebel attacks have 
left 736 dead and 1,153 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
"We hear that George Bush has pressure from the right wing in his country not 
to abandon the Contras," said a Foreign Ministry official. "Don't forget, we 
have pressure from our citizens to get rid of them. Outside Nicaragua everybody 
wants to pretend that the war is over. We have a lot of grieving mothers to 
prove otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
As in the past, however, Ortega miscalculated the international outcry against 
what, in political terms at home, seemed like a reasonable position. In 1985, 
for example, he visited Moscow to seek help in the face of declining economic 
assistance from the West. The trip came on the heels of a congressional vote to 
suspend Contra aid and prompted shocked lawmakers to reverse their decision. 
</P>
<P>
The spectacle of Ortega in army uniform at a summit honoring 100 years of 
democracy in pacifist Costa Rica, announcing a return to war, was equally 
shocking to the region's other leaders. Nobody supported him, and a joke 
circulated that he had come in a costume thinking it was already Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
"One can question the timing and the handling of (the announcement)," said Paul 
S. Reichler, a Washington attorney for the Sandinista government. "But the fact 
remains that the Contras are on a rampage. They are killing people." 
</P>
<P>
A Sandinista official conceded: "That message didn't come through as clear as 
Ortega hoped." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his considerable efforts to make peace with the Contras and hold 
internationally supervised elections, Ortega has been frustrated by lingering 
distrust abroad and a failure to secure Western aid to rebuild his destitute 
country. His recent tour of Mideast oil states gained no pledges of petroleum. 
A special conference between Nicaragua and potential Western donors set for 
this fall has been postponed until after the election. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Soviet Union has suspended arms shipments to Nicaragua and 
obliged East Germany to do likewise. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sandinistas have a strong feeling of isolation these days," the Asian 
diplomat said. "Because of this, they cannot sit quietly on the sidelines. When 
things go against them, they have a psychological need to do something drastic 
to attract attention." 
</P>
<P>
Although one of three polls published last week shows Ortega trailing his 
election rival and another shows him barely ahead, the diplomat and many other 
observers here doubt that Ortega wants to sabotage the election, as Secretary 
of State James A. Baker III suggested. They said Ortega knows his country 
cannot afford the diplomatic isolation that would result. 
</P>
<P>
But he is eager to exploit the new fighting to portray Violeta Barrios de 
Chamorro, his chief opponent, as the candidate of aggression. In Costa Rica, he 
distributed a letter purportedly signed by Enrique Bermudez, the Contra 
commander, expressing support for Chamorro, the U.S.-supported presidential 
nominee of a 14-party opposition coalition. She has refused to call for 
disbanding the Contras or to condemn their recent attacks, saying she does not 
believe Sandinista accounts of the war. 
</P>
<P>
While this strategy strikes a responsive chord with Sandinista supporters, the 
likelihood of renewed warfare alarms others. 
</P>
<P>
"All we hear from Ortega is that we want peace, we want peace," said Emilio 
Villarreal, 56, who attended the president's speech Sunday at a baseball 
stadium in Rivas. "If that's what he wants, why doesn't he negotiate with the 
Contras instead of fighting them?" 
</P>
<P>
Others in the town, which is far from the war zone but feels the war's economic 
devastation, were confused by Ortega's remarks. They thought he was talking 
about an end to the fighting, not an end to the cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy to hear it's ending," said Pablo Ulloa, 25. "We're tired of the 
war."

WINDS FAN BRUSH FIRES NEAR COAST; 
</P>
<P>
WEATHER: ABOUT 4,000 SPARSELY POPULATED ACRES BURN, AND TWO HOMES ARE DESTROYED 
BY FLAMES NEAR POINT MUGU. BOATERS AND COAST GUARDSMEN ARE RESCUED AT SEA.

Santa Ana winds gusting up to 50 m.p.h. swept parts of the Southland on Sunday, 
fanning several brush fires, one of which charred 4,000 sparsely populated 
acres and destroyed two homes near Malibu. The winds also tossed a Coast Guard 
rescue crew overboard in rough seas. 
</P>
<P>
At the Point Mugu Naval Air Station, which held its annual air show Sunday 
despite the wind, spokeswoman Eve Miller said: "It was very, very, very windy. 
We had tents and things that were blown over during the night. Some of them 
were just in tatters." 
</P>
<P>
"It'll blow hairpieces clear across town," said meteorologist Bill Hoffer of 
the National Weather Service, describing the powerful gusts. 
</P>
<P>
But the wind blew fire, not hairpieces, through the canyons and hillsides 
around Point Mugu, just across the Ventura County line from Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
The fast-moving blaze, which erupted at 5 a.m. and was 75% contained by late 
Sunday evening, destroyed two mountaintop homes and three other buildings and 
also forced the evacuation of more than 2,000 campers. The evacuees included 
110 frightened sixth- and seventh-graders who cut short a weekend camping trip 
by walking a half-mile from their campground to a nearby fire station. 
</P>
<P>
At times, the fire stretched for two miles along the coast. It sent a thick 
column of brown smoke billowing out over the Pacific Ocean, and left a hilltop 
campground at Point Mugu State Park looking like a barren moonscape. 
</P>
<P>
One official said the smoke was "darker than any night I've ever been in." 
</P>
<P>
More than 560 firefighters battled the blaze, which prompted authorities to 
close an eight-mile stretch of Pacific Coast Highway, from Encinal Canyon Road 
in Los Angeles County to Las Posas Road in Ventura County. At one point, flames 
shot across the road. 
</P>
<P>
There were only two minor injuries -- both to firefighters -- and authorities 
made no estimate of the monetary damage. They expected the fire to burn through 
the night, as they continued to fight it with a scaled-down crew. Cause of the 
blaze, which broke out at Deer Creek and Pacific View roads, was under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The flames sent an unknown number of residents -- including entertainer Dick 
Clark -- scurrying down the winding canyon roads toward the ocean for safety. 
Clark's Decker Canyon home was saved by firefighters who turned the flames 
away, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
One of Clark's neighbors, Jo Ann Malac, said she was awakened by the winds at 4 
a.m., when part of her horse corral blew onto her mobile home, punching a hole 
in the top. 
</P>
<P>
At 6 a.m., she said, a wall of fire appeared across the street from her 
property. She was alone at the time, accompanied only by her dog. 
</P>
<P>
"I freaked out," she said. "We were both screaming and barking." 
</P>
<P>
She and the dog hopped in her car and fled to safety with the flames literally 
chasing her down Deer Creek Road. 
</P>
<P>
She recalled being stuck behind another driver and "I thought, God, he's not 
going fast enough." She later learned the other driver was Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Farther north, the winds churned the sea near Oxnard and the Channel Islands, 
where at least 15 people -- including a four-man Coast Guard crew -- were 
rescued from their vessels by the Coast Guard and the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
In one instance, a Coast Guard vessel attempting to reach two people on a 
fishing boat ran aground on Santa Cruz Island, and a Navy helicopter was 
dispatched from Point Mugu to rescue the would-be rescuers. 
</P>
<P>
The four members of the Coast Guard crew -- who were tossed out of their 
lifeboat as it hit the breakers in 10-foot-high seas -- were reported safe, as 
were the two people on board the fishing boat, Coast Guard Lt. Mark Hudson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"'We're having a real busy day," he said. "No one expected the drastic weather 
change." 
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated Coast Guard rescue attempt took place after Navy and Coast Guard 
helicopters had already plucked nine people from boats that were yanked from 
their anchorages by high winds off Santa Rosa and Anacapa islands. 
</P>
<P>
One woman suffered a minor head injury and five other boaters were treated at a 
hospital for exposure. 
</P>
<P>
The wind also brought its wrath to the San Fernando Valley, where 4,000 
customers of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power were without 
electrical power for several hours Sunday morning. The outages began at 4 a.m. 
and occurred in the Chatsworth, Canoga Park and Granada Hills area. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP reported that most customers had power restored within two hours. 
</P>
<P>
The dry Santa Ana winds came out of the north and northeast, according Hoffer. 
A high-pressure system was circulating in Idaho, Washington, eastern Oregon and 
central Montana, forcing the winds to whip through the deserts toward the 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
The winds, which at 11 a.m. Sunday were gusting as high as 50 m.p.h. at Laguna 
Peak near the Point Mugu air station, had died down somewhat by afternoon, and 
were expected to diminish considerably today after picking up again during the 
night, Hoffer said. 
</P>
<P>
The gusts made firefighting especially frustrating. As the wind whipped through 
the canyons around Point Mugu, temperatures grew hotter, drying out brush, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters were relegated to simply trying to protect structures on the 
ground, while helicopters and small planes made water drops. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have access to water up in those canyons. We are fighting it mainly 
by air," said Sandy Wells, a Ventura County Fire Department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
But officials were forced to call off the helicopters and airplanes at 
nightfall. About 80 firefighters were expected to work through the night in an 
attempt to force the blaze toward the ocean, where they hoped to contain it 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The fire blackened about 90 acres of the Santa Monica Mountains National 
Recreation Area, and charred about 1,500 acres in Point Mugu State Park. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to three park campgrounds -- Camp Hess Kramer, Danielson Ranch and 
Thorn Hill Broom Beach -- were evacuated, as were 1,500 campers at Leo Carrillo 
State Beach in Malibu, although authorities said the Leo Carrillo property, 
which was several miles from the fire, was evacuated only as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
At Camp Hess Kramer, 110 youngsters and 20 counselors from two San Fernando 
Valley synagogues were getting out of bed when Ventura County fire officials 
arrived to evacuate them. "There were a lot of kids crying and running around," 
said counselor Neal Kavalsky. "I had one kid who was scared out of his mind. It 
took four or five of us to calm him down." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Point Mugu fire, brush fires also broke out Sunday in 
Moorpark, Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley, also in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The Simi Valley fire, which was reported at 4:30 a.m., destroyed 375 acres in 
the Black Canyon-Box Canyon area. No homes or structures were damaged, and that 
fire, which broke out about the same time as the Point Mugu blaze, was 
extinguished shortly after noon. 
</P>
<P>
The Moorpark blaze, which scorched 20 acres and destroyed one building, was 
reported shortly before sundown and contained by 7 p.m. The Thousand Oaks fire, 
which broke out in the Bard Lake area, charred 50 acres and also was contained 
by 7 p.m., officials said. The causes of all three blazes were under 
investigation.

BITTERSWEET BOYHOOD MEMORIES SHARPEN THE SENSE OF LOSS IN SANTA CRUZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
SANTA CRUZ 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was the place where I got my first baseball mitt. Johnny's Bike and Sports 
Shop. I remember that fresh smell of leather and pounding my fist into the 
pocket of the glove that would carry me through so many seasons. Most boys have 
experienced such a moment. 
</P>
<P>
I had returned to Santa Cruz, two decades later. But this was no happy 
homecoming. The Quake of '89 had rattled and rolled through the mountains north 
of town, mercilessly bearing down on Santa Cruz and whipping it about like some 
tourist on an amusement park ride at the city's seaside Boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
A notebook thrust in my back pocket, I wandered the grid of streets, agog at 
the tattered buildings. It was like grieving at the bedside of a sick old 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny's had not fared particularly well. The silent storefront had been 
boarded up, sheets of plywood covering windows once crowded with bikes and 
baseball bats. A deep, ugly scar zigzagged down from the roof line. 
</P>
<P>
I couldn't see in, but I could imagine the tumult inside -- toppled shoe boxes 
and clothing racks littering the floor, the stuffed elk and moose heads shaken 
from their perches on the wall. Johnny's stands at the entry to the Pacific 
Garden Mall, the four-block strip of red-tiled walkways and mom-and-pop 
boutiques that over the years had become the social and cultural hub of Santa 
Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the mall is abuzz with activity -- a Bohemian bazaar of folk singers 
and jugglers, stoned street people and round-eyed tourists. Any day of the 
week, college students in Birkenstock sandals and wool sweaters would rub 
elbows with local residents in tweed coats or '60s refugees in ponchos, long 
hair tied by bandannas. 
</P>
<P>
The mall was still now, shut off to the outside world. Chain-link fences 
circled the perimeter to keep the curious away from the crumbling brick walls 
of turn-of-the-century buildings walloped by the quake. Those tumbling bricks 
had already claimed several lives, including that of a 22-year-old woman caught 
in the collapse of the coffee shop where she worked. 
</P>
<P>
But the curious still came, lured by the tragic newspaper and TV tales of death 
and destruction on a few familiar blocks. The mall, Johnny's and the other 
stores, had become a kind of inglorious attraction in a town that has been a 
tourist favorite since the 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
I fell in step with the rest, circling around the fortress of chain-link to 
tour the mall from side streets. 
</P>
<P>
Memories crept forth with each crumpled building I passed. As a kid, I'd have a 
hamburger and shake with my parents at the Bubble Bakery or purchase a pack of 
gum from United Cigar. During teen-age days, I headed to the mall for my 
Christmas shopping or to buy the latest Doobie Brothers album at Odyssey 
Records. Or to just look, to watch the people. To grow up. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives had told me the Cooper House -- a former city courthouse made over to 
house a dozen shops and an alfresco restaurant -- had survived the quake 
unscathed. It was one of many rumors that proved incorrect. Peering down one 
street, I caught sight of the proud old building and froze. An exterior wall 
had fallen away from the second floor up. One of the trademark dormers jutting 
out from the pitched roof had collapsed inward. 
</P>
<P>
Later, I talked to the city's mayor, Mardi Wormhoudt. She confidently predicted 
that the city and the mall would bounce back. Plans already were in the works 
to erect tents near the devastation so the merchants could continue to conduct 
business as the all-important Christmas shopping season nears. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the mayor worried that some of the businesses, already struggling as it 
is, might not make it. And the buildings they leased might not survive, either. 
Though many of the historical structures can be saved, it will come at a price. 
Some of the landlords, Wormhoudt guessed, might choose to bring in the 
bulldozers and start from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
Back in my rented car, I drove slowly past the signature Victorians that 
straddle the streets around the old downtown core. Most seemed to be in fine 
shape, but I wondered about the unseen damage -- cracked foundations, shattered 
lath-and-plaster walls. 
</P>
<P>
Down by the half-moon main beach where the Boardwalk reclines like a sleepy 
sunbather, I spotted the Giant Dipper, the serpentine roller coaster that has 
ruled the city's shoreline for more than half a century. The massive framework 
of sturdy timbers remained intact. The Dipper, that heart-pumping ride I had 
feared so much as a child, would be around to thrill future generations. 
</P>
<P>
Heading up Graham Hill Road, I passed the homes of boyhood friends. All seemed 
fine, much like the sturdy wood-frame house where I grew up. My parents lost a 
few glasses that fell from a cupboard, but that was it. Some of the fallen 
glasses didn't even break. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone was so lucky. Pulling into our street, I glanced at Mrs. Olsen's 
house. As a kid, one of my first jobs was gardening for this kind old woman. 
Now her home looked a shambles, a spray of bricks from the toppled chimney 
littering the shake-shingle roof. Mrs. Olsen hadn't taken this earthquake 
business so well, my father informed me, but the neighbors would help. 
</P>
<P>
No, not everyone was so lucky. Ten miles away, up the winding road to the Loch 
Lomand Reservoir, many of the rural homes amid the redwood trees had been 
wrenched off their foundations and spun down the hillside. In my youth, I had 
passed these houses time and again on the way to the reservoir with Dad for 
some trout fishing. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning I went down to Bonny Doon Beach, a crescent of sand flowing 
out from towering shale cliffs seven miles north of Santa Cruz. It was raining 
and work crews were picking through a 20-foot-tall pile of rubble left by a 
landslide they believed had buried Gary West, a 41-year-old waiter. 
</P>

West's sister and her husband were there in raincoats. She hoped West had 
somehow managed to slip back into a sea cave before the rock slide could have 
caught him. I waited 90 minutes to find out. 
</P>
<P>
The sheets of rain thickened, and I gave up. I learned a few hours later that 
the crews had discovered West's battered body near the foot of the cliff. 
</P>
<P>
That night I returned to Southern California. As I left, the work crews were 
busy cleaning up the mall and other sites of devastation. Civic resurrection 
was already well under way. But I felt hollow, for so many reasons. Even when 
new buildings rise, Santa Cruz would never be quite the same.

<P>
A Soviet Communist Party official said Sunday that Hungary may quit the 
Moscow-led Warsaw Pact if it chooses to do so, a development that the State 
Department's top Europe expert called "welcome news, if it is correct, but that 
is not what the Soviet government has been saying." 
</P>
<P>
Nikolai V. Shishlin, a spokesman for the Central Committee of the Soviet 
Communist Party, said that Moscow "will respect the Hungarian choice" 
concerning continuing membership in the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet-controlled East 
European military alliance. But Shishlin said that the Budapest government has 
said it intends to remain in the pact at least for the time being, despite the 
decision of the Hungarian Communist Party to reorganize itself as a democratic 
socialist party in a multi-party state. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond R. Seitz, assistant secretary of state for European affairs, expressed 
surprise at Shishlin's remarks, which he said are at odds with what the Soviet 
government has been saying. But he said events in Eastern Europe are moving so 
fast that all previous assumptions now must be questioned. It is even 
conceivable, he said, that the Warsaw Pact might disintegrate. 
</P>
<P>
However, Seitz suggested no new Western response to changes in Eastern Europe. 
He said that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization must remain intact, even if 
its Communist rival disbands, because NATO "has an important political role" in 
addition to its status as a military alliance. 
</P>
<P>
In a related interview on the CBS-TV program "Face the Nation," Yevgeny M. 
Primakov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet, the national legislature, said any 
member of the Warsaw Pact is free to leave the East Bloc military alliance. 
Without specifically mentioning Hungary, Primakov said that "every country, 
every state and every people have the right of choice." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Seitz's expression of surprise, this was not the Soviets' first 
reference to the possibility of increased independence within the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has on several occasions made references 
to non-interference in the affairs of the East Bloc. Only last Wednesday, 
during his visit to Finland, Gorbachev declared: "We have no right, moral or 
political right, to interfere (in Eastern Europe). We assume others will not 
interfere, either." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's foreign minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, has said that every 
member of the Warsaw Pact has the right to formulate its own foreign policy, a 
position affirmed by the pact members themselves at a recent meeting. And some 
of Gorbachev's senior advisers have speculated publicly that Hungary might in 
fact decide to quit the military alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Shishlin also said that the division of Germany "should be changed, and it will 
be changed," although he did not predict when. However, he said, Moscow objects 
to the West German policy of refusing to acknowledge a separate East German 
citizenship because it believes East Germany "is a normal state" that is 
entitled to all aspects of sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
Seitz said that the United States has supported German reunification for years, 
but "everyone recognizes that we have to be very careful" in dealing with the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
The exchange between Shishlin and Seitz, interviewed separately on the ABC-TV 
program "This Week With David Brinkley," dramatizes the Bush Administration's 
caution in reacting to the upheaval in Eastern Europe. The U.S. government has 
been hectoring the Soviet Union and its satellites to move toward multi-party 
democracy and free-market economics for more than 40 years. But the 
Administration now seems to be uncertain how to respond when Hungary and 
Poland, at least, appear to be moving in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory F. Treverton, a fellow in European Studies of the Council on Foreign 
Relations in New York, said that the Administration seems to be dominated by 
"congenital pessimists" who are unwilling to move forcefully to address events 
that could be nurtured into major ideological victory for Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"The only compelling argument I can come up with for why the Administration is 
playing it so coolly is that none of us know where we are going, so things can 
turn out bad as well as good," he said in a recent telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
When President Bush visited Eastern Europe last July, he announced an aid 
package of $119 million for Poland and $31 million for Hungary. But, responding 
to Democrats' complaints that the aid was too little, Bush increased his 
proposal in stages to a total of about $452 million. Congressional Democrats 
are supporting an aid plan almost twice that large. 
</P>
<P>
But, despite the seeming bipartisan agreement on the need for substantial U.S. 
support for democratization and economic reform, the Poland-Hungary bill is 
bogged down in the Senate in a domestic political battle that has nothing to do 
with foreign policy. Republican lawmakers have attached Bush's cherished 
capital gains tax cut plan to the bill, touching off a Democratic filibuster. 
There is no indication when the lawmakers might act on the aid program. 
</P>
<P>
In remarks Sunday on the NBC-TV program "Meet the Press," Sen. George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.), the majority leader, declared, "Obviously, capital gains has 
nothing to do with aid to Poland and Hungary, and I hope very much we will be 
able to proceed with what President Bush has said is a high priority for him -- 
aid to Poland and Hungary." 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed on the same program, Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), the minority leader, 
complained that the Democrats are trying to double the Administration program. 
"That's how Democrats help; they always double everything." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), interviewed on "Face the Nation," said that the 
Administration's approach to Eastern Europe is "timid." He said that linking 
the Poland and Hungary aid package to the capital gains tax plan "demeans our 
effort to promote democracy in Eastern Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, interviewed on Cable News Network's 
Evans and Novak program, said that the Administration wants to avoid "a bidding 
war" over aid to Poland and Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a matter of just escalating the amount of money we throw over there," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, critics maintain that Bush, by tripling his own proposal in just three 
months, has opened himself to suggestions that the figures are just pulled out 
of the air. 
</P>
<P>
Experts on the economic situation in Eastern Europe maintain that both Poland 
and Hungary need private capital -- in the form of joint ventures -- more than 
government-to-government aid. But these specialists say that substantial 
governmental assistance is needed as well, primarily to cushion the shock of 
conversion to free-market economics. 
</P>
<P>
"You do have a shock on the economic system when you go from a controlled 
economy to a free system," U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Richard Lesher 
said recently. "There is usually a decline in real wages, which will make 
people say, 'We thought the market would make things better, but they are 
worse.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, a large amount of Western aid was poured into Poland in the form 
of loans that were not used efficiently. As a result, the country wasted the 
money and was left saddled with debt. This time, however, both Poland and 
Hungary agree that Western aid should be tied to specific economic reform 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
A staff economist for the Senate-House Economic Committee said that both Poland 
and Hungary can absorb substantial aid programs. The question, he said, is not 
the amount but whether the aid is tailored to projects that will end the 
emphasis on heavy industry left over from the Stalinist era. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, there are limits to U.S. capacity to help other nations, but what 
is happening is not only of great historical significance, but these countries 
are in a large sense responding to U.S. policy pronouncements and pressures 
over decades," the economist said. "Now that these countries are moving in the 
direction the United States has urged them to go, there is a sense that the 
United States ought to be a little more forthcoming to encourage these new 
movements."

A passenger train crashed into two parked locomotives in western Mexico, 
killing one person and injuring about 100 people, officials said. A doctor 
confirmed the death of the train's engineer and said its fireman was seriously 
injured. The train, which crashed near the small town of Aguacatlan in the 
western state of Nayarit, was on its way from the Pacific beach resort of 
Mazatlan to Guadalajara. Local news reports said the accident may have been 
caused by faulty rail switching. There was no word on how many passengers were 
on board at the time. Authorities said they were investigating.

Thirteen more rebel rockets slammed into Kabul, killing four people and 
wounding 14, in a continuation of a weekend attack that diplomats called one of 
the biggest assaults since Soviet troops pulled out in February. At least 22 
missiles slammed into the capital Saturday, killing 12 people. Outside the 
city, moujahedeen rebels kept up their blockade of the vital Salang highway in 
an effort to starve the Afghan capital of food and fuel. The threat of ambush 
has stalled a convoy of more than 1,000 trucks from moving toward Kabul.

A makeshift Muslim prayer hall in a small southeastern French town has been 
attacked and strewn with pieces of pork, a meat forbidden by Islam, just two 
months after the demolition of the local mosque outraged France's 3 million 
Muslims. The mosque in Charvieu-Chavagneux was bulldozed in mid-August during 
morning prayers, a move that brought accusations of racism against right-wing 
Mayor Gerard Dezempte. Dezempte said at the time that the mosque, a condemned 
building, was accidentally destroyed.

JET CRASHES ON CARRIER; FIVE KILLED

A jet trainer crashed Sunday on the flight deck of the aircraft carrier 
Lexington in the Gulf of Mexico, killing five people, injuring at least two and 
damaging several aircraft, the Navy said. 
</P>
<P>
The crash of the two-seat T-2 Buckeye caused several fires on the World War 
II-era ship that sailors quickly brought under control, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. Dennis Hessler, spokesman for the chief of naval education and training 
at Pensacola, said he did not know whether the plane was taking off or landing 
at the time of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear how many people were aboard the jet. 
</P>
<P>
The crash also did major damage to two aircraft on the flight deck and minor 
damage to another, a Pentagon spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lexington, the Navy's oldest aircraft carrier, was 17 miles south of its 
home port of Pensacola when the accident occurred, Coast Guard Lt. Mark Kasper 
said in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
The jet was assigned to Training Squadron 19, based at the Meridian, Miss., 
Naval Air Station, the Navy said. The victims' identities were being withheld 
pending notification of next of kin. 
</P>
<P>
Navy helicopters took the injured to hospitals, Kasper said. A burn victim was 
taken to the University of South Alabama Medical Center in Mobile. 
</P>
<P>
Kasper said that the Coast Guard sent a jet from Mobile to fly a team of 
ordnance experts in Panama City to Pensacola because the Navy apparently was 
concerned that fuel cells aboard the jet might explode after being damaged in 
the crash. 
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old Lexington is the only aircraft carrier used by the Navy 
exclusively for training.

DOLE SAYS HE WOULD SUPPORT GAS TAX HIKE

Senate Republican leader Bob Dole said Sunday that he would support a rise in 
gasoline taxes to rebuild America's roads and bridges, including those damaged 
by the Bay Area earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The Kansas lawmaker said that the American people "would understand, not only 
in earthquake areas, but all across America," the need for such a tax. 
</P>
<P>
But he said that he would oppose using the increased revenues as a way to cut 
the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Dole's suggestion, during an interview on NBC's "Meet the Press," could open 
the way for new bipartisan efforts to raise government revenues despite 
President Bush's rejection of a tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Dole and Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) agreed that 
everything should be "on the table" in negotiations on fiscal 1991 federal 
spending -- including taxes and curbs on entitlements, such as Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
While he opposed raising income tax rates, Dole said, "there are a lot of 
loopholes just begging to be closed out there. . . . That's billions of 
dollars." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Dole has favored an oil-import fee and certain taxes earmarked for 
specific needs, but Sunday marked the first time he had mentioned an increase 
in the gasoline tax publicly, spokesman Paul E. Jacobson said later. 
</P>
<P>
The senator said that he did not know how Bush would react, but added: "That's 
not a major tax increase." 
</P>
<P>
David P. Prosperi, a Department of Transportation spokesman, said Secretary 
Samuel K. Skinner had backed the President's opposition to any new federal 
taxes, including an increase in the gasoline tax.

Five District of Columbia residents, including a 13-year-old girl, were killed 
within seven hours during a night of violence that ended just before dawn 
Sunday, police reported. 
</P>
<P>
The killings pushed the city's homicide toll to 369, equal to last year's 
record. They occurred in four separate incidents in different sections of the 
city, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Although police initially had reported 372 killings in the city during 1988, 
they later revised the total, saying that three of the incidents had been 
classified as justifiable homicides. The victims in those incidents were killed 
by residents or police acting in self-defense, said Lt. Reginald L. Smith, a 
police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Among the nation's largest cities, Washington had the highest per-capita murder 
rate in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In a double slaying that marked the latest of the killings early Sunday, Brenda 
R. Sams, 34, and her 13-year-old niece, Keaena Sams, were stabbed to death in 
Brenda Sams' apartment, police said. Late Sunday, officials said, Steve Lewis 
Patton, 24, described as Sams' boyfriend, was charged with two counts of 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
Police provided only sketchy information about the other three killings, 
including one involving a man found with thousands of dollars in cash and a 
supply of heroin. 
</P>
<P>
About 2 a.m. Sunday, police said, William Lawrence Broome, 41, died of multiple 
gunshot wounds. About $11,000 in cash and a large quantity of heroin were found 
in Broome's clothing, police said.

HOSPITAL USES RENOVATIONS, ADVERTISING IN FIGHT FOR LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH CARE: BURBANK COMMUNITY HOSPITAL FACES A DECLINE IN PATIENTS AND A 
PROJECTED $1-MILLION LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Burbank Community Hospital, whose image was tarnished when a county 
investigation turned up serious health-care deficiencies in 1987, could be 
closed or sold if major renovations and a public relations campaign do not stem 
a steady decline of patients over the past four years, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital Administrator William Daniel said the $300,000 in improvements, which 
include painting the entire hospital as well as installing new carpeting and 
furniture, are crucial to attract more patients. Hospital records show that the 
average daily number of patients visiting the 103-bed facility has dropped from 
48 in 1984 to 33 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a break-even point at 35 or 36 patients," Daniel said. "But over time, 
that's not good enough for this hospital to really make it. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can't re-establish an economic relationship with the community, then we 
have to look at the predictable set of options," which could include closing 
the facility or selling it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal here is to make this as physically accommodating and comfortable as 
any hospital," Daniel said. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank Community Hospital, which is run by a nonprofit foundation and has an 
annual operating budget of $12 million, lost $1.3 million in 1988 and is 
expected to lose about $1 million this year, Daniel said. The hospital has been 
forced to dip into its cash reserves, about $2.5 million, to keep itself going 
and to pay for the renovation. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Shoaf, vice president of the hospital's board of trustees, said the 
hospital had no choice but to upgrade. "Our decision was to make improvements 
to allow us to be more profitable in the future, to be the quality institution 
we need to be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel said several factors are responsible for the decline in patients: poor 
planning by the hospital, a recent increase in outpatient services throughout 
the health-care industry, the proximity of the massive and better equipped St. 
Joseph Medical Center and -- eclipsing them all -- the Los Angeles County 
Department of Health Services' investigation, which was brought on by 
complaints of improper and inadequate emergency care of a homeless man. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation began after Robert Parks collapsed outside the hospital on 
Aug. 29, 1987, the day after he had been treated there for lice. Despite 
requests from Burbank police officers, physicians refused to readmit Parks, 
saying he had been properly treated. 
</P>
<P>
Parks was taken to County-USC Medical Center, where doctors said he was 
suffering from malnutrition, anemia, dehydration and alcoholic withdrawal. He 
was treated and released several days later. 
</P>
<P>
The county's investigation determined that Burbank Community Hospital had 
failed to assure that authorized and trained personnel were assigned to the 
emergency room. It revealed more than 20 deficiencies in administrative 
procedure, emergency treatment and health-care monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
When a preliminary plan to correct the deficiencies was rejected as inadequate, 
federal health officials warned that the hospital's Medicare status would be 
revoked unless conditions improved. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital's director, Jurral Rhee, submitted a revised correction plan that 
was accepted by county officials. The plan established an intense monitoring 
program by department heads, administrators and the board of directors to 
prevent further deficiencies in medical care and staffing. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Burbank Community Hospital began arranging for transportation and 
shelter for indigent patients when they were discharged. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the hospital's troubles were not over. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1988, Rhee, who had served as the hospital's chief administrator for 
five years, was forced to resign under pressure from hospital physicians who 
were unhappy with his performance. The physicians said Rhee's attempts at 
cutting hospital costs had damaged patient services and compromised the quality 
of health care at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
"They really had some hard times, more than I realized," said Daniel, who was 
an associate administrator at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for nine years before 
taking over Burbank Community Hospital in November, 1988. "This was a very 
dysfunctional hospital." 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, Daniel has overseen a number of improvements at the facility, 
including an increase in the number of full-time registered nurses from 27 to 
46, the hiring of a new senior-management staff and the purchase of $1 million 
in new medical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The result was that Burbank Community Hospital was inspected in March and 
received a clean bill of health from county and federal health officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen any complaints come through on Burbank," said David Childress, 
supervisor of the county health department's enforcement and surveillance unit. 
"Apparently they've cleaned up their act." 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Barnhart, sections chief with the Federal Health Care and Financing 
Administration, which investigates complaints from Medicare patients, said her 
agency has not received any complaints about Burbank Community Hospital since 
the county's investigation two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these improvements, hospital officials say, their biggest challenge is 
changing the public's perception of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a tremendous improvement, without a doubt," said Dr. Bernard 
Cooke, chief of the hospital's medical staff. "But it's difficult to get the 
public to understand that things have changed." 
</P>
<P>
It is equally difficult, Cooke said, to convince some doctors. 
</P>
<P>
"The attitude of the physicians has improved, but not as much as I had hoped," 
he said. "They're still kind of skeptical because of prior experiences." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to change that skepticism, hospital officials launched a 
public-relations campaign in September to promote improvements at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
A slick new hospital brochure recently mailed to more than 40,000 Burbank 
residents advertises Burbank Community Hospital as a facility with a "new look, 
new ideas" and new, state-of-the-art medical equipment. The hospital also has 
been taking out advertisements in local newspapers promoting the facility's 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to do is give the community an update," Daniel said. "We 
want to acknowledge that we've had some difficulties. At the same time, we want 
people to know what advances we've made." 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials are planning an open house on Nov. 18 to show off the 
renovated facility. Melanie Landman, a hospital spokeswoman, said that as part 
of the open house, the hospital will offer free blood-pressure and cholesterol 
screenings. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the hospital is participating in a joint survey with St. Joseph 
Medical Center to determine how the two hospitals might work together in the 
future, Daniel said. The survey's results are not expected until the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Daniel said, Burbank Community Hospital must find a way to 
distinguish itself from St. Joseph and other large hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
"What we want is for people to think of us as having a distinct ability to 
provide personal service," Daniel said. "Our aim is not to be a giant hospital 
. . . but to be a good small hospital."

A man jumped to his death from a rail overpass onto the Santa Ana Freeway in 
Anaheim about 8 a.m. this morning, forcing closure of all northbound lanes and 
backing up traffic five miles in both directions, Anaheim police said. 
</P>
<P>
Coroner's officials said the man -- an apparent suicide -- was struck by 
several vehicles and was so badly mutilated that his identity could not be 
immediately determined. All northbound lanes were closed much of the morning, 
with traffic being diverted off the freeway at South Street and returned at 
Lincoln Avenue.

A truck dumped 20 tons of gravel on the San Fernando Freeway in Simi Valley 
today, causing the closure of two westbound lanes and a slow morning commute 
for some motorists, the California Highway Patrol said. There were no injuries 
in the 6 a.m. accident, which occurred near Tapo Street, said CHP Officer Jim 
Utter. 
</P>
<P>
The gravel was dumped when the bottom doors on a tractor-trailer rig apparently 
came open, Utter said. The gravel spilled across all three westbound lanes, but 
only two lanes were closed during the cleanup, which lasted more than an hour. 
Utter said that traffic was slowed but that the backup was minimal because most 
morning rush-hour traffic in the area is eastbound.

Three wind-whipped brush fires that burned about 40 acres in Moorpark were 
completely contained by firefighters before any structures were damaged, the 
Ventura County Fire Department reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The first fire, which burned 20 acres Sunday afternoon near Valley Road and 
Everett Street, was contained about 5 p.m., dispatch supervisor Sam Meier said. 
Several nearby homes escaped damage. 
</P>
<P>
About three hours later, a small fire was reported to the east near California 
23, but it was quickly extinguished after less than an acre burned, Meier said. 
Then at 8:30 p.m., a flare-up near Nogales and Los Angeles avenues briefly 
threatened homes and burned 20 acres of brush before being extinguished, Meier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Causes of the fires was still under investigation.

BEGIN SAYS JEWS CAN'T FORGIVE BRITAIN

Former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin today said Jews will always be 
bitter at Britain for barring millions of them from what he termed their 
fatherland. 
</P>
<P>
Begin, 76 and now a recluse, wrote a letter to mark Thursday's anniversary of 
the 1917 Balfour Declaration. 
</P>
<P>
The document, drawn up by then British Foreign Secretary Arthur James Balfour, 
declared British support for setting up a national homeland for the Jews in 
Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
"The Balfour Declaration, no doubt, was a turning point in the history of the 
Jewish people. The document was published for different reasons but over the 
years the British distorted its contents," Begin wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Britain, which ruled Palestine until Israel's creation in 1948, interpreted the 
declaration so restrictively that millions of Jews could not realize their 
dreams of settling there, Begin said. Many were trying to flee the Nazi 
Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
Begin, a fiery guerrilla fighter during the last years of the British mandate, 
wrote: "The past kindness of the British, which we shall remember and be 
grateful for, is that they published the Balfour Declaration of 1917. 
</P>
<P>
"But we won't overlook the bitterness that resulted for the Jewish people from 
the distortion of its contents in the days when millions of Jews cried out for 
the fulfillment of the promise, and they cried out in vain. 
</P>
<P>
"To our sorrow, relations developed this way with Great Britain, and we have to 
remember the good in their original intentions as well as the harshness of the 
closure of the gates to our fatherland." 
</P>
<P>
Begin's letter, to a Balfour Day symposium at Israel's Haifa University, was 
made public by his personal secretary, Yehiel Kadishai. 
</P>
<P>
Begin led the underground Irgun Zvai Leumi in anti-British guerrilla 
operations, including the bombing of Jerusalem's King David Hotel, headquarters 
of the military command, which killed 80 people.

REAGAN OKD PLEA BARGAIN FOR MARCOSES, LAWYER SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
THEY WERE INDICTED 3 DAYS LATER

Then-President Ronald Reagan personally approved a plea bargain offered to 
Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos three days before they were indicted in October, 
1988, Imelda Marcos' attorney says in court papers obtained today. 
</P>
<P>
The papers add detail to reported failed negotiations just before the deposed 
Philippine leader and his wife were charged with siphoning more than $100 
million out of their country's treasury and into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos died Sept. 28. His wife awaits trial in U.S. District Court in 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Marcos' lawyer, Richard A. Hibey, said in the papers filed last month that 
government lawyers made the plea offer during a meeting at the Justice 
Department in Washington attended briefly by U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh. 
</P>
<P>
"The attorney general started the meeting by advising us that the President was 
aware that the meeting was taking place, and what would be conveyed to us 
during the conference had the President's full knowledge and approval," Hibey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
While the personal attention of a President in a criminal case is unusual, 
White House involvement can be expected in sensitive matters that carry 
implications for U.S. foreign policy, government spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not usual for the White House to be involved in the conduct of cases. 
It's not usual for the attorney general to be involved in the handling of 
criminal cases," David R. Runkel, Justice Department spokesman, said today. 
"But there are those times when issues do rise to the level of the attorney 
general or the White House." 
</P>
<P>
Marcos, who died Sept. 28, and his wife were charged in a racketeering 
indictment Oct. 21, 1988, three days after the meeting described by Hibey. 
</P>
<P>
The trial of Imelda Marcos and her other co-defendants, including Saudi 
financier Adnan Khashoggi, is scheduled to begin March 14. 
</P>
<P>
Hibey's account of the meeting said Thornburgh left after telling Hibey and 
another Marcos attorney, John Bartko, that the other government officials at 
the meeting were the "sole representatives" of the government in the matter and 
urging them to consider the offer seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The representatives were Mark Richard, a Justice Department official, then-U.S. 
Atty. Rudolph W. Giuliani and Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles LaBella, he said. 
LaBella is prosecuting the case. 
</P>
<P>
After Thornburgh's departure, Giuliani described a "non-negotiable proposal 
with respect to the disposition of proposed charges against our clients which 
the government intended to present to the grand jury in the Southern District 
of New York . . . ," Hibey said. 
</P>
<P>
Giuliani said he would bring the indictment unless the Marcoses agreed to his 
proposal by the end of the business day of Oct. 20, 1988, according to Hibey. 
He did not provide any details of the government's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Published reports at the time of the indictment, citing unidentified sources, 
said the offer called for Marcos to forfeit millions of dollars worth of real 
estate, artwork and jewelry in return for a recommendation that he be spared a 
prison sentence.

Former President Ronald Reagan telephoned President Bush on Sunday to report on 
his $2-million trip to Japan and his talks with high-ranking leaders, a White 
House spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan also discussed his observations on 
his weeklong trip with Secretary of State James A. Baker III. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater was unable to say whether Bush and Reagan had discussed the 
controversial aspects of Reagan's journey to Japan. The former President was 
criticized in some quarters for accepting $2 million for two 20-minute speeches 
in Japan. But Nancy Reagan earlier defended the commitment, claiming that 
Japanese business groups sponsoring the trip were getting "two-fers," which 
included appearances by both Reagans. 
</P>
<P>
The former President also was criticized for praising Sony's takeover of 
Columbia Pictures, claiming the Japanese firm would make more moral and decent 
films than Hollywood. He also apparently will receive $1 million from Sony for 
his presidential library.

THATCHER AT NEW LOW IN OPINION POLL; 
</P>
<P>
GREAT BRITAIN: THE FUROR OVER THE TOP TREASURY OFFICIAL'S RESIGNATION HEIGHTENS 
CRITICISM OF THE PRIME MINISTER'S LEADERSHIP STYLE.

<P>
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, her government rocked by the resignation of 
her top treasury official, sank today to the worst ratings of her decade in 
power. 
</P>
<P>
One sounding showed her the most unpopular leader since polling began here. 
</P>
<P>
"She cannot afford many more mishaps," said Norman Tebbit, former chairman of 
the governing Conservative Party who helped mastermind Thatcher's third 
successive election victory in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In a National Opinion Poll sounding, Thatcher hit the lowest popularity rating 
for any prime minister since polling started in Britain 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Only 24% of a sample of 935 voters questioned said they were satisfied with her 
performance and 61% blamed her for Thursday's sudden resignation of Chancellor 
of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. 
</P>
<P>
He said he could not continue in the 22-member Cabinet so long as Thatcher 
retained a personal economic adviser, Sir Alan Walters, who opposes having 
Britain fully join the European Monetary System that links key European 
currencies. Walters then also resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher is lukewarm toward membership of the system's currency-stabilizing 
exchange rate mechanism while Lawson and Deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey Howe 
favor it. She fired Howe as foreign secretary last June. 
</P>
<P>
Tebbit, one of Thatcher's closest political associates, described the latest 
forced Cabinet shuffle as "an appalling political muddle.' 
</P>
<P>
"She should remember it is dangerous for a captain to appear semidetached from 
the team," Tebbit wrote in London's Evening Standard. 
</P>
<P>
The furor has heightened criticism of Thatcher's style as bossy, hectoring and 
intolerant of opposing views in the Cabinet. 
</P>

Thatcher already held the unpopularity record when she scored a 25% satisfied

Labor Party Prime Minister Harold Wilson held the previous unpopularity record

The National Opinion Poll showed 62% of those questioned said they were

A Harris Poll for the BBC-TV current affairs program "Panorama" being screened

The highest level U.S.-Vietnam talks in two years concluded today with 
agreement to expand efforts to resolve the fates of American servicemen missing 
in Vietnam, Radio Hanoi reported. 
</P>
<P>
The radio said Gen. John W. Vessey, the U.S. presidential envoy, met Deputy 
Prime Minister Nguyen Co Thach for "constructive" talks that included plans to 
resettle former Vietnamese re-education camp prisoners in the United States and 
the situation in Cambodia -- the last obstacle to improved U.S.-Vietnamese 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
The talks were the highest level official contacts between the two former foes 
since Vessey's trip to Hanoi in 1987 when the two sides agreed to improve 
cooperation on Americans missing in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
There are 1,698 Americans listed as missing in Vietnam. For at least 70 of 
those, the United States believes there is credible evidence the men may have 
survived to become prisoners of war. Vietnam has denied having any prisoners.

An investor group has offered to buy the Detroit Free Press for $68 million as 
lawyers prepared for oral arguments in the U.S. Supreme Court in a case 
involving a joint operating agreement with the Detroit News. 
</P>
<P>
William D. McMaster, head of the Michigan Investor Group, made the bid to buy 
the Free Press in a letter Sunday to James K. Batten, president of 
Knight-Ridder Inc., which owns the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"The Michigan Investor Group, if successful in purchasing the Free Press, will 
continue the 158-year-old Detroit Free Press as an ongoing enterprise and will 
convert the editorial format to a 'statewide community newspaper,' " McMaster 
said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of the two newspapers, Gannett Co. Inc. and Knight-Ridder, have said 
the joint operating agreement would trigger layoffs and a price increase. 
Knight-Ridder has said it will sell the Free Press or close it if the agreement 
is denied.

WHITE HOUSE REJECTS CALL FOR GAS TAX HIKE; 
</P>
<P>
BUSH ADMINISTRATION: THE PRESIDENT ALSO IS NOT EASING HIS OPPOSITION TO 
DEMOCRATS' FORMULA FOR RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE, AN AIDE SAYS.

<P>
The White House today rejected a Republican leader's call for higher taxes on 
gasoline and also said President Bush was not easing his opposition to the 
Democrats' formula for raising the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not feel that an increase in federal gas taxes is necessary at this 
time," said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said Sunday that although he still 
supports Bush's "no new taxes" pledge, he would back a gasoline tax increase to 
rebuild the U.S. infrastructure -- such as roads, bridges and other public 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dole said he would not back a gas tax hike for deficit reduction. 
</P>
<P>
On the minimum wage, Fitzwater said, "We are not changing our position at this 
point" although he noted that White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu has 
been conferring on the issue with House leaders. 
</P>
<P>
House Democrats are casting the minimum wage issue as a poor versus rich matter 
that, along with his demand for a capital gains tax cut, leaves the President's 
allies a bit nervous. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue has been greatly simplified, at least for a great many of us," said 
Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.), referring to a new scaled-back Democratic 
proposal. "It's time to change the minimum wage; $4.25 over the next two years 
(from the current $3.35 an hour) is agreeable to me." 
</P>
<P>
Domenici is among several Republicans and conservative Democrats who last 
summer supported Bush's veto of a proposed increase to $4.55 an hour by 1992 
but who do not want to walk the plank again. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the White House) know that things are moving away from them," said Rep. 
Timothy J. Penny (D-Minn.), one of 28 House Democrats who supported Bush's 
veto. "Everybody wants this to be the last time we have to vote on his bill." 
</P>
<P>
House Democratic leaders have scheduled a vote Wednesday on a bill to raise the 
$3.35 wage floor, which has not changed since 1981, by 45 cents on Jan. 1 and 
by another 45 cents an hour in January, 1991, to $4.25. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Democrats this week also will keep trying to prevent Republicans from 
attaching a capital gains tax cut to legislation providing a three-year aid 
package for Poland and Hungary or to a bill raising the ceiling on the federal 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, capital gains has nothing to do with aid to Poland and Hungary," 
Senate Democratic Leader George J. Mitchell of Maine said Sunday on NBC-TV's 
"Meet the Press." "I hope very much that we'll be able to proceed."

AIR CONGESTION SEEN AS BLOCK TO AIRLINE GROWTH

Meeting for the first time in an East Bloc country, the International Air 
Transport Assn. today discussed air congestion and security. 
</P>
<P>
Association Director General Guenter Eser said the organization's 187 member 
airlines had doubled net profits in 1988 to $1.6 billion from 1987's figure on 
scheduled international services. 
</P>
<P>
But he said increasing congestion in the skies might soon halt the speedy 
development of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
The association had identified 35 European airports as being "very congested," 
especially in Spain, Italy and Greece. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of the marketplace deciding the course of the industry, operational 
constraints will determine who flies where and when," Eser said. He added that 
only concerted action by European governments could help to find a solution. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to pass resolutions on congestion and air security. 
</P>
<P>
Some airlines had complained that governments made excessive demands on the 
carriers' security services after the bombing of a Pan Am airliner over 
Scotland in December that killed 270 people, Eser said.

Edmonton's Jimmy Carson -- the Los Angeles Kings player who was traded, along 
with $15 million -- for Wayne Gretzky, may be dealt again, this time to the 
Detroit Red Wings, a newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The clubs are close to a trade that would send Carson and another Oilers player 
to Detroit in exchange for Petr Klima, Joe Murphy and Adam Graves, the Detroit 
Free Press reported in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said it learned of the deal from two sources it did not name, one 
with the Red Wings and one close to Carson, 21, whose family lives in a Detroit 
suburb. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Wings had no comment on the report, spokesman Bill Jamieson said this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever happens, happens," said Carson, who walked out on the Oilers two 
weeks ago after demanding to be traded. He had a goal and two assists in four 
games this season with Edmonton and had 49 goals and 51 assists last season, 
his first with the Oilers after a trade that sent Gretzky, the NHL's all-time 
scoring leader, to the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Klima said he will refuse to report to Edmonton if traded there.

Fennis Dembo, who watched mainly from the bench as Detroit won its first NBA 
championship, has been cut by the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-6 Dembo, who played guard and small forward, was released late 
Saturday after Detroit failed to negotiate a trade for the second-year player. 
Dembo's release left Detroit with 14 players on its roster, with two final cuts 
expected by midweek, Coach Chuck Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
Dembo was Detroit's first pick and 30th overall in the 1988 NBA draft after 
finishing his college career as Wyoming's leading scorer and rebounder. He had 
a total 36 points and 23 rebounds in his rookie season with Detroit, playing 
just 74 minutes in 31 regular-season games.

BACKERS OF PROPOSITION M TAX HIKE OUTNUMBER FOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With only days to go before a countywide vote on a proposed half-cent sales tax 
increase for transportation projects, The Times Orange County Poll shows 
supporters outnumbering opponents by 15% but still lacking a solid majority to 
carry the measure. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone survey of 600 registered voters, 47% said they would vote yes on 
Measure M on Nov. 7, while just 32% said they would vote no -- down 14 points 
from the 46% who said they opposed the tax increase in a previous Times Orange 
County Poll in July. 
</P>
<P>
But while opposition to Measure M has softened, support has remained flat, 
actually dropping a point since July. The percentage of undecided voters, 
however, has jumped from 6% to 21%, according to the poll. 
</P>
<P>
The random-sample poll was conducted by Irvine-based Mark Baldassare &amp; 
Associates from Oct. 23 through Oct. 25. The margin of error is 4% for 
questions involving all 600 people sampled and somewhat larger for questions of 
smaller groups. 
</P>
<P>
Baldassare said the large increase in the number of undecided voters was 
unusual and made the outcome of the election particularly difficult to predict. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, as the vote is getting closer, one would expect that people would 
swing in one direction or another," Baldassare said. "I think it is 
significant, but it doesn't really give us a clue as to how it's going to end 
up." 
</P>
<P>
According to Baldassare, the latest poll shows that there are a "couple of 
critical issues" that are key to the success or failure of Measure M, which 
would increase the sales tax from 6 to 6 1/2%. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue of turnout and the issue of what those undecideds will decide once 
they listen to the arguments . . . whether they believe the money would be 
spent wisely," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how much confidence they had in county government's ability to spend the 
sales tax money wisely, 40% of poll respondents answered that they had "none" 
or "hardly any"; only one in four voters among this group supports the 
half-cent increase. 
</P>
<P>
Just 18% of those surveyed said they had "a great deal" of confidence in county 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most troubling for Measure M proponents are the figures for those 
voters most likely to show up at the polls Nov. 7. Just 33% of voters who are 
"highly likely" to vote -- about 100 of the 600 surveyed -- said they would 
support the measure, while 46% of those opposed it. Voters who are "somewhat 
likely" to go to the polls, however -- a group twice as large as the "highly 
likelies" -- favored the measure by a margin of 52% to 29%. 
</P>
<P>
"The greater the turnout, the more likely this is to pass," Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of Measure M say it will fail at the polls if turnout stays below 
25%. But both sides agree that if turnout approaches 30%, the measure should 
capture the majority of additional voters and would have a good chance of 
passing. 
</P>
<P>
Turnout at off-year elections in Orange County is normally just 10% to 12%, 
county Registrar of Voters Donald F. Tanney said, but he would make no 
prediction on this year's turnout. The presence of a countywide measure on an 
issue as important to voters as transportation will bring more voters to the 
polls, but Tanney said he has no recent precedents to help him make an 
estimate. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed half-cent sales tax increase would raise $3.1 billion for an 
$11.5-billion, 20-year traffic improvement and growth management plan, with the 
remaining $8.4 billion coming from the state and federal government, as well as 
other sources. The creation of a citizen's committee to oversee disbursement of 
the money helped win the support of some traditional opponents of development 
and tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
Without the increase, proponents of the measure say, the county will not be 
able to pay for sorely needed transportation projects such as freeway widening, 
a commuter rail system, more car-pool lanes and so-called "super streets" to 
reduce congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the measure contend that the transportation improvements will only 
foster more growth and that taxes are already high enough. 
</P>
<P>
A proposed one-cent sales tax increase for unspecified transportation projects 
was decisively rejected by Orange County voters in June, 1984. But Baldassare 
said this time around, residents seem to be more inclined to at least consider 
the merits of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in '84 at this time (before Election Day), the movement was toward the 
'No' column. So I think it's quite a different set of circumstances," he said. 
"It's a different kind of plan . . . a very complex package. . . . I think that 
it means that there's been some willingness to listen to what the plan is all 
about and not reject a tax increase outright." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Nestande, a member of the state Transportation Commission and chairman of 
Citizens for Yes on Measure M, said the softening of opposition was a sign that 
the committee's $1.8-million campaign is getting its message out effectively. 
</P>
<P>
"As the campaign moves closer to closure, your noes drift away to undecided and 
then you bring them over to our side," Nestande said. "We have to show a 
cost-benefit assortment of projects that would satisfy the residents. . . . We 
accept the responsibility to do that." 
</P>
<P>
However, Jerry Yudelson, one of the leaders of the No on M committee, 
interpreted the poll results as "a danger sign" for Measure M backers. 
</P>
<P>
"Even with $1.2 million, they haven't been able to go over 50% (supporting the 
measure)," said Yudelson, a Garden Grove businessman. "I think in the last week 
or two, you'll see the pendulum swing back our way." 
</P>
<P>
The measure's opponents are counting on Orange County's traditional aversion to 
taxes and its history of poor turnouts in off-year elections to bring them 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Times Orange County Poll found that almost half the undecided respondents 
-- 44% -- said they would not be willing to pay any new taxes for 
transportation. Another 28% said they would be most willing to support an 
increase in the gasoline tax for road projects. A proposed statewide gasoline 
tax increase will be on the June ballot next year for statewide projects. 
</P>
<P>
But, Baldassare pointed out, M supporters could look with optimism at the fact 
that almost six in 10 of the undecided group said they could support some kind 
of tax or fee for transportation improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"That group could decide the election," Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
One poll respondent who is undecided on the measure said she could support the 
half-cent sales tax if she knew more about how the money would be spent. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of time what they do is use the money for the center dividers, they 
plant trees, flowers and grass," said Chelenne Lunde, 18, of Buena Park. "If it 
goes toward fixing the streets, then I would be for it. . . . But I haven't 
heard much about it." 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim resident Lewis Rose said he was having a hard time making up his mind 
because he had disliked past proposals for tax increases -- particularly 
Proposition A, the one-cent sales tax increase for transportation in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like crying wolf," said Rose, 33. Still, he agreed that solutions had to 
be found to the traffic problems in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Waldene Curtis of El Toro said she supports the measure "because I'm kind of 
fed up with the traffic congestion down here. I'm assuming that it will 
alleviate some of that. . . . What used to take 20 minutes now takes 45 
minutes." 
</P>
<P>
But Curtis said she remains concerned that the transportation projects would 
foster more development and is skeptical about the measure's growth management 
plan. "I'm sure it takes a second seat to the other elements," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the level of frustration over traffic does not appear to be 
closely linked with support for Measure M. 
</P>
<P>
Even among those surveyed who said they were "extremely upset" by driving 
conditions in Orange County, the measure was favored by just 49% -- about the 
same as among respondents who said they were "very upset" or just "moderately 
upset." 
</P>
<P>
The measure's strongest support appeared to be in South County, where it was 
favored by 51% of the poll respondents, compared to 45% in North County. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the measure have said they hope to exploit the geographical 
difference with campaign literature aimed at North County voters that portrays 
Measure M as a boondoggle for South County developers at their expense. 
</P>
<P>
The poll also found that men are more likely to favor Measure M than women and 
that its support increases among younger, more affluent voters. Respondents 
earning less than $20,000 oppose the measure by 43% to 33%. Those who earn more 
than $60,000, however, support it, with 53% in favor and 29% opposed.

"Measure M would raise the sales tax one-half cent -- from 6 cents to 6 1/2 
cents -- for 20 years, with the funds to be used solely for transportation 
construction and growth management programs. If the election were held today, 
would you vote yes or no on Measure M?"

STRATEGY: Supporters of Measure M, the half-cent transportation tax (A1), are 
mailing out more than 25,000 absentee ballots. . . . With fewer polling places 
open and just a few issues on the Nov. 7 ballot, mail-in votes will be 
decisive, Measure M campaign chairman Bruce Nestande predicted. . . . Measure M 
foe Jerry Yudelson called Nestande's drive "counter-productive," saying the 
typical absentee voter is a tax-hating Republican. . . . The debate will end 
early on election night: Absentee ballots will be counted first -- shortly 
after 8 p.m. Lanie Jones and Rick VanderKynff

HONEYMOON SHAKY FOR NEW CHAPMAN CHIEF 
</P>

<P>
As an undergraduate on his way toward a Ph.D., Allen E. Koenig confided his 
life's ambition to a trusted professor: to become a college president. 
</P>
<P>
It's a story that, 30 years later, Koenig tells on himself. He laughs -- a 
ripping hoot that seems to originate from his toes -- and says he doesn't 
remember making such a statement, but the professor swears that it's true. And, 
looking back over his life and career, he allows that it probably is. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig, the Roman Catholic communications scholar who Oct. 1 became president 
of Chapman College, a mainline Protestant institution, has rarely been deterred 
by obstacles. He has pursued his goals with single-minded determination and, 
some would say, arrogance, that has earned him admirers and enemies nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the Jesuit philosophy of informed conscience," Koenig says, recalling his 
training under the brothers of Loyola High School in his native Los Angeles. 
"Even if your opinion is at odds with the church or goes against the tide, as 
long as you are comfortable with it, go forward." 
</P>
<P>
At Chapman, a shaky honeymoon is still on. Koenig's style and professed plans 
to expand the sleepy 2,200-student college have energized as well as unnerved 
campus veterans. And in the surrounding historic Old Towne community of Orange, 
where anti-growth sentiments run strong, neighbors watch and wait. 
</P>
<P>
As a candidate for president, the 50-year-old Koenig described himself as 
direct, driven and sometimes profane. He suggested Chapman evolve into a 
"medium-sized university" with 3,000 to 4,000 students and a higher national 
profile. Among his five-year goals, Koenig listed raising admission standards 
and salaries while cutting extensive course offerings and the percentage of 
tenured faculty. 
</P>
<P>
His return as president a month later was preceded by a blizzard of negative 
newspaper articles sent anonymously to Chapman executives and faculty from 
Boston where, as president of Emerson College, Koenig captained a controversial 
plan to relocate the campus to suburban Lawrence. Scrawled on some of the 
stories: "Your loss is our gain." 
</P>
<P>
Membership in Chapman's faculty union, which began a resurgence last May, 
leaped afterKoenig's selection. And while some professors worried that 
low-enrollment programs might arbitrarily get the ax under the new president, 
others predicted that he would bring vigor to Chapman, just as he did during 10 
tumultuous years at Emerson. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Old Towne residents, who called for -- and quickly got -- a meeting 
with the new president, still have reservations. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned about his feeling that he needs to expand the college to make it 
economically viable," said Joe Suste, a member of the Old Towne Preservation 
Assn. and owner of a home built in 1909 that is just blocks from Chapman. "For 
years we heard the reverse: Chapman (College officials) said, 'We have so many 
students, we need more space.' " 
</P>
<P>
Chapman's board of trustees was looking for an aggressive leader when it chose 
Koenig after an 18-month executive search. Clearly, they found one. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig attended the University of Southern California and Stanford University 
before earning his doctoral degree at Northwestern University at age 25. He 
taught at universities for three years and finally moved into administration at 
institutions including USC's Idyllwild School of Music and the Arts (ISOMATA). 
He became president of Emerson in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Kittross, the former USC professor to whom Koenig confided his plans to 
head a college in the late 1950s, offers a unique perspective on his former 
protege: Koenig hired him as academic vice president at Emerson in 1985, then 
fired him two years later over personnel disagreements. 
</P>
<P>
"Koenig has a large ego; he is willing to exercise some vision, and he will not 
automatically take the safe route," Kittross said. "He is volatile, but not 
always volatile. I would say, generally speaking, he makes many of the right 
moves." 
</P>
<P>
Kittross, who now teaches mass communications at Emerson, still finds Koenig's 
early and unwavering ambition remarkable. "He was the only undergraduate I've 
ever known to say he wanted to be a college president. And if you look at his 
career, you can trace the path." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Conner, director of performing arts at Emerson, said it doesn't surprise 
him that Koenig chose to be a college president at 21 -- and succeeded. Conner, 
who became close with Koenig in the mid-1970s, when Koenig was executive 
director at Idyllwild and he was in charge of drama programs there, describes 
Koenig as "strong, visionary, controversial and daring." 
</P>
<P>
"He is driven to be who he is, and that is not always the most political way to 
go," Conner said. "That is part of what endears people to him and also (what) 
upsets or alienates people." 
</P>
<P>
Emerson psychology professor Peter Corea falls into the latter group. 
</P>
<P>
Corea, an outspoken critic of the planned move from Boston's Back Bay to the 
depressed mill town of Lawrence, 30 miles north, repeatedly called on Koenig to 
resign. Corea also led a no-confidence vote against the president by the 
Emerson chapter of the American Assn. of University Professors last April. 
</P>
<P>
"Koenig created a lot of wounds here," Corea said in a recent interview. "He 
was a dictator and an empire builder. He could not tolerate opposition. He 
would ruthlessly fire people who disagreed with him." 
</P>
<P>
But he conceded: "Koenig is a doer. He gets things done." 
</P>
<P>
Koenig, a man who by all accounts relishes a good fight, is likely to face his 
first battle at Chapman over the traditionally sensitive issue of expansion. 
</P>
<P>
His dual mandate is enrollment growth and increased quality for the 
128-year-old Disciples of Christ college, which currently accepts 87% of all 
applicants but graduates only 37% of those who start as freshmen. He also will 
preside over a $23-million plan announced in May to build a new student union, 
an academic tower and a residence hall on the 38-acre campus. 
</P>
<P>
While Koenig says higher enrollment and increased tuition revenue are critical 
to balance the budget and end heavy reliance on private fund raising and income 
from 60 extension campuses, he is considerably more circumspect now than he was 
during his days as a candidate for the college presidency. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is one that "I want to be very careful about," he said recently. 
</P>
<P>
There is room for expansion -- a long-term development plan approved by the 
city earlier this year allows 2,500 students on campus at any one time, a 
formula that would permit the student head count to increase from the current 
2,200 to 3,500, according to college administrators. For now, though, Koenig 
said he has set his sights somewhat lower. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to see Chapman where it doesn't have to depend financially" on either 
private donations or the flush extension campuses, he said. That could be 
accomplished, he said, by raising the enrollment to 2,600 or 2,800 students. 
Chapman also should begin competing against other county schools for working, 
part-time students by expanding its now-meager night and weekend class 
offerings. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he still believes that Chapman should become a university, Koenig 
said: "I am not going to answer that directly." But, he added, the school 
already is more "university-like than college-like." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike a traditional liberal arts college, Chapman has several particularly 
strong major programs -- business, communications, education and psychology. 
Oberlin College it is not; but neither is it Stanford University. Chapman 
College also suffers from confusion locally, where it often is mixed up with 
community colleges, and overseas, where "college" is a term applied to the 
American equivalent of a high school. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not in favor of a name change just for the sake of a name change," Koenig 
said. However, he said the name confusion, especially abroad, "would certainly 
be one of the most compelling arguments" for seeking university designation. 
</P>
<P>
The instant prestige conferred by the title "Chapman University" could be 
achieved by filing a simple form with the state, Koenig said. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman would be required to inform its accrediting organization, the Western 
Assn. of Schools and Colleges, of such a change. But the switch would not be 
considered significant enough to warrant a new inspection visit, Koenig said. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman faculty members are likely to support efforts to increase enrollment, 
boost admission standards and become a university, according to Paul Frizler, 
chairman of the Faculty Senate. And while some professors remain apprehensive 
about the new president, Frizler said enthusiasm for Koenig's proposed faculty 
salary boost is universal. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of cutting, we're hoping everything can grow," said Frizler, who is 
also chairman of the English department at Chapman. "Koenig has suggested 
bringing salaries up to a level where, in effect, every faculty member would 
make $20,000 a year more. He's really impressed people here. There's not 
anybody who does not believe he can do it." 
</P>
<P>
At Chapman -- where only 11 people on the payroll earned more than $50,000 in 
1988-89 -- wages are notoriously low. 
</P>
<P>
But Koenig is an apparent exception. Although he declines to comment on his 
salary package at Chapman, he does not deny reports that he earned an annual 
$305,000, including bonuses and expense allowances, at Emerson College. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no comment on that at all," he said. "I had a six-year contract (at 
Emerson) and I was very well compensated." 
</P>
<P>
Koenig's reign at Emerson College brought dramatic growth and prominence to the 
nation's only graduate and undergraduate institution devoted solely to 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
His departure left rancor, shattered plans and uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural address in 1979, Koenig spoke of finding a unified campus for 
the college, which was spread among more than a dozen buildings along a 1 
1/2-mile strip of Boston. An 84-acre site along the Merrimack River in Lawrence 
was chosen in 1987, despite fierce opposition from faculty, students and alumni 
who opposed any move from the vital media and higher education hub of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The $2.15-million purchase was finally completed Sept. 29, but campus 
oddsmakers give the plan only a 50% chance of success. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Lawrence campus -- or any new campus -- depends on a 
rebound in the Boston real estate market, according to Emerson officials. 
Unless the college gets top dollar for its downtown property holdings, which 
were once valued at $100 million, it cannot raise the cash to build. If 
construction does not begin by 1992, the college is required to sell the 
riverfront property back to Lawrence for $100. 
</P>
<P>
Another ambitious undertaking -- one that Koenig touted as an Emerson 
accomplishment when he was a Chapman presidential candidate in August -- 
collapsed just days after Koenig took the job at Chapman. Koenig announced that 
Emerson would drop plans to open a law school in suburban Lowell, Mass., 
because of a new requirement that the college pledge its credit for a five-year 
building lease. His decision later was affirmed by college trustees. 
</P>
<P>
"Lowell officials significantly changed the conditions of what they had 
promised us," Koenig said. "We were faced with a potential liability of $2 
million that we were promised we would not have to incur." 
</P>
<P>
Lowell City Manager James Campbell protested in an interview that Koenig should 
have known about the lease requirement and said the college pullout has 
endangered a sorely needed $20-million redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
But the sharpest criticism has come from former U.S. Sen. Paul Tsongas, a 
Lowell native who had been a close friend of Koenig. Tsongas, now chairman of 
the Massachusetts Board of Regents, which governs colleges and universities, 
said in published reports that he felt "betrayed" by Koenig. Repeated efforts 
to reach Tsongas were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the action speaks to a total lack of any conscience and an arrogance 
that is not present in other colleges and universities in the country . . . ," 
Tsongas told the Lowell Sun newspaper in an Aug. 31 article. "It is shocking to 
me. I mean, this is not a cold, heartless, bottom-line corporation." 
</P>
<P>
Koenig said he is stung by the attacks over the Lowell incident. 
</P>
<P>
"The strategy is very clear," he said. " 'Let's paint Koenig as the bad guy.' 
If I had wanted to take the easy way out, I could have left it for the trustees 
to decide." 
</P>
<P>
Although his Emerson tenure ended on a bitter note, Koenig left a very 
different institution than the one he found. 
</P>
<P>
Under Koenig's watch, Emerson's enrollment increased by more than 900, to 2,400 
students, SAT scores rose substantially, faculty salaries nearly doubled and 
new academic programs were launched. "I feel at peace coming to Chapman," 
Koenig said. "I leave as my legacy at Emerson a piece of property that, if the 
real estate market improves, will allow the college to have a new campus in the 
next five to 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Many at Chapman hope he can work the same transformation there. 
</P>
<P>
"Chapman is a college with a pretty serious identity problem," Koenig said. 
"The greatest legacy that I could leave would be fundamental growth and 
academic quality."

QUIK PROFITS: When the surf's up, Quiksilver's executives and employees spend 
most of their free time at the beach. Despite the Costa Mesa company's casual 
culture, the Quiksilver crew has been riding a tide of profits. And it has not 
gone unnoticed. Forbes magazine ranked the surfwear maker No. 5 on a list of 
the nation's 200 best small companies. The listing is based on the average 
return on equity over the last five years. Quiksilver was among 23 California 
companies on Forbes' list, the most of any state. Lanie Jones and Rick

OLD BONES: THE UNUSED SKELETON IN A RADIOLOGIST'S GARAGE MAY SEE NEW LIFE: IT'S

<TEXT>
<P>
His short life was troubled by breathing difficulties. And after his death many 
years ago, someone strung, wired, spring-loaded and sold his bones. 
</P>
<P>
Now, on the eve of Halloween, 1989, an old rattled skeleton nicknamed Charlie 
hangs alone, covered by plastic, in the garage of an Anaheim radiologist who 
wants to sell him. 
</P>
<P>
"Articulated Human Skeleton complete with stand, $1,600," reads the classified 
advertisement in this month's issue of the Bulletin of the Orange County 
Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
There, listed under "Miscellaneous" and next to ads for a sailboat, an 
"Oriental collection" and seminar space, is the doctor's offer. "Human skull, 
with color-cut sections, case included, $600," it continues. "Excellent 
condition. Make offer for both." 
</P>
<P>
Halloween enthusiasts, the doctor says, need not apply. For the tale of this 
skeleton is scientific, not scary. At least 364 days a year, skeletons are 
serious business. 
</P>
<P>
Like many doctors who have skeletons in their closets for study or teaching, 
Dr. Vahe Meghrouni bought the one he named Charlie from a medical supply 
company. That was more than 25 years ago, when human remains were relatively 
plentiful and cheap. He paid about $250 for the anonymous skeleton, identified 
only by a stamp of the New York supply company, "Clay Adams Inc." inside the 
hip bone. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Charlie served his purpose well, showing doctors, patients and 
technicians how X-rays relate to the skeleton, Meghrouni said. When he could, 
he tried to protect the skeleton's former human dignity from student pranksters 
or aggressive instructors armed with felt pens. Meghrouni taped a typewritten 
sign to its skull: "Keep pens and pencils out of my eyes and nose." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the doctor brought the skeleton home to his luxury estate in the 
Anaheim hills. The bones didn't bother his wife, Armine, a former 
anesthesiologist, nor did they interest his dog Peaches. But his children 
thought they were mildly creepy, and the skeleton moved from the study to 
various bedrooms, then finally to the garage. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little reluctant to part with him," said Meghrouni, 63. But now that he 
is retiring, the doctor has no more use for the skeleton. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Meghrouni insists he will sell Charlie only to someone with an 
academic interest, and not as a curio or for "sport." 
</P>
<P>
"It should be treated with respect," he said, casting a fond glance toward the 
eye sockets. "That was a person." 
</P>
<P>
All he can tell from the bones is that they belonged to a 5-foot, 3-inch adult 
man with a deviated septum -- hence the breathing troubles -- and buck teeth. 
Meghrouni surmised he was from India because, until recently, that country was 
the world's largest supplier of skeletons. 
</P>
<P>
At one time India was exporting 10,000 to 15,000 full skeletons and an 
additional 50,000 skulls a year. They came mostly from Calcutta, where 13 
companies bought unclaimed bodies from morgues, hospitals and the police and 
sold them to foreign markets. But in 1985, the country banned the export of 
human remains, partly for religious reasons. 
</P>
<P>
In the Hindu religion, the souls of bodies that are not cremated "will hover 
and not be at peace," said Pravin Jani, commercial assistant at the Indian 
Consulate in San Francisco. Religious volunteers scour the same places as the 
body brokers, taking the unclaimed bodies to funeral pyres, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not only that, but the trade is "repulsive and distasteful," P.R. Chakravarty, 
a London spokesman for the Indian embassy, has said. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, where the sole market for human remains is among medical 
schools and students, "it's been impossible to get human skeletons," said Dr. 
Robert Blanks, course director for human gross anatomy at UC Irvine's 
California College of Medicine. When Americans donate their bodies for use as 
cadavers to medical schools, the remains are buried by the family when the 
students have finished, Blanks said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the dearth of new skeletons for sale, he said, "There's not a big 
market here." The estimated 20,000 skeletons in circulation in the United 
States are still adequate, he said. "It's not unusual for physicians to have 
skeletons in their closet." 
</P>
<P>
The college already has 14 human skeletons, and furnishes 92 boxes of bones for 
every student. 
</P>
<P>
Former students who in years past were required to buy their own skeletons to 
study have called in saying, "I have a skeleton in my closet, would you mind 
buying it?" Blanks said. "We buy it back at what they think it's worth." 
</P>
<P>
A student-quality skull, bought for $100 in 1970, might fetch up to $500 today, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Blanks said a $1,600 price tag on a full human skeleton is "very reasonable, 
actually." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, students now also use high quality plastic reproductions of human 
bones, even though plastic models, while sophisticated, cannot match the real 
thing for showing openings for vessels and nerves and internal structure of the 
bones, Blanks said. 
</P>
<P>
He predicts the demand for human bones will increase in the next two years due 
to attrition of the fixed supply. "Students drop boxes, lose bones, they mark 
them up with pens and you have to throw them away." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a few U.S. suppliers may find new sources for skeletons, he said, 
but warned they wouldn't want to talk about it. "They have legal import 
permits. But they are very cautious of their sources. They want to protect 
them."

IMPACT OF CITY SEX-BIAS LAWS TOUGH TO GAUGE; 
</P>
<P>
GAY RIGHTS: VOTERS WILL DECIDE WHETHER IRVINE REMAINS IN THE CLUB OF CITIES 
OUTLAWING DISCRIMINATION BASED ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION. PASSAGE OF MEASURE N 
WOULD STRIP THAT SECTION FROM A YEAR-OLD CIVIL RIGHTS ORDINANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To the amazement of passers-by at the busy intersection in downtown Washington, 
D.C., the message of hatred on the electronic board flashed over and over, 
spewing a dictum of violence against gays and drug users in a supposed effort 
to "stamp out AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
Offended or not, the "junkies" -- as they were called in the message -- 
couldn't do much under the law to vent their displeasure. But gay activists and 
city officials acting on their behalf moved in quickly, causing the message to 
be turned off and promising to pursue civil fines, prosecution and business 
suspensions against those responsible. 
</P>
<P>
They had the specific power to clamp down on the message because the nation's 
capital in 1973 became one of the first of more than 60 towns and cities across 
the country, from rural hamlets to metropolitan centers, that made it illegal 
to discriminate against gays and lesbians in such areas as employment, housing 
and public services. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine became one of those cities in 1988. Eight days from now, on Nov. 7, 
Irvine voters will decide whether their city remains a member of that club or, 
instead, follows the direction offered by local religious leaders and 
conservatives who charge that the ordinance legitimizes an immoral life style. 
</P>
<P>
Gay activists for the most part have been stymied in efforts to get 
anti-discrimination measures passed nationally and in states such as 
California. And so they have turned with increasing frequency -- and greater 
results -- to cities and towns for protection. 
</P>
<P>
But even as they hail the ordinances' successes in deterring discrimination, 
activists acknowledge that tracing that impact is difficult. 
</P>
<P>
And dramatic instances of putting the gay rights ordinances to the test -- as 
seen last week in Washington in combatting the homophobic message -- are the 
exception, rather than the rule. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, based on the experiences of other cities, Irvine's ordinance may not 
have a dramatic effect on daily life in the city but instead may be a 
reflection of the community's broader values and attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's emotionally charged Measure N, if passed, would strip from the city's 
year-old civil rights ordinance the section that bans discrimination based on 
sexual orientation. The campaign is being watched around the state and country 
as a test of gay political force against "traditional values" forces. 
</P>
<P>
"What's at stake here is the heterosexual life style," said Brett Barbre, an 
aide to Rep. William E. Dannemeyer, an ardent foe of homosexuality. "If they 
can push their agenda in a conservative, bedroom community like Irvine, they 
can do it anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
But critics of Measure N counter that what is really at stake is the 
community's respect for differing points of view and life styles. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally do not believe in homosexuality, nor do I endorse it," said 
Thomas Parham, an architect of Irvine's original ordinance, "but that's not the 
point. The issue is whether or not we believe that everyone in this city ought 
to be free from discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
Against a backdrop of intensified clashes over the gay issue throughout Orange 
County, the debate over Irvine's Measure N has been a study in contrasts. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of homosexuals project a city of immorality, filled with gay sex in 
public restrooms and homosexual teachers and Big Brothers, while the gay rights 
supporters speak in broad, impassioned terms about equality among all citizens 
and the rejection of bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
Less discussed and tougher to gauge, however, is the practical impact of the 
city's gay rights ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
In Irvine -- as in Laguna Beach, the only other city in Orange County to adopt 
a gay rights measure -- there have not actually been any claims filed under the 
measure since it was adopted in the summer of 1988, according to city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
And a look at other municipalities around the country that have adopted similar 
ordinances -- outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation and 
providing civil remedies for relief -- suggests that the Irvine experience may 
not be unique. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard we have such a thing, but I've never read it, and we've never had a 
case brought under it," Gary Horowitz, attorney for the village of Alfred in 
Upstate New York, said when asked about the town's gay rights ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
A rural, conservative village of about 2,000 permanent residents that 
quintuples its population with an annual pilgrimage of students at local 
colleges, Alfred in 1974 became one of the first municipalities in the country 
to pass legislation protecting the rights of gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
It was the college community -- a significant presence in the growing gay 
political movement nationwide over the past two decades -- that helped fuel the 
measure in Alfred. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though these ordinances can be pretty ineffectual," recalls Tony Russo of 
New York City, a gay student leader in Alfred when the city law was passed, "we 
felt that the mere fact that such an ordinance was on the books would inspire 
people not to discriminate and to realize the repercussions if they did." 
</P>
<P>
Even in major cities that have gay rights ordinances, such as Los Angeles, 
Washington and New York, city officials likewise say the measures have not 
opened any floodgates of claims by gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (the gay rights ordinance) is really underutilized. There's a low 
level of awareness that it even exists," said Suzanne Sangree, a staff attorney 
with New York City's Commission on Human Rights, echoing the comments of 
officials in several cities around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Added James Mercer, a Washington human rights administrator who is 
investigating the offensive message that flashed on a city billboard last week: 
"Quite frankly, I think the symbolism is more important than the practical 
legal remedy." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Washington's ordinance was put to practical use last week when the message 
"Help Stamp Out AIDS Now: Kill All Queers and Junkies" flashed on the downtown 
message board. When the message was called to the attention of the city's 
office of human rights, the plug was abruptly pulled and an immediate 
investigation was begun. 
</P>
<P>
"What our ordinance has really done -- and not just for gays and lesbians, but 
for the whole city -- is to send a clear message that bigotry will not be 
tolerated in our city," Mercer said. 
</P>
<P>
Minneapolis saw its human rights ordinance challenged in 1974 when a gay man 
applied to be a Big Brother volunteer and was told that his "affectional 
preference" would be revealed to the mother of a potential "little brother." 
Although initially a civil rights office decided there was discrimination in 
this, ultimately the Minnesota Supreme Court rejected that opinion and ruled 
that the Big Brothers organization could inquire about sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
(The Minneapolis law is cited repeatedly by proponents of Measure N, who have 
claimed in their ballot argument and in campaign material that Big Brothers was 
forced to recruit gays as volunteers because of the court challenge -- and have 
declined "because of word limitations" to reveal the final ruling by the state 
Supreme Court.) 
</P>
<P>
Big Brother and civil rights officials in Minneapolis have said there has been 
no controversy over the law since the decision and that the Measure N 
proponents have misrepresented the facts of the case. 
</P>
<P>
The major exception in putting its ordinance to active and frequent use may be 
San Francisco, where city officials say their human rights office is kept busy 
with about 50 to 60 investigations a year into specific claims of 
discrimination based on sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
Most involve employment claims from gays who charge that they were not hired, 
were fired or were not promoted because their bosses did not like "faggots," 
said Norman Nickens, coordinator of the city's gay anti-discrimination unit. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the complaints in San Francisco are resolved through talks between 
the alleged victim and the employer, landlord or other party accused of 
discrimination, often resulting in thousands of dollars in damages, Nickens 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In one celebrated case, Pacific Bell agreed in 1986 to pay $3 million to settle 
claims that it had systematically discriminated against gays in Northern 
California in its employment practices, rejecting some for hiring because they 
were deemed "manifest homosexuals." 
</P>
<P>
But the wording of the rights ordinances -- banning discrimination based on 
sexual orientation, not specifically against gays and lesbians -- has produced 
some ironic twists. 
</P>
<P>
Nickens recalled one woman who got a cash settlement after claiming she was 
fired for being heterosexual. Her gay employer, it seems, had assumed she was a 
lesbian until she walked into work one day wearing a wedding ring. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of gay rights ordinances point to San Francisco as a harbinger of the 
dangers and "immorality" that await places such as Irvine that carve out 
"special" exemptions for gays. 
</P>
<P>
And they cite the absence of claims in other major cities as a sign that there 
is little problem with discrimination against gays in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"Homosexuals have been very proud of the fact that they've been successful in 
their careers and endeavors but that very success belies the contention that 
they've been discriminated against," asserted Lawrence McNamee, a Whittier 
radiologist and author on AIDS who has supported the Irvine initiative to 
strike down the gay rights provision.

ADOPTING A PARK HELPS ALL-AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minh Nguyen was a young man with a mission as he worked one afternoon picking 
up beer cans, candy wrappers and other junk at Richman Park in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"We pick up trash and then we play," said Minh, 9, as he and his fourth-grade 
classmates from Richman Elementary School scattered over the park. "If you just 
pick up trash, you can't do anything fun." 
</P>
<P>
The afternoon outing was intended to be both fun and productive. Fifteen such 
weekly outings will earn Minh's school $500. 
</P>
<P>
The program, called Adopt-a-Park, has worked successfully since the city 
started it several years ago, program coordinator Nancy L. Guider said. Up to 
20 nonprofit city groups, including schools, adopt a city park each fall and 
spring and agree to pick up litter and report hazards or problems to city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wonderful," Guider said. "The residents get clean parks, the 
participating groups get $500 to help toward their worthy causes and the city 
-- heck, we get a bargain in the fact that it costs less to send these groups 
out than one senior maintenance worker." 
</P>
<P>
Keeping their parks and schools clean teaches the students to respect their 
neighborhoods and gives them a feeling of accomplishment and pride, teacher San 
Roman said as Minh and his classmates finished their work. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope the lesson carries through and to their home life also," Roman said. 
"It's fun, but it's also a learning experience." 
</P>
<P>
The afternoon assignment began with students lugging five-gallon buckets to the 
park and carrying long black claws to help keep trash at arm's length and then 
some. 
</P>
<P>
Picking up trash is not a clean job. "It's gooshy and it's yucky," 9-year-old 
Steve Hoskins said as he deposited grimy papers into a bucket. 
</P>
<P>
In 10 minutes, the students half-filled two buckets. They spent the rest of 
their time collecting their rewards: banana Popsicles and the remaining class 
period to play in the park. 
</P>
<P>
Adopt-a-Park does not replace city maintenance workers, Guider said, but 
augments them. City crews still visit the parks to clean and remove large 
trash, such as old couches and mattresses.

2-YEAR-OLD KILLED IN FALL FROM TRUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 2-year-old Anaheim child died after opening the door of a truck she was 
riding in and falling to the street, police reported on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County coroner's office identified the child as Jennifer Carter. The 
accident occurred at the intersection of Orangethorpe and Richfield streets in 
Placentia at 12:39 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the girl was riding in a four-door truck in which her stepfather, 
David DeMore, 25, also was a passenger. DeMore was in the front passenger seat, 
and the child was in a seat belt in the rear seat, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said the child unbelted her seat and opened the door, falling to the 
pavement. She suffered massive head and internal injuries and was pronounced 
dead at Kaiser Permanente Anaheim Medical center shortly after the accident, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The truck, driven by Larry D. Welch, 34, was traveling about 30 m.p.h. at the 
time of the accident, officers said. No citations were issued.

ILLEGAL ALIEN CENSUS ROLE TO BE DISCUSSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A resolution of support for the inclusion of illegal aliens in the 1990 census 
will be considered Monday by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, Dana Point will join several other California cities in sending a 
message of solidarity on the issue to Sens. Alan Cranston and Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
In a report, Councilman Mike Eggers said the counting of undocumented 
immigrants would have far-reaching effects on cities. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a very real and direct impact on not only Orange County, but local 
cities as well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If Dana Point requests federal money for such public services as road 
improvements or capital projects, "the census counts could prove critical," he 
said.

POLICY URGED ON LEASING COLLEGE LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. JEANETTE AVENT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leasing college land to private developers to raise money for the Coast 
Community College District is an issue that needs to be resolved once and for 
all, say candidates campaigning for two seats on the district board of trustees 
in the Nov. 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with declining state money because of dwindling enrollment, trustees last 
year approved a developer's proposal to build 480 apartments on land at the 
district's Costa Mesa headquarters. The plan, projected to net the district 
about $5 million in the first 10 years of the 66-year lease, was withdrawn 
after strong objections from the community and the Costa Mesa City Council. 
</P>
<P>
But the issue is far from settled, according to trustee Sherry L. Baum, who is 
seeking her second four-year term on the board: "It's not a dead issue. . . . 
It's been lurking in the background." 
</P>
<P>
Baum, 58, of Seal Beach favors the selection of a committee of community 
residents and college officials to study such lease arrangements and draw up a 
district master plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been doing piecemeal planning," she said. "We need to formulate and 
implement a master plan for the district's future growth and development." 
</P>
<P>
But Deborah Sperberg, who is running for the board for the first time, said she 
opposes leasing district lands for up to 66 years, especially for high-density 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to be able to respond much more quickly to changing enrollment needs, 
said Sperberg, 50, of Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Walter G. Howald, who is seeking reelection, opposes building 
apartments and commercial facilities on college land. 
</P>
<P>
But Howald, 50, of Newport Beach added that trustees should be open to the 
future needs of the students and the community, and questioned whether the 
board can bar future trustees from considering such proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Candidate George E. Brown of Seal Beach, who withdrew from the race too late 
for his name to be removed from the ballot, has endorsed Baum in a letter to 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Community College District includes Orange Coast Community College in 
Costa Mesa, Golden West College in Huntington Beach and Coastline Community 
College, with headquarters in Fountain Valley. More than 320,000 residents of 
Costa Mesa, Fountain Valley, Huntington Beach, Midway City, Newport Beach, Seal 
Beach, Stanton, Sunset Beach, Westminster and part of Garden Grove are 
registered to vote in the election. 
</P>
<P>
The district's teachers' union is supporting Baum and Sperberg in the race, 
said Judith Ackley, a spokeswoman for the Coast Federation of Employees, 
American Federation of Teachers, Local 1911. 
</P>
<P>
Ackley said the union decided not to endorse Howald for a second term because 
of his record in office and because he declared the land-use issue to be 
strictly a matter for the board to decide. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the land-use idea needs to be decided in an open forum by the 
community, staff and students," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ackley said union members also consider Sperberg "a superior candidate. . . . 
We believe she would be a good board member." 
</P>
<P>
She said the district will benefit from Sperberg's background in business and 
computers in resolving registration problems. The district bought a new 
computer and hired a consultant to establish new registration procedures this 
fall, but Ackley said that "registration is getting worse, not better." At 
Orange Coast and Golden West colleges, she said, "we've had the worst 
registration we've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
Howald, who was endorsed by the teacher group four years ago, said he does not 
believe that the candidate slate represents the choice of the majority of 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've taken a district with fiscal difficulties and transformed it into a 
district of fiscal responsibility," Howald said of the board's successes during 
his term. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gone from decreasing enrollment to increasing enrollment. We've gone 
from hiring no new teachers to hiring more than 40 new teachers this year. 
Teachers have gone from no raise to a 2% raise to a 10% raise" in the last four 
years, he said. G. JEANETTE AVENT

County Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, his wife, Emma Jean, and 
YMCA volunteer Patricia Place received Reach Out recognition awards this 
weekend at a banquet sponsored by the Newport-Costa Mesa YMCA's Center for 
Family Counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Riley was honored for his participation in community affairs since 1964 and for 
his service to the 5th District. His wife was honored for her support of the 
YMCA Hotel for Women and the Newport Beach chapter of Childhelp. 
</P>
<P>
Place has helped raise money for the Newport-Costa Mesa YMCA for 12 years, 
including more than $180,000 during her three-year term as chairwoman of its 
annual Support Campaign. Place is a six-year member of the Y's board of 
directors and teaches swimming and fitness classes. 
</P>
<P>
"The Y is the only organization I know of that enables me to know so many 
different kinds of people," Place said. "There are men and women of all ages 
and religious affiliations. That's what I like most about it." 
</P>
<P>
About 350 people attended the awards banquet and auction held Friday night at 
the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach. The event benefited the Y's Center for 
Family Counseling, which provides family and individual counseling on a 
sliding-fee scale. JANICE JONES

BEARS CLAIM VICTORY IN ROOKIE CORNERBACK'S BATTLE WITH ELLARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ram receiver Henry Ellard caught five passes for 100 yards Sunday, but to hear 
the Bears talk, you would have thought he had been shut out. 
</P>
<P>
In a new twist, Ellard found himself accompanied on all pass routes by Bear 
rookie cornerback Donnell Woolford. According to Ellard, it was the first time 
this season that a team has tried this strategy. 
</P>
<P>
It worked -- sort of. 
</P>
<P>
Ellard failed to score, but he did manage to sneak behind Woolford and the rest 
of the secondary on numerous occasions. 
</P>
<P>
Still, safety Dave Duerson, a four-time Pro Bowl selection, was quick to 
announce that Woolford had done well. 
</P>
<P>
"(He) played one of the finest games I've seen by a corner," Duerson said. 
</P>
<P>
Ellard wasn't quite as impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"He did all right," Ellard said. "(Quarterback Jim Everett) missed a couple 
times, but Donnell did a good job. He's definitely a good corner who's going to 
get better by playing more and more." 
</P>
<P>
Said Woolford: "I knew (Ellard) was going to catch his share of passes. He got 
some and I had an interception." 
</P>
<P>
Woolford also had an interference call on the second play of the game. He 
tackled Ellard, which would have been fine, except Ellard hadn't touched the 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I had a chance to (score)," Ellard said. "The safety was across the 
field and everyone else was saying I had six points." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Bell doesn't fumble often -- only twice this season -- but they seem to 
have come at the absolute worst times. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday against the Bears, in a game tied, 3-3, Bell had the ball poked from his 
grasp by defensive lineman William Perry. Richard Dent recovered, and not long 
after, the Bears had a seven-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying so hard, my arms were pumping," Bell said. "I'm sure if you look 
at the film you'll see both my arms were up. I saw (Perry) at the last minute, 
but . . . 
</P>
<P>
"He made a great defensive play. Give him credit." 
</P>
<P>
Bell had no fumbles in his first 100 carries this season. In his past 42 
rushing attempts, he's fumbled twice. 
</P>
<P>
His earlier fumble this season came Oct. 16 against Buffalo. It led to a 
first-quarter field goal to cut the Rams' lead to 7-3 in a game they eventually 
lost, 23-20. They haven't won since. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Muster was the Bears' first-round draft choice in 1988, but the former 
Stanford fullback hadn't played like it until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Some in Chicago wondered whether the Bears blew the pick, but Muster seemed to 
prove some doubters wrong at Soldier Field in the Bears' 20-10 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Muster carried nine times for 33 yards and a touchdown and had four receptions 
for 44 yards. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Muster was the Bears' version of Gaston Green, carrying only 44 times 
all season for 197 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just happy to be getting the ball each week," Muster said after Sunday's 
game. "With the different plays, I get a few more opportunities to run. I 
really don't listen to the critics. I just do what I can." 
</P>
<P>
So what's wrong with the Bears' defense? Apparently nothing that a game against 
the Rams couldn't cure. Chicago had the league's 26th-ranked defense entering 
Sunday's game, but held the Rams to 252 net yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense played with the tenacity that the Bears are noted for and I'm 
proud of them," Coach Mike Ditka said. "I'm proud of every one of them. They 
played as hard as they can out there. Of course, the addition of Richard Dent 
seemed to make a big difference. The pressure was good, our coverage was good." 
</P>
<P>
So is this the same Ram team that opened the season 5-0?

"It's the same team," offensive tackle Jackie Slater said. "We just have some 
problems." There had been talk all week that Jim Harbaugh might replace Mike 
Tomczak as the Bears' quarterback, so it wasn't much of a surprise when 
Harbaugh entered Sunday's game in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Every week I try to visualize some way of getting into the game," Harbaugh 
said. "Because, when you're the backup QB, the starter can get hurt. A lot of 
things can happen. I'm just going to prepare like I'm going to play." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, remember, suffered a four-game losing streak last season and still 
finished 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to keep fighting, same as last year," Ellard said. "I don't think 
we're necessarily worried about it. Last year, we got a little panicky. This 
year, I don't think that will happen."

FOOTBALL PLAYER GETS A LUCKY BREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It may sound a bit odd to say a kid who broke his neck is lucky, but Jayson 
Bern is. 
</P>
<P>
Bern, a senior at Cypress High School, played nose tackle on the school 
football team. Thursday, in the first quarter of an Empire League game against 
Esperanza, he was pursuing an Esperanza runner when the runner cut back. Bern's 
head smashed into the back of the runner and Bern dropped. 
</P>
<P>
His parents, Michael and Catherine, were watching from the stands at Valencia's 
Bradford Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"At first we didn't think it was anything serious," Michael said. "We thought 
he just got dinged up. But then they told both teams to get off the field and 
we knew it was something bad." 
</P>
<P>
Bern was taken off the field on a stretcher and transported to Placentia Linda 
Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"We were with him in the emergency room," Michael said. "It was a busy night. 
There was another football player with a dislocated elbow, people with heart 
problems. When they took him for X-rays, we went outside to try and get some 
air and gather our thoughts. When they brought him back, a doctor pulled us 
into a room. When he said Jayson had a broken neck, it just about destroyed my 
wife." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Bern's injury -- an anterior lateral break of the sixth vertebra 
-- did not cause any paralysis. He spent Thursday night and Friday in the 
hospital, but was home by Saturday afternoon, wearing a hard plastic neck 
brace. 
</P>
<P>
Almost incredibly, Bern is planning on attending classes today at Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider ourselves very lucky," Michael said. 
</P>
<P>
So do his friends and coaches on the Cypress football team. John Selbe, Cypress 
head coach, admitted it was difficult to keep his mind on Thursday's game -- 
eventually won by Esperanza, 28-3 -- after Bern's injury. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was shaken up about it," Selbe said. "He's a great kid that a lot of 
the other players look up to. He had had some trouble with pinched nerves in 
his neck, and at first I was hoping that was all it was. But it became apparent 
pretty soon that it was a lot more serious. 
</P>
<P>
"But to show you what kind of kid Jayson is, he sent his father back to tell 
the team to play hard the rest of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Bern's football career is definitely over. 
</P>
<P>
"My son played his last game Thursday," Michael said. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors have told Jayson that if he's careful and allows the vertebrae to heal, 
he stands a good chance of avoiding surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had so much support from so many people," Michael said. "Players, 
coaches and parents from both teams came to the hospital to check on him. I'm 
pretty biased, but I think my son's a great kid, although I do think he's used 
up one of his nine lives." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Fred DiPalma turned around a floundering Santiago football program. 
The Cavaliers had won only three games in 1984, but in 1985 they won their 
first six. 
</P>
<P>
Four years and two jobs later, DiPalma is at it again, helping to turn the 
fortunes of a Savanna football program that seemed beyond hope. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels won only one game last season -- they were outscored 334-55 -- and 
had won only six games in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
In stepped DiPalma, who had spent the previous two years as an assistant coach 
under Mike Marrujo at Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I might like to try being a head coach again," DiPalma said. "When I 
told people I was going for the Savanna job, some of them thought I was crazy. 
But I thought there might really be some potential here." 
</P>
<P>
Most conspicuously were the imposing frames of offensive tackle Michael George 
(6-feet-4, 285-pounds) and defensive tackle Robert Landis (6-3, 270) and the 
all-around talents of running back/linebacker Kenison PoChing. 
</P>
<P>
DiPalma took over in April and immediately set about trying to change his 
team's attitude with some symbolic changes. 
</P>
<P>
"We bought brand new home uniforms, we changed our helmet decals," DiPalma 
said. "We wanted to change the way the kids perceived themselves and their 
team. We wanted to show them that the way things were wasn't going to be the 
way things were going to be any longer. We wanted to change the attitude that, 
'Oh, we're from Savanna, so we're not supposed to win at football' " 
</P>
<P>
Still, things got off to a disturbing start when Savanna lost its first game of 
the season, 17-12, to Garden Grove, the only team it had beaten last season. 
That was followed by a 17-14 loss to Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
But in the next six weeks, Savanna lost only once (33-21 to Troy) to improve to 
4-3-1. 
</P>
<P>
After defeating Brea-Olinda, 21-6, Friday, DiPalma's team finds itself tied for 
second in the Orange League with Valencia at 2-0-1. Western leads with a 3-0 
record. If Savanna wins one of its remaining two games -- it plays Anaheim (0-3 
in league) Friday at Glover Stadium and Western on Nov. 10 -- it will make the 
playoffs for the first time since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The key to the Rebels' season may not have been a victory but a 14-14 tie 
against Valencia, the league's six-time defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids weren't necessarily happy about tying, but it did give them the 
confidence that they could play with a great program like Valencia," DiPalma 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna is definitely not flashy. Relying on a run-oriented, ball-control 
offense with PoChing, who rushed for 147 yards and a touchdown against Brea, 
doing the bulk of the work. 
</P>
<P>
The defense has been tough, allowing 28 points in three league games. 
</P>
<P>
DiPalma hopes his team won't let up in the next two weeks, even though they 
need just one victory. He remembers 1985, when his 6-0 Santiago team lost three 
of its last four games and missed the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember that very well," DiPalma said. 
</P>
<P>
This figures to be a great week for Orange County water polo fans. 
</P>
<P>
How's this for numbers: In the final week of the regular season, three of the 
county's most competitive leagues will have showdowns for league titles 
featuring six teams ranked in the county's top 10 poll. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar (ranked No. 1) and Newport Harbor (No. 8), both 4-0 in league, 
play Wednesday at Newport Harbor to decide yet another Sea View League 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
In the South Coast League, Capistrano Valley (No. 2) and El Toro (No. 3), both 
4-0 in league, and ranked No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, in the 3-A, play 
Thursday at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, Villa Park (No. 4) and Foothill (No. 6), each 4-0 in the 
Century League, play at Foothill.

WORLD TRADE CENTER HELPS SMOOTH THE BORDER CROSSINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gregory Crouch, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County is quickly becoming a major player in world trade. 
Mega-corporations and entrepreneurs alike are selling everything from doghouses 
to disk drives in places as formidable as the Communist bloc. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Phoenix Group International in Irvine recently made headlines 
around the world after it signed an unprecedented joint venture agreement to 
help provide as many as 6 million IBM-compatible personal computers to the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Bureau of Export Administration in Newport Beach said export license 
requests increased more than 80% in 1988 compared to a year before. And that 
federal agency's jurisdiction only covers high-tech products. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Lentz is the executive director of the World Trade Center Assn. of 
Orange County, based in Santa Ana. She was interviewed by Times Staff Writer 
Gregory Crouch about Orange County's new-found worldliness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. What is the World Trade Center Assn? 
</P>
<P>
A. Our purpose is to make business happen for our members. And to encourage 
international trade in Orange County in general. We try to answer questions and 
create services that will really help people with their businesses and not just 
be another place you come to hear another speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The World Trade Center Assn. of Orange County is part of a larger group, 
isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
A. The World Trade Center Assn. is headquartered in New York. There are 204 
other associations in 52 countries. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How big is your organization in Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
A. We've grown from 350 members three years ago to 800 now, including 550 
companies. The remainder are consulates and students. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What kind of services do you offer? 
</P>
<P>
A. First, we created an institute in conjunction with Coastline Community 
College that has been running for 2 1/2 years now. The institute has a resource 
center including a library we contributed that now has about 5,000 
publications. Its focus is strictly international business and it is open from 
9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. What's more, the institute offers 
approximately 13 different classes and has had over 1,500 business people go 
through it so far. We have also created a trade development department in the 
last year to match businesses with distributors or to do market research 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Who takes the classes? 
</P>
<P>
A. The kind of person they attract is usually a beginning or mid-level manager 
who is sent by his or her company. They also have a high concentration of 
entrepreneurs who are beginning some kind of international company or wanting 
to market a product overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What types of classes are offered? 
</P>
<P>
A. The calsses range anywhere from "How to Do a Letter of Credit" to a general 
overview of international business to doing business in specific countries like 
Japan, China or Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Members also have access to computer databases about international trade, 
don't they? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. NETWORK is our computerized trade lead system and database run by our 
headquarters in New York. You can use it with your personal computer. Here in 
Orange County, we are fortunate because there is a computer in Newport Beach so 
you simply link into that with a local telephone call. It has trade leads that 
are posted on a daily basis from all over the world. Trade leads are offers to 
buy and offers to sell as well as companies looking for distributors. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How extensively do Orange County business people use NETWORK? 
</P>
<P>
A. I'm proud to say Orange County is third in the world in our association in 
the use of NETWORK. We are right behind Taipei and New York. So for our county, 
I think that's pretty impressive. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How strong is Orange County's involvement in world trade? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think Orange County is a very viable international center and I think one 
reason is because there are so many entrepreneurs and small business people who 
really see this as a good tool for their businesses. Orange County itself is 
just a small business county. There is a lot of leading-edge technology here. 
That's why the Bureau of Export Administration located its office here. When 
they decided to locate for the first time outside of Washington, D.C., they 
thought they would go to Silicon Valley. But when they ran their license 
applications by ZIP code, it turned out that it was really primarily Irvine, 
Costa Mesa and Santa Ana businesses that were filing these. Orange County is 
the leading county in the nation now for export of high-technology products. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What kinds of products are Orange County companies exporting? 
</P>
<P>
A. I would say that there are lots of smaller companies here that are doing 
cutting-edge technology. The other mix we see is a lot of biomedical and 
medical equipment supplies. And I see quite a few trading companies, people 
trying to be the middlemen. Plus I've noticed a number of people looking 
seriously at California life style products. The bathing suits that are made 
here, surf goods, the sort of things that symbolize California. I think it's 
hard to characterize this market because it's so diverse and there are so many 
different types of businesses here. And we've seen in the last couple of years 
much more of an interest in international trade generally across the board. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How do you account for Orange County's explosive interest in world trade? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think a lot of people have been approached by people from other countries 
wanting to represent their products so it kind of spurs their interest. I also 
think one reason too is because Orange County businesses do tend to be risk 
takers and are entrepreneurial so they are willing to look at something that is 
unique and different. And I think the falling dollar has something to do with 
it as well. It has become easier for people to sell their products overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Which countries buy the majority of products exported from Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
A. Interestingly enough, the last survey we did -- which is a couple of years 
old -- indicated the No. 1 country was the United Kingdom, followed by Germany 
and then Japan third. Now I don't know if in the last couple of years those 
numbers could change. But Orange County companies do a tremendous amount of 
business with Canada and Europe as well as the Pacific Rim because Canada and 
Europe are easier markets to start in. There are trade barriers that make it 
difficult to export a lot of products to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are some business people resistant to the idea of selling overseas? 
</P>
<P>
A. For a long time the United States was top dog and we dominated the world 
both politically and economically and like everything else times change. And 
it's hard to change with them sometimes. But I've found that once people see 
the advantage of international business they do it. Good business people can 
understand good business concepts whether they are international or domestic. 
The problem is if you have a good product and a good market, you're not just 
competing domestically; you are competing internationally because companies 
from other places, other lands, come here and compete in that same market. 
That's why businesses have to be international or they won't survive into the 
21st Century. It isn't any longer just a domestic or international market. It's 
a global market. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are the typical questions you receive from Orange County business 
people? 
</P>
<P>
A. How do I do it? How do I get into international trade? What is a letter of 
credit? We get a lot of questions on how do I go about finding a distributor in 
this particular country. We get a lot of specific questions about specific 
products in specific areas of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Can you give me an example? 
</P>
<P>
A. How do I distribute my faucets in Mexico? Who are my competitors? What is 
the market there now? What is the market share? How much of a market is there? 
And who are the people and what percentage do they have of the market? You get 
a lot of very sophisticated questions for people who are trying to decide if 
they are going to expand their business or if they are even going to start. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Does your trade development department answer such specifics? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. Our interns go to the library, contact our sister world trade centers 
in, for example, both Mexico City and Guadalajara, use the Department of 
Commerce and use databases. And sometimes we're real successful and sometimes 
we're only partially successful. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How much do you charge for such a service? 
</P>
<P>
A. We'll answer basic questions and we give everybody two free hours of market 
research time. And then we always answer basic questions without charging, such 
as those about letters of credit, customs brokers etc. For an in-depth project 
like faucets in Mexico, we will charge maybe between $600 and $700. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How do you find a company to export your product? 
</P>
<P>
A. They are listed in the Yellow Pages under customs brokers and freight 
forwarders. Customs brokers are the people who handle importing of goods and 
freight forwarders are the people who ship things out of the country. Some 
companies are both. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What kinds of questions should you ask to make sure the customs broker or 
freight forwarder is reliable and reputable? 
</P>
<P>
A. When you look for either one of those, one thing I always tell people is 
that you have to remember that they are only an extension of your business. If 
your customs broker screws up and you don't get your shipment and you can't 
ship to your customers, or your freight forwarder screws up and your shipment 
doesn't reach your customer, they are not going to call the freight forwarder. 
They are going to call you and they are going to yell at you and it's going to 
reflect negatively on you. So you should pick four or five companies and 
interview them as though you would interview a prospective employee. One area 
of concern is rates. You have to look at that because freight is an expensive 
portion of doing business overseas. But you also have to look for service and 
commitment and I always ask for a few references of companies that they do 
business with. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What is a letter of credit? 
</P>
<P>
A. A letter of credit is an instrument of payment that has been used in 
international trade since the Babylonian times. It can be very complicated but 
it is a way of ensuring that you are going to be paid. Basically a letter of 
credit is issued by your customer's bank. Say, for example, you are selling 
3,000 widgets and it's a million-dollar order. Your customer will issue a 
letter of credit from their bank which is then transmitted to your bank for a 
million dollars. The most secure letter of credit is a so-called confirmed 
letter, which is issued by your customer's bank to your bank and your bank 
confirms it, which means that they will pay it regardless of whether or not 
there is any money in your customer's account. So you are insured no matter 
what. So when you make the shipment, you submit all of the documents that are 
required under the letter of credit and then the bank will pay you immediately. 
The complicated part is that the documents required can be very complex and if 
they are not exact -- down to typos in the description of your product -- the 
bank will often refuse to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How do you find a good, reputable distributor for your product? 
</P>
<P>
A. You'll get lots of letters from people overseas who want to represent your 
product. We at the World Trade Center Assn. will a lot of times do searches on 
a distributor. We will contact, for example, the World Trade Center in Paris 
and ask them if they know about this company or ask if they can find out any 
information about them. We also recommend that you go through the Department of 
Commerce, which has a similar kind of distributor qualification service. Don't 
just jump into bed with anybody in business. Be as careful as you would in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Let's say I make surfboards and I've gotten the idea I want to sell my 
product in Australia. What should I do first? 
</P>
<P>
A. Do some research, through us or the Deparment of Commerce. First of all you 
must figure out if there is a market for surfboards in Australia. Obviously 
there is. But then who in Australia sells surfboards? And is there domestic 
competition? Who is there and what is their market share? Without good 
information you can't make good business decisions. So once you figure out 
there is a market, you need a business plan. You need to decide if you are 
going to manufacture them here. Then you need to get a good freight forwarder 
and work on your pricing for your freight. Then you need to decide how you are 
going to sell the surfboards in Australia. Do you want to try and sell them 
directly from here? Most companies probably would say no, especially with 
surfboards. So then you find out who are the major distributors for surfboards 
in Australia and then you start contacting them. My recommendation is that you 
go to the country and meet with people face to face. If you don't have the 
money, you can at least get some kind of introduction through a consulate. Talk 
to the potential distributor and start negotiating the first order. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What is the cheapest way to familiarize yourself with a country? 
</P>
<P>
A. There are some low-cost alternatives to traveling alone. The California 
State World Trade Commission's office in Long Beach does lots of trade shows 
and they buy space as California and then they turn around and take companies 
with them. It can be really reasonable to participate in a trade show because 
you meet a lot of people. Furthermore, the Department of Commerce does 
matchmakers, which are trade missions where they will take a group of companies 
in a specific industry to a specific area for a relatively low cost, maybe 
$2,000 or so. For example, you go to Australia with a group of other leisure 
people and what the Department of Commerce does is set up appointments with all 
the right people.
