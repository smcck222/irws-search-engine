JACQUES DEMY; DIRECTED 'UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jacques Demy, 59, the French film director best known internationally for "The 
Umbrellas of Cherbourg," a revolutionary concept in motion pictures in which 
every word of dialogue was sung to a score by Michel Legrand. Trained as an 
animator and documentarian, Demy specialized in romantic, eloquent films rich 
in color. 
</P>
<P>
"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg" won the Golden Palm award at the 1964 Cannes film 
festival, but Demy never repeated its success despite the ambitious "Les 
Demoiselles de Rochefort" (The Young Girls of Rochefort), a similar picture 
that he directed two years later. Other films Demy directed and/or wrote in 
characteristic poetic style included "La Baie des Anges," "Peau d'Ane" and "The 
Pied Piper," filmed in Britain in 1972. He also made a film in the United 
States, "The Model Shop," which met with limited success. On Saturday in Paris 
of leukemia.

The Amazing Chain Saw Juggler of Venice Beach is working with automobiles these 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Selling them, not sawing them. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to grow," explained Robert Gruenberg, 31, proprietor of Uncle Bob's 
Park &amp; Sell in Redondo Beach. "You have to move on. . . . Besides, it's 
rather hard to juggle chain saws now, with only one hand." 
</P>
<P>
He was only kidding. Actually, Gruenberg felt underpaid during the eight years 
he performed his unique act on Venice's boardwalk, depending as he did on 
donations from passersby. And while he has appeared on the Johnny Carson show 
and still occasionally performs stand-up comedy with his power tools, the fact 
is he hasn't, well, cut it in the big time. 
</P>
<P>
He's the headliner, however, at Uncle Bob's. The name is spelled out in neon 
alongside a giant cardboard cowboy. Gruenberg rents out spaces to individuals 
who want to sell their cars. They leave 'em and he acts as a middleman. 
</P>
<P>
Neighboring used-car dealers are jealous of his low-overhead operation, he 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
"They go by and flip me off all the time," Uncle Bob said. 
</P>
<P>
He added: "But that's OK. I got a chain saw." 
</P>
<P>
Gruenberg's retirement has, of course, left a void at Venice Beach. Not to 
mention an opening in the lineup of street performers. 
</P>
<P>
It's only a coincidence, however, that police arrested a man over the weekend 
after he allegedly broke into a Department of Water and Power building and 
pilfered some chain saws. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was apprehended after he set off a burglar alarm. Police said he 
had two chain saws and three power drills in his possession. 
</P>
<P>
And he wasn't juggling any of them. 
</P>
<P>
In our Dueling Signs competition, Justin Fishbein nominates the Bunker Hills 
traffic light post at 3rd and Grand, which features a "Danger" notice just 
beneath the box that instructs pedestrians to "push button . . . for walk 
signal." L.A.'s pedestrians, a brave lot, mostly ignore the bottom sign, which 
has been there for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Latest anti-L.A. salvo comes from monologuist/actor Spalding Gray, who told a 
San Francisco audience: 
</P>
<P>
"Health is the new drug in L.A. You go there and everyone is ready, ready, 
ready! Nothing is happening, but they're ready!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nothing is happening in L.A.? In the last week alone, police have arrested the 
man with chain saws from a DWP yard, another who was speeding on freeways with 
a boa constrictor around his neck, and a woman who was standing nude in a 
Laundromat and waving a toy pistol. 
</P>
<P>
Like we always say at Only in L.A.: 
</P>
<P>
You give us 2.2 minutes and we'll give you the weird.

AL MARTINEZ: KICKING THE TEACH AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I had a teacher in the fourth grade named Calla Monlux who made me madder than 
hell. 
</P>
<P>
She was short and dumpy and wore flat-heeled shoes and read poetry to her 
classes, whether we liked it or not. 
</P>
<P>
She called me Alfie, which I detested, and kept me after school one day so I 
could prove to her I had written the essays I was turning in. 
</P>
<P>
She couldn't believe that a kid with a bad attitude and no sense of grammar 
could write prose, as she said, that caused dogs to howl. 
</P>
<P>
She sat me down in an empty room with a ticking clock after everyone else had 
gone home and said, "Write," so I wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Once convinced I hadn't hired a neighbor to write the essays for me, she kept 
me after school again several times to torture me with enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
She'd read Wordsworth's "Daffodils" aloud to me in a kind of quavery, 
high-pitched voice, and when she came to the part that had them "fluttering and 
dancing in the breeze," she'd stop and say, "All right, Alfie, now close your 
eyes and visualize!" 
</P>
<P>
I'd think, "Man, this is really a weird old lady." I was afraid to close my 
eyes because you never knew what a crazy person might do to a kid with his eyes 
closed. But I was also afraid not to, because Monlux had this fiery look in her 
eyes when she said, "Visualize!" 
</P>
<P>
She'd read some of the lines over and over, and one day something happened. I 
began to see those damned daffodils in my head, cast in gold, touched by the 
breezes that whisper down the sweet hillsides of poetry. 
</P>
<P>
She said, "Good for you, Alfie!" and hugged me. She taught me an essential of 
good writing: imagery. I owe that woman. 
</P>
<P>
Calla Monlux comes to mind because of another teacher who reminds me of her, 
not in looks, but in tone. This teacher is thinking of quitting the business in 
despair, and that makes me madder than hell too. 
</P>
<P>
She's Marjan Swantek, a gentle, soft-spoken person who has a kindergarten class 
in North Hollywood. Not long ago, she was attacked by a mother for scolding her 
5-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
The mother, 6 feet tall and 240 pounds, has pleaded no contest to felony 
assault and faces a year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Swantek, who is 64 and not exactly a street fighter, was badly shaken by the 
incident. She ducks behind doors now whenever she sees a big woman coming down 
a corridor at Toluca Lake Elementary, because, well, you never know. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of thing happens in high school or even junior high," she said to me 
the other day, "but elementary school? I had expected her to be angry, but I 
was never prepared for that." 
</P>
<P>
Swantek is the kind of teacher who doesn't do a lot of scolding. What she does 
mostly is try to teach self-esteem to little 5-year-olds who often don't have 
any. 
</P>
<P>
She hugs the kids at the start of each class and then has them hug each other, 
because we all need the feeling that someone cares, and what better place to 
instill warmth than there, at the beginning? 
</P>
<P>
The world can be dark and cold for a kid, and a teacher's hug can get him 
through a life. It's getting me through mine. 
</P>
<P>
I hate the idea that it might be taken from someone else. 
</P>
<P>
What rankles is not only the tempo of violence that plagues our schools, but 
that the abuse has come to this particular teacher, Marjan Swantek. 
</P>
<P>
She's a metaphor for what a guide ought to be, with a caring that extends 
beyond pay raises and fringe benefits, and centers on the kids themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an old-fashioned teacher," Swantek says with a laugh, but she's more than 
that. Listen. 
</P>
<P>
The only true love in her life died almost 35 years ago, and she's never 
remarried, because no one has ever measured up to the husband she had. 
</P>
<P>
She went into teaching, wrote a book and raised four sons on her own, who were 
ages 4 months to 6 years when their dad died. They've grown to become what she 
calls lovely men. 
</P>
<P>
The lessons she taught her own sons were the kind that motivated one of them, 
legally blind, to put himself through college. 
</P>
<P>
The kind of person she is and the kind of teacher she's become are both rare, 
and now we face losing her because teaching isn't worth being smashed and 
choked for. 
</P>
<P>
"It's happened to other teachers I've known," she says, "good teachers who 
couldn't take the violence. I never thought it would happen to me, but it has." 
</P>
<P>
Calla Monlux believed in hugs too. She embraced a kid with no dreams and lead 
him to a dazzling field of daffodils that have shone for him ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Marjan Swantek, by the same qualities, the same hugs, teaches love and 
self-worth. If violence drives her from teaching, we're all going to lose. 
</P>
<P>
There just aren't enough people hugging our kids anymore in an age that cries 
out for caring.

VOTER APATHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a long-time Democrat and a person who has donated hundreds of hours and 
dollars to the Democratic Party, I think that voter apathy stems primarily from 
the feeling that voters don't understand the effect of public policy as 
enunciated by the candidates for public office and as reflected in the 
initiatives. I believe that candidates for public office are for the most part 
very fine public servants and as good as or better than the general public as 
far as ethics and morality are concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, the TV ads distort the positions of candidates and initiatives. TV 
stations should follow up the ad with an analysis of the truth of the 
allegation and promote public understanding of rather complex issues. The 
voters have to be taught that they have a responsibility to develop good 
government by the example they make in their everyday lives. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with government is not the politicians but we the people who have 
been taught that life is nothing but a bowl of cherries. It will be the 
well-to-do and their selfish interests that will destroy this nation, not the 
poor, as so often alleged.

THE SYMBOLIC IMPORTANCE OF L 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mundane business of running a city provides few opportunities to make 
declarations on human rights. Next week, however, Angelenos will get a rare 
chance, when they vote on Charter Amendment L, the Anti-Apartheid Contracting 
Policy. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, Los Angeles adopted an historic law barring city contracts with 
firms that do business with South Africa. That ordinance has since become a 
model for other municipalities, and has been singled out for praise by 
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Nobel peace laureate, and other leading figures in 
the anti-apartheid movement. 
</P>
<P>
Current provisions of the Charter, however, have put 90% of municipal contracts 
beyond the reach of the original law. Those provisions require that all pacts 
with a value in excess of $25,000 must be put out for competitive bid and 
awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, contingent only on price and ability 
to perform. No other factors may be considered. 
</P>
<P>
Measure L would amend the Charter so that any bidder on any contract could be 
disqualified if the firm does business with Pretoria's racist regime. A number 
of carefully drawn exemptions are provided, including one for companies that 
are the sole provider of an essential good or service. City officials say L 
will have no impact on the quality or cost of contracts. 
</P>
<P>
As a rule, city governments ought not to involve themselves with issues of 
foreign policy, most of which are beyond the scope of their competence and 
legal mandate. The inescapable moral challenge posed by apartheid's persistent 
evil justifies an exception to that rule. Charter Amendment L gives Angelenos 
of every race and persuasion an opportunity to declare their continued 
solidarity with those South Africans who are so close to victory in their 
struggle against racism. 
</P>
<P>
Passage of L should not be read as a rebuff to the government of President 
Frederik W. de Klerk, which has made significant strides toward dismantling the 
system. It should be read as a reaffirmation that the people of Los Angeles 
have no intention of diminishing their opposition to apartheid until that 
crumbling system of racial oppression is ancient history.

COUNCIL RESOLUTION; 
</P>
<P>
LIABILITY CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has reaffirmed one of the basic and vital principles 
of international law: There must be no profit from aggression. Iraq has been 
reminded that it is liable "for any loss, damage or injury" stemming from its 
invasion and systematic plundering of Kuwait and from its mistreatment of 
Kuwaitis and third-country nationals. 
</P>
<P>
In calling specific attention to Baghdad's responsibility for war damages and 
human rights abuses in Kuwait, and in inviting states to begin collecting 
information on relevant claims, the council has paved the way for future 
actions that could well cost Iraq billions of dollars in damages. 
</P>
<P>
The council resolution, sponsored among others by the United States and the 
Soviet Union, doesn't specify how Iraq would pay to settle claims against it. 
British officials suggest that compensation could come from Iraq's foreign 
assets, most of which have been frozen as a result of its aggression. Working 
through the courts, unsatisfied claimants might also seek to attach other Iraqi 
property -- its future oil shipments, for example. 
</P>
<P>
The lengthy resolution, the 10th directed against Iraq since its invasion of 
Kuwait on Aug. 2, also calls for collecting information on Iraq's human rights 
abuses in Kuwait, a possible first step toward future war-crimes claims. 
Pillage, massacre and rape committed by a conquering power are as old as 
warfare itself. Only in this century have international conventions been 
enacted forbidding such outrages. Iraq has signed those agreements. The council 
has now laudably set the stage for calling it to account.

By TOM FLORES, TOM FLORES, general manager of the Seattle Seahawks, commented 
about the comparatively low numbers of American-born Latino athletes who move 
on to colleges and universities. He told The Times: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If these students were encouraged in some way to go on to college, then they 
would eventually excel in everything, including sports. But right now the 
problem is trying to get them to that point where they at least have the option 
of going to college after graduating from high school. 
</P>
<P>
A bigger question is, why aren't they graduating from high school? How to 
encourage them? I think it's a combination of everything. I didn't have that 
problem because I wanted to go on. But for a lot of my classmates, it was just 
a way of life -- not going on. We have to change that attitude. Attitude is 
very important, and until we change that, we're not going to have the rate of 
matriculation that we want in any ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
Attitude goes into the family and the culture, everywhere. And you don't change 
attitude in a short period of time, especially when it has become a way of 
life. Right now, I think the way of life for a lot of these kids is the gangs, 
and that's scary.

U.S. POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEBILITATION, ALONG WITH OIL SHOCKS FROM THE GULF

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even in the era of declining U.S. power and influence, any crisis that affects 
the United States has profound effects throughout the globe. When the United 
States experiences two crises simultaneously, the potential for ill effects 
elsewhere is doubled. Today, we see the process of governance and economic 
policy generating untractable political problems for the Bush Administration, 
the American political system and the increasingly unhealthy U.S. economy; at 
the same time, the Persian Gulf adventure defies happy endings and refuses to 
allow the United States a comfortable way out. The world watches and waits for 
some sort of denouement. It may be long in coming. 
</P>
<P>
Latin America, as always, suffers disproportionately from U.S. crises. The 
effects of the Iraqi invasion and the confrontation in the Persian Gulf vary, 
but the consequences of U.S. paralysis and economic woes are evenly and 
dramatically spread out in this Hemisphere. In some cases, the positive effects 
of a rise in the price of oil exports will be soon canceled out by the U.S. 
recession; in others the frightful implications of a rise in the price of oil 
imports will be compounded by the contraction of U.S. economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
The gulf crisis has divided Latin America into three groups: oil exporters, oil 
importers, and the few countries that are either virtually self-sufficient or 
export only marginally -- Colombia, Argentina, Peru and Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
In the first category -- Mexico, Venezuela, Ecuador and Trinidad -- the crisis 
has meant a windfall: almost a doubling of oil revenues thanks to the nearly 
100% increase in the price. In the case of Mexico and Venezuela, there is also 
a rise -- albeit modest -- in the volume of exports. For Mexico, this implies 
additional revenues of more than $350 million per month, reducing by more than 
half the country's monthly trade deficit. The serious difficulties that Mexico 
and, to a lesser degree, Venezuela were experiencing on their foreign accounts 
are thus alleviated at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is of course radically different for the oil importing nations. 
For Brazil, which imports nearly half a million barrels a day, the gulf crisis 
has meant that previous efforts to bring down inflation, while not terribly 
successful, are now in deep trouble. Although Brazil's trade balance continues 
to be in the black, its soaring bill for imported oil is beginning to draw down 
reserves. In Chile, monthly inflation has begun to rise again, seriously 
threatening President Patricio Alwyn's ambition of maintaining economic 
stability and growth while at the same time promoting social justice and 
democratic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The area most affected by the increase in oil prices is the one least prepared 
to deal with it: Central America and the Caribbean. Almost all of the Caribbean 
Basin's countries import practically their entire oil supply, and have no way 
of obtaining resources from abroad to pay the soaring costs. During the last 
two oil shocks -- 1973 and 1979 -- these economies were devastated, even though 
there was more money available to be recycled, and they were emerging from 
decades of growth. Now, after 10 years of stagnation, and in some cases civil 
war, they are hit again, and the burden may be unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
But a weakened American presidency and economy could have more negative effects 
in the long run; even the positive effects for the oil exporting countries 
could be rapidly wiped out. For Mexico, a U.S. recession spells catastrophe; it 
would bring a decline in Mexican exports, particularly in the manufacturing 
sector; the contraction or partial shutdown of the maquiladora industry along 
the border; which is totally oriented to the U.S. market; diminishing American 
funds available for investment; a drop in tourism, 85% of which comes from the 
United States, and a fall in remittances sent home by Mexican workers in the 
States, who will be among the first laid off or deported when the recession 
begins truly to bite. 
</P>
<P>
For countries like Nicaragua and Panama, which are still waiting for the payoff 
for their pro-U.S. attitudes, the U.S. recession coupled with the weakening of 
the Bush presidency could be a disaster, confirming their worst fears: the 
promised money will never come. In the case of other nations that need U.S. 
financing and support, be it because of political problems, as in El Salvador 
or Haiti, or due to drug considerations, as in Bolivia and Peru, the adjustment 
of the American economy could also have a highly negative impact. 
</P>
<P>
At a time of a major redefinition of nations' roles in the world, Latin America 
requires a clear idea of what the limits and possibilities of the United 
States' cooperation really are. Many of these governments have, either through 
conviction or expediency, implemented economic policies that were deemed 
necessary to attract investment, credits, trade and confidence, and without 
this external funding, these policies are condemned to fail. But the likelihood 
of obtaining that funding is shrinking day by day, as the United States has 
both less money, and, more important, less willingness and political strength 
to part with it. 
</P>
<P>
A positive, cooperative U.S. policy toward Latin America requires a strong 
America presidency, unburdened by excessive electoral concerns and governing a 
prosperous economy. Under Ronald Reagan, the ingredients were present, but not 
the policy. With George Bush, the United States seems to have the policy, or at 
least some reasonable ideas, but lacks the wherewithal to make it work. It 
would appear that the marriage of minds and means between the United States and 
Latin America is still far removed.

LIFE IMITATES PATHOLOGIES OF CULTURE;

<P>
IF GOOD ART IS ELEVATING, WHY DENY THAT BAD ART DEGRADES?

According to a jury of its peers, 2 Live Crew meets the community standards of 
Broward County, Fla. After listening to "He'll tear the (vagina) open 'cause 
it's satisfaction" and "Grabbed one by the hair, threw her on the floor, opened 
up her thighs and guess what I saw," jury foreman David Garsow of the Key 
Biscayne Presbyterian Church choir was unfazed. "Representing a cross-section 
of the community as we do," he declared, "we did not feel it was obscene." 
</P>
<P>
Broward County has thus confirmed what most of us know. Community standards, 
having adjusted to fit the culture, have reached a new low. Standards in 
publishing, for example, have hit so low that at Simon &amp; Schuster, reports 
Time, the publication of "American Psycho," Bret Easton Ellis's new novel, has 
left some editorial staff outraged. 
</P>
<P>
It is filled with such degrading violence and torture, particularly of women, 
that Ellis' past cover artist has refused to design this one. "I felt disgusted 
with myself for reading it," he said. Simon &amp; Schuster, unfazed, plans to 
"market it aggressively." 
</P>
<P>
That American popular culture is drenched in sex and violence and a degrading 
combination of the two is a truism. But it is then hard to understand the 
surprise that greets the resulting degradation and depravity of real life: 
savage "wilding" attacks by conscienceless kids, a quadrupling of rapes in 30 
years, random shootings of children in our cities (four in one eight-day period 
in New York), a doubling of the number of youths shot to death in the last six 
years alone. 
</P>
<P>
What happened to innocence? The number of 14- to 17-year-olds arrested today is 
30 times what it was in 1950. Every year, one in 10 teen-age girls gets 
pregnant. Teen suicides, now the second leading cause of death among 
adolescents, are double what they were 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
These signs of decay produce a general puzzlement. How did we get to such a 
pass? How? Well, culture has consequences. Life imitates art. Is it so hard to 
make a connection between culture and society? Most people, and in particular 2 
Live Crew's intellectual defenders, fervently believe in the connection between 
good art and the good society. If they did not think that good art is 
elevating, artists would not make it and the people would not support it. And 
yet the corollary -- if good art can elevate, then bad art can degrade -- is a 
proposition they refuse to grasp. 
</P>
<P>
Kids see 10,000 killings on TV by age 18. Is it any wonder that a growing 
number might like to commit just one? Sexual aggression and misogyny are a 
staple of rap. Is it any wonder that "wilders" should decide to try both out in 
Central Park? MTV is a nonstop masturbation fantasy. Is it any wonder that a 
generation of teens raised on it produces a million pregnancies every year? 
</P>
<P>
In order to deny the obvious, the social pathologies of American life are 
ascribed not to culture but to government: to spending cuts, lack of health 
care, insufficient sex education. As Bill Bennett said recently of a report 
cataloguing the growing agony of American adolescents: "The Code Blue report 
says the problem is behavior, not health . . . . Yet its major recommendations 
are health-service related (guaranteed access to health services and health 
instruction for teen-age students, for example). In other words, Code Blue 
identifies a crisis of the spirit, a sickness in the soul, and it recommends 
(in effect) aspirin, Band-Aids, and a hall pass to see the nurse." 
</P>
<P>
As a psychiatrist, I used to see psychotic patients who, urged on by voices 
inside their heads, did crazy and terrible things, like immolating themselves. 
Now we have legions of kids walking around with the technological equivalent: 2 
Live Crew wired by Walkman directly into their brains, proposing to "bust your 
(vagina) then break your backbone . . . . I wanna see you bleed." Surprised 
that a whole generation is busting and breaking and bleeding? Culture has 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
But hasn't mass culture always settled on the lowest common denominator? Yes, 
but the lowest common denominator is not what it used to be. There is no 
comparing the brutality and cynicism of today's pop culture to that of 40 years 
ago. From "High Noon" to "Robocop" is a long descent. 
</P>
<P>
And it is not just that we have never had a denominator so low. We have never 
had a culture so mass. In the past, a libertarianism that permitted everything 
to be said and done could at worst corrupt the intellectuals, a rather 
dispensable class. Today, no child escapes the assault of an omnivorous and 
omnipresent culture. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, no society had combined total liberty with mass culture, let alone 
with technology that hard-wires the stuff into the brain. History is therefore 
no guide as to what happens next. The mayhem in the streets, however, tells the 
story.

If voters impose Proposition 140's severe term-limits on the California 
Legislature, its members will have themselves to blame. They gerrymandered 
their districts so effectively during the 1980s that they made it extremely 
difficult for voters to displace them. 
</P>
<P>
Term limits are not a good answer to the problem, but voters now seem likely to 
seize on the proposal as their only way of throwing the rascals out. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of across-the-board term limits, the right reform would be to eliminate 
gerrymandering and to create districts in which both parties had a chance to 
win and voters had better opportunities to defeat incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
But repeated efforts to reform the redistricting process failed during the 
1980s. The Democratic legislative leadership -- with the quiet approval of some 
Republican legislators who like the status quo even if it means being the 
long-term minority party -- financed misleading campaigns that distorted the 
redistricting issues and hoodwinked voters into defeating reform initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
In their efforts to defeat Proposition 140, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and 
Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti have hired the same consulting team of 
Michael Berman and Carl D'Agostino, whose campaigns of deceit and distortion 
persuaded voters to turn down redistricting reform measures. It will be much 
harder to obfuscate the issues this time, however: Voters are much more likely 
to grasp the idea behind term limits -- throwing the rascals out, even if it 
has the unfortunate effect of throwing out some decent and useful lawmakers 
along with the rascals.

JACK SMITH: CHALLENGE MET: GOURMET MEAL JUST IN TIME FOR 'MURDER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have faced up to the challenge and prepared a dinner for me and my wife. 
</P>
<P>
I had noted here that my wife usually pops microwave dinners into the oven when 
she comes home from work, and we dine at TV trays while watching a 
sex-and-violence movie on television. 
</P>
<P>
Several women had written to suggest that I prepare dinner for a change, see 
what it's like, give my wife a rest. 
</P>
<P>
I do believe in the fair division of chores between husbands and wives, though 
I admit that we tend to fall into habit patterns. Historically, my wife has 
prepared dinner while I take care of other chores, such as turning on lights, 
checking the TV log and turning on television. 
</P>
<P>
I concede, however, that cooking dinner day after day can become a tedious 
chore, with diminishing rewards. Microwave dinners especially seem to have 
taken the challenge and the creativity out of cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Having my wife's 1,000 cookbooks to choose from, I had no trouble finding a 
promising recipe. It was in "Gourmet Cooking for Two," by Beatrice Ojakangas, 
an expert in Finnish cookery. It was lamb chops with gjetost sauce. For one 
thing, if I was going to cook dinner, I wanted it to be nothing less than 
gourmet quality. Also, since I was cooking for two, a recipe for two seemed 
prudent. 
</P>
<P>
It called for the following ingredients: 
</P>
<P>
2 large lamb chops, 1 1/2 to 2 inches thick 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon salad oil or olive oil 
</P>
<P>
salt and freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon oregano 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup shredded Norwegian gjetost 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup sour cream 
</P>
<P>
1/8 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
That didn't seem too difficult. My wife said she had oregano, ground pepper, 
sour cream and, of course, salt. All I had to buy was the pork chops and the 
gjetost. I had never heard of gjetost. Mrs. Ojakangas said, "Shredded gjetost 
(available in the cheese section of many supermarkets), this brownish goat's 
milk cheese comes from Norway." 
</P>
<P>
My wife said she might be able to get some at a Scandinavian deli near her 
place of business. I went to Bristol Farms in South Pasadena for the lamb 
chops. The butcher asked me what kind I wanted. I don't know one lamb chop from 
another. I pointed to a pair that seemed thick enough. They came to $5.46, 
which I thought excessive. (I doubt that I had ever previously bought lamb 
chops in my life.) 
</P>
<P>
My wife brought home some gjetost, but it was not shredded. It was creamy, with 
the viscosity of paste. It tasted sweet. "It will probably do," my wife said. 
</P>
<P>
I measured the chops. They were only 1 1/4 inches thick. My wife said, "Those 
look like shoulder chops. How much did you pay for them? 
</P>
<P>
I told her $5.46. 
</P>
<P>
"No wonder," she said. 
</P>
<P>
So I had started out badly by buying cheap chops. And the gjetost was the wrong 
kind. However, I was determined to go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately it was Sunday afternoon, and my wife was home. I didn't want her to 
do any of the work, but I thought she might help me with the ingredients. She 
got out the oregano, pepper, sour cream and olive oil and placed them on the 
counter. 
</P>
<P>
As directed, I rubbed the chops with oil, sprinkled on salt, pepper and 
oregano, and put them in a frying pan over moderate heat. Meanwhile, I stirred 
the gjetost and sour cream together and heated until they were blended in a 
creamy sauce. 
</P>
<P>
When the chops were done I put them on plates, poured the sauce over them and 
served. Meanwhile, my wife had made salad. I didn't want to be distracted by 
salad while I was preparing the main dish. 
</P>
<P>
I got the dinners on the TV trays just in time for "Murder, She Wrote." The 
meat was tough, but altogether the dish was palatable, if not gourmet. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very good," my wife said, evidently wanting not to discourage me in what 
she must have considered a step in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
"What shall I do with the plates?" I asked her, thinking that cleaning up was 
probably part of the drill. 
</P>
<P>
"Put them on the counter," she said. "I'll give the bones to the dog." 
</P>
<P>
I don't know why we watch "Murder, She Wrote." Maybe it's because it's on at 8 
o'clock and the real sex-and-violence movies don't come on until 9. Not that 
"Murder, She Wrote" doesn't have sex and violence. But it's all rather upper 
class. It never dips into the sordid milieu of the streets. And almost 
invariably the murderer, imagining himself trapped in what is nothing but a 
flimsy web of circumstantial evidence, confesses. 
</P>
<P>
Now that I've proved I can, I plan to cook dinner again. Next time I think I'll 
try the tamale casserole from "The Great California Lifestyle Cookbook" 
(Lawry's Foods Inc.). That sounds like a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, I didn't know what to do with the frying pan, so I left it.

49-Week Vacation: "The Killing Man," Mickey Spillane's first Mike Hammer 
detective novel in 19 years, is hitting bookstores. Spillane knows exactly what 
he's going to say when he sits down to write his best-selling crime novels, and 
in three weeks, the job is done and he takes the rest of the year off. And 
Spillane, 72, is not hesitant in telling critics where to go. "If you're 
satisfying a market, that's the barometer of good writing, if you are making 
money at it," he said Sunday night in Savannah, Ga.

Legal Wrangles: Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia will preside at the 
opening session of what is being called the "Woodstock of Lawyering." Powerful, 
self-confident trial lawyers will gather for a display of courtroom skills Nov. 
9 and 10 at the Moot Courtroom at the Georgetown University Law Center in 
Washington, D.C. Combatants will include Brendan (Potted Plant) Sullivan, 
lawyer to convicted Iran-Contra figure Oliver North; Howard L. Weitzman, who 
persuaded a jury to acquit car maker John DeLorean, and Richard (Racehorse) 
Haynes, the colorful Texas criminal lawyer.

Prize: Poet James Merrill was named Sunday the first winner of a national prize

National Prize for Poetry, which includes a cash award of $10,000, is in 
recognition of the most distinguished book of poetry written by an American and 
published during the past two years. Merrill's winning book is "The Inner 
Room," published in 1988.

Kerrey Missing: Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.), missed out on a chance for some good 
exposure in his home state. Kerrey was the subject of a profile in last week's 
issue of Time magazine but, because of an error at a printing plant in 
Wisconsin, the pages about Kerrey were missing from the magazines that were 
distributed in Nebraska.

YOUR BODY: HOME CLIMBERS' FITNESS OPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forget workout fatigue, that tired but smug after-exercise glow. These days, 
you can get tired just awaiting a turn at your health club's stair-climbing 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
Long lines to use these exercise machines are typical but understandable. In as 
little as 20 minutes, you can improve both heart health and muscle tone. But 
there is a time limit on how long you can use the machines imposed at some 
gyms. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the boom in home stair-climbing machines. A dozen or so manufacturers 
are offering versions for home use, some selling for less than $100 and others 
with price tags of $3,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
But does higher cost mean better quality? And how can consumers separate frill 
features from necessities? 
</P>
<P>
There are no hard-and-fast rules about how much to spend. But don't buy too 
low, advised Dr. Bob Goldman, an osteopathic physician who directs the 
nonprofit High Technology Fitness Research Institute in Chicago. He has 
evaluated numerous climbing machines designed for health club and home use. 
</P>
<P>
"If you spend less than $400 on a home stair-climbing unit, you will end up 
with a unit that won't last very long," said Goldman. But others say that 
minimum is too low; some advise consumers to invest at least $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the cost, stability is one of the most important features for such 
machines, experts agree. "When you stand on the machine," Goldman said, "be 
sure it is stable before you buy." 
</P>
<P>
"Look for a machine that allows a natural stair-climbing posture," added 
Michael Hoffman, spokesman for Life Fitness Inc., a stair-climbing machine 
manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
"Look for feedback features," said Goldman. Some machines, for example, can 
compute your actual effort versus your goal effort. Computer displays can also 
tell users the number of flights climbed, the duration of exercise and the 
total calories expended. (But calorie expenditure shouldn't be taken as gospel, 
Goldman said, noting that the figures are based on norms.) 
</P>
<P>
The most popular feedback features among exercisers are computations of 
calories expended, floors climbed or miles walked, said Rich Hansen, spokesman 
for the StairMaster climbing machine. 
</P>
<P>
Once you've found your dream machine, plan to use it at least 20 minutes three 
times a week, Goldman said. Maintaining good form is vital to achieve the best 
results, Goldman said. "Don't lean too far forward. Keep your body in a natural 
stair climbing mode." 
</P>
<P>
Done properly, stair-climbing is a good, overall workout, Goldman said. "It's a 
good way to burn calories as well as tone the lower body, especially the 
hamstrings (back of thigh muscles) and buttocks." 
</P>
<P>
How you step depends on your goal, Goldman added. "Shorter, rapid steps are 
safer. But long, slow steps train more muscles. You should see the effects of 
muscle building in three or four weeks."

CITY LIFE: A MOSTLY UNNOTICED DRAMA IS PLAYED OUT DAILY BY DOWN-AND-OUTERS WHO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Broadway steps of Robinson's downtown department store are front-row seats 
to live theater. 
</P>
<P>
The stage is historic, palm-lined Horton Plaza Park, but the play is not a 
popular one with its themes of despair, desperation, violence, addiction and 
homelessness. The would-be audience of office workers and shoppers hardly 
glances at the show. They skirt around it as though it were not there. 
</P>
<P>
Many wish it were not. City officials and downtown business interests are 
taking steps to ensure that the production will soon end its long run in city 
center. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego City Council voted Oct. 8 to remove benches from the historic 
site and replace the grass with shrubs and flowers to discourage loitering. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an experiment, a tall order," admitted Ted Medina, a district manager 
with the San Diego Park and Recreation Department. "And, if it doesn't work, if 
it doesn't make Horton Plaza more attractive and more accessible to the general 
public, everything will be put back the way it is now." 
</P>
<P>
The following portrait of Horton Plaza Park comes from a day spent on the front 
row and inside the production that plays only to itself: 
</P>
<P>
9 a.m. -- The Victorian fountain, centerpiece of the small plaza, glimmers in 
the strong morning sun of a Santa Ana day. Its soothing spray of water muffles 
the steady traffic on Broadway. A husky park employee with a no-nonsense 
attitude, keys jangling at her side and a walkie-talkie stuffed in her back 
trouser pocket, hoses down the tile walkway that crisscrosses the small plaza. 
</P>
<P>
About 25 people lounge on the benches that ring the park and line the walkways 
that join at the fountain. Each of the 18 benches is occupied, mostly by men 
who are either sleeping or sitting quietly. Nobody is on the grass. The men 
hardly shift their positions as the park employee directs the jet of water from 
her hose under their feet. Only one barefoot man, in dirty black polo shirt and 
trousers, stands out, animatedly talking and gesturing to himself, oblivious to 
his surroundings. The mood is desultory, static, a sharp contrast to the city 
bustle. 
</P>
<P>
Stylish men and women, apparently late for work, rush around the plaza to reach 
their jobs. Within an hour, only two actually cross through the plaza itself. 
Each assiduously avoids the faces of the bench-warmers. 
</P>
<P>
10 a.m. -- Robinson's opens for business. Women shoppers begin to stream up the 
steps. Two men with long beards and long hair, looking like down-and-out 
cowboys in their flannel shirts, denim jeans, vests and hats, are arguing. They 
look to be in their early 40s. One suddenly jumps up and screams a string of 
epithets that carries to the Robinson's steps. Nobody pays attention to the 
outburst, and the man sits down again, taking a swig from a bottle in a brown 
bag. 
</P>
<P>
Two spit-shined police officers with crew cuts stroll into the plaza from the 
western end. They seem relaxed and accustomed to patrolling this beat. One of 
them spends 15 minutes talking to a man with close-cropped gray hair and 
dressed in white shorts and T-shirt. The officer finally hands him a pink slip, 
apparently a citation for drinking in public, pours out the remains from a beer 
can and tosses it in the trash. The police do the same with the cowboys sitting 
at the eastern end of the park. They ignore those who are sleeping, banter 
casually with those awake. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure has a familiar, routine air. The park occupants take no more 
notice of the police than they do of the pigeons that are still the only ones 
on the grass. 
</P>
<P>
11 a.m. -- The park employee continues to clean the plaza, scrubbing walkways, 
planters and benches with a long-handled bristle broom. It is a morning-long 
job. Everyone moves out of her industrious path this time; no more than 20 
remain in the park. Three men are on the grass, one sleeping, one lounging with 
his head propped in his hand and another sitting on a plastic bag against one 
of the willowy palms, studying a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Like a prima donna commanding a stage, a woman in a lace wedding gown with a 
long red scarf draped around her neck enters from the west, striding slowly 
across the plaza. Her black skin is covered with a white substance, giving her 
face a gray aspect. Her discolored skin and strange, slow walk at first make 
her seem like a very old woman, but watching her more closely reveals she is 
hardly middle age. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody pays attention to her entrance. They ignore her as she gestures with her 
fingers to her lips to indicate she wants a cigarette. She does not speak. 
</P>
<P>
Failing to cadge a smoke, she stops beside one of the planter urns that sprout 
dwarf palms and removes a pair of black trousers from under her floor-length 
dress. She slings them over her shoulder and continues her promenade and 
pantomime requests for a cigarette. When someone finally gives her one, she 
nods her head and slowly makes her way back into the city streets from the east 
end of the park. 
</P>
<P>
Her costume is the most dramatic, but many wear them. 
</P>
<P>
One man wears boxy black shorts with knit leggings and height-of-fashion ankle 
boots. Another wears a white athletic outfit, including a forehead sweatband, 
and a gray suit coat. A young, slim bleached-blond woman has on a white 
strapless semi-formal dress and spike heels. 
</P>
<P>
If you were to look only at the outfits, you wouldn't be able to tell if you 
were in New England or Southern California. A man on one bench dozes in a 
turtleneck and trench coat worn like a cape, while the man next to him is 
bare-chested. It is as much a parade of style -- albeit different -- outside 
Robinson's as within. 
</P>
<P>
Noon -- The park fills up again at midday. But not with the professionals, 
office workers or shop help who begin to appear again on the streets. They 
stride determinedly around the perimeter of the plaza on errands and in search 
of lunch. Some scurry up the steps into Robinson's, casting furtive looks. Two 
or three pairs of tourists with cameras venture into the park to photograph the 
fountain. An impeccably groomed, silver-haired man in a suit marches through 
the plaza, shooting looks of disgust at those on the benches. 
</P>
<P>
Not one of them brings lunch to eat in the sunny plaza with the only patches of 
grass in center city. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the park is quite crowded now, at least 40 people are within it, mostly 
young and middle-aged men, in what appears to be a cross-section of races -- 
black, white, Hispanic, Asian. Most of the younger men cluster at the eastern 
end, at 4th Avenue and Broadway. The cluster attracts a stream of other younger 
people, casually but cleanly dressed. There are short conversations; money 
exchanges hands and they go on their way. 
</P>
<P>
It is as though an invisible wall, or an unspoken covenant, prevents the 
downtown workers and shoppers from crossing into the Horton Plaza park. The 
Horton Plaza they frequent is the multi-colored shopping center that goes by 
the same name. 
</P>
<P>
The mind's eye can visualize people in business suits and bright dresses 
picnicking on the plaza lawns, ignored like almost everything else by the 
regulars on the benches. They will be having lunch there soon, if Centre City 
Assn. plans go through. Only it will be at private lunch concessions placed 
around the plaza whose tables and chairs will be available only to paying 
patrons, according to Medina of the city Park and Recreation Department. 
</P>
<P>
1 p.m. -- It is hot even in the shade of Robinson's steps. The mood of boredom 
that hangs over the plaza is heavy. Some have been here since early morning. 
Others who left have returned. They switch benches, stand up and stretch, take 
short strolls to break the monotony of the long, hot day. 
</P>
<P>
A tall, shirtless man with weightlifter pectorals and a slim waist stops 
circling the park to drop down on the grass and do 50 push-ups in one minute. 
</P>
<P>
A middle-aged man with long brown hair and beard, wearing a cap that says 
Vietnam Veterans of San Diego, pushes a shopping cart through the plaza. People 
stop him to buy cigarettes for $1 a pack. He can sell them for half the market 
price because they are bought cheap in Mexico, someone explains. 
</P>
<P>
It becomes clear that the people in the park know each other well. Those who 
leave the park for a while ask bench neighbors to watch their gear, bedrolls 
and backpacks. Everyone bums cigarettes from each other, even if they have a 
pack in a shirt pocket. Most acquiesce to the requests; it appears a breach of 
park etiquette to refuse. 
</P>
<P>
A panhandler approaches Robinson's, the only one to do so in four hours; a 
small, older, toothless man. 
</P>
<P>
"Lady, I'm sorry to disturb you reading, but I wonder if you might have a 
little money to give me." 
</P>
<P>
When he is refused apologetically, he responds genuinely, "I'm sorry, too!" and 
saunters away, saying, "Have a wonderful life!" 
</P>
<P>
Another man approaches, perhaps in his mid-40s, robustly healthy with dark 
curly hair and a bushy mustache. 
</P>
<P>
"I was evicted today," he announces. "But I'm going to fight it. Tenants have 
rights, too, you know, they have a right not to pay!" He laughs at his own 
joke. 
</P>
<P>
"What are you reading?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
When he learns it is the diary of Anais Nin, he critiques her writing. 
</P>
<P>
"I've liked some of her poetry," he says. "And what she's written about the 
fantasies of women. I always like to get the female perspective on things." 
</P>
<P>
He is silent for a few moments, absorbed in his Marlboro. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't that amazing I knew what you were reading when I didn't even see the 
title?" he says. 
</P>
<P>
He's reminded that he was told the title. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh," he says sheepishly. "Well, it would have been amazing!" 
</P>
<P>
The conversation on the Robinson's steps is cut short as four officers enter 
the plaza, the two with crew cuts who patrolled earlier, and a new pair. The 
man with the mustache carefully watches their progress. Again, the officers do 
not disturb the sleepers, but ask a few men who are standing near the fountain 
and sitting beside the planters to move on. 
</P>
<P>
Then, they approach Robinson's. 
</P>
<P>
"Folks," one tells the few people who have gathered there in the shade, "The 
store wants these stairs for people to go into the store, not to sit in front 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone moves away quietly, without protest. 
</P>
<P>
2 p.m. -- Back on the benches, small dramas are taking place, heated 
conversations, arguments. The cluster of mostly young Latinos at 4th and 
Broadway attracts even more comers. A black man on a bench says they are drug 
dealers. A handsome young Mexican couple, agitation and worry on their faces, 
approaches the group. After half an hour in its midst, they leave, smiling and 
relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
A young Mexican family joins the group. The woman is pregnant and smokes 
constantly; the man plays with a child, who looks no older than 4. Others play 
with the boy, too, but he strikes back angrily when they grab him roughly 
around the neck and jostle him. He goes back to his mother, smoking on the 
walkway, and lays his head on the curb, sighing. They stay there for most of 
the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
A Carl's Jr. employee in checked apron and cap storms into the park with a man, 
probably her husband, from the fast-food restaurant across the street that the 
bench regulars frequent. The man screams at a thin young woman whose front 
teeth are chipped and blackened, claiming he will beat up her boyfriend the 
next time his wife is threatened. The swearing tirade goes on for at least 10 
minutes, the young woman silent throughout. When the burly couple finally 
leaves, the girl tells her neighbor she doesn't know what her boyfriend did to 
cause the offense. 
</P>
<P>
3 p.m. -- Two crisply dressed evangelists are belting out gospel songs and 
sermons, passing out leaflets to the disinterested congregation. Perhaps 
inspired by the spirituals, two men and a woman, whose ankles are so swollen 
she appears to walk in pain, sing a Barry White song in harmony. Their tenor, 
alto and bass voices are strong, rich and full. The bass wears a long hunting 
knife in a knee holster. Beside them, people sit, some bent over, heads in 
hands, or staring into space; others read newspapers and heavy-metal music 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Shopping center security officers appear on the Robinson's steps, standing 
there as though guarding the only available shade from loiterers. A young woman 
with a Nordstrom bag sits on a bench to have a quick cigarette before walking 
on, the only shopper in the park all day. 
</P>
<P>
A fight nearly begins over a beer. One man passes out almost all the cans from 
a 12-pack, but refuses a tall black man with reddish hair and green eyes, whose 
fist and arm are bandaged. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I'm family, man, gimmee one!" the tall man pleads. 
</P>
<P>
"Ain't giving you nothin'; you shouldn't a hit my man so hard. Put him in the 
hospital, man, you ain't gettin nothin." 
</P>
<P>
"He drew blood first, wasn't my fault, I was drunk." 
</P>
<P>
"Was your fault, you shouldn't a hit him like that, knocked him out cold." 
</P>
<P>
"Hey man, you guys are family," another man pipes up. He looks like Harpo Marx 
with a too-small hat perched on top of thick blonde curls. "When the Japanese 
invade, it's going to be a whole different story around here, so you'd best 
hang tight." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a young Asian man beside him struggles to finish the quarter-inch 
remains of a marijuana cigarette by rolling a longer piece of paper around it 
as a makeshift cigarette holder. 
</P>
<P>
4 p.m. -- The argument, apparently over a fight the night before that put one 
man unconscious in the hospital, escalates until both of them suddenly rise to 
their feet, spit on the ground, and raise fists. Those sitting nearby wipe off 
the spit the wind carries into their faces and try to ignore the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
The tall man walks away, the other returns to the bench to finish his beer. He 
takes one swig when a blonde in a short skirt walks briskly down the walkway, 
calling to no one in particular: "One, one alone . . . one, one coming." 
</P>
<P>
Immediately, the drinkers stash their beers in the planters, in trash cans, in 
their packs and bags. Moments later, a short, stocky police sergeant appears, 
greeting many by name. He banters with the park people, joking that the new 
jail being built at Otay Mesa will have plenty of room. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what the plaza is like at night, the sergeant grins ironically. 
</P>
<P>
"Fights, drugs, beatings, robberies," he says. "It's rough. We had a man killed 
here a couple of months ago, stabbed three times." 
</P>
<P>
The man who nearly had the fight over the beer he bought nods in assent while 
the sergeant talks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice right now, quiet," he says. "But you gotta see it at night -- 
there's a lot of violence; I seen it." 
</P>
<P>
5 p.m. -- The sun lowers in the sky, downtown workers head home. The sergeant 
has just left too. New faces appear; the crowd around the supposed drug deals 
grows larger. The feel is different, more tension in the air, more comings and 
goings, as though the plaza is steeling itself for the evening and the long, 
dark night. 
</P>
<P>
The ominous note is echoed by the man with the beer, clearly angry over the 
news he read in the paper that the benches will soon be removed and the grass 
stripped away. 
</P>
<P>
"This place is the Central, man, ain't no place else to sit in the sun," he 
complains. 
</P>
<P>
"You just wait and see what happens when they do it," he warns, lowering his 
voice. "You just wait and see."

Protesters against U.S. involvement in the Middle East burned flags and 
vandalized a fast-food restaurant here Monday, and police arrested 61 
demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
At least 200 protesters had gathered outside the Pacific Stock Exchange by 6 
a.m., said police Sgt. Bob Crosat. 
</P>
<P>
They were met by between 100 and 200 officers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters chanted and carried signs, but the mood changed when the crowd 
headed for Market Street, he said. Trouble began after demonstrators arrived at 
a McDonald's restaurant, Crosat said. 
</P>
<P>
"They broke tables and windows and scattered food around," said Police Sgt. Bob 
Crosat. A couple of American flags were burned during the 2 1/2-hour protest. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-one demonstrators were arrested for investigation of misdemeanor charges 
that included failure to disperse at an unlawful assembly, vandalism and 
trespassing, police said.

CASINO TARGETED IN CRIMINAL INQUIRY FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY; 
</P>
<P>
GAMBLING: THE HUNTINGTON PARK FIRM TAKES THE ACTION JUST AS THE COUNTY MOVES TO 
COLLECT $400,000 IN BACK TAXES AND PENALTIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A small Huntington Park casino, the target of a criminal investigation, filed 
for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Act just as county 
officials moved to collect $400,000 in delinquent property taxes and penalties, 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Park Club Operations, Ltd., part owner and operator of the 
Huntington Park Casino, owes its 20 largest creditors $610,382, according to 
the bankruptcy petition filed Friday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The petition did not list the back taxes owed to the county. 
</P>
<P>
The club is the subject of an investigation by sheriff's detectives into 
alleged skimming of profits and violation of the minimum wage law. However, the 
bankruptcy filing will likely have no impact on the probe. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Park Casino, which opened in 1984, accumulated the property tax debt 
over the past five years, said Deputy County Counsel Martha E. Romero. 
</P>
<P>
Romero said county officials have tried for several years to get the tax matter 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
They notified casino management last week that they planned, on Monday to begin 
an inventory the casino's possessions, including gaming tables and cash 
registers, and seize them as collateral, Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
The county would have had the right to sell the casino's possessions if the tax 
bill went unpaid, but Romero said she wanted to work out a payment plan with 
casino officials. 
</P>
<P>
Casino general manager and president Curtis J. Fresch and casino attorney 
Brendan P. Brady did not return calls for comment on the bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we'll have to go through bankruptcy petition and procedures under Chapter 
11," Romero said. "This has been going on for five years." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the delinquent taxes, the casino's debt includes more than $340,000 
in legal fees owed to various lawyers and $27,250 for accounting services, 
according to bankruptcy papers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Huntington Park officials on Monday were trying to figure out what 
the bankruptcy action would mean to the city. Huntington Park owns the land on 
which the card club is located. It leases the land for 8% of the casinos's 
gambling revenues. That amounted to $319,678 last year, according to city 
records, a sizable amount of money for a small city with a general fund budget 
of about $10 million. A casino employee, who declined to give his name, said 
the casino was open for business Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it would affect (city revenues) at this time," Councilman Raul 
Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
Donald L. Jeffers, the city's chief administrative officer, said the casino has 
been making its lease payments to Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
Revenues at the Huntington Park Casino have declined from 1986, when the city's 
share was more than twice was it was last year. The casino always has had 
difficulty competing for customers with the larger, and more conveniently 
located Bicycle Club in Bell Gardens and the Commerce Casino in the City of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Park Casino's problems grew earlier this month, when Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's detectives identified casino management as the target of a 
criminal investigation. They searched and removed records on Oct. 10 from the 
casino, a nearby business and a casino attorney's office. No arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives are trying to determine whether the casino's management, including 
Curtis Fresch, were underreporting gambling profits and violating minimum wage 
laws, according to an affidavit for search warrants. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Zoe Grillas said the investigation is continuing. No charges have 
been filed. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Jack W. Parks, who frequents the casino's restaurant and bar, said 
the investigation probably has contributed to the financial problems that 
prompted the bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not surprised with the clamp down that's happened," Parks said. "I know 
it's hampered their business."

PEOPLE: EX-GOLFER NOT PUT OUT TO PASTURE -- HE'S LAWN BOWLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The way Claude (Tag) Taggert figures it, lawn bowling has been sort of a 
lifesaver for him. 
</P>
<P>
He's a longtime physical-fitness buff whose pastimes such as golf and tennis 
were curtailed by asthma. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago when a doctor suggested that Taggert join him in lawn bowling, "I 
told him I was too young for it." 
</P>
<P>
But two years ago Taggert decided it was a game for him, and the 78-year-old 
Costa Mesa man, who once set a world record in the high jump, now admits, "I 
wish I had started it then." 
</P>
<P>
The onetime Indiana farm boy set the world's record in the Senior Olympics in 
the 70 to 75 age group. "I had just turned 70, so I had a lot more youth going 
for me than the rest of the competitors," he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
His jump of 4 feet, 8 inches, eclipsing the old mark by half an inch, has since 
been broken. 
</P>
<P>
Taggert admits he was not a star athlete or close to it during his college days 
at Ball State University, where he played basketball and competed in track and 
field events, including the high jump. 
</P>
<P>
"But I was always involved in sports," said the physical education major, who 
placed a high priority on his spiritual beliefs after getting asthma. 
</P>
<P>
In those early days, "I learned that keeping fit and eating the right kind of 
food helped keep a person healthy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So during his years as a high school coach, a Navy officer in World War II and 
a salesman after that, Taggert kept himself fit with rigorous sports until a 
few years back when asthma got a grip on him. 
</P>
<P>
Now Taggert is trying to lure others into lawn bowling, especially younger men. 
"You know, guys in their 50s and 60s," teased the Newport Harbor Lawn Bowling 
Club member. 
</P>
<P>
He points out that the United States is far behind other countries in promoting 
lawn bowling as a sport. "In new Zealand, they have a lot of young players," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
To do his part in developing players, Taggert has been teaching lawn bowling at 
the Newport Harbor Lawn Bowling Club in Corona del Mar under the sponsorship of 
Coastline Community College. 
</P>
<P>
"Lawn bowling is a game that's very popular in the rest of the world, 
especially in the British Commonwealth, but relatively unknown in the United 
States," he said. "College students only know it as a game played by seniors. 
That image would change if they would just try the sport." 
</P>
<P>
It appears that message is coming across, since 31 bowlers of various ages were 
attracted to a nine-week course that started in September. 
</P>
<P>
Besides playing, the students learn the history of the game, rules, etiquette, 
scoring method, team play and strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Taggert admits that while he was a "pretty good golfer" with an eight handicap, 
he's just a fairly good bowler. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of bowlers are better than me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bowling is more than competition, he said. "It's the greatest therapy for 
someone getting older because it keeps their joints and muscles flexible." 
</P>
<P>
But he adds that the game is also "challenging, interesting and more exciting 
than it looks." 
</P>
<P>
Don Boisseranc is in the custom house business, but for dogs. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people want me to make the doghouse match their own house with 
windows and tile roofs," said the Newport Beach man who calls his fledgling 
business Pedigree Estates. 
</P>
<P>
When he isn't contracting for dog houses he works in his cleverly named Corona 
BeFORE AND AFTer Marine Service. 
</P>
<P>
Like custom luxury homes, custom dog houses bear hefty price tags. 
</P>
<P>
They usually range from $350 to $750, although he once duplicated a client's 
house for the owner's dog at a cost of $1,500.

LTV Corp.: The steel and aircraft-technology firm reported a $30.4-million net 
loss for the third quarter, contrasted with net income of $85.7 million a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas-based firm cited "a significant decline in operating results and 
lower interest earnings" for the loss. The 1989 quarter included $42 million in 
income from an investment in a stainless steel-producing company, as well as 
higher interest income. Sales declined 4% to $1.45 billion.

Manville Corp.: The international manufacturing and natural resources company 
posted third-quarter earnings of $24.5 million, down 39% from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Sales totaled $576 million, a gain of 5%. The Denver firm attributed the 
results in part to its acquisition of Visypack Pty. Ltd., a leading producer of 
lithographic folding cartons in Australia. The company also noted an expense of 
$4.8 million for professional fees because of the restructuring of funding for 
the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust.

FIRM HOPES CLEAN-AIR LAWS WILL BOOST SALES; 
</P>
<P>
GLENDALE: STRUGGLING POLLUTION RESEARCH AND CONTROL CORP. EXPECTS LEGISLATION 
TO INCREASE DEMAND FOR ITS EMISSIONS MONITORING DEVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pollution Research and Control Corp. is a tiny Glendale company that makes 
devices for monitoring air pollution. Since it was founded in 1971, its success 
in the U.S. market had been limited, so in 1988 Pollution Research turned to 
overseas markets -- particularly South Korea -- which recently have accounted 
for more than half of its sales. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the Korean market has proved an unsteady one for Pollution 
Research, and in the year that ended June 30, the company lost $1.45 million on 
$5.4 million in revenues. Not only were South Korean sales slipping, the same 
was true for domestic sales. 
</P>
<P>
But with President Bush expected to sign the new federal clean-air legislation, 
which aims to free the nation's skies of smog and other harmful forms of 
pollution by early in the next century, Pollution Research stands to 
participate in what could be a bonanza for companies that make pollution 
control and measurement products. These products will be needed by government 
agencies and factories to measure emissions of sulfur dioxide and other 
pollutants from smokestacks and in the surrounding air. 
</P>
<P>
"We see a very positive impact," said Albert E. Gosselin Jr., Pollution 
Research's president and chief executive. Gosselin estimated that the 
legislation could result over the next year in a more than $2-million jump in 
the company's sales. 
</P>
<P>
Gosselin said specific provisions in the legislation that will most directly 
help his company are those concerning acid rain. Pollution Research's monitors 
measure sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen -- two of the key components of 
acid rain. Most of the electronic devices are about the size and shape of 
stereo receivers, cost $4,000 to $18,000, and analyze gases using ultraviolet 
light. 
</P>
<P>
Pollution Research hopes to sell more products to its traditional customers -- 
mostly utilities and government agencies such as the California Air Resources 
Board -- which will need the devices to monitor compliance with the new 
emissions standards. Orders may also come from consulting companies that buy 
the equipment on behalf of manufacturers, Gosselin said. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts agree that the clean-air legislation could be a boon for 
companies in the $50 million-a-year domestic air pollution monitoring business. 
"We're not just talking 20% or 30% growth here," said Stephen Schweich of Alex 
Brown &amp; Sons in Baltimore. "The market for emissions monitoring systems is 
going to expand geometrically," Schweich said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Pollution Research also stands to benefit if Proposition 128 -- 
the "Big Green" initiative -- is passed by California voters next month. Big 
Green's clean-air provisions are even more stringent than those contained in 
the federal legislation. 
</P>
<P>
But John G. Taylor, an analyst at L.H. Alton &amp; Co. in San Francisco, 
cautioned that the clean-air legislation is still no guarantee that Pollution 
Research will manage a turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because the stage is set doesn't mean business is going to start walking 
in the door," Taylor said. "It's a question of executing a marketing plan and 
getting in front of enough people. I think the jury is still out as to whether 
they can do that." 
</P>
<P>
Pollution Research's track record has been spotty. Founded in 1971 by Gosselin, 
a mechanical engineer, Pollution Research (formerly named Dasibi Environmental 
Corp.) made a disastrous 1973 investment in a Colorado cattle ranch, from which 
it took the company several years to recover. The company has also fought an 
uphill, mostly losing, battle against its two biggest competitors. 
</P>
<P>
That's partly because the two competitors have the resources of large 
corporations to draw from. Massachusetts-based Thermo Instrument Systems is a 
division of Thermo Electron, which has annual sales of $400 million. Lear 
Siegler, a $2.5-billion concern, has a Colorado division that makes pollution 
monitoring equipment. 
</P>
<P>
To compete for contracts against its big rivals, Pollution Research more than 
doubled its staff to 86 workers from June to December of last year. But 
Gosselin said the increased overhead came at a time when domestic orders for 
pollution monitoring equipment started to slow as companies waited to see what 
the final clean-air legislation would contain. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, orders from South Korea's equivalent of the Environmental Protection 
Agency, a big Pollution Research customer, also started to dry up. 
</P>
<P>
Pollution Research entered the Korean market when it won a contract to monitor 
pollution at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. Several orders worth about 
$400,000 apiece followed. 
</P>
<P>
But during the past year, Gosselin said, Korea stopped ordering pollution 
monitoring equipment, a result of various political changes. Gosselin said the 
Korean market is now opening up again, and he expects to land a contract soon 
that's worth more than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Gosselin also blamed Pollution Research's losses on "unethical" practices by 
Thermo Electron and Lear Siegler, including predatory pricing tactics. 
</P>
<P>
Arvin Smith, president of Thermo Instrument Systems, denied that his company 
had undercut Pollution Research's prices in hopes of driving it out of 
business. "We have the highest prices in the business," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pollution Research's troubles have been reflected in its stock, 
which traded as high as $2.375 a share in June, 1989, but closed Monday at 
18.75 cents a share. Gosselin said he has considered buyout offers from parties 
he declined to identify. But those talks have since broken off, and Gosselin 
said no other discussions are under way to sell the company. 
</P>
<P>
Gosselin said he has taken steps to try to turn the company around, including 
cutting the staff by more than half to 33 workers. He is also hoping to team up 
with larger partners, such as Brown Boveri, a big Swiss-Swedish concern with 
whom Pollution Research recently bid for a contract in Taiwan. Gosselin said he 
is also increasing marketing efforts in Europe, where he believes demand for 
pollution control products will soon take off. 
</P>
<P>
But Pollution Research's biggest hope is for the domestic market. By early next 
year, Gosselin said, government agencies and companies will start having plans 
and funding in place to comply with the new law, and "they're going to need our 
instruments."

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: SANTA CLARITA SHAREHOLDERS OK SECURITY PACIFIC DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shareholders of Santa Clarita National Bank voted unanimously on Oct. 26 to 
approve a merger agreement with Security Pacific Corp. of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But the vote doesn't guarantee that the merger will go through. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement would allow Santa Clarita National, which has 11 branches, to 
back out of the deal if Security Pacific's stock is below an average of $26 for 
the five days prior to closing of the deal, now set for Nov. 15. Security 
Pacific's stock has recently traded for less than $20, closing Monday at $17.75 
per share. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific first announced in March that it had agreed to acquire Santa 
Clarita National for $52.5 million in stock. But Security Pacific's stock has 
fallen precipitously since then, like that of many banks nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
With the decline in its stock price, Security Pacific has now agreed to pay a 
maximum of about 1.75 million shares to acquire Santa Clarita National.

GORBACHEV ASKS ARABS TO MEET TO SOLVE CRISIS

<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, rejecting a military solution in the 
Persian Gulf as "unacceptable," Monday called for a meeting of Arab countries, 
with Saudi Arabia in a leading role, as a means of seeking a political 
settlement to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, more than ever, there are arguments in favor of using the Arab factor," 
Gorbachev declared at a news conference after two days of talks with French 
President Francois Mitterrand. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said Soviet special envoy Yevgeny Primakov, who met with Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein over the weekend in Baghdad, reported signs of 
continued softening in positions taken by Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
"The position of Saddam Hussein is not the same that he held some time ago 
(after the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait). Some reflection has taken place," 
Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Cable News Network broadcast Monday, Hussein himself 
described the sessions with Primakov as "wide-ranging, deep and very useful." 
Primakov flew to Saudi Arabia on Monday for talks with King Fahd. 
</P>
<P>
Although stressing Soviet solidarity with United Nations sanctions against 
Iraq, Gorbachev urged caution in dealing with what he described as an 
essentially Arab problem that should be solved by Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
"There needs to be some Arab mechanism," he said. "All this is taking place on 
Arab soil, and we need to look at the national interests of the people. This is 
the quickest way to seek a settlement for Iraqi leadership as well." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Gorbachev added, members of the U.N. Security Council must 
stick together in the strict enforcement of U.N. sanctions against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot allow and should never give grounds to Iraq and the regime of Saddam 
Hussein to believe or have any hope of disharmony or weakening of the 
resolutions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
By stressing Arab-led negotiations with the Iraqi government, Gorbachev 
appeared to be opening the door to a possible compromise with Hussein that 
would allow the Iraqi president to withdraw from Kuwait without losing face 
among fellow Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
For 20 years, the Soviet Union and France have been Iraq's strongest allies 
outside the Arab bloc. However, Mitterrand did not join with Gorbachev in the 
appeal for a joint Arab conference on the Iraq issue, saying only that he has 
long favored an international conference to deal with the Arab-Israeli 
question. 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand, who was quoted in the French press recently as saying that war was 
imminent in the gulf, took a more pessimistic stance than that of his Soviet 
counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic facts haven't changed since the Aug. 2 invasion," the French 
president said Monday. "I can see how various developments could link together 
to lead to an armed conflict." Almost from the beginning of the gulf crisis, 
Mitterrand has talked about what he terms the "logic of war." 
</P>
<P>
A few hours after Gorbachev and Mitterrand broke up their meeting at the 
14th-Century Rambouillet Chateau outside Paris, 257 French hostages boarded an 
Iraqi Airlines charter flight in Baghdad to return to France. 
</P>
<P>
The plane landed in Paris late Monday to cheers from throngs of family members 
and journalists. Among those returning were seven French diplomats who had 
endured an arduous siege of their embassy in Kuwait city. 
</P>
<P>
In a move aimed at separating France from the rest of the international 
community opposed to the invasion of Kuwait, Hussein ordered the release of all 
French hostages, including those held as human shields at strategic sites. 
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted to have the French hostages come back," Mitterrand said during 
his joint news conference with Gorbachev.

DEFICIT-REDUCTION BILL RIFE WITH FAVORITISM; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: LAWMAKERS CONTINUE TO FUND PET PROJECTS AND PROVIDE TAX BREAKS FOR 
HOME-STATE INDUSTRIES.

<P>
Taxes on a bottle of wine will go up 700% when the new federal budget plan is 
signed into law -- unless the wine was produced in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
A provision of the tax bill passed by Congress over the weekend exempts small 
wineries from the increase and, to the consternation of many Californians, the 
definition of small happens to fit all 85 wineries in Oregon. That is the home 
state of Sen. Bob Packwood, the top Republican on the Senate tax-writing 
committee and the sponsor of the exemption. 
</P>
<P>
Along similar lines, Lehigh University has spent three years looking for money 
to build a naval research center. Its ship came in last weekend when Congress 
voted to give the Pennsylvania college $24 million for the facility. 
</P>
<P>
The public, and most members of Congress, would have a hard time explaining 
what the $24 million was all about. It was buried in an obscure amendment that 
did not even mention Lehigh. Instead, the money is earmarked for Competitive 
Technologies Inc., which a congressional staff member called "nothing more than 
a paper, dummy organization." 
</P>
<P>
Similar breaks that slipped through Congress in the waning hours of last week's 
session benefit everything from makers of large cigars to wealthy art patrons 
to a small theater in West Virginia and manufacturers of ethanol, a gasoline 
substitute. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the contention by some lawmakers that they and their aides kept the 
special breaks to a minimum this time around, the new federal budget is rife 
with examples of favoritism that appear to counter the spirit of the 
deficit-reduction package. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, already 
has vowed to investigate actions by lawmakers that added tens of millions of 
dollars worth of special projects to the defense appropriation bill. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Pa.) has even offered to buy lunch at a Capitol Hill 
restaurant for any of his colleagues who spot new examples of this dubious but 
time-honored practice. 
</P>
<P>
The special breaks were passed despite the pressure on Congress this year to 
come up with a budget that slashed the deficit by $500 billion -- and despite 
the insistence of congressional tax-writers that the new bill was free of the 
sort of breaks that the 1986 tax act contained. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen anything at the level of outrageousness of the 1986 act, but I 
wouldn't chalk it up to a sudden feeling of reform in the tax-writing 
committees," said David L. Keating, executive vice president of the nonpartisan 
National Taxpayers Union here. 
</P>
<P>
"They were simply scratching for every last dollar to meet this 
deficit-reduction goal, and special breaks stood in the way," Keating said. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the current atmosphere, however, the 13 appropriations bills and other 
legislation approved by Congress in the waning hours of the session this last 
weekend contain hundreds of millions of dollars worth of special-interest 
measures, such as the small-winery exemption. 
</P>
<P>
From the start of the budget negotiations, one of the major revenue raisers was 
expected to be a sharp increase in the taxes on alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
In early September, members of the Oregon Winegrowers' Assn. met with Packwood 
to complain that a big tax increase would doom many of the state's small 
wineries, said Bill Nelson, the group's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said that it was Packwood who suggested exempting the small wineries. 
The growers' group then suggested that operations producing less than 250,000 
gallons of wine a year should be protected. 
</P>
<P>
As the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee and a member of the 
House-Senate committee that worked out the final details of the package, 
Packwood was in a position to deliver for his constituents. 
</P>
<P>
When the final package was approved, the tax on a bottle of table wine shot up 
to 21 cents, from 3 cents. But wineries producing less than 150,000 gallons a 
year were exempted from the increase entirely, and those producing 150,000 to 
250,000 gallons got a partial exemption. 
</P>
<P>
The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that, over the five-year 
period covered by the bill, the exemption will save the wineries $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Packwood called the exemption "a victory for Oregon's 
wineries." And Nelson said Monday that the majority of California wineries also 
will benefit because about 600 of the states 650 commercial wineries produced 
less than 250,000 gallons a year. 
</P>
<P>
However, those 600 California wineries account for only about 3% of the 412 
million gallons of wine produced annually. The big California winemakers, such 
as E&amp;J Gallo Winery, Robert Mondavi Winery and Fetzer Vineyards, will be 
hurt by the new tax. 
</P>
<P>
New tobacco taxes were another key revenue-raiser -- and another area where a 
key congressional tax-writer protected a home-state industry. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.), a long-time member of the House Ways and Mean 
Committee, ushered a provision through the negotiations that will reduce taxes 
on tobacco manufacturers who produce "large" cigars -- those weighing more than 
three pounds per 1,000, or .04 ounces each. 
</P>
<P>
The cigar manufacturers in Gibbons' district, all of whom fall into this 
category, are expected to save more than $100 million over the next five years 
as a result of his efforts. 
</P>
<P>
But Gibbons insisted that the provision is only a "technical modification" that 
"does not seek to exempt manufacturers of large cigars from paying federal 
excise taxes nor from having their tax rates increased." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) protected two of his constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
Although luxury items, such as personal aircraft, will be subject to higher 
taxes, Dole managed to raise the price threshold to soften the blow to two of 
the nation's largest manufacturers of small aircraft, Cessna and Beech 
Aircraft, both situated in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
And, although gasoline taxes are to rise, he managed to extend a tax break for 
those who manufacture or mix low-emission ethanol additives for gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
"Ethanol is a fuel made from grain, and, since we represent a state that is 
grain-producing, we have an interest in creating markets for grain," a Dole 
staff member explained. 
</P>
<P>
A major beneficiary of the tax break will be Archer-Daniels-Midland, the huge 
agribusiness firm that is the nation's largest ethanol producer. ADM chief 
executive Dwayne Andreas is a big Republican campaign donor. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) did not fare as well in 
trying to obtain a favorable tax rate for companies selling a specific type of 
insurance, including a firm in his hometown of Portland. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's proposal, which would have resulted in an additional $1 billion in 
lost revenue, was dropped after complaints that it looked bad, according to 
budget staff members. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the tax breaks, Congress managed to tuck a number of late spending 
projects into the budget, much to the anger of Sam Nunn, who has vowed to call 
hearings early next year on additions to the defense appropriations bill. 
</P>
<P>
One of those projects was Lehigh's $24-million research center. Michael Bolton, 
Lehigh's vice president for development and university relations, defended the 
project Monday and said that it was widely supported by Pennsylvania's 
congressional delegation. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, he noted, has been without a real funding program for 
building new research facilities for more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
It is because of the absence of a federal funding program for new facilities 
that "Lehigh and others try to make our needs known to our congressional 
delegation," Bolton said. "We have no other place to go." 
</P>
<P>
But that tactic, known as "earmarking," has become increasingly controversial, 
not only in Congress but among universities and the science community at large. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the practice, which began to develop in the early 1980s, say that 
funding for all research projects, whether specific research projects or new 
facilities, should be on a competitive basis, in which scientists openly review 
the proposals of their peers. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn attacked the practice on the Senate floor Saturday, citing numerous 
examples in the defense appropriations bill. 
</P>
<P>
"I am anxious to learn why the Navy's existing laboratories and design bureaus 
are so limited that we must add $24 million for a nonprofit consortium formed 
by Lehigh University to study shipbuilding design and manufacturing methods," 
Nunn said. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the Bush Administration had requested $98 million for competitive 
research grants. But the House added $60 million in special projects. Among 
them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- $10 million for a new lab at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, for pain 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $10 million to create a National Drug Intelligence Center in the home 
district of Rep. John P. Murtha (D-Pa.), chairman of the House Appropriations 
defense subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $4 million for a Japanese-American Museum as a part of the proposed 
cultural center in Ontario, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $5 million to build a new parliament building in the Solomon Islands, an 
independent nation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $3.5 million for the Center for Advanced Information and Resource 
Management Studies, a new computer building, at Loyola College in Baltimore, 
Md. 
</P>
<P>
Without identifying the specific projects, Nunn said that at least seven of the 
earmarked appropriations involve "first-time grants to colleges and 
universities for activities no one in the Department of Defense has requested." 
</P>
<P>
"The conference report didn't even discuss the purpose of most of these 
projects," Nunn fumed.

MOSCOW BATTLES FEARS OF COLD, HUNGRY WINTER

<P>
With winter already at the door, Soviet officials tried Monday to reassure a 
population frightened by erratic food supplies and growing economic chaos that 
they will not spend the coming months cold and hungry. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to allay widespread fears that this winter will be the worst in a 
generation, Deputy Prime Minister Lev D. Ryabev reported to the Supreme Soviet 
that the country's fuel reserves will last until spring, and Moscow Deputy 
Mayor Sergei B. Stankevich announced that the capital's food stockpiles equal 
last year's. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Ryabev's comforting statistics, which showed a drop in oil and coal 
supplies offset by a rise in natural gas, Supreme Soviet deputies took the 
floor, one after another, to describe areas where they knew the energy system 
was falling apart. 
</P>
<P>
"Whole neighborhoods are frozen in Novosibirsk, Kemerovo and other Siberian 
cities, as well as in central Russia," Vladimir V. Kazarezov of Novosibirsk 
told other members of the Supreme Soviet, the country's legislature. "In recent 
years, we were saved by warm winters. If a heavy frost sets in this year, 
that's the end of us." 
</P>
<P>
The onset of winter is bringing expressions of painful apprehension, both in 
the media and in casual conversation, as people face the possibility that the 
Soviet Union's collapsing economy could leave them without food, heat, fuel and 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
"With its peasant history, our people have always feared winter," Alexei M. 
Yemelianov, an economist and member of the national Parliament, said after the 
debate. "But today they're awaiting winter with true anxiety. This winter could 
be not only cold and hungry, but politically explosive as well." 
</P>
<P>
Deputies blamed governmental incompetence on all levels for the energy 
shortfalls, particularly condemning the decision to cut capital investment 
across the board in order to funnel more money into satisfying the public 
clamor for consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
"How could they allow a cut of 30% in capital investment in energy?" Kazarezov 
demanded, pointing out that building houses does no good if they cannot be 
heated and growing more food has no effect if there is no fuel to get it to the 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet production of oil and coal has fallen 5% so far this year, but the drop 
was offset by a 3% increase in natural gas production, Ryabev said. He blamed 
deteriorating equipment and transportation snarls for the shortfall, adding 
that refusal by local authorities in several areas to allow nuclear plants to 
operate there added to energy difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
"I purposely presented statistics to show we have enough resources to get 
through this winter," Ryabev said, adding that he hoped his report would prompt 
dissatisfied citizens to put pressure on their local governments. "(If) the 
resources exist and we still freeze -- that's impermissible." 
</P>
<P>
In all, Ryabev said, 40 major Soviet cities are suffering from a 10% to 20% 
energy shortage; among them are the Volga industrial center of Kuibyshev and 
Vorkuta, beyond the Arctic Circle. 
</P>
<P>
Those dry statistics did little, however, to capture the utter misery of 
complaints like those that have poured into a special series headlined "Will We 
Be Warm?" now being run in the Communist Party daily, Pravda. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been cluttering the doorsteps of officials for three years on the 
question of condemning our building," read one letter from the Russian city of 
Nizhny Novgorod, formerly known as Gorky. "It's impossible to live here because 
of the cold and damp; in the basement there is a foot and a half of water. The 
walls are covered with a thick layer of fungus. In the winter, our 77-year-old 
mother-in-law, who lives here, walks around in a fur coat and felt boots." 
</P>
<P>
"When you read about how in many cities there is no heat, and people in the 
capital are freezing, you're amazed at our communal services," V. Arshina wrote 
from Novosibirsk. "What are we supposed to do, when we not only have no heat, 
but no hot water either? Help, SOS!" 
</P>
<P>
Although infamous for its merciless cold and harsh winds, the Russian winter 
has a generally positive image in national culture as a time of invigorating 
frost and jolly enjoyment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's winter -- the peasant, celebrating, carves out a new path with his 
horse-driven sleigh," goes a popular poem by Nikolai A. Nekrasov that Soviet 
schoolchildren learn. 
</P>
<P>
But this year the growing difficulty of obtaining such basic foods as eggs and 
cheese and the prospect of political upheaval have made the onset of winter 
ominous; a general sense of insecurity and impending chaos is diminishing the 
pleasure of the crisp air of late autumn and the anticipation of the first 
snowfall. 
</P>
<P>
Before Stankevich's announcement at Moscow City Hall that food stockpiles 
appeared normal for this winter, reports had indicated that there was a major 
shortfall in potatoes, a key staple of the Russian diet, as well as most other 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Stankevich did not deny that supplies fell short; he said only that Moscow was 
working on importing all the food it needed to replenish its stocks. 
</P>
<P>
To ensure enough fuel for heating and electricity, the Soviet Union has cut its 
oil exports, mainly to Eastern Europe, despite a desperate need to earn more 
foreign currency. 
</P>
<P>
Supreme Soviet deputies' criticism of the government's energy program as 
shortsighted extended to the decision to discuss preparations for winter when 
the season was already well under way in much of this vast northern land. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at least six months late with this discussion," Kazarezov said. 
</P>
<P>
Another deputy, Vitaly Bushuyev, conveyed his disgust at government 
disorganization more vividly: When fuel runs out, he said, the Supreme Soviet 
should contribute to energy supplies by burning its own worthless resolutions 
and draft laws.

U.S. PLANS TALKS ON GULF OFFENSIVE; 
</P>
<P>
STRATEGY: OFFICIALS ARE BECOMING CONVINCED THAT IRAQ WILL NOT QUIT KUWAIT. 
BAKER WILL CONFER WITH ALLIES ON THE EMBARGO AND A TIMETABLE FOR POSSIBLE 
MILITARY ACTION.

<TEXT>
<P>
Within the next week, the Bush Administration will discuss a timetable for 
possible use of military force against Iraqi forces in Kuwait at talks with 
U.S. allies in Europe and the Persian Gulf, sources said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
With Administration officials increasingly convinced that U.N. sanctions will 
not force Iraq to withdraw, Secretary of State James A. Baker III will visit 
Europe, Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations, perhaps as early as this weekend, 
to assess the current status of the embargo and to consider additional steps, 
including a military offensive, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
A senior government official in Washington declared that if the United States 
were to exclude the military option, "it would be hard to find a scenario with 
any link to reality." He added that the most likely time for a U.S. offensive 
would be in December or January, "although it could come earlier or a little 
later." 
</P>
<P>
The official, who is involved in Persian Gulf strategy, indicated that he 
considers war almost inevitable and said: "I know of no one who disagrees with 
my assessment of the situation and what we have to do to achieve our goals." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington and Saudi Arabia, senior U.S. officials, who agreed to interviews 
on condition that they not be identified, said the time is fast approaching 
when a decision must be made on how much more time sanctions will be given to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
And in speeches in California, which a Washington official said may be the 
beginning of an orchestrated effort to prepare the American public for war, 
both Baker and President Bush warned that the United States would not hesitate 
to use force to resolve the Persian Gulf crisis if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
In Saudi Arabia, a U.S. official said there is "absolutely no cause" for 
optimism that Iraq's President Saddam Hussein will back down, adding that "we 
are approaching the moment at which we'll have to make a judgment about how 
long we will give sanctions to work." 
</P>
<P>
Although the official said "no judgment has been made that sanctions will not 
work," government analysts in Washington working on the crisis have concluded 
that the sanctions alone will not bring enough pressure on Hussein to force him 
to abandon Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Other U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia said that a new sense of urgency about 
resolving the crisis was rooted partly in the destruction of Kuwait, but also 
in increasing concern about flagging American public support for what could be 
a prolonged standoff. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis are continuing to pour troops into Kuwait and build up their 
defensive fortifications while looting the country of enough materials and 
supplies to keep Iraq from feeling the full impact of the economic sanctions, 
according to U.S. intelligence sources. The sanctions have had practically no 
effect on the Iraqi military, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia said that new concerns also have been raised 
about the time required to reinforce allied troops and equipment already there 
and to prepare for combat in alien territory. 
</P>
<P>
Even without a final decision about offensive operations, "you have to make 
some decisions now to provide options for military force somewhere down the 
road," said one official. "You have to make a decision to flesh out the options 
now if you're actually going to have those options when it comes to the moment 
when you weigh whether to use them or not." 
</P>
<P>
Other U.S. officials indicated that some of the pressure for a decision on a 
military option has come from U.S. theater commanders who, in making clear that 
more troops would be needed for any U.S. ground attack against Iraq's 
million-strong army, have asked for new guidance about the nature of the U.S. 
mission in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"A commander doesn't just ask for more troops," one source said. "He asks for 
his mission." 
</P>
<P>
Even though the United States has 210,000 troops in the Persian Gulf region and 
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has said that as many as 100,000 more may be 
deployed, the military still lacks the guaranteed capability to launch an 
offensive operation sufficient to drive Iraqi forces out of Kuwait, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Among other items likely to be on the agenda of the Baker visit are discussions 
of future U.N. and Arab League resolutions against Iraq, discussions of 
enforcement of sanctions and further talk about burden-sharing and the economic 
impact of the gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
But the principal goal of the trip, a U.S. official in Saudi Arabia said, will 
be to "trade assessments of the situation" as a means of guiding military 
preparations. 
</P>
<P>
At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the purpose of 
Baker's trip is to "consult with our coalition partners about the general 
situation in the gulf and is part of our ongoing diplomatic effort to achieve 
full compliance with the U.N. resolutions, with emphasis on effective 
implementation of the sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
However, Baker made clear that the United States will not wait indefinitely for 
the sanctions to work. "Saddam Hussein must realize there is a limit to the 
international community's patience," he said Monday in a speech to the Los 
Angeles World Affairs Council. 
</P>
<P>
Other U.S. officials said that Baker also hopes to repair some erosion in the 
international coalition, making sure that U.S. allies stand fast in opposing 
Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Pentagon official said Baker's trip comes at a critical time, both 
because strains have begun to appear in the anti-Iraq coalition and because key 
military decisions must be made now if an offensive operation is contemplated 
before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"Until a couple of weeks ago, everybody was on board" behind Bush's demand for 
an unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, the official said. "But in the 
last two weeks, all kinds of contradictory signals have been sent," suggesting 
the possibility of some sort of negotiated deal that would allow Hussein to 
keep part of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's strategy ever since Bush dispatched troops to Saudi Arabia after the 
Aug. 2 invasion has been to solidify his grip on Kuwait and to avoid any overt 
provocation of U.S. forces while engaging in a standoff that he hopes will last 
long enough to erode the international forces aligned against him. 
</P>
<P>
"He can sit there indefinitely, and he knows how to absorb pain," said a U.S. 
official. "But we can't sit there forever. We've got to make some hard 
decisions about how to resolve it, and those decisions may come sooner rather 
than later."

3RD TRAIN ADDED BETWEEN L.A. AND SANTA BARBARA; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSIT: AMTRAK AND CALTRANS HOPE THAT THE LATEST RUN WILL LEAD TO MORE 
COMMUNTER RAIL SERVICE THROUGHOUT THE SOUTHLAND.

<P>
Bands played, politicians and transportation officials urged people to leave 
their automobiles behind and scores of travel agents were the honored guests 
Monday as more frequent train service began between Los Angeles and Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans and Amtrak used the occasion of the addition of a third daily train 
each way to express hope for a series of expansions that will bring intercity 
and commuter rail service throughout the Southland by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, if voter-approved bonds are well-spent and localities ante up a 
share, there could be regular commuter service to San Bernardino, Riverside, 
Santa Clarita, Moorpark and San Juan Capistrano, and more frequent service to 
San Diego and Santa Barbara, with perhaps some extensions to Goleta. 
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to popular belief, Caltrans loves trains," said Jack Maloney, chief 
deputy director of Caltrans, at a series of ceremonies along the Santa Barbara 
route Monday. "We will work to add trains not only in this corridor but in all 
transportation corridors that can use them." 
</P>
<P>
As the new service wended its way north, legislators and city council members 
hailed it, saying the trains will reduce traffic congestion and be kinder to 
the environment than automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
Because Amtrak gives preference to long-distance travelers -- and the daily 
Coast Starlight to Seattle is heavily booked -- reservations between Los 
Angeles and Santa Barbara on the 9:55 a.m. train often have been unavailable. 
The same has been true of the late-afternoon run. 
</P>
<P>
But space is expected to be ample on the new morning train, which departs Los 
Angeles at 8:20 and arrives in Santa Barbara at 10:55. The return leaves Santa 
Barbara at 3:25 p.m. and arrives in Los Angeles at 6. 
</P>
<P>
Another train, begun in 1988, leaves Los Angeles at 8 p.m., arriving in Santa 
Barbara at 10:30 p.m. The returning train departs Santa Barbara at 7:50 each 
morning and arrives in Los Angeles at 10:30 a.m. All trains continue to and 
from San Diego as part of Amtrak's San Diegan service. 
</P>
<P>
Stops between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara are at Glendale, the Burbank 
airport, Van Nuys, Chatsworth, Simi Valley and Oxnard. A stop also will be made 
in Ventura, when a new station there is finished. Concrete platforms at many of 
the existing stops will be improved or converted into regular stations for 
commuter service, expected to begin in two or three years. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the stations along the route had new schedules posted Monday, and there 
were fewer than 50 paying passengers in the regular cars to accompany a total 
of several hundred Caltrans guests in free cars. 
</P>
<P>
But Ron Scolaro, an Amtrak administrator, joined Caltrans officials in 
predicting relatively quick financial success for the new train, whose start-up 
costs are being paid by the state. The next probable Amtrak service expansion 
is a ninth daily train each way between Los Angeles and San Diego, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the new service could have started earlier had it not been for a 
shortage of cars and locomotives. Some have been borrowed from Amtrak's Eastern 
pool until newly ordered cars and locomotives are delivered here. 
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony in Santa Barbara, City Council and Chamber of Commerce 
representatives said they now will try to sell a daily excursion to the city. 
Tourists arriving on the early train will have five hours to enjoy the beaches, 
restaurants and other attractions here before the last train returns to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Paying passengers Monday generally expressed enthusiasm about the new Santa 
Barbara service. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Amaro of Oceanside said he will be able to commute much faster each 
Monday from his home to his job in Simi Valley. He returns home on Friday and 
has been using a bus between Simi Valley and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, however, Amaro left Oceanside at 5:56 a.m. and arrived in Simi Valley a 
little past the 9:30 scheduled time. He works just two blocks away from the 
train platform that local authorities contributed $100,000 to build a few years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Armstrong, a counselor at UC Santa Barbara, was there to share in the 
spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
"A train is the great American historical event," he said. "I've been watching 
the commercials, and I just didn't want to miss this." 
</P>
<P>
Cathryn Bonnette, a Glendale pastor, said the new train will make scheduling 
her regular Santa Barbara trips much easier. Bonnette, who is blind, was on the 
train with her guide dog.

PRO-INDEPENDENCE BLOC WINS IN GEORGIA REPUBLIC

<P>
An anti-Communist opposition bloc advocating independence for the southern 
Soviet republic of Georgia captured a large majority of seats in a 
parliamentary election, preliminary results showed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Zviad Gamsakhurdia, a longtime dissident who leads the coalition Round 
Table-Free Georgia, said his bloc won 70% of the 250 seats at stake in the 
free, multi-party elections on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The official Soviet news agency Tass reported that the Round Table won 34 out 
of 125 districts and the Communist Party won 22. One deputy from the Georgian 
Popular Front won a seat, and runoff elections must be held for the other 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
An additional 125 seats will be filled by the parties based on the percentages 
they win in the election. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected the victory," Gamsakhurdia said in a telephone interview. "The 
Communist Party is not popular among Georgians. It is a criminal party -- a 
party of the mafia, not a nationalist party. The Georgian people support only 
the Round Table; no other parties are popular." 
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the Election Commission, Irakli Zhordania, said he could not 
yet give exact results. "But I can say that the Round Table won a big 
advantage," he said by telephone. "The Communists were big losers compared to 
the Round Table." 
</P>
<P>
Another member of the Election Commission, Argil Chirakadze, said the Round 
Table won at least twice as many races as the Communist Party, the 
second-largest vote winner. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gamsakhurdia's figures, his bloc of seven pro-independence parties 
won at least 70% of the 250 seats on the republic's Supreme Soviet or 
legislature, the Communist Party won 20% of the seats and other parties shared 
the rest. 
</P>
<P>
But two rival nationalist parties boycotted the election, refusing to 
participate in any form of Soviet rule. 
</P>
<P>
Many high-ranking Communists, including Georgian Prime Minister Nodar A. 
Chitanava, were defeated, according to Gamsakhurdia. Election commission 
officials refused to confirm this, pending final results. 
</P>
<P>
Although nationalist movements have won majorities in elections in other Soviet 
republics, the Georgian election was the first time that rival groups have been 
registered under a new Soviet law as formal political parties. 
</P>
<P>
About 35 parties, most of them grouped in blocs, participated in the election. 
Voter turnout was 70%, according to the Election Commission. Official results 
are not expected until the end of the week. Runoffs for races where no 
candidate won 50% of the vote are scheduled for Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Gamsakhurdia, a strident anti-Communist imprisoned under the late Soviet 
President Leonid I. Brezhnev, is a likely candidate as Georgia's next leader. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very good," Gamsakhurdia said. "A few years ago, I could have never 
imagined this could happen." 
</P>
<P>
Round Table was created in April as Gamsakhurdia's 14-year-old group, the 
Helsinki Union, joined with younger organizations. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the Round Table gains control of the republic's government, it 
intends to lead Georgia into a transition phase from its current status as one 
of the Soviet Union's 15 constituent republics to complete political 
independence, Gamsakhurdia said. Establishing economic independence from the 
Soviet Union will be a priority, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a brief year of independence in the 1920s, Georgia has been part of 
the Soviet Union and the Russian empire for nearly two centuries. A 
battleground as well as crossroads, the small, mountainous republic has been 
fought over by Turks, Mongols, Persians, Arabs and Russians since the 6th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
The Round Table has not yet outlined a timetable for independence. "This will 
depend on Moscow," Gamsakhurdia said, indicating his reluctance to confront the 
Kremlin immediately. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has urged the republics to remain within the 
Soviet Union but with greater rights to manage their own affairs.

HIGH COURT HEARS AIR TRAUMA CASE; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: PASSENGERS ABOARD A JET THAT AVOIDED A CRASH WANT TO SUE, CLAIMING MENTAL 
INJURIES. AN INTERNATIONAL TREATY IS THE KEY TO THE DISPUTE.

<P>
The jumbo jetliner had just taken off for a short flight from Miami to Nassau 
in the Bahamas when its engines failed and it began losing altitude. 
</P>
<P>
The crew calmly alerted passengers to get ready for a crash landing in the 
Atlantic. However, after a few terrifying minutes, one engine was restarted, 
and the big jet glided onto a Miami runway. 
</P>
<P>
Can any of the 162 passengers on board sue the airline for emotional trauma? 
</P>
<P>
That question was before the Supreme Court on Monday in a case that could have 
an enormous impact on the rights of international travelers and the liability 
of airlines. 
</P>
<P>
On May 5, 1983, an Eastern Airlines wide-body jet almost ditched in the 
Atlantic because mechanics had failed to replace O-rings on the engines, 
causing a loss of oil pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Although none of the passengers suffered physical injury, many said they were 
emotionally traumatized. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, an appeals court in Atlanta ruled that these passengers can win 
damages from Eastern for their mental injuries. The ruling was based on the 
1929 Warsaw Convention, which governs international air travel. 
</P>
<P>
Airline lawyers said that the decision, if upheld by the Supreme Court, would 
open the way for passengers who experience turbulence or a single-engine 
shutdown to sue for damages. 
</P>
<P>
"They can say: 'When you shut down that engine, it sure scared me,"' Eastern 
attorney John Michael Murray told the high court. 
</P>
<P>
The Warsaw treaty has been criticized as outdated. The survivors of passengers 
killed on an international flight can recover only $75,000 -- a fraction of 
what they could receive if the death occurred on a domestic flight. However, 
the treaty says that the airlines must pay the damages resulting from any 
"accident," regardless of whether they were at fault. 
</P>
<P>
For the justices, the key issue is how to define the French term lesion 
corporelle. The 1929 treaty was written in French and says that the airlines 
are liable for a death, wounding or toute autre lesion corporelle suffered by 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department translated this term as "any other bodily injury." But 
recently, legal scholars concluded that it is more correctly translated as any 
other "personal injury." The appeals court adopted that translation and said 
that it included mental as well as physical suffering. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a broad term that covers any personal injury," said Miami attorney Joel 
Eaton, who is representing 26 passengers from the Eastern flight. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the lawyers' oral arguments, the justices inquired about French 
law, French terminology and the Napoleonic Code. But several justices wondered 
aloud whether a scary moment in flight is reason enough to win damages. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been on a half-dozen planes where the engines fell out. Do I get some 
money?" asked Justice Thurgood Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
To that half-kidding inquiry, Eaton stressed that the Eastern passengers win 
damages only if they can persuade a jury that they suffered a true emotional 
trauma. 
</P>
<P>
A ruling in the case (Eastern Airlines vs. Floyd, 89-1598) can be expected 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Air crashes on domestic flights are governed by state law, and thus the high 
court's ruling will have no direct effect on them. 
</P>
<P>
In other actions, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Let stand a ruling requiring the city of Norfolk, Va., to elect its seven 
City Council members from districts (City of Norfolk vs. Collins, 89-989). An 
appeals court in Richmond, Va., concluded that citywide elections discriminated 
against black voters. Though blacks make up more than a third of city 
residents, they have elected only one black councilman in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Let stand a ruling by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals allowing a 
police officer to be sued for displaying "deliberate indifference" to the 
safety of a citizen (Ostrander vs. Wood, 89-1409). The high court action clears 
the way for a trial in a suit filed by a Tacoma, Wash., woman. Police arrested 
her boyfriend for drunk driving in 1984, leaving her stranded in a high-crime 
area where she was subsequently raped. 
</P>

In the past, the high court has said that public officials can be sued if a 
person in custody is hurt. But under the Constitution, officials and the police 
have no general "duty to protect" citizens from harm, the court said last year. 
Without comment, the court refused to hear the policeman's appeal Monday. But 
the justices could enter the case after the trial if the policeman is ordered 
to pay damages to the raped woman.

 -- Let stand a New York court ruling forbidding utilities to include 
charitable contributions in their costs (New York Telephone vs. Cahill, 
90-255). The New York Telephone Co. gives money to charity but had counted 
these contributions in their rate-making formula. In May, the state's highest 
court said that this practice forces customers to subsidize causes and groups 
that they might oppose. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Let stand an appeals court order requiring several suburban Kansas City 
school districts to accept black students bused from the city (Lee's Summit vs. 
Naylor, 90-391). A federal judge in 1985 ordered the "voluntary" integration 
plan between city and suburban schools. But although black students had 
applied, none were admitted as the districts fought over whether local or state 
governments should pay the extra costs involved.

OFFICE FOR JEWISH EMIGRATION OPENS IN MOSCOW;

SOVIET UNION: THE AGENCY, WITH OFFICIAL SANCTION, WILL ASSIST ON EXIT VISAS. IT

In the former annex of a Moscow vegetable store, a U.S. Jewish group and Soviet 
Jews on Monday launched a unique enterprise -- a bureau officially sanctioned 
by Soviet authorities to help people who want to leave the country for new 
lives in Israel and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Today is a joyous day for us," Leonid D. Stonov, a Soviet Jewish leader and 
founder of the new Bureau on Exit, Human Rights and the Rule of Law, told 
supporters who crowded by the dozens into a small room to celebrate the 
opening. "Any person of any nationality will be entitled to any help we can 
give." 
</P>
<P>
The Spartan office, still in the throes of remodeling and with a woefully 
inadequate single telephone, will assist the current flood of emigrants from 
the Soviet Union by giving them information about Israel and the United States 
in advance, coaching them for visa interviews and compiling a computerized data 
base to match their skills with job openings. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll even help them if they have problems with their luggage," said David 
Waksberg, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based Union of Councils for 
Soviet Jews, the American organization that helped organize what it claims is 
the "first independent human rights bureau in the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
The high-ceilinged office at 14 Novoslobodskaya Street, to be open from 10 a.m. 
to 6 p.m. starting today, also will monitor Kremlin conduct on emigration 
matters and Soviet compliance with the Helsinki and Vienna human rights 
accords. 
</P>
<P>
Five full-time Soviet employees, as well as visiting American specialists, will 
offer counseling on resettlement in Israel and the United States, political 
matters and emigration law. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole point is to institutionalize the human rights movement in the Soviet 
Union," said Robyn Lieberman, the former associate director for governmental 
relations for the Union of Councils who worked on setting up the Moscow office. 
"For the past 20 years, the movement has been run out of people's apartments." 
</P>
<P>
However, emigration and past deportations have deprived the 1.5 million Soviet 
Jews of their best-known leaders, like Natan Sharansky, Josef Begun and Ida 
Nudel, as the community faces new challenges, including revived Russian 
anti-Semitism and a dramatic easing of emigration restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Stonov, a bespectacled biologist and specialist on pesticides who for 11 years 
sought permission from Soviet authorities to emigrate before finally obtaining 
it, is himself leaving within weeks to work for Waksberg's organization in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that this bureau is operating, I can leave with a clear conscience," 
Stonov said. 
</P>
<P>
Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, people who attended the afternoon 
inauguration of the office in northern Moscow observed, the state of Soviet 
Jewry has become like a glass of water that, depending on one's point of view, 
can seem half empty or half full. 
</P>
<P>
Israel-bound emigration, for instance, is at an all-time high. According to 
statistics from the U.S. National Conference on Soviet Jewry, 18,725 people 
left for Israel in September, a monthly record, and 100,926 have emigrated 
already this year, also a record. 
</P>
<P>
On the negative side of the balance sheet, Stonov said there are still about 
600 "refuseniks" -- Jews denied their Soviet exit visas. He also accused 
Gorbachev of not doing enough to stem anti-Jewish sentiment, which he blamed in 
part on the country's economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
"When in France, graves of Jews were desecrated, none other than (President 
Francois) Mitterrand led the protest," Stonov said. "Despite appeals from 
members of Parliament, our president has kept silent." 
</P>
<P>
Even the door to the fledgling office in a crumbling, unlit Moscow courtyard 
betrayed the uncertain situation of Soviet Jewry. A hand-lettered sign read 
"The Public Committee," the name of Stonov's organization, but no more. 
</P>
<P>
"Half of our people want it to carry the office's name in Russian, Hebrew and 
English; the other half are afraid to advertise it," Lieberman explained. 
</P>
<P>
For many who attended, the opening of the emigration and human rights bureau, 
whose entryway had still been jammed 24 hours earlier with abacuses and scale 
weights from the state-run vegetable store next door, was vivid proof of the 
new vistas now open for Soviet Jews. 
</P>
<P>
At a table laden with bottles of the soft drink Fanta, Soviet cognac, kosher 
cookies and pretzels, elected officials offered their congratulations and best 
wishes. 
</P>
<P>
"For a long time we've known what Leonid Stonov has been doing, and we support 
it," said Valery Borshchev, chairman of the human rights committee of the 
Moscow City Council, who was instrumental in registering the bureau with local 
authorities and finding it a home. 
</P>
<P>
Stonov himself wryly noted how much had changed from the pre-Gorbachev era, 
when an independent Soviet organization that intended to defend human rights 
would have been smashed by the KGB or infiltrated by its agents. 
</P>
<P>
"If this organization had been created five years ago, we all know who would 
have been in it," Stonov said, provoking general laughter.

In a hint that the Bush Administration may be considering some new action soon 
against Iraq, Secretary of State James A. Baker III warned Monday that "Saddam 
Hussein must realize there is a limit to the international community's 
patience." 
</P>
<P>
Baker, in a toughly worded speech to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council, 
repeatedly emphasized that the United States may have to resort to military 
action in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"All options are being considered," he said. "And let no one doubt: We will not 
rule out a possible use of force if Iraq continues to occupy Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
Baker appeared to be trying to dampen speculation that a settlement of the gulf 
crisis might be in the works as a result of recent diplomatic initiatives by 
the Soviet Union. His speech also seemed designed to emphasize once again that 
the Bush Administration will not accept any deal that gives Iraq a part of 
Kuwaiti territory. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to appease this aggression," Baker said. ". . . The United 
States opposes any attempt to reward Iraq for its aggression -- even if it 
(Iraq) plans the siren song of a 'partial solution.' " 
</P>
<P>
The secretary described the stakes in the gulf standoff in the broadest 
possible terms, arguing that the future of the world depends on the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a vital struggle in which we and the international community must 
prevail," Baker declared. Iraq's aggression, he said, is a challenge to world 
peace, to stability in the Middle East and to the global economy. 
</P>
<P>
"This struggle is about the kind of world we want to live in, the kind of 
nation we are and the kind of legacy we want to leave for our children," Baker 
told the luncheon audience at the Beverly Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cold War is over. We fought and we sacrificed and persisted for over 40 
years because we would not accept a world that was safe for the likes of Josef 
Stalin. The American people have not come this long, hard way to make the world 
safe for the likes of Saddam Hussein." 
</P>
<P>
Baker saved his harshest rhetoric for Iraq's treatment of the Kuwaiti people. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a story of barbarism in its most crude and evil form, the rape of 
Kuwait," he said. He described accounts of Iraqi soldiers summarily shooting 
two Kuwaiti children and of other soldiers releasing lions and tigers from the 
Kuwait city zoo. 
</P>
<P>
Baker also took care to warn the Iraqi leader once again that there would be 
massive retaliation against any Iraqi use of chemical weapons. Saddam Hussein, 
the secretary said, "must realize, and I'd like to stress this point, that 
should he use chemical or biological weapons, there will be the most severe 
consequences." 
</P>
<P>
During a question-and-answer session, Baker was asked whether the United States 
could accept an outcome in which Iraqi troops pulled out of Kuwait but Hussein 
retained his military power and continued to threaten other countries in the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said that in such a case, the Bush Administration would seek to contain 
the Iraqi leader, both through collective security measures and through a 
continuation of the current economic sanctions against Iraq. In particular, 
Baker said, the United States would seek to maintain sanctions against Iraq 
"for military equipment and for spare parts for his (Hussein's) military 
machine."

<P>
For Gov. Mario M. Cuomo the suspense on election night next week should last 
about a New York minute. 
</P>
<P>
Then his real political test will begin: coping with a gaping hole in the state 
budget at a time when the Democratic field for the 1992 presidential race will 
be moving into the gate. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody will be looking at New York," said Richard C. Wade, an urban 
historian at the City University of New York graduate center who has advised 
Cuomo. "He's got 18 months to prove he can be a governor in a recession." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Republicans hoped the recession would fuel a serious 
challenge to Cuomo. But the New York GOP instead immolated itself with an 
embarrassing public search for a candidate that finally produced economic 
consultant Pierre A. Rinfret, a political neophyte. 
</P>
<P>
Even in a year tailored for outsiders, Rinfret has been hapless. His campaign 
is so starved for both funds and attention that recently he took a Greyhound 
bus from New York to Syracuse for the first debate between the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Some leading Republicans -- including Housing and Urban Development Secretary 
Jack Kemp -- are so disenchanted with Rinfret that they have endorsed New York 
University dean Herbert London, the Conservative Party candidate. But, like 
Rinfret, neither London nor Right-to-Life Party candidate Louis P. Wein have 
had the funds to jostle Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
Ten days before the election, the only question left in the campaign is whether 
Cuomo can match the record-setting 65% margin of his first reelection four 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
With that prospect in sight, many Democrats here are openly speculating on a 
Cuomo presidential bid in 1992. They argue that events could not be moving more 
clearly in his direction: inspired by a shaky economy and emboldened by a 
vacillating President who seems intent on saddling the GOP with its old image 
as the party of privilege, the Democrats are rediscovering the attractions of 
the full-throated, class-based populism at which Cuomo excels. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a great matchup against George Bush," said Mitchell L. Moss, director of 
the Urban Research Center at New York University. 
</P>
<P>
But even if Cuomo is interested in moving on -- he has, as always, discouraged 
direct speculation -- there are many twists in the road from Albany to 
Washington. The most immediate takes the form of a paradox: the same economic 
deterioration that makes Cuomo more attractive nationally threatens the local 
record on which he would run. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, state Comptroller Edward V. Regan, a Republican, reported 
that with the economy sagging, state revenues lagged behind expectations by 
$246 million through the first six months of the current fiscal year; some 
analysts say the gap in this year's budget, which will be confronted in a 
special session of the Legislature after the election, could ultimately reach 
$1 billion. That's the foothill to the mountain: Next year's budget could be as 
much as $3 billion in the red, Regan projected. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, Cuomo and the Legislature went through extraordinary gyrations to 
close a budget deficit estimated at $3.5 billion. But they did so only after 
missing their constitutional deadline by nearly two months while arguing over 
taxes and manufacturing $1.7 billion of convoluted one-shot transactions, such 
as selling state assets. 
</P>
<P>
By relying on these complex budgetary "gimmicks", Rinfret has argued, Cuomo and 
the Legislature (which is divided in control between a Republican Senate and a 
Democratic Assembly) failed to address the underlying dilemma that state 
spending has been growing faster than revenue. Some independent analysts think 
he has a good case, even though Rinfret hasn't had the resources to press it. 
</P>
<P>
National Republican strategists are virtually trembling at the opportunity to 
paint Cuomo as a tax-and-spend Democrat if he tries to close the gap with a tax 
hike. Though Cuomo has presided over a large cut in the state's top income tax 
bracket, the combined state and local tax burden in New York still exceeds all 
states but Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
But some Democrats believe the budget may instead provide Cuomo with an anvil 
on which to reshape his national image as an unreconstructed liberal. In 
campaign appearances, Cuomo repeatedly insisted he plans to meet the crunch 
without raising taxes "if we can avoid it." 
</P>
<P>
With crack, AIDS, and homelessness imposing enormous demands on social 
spending, liberal activists -- some of whom already consider Cuomo's rhetoric 
grander than his programs -- are certain to resist the cuts that could be 
necessary to fulfill that promise. But, for now, Cuomo is bracing New Yorkers 
for a "period of pain." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Cuomo has begun erecting his political defense for any cuts 
by blaming the federal government for transferring responsibilities to the 
states without providing offsetting resources. Strikingly, he does not spare 
the Democratic-controlled Congress -- thus positioning himself as another 
outsider enraged at the insular Washington Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
Cuomo's challenge is further complicated by the $1.7-billion budget shortfall 
facing New York City. In the mid-1970s, the last time New York's finances hit 
such a low, state aid was instrumental to its revival; now, by talking down the 
prospect of a tax hike, Cuomo is signaling that "the state will not be able to 
bail out the city," said NYU's Moss. 
</P>
<P>
But many observers here say Cuomo cannot allow New York City to collapse into 
disarray, especially if he plans to run for President. If the city's fiscal 
situation corrodes enough, that would automatically trigger reactivation of the 
State Financial Control Board that took over city finances during the 1970s -- 
a move that could provide political cover for Draconian cuts. But, with the 
city already racially strained, a state takeover would inevitably generate 
criticism for usurping the city's first black mayor, David N. Dinkins. 
</P>
<P>
While Cuomo works through these difficult choices, he continues to thrill 
Democratic audiences here with passionate denunciations of the Reagan years and 
tantalizing hints that he may step forward in 1992. At a recent Liberal Party 
dinner in a Manhattan hotel, he sounded like someone who felt the times rolling 
toward him despite all the fiscal turbulence ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"When was the last time in our history that the contrast . . . between the 
progressive agenda and the reactionary impulses of your political opponents . . 
. was as sharp as it is right now?" he asked.

DEMOCRATS WAGE 'CLASS WARFARE,' BUSH CHARGES; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: PRESIDENT EMPHASIZES HIS 'DON'T BLAME ME' THEME AS HE ENTERS THE 
FINAL WEEK OF CAMPAIGNING.

<P>
President Bush stepped up his "don't blame me" campaign theme Monday, accusing 
Democrats of using "tax-the-rich, class warfare . . . garbage" in their 
congressional campaigns and insisting that voters "know I'm against taxes." 
</P>
<P>
At a brief press conference before leaving San Francisco and in a speech at a 
campaign rally at the Cowboy Hall of Fame here for this state's GOP candidate 
for governor, Bush insisted that the tax increases that his top aides helped 
negotiate were "a ransom" that the Administration had to pay to obtain a budget 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
And he denounced "the Democrat Congress" that "turns its back on the American 
dream." 
</P>
<P>
Congress, he said in his speech here, has become "a House of Lords" unable to 
handle its work. "The American people deserve a new Congress," he said, "this 
time a Republican Congress." And the election next Tuesday, he said, should be 
"a referendum on the Democrats' taxing and spending and class warfare. I mean, 
it's absurd." 
</P>
<P>
The new, tougher attacks on the Democrats, which will be repeated again today 
in a speech Bush plans to make at a GOP campaign rally in Washington, are a 
preview of the lines Bush intends to emphasize over the next week of fast-paced 
electioneering as he tries to reverse a serious GOP slump in national polls. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats, he charged, are using an "ugly" campaign of "class warfare" to 
advance their goals. Democratic rhetoric of "soaking the rich," he said, is 
merely a cloak to mask plans to increase taxes on everyone. 
</P>
<P>
And higher taxes, he said, are a "price for divided government" that would not 
have been necessary if Congress contained more Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, however, during months of budget negotiations aimed at meeting Bush's 
goal of reducing the deficit by $500 billion over the next five years, neither 
Bush nor Republicans in Congress ever offered a budget-reduction plan that 
would meet the goal without raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
As Sen. James A. McClure (R-Ida.) pointed out during Senate debate on the 
budget, Democrats have never been willing to call publicly for the taxes that 
would be needed to fund all the programs they prefer and Republicans have never 
been willing to propose politically unpopular spending cuts to avoid the tax 
increases they denounce. 
</P>
<P>
When conservative Republicans in the House revolted against the deficit-cutting 
plan agreed to by Bush and the congressional leadership and tried to draft a 
package of their own without tax increases, they came up hundreds of billions 
of dollars short of the $500 billion target. 
</P>
<P>
As Bush continues to refine the approach he will take on the road later this 
week, Republican strategists continue to comb polls to see which races are now 
close enough to require a presidential visit. The current list, released by the 
White House, confirms that several races Republicans were once confident of 
winning now appear to be close. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, for example, plans to travel to Cincinnati to campaign for George 
Voinovich, the Republican running for governor there. Until recently, Voinovich 
was far ahead in polls, but his Democratic opponent has been rapidly making up 
ground with advertisements accusing Republicans of favoring the rich. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Bush will travel to Minnesota to help Republican Sen. Rudy 
Boschwitz, whose reelection prospects are now in danger. 
</P>
<P>
The President's plans call also for a return over the weekend to California for 
more campaigning on behalf of Sen. Pete Wilson's campaign for governor, as well 
as campaigning in Massachusetts, Florida, Iowa and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bush tried to quell reports of dissension within his White House, 
where Chief of Staff John H. Sununu and Richard G. Darman, director of the 
Office of Management and Budget, have been widely blamed for the political 
damage that Bush has suffered because of the chaos over the budget. 
</P>
<P>
Bush insisted that he is not worried about sharp declines in his popularity, as 
reported in recent polls. 
</P>
<P>
And, without being asked, he volunteered an endorsement of his staff. "I have 
never had more confidence in John Sununu, in Dick Darman, in (Treasury) 
Secretary (Nicholas F.) Brady," Bush said, clearly stung by what he termed 
"mischievous, gossipy reporting" about tensions on the White House staff. 
</P>
<P>
Talk of a staff shake-up "is just crazy," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three, who were the Administration's chief negotiators during the budget 
talks, only Brady, who is a longtime friend of Bush, has escaped widespread 
criticism within the Administration and on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Bush insisted that he is not interested in such "inside-the-Beltway bickering." 
Nonetheless, he offered an unsolicited public defense of his aides. 
</P>
<P>
His host here, gubernatorial candidate Bill Price, seemed to think that his 
guest from Washington needed some bucking up. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahomans "are standing by you through thick and thin," Price said. "George 
Bush on his worst day is a whole lot better than Michael Dukakis on his best 
day."

Successful congressional campaigns often spawn new consultants. 
</P>
<P>
Mal Warwick, a highly successful direct-mail fund-raiser for liberal causes, 
began his career in the early 1970s using a tiny computer in his kitchen to 
raise money for his friend, Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley). 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't even familiar with the term 'direct mail' back then," recalls 
Warwick. "But we knew we weren't going to raise hundreds of thousands of 
dollars by holding barbecues and celebrity cocktail parties." 
</P>
<P>
Today that same computer terminal has a place of honor in the lobby of 
Warwick's posh corporate headquarters here. 
</P>
<P>
Warwick's remarkable success story helps to explain why political consulting 
has become a multibillion-dollar industry, with new firms starting up virtually

Morning Becomes a Revolving Door: Public radio station KCRW-FM's acclaimed 
"Morning Becomes Eclectic" music show is undergoing yet another modification. 
</P>
<P>
The show's longtime host, Tom Schnabel, left the station earlier this month 
after 11 years to pursue a career with A&amp;M Records. Fellow KCRW staffer 
Brent Wilcox took over temporarily while the station searched for Schnabel's 
replacement. Now, the station has decided to audition a variety of hosts over 
the air, and Wilcox has gone back to his early show "Nightland." CLAUDIA PUIG

Just in Time for Sweeps: Michael Tuck, who began as KCBS Channel 2's 6 p.m. 
anchor less than two months ago, will begin offering commentaries on Southern 
California issues every weeknight on the station's 11 p.m. newscast, beginning 
this week. Tuck came to KCBS from the ABC affiliate in San Diego, where he also 
regularly expressed his opinions on the air, won several awards and generated a 
good deal of controversy. KCBS has not had on-air commentaries since Bill Stout 
died last year. CLAUDIA PUIG

'SONNY BOY': BIZARRE BUT TOUCHING COMIC FABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
"Sonny Boy" (selected theaters) sounds like a story from a supermarket tabloid: 
a petty crook and his transvestite lover raise a kidnaped baby boy as an 
animal, caged, brutalized and trained to be a thief and killer. Yet this 
obscure little movie, surfacing without advance notice after two years on the 
shelf, proves darkly amusing and surprisingly touching, thanks to the 
imagination of writer Graeme Whifler and the sensitivity and judgment of 
director Robert Martin Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
A goofy -- what else? -- Brad Dourif steals a Lincoln Continental convertible 
and presents it to his big, beefy boss, Paul L. Smith, a part-time Surrealist 
painter who lives in a desert compound littered with stolen goods. Dourif, 
however, has overlooked the infant in the back seat. Smith figures that the kid 
will bring 10 grand on the black market, but his lover, David Carradine, a 
hairy-chested, cigar-smoking transvestite, won't hear of it. 
</P>
<P>
The story gets under way with Sonny Boy (Michael Griffin), who has had his 
tongue cut out to render him mute, at 17. He has by now developed feelings and 
yearnings that put him at desperate odds with what Smith intends for him. The 
film indulges in some risky religious symbolism, equating Sonny Boy's suffering 
with that of Jesus on the cross, and threatening to go sentimental with an 
angelic blond who shows love for the tortured youth. However, the filmmakers 
wisely opt for a decidedly tentative ending, hitting precisely the right note. 
</P>
<P>
What makes "Sonny Boy" special instead of merely morbid is that Smith and 
Carradine are steadfastly devoted to each other and that, although they are 
world-class abusive parents, they actually care for Sonny Boy after their own 
fashion. The film emerges as a parable about the evil that may surface in 
loving people -- and also how hypocritically indifferent society can be to 
child abuse. It's this human dimension that makes "Sonny Boy" so unsettling, 
yet engaging. 
</P>
<P>
Smith and Carradine resist camp, playing the crazy couple as perfectly sane to 
themselves. Griffin, in a singularly challenging debut, is quite credible as 
the unfortunate "wild child." Dourif's zaniness adds welcome humor, and Conrad 
Janis, as an alcoholic physician, lends a crucial note of sanity amid the 
grotesqueries. "Sonny Boy" (rated an appropriate R) just might end up a cult 
film.

AMERICAN SETTLES LIBEL SUIT WITH SOVIETS; 
</P>
<P>
LITIGATION: THE RUSSIAN NEGOTIATORS ADMIT THAT THE CHARGES OF SPYING WERE A 
MISUNDERSTANDING, BUSINESSMAN'S LAWYER SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After years of litigation between a Palo Alto businessman and the Soviet Union, 
a settlement was reached on the American's lawsuit charging Moscow with libel 
for accusing him of being a spy and breach of contract, it was announced 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied," the businessman, Raphael Gregorian, 61, said in a telephone 
interview. "It was a mutual decision." 
</P>
<P>
Gregorian's Los Angeles attorney, Gerald L. Kroll, said Soviet negotiators 
admitted to "a misunderstanding" in accusing his client of spying. "It's 
probably the first time ever the Soviets accused someone of spying and then 
admitted it was a misunderstanding," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The international legal tangle was broken 18 months ago when Kroll had a chance 
meeting in Los Angeles with Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. 
Gerasimov, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
"He suggested steps to take to resolve it," Kroll said. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the settlement, affirmed last week by U.S. District Judge David V. 
Kenyon in Los Angeles, were kept confidential. Signing it along with Kroll were 
American lawyers representing Medexport, a Soviet government firm. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Gregorian was a welcome figure in Moscow business circles. His 
California International Trade Corp. generated $10 million a year in sales 
exporting such items as kidney dialysis and heart-lung machines and batteries 
for heart pacemakers. Suddenly, in 1984, the Soviets revoked his permit to sell 
medical supplies. Shortly afterward, the Soviet newspaper Izvestia printed a 
story denouncing Gregorian, accusing him of bribery, smuggling and espionage. 
</P>
<P>
Gregorian maintained his innocence and declared that the article destroyed his 
reputation. He claimed the Soviets trumped up espionage charges to avoid paying 
him. Then, doing what no one had done before, he sued the Soviet Union in U.S. 
courts for libel. He also demanded that the Soviets pay for medical equipment 
still in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Kenyon entered a default judgment against the Soviet Union, awarding 
Gregorian total damages of $413,165, consisting of a $250,000 libel award 
against Izvestia and $163,165 in breach-of-contract damages. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets balked, angering Kroll who, in one colorful episode, took custody 
of a typewriter at an Izvestia correspondent's Washington home as partial 
payment. 
</P>
<P>
Following legal maneuvering, in which the U.S. State Department held that the 
Soviet Union was a sovereign power immune from legal action, Kenyon dismissed 
the libel award, but ruled in 1987 that the Soviets still owed Gregorian the 
$163,165 balance. 
</P>
<P>
Kroll appealed to a federal appellate court, which reversed Kenyon's decision 
and sent the case back to the federal judge last year for a new trial. The 
settlement precludes a trial.

EU WANTS CHARGES FILED AGAINST FLORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an unusually harsh attack on her Republican rival, Democratic Secretary of 
State March Fong Eu demanded Monday that the attorney general file criminal or 
civil charges against challenger Joan Milke Flores for missing a filing 
deadline for financial disclosure statements. 
</P>
<P>
In letters to the state Department of Justice and the Fair Political Practices 
Commission, Eu's campaign accused Flores of filing her most recent statement 
several days late "in a ploy obviously calculated to conceal for as long as 
possible" the $418,000 in contributions she collected in October. 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswomen for both government agencies said they would review the request, 
but had no comment on the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
During the three-week reporting period ending Oct. 20, Flores raised $139,000 
in cash, $4,400 in other gifts and $275,000 in a loan from wealthy San Pedro 
businessman Tom Papadakis. Eu, by contrast, raised just $46,000 -- all in cash 
-- during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony L. Miller, Eu's top deputy, said Flores' campaign statement arrived at 
the secretary of state's office in Sacramento on Monday by first-class mail. 
Under state law, the statement had to be hand-delivered by last Thursday or 
sent that day by guaranteed overnight delivery. 
</P>
<P>
"This delay was particularly significant given the court's stay of the 
Proposition 73 contribution limits and the public's interest in knowing the 
extent to which candidates are once again relying on huge contributions from 
special interest groups to fund campaigns," wrote Leo McElroy, Eu's campaign 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Flores was campaigning and was unavailable for comment, but an aide denied that 
the three-term Los Angeles councilwoman attempted to hide her contributions. 
Deputy campaign manager Dora B. Kingsley said the late filing was a mailing 
error and she accused Eu of overreacting. 
</P>
<P>
"We put the wrong stamp on it," Kinglsey said. "Their campaign is going down 
the toilet, and they are panicking." 
</P>
<P>
Flores' ability to raise funds has become a sore point for Eu, who finds 
herself in the peculiar position of being outspent by a virtual unknown in her 
first bid for statewide office. Since the end of June, Flores has spent 
$775,000, while Eu, a four-term incumbent, has spent $528,000. 
</P>
<P>
Eu's inability to compete with Flores financially was clearly illustrated last 
week when Eu launched her television advertising campaign. The vast majority of 
voters will never see the commercials because Eu cannot afford to broadcast 
them in Southern California or in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, by contrast, has been airing television ads statewide for more than 
three weeks, spending about $440,000 on an advertising campaign that is 
expected to continue through Election Day. Flores borrowed $275,000 from 
Papadakis, who heads her campaign committee, to pay for the television spots, 
which she views as crucial to any hopes for an upset. 
</P>
<P>
Recent polls show Flores a distant second to Eu, but the gap has been 
narrowing. The Los Angeles Times Poll last week showed Eu leading Flores by a 
2-1 margin, compared to an almost 4-1 margin in August. Kinglsey said internal 
polling shows Flores trailing Eu by 10 percentage points, although she would 
not release data substantiating the claim. 
</P>
<P>
Eu's campaign officials denied that they are panicking, but acknowledged that 
they are concerned about Flores' ability to broadcast television ads during the 
final week of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that I would perceive any serious danger in this race," McElroy 
said last week in unveiling Eu's television ads. "But it would be silly for us 
to put this campaign to bed with unspent campaign money. I just don't believe 
in taking chances." 
</P>
<P>
Eu began airing 30-second television commercials Wednesday on stations in 
Fresno, Bakersfield, Sacramento, Monterey and San Luis Obispo. The ads are 
expected to run through Nov. 5 at a cost of $89,000. She has also launched a 
$180,000 statewide radio campaign, which is intended to make up for the lack of 
television ads in the state's two largest media markets. 
</P>
<P>
None of the ads mention Flores, focusing instead on Eu's distaste for negative 
campaigning.

TRAFFIC TICKETS ON VERGE OF ENTERING COMPUTER AGE;

A hand-held computer that will allow police to print out instant traffic 
tickets and eventually let motorists pay fines on the spot with credit cards 
was unveiled by the California Highway Patrol on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The program -- the first of its kind in the country -- will be tested in a 
$60,000 pilot project in Ventura County. The CHP has equipped officers with 12 
computers and portable printers to cut down on the time and paperwork required 
to process handwritten tickets. 
</P>
<P>
If the program proves successful, the Highway Patrol plans to implement 
automated ticketing throughout California within three years, said Maury 
Hannigan, commissioner of the Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
The computers, about seven inches long, can provide information on a driver's 
hair and eye color and vehicle type with the punching of a few keys, said 
officials demonstrating the equipment at the Conejo Commercial Vehicle 
Inspection Facility on the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
And when the Department of Motor Vehicles begins issuing licenses with magnetic 
strips in selected counties in December, law enforcement officials hope to use 
the computer to tap into the National Crime Information Center and obtain 
records of previous arrests and outstanding warrants. 
</P>
<P>
Within five years, the computer could be used to accept credit cards from 
motorists who opt to post bail without leaving their cars, Lt. Claude LeMond 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The 21st Century is less than 10 years away and law enforcement needs to take 
advantage of technological advances if it is to keep pace with today's world," 
Hannigan said. 
</P>
<P>
It now takes as much as a month for motorists to receive information about 
their fines or court appearances, said Sheila Gonzalez, executive officer of 
the Ventura County Superior and Municipal Courts. Ventura County alone 
processes 6,500 tickets, many of them difficult to read or containing errors, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
With the computers, violators will be able to receive information about their 
fine within 24 hours, she said.

WOMAN JAILED IN HUSBAND'S DEATH RELEASED 
</P>

On her 75th birthday and slightly more than 24 hours after police raided her 
home, a Redondo Beach woman was released from jail Monday after declining to 
answer police questions about the death of her 79-year-old husband, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Seifert was arrested Sunday and booked for investigation of murder in the 
death Saturday morning of Melvin Seifert, who police said died at his home of 
an "injected overdose of a controlled substance." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Schaeffer, 69, a prominent Rolling Hills Estates doctor who treated 
Seifert's ailing husband, was also arrested and declined to talk with police, 
investigators said. Schaeffer was expected to be released early today. 
</P>
<P>
A coroner's spokesman said results of autopsy lab tests would not be available 
until later this week. Deputy Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said the investigation 
of Seifert's death could be completed by the end of next week. 
</P>
<P>
Friends of Seifert and Schaeffer called the arrests an outrage. Seifert's 
family declined to comment Monday or to provide the name of her attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach police said Melvin Seifert was a retired coach and something of a 
legend at Redondo Beach Union High School. One colleague referred to him as Mr. 
Redondo. 
</P>
<P>
Police released few details on the arrests. Lt. John Nelson said that after 24 
hours of investigative work by at least eight detectives, police served search 
warrants Sunday morning at Schaeffer's home in a gated community in Rolling 
Hills Estates, at his Redondo Beach office and at the Seifert residence. 
</P>
<P>
Police took possession of Seifert's body Saturday morning at a Redondo Beach 
funeral home. Nelson said Mary Seifert had planned to have her husband's body 
cremated. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a substantial amount of evidence here," Nelson said, but he declined 
to provide details. "We feel that this case is of a very serious nature and is 
in fact a homicide and should be prosecuted as a murder. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the fact that Dr. Schaeffer is a prominent doctor in the community 
was something we took into consideration," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson declined to discuss a possible motive for the alleged crime. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeffer, a general practitioner, has worked in Redondo Beach for 45 years, 
according to his secretary, Margie Welker. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeffer had begun visiting the Seifert home in the last week because Melvin 
Seifert's condition had deteriorated to the point that his wife could no longer 
bring him into the office, Welker said. Melvin Seifert suffered from 
Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, she said. Schaeffer visited the 
Seifert home on Saturday, Welker said, because Melvin Seifert was suffering 
breathing problems. 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor also said that Melvin Seifert's condition had worsened recently. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw Mary (Seifert) a week ago," said Betty Uhls. "I said, 'How is Mel?' She 
said, 'Betty, I think I'm going to put Melvin in a nursing home.' " 
</P>
<P>
Uhls added: "In the four years Melvin was ill I never saw a woman more devoted 
to a husband than Mary. She wouldn't even get her hair done. She turned their 
living room into a hospital room." 
</P>
<P>
Uhls said it was difficult for Mary Seifert to care for her husband because she 
has only partial use of one of her arms. 
</P>
<P>
Friends and patients of Schaeffer expressed outrage at his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot believe that they would have put him in a lockup of any kind," said 
Joan Hughes, 60, a longtime patient who credits the doctor with saving the life 
of her husband. "He's not a killer. He's a God-fearing man, a wonderful man." 
</P>
<P>
At Schaeffer's office in Redondo Beach -- where Western paintings and the 
Hippocratic oath decorate the walls -- Welker said the doctor's telephone was 
"ringing off the hook." Friends and colleagues called with messages of support 
and concern, saying "he would never (murder anyone) . . . he has saved too many 
lives, he cares about life too much," Welker said. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Municipal Judge Benjamin Aranda withdrew Seifert's arrest warrant 
Monday morning, allowing her to be freed. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said that "due to her age and for humanitarian reasons," police did not 
object. "Her release from custody should not be construed as (an admission) of 
any weakness in this case," he said.

PARENTS WANT CELIBACY AS SOLE AIDS LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Angry parents who say sexual abstinence should be the sole method of AIDS 
prevention taught to their children are challenging plans by the Los Angeles 
school district to revamp AIDS education. 
</P>
<P>
During a public hearing Monday, the parents voiced opposition to discussions of 
safe sex or graphic descriptions of how the AIDS virus is transmitted. The 
parents also complained that they are not adequately represented on a task 
force that is charged with evaluating the curriculum and recommending changes. 
</P>
<P>
Rachel Martinez of Pacoima, whose 13 grandchildren attend district schools, 
said she was unaware until several weeks ago about some of the more explicit 
sexual descriptions used to teach children about AIDS. The district should stop 
treating parents like "a bunch of dummies" and leave sex education to parental 
discretion, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The task force, composed of parents, district administrators, medical experts, 
health teachers, members of the gay community and others, is sifting through 
mountains of information and is expected to make its recommendation to the 
school board by January. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred S. Moore, an assistant school superintendent and coordinator of the task 
force, responded to the complaints by stressing that his group is collecting 
information from a "full spectrum of divergent views" and has reached no 
conclusions. Moore said abstinence is already stressed in the existing 
curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases have been discussed in health 
classes since 1986, when the district developed a model program that has been 
adopted by other school systems, said Ruth Rich, the district's instructional 
specialist for health education. 
</P>
<P>
Students must obtain signed letters of parental consent before attending 
classes in which they are taught how AIDS is transmitted and ways to prevent 
infection. In addition, condoms are available to high school students at three 
on-site health clinics run by the district, Erlich said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those at the hearing criticized the district for including the gay 
community on its task force. 
</P>
<P>
"Going to the gay and lesbian community and asking for input about sex 
education is like going to a bar and asking a drunk how to stop drinking; it's 
totally irresponsible," said Fabian Asensio, a citizen member of the task force 
from Sherman Oaks. He urged that the district teach students to remain celibate 
until marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Another member of the task force defended the teaching of safe sex and AIDS 
prevention. "We're not saying, 'Kids go out and have sex,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Abstinence . . . is always desired. (But) there's also the reality that not 
all kids will follow that. Therefore . . . you try to give them some 
guidelines."

RECREATION: THE COUNTY MEASURE WOULD PAY FOR IMPROVEMENTS FROM THE BEACHES TO

WRONG PURPOSES.

<P>
Imagine a ballot measure supported by such ideological opposites as 
conservative Supervisor Mike Antonovich and liberal Assemblyman Tom Hayden 
(D-Santa Monica) and endorsed by such diverse groups as the Sierra Club, 
Southern Christian Leadership Conference and Los Angeles Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
Such a measure on next Tuesday's ballot is Proposition B, the largest bond 
proposal in Los Angeles County history. It would increase property taxes to pay 
for $817 million of recreational and cultural projects. 
</P>
<P>
The widespread political support it enjoys is no accident. The authors of 
Proposition B fashioned the measure to win the backing of a broad 
cross-section: from arts lovers and environmentalists to fishermen, inner-city 
groups and law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
Widely known and described on the ballot as the Safe Neighborhood Parks Act, 
Proposition B's scope is actually much broader and includes funding for trout 
habitats, the Hollywood Bowl, a mountain camp for troubled youths, beaches, the 
County Museum of Art and the zoo. The measure also provides for hiring 
unemployed youngsters to plant trees and remove graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by two-thirds of the voters, money would go to more than 80 
projects, "so many that regardless of where you live in the county, there is 
something that will benefit you," said Esther Feldman, campaign manager of 
Citizens for Safe Neighborhood Parks. 
</P>
<P>
The bond would add about $20 a year -- or $404 over the 20-year bond payment 
period -- to the tax bill of a home assessed at $250,000, county officials 
said. On a home assessed at $125,000, the countywide average, the increase 
would be about $10 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Signing the ballot argument against the measure are county Supervisor Pete 
Schabarum, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. and Los Angeles Taxpayers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents say the measure is sponsored by a "group of self-serving individuals 
whose primary interest is to get the public to buy private land in the Santa 
Monica Mountains. They enticed others to support this bond measure by promising 
financing for their pet projects." 
</P>
<P>
Feldman came up with the idea for the omnibus funding act two years ago, while 
she was working for the Malibu-based Mountains Recreation and Conservation 
Authority. The organization's goal is to preserve open space in the Santa 
Monica Mountains and establish a "Rim of the Valley Trail" in the mountains 
extending from Pasadena through the San Fernando Valley into southern Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, if approved, would provide $76 million to the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy to buy parkland and establish recreational facilities in 
that mountain range. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the bond proceeds would go to projects throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the county's 86 cities would receive a share, with the money parceled 
out on a per-capita basis. The city of Los Angeles, with 3.4 million residents, 
would get $55 million, while Vernon, with just 152 residents, would draw 
$20,000. This money, totaling $140 million, would be spent as the cities see 
fit. 
</P>
<P>
The omnibus funding act also provides money for specific projects. They 
include: restoration of the Hollywood Bowl, including replacing the aging band 
shell, $35 million; improvements to exhibit space at the Los Angeles Zoo, $30 
million; improvements to the Griffith Observatory, $13 million, and upgrading 
recreational facilities at Los Angeles city public housing projects, $4.7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The ballot measure would also provide $1.7 million to aid crime-plagued 
MacArthur Park, allow for construction of trails connecting parks in the Simi 
Hills, Santa Susana Mountains, Santa Clarita Valley and Antelope Valley, at $3 
million, and fund restoration of habitats for native steelhead trout in 
mountain streams, for $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The bond also would provide $10 million for grants to be awarded by the Board 
of Supervisors to public agencies and nonprofit groups to hire troubled youths 
to remove graffiti. There is another $10 million for the supervisors to award 
to organizations for developing recreational uses along the Los Angeles and San 
Gabriel rivers, $10 million for planting trees in urban areas, and $15 million 
for restoring historical sites. 
</P>
<P>
The measure also would provide $50 million for beach improvements, $10 million 
to county botanical gardens, $13 million to the Museum of Natural History, $10 
million to the County Museum of Art and $20 million to the California Museum of 
Science and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Palos Verdes Estates has opposed the measure because, according to 
the city's research, only nine of the county's 86 cities would "get more money 
out of it than they would pay," said City Manager Jim Hendrickson. Residents of 
Palos Verdes Estates would pay at least $3.5 million in higher taxes, but the 
city would receive only $241,000, Hendrickson said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all in favor of open space," the city manager said. "But with all the 
other problems facing the county, such as AIDS and the homeless, we don't 
believe that the largest bond issue in county history should be dedicated to 
these purposes." 
</P>
<P>
Feldman responded: "To say there is no benefit because they don't directly get 
the money is ridiculous." She said the residents of every city benefit from 
regional projects, such as improvements to the beaches and Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Fox, president of Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn., and Jay Curtis, president 
of Los Angeles Taxpayers Assn., object because the bond seeks to do too much. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis said that voters have approved nearly $3 billion in state park bonds in 
the last 16 years. He also said the ballot includes Proposition 149, a 
$437-million state park bond. 
</P>
<P>
"It is just unconscionable how much the politicians are asking the people to 
tax themselves," Curtis said. "It's time they did their job, set priorities." 
</P>
<P>
Feldman said the local park projects have received only a fraction of state 
park bond funds. Of the $776-million state park bond approved by voters in 
June, 1988, Los Angeles County received $120 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors placed the measure on the ballot against the advice of 
Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon. He expressed concern that the 
park bond would jeopardize a half-cent sales tax increase for jails on the 
November ballot and a proposed 1992 billion-dollar bond to rebuild aging 
County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a tragedy if the electorate became reluctant to finance critical 
jail needs and future health facility requirements because of the property tax 
increase resulting from the park bond," Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich said the park bond will bring "a new dimension of safety to our park 
and recreation facilities by including diversion programs that will steer our 
young people away from gang activities and drug use and toward healthy, 
productive recreational opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Feldman said supporters have raised more than $530,000 in contributions, 
including $215,000 from the Los Angeles Philharmonic Assn., $95,000 from the 
Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn., and $20,000 from Supervisor Ed Edelman's 
reelection fund. Supporters plan to send a mailer to voters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PROPOSITION B 
</P>
<P>
The county's Proposition B would fund $817 million worth of improvements to 
parkland, beaches, community facilities and youth programs. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the broad-ranging measure would help pay for upgrading 
trout streams, the Hollywood Bowl, the county Museum of Art, the Griffith 
Observatory and the zoo. Here is a sampling of where the money will go. 
</P>
<P>
A. County Beaches and Harbors, $50 million to acquire, develop and restore 
beaches and public access. 
</P>
<P>
B. Hollywood Bowl: $35 million for rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
C. Los Angeles Zoo: $30 million to improve exhibit space and infrastucture. 
</P>
<P>
D. County Museum of Natural History: $13 million for infrastucture. 
</P>
<P>
E. County Museum of Art: $10 million to improve facilities. 
</P>
<P>
F. Griffith Observatory: $13 million for infrastucture, planetarium and 
education center. 
</P>
<P>
G. Trout Streams: $5 million to restore wild trout and native steelhead habitat 
in coastal and mountain streams. 
</P>
<P>
H. Venice Waterfront Restoration: $10 million for the pier, recreation center, 
Ballona Lagoon, beach path and park. 
</P>
<P>
I. Belmont Pier in Long Beach: $1.5 million to renovate fishing facilities and 
public access. 
</P>
<P>
J. Rim of the Valley Parks and Trails: $20 million to buy and build trails and 
parks around the San Fernando Valley to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
K. Hansen Dam Recreation Area: $15 million for 15-acre swimming lake and pier. 
</P>
<P>
L. Whittier Hills: $15 million for land, trails and visitor center next to 
Hellman Park. 
</P>
<P>
M. North County Athletic Complex: $8 million to buy and develop park in 
Lancaster-Palmdale region.

As the time approached for Ayanna Woodard to graduate from high school, the 
17-year-old spent her time like many other seniors: poring over brochures and 
touring schools in search of a college that would fit her needs. 
</P>
<P>
She was concerned about the cost of tuition, distance from her home in Sylmar, 
and the college's size. Woodard also wanted to find a college that would fill a 
void in her high school education, which she said failed to recognize the 
contributions of African-Americans in science, literature, history and every 
other area of study. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time you finish high school all you know about is slavery, how we got 
chased off our land and stuck here," the Kennedy High School graduate said. 
"They don't teach you about your background at all -- you have to go home to 
your black colleges for that." 
</P>
<P>
Now 18, Woodard is a student at Tuskegee Institute, a black college in 
Tuskegee, Ala., thanks in part to a business in Sepulveda that takes 
prospective students on tours of black colleges. 
</P>
<P>
While the percentage of African-Americans attending college has plummeted 
during the past decade, enrollments at many of the nation's 104 historically 
black colleges and universities are on the rise, creating what Christopher F. 
Edley, United Negro College Fund president and chief executive officer, called 
a black college "renaissance." 
</P>
<P>
The reasons vary from lower tuition costs to a concern about racial incidents 
on predominantly white campuses. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in these schools," said Yasmin Delahoussaye, who with her husband, 
Greg, runs Educational Student Tours in Sepulveda. "The sense of warmth, the 
sense of belonging, the sense of history and heritage is what's attracting 
students to black colleges," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Yasmin Delahoussaye was a junior high and high school teacher and counselor in 
the San Fernando Valley for nearly 15 years and now is a college counselor at 
Pierce College. Greg Delahoussaye teaches at Sherman Oaks Center for Enriched 
Studies. 
</P>
<P>
In her search for a college, Woodard and her parents consulted the 
Delahoussayes. Believed to be the only service of its kind in Southern 
California, Educational Student Tours introduces students to traditionally 
black colleges through consultations and visits to campuses. 
</P>
<P>
Started last year, the company has taken about 100 students on tours of such 
schools as Howard University in Washington, Morehouse College in Atlanta and 
Hampton University in Hampton, Va. For about $700 -- which includes air fare, 
room and board -- students tour for five to six days, visiting the schools and 
talking to students and faculty. 
</P>
<P>
TaRessa Stone Stovall, a spokeswoman for Spelman College in Atlanta, said 
businesses such as Educational Student Tours have helped increase awareness of 
black colleges and universities. "While we work hard . . . you can never truly 
do enough," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Stovall said the tours point out the diversity among the campuses. "We are not 
a homogenous and predictable group," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The tours can be a deciding factor for some students, said J. J. Johnson, a 
spokesman for Tuskegee Institute who has worked with the Delahoussayes. "We 
like what they are doing and we hope they continue doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Jeri Holden, a guidance counselor at Kennedy High School, has had four students 
attend tours with the Delahoussayes. Holden said the tours helped fill a void 
and inspired the students to achieve. "There's not a lot of information 
available about the schools," Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
The Delahoussayes opened their business at a time of both promise and despair 
for black students in higher education. 
</P>
<P>
According to the American Council on Education's annual status report on 
minorities in higher education, the percentage of low-income black high school 
graduates going to college plummeted from 40% to 30% between 1976 and 1988, and 
the enrollment rate for middle-income blacks fell from 53% to 36%. 
</P>
<P>
Those trends have widened the gap between white and black college attendance. 
Even so, enrollment at some black colleges is up. 
</P>
<P>
The United Negro College Fund reports that applications have increased at 
two-thirds of the 41 fund-affiliated institutions. Between 1986 and 1989, 
enrollment at the schools increased 13%. 
</P>
<P>
Franklyn G. Jenifer, president of Howard University -- known as one of the 
leading black schools -- said the rise was the result of events in the 
mid-1980s that made life uncomfortable for black students at predominantly 
white institutions. 
</P>
<P>
During the Reagan Administration the amount of federal grant money declined 
drastically while the cost of college tuitions increased, Jenifer said. 
</P>
<P>
The average cost of the 41 United Negro College Fund institutions is 38% less 
than for comparable private colleges in the South and is about half that 
charged by private four-year colleges nationally. 
</P>
<P>
After going on a tour with the Delahoussayes, Woodard won a scholarship to 
Tuskegee. She said she was attracted to the small classes, homey feel of the 
campus town and history of the institute -- once home to noted scientist George 
Washington Carver and scholar Booker T. Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The Delahoussayes said there are no black colleges in California and few 
students even know the schools exist. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the black schools were established after the Civil War by churches and 
other institutions to educate freed slaves. The schools became the primary 
educators of blacks in this country, graduating such influential figures as Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. and author Ralph Ellison. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the students are inspired by their first visit to a black college. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been in an environment like that," said 16-year-old Eryn Houston of 
El Camino High School in Woodland Hills.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-TAX COLLECTOR GETS 5 YEARS IN INVESTMENT 
SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Orange County tax collector was sentenced Monday to five years in 
prison in a tax evasion and fraud case involving a gold mining investment scam. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon sentenced Harold Nichols, 61, after a Los 
Angeles jury found him guilty on July 10 of three counts of tax evasion, one 
count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and two counts of using a 
false Social Security number. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols and a business partner, John Fulton, 63, raised nearly $2 million 
between 1983 and 1985 by seeking investments for purported gold mining 
ventures, then pocketed some of the cash, said Assistant U.S. Atty. David 
Sklansky. He said Nichols kept about $470,000, using the money to buy a house 
in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, and to support a mistress. 
</P>
<P>
Fulton pleaded guilty to related charges last year and was sentenced in 
February to two years in prison, three years probation and a $10,000 fine.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUROR GETS 5 MONTHS IN PRISON FOR TAMPERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A juror in the election fraud trial of businessman Michael Goland was sentenced 
Monday to five months in prison for offering the defendant his choice of 
verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Kuhnke, 33, of Huntington Beach, also was sentenced to five months in a 
halfway house and two years probation. 
</P>
<P>
He was ordered to report to prison by Nov. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhnke pleaded guilty to passing a note to Goland during jury deliberations in 
Los Angeles, telling the pro-Israel activist he could arrange for one of two 
verdicts in the case, but wanted to know which outcome Goland preferred. 
</P>
<P>
Goland was convicted in May on charges stemming from an illegal $120,000 
campaign contribution made to a minor candidate as part of his attempt to 
manipulate the 1986 U.S. Senate race into a victory for Alan Cranston 
(D-Calif.) 
</P>
<P>
In sentencing Kuhnke, U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie called the juror's 
actions "an assault on the criminal justice system and for all that it stands."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PUBLIC'S HELP SOUGHT IN MOTORIST'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with a dearth of leads after three months of investigation, detectives 
Monday sought the public's help in solving the slaying of a man whose car was 
apparently mistaken for a gang member's. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Jones, 21, who was known as "C.J." to friends, was shot and killed 
early on Aug. 4 as he and two friends drove through a South San Gabriel 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Rich Erickson said the trio's white Toyota Corolla may have been 
misidentified by area gang members as one belonging to a rival, possibly after 
Jones and his friends drove by a large party. 
</P>
<P>
Jones was riding in the back seat of the car when a bullet ripped through the 
rear of the vehicle and struck him. Investigators are unsure where the bullets 
came from. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson said Jones of Temple City had grown up in the South San Gabriel area 
and may have been showing his friends his old neighborhood.

<P>
Two separate predawn bombings destroyed mailboxes and wakened residents Monday 
in Scripps Ranch and northern La Jolla, police said. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the blasts, which involved "quite powerful" devices, said 
Tom Taylor, an inspector with the U.S. Postal Service in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The bombs, Taylor said, were "very sophisticated" and distinct from the 
standard homemade pipe-like devices that are frequently employed by amateur 
bombers. However, police said authorities had not immediately determined what 
type of explosives were used. 
</P>
<P>
There was no known motive for the bombings, which occurred about an hour apart. 
Authorities would not say if the devices were intended to injure people or 
simply cause property damage. No suspects were in custody, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police would also not say whether the two incidents were definitively linked. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday afternoon, Taylor said, postal inspectors received an anonymous 
telephone call claiming responsibility for the bombings. The caller made no 
threats, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Postal Service is investigating the bombings, as is the Metro Arson 
Strike Team, which is composed of San Diego police and fire authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The first bombing occurred shortly after 3 a.m. on the corner of Via Aprilia 
and Carmel Valley Road in northern La Jolla. Police responding to calls of an 
explosion in the area found a mailbox blown apart and pieces of mail scattered 
over the street, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The second blast happened about an hour later at 9950 Avenida Magnifica near 
the Scripps Ranch area, police said. Officers found a similar scene of 
scattered correspondence and a destroyed mailbox.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TEACHER CHARGED WITH EMBEZZLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A teacher in the Inglewood Unifed School District has been charged with grand 
theft and embezzlement for allegedly setting up a personal bank account to bilk 
the school district, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Matthews, who was principal of Hillcrest Continuation High School at 
the time of the alleged thefts and has since been demoted, was arraigned last 
week in Los Angeles Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
He pleaded not guilty to 14 counts of embezzlement and one count of grand theft 
involving as much as $4,000. His attorney, Carl Douglas, said Matthews plans to 
"vigorously deny that he committed any wrongdoing or illegality." 
</P>
<P>
Matthews, who could not be reached for comment, is accused of depositing school 
funds in the unauthorized account over a 16-month period beginning in 1986, and 
using the money to cover such personal needs as groceries, cosmetics and a $218 
Nativity scene that was ordered for the school but sent to his home.

PREPARING FOR 'THE BIG ONE' 
</P>

<P>
The county and all 86 of its incorporated cities staged a daylong 
earthquake-response drill Monday, dubbed "Disaster Response '90." The exercise 
was staged to evaluate the county's ability to assess the damage from a quake 
in Willowbrook and communicate with the cities, said Richard B. Dixon, county 
chief administrative officer. Included among the tests were the response to a 
collision between a chemical tanker truck and a van; helicopter transport of 
victims, and emergency evacuation of residents within a hazardous materials 
zone.

BINGO RAID EVIDENCE PRESENTED; 
</P>
<P>
IDENTITY INC.: TORN-UP CHECKS FOUND IN TRASH CANS WERE UNCASHED PAYMENTS FROM 
WORKERS' RELATIVES, POLICE SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Some relatives and wives of workers at the city's biggest charity bingo parlor 
might have played for free because their checks were found torn up in a trash 
can during a recent police raid, according to evidence presented Monday during 
an administrative hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The uncashed checks -- including one written by the wife of an off-duty Los 
Angeles police officer who worked as a security guard -- were pieced together 
by police and presented during the third day of a city hearing that could lead 
to revocation of the bingo license held by Identity Inc. 
</P>
<P>
City investigators said they believe the destroyed checks were payment for 
bingo cards and that those who wrote them ended up playing the game for free, 
an illegal misappropriation of charitable funds. 
</P>
<P>
Edith Ryan, founder of the Woodland Hills charity that helps disabled people, 
is accused of illegally paying those who run the games, a violation of state 
law. Three former workers have testified that they were paid between $100 and 
$300 a night. Ryan has denied these claims and has said her accusers lied and 
stole money from the Identity bingo operation. 
</P>
<P>
The accusations of the volunteers are under investigation by the Los Angeles 
Police Department's Internal Affairs Division, and Monday's hearing was 
monitored by a sergeant with that unit. 
</P>
<P>
Two current Police Department officers, who said they worked off-duty at 
Identity, testified Monday that they were unaware of any illegal payments to 
the volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
The checks were introduced by Assistant City Atty. Byron Boeckman after Ken 
Welch, a bingo volunteer at Identity, testified on behalf of Ryan that he was 
not paid to help run the games. 
</P>
<P>
One of the checks found during the Aug. 19 search was written by Welch's 
mother. The $65 check represents the amount charged for three packs of bingo 
cards, a standard amount purchased by players. 
</P>
<P>
In questioning Welch, Boeckman indicated that a financial benefit to his mother 
also benefited Welch, who lives with his mother. 
</P>
<P>
Also, a $65 check written by Nancy Hurwitz, the wife of Los Angeles police 
Officer Ken Hurwitz, was found among the discarded checks. Ken Hurwitz was 
working off-duty as a security guard the night of the raid. 
</P>
<P>
Two other torn checks totaling $115 and drawn on accounts of relatives of 
Identity volunteers were also found in the trash can, and a check for $97 
written by a woman described by investigators as a friend of Ryan's was 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
In early testimony Monday, Ken Hurwitz said he never saw any illegal payments 
to workers at Identity while working as a paid security guard. Under state law, 
security guards can be paid with bingo proceeds although the volunteers who run 
the game can not. 
</P>
<P>
After testifying, Hurwitz declined to discuss whether his wife or other 
officers' wives played for free. 
</P>
<P>
Another police officer, Ronald Ponzi, also said he never saw any payments to 
volunteers or heard workers discussing the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, three former Identity workers made accusations to a Times reporter 
that officers knew of the payments to volunteers. Under oath Monday, Debra 
Basham and Cindy Houseman, two of the three former workers who said they were 
paid, testified that they believed officers were present when volunteers talked 
about compensation. 
</P>
<P>
"Conversations? I'm sure they overheard conversations," Basham said. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan's attorneys sought to discredit Basham's testimony by reading from sworn 
statments she made in June, 1984, denying that she had profited from working 
for Identity. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of Monday's hearing Ryan was allowed to respond under oath to two 
Times articles that repeated allegations of possible police misconduct. She 
said contrary to news reports, she instructed officers to closely monitor 
workers whom she suspected could be "diverting or mishandling funds."

SERVICE SET FOR VETERAN OF ELITE NAVY UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Memorial services will be held today for retired Chief Petty Officer Frank 
Joseph Foss, 66, a longtime member of the Navy's elite Underwater Demolition 
Teams, who died of cancer in his home Oct. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Foss joined the elite unit, forerunner of today's Navy SEAL teams, just before 
the Korean War and remained a member until his retirement in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Foss was born in Pawtucket, R.I. He enlisted in the Navy when he was 17 and, 
during World War II, served in North Africa, where he assisted French 
Legionnaires. He left the Navy after the war but reenlisted a short time later, 
volunteering for the Underwater Demolition Team. 
</P>
<P>
In 1966, he joined the U.S. Agency for International Development and served as 
a logistics adviser in Vietnam for eight years. He received several citations 
for bravery during the 1968 Tet offensive. 
</P>
<P>
Foss was a 40-year resident of Coronado and Imperial Beach, and helped found 
the first Fleet Reserve branch in Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
After his return from Vietnam, Foss settled in Imperial Beach, where he devoted 
much of his time to writing a book about his duty in Vietnam. The book will be 
sent to a publisher early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Foss is survived by eight children, Stephan Foss and Stewart Foss of Rhode 
Island; Frank J. Foss Jr. of Coronado; Duncan Foss and William Foss of Imperial 
Beach; Martita Foss-Ricketson of Oceanside; Margaret Foss of San Marcos; Maria 
Foss of Chula Vista and seven grandchildren. He is also survived by four 
brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Memorial services will be held at 3:30 p.m. today at the chapel at the Navy 
Amphibious Base in Coronado. His ashes will be scattered at sea with full 
military honors. The family asks that any remembrances be sent to the San Diego 
Hospice.

SERGEANT TO GIVE UP NOTES ON DRUG RAID AT 39TH AND DALTON; 
</P>
<P>
POLICE: PROSECUTORS HAD DEMANDED TO SEE THE RECORDS, COMPILED DURING AN 
INVESTIGATION OF FOUR OFFICERS ACCUSED OF VANDALIZING APARTMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARRELL DAWSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles police sergeant who worked on a case involving four other 
officers accused of vandalizing apartments in South Los Angeles agreed Monday 
to bow to prosecutors' demands to see records that he had compiled. 
</P>
<P>
After a closed meeting with prosecutors, an attorney for Sgt. Robert Kavanaugh 
said he would turn over by Nov. 26 all records from Kavanaugh's investigation 
into a 1988 drug raid in which the officers allegedly destroyed property at an 
apartment complex located at Dalton Avenue and 39th Street. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had subpoenaed the records, saying it was improper for a police 
officer to assist in the criminal defense of the accused officers. 
</P>
<P>
Kavanaugh's attorney, Cecil Marr, said he doubted that the records would add 
any information that would benefit the prosecution's case. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Municipal Court Judge Larry P. Fidler postponed for 
five months the vandalism trial to allow new defense attorney Barry Levin, who 
is representing Capt. Thomas Elfmont, time to prepare for the case. Elfmont 
hired Levin after the judge removed from the case the police captain's first 
attorney, James Wilson, because of conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Elfmont, Officers Charles Wilson and Ted Parrick and Sgt. Charles 
(Ted) Spicer are charged with vandalism and conspiracy to commit vandalism as a 
result of an Aug. 1, 1988, raid at the apartments, which police said turned up 
one-quarter of a gram of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Their trial is now scheduled for March 18. 
</P>
<P>
While the proceedings have moved slowly, the wrangling over information gleaned 
during Kavanaugh's investigation has made for a fast-paced and curious 
sideshow. 
</P>
<P>
The fight for the records began after Kavanaugh told the Los Angeles Times 
earlier this month that he had spent weeks investigating the raid in an effort 
to clear the four officers. He said he worked with department approval and on 
city time, an assertion that was disputed by police spokesmen. 
</P>
<P>
Kavanaugh's statements helped stoke a verbal war between Police Chief Daryl F. 
Gates and Mayor Tom Bradley, who has called for an audit of the department. The 
officer's remarks have also furthered speculation about police misconduct 
during the raid. 
</P>
<P>
Kavanaugh had been ordered to testify Monday, but Fidler decided to use the day 
to determine whether the information from the investigation should be turned 
over to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
During the proceedings, Marr tried to recast Kavanaugh's role in the case. He 
said the officer worked not as a defense investigator but only as a Police 
Department defense representative for officers facing internal administrative 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
"And (Kavanaugh) was a defense representative for other police officers, not 
those in this case," said Marr. "I would be very surprised if Kavanaugh has 
anything that the prosecutors don't already have."

PACBELL IMPROPERLY CHARGING FOR INSIDE WIRING, TWO CONSUMER GROUPS CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pacific Bell is improperly charging San Diego consumers for service calls on 
inside-wiring problems with their telephones, two consumer advocate 
organizations said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Utility Consumers Action Network and the Center for Public Interest Law 
alleged that Pacific Bell is "ripping off" customers by violating telephone 
inside wiring deregulation rules enacted in 1987 by the Federal Communications 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
According to a UCAN survey of 650 San Diegans in June: 
</P>
<P>
* More than 50% of San Diegans do not know they own their inside phone wiring 
and must pay for its repair. 
</P>
<P>
* Nearly 60% of San Diegans would automatically call Pacific Bell, which offers 
the highest-priced repairs, for any telephone problem. 
</P>
<P>
* The elderly, minorities, renters and low-income households are the most 
likely to pay the highest-priced repair charges. 
</P>
<P>
* Pacific Bell is improperly charging a $35 fee for service calls to a 
customer's home to determine whether the inside or outside wiring is faulty. 
</P>
<P>
"At first we thought it was only that people didn't know" they own the inside 
wiring and have several options to fix it, said Michael Shames, UCAN executive 
director. "But then we found it was a combination of ignorance and a Pacific 
Bell scam." 
</P>
<P>
The California Public Utilities Commission prohibits phone companies from 
charging to identify a wiring problem, Shames said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell spokesman Tom McNaghten disputed UCAN's claims, saying Pacific 
Bell complies with all state and federal regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell responds to wiring repair calls by checking the wires at its 
maintenance center and then telling the customer there is a $35 fee for a 
service call to determine whether the problem is outside or inside the home, 
McNaghten said. 
</P>
<P>
If the inside wiring is faulty, Pacific Bell tells the customer that he or she 
may fix it, call an independent repairman, pay Pacific Bell's $65 flat repair 
fee or enroll in Pacific Bell's inside wiring maintenance plan for 50 cents a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Before the FCC ruling in 1987, only Pacific Bell could make repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever repair option they choose, they've been told that our service call is 
$35," McNaghten said. "That's required" by federal and state regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to think people prefer doing business with Pacific Bell" because of 
its quality services and guaranteed repairs, McNaghten added. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the PUC could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone inside wiring starts at a residence's connector box where the phone 
company connects its outside wires to the inside wiring. Inside wiring includes 
all wires that run inside a home, including the phone jack. 
</P>
<P>
Shames said UCAN began investigating the alleged scam when Pacific Bell charged 
UCAN offices and a board member a $35 service fee to determine whether a wiring 
problem was inside or outside. 
</P>
<P>
UCAN and the Center for Public Interest Law also announced the start of a 
consumer education drive to alert San Diegans about inside-outside telephone 
wiring and repair options.

BELEAGUERED CASINO FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small Huntington Park casino, the target of a criminal investigation, filed 
for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Act just as county 
officials moved to collect $400,000 in delinquent property taxes and penalties, 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Park Club Operations Ltd., part owner and operator of the Huntington 
Park Casino, owes its 20 largest creditors $610,382, according to the 
bankruptcy petition filed Friday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The petition did not list the back taxes owed to the county. 
</P>
<P>
The club is the subject of an investigation by sheriff's detectives into 
alleged skimming of profits and violation of the minimum-wage law. However, the 
bankruptcy filing is unlikely to have any effect on the probe. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Park Casino, which opened in 1984, accumulated the property tax debt 
over the last five years, said Deputy County Counsel Martha E. Romero. 
</P>
<P>
Romero said county officials have tried for several years to get the tax matter 
resolved. They notified casino management last week that they planned on Monday 
to begin an inventory of the casino's possessions, including gaming tables and 
cash registers, and seize them as collateral, Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
The county would have had the right to sell the casino's possessions if the tax 
bill went unpaid, but Romero said she wanted to work out a payment plan with 
casino officials.

GRAY AREA OF TESTING IS DECRIED; 
</P>
<P>
DRUG SCREENING: U.S. NEARLY WAS DISQUALIFIED AT SEOUL AFTER AUGMON CAME UP 
POSITIVE FOR TESTOSTERONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND and RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago in Seoul, Korea, the Olympics suffered through its biggest drug 
scandal when Ben Johnson of Canada lost his gold medal after testing positive 
for an anabolic steroid. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors were rife in the Olympic village that other big-time athletes also 
tested positive, but none of those rumors were verified. 
</P>
<P>
Still, word of another potential scandal quietly reached the International 
Olympic Committee's medical commission in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
It involved Stacey Augmon. 
</P>
<P>
Augmon, a guard for the U.S. basketball team, was found to have a level of 
testosterone slightly above the IOC limit, The Times has learned. A positive 
result could have disqualified the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Olympic Committee doctors convinced the commission that Augmon was not 
using drugs to improve his performance. Instead, they argued, he is a rare 
individual who naturally produces a high level of testosterone, the male sex 
hormone. 
</P>
<P>
His test result was dismissed without becoming public because only confirmed 
positives are announced. Augmon continued to play, and the U.S. won a bronze 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
Augmon's case has not died quietly, however. 
</P>
<P>
It casts lingering doubt on the validity of testing for naturally produced 
hormones and the IOC's process by which tests are implemented. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the IOC medical commission recently acknowledged that the test used 
for testosterone in the last two Olympics needs modifications so that no 
athlete will be falsely accused of chemically enhancing his or her performance. 
</P>
<P>
Testosterone and its synthetic derivatives, anabolic steroids, increase protein 
synthesis, and can increase lean muscle mass with training. 
</P>
<P>
IOC doctors said they are trying to improve the testing methods to ensure 
fairness and accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
Their problem is compounded because there is no test differentiating the body's 
testosterone from testosterone that is added. It all has the same chemical 
makeup. A screening test that can identify a forbidden anabolic steroid is 
unable to detect added testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
Three other U.S. athletes have encountered situations similar to Augmon's: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Corey Millen, now playing for the New York Rangers, served an 18-month 
suspension ordered by the International Hockey Federation after testing 
positive in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Baaron Pittinger, president of USA Hockey, said the Americans soon will appeal 
the suspension to clear Millen's name. 
</P>
<P>
"Corey has maintained this is a natural level," Pittinger said. "We intend to 
pursue the matter because we (now) believe Corey's contentions have merit." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Augie Wolf, a shotputter, and Billy Olson, a pole vaulter, successfully 
defended themselves after testing positive at the 1989 U.S. indoor national 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
Each was able to cast a reasonable doubt as to the accuracy of his test in an 
appeal before The Athletics Congress' review panels. The positive results were 
overturned. 
</P>
<P>
Manfred Donike, a professor at an institute of biochemistry in Cologne, 
Germany, developed the process that is used to determine abnormal testosterone 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a screening test, the IOC and other amateur sports organizations 
adopted a ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone, a biologically inactive 
steroid found in the testes and ovaries. 
</P>
<P>
The test derived from a compendium of Donike's articles published by the German 
Assn. of Sport Doctors. Donike wrote that a normal ratio between testosterone 
and epitestosterone was one to one. 
</P>
<P>
On Donike's recommendation, IOC officials adopted a standard of six to one. Any 
urine specimen found to have a ratio of higher than six testosterone to one 
epitestosterone was considered positive. 
</P>
<P>
What Donike and other IOC medical officials failed to realize at the time, 
however, is that some people naturally produce higher levels. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Catlin, who operates the IOC-accredited drug-testing laboratory at UCLA, 
said he has seen ratios as high as nine to one. 
</P>
<P>
Catlin, representing the U.S. Olympic Committee, defended Augmon before the IOC 
medical commission at Seoul. Catlin previously tested Augmon during U.S. 
tryouts and found a result similar to the one at Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
Catlin concluded that Augmon naturally produced a high level of testosterone, 
and took his argument before IOC officials. The medical commission agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Augmon declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Cutler, an endocrinologist with the National Institute of Health in 
Bethesda, Md., said that those who have abnormally high levels are not 
necessarily bigger or stronger. Thus, it is difficult to consider physical 
characteristics in the equation. 
</P>
<P>
"Testosterone is not the most potent element in the human body," Cutler said. 
</P>
<P>
After discovering other such cases in the last two years, Catlin said it is no 
longer possible to conclude that those above the six-to-one level have cheated. 
</P>
<P>
Recent challenges and further scientific data have prompted the IOC's 
drug-testing officials to reconsider their procedures. 
</P>
<P>
They acknowledge that there are enough variances in their test results to 
warrant further investigation before labeling a specimen positive. 
</P>
<P>
The IOC medical commission will discuss the testosterone issue when it meets in 
February at Albertville, France. 
</P>
<P>
On the agenda will be a discussion of steroid profiling as a way to further 
examine potential testosterone positives, Donike said. 
</P>
<P>
In his recently published book, "Drugs, Sport and Politics," Dr. Robert Voy 
wrote that profiling establishes an athlete's hormonal pattern on a urinalysis 
screen. The profile supposedly remains constant unless the hormonal balance is 
tampered with. 
</P>
<P>
Catlin said researchers have been studying profiling for about four years, but 
are not ready to implement the test. 
</P>
<P>
Even with profiling, IOC doctors said, they expect to retain the six-to-one 
ratio because it works for most athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the IOC believes a test is useful does not concern Voy as much as how 
the organization adopts its testing system. 
</P>
<P>
Voy, formerly the chief medical officer of the U.S. Olympic Committee, said 
that his biggest complaint is the use of testing that has not been sufficiently 
reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
"These laboratory experts are going to have to be stopped in their tracks until 
they get the necessary research to justify what they are doing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf, who works for a Northern California drug-testing company, used that 
argument in his defense against the positive testosterone tests in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf wrote in an appeal that Donike's work had never been published in a 
refereed journal of record, the accepted accreditation within the scientific 
community. 
</P>
<P>
He also presented a clinical chemistry report published by Swedish researchers 
that outlined the effects of ethanol on the ratio of testosterone to 
epitestosterone. Drinking, the researchers concluded, could slightly elevate 
testosterone levels. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they need to find a test, one that can be enforced without prejudice," 
Wolf said recently. "As it is now, the test they have is not defensible. If you 
are informed enough and do the research, you're probably going to find out you 
can take (someone else's) testosterone and still get away with it. 
</P>
<P>
"The drug testing has been neither fair nor rational. The athletes who have 
been suspended have been the unlucky, the uninformed and unprotected." 
</P>
<P>
Some say they also have been the ones from countries that do not have the 
technology to successfully defend themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Voy, although not identifying Augmon, wrote about the case in his book: " . . . 
So he got off the hook -- not because he was proven innocent or because the IOC 
test could not prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but because of two 
very important other factors: He was an American, and the American officials 
didn't want his team disqualified. You see, often it doesn't matter whether or 
not you're guilty as much as who you are and where you're from." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander de Merode, chairman of the IOC medical commission, said that 
political manipulation played no part in overturning Augmon's result. He said 
scientific data supported the conclusion that Augmon was a rare individual who 
had an abnormal ratio. 
</P>
<P>
Still, these questionable cases cast doubt on the IOC's ability to accurately 
test for natural hormones.

A MOTLEY CREW: CHARGERS PIECE TOGETHER BACKFIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PATTERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is patchwork of the finest quality. 
</P>
<P>
The Charger defensive backfield, which intercepted four passes in a 41-10 
victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Sunday, was pieced together through scans 
of the waiver wire, non-blockbuster trades and one good draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
Gill Byrd, a first-round selection from San Jose State in 1983, is the only 
member of this unit who was handpicked by the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how the rest came to San Diego: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Safety Vencie Glenn arrived in 1986 when the Chargers swapped a 1987 
fifth-round draft selection with the New England Patriots. He had started 54 
consecutive games until he missed the fourth game of this season because of a 
concussion. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cornerback Sam Seale, who Jim Mora, Charger defensive back coach, says has 
been the most consistent player in the secondary the past two seasons, was 
claimed off waivers from the Raiders in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Safety Martin Bayless was acquired from Buffalo in 1987 for cornerback 
Wayne Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Safety Lester Lyles was picked up as a Plan B free agent from the Phoenix 
Cardinals in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rookie cornerback Donald Frank, from Winston-Salem State, tried out and won 
a spot during training camp this year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cornerback Donnie Elder was acquired in the fifth week of this season after 
spending the first four weeks on the Miami Dolphins' injured-reserve list. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cornerback Anthony Shelton was claimed off waivers from the San Francisco 
49ers at the end of exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
So there you have it. The group that reaps the benefits of the Chargers' 
amazing pass rush. Or, at least, that seems to be the general perception. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a great pass rush, granted," Mora said. "But these guys deserve more 
credit than they ever get. It's always the pass rush, but hey, (the defensive 
backs) do something, too. I think they really get tired of always hearing how 
bad they are." 
</P>
<P>
Take Sunday, for instance. What will people remember? Byrd making his 29th and 
30th interceptions to become the Chargers' all-time leader or the play on which 
everyone blitzed and was then burned by a 68-yard touchdown pass from Chris 
Chandler to Mark Carrier? 
</P>
<P>
As Charger Coach Dan Henning points out, it's easy to recall when a defensive 
back gets beat for a long touchdown but harder to remember all the times when 
the play is foiled. That's why people keep asking Seale about Willie Gault, who 
had a big day in last year's opener against the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy who never seems to get talked about unless he gets beat has been 
having an outstanding season, and that's Sammy Seale," Henning said. "That's 
the nature of the business at corner. He's the only guy who hasn't missed any 
time back there this year. He's playing real solid." 
</P>
<P>
Injuries to the secondary have been frequent in recent weeks. Glenn has 
suffered from a concussion, an ankle sprain and a hamstring pull. He was forced 
to sit out for the second time this season when the Chargers played the Raiders 
Oct. 21. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an empty feeling," Glenn said. "You're used to being out there battle 
after battle after battle, and there's nothing you can do. It's terrible. It's 
the worst feeling in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Byrd has also been slowed by an assortment of injuries, including the groin 
strain that he has played with the past two games. Sunday he could be found 
lying on the bench stretching to keep loose each time the Charger offense was 
on the field. 
</P>
<P>
And Bayless missed Sunday's game with an ankle sprain. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the injuries, Shelton, Elder and Lyles have been called on to 
fill in, and they have been more than adequate. Both Lyles and Elder had 
interceptions Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"There hasn't been much drop off," Mora said. "Fortunately we have some young 
guys who are playing pretty well behind (the starters)." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the starters who are nicked and bruised don't plan to miss 
much of the action. And Mora says that has something to do with tradition. 
These guys may still be trying to live down the days when the Chargers had the 
leakiest defense in the NFL. 
</P>

"It's tough to keep those guys down," he said. "They're all so competitive and 
they hate to miss games. I think part of that is they feel like they have a lot 
to prove because, for many years around here, there have always been so many 
negative things said and written about the secondary."

Fritz Shurmur was a handy guy to have around, back in simpler times, when the 
Rams were 2-4 and everybody and his brother and sister knew the reason why. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Everett was still worth 300 yards every Sunday, wasn't he? 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland Gary had put Curt Warner in his place, on the bench, hadn't he? 
</P>
<P>
Flipper Anderson and Henry Ellard were still the long and short of pass 
receiving par excellence, weren't they? 
</P>
<P>
If only Shurmur and his defense could get their act together. 
</P>
<P>
Well, Monday night at Pittsburgh, in front of Al Michaels, Dan Dierdorf and the 
rest of the football-respecting world, the Rams lost to the Steelers, 41-10, 
and Shurmur's defense was about the best thing the Rams had going for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Shurmur didn't call for a pass on third and one on the Ram 37 and hit 
Pittsburgh cornerback David Johnson in the numbers and run the ball back to the 
Ram 17, from which the Steelers quickly broke a 7-7 tie. 
</P>
<P>
Shurmur didn't shank two field-goal attempts in the first half, when two field 
goals still could have made a difference. 
</P>
<P>
Shurmur didn't freeze during punt formation and forget to kick the ball and 
wind up buried on his own six-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
And Shurmur had absolutely nothing to do with Cleveland Gary's tryout as Laker 
point guard and those three dribble drives on the Three Rivers Stadium turf. 
</P>
<P>
Either bad defense is as contagious as flu or the Rams' problems run deeper 
than John Robinson could ever have fathomed. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night, Ram scapecoats multiplied by about 47. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a team game," Robinson said, "and tonight we were horrible as a team." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams did exactly one thing right all night -- the opening kickoff. Gaston 
Green fielded it, cut inside with it at the Ram 10 and ran the next 90 
untouched. After sixteen seconds the Rams were ahead, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
They never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in two years, the Rams failed to score an offensive 
touchdown. They had their chances -- three of their first six possessions ended 
inside the Pittsburgh 32 -- but Everett either overthrew them away, underthrew 
them away or handed the ball to Gary, who fumbled three times and somehow 
managed to lose only one. 
</P>
<P>
Gary fumbled the ball to himself, fumbled the ball to his offensive linemen, 
fumbled the ball once every five times he touched it. 
</P>
<P>
After 15 carries, Robinson wouldn't let him touch it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"That was fairly typical of what went wrong with our team," Robinson said. "I 
think several of our people played at that level. Cleveland fell into the same 
place where a lot of us were." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson began the game laughing -- Green's kickoff return was a leg slapper -- 
and spent the next 59 minutes shaking his head. "We were embarrassed," he said. 
"I can't ever remember a team making so many mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"We did it all. There was not any phase of error we didn't delve into." 
</P>
<P>
Consider the Rams' explorations during the first half. Of their six offensive 
possessions, two ended in missed field goals by Mike Lansford (from 45 and 42 
yards), another ended with an Everett interception and a fourth ended with a 
Gary fumble at the Ram 27. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, they entered halftime behind by only 17-10. 
</P>
<P>
And it was still only 20-10 when Ram punter Keith English reached new levels in 
panic. Pittsburgh's Richard Bell broke through English's protective wall a 
little too quickly and English decided to abort the mission. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than kick, English tried to run. 
</P>
<P>
And he ran right into Steeler Dwight Stone, who jumped him for an 11-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
Three plays later, Merril Hoge was in the end zone and the rout was under way. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson couldn't believe his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't punt it," he said. "Our man could have punted it. I thought he could 
have punted. He just got overly worried." 
</P>
<P>
And now, English has company. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson has a preseason Super Bowl contender with a 2-5 record. He has Warren 
Moon and the Houston Oilers next on the schedule, followed by the undefeated 
New York Giants and, a week after that, on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, the 
San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
"We are self-destructing at all phases of the game," Robinson said, "and I 
don't have any explanation for it. I can't give you one." 
</P>
<P>
These weren't the Terry Bradshaw Steelers, remember. These were the Bubby 
Brister Steelers. This wasn't the Steel Curtain defense of dynasties past. 
Before Monday, this defense had carried Pittsburgh all the way to a 3-4 record. 
</P>
<P>
Bubby Brister. Jim Harbaugh. Anthony Dilweg. 
</P>
<P>
The Quarterbacks-Who-Won't-Go-To-Canton-But-Can-Beat-The-Rams Club continues to 
grow. 
</P>
<P>
And the Rams have more than one man, many more, to blame for it.

The Rams did three hours of some sparkling slapstick comedy here Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Call it "America's Funniest Football Videos." It certainly was a major-league 
hit with the crowd of 56,466 at Three Rivers Stadium, who watched their 
Pittsburgh Steelers pummel the Rams, 41-10, in this nationally televised game. 
</P>
<P>
Two interceptions here, one lost fumble there, a blown punt over there, and 
suddenly the Rams are 2-5 and the playoffs look like a faraway dream. 
</P>
<P>
"We might be out of the playoff race and all that, but we've got to keep 
trying," defensive end Doug Reed said. "I think it's pretty much about pride 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Monday night was embarrassing and bewildering for a Ram team that thought it 
had turned the corner after beating the Atlanta Falcons last week. In 
Pittsburgh, they turned into a dead end. 
</P>
<P>
Even after Gaston Green had an easy time returning the opening kickoff 100 
yards for a touchdown and a 7-0 Ram lead 16 seconds into the game, the Rams 
seemed lifeless, and the Steelers quickly pounced on their confusion. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a terrible football game," Ram Coach John Robinson said after three 
turnovers and horrid Rams' special teams play led to 27 Steeler points. "We 
made about every error you could make in the game." 
</P>
<P>
This was the first game the Rams' offense didn't put the ball in the end zone 
since Oct. 30, 1988 -- a string of two seasons. And, until the meaningless end, 
they didn't really come close. 
</P>
<P>
Against a Steeler defense designed to swallow offensive errors, Ram quarterback 
Jim Everett threw two key interceptions, running back Cleveland Gary lost one 
of his three fumbles, and Ram receivers dropped several passes. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from those miscues, Keith English failed to get a punt off deep in Ram 
territory, and the Steelers' Rod Woodson had two kickoff returns of more than 
40 yards against the Rams' special teams. 
</P>
<P>
So time after time, the hardly-spectacular Steelers' offense was placed in easy 
striking distance. 
</P>
<P>
"We are self-destructing in all phases," Robinson said. "I don't have an 
explanation. You want to be as positive as you can, and I think we saw signs 
(in the Atlanta game). But obviously, things didn't turn out for us tonight, so 
I was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The run of Ram ridiculousness began in the first quarter, after the Steelers 
had countered Gaston Green's return with a long touchdown drive, culminating in 
quarterback Bubby Brister's six-yard pass play to Merril Hoge, who would end up 
with three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers, who entered the game with the 27th-ranked offense in the league, 
started three first-half drives in Ram territory -- on Everett's first 
interception, Gary's lost fumble and Woodson's first long kickoff return. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, who had beaten Steeler rookie cornerback David Johnson on the same 
out-route to receiver Henry Ellard three times earlier, paid the price for 
trying it one time too often. On third and one, Everett tried Ellard at the 
familiar spot, only to find Johnson slashing in front for an interception and 
34-yard return to the Rams' 17-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
One play later, Brister looped a pass up to rookie tight end Eric Green, who 
had beaten safety Vince Newsome clean down the left sideline for Green's sixth 
score of the season, making it 14-7. After Woodson's big return, the Steelers' 
Gary Anderson kicked a 42-yard field goal that made it 17-10. 
</P>
<P>
Next, after Mike Lansford's 32-yard field goal, came Gary's fumble. But the 
Rams' defense stiffened enough to push the Steelers out of field-goal range. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams could have gained a touch of momentum before halftime, but Lansford 
missed a 42-yard shot, wide left. He had previously missed a 48-yarder in the 
first quarter, also to the left. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Steelers' scoring deluge came, and the Rams were left to shiver in the 
sub-40-degree weather during the final two quarters, baffled by their inability 
to muster any kind of charge. 
</P>
<P>
Woodson returned the second-half kickoff 45 yards, setting up another Anderson 
field goal, making it 20-10. Altogether, the Steelers started five possessions 
in Ram territory. 
</P>
<P>
"After their one long drive in the first quarter, I think all their scores were 
from close in," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Three possessions after the field goal, English saw safety Gary Jones come 
clean through the Rams' punt protection. Although Robinson later said that 
English could have gotten the kick off, English said he made a "split-second" 
decision that he didn't want it blocked for a possible touchdown, and did not 
kick it. 
</P>
<P>
He was tackled at the Rams' six, and three plays later Hoge jumped in from one 
yard out and it was 24-10. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently pressing, and seemingly nudged out of rhythm by the Steelers' 
aggressive deep zone, Everett threw high toward Aaron Cox on the next 
possession, and watched as safety Thomas Everett picked off the tipped pass for 
an interception that he returned to the Rams' 39. 
</P>
<P>
Everett, apparently bothered by his performance, completed only 15 of 34 passes 
for 176 yards, plus the two interceptions. He seemed to have Flipper Anderson 
open deep at least three times but couldn't connect with him. 
</P>
<P>
"My emotions are a little bit high right now," said Everett, suggesting that he 
wanted to look at the films before fully evaluating his performance. 
</P>
<P>
After that second interception, it was all but over. The eight-yard pass from 
Brister to receiver Dwight Stone made it 34-10 early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the game -- with Gary on the bench after fumbling for a third time 
and running for only 34 yards in 15 carries -- was just one long Steelertown 
celebration, their day in the prime-time spotlight after four years away from 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"(Gary's fumbles are) fairly typical of the rest of our team," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been known as a fumbler," Gary said. "I fumbled the football, it's 
as simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, themselves, are having inordinate troubles in prime time, losing, 
38-9, on Sunday night to the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
But the big number is 2-5, and the knowledge that they are in far worse shape 
than they could have imagined at the beginning of this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We're basically just trying to salvage the season more than anything else," 
said Henry Ellard, who made seven catches for 99 yards and seemed to be the 
only Rams' player who felt comfortable Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>

The Rams deactivated backup tackle Robert Cox and newly converted receiver 
Alfred Jackson. . . . Injury report: Robert Delpino (concussion), Greg Clark

Left tackle Leo Goeas had arthroscopic knee surgery Monday to repair cartilage 
damage in his knee. Charger Coach Dan Henning said he expects Goeas to miss one 
or two games. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Patten, activated Saturday off injured reserve, will share time with Eric 
Floyd in Goeas' absence. Patten played his first game this season in Sunday's 
41-10 victory over Tampa Bay at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Other injuries: 
</P>
<P>
Tackle Broderick Thompson, who suffered a slight ankle sprain Sunday, is 
expected to be ready for Sunday's game at Seattle. Safety Martin Bayless, who 
missed Sunday's game with an ankle injury, is also expected back. 
</P>
<P>
Henning was asked if he said anything to his quarterback, Billy Joe Tolliver, 
after Tolliver was greeted by the home fans with a chorus of boos Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"No," Henning said. "We didn't expect chimes." 
</P>
<P>
General manager Bobby Beathard said Tolliver played his best game of the season 
Sunday. Tolliver completed only 11 of 24 passes for 157 yards and a touchdown, 
but four were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very tough kid," Beathard said. "He's been able to withstand the 
pressure." DON PATTERSON

USC was aided by two 15-yard penalties in its only touchdown drive against 
Arizona State Saturday in a 13-6 victory at Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, the Trojans are hurt by penalties. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans, penalized 11 times for 92 yards against Arizona State, have been 
assessed 73.8 yards a game in penalties this season, making them the most 
penalized team, in terms of yardage, in the Pacific 10 Conference. 
</P>
<P>
USC also was the most penalized team in the conference last season, when it 
absorbed 82.2 yards a game in penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Mazio Royster is listed among the Pac-10 rushing leaders after running 
for 97 yards in 26 carries against Arizona State. His average of 89.2 yards 
ranks fourth in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
A starter in USC's last four games, Royster was not listed previously because 
he hadn't played in 75% of USC's games. JERRY CROWE

John Vanbiesbrouck stopped 22 shots for the ninth shutout of his career as the 
New York Rangers set a team record by winning their seventh home game without a 
defeat this season, beating the Quebec Nordiques, 5-0, on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers won their fifth game in a row and 10th in 11 games since opening 
the season 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers' 7-0-0 start at Madison Square Garden is the best in their 65 NHL 
seasons. The seven-game home winning streak is their longest since 1983-84. 
Their previous best home start, 6-0-0, also came in 1983-84. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers, with an NHL-best record of 10-3-0, handed the Nordiques their 
fourth loss in a row and beat Quebec for the seventh consecutive time in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
Vanbiesbrouck recorded his second shutout of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Sheppard and Mark Janssens scored for the Rangers in the first period.

UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said his team didn't suffer any serious injuries in 
Saturday's 26-17 victory over Oregon State at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
However, center Lance Zeno, defensive end Mike Chalenski and outside linebacker 
Arnold Ale have lingering injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Zeno has torn tendons in his left foot and played only a couple of series 
against Oregon State. Chalenski has a shoulder injury that has bothered him all 
season, and Ale didn't play because of an ankle injury and tendinitis in his 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
"Lance is like a car with a flat tire," Donahue said. "He can't push off. I 
think his role the rest of the season will be as a spot player." 
</P>
<P>
Zeno wears a specially constructed shoe to immobilize his foot. 
</P>
<P>
With Zeno unable to play regularly, walk-on Aron Gideon has become the starting 
center. The No. 2 center, John Zilinskas, is inactive with an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue said that Gideon has done a creditable job and might be in line for a 
scholarship. MAL FLORENCE

of the Reds for not paying for his flight from Oakland to Cincinnati has taken 
her joy out of the team's World Series victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It has ruined it all for me," she said. "I just don't believe we have this 
after winning a World Series. I can't believe we'd ruin something as great as a 
World Series win with a silly . . . plane flight." 
</P>
<P>
Davis told reporters he is upset that the Reds did not pay the $15,000 bill to 
bring him back to Cincinnati from Oakland, where he was hospitalized during the 
final game of the World Series.

AS OPENER APPROACHES, LAKERS GET DUNLEAVY'S DAILY DOUBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lakers' exhibition season is over, the real one starts Saturday at San 
Antonio, so what can they do till then? 
</P>
<P>
How about some nice two-a-days? 
</P>
<P>
New Coach Mike Dunleavy says they will practice twice Wednesday and perhaps 
today, too. Among other reasons, he has more of his system to install. 
</P>
<P>
"We got behind, there's no question about that," Dunleavy said Monday. "But I 
think we have time to make it up. 
</P>
<P>
"I just thought we would be further along, that by this week I'd have things in 
and then we'd pound 'em and pound 'em. We went basic, instead. We got exposed a 
little against Golden State (a 146-116 blowout loss in San Diego, before 
sweeping the New Jersey Nets in Calgary and Edmonton). There are some counters 
we could have used. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of changes and some of them, I guess, are going to be slow in 
coming. But overall, we played fairly well in the exhibition season. Basically, 
we were 6-2 and we haven't shot the ball yet (43% as opposed to last season's 
49)." 
</P>
<P>
Vlade Divac, thought to be in slight danger of losing his new starting job, 
scored 13 points with 10 rebounds Saturday against the Nets. That followed a 
talk with Dunleavy, who told him he wanted Divac to be more aggressive and more 
offensive minded. Dunleavy drove home the point by pounding the ball in to 
Divac in the exhibition to get him going. Divac responded with a big first 
quarter against Chris Dudley.

CHRYSLER POSTS LOSS; MORE GM PLANTS MAY SHUT; 
</P>
<P>
AUTOS: THE NO. 3 CAR MAKER ENDED THE QUARTER WITH $214 MILLION IN RED INK. 
ANALYSTS SAY GM COULD WRITE OFF $1 BILLION TO CLOSE 11 FACILITIES, INCLUDING 
VAN NUYS, AT LEAST TEMPORARILY.

DETROIT 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stepping up a drumbeat of sobering economic news from the automobile industry, 
Chrysler Corp. reported a $214-million quarterly loss Monday while General 
Motors Corp. laid plans for broad-based plant closings affecting tens of 
thousands of workers. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler's heavy loss was actually smaller than expected, but the red ink 
underscored the auto maker's vulnerability to the current economic climate and 
to sales pressure from both Japanese and U.S.-based competitors. 
</P>
<P>
The Chrysler loss, though, could seem small by comparison to GM's third-quarter 
bottom line if the biggest U.S. auto maker takes the huge writeoff against 
earnings Wednesday that some analysts are expecting. 
</P>
<P>
The auto giant summoned analysts to a New York meeting to hear what a spokesman 
called "significant" news shortly before it is to report its three-month 
financial results. 
</P>
<P>
GM wouldn't elaborate, but some analysts believe that it will set aside up to 
$1 billion to cover the costs of permanently closing four assembly plants. The 
plants -- in Michigan, Missouri, Massachusetts and Georgia -- have been 
"temporarily" closed for many months. They previously employed about 10,000 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe they will finally acknowledge reality," said Anne Knight, analyst at 
Paine Webber. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, trade publications reported that GM has boosted to 11 the number of 
car and truck assembly plants it will close in November and December for up to 
a month because of poor sales. Some 35,000 workers will be temporarily laid 
off. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the temporary closings, GM's plant in Van Nuys is to shut down for 
two weeks starting Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
The cutbacks mean GM will build about 154,000 fewer vehicles than planned in 
the quarter, a drop of 15%. 
</P>
<P>
The downbeat reports from Detroit are only partly due to the recent negative 
economic developments in the wake of the Persian Gulf crisis. Overall car sales 
have been slumping for nearly two years, and the domestic auto makers have been 
getting a shrinking share of those sales. 
</P>
<P>
But the downturn in consumer confidence and leap in the price of gasoline have 
delayed an expected sales recovery and cut directly into sales of trucks. This 
has worsened a major overcapacity problem at GM, whose decade-long loss in 
market share has left it with too many plants. 
</P>
<P>
And the truck falloff has been especially damaging to Chrysler's all-important 
Jeep and minivan sales. 
</P>
<P>
Though overall U.S. car sales have held up better than expected since the Aug. 
2 invasion of Kuwait, Chrysler sold 21% fewer vehicles in the July-September 
period than a year earlier. Revenue tumbled 15% to $6.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler blamed its woes partly on the high cost of rebates -- upward of $1,200 
per vehicle -- and on the production loss of some 56,000 minivans during 
factory changes to build 1991 models. Such production hiccups during new-model 
changeover normally make the third quarter the worst for auto firms. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't anticipate the Gulf crisis, the federal budget fiasco or the 
continued escalation in the incentive wars," said Chairman Lee A. Iacocca. 
</P>
<P>
However, Chrysler's earnings were some 25% higher than forecast by analysts at 
Shearson Lehman Bros., Barclays de Zoete Wedd and other investment houses. The 
company's finance subsidiary reported record earnings, though that performance 
was overwhelmed by Chrysler's sagging car and truck sales. Chrysler has lost 
nearly 2 percentage points of market share in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler issued the bleak earnings report in the midst of its contract 
negotiations with the United Auto Workers. The union said Monday that it would 
continue bargaining at least until Thursday's scheduled meeting of a worker 
council. The auto company says it can't afford to match the contract terms the 
UAW recently obtained from GM and Ford Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
David Healy, an analyst at Barclays, expects GM's third-quarter earnings to 
drop to $377 million from the year-earlier $517 million, not counting any 
writeoffs due to plant closings. Analyst Knight thinks the writeoff will be in 
the $1-billion range, putting GM deeply into the red. 
</P>
<P>
The four plants expected to be formally shut down have, until now, been 
categorized as "temporarily" closed because of language in GM's old union 
contract that ostensibly prohibited plant closings. Most GM observers believe 
that the company wants to close additional plants as well, and it is unclear 
whether the UAW-GM contract signed in September has any meaningful obstacles to 
more shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
High on the list of vulnerable plants is the Van Nuys assembly plant, which is 
to lose the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird to a Canadian plant in 1992 
and hasn't been assigned anything else to build. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GM Plant Closures 
</P>
<P>
General Motors will temporarily shut down 11 car and truck plants for one to 
four weeks beginning Nov. 5. The Flint, Mich., truck plant closed Monday for 
four weeks and will eliminate a shift indefinitely on Jan. 2 About 37,000 
workers will be affected at the 12 factories. GM is expected to announce 
Wednesday that four other plants, mothballed for several months, are being 
permanently closed. Those plants employed 10,000 workers.

UNOCAL TO BOOST OIL DRILLING; FIRM CITES HIGHER REVENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unocal Corp., citing higher crude oil revenue as a result of the Middle East 
crisis, said Monday that it would speed up plans for drilling in North America, 
joining a handful of other companies that have boosted oil spending since the 
Iraqi invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Unocal said it would increase its 1990 North American development drilling 
budget by 12%, or $33 million, to drill 93 new development oil wells in the 
United States and Canada that were originally scheduled to be drilled in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
With the announcement, Los Angeles-based Unocal joins companies such as Conoco 
Inc. and Chevron Corp., who earlier announced plans to speed up some drilling 
to take advantage of a windfall resulting from higher oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts said the projects do not signal a widespread increase in U.S. oil 
drilling activity as a result of the Middle East crisis. That's mainly because 
most oil executives are reluctant to change long-term spending plans based on 
what is perceived as a momentary run-up of crude prices. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the anticipation of prices that focuses exploration (planning)," said 
Robert Megill, a petroleum economist and former Exxon Corp. executive in 
Houston. That means "prices five years down the road," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most industry executives expect crude oil prices to fall from their current 
high levels once the crisis is resolved, removing the long-term financial 
incentive for dramatic increases in U.S. drilling. 
</P>
<P>
Unocal's stepped-up drilling plans "reflect the use of additional cash that's 
coming into the upstream (exploration and development) part of the company 
because of higher oil prices," said John F. Imle Jr., a Unocal senior vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, these are projects that were planned all along based on oil 
price projections made before the Middle East crisis began. They are not 
marginal projects that suddenly appear more attractive simply because prices 
have jumped for now. 
</P>
<P>
The 93 new wells, including 20 in California, are expected to increase the 
company's net production of oil and liquids by 5,700 barrels a day by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Unocal Corp. reported that third-quarter earnings had risen 53% to 
$121 million from $79 million in the like period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies that have recently stepped up drilling include: 
</P>
<P>
* Chevron, which in August said it would spend an additional $100 million in 
1990 on domestic oil and natural gas production, an increase of about 10% over 
its total U.S. exploration and production budget. The money would be used to 
drill about 130 development wells in major existing oil fields in California, 
Colorado, Texas and the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
* Conoco Inc., which said it would increase its 1990 exploration and production 
budget by $10 million, to $540 million, to drill five new exploration wells in 
the Gulf of Mexico that had been originally scheduled in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
* British Petroleum and Atlantic Richfield Co., which, since the Middle East 
crisis began, have stepped up a program of well stimulation on Alaska's North 
Slope, helping to boost production. Separately, they announced plans to spend 
$1.1 billion on a long-term gas handling project designed to arrest the decline 
of Alaskan oil production. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, there are signs that oil drillers have increased their activity 
since Iraq invaded Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the number of active oil and natural gas rigs increased to 1,107 
from 1,010 a year ago, according to the widely consulted rig count report 
released Monday by oil services company Baker Hughes Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The rig count, which is a measure of the number of rigs exploring for oil, has 
risen in eight of the last 10 weeks and is at its highest level in about 2 1/2 
years, said Baker Hughes spokesman Ron Turner in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the oil industry had planned to increase upstream spending in 1990 
independent of the Middle East crisis, expecting oil prices to rise gradually 
on their own. But there remain real impediments to dramatic increases in 
domestic oil drilling, and most oil companies have been shifting their efforts 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The oil industry argues that the likeliest sources of large, new oil 
discoveries in the United States are off limits, including offshore areas and 
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the number of available drilling rigs and rig crews has dropped 
dramatically since the oil boom of the early 1980s. In December, 1981, the rig 
count peaked at 4,500. After oil prices crashed in the summer of 1986, the rig 
count plummeted to 663.

CALIFORNIA &amp; CO.: THE REASONS WE SPEND AS MUCH AS WE DO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY ANDERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What a place. We spent $5.3 billion on furniture and home furnishings in 
California in 1987. That was more than five times what we spent at bakeries, 
more than four times what we spent at hardware stores and more than twice what 
we spent at liquor stores. 
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by Sales &amp; Marketing Management magazine, the Los 
Angeles-Long Beach metropolitan area is the richest market in the nation, as 
measured by "effective buying income." That's an estimate of the amount of 
money people have left over from their paychecks after paying taxes and other 
recurring expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles area will have an estimated $135.2 billion of such income this 
year, the magazine says. Compare that to New York, the closest competitor, at 
$132.1 billion and Chicago at $93.4 billion. Anaheim/Santa Ana will have $39.2 
billion, San Diego $38.3 billion and San Francisco $32.6 billion, which ranks 
them all much higher than places such as Pittsburgh, Phoenix and Denver. 
</P>
<P>
We've got a lot of money to spend here, and we seem to spend it on everything. 
That's why the Golden State has been considered a retailer's paradise compared 
to other parts of the country. If one retailer stumbles, another is waiting in 
line to get in. Nordstrom's came in. And Mervyn's. And soon, Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
The accepted wisdom about the California market is that it's easier to get rich 
here and harder to fail. That, of course, is greatly oversimplified and not 
always accurate. But as a general rule, over time, it still applies. 
</P>
<P>
There are a lot of reasons for this, but perhaps the most basic has to do with 
our households, which are the underpinning of any economy as well as society in 
general. The size, number and composition of households determines much of what 
happens in a particular place. 
</P>
<P>
In California, not surprisingly, we have more households than any other state 
-- more than 10.5 million as of last January. They also tend to have slightly 
fewer people in them than the typical American household -- about 3.55 per 
household versus about 3.7 nationally. We also have more single-person 
households proportionally, and the members of California households are 
typically younger than the national average. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles ranks No. 1 in households with "effective buying income" above 
$50,000 in the Sales &amp; Marketing Management survey. That's also a key to a 
dynamic retail economy. The magazine estimated that nearly 872,000 households 
in the Los Angeles/Long Beach area had household buying power at that level or 
higher. By comparison, New York had 733,300; Washington had 575,000. 
</P>
<P>
What that means is that, at least in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, our 
households have workers with unusually high incomes. Sometimes it takes two or 
three wage earners to reach that average buying income, but we seem to have 
them. 
</P>
<P>
And because our households frequently have several income producers at 
relatively high levels, each may be a fairly big spender in his or her own 
right. Each may acquire expensive clothes, cars, furniture and so on. There 
seems to be less emphasis on communal, or family, spending goals in California 
households, once a home is acquired. Each wage earner often saves for a 
personal goal. 
</P>
<P>
We also lead the nation in what have been dubbed "economic households" -- 
unrelated people who live together for economic reasons only. To afford the 
rent, for instance, or to be able to buy a house. These households also 
frequently have high income levels and very divergent economic goals beyond 
owning a home or renting a better apartment. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, most California households don't have money to burn. In fact, even 
though we may have more wealthy households than any place else, the average 
household income in 1988 was just $18,763. But even that figure is up 
substantially from the $11,603 recorded in 1980, and both figures are well 
above the national averages. So even a "typical" California household is still 
better off financially than the "typical" American household. 
</P>
<P>
Although Californians often complain about our high cost of living, some costs 
here are actually lower than the national average. Heating a home, for 
instance, is much cheaper than in colder climates. Our cars last three to four 
years longer than the national average, thanks to the milder climate and lack 
of snow and salt on the roads. 
</P>
<P>
Blend all this and you get some understanding of why Californians have a 
reputation for free-spending ways. Sure, we spend more for housing and 
transportation. But we have more income than average Americans, and the people 
we share our "space" with -- whether family or not -- also have more income. 
Our mild climate holds down at least some basic costs of living. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's why we all head for the mall.

HUGHES UNIT EXPECTED TO STAY IN TORRANCE

Hughes Aircraft is expected to announce today that it will not relocate its 
Torrance-based Electron Dynamics Division and the unit's 1,200 jobs, an option 
that has been under consideration during a 10-month study about whether to 
remain in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The company has considered moving the division, which produces electronic 
components for radars and satellites, to locations in New Mexico, Colorado or 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
If Hughes announces that it will not move the operation, it could send an 
important signal that Southern California does not stand to lose every time a 
company considers moving out of the area. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes said Monday it would disclose the results of its study today at a news 
conference at the Torrance City Hall. The use of city facilities was one strong 
indication, sources said, that the decision has been made not to leave the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Mayor Katie Geissert said she was not privy to Hughes decision, but 
said the city had attempted to entice Hughes to remain in Torrance during 
meetings in recent months. "They are major contributors to our economy," 
Geissert said. 
</P>
<P>
The Hughes division operates five facilities along Lomita Boulevard in 
Torrance, where it produces traveling wave tubes, among other products. The 
tubes, which are technically difficult to make, are a key component in 
high-power transmitters used in radars and communications satellites. 
</P>
<P>
A Hughes executive said one problem with the Torrance facilities is the high 
cost of rent at the leased facilities. He added that the consideration of sites 
in other states was not unusual; during a relocation study, it is normal to 
examine the best alternatives to staying. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, another Hughes official said that the company was being "cautious" 
in its study and that the softening housing market in Southern California held 
out some hope of making homes more affordable for employees. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes has expanded and relocated outside of California in the cases of more 
than a half dozen plants, while its California employment has dropped 
precipitously over the past several years.

Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. to Reorganize: The nation's biggest securities firm 
announced a sweeping management overhaul that could lead to several hundred job 
cuts. The reorganization replaces Merrill's separate consumer and capital 
markets groups with six business divisions, eliminating a structure in place 
since 1984. It also creates a mechanism for the replacement of Chairman and 
Chief Executive William A. Schreyer, who will retire in 1993 at 65.

New Clean Air Act Cost Study: The new federal law will cost the average 
American household far less than industry has alleged, according to the 
National Clean Air Coalition, which lobbied for the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition estimates the cost at $8.40 per household per month by 1995. A 
study cited by the Bush Administration had estimated it at roughly $20 a month 
by 2005. Richard Ayres, coalition chairman, said this would hardly deliver the 
devastating blow to the U.S. economy that industry had predicted. He compared 
that $8.40 monthly figure with estimates that the average U.S. household this 
year will spend $29 a month for movies and $51 for alcohol.

PEOPLE: PEPSICO TO REORGANIZE ITS GLOBAL RESTAURANT BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a realignment of its international restaurant business, Pepsico Inc. will 
consolidate domestic and international operations at both Pizza Hut and Taco 
Bell. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the realignment, Steve Reinemund, president and chief executive of 
Pizza Hut's U.S. operations, was named president and CEO of the new Pizza Hut 
Worldwide division. 
</P>
<P>
John Martin, president and chief executive of Taco Bell's domestic operations, 
was named president and CEO of the new Taco Bell Worldwide division. 
</P>
<P>
International operations for the two concepts were previously managed by 
Pepsico Food Service International (PFSI), which will now concentrate fully on 
its food-service distribution business. Graham Butler, president of PFSI, was 
named to the new position of chief executive of Pepsico Food Systems Worldwide 
Distribution, an expanded operation that will serve as the distribution arm for 
Pepsico's global restaurant businesses, including Kentucky Fried Chicken. 
Kentucky Fried Chicken already encompasses both domestic and international 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Pizza Hut currently has 1,400 restaurants in 62 countries outside the United 
States, while Taco Bell is represented in eight countries outside the United 
States with 59 units. With nearly 19,000 units around the globe, Pepsico is one 
of the world's largest restaurant operator. In 1989, sales from its restaurant 
sector grew 20% to $5.3 billion.

WORKERS' EDUCATION NOT ADEQUATE, EMPLOYERS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
About two-thirds of the largest employers in the Los Angeles area said in a 
survey released Monday that they are unsatisfied with the competency and 
educational training of entry-level workers. 
</P>
<P>
The results of the Los Angeles area survey resembled those of a nationwide poll 
conducted earlier this year and highlight the need for education reform and 
programs for the 70% of young people who do not earn college degrees, said the 
National Alliance of Business, a nonprofit group that commissioned the surveys. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives you a sense of how serious the problem is," said William Kolberg, 
president of the NAB, which is holding its annual convention in Los Angeles and 
which plans to conduct other regional work force surveys. 
</P>
<P>
Based on interviews with 257 executives in Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura, 
Riverside and San Bernardino counties, the survey found that 63% were 
unsatisfied with the overall competency of entry-level employees; 65% were 
unsatisfied with workers' educational training and 48% were unsatisfied with 
the ability of workers to be retrained. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 50% of the executives said they must interview more people to find a 
qualified candidate than they did five years ago. Most of those surveyed also 
agreed that math and reading skills of entry-level workers have deteriorated in 
the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have such a small number are that are very pleased . . . that clearly 
demonstrates the depth of the problem," said John Fairbank of Fairbank, Bregman 
&amp; Maullin, a Santa Monica-based research firm. 
</P>
<P>
In response to a question unique to the Los Angeles survey, a large portion -- 
46% -- were unsatisfied with the English language skills of entry level 
employees. But the dissatisfaction with English-language skills "wasn't as 
dramatic a problem as the educational levels," Fairbank said.

DOW FALLS 5.94 DESPITE UPBEAT BUDGET NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stocks fell Monday as concern over the Persian Gulf crisis and weaker bond 
prices outweighed optimism over the budget package and expected lower interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
The battered banking group once again suffered some of the day's most notable 
losses, even as the Federal Reserve apparently eased credit slightly. 
</P>
<P>
Blue chips slid for the third session in a row, with the Dow Jones industrial 
index closing down 5.94 points at 2,430.20. The 30-share index has fallen 74.01 
points since last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The broad market also took a hit, with declining issues outnumbering advances 
by more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. There were 486 issues up, 
1,037 down and 451 unchanged. Big Board volume was 133.98 million shares, up 
from Friday's 130.19 million. 
</P>
<P>
The $500-billion deficit-reduction package, finally approved by Congress after 
five months of wrangling, was positive, but "everyone expected it, so it was a 
non-event," said Jeffrey Kaminsky, Mabon Nugent's director of institutional 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
The market took numerous turns throughout the day, with the Dow up more than 20 
points and down more than 20 points at various times. The seesawing suggests 
investors have no conviction, and that patience overall is wearing thin, some 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* It was just another bloody day for financial stocks of all kinds as investors 
again showed that they see serious problems ahead for the banking system. The 
pessimism was undaunted even as the Federal Reserve poured money into the 
system, letting interest rates fall. 
</P>
<P>
The Standard &amp; Poor's financial stock index plunged 2.7% for the day. Wells 
Fargo led the banks lower, falling 2 3/4 to 45 1/8. Security Pacific dropped 
7/8 to 17 3/4, a new 52-week low. First Interstate lost 1 to 17 1/8, also a new 
52-week low. 
</P>
<P>
Other losers included Mellon Bank, off 7/8 to 18 1/8, Banc One, down 1 1/4 to 
19 1/4 and Bank of New York, down 1 5/8 to 14 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
* Among the S&amp;Ls, CalFed plunged 7/8 to 3, a loss of 23%. Ahmanson fell 1/2 
to 11 1/2 and Glenfed dropped 5/8 to 6 1/8. Home builders also were weak, 
including J. M. Peters, off 5/8 to 1 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Brokerages and insurers tumbled with the banks. CNA Financial dropped 2 7/8 
to 50 3/8, Aetna lost 1 to 30, Merrill Lynch fell 7/8 to 16 3/4 and Paine 
Webber slumped 1/2 to 11 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Media and entertainment stocks were particularly weak. Disney lost 2 1/8 to 
90 7/8, Time Warner fell 2 5/8 to 69 1/4, Times Mirror dropped 1 1/4 to 21 3/4 
and Knight Ridder fell 5/8 to 37. Viacom class B lost 1 3/8 to 14 3/8 after the 
company said its quarterly profit did not indicate a long-term turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
Playboy class A lost 1 1/8 to 3 1/4 on word that a major investor was 
liquidating his position. 
</P>
<P>
* Profit taking was heavy in health-care stocks. Lilly fell 1 7/8 to 71 1/8, 
Abbott dropped 1 5/8 to 41 1/4, Humana lost 1 1/4 to 42 1/4, and Amgen gave up 
1 1/8 to 44 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo stocks closed higher, with buying of cash indexes by futures arbitragers 
accounting for the bulk of the day's gains. The key 225-share Nikkei index rose 
323.67 points, or 1.3%, to 25,329.31. 
</P>
<P>
German share prices dived at the opening on Gulf fears and reports of weak 
earnings at Volkswagen and Deutsche Bank. But they drifted higher on 
bargain-hunting later. The 30-share DAX index ended 2.56 points lower at 
1,454.49. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks finished mixed after light trading in London. The Financial Times-Stock 
Exchange 100-share index lost 1 point to 2,062.1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT 
</P>
<P>
Fear of Bond Glut Offsets Fed Easing 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell sharply as traders shrugged off an apparent easing of credit 
by the Federal Reserve and focused on what they feared would be an oversupply 
of Treasury issues. 
</P>
<P>
The price of the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond tumbled 5/8 point, or about 
$6.25 per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield surged to 8.83% from 8.77% late 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market was anticipating a Fed move on rates after the weekend 
passage of the federal budget package. The Fed had made an easing of credit 
contingent on the measure's passage. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed move was apparent in a fall in the federal funds rate -- the rate banks 
charge each other for overnight loans -- to 7.75% from about 8% Friday. The Fed 
directly influences that rate as it pumps money into the system or drains it. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts said the Fed action was such an anticlimax that it failed to move 
the market. Scott Winningham, a bond analyst with Stone &amp; McCarthy 
Research, said the market was more concerned about supply. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury will announce later this week how many bonds it will be selling in 
its quarterly refunding auction, scheduled for next week. The government's 
borrowing needs are expected to be near record levels. If too many bonds are 
available, their prices will have to drop to attract buyers, and interest rates 
will jump. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Ends Mostly Higher in Dull Day 
</P>
<P>
The dollar settled mostly higher on world currency markets, but traders said 
dealings were dull. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said that, despite the advance, the dollar remained within its current 
trading range. With no fresh news to direct trading, "there was no reason to 
sell and no reason to buy," said Robert Ryan, a trader at Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar closed at 1.522 German marks, up from Friday's 1.513. 
It rose to 128.65 Japanese yen from 128.25 Friday. The British pound fell to 
$1.949 from Friday's $1.956. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Oil Prices Rise as Peace Hopes Fade 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices shot up more than $1 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange 
as traders expressed concern over the apparent failure of Soviet diplomatic 
efforts in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the benchmark West Texas crude for 
December delivery ended the day up $1.67 over Friday at $34.68 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, hog and pork belly futures plunged their daily 
limits, copper retreated and grains and soybeans were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold futures ended $2.10 to $2.80 higher, 
with October at $373.70 an ounce. October silver jumped 7.7 cents to $4.13 an 
ounce.

Motherhood, it seems, is not necessarily just for the young. Thanks to medical 
progress, the young-at-heart now qualify, too. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Barbara Strong who, at 42, gave birth this year to a daughter, years 
after physicians told her she would never have children because of ovary damage 
from drug treatment for breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent weekday morning, Strong, a psychiatrist, played with Christina, 8 
months old, and Juliana, 1, the daughter she adopted with husband Robert 
Wilson. In a few hours, she'll dash off to care for patients. 
</P>
<P>
Life is busy and fulfilling, Strong says. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think at 40 you're over the hill," she says with a laugh, hauling 
Juliana upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
Strong became pregnant in June, 1989, after doctors implanted an embryo 
conceived in a test tube from her husband's sperm and an egg from a donor, a 
young woman who lives near Strong in El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
Although Strong's ovaries were not adequately producing eggs, she and other 
menopausal women are able to bear children successfully if they receive an 
embryo from donor eggs and hormone injections in the first three months of 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
The results of one study on seven women, including Strong, were published in 
last week's New England Journal of Medicine. Of the seven women, ages 40 to 44, 
four gave birth to healthy babies. 
</P>
<P>
The use of donor eggs for in vitro fertilization is not new. But what has 
evoked widespread fascination is the discovery that some women who are 
technically menopausal can still carry a child. Some researchers now refuse to 
put an age limit on motherhood. 
</P>
<P>
But the brave-new-world science raises at least one practical question that 
can't be answered until long after baby leaves the nursery: How will pregnancy 
and raising babies play in middle age? While some argue that older parents have 
numerous advantages over younger ones, others contend that although the spirit 
may be willing, the body just may be not be able to cope with the rigors of 
child-rearing. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts point out a downside to middle-aged motherhood: The medical risks 
to both mothers and babies increase substantially when the parents are over 40. 
And some sociologists say children of older parents sense a difference in their 
upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
But according to 40-ish mothers like Strong, babies born as the biological 
clock is ticking are wholeheartedly -- sometimes desperately -- wanted. The 
parents are often financially stable, secure in their careers and calm in their 
management of children. 
</P>
<P>
Strong and Wilson always wanted to have children, Strong says, but postponed 
starting a family to pursue careers after their marriage in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
They decided about seven years ago to start a family, when Strong was 36 and 
Wilson was 37. But the long-anticipated plunge into parenthood was sidetracked 
by several traumatic events. 
</P>
<P>
Strong miscarried her first pregnancy. She became pregnant a second time, but 
just a few weeks before the child was due, she delivered a stillborn baby. The 
couple was determined to try again when Strong discovered she had breast 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The cancer was successfully treated, but the chemotherapy Strong received 
damaged the function of her ovaries -- the organs that produce eggs. Her 
physicians advised her to forget about having children. 
</P>
<P>
"I still had a little bit of function of my ovaries. But the doctors thought 
that women at 38 are too old to have children," Strong says. "But I didn't give 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Strong frequently reads medical journals, and one day she saw a brief article 
by USC physician Mark Sauer on the use of donor eggs and embryo transfer for 
women over age 40. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the couple was considering finding a surrogate, who would be 
artificially inseminated with Wilson's sperm, to carry a child. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to have a baby so badly," Strong says. "We were thinking about using 
a surrogate, but I thought if I could experience pregnancy and childbirth, I 
didn't want to give that experience to another woman." 
</P>
<P>
Strong knew the medical risks of having a child increase after age 40, but they 
are not considered extreme. Infant mortality increases to 12 deaths per 100,000 
live births when women reach age 40, compared to 9 per 100,000 at age 30. 
Maternal mortality rates are also higher at 40 (80 per 100,000 live births at 
40 versus 20 per 100,000 at age 30). 
</P>
<P>
Older women are at greater risk for complications during pregnancy, such as 
hypertension and diabetes, and often require delivery by Cesarean section. 
</P>
<P>
The risk of genetic defects is also much higher among older women when the 
woman's own egg is used. The risk of Down's syndrome, for instance, is 1 in 30 
at age 45 compared to 1 in 952 at age 30. 
</P>
<P>
However, when the egg is donated by a younger woman, scientists don't know if 
the rate of genetic defects will resemble that of the younger donor or that of 
birth mother. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that an older woman is going to have a higher risk for 
her and the baby," says Dr. Geoffrey Sher, executive director of the Pacific 
Fertility Centers, which has offices in several West-Coast cities. "There is a 
higher rate of prematurity, bleeding, high blood pressure and of having a 
C-section." 
</P>
<P>
Because the success rate for in vitro fertilization is much lower for women 
over 40, many infertility programs will not accept these women as patients, 
Sher says. Sher, who has researched several new techniques for evaluating the 
chances of an older woman becoming pregnant, believes that practice is 
discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
"Should older women get pregnant? Whose choice is it? If a woman is over 40 and 
wants to have a baby, do you and I have a right to deny her that? We don't have 
that moral or ethical right," he says. 
</P>
<P>
In hopes of carrying a baby, Strong contacted a Southern California fertility 
clinic that performed the procedure but required the couple to find their own 
egg donor. Strong placed an advertisement in a newspaper, found a donor and 
received an embryo transfer early in 1989. But the transfer failed. 
</P>
<P>
Strong and Wilson adopted Juliana but later contacted Sauer, who had donors 
available and made her part of his study. Strong got pregnant with the first 
embryo transfer. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wasn't counting on it working, so I was surprised when I got 
pregnant," Strong says. "I guess all you need is one good egg." 
</P>
<P>
What one needs for 18 years (at least) of intensive parenthood is more complex. 
But Strong dismisses the idea that younger people have an edge on parenting. 
</P>
<P>
"I think when you get a little older, you are more relaxed and you have more 
financial stability," Strong says. "I think maybe your family means more to you 
at that point." 
</P>
<P>
Strong says she and her husband thought about the potential for becoming ill or 
disabled later in life when they are trying to raise teen-agers. But, Strong 
says, "Life expectancy is 77 or so now. You still have a long productive life 
in front of you. And illness can happen to a younger woman as well." 
</P>
<P>
Other women are equally confident of meeting the challenges of motherhood at 
mid-life. Susan (a pseudonym) is four months pregnant. In her 40s, she thinks 
her age gives her an advantage at parenting -- even if it puts her at a 
disadvantage for getting pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
She too is carrying a child conceived from a donor egg and her husband's sperm 
and was part of Sauer's study. No one but her doctors and husband knows the 
genetic makeup of the child she will bear in five months. 
</P>
<P>
"We got married a bit later in life," she says. "We both wanted to have 
children. We have established careers. We're educated, professionals. We really 
want to be parents." 
</P>
<P>
Susan admits that rising for 2 a.m. feedings might be more difficult than it 
would have been back in the days when she didn't arrive home from a party until 
that hour. 
</P>
<P>
"I may not have quite the energy I had when I was 20, but I'm sure we're going 
to find a way to cope with that," she says. 
</P>
<P>
And there is precedent for older parenthood. Men have been fathering children 
into old age since Adam. And women are having babies, naturally, at older ages. 
According to one Census Bureau finding, the number of women 35 and older giving 
birth for the first time has quadrupled in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
"I know quite a few people in their later 30s who are having babies," Susan 
says. "I don't feel like I'm alone. I really don't know many people in their 
20s anymore who are having babies." 
</P>
<P>
Carol Pulitzer, a Mill Valley woman who underwent conventional in vitro 
fertilization (her egg and her husband's sperm) is typical of a growing number 
of women who are ready for motherhood at a time when their bodies aren't. The 
urge to have a baby didn't hit Pulitzer until age 35. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not crazy to have a child. Then I hit this age where I said, 'Hey, wait 
a minute,' " says Pulitzer, 44. "I started trying and figured I would get 
pregnant right away. I was so surprised that I couldn't get pregnant right 
away. It got to be something that I had to conquer." 
</P>
<P>
She succeeded on her third attempt at in vitro fertilization and now has a 
19-month-old son. While Pulitzer thinks she is better equipped for parenthood 
now, she worries that her son might have preferred a younger mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a father who was very old. I grew up very worried that my father was 
going to die on me. I think it's something we'll have to deal with. We'd have 
other problems if we'd had (a child) when I was 20." 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles sociologist Monica Morris, one of the few researchers who has 
studied "older" parenthood, has a far less rosy view of what is to come for 
change-of-life babies. 
</P>
<P>
The author of the 1988 book "Last-Chance Children: Growing Up With Older 
Parents," Morris' study of 22 adults raised by parents older than the norm 
found that many wished their parents had been younger. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that children know there is a difference," says Morris, a 
sociologist at Cal State L.A. "OK, so women can have babies at 39, 40, God help 
us, 50. People are still not asking, 'What will this mean to children? What 
will it mean to have a parent who is as old as your friends' grandparents?' " 
</P>
<P>
About half the respondents in Morris' survey were largely unaffected by having 
older parents. But the other half, she says "really loathed their position." 
</P>
<P>
Morris says that while older parents are better off financially, she says it is 
a myth to think that people in their 40s and 50s are as physically fit for 
parenthood as younger people. 
</P>
<P>
"People will say, 'Well, things are different now. Now we're going to live 
longer and be healthy.' It isn't like that. Fifty isn't 20. You can have a face 
lift if you want, but the body parts are older. You get more tired." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Morris does not dispute that these children and their parents often 
share a deep love. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say don't do it," she says. "I would never tell people not to have 
children. The point I was trying to make is you just can't push these issues 
aside. You have to think about these things and about what you can do." 
</P>
<P>
For instance, her research revealed that children of older parents tend to be 
happiest if their parents spend a lot of time with them. 
</P>
<P>
"Go to the football game with your kid, even if you can't play football," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Strong agrees that 40-ish is not a prime time to have children, and, she says 
with hindsight, she would have done things differently. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to limit your options, which is what I did," she says. "You 
don't want to say, 'At 40, I'll have my children.' But I still think this is a 
great opportunity for women in their 40s. Having a child of your own is such a 
great experience." It's even kind of fun to have beaten -- well, fooled -- the 
biological clock. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Strong underwent another embryo transfer and will soon find out if 
she is pregnant. And Pulitzer is set to begin medical tests to evaluate her 
chances for a second pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Childbirth at 45? 
</P>
<P>
"Piece of cake," Pulitzer says.

CASUALTIES OF GORE

<P>
In the best puzzle movies, the pieces fit -- eventually. But if you try to 
piece together "Jacob's Ladder," all you get for your trouble is more pieces. 
</P>
<P>
It's a movie about a man experiencing dreadful, recurring hallucinations and, 
since it's shot almost entirely from his point of view, you never know what's 
real and what isn't. Why should we care? The multi-layered weirdness works on a 
basic, horror-film level but it's without psychological resonance. We're more 
concerned with the nature of the events than with the nature of the man they're 
happening to. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the film (opening Friday citywide), Jacob (Tim Robbins) is 
severely wounded in a skirmish in the Mekong Delta. When we next see him, 
apparently years later, he is living in Brooklyn, separated from his wife and 
working for the post office. Trapped one night in an underground subway, he 
thinks he sees ghouls peering out at him from subway cars. When the demons 
reappear in the city streets, he thinks he is going crazy. 
</P>
<P>
The appropriately named Jezebel (Elizabeth Pena), the woman he lives with, 
tries to cool him down -- literally. After one of Jacob's hallucinatory jags, 
he catches such a fever that she dumps him in the tub with 50 pounds of crushed 
ice. 
</P>
<P>
Adrian Lyne, the director, is best known for "Fatal Attraction" and 
"Flashdance." The screenwriter, Bruce Joel Rubin, wrote "Ghost." That's an 
unholy alliance if I ever heard one. Lyne is a master of lickety-split visuals 
that work audiences over like the spiffy TV commercials he used to make. In 
"Jacob's Ladder," he isn't merely portraying paranoia, he's selling it. 
</P>
<P>
There's a bludgeoning quality to his work in this film that detracts from even 
its good moments -- like the cuts to demons that are so rapid-fire you're not 
sure you actually saw them at all. (The expert editor is Tom Rolf.) When Lyne 
stages one of Jacob's freak-outs at a dance party, he turns the sequence into 
an orgiastic horror. It's "Flashgore." 
</P>
<P>
One of the traditional pleasures of reality/fantasy scare movies is discovering 
the horror as you go along. "Jacob's Ladder," after its Vietnam credit 
sequence, opens well. Jacob's descent into the subway netherworld has an 
insidious allure; everything seems realistic and yet slightly off. When Lyne 
trusts the audience to settle into the subtleties of mood he can be very 
effective. But he doesn't trust often, and the assaultiveness of the imagery 
and the set pieces turns ugly after awhile. 
</P>
<P>
It's an assaultiveness unrelieved by humor. Isn't it redundant to film a movie 
about a city crawling with demons in New York? There's a great untapped black 
comic premise here: In a city like New York, how can you separate out the 
demons from the regulars? If the film had been set in a small Midwestern town 
-- as was the cult horror classic "Carnival of Souls," from which this film 
borrows liberally -- it might have seemed a lot spookier. 
</P>
<P>
In the way the film mixes dread and uplift, "Jacob's Ladder" resembles "Ghost," 
sometimes right down to the bathed-in-holy-light staging. But "Ghost" had a 
romantic core of metaphysical sappiness that "Jacob's Ladder" lacks. Jacob 
isn't a romantic character; he is too much of a cipher to be much of anything. 
Even though Lyne and Rubin attempt to use his Vietnam servitude to rack up 
anti-war points, it's just window dressing. This film is about as socially 
conscious as "Total Recall," another bludgeon derby that also featured a zonked 
hero with a faulty memory bank. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the oddest thing about "Jacob's Ladder" (rated R for violence, nudity and 
profanity) is that, underneath all its fantasy/reality avant-gardism, it's 
rather testily old-fashioned. Danny Aiello, playing Jacob's best (and only) 
friend, is the film's voice of sweet reason. He is a chiropractor -- a big, 
burly angel -- who adjusts Jacob's back and soul. One of his choicest pieces of 
advice is that Jacob should stop playing around and return to the wife who 
still loves him. And just so we don't forget what a wrong woman Jezebel is, 
Lyne has Elizabeth Pena traipse about their apartment topless. The film is 
shameless about crying "Shame!" 
</P>
<P>
Really effective horror films make us participants in the horror. "Jacob's 
Ladder" doesn't draw us in in that way. It's a movie about interior states 
that's all on the outside.

'ASK THE MEDIA' FALLS FAR SHORT OF LOFTY GOAL 
</P>

<P>
Judging by some of the questions and the general grumbling afterward, many 
members of the Old Globe theater audience felt cheated by Sunday's heavily 
hyped "Ask the Media" program, moderated by ABC anchorman Peter Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
"The way this forum is organized suggests why many of us are unhappy with the 
media," one questioner told the panel near the end of the program, summing up 
the feelings of many in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Billed as an opportunity for the public to grill the media, the program, 
produced by ABC-affiliate KGTV (Channel 10), instead wallowed in self-promotion 
for the station. From the panel stacked with Channel 10 employees to shots of 
Channel 10 personnel watching in the audience, there was a general 
self-congratulatory tone to the event that didn't go unnoticed by the audience. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, a questioner flatly asked Channel 10 general manager Ed Quinn why 
no other television stations were represented on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our show," Quinn replied. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Jennings was there to put the response in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"Hands up who thought that was a mealy-mouthed answer," Jennings said. Hands 
went up throughout the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
People wouldn't have been so upset if the concept of the program hadn't held 
such promise. People have real questions about the operations of the media, 
evidenced by the tremendous response for tickets to the show. 
</P>
<P>
However, despite the station's best efforts to promote the forum as the most 
important event since the first walk on the moon, the program fell far short of 
being a "unique drama," as the event's slick program promised. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, which included Channel 10 employees Quinn, anchorman Stephen Clark 
and commentator Herb Cawthorne, found it difficult to discuss the real issues 
of how and why the media cover stories. San Diego Tribune Editor Neil Morgan 
was the only representative of a daily newspaper, and Clark was the closest 
thing to a television reporter on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
Panelists Cawthorne and ex-mayor-turned-radio-talk-show-host Roger Hedgecock 
seemed better suited to be asking questions, rather than answering for the 
media, considering the well-covered scandals both have lived through. Both were 
feisty and articulate, but they were far from representing the viewpoint of the 
working press. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Cawthorne suggested that major newspapers don't go after big 
corporations because companies "pay the freight," a suggestion most in the 
media find ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of the show, Hedgecock astounded more than one member of the 
audience by saying the relationship between the press and politicians "must be 
adversarial." This from a man who has claimed for years that the press hounded 
him from office. 
</P>
<P>
The best debate was invariably between panelists, not between the audience and 
the panel as it should have been. 
</P>
<P>
El Sol de San Diego editor and publisher Julie Rocha -- who was on the panel to 
"keep up the women's end as well as many others," Jennings told the audience 
before the live broadcast started -- challenged the minority hiring practices 
of local media. 
</P>
<P>
"When I turn on Channel 10 I'm not seeing anything but white faces at the 
anchor desk," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Later she challenged the Tribune's hiring practices, questioning if Latinos are 
being promoted. 
</P>
<P>
"They are on the way up," said Morgan, who earlier was challenged by Jennings 
over his suggestion that Dan Rather's interview with Saddam Hussein was more 
entertainment than news. 
</P>
<P>
"When will they arrive?" Rocha shot back. 
</P>
<P>
"They're arriving," Morgan said rather weakly. 
</P>
<P>
Rocha's comments were a sharp contrast to Clark's, who said earlier he was just 
glad he wasn't discriminated against because he is white. Fortunately, later in 
the program, a member of the audience made it clear that there were several 
qualified blacks and Hispanics who were equally qualified for anchor jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn, termed "that smilin' Irishman" by one questioner, drew the most vehement 
responses from the audience and was the panelist most prone to spurts of 
rhetoric. At one point, Jennings asked Quinn if Channel 10 had an environmental 
reporter. 
</P>
<P>
"We have people specializing in different areas and some overlap," Quinn said. 
To put it more succinctly, the answer was no. 
</P>
<P>
Even honesty got Quinn in trouble. He drew a chorus of boos when he bluntly 
stated that promotions for the news during prime time, which purposely don't 
tell viewers the whole story, are designed to attract ratings. 
</P>
<P>
The panel was not helped by several vague and poorly worded questions from the 
audience, but when serious issues did crystallize, the panel seemed unable or 
unwilling to tackle the question. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the very real question of why the media don't better cover 
lesser-known political candidates was indirectly raised, but was never really 
addressed by the panel.

OLD GLOBE, LA JOLLA PLAYHOUSE WIN GRANTS

In a nationwide competition in which 35 theaters proposed entries for the 
funding of new plays, San Diego theaters have been awarded two of the four 
grants provided by AT&amp;T. The announcement was made Monday at press 
conferences in New York and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla Playhouse will receive $40,000 and the Old Globe Theatre $50,000. 
Each theater will also receive a national publicity campaign and marketing 
support as part of the year-old "The AT&amp;T New Plays for the Nineties 
Project." 
</P>
<P>
The winning project picked for the La Jolla Playhouse was "The Heliotrope 
Bouquet by Scott Joplin and Louis Chauvin," a new Eric Overmyer play about 
ragtime artists Joplin and Chauvin, slated for August, 1991. The Center Stage 
in Baltimore also received $40,000 to produce the play. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Wojewodski Jr., artistic director of the Center Stage, will direct the 
show with his company Feb. 20, 1991, and at the Playhouse in August. 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla show is planned for the new 400-seat Mandell Weiss Forum, which is 
under construction. 
</P>
<P>
Lillian Garrett's "The White Rose," based on the true story of German students 
who agitated against Adolf Hitler during the Nazi era, will have its world 
premiere at the Old Globe on Jan. 17, 1991. Craig Noel, executive director of 
the theater, will direct the show on its 581-seat main stage. 
</P>
<P>
The third play, "Back to the Blanket," by Gary Leon Hill, examines the impact 
of the 1890 massacre of American Indians at Wounded Knee, S.D., on four people. 
It will be presented at the Denver Center Theatre Company on May 17, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Three new adaptations of classical plays also will be supported under 
AT&amp;T's 5-year-old OnStage Classics: 
</P>
<P>
Henrik Ibsen's "When We Dead Awaken," adapted by Robert Brustein and designed 
and directed by Robert Wilson at the American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge, 
Mass., in February, and at the Alley Theatre in Houston in May. 
</P>
<P>
A modern music-theater version of Shakespeare's "The Winter's Tale," adapted by 
the Cornerstone Theatre Company, that will tour 12 states and the District of 
Columbia in the summer and fall. 
</P>
<P>
And the program's first internationally sponsored event, John Dryden's "All For 
Love," starring Diana Rigg, at the Almeida Theatre in London in April, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Although the gifts will pay for only a fraction of actual production costs -- 
the average Old Globe production of a play runs as much as $250,000 to 
$300,000, for example -- both Des McAnuff, artistic director of the La Jolla 
Playhouse, and Jack O'Brien, artistic director of the Old Globe Theatre, said 
the amount will make a critical difference in their companies' ability to mount 
these plays. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have had to find some kind of special funding to do it," McAnuff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, officials at both the La Jolla Playhouse and the Old Globe said 
the awards may carry long-term benefits in attracting new sources of funding 
from corporations and charitable foundations. 
</P>
<P>
The gift from AT&amp;T can have a decisive impact at a time when regional 
theaters "are becoming much more dependent on national resources," said Thomas 
Hall, managing director of the Old Globe and president of the League of 
Resident Theatres (LORT), a national organization of regional theaters. 
</P>
<P>
Recession is hitting regional theaters nationwide, Hall said. Most regional 
theaters are reporting a drop in corporate contributions and subscription 
ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, where few national corporations are based and theaters are 
competitive for what appears to be a shrinking pool of donor dollars, 
executives say it's increasingly difficult to survive strictly through local 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
Although AT&amp;T has a four-season history of funding the La Jolla Playhouse, 
beginning with "Shout Up a Morning" in 1986, the Old Globe received its first 
funding from AT&amp;T for "Cobb" last June. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien noted that, despite the Old Globe's national reputation, this is the 
first time it has been funded by a national corporation as part of a national 
program, rather than a program local to San Diego. The earlier grant was 
provided by the San Diego offices of AT&amp;T. 
</P>
<P>
"We're jubilant. This has to have reverberations in the corporate community. 
Instead of working from the inside out, we're working from the outside in," 
O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
"AT&amp;T brings a tremendous amount of recognition within the corporate 
community," Alan Levey, managing director of the La Jolla Playhouse, said. "So, 
when you solicit other companies for their support and you say one of the 
world's largest multinational corporations supports you, that brings along a 
very significant stamp of approval, of endorsement." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not only important in terms of shrinking funds, but it's very helpful in 
terms of attracting new artists and writers," Hall said. "It keeps people 
throughout the country aware of the fact there are strong ongoing programs 
here. I think the fact that there are two theaters within 10 miles of each 
other is also important." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Lou Floyd, cultural programs marketing manager for AT&amp;T, speaking from 
AT&amp;T headquarters in New York, said an AT&amp;T OnStage sponsorship also 
means continuing support from AT&amp;T itself. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a one-time deal for us," said Floyd. "When you work with us on an 
AT&amp;T OnStage partnership, you become part of the AT&amp;T alumni. We invite 
them to talk once a year about corporate sponsorship of the arts. If we can 
help some of these theaters get funding elsewhere, we do. It's definitely a 
long-term relationship." 
</P>
<P>
For some, the double award may confirm San Diego's growing reputation as a 
theater boom town. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd noted that the selection of two plays from San Diego "says something 
about what's going on in your area. . . . For promotion reasons, it wouldn't 
make any sense to be picking two in one city. But the advisory committee just 
thought some of the best theater this year was going to be happening in this 
area." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the city's reputation for quality theater coexists with a fragile 
financial support for the arts that last year found the La Jolla Playhouse in a 
crisis campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The Playhouse, reportedly successful in its campaign, has yet to officially 
announce that the crisis is over. Meanwhile, the San Diego Repertory Theatre 
has just begun a crisis campaign, saying that it may not be able to finish its 
1990 season. The Gaslamp Quarter Theatre Company also is struggling to raise 
money to assure a 1991 season.

Working-level representatives of the world's 24 wealthiest industrial countries 
assemble today in the Belgian capital to decide how to apportion $272 million

High on the agenda will be whether to add Romania to the list of recipient

Human rights infractions kept Bucharest off the list approved at the last 
ministerial meeting of the so-called G-24 countries last July. But it has since

The African National Congress wants the sports boycott -- which is seen as

SOUTH AFRICA'S CONSTITUTIONAL CRY: BE ORIGINAL;

PRETORIA, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ensconced in a tiny cubicle of a South African think tank, Barry de Villiers 
draws inspiration these days from the travails of America's Founding Fathers 
and the muggy summer of 1787. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a number of times when it looked as if things would fall apart," 
the South African constitutional expert said recently, nodding toward an 
anecdotal book about the Philadelphia convention that he keeps on his desk. 
</P>
<P>
"At one point, one of the leaders -- an old, grayish gentleman -- said: 'Either 
this convention is going to break down or we will have to pray to see if we can 
keep it together,' " De Villiers noted. 
</P>
<P>
The delegates prayed and eventually emerged with what is today the world's 
oldest written constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Like the American colonies in 1787, South Africa in 1990 is preparing to write 
a new constitution. That document will, for the first time in the country's 
history, give blacks a vote in national government and formally bind this 
ethnically and politically diverse population under one democratic banner. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever South Africa's constitution looks like in the end, it will be one of a 
kind, the experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"We can study other countries, but after that we have to develop something 
new," said De Villiers, who heads the 6-month-old Center for Constitutional 
Analysis at the Human Sciences Research Council in Pretoria. "That's the most 
important lesson from the American experiment: Be original." 
</P>
<P>
The government predicts that full-blown constitutional negotiations could begin 
early next year, and an urgent hunt for governmental models has begun in board 
rooms, drawing rooms, think tanks, college classrooms, law offices and 
political party meetings across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of reports, pamphlets and books on possible constitutions have been 
produced. Dozens of constitutions, from Belgium's and Switzerland's to Fiji's 
and Canada's, are jammed onto computer disks for analysis. And some academics 
even are studying the chaotic behind-the-scenes process by which the United 
States and other countries drew up and ratified their constitutions. 
</P>
<P>
The primary goal of this cottage industry is to find a system that will extend 
full voting rights to 27 million blacks, correct the economic imbalances 
created by 42 years of apartheid and also safeguard the civil rights of 5 
million whites. 
</P>
<P>
President Frederik W. de Klerk has promised the white electorate a separate 
referendum on any new constitution. But it also must be acceptable to blacks, 
who will make up the largest voting bloc when it comes up for nationwide 
ratification. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be a bumpy road, definitely. It would be naive to expect 
otherwise," said Margie Keeton, a member of the "Scenario Planning Team" at the 
giant business conglomerate, Anglo-American Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the government has been trying to persuade black and white 
opposition groups simply to accept its invitation to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson Mandela's African National Congress, which most analysts believe has the 
widest support among blacks, has tentatively agreed to participate, as have 
other black leaders, including Inkatha Freedom Party chief Mangosuthu Gatsha 
Buthelezi. 
</P>
<P>
Two left-wing black groups, the Pan-Africanist Congress and the Azanian 
People's Organization, and the right-wing white Conservative Party continue to 
hold out, and De Klerk said he will go ahead without them, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
But before even the preamble can be written, South Africa's competing political 
forces must agree on a negotiating forum. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC wants a multiracial election to select an assembly to write the 
constitution. It also wants an interim government installed to watch over the 
country. The government has flatly refused both ANC demands but says it would 
be willing to grant black leaders a direct role in government during the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Most analysts believe those differences can be overcome, though, and that 
constitutional negotiations are imminent. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, South Africa is bulging with suggested political alternatives 
that would do everything from breaking the country into pieces to creating a 
socialist state: 
</P>
<P>
* The Conservative Party favors the status quo -- keeping South Africa and its 
major cities under white control and allowing blacks to govern only in the 
nominally independent "homelands." 
</P>
<P>
* The Oranje-Werkers Unie (Orange Workers Union) wants to carve a large, 
irregularly shaped chunk out of the fertile and mineral-rich center of the 
country where whites already outnumber blacks, leaving the rest of South Africa 
to black majority rule. 
</P>
<P>
* Seventy-five families who support Carel Boshoff's Afrikaner Volkswag 
(People's Guardian), a cultural movement, have already moved into what he 
envisions as a white homeland on rugged territory in the northern Cape 
Province. 
</P>
<P>
* The Boer State Party wants to turn the clock back and reinstitute the 
boundaries of the white Boer republics that existed in the late 1800s, leaving 
a white nation covering about half the existing country and incorporating 
Johannesburg, Pretoria and the 2.5-million population township of Soweto. 
</P>
<P>
* The Pan-Africanist Congress and the Azanian People's Organization reject 
power-sharing in favor of a socialist government, installed by a one-person, 
one-vote election, that would lift up the oppressed black masses and 
redistribute land from whites to blacks. 
</P>
<P>
In between those extremes, however, are the ideas being considered by the most 
important players in the negotiating forum -- the ruling National Party of 
President De Klerk, the multiracial ANC and the Zulu-based Inkatha party. 
</P>
<P>
None of those parties has offered a constitutional blueprint, but each says it 
wants a unified South African state with multiple political parties, an 
independent judiciary and a bill of rights. Despite broad areas of agreement, 
though, the gulf between their visions of the future remains large. 
</P>
<P>
The thinking of the National Party is evident in a detailed constitutional 
proposal drawn up recently by the Broederbond (Brotherhood), a secret Afrikaner 
think tank whose members include De Klerk and key members of his Cabinet. It 
offers an elaborate plan to give blacks full political participation while also 
protecting whites and other minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Under that proposal, the country would be divided into 10 regions and governed 
by a two-chamber Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The 300-seat House of Representatives would be elected by all voters -- black 
and white -- on a common roll, with seats divided proportionally according to 
the number of votes collected by each political party. Decisions would require 
a simple majority. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate would give 100 seats to senators chosen in regional elections and 10 
seats each to officially registered "groups" that share a common language, 
culture or religion. Senate decisions would require a two-thirds majority. 
</P>
<P>
Deadlocks between the two houses would be broken by an Advisory Council, 
nominated by the Senate, and a quarter-plus-one members of that council could 
veto any matter in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The Broederbond proposal includes a bill of rights, a ceremonial head of state 
and a Cabinet made up of representatives from the House, each region and each 
registered "group." The Cabinet would initiate legislation and make decisions 
by consensus. 
</P>
<P>
For a government that until last year was trying to force blacks into ethnic 
homelands and take away their citizenship, the Broederbond proposal represents 
a radical change in thinking. 
</P>
<P>
But it doesn't go nearly far enough for the ANC. ANC leaders argue that the 
Broederbond model would, in effect, maintain white veto power over important 
legislation, such as attempts to redistribute the country's wealth and redress 
inequities in education and land ownership. 
</P>
<P>
"It's totally unworkable," said Albie Sachs, a white lawyer on the ANC's 
20-member constitutional committee. "The government still has a long way to go 
to reach an acceptable democratic position. They don't want power-sharing; they 
want power division. It's hard for them to let go." 
</P>
<P>
The ANC has not yet offered a constitutional model of its own, but its leaders 
favor a multi-party democracy with strong central control and a bill of rights, 
a rarity in Africa. The ANC contends that whites and other cultural, religious 
and language groups would be adequately protected by the bill of rights, 
enforced by an independent judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi's Inkatha, like its bitter rival the ANC, supports a black 
majority-rule government. But Inkatha says it's prepared to compromise to make 
sure that minorities, which could include its own supporters, are not dominated 
by an ANC-controlled government. 
</P>
<P>
While the differences between the ANC and the government remain large, both 
sides -- along with business leaders and academics watching from the sidelines 
-- are quietly and urgently exploring ways of bridging the gap. 
</P>
<P>
"The first step is to try to open people's minds and get them out of their 
straitjackets," said De Villiers, of the Center for Constitutional Analysis. 
"And since February (when the ANC was legalized), all the parties have been 
searching for clues. Not one has a rigid idea." 
</P>
<P>
Several organizations, including the President's Council advisory group in 
Parliament and the independent Law Commission, have been drawing up proposals 
for a new constitution and a bill of rights. 
</P>
<P>
De Villiers' center, funded by Parliament, opened in May to dissect and 
computerize more than 30 of the world's constitutions and help all sides in the 
South African debate search for ways around the most contentious issues 
dividing them. Its 34 researchers, in colleges and law offices, are 
categorizing constitutions to compare bills of rights, systems of checks and 
balances and minority protection clauses, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
"For the moment, it's almost impossible to discuss group rights in South 
Africa, even though the principle has been used in many constitutions around 
the world," De Villiers said. "There's a very deeply ingrained suspicion (among 
blacks) about 'group protection.' " 
</P>
<P>
The suspicion among whites, on the other hand, is that their civil rights will 
be trampled. That's why many are seeking some form of veto power in the new 
constitution. De Klerk must carefully consider their fears or risk losing more 
white support for any new constitution. 
</P>
<P>
However, "At the end of the day, if the government wants to entrench white 
privilege, it won't be able to get a new constitution," De Villiers warns. 
</P>
<P>
There is plenty of room for maneuvering, though, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC and others have been looking closely at the Swedish constitution, which 
gives cultural groups the right to go to court to test legislation that would 
infringe on their rights. South Africa could take the Swedish model a step 
further by allowing cultural groups, which would most likely be racially 
homogenous, to review and make recommendations on laws before they are passed. 
</P>
<P>
Another suggestion has been a system of cantons, similar to those of 
Switzerland, that would create several hundred largely autonomous districts 
with a weak central government. 
</P>
<P>
So far, both the ANC and the government agree that they can only resolve their 
constitutional differences by talking. 
</P>
<P>
"We start with such a big gap of distrust between the main actors," said Gerrit 
Viljoen, the government minister of constitutional development. "It's only in 
the process of preliminary talks and negotiations that we can overcome that." 
</P>
<P>
Sachs, of the ANC, says he wants a constitution under which "all South Africans 
feel comfortable. We want to reduce conflict, and the crucial thing is for 
people to start talking to each other." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Proposed Bill of Rights The Broederbond (Brotherhood), the secret Afrikaner 
society that has heavily influenced the South African government's reform 
program, proposes to guarantee the following rights: 
</P>
<P>
1. Life (although death penalty may be imposed in case of murder and high 
treason). 
</P>
<P>
2. Human dignity and equality before the law. 
</P>
<P>
3. A good name and reputation. 
</P>
<P>
4. Spiritual and physical integrity. 
</P>
<P>
5. Freedom from slavery. 
</P>
<P>
6. Privacy. 
</P>
<P>
7. Freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
8. To freely carry out scientific research and to practice art if it doesn't 
infringe on accepted social norms. 
</P>
<P>
9. Freedom of choice in education and training. 
</P>
<P>
10. Integrity of the family, freedom of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
11. To move freely within South Africa 
</P>
<P>
12. Guarantees against arbitrary refusal of a passport, exile, and prevention 
of emigration. 
</P>
<P>
13. To engage freely in economic intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
14. Private property. 
</P>
<P>
15. To associate freely. 
</P>
<P>
16. To freely form political parties. 
</P>
<P>
17. To assemble peacefully, to hold demonstrations and present petitions. 
</P>
<P>
18. Universal suffrage for those over the age of 18. 
</P>
<P>
19. Free use of native language and free practice of culture and religion for 
all. 
</P>
<P>
20. The use of one's mother tongue in courts of law. 
</P>
<P>
21. Personal freedom and safety. 
</P>
<P>
22. A maximum period of detention without charge of 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
23. A fair and public trial, to be regarded as innocent until proven guilty and 
to appeal a court's decision. 
</P>
<P>
24. Guarantees against torture, assault, or cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
25. To seek a court ruling in civil disputes. 
</P>
<P>
26. Due process in administrative proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
The courts would be empowered to interpret the Bill of Rights, and they could 
only be amended or suspended by a three-quarters majority of all members of 
each house of Parliament or by a majority of all registered voters in a 
referendum.

SINGAPORE'S PARADOX: HOSTILITY TO PRESS, TV DESPITE LITTLE TO HIDE; 
</P>
<P>
THE U.S. ALLY SEEMINGLY ROLLS OUT THE WELCOME MAT TO ALL BUT NEWS 
ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH THE ISLAND'S PRIME MINISTER ACCUSES OF INTERFERENCE. AFTER 
ONE LEGAL BATTLE, THE ASIAN WALL STREET JOURNAL DECIDES TO HALT CIRCULATION.

SINGAPORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is one of the closest U.S. allies in the Pacific, offering access to 
military facilities at a time when the Philippines is trying to boot the 
Americans out. But despite a strong affinity for the United States and many 
aspects of its culture, Singapore continues to take a defiant stand against 
what it considers to be the unwelcome incursions of Western news media. 
</P>
<P>
Two developments earlier this month help illustrate Singapore's stand, perhaps 
the toughest in the developed world: 
</P>
<P>
* The Asian Wall Street Journal, sister publication of the Journal in the 
United States, announced that it was halting circulation in the island republic 
after a lengthy legal dispute with the Singapore government. 
</P>
<P>
* Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, whose political party has ruled Singapore since 
it gained independence in 1965, issued a scathing criticism of the Western 
media, accusing television inparticular of creating false hopes among Chinese 
students during last year's disturbances in Beijing and charging that American 
news organizations had set out two years ago to deliberately change the view of 
Congress about Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
"Singapore is a totally urban society with state-of-the-art-telecommunications, 
and no government can effectively censor what the people read," Lee declared. 
"But the government can and will insist on no interference in the domestic 
politics of Singapore." 
</P>
<P>
Singapore itself has a fairly tame domestic press, which never criticizes 
government policy. Singaporeans are also denied permission to erect satellite 
dishes to receive foreign television programs such as CNN, and videotapes 
entering the country are heavily censored, primarily to maintain a prudish 
standard about sex in films. But books are not censored and the government 
retransmits the foreign service of the British Broadcasting Corp., including 
its news programs. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, other Southeast Asian countries limit critical reporting in the 
local vernacular press, but few besides Vietnam and Cambodia seek to control 
what foreign publications circulate among the educated elite and foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, the government draws the line at what it considers "interference 
in domestic politics," which it defines broadly as Singapore's political 
system, public institutions, ideology and government policies. 
</P>
<P>
Its hostility toward the Western media is often regarded by both journalists 
and native Singaporeans as a paradox because among Southeast Asian nations it 
has the least to hide: a booming economy, with a corruption-free government, an 
enviable lifestyle and civic amenities that are the wonder of Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Singapore has clashed over the years with a number of foreign 
publications, including Time magazine and Asiaweek, a regional news weekly. Lee 
has even become personally embroiled in disputes with foreign columnists, 
challenging one -- Bernard Levin of the London Times -- to a televised debate. 
</P>
<P>
But never has a dispute lasted as long or been as bitter as the one pitting 
Singapore against the Asian Wall Street Journal and the Far Eastern Economic 
Review, a regional weekly which is also owned by the Journal's parent, Dow 
Jones &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The government has prevented the Hong Kong-based Review from basing a 
correspondent here since 1987; it similarly barred the Journal from having a 
correspondent in 1988. The confrontation briefly bubbled into an international 
incident when Secretary of States James A. Baker III wrote to ask the 
government to relax the ban for his visit in August, but the Singaporeans 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute with the Review stemmed from an article over detentions of church 
workers, while the Journal was criticized for an article about a second-tier 
Singaporean securities market called Sesdaq. The Singaporeans were angered when 
they were not given a "right of reply" in the form of lengthy letters that they 
insisted could not be edited for publication; they then tried to buy 
advertisements that were also refused. 
</P>
<P>
When the Journal published an editorial critical of Singaporean courts' 
handling of the legal case, Lee sued the newspaper for libel. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the government ordered the Review to limit its circulation to 500 
copies, and the magazine decided to halt sales in Singapore. So now a pirated 
version of the magazine circulates with government sanction, but with the 
advertisements blanked out. 
</P>
<P>
The Journal had also seen its circulation limited to 400 copies, down from 
5,000 before the ban. In announcing its decision to halt circulation, the 
Journal cited a new press law passed by Parliament in August. 
</P>
<P>
The law requires foreign publications to obtain a permit from the Ministry of 
Communications and Information. The law gives the minister the power to reduce 
circulation at any time and to revoke the permit without giving a reason. The 
minister may also require the publication to put up a deposit to meet costs 
arising out of potential court actions.

"What the government of Singapore wants is for the foreign press to practice 
self-censorship," the Journal said in a subsequent editorial. "A facade of 
factual reporting will be allowed, but any statement by authorities must be 
taken at face value; lest it disturb either the political monopoly of the 
(ruling) People's Action Party or the pretense of democracy, the press shall 
not report the opinions of critics within Singapore, let alone the defenses of 
those in disputes with the government." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Singapore takes a different tack. In correspondence with the 
Journal, Goh Chok Tong, the first deputy prime minister, said foreign 
publications should report "events in Singapore as outsiders, for outsiders." 
</P>
<P>
"It is not their responsibility to protect Singaporean citizens against what 
they may perceive to be an authoritarian government, or to ensure the 
functioning of a 'healthy democracy' in Singapore," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A Western diplomat in Singapore described Lee as a strong personality who by 
force of will turned the island from a backwater swamp into a world financial 
center. "The preoccupation is to maintain control," the diplomat said, "and the 
Western press represents a wild card. He can't control it, and there is a 
potential for destabilizing the situation." 
</P>
<P>
But Lee went further in his speech, which was given to the British Commonwealth 
Press Union in Hong Kong earlier this month. He said news now travels so 
quickly that governments have to adjust their ways of formulating policy. Lee 
suggested for example that when Dan Rather of CBS interviewed Saddam Hussein of 
Iraq, "he ventured into the domain of U.S. foreign policy at a time of crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Lee blamed television for creating false hopes in China's rebellious students 
last year during the Tian An Men Square demonstrations. He also blamed the 
print media for causing excessive optimism in Hong Kong after a hand-over 
agreement was signed between Britain and China in 1984. After last year's 
events, he said "the press created excessive pessimism." 
</P>
<P>
Lee said the American press "campaigned tenaciously and skillfully" against the 
Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. The result was that the Bush Administration altered 
course, he said, while the situation on the ground had not changed. 
</P>
<P>
He charged that while the American press had discovered that it could move 
mountains in Washington, "they were not an irresistible force in a foreign 
Third World country like Singapore." 
</P>
<P>
But why go to all the trouble of so public a clash, he asked rhetorically. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, among other things, it brings home to Singaporeans that regardless of 
the pontifications of foreign correspondents and commentators, it is the values 
of the elected government of Singapore that will prevail."

CHRISTMAS WITH 'GODFATHER'; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: FOLLOWING A WEEKEND SCREENING, PARAMOUNT EXECUTIVES DECIDE NOT TO DELAY 
THE COPPOLA EPIC UNTIL EASTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

All the magazine editors who took a leap of faith by featuring stars from "The 
Godfather, Part III" on their November and December covers can relax. So can 
the 1,800 theater owners who guaranteed a minimum 12-week run for the movie: 
Paramount Pictures executives announced Monday that they will release 
"Godfather III" on Christmas Day after all. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, Paramount defied the common wisdom in Hollywood, which held that 
its perfectionist director, Francis Coppola, would refuse to turn over the 
2-hour, 40-minute epic in time for a Christmas release. Even Paramount's own 
marketing department was poised last week for either a Christmas or Easter 
release. 
</P>
<P>
But after Coppola and Paramount executives saw the film last weekend at a San 
Francisco screening, they agreed that it could be released on Christmas Day. On 
Sunday, the clock ran out for any changes that Coppola could make. In the 
coming weeks, technical work on the film will be completed and 1,800 prints 
will be produced for shipment to theaters in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to make the Christmas Day schedule -- thereby assuring that the 
film qualifies for this year's Academy Awards -- represents a personal coup for 
Paramount Pictures' chief executive Frank Mancuso, who has made "Godfather III" 
one of the highest priorities of his administration. Paramount executives have 
been trying to persuade Coppola to make a third installment ever since 1974, 
when "The Godfather, Part II" was released. But the director refused to commit 
until February, 1989, when he started writing a script with Mario Puzo, author 
of the best-selling novel that inspired the first two movies. 
</P>
<P>
"Godfather III" -- which stars Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, Diane Keaton as 
his estranged wife, Talia Shire as his sister and Andy Garcia as an 
illegitimate Corleone -- has had a troubled time getting to the screen. The 
production was marred by real-life lovers' quarrels between Pacino and Keaton 
and a last-minute decision by Winona Ryder -- then suffering from exhaustion 
and a severe sinus infection -- to drop out. Coppola then fueled a near revolt 
on the set by tapping his daughter Sofia to replace Ryder in the role of 
Michael Corleone's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Set in 1979, two decades after "Godfather II" left off, "Godfather III" 
explores Michael Corleone's attempts to make his family's investments 
legitimate and his Mafia family's ties to the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
Originally budgeted at $44 million, the total cost -- which included months of 
filming on location in Italy and New York -- has risen to close to $55 million. 
</P>
<P>
One and a half years in the making, "Godfather III" is one of the most 
talked-about films of the decade. The first two "Godfather" movies won Academy 
Awards for best picture and have brought in revenues of about $800 million from 
theaters, TV, and sales of videocassettes. Competing studios are so anxious 
about the "Godfather III" that an underground video of an early cut of the film 
has made the rounds of several executives' screening rooms, according to 
industry sources.

BYRDS, IKE &amp; TINA NAMED TO ROCK HALL OF FAME; 
</P>
<P>
POP MUSIC: THE IMPRESSIONS, JOHN LEE HOOKER AND WILSON PICKETT ARE AMONG THE 
NEWEST MEMBERS OF ROCK 'N' ROLL ROYALTY.

The Byrds, the Los Angeles band whose 1965 recording of "Mr. Tambourine Man" 
ignited the folk-rock movement, and Ike &amp; Tina Turner, whose soul revue was 
among the most dynamic live acts ever in pop, are among the seven new inductees 
to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Other performers whose election was announced Monday at a press conference in 
Cleveland are R&amp;B singer LaVern Baker, blues singer-guitarist John Lee 
Hooker, soul vocal group the Impressions, soul vocalist Wilson Pickett and the 
late blues singer-songwriter Jimmy Reed. 
</P>
<P>
Blues legend Howlin' Wolf was chosen as this year's honoree in the early 
influence/forefather category, while record producers Dave Bartholomew and 
Ralph Bass were named in the non-performing division. The artists will be 
inducted into the Hall of Fame at a dinner Jan. 16 in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Roger McGuinn, the leader of the Byrds, said in Los Angeles that he was 
thrilled by the selection and expects all five members of the original group to 
be on hand to accept the award. 
</P>
<P>
Ike Turner, who began serving a four-year prison sentence for a misdemeanor 
drug offense in February in the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo, 
could not be reached for comment. Carol Pinkins, associate warden at the 
facility, said that she doubted if Turner would be allowed to attend the 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Impressions leader Curtis Mayfield, who has been hospitalized in Georgia since 
a freak accident at an outdoor concert in August left him paralyzed from the 
neck down, hopes to join the Impressions at the event. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking it day by day," Mayfield said Monday. "I'm very moved that the 
Impressions will be honored." 
</P>
<P>
Recording artists become eligible for the Hall of Fame 25 years after their 
first recording and are chosen on the basis of contributions to or influence on 
the course of rock 'n' roll. More than 300 performers, producers, writers, 
record executives and broadcasters voted in this year's selection process. 
</P>
<P>
This year's inductees were elected from a group of 15 nominees that also 
included such artists as Johnny Cash, Frankie Lymon, Gene Vincent and the 
Yardbirds. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 new musicians and producers brings to 68 the number of performers, 
non-performers and forefathers voted into the Hall of Fame since the nonprofit 
organization was conceived in 1985 by Atlantic Records founder and chairman 
Ahmet Ertegun. 
</P>
<P>
Suzan Evans, executive director of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, 
predicted that construction on the foundation's still unrealized museum will 
begin next fall. About $43 million has been raised to build the facility. 
</P>
<P>
The original Tower City site for the building was scrapped last summer in favor 
of a new lake-front plot in downtown Cleveland. Architect I.M. Pei, who 
designed the new wing of the National Gallery in Washington and the new 
entrance and addition to the Louvre in Paris, is expanding his original design 
to accommodate the new location.

'GHOST' WRITER FINALLY MAKES THE TOP RUNG; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: AFTER A 20-YEAR STRUGGLE, BRUCE JOEL RUBIN IS RIDING HIGH. HIS SHOCKING 
'JACOB'S LADDER' OPENS FRIDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Standing out on the balcony of the penthouse suite at the Chateau Marmont, 
Bruce Joel Rubin looked a little like a star-struck tourist seeing Mann's 
Chinese Theatre for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"This is where Robert De Niro stays when he's here," Rubin said, gesturing 
toward his spacious suite. "It practically has his name on it. I was actually 
here with him a few years ago, working on a script, when the big earthquake 
hit, and we went out on the balcony to watch the fires." 
</P>
<P>
He fell silent for a moment. "It's pretty incredible, being here," he said, 
wagging his head in disbelief. "It's funny how things can change, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
Incredible is the word. 
</P>
<P>
After a 20-year struggle, the 47-year-old screenwriter has finally made his 
mark on the movie business. Ten years ago, Rubin was living in Indiana, writing 
industrial films. When he moved to Hollywood in the mid-'80s, he was so broke 
that after he finished a six-hour story meeting, he had to borrow money from a 
production executive to get his car out of the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Rubin is riding the wave, basking in the heat that radiates from 
Hollywood's favorite commodity: a hit movie. Rubin wrote this year's big 
success, "Ghost," which has grossed more than $176 million. He recently did a 
rewrite of "Sleeping With the Enemy," an upcoming Fox film starring Julia 
Roberts. Now he is holed up at the Chateau, doing rewrites on a Goldie Hawn 
project. 
</P>
<P>
But what really has people buzzing is Rubin's new film, "Jacob's Ladder." 
Directed by Adrian Lyne, who made "Flashdance" and "Fatal Attraction," the 
movie is a cinematic shocker -- a tumultuous drama with the thrills of a 
two-hour ride on Space Mountain and the terror of a bad acid trip. 
</P>
<P>
The film, which opens Friday, stars Tim Robbins as Jacob Singer, a Vietnam War 
vet whose world is coming apart at the seams. Besieged by nightmarish 
hallucinations, pursued by Army thugs and hideous demons, he is a man 
apparently caught in a dark passage between reality and illusion. 
</P>
<P>
Or is he? The film's surprise ending packs such a jolt that most audiences 
leave the theater completely baffled, hotly debating the merits -- not to 
mention the meaning -- of the denouement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really two movies for the price of one, isn't it?," says Lyne, who says 
he passed up directing "Bonfire of the Vanities" to make "Jacob's Ladder." 
"We've had preview audiences who were supposed to discuss the film for a 
half-hour, and they've ended up staying for 90 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Tri-Star Pictures faces a serious marketing challenge with a picture that is 
both a psychological drama and a horrific thriller and the studio, after some 
consideration, declined to discuss the film at all. One thing is certain: Many 
moviegoers -- and critics -- will be upset about the ambiguous nature of the 
film's finale. But don't expect any apologies from Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
"Storytelling in 20th-Century America has become so predictable that we know 
how the stories will end before we start," Rubin says. "I think storytellers 
need to rediscover the value of surprise. This film won't be 100% satisfying 
for everybody. Obviously the ending makes you re-examine everything you've seen 
on the screen. But Jacob is on a journey, a spiritual quest, and to experience 
it, we have to go on the journey with him." 
</P>
<P>
Rubin is so guileless and unassuming that he can ruminate for hours about 
quests, gurus and metaphysical journeys without ever sounding like a wacko 
disciple of Alan Watts. Soft-spoken and professorial in appearance, Rubin is 
the antithesis of today's young hot-rod screenwriters. In fact, he happily 
confesses that he nearly flunked every screenwriting course he took. Rubin is 
more at home musing about 16th-Century art, quoting Aldous Huxley and marveling 
that his long-neglected script, largely based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead, 
is finally getting a big Hollywood send-off. 
</P>
<P>
If "Jacob's Ladder" finds an audience, Rubin feels it will be for much the same 
reasons that people have responded to "Ghost." "We're in a society where people 
are starving for spiritual nourishment," he says. "People often think that I'm 
obsessed with death. But I think I'm actually obsessed with life. It's just 
that life doesn't have its meaning unless you understand your own mortality. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to start listening to themselves. In our society today, you can go all 
day listening to radio or TV or your Walkman. We don't have enough quiet in the 
world. When I get into my car, I turn the radio off. When I come home, I turn 
the TV off. You need the quiet to hear yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Rubin flashed a sheepish grin. "Geez, I hope I'm not beginning to sound like 
Timothy Leary here." 
</P>
<P>
Rubin does share a certain kinship with Leary and other counterculture icons. 
After attending the New York University Film School in the early 1960s, in the 
same class with Martin Scorsese and Brian De Palma, Rubin headed off on a 
two-year journey, seeking inner peace. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt trapped -- I needed time for self-reflection," he says of a trip that 
took him from Turkey and Iran through Afghanistan and Nepal and on to Malaysia, 
Thailand and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
When he returned to the United States, he married and took a job as film 
curator at the Whitney Museum, overseeing its New American Filmmaker series. In 
the mid-1970s, he moved to Bloomington, Ind., where his wife took a doctorate 
in art education. 
</P>
<P>
Though he wrote a script that was eventually made into "Brainstorm" (with Rubin 
getting story credit), his chances of breaking into Hollywood seemed remote. "I 
lost faith lots of times," he says. "I was in Indiana and everyone I knew doing 
films was out in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm resilient. When Moses was wandering in the desert, he followed a 
pillar of smoke and a column of fire by night. And I kept following the pillar 
of smoke inside myself." 
</P>
<P>
When Rubin visited Hollywood, his old classmate, De Palma, offered more 
practical advice: If you want a movie career, move to Hollywood. Rubin had 
avoided Los Angeles before, keeping his distance after he graduated from film 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a complete fear of coming here," he says. "It wasn't just the emptiness 
of the place, which is changing, but the feeling that everything was so make it 
or break it. I really felt -- if I fail, what else would I do?" 
</P>
<P>
Before he moved to Los Angeles, Rubin wrote "Jacob's Ladder." When his wife 
asked him what he writing, Rubin simply told her, "I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
"It just came out of me and I tried to take it down as fast as I could. It was 
a terrifying experience. In a lot of ways, I was simply the first person to see 
the movie. I was in a completely different space. I remember when my kids would 
run in and say, 'Hey, Dad, it's dinner time,' I'd almost jump out of my chair. 
I was so far away." 
</P>
<P>
In Hollywood, "Jacob's Ladder" was praised -- to death. "Everybody told my 
agent 'We love it. What a great story, but no thanks,' " Rubin recalls. It was 
even featured in an American Film magazine story about Hollywood's 10-best 
unproduced screenplays. Finally, as a result of the 1988 Writers Guild strike, 
director Lyne read the script and took up the crusade. 
</P>
<P>
"It was this huge, incredibly descriptive document," Lyne says. "Bruce had 
really written a novel. I can imagine why it went unmade so long. It was 
incredibly intimidating. I spent a year just working on a way to film it." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Rubin praised Lyne's handling of the film, he acknowledges that 
they had a yearlong "raging debate" over how to depict his scripts' various 
demons and hallucinations. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a lot of arguing," Lyne says with a laugh. "What would start as an 
intellectual debate ended up as some almost down-on-the-ground fighting." 
</P>
<P>
Talk about a Hollywood odd couple. Rubin, who likes to quote Plato's last words 
("Practice dying"), is a man of the spirit. Lyne, the stylish director behind 
such heated sexual dramas as "Fatal Attraction" and "9 1/2 Weeks," is a man of 
the flesh. As Rubin says, Lyne gave him a crash course in Hollywood pragmatism. 
</P>
<P>
Poring over the script one day, Lyne came to a line which read: "The wall 
shatters and we see a vision of the abyss." He turned to Rubin and said, "OK, 
Bruce. How many carpenters do I need to build the abyss?" 
</P>
<P>
To find the appropriate images for the script's ominous apparitions, Lyne waded 
through stacks of photography books and magazines, searching for strikingly 
original images. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted images you hadn't seen before -- images you couldn't categorize right 
away," he says. "Bruce's descriptions were brilliant, but very literary. They 
would've seemed corny on screen. I needed something more tangible. Maybe Steven 
Spielberg could've shot them, but I was afraid if I did it they'd look like 
some Liberace version of a light show." 
</P>
<P>
Lyne turned to his trick-bag of cinematic wizardry, shaking the camera and 
filming the movie's demonic apparitions at four frames per second, instead of 
the customary 24, to give them an unsettling, almost surreal sense of whirring 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
After preview audiences saw the film, Lyne trimmed more than 30 minutes out of 
the film, including one particularly garish scene showing a butcher cleaving a 
huge, bloody chunk of meat. "It was just too-ugh-too awful!" Lyne groans. 
"Sometimes it's what you don't show that's most effective. You let the 
audiences' imagination provide the terror." 
</P>
<P>
Lyne relied as much on his emotions as his technique. One scene in the script 
featured a spectacular stairway to heaven, complete with angels and sunbeams. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it would be doomed to failure -- I could never show enough sunbeams," 
he says. "So I shot the scene showing a father and his child together, almost 
as a family reunion. Maybe the idea came from my own feelings about being 
reunited with my father, who died 15 years ago. He didn't like me much, and I 
didn't like him much. But I've always hoped that if we ever had a second time 
around, maybe we'd make our peace with each other." 
</P>
<P>
"Jacob's Ladder" is full of that sense of spirit and passion. As Rubin puts it, 
it's a raging war about a soul trying to make peace with itself. Having finally 
seen his work reach the screen, Rubin identifies with the film's eerie, 
dream-like vision. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been extraordinary to finally achieve this. Success is a really dreamlike 
experience. And because it's so dreamlike, you know it's temporary. It's not a 
dream that lasts forever." 
</P>
<P>
A thin smile spread across Rubin's face as he stared out of the window of his 
penthouse suite. "So I guess right now I'm just living out a fulfillment 
dream."

<P>
In a nationwide competition in which 35 theaters proposed entries for the 
funding of new plays, two San Diego theaters have been awarded two of the three 
grants for new plays provided by a major corporate sponsor, AT&amp;T officials 
announced Monday at press conferences in New York and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla Playhouse gets $40,000 and the Old Globe Theatre $50,000 and both 
theaters will be provided a national publicity campaign, paid for by AT&amp;T, 
as part of the year-old "AT&amp;T New Plays for the Nineties Project." 
</P>
<P>
The Mark Taper Forum and the Los Angeles Theatre Center were among those 
invited to compete, but neither received grants. 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla Playhouse's winning project was "The Heliotrope Bouquet by Scott 
Joplin and Louis Chauvin," a new Eric Overmyer play about ragtime artists 
Joplin and Chauvin. The Center Stage in Baltimore also received $40,000 to 
produce the play. Stan Wojewodski Jr., artistic director of the Center Stage in 
Baltimore, will stage the show in Baltimore in February and at the Playhouse in 
August. It is planned in La Jolla for the new 400-seat Mandell Weiss Forum 
currently under construction. 
</P>
<P>
Lillian Garrett's "The White Rose," based on the true story of German students 
protesting the policies of Adolf Hitler during the Nazi era, will have its 
world premiere at the Old Globe on Jan. 17. Craig Noel, executive director of 
the theater, will direct the show in its 581-seat mainstage. 
</P>
<P>
The third play, "Back to the Blanket," by Gary Leon Hill, examines the effect 
of the 1890 massacre of American Indians at Wounded Knee, S.D., on four people. 
It will be presented at the Denver Center Theatre Company beginning May 17. 
</P>
<P>
Three new adaptations of classical plays will also be supported under 
AT&amp;T's 5-year-old OnStage Classics series: 
</P>
<P>
* Henrik Ibsen's "When We Dead Awaken," adapted by Robert Brustein and designed 
and directed by Robert Wilson, at the American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge, 
Mass. (February), and at Houston's Alley Theatre (May). 
</P>
<P>
* A modern music-theater version of Shakespeare's "The Winter's Tale," adapted 
by the Cornerstone Theatre Company, that will tour 12 states and the District 
of Columbia in the summer and fall. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Three men were shot to death and one other was critically wounded late Monday 
night outside a sprawling Santa Ana apartment complex that authorities say is 
known for violence and drug dealing. 
</P>
<P>
A man believed to be the lone gunman was spotted by witnesses running north on 
Sullivan Street shortly after the 10 p.m. shooting, Police Sgt. Joseph Esther 
said. However, no one was in custody by early today. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the dead men were found near a bank of pay telephones on the grounds of 
the Fairview Villas apartment complex, which spans several blocks between 
Sullivan and Fairview streets, just north of McFadden Avenue. The third body 
was found less than 75 yards away, Esther said. 
</P>
<P>
The victims had not been positively identified by early this morning, but all 
three were described as being in their middle to late 20s, leading 
investigators to speculate that the shootings may not have been gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
The wounded man was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where he was being 
treated in the emergency trauma center, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Esther said the man, apparently an innocent bystander from Garden Grove, was 
found in a red compact car in the driveway of the complex entrance on Sullivan 
Street. His name was not immediately released. 
</P>
<P>
Initial investigation at the murder scene suggested that only one handgun was 
used. 
</P>
<P>
Fabiola Romero, a resident at the apartment complex, said she was awakened in 
her second-story bedroom by the gunshots. The 17-year-old said she ordered her 
niece and two nephews, who had been asleep in the next bed, to get on the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
"I just told everyone to get down," she said. 
</P>
<P>
When the gunshots finally ceased, Romero said, she crept to the bedroom window 
and saw two men lying near the pay phones at the end of her building. She 
looked over and saw a third body near an adjacent building, then saw a neighbor 
appear and shout for help. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents said they did not know the dead men. However, police said it 
appears that two of the men were residents of the complex and the third man 
lived nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Gonzales, who was riding his bicycle about 150 yards from the scene, 
said he heard three gunshots, followed by a minute of silence. The 20-year-old, 
who lives a few blocks from the apartment complex, said he then heard another 
nine or so shots. "It went prat prat prat, over and over again," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the most violent neighborhoods around here," said Ron Castro, a 
Santa Ana Fire Department battalion commander at the shooting scene. As he 
spoke, a burst of what seemed to be gunfire could be heard in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
"There are one to two shootings a week, three to four assaults, four to five 
stabbings. And that may be on a slow week," Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
A two-square-mile area surrounding the apartment complex is home to anywhere 
from seven to 11 youth gangs, Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not going to end," Castro said of Monday night's eruption of violence. 
"Just look around you," he added, pointing to the dozens of people gathered 
outside the complex. "All you see is poverty and despair." 
</P>
<P>
The murder suspect, described only as being in his early to mid-20s, entered 
the complex on foot and opened fire with a semiautomatic handgun on a group of 
four or five men standing by the bank of phones, Santa Ana Police Lt. Robert 
Helton said. He fired between 10 and 15 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Police, who were summoned by security guards, apparently passed the possible 
suspect as they sped south on Sullivan Street. 
</P>
<P>
A woman believed to be the wife of one of the dead men arrived on the scene 
shortly before 11 p.m., and was told that her husband had been shot. 
Authorities said she fainted when she saw her husband's body, and was taken to 
a nearby hospital for treatment. Her name was not released. 
</P>
<P>
Fairview Villas is a massive concrete-and-stucco village of hundreds of 
apartments contained in two-story buildings and surrounded by concrete block 
walls. The people living in the complex are predominantly Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials said the surrounding neighborhood is a rough, densely 
populated and ethnically mixed area known for muggings and violence associated 
with both gangs and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had narcotics dealing here in the past," Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors speculated that the shooting was related to drug dealing. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is drugs," said Manuel Gomez, a 20-year-old who lives across the 
street from the Fairview Villas. "Some people sell drugs over there. It's been 
going on for years." 
</P>
<P>
Security gates were installed recently, apparently an effort by apartment 
security to stem unwanted traffic into the complex, neighbors said. But the 
gates have failed to curb drug activity, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's drugs and more drugs -- nothing has changed," Gomez said.

OOPS: The Laguna Beach Taxpayer's Assn. opposes a tax to buy and preserve 
undeveloped Laguna Canyon, so why is it contributing to the Save the Canyon 
fund? Answer: It didn't know it was. . . . All the group did was take out ads 
in the weekly Coast Line News. But the newspaper has pledged to donate 10% of 
its display ad revenue in September, October and November for canyon 
preservation in the name of each advertiser. . . . "It's their money now," 
shrugs taxpayer's vice president Art Casebeer. "They can do what they want with

SUIT COULD RESTORE DRIVER TRAINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huntington Beach Union High School District officials have said they sympathize 
with parents in the district who want to restore hands-on driver training in 
high schools, which fell victim to budget cuts in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
But they also told the parents that the best hope for restoring the program to 
all California schools is a legal suit brought by a Monterey County school 
district that is scheduled to be heard Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a group of parents urged a meeting of district trustees to allow a 
nonprofit organization to raise money to restore driver training. 
</P>
<P>
Schools still have state money for in-class instruction, called "driver 
education." But the laboratory for such classes, called "driver training," was 
not funded this year by the state budget. Parents say driver instruction is 
incomplete without behind-the-wheel experience. 
</P>
<P>
But Dick Plum, coordinator of alternative education in the district, told 
parents that the legal case in Monterey County could solve the issue for all 
school districts. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas Union High School District in Monterey County is legally challenging 
the state's cutbacks because state law earmarks a portion of some traffic fines 
solely for the use of driver training in high schools. The school district 
questions the legality of using driver-training money for other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"If the court rules in favor of the schools, it's a simple matter," Plum said. 
"All the high schools in the state will get their money back, and we can 
reinstate driving training." 
</P>
<P>
Plum said that about 3,000 students in the district are enrolled in driver 
education. The district lost $363,000 in state funds when the current budget 
excised money for driver training. BILL BILLITER

FIRETRUCK MISUSED, COUNCILMAN CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A councilman is charging the firefighters association with improperly using an 
antique firetruck for political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Daniel E. Griset said on Monday that a 1957 Ladder Truck sold to the 
Santa Ana Firemen's Benevolent Assn. earlier this year had carried campaign 
signs during visits to several local shopping centers last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Griset said the truck was to be used only for public education and parades and 
charged that the 200-member association may have "misrepresented its 
intentions" when buying the truck because members used it to promote the 
reelection campaigns of Mayor Daniel H. Young and Councilmen Ron May, Richards 
L. Norton and Miguel A. Pulido Jr. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Edward J. Cooper said the association "can't be using city property 
for promoting candidates or issues. I think it could be in violation of using 
public funds for private purposes, which is a constitutional issue." 
</P>
<P>
Art Del Gaudio, vice president of the association, said members didn't think 
they were doing anything wrong by posting the signs on the truck. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly didn't do anything intentionally," Del Gaudio said. "We don't do 
dirty politics. We support the people we feel are supportive of public safety." 
</P>
<P>
Del Gaudio said the association will be moving the truck, which is parked at a 
fire station at 1029 W. 17th St., from city property within 48 hours. GREG

SCHOOL RENOVATION PLANS CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHERYLANNE BEALER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of Laguna Beach High School parents is complaining that a 
multimillion-dollar renovation project at the school will benefit future 
generations at the expense of current students, who will have to bear noisy 
construction and attend classes in temporary quarters for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't just write off the current group of students in favor of a project 
that won't serve students until much later on," said Katherine Schenk, one of 
the parents who appeared before the Laguna Beach school board last week. 
</P>
<P>
The $7.2-million project, set to start in November, 1991, involves demolishing 
a 10-room building and replacing it with a large classroom complex on another 
part of the campus. 
</P>
<P>
Parents complained that the district has not made adequate arrangements to 
house students during the anticipated one to three years of construction. 
</P>
<P>
The group urged the district to delay demolishing the 10-room building until 
the new classroom is completed and to allow construction only during vacations 
and after school to reduce the effects of construction on students. 
</P>
<P>
But Supt. Dennis Smith said the parents' suggestions would push the project's 
cost up another 25% and stretch out construction for another year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
District officials have planned a one-step construction in which demolition, 
construction and renovation will occur simultaneously. By renovating in one 
step, the district can save $800,000 in construction costs and complete the 
project sooner than under a phased construction plan, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Students will attend classes in portable buildings and in unused classrooms on 
the south side of campus until construction is completed in 1993, Smith said, 
adding that a precise relocation plan will be revealed within the next two 
months. CHERYLANNE BEALER

<TEXT>
<P>
Incumbent Mayor Charles V. Smith has passed the $20,000 mark in campaign 
contributions, giving him $6,000 more than the two other mayoral candidates 
combined, mandatory political finance reports show. 
</P>
<P>
Smith leads the pack with $20,532 in contributions. 
</P>
<P>
He has spent $17,543 -- about three times as much as rival Frank G. Fry -- and 
has $1,961 remaining on hand. Fry has received $10,649 in contributions and has 
$7,327 on hand. Mayoral candidate Darryl DeGraw has received $3,448 in 
contributions, spent $2,440 and has $1,008 remaining, the reports show. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, City Council incumbent Anita Huseth has also pulled ahead in 
contributions received. After trailing council candidate Craig Schweisinger in 
September, she has raised $12,165; he has raised $8,536 in that period. 
Schweisinger has used up almost all of his contributions and has $170 on hand. 
And after spending $8,529, Huseth has $4,468 remaining. She has also received a 
new $4,000 loan from her husband, the documents show.JON NALICK

CHP COMPUTERS TO CHASE DOWN FACTS, HELP SPIT OUT TICKETS FAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A hand-held computer that eventually will allow police to print out traffic 
tickets instantly and allow speeding motorists to pay fines with credit cards 
was unveiled by the California Highway Patrol Monday in a ceremony atop the 
Conejo Grade. 
</P>
<P>
Under a $60,000 project in Ventura County that is hailed as the nation's first, 
the CHP has equipped officers with 12 computers and portable printers to cut 
down on the time and paperwork required to process handwritten tickets. 
</P>
<P>
The computers, measuring nearly 7 inches in length, can list a driver's hair 
and eye color and vehicle type with a punch of a few keys, said officials who 
demonstrated the equipment at the Conejo Commercial Vehicle Inspection Facility 
on the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
And when the Department of Motor Vehicles issues magnetic licenses in December, 
law enforcement officials hope to use the computer to tap into the National 
Crime Information Center and obtain records of prior arrests and outstanding 
warrants. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County was selected for the initial project because of lobbying by 
county court officials, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the DMV's Oxnard office will be among the first in the state to 
issue licenses with a magnetic strip on the back. Officers will be able to run 
the license through the computer to obtain background information that now must 
be retrieved through a dispatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Within five years, the computer should be able to accept credit cards from 
motorists who decide to post bail without leaving their cars, Lt. Claude LeMond 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Area law enforcement leaders -- including the captain and chief of the Ventura 
and Simi Valley police departments -- said they are closely watching the 
project and anticipate the equipment will be used in the future to document 
other misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually I would think the technology would be available to issue all 
citations," Capt. Randy Adams of the Ventura Police Department said. 
</P>
<P>
If the program proves successful in the next 12 months, the CHP plans to 
implement automated ticketing throughout California within three years, CHP 
Commissioner Maury Hannigan said. 
</P>
<P>
"The 21st Century is less than 10 years away and law enforcement needs to take 
advantage of technological advances if it is to keep pace with today's world," 
Hannigan said. 
</P>
<P>
It now takes one week to a month for cited motorists to receive a courtesy 
notice regarding their fines because tickets are physically transported to the 
court and then typed into a computer, said Sheila Gonzalez, executive officer 
of the Ventura County Superior and Municipal courts. The courts receive about 
6,500 tickets a month, she said, and many are sloppily written or contain 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
With the computers, violators will be able to have information about their 
fines within 24 hours, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our belief that this will become an absolute way of doing business," 
Gonzalez said. "I think eventually all information will be transferred 
electronically." 
</P>
<P>
The magnetic licenses will save time because the photographs will be digitally 
stored on a computer, said Bill Gengler, spokesman for the department's 
Sacramento bureau. 
</P>
<P>
"That process will make it very easy for people to get a duplicate license if 
they've lost a license," Gengler said. "It will keep a million people out of 
our offices each year."

TRANSPORTATION: SIMI VALLEY RESIDENTS TRY OUT THE SECOND DAILY TRAIN SERVING 
VENTURA AND SANTA BARBARA COUNTIES.

<P>
The last time Simi Valley resident Amber Lievens rode on a train was in 1943, 
when she came to Los Angeles from Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the 69-year-old got a chance to relive that experience when she 
joined about 25 other Simi Valley residents, city and state officials on the 
inaugural ride of Amtrak's second daily San Diegan train serving Ventura and 
Santa Barbara counties. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a treat for me," Lievens said as she prepared to board the 
train in Simi Valley on its way to Santa Barbara. "I'm really looking forward 
to it." 
</P>
<P>
The new San Diegan service, which actually started Sunday, brings a second 
round-trip train between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, with stops in Simi 
Valley and Oxnard. The number of trains between Los Angeles and San Diego will 
not be increased in the new schedule. 
</P>

"I think it's great," said Simi Valley resident Ken Garges, who was also riding 
the train Monday. "I've been a rail fan all my life." 
</P>
<P>
Garges, 75, said the new run will enable area residents to catch a morning 
train to Santa Barbara, where they can spend the day shopping or sightseeing 
before returning in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton, City Council members Vicky Howard and Bill 
Davis, and Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) were among officials who 
spoke at a brief ceremony in Simi Valley to commemorate the new San Diegan 
line. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased to have this new service added," Stratton said. "The city 
of Simi Valley has been very aggressive in supporting train service." 
</P>
<P>
Howard agreed, saying, "When you have a second train come, you know it's really 
working for the folks and they're using it." 
</P>
<P>
The additional northbound train will stop in Simi Valley at 9:30 a.m. and in 
Oxnard at 10 a.m., arriving in Santa Barbara at 10:55 a.m. The original 
northbound train stops in Simi Valley at 9:05 p.m., Oxnard at 9:35 p.m. and 
Santa Barbara at 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The new southbound San Diegan will leave Santa Barbara at 3:25 p.m., stopping 
in Oxnard at 4:10 p.m. and Simi Valley at 4:40 p.m. The train will arrive in 
Los Angeles at 6:20 p.m. and San Diego at 9:05 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The original southbound train leaves Santa Barbara at 7:50 a.m., stopping in 
Oxnard at 8:35 a.m. and Simi Valley at 9:05 a.m. It arrives in Los Angeles at 
10:30 a.m. and in San Diego at 1:37 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak's San Diegan, which operates eight daily round trips between San Diego 
and Los Angeles, first extended service to Santa Barbara in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1989-90 fiscal year, Caltrans and Amtrak officials said, 52,470 
passengers rode the southbound train segment between Santa Barbara and Los 
Angeles, while 47,253 passengers rode the northbound train. 
</P>
<P>
A special promotional fare is being offered on the Santa Barbara to San Diego 
line until April 30. 
</P>
<P>
The one-way Santa Barbara-San Diego fare is $29.50. During the promotion, a 
one-day, round-trip fare will be $30.50 and a round trip completed in more than 
one day will be $36.50. 
</P>
<P>
A special reduced rate is also being offered during the same time period on the 
Santa Barbara to Los Angeles route. A same-day round-trip ticket will cost $19, 
while round trips not completed the same day will run $25. The normal one-way 
fare is $18.

MCCLINTOCK USES HIGH-TECH OFFENSE IN REELECTION BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Republican Assemblyman Tom McClintock considers his new, $35,000 computer the 
centerpiece of his reelection campaign. He pays college students $5 an hour to 
telephone Republican supporters identified by the computer and urge them to 
vote on Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic challenger Ginny Connell puts her election hopes in a mushrooming 
group of volunteers who hand-carry brochures to voters' doors, hand-address 
envelopes destined for absentee voters and work the phones. 
</P>
<P>
The divergent campaigns -- one high-tech and well financed, the other 
grass-roots and cash poor -- reflect the striking differences between the two 
candidates themselves. 
</P>
<P>
McClintock is an eight-year incumbent from Thousand Oaks who relishes 
criticizing Democrats and even Republicans for failing his conservative cause 
to slash government spending and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Connell, a former nun, is a soft-spoken family therapist in Thousand Oaks who 
said she is astounded at McClintock's attacks on those who don't share his 
conservative views. Moreover, she said, she is appalled at his opposition to 
state-financed abortions and virtually every Democratic plan to protect the 
environment or improve education. 
</P>
<P>
Initially written off as the Democrats' sacrificial lamb, Connell has impressed 
many party leaders with a spirited campaign that has attracted more than 100 
volunteers. But her campaign is still a long shot in the 36th Assembly 
District, where 51% of voters are registered as Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had some luck with these campaigns called, 'A snowball's chance in hell,' 
" said Mary Rose, a political consultant to Connell's campaign. Rose said she 
still thinks Connell has a chance at an upset victory. 
</P>
<P>
Connell, chairwoman of the Ventura County Democratic Party, said her decision 
to run against McClintock was galvanized by McClintock's refusal to reconsider 
voting for state-financed family planning clinics that provide abortions. 
</P>
<P>
"He's anti-abortion and has a very poor record of supporting the schools, clean 
air and the environment," said Connell, who has won the support of most women's 
and environmental groups, such as the Sierra Club and the National Organization 
for Women. "He's out of touch with the voters." 
</P>
<P>
McClintock said he does not seek to ban abortions, but he strongly opposes 
public financing of the procedure. He suggests that Connell has the wrong issue 
in the Republican-majority district. 
</P>
<P>
"Her position that taxpayers' funds should be used to support and finance 
abortion is out of step with the vast majority of constituents in the 
district," McClintock said. 
</P>
<P>
Connell, who acknowledges that her campaign got off to a slow start, has had 
difficulty raising significant political contributions. Through September, 
Connell had raised about $22,000 but was left with $6,660 in cash available for 
printing brochures and a planned mass mailing to voters. 
</P>
<P>
But Rose, a veteran Democratic strategist in Ventura and Santa Barbara 
counties, said the number and quality of Connell's volunteers has compensated 
for her campaign's lack of cash. Upon Rose's advice, Connell has taken the 
campaign to the streets, walking precincts with volunteers every weekend and 
most evenings. 
</P>
<P>
Marlene Head, Connell's volunteer coordinator, calculates that the campaign has 
between 100 and 130 volunteers, many of them elderly residents of Leisure 
Village in Camarillo. Others come from the Democratic Party, area chapters of 
the National Organization for Women and other women's groups. "It's been 
amazing the outpouring of support," Head said. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, McClintock's campaign raised about $140,000 through September, not 
including some contributions that trickled in from a fund-raising luncheon in 
Ventura that featured Oliver North as the guest speaker. 
</P>
<P>
McClintock said he has not walked any precincts, nor does he plan to. Instead, 
he said, hired college students and a handful of volunteers have kept a close 
watch on the electorate by calling voters randomly selected by computer. He 
said the results of his random survey show him doing "very well." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said, he has about $55,000 available to spend on any effort 
needed to secure his position in the district that stretches across the county 
from Thousand Oaks to Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
McClintock declines to say if he will send a mass mailing to voters. But he 
said his campaign is equipped with a state-of-the-art computer that gives it 
tremendous flexibility to respond to mailers from his opponent. In June, he 
decided to dispatch a brochure to Republican voters in the final days of the 
primary campaign. "That computer allowed us to general a piece within 48 
hours," McClintock said. 
</P>
<P>
David A. Harner, a technologist at Damon Reference Laboratory in Newbury Park, 
is also on the ballot as a candidate for the Libertarian Party. "I realize I 
have no chance of winning. I just hope to introduce the public to some ideas," 
he said, such as dramatically scaling back the role of government. 
</P>
<P>
Harner said he agrees with McClintock on most issues. "He is more 
Libertarian-esque than most Republicans, but he is still a Republican."

U.S. STUDY NEUTRAL ON HOPE DEAL; 
</P>
<P>
JORDAN RANCH: A LARGE PARCEL WOULD BE ALLOCATED FOR PUBLIC USE BUT 59 ACRES 
WOULD BE AFFECTED, A DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A long-awaited federal report released Monday says that the proposed exchange 
of national parkland in Agoura for adjacent lands owned by entertainer Bob Hope 
would cause "direct unavoidable adverse . . . impacts" to the 59 acres of 
parkland, but preserve a much bigger swath of private land for public 
recreational use. 
</P>
<P>
The draft environmental impact statement (EIS) by the National Park Service 
neither endorses nor opposes the land swap, which would provide road access to 
the sprawling housing and golf course project planned for Hope's Jordan Ranch 
property in eastern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Park Service officials, criticized in the past for supporting the exchange 
before performing environmental reviews, have been officially neutral in recent 
months. David Gackenbach, superintendent of the Santa Monica Mountains National 
Recreation Area, a unit of the Park Service, said Monday that the agency will 
take a position on the exchange in the final environmental statement, to be 
issued next year after a 90-day public comment period. 
</P>
<P>
But Gackenbach acknowledged that a federal decision could well be rendered moot 
by political developments in Ventura County, which has authority over the 
Jordan Ranch proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Three county supervisors and a supervisor-elect are on record against the plan 
for 750 homes and a championship golf course on Jordan Ranch, which Potomac 
Investment Associates has optioned from Hope. The project is expected to come 
before the supervisors for a vote sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
If they insist on a much smaller development, the developers may not need the 
access road and may withdraw their offer of the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing the worst from Ventura County, Hope has been trying to persuade the 
city of Simi Valley to annex the Jordan Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for a year and a half, the environmental report only focuses on 
the exchange of 59 acres of Park Service land in Cheeseboro Canyon for 864 
acres of Palo Comado Canyon, which is part of the 2,308-acre Jordan Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, as the document noted, Hope earlier this year significantly sweetened 
the offer in an attempt to win over critics of the Jordan Ranch proposal. 
</P>
<P>
As it now stands, Hope's offer includes the donation of an additional 325 acres 
on and near the Jordan Ranch to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, a state 
parks agency. He has also agreed to down-size the access road from four lanes 
to two and tunnel through some hillsides rather than flatten them. The access 
road would slice the edge off the 2,150-acre Cheeseboro Canyon unit of the 
national recreation area. 
</P>
<P>
Hope also agreed to transfer to the conservancy the 4,369-acre Runkle Ranch in 
the Santa Susana Mountains for a below-market $10 million, and to donate about 
170 acres of his Corral Canyon property in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
All of these inducements are contingent on approval of the land exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the exchange, including some environmentalists and Agoura-area 
homeowner groups, have criticized the Park Service for even considering 
altering park boundaries to accommodate private development. They argue that 
the Park Service would be triggering development of a property -- the Jordan 
Ranch -- which existing Park Service plans state should be acquired for public 
land. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the deal, including some environmentalists and the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy, say it would provide a windfall of public lands that 
could never be assembled with tax dollars because of exorbitant land costs. 
</P>
<P>
Gackenbach said the Park Service will probably hold a public meeting on the 
environmental report between now and Jan. 31, the deadline for submission of 
comments. Copies of the draft environmental report are available at several 
libraries in eastern Ventura County and the west San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The draft report said that if the land exchange takes place and the access road 
is built, the oak-dotted, 59-acre tract would no longer be available for public 
recreation. The road would be visible from some areas of the Cheeseboro Canyon 
preserve. The Park Service could insist on deed restrictions barring 
development of the 59 acres beyond the two-lane road, but the property would 
still be degraded, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the document said, the deal offers "possible benefits" to 
the "Park Service and other public agencies," in that development of a much 
larger area would be foreclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The report analyzed several road access alternatives for the Jordan Ranch 
project should the Park Service kill the exchange. Each of the alternative 
roads would go through the city of Agoura Hills or unincorporated Oak Park, and 
face strong political resistance or difficult terrain, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
It's "probably correct" that none of the road alternatives in the document is 
good, conceded Fred Maas, vice president of Potomac Investment. However, he 
said, some alternatives weren't analyzed, including construction of a road to 
Jordan Ranch from Simi Valley, should the city decide to annex the tract. 
</P>
<P>
Because the narrowly focused document does not assess the impacts of the big 
Jordan Ranch development, it is sure to be loudly criticized by opponents of 
the exchange, who could not be reached for comment late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
David Brown, chairman of the Sierra Club's Santa Monica Mountains Task Force, 
which conditionally supports the exchange, criticized the report as too 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
"You need to assess the impact of the use to which the property is going to be 
put," Brown said. "If you're going to privatize a piece of parkland, the EIS 
needs to include how the proposed use is going to affect" the surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
If that "is not covered, then we have a defective document," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not legally defective," said Gackenbach, adding that Park Service lawyers 
had reviewed and approved the scope of the study. 
</P>
<P>
A separate draft report on the impacts of the Jordan Ranch development was 
issued late in August by Ventura County.

LIBRARY ADVOCATES TURN UP THE VOLUME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The tiny Moorpark Library fills up in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"After school, every table is filled, with children sitting on the floor," 
Librarian Mary Crockford said. 
</P>
<P>
During the summer, a reading program for youngsters brought in 485 children. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to have the programs here," Crockford said, "except it takes up the 
whole library. One event had 175 children plus parents." 
</P>
<P>
A consultant hired last year by Ventura County Library Services recommended 
that the library be quadrupled in size. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1980 the population of Moorpark has grown from 4,000 to about 26,000 
residents, and a bigger library is needed, a report done by Raymond Holt &amp; 
Associates of Del Mar said. 
</P>
<P>
The 5,000-square-foot building serves all segments of the community and lends 
5,000 to 6,000 books a month, Crockford said. 
</P>
<P>
The consultant concluded that Moorpark needs a library of about 20,000 square 
feet with three acres to expand even more. The report also recommends the 
expansion of the book collection and a greater range of library services with 
emphasis on children. 
</P>
<P>
Originally the library was in a small store on the city's main street. In 1981, 
a 2,500-square-foot library was built close to the Moorpark Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
By 1985, the size was doubled with funding from a government grant, and the 
library's collection reached 25,000 books. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have enough resources for the size of our community," Crockford said. 
"People have to use the Thousand Oaks library instead of our library for 
technical research. But I feel we are still able to do a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Building a new library would cost an estimated $3 million, not including the 
site, she said. "There is not enough room on this site. The consultant does not 
feel this building would be easy to enlarge." 
</P>
<P>
Crockford hopes that there may be a land swap with the city of Moorpark, with 
the city taking the current library building and the library getting a piece of 
downtown property. City and county officials have discussed the possibility, 
she said, but talks are in a preliminary stage. 
</P>
<P>
The Moorpark Friends of the Library has raised $2,500 toward a new building 
through cookbook sales and a booth at Moorpark's annual County Days 
festivities. 
</P>
<P>
"The more we earn, the more we will let people know we are serious about trying 
to raise money for a future library," said Martha Lepine, spokeswoman for the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
The group is planning a murder-mystery night called "Murder in the Library" 
next spring. GERRY BRAILO SPENCER

<P>
A Thousand Oaks developer is spending $20,020 to back four City Council 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Businessman Don Mallas spent the money to distribute and mail a publication, 
the Thousand Oaks Clarion, to registered voters. The publication encourages 
citizens to vote for Patricia Halfhill, Bob Hughes, Michael Markey and Elois 
Zeanah on Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
The four candidates have promised to put environmental and growth issues at the 
top of their platforms and to oppose a city plan to build a new government 
center at the Jungleland site. 
</P>
<P>
The endorsements came as nine contenders entered the last week of campaigning 
in a race centered on the effect of growth on the city of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
There are three open seats on the City Council. Councilman Tony Lamb has chosen 
not to seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Candidate Ray Grams criticized Halfhill, Hughes and Markey for each accepting 
$500 contributions from the developer while pledging to take a tough stance on 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's spending so much money, it looks to me like he's trying to buy three 
council seats," Grams said. 
</P>
<P>
Markey denied that the developer's contribution would have an effect on his 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not for sale," Markey said. "That's not going to sway my vote in any 
direction for anybody. I represent the entire community." 
</P>
<P>
The other candidates could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates are spending substantially more on average than others have in past 
years to run for office, according to statements filed last week with the city 
clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Markey, a Compton police detective from Newbury Park, has raised the largest 
campaign fund of the candidates. His fund of $10,555 is almost all out of his 
own pocket, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two incumbents running to retain their seats, Alex Fiore and Lawrence Horner, 
and two other candidates also raised substantial amounts of money for their 
campaigns. Fiore reported $7,368, while Horner raised $4,048. 
</P>
<P>
City Planning Commissioner Judy Lazar has raised $7,322. 
</P>
<P>
Zeanah, who heads the Conejo League of Homeowners, reported $6,454. She also 
received $1,000 late last week from Patagonia Inc., a Ventura clothing company 
that has supported slow-growth candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Robert O'Brien, a former city building director, has raised $4,378. 
</P>
<P>
Halfhill, an investigator for attorneys, reported raising $2,576. Hughes, a 
former radio station director, raised $1,940. 
</P>
<P>
Grams said he did not file an itemized contribution report because he does not 
expect to raise more than $1,000 in his campaign. PSYCHE PASCUAL

Intent on averting a mistrial in the longest criminal trial in county history, 
a judge refused to dismiss 12 jurors Monday without a verdict in the 
triple-murder case of former Hessian motorcycle-gang leader Thomas F. 
Maniscalco. 
</P>

And so, as relatives of the defendant, lawyers, reporters and photographers

<P>
And for a 23rd day, the jury went home without a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
A verdict is not likely to come soon, lawyers acknowledged. After being 
instructed to continue discussions in hopes of overcoming their apparent 
deadlock, jurors on Monday asked that a court reporter read them the testimony 
of two witnesses. That could take three days to complete. 
</P>
<P>
The panel reported last Thursday that they had "exhausted all reasonable 
avenues for agreement." Superior Court Judge Kathleen E. O'Leary made the 
deadlock public on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
She could have declared a mistrial then. But that would have probably meant 
that the case -- which has already cost millions and kept the 45-year-old 
Maniscalco in jail for 6 1/2 years without bail -- would have been retried. 
</P>
<P>
Monday morning, for the first time in the drawn-out deliberations, defense 
attorney Andrew Roth asked for a mistrial because of the deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
Maniscalco faces the death penalty if convicted on three counts of murder. He 
allegedly orchestrated the killings of three people in Westminster on Memorial 
Day weekend, 1980, in a feud over drugs and counterfeit money. ERIC LICHTLBLAU

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: RIDERSHIP UP FOR 6-MONTH-OLD TRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Six months old today, Orange County's commuter train is carrying 61% more 
passengers per day than when service started and reached a one-day, record high 
of 302 riders last Wednesday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Using double-decked passenger coaches obtained from Caltrans, the County 
Transportation Commission's commuter service has one train operating daily in 
each direction between stops in Orange County and downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
OCTC officials on Monday called the six-month start-up period a success. 
</P>
<P>
"The first commuter train has been a strong performer," said OCTC Chairman Dana 
W. Reed, a Corona del Mar lawyer and political consultant. 
</P>
<P>
OCTC is funding the rail service and contracts with Amtrak, which operates the 
train. The cost is about $1.5 million per year, with ticket sales covering 
about 40% of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of rail service argue that the subsidies needed to pay for it would be 
better spent on new freeway construction. But rail supporters contend that it 
is too difficult environmentally and politically to build enough freeways to 
satisfy rush-hour demand. JEFFREY A. PERLMAN

<P>
MOTEL'S LAST TENANT HAS 5 DAYS TO MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Ventura County Superior Court Judge decided Monday to give the last tenant of 
the Lemon Tree Motel in Oxnard five days to vacate the building so the city can 
demolish the structure Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Bruce Thompson approved an order forcing Theresa Melendi, 
a cook, to leave her room at the Lemon Tree within five days or face forcible 
eviction by sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Peter M. Kuetzing an attorney for the city, said he asked Thompson for the 
order because Melendi has said several times that she would not leave the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Kuetzing said Melendi was notified in August that she had 90 days to leave the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old motel has been the center of controversy since the city 
acquired it in June through eminent domain proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
The city contends that the motel is the center of drug deals and prostitution 
and plans to demolish the aging building to make way for a parking lot. 
However, Bertha Ochoa, the motel's former owner, claims she has been the target 
of a conspiracy among city officials to throw her tenants into the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Mecky Meyers, who was hired by the city to relocate the tenants, said Melendi 
has refused the city's efforts to find her a new home. "She's closed all the 
doors herself," Meyers said. "The city tried through me in every way to reach 
the woman." 
</P>
<P>
However, Melendi said the city has refused to help her find a new home, and she 
insists that she was only told last week that she must leave the building. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kuetzing said the city is set to demolish the building Nov. 9, Ochoa 
said she is trying to raise funds to hire a lawyer to appeal the city's eminent 
domain order to a federal judge. HUGO MARTIN

ELECTIONS SCHOOL BOARD; 
</P>
<P>
DIFFERENT CHALLENGES EMERGE IN COUNTDOWN TO SCHOOL ELECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In nine school districts across Ventura County, challengers and incumbents will 
battle Nov. 6 in races that range from neighborly in a small district in Santa 
Paula to competitive in Simi Valley, where the county's biggest district has 
been hit hard by budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
Countywide, 18 incumbents are trying to keep their seats. The 35 challengers 
are hoping to make a difference for local schools. Many of the challengers are 
parents concerned about their children's education, particularly in light of 
state funding cuts to public education. 
</P>
<P>
Countywide issues are growth, crowded classrooms, bilingual education, the 
statewide school funding crisis and attracting and keeping good teachers. 
</P>
<P>
In the Oxnard Union High and Simi Valley Unified school districts, where new 
superintendents have recently been hired, the elections would mean further big 
changes if challengers prevail. Three seats are up for grabs on the Oxnard 
board, while two are available in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The balance of the board could also shift, with new members in the majority, in 
several other districts where three seats are open, including the Santa Paula 
Union High School District, Oxnard Elementary, Hueneme Elementary, Camarillo's 
Pleasant Valley Elementary and Ojai Unified. 
</P>
<P>
For different reasons, growth has been an issue in Camarillo's Pleasant Valley 
district and in the Simi Valley Unified district. 
</P>
<P>
The Pleasant Valley district is growing at about 150 students a year, mostly in 
eastern Camarillo. The board commissioned a study on new school needs for the 
next 20 years, but challengers have charged that the board waited too long to 
act. 
</P>
<P>
In Simi Valley, where an $8-million budget shortfall led to layoffs for 32 
temporary teachers and other cuts, the Simi Educators Assn. filed a grievance 
this month, charging that the number of students in 58 academic classes exceeds 
36, the district's upper limit for class size. 
</P>
<P>
Budget problems overshadow other issues in Simi Valley, where in addition to 
laying off teachers and other employees last July, officials reassigned some 
administrators to lower-level positions and cut instructional programs. 
</P>
<P>
Five candidates, including one incumbent, are battling for two seats in the 
18,000-student Simi Valley district. 
</P>
<P>
Carla Kurachi, a counselor, said the district needs to set a stricter 
attendance policy to stem a dropout rate of about 14%. She said she would 
encourage the district to write for more grants as a source of revenue. She 
favors establishing a community service requirement for graduation, encouraging 
students to volunteer in tutoring, working with seniors, graffiti removal or 
other areas. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Otto said the district should expand lobbying efforts in Sacramento to 
increase local funding. "With enough business interest and parent support, we 
can make changes happen and influence people in Sacramento," said Otto, a 
father of two who owns a local warehouse distribution business. "That's where 
our problems lie." 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Lewis (Lew) Roth, who is seeking his sixth term, cited his 
accomplishments as a board member, including starting town hall meetings to 
hear community concerns. He said the district should start its own job-training 
program instead of relying on a county-run program, which Roth said is 
inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
Challenger Douglas Crosse, a semi-retired owner of an alarm system business, 
said he has a long history of community service and would bring business 
expertise to the school board. Crosse has two children in Simi Valley schools. 
</P>
<P>
Karolyn J. Searight, said that if elected, she would concentrate on recruiting 
more teachers and examining the budget to see where operating cuts can be made. 
"We have to take a closer look to see where it can be trimmed," said Searight, 
a head bookkeeper for a printing company. She has two children in the district. 
</P>
<P>
Three positions are up for election on Santa Paula Union High School District 
board. Five candidates, including two incumbents, are vying for seats. Issues 
raised in the district, which has one regular school and a continuation school, 
are the high dropout rate and a high turnover among administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Challenger Robert J. Villa was assistant superintendent until the end of last 
school year, when his position was eliminated. Rather than accept a 
lower-ranking classroom position, Villa said, he chose to resign after 20 years 
with the district and is now unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
Villa, whose son attends Santa Paula High, said he decided to run for the board 
because "I felt I could continue to advocate for people I have advocated for 
all these years." He said hiring and keeping teachers and administrators is one 
of the district's biggest problems. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbents are Shirley Hendren, who is seeking her second term, and Donna 
Nelson, who has served on the board since 1975. Also running are challengers 
McKay Hendrix, an electrician, and Tana Ramirez, a newspaper district manager. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3,500-student Ojai Unified School District, where three seats are 
available, one challenger and three incumbents are seeking seats. 
</P>
<P>
Challenger Alan D. Fletcher said overcrowding is one of the biggest issues 
facing the district. Fletcher, who said he removed his daughter from an Ojai 
school because her classroom was overcrowded, said he would work to find ways 
to solve the problem, and would build a network for parents who want to 
volunteer in Ojai schools. 
</P>
<P>
The three Ojai incumbents are Robert Emhardt, who is seeking reelection to his 
third term, Vincent W. France, who began as a board member in 1979, and Muriel 
Sharkey Lavender, a board member since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
In the two-school, 300-student Briggs Elementary School District, five 
candidates, including one incumbent, are vying for three seats. As in past 
years, the campaign in the Santa Paula district has maintained a low-key, even 
friendly atmosphere, candidates said. 
</P>
<P>
Two Briggs challengers, Lloyd G. Simpson and Elizabeth Ikeda, are sending out a 
flyer together. Also seeking seats are incumbent Karen L. MacConell, who is 
running for a third term, and challengers Greg Patterson, a citrus ranch 
manager, and agricultural manager Jeff Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Growth is a major issue in the one-school Mesa Union Elementary School District 
in Somis, where enrollment has increased this year from 340 students to 363. 
Five candidates are running for three seats. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Patricia Fontes, a school administrator, is seeking a fourth term. 
The challengers are Fred J. Ferro, an industrial real estate agent; Ralph A. 
Marchioni, a corporate executive; Tomas Miranda, a youth supervisor; and 
Barbara Tweedy Patten, an educator.

MAN GETS 16 MONTHS FOR KILLING ANOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 20-year-old Irvine man who had pleaded guilty to killing a man on the 
roadways was ordered Monday to serve 16 months in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm grateful that he got prison time, but I think it should have been more," 
said 59-year-old Ruth Abel of Woodland Hills, the widow of the victim. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an insult to my husband's memory," she said. "It sends the wrong message 
to people, that you can act irresponsibly and not really have to pay for it. 
The whole thing is just such a terrible waste." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Schuler pleaded guilty to drunken vehicular manslaughter in a Sept. 13, 
1989, crash on Culver Drive in Irvine that killed Alan Abel, a 65-year-old 
management consultant. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the guilty plea, Schuler could have gone to prison for as long 
as four years or received only probation. 
</P>
<P>
Schuler had two misdemeanor convictions before the fatal crash, one for assault 
and battery, the other for possessing alcohol as a minor, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
And just a few weeks after his July guilty plea to manslaughter, he was 
arrested and later convicted of petty theft for trying to take beer from a 
grocery store. He also has been stopped several times for driving with a 
suspended license, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn said Schuler should be in state prison. "This is a kid who's already 
fallen out of two drug programs and has shown no desire to help himself," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Public defender Ronald Klar agreed that Schuler's drinking problem was "the 
most severe I've seen in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
"But he's so young . . . ," Klar said. "The serious drug and alcohol problems 
we have in our society take time to mend. We give athletes and public figures 
second chances -- even third and fourth -- and this kid should be treated no 
differently."ERIC LICHTBLAU

STEELERS' NOLL NOT EASILY IMPRESSED, EVEN IN 41-10 VICTORY

<TEXT>
<P>
The Steelers, by anyone's account, came through with a big victory Monday 
night. But you couldn't tell it by looking at Pittsburgh Coach Chuck Noll. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so we've come to expect a mask of indifference on the face of Noll, who has 
been a study in stoicism for 22 seasons as the Steelers' head coach. But you 
figure he would be dishing out a healthy portion of praise during his postgame 
press conference, right? 
</P>
<P>
Well, not exactly. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that was an outstanding effort all around," he said. "I think the 
thing that pleased me most about this was our defense keeping an offense like 
the Rams' off the scoreboard. No touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"But our position is we have to continue to win. We have to put a few together. 
We've been, 'win one, lose one, look like hell and come back and play like 
champs.' We've got to put a string of those playing-like-champs (games) 
together." 
</P>
<P>
So much for savoring a 41-10 victory. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to show off Pittsburgh in it's best light for a national 
television audience, the city staged a light-up night Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers were making their first appearance on Monday night football in 
four years, so all the buildings in the downtown area had their lights on. The 
weather cooperated as well, with a crystal clear evening heightening the 
sparkling effect. 
</P>
<P>
Spike like a man. Pittsburgh's Eric Green, who's 6-feet 5-inches and 274 
pounds, has been drawing rave reviews for his strength and quickness. And he 
showed off both attributes when he sprinted past Vince Newsome to catch a 
17-yard touchdown pass that lifted the Steelers to a 14-7 lead in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
After the catch, the rookie tight end slammed the ball in the end zone and it 
bounced about 30 feet straight up in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Steeler fans had reason to celebrate, too. It was Green's sixth touchdown in 
the last four games. In the five seasons before this one, Pittsburgh tight ends 
had a total of four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
It came before anyone could blink, almost faster than Gaston Green himself 
could imagine. He settled back to return the opening kickoff on the left side 
of the field, grabbed it on his hip right on the goal line, then saw the Grand 
Canyon open before him. 
</P>
<P>
The way he described it afterward, he just ran through the hole and it never 
closed. One hundred yards later, the Ram running back had a touchdown -- the 
Rams' first kickoff return for a score since Ron Brown did it against the 
Redskins in 1987 -- and staked his team to its last lead Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real big hole for me to run through," said Green, who added that he 
relishes any opportunity he has to touch the ball now that he's been made a 
reserve to starting tailback Cleveland Gary. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised it was so wide open," Green said of the hole. "And I just ran, 
pretty much was untouched, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
He guessed right. Before he broke through the last cluster of Steelers at about 
the Rams' 20-yard line, there was just one man to beat, and Green knew he had 
him beaten. 
</P>
<P>
"From there on, all I saw was the kicker (Gary Anderson), and I knew I had the 
touchdown," he said. Green easily blew past Anderson and cruised into the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive week, punter Keith English got trapped deep in Ram 
territory on a punt attempt when the protection broke down. 
</P>
<P>
This time, English, spotting Steeler safety Gary Jones popping through the line 
untouched, decided to hold the ball and be tackled rather than risk a kick that 
could have been blocked and returned for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson, however, didn't agree with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he should've gotten the ball off," Robinson said of the play that gave 
the Steelers the ball at the Rams' six-yard line in the third quarter. "I guess 
it's typical of the way we're playing." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson conceded there was a blocking breakdown on the right side of the line, 
but said he thought English reacted too quickly to avoid the penetration 
instead of trying to just kick the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a split-second decision," English said. "Turns out we were in bad field 
position anyway, so. . . . You make a split-second decision, you've got to live 
with them."

PREP FOOTBALL: HERALDS REPLACE THEIR POWERHOUSE BACKFIELD WITH DEFENSIVE END 
RON RECTOR AND LINEBACKER REX PRITCHARD.

<P>
When running backs Ron Papazian and Scott Jordan graduated from Whittier 
Christian High School last June, they took nearly 85% of the Heralds' scoring 
offense with them. 
</P>
<P>
Papazian, a fullback-linebacker, set the Orange County single-season scoring 
record last year with 35 touchdowns and 1,475 yards rushing. Jordan, a 
tailback, scored 12 touchdowns and ran for 1,360 yards. 
</P>
<P>
But Whittier Christian Coach Phil Bravo didn't panic when practice started this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
He knew the Heralds' running backs of the future were standing on the other 
side of the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
Bravo looked no further than defensive end and inside linebacker to find his 
new starting backfield. 
</P>
<P>
Filling Papazian's fullback position was defensive end Ron Rector, an 
aggressive, 5-foot-10, 170-pound senior with a Brian Bosworth 'do. 
</P>
<P>
Taking over at tailback was Rex Pritchard, a clean-cut, 5-9, 160-pound senior 
who was an all-Olympic League selection at linebacker last season. 
</P>
<P>
The newcomers have worked out nicely so far this year, rushing for a combined 
1,617 yards and 22 touchdowns while keeping the Heralds (7-0, 2-0) in the chase 
for their sixth league title in 10 years. They'll be in the backfield Saturday 
when Whittier Christian plays host to Orange Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
"We never rebuild," Bravo said. "We just reload. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone always says, 'This is the year, this time they're done because they 
don't have anyone coming back.' But we always have somebody step in." 
</P>
<P>
This year it's Rector, who has 817 yards and 15 touchdowns, and Pritchard, who 
has 800 yards and eight touchdowns. Rector averages 7.2 yards per carry and 
Pritchard averages 6.7 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I always said we would miss Papazian more defensively than we did 
offensively," Bravo said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Pritchard and Rector were expected to deliver this season. Big things 
are always expected from players at a small school (enrollment 700) with a 
winning football tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not as strong a running force as Ron and Scott were," Rector said. 
"There has been a ton of pressure on me to fill Ron's shoes. It's pretty hard." 
</P>
<P>
Said Pritchard: "There's not a lot of pressure, but I do think about what Scott 
did. I watched films of him during the summer. I really didn't expect to start 
this season." 
</P>
<P>
Rector had limited experience at fullback, rushing for 68 yards last year while 
backing up Papazian. 
</P>
<P>
But Pritchard had to learn his new position from scratch. As a junior, he had 
all but begged the coaches to let him play tailback, but they told him he was 
too slow. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran a 4.99-second 40-yard dash last year," Pritchard said. "I wanted to play 
offense pretty bad, so I worked in the weight room during the summer and worked 
on my speed." 
</P>
<P>
Pritchard ran the 40 in 4.68 seconds this fall. Bravo gave him the starting 
job. 
</P>
<P>
"I really want to get 1,000 yards this season," Pritchard said. 
</P>
<P>
Both players have found plenty of running room behind an offensive line that is 
considered one of the best in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"Even an average running back could come in and run well behind our line," said 
Tom Caffrey, the offensive line coach. 
</P>
<P>
Pritchard agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"You could drive a truck through some of the holes our line opens up," he said. 
"Our line just runs people over. All I have to do is get the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Pritchard and Rector have been getting the ball a lot this season. Pritchard 
averages 17 carries per game and Rector 16. 
</P>
<P>
And they have been getting the ball in important situations too. Three weeks 
ago, Whittier Christian was trailing Valley Christian, 28-7, early in the third 
quarter when the duo started grinding out the yards on four drives. 
</P>
<P>
The Heralds' second-half scoring: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pritchard, 24-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pritchard, five-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 -- David Whitby, four-yard pass from Nick Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rector, three-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Final score: Whittier Christian 33, Valley Christian 28. 
</P>
<P>
Rector's touchdown came with the Heralds trailing, 28-27, with 3 minutes 24 
seconds left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Heralds have a knack for playing catch-up this season. They've come back in 
the second half to win three of their seven games. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it takes a little slapping around to get us (ticked) off," Rector 
said. "That way we don't get all cocky." 
</P>
<P>
Pritchard and Rector have seen plenty of Whittier Christian comebacks in the 
last 10 years. They grew up watching their older brothers play for the Heralds. 
</P>
<P>
Pritchard's brother, Mike, played for the Heralds' Southern Section 
championship teams in 1984 and '85. Rector's brother, Randy, played for 
Whittier Christian's 9-3 team in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Rector lives in La Habra and could have gone to La Habra High School. Pritchard 
lives in Fullerton and could have gone to Sonora. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to play ball in the back of the end zone while my brother was 
practicing," Pritchard said. "Then, after practice, he would throw me the ball 
and tackle me. I always wanted to come here because of the football program." 
</P>
<P>
This will be Pritchard's last year of organized football. Rector is undecided 
about his future. 
</P>
<P>
But both have one goal in mind -- another league title and trip to the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We just have to keep ourselves psyched," Rector said. "We know that if we 
screw up once, we'll lose it."

GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: HEATHER LOWE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
School: Cypress High 
</P>
<P>
Sport: Volleyball 
</P>
<P>
Position: Middle blocker 
</P>
<P>
Class: Sophomore 
</P>
<P>
Lowe, a six-foot middle blocker who has been averaging about 15 kills per 
match, outdid herself Thursday in a five-game victory over Los Alamitos. Lowe 
had 27 kills, including nine in the final game, which Cypress won, 15-12. 
</P>
<P>
"And they were going after her," Coach Jerry Gregg said. "They were triple 
blocking her and she was hitting through it and hitting over it." The rest of 
her game was strong as well -- she had five aces, five stuff blocks and served 
on the final point of the match. Gregg said her serve -- she has made more than 
90% of her serves this season -- is one of her best weapons. Outstanding play 
by Lowe, who had 15 kills Tuesday in a three-game sweep of El Dorado, is one of 
the main reasons the Centurions are 11-3 and 8-0 in Empire League play, in 
first place with two matches remaining this week. Lowe and teammates Misty 
Hartung and Lupe Nava are members of a Long Beach-based club team that won a 
United States Volleyball Assn. national championship last summer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other top performers: 
</P>
<P>
* Tara Kroesch, who had 20 kills for Newport Harbor in a five-game volleyball 
victory over University Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
* Anne Mall, who swept her three singles sets at love to lead Dana Hills to a 
10-8 tennis victory over Capistrano Valley Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
* Keri Phebus, who helped Corona del Mar to a 10-8 victory over Miraleste 
Monday, sweeping her singles sets, 6-0, 6-0, 6-1.

BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: MARCELLUS CHRISHON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
School: Mission Viejo High 
</P>
<P>
Sport: Football 
</P>
<P>
Position: Running back 
</P>
<P>
Class: Senior 
</P>
<P>
Despite his small stature (5 feet 10, 150 pounds), Chrishon wore down the 
Capistrano Valley defense and in the second half wore it out. Chrishon gained 
99 yards in the second half and scored two touchdowns -- on runs of 39 and 23 
yards -- in the fourth quarter as the then-No. 6-ranked Diablos pulled away 
from then-No. 2 Capistrano Valley and won, 28-13. 
</P>
<P>
Chrishon's totals for the game -- 165 yards in 26 carries -- gave him 905 yards 
for the season, sixth in the county. "He has blazing speed," Coach Mike Rush 
said. "We haven't seen that around here for a long time." This is only 
Chrishon's second season of high school football. He played sparingly as a 
sophomore at Maryvale High in Phoenix and sat out last year after transferring 
to Temecula Valley High. Before the season, Mission Viejo coaches had thought 
Chrishon, who also plays free safety for the Diablos in key situations, would 
play mostly defense, but in practice it became clear that he should be carrying 
the ball on offense. "It's amazing how good he would be if he had played the 
three years," Rush said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other top performers: 
</P>
<P>
* Quoc Pham, who rushed 17 times for 199 yards and two touchdowns in Costa 
Mesa's 51-14 victory over Laguna Beach Friday. 
</P>
<P>
* George Sanchez, who rushed 13 times for 124 yards and two touchdowns, blocked 
a field-goal attempt and returned an interception 51 yards for a touchdown for 
La Quinta, a 43-14 winner over Bolsa Grande Friday. 
</P>
<P>
* Nick Sanchez, who completed five of six passes for 267 yards and three 
touchdowns in Whittier Christian's 42-8 victory over Ontario Christian Friday.

LOCAL NEWS STATION REDUCES NUMBER OF EDITORIAL EMPLOYEES

Six weeks after its premiere on local cable television, Orange County 
Newschannel has dismissed about a dozen editorial workers -- more than 15% of 
the 24-hour news station's staff. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth D. Tiven, OCN's vice president and general manager, said those 
dismissed were free-lance journalists who knew "going in" that they were hired 
for short stints of two months or less. 
</P>
<P>
"We were using a whole series of free-lance people to get started," Tiven said. 
"Many of them knew they were just there because we were not sure what we 
needed. We felt it was better to be overstaffed at the start." 
</P>
<P>
Tiven would not give a precise number for those dismissed or for those still 
remaining. The reduction leaves OCN with fewer than 60 reporters, technicians 
and advertising sales people. 
</P>
<P>
When OCN was launched in mid-September, he said the news channel would be run 
with a staff of about 70 workers.

COMPUTER SLUMP? INGRAM MICRO D SALES UP 54% IN 3RD QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Dean Takahashi and Leslie Berkman, Times staff writers

<TEXT>
<P>
Don't tell the folks over at Ingram Micro D that there's a slump in the 
computer industry. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana-based computer distributor says its sales jumped a whopping 54% 
-- to $367 million -- during the third quarter compared to a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is an industry slowdown in progress," says company Chairman Linwood 
A. (Chip) Lacy, "(Ingram Micro D) has not experienced it." 
</P>
<P>
Ingram Micro D said the company's U.S. sales for the quarter ended Sept. 30 
grew 46% from the year-earlier period. The privately held company does not 
release earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Lacy expects growth of desktop computer sales to slow to about 7% a year 
compared to double-digit growth in recent years. He estimated that total sales 
of computer hardware, software and peripheral equipment are growing between 15% 
and 18% annually. 
</P>
<P>
"The distribution industry will grow slightly faster than overall business 
because some manufacturers may shift to distribution because it's a more 
economical way to sell products as the prices of products come down," Lacy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ingram Micro D is expected to post sales of $1.45 billion during 1990 and $1.75 
billion in 1991, Lacy said. He said the company's biggest customer, Microsoft 
Corp., will provide an estimated $150 million in 1990 sales. 
</P>
<P>
He said the overall industry growth is being driven by sales of laptop and 
notebook computers. Despite the growth, Lacy said the company is being cautious 
about adding staff or filling vacant jobs. The company employs about 1,200 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Lacy said his goal is to increase international sales to a third of total sales 
by 1994, from the current 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Lacy said the company may either move its warehouse-style headquarters into new 
offices or build its own headquarters complex by the end of the year. The 
location would be within 5 miles of the company's headquarters on South Yale 
Street in Santa Ana.

Defense Contract: Irvine Sensors Corp. in Costa Mesa won a $2.6-million 
contract from the U.S. Army to develop and test a new generation of homing 
guidance sensors for the proposed "Star Wars" missile defense system. 
</P>
<P>
Under a 33-month contract with the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, 
Irvine Sensors will create and test a small, lightweight infrared guidance 
sensor for missiles designed to intercept enemy missiles and destroy them with 
the force of impact. 
</P>
<P>
The sensor, about the size of a sugar cube, would be able to recognize a target 
earlier and guide the missile to it with more accuracy during the last leg of 
an interception mission, said Myles Suer, director of marketing.

JOSEPH N. BELL: A LESSON FROM THE THE VOTERS' LEAGUE: DEMOCRACY MATTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In late October every other year, I get what I call the Election Blight. My 
ears ring, I dream in TV sound bites that promise disaster if one candidate or 
another isn't elected, instead of counting sheep I count propositions, I can't 
find honest-to-God legitimate letters in my mailbox because it is stuffed with 
electioneering portents of doom. That sort of thing. 
</P>
<P>
When that happens, I always look for a fix. Leave the country. Sleep 16 hours a 
day. Refuse to turn on TV or radio. Go to a lot of bad movies. Avoid dinner 
parties, especially if they are made up primarily of Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
This year, I found a new fix. It worked, and I want to tell you about it. 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, I was privileged to speak at the annual meeting of the 
Orange Coast chapter of the League of Women Voters. Before the program, I 
shared lunch with a group of animated, enthusiastic and involved league 
members. And when I asked them how they could still be enthusiastic given the 
state of current election campaigns in our republic, they told me. Firmly, 
thoughtfully and almost convincingly. 
</P>
<P>
I remember thinking afterward that I wished I had taken notes. I knew what was 
coming. So when Election Blight hit me in its most virulent form a few days 
ago, I called Tricia Harrington -- who heads up all of the Orange County 
leagues -- and asked her if we could reprise that lunchtime conversation. And 
we did. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago Monday I met Harrington, Ann Quilter (president of the Orange Coast 
chapter) and Barbara Wright (the Orange Coast membership chairwoman) to talk 
politics over coffee. And I got my fix. 
</P>
<P>
The league is a nonpartisan but highly political group dedicated to developing 
and making public information on issues pertinent to local, state and national 
elections in the United States. This is done on the premise -- no, the 
conviction -- that given proper, unbiased and thorough background on issues, 
American voters will make informed decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The league never takes partisan positions on candidates -- no matter how sore 
the temptation -- but sometimes does on issues that have been thoroughly 
studied internally. It also puts on candidate forums, a practice that started 
many years ago when the league sponsored some of the earliest presidential 
debates. 
</P>
<P>
So my question, thrown out over coffee to these women who work so assiduously 
within our system was this: How can you keep your faith in an informed 
electorate when our elections have degenerated into personal attacks on 
candidates, sloganeering, outrageous and misleading statements and promises, 
and single-issue bigotry? 
</P>
<P>
What came back to me evolved around three basic themes: 
</P>
<P>
1. Put into historical perspective, today's election scene isn't as bad as I'm 
painting it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to remember the past as if all citizens were literate and informed 
themselves before voting. And candidates didn't make personal attacks on each 
other," Harrington said. "I don't think it was ever that way. I don't know if 
we've ever had a campaign strictly on issues." 
</P>
<P>
2. We're in a period of basic political transition that is going to get better. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today," said Quilter, "machine politics are mostly gone, but nothing has 
replaced them. As a result, discipline and central control are also gone. We're 
in a period of transition between party politics and issue politics that all 
started to change with the matter of John Kennedy's religion. Since then, more 
and more of the issues people were concerned about didn't coincide with party 
positions. People used to vote the straight party ticket, but no longer. Look 
at the way the Republicans have emerged in the South." 
</P>
<P>
Added Wright: "There are also enormous social changes that affect our political 
system. Families are so different today, and we have so many more and 
complicated issues to deal with. We're still very much in the process of 
sorting all this out." 
</P>
<P>
3. Reform is in the air -- and on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a growing lack of trust in our system," Harrington said. "Young 
people especially are disgusted with the process; they don't vote because they 
don't want to be involved in a process that validates candidates they don't 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
"Why is this feeling growing? Largely because our political system is 
controlled by access to money. We need reforms to correct this. We need to look 
more carefully into such possibilities as public financing of elections, equal 
access to media and automatic registration of voters." 
</P>
<P>
Added Quilter: "We also need to do something about the initiative system, which 
is badly out of whack in California. The present ballot is onerous with 28 
complicated issues. Even given readable information, the most intelligent 
people can't make sense out of this maze of issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, the answer is simple. We have representative government, and that's 
where the decisions should be made. Right now, our Legislature is giving up its 
role to the initiative. If we don't turn that around pretty soon, our whole 
political process may be threatened." 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line with these three women -- and, I suspect, with all of their 
associates in the league -- is that our political system, despite its current 
excesses, needs loving care and attention, not abandonment. 
</P>
<P>
"What are my choices?" Wright asked rhetorically. "Throw in my hat and say, 
'Too much, too out of control'? If I do that, I've lost." 
</P>
<P>
Said Harrington: "Let's be perfectly honest. I do get discouraged. But I've 
found that one-on-one, people do care. They do want to make more informed 
choices. I believe enough in our country and our system that this work has 
become my vocation. And if I didn't have confirmation once in awhile, I 
wouldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
Added Quilter: "We all like the political process. We believe in its untidy 
give-and-take. You know, we're descendants of the suffragettes, and once they 
got the vote, they organized the league and went to work on women's issues. 
</P>
<P>
"We've suffered some losses in recent years because so many women are now 
working outside the home. In a sense, we're the victims of our own success as 
feminists. But now we're seeing a resurgence. I think the pro-choice issue is 
bringing women out of the woodwork." 
</P>
<P>
Wright wrapped it up with this: "People who lead can't go through life with 
their cup half empty. Ours is half full. We're in this for the long term. 
Democracy matters." 
</P>
<P>
So I got my fix. I'll study those damned propositions. But I still won't like 
it.

KEEPING FIT: A 'VUKUTO' WORKOUT; 
</P>
<P>
FUNK-STYLE AEROBICS TAKE ON FEELING OF LIVE ROCK CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Laguna Beach fitness instructor Mel Jackson started conducting his 
funk-style aerobics class to the beat of live conga drums, tambourines, flutes, 
bells and bass guitars, he realized that he had something special on his hands. 
</P>
<P>
So, to encourage the family feeling that was rapidly developing among his 
students, he implemented a unique "black only" dress code and gave the class 
the most intriguing name he could find. 
</P>
<P>
"I found vukuto (pronounced voo-koo-toh) in a Swahili dictionary that was given 
to me by a student," says Jackson. But it wasn't the dark ritual overtones of a 
word that sounds like some weird blend of voodoo and karate that attracted 
Jackson to vukuto; it is nothing more or less than the Swahili word for sweat. 
</P>
<P>
"The workout you get in my class is the cake," Jackson says. "Vukuto is a blend 
of cardiovascular exercise, dance choreography, and muscle isolation exercises 
sandwiched between a proper warm-up/stretch and cool-down/stretch. All the 
other stuff is just icing." 
</P>
<P>
Mixed in with the aerobics dance workout are the soulful enthusiasm of a 
revival meeting, without any religious testimonials, and the "Jumpin' Jack 
Flash" audio-kinetic involvement of a live rock concert, without the stench of 
smoke and cheap perfume. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the difference between watching MTV and going to a live concert," 
says Pam Warner of Corona del Mar resident . "It's disciplined and wild at the 
same time -- and the workout does wonders for my bad back." 
</P>
<P>
While there are other exercise classes that are conducted to live music -- most 
notably Zahava's Monday night class at Legion Hall in Laguna Beach -- Jackson's 
Vukuto is the only one that encourages joyful, foot-stomping interaction 
between the "audience" and the "performers." 
</P>
<P>
What makes Vukuto unique is that -- once it all gets going -- it's hard to tell 
who's working and who's playing. Also, the avant-garde, aluminum and concrete 
ambience of Laguna Beach's Club Postnuclear, where all Jackson's classes are 
held, definitely contributes to the "Saturday Morning Live!" feel of Vukuto. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson brings it all together by standing between stage and dance floor. From 
this position he skillfully cues both the musicians on stage and the exercisers 
on the floor in a way that catalyzes both groups. The result is everyone starts 
jumping and shouting like a bunch of Grateful Deadheads. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the musicians come out on the floor and surround us," says long-time 
student Brenda Thompson of Lake Forest. "That really gets you going." 
</P>
<P>
Wherever they happen to be, the musicians enthusiastically perform aerobic 
dance movements while playing their instruments. On the floor, aerobic dancers 
mimic, sweat and chant like revivalists under the spell of the Rev. Mel at the 
Church of the Truly Physical. 
</P>
<P>
Although all the low-impact movements are safe and sound, neither Jackson, the 
band, nor the dancers always know what's coming next. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it is improvisational," Jackson says. "Sometimes we're all surprised 
when one set of movements just flows into the next. Sometimes a student will 
even grab a tambourine and jump in with the band." 
</P>
<P>
This blend of funk aerobics, dance choreography and live music is held every 
Saturday and Sunday morning at Club Postnuclear on Laguna Canyon Road. Between 
8:30 and 9 a.m., Jackson's assistant, Karen Lee, leads a "primer" session 
designed to help newcomers tune in to the basic move sequences. Most involve 
movement of the trunk and shoulders in addition to traditional movement of the 
arms and legs. At 9, the band and Jackson show up and that's when the "meeting" 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson says that planned spontaneity has always been a key theme in Vukuto. 
</P>
<P>
"It just sort of happened about two years ago," Jackson says. "A friend of 
mine, Markus Ritchie, started playing drums as background for some of my 
classes. But Markus is a real showman -- and he loves to dance -- so he started 
swiping my tambourine and dancing around with the class. Everyone loved it." 
</P>
<P>
Reasoning -- a la Frank Zappa -- that if some is good, more is better, and too 
much is just enough, Jackson brought in other instruments and other musicians 
until he was able to scrap recorded music altogether. That's about when the 
popularity of Jackson's classes began to soar. 
</P>
<P>
"We went from 10 to 15 people per class to 20 to 30 in just a few months," 
Jackson says. "And now, because we get as many as 60 people showing up on 
Sunday, we have to cut it off at 50 so everyone has enough room to move." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson says the word is out among musicians as well. Between five to 10 
musicians show up every Saturday and Sunday morning to get in on the action. 
</P>
<P>
"First-timers just follow my cues and blend in with the three to four regular 
players," Jackson says. "It's amazing, but it always seems to work out fine." 
</P>
<P>
The owners of Club Postnuclear have since scrapped their own standard aerobics 
program, of which Jackson's classes were just a part. They then leased the 
facility to Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the weekend Vukuto classes, Jackson personally conducts other 
classes seven days a week. "Techno-funk," a cardiovascular workout coupled with 
muscle-isolation floor work, runs Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays at 9 a.m. and 
6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Choreographic Funk," which focuses more on dance technique, is held Tuesday 
and Thursday mornings at 9 a.m. Lee conducts "Fundamental Funk," for beginners, 
on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson also teaches a "Street Dancing" class for "juniors and teens with an 
attitude." The class, designed for boys and girls age 13 and up, runs Tuesdays 
and Thursdays at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
An additional seven classes at Ken Norton's Gold's Gym in El Toro, and seven 
private training sessions a week keep Jackson as busy as a fitness professional 
can physically afford to be. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson and Ritchie have great plans for Vukuto. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still developing the concept," Jackson says. "But eventually we'd like 
to build it into a complete traveling show. We'd show up at a club or studio 
just like we were doing a gig and people from all over could dance, exercise 
and enjoy live music all at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Adds Ritchie, "We're also looking at a Vukuto record album and the possibility 
of marketing the class to MTV or a video company."

TWO TOP ACTORS LEAVING RESIDENT ENSEMBLE OF SCR; 
</P>
<P>
ANNI LONG AND JARION MONROE, HER HUSBAND, ARE DEPARTING FOR ARTISTIC AND 
PERSONAL REASONS.

<P>
Two of South Coast Repertory's most versatile and well-regarded actors have 
left the resident ensemble and moved to Northern California for a combination 
of personal and artistic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Anni Long, who joined SCR in 1975, and her husband, Jarion Monroe, who made his 
SCR debut in 1988, are already working in separate stage productions elsewhere 
and will make their permanent home in Mill Valley outside San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Long, in rehearsals for a starring role in Keith Reddin's "Life During Wartime" 
at Berkeley Repertory, said in an interview last week from Mill Valley that she 
and Monroe hope to retain a long-distance connection with SCR. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe left Saturday for Yale Repertory in New Haven, Conn., where he will 
reprise a multiple role that he originated last season at SCR in the world 
premiere of Howard Korder's "Search and Destroy." Reddin's play opens Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
SCR artistic director Martin Benson confirmed that Long and Monroe left on 
amicable terms and that SCR playgoers could expect to see "both of them back 
here" from time to time "working in significant roles." 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't lost us," Long said. "We talked about this with Martin and David 
(Emmes, SCR producing artistic director), and they feel it's nothing but good 
for actors to work with others and come back broadened." 
</P>
<P>
Long admitted that she had been miffed at not being asked to audition for the 
starring role of Ann Whitefield in Shaw's "Man and Superman" earlier this 
season on the SCR Mainstage. But, she insisted, neither that nor Benson's 
failure to cast her in the major supporting role of Violet -- for which she was 
allowed to audition -- had anything to do with her departure. 
</P>
<P>
"The casting of 'Man and Superman' was a great disappointment to me," Long 
acknowledged. "I was very upset. You will have to ask Martin why he didn't cast 
me because I frankly do not know. But that is not why I left." 
</P>
<P>
Benson said: "I had a stronger cast, and I didn't feel Anni would have been 
better. But in no way does that value her less. After all, I was the one who 
cast her as Lemon in 'Aunt Dan and Lemon.' " 
</P>
<P>
A major factor that contributed to his casting decision for "Man and Superman," 
he said, "was making sure with a resident company that the audience doesn't get 
a steady diet of the same actor." 
</P>
<P>
Long said that family reasons lay at the heart of her decision to leave. Monroe 
has a 10-year-old son from a previous marriage who lives in Northern 
California, she said, and they want to see him more frequently than was 
possible from Orange County. She also said she wanted to escape the county's 
"crush of development," which she said was making her "spiritually sick." 
</P>
<P>
Long also cited artistic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Other theaters have offered me work over the years, and I have not taken it 
because I felt so good at South Coast Rep," she said. "I felt safe, which is a 
part of the reason I need to work other places. For an artist to get real 
comfortable is to relax and maybe not play quite up to risk, maybe not go for 
broke every time. 
</P>
<P>
"Although I feel I hadn't fallen into that trap, I wanted to protect myself 
from letting that happen. Why not keep myself really fresh and alive in my work 
and bring back new energy that I get from working in a different environment 
with new people for a totally different audience? It's very exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Long said Berkeley Rep had asked her last spring -- well before she decided to 
leave -- to read the script of "Life During Wartime." She said she felt "a 
special affinity" for Reddin's work, having been in SCR's world premieres of 
his "Highest Standard of Living" and "Rum and Coke." 
</P>
<P>
"I have a history with this writer," she said. "I also enjoy doing multiple 
roles, and in this play I get to do three characters." 
</P>
<P>
Because Long ultimately was cast in "Man and Superman" as Miss Ramsden, a tiny 
role, she said she felt that it would not be a hardship for Benson to let her 
out of the Shaw production two weeks before it closed earlier this month so she 
could begin rehearsals for Reddin's latest play. "I told Martin that doing it 
meant a lot to me, and he graciously agreed to find a replacement and let me 
go," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In 16 seasons with SCR, Long has appeared in more than 50 productions, 
beginning with "Jumpers" and including "Benefactors," "As You Like It," "The 
Time of Your Life," "Equus," "A Doll's House" and "The Ruling Class." She 
starred as Lemon in "Aunt Dan and Lemon" on the Mainstage three seasons ago, as 
Sally Talley in "Talley's Folly" on the Second Stage two seasons ago and as 
Kate in "Emerald City" on the Second Stage last season. 
</P>
<P>
But that is only a fraction of what she has done recently. Long also played 
multiple roles in productions as different as "Hard Times" and "Search and 
Destroy," and she lent key support in productions from "A Chorus of 
Disapproval" to "A Christmas Carol" to "The Crucible." 
</P>
<P>
Monroe, who married Long on New Year's Day, 1989, has been even busier than she 
has in recent seasons. Ever since his SCR debut in "The Crucible" -- the couple 
met while performing in that 1988-89 season opener -- Monroe has worked 
virtually nonstop in an assortment of roles so strikingly varied that the 
audience sometimes did not recognize him. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently seen as both Mendoza and the Devil in "Man and Superman," Monroe 
starred with Long as an Australian screenwriter in "Emerald City" and as the 
Dickensian Gradgrind in "Hard Times." In "Search and Destroy" he was an icily 
dictatorial self-growth guru and an officiously bureaucratic tax collector. He 
also was an indelibly smarmy libertine in "A Chorus of Disapproval" and an 
elegant Ghost of Christmas Past in "A Christmas Carol." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Long's departure with Monroe has given Benson similar ideas. "I've 
begun to think of working somewhere else myself just as a tonic to get some 
perspective on SCR," he noted. "It's so easy to lose track of the world by 
staying in one place." 
</P>
<P>
Benson, who co-founded SCR in 1964 with Emmes, has staged more than a third of 
all its productions. He has a shelf of directorial awards but has never worked 
professionally outside SCR. The last time he staged a play elsewhere was eight 
years ago at Chapman College in an amateur outing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Benson hastened to add, however, that directing at other professional theaters 
is "a long-range idea." His next production is Mark Lee's "Pirates," scheduled 
to open on the SCR Mainstage in January. 
</P>
<P>
IN LIMBO: Theatre in Exile has canceled "Miss Julie" because of dismal 
attendance during the opening weekend at the Forum Theatre in Laguna Beach. 
August Strindberg's 19th-Century naturalist drama, which ran from Oct. 19 to 
21, was to reopen Nov. 9 to 11. But producer-director Joseph Karimbeik said 
fewer than 100 paying customers showed up for the first three performances, 
which made the cost of remounting the show prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
BURN THIS: Elysium, the company that took William Hoffman's "As Is" to Los 
Angeles after its run at the Forum Theatre last season, has raised more than 
$10,000 to stage Lanford Wilson's "Burn This," also at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The production, to star Dan Millington as Pale, will be the play's Orange 
County premiere and will run from Jan. 10 to Feb. 10, 1991. "We've got about 
five sold-out houses so far," Millington said. Peter Henry Schroeder, who 
teaches acting at South Coast Repertory's Adult Conservatory, will direct. 
Schroeder just staged "Countess Dracula" at Santa Ana's Way Off Broadway 
Playhouse.

CZECHOSLOVAKIAN QUARTET OPENS FOUNDERS HALL SERIES;

The Panocha String Quartet opened the 1990-91 "Music in Founders Hall" series 
at the Orange County Performing Arts Center with a concert Sunday centered 
around works by their Czech compatriots Bohuslav Martinu and Leos Janacek. As 
representatives of native culture, the quartet itself was much more consistent 
than its program. 
</P>
<P>
Violinists Jiri Panocha and Pavel Zejfart, violist Miroslav Sehnoutka and 
cellist Jaroslav Kulhan brought a warm, dark tone and an intimate atmosphere to 
the stark 299-seat Founders Hall. Opening with a refined reading of Beethoven's 
"Harp" Quartet, the four demonstrated secure communicative powers whether 
required to apply delicate precision or pushed into aggressive contrapuntal 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
The Czech compositions underscored the quartet's stylistic versatility, its 
ability to shift easily from classical to contemporary idioms. Martinu's 
Quartet No. 5, written in 1938, is a modern adaptation of Eastern European 
flavors. It begins with a busy hubbub of a movement punctuated by interludes of 
intense lyricism. Eerie melodies surface throughout the piece, dominating the 
atmospheric adagio and emerging with ominous insistence in the third-movement 
allegro vivo. The musicians responded convincingly with a focused sound, 
balancing troubled, interweaving lines with homophonic climaxes and worried 
respites. 
</P>
<P>
Dating from 1928 and subtitled "Intimate Letters," Janacek's Second Quartet is 
a disjunct, undeveloped work that challenges performers to tie up myriad loose 
ends. It is full of about-faces in tempo and sentiment, and it abounds in ideas 
that -- though heard frequently enough to be memorable -- never blossom into 
the next thought with any sense of inevitability. Any listeners who don't know 
the story behind the piece -- a series of ardent love letters to a considerably 
younger woman -- may find that it disintegrates into a hodgepodge of mixed 
emotions. 
</P>
<P>
The Panocha Quartet put up a mighty struggle. The players exploited what 
strengths they could find -- the passionate passages of the first movement, the 
inscrutable intensity of the third. Ultimately, however, the weaknesses of the 
score defeated even these most valiant of suitors. 
</P>
<P>
Two encores brought relief from the very serious and searching program -- a 
graceful minuet from Mozart's E-flat Quartet, K. 171, and a lighthearted 
arrangement entitled "Pizzicato" from Gluck's ballet "Don Juan." Understated 
good nature marked both selections.

Guns N' Roses lead singer Axl Rose was arrested today for investigation of 
assault with a deadly weapon after allegedly striking a West Hollywood neighbor 
on the head with a wine bottle, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, 28, apparently believed that the woman, Gabriella Kantor, 37, had called 
police after complaining of loud music in his home, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Rose was arrested at his 12th-floor condominium at 2:30 a.m. and booked for 
investigation of assault with a deadly weapon. His business manager, Doug 
Goldstein, posted $5,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Rose and Kantor got into a heated argument in the hallway over loud music he 
was playing in his apartment, a sheriff's spokesman said. Rose allegedly 
grabbed the woman's keys and tossed them off a balcony. He then allegedly 
emptied a bottle of wine and swung it at her, the spokesman said.

SANTA ANA POLICE CONTINUE HUNT FOR GUNMAN WHO KILLED 3 MEN

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police today continued to search for the gunman who shot and killed three men 
and injured a fourth late Monday outside an apartment complex in a neighborhood 
beset by drug-related crime. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police also released the names of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
Killed in the shooting were Angel Brito Guadarama, 16; Mario David Mora, 23, 
and Noel Hererra Arroyo, 20, all of Santa Ana, according to Lt. Robert Helton. 
</P>
<P>
Miguel Angel Toledo Soto, 22, of Santa Ana is at UCI Medical Center in Orange 
in serious condition with several bullet fragments still lodged in his head, a 
medical center spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that although Soto's doctors describe him as 
"disoriented," he has shown signs of responding favorably to treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Helton said the gunman -- described as in his mid-20s and wearing dark clothing 
-- walked through the Fairview Villas apartment complex and opened fire on four 
men standing next to a bank of public telephones. Two of the victims fell to 
the ground and died immediately, while a third ran about 25 yards to an 
apartment, where he died. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect then fired two rounds through the front windshield of a passing 
car, with one of the rounds hitting Soto in the head. There was no indication 
that Soto, a passenger in the car, had any involvement with the other victims, 
Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth man at the telephones was uninjured, and police are searching for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no evidence that would indicate it's gang-related. None whatsoever," 
Helton said.

FALL KILLS LANCASTER WOMAN, 87 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 87-year-old member of the Lancaster Woman's Club died after falling 20 feet 
from a staircase into the orchestra pit of the city's new Performing Arts 
Center during a tour of the facility, city officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
Viola Parr of Lancaster, who had a prosthetic device on one leg, apparently 
fell sideways from the staircase into the pit about 4:45 p.m. Monday, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's cultural arts superintendent was leading Parr and five other members 
of the club's executive board on a tour of the $7.5-million center, which is 
under construction and scheduled for completion by spring, City Manager Dennis 
Davenport said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters took Parr to Antelope Valley Hospital Medical Center, where she 
died about 8:45 p.m., a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether the prosthetic device on Parr's leg played a role in 
her fall, Fire Capt. Steve Salhus said. Davenport said there were no railings 
on the staircase, which had a wall on one side and the orchestra pit on the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
"In our minds it is a pure and simple accident," Davenport said.

2 ARRESTED IN HIT-AND-RUN DEATH OF N. HOLLYWOOD FLOWER VENDOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A teen-ager selling flowers at a North Hollywood intersection died after he was 
struck by a car driven by an alleged hit-and-run driver whose vehicle also 
crashed into three cars before it stopped and he was arrested, Los Angeles 
police said today. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old North Hollywood boy, whose name was not released pending 
notification of relatives, was standing on the center divider at Sherman Way 
and Laurel Canyon Boulevard about 6 p.m. Monday when he was struck by a car 
driven by Martin Hernandez Torres, 23, of Tujunga, Officer Dennis Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said Torres was driving north on Laurel Canyon and attempted to turn left 
against a red arrow on Sherman Way. As he did, his vehicle hit the rear of a 
car driving south on Laurel Canyon. The impact sent Torres' car barreling over 
the center divider of Sherman Way, where it hit the youth. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that Torres backed over the boy as he fled the scene, 
driving west on Sherman Way. The boy was taken to AMI Medical Center of North 
Hollywood, where he died a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said Torres' car collided with two other vehicles as he attempted to turn 
south on Whitsett Avenue from Sherman Way. Torres was chased from the scene of 
the second collision by two motorcycle officers who witnessed the crashes. In 
the 6800 block of Whitsett, Torres and a passenger, Alejandro Torres, 33, got 
out of the car and ran but were found nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Both were arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter. Martin Torres also 
was arrested on suspicion of three counts of felony drunk driving, driving 
without a license and driving without auto insurance. Both were being held in 
lieu of $5,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Alejandro Torres was treated for minor injuries at the County-USC Hospital jail 
ward. Police were uncertain whether the two men are related.

Scientists have detected a new abnormality in the brains of suicide victims, a 
discovery that may lead to better ways of identifying and treating 
suicide-prone people, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers from New York University and Israel's Weizmann Institute of Science 
compared the brain chemistry of 12 people who committed suicide and were not on 
psychiatric drugs with 12 people who died of other causes. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers found suicide victims' brain cells had between two and nine times 
the number of protein structures, called mu opioid receptors, as other people's 
brain cells. The biggest difference was seen in areas of the brain involved 
with sensory and motor function. 
</P>
<P>
The people who killed themselves also had 50% less of another type of opioid 
receptor, called delta, in several brain regions, including the area that 
governs memory.

Fallen televangelist Jim Bakker was given an "unconscionably long" 45-year 
sentence from a biased judge who said he was tired of being a "sap for 
money-grubbing preachers," attorneys for the PTL founder argued today before a 
federal appeals panel. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Robert Potter, who sentenced Bakker after a jury convicted 
him of bilking thousands of his followers, is nicknamed "Maximum Bob" for his 
harsh sentences. Bakker's attorney, Harvard law Prof. Alan Dershowitz, argued 
that "Judge Potter is one of the reasons" that federal sentencing guidelines 
were drawn up in 1987.

<P>
Archbishop Paul C. Marcinkus, the burly American prelate implicated in Italy's 
biggest postwar banking scandal, retired from Vatican service today. 
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old native of Cicero, Ill., said he plans to return to the United 
States and take up pastoral work in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican said Pope John Paul II had accepted the resignation, after repeated 
requests from Marcinkus, from his post as deputy governor of the Vatican 
city-state. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-4 prelate, who acted as a bodyguard to the Pope during his early 
foreign travels, headed the Vatican bank, formally known as the Institute for 
Religious Works, for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
But in a sweeping restructuring of the scandal-tainted bank last year, the 
Vatican eliminated Marcinkus' post as president.

General Cinema Corp. today said it would buy the shares of the prestigious 
fashion retailer Neiman Marcus that it does not already own for $240 million in 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
Chestnut Hill-based General Cinema, one of the nation's largest movie theater 
operators, now owns about 60% of Neiman Marcus Group Inc. but controls only 44% 
of the voting stock. 
</P>
<P>
It said it will buy the rest of the stock in a tender offer for $14.40 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Neiman Marcus operates 22 stores under that name and 228 Contempo Casual 
woman's clothing stores, as well as Bergdorf Goodman in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Its popular Christmas catalogue is known for offering unusual and extravagant 
gifts. 
</P>
<P>
While the retail sector has been sluggish, Neiman Marcus is expected to prove 
somewhat resistant to the economic slowdown because it caters to wealthier 
clients who do not cut back much on spending.

NEW HOME SALES OFF 6%; WORST IN 6 MONTHS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sales of new homes slumped 6% in September, the ninth decline in the last 12 
months and the worst drop in half a year, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
New home sales totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 503,000 last month, 
the Commerce Department and the Housing and Urban Development Department said 
in a joint release. 
</P>
<P>
Sales fell 1.8% in August and 0.9% in July. Both figures were revised from 
earlier estimates of a 1.4% decline in August and a 0.2% drop a month before 
that. 
</P>
<P>
During the first nine months of the year, sales totaled 435,000 homes, down 15% 
from the same period of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Economists viewed today's report as more confirmation of a weak housing market, 
attributed to consumers' fear of a recession, high home prices and high 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
While the weakness was bad news for builders, it was good news for home buyers. 
The median price of a new home dropped to $115,000 in September. That was down 
from $118,400 in August and $120,000 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the enactment of the budget deficit-cutting package, the Federal 
Reserve on Monday nudged short-term interest rates lower. The rate charged 
among banks for overnight loans fell to 7.75% from 8%. However, it was unclear 
whether banks will pass the benefits of the cut through to consumers, 
stimulating home sales with lower mortgage rates. 
</P>
<P>
At the September sales pace, it will take 8.4 months to exhaust the inventory 
of unsold new homes, up sharply from a backlog of 7.9 months in August. 
</P>
<P>
By region, the sales decline was worst in the Northeast, where sales dropped 
15.6% in September after falling 9.9% in August. Sales shrank 7.9% in the 
South, 2.2% in the Midwest and 0.7% in the West.

DOW UP 17 BUT LEAVES BROAD MARKET BEHIND

Blue chip stocks closed higher today but the broader market was left behind in 
a roller-coaster session dominated by uncertainties over the Middle East and 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 17.82 points at 2,448.02. 
</P>
<P>
But the broader market was less bullish. Declining issues outnumbered advancers 
by a margin of about 9 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 663 up, 821 
down and 468 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume was a moderate 153.45 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said selective buying of shares in large companies boosted the Dow, 
but the rest of the market was depressed by continuing tensions in the Middle 
East and worries about the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks had been lower for much of the day following the release of 
third-quarter gross national product figures. The Commerce Department said the 
economy grew at an annual rate of 1.8% during the July-September period, a 
stronger than expected showing. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Wall Street was not impressed by the figures, since much of the 
increase was due to consumer spending that was in turn boosted by higher sales 
of cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Wachtel, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said the stock 
market still believes the economy is heading for a recession, especially since 
consumer spending is expected to decline. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said there was also growing uneasiness about the Middle East that made 
many traders wary of the market. 
</P>
<P>
In late afternoon, sellers left Wall Street and buyers moved back in, picking 
up some of the glamour stocks. But the overall market remained down as traders, 
mindful of the economic and Middle East pictures, had little incentive to buy 
most issues. 
</P>
<P>
Earnings reports continued to affect stocks. Ford Motor led the NYSE most 
active list, tumbling 1 7/8 to 27 3/4 after announcing a third-quarter earnings 
drop. 
</P>
<P>
But even companies with good earnings reports were suffering. Boeing, which 
announced a profit increase and positive outlook on Monday, was off 1 5/8 to 44 
1/2 in early trading on concerns the aerospace firm might not be able to keep 
up its earnings pace. 
</P>
<P>
Among blue chip issues, Philip Morris rose 3/4 to 46 5/8, General Electric rose 
1 1/4 to 52 1/8, and IBM was up 3/8 to 106 3/8 by mid-afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were lower in early trading on an inflationary rise in oil prices 
and concerns of oversupply in the government securities market. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was down 3/16 point, or $1.88 per $1,000 
in face amount, around midday. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, was up 
to 8.86% from 8.83% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Economists said the credit markets too shrugged off the GNP report. 
</P>
<P>
A GNP rise normally would depress bond prices because it would reduce the 
likelihood of the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates to stimulate the 
economy.

Police investigators sifted through Polly Peck International's books today to 
try to solve the mystery over what caused one of Britain's biggest corporate 
collapses. 
</P>
<P>
The Serious Fraud Office, which investigates major corporate crime, said it had 
searched the London office of the conglomerate that had interests from fruit to 
electronics. 
</P>
<P>
Control of Polly Peck International PLC was handed to court administrators last 
week after it missed payments on its $2.1-billion debt. 
</P>
<P>
The fraud office said police and accounting investigators were examining the 
company's financial records. 
</P>
<P>
The search expanded a previously launched probe into alleged trading 
irregularities in the stock of Polly Peck, one of Britain's hottest shares of 
the 1980s. The stock, valued at $3.95 billion in July, is now deemed worthless.

The Confederation of British Industry today reported the lowest level of 
business confidence since October, 1980, with manufacturers reporting falls in 
orders, output and employment. 
</P>
<P>
The employers' organization, in its quarterly survey of industrial trends and 
business confidence, reported that 53% of firms surveyed said they were "less 
optimistic about the general business situation than four months ago." This was 
the eighth consecutive monthly decline. 
</P>
<P>
The October, 1980, survey found that 46% of respondents were negative on the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
"Manufacturing industry is clearly facing very tough economic and trading 
conditions, and many firms are now battening down the hatches and preparing to 
ride out the storm," said David Wigglesworth, chairman of the CBI committee 
that compiled the study.

Former Olympic diver Bruce Kimball will serve less than five years of a 17-year 
sentence for a 1988 drunk-driving accident that killed two teen-agers, the 
Florida Parole Commission decided today. 
</P>
<P>
The commission voted to release Kimball on Nov. 24, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
That date is firm unless the case is brought back to the commission for 
disciplinary action by the Department of Corrections, parole spokeswoman Ruth 
Anne Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
Kimball, who pleaded guilty to two manslaughter charges, has served about 22 
months of his sentence for the Aug. 1, 1988, drunk-driving accident that killed 
two and seriously injured three. 
</P>
<P>
A silver medalist in 1984, Kimball was in training for the 1988 Olympics. At 
the time of the accident, he had a blood-alcohol level twice the legal limit.

BUFFALO DEFENDER EASED UP ON PATRIOTS' BATTERED QB

Buffalo Bills defensive end Leon Seals may have taken it easy on battered New 
England Patriots quarterback Steve Grogan on Sunday, but his teammates said 
they didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"My experience has been any time that you go less than 100%, you're going to 
get hurt," Bills linebacker Ray Bentley said. "You can't hold up." 
</P>
<P>
But, after Buffalo's 27-10 victory over the Patriots Sunday, Seals said he 
"low-keyed it a lot" after finding out Grogan was forced by the Patriots to 
sign a document acknowledging that a neurosurgeon advised him not to play 
football because of a spinal condition. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just going to be honest about it," Seals said. "I wasn't going in there 
for the kill." 
</P>
<P>
Seals, 6-foot-5 and 267 pounds, did sack Grogan, 6-4 and 210, in the second 
quarter, tackling the Patriots quarterback just as Grogan saw him break through 
the offensive line. The Bills also had two other sacks. 
</P>
<P>
"I went back there and got him, but I wasn't saying, 'I'm going to kill you' 
and that kind of stuff," Seals said. "It's a touchy situation, because as a 
defensive lineman you're taught to go in there and rip a person's head off. 
</P>
<P>
"But in a situation like that, you have to kind of low-key it. You have to have 
respect for a guy like that." 
</P>
<P>
Grogan said he signed the document, designed to protect the Patriots legally 
should the 16-year veteran suffer a serious injury, and agreed to play because 
four other doctors told him that he faced no greater risk than any other 
player. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a business," Grogan said. "We compromised on the language so that 
everybody was comfortable with it." 
</P>
<P>
Seals said several Bills defenders talked about Grogan's frail state before the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody said, 'I just hope I'm not the one to go in and hit him and have him 
stay down. If I ever get a sack, I hope he gets back up.' " 
</P>
<P>
Seals said every player lives with the possibility that he could cause 
permanent injury to another player. 
</P>
<P>
"With any kind of hit, the guy could go down for good," he said. "And for you 
to deliver that hit, it's going to be something you're going to live with the 
rest of your life." 
</P>
<P>
Bills Coach Marv Levy said the game film showed that Seals "played very hard." 
In fact, the team awarded Seals a game ball for his efforts. 
</P>
<P>
A comment by Max McGee, former football great and now a broadcaster, that 
Minnesota running back Herschel Walker "looks like he's just stole a watermelon 
headin' south" wasn't uttered maliciously, he said. 
</P>
<P>
McGee's comment was made Sunday on the Packer Radio Network during broadcast of 
the Green Bay-Minnesota game. McGee, Green Bay's receiving star in the 1967 
Super Bowl, analyzes games for the radio network. 
</P>
<P>
"You know Walker looks like he has on so much pads when he carries the ball, he 
really can't put the ball. . . . It looks like he's just stole a watermelon 
headin' south," McGee said after Walker had returned a kickoff near the end of 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
McGee apologized on Monday, saying the remark in "no possible way had any 
racial connotations. I used to steal watermelons when I was a kid. . . . It 
just popped right out."

NOTRE DAME'S ZORICH MAY SIT OUT THE SEASON

Notre Dame nose tackle Chris Zorich injured his right knee against Pittsburgh 
and could miss the rest of the season, an Irish official said today. 
</P>
<P>
"That may sound drastic, but it's not out of the realm of possibilities," 
sports information director John Heisler said. 
</P>
<P>
Zorich, a 1989 All-American, suffered a partial dislocation of the right knee 
cap Saturday during the third quarter of No. 2 Notre Dame's 31-22 victory at 
Pittsburgh. The kneecap slipped back into place but left the knee sore and 
swollen, Heisler said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that's going to go away, it's just a question of how long it's 
going to take," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Zorich is undergoing daily ice treatments to relieve the swelling. He will not 
practice this week or travel with the team for Saturday's game against Navy. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz said on his weekly syndicated television show that 
Zorich might have to sit out the remaining three games as well, including a 
Nov. 10 road game against No. 11 Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
Trainers nevertheless hope that Zorich might be able to play against Tennessee, 
Heisler said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure we'll know much more for the next couple of days," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Zorich, a senior, anchors a Notre Dame defensive line that has been shaky at 
times this season but held up well enough for the Irish to have a 6-1 record.

Jennifer Capriati cracked the top 10 rankings in women's tennis by winning the 
Puerto Rico Open. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati, seeded second, defeated top-seeded Zina Garrison 5-7, 6-4, 6-2 on 
Sunday to take the $150,000 event, her first victory since turning pro in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
The victory boosted her to No. 10 in the world in the latest rankings. 
</P>
<P>
At 14 years, 6 months, 29 days, she became the third-youngest woman to win a 
tennis tournament. The youngest was Tracy Austin, who was 14 years, 1 month, 4 
days when she won at Portland in January, 1977.

EVANS CUT LOOSE BY RED SOX

<P>
Last week the Boston Red Sox said they wouldn't exercise Dwight Evans' contract 
option, and now they've cut him from the team. 
</P>
<P>
Evans' 19-year career with the Red Sox formally ended Monday when the team 
placed him on unconditional release waivers. 
</P>
<P>
By placing Evans on waivers, the Red Sox did the outfielder-designated hitter a 
favor. That's because Evans is a Type A free agent, according to the 
statistical rankings released last week. 
</P>
<P>
If Evans, 39, had not been waived, he would have had to file for free agency 
with the Major League Baseball Players Assn. and a team would have had to give 
up an amateur draft choice in order to sign him. But if Evans clears waivers by 
Thursday's deadline, he would be able to sign with any team without it having 
to give up a draft pick.

MIMI ROGERS HOPING FOR 'REALLY CO-STARRING' FILM ROLES FOR WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB THOMAS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mimi Rogers sees a gleam of hope that women may one day achieve equal status in 
today's macho movie world. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an unfortunate fact that there are many more roles for men than there are 
for women. A favorable sign is the success of films like 'Pretty Woman' and 
'Ghosts' -- much more successful than big, male-dominated action films," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"With these two films, in which women are on more of an equal level, being so 
successful, maybe the trend will start to shift in the direction of having men 
and women really co-starring." 
</P>
<P>
If not equal, Rogers has a vital role in "Desperate Hours," with Mickey Rourke 
and Anthony Hopkins. It's Dino De Laurentiis' update of the 1955 movie, with 
Rogers in the part originated by Martha Scott. Rourke plays the Humphrey Bogart 
role of a criminal psycho who takes a suburban family hostage. Hopkins has the 
part of the husband, originally played by Fredric March. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers has three new films: "Desperate Hours"; "The Doors," Oliver Stone's 
biography of rocker Jim Morrison; and "The Rapture," an apocalyptic drama. Last 
January, she and Tom Cruise ended their three-year marriage, during which she 
seemed to be subordinating her own career as his zoomed skyward. 
</P>
<P>
She corrected that impression: "I actually worked quite a bit. Unfortunately, 
two of the films that I did haven't been released in this country." 
</P>
<P>
"I did a picture for Vestron called 'Hider in the House' (with Gary Busey) that 
got caught up in the company's bankruptcy. Then I did a film with James Belushi 
called 'To Forget Palermo.' We spent 14 weeks shooting that. It was an 
Italian-financed film -- an English (language) film with an Italian director. 
That's always a bit of an experiment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what happened to it. Maybe American distributors looked at it and 
thought it wasn't going to make money. Both of those films, I think, have been 
released internationally but not here. So there's an apparent void that didn't 
really exist." 
</P>
<P>
Like her former husband, Mimi (short for Miriam) Rogers had a traveling 
childhood. Both their fathers were engineers who took jobs all over. Rogers was 
born in Coral Gables, Fla., but she moved to Virginia, Arizona, Michigan, 
England and finally Los Angeles. A good student, she graduated from high school 
at 14, and started acting in her 20s. Her first film was "Blue Skies Again" 
with Harry Hamlin. 
</P>
<P>
She usually plays "the love interest." But she hopes that will change as movies 
take a feminine tilt.

SWEAT IS WORKED UP ABOUT SALES 
</P>

<P>
Keith Sweat is a competitor. He was pleased about a recent review but noted the 
critic preferred fellow singer Al B. Sure. His latest album has gone platinum, 
but he's still keeping an eye on the progress of Johnny Gill. 
</P>
<P>
So when Sweat makes records, he thinks about what sells. Songs about 
relationships do better, he insists, whether they're about getting together or 
breaking up. 
</P>
<P>
The singer also tries to imagine what he likes to hear on the radio, and beyond 
that, what the average buyer looks for in a record store. Sweat, dipping into 
his considerable royalties, decided to be one of those buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"Most artists are not record-buyers," the singer noted in an interview at the 
Manhattan offices of Elektra Records. "They don't have to buy records; they can 
get them for free. If you're with a company, and you want an album, you tell 
somebody you want an album and they'll go get it for you. 
</P>
<P>
"If I go to a store and actually buy records . . . I'm more aware of what it's 
like to decide what to get." 
</P>
<P>
The music on his new album, "I'll Give All My Love to You," is a mix of hip-hop 
and soul, what's come to be known as "new jack swing." 
</P>
<P>
Demographics count, too. Take "Merry Go Round." It was conceived during a sound 
check in London when the singer heard some carnival music. He was reminded of 
the hit "Side Show," a Philadelphia-style ballad recorded by Blue Magic in 
1973. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Sweat had a ballad of his own, with an easy, sinuous groove and a message 
he's sure will appeal to record customers of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Merry Go Round' could relate to anybody," he insisted. " 'Merry Go Round' 
could appeal to kids. They like it because I'm singing about merry-go-rounds, 
and they're thinking about amusement parks. 
</P>
<P>
"When adults are singing, they're thinking about a relationship, when you go 
through changes over and over again, like a merry-go-round. It was a gimmick to 
make all age limits like it." 
</P>
<P>
Sweat, a native of Harlem, grew up two blocks from the famous Apollo Theater. 
Marvin Gaye was his idol. He figures he was like a lot of kids, dreaming about 
being a singer, practicing dance steps in front of his mirror the way others 
today pretend they're Michael Jordan on the playground. At age 14 he began 
singing and was soon working on his own material. 
</P>
<P>
"I would just write lyrics on paper," he said. "I would also make 'em rhyme. 
'Your love is true, I'll always love you.' I never tried it out on girls, but I 
knew the stuff I was writing was pretty cool to me." 
</P>
<P>
Sweat began shopping songs around, including one called "I Want Her." There 
were no takers. 
</P>
<P>
He would have settled for anyone but came up empty. Reluctantly, he did the 
song himself, including it on his debut album, "Make It Last Forever," released 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I Want Her" topped the black charts and reached No. 3 on the pop charts. It 
also helped the album sell more than 3 million copies. Still, Sweat is even 
prouder that he produced the song. 
</P>
<P>
"Singers get the limelight," he said. "But producers get more respect. In the 
business, it's who produced the record, who wrote the record. I'm a firm 
believer that if you want my songs, I got to produce my songs." 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't see himself as a great singer, such as Luther Vandross, but one who 
makes the most of his ability. Gaye once observed that he improved as a 
vocalist by telling himself to "relax, just relax," and Sweat said releasing 
tension makes it easier to express himself with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
And that's about the only time he does let down. "Make You Sweat," a hit single 
from his new album, is more than a clever takeoff on his name; it's a way of 
life. Radios, records and trade magazines are all influences, ingredients in a 
recipe for prime-time new jack swing. 
</P>
<P>
"I listen to Babyface and Bobby Brown, and I just went and bought some Marvin 
Gaye records. But I think I've also established myself. I don't have to follow 
in anyone's footsteps," Sweat said. 
</P>
<P>
"Before me there was no new jack swing, and I wanted to start a new jack swing 
era. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything started with 'I Want Her.' Once you create a style, you become the 
creator of something. People look at you to be a leader."

RUSHDIE PUTS '60 MINUTES' IN NO. 1 SPOT;

TELEVISION: NBC EKES OUT A SLIM RATINGS LEAD OVER ABC.

<P>
Salman Rushdie came out of hiding just long enough last week to boost "60 
Minutes" to No. 1 on the Nielsen prime time ratings list, it was reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
NBC just barely won the week with only one-tenth of a ratings point ahead of 
ABC and three-tenths of a point ahead of CBS. 
</P>
<P>
In the ratings for the week ending Sunday, according to the A. C. Nielsen Co., 
NBC won with a 12.5 rating, ABC had a 12.4 and CBS a 12.2. All three posted a 
21 share. 
</P>
<P>
The "60 Minutes" show containing the interview with the author of "The Satanic 
Verses" -- who remains under a death sentence issued by Iran's Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini -- was one of four CBS shows to make the Nielsen top 10. 
That's the same number of CBS shows that made that exclusive club the previous 
week, but those were all World Series games. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-week-old season-to-date statistics point to a really tight race, with CBS 
only one-tenth of a ratings point behind No. 1 NBC. NBC leads with a 13.2 
rating and 22 share, followed by CBS with a 13.1 rating and a 22 share. ABC is 
not far behind with a 12.7 rating and a 21 share. 
</P>
<P>
Night-by-night competition saw NBC win Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and 
Saturday, while ABC took Monday and Friday and CBS captured Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Audience reaction to the season's new shows continues to range in large part 
from apathy to tedium. Exceptions were "America's Funniest People" (ABC) in 
20th place, the top-rated of the new shows. "Law and Order" (NBC), now 
ensconced in its regular Tuesday slot instead of substituting for "L.A. Law" on 
Thursday, was second among the newcomers in 31st. 
</P>
<P>
Those encouragingly above 50th place on a list of 92 shows included "Married 
People" (ABC), 32nd; "The Trials of Rose O'Neill" (CBS) tied for 40th; "Over My 
Dead Body" (CBS), 43rd; "Fresh Prince of Bel Air" (NBC) tied for 44th; "Uncle 
Buck" (CBS), 46th, and "Going Places" (ABC) tied for 49th. 
</P>
<P>
Between 50th and 60th place were "American Dreamer" (NBC), 51st; "WIOU" (CBS), 
52nd; "The Flash" (CBS), 56th; "Gabriel's Fire" (ABC), 57th and "Ferris 
Bueller" (NBC), 59th. 
</P>
<P>
CBS borrowed a couple of stars from "L.A. Law" to win the Sunday movie contest, 
with Jill Eikenberry and Michael Tucker in "The Secret Life of Archie's Wife," 
tied for 33rd. The theatrical film "Lethal Weapon" on NBC was in 35th place, 
and ABC's theatrical, "Stakeout," was 55th. 
</P>
<P>
The much-touted family feud between the Huxtables and the Simpsons continues to 
fizzle instead of sizzle. "The Cosby Show" on NBC tied for eighth place, while 
Fox's "The Simpsons" tied for 24th. That still makes it the highest-rated Fox 
show of the week and gives the neo-network a good start on Thursday night. 
Unfortunately for Fox, "Babes," the show that follows "The Simpsons," tied for 
75th. 
</P>
<P>

LAST WEEK, Ivana Trump struck me as lonely and upset, sitting in the baroque 
gilt splendor of the Trump Tower penthouse. Now we add the loss of her father 
to these feelings. Milos Zelnicek, 63, died of a heart attack Saturday and 
Ivana, her aide Lisa, and the three children are all in Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
It's no small thing for Ivana to lose her tall, handsome, supportive father. He 
has been her strong right arm all her life and a devoted and helpful 
grandfather to the little Trumps. Now he is gone. 
</P>
<P>
Ivana has to be very strong herself to go on without her wonderful dad. 
</P>
<P>
IT'S NO secret anymore that French actor Yves Montand entered into an affair 
with Marilyn Monroe during the making of their aptly titled 1960 movie "Let's 
Make Love." But just how serious was this dangerous liaison? Montand was 
married to Simone Signoret, MM to Arthur Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Well, according to a new biography, just published in Europe, it was very 
serious indeed. Montand is quoted in "You See, I Have Not Forgotten" by Herve 
Harmon and Patrick Rothman: "Not for a second did I envisage breaking with my 
wife, but if she had slammed the door, I probably would have made my life with 
Marilyn. Or tried to. Perhaps it would have lasted only two or three years. But 
what years!" 
</P>
<P>
And despite the fact that their romance came during what is considered to be 
the beginning of the end for Marilyn, Montand says: "I knew Marilyn for six 
months, and not once did she behave like the unbalanced person people have made 
her out to be. . . . Marilyn was an exceptional woman." 
</P>
<P>
This book also traces Simone Signoret's terrible physical decline (she went 
somewhat beyond the natural aging process). And the authors opine that Yves' 
affair with Marilyn exacerbated her eating, drinking and smoking. Montand 
recalls: "What I found hardest to accept was this form of self-destruction. The 
more she demolished herself the more I loved her." 
</P>
<P>
Signoret was characteristically Gallic. She was sanguine and sympathetic about 
Marilyn and Yves in all her public pronouncements at the time. Years later in 
her wonderful autobiography, she maintained this dispassionate distance. But, 
according to her friend Catherine Deneuve, "Marilyn remained carved on her face 
like an unhealed wound."
