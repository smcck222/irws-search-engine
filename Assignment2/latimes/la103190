A group called People for the American Way honored actress Kathleen Turner and 
singer Don Henley in Beverly Hills the other night for their efforts in 
preserving free expression and civil liberties. 
</P>
<P>
Well, most free expression.

John Bonds may be the only motorist in the city who doesn't try to avoid 
traffic jams. In fact, he seeks them out. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds, 26, is the last of the city's paid, car-borne traffic reporters. (We're 
not counting embarrassed helicopter reporters who are occasionally forced to 
call in bulletins from their cars when they're late for work because of a 
SigAlert.) 
</P>
<P>
Bonds, who works for Metro Traffic in a Chevy Beretta, says his job "isn't as 
bad as it sounds. At least, I'm doing radio reports while I'm stuck. And, this 
is my way of breaking into the broadcasting business." 
</P>
<P>
Also, he has an advantage during SigAlerts. The "Press" placard in his window 
enables him to break out of traffic jams via freeway shoulders and medians. 
</P>

It was back in '87 that Santa Monica first began attracting the homeless, 
author Fred Basten points out. The "oceanfront attracted a group of squatters 
who erected makeshift shanties on the sand," he wrote. That's from Basten's 
book, "Santa Monica Bay: The First 100 Years." 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to Eighteen Eighty-Seven.

Employees of Laufer &amp; Associates will don costumes and go door to door in

<P>
"We're asking the tenants to separate aluminum, glass and paper and we'll put 
them in bins, and take them to a recycling center," said spokesman Kent Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
As a precaution, tenants in the building have been warned not to come to work

Ken Thim Sr. of Downey wonders if the glitch in several signs around Bell 
Gardens City Hall renders them "unofficial" or, should we say, "unoffical."

Of course, no one's perfect. Dorothy Ross of West Hollywood wrote to say that a 
recent Times story probably was referring to a small room when it mentioned

hopes so.

HOUSING AT ALL COSTS: YES ON 145 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most Californians want to own their own home but only one out of five families 
can afford to buy a house at the median price. Renters also face soaring costs, 
and nearly one out of three spends more than half of his or her income on rent. 
Proposition 145, a $315-million bond issue, would provide help for first-time 
home buyers, vulnerable tenants, poor farm workers and homeless families. 
</P>
<P>
Potential homeowners face two major hurdles -- high down payments and high 
monthly mortgage payments -- when trying to buy a first house. To reduce those 
hurdles, Proposition 145 would fund a state program to provide low-interest 
second mortgages that would be due only after the first mortgage was paid or at 
the time of sale. 
</P>
<P>
First-time home buyers would qualify if their incomes did not exceed 35% of the 
average cost of existing houses in their area. In Los Angeles, a young couple 
-- a cop married to a schoolteacher -- could earn as much as $63,000 and 
qualify to buy a condo or a small house in a modest neighborhood. That ceiling 
may sound too high to families who paid much less for their first house 20 
years ago, but it is realistic given the current realities. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 145 would also help thousands of elderly tenants. These renters 
face the threat of soaring rents because they live in apartments that were 
built with federal subsidies. Those federal subsidies are due to expire, which 
would allow the low rents to rise to market rates. 
</P>
<P>
The bond measure would preserve that affordable housing by funding $45 million 
in loans for the purchase or rehabilitation of the apartments in exchange for 
maintaining the low rents. 
</P>
<P>
An additional $45 million would fund an existing program that makes loans to 
buy or repair low-rent apartments. The new owners, who are often nonprofit 
developers, agree to maintain those low rents for up to 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 145 would also provide funds for state loan insurance, emergency 
homeless shelters and housing for farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
Californians have many housing needs. In the absence of adequate federal 
assistance, state and local governments must fill the void. We urge a yes vote 
on Proposition 145.

The exceptional cartoon by Conrad with the caption (Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Shamir telling President Bush) "I've drawn six lines in the sand!" (Oct. 18) is 
sure to enlist more rage and anger from Zionist interests against Conrad. 
</P>
<P>
The fact remains that his message is brief and straight. Conrad has always 
called the facts as they are. 
</P>
<P>
The American foreign policy should be made by Americans and in the interest of 
America and world peace. U.S. foreign policy should consistently be against 
occupation, annexation and oppression.

DRIFT TOWARD CHAOS IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congress-bashing, virtually institutionalized by Ronald Reagan and carried on 
with a vengeance by his successor, is very much in vogue these days. It is 
indefensible, on the face of it. 
</P>
<P>
With 435 individual members in the House and 100 in the Senate, representing 
the many and varied interests of 50 states and 250 million people, it is not at 
all surprising that consensus is hard to come by. When you add to the mix 
innumerable special interests, lobbies and the like, together with the 
inevitable pulling and tugging within both parties from their own disparate 
wings, it is in fact remarkable that anything gets accomplished at all. To 
blame Congress for all our follies is simply too facile. And shockingly 
irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
Further, it should be noted that President Bush has vetoed some 14 or 15 bills 
that Congress did pass. The vetoes were sustained. But we know how hard it is 
to come up with even a simple majority, let alone the necessary two-thirds to 
override. Which raises an interesting question: Who is the real obstructionist?

KHALIDI ON ISRAEL AND PALESTINIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Khalidi is a teacher of modern Middle Eastern history, he conveniently 
forgets about Israel's peace treaty with Egypt. Egypt got the entire Sinai back 
with its oil resources and peace with Israel as well. 
</P>
<P>
Khalidi mentions Resolution 242, which calls "for an end to the state of war." 
Why don't Khalidi and the other Arab intellectuals suggest to the other Arab 
nations that peace treaties with Israel probably would lead to a withdrawal 
from occupied territories? 
</P>
<P>
Khalidi knows, of course, that Dennis Prager (Commentary, Oct. 12) is correct 
in stating that the Arabs will settle for nothing less than the destruction of 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Articles, such as Khalidi's, are only rhetoric that will not convince 
intelligent, unbiased readers.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two days before I arrived here, the first, velvet phase of Czechoslovakia's 
revolution came to an end. The immediate cause of this was the surprise 
election on Oct. 13 of Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus to the chairmanship of 
Civic Forum, by a stunning margin of more than 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Revolutions have a tendency to produce shakeouts at the top within a year or 
so, usually in the form of brutal power struggles. But in Czechoslovakia, 
characteristically, the shakeout is being accomplished on tiptoes, with many of 
the protagonists unwilling to admit that competing tendencies have emerged 
within Civic Forum, let alone that one program for Czechoslovakia's future has 
won out over another. 
</P>
<P>
Vaclav Klaus is a hard-line monetarist of considerable intellectual gifts, who 
favors the same kind of headlong rush to the free market as his counterpart, 
Leszek Balcerowicz, in Poland. Klaus' language is uncompromising: He promises 
no soft landing, or even a soft takeoff; price and rent controls will be 
removed; there will be large-scale unemployment; the International Monetary 
Fund will be called in, investors invited to take advantage of cheap labor, 
factories placed on the auction block. 
</P>
<P>
Klaus' ascent may have taken Civic Forum by surprise, but it has its roots in 
the silken quality of the Czechoslovak revolution. When the Communist Party 
collapsed last November, there were signs that Czechoslovakia might be the one 
Central European country to find that elusive dream of countries in economic 
transition -- the Third Way. A relatively developed infrastructure, a prewar 
legacy of democratic rule personified by Prime Minister Tomas Masaryk and the 
gentle charisma of Vaclav Havel all gave grounds for hope. 
</P>
<P>
But Czechoslovakia's revolution, if such it was, may have happened too fast. In 
Poland the process took 10 years and was centered on a highly organized labor 
movement. In Czechoslovakia it took only a few days of crowds braving freezing 
fog on Wenceslas Square. Czechoslovakia was the last to fall; by the time its 
turn came, the Wall was down. The Czechoslovak Communists, always the grayest, 
the stupidest, the most bereft of imagination, were not so much ousted as made 
to implode. 
</P>
<P>
Against all the lies and hypocrisies of the old regime, Havel and his Civic 
Forum colleagues stood for the power of the Word, the ability to speak truth, 
to name what had been unnameable. They espoused what they called anti-politics. 
"We were concerned with certain values," Havel said in Prague last week, "and 
not with power." In removing the Communist Party, "we did not even need to 
break a single shop window." 
</P>
<P>
But at the risk of sounding ungenerous, this may have been the problem. The 
broken shop windows may be yet to come, and Klaus' economic plan may soon 
provoke them. This is a peculiarly Czechoslovakian dilemma. Klaus' victory is 
not the outcome of a vulgar putsch, or an act of betrayal. Much less does it 
suggest that Civic Forum's leaders are corrupt men, the latest to abide by 
Montesquieu's maxim that "every person invested with power is apt to abuse it, 
and to carry that power as far as it will go." 
</P>
<P>
No, the difficulty lies in Civic Forum's very conception of power. Faced with a 
totalitarian system in which all institutions were rotten, opposition to 
Communist power easily slipped into queasiness about political institutions of 
any sort. To exercise power, or to devise an economic plan, lay outside the 
competence and interest of Civic Forum's anti-political intellectuals. 
</P>
<P>
Move outside the charmed circle of the Prague intelligentsia -- into the drab 
factory towns of northern Bohemia, for example -- and all the talk is of a year 
of stagnation and drift, the same idiot nomenklatura still at their posts in 
the factories and cooperative farms. And Klaus? Yes, people say, we see him on 
the television. He is young and forceful, he smiles, he has a clear plan. With 
him we can live like the Germans. 
</P>
<P>
The inexorable laws of power, economics and political conflict fill many 
members of Civic Forum with genuine alarm. It is common to hear them talk of 
last November -- or even of the communist period -- as the happiest time of 
their lives. For then there was unity against a common enemy. For Havel 
himself, the rise of Klaus portends grave difficulties. The temptation, as 
president, will be to place unity above all other considerations. The 
alternative is to admit that anti-politics and power are, in their essence, 
incompatible. And if Klaus and Havel should go their separate ways, to which of 
them will we in the West show our most enduring loyalty?

WHAT'S MORALITY GOT TO DO WITH POLITICS?; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNOR: GOVERNMENT DECISIONS PROFOUNDLY AFFECT HUMAN LIFE, SO WE NEED INSIGHT 
INTO THE CANDIDATES' REASONING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID POLLARD, David A. Pollard is spokesman of the Religious Coalition for 
a Just State Budget. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A coalition of Jewish, Protestant and Catholic religious organizations 
concerned about the budget crisis in California recently wrote to the 
Democratic and Republican gubernatorial candidates. It expressed three goals 
and a hope. The goals were: obtain views on budgetary issues for voters to 
consider; reintroduce explicit discussion of moral issues as an element of the 
campaign, and allow voters to evaluate candidates on their views of moral 
issues besetting society and government. 
</P>
<P>
Although religious institutions should not interfere with people's political 
judgment, it is their function to remind us that political judgments have moral 
consequences. The coalition's letter stated: "Explicit consideration of the 
moral implications of governmental decision has all but vanished from the 
political scene. All major governmental decisions profoundly affect human life. 
They, therefore, have significant moral implications" and should be discussed. 
</P>
<P>
Six questions sought specific answers from the candidates on budget 
development. And the following principles were suggested to guide elected 
leadership in resolving budget dilemmas. The candidates were asked whether the 
principles are correct or not. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The sole justification for the existence of government is the common good 
of all its citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Possession of life entitles everyone to the means necessary to live. The 
state must use its powers equitably to ensure that basic needs of each person 
are met. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Basic human needs cannot be sacrificed to achieve budgetary balance. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Solving budget problems by failing to protect the human person is cruel, 
myopic and not truly cost-effective. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Budget decisions should support family solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Taxation should be used to create new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The use of regressive forms of taxation (sales tax and user fees) to effect 
solvency is inequitable. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The justice of a system of taxation must look to both the total tax burden 
shouldered by a person or a particular segment of society, and the quality and 
quantity of public services these taxes generate benefitting that person or 
segment and the rest of society as well. 
</P>
<P>
 -- This generation should pay taxes adequate to meet the responsibilities of 
state government today. Future generations should not be shackled with the cost 
of meeting today's needs as well as their own. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, neither candidate commented on any of the principles as 
requested. They were not asked to agree with the principles. Good men and women 
differ on the moral answers they hold. Each needed only an intelligent 
foundation morally justifying her or his answer. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas and Lincoln in their historic debates did not simply weigh the 
economics and politics of slavery. The tenor of their times forced them to 
address slavery and other issues in their total, human context. Public 
relations and media experts did not dictate avoiding sticky questions that 
might cost votes. A solid moral foundation for the view held had to be made. 
Their audience required strength in that fundamentally important, explicit 
measure of leadership. Lack of this strength could cost as many votes as the 
practical answers they espoused. 
</P>
<P>
Having a solid moral foundation for one's approach to governance is not 
required of today's candidate. Spectacular moral issues -- abortion, the death 
penalty and crime -- are addressed. However, the consequences to human life of 
countless other decisions of elected leadership are avoided to "sell the 
sizzle, not the steak." 
</P>
<P>
The religious coalition scored a clean hit on its first purpose: illuminating 
the issues for the voters. The questions and responses have been reported by 
the press. The group struck out on its second purpose: sparking discussion of 
moral concerns about budget decisions. The glimmer of moral values veiled in 
their answers allows some insight into the candidates, so the success of the 
third goal must be decided by the voters. 
</P>
<P>
The saddest failure, however, was the hope expressed in the coalition's letter. 
"It is our hope that you . . . communicate . . . the depth and resolve of your 
own conviction . . . (that) you will assist our state . . . by refocusing 
voters on the affairs of government as their serious moral responsibility . . . 
it extends to you the opportunity to reassume the exacting capacity of moral 
leadership . . . so critically needed by our society today." Neither candidate 
seized the opportunity to allow insight into the forces driving and guiding 
them. Neither clearly seized the challenge of moral leadership explicitly 
offered. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Jefferson, penning the Declaration of Independence -- thus, his death 
sentence for treason -- felt that "a decent respect for the opinion of mankind" 
dictated proclamation of reasons morally justifying the action. That political 
and personal fearlessness created a mantle of moral leadership that forged a 
nation and moved the world. Mikhail Gorbachev, Nelson Mandela and Vaclav Havel 
exemplify that courage and its consequences, mass media notwithstanding. Safety 
and election may be secured by moral silence. Genuine human progress and 
greatness cannot. What might happen in California if one of our candidates 
listened to Jefferson and his co-conspirators rather than Madison Avenue?

Mike Royko, the Chicago Tribune columnist, recently sought a cure for Zeke 
Mowatt's "Jumping Around the Locker Room Naked and Talking Dirty to Women 
Disorder." 
</P>
<P>
On behalf of Mowatt, the New England Patriot tight end who reportedly taunted 
and exposed himself to Boston Herald reporter Lisa Olson, Royko consulted "Dr. 
I. M. Kookie, a noted authority on lots of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
The doctor told the columnist: "I'd say, 'Zeke, here is the problem. When the 
female sportswriters come in the locker room, you are naked. So the solution to 
the problem is for you not to be naked. So put on a bathrobe, and you won't be 
naked anymore.' " 
</P>
<P>
Royko: "Ah, the old bathrobe trick." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kookie: "Exactly. Our research shows that when naked people put on 
bathrobes, we have a 100% success rate in making them not naked."

In attendance was former featherweight champion Willie Pep, 68.

<P>
Said Pep, who has been married six times: "Three of my wives were very good 
housekeepers. After we got divorced, they kept the house."

Take his word for it: Sacramento Bee columnist Joe Hamelin drew a connection

Missouri, (b) Buster Douglas' $24-million payday for seven minutes in "defense" 
of his heavyweight title and (c) the Minnesota Vikings' Herschel Walker, who is 
paid a fortune as a miscast running back on a team whose style doesn't fit his 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that the Vikings traded for Walker, not vice versa; Hamelin's column 
is a clever variation on the old take-the-money-and-run theme. 
</P>
<P>
And to drive his point home, Hamelin threw another character into the mix -- 
himself. He wrote: "If you gave me $24 million to write only one column, I 
guess it might be the last one I'd write. But I would try my level best to make 
it a very good column. I would do that much for you." 
</P>
<P>
Add Hamelin: Of Colorado's tainted victory, he wrote: "Everyone saw what was 
happening except the officials. 
</P>
<P>
"But three weeks have passed and Colorado hasn't conceded the victory, nor is 
it inclined to, largely because the 7-1-1 team has a chance at a bowl berth. It 
would mean millions of dollars to the university. And a school can't spend 
sportsmanship."

A BARRAGE OF STAKES TO END OAK TREE MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's no stakes activity at Santa Anita today, but the Oak Tree Racing Assn. 
will close its season this weekend with a barrage of rich races: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Saturday, Santa Anita will play host to the first California Cup, seven 
races worth $1 million for California-bred horses. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sunday, the $400,000 Yellow Ribbon Stakes will likely have a bearing on the 
Eclipse Award for fillies and mares on grass. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And Monday, the meeting will end with the Carleton F. Burke Handicap, a 
$200,000 grass race. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park's fall season begins a week from today. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of California Cup day will be the $300,000 Classic, at 1 1/8 
miles. The other races are the $150,000 Sprint, Distaff and Mile; the $100,000 
Juvenile and Juvenile Fillies, and the $50,000 Starter Handicap. The Distaff 
and the Mile are on grass. 
</P>
<P>
Petite Ile and Foresta are among the 10 horses expected to run in the Yellow 
Ribbon, won last year by Brown Bess, who was later voted the Eclipse Award as 
the country's best female grass runner. Brown Bess was recently retired because 
of injury. 
</P>
<P>
Petite Ile has had her problems, too, not having run since winning the Sunset 
Handicap at Hollywood Park in July. She is on a three-race win streak and has 
been training well after recovering from a leg injury. 
</P>
<P>
Foresta is a well-traveled daughter of Alydar who won the $300,000 All Along 
Stakes at Laurel, Md., on Oct. 21. That victory, her fifth in 10 starts this 
year, boosted the 4-year-old filly's career earnings to almost $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Post positions for the California Cup races will be drawn tonight at Santa 
Anita.

MARMONTE BASKETBALL ROSTERS BOLSTERED BY TRANSFER STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five basketball players have transferred to Marmonte League schools, adding 
depth to the rosters of the league's top teams. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley High, which has won or shared the league title the past five years, 
added 6-foot-4 senior Michael Crawford and Ecuadorean exchange student Diego 
Cabezas, a 6-2 forward. 
</P>
<P>
According to Simi Valley Coach Dean Bradshaw, Crawford never has played 
organized basketball and has attended a handful of schools in the San Fernando 
Valley. Crawford's uncle, Marty Wilson, was the league's most valuable player 
as a Pioneer in 1984 and was an assistant coach at Simi Valley last year. 
Wilson is an assistant at Pepperdine this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Crawford is a very talented basketball player," Bradshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
Royal, which shared the league title with Simi Valley last season, lost 
high-scoring Russell Myers to graduation but gained transfer guard David Tyner 
from Rim of the World. Tyner (6-3) made 44 three-point baskets last season. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks, which lost only three players from a team that finished third in 
the league last year, bolstered its roster with 6-foot senior guard Don Clinton 
from St. Agnes in St. Paul, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Cummings, who played at the junior-varsity level at Ventura last season, 
might start at Newbury Park this season. Cummings is a 6-2 junior.

ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
THOUSAND OAKS ROLLS TO 5TH LEAGUE TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Led by Kaili Kimura with a team-high eight kills, Thousand Oaks High clinched 
the Marmonte League girls' volleyball title with a 15-4, 15-1, 15-11 victory 
over host Camarillo on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Erikka Gulbranson had six kills and eight digs for the Lancers, who have won or 
shared five league titles in Ron Beick's five years as coach. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks (16-3, 11-0 in league play) is ranked fifth in the Southern 
Section 5-A Division poll and 10th in the state. 
</P>
<P>
In other volleyball matches: 
</P>
<P>
Royal d. Agoura 15-9, 15-4, 15-11 -- Wende Brown had 16 kills and Jennifer 
Hamilton added 13 for Royal (13-2, 11-2), which secured second place in the 
Marmonte standings with the win at home. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame d. Alemany, 16-14, 15-6, 15-4 -- Mary Strong had 11 kills and 
Phyliss Francis added 10 for Notre Dame (12-3, 8-1) in a Mission League match 
at Alemany. 
</P>
<P>
The victory clinched at least a share of the league title for Notre Dame, 
ranked No. 2 in the Southern Section 4-A. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real d. Cleveland, 15-5, 15-7, 15-7 -- Jennifer Dinaberg had eight 
kills and Jessica Dinaberg added seven for El Camino Real (12-0, 9-0) in a 
Northwest Valley Conference match at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
L. A. Baptist d. Marshall Fundamental, 15-6, 15-1, 15-7 -- Monica Davis had 
eight kills for L. A. Baptist (14-1, 8-1) in an Alpha League match at home. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Rameson added six kills for L. A. Baptist, ranked No. 5 in the Southern 
Section 1-A. 
</P>
<P>

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
HART MUST CLIMB A MOUNTAIN TO REACH TOP OF FOOTHILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hart High quarterback Ryan Connors lost consciousness momentarily after being 
hit on a desperation pass attempt on the final play in a 42-35 loss to Schurr 
on Friday, but Connors wasn't the only one knocked out. 
</P>
<P>
The loss to Schurr virtually knocked Hart from the Foothill League championship 
race. Schurr (5-2-1, 3-0 in league play) will play Burroughs (2-6, 2-1) and 
Alhambra (3-5, 2-1) in its two remaining games. Hart (5-3, 2-1) will meet San 
Gabriel (0-7, 0-3) and Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
Either Schurr and Hart has won or shared the Foothill League title since 
entering the league in 1982. Hart has won at least a share of seven of the past 
eight league titles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's over," Hart Coach Mike Herrington said. "They're going to win the rest of 
their games and we're going to win ours. It's a situation where we have to look 
for second place and to do well in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Connors, who suffered a mild concussion and was released from a hospital less 
than an hour later, is expected to play Thursday against San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know (Connors) was hurt at first," Herrington said. "I thought he was 
just disappointed we lost." 
</P>
<P>
Schurr quarterback Jay Macias, who passed for 280 yards, threw a 97-yard 
touchdown pass with 3 minutes 27 seconds to play to break a 35-35 tie. Hart had 
intercepted a Macias pass on the same play earlier in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Our guy tried to knock it down instead of making the tackle and (a Schurr 
receiver) broke away for the long one," Herrington said. 
</P>
<P>
Wishful wager?: Burroughs started the season 0-5 but has won two of its past 
three games to put itself in contention for a playoff berth. The Indians, 
however, must face Schurr on Friday and Hart the following week. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had five bucks, I'd bet Burroughs would win," Burroughs Coach Butch 
McElwee said. "I think we can beat both Schurr and Hart. We've beat Schurr up 
pretty good in the past and now they're trying to get even." 
</P>
<P>
Schurr and Burroughs have split the past eight meetings, but Burroughs has not 
beaten the Spartans since 1987 when it advanced to the Northwestern Conference 
title game. 
</P>
<P>
"I guarantee you John Burroughs will be there on Friday," McElwee said. "We've 
ordered the bus and we'll take a couple of extra kids. We'll kick the ball, 
tackle and hope we score." 
</P>
<P>
Young gun: Canyon might have found a talented tailback to augment an 
injury-laden running game. The only problem is that the talented tailback might 
not want any part of it. 
</P>
<P>
Aidan Stanford, a 15-year-old sophomore, was promoted to the varsity for last 
week's Palmdale game. Stanford (5-foot-10, 168 pounds) apparently enjoyed the 
varsity atmosphere: He rushed for 71 yards and two touchdowns. He also enjoyed 
Canyon's sturdy offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
"The blocking's a helluva lot better up here," he said after the game. 
</P>
<P>
But Stanford told Coach Harry Welch that he wishes to return to the sophomore 
team (3-0) and help that group win the Golden League championship. Welch, who 
is at a loss for healthy running backs after fullback Mike Torres was lost for 
the season, cannot understand why Stanford would not stay. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking a lot of national college exposure," Welch said. "He'd be 
foolish not to stay." 
</P>
<P>
Turning prophet: After tailback Derek Sparks left Montclair Prep for Mater Dei 
in early September, Montclair Prep Coach George Giannini did not panic. 
Instead, he calmly stated: "I think that anybody who would like to lead the San 
Fernando Valley in rushing ought to come to Montclair Prep." 
</P>
<P>
Eight weeks later, Giannini stands a prophet. But the Mounties did not have to 
look off campus for help. Instead, sophomore Eliel Swinton has taken the 
challenge and run with it -- run for 1,254 yards and 16 touchdowns, to be 
exact. 
</P>
<P>
But does he lead San Fernando Valley backs? Not just yet. Glendale's Pathon 
Rucker, a junior, has rushed for 1,259 yards. Glendale finishes against 
Crescenta Valley and Hoover. Montclair Prep finishes with Village Christian and 
Marshall Fundamental. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Calabasas, which has struggled with a small squad all year, will 
suit up 14 players Friday. But Calabasas Coach Larry Edwards is one to look on 
the bright side: "Well, at least we shouldn't get any penalties for too many 
men on the field. It'll be easy to count three on the sideline for every play." 
</P>
<P>
Disarming defense: Taft has established a reputation for physical defensive 
play. Just ask Cleveland's Dave Erhardt or Kennedy's Mike McMullen. 
</P>
<P>
Taft knocked both quarterbacks out of recent games with separated shoulders. 
McMullen, who entered last Friday's game against the Toreadors as the area's 
leading City Section passer, was injured in Kennedy's first possession. It is 
uncertain when he will return. 
</P>
<P>
After two weeks on the sideline, Erhardt returned last week and passed for a 
season-high 179 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Taft has not escaped unscathed, however. Quarterback Jesse Menchaca suffered a 
broken left ankle three weeks ago and is out indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Raider stand: When Channel Islands stopped Agoura running back Kurt Klotz on 
fourth and goal at the Raiders' one-foot line with a minute remaining Friday, 
it preserved a 13-10 Channel Islands win and kept the Raiders in the hunt for a 
playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the finest defensive stand in the history of Channel Islands," Coach 
Joel Gershon said. 
</P>
<P>
That stand also served as one of few pleasant moments for the Raiders this 
season. Injuries to All-Marmonte League running back Renard Carn and a host of 
other Raiders sent them on a four-game losing streak. But Friday's victory 
gives them a 5-3 record (2-3 in league play), including a forfeit win from 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Carn, who rushed for 243 yards in the Raiders' first two games, sustained a 
stress fracture in an ankle and missed the next five games. He returned Friday 
and played defensive back, and Gershon said Carn might return to the backfield 
on Friday at Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to take a look and see how he's doing," Gershon said. 
</P>

KENNEDY APPOINTS CO-COACHES FOR GIRLS' BASKETBALL PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donis Bailey and Bob Stevens will coach the Kennedy High girls' basketball 
program this year, replacing Toya Holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey and Stevens were assistants to Craig Raub, who coached the Golden 
Cougars from 1978-87. Under Raub, the school won three City Section 4-A 
Division titles. 
</P>
<P>
Holiday, who recently gave birth to her second child, resigned to concentrate 
on her family and teaching career at Frost Junior High. Holiday, a former 
Kennedy standout, led the Golden Cougars to three North Valley League titles in 
three years as coach. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy currently has a 130-game winning streak in league play, the longest in 
the state.

10 U.S. SAILORS KILLED IN SHIP ACCIDENT IN GULF

A burst of superheated steam killed 10 American sailors Tuesday in a 
boiler-room accident aboard a Navy assault ship, forcing a scale-back of a new 
exercise testing a possible amphibious landing in the Persian Gulf conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The break in a high-pressure steam line came just minutes after the 29-year-old 
Iwo Jima pulled out of port in Manama, Bahrain, where it had undergone five 
days of repairs, according to military officials here. 
</P>
<P>
All 10 seamen on duty in the boiler room at the time were apparently showered 
with scalding liquid and vapor that spewed across the room under pressure at 
temperatures of as much as 850 degrees. After the accident, which occurred as 
the vessel was leaving harbor, the Iwo Jima and its 1,100 Marines withdrew from 
participation in a massive amphibious landing exercise that began Tuesday on a 
beachhead in the sheikdom of Oman. 
</P>
<P>
The fatal blast came as another serviceman was reported killed and six others 
were injured in two military accidents ashore, one of them involving a Marine 
sentry who shot at three U.S. sailors as they approached his guard station. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting, which the military said appeared to be accidental, left one 
seaman in serious condition with wounds from machine-gun fire and two others 
suffering from less serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
In the other incident, a Humvee (highly mobile multi-purpose vehicle) plunged 
over a 20-foot desert embankment during a nighttime training mission, killing 
one Marine and injuring three others. 
</P>
<P>
The series of accidents brought to 42 the number of U.S. servicemen killed 
since the buildup began. 
</P>
<P>
The 11 American deaths in a single day ended three weeks without an accident 
since the Army and Air Force, in response to a series of fatal aircraft 
mishaps, imposed strict limits on night flying. 
</P>
<P>
Since the restrictions were imposed, there have been no serious aircraft 
accidents involving either service. But some officers have raised concerns 
about the prohibitions, which force Army helicopters to maintain an altitude of 
150 feet and Air Force aircraft to stay above 1,000 feet. They complain that 
the restrictions rule out maneuvers essential to combat training. 
</P>
<P>
The burst steam line in the No. 2 boiler room of the 602-foot Iwo Jima, which 
occurred at 8:15 a.m. local time, caused the largest number of deaths in a 
single incident in the Persian Gulf theater to date. 
</P>
<P>
It occurred with the ship a little more than a mile out of Bahrain on its way 
to a rendezvous with 17 other Navy amphibious vessels to begin a weeklong 
amphibious assault exercise on a remote beachhead in the northern Arabian Sea. 
</P>
<P>
The operation, code-named Sea Soldier Two, involves 95 aircraft and thousands 
of Marines. It had been expected to be even larger than last month's Operation 
Camel Sand, the first trial for an amphibious landing in the desert, military 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But the forced withdrawal of the Iwo Jima from the operation eliminated one of 
the three largest ships and more than 10% of the Marines in the floating task 
force, which has been deployed at sea since mid-September in preparation for a 
possible amphibious assault on Iraqi-held Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
With no immediate indication of the cause of the accident, the ship's captain 
immediately ordered both boilers shut down and the vessel towed back to port 
for further repairs, Navy officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the sailors were killed immediately, and their bodies were flown back to 
the United States. Two others died several hours later aboard the Navy hospital 
ship Comfort, and the remaining two seamen died aboard the same vessel this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. Mark Neuhart, a Navy spokesman in Bahrain, said that the Iwo Jima arrived 
in Manama last Thursday for maintenance on "several items that needed repair." 
But he declined to say whether the No. 2 boiler had been worked on, noting only 
that the incident remains under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The Iwo Jima, built in 1961, is the Navy's oldest amphibious assault ship. It 
is steam-driven, the steam being maintained at a pressure of 600 pounds per 
square inch. Some newer vessels are powered by safer gas turbines. 
</P>
<P>
Deployed in the gulf since Sept. 20, the vessel, which is based in Norfolk, 
Va., carries a crew of 685, about 1,100 Marines and a wide range of equipment, 
including tanks and armored vehicles, landing craft and helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
In the other fatal accident Tuesday, the Marine whose vehicle overturned in the 
desert died of what military officials described as "blunt trauma." 
</P>
<P>
Of the three other Marines injured in the night-training accident, which 
occurred at 2 a.m., only one remained in a hospital Tuesday evening. All were 
from the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, which is based at Kaneohe Bay, 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
The incident involving the Marine sentry's shooting of three sailors occurred 
Monday afternoon here but was not disclosed until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Military officials said the sailors, based at a fleet hospital and traveling in 
a military pickup truck, approached the entrance to a Marine facility. The 
Marine then "apparently accidentally discharged" two rounds from his 
.50-caliber machine gun, the Marine Corps said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
One sailor was wounded in the shoulder and chest and was later reported in 
serious but stable condition. Another was cut in the face by flying gas as the 
windshield of their vehicle was shattered by the bullets, while the third was 
less seriously injured.

IN SPITE OF INFLATION, PRICES OF MANY ASSETS ARE FALLING; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: RISING ENERGY COSTS FUEL INCREASES. BUT REAL ESTATE, PRECIOUS METALS 
AND OTHER ITEMS ARE DROPPING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All the attention to rising energy costs is overshadowing a peculiar new trait 
of the U.S. economy: It is displaying a split personality when it comes to 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Even as oil prices have dominated the headlines, prices for some raw materials, 
real estate, precious metals and other assets have been falling in the slumping 
economy. For these and other reasons, today's inflation flare-up could prove 
less painful than past episodes. 
</P>
<P>
"The impact of the oil shock on inflation is temporary," predicted Mickey D. 
Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities in New York. 
</P>
<P>
You might not know it from recent statistics. In August and September, the 
consumer price index jumped to a 9.5% annual rate. Wholesale prices took their 
greatest short-term leap in a decade, according to the Labor Department. 
Consumer inflation, measured for the final three months of this year, may hit a 
10% annual rate. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, energy costs are certain to boost inflation for various goods and 
services in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in 10 years, inflation is rising toward double digits," 
said Allen Sinai, chief economist with The Boston Co. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there is a paradox. When the volatile factors of energy and food are not 
considered, September consumer prices rose at a more modest 4% rate. The 
statistic underscores the important differences between today's oil shock and 
past bouts of inflation, including public psychology, the sluggish economy and 
policies of the Federal Reserve Board. 
</P>
<P>
While oil prices have been rising, prices for a wide range of assets have been 
sliding in the United States and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
"The undertow that we have in the economy right now isn't inflation -- it's 
deflation," said John Rutledge, chairman of the Claremont Economic Institute. 
</P>
<P>
What is more, these trends are not likely to change dramatically, as some 
customers scale back their purchases in a time of recession fears. 
</P>
<P>
A recent episode in the paper industry helps show why economic conditions may 
not lend themselves to higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 1, major producers of paper products announced a $30-per-ton increase 
in prices for linerboard, a material used to make corrugated boxes. But the 
customers -- box makers and other manufacturers -- have rejected the attempt, 
citing the weak economy and the large supply of linerboard that remains 
available. 
</P>
<P>
The hike is "dead as a doornail," said George B. Adler, a paper industry 
analyst with the Smith Barney investment firm in New York. "Customers for boxes 
are not willing to accept the price increase." 
</P>
<P>
In other cases, companies -- fearful of losing sales in a listless economy -- 
have passed on to customers only some of the increase in energy costs. 
</P>
<P>
Chemical manufacturers, for instance, have faced a whopping 57% increase in the 
cost of ethylene glycol, used for antifreeze. But so far they have passed on 
just a 13% hike to their industrial customers; little if any of the increase 
has reached the retail level, said Allen J. Lenz, director of trade and 
economics for the Chemical Manufacturers Assn. in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for petrochemicals and other oil-based products also have risen much 
less than the price of energy. 
</P>
<P>
"We see a situation evolving in which it will be difficult for industries to 
pass on increases because of the weaker economy," said Frantz R. Price, vice 
president of strategic industry analysis at the WEFA Group, consultants in 
Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some widely used industrial materials have been falling in price for 
several months. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for zinc, rubber, hides, certain metal scrap and other raw materials 
have been running lower than a year ago, in some cases sharply so. Tin prices, 
for instance, have recently been as much as 26% less than a year ago on the 
open market. 
</P>
<P>
A price index of 13 industrial commodities, compiled by the Commodity Research 
Bureau in New York, stands 3.8% lower than it did last October. This pattern of 
weak commodity prices carries a clear message, some say: The sluggish global 
economy does not lend itself to red-hot inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pretty good indicator of what's likely to happen to inflation and 
interest rates," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers 
Hanover Trust Co. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll get a couple of bad months of inflation," he said, "but by the end of 
the winter -- assuming a normal winter -- I think we'll be back down to a 3% to 
3 1/2% inflation rate." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tried and true inflation hedges of the past, such as real estate and 
precious metals, have been stagnating or declining in value. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial real estate values, for instance, have been hammered in much of the 
country. Reasons include a surplus of office space -- vacancy rates now hover 
between 15% and 20% in much of Southern California -- and the scarcity of 
financing for projects, arising from problems in the thrift and banking 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
"The two of those things together are causing a downturn in real estate 
prices," said Frederick K. Zimmermann, president of Boylston Capital Advisors, 
a money management firm in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for gold, another popular refuge in times of inflation, also have been 
dropping. After soaring by $42 an ounce in the first weeks after Iraq invaded 
Kuwait, gold has fallen back to pre-invasion price levels of less than $380. 
</P>
<P>
Gold investors are not convinced that inflation is going to surge, explained 
Bruce L. Kaplan, president of Kaplan &amp; Co., a precious-metals consulting 
firm in Los Angeles. The lackluster economy also has taken the sparkle out of 
such other precious-metal investments as silver, used in the photographic 
industry, and platinum, used by auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
"Investors are reading magazines like Fortune that say inflation may be topping 
out right now -- even with the increase in oil prices," Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve policy may be yet another reason that inflation does not take 
off in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Fed moved to ease interest rates as a way to stimulate 
the economy. But the move was modest, a clear sign that inflation fears remain 
strong among policy-makers in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"They've learned from their mistakes of the past," said Michael Penzer, a vice 
president and senior economist at the Bank of America in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Still, as the Fed's caution demonstrates, nobody is writing off inflation as a 
threat. In particular, some worry about stagflation -- a bout with 
uncomfortably high prices at a time of uncomfortably sluggish growth. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the weak U.S. dollar creates inflationary pressure by pushing up 
import prices and by forcing the Fed to keep interest rates high enough to 
attract foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
Health care -- notably hospital fees -- higher education, local taxes and the 
cost of shelter all have risen substantially this year. Even before Iraq 
invaded Kuwait, the underlying annual rate of inflation was creeping up from 
the 4.5% range to greater than 5%. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is how do you stop it?" asked David Wyss, an economist with Data 
Resources-McGraw Hill in Lexington, Mass., of inflation in health care and 
other services. "The standard formulas don't work very well." 
</P>
<P>
There also is no standard formula to forecast how members of the public will 
behave in the coming months. Back in the 1970s, Americans got so accustomed to 
a never-ending spiral of rising wages and prices that the hikes were accepted 
routinely. 
</P>
<P>
But after years of restraint in wage and price increases, public psychology may 
be different this time, with employers less willing to raise wages and 
consumers less accepting of higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
For all the uncertainties, "I absolutely expect inflation to fall next year" 
from current levels, said Joel L. Naroff, senior economist at First Fidelity 
Bancorp in Philadelphia.

ECONOMIC OUTPUT UP MORE THAN EXPECTED, STILL WEAK 
</P>

<P>
The nation's economy grew somewhat more strongly than expected during the third 
quarter of this year, the government reported Tuesday, but the expansion still 
was anemic and did not alter predictions that the nation may be headed for a 
modest recession. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce Department figures showed that the real gross national product, the 
broadest measure of the economy's output, expanded at a surprising 1.8% annual 
rate from July through September, after a second-quarter pace of 0.4%. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts warned that the figures are preliminary and do not include the 
full effects of the crisis in the Persian Gulf, which has raised crude oil 
prices sharply, dampening the economy. The impact of that did not hit until 
late September. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration was circumspect about the report. Michael J. Boskin, 
the President's chief economist, said that, although the new figures are 
"pleasant news about the third quarter, we are concerned about a sluggish 
fourth quarter and the early part of 1991." 
</P>
<P>
A broad range of analysts said they still expect the economy to fall into a 
recession during the last three months of this year, though there are sharp 
differences over how long -- or how severe -- it will be. Most forecasters had 
expected that the economy would grow at an annual rate of 0.8% for the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Allen Sinai, chief economist of The Boston Co., a New York financial firm, said 
the third-quarter figure "was not a false reading on GNP" but "is a false 
reading on the state of the economy as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist for Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in New 
York, agreed. "The GNP has not caught up with the real world, and the real 
world tells a different story," Kellner said. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is not whether we are in recession, but how long -- and how bad?" 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's report is expected to ease pressure on the Federal Reserve Board to 
push interest rates down. Although the Fed nudged one target rate down slightly 
Monday, it has been reluctant to go further for fear of exacerbating inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The figures came as the department reported separately that sales of new 
single-family homes fell a steep 6% in September -- another sign of weakening 
in the economy. The decline followed a 1.8% drop in August. 
</P>
<P>
As had been expected, the decline in new home sales was uneven. Total sales 
plunged 15.6% in the hard-hit Northeast but dipped only 0.7% in the Western and 
Mountain states. Economists said the housing industry generally has been in a 
mini-recession. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the continued bearishness among economists, analysts said the 
third-quarter report contained evidence that the economy had not weakened as 
much as had been widely believed before the Persian Gulf crisis began: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Confounding expectations, consumer spending rebounded last summer -- 
particularly for big-ticket items such as automobiles and light trucks -- with 
overall consumption up at a 3.6% annual rate, after a 0.4% pace in the previous 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stockpiles of unsold goods, which some analysts feared would be rising so 
precipitously that they would prompt cutbacks in new production later this 
year, actually rose at a slower pace last quarter than in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Spending on durable goods, which fell at an alarming 9.5% rate during the 
second quarter of the year, recovered smartly during the July-September period, 
rising at a respectable 3.6% rate. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And capital spending by business -- often a harbinger of industrial 
expansion -- also grew robustly. Business spending on new plant construction 
rose at an annual rate of 5.1%, after a 9% dip in the spring. Corporate 
spending on equipment soared at an 8.2% rate. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, analysts cautioned that the outlook will remain uncertain until 
economists can measure the impact of the gulf crisis, which will show up in 
reports covering late September and October. 
</P>
<P>
For example, analysts said that the pickup in automobile sales, which accounted 
for the bulk of the rebound in consumer spending during the quarter, stemmed 
largely from rebates and dealer incentives that well may have spurred buying 
artificially. They said auto sales most likely will fall off again in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Reaser, economist at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, said the 
situation "is not quite one of an economy that is collapsing, but of one that 
is quite weak" and might well decline at a 1% annual rate in the fourth quarter 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"This GNP report may overstate the strength of the economy last summer, but it 
may not be so bad going into the fourth quarter as it is pictured," Reaser 
said. "Perhaps the pendulum had too sharp a swing from optimism a few months 
ago to pessimism now." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Giulio Martini, an economist at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. in New 
York, contended that the third-quarter numbers were more impressive than 
economists seemed to think and could mean that any coming downturn will be 
mild. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not dismiss this number," Martini said in a telephone interview. "We 
had good demand growth and lean inventories . . . . So despite credit and 
financial problems and the real estate slump, this reflects an economy that can 
absorb them. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard W. Rahn, economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, predicted that 
Tuesday's figures will be revised downward sharply as the government updates 
its initial estimates with later information, and that the slump will begin in 
earnest later this year. 
</P>
<P>
He also predicted that inflation ultimately will prove to have been more 
virulent than the initial estimates have shown. 
</P>
<P>
"Analysts who expected the recession to start in the third quarter are one 
quarter off," Rahn declared. 
</P>
<P>
For all the apparent improvements, Tuesday's report also showed a slight rise 
in the rate of inflation. The GNP deflator index, the broadest measure of 
inflation, rose at a 4.1% annual rate during the quarter, up from 3.9% from 
April through June. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts cautioned that such measures may be misleading because they play 
down the increase in the price of oil imports. They said that, when petroleum 
imports are included in the computation, the inflation figure for the period 
rises to a 5% annual rate. 
</P>
<P>
The report showed that U.S. exports continued to grow robustly at an annual 
rate of 1.2% but that imports grew by 6%, reflecting increased purchases of 
foreign-made capital goods.

French hostages who returned from Iraq after their liberation by Saddam Hussein 
reported Tuesday that American and other hostages still held captive at 
strategic sites in Iraq have been subjected to physical and mental abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the 262 freed French hostages included the first large group of 
so-called human shields released since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
They said that some Americans were seriously injured and in failing health in 
confinement at military bases, weapons factories and other strategic sites 
scattered around Iraq and Kuwait, where they are held as insurance against 
attack by the multinational forces arrayed against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an American who is in terrible condition at a military base," 
reported Yann Rivoallan, 34, a French maintenance contractor kept for three 
months at strategic sites in Iraq and Kuwait. "He has a fractured arm that is 
highly infected, and his state of health is extremely serious. He could die 
very soon." 
</P>
<P>
Another French human shield, Patrick Moniette, said the hostages at the 
strategic locations were sometimes fed only a bowl of watered-down chicken 
broth and one hard piece of bread a day. He said the hostages occasionally 
lived in offices that had been converted into dormitories and were allowed 
outside only 1 1/2 hours each day. 
</P>
<P>
The French accounts, in which the American and British captives are depicted as 
suffering the harshest treatment, paint the bleakest picture yet of life as an 
Iraqi hostage. Their portrayal of constant mental torture stands in stark 
contrast to the "swimming-pool hostage" image promoted by Iraqi officials in 
Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
In general, they confirmed statements about hostage abuse made by U.S. 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III in Los Angeles on Monday. In an address 
before the World Affairs Council, Baker said that American hostages, who number 
more than 100, are "forced to sleep on vermin-ridden floors." 
</P>
<P>
"They are kept in the dark during the day and moved only at night," he added. 
"They have had their meals cut to two a day, and many are becoming sick as they 
endure a terrible ordeal." 
</P>
<P>
All the French hostages spoke of a spirit of fraternity between the hostages of 
all nationalities, including a large number of Americans, Britons and Japanese 
kept at strategic sites. 
</P>
<P>
"We left behind our English and American friends who helped us survive," said a 
hostage interviewed briefly on French television after his arrival in France 
early Tuesday morning. "There was a strong climate of solidarity there." 
</P>
<P>
The returning hostages reported that Americans and British were singled out for 
particular abuse. Unlike other hostages, they said, the Americans and British 
were not allowed to receive mail or make telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was done to degrade and lower the people to the level of an animal, 
especially the Americans and the English," Rivoallan, the maintenance 
contractor, told The Times. "The Iraqis especially disliked the Americans. For 
them, they were Satan." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he reported, the American hostages "carried themselves with great 
dignity." 
</P>
<P>
Rivoallan described the captives' world as one of barbed wire, hovering guards, 
overflowing toilets and near-starvation quantities of food served without 
plates or utensils. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to befriend guards proved futile. "I had the impression that if it 
were necessary to shoot us -- if someone gave them the orders to shoot -- they 
would do it without the slightest hesitation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a move widely perceived as a clumsy attempt to divide the Western nations 
poised against him, Iraq's President Hussein last week announced the release of 
all French hostages, including those held at strategic locations. 
</P>
<P>
About three weeks ago, Rivoallan said, the French were given better 
accommodations and food. "I had the impression that they made the decision to 
free us about Oct. 8 and for that reason they suddenly transferred us to much 
better conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Rivoallan said his release has left him with a bitter feeling of having been 
used as a propaganda pawn. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a reaction of revulsion," he said. "We have been freed, but people have 
been left behind. To know that we have been freed by Saddam for propaganda 
reasons is nauseating." 
</P>
<P>
Rivoallan said he took part in a small-scale revolt at one of the military 
bases where he and others were held under particularly harsh conditions. He 
said Iraqi retaliation against the rebels resulted in the death of a British 
hostage and the savage beating of a German hostage. 
</P>
<P>
"The base was about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Baghdad at a place 
where they manufacture artillery shells," he recalled. "It was a very small 
base with unbearably unhygienic, humiliating conditions. They were starving us. 
About five or six of us revolted." 
</P>
<P>
Rivoallan, who is married and the father of two children, said he agreed to an 
interview because he promised his fellow hostages that he would tell of the 
hostages' living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"You understand, it was very difficult to leave 50-year-old men who cried when 
they saw you going," he said. "We don't have the right to abandon them, and 
they have the impression of being abandoned. There is a strange effect of being 
freed, a feeling of guilt for having departed and having left people behind who 
are suffering. 
</P>
<P>
"All those who are left behind are going to crack very, very soon," Rivoallan 
continued. "They don't want to stay, and they are no longer able to hold on. 
Soon, they are going to start trying to escape and take great risks. . . . It 
is no longer a question of weeks but of tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. 
They are desperate. We must do something to free them very, very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday was a day of celebration and reunion for the 262 French hostages and 
their families. Many headed directly to restaurants and cafes to reacquaint 
themselves with steak frites and red wine. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Moniette played soccer with his 9-year-old son, Alexis, and the family 
dog, Picsou, on the grounds of his suburban Paris home. He recalled how the 
hostages had managed to build order in their uncertain lives. 
</P>
<P>
"Each time we changed sites, I spent the first 24 hours finding out where the 
bomb shelter was, how long it took to get there and the quickest route there," 
he said. "I tried to pick out the nice guards and the bad ones and think about 
how one could escape." Like other hostages, he said, he thought he might try to 
escape if war broke out. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he listened to French news broadcasts three times a day, and he 
spoke of the great joy he felt when he heard the announcement of the release of 
all French hostages. "But the poor Japanese and Americans around us couldn't 
share in our joy," he said. "It wasn't the same for them." 
</P>
<P>
As he was leaving his last confinement, Moniette said he was approached by a 
British hostage. 
</P>
<P>
"Could you go see my little girl?" Moniette said the Briton asked him. "If 
anything happens, could you take care of her?" 
</P>
<P>
But before the Frenchman could finish the story, he collapsed in tears, 
comforted by the caresses of his wife and son. 
</P>
<P>
Another freed hostage, Jean-Michel Leturck, was met at the airport by a 
delegation from Amiens, his hometown in northern France. Amiens residents had 
formed a committee calling for his liberation and even sold T-shirts with a 
message demanding his return. 
</P>
<P>
Leturck was driven to Amiens City Hall in a limousine. When he arrived at 3 
a.m. Tuesday, he found dozens of people waiting for him with bottles of 
champagne. But he said his joy at being home is mixed with worry for the fate 
of the other hostages left in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"In the weeks that come, these people are going to die like animals," Leturck 
said. "They are locked up. They are badly treated -- not so much physically 
mistreated but mentally mistreated. They are lost. We must quickly, quickly, 
quickly get them out."

MARITAL WOES RECOUNTED AT MURDER TRIAL; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: BETTY BRODERICK DESCRIBES COLLAPSE OF RELATIONSHIP AND BITTER DIVORCE 
FROM PROMINENT ATTORNEY. SHE IS CHARGED WITH MURDER OF EX-HUSBAND AND HIS 
SECOND WIFE.

Testifying tearfully in her own defense, La Jolla socialite turned murder 
defendant Elisabeth Anne (Betty) Broderick told her life story Tuesday, 
portraying herself as a wife and mother scorned by a husband who jilted her 
after 16 years of marriage for a younger woman. 
</P>
<P>
Recounting the events of her bitter divorce from attorney Daniel T. Broderick 
III -- whom she is accused of shooting to death, along with his bride -- Betty 
Broderick said he walked out on her and began a legal campaign during which he 
secured custody of their children and manipulated her finances, leaving her 
emotionally and financially deprived. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Betty Broderick said, her husband called her names -- "old, fat, 
ugly, boring and stupid" -- after beginning an affair and suggested that she 
was crazy for thinking he was cheating on her. 
</P>
<P>
Months later, he admitted she was right to suspect him, but maintained that she 
was mentally ill, the defendant said. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick said the name-calling, the repeated suggestions and dozens of 
other indignities and insults led her to an unsuccessful suicide attempt. 
</P>
<P>
The day's testimony concluded before she could talk about what led her to sneak 
into her ex-husband's suburban Marston Hills home last Nov. 5 and kill him and 
Linda Kolkena Broderick, his new wife, the woman with whom he had begun the 
affair six years before. Daniel Broderick, 44, was a prominent medical 
malpractice attorney and a former president of the San Diego County Bar Assn. 
Linda Kolkena Broderick, 28, was his office assistant. 
</P>
<P>
When the trial began last week, defense lawyer Earley conceded that Betty 
Broderick fired the fatal shots, but said she did not have the premeditation 
the law requires for first-degree murder because she intended only to kill 
herself when she crept into the couple's home. 
</P>
<P>
Interest Tuesday in the case was extraordinary. One San Diego television 
station, KNSD (Channel 39), asked for permission to broadcast the trial live, 
but San Diego Superior Court Judge Thomas Whelan declined, a station spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Broderick's brother from suburban Denver and two of his sisters, from 
Pittsburgh and suburban Seattle, attended. So did one of Betty Broderick's 
brothers, who flew in from Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
At a morning recess, 43 people were waiting in line for about 20 open seats. 
</P>
<P>
Emotions also ran high. Kim Broderick, Betty Broderick's oldest daughter, who 
testified last week against her mother, burst into tears after one of the 
morning sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick's testimony was punctuated by frequent sobs. 
</P>
<P>
She said her ex-husband -- consistently using the present tense -- "loves 
clothes" and "looks very good in clothes." She said she often called him 
"Dapper Dan" and then she burst into tears. 
</P>
<P>
She cried, too, when she said, "Dan's opinion of me was really all I cared 
about. I didn't care what anybody else thought." 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick said she and Daniel Broderick were married in 1969, when he was 
a medical student. Instead of becoming a doctor, he decided to go to law 
school, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple -- and, by then, their two daughters -- moved to San Diego and 
Daniel Broderick began practicing law, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, Daniel Broderick decided to strike out on his own, leaving the law 
firm where he had worked for five years, Betty Broderick said. As it had been 
while they struggled through medical school and law school, there was little 
money, so she not only took care of the children but worked full time. 
</P>
<P>
At a marriage counseling session about that time, Daniel Broderick "apologized 
profusely and said he wasn't the kind of husband or father he wanted to be or I 
should have," Betty Broderick said. "He said he wanted to be a very important 
man, a very prominent man, a very rich man. He needed to concentrate on those 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
"We were almost there. If I would just give him more time, it really was for 
the children and me that he was doing all of it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
By 1982, Daniel Broderick's law practice was blossoming and, for the first 
time, the family -- now with four children, two girls and two boys -- had 
plenty of money, Betty Broderick said. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, he hired Linda Kolkena as an office assistant, he said. Soon 
afterward, she said, he began telling his wife she was "old, fat, ugly, boring 
and stupid" and saying he "just wasn't having any fun in life anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick said she was crushed. She said she let her hair grow, fixed her 
teeth and "tried to be perfect, absolutely perfect for Dan Broderick." 
</P>
<P>
He denied the affair, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1983, on her 36th birthday, Betty Broderick said, she slit her 
wrists and "swallowed every pill I could find in the house." 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer Jack Earley said he expects to ask his client about the killings 
when she resumes the stand today. If convicted, Betty Broderick, 42, could be 
sentenced to life in prison without parole.

GOVERNOR;

<P>
FEINSTEIN PICKS UP TEMPO ON CIVIL RIGHTS, ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Playing to her strengths, Dianne Feinstein exhorted women, minorities and 
disaffected Democrats to rally to her side Tuesday in a sun-splashed Santa 
Monica gathering that drew more than 1,000 enthusiastic students and most of 
the Democratic ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein specifically targeted civil rights and abortion as important issues 
to voters who will go to the polls next week, and asked Democrats to confound 
Republican hopes that voter turnout will be low. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic candidate for governor continued to try to undercut Republican 
opponent Pete Wilson with references to his Senate vote against the 1990 Civil 
Rights bill, which would have countered recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions and 
given women and minorities more power to press discrimination cases. Wilson 
opposed the bill on the grounds that it set up a quota system. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of Pete Wilson's vote, the 1990 Civil Rights Act is dead and the same 
civil rights protections that applied today to people of color were not, by his 
vote, extended to women," she told the crowd at Santa Monica College's outdoor 
amphitheater. "I say a state that is 51% female can't afford Pete Wilson as 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
"I also say that a state that's 42% people of color can't afford a governor who 
would vote no on civil rights legislation," she added. 
</P>
<P>
The midday Santa Monica rally was the 57-year-old candidate's only public event 
Tuesday. Afterward, aides said, she attended private fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
As she stumps for votes, Feinstein is trying to target traditional Democratic 
constituencies without offending so-called "Reagan Democrats," who have voted 
Republican recently because of their objections to the party's liberal 
leanings. She is also trying to woo women without being so assertive about it 
that she turns off men. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's speech brings her full circle from the day eight months ago when, 
espousing similar themes, she launched an underdog bid for the governorship. 
From this point on, apart from any unforeseen bombshells, Feinstein is 
concentrating on what she perceives as flash point issues -- crime, abortion 
rights, civil rights, education. 
</P>
<P>
As she has almost every day recently, Feinstein said she would be the candidate 
to "change" California for the better -- a claim Wilson also makes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not in this race to serve the powerful special interests or to protect the 
status quo," she said, in a gibe at Wilson. "I'm in this race to protect and 
serve the people of California." 
</P>
<P>
Recent polls have had the candidates in a near dead heat, but Wilson has had a 
consistent and ever-so-slight edge. Feinstein, trying to break away from 
Wilson, is mounting a twofold effort -- to press visceral issues in the minds 
of the voters, and to persuade them to turn out on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, she is casting the race in as emotional terms as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I need you on my side," she told the students. "This race is neck-and-neck. 
We're seven days from the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
"They're counting on a low turnout because they believe that their people will 
turn out and our people will not turn out. So I need you to talk to your 
friends, your family, other students, and mobilize that vote." 
</P>
<P>
Crime has been a constant issue with Feinstein. In addition to her support of 
the death penalty, she has espoused a host of other reforms to tighten criminal 
penalties. But Wilson, too, has advocated stronger sentencing, and he has 
benefited from the visual support of law enforcement organizations and crime 
victims' groups. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Feinstein flew around the state with more than a dozen police 
officers representing groups that have endorsed her candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
"We can bring safety back to the streets of California," she said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion rights have been an emphasis of Feinstein's since the primary, and as 
Election Day nears she is stressing its importance. The former San Francisco 
mayor, in her speech Tuesday, said that abortion rights are "under siege all 
across this country" and pledged to veto any measure that would limit abortion 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein has received a hefty boost from abortion rights advocates. CARAL, the 
California Abortion Rights Action League, endorsed Feinstein and has used its 
lobbying efforts to help her. It sent 300,000 abortion rights advocates 
absentee ballots, and has followed up those initial contacts with "persuasion 
letters" and phone calls, CARAL spokesman Peter Scranton said. Many in the 
Santa Monica crowd carried signs advocating abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson describes himself as an abortion rights advocate -- a description that 
angers activists because of his votes against their position on several 
matters, including federal funding for abortions and the appointment of 
abortion opponents to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
CARAL spokesman Peter Scranton said Wilson has been successful in convincing 
voters that he would not threaten abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been able to in some degree keep his name out there as a pro-choice 
candidate, and to that extent there may be some confusion," he said. "Our 
effort is separating the candidate we can trust with the candidate who is not 
as trustworthy." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's move to simplify her themes in the last few days of the campaign 
has been accompanied by a reassertion of the historic implications of her 
election. Feinstein would be the first woman governor of California.

EASTWOOD JOINS CAST BACKING ENVIRONMENT ISSUES

<P>
Actor Clint Eastwood rode back into politics Tuesday to take on the timber 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
The former mayor of Carmel and longtime conservative Republican joined forces 
with environmentalists to cut a television commercial promoting Proposition 
130, the "Forests Forever" initiative that would halt clear-cutting in 
California's forests. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's save the ancient redwoods," the actor says as he sits in a chair holding 
a copy of the ballot pamphlet. 
</P>
<P>
With a week to go until Election Day, Eastwood became the latest to join a 
battle of the airwaves being waged by environmentalists and industry groups 
over four ballot initiatives affecting the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Spending millions of dollars on television time, the environmentalist and 
industry campaigns are relying on celebrities, emotion-charged ads, pocketbook 
appeals and, at times, exaggeration in their last-ditch efforts to win on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
For campaigns that have spent months raising money and discussing complex 
scientific and regulatory issues, the election now comes down to its final -- 
and most important -- stage: a series of 30-second television ads. 
</P>
<P>
Eastwood is just one of a number of celebrities appearing in commercials to 
promote one of two initiatives sponsored by environmentalists -- Propositions 
128 and 130. Actors Ted Danson, Michael Landon, John Ritter and "Twin Peaks" 
stars Kyle MacLachlan and Michael Ontkean are lending their celebrity status to 
the environmentalist cause. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists also are promoting their initiatives with heart-tugging ads 
that feature a 10-year-old leukemia victim whose friends died of cancer and a 
young boy who goes camping with his father only to find the redwoods gone. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign against Proposition 128 has countered with a commercial featuring 
former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop opposing the initiative and other 
ads portraying average Californians worried about the cost of the sweeping 
environmental measure. 
</P>
<P>
The timber industry is running an ad contending that its countermeasure, 
Proposition 138, will save the state's ancient forests. Farmers are airing a 
spot maintaining that their initiative, Proposition 135, seeks an end to aerial 
malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
In attempting to win passage of Proposition 128, environmentalists have taken 
the detailed, complex measure they call "Big Green" -- which affects the 
state's food, water, air and coast -- and boiled it down to very simple terms. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the campaign began airing a commercial featuring 10-year-old 
Jennifer Shepherd, a leukemia victim from the San Joaquin Valley town of 
Fowler, which has been hard hit by cases of childhood cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really angry," says Jennifer's father, Dan. "Five of my neighbor's 
children have died of cancer. My little girl still has to live with it." 
</P>
<P>
Showing the Fowler cemetery and raw sewage spilling out of a pipe, the 
commercial says, "Prop. 128 is not complicated. It's about cancer and kids like 
Jennifer Shepherd and phasing out dangerous toxic chemicals." 
</P>
<P>
To counteract the appeal of the anti-pesticide initiative, opponents are airing 
the ad sowing Koop, retired and out of uniform, sitting behind a desk and 
criticizing the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"I've spent my life urging Americans to do things to protect and enhance their 
health," Koops says. "But public policy should be based on science, not scare 
tactics. If I thought Proposition 128 would protect the health of mothers and 
children, as its backers claim, I'd be with them. I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
Advertisements on both sides of Proposition 128 have tended to overstate the 
measure's effects, with environmentalists at times exaggerating its 
environmental benefits and opponents emphasizing high costs that may never come 
to pass. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the campaign in favor of Proposition 128 has run ads depicting the 
measure as a smog fighter even though it does not target air pollution. Rather, 
the proposition would combat global warming, and cleaner air would result only 
because many of the changes needed to cut emissions of carbon dioxide, a 
greenhouse gas, also would reduce smog. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of Proposition 128, who call it "The Hayden Initiative," have 
responded with ads charging that the wide-ranging measure will cost too much. 
"Nearly every section is full of complicated restrictions that end up raising 
costs for electricity, gasoline, water, food . . . products we use every day," 
says a woman in one ad, standing in the driveway after a shopping trip. 
</P>
<P>
Hefty price hikes for gas, electricity, water and food are one possible 
scenario, but not the only one. Supporters counter that the measure could save 
the state billions of dollars, primarily because of lower energy consumption. 
</P>
<P>
To negate the pesticide provisions of Proposition 128, the agricultural 
industry is promoting Proposition 135. Among other things, the farmers' 
initiative would leave regulation of pesticides largely in the hands of the 
California Department of Food and Agriculture, often criticized by 
environmental groups for favoring agricultural interests. 
</P>
<P>
The commercials for Proposition 135, like those on Proposition 128, tend to 
exaggerate its environmental effects. One ad says the measure "seeks an end to 
aerial Medfly spraying." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, backers of Proposition 135 have defended aerial spraying of malathion 
over the Los Angeles Basin while many of the proponents of Big Green have 
fought to halt the spraying. The commercial's claim is based on provisions in 
the farmers' measure that would increase production of sterile Medflies to 
reduce the need for future aerial sprayings. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have responded with ads featuring actor John Ritter and the 
"Twin Peaks" stars charging that chemical companies designed Proposition 135 to 
mislead the voters. 
</P>
<P>
The assertion that chemical companies are behind Proposition 135 stems from a 
proposal last year by pesticide manufacturers to come up with an initiative to 
invalidate Big Green's pesticide provisions. However, Proposition 135 has been 
financed by the agricultural industry, and donations from pesticide 
manufacturers have been returned. 
</P>
<P>
The environmentalists' campaign for Proposition 130, the "Forests Forever" 
measure, scored a major coup by recruiting Eastwood, whose tough-guy image in 
numerous films could help boost support for the environmental measure. Showing 
he is a conservationist as well as a conservative, Eastwood urges voters to 
"save the last 5%" of California's redwoods. 
</P>
<P>
The Eastwood spot and a similar ad featuring "Cheers" star Danson are designed 
to help voters distinguish between Proposition 130, the environmentalist 
measure, and Proposition 138, the industry-sponsored initiative. 
</P>
<P>
In his ad, Eastwood notes that Proposition 130 has the backing of the Audubon 
Society and National Wildlife Federation, while both major candidates for 
governor, Republican Pete Wilson and Democrat Dianne Feinstein, oppose 
Proposition 138. 
</P>
<P>
Although the fast-paced ending of the ad could leave the impression among some 
viewers that both gubernatorial candidates favor Proposition 130, Feinstein has 
taken no position on the environmentalist measure while Wilson opposes it. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson campaign director George Gorton said Tuesday that the senator objects to 
any ad suggesting that he supports Proposition 130. He stopped short of calling 
on the campaign to pull the ad, joking, "Who wants to tangle with Clint 
Eastwood?" 
</P>
<P>
In a confusing television battle between competing forest initiatives, the 
timber industry also is portraying itself as seeking to protect the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
In its commercials, the timber industry contends that Proposition 138 would 
protect the forests and wildlife. One ad shows a section of forest that has 
been clear-cut -- and by industry's loggers -- and proclaims the measure would 
ban such harvesting practices. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists, however, contend that the measure is riddled with loopholes 
that would allow timber industries to continue clear-cutting forests and 
harvesting trees faster than they grow.

SECRETARY OF STATE; 
</P>
<P>
FLORES SAYS EU WAIVED CAMPAIGN FINES INVOLVING POWERFUL FIGURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of State March Fong Eu has waived more than $4 million in fines 
against political candidates and special interest groups over the past six 
years, including politically connected Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, Drexel 
Burnham Lambert and Griffin Homes, according to records and statistics compiled 
by Republican challenger Joan Milke Flores. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, who obtained the information under the California Public Records Act, 
charged Tuesday at press conferences in Sacramento and Los Angeles that the 
four-term incumbent has gone easy on "some major players in the political 
process." She also accused Eu of attempting to conceal the records until the 
final weeks of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"After being stonewalled and misled by the secretary of state's office since 
the beginning of August and finally having to threaten the secretary of state 
with legal action, we were allowed to review the central waiver file late last 
week," Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony L. Miller, Eu's chief deputy who oversees the waiver of fines, said 
Tuesday that until recently he had been unaware that the staff kept a central 
file, which consists of handwritten index cards on each fine and waiver dating 
back several years. He said Eu has treated all violators the same, waiving or 
reducing fines for offenses that were deemed inadvertent, regardless of the 
offender's political connections or influence. 
</P>
<P>
Among other duties, the secretary of state enforces filing deadlines for 
financial disclosure statements required from candidates, political action 
committees, major contributors and lobbyists. The official also has the 
authority to reduce or waive the fees for "non-willful" violations. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Eu demanded that the attorney general file criminal or civil charges 
against Flores for missing a filing deadline for financial disclosure 
statements. Eu's campaign accused Flores of filing several days late "in a ploy 
obviously calculated to conceal for as long as possible" the $418,000 in 
contributions she collected in October. 
</P>
<P>
Eu, who has reduced fines against her own campaign committees, has argued in 
the past that she cuts fines because most violations involve innocent mistakes 
by campaign volunteers who are new to the political process. By releasing 
information from the central waiver file Tuesday, however, Flores moved to 
dispel the notion that all beneficiaries of Eu's policy have been political 
newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
"There always will be some people who will take advantage of the system, and 
for those people we need to have fines, and they need to be enforced," Flores 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Records released by Flores show that Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, the insolvent 
thrift headed by Charles Keating, was fined $2,380 in 1986 for failing to 
disclose on time $26,500 in contributions made in 1985 to the California 
Republican Party, Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale) and the California League 
of Savings Institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Eu's office reduced the fine to $50 after receiving a waiver request from James 
Grogan, identified as the thrift's corporate counsel, according to the records. 
</P>
<P>
The records also show that Drexel Burnham Lambert was fined a total of $21,260 
between 1986 and 1988 for missing various deadlines, including failure to 
report on time more than $18,000 in contributions in early 1987 to Los Angeles 
County Supervisor Deane Dana, Alameda County Supervisor Ed Campbell and others. 
Eu's office reduced those fines to $350, according to a tally of the violations 
compiled by Flores. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin Homes, one of Southern California's largest developers, was fined 
$35,348 over the last three years, according to Flores' research, but the fines 
were reduced by Eu's office to $380. Last year, the Fair Political Practices 
Commission imposed a record fine of $47,000 against the developer for making 
campaign contributions through its employees and failing to disclose itself as 
the source of the money. 
</P>
<P>
Miller acknowledged that Flores had found a potentially explosive issue by 
linking the waivers with such individuals as Charles Keating and "junk bond 
king" Michael Milken of Drexel Burnham Lambert. Keating faces charges in 
connection with the failure of Lincoln and Milken pleaded guilty to six felony 
counts involving insider trading and conspiracy to defraud investors. 
</P>
<P>
"This has become sort of a 'Willie Horton' to us because people can point to 
Charles Keating and others who have gotten off pretty leniently," said Miller, 
referring to the celebrated case of Horton, a convicted murderer, which helped 
derail the presidential bid of Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole flap . . . is going to cause us to re-evaluate our procedures," 
Miller said. "The (FPPC) has never said we are not doing the right thing, but 
clearly maybe we should have been more diligent on some of these folks."

<P>
Vermont, once known for its rock-ribbed Republicanism, sent Mr. Smith to 
Washington two years ago -- but may replace him with a socialist. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper polls in the Green Mountain State show a dead heat between Peter 
Smith, 45, a moderate Republican with a strong record on the environment and 
education, and Bernard Sanders, 49, an independent-socialist and the former 
mayor of Burlington, for the state's only seat in the U.S. House. 
</P>
<P>
Dolores Sandoval, a professor at the University of Vermont, is the Democratic 
nominee, but she has been shunned by outgoing Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin, Sen. 
Patrick J. Leahy and other leaders of her party after calling for legalization 
of drugs and the complete pullout of U.S. troops from Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's difficulties were underlined last week when he broke with President 
Bush and said he supported higher taxes on the wealthy -- as he introduced Bush 
at a campaign rally for Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The surprising dissent was in part a reflection of the populist appeal of 
Sanders, who, if elected, would become the only independent in Congress. Even 
before Smith's public break with Bush, Sanders was reason enough for the race 
to attract national and even international attention. The Economist ran the tag 
line, "The Lenin of Lake Champlain," under Sanders' picture, but the candidate 
himself insists that he is much more a "Swedish-style democratic socialist." 
</P>
<P>
He advocates a third party, saying voters are fed up with Republicans and 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them are bought and sold by large multinational corporations, and most 
of them do not have the courage to fight for the rights of ordinary people," 
Sanders said at a recent campaign gathering. "We need in this country a 
political revolution." 
</P>
<P>
Smith has hewed to a fairly independent line himself, co-sponsoring the Civil 
Rights Act of 1990, voting against the Stealth bomber and the MX missile and 
shepherding child care legislation. But he stood with the President on the 
ill-fated bipartisan deficit reduction package, a vote Sanders uses as a foil 
for his message that "the party is over," that the rich have gotten richer and 
the poor poorer. 
</P>
<P>
Smith defends his vote as courageous, the first step in solving an economic 
crisis that could lead "to recession or the 'd' word, depression." Smith later 
supported an income tax rate of 33% on those who make more than $125,000, which 
put him at odds with Bush, who favored a lower rate. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, by contrast, advocated a 50% cut in the defense budget, with the money 
being used to free the education system from its property tax foundation, to 
create a national health care plan like that of Canada and to clean up the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Burlington, where Sanders was mayor for 18 years until he stepped 
down last year, recognize those stands as vintage Bernie. There, the 
Brooklyn-accented Sanders led a progressive group tagged as Sanderistas for 
their leftish bent. 
</P>
<P>
Each time he ran for reelection, his margin increased. Admittedly, 
40,000-population Burlington is well insulated from the problems of big U.S. 
cities such as Boston, which is four highway hours to the south. But U.S. News 
&amp; World Report named him one of the best mayors in the country in 1987; 
and, in 1988, Burlington shared top honors in the U.S. Conference of Mayors' 
"most livable" cities awards. 
</P>
<P>
His proudest achievement as mayor, Sanders said, was nearly doubling voter 
participation. 
</P>
<P>
"People say the American people are apathetic," said Sanders, who has lost all 
his previous bids for statewide office. "I don't believe that. I think the 
American people are disgusted, they are in despair, they're angry and they 
don't know what to do . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"They say he's going to be an outsider," said Michael Beh, a building 
contractor who is co-chairman of Sanders' Windsor County campaign. "So what? I 
want him to raise hell."

CONGRESS / EYE ON EDUCATION; 
</P>
<P>
VOCATIONAL, SCIENCE AND MATH BILLS PASSED; LITERACY EFFORT STILL PENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Responding to calls for a better-educated work force to cope with new 
technologies, Congress worked on several education-related bills during the 
session that just ended. These three were considered the most significant: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vocational Education Bill 
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, nearly 70% of the nation's jobs will require a college 
education, a report by the William T. Grant Foundation's Commission on Work, 
Family and Citizenship says. This bill, sponsored by Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins 
(D-Los Angeles) and signed by President Bush in September, revamps vocational 
programs to serve students unlikely to pursue a traditional college education. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would provide funding to state and local governments so schools 
can set up vocational programs that would start in the last two years of high 
school and finish during two years at a community college or a post-secondary 
technical school. The bill, which authorizes $1.6 billion in fiscal 1991, would 
distribute 75% of the funds to improve vocational education and 25% to programs 
for the disabled and displaced homemakers. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), the Senate sponsor of the bill, said 
vocational programs finally are receiving the priority they deserve in the 
effort to rebuild the economy and make the work force more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos also praised the legislation, saying it 
would make the educational system better able to respond to the demand for 
skilled workers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Math and Science Bill 
</P>
<P>
Acting on Bush's goal to make U.S. students first in the world in math and 
science by the year 2000, Congress passed a bill to improve elementary 
students' abilities in those areas and to increase the number of people 
obtaining advanced degrees in math, particularly women and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
One of the major objectives of the bill, which has been sent to the President 
for his signature, is to establish a national network of regional centers to 
bring a state-of-the-art science and math curriculum to the nation's elementary 
and secondary school classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation establishes fellowships and traineeships; a national 
clearinghouse for science, mathematics and technology education materials; a 
program to give underserved urban and rural areas more access to math and 
science material, and scholarship programs for students who show promise in 
these areas. 
</P>
<P>
To increase the number of people studying for advanced degrees, the money 
available for the National Science Foundation graduate fellowship program has 
been doubled. 
</P>
<P>
"The science scholarships will encourage our young people to excel in science 
and math," said Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio), who originally proposed some of these 
programs. "They are a partial antidote to our popular culture's depiction of 
scientists as eccentric old men while it deifies lawyers, rock stars and 
certain cartoon characters." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Omnibus Education Bill 
</P>
<P>
The third piece of major legislation was a combination of several bills, 
including literacy bills offered by Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) and Rep. Thomas C. 
Sawyer (D-Ohio) and a teachers training act offered by the Bush Administration. 
The Omnibus Education Bill died at the end of Congress because there was not 
enough time to resolve funding disputes. 
</P>
<P>
But David W. Carle, Simon's press secretary, and John Gadd, a Sawyer aide, said 
similar legislation will be introduced when Congress returns next year. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee has reported that 23 million 
Americans are illiterate. Another 45 million adults read with only minimal 
comprehension. Jonathan Kozol, author of "Illiterate America," estimates that 
the United States ranks 49th among 158 nations in its illiteracy level. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can't read, write and do basic math, you just cannot be a truly 
productive American. It's just that simple," Sawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
"American jobs are placing greater demands on employees. The average American 
worker today must have skills at the ninth-grade through the 12th-grade levels, 
not the fourth-grade level typical after World War II," a Senate Labor 
Committee report said. "The growth occupations have increasingly shifted to the 
service and retail sector, which require high-level problem-solving, 
communication, reading, writing and math skills."

U.S. ATTACK IS NEAR, HUSSEIN TELLS AIDES; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: HE WARNS WAR COUNCIL OF AN ALLIED ASSAULT IN A 'FEW DAYS' AND TALKS 
OF PREPARING FOR 'URBAN WARFARE.'

<TEXT>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein told his military command Tuesday that U.S. and 
allied forces intend to attack "in the coming few days." 
</P>
<P>
Convening a war council of senior military and government officials for the 
second time in 24 hours, Hussein said he expects a combined assault on occupied 
Kuwait, which Iraqi troops invaded almost three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein personally directed talks on "preparations for urban warfare and 
necessary measures to be taken in the event of combat in the operation zone of 
the Kuwait province," the official Iraqi News Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's meeting came on the heels of a failed weekend initiative by the 
Soviet Union to budge Iraq from the annexed oil sheikdom and subsequent 
American warnings that the option of war remains open. 
</P>
<P>
"We must be prepared with all that God has given us of potential to thwart 
perfidious intentions by the United States and its allies to launch an attack 
in the coming few days," the news agency quoted Hussein as telling the Baghdad 
council. 
</P>
<P>
Attending were Iraq's top military command and the ministers of defense, 
military industries and information. The news agency report also said that top 
officers of the Iraqi army stationed in Kuwait joined the talks. It did not say 
whether the military governor there -- Ali Hassan Majid, a Hussein cousin and 
commander of the brutal 1988 suppression of Iraqi Kurds -- was in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Nor did the agency report disclose any specific cause for Hussein's alarm. 
Announcement of Tuesday's meeting -- there had been no notice given of the 
meeting reportedly held on Monday -- could have been designed to portray 
Washington as warlike in Baghdad's continuing propaganda campaign to divide 
international opposition to its invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
And Iraqi officials often speak of imminent attack. "We expect America to 
attack at any moment," Information Director Naji Hadithi is given to remarking 
almost nonchalantly to Western reporters working in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Persian Gulf crisis, which enters its fourth month on Friday, 
appeared to tighten over the past three days in a confluence of pressures: the 
virtual collapse of the Soviet diplomatic initiative and none to replace it; a 
new U.N. Security Council resolution pinpointing Iraqi repression in Kuwait, 
and reports from recently freed hostages of gross abuse of Western captives by 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III turned up the heat 
Monday in separate remarks warning Hussein that Iraq would be held responsible 
for its actions. 
</P>
<P>
Bush declared that he has authority to move in the gulf, without congressional 
approval if necessary. And Baker raked the Baghdad regime over reported 
maltreatment of the more than 100 Americans held hostage at strategic sites in 
Iraq. He repeated the American position that Washington "will not rule out a 
possible use of force if Iraq continues to occupy Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
The American leaders expressed support for diplomatic efforts to force Iraq to 
abandon Kuwait, and Bush said that the United States is not preparing for war. 
But there appeared to be little movement in the Middle East on Tuesday after 
the high-profile Soviet effort fizzled in weekend talks in Baghdad between 
Hussein and Yevgeny Primakov, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's envoy. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein refused to heed the series of U.N. resolutions demanding withdrawal of 
his forces from Kuwait, and Gorbachev, in Paris, could only suggest that "the 
best thing would be to have an inter-Arab meeting, some Arab mechanism." He 
suggested that the lead come from Saudi Arabia, where American-led Western 
forces and Arab allies face dug-in Iraqi troops across the Kuwaiti frontier. 
</P>
<P>
But Arab diplomats contacted in Amman on Tuesday held little hope for success. 
"Who has the authority?" asked one, speaking anonymously. "The divisions (in 
the Arab world) are quite deep." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet effort is continuing, but it clearly lost steam in the face of a 
defiant Hussein. Moscow had won a 48-hour delay in voting on the latest 
Security Council resolution over the weekend as Primakov, meeting the Iraqi 
leader for the second time this month, pressed for some sign of a political 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
Primakov was in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday for talks with King Fahd, and he also 
met with Kuwait's ousted rulers, who told him that they appreciated his efforts 
to resolve the standoff but would accept nothing less than an unconditional 
Iraqi withdrawal from their country. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein, in an interview with Cable News Network on Monday, had called his 
talks with Primakov "deep and very useful" but clung to his public position 
that Iraq will not withdraw from Kuwait and that Middle East issues should be 
raised in an international conference. "If God were to will that war occur, 
then we, believers in God, will not object," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The latest Security Council resolution against Iraq, passed 13 to 0 Monday with 
abstentions from Yemen and Cuba, specifically condemned the taking of hostages 
by Iraq. More than 2,000 Westerners and Japanese are being held in Iraq and 
Kuwait against their will, having been denied exit permits, and several hundred 
are being held as virtual prisoners at strategic sites. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department puts the number of Americans held as human shields at the 
sites -- oil fields, ammunition factories, dams and other possible bombing 
targets -- at 104.

Ten U.S. sailors were killed when a steam line exploded in the boiler room of 
the assault ship Iwo Jima off Bahrain as the vessel sailed toward an amphibious 
landing exercise. In a separate accident, a U.S. Marine was killed when his 
military vehicle plunged over a 20-foot embankment. 
</P>
<P>
The two incidents raised the U.S. military death toll in Operation Desert 
Shield to 42. 
</P>
<P>
Warning that the United States and its allies are planning an attack "in the 
coming few days," Iraqi President Saddam Hussein convened his top military 
commanders to make final preparations for "urban warfare." 
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress urged President Bush to carefully evaluate all options

considered.

TUNNELERS LINK BRITAIN, FRANCE UNDER CHANNEL

British and French tunnelers reached each other beneath the waters of the 
English Channel on Tuesday for a linkup that ended Britain's geographical 
isolation from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
An official of Eurotunnel, the consortium building the Gargantuan rail project 
from the British end, said the two work teams connected at 7:30 p.m. in the 
drilling of a service tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
"Britain will no longer be an island," French Radio said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a Eurotunnel spokeswoman said the British tunnelers had stopped their 
machine and inserted a 2.3-inch-wide steel pipe into the chalky soil a distance 
of 110 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The probe enabled engineers to confirm that the tunnel was heading in the right 
direction for the actual breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
The significance of the event was not lost on British workers, who call 
themselves "the Tunnel Tigers." In reports they said the hole would be large 
enough for them to get a "whiff of garlic" from the French side. 
</P>
<P>
A formal linkup ceremony will take place in January, when British Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher and French President Francois Mitterrand will meet 
at the midway point to shake hands and celebrate Britain's first physical link 
with the Continent. 
</P>
<P>
Rail traffic is scheduled to start rolling through the 31-mile link of two rail 
and one service tunnels in mid-1993. The $15-billion project began in January, 
1986.

SPY SATELLITE BELIEVED DESTROYED IS SEEN BY AMATEUR ASTRONOMERS

An American spy satellite that was believed to have suffered catastrophic 
failure and broken apart not long after it was launched in March has been 
spotted 503 miles high by amateur astronomers. 
</P>
<P>
It apparently has been there all along, said Ted Molczan of Toronto, who 
tracked the bright object seen by three other amateurs and determined it was 
the secret payload put into orbit from the shuttle Atlantis on March 1. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet news agency Novosti reported March 7 that four orbiting fragments, 
"presumably separated from the American spy satellite," were spotted in orbit. 
The agency said it assumed "the spy satellite has been blown up by its owners 
for some unknown reasons." 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Defense Department spokesman Pete Wilson said two parts 
"associated with" the payload had entered Earth's atmosphere and burned up and 
"the remainder are expected to decay within two to seven weeks." 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon insisted, however, that the Atlantis mission "achieved its goal." 
But spokesmen never said whether the "mission" was a safe shuttle flight or 
whether it meant putting a new spy satellite successfully to work. 
</P>
<P>
Asked on Tuesday about this month's spotting of the satellite, Capt. Marty 
Hauser, an Air Force spokesman at the Pentagon, said he could not go beyond the 
earlier statements.

ABNORMALITY FOUND IN BRAINS OF SUICIDE VICTIMS

<P>
Scientists reported Tuesday that they have detected a new abnormality in the 
brains of a group of suicide victims, a discovery that may lead to better ways 
of identifying and treating suicide-prone people. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers from New York University and Israel's Weizmann Institute of Science 
compared brain tissues from 12 people who committed suicide and were not on 
psychiatric drugs with similar tissues from 12 people who died of other causes. 
</P>
<P>
They found that the suicide victims' brain cells had much larger numbers of a 
protein structure called a mu opioid receptor. The biggest difference, nine 
times the normal number, was seen in areas of the brain involved with sensory 
and motor function. 
</P>
<P>
The people who killed themselves also had 50% fewer of another type of opioid 
receptor, called delta, in several brain regions, including the area that 
governs memory. 
</P>
<P>
"We may be able to find a whole new family of drugs that act on these 
receptors, help treat depression and prevent suicide," said neurobiologist Anat 
Biegon of New York University, a co-author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
Biegon emphasized, however, that it is still not known if living people who 
attempt suicide or non-suicidal depressed people have opioid receptor 
imbalances similar to those of suicide victims. Another unanswered question is 
whether the unusual distribution of receptors stems from excessively high or 
excessively low levels of opioids in the brain. 
</P>
<P>
Past studies have linked suicide only to changes involving the brain chemicals 
serotonin and norepinephrine. But the new study, presented at the Society for 
Neuroscience's annual meeting, is the first to associate changes in the opioid 
system with suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Opioids, which are naturally occuring chemicals in the body, induce 
pain-killing and euphoria-producing effects similar to opium-based drugs such 
as heroin and morphine. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors had observed that severely depressed patients experience a reduced 
ability to experience pleasure and are more likely to suffer from chronic pain 
than non-depressed people. 
</P>
<P>
Changes in opioid-binding receptors in the brains of living people now can be 
mapped by sophisticated imaging techniques such as positron emission 
tomography, Biegon said. 
</P>
<P>
If the findings in dead people hold up in living patients, it is possible 
positron emission tomography could be used to detect which depressed people are 
most likely to kill themselves.

BRODERICK TELLS HOW MARRIAGE FELL APART;

MURDER TRIAL: SAN DIEGO SOCIALITE TAKES WITNESS STAND, DESCRIBES INSULTS BY 
HUSBAND SHE IS ACCUSED OF SLAYING.

<P>
Testifying tearfully in her own defense, La Jolla socialite Elisabeth Anne 
(Betty) Broderick told her life story Tuesday, portraying herself as a wife and 
mother scorned by a husband who jilted her after 16 years of marriage for a 
younger woman. 
</P>
<P>
Recounting the events of her bitter divorce from attorney Daniel T. Broderick 
III, Betty Broderick said he walked out on her and began a legal campaign 
during which he secured custody of their children and manipulated her finances, 
leaving her emotionally and financially deprived. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Betty Broderick said, Daniel Broderick called her names -- "old, 
fat, ugly, boring and stupid" -- after beginning an affair and suggested that 
his wife was crazy for thinking he was cheating on her. Months later, he 
admitted she was right to suspect him but still maintained she was mentally 
ill, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick said the name-calling, the repeated suggestions, and dozens of 
other indignities and insults led her to an unsuccessful suicide attempt and to 
repeated acts of vandalism against Daniel Broderick. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick did not, however, have the opportunity Tuesday to explain the 
violence at the center of her double-murder trial. The day concluded before she 
could testify about what led her last Nov. 5 to sneak into her ex-husband's 
Marston Hills home and kill him and Linda Kolkena Broderick, his new wife, the 
woman with whom he had begun the affair six years before. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick's testimony is due to continue today. Defense lawyer Jack 
Earley said he expects to ask her today about the killings. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Broderick, 42, could be sentenced to life in prison without 
parole. She has pleaded not guilty and is being held in the Las Colinas Jail in 
Santee. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Broderick, 44, was a prominent medical malpractice attorney and a former 
president of the San Diego County Bar Assn. Linda Kolkena Broderick, 28, was 
his office assistant. 
</P>
<P>
When the trial began last week, defense lawyer Earley conceded that Betty 
Broderick fired the shots that killed her ex-husband and his second wife. But, 
according to Earley, she did not have the premeditation the law requires for 
first-degree murder because she intended only to kill herself when she crept 
into the couple's home. 
</P>
<P>
Interest Tuesday in the case was extraordinary. One San Diego television 
station, KNSD (Channel 39), asked for permission to broadcast the trial live, 
but San Diego Superior Court Judge Thomas Whelan declined to grant permission 
for extended live coverage, a reporter for the station said. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Broderick's brother -- from suburban Denver -- and two of his sisters -- 
from Pittsburgh and suburban Seattle -- attended. So did one of Betty 
Broderick's brothers, who flew in from Tennessee. At the morning recess, 43 
people were waiting in line at a courtroom with about 20 open seats. 
</P>
<P>
Emotions also ran high. Kim Broderick, Betty Broderick's oldest daughter, who 
testified last week against her mother, burst into tears after one of the 
morning sessions. 
</P>
<P>
And Betty Broderick's testimony was punctuated by frequent sobs. 
</P>
<P>
She said her ex-husband -- using the present tense, with which she consistently 
referred to him or his activities -- "loves clothes" and "looks very good in 
clothes." She said she often called him "Dapper Dan" -- and then she burst into 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
She cried, too, when she said, "Dan's opinion of me was really all I cared 
about. I didn't care what anybody else thought." 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick said she and Daniel Broderick were married in 1969, when he was 
a medical student. Instead of gaining practical experience as a doctor, he 
decided to go to law school, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The young couple -- and, by then, their two daughters -- moved to San Diego, 
and Daniel Broderick began the practice of law, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, Daniel Broderick decided to strike out on his own, leaving the law 
firm where he had worked for five years, Betty Broderick said. As it had been 
while they struggled through medical school and law school, there was little 
money, so she not only took care of the children but worked full-time at night. 
</P>
<P>
At a marriage counseling session about that time, Daniel Broderick "apologized 
profusely and said he wasn't the kind of husband or father he wanted to be, or 
I should have," Betty Broderick said. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he wanted to be a very important man, a very prominent man, a very 
rich man," she said. "He needed to concentrate on those goals. 
</P>
<P>
"We were almost there. If I would just give him more time, it really was for 
the children and me that he was doing all of it." 
</P>
<P>
By 1982, Daniel Broderick's law practice was blossoming and, for the first 
time, the family -- now with four children, two girls and two boys -- had 
plenty of money, Betty Broderick said. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, he hired Linda Kolkena as an office assistant, she said. Soon 
afterward, she said, he began telling his wife she was "old, fat, ugly, boring 
and stupid" and saying he "just wasn't having any fun in life anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick said she was crushed. She said she let her hair grow, fixed her 
teeth and "tried to be perfect, absolutely perfect for Dan Broderick." 
</P>
<P>
He denied the affair, she said. In November 1983, on her 36th birthday, Betty 
Broderick said, she slit her wrists and "swallowed every pill I could find in 
the house." 
</P>
<P>
She survived the suicide attempt. Two weeks later, she visited her husband's 
office for his 39th birthday, discovered the remnants of a party and her 
husband's picture on a wall in Linda's office and was told the two of them had 
left. 
</P>
<P>
She said she returned home and burned his clothes. When he returned home, again 
he told her he was not involved with Linda Kolkena, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In February 1985, however, he moved out, she said. By then, she said, the 
family was living temporarily in a rental home where she had to cope with rats 
-- a "horror show," she said. 
</P>
<P>
From the day he moved out, Betty Broderick said, her husband refused to talk 
with her about the rats -- or about anything. Never did they talk about 
alimony, child support or child custody, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In October 1985, however, Daniel Broderick told his wife that she had "been 
right all along," that he had been having an affair with Kolkena since 1983, 
Broderick testified. 
</P>
<P>
By then, she had dropped all four children on his doorstep. "I wanted Dan to 
get involved in our family," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, as the divorce wound its way through the courts, he obtained sole 
custody of the children and she had no visitation rights, she said. 
</P>
<P>
He began the divorce proceedings, she said she learned later, by attempting -- 
unsuccessfully -- to serve her with legal papers in fall 1985 at a society 
luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
The only communication Daniel Broderick had with his ex-wife was through 
lawyers, and she ended up with a "big stack" of letters, she said. She tried to 
complain to him that no lawyer in San Diego would take her case, but he refused 
to listen, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated, in October 1985, she entered her ex-husband's house and rubbed a 
cake made by Kolkena on his bed. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1986, he engineered the court-ordered sale of their house without 
obtaining her signature, a "totally unnecessary, brutal, ugly, bullying thing 
to do," she said. She drove her car into the front door of Dan's new home, for 
which he had her held at a county mental health facility for 72 hours, then had 
her billed for the stay, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was upset," she said about ramming the door. "I'd never done anything like 
that in my life. I needed someone to listen to me." 
</P>
<P>
She added, "I had no one to talk to. I just wanted to talk to Dan." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they saw each other in court. In 1986, the marriage was dissolved but 
without a court order on alimony or custody, she said. 
</P>
<P>
During that year, Daniel Broderick decided when his ex-wife could see their 
children, she said. He paid her "sometimes considerable" voluntary support but 
subtracted sums when she left obscene messages on his answering machine, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One month, she owed him $1,300, he calculated. She said the messages were 
rooted in frustration at not being able to reach her children. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1986, a court ordered him to pay her $12,000 a month, she said. 
The amount was raised to $16,100. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the legal battle was not over. In the first six months of 1987, 
according to defense lawyer Earley, there were 37 legal filings, notices or 
court hearings in the Broderick divorce case, more than one a week.

<P>
Murder defendant Elisabeth Broderick on Tuesday tearfully recounted her failing 
marriage, saying her former husband's criticisms of her as fat and boring 
coincided with his hiring of a young, blonde legal assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick, 42, is charged with fatally shooting her ex-husband, prominent 
medical malpractice lawyer Daniel Broderick III, 44, and his second wife, Linda 
Kolkena Broderick, 28, the legal assistant whom he married after divorcing 
Broderick. 
</P>
<P>
In sobbing testimony, Elisabeth Broderick recounted her early years with her 
former husband as the two struggled to make ends meet while he went through law 
school and medical school. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had four children, and Elisabeth Broderick testified that she 
constantly worked odd jobs at odd hours to help put her husband through school 
and support the family. 
</P>
<P>
The couple settled in San Diego and Daniel Broderick went into private 
practice, eventually becoming very successful. 
</P>
<P>
"His business was booming and blossoming. Both of us in 1982 were euphoric. We 
were celebrating," she said. "We were just real happy. We didn't have to worry 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
But in 1983, Elisabeth Broderick said, marital problems surfaced. She said 
Daniel Broderick suddenly became more distant, aloof. 
</P>
<P>
Later that fall, he hired Linda Kolkena, who had been a receptionist at the 
building that housed Daniel Broderick's law office. 
</P>
<P>
"When I found out who he had hired, I couldn't believe it," Broderick 
testified. "To my knowledge, Linda Kolkena didn't have any experience as a 
legal secretary. She didn't even know how to type and had never graduated from 
high school, I heard." 
</P>
<P>
She testified that she became angry when told her husband and Kolkena had been 
seen at restaurants together. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him he had until Oct. 1 to get rid of that girl or get out of my home," 
she said. "When Oct. 1 came around, he had not done anything and then he said I 
was crazy. Then he began telling me I was boring, older, heavier. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very depressed and very upset. Dan's opinion of me is all I cared 
about," she said. "I lost weight. I tried to be perfect, absolutely, flawlessly 
perfect. He wanted me to be like I used to be when he met me." 
</P>
<P>
Elisabeth Broderick said her despair over the failing marriage drove her to a 
suicide attempt on her birthday in 1983 after her husband failed to show up for 
the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"After the kids went to bed I slit my wrists and swallowed every pill I could 
find in the house," she said. "When Dan found me the next morning he started 
crying. He said he wished I hadn't done that. He said there was nothing going 
on between him and Linda and that I was crazy. I wanted to believe him." 
</P>
<P>
She said that three weeks later, on his birthday, she got dressed up and took a 
bottle of champagne to his office, but she was told that Broderick and Kolkena 
had a small celebration in the office, had gone to lunch and never returned. 
</P>
<P>
Later that evening, Elisabeth Broderick returned home, took some of her 
husband's clothes from his closet and dresser, threw them onto the back yard, 
poured gasoline over them and lit them. 
</P>
<P>
When Broderick returned home that evening, the couple argued. 
</P>
<P>
"He was in shock. He swore up and down there was not and never had been 
anything with Linda Kolkena," Broderick testified. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like an idiot and I believed him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the next two years, she testified, the family had to move out of their La 
Jolla home because of structural damage and moved into a rental home. Daniel 
Broderick later moved out, saying he needed time to himself. 
</P>
<P>
Elisabeth Broderick testified that her husband usually handled financial 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
Her attorney, Jack Earley, has tried to portray Daniel Broderick as shrewd and 
vindictive in attempting to financially cut off his wife, who was receiving 
$16,000 a month in support from her ex-husband. 
</P>
<P>
The couple were divorced in 1986 and battled for the next three years over the 
custody of the two sons, Danny and Rhett, 13 and 10, respectively, at the time 
of the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, who rested their case Monday, have argued that Elisabeth Broderick 
killed the couple out of hate and revenge after a bitter divorce and custody 
battle during which she vandalized her ex-husband's home and left vulgar 
messages on his answering machine.

COLUMBIA PASSES FUEL LEAK TEST; LAUNCH PLANNED FOR DECEMBER

The space shuttle Columbia passed an elaborate fueling test Tuesday after 
months of work to fix dangerous hydrogen leaks, and jubilant NASA officials 
said the craft will be prepared for a December launch. 
</P>
<P>
"We ended up with a tight ship," shuttle director Robert L. Crippen said. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we're concerned right now, Columbia is ready to go fly as soon as we 
put it through its final launch preps." 
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in five months that all three shuttles are clear for 
flight. Atlantis was found to be free of hydrogen leaks during a fueling test 
last week and is scheduled to lift off Nov. 9 with a satellite that reportedly 
will spy on Iraq. The shuttle Discovery completed a successful mission earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
Launch director Bob Sieck said NASA's image is bound to improve now that the 
entire fleet is back in service. 
</P>
<P>
"Launching space shuttles and reputation, they are tied together," Sieck said. 
"Safely and successfully carrying out these missions, which is our goal, is 
only going to help the reputation and our cause to keep the program going." 
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's three-hour test, Columbia's external tank was filled with more 
than 385,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen to pinpoint any more of the dangerous 
leaks that have kept the shuttle grounded since May. A small amount of hydrogen 
escaped into the engine compartment but was well within allowable limits. 
</P>
<P>
It was NASA's most extensive fueling test of a shuttle. Ten TV cameras and 17 
sensors were mounted in the engine compartment, the site of previous leakage. 
</P>
<P>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has tried four times to send 
Columbia on an astronomy mission. New fuel lines were installed after the first 
attempt, but hydrogen later flooded the engine compartment.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: THIS ROSE BOWL STREAK WON'T GO DOWN IN RECORD BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tony Perry 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nothing to hide. Or: a streak of bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State student David Maiolo remembers looking behind him. He figured 
he would see two buddies following his naked lead. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, he just kept running: straight down the middle of the field, end 
zone to end zone, during halftime of the Aztec-UCLA game. The crowd (41,025) at 
the Rose Bowl cheered. 
</P>
<P>
A streaker at a football game! What nostalgia! At last a student with reverence 
for the great horseplay of the past! 
</P>
<P>
A bunch of security guards were less amused. Ditto the Pasadena police and city 
prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
Maiolo, 26, a political science major and president of Delta Upsilon 
fraternity, now faces misdemeanor charges of trespassing, public intoxication 
and indecent exposure. He figures his job as fraternity president is also in 
jeopardy: 
</P>
<P>
"I guess somebody might say this isn't such a good example for the younger 
guys." 
</P>
<P>
He says his 100-yard dash in the buff was spur of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just one of those crazy things, a college prank," he said. "It didn't 
hurt anybody. I think it's one of those things I'm going to be able to laugh 
about someday." 
</P>
<P>
Maiolo has become a minor campus celebrity. He gets knowing winks and 
high-fives wherever he goes. 
</P>
<P>
He's been called San Diego's Naked Chicken. He's thinking of organizing a 
fund-raiser to pay any court fine (he goes to court Nov. 13). 
</P>
<P>
Still, he has no plans for reruns: "This was my first and last time as a 
streaker. I don't want to be known as a streaker." 
</P>
<P>
And he's concerned about what a criminal conviction could do to his dream of a 
career in politics: 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I can't run as a conservative. Maybe I'll have to become a Democrat." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Just Release the Facts, Ma'am 
</P>
<P>
The big news in Rancho Santa Fe is a string of 22 "hot-prowl" burglaries 
starting in mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, the big news was no news for three months because the Rancho 
Santa Fe Patrol opted not to tell reporters about the unusual number of 
break-ins occurring while homeowners were home. 
</P>
<P>
Only in mid-October did patrol chief Matt Wellhouser go public. A few days 
later some of the loot was recovered and a suspect arrested: Felix Alvarez, 26, 
an illegal immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
Wellhouser notes that the patrol is a private security force, not a public 
agency, and thus is under no legal obligation to release crime information. 
</P>
<P>
He adds that many of the wealthy homeowners preferred no publicity about their 
misfortunes and were worried about reprisals: 
</P>
<P>
"People move to Rancho Santa Fe for many reasons. One reason is that they want 
to protect their privacy. As their employee, I have to respect that." 
</P>
<P>
One new resident feels differently. He wrote a stinging letter to the Rancho 
Santa Fe Review. 
</P>
<P>
Burglars don't read newspapers, he said, and don't engage in reprisals: 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody in security protection has a duty to inform the public of the presence 
of a serial 'hot prowl' burglar. They are often armed. The public must be 
warned when such a criminal is at work." 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the views of a newcomer don't mean much in staid Rancho Santa Fe. But 
this letter-writer does have some standing when it comes to crime and crooks: 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles cop-turned-novelist Joseph Wambaugh. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
From Clean Up to Drink Up 
</P>
<P>
Here we go. 
</P>
<P>
* The La Jolla Town Council plans to send scolding letters to homeowners who 
have let their lawns go shaggy, their bushes bushy, etc. 
</P>
<P>
* It pays to have friends in high places. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric ($5,000) and Southern California Edison ($15,000) 
have both made last-minute contributions to the campaign against Propositions 
131 and 140, which would limit the terms of state legislators. 
</P>
<P>
* San Diego Police Chief Bob Burgreen, in a letter to Channel 8, says a cop was 
wrong to stick his hand in front of a camera to block filming of a plane crash

SHIFT IN MOOD OF VOTERS HURTS BATES, AIDS RIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having reaped the benefits of incumbency since 1982, Rep. Jim Bates fears that 
next week's election against former Navy fighter pilot Randall (Duke) 
Cunningham may be one in which the downside to being in office outweighs the 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond his distress over losing weeks of valuable campaign time by being stuck 
in Washington during the recent budget impasse, Bates (D-San Diego) also is 
worried about being caught up in a nationwide backlash against incumbents. 
Heightening those concerns, Bates -- whose 1989 sanction by the House Ethics 
Committee on sexual-harassment charges makes him a target for voters' wrath -- 
has had some of his campaign brochures mailed back to him with pink slips 
attached. 
</P>
<P>
"There's so much public anger out there, and the budget mess just made it worse 
by making us all look like clowns," Bates said. "These groups that talk about 
throwing out all incumbents have really whipped people up. When you start 
getting your mail sent back to you with things like, 'You're through, buddy!' 
written on it, it's time to worry." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, though he is still a slim favorite in his bid for a fifth two-year 
term, Bates' hold on his 44th District seat appears more tenuous than at any 
time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
That makes Bates the exception among San Diego County's four-member 
congressional delegation in the Nov. 6 election. Two GOP incumbents, Ron 
Packard of Carlsbad and Duncan Hunter of Coronado, have drawn only minor-party 
opposition, and a third Republican, Rep. Bill Lowery of San Diego, is a clear 
front-runner against a Democratic challenger whom he has defeated twice before. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, elections in the Bates' 44th District are races in name only. 
Specifically crafted to be "Republican-proof" by the state legislators who drew 
its boundaries, the southern San Diego district -- where Democrats now hold a 
formidable 53%-35% edge among registered voters -- is, under normal 
circumstances, safe political harbor for any Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
But even Bates, who has never received less than 60% of the vote against 
previous GOP opponents, concedes that this is anything but a normal campaign 
for him -- in part because he has had so little time to campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Congress' protracted haggling with the White House over the federal budget kept 
Bates in Washington until last weekend. As Congress' lengthiest pre-election 
session since World War II dragged on, Bates -- an indefatigable campaigner who 
spends endless hours politicking door to door even in non-election years -- 
chafed as he watched his seemingly secure 18-point lead in one September poll 
dwindle to less than half that by mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough when your most valuable asset is 2,000 miles away," grumbled Rick 
Taylor, Bates' campaign consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cunningham complained that Bates' absence scuttled plans for debates, 
the first-time candidate also benefitted from having the district largely to 
himself at a critical stage of the race. 
</P>
<P>
With national party figures aiding both major candidates, Bates and Cunningham 
are each expected to spend about $300,000 by Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to get rid of this rascal," Cunningham said. "My whole life has 
been a matter of overcoming a lot of tough odds. It's looking like that record 
will remain intact." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most decorated Navy pilots in the Vietnam War -- where he became an 
ace by shooting down five enemy planes -- the 48-year-old Cunningham was also 
director of Miramar Naval Air Station's "Top Gun" fighter pilot school, the 
inspiration for the popular film of the same name. Cunningham also achieved 
minor celebrity in the 1980s by accompanying an 11-year-old California pilot 
who duplicated Charles Lindbergh's New York-to-London flight. 
</P>
<P>
A staunch conservative who says he represents "the traditional values lacking 
in Jim Bates," Cunningham drew the attention -- and the strategic and financial 
support -- of national Republican leaders by winning last June's five-candidate 
GOP primary. 
</P>
<P>
Coupled with Bates' own strong primary challenge from lawyer Byron Georgiou, 
the size of the GOP field reinforced party leaders' views about Bates' 
vulnerability. As one also-ran's campaign manager noted wryly, it is not often 
that five Republicans scramble for a nomination that "normally . . . is worth 
about as much as a case of smallpox." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond Cunningham's name recognition and assiduously promoted "right stuff" 
image, the GOP's hopes hinge largely on the prospect of a voter backlash over 
Bates' ethical problems, a prospect that did not materialize in the two races 
since the charges surfaced late in his 1988 reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the House ethics panel sent a "letter of reproval" -- the lightest 
possible sentence -- to Bates over two female staffers' complaints that he 
sexually harassed them by suggestive remarks and gestures, and expected aides 
in his Washington congressional office to solicit campaign contributions, a 
violation of House rules. 
</P>
<P>
Wary of being accused of running a negative campaign, Cunningham frequently 
reminds voters of the episode, though not nearly to the extent that Georgiou or 
Bates' 1988 Republican challenger, Rob Butterfield, did in their losing 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obviously a factor, but we're not dwelling on it," Cunningham said. Even 
so, Cunningham's slogan -- "A Congressman We Can Be Proud Of" -- is a variation 
of Georgiou's theme from last spring. And one of his television ads features a 
woman who identifies herself as a Democrat, saying she "can't support Jim Bates 
(because) he's embarrassed us too many times," a comment that only the most 
politically uninformed viewer would need explained. 
</P>
<P>
Though Bates characterizes the ethics panel's action as "old news" with rapidly 
declining political impact, he acknowledges that the lingering controversy 
leaves him in a weakened position to ward off what many political observers 
predict will be an especially strong anti-incumbent vote nationwide in next 
week's election. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tough year to be an incumbent, and that doesn't make it any easier," 
said the 49-year-old former San Diego councilman and county supervisor. "Some 
people who say they aren't that bothered about the ethics thing or don't even 
have a particular gripe say they're voting against me because they want to get 
rid of all incumbents. How do you fight that?" 
</P>
<P>
Bates' success in responding will figure prominently in deciding whether he 
remains the only Democratic congressman south of Los Angeles, a factor that he 
argues has paid significant dividends for San Diego, given his party's control 
of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
In choosing between Bates and Cunningham, voters can look to stark contrasts in 
the two men's personal backgrounds, political philosophies and positions on 
major issues. Two minor candidates, Libertarian John Wallner and Peace and 
Freedom Party member Donna White, also will appear on the ballot in the 44th 
District, which covers downtown and southern San Diego, extending from Linda 
Vista south to Otay, and also includes Lemon Grove, National City and Chula 
Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Bates' adult life has been spent in public office. Cunningham spent 
most of his in the military, although he was a high school coach and teacher 
before entering the Navy and now heads a small company that markets aviation 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Fiscally conservative but a moderate to liberal on most social issues, 
particularly those of import to the lower middle class, Bates has compiled a 
strong environmental record and played a much-publicized role in exposing 
military procurement excesses during his nearly eight-year congressional 
tenure. In contrast, Cunningham hews to a rigidly conservative line on most 
major issues, as illustrated by his opposition to abortion and gun control, and 
support for a constitutional amendment to ban flag-burning and anti-obscenity 
restrictions on the National Endowment for the Arts, four of many issues on 
which he differs with Bates. 
</P>
<P>
Bates points to his sponsorship of key health and environmental legislation, 
his role in securing funding for expansion of the San Diego Trolley and to 
address the border sewage problem, and his heavy emphasis on constituent 
services. Hoping that his characteristic 12-hour work days will strike a 
responsive chord with his largely working-class constituents, Bates bills 
himself in his own TV ads as someone who is "working hard for you and America . 
. . from sunrise to sunset." 
</P>
<P>
In recognition of the district's lopsided demographics, Bates' past Republican 
challengers often tempered their speech and softened their policy positions in 
an attempt to attract needed Democratic votes. With his blunt rhetoric and 
doctrinaire conservatism, however, Cunningham sometimes seems intent on doing 
precisely the opposite -- a tack that could backfire by aiding Bates' efforts 
to cast him as a "far-right extremist." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Cunningham, a born-again Christian, says of his position on 
flag-burning: "My opponent may accuse me of trying to slip my arm around the 
flag. But there's only one way to wrap the flag or Jesus Christ around you, and 
that's around your entire body." During the primary, Cunningham also was 
roundly denounced for a mailer that seemed to ridicule the Mideastern 
background of his major GOP opponent, an Egyptian-born Armenian. 
</P>
<P>
In his public appearances, Cunningham stresses that he wants to be known as 
"the education congressman," a line borrowed from President Bush's 1988 
campaign, and also cites drug control as a major objective. A frequent speaker 
in schools in the "Say No to Drugs" program, Cunningham also helped Hunter 
draft legislation authorizing the use of military forces in controlling drug 
trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Sensitive to Bates' charge that he would write a blank check for the military, 
Cunningham goes to lengths to demonstrate that his Navy background would not 
give him financial blinders on military spending. "I don't think the (Berlin) 
Wall would have fallen if we hadn't been in a position of strength, but that 
doesn't mean we need a Cadillac system," said Cunningham, who has called for 
cutbacks of U.S. troops in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
With both Bates and Cunningham predicting a close election, the two minor-party 
candidates -- Wallner, an engineer, and bookstore manager White -- could play 
the role of spoilers. In one poll last week, each drew about 4% support -- 
widely seen primarily as anti-incumbent protest votes that, absent the minor 
candidates, probably will go to Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
Of San Diego County's three other congressional races, the only one seriously 
contested is in the 41st District, where Lowery is seeking a sixth term against 
Democrat Dan Kripke, the candidate whom he trounced by 2-to-1 margins in his 
past two reelection campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
For the third time to be the charm for Kripke, the UCSD psychiatrist must hope 
that Lowery, too, becomes a victim of anti-incumbent sentiment in the 
comfortably Republican northern San Diego district, where the GOP holds a 
49%-37% registration edge. Hopeful that Lowery will be "swept out by a wave of 
rightful discontent," Kripke invariably calls him "Incumbent Lowery." 
</P>
<P>
Kripke's campaign is a virtual carbon copy of his 1988 race, in which the 
49-year-old La Jollan lambasted Lowery for his ties to savings and loans. 
</P>
<P>
This spring, Lowery was among a handful of public officials named by the 
Justice Department as unknowing recipients of thousands of dollars in illegal 
corporate donations from Don Dixon, the former owner of Vernon Savings &amp; 
Loan, a failed Texas thrift. Vernon collapsed and was later seized by the 
Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corp. at a cost of about $1.3 billion -- 
one of the most notorious thrift failures in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, Lowery received jet trips, yacht parties and a Del Mar 
fund-raiser valued at about $18,000 from the Vernon executive. From the outset, 
however, Lowery has insisted that he believed that Dixon was spending his 
personal money, not corporate funds -- a position bolstered by the Justice 
Department's declaration that none of the recipients of the funds "engaged in 
any illegal or improper activity." 
</P>
<P>
Kripke, who dismisses that as "a political statement by a Republican attorney 
general," hopes that Dixon's trial in Texas will produce an eleventh-hour 
bombshell to validate his longstanding charge that Lowery "associated with 
crooks and took filthy money." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond pointing to the Justice Department report in his defense, Lowery also 
contends that his campaign paid the plane and yacht expenses, except for the 
latter's chartering cost. In 1988, Lowery also paid $4,000 to the FSLIC to 
cover costs related to the Del Mar fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
The other issue being emphasized by Kripke is the volatile of abortion, which 
Lowery opposes except in cases of rape, incest or threat to the life of the 
mother. His own advocacy of abortion rights, Kripke argues, could enable him to 
attract votes from Republican women. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery, meanwhile, has done little more than go through the motions in his 
low-key campaign, reminding voters of his work on military and environmental 
issues -- notably, his opposition to offshore oil drilling -- throughout his 
decade in Congress. A 43-year-old former San Diego City Councilman, Lowery also 
has helped secure federal funding to address the border sewage problem. 
</P>
<P>
Peace and Freedom Party candidate Karen Works also is on the 41st District 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The county's two other congressional races are electoral formalities in which 
incumbents Packard and Hunter face only token opposition in their campaigns for 
fifth and sixth terms, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
With the Democratic Party having failed to field a candidate in either heavily 
Republican district, Hunter's only opposition in the 45th District is 
Libertarian Joe Shea, while Packard faces Libertarian Richard Arnold and Peace 
and Freedom candidate Doug Hansen in the 43rd District.

NEA-FUNDED ARTISTS CRITICIZE POLICE SHOOTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of local artists has spent federal grant money to rent space on 25 bus 
benches for ads that criticize the use of deadly force by the San Diego Police 
Department, angering the police chief and others. 
</P>
<P>
The art on the benches features the outline of seven human bodies silhouetted 
in black against a red background. Within each human figure is a target, 
similar to those at police shooting ranges. 
</P>
<P>
Within one target is a trowel, within another a baseball bat and within a third 
a garden tool. A pair of upraised hands and a question mark are drawn within 
others. (San Diego police have wounded 14 people and killed nine in shootings 
since the beginning of the year. Among those killed were men wielding a garden 
tool, a trowel and a baseball bat. Another man was unarmed.) 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Bob Burgreen on Tuesday called the ads a "cheap shot that will 
have no impact." He said the motive for the ads is "sour grapes" over the 
failure of last year's Proposition F, a ballot measure that would have given 
wide-ranging powers to an independent police review board. 
</P>
<P>
Callers to local radio talk shows Tuesday appeared overwhelmingly opposed to 
the ads, which attracted the attention of Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Coronado) as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"Duncan has some real concerns about many of the projects funded by the NEA 
(National Endowment for the Arts)," said Frank Collins, a spokesman for Hunter. 
"This is similar to many of the controversial messages brought forth recently 
in NEA-funded work, which hasn't made us very happy. This is the type of ad 
that merits an ongoing review of the NEA." 
</P>
<P>
Although voicing anger at the ads, as did many of his officers, Burgreen said 
he had asked no one to remove the ads, nor would he. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not in a position to be objective on this issue, but absolutely, I support 
their right to free speech," Burgreen said. "I will go to war to protect 
anyone's right of free speech and the right of people to disagree with me and 
others." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Downey, a spokesman for Mayor Maureen O'Connor, echoed the chief, saying 
that, since no city money was spent, "This is a matter between the NEA and 
these artists. It's a federal matter -- their right to say it -- but, of 
course, there is a right to free speech. As far as the shootings are concerned, 
there's an ongoing public forum to address these matters. And we believe the 
process is working." 
</P>
<P>
But the artists involved said "the ongoing public forum" is unacceptable 
because a citizens' review board set up under another ballot measure has "no 
teeth." The artists donated their time to create the ads but said the cost to 
produce them and rent the space -- $3,662.50 -- was paid out of a $12,500 NEA 
grant awarded in 1989 for the funding of "social-protest" art. 
</P>
<P>
Noting the recent national controversy surrounding the NEA and the spending of 
tax dollars on controversial art, local artist Scott Kessler said he and his 
colleagues "knew we were taking a risk." 
</P>
<P>
"The risk is obvious, but yes, the risk was worth it," Kessler said, stating 
that a childhood friend of his, Tony Tumminia, was shot and killed this year 
after a confrontation with police. 
</P>
<P>
The work of Kessler and fellow artists Deborah Small, Elizabeth Sisco and Louis 
Hock has ignited controversy before. A 1988 project by the artists appeared on 
the back of San Diego Transit buses around the time of Super Bowl XXII, which 
was held in San Diego in January of that year.

<P>
Depicting San Diego as "America's Finest Tourist Plantation," the 1988 ads 
protested racism, Small said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the group's NEA grant money also was used last year to suggest a lack 
of public discussion in San Diego during the Soviet Arts Festival, which was 
brought to the city by Mayor O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
The artists said Tuesday that O'Connor and Burgreen tried to have the most 
recent bus-bench ads removed. But Arlan Renfro, the president of Coast United 
Advertising in Commerce -- the company that reproduced the ads -- denied that, 
as did Burgreen. 
</P>
<P>
"Any effort to do that would be viewed as overly defensive," Burgreen said. "I 
believe in speaking my mind but not in being overly defensive." 
</P>
<P>
Renfro said, however, that he had insisted that the ads carry the notation, " 
'Partially funded through a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts' . . 
. to protect ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Small said that, if the NEA "and its problems" became the focus of the 
bus-bench campaign it would be the fault of the media and not the artists. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the focus to be on police practices, a weak citizens' review board, no 
investigative powers, no power to subpoena witnesses . . . ," Small said. "But, 
we can't control what you people write. Do I think tax dollars should fund the 
NEA? Obviously, that's why we got the grant." 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen said he and the department are diligently researching the issue of 
deadly force and how to best control it. 
</P>
<P>
"We've spent a lot of time and effort to do the most thorough study on the use 
of deadly force that's ever been assembled in this country," the chief said. 
"We're concerned about the issue, and the community knows we're concerned. But 
those ads are a cheap shot that won't have an impact on me or how I do my job 
or on how my officers do theirs. It isn't the first time we've been 
cheap-shotted, and it won't be the last." 
</P>
<P>
Andrea Skorepa, chairwoman of the citizens' advisory board on police-community 
relations, said she supports the ads because they "provoke thought, which is 
what we need and which is the function of art anyway, isn't it? Especially 
public art. The ads should help to provoke dialogue in a community that 
desperately needs it." 
</P>
<P>
Skorepa said she feels "empathy" for the police, who say the streets have never 
been more dangerous. "But, at the same time," she said, "we have the right to 
establish our own values and standards about police conduct. It's important to 
give our officers as many options and good training methods as we can give 
them. I want their skills to be at a peak, so that they might avoid shooting at 
someone . . . who has no intention of killing them."

CITY OKS PLAN TO TREAT BORDER SEWAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prompted by growing concerns for public health, the San Diego City Council and 
county, state and federal authorities agreed Tuesday to seek funding for an 
immediate solution to the festering sewage problem in the Tijuana River Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for raw Mexican sewage to be piped from the river valley to the 
city's Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant beginning in about six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Initial cost of the project is expected to be about $500,000, with annual 
operating expenses running more than $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear exactly how the financing would be distributed among the 
participating agencies: the U.S. and Mexican governments, the state of 
California, San Diego County and the city of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The state and federal governments are expected to shoulder nearly all expenses, 
but if there is a shortfall of that funding, San Diegans could be hit with 
another rate increase, said Roger Frauenfelder, deputy city manager. Local 
residents already face higher sewage bills to pay for a planned $2.8-billion 
upgrade of the Point Loma plant and the city's overall sewage system. 
</P>
<P>
More than three dozen South Bay residents packed council chambers Tuesday, 
heckling, shouting, urging council members to approve the plan and finally 
breaking into thunderous applause when the unanimous vote came through. 
</P>
<P>
Residents complained bitterly and area public health officials warned that the 
raw sewage is not only an aesthetic nuisance but is attracting an increasing 
number of mosquitoes that can transmit malaria and encephalitis. 
</P>
<P>
The project is an interim solution until the mid-1990s when the United States 
and Mexico are expected to complete construction of a joint treatment plant to 
handle the Tijuana River Valley sewage problem. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal: 
</P>
<P>
* A pumping station will be installed near the international border and a 
pipeline will carry up to 14-million gallons of raw Mexican sewage to the Point 
Loma plant daily. 
</P>
<P>
* No fines or penalties would be imposed against San Diego by state and federal 
regulatory agencies for discharge permit violations or sewage flows exceeding 
capacity limits. 
</P>
<P>
* The Mexican sewage would be stopped if the treatment plant reaches capacity. 
</P>
<P>
* The U.S. government will be responsible for collecting and disposing of 
leftover sludge. 
</P>
<P>
* The city of San Diego will not be liable under any lawsuits resulting from 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
At the council meeting, Mayor Maureen O'Connor took the most heckling, mostly 
from a woman who was angered by the mayor's apparent reluctance to support the 
project without specific financial commitments from the county, state and 
federal governments. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, lady, you try living down there with all that stinking mess and see how 
you like it!" the woman screamed at the mayor in one outburst. 
</P>
<P>
Defending her record on environmental issues, O'Connor repeatedly banged her 
gavel in an effort to control the constant interruptions from the audience, 
which quieted periodically until inflamed again. 
</P>
<P>
Untreated Mexican sewage has been flowing across the border for decades, but 
Tijuana's growing inability to handle its waste water has become a crisis. Once 
a periodic problem, it has escalated into a potential health threat of massive 
proportions, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987 the amount of raw sewage in the Tijuana River Valley has increased 
from 6 million gallons per day to as much as 12 million gallons, city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego has treated Mexican sewage on an emergency basis in the past. But 
that system, which is capable of handling about 13 million gallons of sewage 
daily, has been shut down because of diminished capacity, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have expressed concern that the influx of new sewage into the 
Point Loma plant will push the facility to capacity, which could prompt 
regulatory agencies to threaten building moratoriums.

ENCINITAS SENDS BILL FOR MIGRANT EXPENSES TO U.S. GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Encinitas on Monday sent a $281,695.25 bill to the U.S. General 
Accounting Office in Washington for money spent trying to cope with a migrant 
laborer problem for which local officials blame the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
A letter sent to Charles A. Bowsher in the GAO's Office of the Comptroller 
General by Encinitas Mayor Pamela Slater warned that attempts to deal with the 
thousands of both legal and illegal farm laborers who now make their home 
within its boundaries have pushed the city to the breaking point. 
</P>
<P>
"If resolve cannot be found," the letter concludes, "the problems of illegal 
encampments, open fires, increase in crime, exploitation of workers and 
increased community tensions will only escalate to insurmountable levels." 
</P>
<P>
The letter is part of a continuing city strategy to force both state and 
federal officials to acknowledge blame for immigration policies and practices 
that have led to an influx of migrant workers to such cities as Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Encinitas became the first city in California to declare a state of 
local emergency because of migrant laborers. Since then, however, few solutions 
have come from either Washington or Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
So last week, officials decided to send the federal government a bill to make 
its point. 
</P>
<P>
"You're darned right this is a bill," said Councilwoman Anne Omsted. "This is a 
dead serious request for money from the feds. It's also a way for us to say, 
'Hey, you guys! Wake up and see what's going on in little communities like 
Encinitas." 
</P>
<P>
City expenses have included a hiring hall for legal workers, designed to keep 
job-seekers off sidewalks and private property, a raid on an encampment of 
migrant workers and security guards to keep them off the property, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cleve Corlett, director for public affairs for the General Accounting Office in 
Washington, said he hadn't seen the letter. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know how many pieces of correspondence we get every day?" he said with 
a laugh. "This certainly is a new one on me." 
</P>
<P>
Corlett said he could not say whether the General Accounting Office could 
respond to Encinitas' request until the agency had received the letter. 
</P>
<P>
City officials acknowledged Tuesday that a week after Congress painfully 
hammered out a new federal budget aimed at reducing a spiraling federal deficit 
is not the best time to request money from the government. 
</P>
<P>
Their aim, they say, is to receive some of the more than $1 billion in State 
Legalization Impact Assistance Grants already earmarked through the 1987 
Immigration Reform and Control Act to help cities defray such costs -- funds 
they say are bogged down helplessly in red tape. 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't believe the red tape we've had to go through, trying to get 
federal money already outlined to do this job," Omsted said. "The feds tell us 
one thing, and the state agency which disperses the funds tells us another." 
</P>
<P>
Added Mayor Pam Slater: "It's around and around in circles. And we've got a 
real problem here. This is no fantasy we're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Epstein, special assistant to the Health and Welfare Agency, the lead 
state agency in implementing the immigration-related funds, called the city's 
letter "silly." 
</P>
<P>
"It's inappropriate, even naive, for them to send a letter like that to 
Washington," he said. "Cities just don't write a letter to the GAO and make 
demands for funds. There's an approved process for receiving SLIAG funds and 
they know that." 
</P>
<P>
Epstein said the city is confused over many of the requirements to receive such 
money. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone is Encinitas has demonstrated a skill in confusing and distorting a 
not-so-complicated process," he said. "I just get impatient about this. My 
experience in dealing with Encinitas is that they roll their requests into one 
big ball and talk about migrant services. That just doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to talk in specific services you're looking for compensation for. And 
there are some services there is no money for, programs such as fighting crime. 
The city doesn't seem to understand that SLIAG is not the only funding source 
for their problems." 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Carranza, transients issues coordinator for the city, said the bill 
accounts for numerous expenses the city has suffered since December, 1988, when 
her office was formed. 
</P>
<P>
The bill includes $118,428.72 for the operation of the transients program 
designed to bridge relations between migrants and other citizens by citing 
necessary programs. It includes $49,597.04 for a year-old job center the city 
has operated to help documented laborers find work. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also includes $57,330.44 to pay for the cleanup of an encampment of 
Guatemalans on city-owned land near Interstate 5. City funds have also paid for 
subsequent security to keep the migrants away from the camp, located behind the 
Big Bear supermarket on Encinitas Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"This won't be the last bill, either," Carranza said. "As other expenditures 
become known, we'll send them along. They'll probably get a bill from Encinitas 
every six months or so." 
</P>
<P>
Added Councilwoman Gail Hugo: "And if they don't send the money now, if we have 
to wait six months for it, we plan to charge them interest. The federal 
government just has to be held responsible." 
</P>
<P>
In its letter to Washington, the city placed the blame where it believes it 
belongs. 
</P>
<P>
"If the federal government, i.e. the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization 
Service and the U.S. Border Patrol, could control our southern border, as well 
as keep undocumented persons out of the city . . . the expenditures that the 
city of Encinitas has incurred would not have been necessary." 
</P>
<P>
John Weil, district chief of staff for Congressman Ron Packard (R-Oceanside), 
whose district encompasses Encinitas, said he supports the city's concern -- 
acknowledging that "local municipalities have had to bear the brunt of the 
illegal immigration." 
</P>
<P>
Packard, he said, had unsuccessfully tried to draft language into a recent 
immigration bill that would have required the federal government to set aside 
additional money to reimburse local governments for such costs. 
</P>
<P>
"Wow that's a lot of money," Weil said, referring to the city's $281,695.25 
bill. "I wonder where they came up with the quarter?"

LANDFILL FOES ATTACK STUDY OF 3 CANYONS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: POLITICIANS JOIN HOMEOWNERS IN PROTESTING A COUNTY REPORT NAMING 
AREAS IN THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS AS POSSIBLE DUMPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
About 200 homeowners, schoolchildren and politicians met at a scenic spot off 
Mulholland Drive on Tuesday to condemn a county report naming three Santa 
Monica Mountains canyons as potential landfill sites. 
</P>
<P>
With placards declaring "It Stinks" and other angry slogans, the landfill 
opponents cheered elected officials who threatened legal and legislative action 
if the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts dump garbage in Mission, Rustic 
and Sullivan canyons. 
</P>
<P>
"I am absolutely appalled that anybody would think we need anything like a dump 
site here," state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), told the gathering 
near the Bel-Air Skycrest subdivision. "I am going to do everything I possibly 
can to prevent this from happening." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles), through a spokeswoman, called on 
sanitation officials to cross the West Los Angeles canyons off their landfill 
list and said their use would violate a federal law protecting land in national 
parks from being used for garbage dumps. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Sanitation Districts own Rustic and Sullivan canyons and Los 
Angeles County owns Mission Canyon, all three lie within the boundaries of the 
Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, which just received $12 
million in federal funds for land acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
The Sanitation Districts have pledged that the three Westside canyons would be 
exempt from landfill development if the Santa Clarita Valley's Elsmere Canyon 
becomes a regional garbage dump. But protesters said Tuesday that they were 
alarmed that a recent study still lists Mission, Rustic and Sullivan canyons -- 
situated between the affluent communities of Encino, Bel-Air, Brentwood and 
Pacific Palisades -- as possible landfill sites. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy, accused the Sanitation Districts of "trying to splinter the forces 
against landfills" by making the Westside canyons' exemption contingent upon 
the development of a landfill in Elsmere Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Towsley Canyon, also in the Santa Clarita Valley, and Blind Canyon, in the 
Santa Susana Mountains above Chatsworth, are also named as possible landfill 
sites in the study. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial study, a draft environmental impact report on a countywide 
trash-management plan, has been the subject of continuing public hearings since 
its release Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Grace Chan, the Sanitation Districts planner who supervised the study, said 
public comments will be accepted until Dec. 3, after which the report will be 
completed and submitted to the Sanitation Districts' Board of Directors for 
final approval. The deadline for public response had been tomorrow, the reason 
for Tuesday's rally. 
</P>
<P>
Chan said the report also addresses recycling trash and hauling it to remote 
areas by train. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Terry D. Friedman (D-Los Angeles), City Councilman Marvin Braude, 
and David Gackenbach, superintendent of the national recreation area were among 
the officials present. 
</P>
<P>
About 22 fifth-graders from the private Westland School, adjacent to Mission 
Canyon, attended to call attention to the potential health hazards of a 
landfill.

SUPERVISORS STUDY BAN ON L.A. TRUCKS AT CALABASAS DUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County supervisors on Tuesday requested a study to determine the 
effects of a plan to close the Calabasas landfill to trash hauled by Los 
Angeles city trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors also agreed to consider preventing communities that have not dumped 
garbage at the Calabasas landfill in the past from doing so in the future, said 
Judy Hammond, an aide to Supervisor Pete Schabarum. The county dump 
historically has been a disposal site for areas west of the San Diego Freeway 
and south of the Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The two actions were taken after a closed-door session to discuss litigation 
that could arise if the board adopted Supervisor Mike Antonovich's proposal to 
close the landfill to trash generated within the city. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich's proposal was made Oct. 2 after the city killed a plan by 
Browning-Ferris Industries to expand the company's Sunshine Canyon Landfill 
above Granada Hills, and the company cut back dumping limits there from 3,000 
tons a day to 700 tons a day. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich's aides said the supervisor was concerned that the Calabasas 
landfill could fill more rapidly as Valley-area haulers looked for alternative 
dumps. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Vannatta, an Antonovich aide, said Tuesday that Antonovich wants to be 
sure there is enough space in the landfill to accommodate trash from 
unincorporated county areas and smaller cities in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
About 75% of the 3,000 tons of trash dumped in the Calabasas landfill each day 
is from the city. One-third of the city trash is carried in trucks owned by the 
city Bureau of Sanitation, and the rest is brought by private haulers. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich had initially proposed closing the landfill to all city trash. But 
the supervisors instead opted to study a modified plan that would prevent only 
city-owned trucks from dumping there. 
</P>
<P>
The study -- an environmental assessment -- could preclude the need for a more 
detailed environmental impact report reviewing the effects the reductions would 
have throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Alpern, assistant director of the city's Bureau of Sanitation, said it 
was unfortunate that the supervisors took action without giving city officials 
an opportunity to defend their decision not to permit the Sunshine Canyon 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Alpern said the proposal was dropped after a "rigorous planning evaluation" 
concluded that it was not in the community's best interest to allow 
Browning-Ferris to exceed the height limits set forth in its conditional use 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
"Seems like the city didn't get its day in court," Alpern said. 
</P>
<P>
Vannatta, however, said he believed that city sanitation officials were aware 
that the county was considering the measure and could have attended the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Alpern said that if the county does bar city-owned trucks from Calabasas, the 
city will be forced to find alternative sites, which he said would probably be 
more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that despite the board's action, city and county officials will 
continue to work together to try to solve the region's long-range problem of 
garbage disposal.

FORECAST IS IFFY, BUT IT LOOKS AS IF HALLOWEEN WILL BE DRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two storms may still bring rain late tonight and Thursday, but trick or 
treaters will probably stay dry, according to the National Weather Service in 
San Diego. But rising tides have put a new wrinkle in the weather picture. 
</P>
<P>
Hurricane Trudy, about 800 miles south of San Diego, has been downgraded to a 
tropical storm. Forecaster Wilbur Shigehara said: "The storm will dump most of 
its rain over northern Baja and blow clouds our way." 
</P>
<P>
A storm brewing in the Gulf of Alaska will spread nearly half an inch of rain 
over Northern California but will weaken by the time it reaches Point 
Conception near Santa Barbara, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight will turn cloudy and cool, with temperatures in the 60s and a 20% 
chance of rain, he said. Winds are expected to gust up to 25-30 m.p.h. in the 
mountains through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Daytime temperatures will hover in the 70s this week with a weak Santa Ana 
condition warming the county this weekend, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
The weather service is keeping an eye on the rising tides, surf and winds. 
Tropical storm Trudy has pushed the surf up to 5 feet, and the highest high 
tide will take it to 6.3 feet today, 7.5 feet on Sunday. 
</P>

Waves are not expected to spill over into coastal areas, but forecasters are 
watching the situation, he said. "With the winds, the seas may be rough, but 
the winds will turn lighter by the weekend," Shigehara said.

Anita M. Green, president of Shir Chadash -- The New Reform Congregation in 
Encino, who campaigned for a synagogue in Woodland Hills, has died in a North 
Hollywood hospital. She was 42. 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Green of Encino died Saturday from a gunshot wound suffered Thursday 
morning. Police said a motorcyclist shot her once as she drove her Corvette 
into a parking lot behind a North Hollywood tax consulting business owned by 
her husband, Melvin Green. Police have made no arrests in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The daughter of Holocaust survivors, she was born Jan. 30, 1948, in New York 
City. Ms. Green was a founding member of the 8-year-old congregation and had 
served as its lay president since 1987, Rabbi Steven Jacobs said. Two weeks 
ago, Ms. Green and her mother participated in a groundbreaking ceremony for the 
Woodland Hills temple. 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Green was active with the Jewish Reform movement in Israel and was involved 
with Central American refugee support programs, Jacobs said.

SECOND SUSPECT IN SHOOTING AT POINT LOMA CLUB SURRENDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Navy man wanted in the fatal shooting of a 20-year-old woman at a 
Point Loma nightclub surrendered to police Tuesday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Willie J. Pitts, 22, of San Diego, had notified police he would be turning 
himself in before arriving at police headquarters Tuesday afternoon accompanied 
by his attorney, police spokesman Lt. Dan Berglund said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's being processed, and he'll be charged with murder and assault with a 
deadly weapon," Berglund said. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, police arrested another man in connection with the drive-by shooting 
at Rasputin's Disco and Nightclub that left one person dead and three others 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Petty Officer 3rd Class Patrick Daniel Wallace, 24, was in custody on a murder 
charge. A .41-caliber magnum revolver used in the shooting early Sunday morning 
has not been recovered, Berglund said. 
</P>
<P>
Pitts and Wallace, who is stationed in San Diego, reportedly were kicked out of 
the after-hours dance club twice for causing a disturbance. About 45 minutes 
after their last ejection, the two allegedly returned in a car and opened fire 
on the club's security personnel in retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
None of the staff was hit, but shots then were fired through a stained-glass 
window at the rear of the club. 
</P>
<P>
Tanya Elise Shaw, who was standing inside the club, was struck twice, once in 
the head, and died several hours later at UC San Diego Medical Center. She was 
a native of Buffalo, N.Y., and a data-processing seaman stationed at the San 
Diego Naval Training Center for the past four months. 
</P>
<P>
Three others were injured. 
</P>
<P>
Petty Officer 2nd Class Jerome Wood, 21, a native of Bristol, Pa., and an 
electrician's mate at the Naval Training Center, was wounded in the neck. He 
was treated and released from the same hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Two people who were standing with Shaw and Wood in the dance club received 
minor wounds, police said. Their names have not been released.

IT GETS WORSE FOR RAMS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: WHEN THEIR PLANE IS FORCED TO MAKE PRECAUTIONARY LANDING, THEIR 
41-10 LOSS IS PUT IN NEW PERSPECTIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a season full of malfunctions, aborted takeoffs and futile, prolonged 
efforts at repair, it figured: The Rams were felled by breakdowns again. 
</P>
<P>
First, they had to endure a 41-10 destruction by the Pittsburgh Steelers Monday 
night at Three Rivers Stadium, dropping their record to 2-5 and their playoff 
hopes to near-extinction. 
</P>
<P>
Then their long, painful night's journey into day got worse. If there is a 
night that capsulizes their season-long nightmare, this was it. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a problem with the landing gear detected after takeoff early Tuesday 
in Pittsburgh, the Rams' chartered jet was forced to make a "precautionary" 
landing in Cleveland -- without anyone knowing whether the landing gear would 
work properly. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, a 2-5 record and the darkening of the playoff picture were the least 
of their worries. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we were all happy we were alive," Coach John Robinson said Tuesday 
afternoon. "There was some question whether the landing gear was stuck, and 
obviously there was some concern when we were trying to land. 
</P>
<P>
"When they say we're jettisoning the fuel, trying to land in Cleveland . . . I 
think it gave a lot of people at least some sense of perspective in regard to 
their life." 
</P>
<P>
The plane landed safely, but all attempts to fix the mechanical breakdown went 
for naught, and after several hours, the Rams and all their equipment had to be 
transferred to another plane. When they finally arrived at LAX, it was 9:45 
a.m. Tuesday, 5 1/2 hours past their scheduled arrival time. 
</P>
<P>
Then all they had to do was get to sleep and wake up to dreary reality -- after 
Monday night's debacle, the Rams are looking at a season in which an 8-8 record 
seems relatively optimistic. Their five losses already match last season's 
total. 
</P>
<P>
Their schedule doesn't get easier. In three of the next four games, they face 
the Houston Oilers, New York Giants and San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
A few players conceded that the playoffs are a longshot for them, and they 
might be playing the rest of the season for pride. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, who along with his staff didn't get to sleep at all Tuesday because 
they had to start breaking down film, chose not to address that subject head-on 
while acknowledging that the team has a long, long way to go. 
</P>
<P>
"When things are going at the way they're going, I think we're looking for more 
basic things," Robinson said. "We just need to get back to playing good 
football. Making some judgment as to where we stand relative to other teams, 
that's not particularly relevant to us right now." 
</P>
<P>
The loss to Pittsburgh came at a particularly devastating time for the Rams, a 
week after they thought they had turned the corner by beating the Atlanta 
Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
One minor benefit of the 5 1/2-hour delay was that it gave the coaches an easy 
excuse -- lack of time -- to avoid showing the team the film from Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Does the Pittsburgh pounding put the Rams back at rock-bottom emotionally? Is 
the season over? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have an assesment of our football team," Robinson said. "Last I saw 
them, they were all sleeping on the airplane. And I haven't slept for 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's clear, though, that we have to begin to do something. I mean, one 
good game . . . There's some fundamental things we've got to try to get back in 
as we go on down the road. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear, the ills we have now were not solved by the one game. And I think 
it's particularly disturbing to me that two similar teams, Chicago and 
Pittsburgh, dominated us." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks before, the Bears, who play the physical kind of game favored by the 
Steelers, routed the Rams, 38-9, making the combined score in those two Ram 
losses 79-19. 
</P>
<P>
In both games, the Rams' offense seemed to get knocked off stride by aggressive 
defensive play. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night, it resulted in three fumbles by running back Cleveland Gary, two 
interceptions thrown by Jim Everett, several key penalties and zero offensive 
touchdowns for the first time in two seasons. Everett also failed to throw a 
touchdown pass for the first time since October of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said he pulled Gary out of the game after his third fumble because he 
didn't want Gary to "disintegrate" and he thought Gary was "out of control" 
trying to make a big play every time he touched the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"Last night was a bitter disappointment to us," Robinson said. "We thought we 
were well prepared to play the game. We felt we had a good week of practice, 
and we just disintegrated once the game started. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not playing the game very physically -- we are getting beat off the 
ball, getting beat to the punch by the other side. I thought this game was 
somewhat like Chicago in that we were the hittee instead of the hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"Before we are able to accomplish anything, we are going to have to change that 
part of our game." 
</P>
<P>
And how does a team go about fixing this problem? Robinson did not have any 
specific solutions, but he did say that it could be time to get rookies such as 
safety Pat Terrell and guard Bern Brostek into the lineup more frequently. 
</P>
<P>
"They're good football players," Robinson said, "and we're having trouble 
putting anything together. And we need to look at people who are willing to 
play this game physically."

FOOTBALL: KOPP IS A STAR AT PACIFIC, BUT HE RECALLS TOLL HIS FAMILY'S FINANCIAL 
RUIN TOOK DURING PREP DAYS IN MISSION VIEJO.

<P>
Is there anyone in Mission Viejo who can explain the concept of "The California 
Promise" to Troy Kopp? Who is available in that affluent community with its 
snappy marketing slogan to tell Kopp why his family -- once a middle-class, 
three-kids-and-a-station-wagon cliche -- fell hard through the cracks? 
</P>
<P>
How did one of Orange County's finest quarterbacks manage to get through four 
years at Mission Viejo High School while living in public parks and in 
teammates' homes? And how did he ever keep it such a secret for so long? 
</P>
<P>
Kopp is here now, far from Mission Viejo and its ugly memories. The sophomore 
quarterback is working hard, setting slews of NCAA passing records at 
University of the Pacific. He is working hard, too, at reversing the events 
that dragged him and his family to homelessness and despair in the cushioned 
lap of luxury. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo, with its sparkling swimming pools and master-planned housing 
tracts, meanders across the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains in south 
Orange County. Incorporated for only two years, the city of Mission Viejo is 
already one of the richest communities in one of California's richest counties. 
</P>
<P>
Its average household income is $64,327. Unemployment, always such an untidy 
thing, is at 1.9%. Mission Viejo's Socioeconomic Status Score, a demographic 
indicator of affluence and quality of life, is 90. The United States as a whole 
is assigned a score of 53. 
</P>
<P>
It was in that comfy setting that Troy Kopp came into his athletic maturity and 
fell out with his emotional stability. Speaking publicly for the first time 
about the years-long struggle with his family's financial ruin and eventual 
homelessness, Kopp, 19, said he is at last coming to terms with separation from 
his family and the imprint the last six years have left on him. 
</P>
<P>
"When I grew up, until the age of 13, everything was rosy," Kopp said recently 
on the UOP campus. "My dad had a solid job. We were well off. My mom didn't 
have to work. 
</P>
<P>
"Then there were some bad investments. The business (his father) was in went 
under. It was like a depression. From then on, he just couldn't find himself. 
For about five years he was kind of lost. I feel bad for him. My parents 
struggled. It hurt. It was hard." 
</P>
<P>
The financial strain wrought emotional strain as well. Kopp's family was having 
a hard time staying together. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Kopp, the father, began to get odd jobs. He managed a hotel in Dana Point 
and moved his family into one of the rooms. 
</P>
<P>
When Troy was ready to enroll in high school, he wanted to go to Mission Viejo 
High, in the district where the family had lived before. To do that, Troy left 
his parents and his younger brothers, Travis and Trevor, and went to stay with 
a succession of families, most of whom had sons on the football team. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke to his parents by phone and saw them at the football and baseball 
games in which he was becoming an increasingly bigger star. The family, though, 
continued to bounce from place to place and Troy continued to live with 
different families. He also kept secret why he never had any money, why he 
didn't have a car or even a driver's license, why he had to make excuses for 
not doing things with his friends that cost money. 
</P>
<P>
A car -- the teen-ager's symbol of independence and freedom -- was not a 
realistic option for Kopp. He bummed rides to and from school and relied on his 
friends to take him and his dates out. At a high school whose teen-agers are 
symbols of conspicuous consumption, Kopp was conspicuous in his parsimony. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Drake, Mission Viejo's baseball coach and assistant football coach, was 
among the few coaches and administrators who knew Troy's secret. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard for him to get around," Drake said. "It's tough, not having a 
couple of bucks in your pocket. It's tough when you're growing up in Mission 
Viejo and other kids aren't in the same situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I can remember some bad things. I can remember Troy taking his shower in the 
locker room every morning. He has not led an easy 19 years. Character building? 
I don't know if that situation helps anybody, to tell you the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Drake, whom Kopp says was like a father to him, tried to guide Troy. Kopp the 
athlete was maturing far faster than Kopp the young man, and Drake knew that 
the emotional fallout of Kopp's estrangement from his family would surely find 
a hold deep within him and surface in odd and sudden ways. A 15- or 16-year-old 
can hold only so much in before it must come out. Kopp had sports to channel 
his anger and frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"Troy's real headstrong," Drake said. "As an athlete, he was very emotional. He 
had the emotional intensity of a defensive lineman. He'd drip adrenaline before 
a game. He'd sure get everybody's attention in a huddle, I'll tell you." 
</P>
<P>
Aggression and intensity are not automatically bad things in sports, if they 
can be harnessed. But Kopp's emotions sometimes affected his behavior off the 
field. His defense mechanism in dealing with his pain was to pretend he wasn't 
feeling it. If you don't care about anything, then nothing can hurt you. 
</P>
<P>
Kopp lived with the Higashi family in his senior year at Mission Viejo. Jim 
Higashi was the team's running back and shared his room at home with Kopp. 
Higashi said Kopp trod an emotionally rocky road at times. 
</P>
<P>
"It all made him a tougher person. It made him keep going on in his life," said 
Higashi, who attends UC Santa Barbara. "Our family tried to give him a normal 
situation. His parents were not in the best situation. His dad had bad habits 
and he lost everything. A lot of people (at school) knew he wasn't with his 
family, but few knew the whole story. Troy didn't want people to feel sorry for 
him. He became a little more reckless in his life. He didn't care." 
</P>
<P>
Lacking a family life, Kopp poured himself into sports. He excelled at baseball 
with a powerful arm that made him a successful pitcher. Baseball was his first 
sport, the one thing he could do that pleased his father. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad taught me everything about baseball," Kopp said. "He used to work with 
me every day when I was little. Every day I wanted to go hit, he would throw 
pitches to me. He coached my Little League team. He was always there. 
Everything was working out. Then, everything started going wrong. Something hit 
him." 
</P>
<P>
After a mediocre start in football as a freshman, Kopp grew into a fiery, 
stubborn quarterback who, when he had to scramble with the ball, refused to run 
out of bounds or slide to the ground to avoid a hard tackle. 
</P>
<P>
At 6 feet 2 and 200 pounds, Kopp was the top-rated passer in Orange County in 
1988 and All-Southern Section in baseball and football. He was considered a 
major league baseball prospect as a catcher but hoped to get a scholarship to 
play football. For reasons still unknown to Kopp, he was not heavily recruited. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a lot of mail . . . everyone does," he said. "I thought there would be a 
lot of schools interested in me, but there weren't. It was really hard. It 
killed me. I thought, 'I worked this hard, I think I did well. I thought I was 
as good as the guys who went to the big schools.' " 
</P>
<P>
Kopp doesn't know why he was snubbed, but he uses the memory for motivation. He 
goes into each game with the goal, hoping to prove that other colleges made a 
mistake in not offering him a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
When Walt Harris offered him a scholarship to Pacific, Kopp accepted, 
thankfully. But when Kopp arrived in Stockton last year with a bad attitude to 
go with his big arm, Harris got on Kopp's back and never got off. 
</P>
<P>
"We did butt heads a lot in his freshman year," Harris said, laughing at the 
understatement. "But I had a lot of confidence in Troy. I believed real 
strongly that he was a good kid. He didn't talk much. I was able to communicate 
with him through a support group of friends and coaches, and he was able to 
communicate with me. 
</P>
<P>
"I think his biggest problem is that he has a short fuse, which stubborn, 
strong-willed persons do. At times, I do, too. So there's two hard-heads going 
at it. 
</P>
<P>
"But he withstood it and battled through it. He's a way better man and a way 
better quarterback than he would have been if it had happened in his junior 
year. But it hit him right between the eyes. He reared back on it. He didn't 
like it much." 
</P>
<P>
Kopp, who had experienced only a modest amount of parental supervision, had 
trouble understanding that evenhanded discipline is often dispensed out of 
love, not malice. He simply didn't want anyone telling him what to do. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not used to having a dad, or someone who is constantly on you," Kopp said. 
"Sometimes when I get a coach who is just on me, on me, on me, I'm like, 'Get 
off my back.' That's still a fault I have. 
</P>
<P>
"I know Coach Harris is really patient with me. I've never had someone in my 
life who was constantly on me, like, 'You're grounded.' Sometimes when it 
happens I just want to be left alone. I've had some wild times in my life. 
Those are all in the past. That's over." 
</P>
<P>
Kopp's impatience flared this season, though, after he hurt his left 
(non-throwing) shoulder in the first game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
After sitting out two games, Kopp expected to return as the starting 
quarterback, even though he wasn't fully effective. The Monday before Pacific 
played Cal State Long Beach last month, Kopp quit the team. He told Harris that 
he couldn't accept not starting and was impatient with his injury. 
</P>
<P>
Harris told Kopp to stop putting so much pressure on himself and things would 
happen. Kopp got into the game at Long Beach after two quarters and won his 
starting job back. 
</P>
<P>
Financial considerations almost led to his signing with baseball's Montreal 
Expos -- Kopp was selected in the 12th round of last spring's amateur draft. 
Harris said he was sure that Kopp would sign, and Kopp said that it was the 
thought of earning a paycheck immediately that nearly swayed him to turn pro. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the signing bonus of $5,000 was too small to outweigh the benefit 
of staying in school, Kopp said. After deciding to return to UOP, he spent the 
summer working out in Stockton and, along the way, made a decision. 'Home' 
would now be school, not Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
So, Kopp is settling in here and says he will spend his holidays and summers 
here, with only brief visits to his mother and brothers. 
</P>
<P>
His father is in Wisconsin, putting his life back together, Kopp says. His 
mother has a job. Travis is a sophomore running back at Mission Viejo High and 
Trevor likes to surf. Normality is creeping back in. The pain is ebbing. 
</P>
<P>
But the family is still a long way from realizing Mission Viejo's promises. 
Kopp, with his new perspective of time and distance, sees it now as just a 
dream deferred, not disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been difficult," Kopp said. "It's been really difficult. But it has given 
me my motivation in sports. I knew it was my only way out. It still motivates 
me every day to think of my brothers and my mom. I just want to work hard so I 
can help them out. That's my major motivation right now. 
</P>
<P>
"Because my brothers never had the chances that I had, I want to make something 
of myself to help them and my mom. Just to make everything better." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

Coach Dan Henning said Tuesday that "it's feasible" for the Chargers to be in 
the playoffs this season. 
</P>
<P>
He did not say if he also has been advised privately that the rest of the 
country will soon be overrun by killer bees. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers are 3-5 on this Halloween, and unless they are allowed to dress in 
costume as the San Francisco 49ers for the rest of the season, do you really 
think they have the look of playoff contenders? 
</P>
<P>
"It's feasible," Henning said. "We have to stay at the top of the pack of the 
18 teams that started off last week with three wins or less." 
</P>
<P>
You can see how long it has been since the Chargers made it to the playoffs. 
They don't even have a grasp of the rules on what it takes to get there. 
</P>
<P>
There are only 14 teams in the American Football Conference, and every team in 
the NFC could finish with a worse record than Henning's Chargers, and it 
wouldn't make any difference. 
</P>
<P>
The top six teams in the AFC will advance to the playoffs, and presently there 
are nine teams in the AFC with a better mark than the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to win, we have to continue to win to stay in there," Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
Now how feasible is that? 
</P>
<P>
What happened to the fifth-place schedule that was going to make the Chargers 
fat and sassy this season? What happened to the defense that was going to buy 
time for a developing offense? What happened to Bobby Beathard? 
</P>
<P>
At the midway mark of the season, the Chargers have compiled three victories. 
And these victories have come against the 2-6 Browns, the 3-5 Jets, and the 4-4 
Bucs, who traveled across America without their starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
In making their stretch run, the Chargers will play four games at home and four 
on the road. They will take on foes with a combined mark of 19-17. And yes, 
they get to play the Jets again. 
</P>
<P>
But before ordering those playoff tickets, a midterm report card: 
</P>
<P>
QUARTERBACK: C 
</P>
<P>
Putting the ball in Billy Joe Tolliver's hands is like giving the family car to 
the teen-ager on Friday night. Now whether you're sitting in the stands or 
staying up all night, it's nerve-racking. At times it looks like Tolliver 
couldn't hit the Pacific Ocean if he threw from the Pacific Beach pier, but 
check his pulse, he's now thrown 70 passes in a row without an interception. 
He's tough, he's a leader, and boo all you want, he's a survivor . . . Mark 
Vlasic has a career mark of 2-1 as an NFL starter, and the head coach who won't 
let him play has an 
</P>
<P>
overall record of 31-56-1. 
</P>
<P>
RUNNING BACK: A+ 
</P>
<P>
Want to make a quick buck: Take a weekend flight to Miami or Green Bay or 
Minneapolis and stop by the local pubs and wager football fans that they can't 
tell you who leads the NFL in rushing. If Marion Butts duplicates his 654-yard 
performance in second half of the season, he will shatter the Chargers' 
all-time rushing mark of 1,179 yards set by Earnest Jackson in 1984. If 
Chargers' coaching staff hadn't been bullied into getting the ball to Rod 
Bernstine, Butts might already have topped the 1,000-yard mark. Versatile 
Ronnie Harmon provides brass with more weapons than they know what to do with 
-- and isn't that the truth. 
</P>
<P>
RECEIVERS: C- 
</P>
<P>
They can find a tight end to play running back and a kicker who can't miss, but 
they can't find a qualified pass catcher to start opposite Anthony Miller. If 
Miller is drawing double coverage all the time, then how bad are these other 
guys? Miller has 33 receptions and the rest of the wide receivers have a total 
of 19. How about a Charlie Joiner comeback? In hindsight, the training camp 
knee injury to speedy Wayne Walker may have been the team's most devastating 
loss. In lacking such production from the wide receivers, why not employ the 
pass-catching skills of Bernstine, Darrin Nelson and Harmon more often? A few 
more passes to the running backs would also increase Tolliver's completion 
percentage and improve his confidence. 
</P>
<P>
OFFENSIVE LINE: B 
</P>
<P>
It's like Robert Redford in "The Natural." You have this just 
horrible/terrible/awful group of stiffs and then just the right guy wanders 
along, and voila, they start playing like Hall of Famers. In this case, that 
would be offensive line coach Alex Gibbs, and while no one will ever mistake 
him for Reynolds or Redford, Ripley's should take notice. Chargers not only 
average 4.6 yards a run behind these so-called slugs, but in eight games, the 
team's quarterbacks have been sacked only 11 times. That's with Eric Floyd and 
Leo Goeas alternating at left tackle. Makes you wonder if Gibbs has some pact 
with the devil. 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSIVE LINE: C- 
</P>
<P>
What was to be the team's biggest strength has been the biggest bust. In three 
victories, the defensive line had 10 sacks; in five defeats, it had 10. As the 
pass rush goes, so goes the Chargers' defense. The loss of Joe Phillips was 
like Padres' midseason loss of Benito Santiago. But then playing Lee Williams 
at defensive tackle is like asking Tony Gwynn to bat only against left-handers. 
Makes no sense. Williams was one of the game's premier players as a defensive 
end, but at defensive tackle he's been declawed. Burt Grossman is tied for the 
AFC lead with eight sacks, but has lost his funny edge since being berated by 
coaches for not playing well early on when he was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
LINEBACKERS: C+ 
</P>
<P>
You got your Henry Rolling and you got your Junior Seau. You know, it's like a 
record. On one side you got your big hit, "Johnny B. Goode," and on the flip 
side you got your basic clunker. Rolling's not only been one of the biggest 
surprises, but if you're having a sports banquet and you're looking for someone 
to impress the youngsters, get ahold of this guy. Seau obviously has the talent 
to be a great player, but he's turned more people off than he has on so far . . 
. The leading tackler on this team for the fifth-straight season is Gary 
Plummer, but then you knew that. 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSIVE BACKS: B 
</P>
<P>
Two things you probably never thought you'd see again in your lifetime: Rain 
and a competent Charger secondary. Asking the Charger secondary to stay with 
Louis Lipps, Al Toon, Ernest Givins, Willie Gault and Mervyn Fernandez is like 
asking Woody Allen to keep up with Bo Derek. It boggles the imagination, but 
did you know that the Chargers' secondary has allowed only three catches of 40 
yards or more this season, and only one of those was for a touchdown. And 
safety Vencie Glenn has been hurt in the early going. Gill Byrd leads the AFC 
with five interceptions, Sam Seale has passed each test and Martin Bayless was 
having a Pro Bowl year before injuring an ankle. Are those rain clouds over 
yonder? 
</P>
<P>
SPECIAL TEAMS: B+ 
</P>
<P>
The team's 3-5 record in the first half of the season is even more 
disappointing when you consider the tremendous improvement made in special 
teams. Get it right, stupid. And so they did. Initially, they kept Fuad Reveiz 
over John Carney, but now Carney's back and eight for eight in field goals. 
Punter John Kidd makes a genius again out of Beathard. Richard Brown and Steve 
Hendrickson have brought enthusiasm back to pro sports, and special teams 
coordinator Larry Pasquale has been the best thing to hit San Diego since Steve 
Ortmayer left town. 
</P>
<P>
COACHING: C- 
</P>
<P>
You get rid of that fake punt in Dallas and the Chargers are 4-4. Some folks 
would rather get rid of the guy who called for the fake punt, but another 
continuity blip here and you're looking at the year 2000 before happy days are 
here again. Yeah, yeah, Henning's stubborn, he's deadly dull and the way he 
manages time on the sideline you have to figure he still doesn't know we're no 
longer on daylight savings time. But he has a plan, and as he gathers the 
personnel to make it work, you grudgingly come to the realization that he may 
know what he's doing. In the past 10 games, the Chargers are 5-5 under Henning. 
They'd be 6-4 if the numbskull hadn't called for the fake punt. 
</P>
<P>
FRONT OFFICE: B+ 
</P>
<P>
The battle here is with expectations. OK, so the Chargers have won only 15 of 
their past 46 games, but we're talking Bobby Beathard. Give him another month. 
Five of his draft picks have already earned starting time as rookies. And a 
sixth, quarterback John Friesz, is pegged as a potential starting quarterback 
down the road. Two of his Plan B acquistions, Kidd and Harmon, have paid 
sizeable dividends, and the signing of Rolling as a linebacker off the streets 
is the kind of thing Beathard did in 1983 to take the Redskins to the Super 
Bowl. Defense isn't as strong as he thought when he took the job, and so 
rebuilding may take a little longer. So give him two months. 
</P>

HOCKEY: HE POWERS THE KINGS TO A 4-1 VICTORY OVER THE LAST-PLACE ISLANDERS 
AFTER BEING KNOCKED DOWN BY PILON. 
</P>

UNIONDALE, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A decade ago, they were the kings and Nassau Coliseum was their castle. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Islanders ruled the NHL, drinking out of the Stanley Cup four 
consecutive years at the start of the 1980s. Teams would tiptoe in here, 
already intimidated, and stumble out, having been dominated. 
</P>
<P>
But no more. 
</P>
<P>
The new Kings on the block, the Smythe Division leaders from L.A., showed no 
respect for that tradition of excellence Tuesday night, beating the Islanders, 
4-1, before 12,760. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody seems to be doing that lately to the Islanders. These are teams 
streaking in opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Kings' seventh victory in their last eight games and their third in 
four road games. In eight of their 12 games, the Kings (9-2-1) have given up 
two or fewer goals, and have won all eight. 
</P>
<P>
The Islanders (3-9), last in the Patrick Division, have lost six of their last 
seven, giving up 28 goals in their last four losses. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what the Islanders' problems are, Coach Al Arbour replied, "From 
goaltending right on out." 
</P>
<P>
Winning goalie Kelly Hrudey, who continues to alternate with Daniel Berthiaume, 
faced 33 shots. 
</P>
<P>
"We are fortunate that Kelly Hrudey stood on his head to stop some of those 
shots," teammate Wayne Gretzky said. "The score was not indicative of how close 
the game was." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the game seemed close only until Gretzky was flattened in a corner by 
New York's Rich Pilon. 
</P>
<P>
King defenseman Rod Buskas had begun the scoring at 7:35 of the first period, 
putting the puck between the pads of goalie Danny Lorenz for his first goal as 
a King. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenz, getting his first NHL start, didn't fold, however. 
</P>
<P>
With the Islanders taking 11 of the first 12 shots on goal, Buskas' goal being 
the exception, it appeared the Kings might be letting their minds wander, 
perhaps to tonight's showdown across the river with the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the Kings got their wakeup call, a ringing in Gretzky's ears. 
</P>
<P>
Showing uncharacteristic emotion, Gretzky fired a few spoken shots at the 
Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
And the puck into the net. 
</P>
<P>
His goal, coming on a power play, was set up by an excellent pass from 
defenseman Rob Blake. Blake, on the right side, faked a slap shot, but instead 
whipped the puck to Gretzky, facing an open net near the right post. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky flipped the puck in for his eighth goal and 24th point, tying Tomas 
Sandstrom for the team lead in the former category and extending his own team 
high in the latter. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 14th point for Blake, tops among all rookies. 
</P>
<P>
Even after he had scored, Gretzky continued to shout at the Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
"That probably got me into the game," Gretzky said of the blow he took. "The 
team seemed to get going after that. Sometimes it takes something like that. 
You realize that if you stand around, you are going to get hit. You've got to 
keep skating." 
</P>
<P>
That the Kings did, adding Tony Granato's sixth goal and Luc Robitaille's 
seventh in the second period to put the game away. 
</P>
<P>
New York's only goal was scored by Gary Nylund, his first. 
</P>
<P>
The Islanders held the Kings to 25 shots, but couldn't produce enough offense. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenz is expected to be replaced in the net by former King Glenn Healy, who 
has missed seven games because of a leg injury. Fellow goalie Mark Fitzpatrick 
has sidelined all season because of a disease that causes swelling of muscles 
and tissues. Also injured are goalie Jeff Hackett and forward Alan Kerr. 
</P>
<P>
High up in the rafters, the faded NHL championship banners still hang -- mute 
testimony to an era that has passed.

A 15-year-old hunter from Dunsmuir in Northern California has claimed the 
California state record for a black bear, 675 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Jones, bear hunting for the first time, shot the animal once in the head 
from 35 feet with a .357 magnum handgun as hounds owned by his father, Keith 
Jones, held the bear at bay near Lake McCloud Oct. 23. 
</P>
<P>
The bear measured 86 inches from the tip of its nose to its tail and had a 
72-inch girth. Its age was estimated at 20.

KIMBALL TO RECEIVE '93 PAROLE; 
</P>
<P>
JURISPRUDENCE: FORMER OLYMPIC DIVING MEDALIST KILLED TWO TEEN-AGERS IN 
DRUNK-DRIVING ACCIDENT.

<P>
Former Olympic diver Bruce Kimball will serve less than five years of a 17-year 
sentence for a 1988 drunk-driving accident that killed two teen-agers, the 
Florida Parole Commission decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The commission voted to release Kimball Nov. 24, 1993, unless the case is 
brought back to the commission for disciplinary action by the Department of 
Corrections, parole spokeswoman Ruth Anne Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
Kimball, who pleaded guilty to two manslaughter charges, has served about 22 
months of his sentence for the Aug. 1, 1988, accident that killed Robbie 
Bedell, 19, and Kevin Gossic, 16. Three others were seriously injured when 
Kimball crashed into a crowd of teen-agers on a dead-end road in Brandon, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The mother of one of the dead youths was disappointed by the decision. "They 
have to be aware what they decide affects people," Terry Bedell said. "It 
affects me, it affects my family, it affects Robbie's friends." 
</P>
<P>
A silver medalist in 1984, Kimball was in training for the 1988 Olympics. At 
the time of the accident, he had a blood-alcohol level twice the legal limit. 
</P>
<P>
Parole Commissioner Anabel Mitchell noted that Kimball has expressed remorse 
and undergone treatment programs. 
</P>
<P>
"If he serves 100 years it's not going to bring back the lives of those two 
young people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although a glitch in the Parole Board's computer system prevented the agency 
from mailing questionnaires to some victims, the Bedell family returned a 
questionnaire and attended Tuesday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted them to see that these are not just faceless people," Bedell said. 
"They sit there and they listen to thousands of these cases and to them it's 
just a number. . . . He didn't hurt my car, he killed my son." 
</P>
<P>
But another victim's relative has said he wishes he had been invited to send a 
letter to commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have written a note recommending his release if I'd known," Raymond 
Kerker said. Kerker, whose son R.J. was nearly crippled in the accident, said 
he has forgiven Kimball. 
</P>
<P>
"That man's son is alive," Terry Bedell said. "Maybe if my son was alive I 
could say the same thing, but I can't right now."

Edwin Moses, two-time Olympic gold medalist in the intermediate hurdles, was 
named Tuesday to serve as the brakeman for the No. 1 U.S. bobsled team in 
today's two-man competition at a World Cup event in Calgary, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
It will be Moses' first competition over a regulation 1,500-meter course. 
</P>
<P>
He will share a sled with driver Brian Shimer of Naples, Fla. They were third 
last month in a two-man 50-meter push competition at Konigssee, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"Edwin's performance has been fantastic," U.S. Coach Tony Carlino said. "We 
have a good chance not only for the fastest start but also for a finish in the 
top three." 
</P>
<P>
Moses also will attempt to earn a berth on one of the U.S. sleds for Saturday's 
four-man competition at Calgary. RANDY HARVEY

With injuries knocking sophomore tight end Yonnie Jackson and senior nose guard 
Gene Fruge out of Saturday's game against California at the Coliseum, USC could 
start as many as eight freshmen against the Golden Bears. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Larry Smith won't announce his starting lineup until Friday, but six 
freshmen started in Saturday's 13-6 victory over Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
And the probable replacements for Jackson and Fruge -- Brad Banta or Elic 
Mahone at tight end and Mike Hinz at nose guard -- are freshmen. Against the 
Sun Devils, Jackson suffered a stress fracture in his left foot, Fruge a stress 
fracture in his right leg. 
</P>
<P>
Among those expected back this week are tailback Mazio Royster and fullback 
Scott Lockwood, who were knocked out of the Arizona State game with 
concussions; linebacker Scott Ross, who was sidelined because of a broken right 
hand, and cornerback Jason Oliver, who missed the game to be at his father's 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Ricky Ervins, who hasn't played since Sept. 29 because of a sprained 
ankle, will probably be available for limited duty against Cal, Smith said.

Corona del Mar High School clinched its third consecutive Sea View League 
girls' volleyball title Tuesday night by sweeping University, 15-4, 15-10, 
15-4, at Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings (19-1, 9-0) won their 17th consecutive match and are virtually 
assured of being the top-seeded team for the Southern Section 5-A tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Tournament pairings will be announced Monday, with first-round games starting 
Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if we had lost tonight and Thursday, I still think we would be the 
top-seeded team," said Dale Flickinger, Corona del Mar's interim coach. 
</P>
<P>
Middle blocker Lara Carlsen had seven kills and outside hitter Tracy Schriber 
added five to lead a balanced Corona del Mar attack. 
</P>
<P>
Outside hitter Lynn Randall added five kills and three aces for the Sea Kings, 
who finish the regular season Thursday night against league rival Newport 
Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Randall served her three aces in the first game as Corona del Mar broke a 3-3 
tie with a 12-1 run. 
</P>
<P>
Flickinger substituted freely throughout the third game as Corona del Mar built 
an 8-2 lead. University got no closer than five points. 
</P>
<P>
Lemia Astarabadi had six kills and Holiday Molway had five to lead University 
(8-7, 2-7). MIKE REILLEY

RACE BOARD GRANTS HEARING TO REDDING AND DOLLASE

<TEXT>
<P>
In an apparent attempt to keep the issue out of the legal system, the 
California Horse Racing Board has granted owner Jheri Redding and trainer 
Wallace Dollase a new hearing in the ongoing Del Mar Derby saga. 
</P>
<P>
Redding's 3-year-old Itsallgreektome, who in his most recent race ran second in 
the Breeders' Cup Mile Saturday, had been awarded the victory in the $300,000 
Derby on Aug. 19 when the Del Mar stewards disqualified first-place finisher 
Tight Spot for interference. 
</P>
<P>
On the appeal of Tight Spot's owners, that decision was reversed by hearing 
officer Steven Schwartz on Sept. 27. Tight Spot was reinstated as the winner 
and Itsallgreektome was relegated to second place. 
</P>
<P>
Redding at first was turned down by the CHRB in his request for a re-hearing 
and subsequently filed suit in Superior Court. Last Friday, after meeting in 
executive session, the CHRB flip-flopped and decided to reopen the case. 
</P>
<P>
"All my clients ever wanted was an opportunity to present their side of it," 
said Donald Calabria, Redding's attorney. "We'll certainly put on some evidence 
that it wasn't in the best interests of racing to overturn a judgment call by 
the stewards." JAY HOVDEY

TOP-SEEDED PLAYERS BEATEN IN THE EMPIRE LEAGUE FINALS

<P>
Upsets in the singles and doubles finals marked the Empire League tennis 
individual championships Tuesday at Old Ranch Tennis Club in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos High senior Laura Brun, the No. 2-seeded player, won the singles 
title with a 7-6, 6-3 victory over top-seeded Traci Botha of El Dorado. 
</P>
<P>
In doubles, El Dorado's Tamie Hanson and Tempa Rainey -- the third-seeded team 
-- rallied to defeat Los Alamitos' Stefanie Springosky and Meredith Valt, the 
top-seeded team, 1-6, 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Brun's victory avenged her only two losses this season. She had a 28-2 record, 
the losses coming at the hands of Botha, the league's player of the year. Botha 
was 29-1 in league, losing only to Katella's Debbie Vonusa. 
</P>
<P>
Brun used her hard serve and excellent passing shots to wear down Botha, who 
made numerous unforced errors. It was Brun's first victory over Botha in seven 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
In doubles competition, Hanson and Rainey entered the match as underdogs to the 
league's doubles team of the year, and in the early going it looked as if 
Springosky and Valt were on their way to another victory. 
</P>
<P>
But aggressive net play by the winners, particularly in the third set, turned 
the match around. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't beat them once (during the season) but it doesn't matter. We beat 
them here," Rainey said. 
</P>
<P>
Third place in the singles finals went to Los Alamitos sophomore Susan 
Huberman. FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ

RIVERMEN GET QUICK START, ROLL UP 9-3 VICTORY OVER GULLS

Anything that tasted that great couldn't possibly be good for you. 
</P>
<P>
Ask the Gulls, who seemed to have taken that early childhood lesson to heart in 
an 9-3 International Hockey League loss to Peoria Tuesday night, in front of 
3,789 at the San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 10 days, the Gulls -- victorious in four of their last five games 
going into the series against Peoria -- have flirted with success. But the 
rebuff by the Rivermen Tuesday was cold and calculating. 
</P>
<P>
Peoria built up a 6-1 lead by the third period, when the Gulls staged a 
comeback attempt that fell flat. The closest the Gulls got was 7-3, on a 
power-play goal by right wing Brent Sapergia, with 13:57 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to get better performances from the players we have out there," Gulls 
Coach Mike O'Connell said. "It's unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Things got bad enough to see not one, but two Peoria players, Steve Tuttle and 
David Bruce, who leads the league in scoring and points, score hat tricks. 
Their goals made it 9-3. 
</P>
<P>
So the offense sputtered, the defense looked like someone should administer 
smeling salts, and the Gulls left the ice with their tails between their legs. 
</P>
<P>
But remember, this was the Western Division-leading Rivermen, who have won nine 
straight. Sure, they're good, but O'Connell wouldn't hear of any of it as an 
excuse. 
</P>
<P>
"Peoria is a very strong team, excellent . . . But we seem to get into these 
situations as a team where we forget what was successful for us. Unfortunately, 
it takes a loss like this for our players to realize that maybe we weren't 
ready." 
</P>
<P>
After the Rivermen scored their sixth goal, Scott Brower replaced Glen Hanlon 
in goal for the Gulls. 
</P>
<P>
Peoria's Nelson Emerson scored first in the third for the 7-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after that, the officials ruled against the Gulls, and took away what 
appeared to be a goal by Charlie Simmer. It was ruled that the puck had 
redirected off his skate. 
</P>
<P>
Simmer made it 7-2 on a power-play slapshot from the high slot 12:47.

Evander Holyfield will defend his heavyweight title against George Foreman for 
$20 million, promoter Dan Duva said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Foreman will get $12.5 million, Duva said. 
</P>
<P>
Duva said no decision had been made on a site or date, but he confirmed that 
Caesars Palace in Las Vegas had offered a site fee of $10 million to $12 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm meeting with the (Donald) Trump people today," Duva said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Arum of Top Rank, who is co-promoting the bout with Duva, told USA Today 
that the Holyfield-Foreman fight will be held in Las Vegas April 19. Duva 
denied that the date had been set, however. In London, promoter Frank Warren 
said that the 42-year-old Foreman would have a tuneup fight Dec. 5 in Britain. 
He said no opponent had been selected.

Foreman knocked out American Terry Anderson in the first round in London last 
month.

LA JOLLA COUNTRY DAY'S ABRAMS GETS A KICK OUT OF HELPING FOUNDATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA PALMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
La Jolla Country Day's Eric Abrams is kicking for a good cause. 
</P>
<P>
The junior kicker has solicited pledges to the San Diego Make a Wish Foundation 
for each extra point and field goal he makes this season. 
</P>
<P>
Abrams calculated that he has $8,250 in pledges, figuring an average of $150 
for each of his 55 points. With at least three games remaining, the fund could 
go over the $10,000 mark. 
</P>
<P>
It started a year ago when Abrams attended one of Ray Pelfrey's Professional 
Kicking Services camps. Pelfrey thought up the idea and had all his kickers 
solicit pledges of one, three or five dollars for each extra point throughout 
the season. The money the kicker raised went to the Make a Wish Foundation in 
his city. To motivate the kickers, Pelfrey donated $500 to the winner's high 
school athletic program. Abrams collected $1,500 which was the third highest. 
</P>
<P>
Pelfrey has tried this season to get the program sponsored by the National Make 
A Wish foundation but hadn't at the start of this season. However, Abrams 
decided to do it on his own. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we know he's the only one doing it," his father, Jeff Abrams, said. 
"We've gotten an incredible response. Eric likes doing it. He feels like he's 
doing something for somebody rather than just kicking a football." 
</P>
<P>
St. Augustine's homecoming king, Juan Castro, had a girl on each arm when two 
queens, not just one, were crowned during halftime of Friday's game with 
Christian. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie LaBonte and Carmen Esquer were chosen by St. Augustine's senior class 
from four nominees previously chosen from the senior class of Our Lady of 
Peace, St. Augustine's sister school. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowd reaction was real interesting," said Melinda Blade, OLP's athletic 
director. " When it was announced there was a tie, the crowd kind of groaned 
like they were disappointed. But we were real happy both girls were honored." 
</P>
<P>
One of the county's top basketball recruits, Darryl Parker of Rancho Buena 
Vista, is apparently going to be playing his college ball at Cal State Long 
Beach, Loyola Marymount or UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"Darryl wants to go somewhere where they play a running-style offense," RBV 
Coach John O'Neill said. "That's why he's picked those schools. He went to a 
Loyola practice and he liked what he saw." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill said Parker, a 6-6 forward, could sign Nov. 14, the early signing date 
for high school seniors. O'Neill said some Pac-10 schools are also recruiting 
Parker. 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual Coach Tom Buck said the county's most heavily recruited senior, 
6-10 Erik Meek, might still attend Duke, even though Cherokee Parks of Marina 
High of Huntington Beach announced last week that he will play for the Blue 
Devils. 
</P>
<P>
Buck said Meek does not plan to play the same position as Parks anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"Erik will play a big forward and Cherokee is a true center," Buck said. "Erik 
has always said that he could play with Cherokee." 
</P>
<P>
Meek is visiting Duke two days before the early signing date. 
</P>
<P>
The lights were shut off and the concession stand was closed during the 
halftime of the Southwest-Sweetwater game so that a 30-minute slide show could 
be shown as a part of Sweetwater's Homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't really affect us," Southwest Coach Carl Parrick said. "But two weeks 
ago, when we had homecoming, we were in our locker room for 40 minutes. It was 
ridiculous. I was even getting perturbed. The head coach at Hilltop, Joy 
Gritts, opted not to throw a flag on us, but he could have. He was the first 
head coach I worked for so there's some camaraderie there."

FORD'S EARNINGS FALL 78% DURING THIRD QUARTER; 
</P>

Reporting bad news and offering a gloomy outlook for the auto industry, Ford 
Motor Co. said Tuesday that its earnings tumbled nearly 80% in the third 
quarter from a year earlier, a performance brought on by a weak auto market and 
deepened by problems at its California-based savings and loan operation. 
</P>
<P>
"There will probably be bad times for a while," said David N. McCammon, vice 
president of finance and treasurer at the nation's No. 2 car maker. "We're in a 
mild recession, which will continue into the first and maybe the second 
quarters." 
</P>
<P>
A falloff in earnings was expected, but Ford's results -- a 78.7% drop to $102 
million -- were worse than analysts had forecast, partly because the company 
had to set aside $115 million to cover possible bad loans by First Nationwide 
Financial, its San Francisco-based savings and loan unit. 
</P>
<P>
Still, if it weren't for profit from its finance operations, Ford would have 
been deeply in the red. The company said it lost money on almost all its 
automotive operations, even though it sold more vehicles than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Ford paid for its increased car sales with a $200-per-car average hike in 
discounts and rebates offered to buyers. "We had hoped with the new model year 
we'd be able to reduce incentives," McCammon said. "But then came the Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
Ford's vast overseas operations lost $89 million, compared to a profit of $324 
million last year. The company managed a narrow profit in the U.S. auto market 
only by using a more favorable depreciation schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"There were deteriorating profits everyplace," McCammon said. "It's one of 
these years in which everything is hitting adversely." 
</P>
<P>
Although Ford's financial services group accounted for all of its third-quarter 
earnings, its contribution was diminished by falling commercial real estate 
values and increased loan delinquencies at First Nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
First Nationwide Financial lost $44.8 million in the third quarter, Ford said. 
The $115 million that was set aside for bad loans, made after a review of its 
First Nationwide Bank unit by federal regulators, included $92 million reserved 
against unspecified losses in the future. Savings and loans have been building 
such reserves only recently, as they adopt more stringent, bank-like standards. 
</P>
<P>
First Nationwide Financial's difficulties come as the nation's real estate 
market is softening, causing big losses for thrifts and banks that bet heavily 
on real estate during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Most of its real estate problems involve loans made on apartments, shopping 
centers, self-storage buildings and office buildings. The thrift said the 
problem loans are mostly in the New York area, although worries are increasing 
in Florida and, modestly, in California. 
</P>
<P>
Ford will be pumping an additional $250 million into First Nationwide next 
month to bolster the thrift's capital -- the financial safety net it is 
required to maintain to protect against losses. First Nationwide Bank is 
California's fifth-largest savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
First Nationwide Financial also indicated that it is in a dispute with 
regulators over two accounting issues that could hurt earnings further. One 
involves valuing mortgage-related securities; the other has to do with 
accounting for intangible assets. First Nationwide said it expects to resolve 
the dispute in six to nine months. 
</P>
<P>
McCammon sidestepped questions about Ford's profitability in the fourth 
quarter, but conceded that things aren't getting any better in the car market. 
In addition, he said, the cost of Ford's new labor agreement with the United 
Auto Workers will make itself felt in the fourth quarter.

UAW-CHRYSLER ACCORD FOLLOWS INDUSTRY TREND;

The United Auto Workers and Chrysler Corp. reached a tentative agreement 
Tuesday on a three-year contract, matching an industry pattern that the company 
repeatedly had said it couldn't afford. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pattern settlement and a pattern settlement in all respects," UAW 
President Owen Bieber said. 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a union goal set in mid-July of similar contracts for the 
450,000 UAW workers at General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler didn't give away the store, however, its chief negotiator, Anthony St. 
John, said. "There are elements in this agreement that are particularly helpful 
to Chrysler's case," said St. John, a Chrysler vice president. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement covers 63,000 workers in Michigan, Missouri, Delaware, Alabama, 
Illinois, Indiana, New York and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Details were not released, but Chrysler appeared to have secured a new 
production plan at its minivan plant in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, members of Local 110, covering about 3,500 workers at the St. Louis 
factory, rejected a proposal to change from two straight shifts to three crews 
on two shifts. The company said that would boost minivan production by 20% and 
employment by 1,000 to 1,300 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Although the UAW's national leadership and the company had backed the change, 
plant workers contended that it denied them any chance at overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The contract will be reviewed by the 200-member Chrysler bargaining council in 
Detroit before going to the rank and file for ratification. 
</P>
<P>
St. John said there would be no change in the union's "30 and out" retirement 
plan, which allows workers to retire when they have 30 years of seniority, no 
matter how old they are. 
</P>
<P>
The company had proposed holding off pension payments until a worker reached 
60. 
</P>
<P>
Bieber and St. John declined to answer questions about health-care provisions, 
a sticking point in the talks. In the GM-Ford agreements, there was no change 
in method of coverage, but the companies and the union agreed to look for ways 
to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler said it spent $684 million on health care last year. A company's 
health-care bill is increased by a higher percentage of retirees, and Chrysler 
has nearly one retiree for every active worker -- a higher proportion than GM 
or Ford. 
</P>
<P>
The UAW reached agreement with GM on Sept. 17. After that contract was 
ratified, it took just six days for the union and Ford to agree. 
</P>
<P>
The union terminated an extension of its Chrysler contract at midnight Monday 
but told members to report to their jobs as usual Tuesday while bargaining 
continued.

HOMEFED'S BIGGEST BORROWER IN ARREARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HomeFed Bank, the San Diego savings and loan that has seen its loan problems 
mount in recent months, said Tuesday that its largest borrower is delinquent on 
a $70-million office building loan. 
</P>
<P>
Unless La Jolla office developer Jack Naiman brings the loan current within 30 
days, it stands to be formally classified as a nonperforming asset, which could 
push HomeFed's bad-loan total beyond 4% of assets, a dangerously high ratio. 
</P>
<P>
The loan, the largest on HomeFed's books, has been delinquent since Aug. 30. It 
has not been classified as nonperforming because it is not 90 days delinquent, 
the S&amp;L said Tuesday. The loan is secured by a first mortgage on the Naiman 
Tech Center, a nine-building, 635,000-square-foot office and research park in 
the Sorrento Valley area of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The news comes at a bad time for HomeFed, which has struggled to control its 
bad loans as its stock price has plummeted. HomeFed has seen its nonperforming 
assets rise to $749 million or 3.92% of its $19 billion in assets as of Sept. 
30, up from $462 million, or 2.6% of assets, on Dec. 31 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Loan portfolio problems and general investor skittishness about California real 
estate has sent HomeFed stock plummeting since June. The stock closed at $4.75 
a share Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, down from as high as $33.25 on 
June 12. Other California S&amp;L stocks have also been hurt in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Naiman, a patron of various arts organizations in San Diego, was unavailable 
for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the loan problems and loss reserves, which resulted in a $108-million 
second-quarter net loss and more than 300 staff cuts this year, HomeFed's 
capital is still above minimum regulatory requirements. 
</P>
<P>
In response to its growing bad-loan problems earlier this year, HomeFed 
announced that it would no longer make commercial real estate loans such as the 
one to Naiman. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed Bank President Robert Adelizzi refused to discuss the specifics of the 
Naiman loan. Nor would he give the specific date when the loan becomes 90 days 
delinquent or formally nonperforming. The disclosure of Naiman's delinquency 
came in a filing with the county recorder's office.

Milken Lawyers Summarize Case: Lawyer for former Drexel Burnham Lambert junk 
bond king Michael Milken claimed in a written summation that prosecutors failed 
in recent pre-sentencing hearings to prove that Milken committed more crimes 
than the six to which he pleaded guilty. Milken's lawyers also claimed that 
prosecutors unfairly used their power to grant immunity to get pro-government 
witnesses to testify while keeping out those sympathetic to Milken. The 
prosecutors' written summation is expected to be made public today.

AT&amp;T GIVING CONSUMERS ACCESS TO TRANSLATOR SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph on Tuesday extended to consumers its 
worldwide telephone interpretation service that gives callers 24-hour-a-day 
access to translators in about 140 languages. 
</P>
<P>
The service is designed to help non-English-speaking immigrants in the United 
States, Americans traveling abroad and Americans needing translation services 
for foreign or domestic calls. 
</P>
<P>
The program is an expansion of AT&amp;T Language Line Services, an operation 
that provides translations to help institutions communicate with callers who do 
not speak English. That service was started in February for businesses, public 
utilities, institutions and providers of emergency services such as fire and 
police departments but has not been offered to consumers until now. 
</P>
<P>
"We're responding to requests to make this available to those outside our 
subscription base service for institutions," said Jeff Munks, director of 
marketing and sales for Language Line Services. "This addresses a very real 
need. People have been eternally frustrated because of a lack of a service like 
this." 
</P>
<P>
Munks said hundreds of translators have been retained, some on the staff at the 
Language Line Services headquarters in Monterey, Calif., and some on a contract 
basis. The service costs $3.50 for each minute and can be billed to major 
credit cards, the company said.

Air France Gets an OK: European Community Competition Commissioner Sir Leon

negotiating a deal to increase industry competition in France. The settlement 
to allow Air France's purchase of UTA and Air Inter, uniting France's biggest 
airlines, would end months of bitter legal wrangling between the commission,

NEW HOUSE SALES AT SLOWEST PACE SINCE '82

Led by weakness in the fragile Northeast, sales of new homes fell to their 
lowest level in September since the recession eight years ago, the Commerce 
Department said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Single-family home sales plunged 6% last month after declines of 1.8% in August 
and 0.9% in July, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
The latest drop pushed home sales to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
503,000 units in September, the slowest pace since the 480,000-unit rate in 
recession-era October, 1982, it said. 
</P>
<P>
With the economy widely expected to lose steam and possibly slip into a 
recession, economists predict that things will get worse for the home-building 
industry before they get better. 
</P>
<P>
Depressed by high interest rates, slowing job growth and waning consumer 
confidence, the home-building industry has been in a slump for more than a 
year. Also slowing home sales has been a growing number of "move-up" buyers who 
are slower to strike a deal than first-time buyers, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the actual number of new homes sold has fallen 15% to 
435,000. In September, the sales total before seasonal adjustment fell to 
38,000 units from 47,000. 
</P>
<P>
The slump has been particularly severe in the Northeast, where sales fell 15.6% 
in September to an annual rate of 54,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
In the South, sales fell 7.9% to a rate of 223,000, while in the Midwest, they 
were down 2.2% to a 91,000-unit annual rate. Sales in the West slipped 0.7% 
from August to a rate of 136,000 units.

LINCOLN S&amp;L FIGURE PLEADS GUILTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A key figure in the failure of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan pleaded guilty 
Tuesday to bank fraud and agreed to cooperate with the continuing federal 
investigation of the thrift's collapse 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Ernest C. Garcia II, a 33-year-old Tucson developer, admitted that he 
fraudulently obtained a $30-million line of credit in a series of transactions 
that also let Lincoln hide from regulators its ownership in Arizona desert 
land. Regulators then had been pressing Lincoln to rid itself of risky 
investments such as the desert property. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia is the first person charged with a crime in the federal probe of 
Lincoln's collapse. 
</P>
<P>
A federal grand jury in Los Angeles has been investigating Lincoln's failure 
for more than a year. Charles H. Keating Jr., a Phoenix developer whose company 
owned Irvine-based Lincoln, is the central target of the probe. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia entered the plea Tuesday before U.S. District Judge James M. Ideman in 
Los Angeles after federal prosecutors filed an information -- essentially an 
indictment agreed to without going through a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, free on a $5,000 personal bond, is scheduled to be sentenced April 19. 
The bank fraud charge carries a maximum of five years in prison, a $250,000 
fine and restitution. Both he and his real estate company are in bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Garcia said he entered the plea "with tremendous 
feelings of remorse." 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors said the plea agreement requires Garcia to cooperate in the 
continuing Lincoln probe, but they declined to detail what would be required of 
him. Lincoln's failure is expected to cost taxpayers $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia's testimony could be potentially damaging to Keating, former American 
Continental chairman. Keating is awaiting trial in state court on 42 counts of 
securities fraud relating to the sale of American Continental bonds to state 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Keating nor his lawyer could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Early this month, lawyers for Keating identified the deal with Garcia as one of 
three activities that they said the federal grand jury was concentrating on. 
</P>
<P>
The bank fraud charge alleges that Garcia was a "straw borrower" used by 
executives at Lincoln and its parent firm, American Continental Corp. in 
Phoenix, to hide the true ownership of 1,000 acres of desert land outside 
Phoenix, according to federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
"This type of white-collar scheme -- using 'straw borrowers' -- is of 
particular concern because it is designed to conceal the true nature of the 
financial transactions involved," said U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh in a 
prepared statement from Washington. "In the process, federal regulators are 
deceived, the institution is defrauded and the taxpayers are left to foot the 
bill." 
</P>
<P>
The convoluted arrangement involving Garcia and a partnership called 
Westcontinental Mortgage &amp; Investment Corp. was the first of 10 
transactions involving property in a planned development called Hidden Valley 
Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia is accused of obtaining a $30-million line of credit from Lincoln by 
"creating the materially false and misleading impression" that the borrowing 
was not related to the simultaneous purchase of the desert acreage. 
</P>
<P>
The property was bought in 1987 by Westcon, a partnership with few assets 
created and run by a Garcia friend to accommodate the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
The information charges that, instead of being an arms-length transaction, the 
sale of the desert land for $14 million actually was an illegal quid pro quo 
for Garcia's line of credit. Westcon put $3.5 million down -- money regulators 
claim came from Lincoln through Garcia -- and borrowed the remaining amount 
from a Lincoln subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia and his company recently agreed to settle civil lawsuits filed by small 
investors in American Continental for $1 million. But because both he and his 
company are in bankruptcy, the claim for that money is expected to be reduced 
to $97,000 to $145,000, said Ronald Rus of Orange, one of the attorneys for the 
security holders.

L.A. GEAR SEEKS AD AGENCY TO KICK OFF HIGH-TECH LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
L.A. Gear is looking for an agency to fit the shoe. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles athletic shoe maker has quietly launched a review for an agency 
to create ads for a new, high-tech line of athletic shoe. Whatever agency is 
selected could eventually end up with the creative portion of the company's 
$68-million annual ad business. 
</P>
<P>
"L.A. Gear wants its advertising to be the best there is," said Michael 
Albright, the former creative director of the Shalek Agency, who last week was 
named creative director of L.A. Gear. Although L.A. Gear briefly hired Ogilvy 
&amp; Mather as its agency in 1986, that relationship lasted less than a month. 
Since that time, L.A Gear has created its own ads. 
</P>
<P>
The move comes at a time when L.A. Gear faces mounting problems. Late last 
month, it reported that third-quarter earnings were off 35% from the year 
before. The company also projected that its fourth-quarter and yearly net 
income will be down from 1989. And while selling well outside the United 
States, its Michael Jackson line of sneakers has generally been a bust 
domestically. 
</P>
<P>
But the real issue, ad executives say, is the simple fact that despite spending 
tens of millions of dollars, L.A. Gear does not have memorable advertising. 
While Nike has profited greatly from its "Just Do It" and "Bo Knows" ad 
slogans, L.A. Gear's slogan -- "Unstoppable" -- is less familiar. 
</P>
<P>
At least half a dozen agencies -- most of them on the West Coast -- have been 
contacted by L.A. Gear. Among agencies in the running in Los Angeles are BBDO 
Worldwide and Dailey &amp; Associates. Two San Francisco agencies, Mandelbaum 
Mooney Ashley and Goldberg Moser O'Neill, have been contacted. And the 
Minneapolis ad shop Fallon McElligott is also in the running. 
</P>
<P>
Assisting in the agency search is the Los Angeles consulting firm Watts &amp; 
Sedler. 
</P>
<P>
Notably absent from the competition is Chiat/Day/Mojo, the Venice ad firm that 
has already tried its hand at creating ads for L.A. Gear's two biggest rivals, 
Nike and Reebok. In the past, Sandy Saemann, the executive vice president who 
oversees L.A. Gear's advertising, has been critical of Chiat/Day's work. 
Saemann was in Atlanta on Tuesday and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Whichever agency is tapped will likely be asked to create ads for the company's 
planned "Catapult" basketball shoe line, which features a special polyurethane 
compound that the company says increases the spring in shoes. L.A. Gear hopes 
to start advertising the shoes soon, although the Catapult will not be on the 
market until 1991. Ads could include a spot on the Super Bowl.

ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS: NEWPORT PHARMACEUTICALS SAYS IT'S BACK IN THE PROFITS

<P>
Newport Pharmaceuticals International Inc., the Laguna Hills health-care 
company, reported net income of $17,000, contrasted with a net loss of $793,000 
for the same quarter in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue was up 80%, to $15.8 million from $8.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
For the nine-month period, the company lost $2.8 million, compared with a 
year-earlier loss of $511,000. Revenue rose 57%, to $43.6 million from $27.8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Pharmaceuticals attributed a substantial portion of the 1990 
year-to-date operating loss to legal expenses related to a class-action lawsuit 
and non-recurring relocation costs and consulting fees recorded in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the year-to-date net loss consisted of a $1.3-million, non-operating 
charge resulting from an exchange of notes for common stock, the company said.

USX'S INCOME DROPS 7% TO $163 MILLION

USX Corp. said Tuesday that it will transfer control of its steel division to a 
wholly owned subsidiary, a move seen by analysts as paving the way for the 
once-mighty steel company to move out of the business altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, on Tuesday the Pittsburgh-based conglomerate also reported lower 
third-quarter profit. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it had net income in the July to September period of $163 
million, down 7% from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
But operating income -- net income minus special charges -- rose 25% to $382 
million. Sales also rose 16%, to $5.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The company's energy business had operating income of $238 million on sales of 
$3.7 billion, compared to $189 million on sales of $3 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The steel segment had operating income of $63 million on sales of $1.3 billion, 
down from $85 million on the same sales in the third quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
USX -- formerly U.S. Steel Corp. but now a diversified manufacturer heavily 
involved in the energy business -- said its board of directors approved 
spinning off the steel-producing USS division into a separate company. 
</P>
<P>
The move "will provide flexibility for any steel restructuring undertaken by 
the firm," said USX Chairman Charles Corry.

SUDDENLY, SHEATHS; 
</P>
<P>
FASHION: SO MUCH FOR SUITS. NEW YORK DESIGNERS DOTE ON THE DRESS, ESPECIALLY 
THE BODY-HUGGER WITH A MATCHING COAT, IN SPRING COLLECTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So far during this week of spring fashion shows, there is just one item worth 
talking about: the dress. 
</P>
<P>
New York designers have all rediscovered it at once -- possibly because it is 
the one garment most likely to sell well. For the past several years, designers 
have put their more creative energies into suits. Now, suddenly, dresses are a 
cause. Most often they fit close to the body and are worn with a matching coat 
or jacket for an ensemble look. 
</P>
<P>
Carolina Herrera built her entire collection around dresses, among them a 
melon-colored pique sheath with gold dots woven into the fabric for day, and a 
sequin-striped dinner dress with white satin collar for a young and sporty 
evening look. Her white silk-crepe pantsuits with salmon- or aqua-sequined 
bustiers were her best alternative to dresses. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera accessorized the collection with her first line of costume jewelry, 
filled with baroque pearl necklaces and jeweled flower earrings. 
</P>
<P>
Noticeably absent from the front row of Herrera's show was Ivana Trump, 
president of the Plaza hotel, where many of the shows are held. Trump's father 
died last weekend. Her usual entrances at the shows stir things up. 
Photographers mob her, journalists crane their necks to see her latest hairdo 
and clothes. Her absence had a quieting effect. 
</P>
<P>
From Bill Blass, one of the best dresses for spring was a layered style with a 
pale pink floral print over black lace. 
</P>
<P>
Another strong contender was his double dress, a sheer black lace short sheath 
wrapped by a long black silk toga. 
</P>
<P>
His champagne-colored lace evening pants, as narrow as leggings and worn with a 
gold evening jacket, were a definite antidote to a closetful of dresses. 
</P>
<P>
For day, Blass showed tight white shifts with big pastel polka dots that looked 
like rich informal beachwear. 
</P>
<P>
Lately Blass has been a strong proponent of plaid suits. For spring, he showed 
bright, watercolor floral-print suits instead. Through most of the show, models 
wore the same sand-colored suede high-heel pumps by Manolo Blahnik. Blass even 
put them with sequined dinner suits, and they looked right. 
</P>
<P>
Ronaldus Shamask has been on his own for several seasons, since he and his 
longtime partner, Murray Moss, split up. Shamask has always been considered the 
arty, creative member of the team. And his spring collection reconfirms this. 
</P>
<P>
He has proved he is inventive. Now it's time to get real. 
</P>
<P>
His asymmetric dresses in handkerchief-weight fabrics, some with silicone dots 
and silver chains for shoulder straps, were just too flimsy and flyaway. He did 
better with a series of narrowly cut pants in iridescent silk taffeta, worn 
with apron-like tops that fit close to the body and extend over the hips. 
</P>
<P>
Perry Ellis designer Marc Jacobs used gingham checks, garden prints, mattress 
ticking and other fabrics popular with 20th-Century American interior 
decorators, such as Sister Parish, Elsie de Wolfe, and Billy Baldwin. In fact, 
he named segments of his collection after each of them. 
</P>
<P>
Gingham-checked dresses were topped by very short, wide coats in mattress 
ticking. A floor-length floral-print dress was worn open from the waist to show 
off pastel leggings. A silver sun dress was topped by a full-cut, see-through, 
rhinestone-studded raincoat for a sporty-glamour effect. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs is staying within the All-American tradition that Ellis established. His 
own fascination with American '60s rich fashion, epitomized by the Jackie 
Kennedy look, works some of the time. When it doesn't, it's because Jacobs has 
gone too close to the matronly extreme. 
</P>
<P>
Sheer and see-through looks were part of many spring collections. Jacobs and 
others put sheer blouses over bare breasts as often as over a camisole. But 
buyers were unsure the look would sell. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm seeing a lot of pretty clothes that are not relevant," said Jessica 
Mitchell, a fashion director for Saks Fifth Avenue. "How many women are really 
going to wear a sheer top?" 
</P>
<P>
Rebecca Moses showed one of the safest collections of the week. There were 
touches of fantasy, such as her pale blue-sequined Capri pants. But she toned 
them down with a classic white linen shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Her strapless dress in subtle green plaid glimmered with even more subtle 
beading. 
</P>
<P>
For variations on her many cotton and silk shifts, she showed a shirttail tunic 
over shorts that barely peak out beneath. 
</P>
<P>
Like so many others for spring, this was a collection of ensembles. Dresses 
were seldom shown alone. They had a coat or jacket to go with them. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte Neuville, who did not hold a show this season, invited the press and 
buyers to her showroom to review her new collection. She said she would 
contribute some of the money saved toward the care of AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
Neuville's white vinyl trench coat, with wide belt and patch pockets, doubled 
as a dress. A wool crepe chemise had large pearl buttons for day. An evening 
version in white silk had pastel rhinestone buttons. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best ideas in the collection was a suit with zip-front jacket in a 
mix of pink, yellow and green houndstooth checks. 
</P>
<P>
Here and elsewhere, skirts have been very short. And so far this week, the 
sheath has been the No. 1 dress shape.

ACTIVISM: THE COLD WAR MAY APPEAR TO BE OVER, SAY THE MEMBERS OF PHYSICIANS FOR 
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, BUT THE THREATS OF NUCLEAR WAR AND ENVIRONMENTAL 
DESTRUCTION ARE STILL VERY REAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Berlin Wall has fallen. Glasnost reigns. Gorbachev has won a Nobel Peace 
Prize. 
</P>
<P>
The Cold War, as we have known it for more than four decades, appears to be 
over. And with its demise, many Americans also see an end to the ultimate 
nightmare -- nuclear destruction from a U.S.-Soviet showdown. 
</P>
<P>
But for anti-nuclear activists like Dr. Robert Wesley of Irvine, the nightmare 
has merely changed its shape, becoming more subtle, more complex, more 
insidious. 
</P>
<P>
"This (end of nuclear threat) may be the perception, but not the reality," said 
Wesley, a member of the Orange County chapter of Physicians for Social 
Responsibility (PSR), long a prominent organization in the anti-nuclear 
movement. "You may have some treaties signed, Bush and Gorbachev shaking hands 
and smiling, but the fact remains that the nuclear weaponry being retired is 
minuscule while new and deadlier weapons are still being developed." 
</P>
<P>
And, added the 41-year-old cardiologist and member of the national PSR's house 
of delegates, "Even if the threat of a Soviet-U.S. war now appears unlikely, 
you have the Iraqi-Gulf crisis as proof that conventional wars could escalate 
into nuclear confrontations." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Wesley and other PSR officials are concerned not only about 
declining membership in the Washington, D.C.-based PSR, but about a growing 
feeling of complacency from the threat of nuclear war. 
</P>
<P>
Physicians for Social Responsibility had a membership of 55,000 in the 
mid-1980s. It was a powerful organization, joining forces with its parent body, 
International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, in actively 
fighting for nuclear disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
But membership has dwindled to 40,000. Membership in Los Angeles County, one of 
PSR's largest chapters, has dropped from 2,400 to 2,000. The Orange County 
chapter is down from 250 to 180 members. 
</P>
<P>
So PSR, whose 125 chapters range in size from a handful of members in North 
Dakota to thousand-plus groups in the New York City, Boston, San Francisco and 
Seattle areas, is attempting to revive its membership rolls and broaden its 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
And not just through anti-nuclear activism. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, for example, the Los Angeles chapter joined UCLA Extension and 
the Beyond War Foundation in sponsoring an environmental symposium, "Healing 
the Planet," at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 8, at UC Irvine's University Club, the Orange County chapter will hold 
its first awards banquet, hoping to woo new members, increase exposure and 
raise money. Media/sports mogul Ted Turner will be honored for his efforts as a 
longtime global peace advocate. Next spring, the Orange County chapter will 
co-sponsor a UC Irvine conference on the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"We are no less concerned with nuclearism. But we are equally concerned with 
all forms of global destruction, including the slower devastation of our 
environment," said Dr. Arthur Strauss of Irvine, another longtime PSR member. 
</P>
<P>
More than ever, added the 38-year-old pediatrician, "the health, the very 
survival of society and this planet, are endangered. This is no time for 
organizations like ours to go out of business." 
</P>
<P>
Physicians for Social Responsibility got into business in 1961. Two years 
later, it was among the peace groups that basked in a singular triumph -- the 
U.S.-Soviet signing of the Limited Test Ban Treaty that halted atmospheric 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
But after that milestone, PSR membership dropped until the late 1970s when the 
organization, galvanized by a mercurial new leader, Helen Caldicott, regrouped 
and mounted new campaigns to stop the arms race, ban all nuclear testing and 
promote massive cuts in military spending. 
</P>
<P>
"People were scared again (in the early 1980s). We had the Three-Mile Island 
accident. And our leaders were following an incredible premise: that a nuclear 
war was survivable," recalled member Dr. Fred Galluccio, 38, a Newport 
Beach-based family-practice physician. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, that was tragic nonsense," he added. "No one would survive such a 
holocaust today." 
</P>
<P>
The success of PSR was instrumental in the formation of similar anti-nuclear 
"social responsibility" groups in other professional fields, such as those for 
educators and for architects. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1980, PSR became the U.S. affiliate of International Physicians for the 
Prevention of Nuclear War, the global group founded by American and Soviet 
physicians that won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
For some PSR members, including Wesley, the group's activism has helped enhance 
the medical profession's image to skeptics who saw doctors as being too 
absorbed in their own financial status or professional turf to care about 
social advocacy. 
</P>
<P>
"We know some citizens feel this way about doctors, but that's a bad rap," 
Wesley said. Physicians for Social Responsibility "shows that doctors are 
concerned with ethical and moral issues. We have the same sense of social 
idealism." 
</P>
<P>
Wesley, who took part in the civil rights and anti-Vietnam War movements of the 
1960s and '70s and now works with the Veterans Administration Medical Center in 
Long Beach, added: "From a medical point of view, the destruction of our 
society is, after all, the ultimate epidemic." 
</P>
<P>
But PSR is finding that recognition for battling this epidemic does not come 
easily. Perhaps it is because, although it is an organization of activists, it 
is not militant. 
</P>
<P>
"We're listed in the white pages for people seeking information (about the 
organization), but most people who call us think we're some kind of 
physician-referral service," Arthur Strauss said. 
</P>
<P>
Strauss, among those arrested for trespassing during a 1986 protest at the 
Nevada nuclear test site near Las Vegas -- the charges were dismissed -- said 
PSR does not conduct marches, sit-ins or other militant protests. "Some members 
have done that on an individual basis, (but) not as a chapter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
More typical of a PSR demonstration are events such as the one that occurred in 
October, when members gathered outside the White House to present a petition to 
President Bush urging him to avoid using nuclear or chemical weapons in the 
Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The efforts of PSR, members say, are principally educational -- seminars, 
research reports, legislative testimony, international exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
Last year at UC Irvine, for example, the chapter co-sponsored a conference for 
high school students on the economic impacts in a post-Cold War world. The 
topic of next spring's campus conference, again for high school students, will 
be "Environmental Revitalization: An Issue in National and Global Security." 
</P>
<P>
As many PSR members see it, these other social concerns, including health care, 
substance abuse, homelessness and the educational system, are at least 
economically connected to the PSR's original concerns with nuclearism and 
defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
"On one hand, we still spend incredibly enormous sums on the whole military 
defense system, even on something as doubtful as the B-2 Stealth (bomber), 
while these urgent social programs go begging for fiscal support," said 
Strauss. "It is so monumentally ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
But PSR members say they are not about to abandon the cause that first brought 
them together. 
</P>
<P>
It is not just the unfinished business of seeking full bans on nuclear testing 
and the dismantling of nuclear arsenals, but protection from contamination and 
accidents from existing nuclear facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Further, they say, it is being the voice that will prevent the public from 
becoming complacent about the threat of nuclear war. 
</P>
<P>
"People are once again going through a time of denial (about the threat)," said 
Galluccio, who took part in a PSR exchange trip in 1985 to several countries, 
including the Soviet Union and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
That fall, his delegation visited Hiroshima, saw the memorial and museum there 
and met with survivors of the August, 1945, bombing. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't forget what you see, hear and feel. Even now, even with the city 
rebuilt, it is an absolutely horrendous and depressing experience to be there," 
said Galluccio. 
</P>
<P>
And to those who believe the nuclear threat has passed into history, along with 
the end of the Cold War, Galluccio offered this observation: 
</P>
<P>
"Compared with the nuclear weapons we possess today, the bomb that was dropped 
on Hiroshima 45 years ago was only a matchstick."

FUTURIST TAKES STOCK OF THE PRESENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE KOENENN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a busy morning for futurist Alvin Toffler. He sped through Los Angeles 
like an electronic circuit rider, barely pausing for breath as he made the 
rounds promoting his new book "Powershift." 
</P>
<P>
In a two-hour span he polished off visits to KTWV Radio on Sunset Boulevard for 
David Hirsch's "The Wave Window," Cable News Network's television studios and a 
live interview with Sonya Friedman, and KABC Radio for host Michael Jackson's 
call-in show. The pace was appropriate for Toffler, whose specialty is 
accelerated change and how we adapt to it. 
</P>
<P>
"We are living during one of the greatest turning points in history," maintains 
the writer who made "Future Shock" a household phrase. 
</P>
<P>
With his wife and collaborator, Heidi Toffler, he has monitored societal change 
for the last 40 years, circling the globe, meeting with world leaders, 
lecturing, consulting, researching and writing. (Although his preface 
acknowledges his wife's "intensive" participation, and describes their work as 
a partnership in research and conceptualization, Alvin Toffler, as the writer, 
gets the author's credit). 
</P>
<P>
Their role, he emphasizes, is not to make predictions about the future ("That 
sounds like a fortuneteller"), but to clarify the present. And what he sees, 
looking around the world today, is a top-to-bottom shake-up of unprecedented 
proportions. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in for some very turbulent times," he said. "The power systems that 
held countries and institutions together are disintegrating -- not just 
governments, but banks, trade unions, and the media." 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Europe's overthrow of Communist regimes and the dismantling of the 
Berlin Wall have made part of the tumult obvious. But below that global 
surface, the Tofflers identify manifold changes that affect the lives of 
everyday people, as traditional institutions and authority figures start losing 
their clout. For instance, the wide-ranging "Powershift" describes such 
phenomenon as: 
</P>
<P>
* The dethroning of medical doctors in the United States from "white-coated 
gods" to a profession besieged by malpractice suits, insurance companies, 
militant nurses, health-care conglomerates and patients who "talk back." 
</P>
<P>
* The demise of banks as money nearly disappears as a medium of exchange, 
replaced by a Video Age world of multiple "designer currencies." 
</P>
<P>
* The growing interest of large corporations in acquiring small mom-and-pop 
businesses to let them continue within the larger organization as "fam-firm" 
units valued for their flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
* The weakening of the three television networks that now face so much 
competition that their futures are in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
These institutional shifts are only a sampling of an elaborate kaleidoscope of 
change Toffler has incorporated in "Powershift" (Bantam Books, $27.95), an 
ambitious, 550-page attempt to synthesize what the author describes as the 
"dawn of the Powershift era." 
</P>
<P>
"It is about the crescendoing struggles for power that still face us as the 
industrial civilization loses world dominance and new forces arise to tower 
over the Earth," he writes. Essentially, the book expands on the information 
explosion of the 1980s, and Toffler's own earlier writings, describing a world 
moving from an industrial (or smokestack) society to a new computerized Age of 
Information in which, says Toffler, power is directly linked to knowledge. 
"Knowledge has become central to economic development," he said. "It's the new 
raw material, taking the place of brute labor. That's what's new." 
</P>
<P>
In the Information Age he describes, power can be as simple as one person using 
a fax machine to send information across the globe. Or it can be as complex as 
global guerrilla groups utilizing satellites, lasers, computers, briefcase 
weapons, precision targeting and a choice of viruses with which to attack 
people or computers. 
</P>
<P>
And that, he contends, is changing all patterns of relationships. 
</P>
<P>
"Powershift" is being promoted by Bantam Books as the third in a trilogy 
"describing the emergent civilization of the 21st Century." Toffler, a writer 
and social analyst who carved out the specialty of trying to make sense of 
"accelerant change" early in his career, also describes the books as a series, 
noting that he first warned of the racing pace of change in "Future Shock," his 
1970 book, which sold an estimated 7 million copies around the world. A decade 
later, Toffler's "The Third Wave" also became a worldwide bestseller, valued 
for analyzing the direction of change from an industrial to a high-tech world. 
</P>
<P>
And now, says the author, "Powershift" focuses on the control of changes still 
to come -- who will shape them and how -- and questions that are still 
unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
The Tofflers, who maintain homes in Los Angeles and Connecticut, are voracious 
readers and global travelers who have met with world leaders from Mikhail 
Gorbachev to the late Indira Gandhi. "Powershift" is being published 
simultaneously in Spain, Latin America, Germany and the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
And in Japan, which Toffler describes as their "next most important readership 
after the United States," a television documentary is being prepared in 
connection with the new book. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan is a very future-oriented culture," Heidi Toffler noted. "They've been 
onto the Information Age idea since we started talking about it." 
</P>
<P>
Added her husband: "They glommed right onto it. As a matter of national policy, 
their government helped smokestack industries like shipbuilding wind down and 
convert to telecommunications and computers and robots. 
</P>
<P>
"In contrast, our politicians still think of the Information Age as a 'little 
Silicon Valley thing.' " 
</P>
<P>
It is their feeling that not only our political systems but most of our 
institutions are headed for major revamping before they are able to deal with 
the new realities. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing continues forever, and change won't continue forever," said Toffler. 
"We've had decades of technological upheaval and technological change and are 
still on the accelerating end of this process. Now we are going to hit 
turbulence because it is now affecting those power institutions that have been 
embedded, that are hardest to change. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the chickens are coming home to roost. The power structure is incongruent 
with the rest of society." 
</P>
<P>
The evidence, he says, is the convergent crises faced by all the industrial 
societies: crises in urban systems, health systems, welfare systems, 
transportation systems, ecological systems and educational systems. 
</P>
<P>
"Smokestack politicians continue to respond to these crises one at a time, with 
variations of the old approaches. But they may be insoluble given existing 
institutions," he writes. 
</P>
<P>
Although "Powershift" deals exhaustively with change, bolstered by 75 pages of 
bibliography and notes, there are no conclusions and no utopian promises. 
Toffler doesn't even throw out a few suggestions for coping in the 
power-shifting world ahead, just this advice: 
</P>
<P>
"The future is not 'knowable' in the sense of exact prediction. Life is filled 
with surrealistic surprise. . . . Nevertheless, as we advance into the terra 
incognita of tomorrow, it is better to have a general and incomplete map, 
subject to revision and correction, than to have no map at all."

New York Negotiations: The major production studios, represented by the 
Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, are negotiating with the 
New York local of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and 
Moving Picture Machine Operators for a new contract to replace one that expires 
today, but talks were reported at an impasse. Film production in New York

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: POP MUSIC / THOMAS K. ARNOLD: COSTUMES, MUSIC TO BLEND 
DURING HALLOWEEN REVELRY 
</P>

Tonight being Halloween, you can get an eyeful of good costumes in practically 
every bar, disco, and Top 40 club in town. But, if you want to get an earful of 
good music, too, here's where to go: 
</P>
<P>
* The fourth annual Pink Panther Halloween Ball at the Bahia Resort Hotel on 
Mission Bay, produced by the owners of the trendier-than-thou Pink Panther 
watering hole in Bay Park, will once again feature a trio of top-notch 
original-music bands, including Los Angeles glam-rockers Celebrity Skin and 
local rhythm-and-blues group the Bedbreakers. 
</P>
<P>
The real treat promises to be the third act, Merry Go Down, a hot new San Diego 
band led by a pair of accomplished musicians. Singer-songwriter Marcelo 
Radulovich is a former member of Playground Slap, one of the more respected 
local 'new music' groups of the 1980s. Drummer Steve Espinoza graduated with a 
performance degree from the Berklee College of Music in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
And together with keyboardist Dan Pritchard, bassist Pete Johnson, and 
guitarist-keyboardist Frank Gaeta, they've come up with a beat-happy hybrid of 
urban funk and sophisticated techno-pop -- something along the lines of Tone 
Loc meets INXS. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are $11 in advance, $14 at the door. Proceeds will go to the California 
Center on Victimology, a local organization that assists victims of violent 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
* The Killer Halloween Party at the Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa will showcase two 
of San Diego's finest hard-rock groups: The Woof, winners of this year's annual 
"Rock Wars" battle-of-the- bands contest, and Big Talk. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are $2 if you come in costume, $5 if you don't. 
</P>
<P>
* The Cardiff Reefers, a bunch of white surfer dudes playing authentic Jamaican 
reggae, will headline tonight's Halloween Party at Winston's Beach Club in 
Ocean Beach. Tickets are $6 in advance, $7 at the door. 
</P>
<P>
* And at the umpteenth annual Halloween bash at the Spirit in Bay Park -- the 
granddaddy of San Diego's original-music nightclubs -- four talented local 
'alternative' bands will share the spotlight: Caustic Truth, Den of Thieves, 
Shark Avenue and Mae Dae. The cover charge is $3.50. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Kuzmin and Dinamik, the Soviet rock band that made its San Diego debut 
last fall during the San Diego Arts Festival seems to have made San Diego its 
second home. 
</P>
<P>
Kuzmin, the 34-year-old singer, guitarist, and songwriter, married La Jolla 
model Kelly Korzan last February in Moscow. The two now share homes in the 
Soviet capital and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the band members flew into San Diego last September for Michelob 
Street Scene '90 and haven't left since. Along with Kuzmin, they're holed up in 
a Carlsbad recording studio, cutting demos for their Soviet record company, 
Melodiya Records. 
</P>
<P>
Most nights, they're out on the town, "aggressively trying to familiarize 
themselves with American rock 'n' roll," said Scott Pedersen, the group's 
American representative. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, Vladimir Kuzmin and Dinamik will be appearing in concert at San 
Diego State University's Backdoor. It's their final U.S. performance before 
they return to Moscow for another extensive tour of their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: Musicians Who Care, the San Diego association of socially 
conscious musicians, is throwing a record release party next Tuesday night at 
the Bacchanal for "The Care," its long-awaited compilation album of topical 
originals by local pop acts. You'll be able to meet the bands, hear the album, 
and show your support for the local music scene by buying a copy or three. 
Tickets are $5, and proceeds will go to help cover production costs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Talk about finicky performers: The rider for Robert Fripp and the League of 
Crafty Guitarists' show last Friday night at the Bacchanal specified, 
"Purchaser shall ensure that food and drinks are not served on the floor during 
the performance, and that if there is smoking allowed in the venue, either 
smokers are positioned away from the stage or there is no smoking during the 
performance." . . . 
</P>
<P>
The debut performance last Friday night of the resurrected Jacks -- er, Buddy 
Blue and the Jacks -- at Bodie's in downtown was such a smash (capacity crowd, 
lots of great new tunes) that the talented local rockers have been asked to 
encore next Saturday night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tickets go on sale Friday at 3 p.m. for the Robert Cray Band's Dec. 4 concert 
at the Civic Theater downtown. Joe Ely will open. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best concert bets for the coming week: Ambrosia, Thursday at the Bacchanal; 
Chris Isaak, Thursday at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach; the Havalinas, 
Friday at the Casbah in Middletown; Jane's Addiction with 24-7 Spyz, Friday and 
Saturday at the UC San Diego Price Center Ballroom; the Indigo Girls with the 
Rave- Ups, Sunday at Symphony Hall downtown; Warren Zevon, Sunday at the 
Bacchanal; the Forester Sisters, Sunday at Leo's Little Bit O' Country in San 
Marcos, and the Heart Throbs with the Railway Children, Tuesday at the 
Backdoor.

Georgians Cancel Tour: The Georgian State Dance Company, now performing in New 
York though Sunday, has canceled its nine-city tour -- including a 
seven-performance run at the Pantages which was to begin next Wednesday --

Games People Play: A contest on KEZY-FM in which listeners guess whether the 
owner of a convenience store is American- or foreign-born has some members of 
Orange County's Human Relations Commission charging racism, but station 
officials said Tuesday they have no plans to take the contest off the air. 
Morning drive-time deejay Chris Little began playing "Foreign or Domestic" last 
month and calls it "a benign little game that's designed to be entertaining."

Burned Up: Filmmaker Ken Burns, creator of PBS' acclaimed documentary "The 
Civil War," blasted American TV for offering "nearly the same thing everywhere 
. . . on dozens of clonelike channels." Burns told the National Press Club in 
Washington on Monday: "In the worst of our television, we are addicted to 
personality, to the breathless embrace of celebrity, ensuring as we go a 
tyranny of the televised over . . . the untelevised." CLAUDIA PUIG

The weekly ratings released Tuesday by A.C. Nielsen confirmed that the three 
major networks are locked in the tightest battle in years for prime-time 
supremacy. Only three-tenths of a point separated them last week. 
</P>
<P>
NBC, which holds a narrow lead in the season-to-date standings, captured an 
even narrower victory for the week with a 12.5 rating, compared to 12.4 for 
ABC. CBS, which broadcast four of the week's six most-watched programs, 
nevertheless ran third with a 12.2. (Each point represents 931,000 households.) 
The difference: CBS only had two other shows in the Top 30. Top-rated "60 
Minutes" was seen in about 19.6 million homes. The full list of ratings is on 
F10.

* The critics may not think much of it, but ABC has a bona-fide time-period hit 
in "Full House." The half-hour comedy, about three men parenting three girls, 
rolled over the competition in its 8 p.m. Friday slot last week and delivered 
its audience in a package to the show that followed, "Family Matters." For the 
hour, ABC attracted viewers in about 14.6 million homes. CBS' "Evening Shade" 
and "Bagdad Cafe" were seen in about 8.1 million, NBC's "Quantum Leap" in 7.5 
million, and Fox's "America's Most Wanted" in 5.5 million.

'LOVE LETTERS' PROVES POIGNANCY OF SIMPLICITY; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER: CHARLES KIMBROUGH AND BETH HOWLAND GET BACK TO BASICS AS THE 
CORRESPONDING LOVERS IN THE A.R. GURNEY PLAY.

<P>
The success of "Love Letters" "surprised people who should have known better," 
Charles Kimbrough said. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrough, who co-stars with Beth Howland in the Old Globe production of "Love 
Letters" this week, was the first actor to read it for playwright A.R. Gurney 
back in 1987. He read it with actress Holland Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Pete (Gurney) thought of it as a play," Kimbrough said on the 
phone from Howland's Los Angeles home, where he was having dinner. "I don't 
think he ever thought of it as having commercial possibilities -- as something 
that would make money. It seemed very slight, very slender. Which shows how 
quickly we lose our faith in a simple story, simply told. I think there's a 
real hunger in this age of glitz for this once-upon-a-time kind of feeling, 
where someone sits and reads." 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrough stressed that that first reading was just a reading, not a 
performance. But it was from that tentative beginning, at Playwrights Horizons 
in Manhattan, that the show was booked first on Sundays at Playwrights Horizons 
and later at the Promenade Theatre, where it went on to become an Off-Broadway 
sensation. 
</P>
<P>
In all that time, the format never changed. An actor and an actress would sit 
at a table and read the letters that had been written over the course of a 
lifetime between the fictional Melissa Gardner and Andrew Makepeace Ladd III. 
</P>
<P>
Because it is in the form of letters, the script can be read rather than 
memorized. This proved to have unforeseen benefits. Actors could come in on a 
day's rehearsal and play the parts for a week. This became increasingly 
attractive to celebrity actors who longed to sink their teeth into a quality 
theater script, but didn't have the time to commit to a full run. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrough was not one of those celebrity names at the time, but by 1988 he was 
to become so -- as the stuffy anchor, Jim Dial, on the CBS comedy hit, "Murphy 
Brown," airing Mondays at 9 p.m. on Channel 8. Though he made his name on 
Broadway, starring in numerous Broadway and Off-Broadway shows over the course 
of 20 years, his debut Old Globe performance will mark only his second return 
to theater since the start of "Murphy Brown." 
</P>
<P>
The first return was also in "Love Letters" -- opposite Kate Jackson -- from 
July 31 to Aug. 5 at Beverly Hills' Canon Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the television series, a week is a lot to squeeze out of Kimbrough's 
schedule. This week was supposed to have been his vacation. 
</P>
<P>
At the Old Globe, Kimbrough co-stars with Howland, whom he met 20 years ago 
when each got their first Broadway breaks on the set of Stephen Sondheim's 
"Company." 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrough picked up a Tony nomination for his work as Harry, the conflicted 
married man who sings "Sorry-Grateful." Howland had the distinction of having 
Sondheim write a song just for her range "of three notes," as she calls it. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the original song she was supposed to sing was "The Wedding Was Off." 
</P>
<P>
"It had a much harsher edge," Howland recalled. "He (Sondheim) didn't feel that 
song fit me." 
</P>
<P>
Sondheim substituted "Getting Married Today," a sweetly ambivalent song about 
marriage phobia. He may have written it with her range of three notes in mind, 
Howland says, but those three notes "are pure gold." 
</P>
<P>
Although Kimbrough stayed in New York after "Company," Howland and her daughter 
set out for Los Angeles. After an initial guest spot on "The Mary Tyler Moore 
Show," she languished for parts -- and the money to return home -- until she 
landed the part of the flaky waitress, Vera, on the pilot of "Alice." 
</P>
<P>
With the money from the pilot, she and her daughter began to pack their bags. 
Then the show was picked up and she stayed -- for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
When "Alice" ended, she returned to theater and tried producing. 
</P>
<P>
She won an Academy Award for producing a documentary, "You Don't Have To Die," 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But Howland said she wants to return to acting, and it doesn't matter where. 
</P>
<P>
"I would really just like to work," she said. 
</P>
<P>
This will mark her second performance at the Old Globe Theatre but her debut 
performance in "Love Letters." 
</P>
<P>
"I love the characters, both of them," she said. "I love her sense of 
adventure, her zest for life, the way she never gives up and pushes on and 
tries to do her thing." 
</P>
<P>
Does she feel that being type-cast by her role as Vera has hurt her in getting 
other parts? 
</P>
<P>
"Type-casting is a problem on one hand. On the other hand, no one would know 
who I am if I hadn't done it." 
</P>
<P>
Type-casting doesn't seem to be a problem that worries Kimbrough, either. He 
said he could see doing "Murphy Brown" for "about 964 years. I'm very happy in 
it. And I love getting paid and going to work every day." 
</P>
<P>
But, despite his new-found success as a TV star, Kimbrough enjoys being back on 
the stage -- particularly in this play. 
</P>
<P>
The actor, in the process of getting divorced, is increasingly sensitive to the 
fragility of relationships, which is one of the themes of the play. But he said 
that this affects his performance less than learning to trust the material -- 
that first lesson that he and Gurney and Gurney's producers just began to learn 
back in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"As an actor, usually you are paid to sing for your supper. Sing, dance, all 
those things. And here you are just reading these letters. I found one of the 
hardest things about the show is to trust how simple it all is. Then, during 
the week, you make all these discoveries. You find that just saying the letters 
out loud and being the character in a simple way is enough. The piece is so 
swell that the audience leans forward and you can put away the spangled tap 
shoes."

BREAKTHROUGH TV: A THINKING PERSON'S FESTIVAL; 
</P>
<P>
AFI'S 4-DAY PROGRAM OF VIDEOS, AMONG THEM PETER GREENAWAY'S IMPOSING 'TV 
DANTE,' EXPANDS THE ART FORM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seems only natural that one of the highlights of the American Film 
Institute's National Video Festival -- Peter Greenaway and Tom Phillips' "TV 
Dante" -- has been described as "a thinking person's pop video." 
</P>
<P>
That's a glib label for a rich, unprecedented work, but it points to an 
overwhelming impression left by the festival. Since venues for the exploding 
field of video works are absurdly few, the need for a thinking person's MTV is 
greater than ever. 
</P>
<P>
If what AFI has amassed is any indication, a programmer for this MTV of the 
future would have no shortage of choices. Even a casual visit to the festival 
will suggest the quantity of work that you won't see on PBS or cable. This is 
AFI's 10th annual video survey, running Thursday through Sunday at various 
locations on the AFI campus in Hollywood. Even though all events are free and 
most have repeat screenings, it doesn't lessen the absurdity that you have to 
leave your house to see such great television. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it's a chance to experience television in a public setting, 
sometimes with the videomakers in person (guests include Beth B., whose 
"Belladonna" screens Saturday at 9 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m., and Norman and 
Bruce Yonemoto, whose "Made in Hollywood" plays Friday at 7 p.m. and Saturday 
at 10 a.m.). 
</P>
<P>
Other events include opening ceremonies honoring winners of the Robert M. 
Bennett Awards for outstanding local television productions (Thursday, 6 p.m.); 
a tribute to the great film and video experimentalist, Ed Emshwiller (Thursday, 
9 p.m.); and a panel discussion with "Twin Peaks" co-creator Mark Frost and 
Harley Peyton, one of the show's writers, on the program's impact on 
alternative TV (Friday, 9 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
Though the festival devotes much of Thursday and Friday to the recent and 
not-so-recent past -- surveys of Eastern European work and Cold War-era TV from 
the Peabody Collection (see Howard Rosenberg's column) -- its heart and soul is 
new work. While that means that the genuinely visionary sits alongside the 
insistently polemical and the pretentiously fashionable, it's also clear that 
video has replaced film as the medium of choice for independent moving-image 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, if the festival has a star, it's film director Greenaway ("The Cook, 
The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover"), represented not only by "TV Dante," 
(Saturday, 7 p.m.; Sunday, noon) but by a chilling, funny, profound look at 
history and mortality, "Death in the Seine" (Friday, 4:45 p.m.; Saturday, 9 
p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
"Seine" contemplates what might have happened to 23 of 306 people who drowned 
in the Paris river at the height of the French Revolution. Greenaway, using 
records kept by meticulous morticians (wittily played by Jean-Michel Dagory and 
Jim van der Woude), creates a macabre tone poem on death's inevitability and a 
poignant, humanizing study of victims of social upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
"TV Dante" is a delirious celebration of video art and a genuinely post-modern 
examination of Dante's "Inferno." This first of Dante's three-part "The Divine 
Comedy" was divided into 33 cantos, or sections. Greenaway and Phillips' 
work-in-progress is up to Canto 8 (each about 10 minutes long), but it's 
already a landmark in how video can interact with and enrich texts. 
</P>
<P>
Actors Bob Peck (Dante) and John Gielgud (Virgil) utter the verse in stark head 
shots as frames within frames of images rush by, including experts -- among 
them, naturalist David Attenborough -- amusingly placed on screen as visual 
footnotes explaining Dante's endless allusions. Greenaway and Phillips expand 
on the poet's subtle critique of his society by layering in their own critiques 
of society of the video age. 
</P>
<P>
Gianni Toti's "Squeezeangezaum" (Friday, 7 p.m.; Sunday, 10 a.m.) intends to be 
an abstract reverie on the ideas of Soviet poet Vladimir Chlebnikov. More heat 
than light is shed on those ideas, which dwell a lot on wordplay, but, at its 
best, "Squeezeangezaum" is a wild, unique marriage of Italian Futurism and 
1920s Soviet modernism. 
</P>
<P>
Marianne Trench's "Cyberpunk" (billed with Mark Rappaport's predictable love 
tragedy, "Postcards" on Saturday, 12:15 p.m.; Sunday, noon) is a tantalizing, 
incomplete guide to the underground computer movement of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is known as a hotbed of videomaking, but a festival centerpiece, 
the L.A.-based Yonemoto brothers' "Made in Hollywood," proves to be a shallow, 
ersatz soap opera on the evils of Tinseltown. More interesting gems can be 
found in two programs covering Southland artists, "L.A. Freewaves Preview" 
(Friday, 7 p.m.; Saturday, 12:15 p.m.) and "Open Channels 6," curated by the 
Long Beach Museum of Art (Thursday, 8 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
Nothing in the festival is as private yet as universal as David Larcher's 
complex memoir of his dying grandmother, "Granny's Is" (billed with the 
pretentious "The In-Between" on Friday, 9 p.m.; Saturday, 4:45 p.m.). In a 
sense, Larcher's may be one of the most artful home videos ever made. 
</P>
<P>
A mother's death is also at the center of one of the best in the New Works 
category, Janice Tanaka's gorgeous "Memories From the Department of Amnesia" 
(Saturday, 2:30 p.m.; Sunday, 10 a.m.). Tanaka, in shifting styles and moods, 
reflects on survivors of wartime Japanese-American internment camps, and two 
other works focus on Japan itself: Louis Alvarez and Andrew Kolker's 
marvelously droll "The Japanese Version" (Saturday, 9 p.m.; Sunday, 10 a.m.) 
observes how Japan appropriates products of American pop culture, while the 
hidden anti-materialistic Japan is uncovered in Edin Velez's atmospheric survey 
of Butoh dance, "Dance of Darkness" (Friday, 4:45 p.m.; Saturday, 9 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
Things hidden in general -- culturally and historically -- become a running 
concern of the festival. Laura Kipnis' rather silly "Marx: The Video" 
(Saturday, 9 p.m.; Sunday, 2 p.m.) tries to understand Karl Marx through his 
decaying physical condition, and Paris Poirier's loving but bland "Last Call at 
Maud's" (Saturday, 9 p.m.; Sunday, 10 a.m.) tells how a San Francisco lesbian 
bar became the gathering spot for a movement. 
</P>
<P>
The finest video histories are vividly contrasting. Barbara Kopple's "Out of 
Darkness" (Saturday, 4:45; Sunday, 10 a.m.) becomes a passionate ode to the 
American mine worker and any labor movement that battles horrible odds; John 
Jeremy's superb "Swing Under the Swastika" (Saturday, 4:45 p.m.; Sunday, 4 
p.m.) stylishly profiles another set of heroes -- German lovers of swing jazz 
who risked imprisonment and death under the Nazi regime. 
</P>
<P>
MTV with brains also means music videos with a mind, and that's nowhere better 
exemplified than Rob Nilsson's personalized document, "Words for the Dying" 
(Friday, 7 p.m.; Saturday, 10 a.m.), about how John Cale and Brian Eno recorded 
Cale's symphonic work, "The Falklands Suite." As with so many of the festival's 
entries, Nilsson makes us aware of the camera (Eno is terrified of it) and of 
video's responsibility to its subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Now, when was the last time you saw that on television?

HOWARD ROSENBERG: AFI'S 'COLD WAR IMAGES': WHEN TV RALLIED 'ROUND THE FLAG; 
</P>
<P>
VIDEOS: THE ROLE OF TV AS POLITICAL PERSUADER IS EXAMINED IN A PROGRAM OPENING 
THURSDAY AT AMERICAN FILM INSTITUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
One is just about dead, the other brawnier than ever. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Cold War and American television came of age almost simultaneously in 
the late 1940s, each destructively feeding off the other. 
</P>
<P>
The ensuing TV-industry offensive against society's "red menace" became an 
electronic blood bath that media scholar J. Fred MacDonald calls America's 
first "television war." It wasn't that the Kremlin and its pals didn't deserve 
a measure of enmity, only that MacDonald believes this constant video overkill 
gave Americans a warped sense of East vs. West that ultimately desensitized 
them politically when it came to United States involvement in Southeast Asia in 
the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Hence it's possible that the Vietnam War that TV helped stop was also helped 
started by the medium. 
</P>
<P>
True or not, there's no question that, in its early days, TV helped shape 
public opinion -- just as it did during last December's U.S. invasion of 
Panama. And just as it does today with the Persian Gulf, featuring President 
Bush and Iraq President Saddam Hussein as adversaries on the nightly news 
instead of Ike and Stalin. 
</P>
<P>
It's useful to flash back and identify the connecting threads. 
</P>
<P>
And we can, thanks to the American Film Institute's National Video Festival, 
which runs Thursday through Sunday at the AFI campus in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Among the works being exhibited is a variety of television programs from the 
Peabody Collection at the University of Georgia titled "Cold War Images." And 
despite the relative crudeness of the technology, what powerful images these 
are, at once mirroring the American mentality of that era (the late '40s 
through early '60s) and reminding us of TV's crucial and often worrisome role 
in Cold War politics. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Scare paranoia of the years immediately following World War II had a 
basis in actual events, from the Soviet blockade of Berlin in 1948 to the 
Kremlin's atom bomb tests. And the just-developing TV industry, itself fearful 
of being labeled unpatriotic, helped whip up the frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to envision now, but a popular syndicated series of the time 
(1953-56) was "I Led Three Lives" (which is not part of the festival). Although 
based on the real-life experiences of Herbert A. Philbrick -- an American 
Communist and double agent for the FBI -- the series was replete with 
stereotypes and fed the fear that "your best friend may be a traitor." Worst of 
all, a Commie traitor. 
</P>
<P>
Such was the climate. 
</P>
<P>
Although the AFI's "Cold War Images" includes examples of TV bucking the Red 
scare, it's the opposite case that is most interesting. There are no shadings 
and gradations in these Red depictions, only a demonic monolith. Instead of 
helping us understand our enemy, TV usually distorted and stereotyped him. 
</P>
<P>
An example in the AFI festival is an "Auto-Lite Theatre" production from 1951 
called "Train from Czechoslovakia," starring Richard Kiley as a Czech engineer 
who hijacks a train to the West. Although based on a true story, it 
unrealistically depicts a Red realm in which merely inquiring why a train is 
late can put you in jail. And, interestingly, its two acts are separated by a 
commercial asking viewers to "help fight communism" by supporting an 
organization called Crusade for Freedom. 
</P>
<P>
You'll find no better view of the notorious House Committee on Un-American 
Activities (HUAC) -- a congressional committee that fed irrational fears with 
smear tactics -- than in a 1953 episode of NBC's "American Forum of the Air." 
</P>
<P>
In this revealing half hour, a HUAC member and a courageous Methodist bishop 
clash over the committee's methods, with the sputtering California congressman 
making wild charges against the bishop and the church right on the air as host 
Frank Blair sits silently between the two men. Viewed through 1990 eyes, this 
is a devastating expose of the HUAC and its utter hyprocrisy, affirming that 
the committee was far more un-American than most of those it attacked. 
</P>
<P>
The program ends with a commercial for U.S. Defense Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Another particularly revealing program here is called "Soap Box." Produced in 
1955 by a St. Louis station, it re-enacts an actual hearing in which a black 
federal employee was interrogated about his alleged affiliation with the 
Communist party, a charge he denied. 
</P>
<P>
Recited from the transcript, the questioning of the defendant conveys an ugly 
message of the times, linking civil rights to communism. 
</P>
<P>
Question: "Have you ever told any friends that the Negroes in this country were 
very downtrodden?" Question: "Do you resent it (discrimination) to the extent 
you would want to do something about it?" Question: "Has anyone ever pointed 
out that discrimination, and told you perhaps for that reason you shouldn't 
have faith in your government?" 
</P>
<P>
Later, there's a reference to anything "inter-racial" being considered "out of 
the ordinary." 
</P>
<P>
As we ultimately learn, the man was found innocent of the Commie charge and 
returned to his federal job -- as a furniture mover. 
</P>
<P>
Also included in "Cold War Images" are two 1961 programs from the post-Sputnik 
years. These are about fallout shelters, the mere emphasis of which implied 
that the U.S. could somehow survive attack from a Soviet strike, making nuclear 
war somehow more acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
The first program, from KPIX in San Francisco, is a cheery account of 100 
volunteers spending 48 hours in a shelter, where the worst problems they 
encountered were noise and heat. 
</P>
<P>
What about food? "This experimental wafer . . . will keep us alive and 
healthy," a man says. What about keeping the kids occupied? No problem: "A 
youngster with a piece of paper and a crayon can do fine." 
</P>
<P>
In the second program, a Des Moines station somberly gives an hour of 
instruction on how to finance (alternative payment plans are discussed), build 
and survive in fallout shelters. This includes countering the inevitable "mob 
violence." One sequence shows a shelter occupant using a rifle to drive off a 
mob of men. 
</P>
<P>
Although separated by nearly three decades in some cases, there's a link 
between these Cold War videos and a 1990 film by Andrew P. Jones that is also 
part of the AFI festival. 
</P>
<P>
A recipient of a Robert M. Bennett award from the AFI this year, "Panama: Just 
Cause" is Jones' first-person account of being in Panama immediately prior to 
and during the U.S. invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Although journalistically flawed and confusing in parts, Jones' documentary 
does give a sense of ordinary Panamanians and his own personal terror over 
being caught in the cross fire of this one-sided miniwar. 
</P>
<P>
He ends his film with a curious visual "crawl" that indicts "myself and my 
media colleagues for not paying closer attentions to the Panamanian casualties 
and for allowing ourselves to be literally spoon-fed by the (U.S.) military. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
Although there is nothing in the film to even remotely justify this admonition, 
it does apply to much of the initial coverage of the U.S. invasion and 
overthrow of Gen. Manuel A. Noriega. In the early stages, TV in particular was 
as much a casualty as the dictator Noriega and his overmatched Panama Defense 
Forces. 
</P>
<P>
With "official sources" prevailing, the tone of the coverage was this: Might 
made right, the "surgical" nature of the U.S. military operation limited 
civilian casualties, Noriega's red underwear and alleged kinky sex life alone 
made him unfit to rule, and the powdery white stuff found in his house -- and 
displayed for reporters by U.S. military -- just had to be cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Only later were questions raised about the justness of "Operation Just Cause" 
as well as the civilian casualty reports. The business about the cocaine -- 
which turned out be flour -- was just one of the stories uncritically reported 
by much of the media in their rush to hew the government line.

CITY, NEIGHBORS HAVE HAD IT WITH THE VILLAS

SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Voltaire was built in 1964, it seemed like half of Santa Ana wanted to 
move there. 
</P>
<P>
Designed in a New Orleans style, the 562 garden apartments had wrought-iron 
balconies, all-electric appliances, carports, two swimming pools, a 
palm-studded landscape -- and a waiting list. "It was very fancy," said Santa 
Ana Police Chief Paul Walters, who said the complex even won an architectural 
award. 
</P>
<P>
But the swimming pools were algae-green and closed on Tuesday, one day after 
three young men were murdered in what police suspect was a soured cocaine deal. 
The carports were torn down years ago after homeless people began sleeping 
inside. And 15 feet from the complex, a visitor stepped on a spent syringe. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a yearlong clean-up effort, the complex at 811 S. Fairview St., now 
called Fairview Villas, remains a haven for drug dealers, police and neighbors 
said. On Tuesday, Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young said he would like to see it 
torn down. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the mayor and the police chief believe that dealers from other 
neighborhoods are attracted to the complex by the very design features that 
made it a hit in the 1960s: meandering garden paths, concealing foliage and a 
labyrinth of 84 buildings into which to vanish when the cops are in pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't say it's the worst complex in town. The people who live there say it," 
said Dorothy L. Davis, who runs a day-care center for 78 children across the 
street. A year ago, Davis went to the Santa Ana City Council to beg for help. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a house of prostitution and a supermarket of drugs . . . ," said Jerry 
Vouaelotas, who owns the nearby Husky Boy Restaurant. "We have been screaming 
for six years." 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1989, the mayor announced a crackdown. Police ran several sweeps 
and stepped up patrols. The apartment managers spruced up the paint, pruned 
shadowy bushes and installed security gates and floodlights. They also 
distributed bilingual flyers asking tenants to blow the whistle on dope deals, 
offering a $25 reward for each arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran a lot of drug dealers out of the area," said Police Sgt. Chuck Deakins, 
who heads the neighborhood's patrol unit. "But a small number of them still 
hang out around the complex." 
</P>
<P>
Things did improve markedly for a while, Davis and other neighbors said, but 
lately the city's attention seems to have waned. The other day, Davis called 
police to complain about a group of young men who were drinking, carousing and 
urinating in the complex in plain sight of her children. "It took them three or 
four hours to come run them off," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday morning, Davis read of the triple murder in the newspaper and rushed 
down to the day-care center to reassure jumpy parents that their children would 
be safe. Then, fed up with City Hall, she stormed over to Congressman Robert K. 
Dornan's Garden Grove office to complain. 
</P>
<P>
"It was getting better . . . ," Davis said. "The minute those people found out 
that the city was on their case, they straightened out. The minute they found 
out the city didn't care they were right back on it again." 
</P>
<P>
"Some people have self-discipline, and some people need to be watched," Davis 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 5,000 people, mostly Latino immigrants, live in the block-square complex, 
police and neighbors said. Rents range up to $805 a month for a two-bedroom 
unit -- not cheap, even by Santa Ana standards -- with an average of two 
families per apartment. 
</P>
<P>
A county welfare official said the ZIP code in which the complex is located has 
one of the heaviest welfare and food stamp caseloads in the county. When a 
Latino community group offered free classes in how to apply for immigration 
amnesty, about 100 families from the complex attended, said Nativo V. Lopez, 
director of the organization Hermandad Mexicana Nacional of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, the complex flew the Mexican flag alongside Old Glory and the 
California Bear. A security guard said the practice was stopped because too 
many flags were torn or stolen. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the complex manager referred questions to Cambio Properties Inc. of 
Fullerton, which manages the villas, but Cambio executives did not return 
telephone calls. County records show the property is owned by Cambio President 
Allen L. Boerner, who also did not return calls. The property was last assessed 
at $22.7 million, records show. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday morning, in one of the numerous small, grassy courtyards within the 
complex, Leonardo Sandoval, 34, stood playing catch with his 3-year-old niece. 
He lives on the other side of the complex and hadn't heard about the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here about a year, and I haven't really had any problems," said the 
native of Michoacan, Mexico. "But sometimes the police come and take some 
people away. And sometimes you hear gunfire." 
</P>
<P>
Housewife Rosa Perez, who lives about 50 yards into the complex from where the 
shootings took place, was washing her living-room window as her two daughters 
played on the porch outside. 
</P>
<P>
Perez said she moved to the Villas because it seemed like a safer, quieter 
neighborhood than the Madison Street complex they lived in previously. For the 
most part, she still thinks it's a good place to live. 
</P>
<P>
"But there are a lot of people, and a lot of vagos," or riffraff from outside 
the area, Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
Porfirio Diaz, 23, lives with six others in a two-bedroom apartment upstairs 
from where one of Monday's victims died. A high school graduate from Mexico 
City, Diaz is now an unemployed construction worker, dissatisfied with his 
surroundings but unsure of where else to go. 
</P>
<P>
"Drugs are something you can't avoid in this country," Diaz said. "And where am 
I going to move to? It's cheap here, because there are a lot of Latinos here." 
</P>
<P>
But Diaz, local business people and community activist Lopez all said the 
complex management should pay more to police its property better. Several local 
businesses and bars have banded together to hire their own security guards. And 
several neighbors noted that the guards at the villas' security gates do not 
wear uniforms, are unarmed and are often not at their stations. 
</P>
<P>
"The manager should take care of his property," said Davis. "I'm not saying the 
police aren't doing their work, 'cause Lord knows we need more police. I say 
the manager has to take care of it." 
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday evening, neighbors had placed lighted candles on the lawn where the 
three bodies had fallen. One 70-year-old woman said the killings do not 
frighten her. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here too long," said Gladys Cram, who has lived in a house across 
the road on Sullivan Street since the mid-1930s, when the complex was a 
vegetable farm. 
</P>
<P>
"The (drug dealers') runners would be over on my side of the street, and I'd 
tell them to get off my property," Cram said. "I wouldn't dream of being afraid 
of them. . . . I've found needles in my front yard, but they don't scare me." 
</P>
<P>
Cram, who keeps a sharp eye on the guard shack from her front window, says 
things have gotten better -- though while she chatted on the phone, she noted 
that, once again, the guards were not at their post. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care what goes on on the other side of the property, but don't mess 
with me on my property," Cram said. "That's been my theory and people don't 
bother me."

PROP. 128 MIGHT DOUBLE MOST SEWER BILLS IN O.C.; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: MOST COUNTY OFFICIALS OPPOSE BIG GREEN, CONTENDING THE PRESENT 
TREATMENT SYSTEM IS ADEQUATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A little-known provision of the sweeping Big Green initiative could force 
Orange County to double the sewer bills of most residents and spend $1.4 
billion to improve its system for treating waste before it is pumped into the 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, most city and county officials in Orange County oppose the 
statewide environmental initiative on the Nov. 6 ballot, arguing that the 
county's existing sewage treatment already safeguards the ocean and that the 
costly project would yield negligible benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists contend that the improvements are necessary because 
California's ocean waters are being filled with millions of gallons of waste 
every day that could pose a risk to swimmers and turn waters into "dead zones" 
for marine life. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, there will be sudden and irreversible collapse of the ocean 
ecosystem, and we don't think it's worth the risk," said Carl Pope, the Sierra 
Club's deputy conservation director and an author of Proposition 128, better 
known as Big Green. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is a provision generally overlooked amid the initiative's wider issues 
of global warming, ozone depletion and pesticide use. 
</P>
<P>
It would require all sewage to undergo secondary treatment, an advanced process 
that eliminates 85% of solid pollutants, before it is released into the ocean 
or waterways, beginning in the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Such treatment is required by federal law, but Orange County is the largest of 
60 areas nationwide that have been granted an exemption from the Environmental 
Protection Agency, mainly because its effluent is considered "high quality" and 
is released five miles out to sea. Only three small towns in California have 
similar waivers. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see any justified reason to spend $1.4 billion when there's no 
demonstrated problem," said J. Wayne Sylvester, general manager of the Orange 
County Sanitation Districts. "Based on the scientific work we did and the ocean 
monitoring, we believe very strongly that the current program protects the 
ocean." 
</P>
<P>
The higher sewer rates and a cleaner ocean are the factors in Big Green that 
could have the most direct impact on Orange County residents. The far-reaching 
ballot measure also sets up a $500-million oil-spill fund, phases out 
cancer-causing pesticides, cuts greenhouse gases by 20%, conserves redwoods and 
tackles many other environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
The high cost of Proposition 128 is the major ammunition being used by 
opponents, who estimate that its implementation will cost California $8 billion 
to $12 billion per year. Environmentalists dispute that figure, saying 
Californians will eventually save money in health and environmental costs. 
</P>
<P>
A Times Poll conducted last week showed Californians are split on the 
proposition: 44% oppose the measure and 42% support it. 
</P>
<P>
The focal point of the sewage debate is a pipeline that stretches from the 
shore of Huntington Beach near Brookhurst Avenue five miles out to sea, resting 
on a bed of rocks at a depth of 200 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Every day, 260 million gallons of waste water is discharged into the ocean 
through the pipeline. Half of this has undergone secondary treatment, while the 
other half has undergone a less thorough stage of treatment called advanced 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
Under the existing system, an average of 75% of the solid substances in Orange 
County's sewage is eliminated, compared to 85% if all of it were subjected to 
secondary treatment. The difference amounts to about 32 tons of solids a day 
pumped into the ocean, according to a sanitation agency report. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, 370 pounds of toxics a day would be discharged, instead of the 
current 550 pounds, the report said. Bacteria concentrations -- an indicator of 
viruses and other threats -- would drop from the 1.3 million organisms per 100 
milliliters using the current system to 200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Sanitation officials say the initiative might not apply to Orange County's 
sewage because, unlike that of other areas, it is discharged in federal waters 
that are beyond the usual 3-mile state limits. If the measure passes, legal 
challenges are probably the only way the issue will be resolved in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists who drafted Big Green said they hadn't considered Orange 
County's unique situation with its deep-sea pipeline. But they intended the 
county to be included, and they believe the courts would agree. 
</P>
<P>
"They would have to comply unless they can demonstrate it doesn't reach state 
waters. But the ocean doesn't work that way," the Sierra Club's Pope said. 
"Orange County's (waste) winds up in our waters." 
</P>
<P>
To pay for the improved treatment system, sewer bills would increase for about 
2 million Orange County residents, from Irvine north to the county line, who 
are served by the Orange County Sanitation Districts. South County residents 
are served by different agencies that already comply. 
</P>
<P>
An average residential sewer bill would gradually increase from the current $53 
per year to $113 if the county switched to full secondary treatment, sanitation 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Almost two years ago, the sanitation agency conducted a study on the costs and 
impact of switching to full secondary treatment. Officials concluded at that 
time, before Big Green was drafted, that it would cost $1.4 billion to build 
new facilities and improve the existing ones. Because of the high cost, the 
board decided last year to apply for a 5-year renewal of the federal waiver 
instead, and it is now under consideration by the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists agree that the sewage project would be expensive, but they 
said they doubt that it would cost $1.4 billion, since half the sewage already 
receives secondary treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The county's sanitation board, made up mostly of city council members and 
county supervisors, voted 29 to 1 earlier this month to oppose the initiative, 
saying it imposed "significant cost with no discernible benefit." 
</P>
<P>
Marine scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, including 
Roger Revelle and Edward Goldberg, are among those opposed to spending money on 
secondary treatment because they say there is no scientific evidence that it is 
needed. Revelle, director emeritus of Scripps, is the nation's premier marine 
expert, and Goldberg, a chemist, won the Tyler Prize in 1989, one of the 
highest awards for environmental achievements. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County sanitation agency's study concluded that the bacteria and 
other pollutants in the treated sewage pose no risk to public health because 
they are dumped far offshore after being diluted. The impact on marine life is 
less certain. Marine biologists say the mix of tiny worms, clams and other 
organisms in the 16 acres of ocean floor around Orange County's discharge pipe 
has changed, but scientists have not determined if the changes are bad, good, 
or insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Peter M. Green of Huntington Beach, the city most affected by the 
effluent, is a supporter of Big Green. 
</P>
<P>
Green said the initiative has so many clauses that are important to Orange 
County, such as creating an oil-spill cleanup fund and giving state health 
officials some authority over malathion spraying, that it deserves voter 
approval.

'ANGEL WAS INNOCENT,' UNCLE SAYS OF SLAIN TEEN-AGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Sixteen-year-old Angel Brito-Guadarrama went to Fairview Villas to visit a 
cousin Monday night. His uncle says the trip cost him his life. 
</P>
<P>
"He went over there because he has a bunch of cousins living over there," said 
Cleto Brito-Guadarrama, who shared an apartment with his nephew and Angel's 
older brother, Luis, 19. "He was a good boy. He had a job and he paid his own 
bills." 
</P>
<P>
When a gunman opened fire on Angel and several other young men as they stood 
near a bank of pay telephones shortly after 10 p.m., the teen-ager turned and 
tried to run. But after 25 yards, he collapsed and died from three bullet 
wounds in the chest, one of three victims in what police suspect was a 
drug-related shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"Angel was innocent, he had nothing, nothing at all to do with any drugs," his 
uncle insisted Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The handsome lad with thick, dark hair, like his brother before him, left 
Mexico to escape its poverty, the uncle said. His parents, who remained in 
Iguala, a small pueblo in the Mexican state of Guerrero, where Angel grew up, 
are so poor that "they can't even afford to pay the local mill to grind their 
corn," the youth's uncle said. 
</P>
<P>
Angel was a worldly teen-ager and owned a car he had bought from his earnings 
as a day laborer at construction sites in Orange County. He had been in the 
United States only 11 months, his uncle said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was only 16, Angel lied to prospective employers, saying he was 18. 
His uncle said the youth used his older brother's immigration card to persuade 
employers that he was of age and in the United States legally. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives said he was a happy teen-ager, more involved in physical exercise and 
weight-lifting than the sort of violence that claimed his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I called his parents by telephone and gave them the news that he had been shot 
to death. Now we don't know how we're going to pay to have him shipped out of 
here and back to Mexico where the family wants to bury him," the uncle said. 
</P>
<P>
Luis, who had accompanied Angel to Fairview Villas from their apartment on 
South Euclid Street in Santa Ana, ran to his brother's aid after Angel had been 
shot. But Angel did not respond. 
</P>
<P>
"I was calling for help," said Luis Brito-Guadarrama, sitting on a stairway 
within the same complex Tuesday, wearing tennis shoes splattered with his 
brother's blood. "But no one helped me." 
</P>
<P>
Police hesitated to say whether Angel was an innocent party to the fatal 
shooting. Santa Ana Police Lt. Robert Helton said police investigators were 
trying to unravel the evidence and interview witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
The other two dead men were Mario David Mora, 23, of Santa Ana, and Noel 
Herrera Arroyo, 20, of Santa Ana. Miguel Angel Toledo Soto, 22, who was shot in 
the head, remained in serious condition at UCI Medical Center in Orange, a 
hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
At the apartment of Angel's uncle, several of the youth's relatives tried to 
make sense of the violent shooting that took the young man's life. Most blamed 
the growing drug epidemic, which they said is consuming that part of Santa 
Ana's Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
"You want my opinion?" said Fabian Reyessa, who is married to a cousin of 
Angel's. "This is all a consequence of the drug problem. I used to live in 
those same apartments, and that's all you see over there every day is people 
selling drugs. I had a (truck) battery stolen and I had my truck stolen. It's a 
bad place to raise a family."

CCC PLANS TO SET UP TWO OIL SPILL CLEANUP TEAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Conservation Corps announced Tuesday that it plans to set up two 
permanent strike teams of 100 members apiece -- one in Southern California and 
one in Northern California -- to help clean up oil spills. 
</P>
<P>
The teams, which are expected to be fully trained and ready by next summer, 
will be the first full-time cleanup crews stationed on shore anywhere in the 
nation, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have two teams ready to respond at a moment's notice," said Bud Sheble, 
state director of the CCC. "We don't know anyone else who will have a large, 
pre-trained strike team like this." 
</P>
<P>
The CCC is a group of 2,000 men and women between the ages of 18 and 23 
involved in natural resources work. 
</P>
<P>
The new program will be started with a $75,000 donation made to the CCC on 
Tuesday by BP America, the company that owned the oil that fouled Orange County 
beaches in February. The CCC also has been promised $150,000 from a new state 
oil spill contingency fund established by the Legislature beginning July 1. The 
remaining funds, about $200,000, are expected to be donated by other oil 
companies by April, Sheble said. 
</P>
<P>
CCC officials met Tuesday with representatives of BP, Chevron, Shell and Arco. 
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that the oil industry will support us. We have no commitment 
yet to actual dollar amounts, but we have a very definite commitment from at 
least Chevron that they'll support this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with BP America, a division of British Petroleum, said they were 
impressed with the 200 CCC members who helped them clean up the 400,000 gallons 
of crude oil that spilled from a tanker off Huntington Beach in February. 
</P>
<P>
"During the cleanup in Huntington Beach, people from BP would look down from 
helicopters and see this group of uniformed people, and they were impressed 
with the commitment, leadership and work ethic that the CCC has," Sheble said. 
"But we told them we can do an even better job if we were pre-trained, and 
that's where the idea came from." Chuck Webster, crisis manager for BP America, 
said the 200 CCC members who helped with the Huntington Beach spill "were some 
of the best resources we had out there." 
</P>
<P>
"They brought with them a sense of discipline and organization that impressed 
us. We were wary at first because of their age, but they dispelled any thought 
of that and gave excellent results," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The oil company hired about 1,000 workers in a five-week cleanup of the oil 
that soaked 15 miles of beaches in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest problems in cleaning up oil is rapidly mobilizing enough 
workers and equipment. The only 24-hour crews that now exist for handling 
spills are the oil industry's emergency cooperatives that clean up oil at sea, 
not on land. 
</P>
<P>
Once the rest of funding comes through, extensive training of crews will begin 
in May, and the teams should be in place by June, Sheble said. The teams will 
receive training approved by state and federal occupational-health agencies and 
participate in annual drills with oil companies and government officials. 
</P>
<P>
All 2,000 CCC members will receive some training, and a core group of around 
600 will receive extensive training to ensure that there are at least 200 
available at all times, Sheble said. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Bontadelli, director of the state Department of Fish and Game, which 
oversees oil spill cleanup, said the program is "an indication of the positive 
working relationship we're attaining with the oil industry in our efforts to 
further protect our environment from oil mishaps."

DANA PARSONS: HANG ON FOR THE SUDDEN RIGHT TURN AT GENERATION GAP

<P>
A couple of summers ago, my sister and her 12-year-old daughter visited for the 
weekend. We were taking a walk in the neighborhood when my niece playfully 
beseeched me to carry her the last block to the house, claiming she was too 
tired to walk the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
I played along, lugging her on my back but telling her she was getting too big 
for such treatment. Since she visited only once a year, I remember telling her, 
"This is probably the last time I'll be able to do this for you." 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend my niece, on the cusp of her 14th birthday, parachuted alone into 
my bachelor encampment. When she left 36 hours later, I didn't know whether to 
laugh or cry. 
</P>
<P>
Is being 14 some elaborate hoax these kids play on adults, or are they really 
serious? Do they dream up this behavior all by themselves, or do they get 
together in small packs outside convenience stores in the middle of the night 
and hatch strategies? You can't mean that parents actually go through this 
seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
Let me say without equivocation that I love my niece. She doesn't seem to have 
a mean bone in her body and seems to have the same cheery disposition she's 
always had. 
</P>
<P>
But first thing Saturday morning . . . 
</P>
<P>
I was tipped early that the times they are a-changin' when we were getting 
ready to go out for breakfast. I got ready in my standard 3.5 minutes and 
waited downstairs for Fawn. Fifteen minutes. Twenty. Twenty-five. Half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
There were no sounds coming from the bathroom but the occasional shoosh of hair 
spray. 
</P>
<P>
At the 45-minute mark, I yelled that I was leaving. She came downstairs, 
looking as if she was heading for the junior-senior prom at Twin Peaks High 
School. Hair piled up and sprayed into place in a kind of modified peacock's 
tail. Too much mascara. Too heavy on the deep-red lipstick. Wearing a black 
tube top covered with a sheer black top that looked more like lingerie than 
something to wear for waffles. And yes, black shades. 
</P>
<P>
As a flower child from way back, I couldn't bring myself to impose a dress code 
on her. After all, I signed a petition in high school in 1966 demanding that 
boys be allowed to have mustaches. So I didn't say anything other than, "We're 
only going for breakfast, you know." 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know how many people will see me, even at breakfast?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly, I didn't, but I took her to mean that even if it were one person, she 
had best be dressed to the nines. 
</P>
<P>
So on we went. When heads turned to look at her in the restaurant, she was 
convinced that it was because she had made the correct fashion statement. I was 
hoping that people in the restaurant would think she was getting an early jump 
on Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
All of this was no big deal. I rationalized that it is a teen-age phase, and 
who cares, really, if everyone else in the restaurant thought I was a parental 
flop. 
</P>
<P>
But then came Saturday night . . . 
</P>
<P>
We were driving home from the Ice Capades in L.A., bopping down the 405, just a 
groovy uncle and his hip niece, listening to some rap music on the radio. The 
station was playing a "power jam," and I hear the lyrics (and I have to 
paraphrase), "You can do me in the morning/You can do me at night/You can do me 
any time you want to do me." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in this power jam, other songs were equally or more suggestive; one 
long invitation to some quick and easy sex. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not hopping on the censorship train, but neither am I scornful of people 
who want to talk about lyrical content in a non-censoring context. It's a 
conversation worth having. Those lyrics sound a lot different to you as an 
adult when you have a 14-year-old in the seat next to you. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't make Fawn change stations, but I had to let off some steam. I gave her 
a 30-second stream of consciousness about how irresponsible I thought the 
lyrics were and how it made sex sound like some game without consequences. 
</P>
<P>
She didn't say anything. At the end of the power jam, an ad came on for Trojan 
condoms. Fawn looked at me and smiled sheepishly. 
</P>
<P>
I drove on, torn between new-found anger at the music and long-held anger at 
the many conditions that make teen-age kids so potentially vulnerable. I wanted 
to give Fawn a stem-winder of a speech, but I didn't. So, we didn't talk the 
rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, she had turned and was looking out the window, singing along with the 
next power jam and lost in her 14-year-old world that's probably farther away 
than I can possibly imagine.

TWO GROUPS RALLY BEHIND SHERIFF GATES;

<P>
Sheriff Brad Gates' closest supporters and the county's police chiefs have 
rallied behind him in the wake of a $246,000 verdict awarded two private 
investigators who alleged that Gates' gun permit process was fraught with 
favoritism. 
</P>
<P>
Within three weeks of the Sept. 28 judgment, the Chiefs and Sheriff's Assn. of 
Orange County and the sheriff's campaign committee, the Friends of Brad Gates, 
sent out hundreds of letters to county leaders and Gates' extensive network of 
political backers. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the sheriff's boosters view the verdict narrowly, saying Gates was 
cleared of major allegations of favoritism in awarding gun permits. But the 
lawyer for the other side contends that those charges of favoritism figured 
into the jury's overall findings. 
</P>
<P>
Support from the chiefs association came in the form of a unanimous vote of 
confidence in Gates and a specific request to the County Board of Supervisors 
to pay any punitive damages if they are assessed against the sheriff at a 
second stage of the court case set for Nov. 14. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, the Friends of Brad Gates letter praised the sheriff, criticized 
the media and took a swipe at the winners of the case, who committee members 
said did not deserve gun permits. 
</P>
<P>
"We are proud to stand up for Brad and tell him that we think he is doing a 
great job," the mailer states. "Most important to him, though, is that you know 
that he has been deserving of your confidence in his conduct of the 
responsibilities of his office." 
</P>
<P>
But all the damage control might hurt rather than help, say Frank Ritter and 
his brother Ty, who won the $246,000. Their attorney is planning to use the 
effort on behalf of the sheriff in trying to convince a federal jury next month 
that Gates should pay punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
"His reaction in every single case is 'I am innocent, I am not going to 
change,' no matter what the court ruled," said Meir J. Westreich, the Ritters' 
lawyer. "To get him to stop this you need a court ruling because Gates and his 
supporters will argue to the bitter end that he did not do it." 
</P>
<P>
The Ritters, both of Orange County, were denied the right to carry a concealed 
weapon six times in the late 1970s and early 1980s. They alleged in a federal 
civil rights lawsuit that Gates discriminated against them and oversaw a 
process that improperly issued many gun permits to political backers, wealthy 
business people, and friends of the sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
After three weeks of trial, the jury specifically found that the Ritters' 
failure to support the sheriff politically was not a motivating factor in the 
denials of their gun permits. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors found that the sheriff intentionally discriminated against the Ritters 
because they were in the business of private security. In addition, the jury 
found that Gates did not reject their gun permit applications solely because 
they had not shown "good cause" required for a permit. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the jury found that Gates acted with malice toward the Ritters or in 
reckless disregard of their constitutional rights, a finding that could result 
in Gates' paying additional punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the jury's decision, each side has offered an interpretation. 
Because the penalty phase hasn't begun yet, jurors have not been free to 
comment on their findings. 
</P>
<P>
After the verdict was announced, Gates declined to comment but issued a 
one-page prepared statement in which he said the jury "confirmed that we do not 
engage in political favoritism in the issuance of concealed weapons permits." 
</P>
<P>
Darryl R. Wold, the attorney for the Friends of Brad Gates, said the jury 
decided that the sheriff discriminated against the Ritters only because they 
were private investigators and made no broad finding that gun permits were 
issued improperly to anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
Westreich said the evidence about who received gun permits -- among them Gates 
supporters, successful business people, friends of the Sheriff's Department -- 
was supposed to be applied to all the findings the jury was asked to make. 
</P>
<P>
"What we were showing was that some occupations and groups were favored over 
others. Everything overlapped," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Westreich wants to use the statements of Gates, the chiefs association and his 
supporters to support the Ritters' claim for punitive damages when the issue is 
argued before the jury next month. He contends that the public relations 
efforts are ill-planned attempts to protect the sheriff and that even the 
jury's verdict has not stopped Gates from showing disregard for the Ritters. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's defense lawyer, Eric L. Dobberteen, declined to comment because 
the case is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Board of Supervisors dated Oct. 8, the chiefs association 
said the members had confidence in Gates' handling of gun permit applications. 
They said they want the county to pay any punitive damages because Gates was 
acting in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach Police Chief Neil J. Purcell, president of the association, said 
the group, which has members from 45 federal, state and local law enforcement 
agencies, did not review the Ritter case or the gun permit process before 
voting to support the sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
The chiefs association letter was followed on Oct. 15 by the Friends of Brad 
Gates mailer. Wold said members of the campaign committee thought something on 
the sheriff's behalf was necessary to defend Gates and correct inaccurate news 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
The mailer supported the sheriff's denial of gun permits to the Ritters. It 
mentioned the fact that Ty Ritter served time in prison for a firearms 
violation, and said evidence that he and his brother were mercenaries overseas 
"confirmed the wisdom of the Sheriff's Department." 
</P>
<P>
"We are not criticizing the jury. We are concerned about some of the press 
coverage and we wanted to give out what the jury verdict was," Wold said. "I 
very carefully tried to avoid commenting on the jury verdict." 
</P>
<P>
Although Gates approved the use of his campaign funds for the letter, he did 
not request the mailer nor participate in its writing. Gates' campaign manager, 
Eileen Padberg, helped with the mailing lists, Wold said. 
</P>
<P>
Gates declined to comment except to say, "I did not write the letter. I got a 
copy of it in the mail." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE JURY'S DECISION ON GATES 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 28, a federal jury awarded $246,000 to two private investigators who 
alleged that Sheriff Brad Gates' procedures for issuing gun permits were unfair 
and discriminated against them. Among several findings were the jury's 
conclusions that: 
</P>
<P>
1. The failure of plaintiffs Frank Ritter and Ty Ritter "to support the 
sheriff's political program was not a substantial or motivating factor in the 
denial of" their applications for concealed weapons permits. 
</P>
<P>
2. The sheriff intentionally discriminated against the plaintiffs in denying 
their applications for a concealed weapons permit "because they were in the 
business of private security." 
</P>
<P>
3. "In light of the discretion given the sheriff by California statute," Gates 
did not deny the plaintiffs' applications for concealed weapons permits "solely 
because he reasonably believed that the plaintiffs had not shown 'good cause' " 
for a permit. 
</P>
<P>
4. In denying the plaintiffs' applications to carry concealed weapons, the 
sheriff "acted with malice toward them or in reckless disregard of their 
constitutional rights." 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 14, the jury will be asked to determine how much, if anything, Gates 
should pay in punitive damages to the Ritters.

CLEANLINESS COURSE FOR RESTAURANTS OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city is about to become the county's first to require restaurant managers 
to attend a course on cleanliness. 
</P>
<P>
By a 4-0 vote, the City Council last week gave preliminary approval to an 
ordinance that will affect more than 200 restaurants citywide and make 
mandatory a four-hour training course to educate restaurant managers in safe 
and sanitary food-handling procedures. 
</P>
<P>
If the ordinance receives final approval at the Nov. 13 council meeting, 
restaurants with more than four employees will have eight months to comply. The 
city will notify in writing all restaurants that are affected by the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Each location will be required to have at least one manager on staff who has 
earned a certificate by passing the county course and a written exam. The 
course costs $20 and the certificate is valid for three years. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Don E. Smith said he first approached the county Health Care Agency with 
an idea for the pilot program two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of my position we eat out a lot and we came across times when I 
practically lost my appetite" because of unsanitary conditions, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The course will focus on health procedures like personal hygiene and keeping 
foods at the correct temperature, said Jim Huston, assistant director for 
environmental health at the Health Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
County officials will check certificates at each location during inspections 
that the health department conducts three times each year, Huston said. 
</P>
<P>
Violations are considered a misdemeanor and will be reported to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Huston said he hopes that the program will be duplicated by cities throughout 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The certification program is one way to assure the public that "when they go in 
(to a restaurant) they are eating safe hygienic foods handled by safe, hygienic 
people that know what they are doing," Huston said.MARY HELEN BERG

BUSINESSES OFFERED LOW-COST LOANS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Business owners who want to spruce up their properties can apply for low-cost 
loans through the city's economic development office. 
</P>
<P>
The Commercial Rehabilitation Program offers loans up to $20,000 per business 
or $150,000 per property owner for properties in redevelopment areas, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The loans carry an interest rate of 4% and do not have to be repaid for the 
first five years. 
</P>
<P>
The new commercial loan program is already succeeding, with a portion of the 
$178,000 allocated for the 4% loans to be spent on rehabilitating the exterior 
of a shopping center at the corner of Knott and Monroe avenues. 
</P>
<P>
The program is the city's most recent attempt to clean up redevelopment areas. 
For the past year, rebates have been offered to business owners willing to 
improve their property. However, no one has applied. 
</P>
<P>
"It is one of those things that you think is going to work but it doesn't," 
said Gus Duran, project manager. "A lot of the businesses didn't have the money 
to put up themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Under the rebate plan, commercial property owners pay for improvements and are 
reimbursed by the city to a maximum of $45,000. Despite its lack of success, 
the rebate program will continue, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Both financial assistance programs are funded by a federal grant. LYNDA NATALI

SKINHEADS TO RALLY FOR METZGER AT PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials on Tuesday confirmed that a group of skinheads supporting race 
separatist Tom Metzger are expected to meet Saturday in Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the group is not over 25 persons, we can't prohibit them from 
meeting in the park," Mayor Thomas J. Mays said. He said that about 20 to 25 
people are expected to show up. 
</P>
<P>
The rally, by self-avowed skinheads, is to show support for Metzger in the wake 
of hisloss of a civil court case in Portland, Ore. In that case, which was 
decided last week by a jury, Metzger and his organization, White Aryan 
Resistance, was ordered to pay $12.5 million in damages to the family of a 
black man killed by followers of that organization. 
</P>
<P>
The city first heard of the proposed rally from an anonymous caller who sought 
information about use of Central Park. The caller said skinheads wanted to have 
a rally for Metzger. 
</P>
<P>
Later, a permit request was filed, asking for use of the park with sound 
amplification equipment. The city denied the sound amplification request but 
could not legally deny park access to the group as long as it does not exceed 
25, Mays said. Groups larger than that require extra city services and thus 
require permits, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg said officers will be on hand at the park. 
</P>
<P>
"I have some concerns about that type of group coming to our park and what 
other type groups they may draw," Lowenberg said. "The potential for conflict 
is significant. And so we hope nobody shows up. But from a proactive point of 
view, we have to be prepared. We will be keeping our eye on the area." 
</P>
<P>
Mays said he hopes that people, including opponents of Metzger, will not come 
to the park Saturday to see the rally. He said that an influx of curiosity 
seekers or opponents of Metzger would only "add to their (the skinheads') crowd 
and thus add to the attention they want to get." 
</P>
<P>
Mays said that he deplores the race separation sentiments of Metzger's 
followers but conceded that they have the constitutional right to meet and 
speak. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MICKEY AND FRIENDS RAP DRUG USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mickey Mouse and Pluto visited two schools on Tuesday to introduce "Free From 
Drugs," a new program that uses rap music to discourage youngsters from using 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Free From Drugs" was created by the county's Drug Use Is Life Abuse 
organization and is now available to schools throughout Orange County. The 
program is aimed at children in kindergarten through third grade and can be 
taught before the organization's "Positively Know Drugs" program for youngsters 
in grades four through six. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all of us realize that a critical time period for kids is between 
kindergarten and sixth grade," Sheriff Brad Gates said. "We want to encourage 
the next generation not to get involved with drugs. That's where we win the 
war." 
</P>
<P>
Any police department in the county can have its officers trained to teach the 
program's curriculum, which is presented to students during four classroom 
visits, Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
Three new characters created by Disney especially for this program will deliver 
the "Free From Drugs" message. The characters, Skippy, Spike and Wise Owl Mike, 
are also the first Disney likenesses to be used for an outside venture. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that in the long run, it would be better to create characters that are 
identified specifically with this program," said Charles Boyer, the artist who 
created them. 
</P>
<P>
"We used the same Disney principles as we always have in creating these," he 
said. "They have the same cuteness and affability as our other characters. We 
hope that when children see these characters, they will think about saying no 
to drugs." 
</P>
<P>
The new characters, who visited Taft Elementary School and Taft Hearing 
Impaired School in Santa Ana, were a big hit with students. 
</P>
<P>
"They are cute," fifth-grader Jessica Hobbie said. "I like them just as much as 
Mickey Mouse." 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of the program is a 20-page booklet featuring the lyrics to the 
song "Drug-Free Rap," a drug dictionary, and various educational exercises. The 
booklet also lists ways parents can detect drug abuse in their children.

Since about 300 of the students at Tuesday's program were hearing-impaired, 
they had to learn the rap music through sign language. This presented a special 
challenge for interpreter Julie Kearns, an investigator with the Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
"They saw Mickey and Pluto dancing, and they seemed to really enjoy 
themselves," Kearns said. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers said Disney veterans like Mickey Mouse and Pluto won't be making any 
more public appearances in conjunction with the program once life-size costumes 
are created for Skippy, Spike and Wise Owl Mike.

Gates and others will be presenting the "Free From Drugs" program to the

"We would like to see this program used nationally," Gates said. GREG HERNANDEZ

'CAREER CRIMINAL' GIVEN STIFF SENTENCE FOR SPREE

A 34-year-old man, branded a "career criminal" by prosecutors after a spree of 
armed robberies, kidnapings and police shoot-outs in Orange County and Arizona, 
received a stiff sentence Tuesday that will probably keep him behind bars for 
the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Lee Mills, an ex-convict, drug addict and occasional construction 
worker, stood before Superior Court Judge Myron S. Brown and said he was sorry 
for his crimes. 
</P>
<P>
But Brown nonetheless handed Mills virtually the toughest sentence available -- 
a life term, plus 28 years, to run immediately after a 35-year-sentence already 
imposed against Mills in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
If Mills receives all the breaks allowed in the prison systems in California 
and Arizona, he could hope for the possibility of parole at age 77, lawyers 
said. But more likely, his own attorney acknowledged, he will spend the rest of 
his life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a classic sociopath," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Ronald Cafferty, who 
specializes in cases involving habitual or "career criminals." 
</P>
<P>
"He had certain goals -- to get money for his drugs -- and if you got in his 
way, he'd kill you, whether you were a civilian or a police officer or 
whatever. It's a cowboy mentality . . . a real Jesse James." 
</P>
<P>
Mills pleaded guilty in September in Orange County Superior Court to charges of 
armed robbery, kidnaping and the attempted murders of two police officers. 
</P>
<P>
A heroin addict since age 13 who served a robbery sentence in prison as a young 
adult, Mills had a favorite sawed-off shotgun that he called "baby," 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
During a crime spree that began in June, 1988, he used it to rob at least nine 
stores and businesses in the Santa Ana area, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities finally caught up with Mills on July 12, 1988 -- but only 
temporarily. When Mills and two other men were stopped by police in Santa Ana, 
Mills allegedly pulled his gun on an officer and fired three shots but missed. 
Fleeing the scene, Mills next allegedly stole a Southern California Edison 
truck at gunpoint and fired at another pursuing officer, missing again. 
</P>
<P>
After abandoning the truck in Santa Ana, police said Mills then kidnaped a 
woman from her nearby apartment and forced her to drive him to a local hotel, 
where he and his family had been holed up. After treating his wounds with 
cocaine, he then robbed another bank of $6,000 and finally fled the area 
altogether, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
But the rampage did not stop there, authorities said. Mills, who grew up in 
Arizona, and a partner robbed several more banks in Phoenix in the weeks after 
the Santa Ana crime spree. Again, Mills fired at and missed a police officer in 
pursuit, and again he took a woman hostage to try to escape. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, a neighbor of the hostage spotted the pair as they walked down 
the street and alerted police, who managed to capture Mills. He was later 
convicted on robbery and kidnaping charges. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County police and officials in the career-criminals unit of the district 
attorney's office connected Mills to the Santa Ana crimes and returned him to 
the area to face charges here. 
</P>
<P>
Court-appointed defense attorney William D. Gallagher had wanted Brown to 
impose sentence against Mills to run at the same time as his Arizona 
convictions, thus allowing him the possibility of parole in perhaps 21 years.

2 COUNTY OPERATIONS FACE BUDGET WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In the midst of an extraordinarily tight budget year, two county operations -- 
the probation and sheriff's departments -- continue to struggle with growing 
salary costs and threaten to put the county more than $5 million in the red, 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates by the county auditor-controller's office warn that the Sheriff's 
Department faces an overrun of $4.3 million and the Probation Department is 
running about $880,000 above its budget allocation. Those estimates likely 
overstate the problem somewhat, Auditor Steve Lewis said, but they are based on 
an extrapolation of spending by the departments so far this fiscal year, which 
began in July. 
</P>
<P>
Unless those departments can rein in their spending, it could jeopardize other 
county services or force officials to gut the $16-million emergency reserve 
budget, Ronald S. Rubino, the county's chief budget officer, said in an 
interview Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I've already warned them, and I've gotten assurances that they will try to 
keep it under control," said Rubino, who will present a midyear budget report 
to the board in late November. "This is going to be an important issue for the 
board when they get their first midyear budget review." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, while cautioning that the budget estimates are 
only preliminary, said they "underscore the value of this midyear look we're 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman Don R. Roth agreed and said his preliminary meetings on the 
county's midyear budget status already have him concerned. "Things are not 
good," he said. "What we could be headed for is some layoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Roth and Vasquez, along with other officials, have expressed grave reservations 
about trying to cope with the shortfalls by invading the county's emergency 
reserve. "Can you imagine if we have an earthquake or some other kind of 
catastrophe, and we needed the overtime money to deal with it?" Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
With money tight, officials said, it is all the more important that departments 
stay within their allocated budgets. Most are projected to do so, but the 
sheriff's and probation departments face the most serious problems, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although conceding that they face a shortfall, Sheriff's Department officials 
take issue with the auditor's projections, said Assistant Sheriff Walter Fath, 
adding that departmental estimates place the deficit at about $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
To address its shortfall, the department has imposed a hiring freeze, letting 
vacancies stay unfilled for at least 90 days after they open up, Fath said. 
Overtime expenses, which cost the department nearly $1 million a month, are 
also under close scrutiny, and officials hope to trim them by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
In the Probation Department, higher-than-predicted numbers of inmates at 
Juvenile Hall have contributed to the department's unexpected expenses. The 
county is funded for 314 beds at the facility, said Chief Probation Officer 
Michael Schumacher. Since July 1, "we've had upwards of 390 to 400," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Schumacher estimates that probation needs to make up about $900,000 to balance 
its budget this year. To do that, officials are meeting with county judges in 
an effort to develop plans for holding down the Juvenile Hall population and 
are holding some positions vacant to save on salaries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The emerging budget problems come at a precarious time for the county. Faced 
with deep cuts handed down by the state, departmental budgets have already been 
trimmed, and some board members are showing signs of balking at plans to impose 
a jail booking fee on cities and school districts, a move that would cost the 
county $2.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
And even though the supervisors are confronted with a perilously small 
emergency reserve, many county functions are going underfunded, creating 
pressure for the board to dip into what few available funds it has. Tuesday, 
for instance, supervisors approved an appropriation of $940,000 to mental 
health programs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is clear evidence, I think, of the commitment that we have to these 
programs," Vasquez said.

KEZY'S NATIONALITY CONTEST CALLED RACIST

A radio contest in which listeners guess the nationality of convenience store 
clerks is drawing fire from immigrant activists who say the game is racist. 
</P>
<P>
Called "Foreign or Domestic," the contest by KEZY-FM (95.9) has morning host 
Chris Little telephone clerks, and listeners guess whether they were born in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
After a chat with the salesclerk, Little asks the clerk's nationality and 
contestants find out if they predicted correctly. 
</P>
<P>
Little said the game didn't work one time because the clerk spoke little 
English. He said that 40% are American-born and that he teases them too. 
"People have always made fun of 7-Elevens," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Don Simmons, a board member of Cambodian Family, a Santa Ana refugee support 
organization, said: "It's a tacit form of racism disguised as humor." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ann Gaido, a human relations specialist at the Orange County Human 
Relations Commission, said no complaints had been received but said the contest 
"sounds extremely divisive." 
</P>
<P>
The game has been on the air since mid-September and runs about four times a 
week. So far, there have been about 30 to 40 winners of prizes such as concert 
and television show tickets, Little said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's supposed to be a benign little game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Station manager Peri Corso said the game may be dropped as part of a 
fine-tuning of the station's format. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what you seem to do nowadays, it offends someone," she said.

<P>
As the neck-and-neck race for Orange County district attorney entered its final 
week, longtime adversaries Michael R. Capizzi and James G. Enright voiced 
familiar campaign themes in public Tuesday but added a new twist behind the 
scenes. 
</P>
<P>
They started the day shortly after sunrise with a spirited, face-to-face 
discussion before more than two dozen Mission Viejo Kiwanis Club members at the 
Laguna Hills Holiday Inn. 
</P>
<P>
It will be more of the same for the candidates in the days to come, with each 
tackling a busy schedule of speaking engagements and other political events as 
they grapple for the upper hand in a race that has so far attracted little 
interest from the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
During their 45-minute debate in Laguna Hills, Capizzi and Enright stuck mainly 
to the major themes of the campaign, each taking only occasional swipes at the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
Enright, chief deputy district attorney in Orange County for the last 24 years, 
pledged to prosecute environmental crimes aggressively and to tackle gangs and 
drug dealers. But he stressed that the best remedy for such ills is "education 
that begins in grammar school." 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi, who was appointed district attorney by the Board of Supervisors in 
January, agreed that education programs are important but suggested that 
prosecutors have to "recognize our role" and stick "in the courts, not in the 
classrooms." 
</P>
<P>
When Capizzi noted that he had received support from 86% of the office's 
prosecutors, Enright countered that just 55% of the deputy district attorneys 
voted, because of fears that the ballots were not being kept secret. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not an election," Enright said, comparing it to "something you'd see in 
the Philippines" during the days of deposed President Ferdinand Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi did not counterattack during the morning gathering but later in the day 
issued a press release accusing Enright of conspiring with Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Thomas Avdeef, an unsuccessful district attorney candidate in the June primary, 
in a "brazen attempt" to blackmail him. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi scuttled Avdeef's chances for a promotion on May 2, about a month 
before the primary. Avdeef sought to have the decision reversed, but the 
county's Personnel Department rejected the appeal on May 30. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 24, an attorney for Avdeef -- who has endorsed Enright and is working 
with his campaign -- sent a letter to Capizzi, saying his client had been 
wrongly passed over because of politics. The letter demanded that Avdeef be 
promoted. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi said that "circumstantial evidence" ties Enright to Avdeef's effort to 
gain promotion just days before the Nov. 6 election. He noted Avdeef's 
political ties to Enright in the current campaign. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two shared the same attorney when they tried unsuccessfully 
earlier this year to block the appointment of Capizzi as district attorney, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an effort by them to put me in an untenable position," Capizzi said 
Tuesday afternoon. "If I ignored it, they would go ahead and file a lawsuit and 
say I tried to sweep it all under the rug. I hope they know me well enough to 
know I would never consent to giving in." 
</P>
<P>
Enright said those allegations against him are "absolutely absurd." 
</P>
<P>
He denied talking to Avdeef about sending the letter. "It's amazing that 
(Capizzi) is the one who went forward and talked to the press about this 
thing," Enright said. "It must mean he's a little desperate. I don't have the 
slightest idea what he's going to gain from it." 
</P>
<P>
A recent Los Angeles Times Poll indicates that nearly half the voters remained 
undecided about which man to support. The poll showed Enright leading Capizzi, 
29% to 23%, with 48% undecided. 
</P>
<P>
But Capizzi holds a solid lead in raising campaign funds, with a war chest of 
more than $222,000 as of Sept. 30, compared to about $80,000 for Enright. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no stone left unturned," Capizzi said of his strategy, which 
will include campaign mailers, telephone calls to voters and other tactics 
during the final days. "I'm approaching this as I always approached the trial 
of a criminal matter -- with thoroughness." 
</P>
<P>
Enright, meanwhile, planned to keep up his end with advertisements in 
newspapers and mailers to select county areas with a large voter turnout. 
</P>
<P>
"It will all be positive-type stuff, nothing negative," he promised.

MULLIGAN GETS IN SHAPE FOR UPCOMING SEASON WITH FEW JABS

<P>
UC Irvine's weekly basketball luncheons, a.k.a. The Bill Mulligan Comedy Hour, 
began Monday in lively fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan stepped to a podium and began firing away. No one was safe. 
</P>
<P>
He ripped the school's student body for its nonsupport -- again. 
</P>
<P>
He trashed walk-ons for being lousy. 
</P>
<P>
And he zinged Utah Coach Rick Majerus, a good friend, for being too fat. 
</P>
<P>
Among Mulligan's best lines: 
</P>
<P>
"I had a bad day. I spent the morning yelling at my assistants." 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, you get a couple of 5-foot-10 guys who want to try out. We only had 
three walk-ons, and Tim Burt is better than two of them." 
</P>
<P>
Burt is the columnist at the Irvine World News. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff Von Lutzow (sophomore forward) has NBA capabilities and forgets he does." 
</P>
<P>
"Majerus was in town a while back. He had heart surgery last season, and the 
doctor told him to watch it. He's 39. So he says, 'Let's go have a snack.' I 
said I'd pay. He had $31 in snacks." 
</P>
<P>
But Mulligan had a few serious moments, too. A 5-23 season, the worst in 
Irvine's 25-year history, will do that. 
</P>
<P>
He raved about center Ricky Butler's condition. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been magnificent," Mulligan said of Butler, a 6-7 senior center who led 
the Anteaters in scoring last season with a 13.8 average. "It's the best I've 
ever seen him play, except maybe when he was in high school. He's lost 20 to 25 
pounds." 
</P>
<P>
But Butler suffered a bruised left knee when reserve center Rick Swanwick fell 
on him during a practice drill Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Dylan Rigdon, a sophomore guard, is practicing with a broken finger on his left 
hand. It does not bother his shooting, Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need any injuries," he said. "It's going to be tough enough." 
</P>
<P>
The public will get its first view of the 1990-91 Anteaters when they play High 
Five America, a team of former college standouts, in an exhibition at 7:30 
Saturday night in the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
X-rays of Butler's knee Tuesday showed no serious damage. He is expected to 
begin practicing with the team today and probably will start at center against 
High Five America. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Carlos Prietto, Irvine's team physician, called Butler's injury a simple 
bone bruise. 
</P>
<P>
Add basketball: Elzie Love, a 6-6 swingman from Perris High School, made an 
oral commitment to Irvine Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Love was the Ivy League MVP and an All-Southern Section 5-AA selection. He 
averaged 19 points and 10 rebounds last season. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of those guys who does everything well," Perris Coach Phil Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
Final add basketball: High Five America's tentative starting lineup includes 
Troy Lewis, an All-Big Ten guard from Purdue, and Chris Jackson, a former guard 
from Mater Dei High and UC Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
"They're loaded right down the line," Mulligan said. "We're not nearly as good 
on paper. I'm hoping we're in better shape than they are." 
</P>
<P>
The women's cross-country team won the Big West meet last weekend but fell in 
the NCAA coaches' poll. The Anteaters, fourth last week, are at No. 5. 
Villanova is No. 1, followed by Brigham Young, Indiana and Providence. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's Vince O'Boyle was named Big West Coach of the Year for both the 
women's and men's teams. Buffy Rabbitt, who won the women's race by running the 
5,000-meter course at Woodward Park in Fresno in 17 minutes 5.2 seconds, was 
named the conference women's runner of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The men's and women's teams will compete in the NCAA District 8 meet Nov. 10 at 
Woodward Park. The top two teams advance to the NCAA championships Nov. 19 at 
Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
The wait ended Saturday for Irvine water polo Coach Ted Newland, who got his 
500th career victory when the Anteaters defeated Air Force, 12-10 in overtime, 
in the Cal State Long Beach 49er tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine, which finished seventh in the 49er tournament and is 11-12, 1-4 in the 
Big West, plays the University of the Pacific at 7:30 Thursday night at 
Heritage Park in Irvine. Pacific ended a streak of 30 consecutive losses to 
Irvine this season. 
</P>
<P>
Newland's career mark is 501-179-5. 
</P>

<P>
A key figure in the failure of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan pleaded guilty 
Tuesday to bank fraud and agreed to cooperate with the continuing federal 
investigation of the thrift's collapse 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Ernest C. Garcia II, a 33-year-old Tucson developer, admitted that he 
fraudulently obtained a $30-million line of credit in a series of transactions 
that also helped Lincoln hide its ownership in risky desert Arizona land from 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia is the first person charged with a crime in the federal probe of 
Lincoln's collapse. A federal grand jury in Los Angeles has been investigating 
Lincoln's failure for more than a year. Charles H. Keating Jr., a Phoenix 
developer whose company owned Lincoln, is the central target of the probe. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia entered the plea Tuesday before U.S. District Judge James M. Ideman 
after federal prosecutors filed an information -- essentially an indictment 
agreed to without going through a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, free on a $5,000 personal bond, is scheduled to be sentenced April 19. 
The bank fraud charge carries a maximum of five years in prison, a $250,000 
fine and restitution. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Garcia said he entered the plea "with tremendous 
feelings of remorse." 
</P>
<P>
"After careful consideration of all the facts, numerous consultations with 
legal counsel, and, most importantly, consideration of my family, I felt it was 
best to try and put the circumstances and mistakes of the last three years 
behind us," he said. "Given the benefit of hindsight, I would have done some 
things differently." 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors said the plea agreement requires Garcia to cooperate in the 
continuing Lincoln probe, but they declined to detail what would be required of 
him. Lincoln's failure is expected to cost taxpayers $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia's testimony could be damaging to Keating, former American Continental 
chairman. Keating is awaiting trial in state court on 42 counts of securities 
fraud relating to the sale of American Continental bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Keating nor his lawyer could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Early this month, lawyers for Keating identified the deal with Garcia as one of 
three activities they said the federal grand jury was concentrating on. 
</P>
<P>
The bank-fraud charge alleges that Garcia was a "straw borrower" used by 
executives at Lincoln and its parent firm, American Continental Corp. in 
Phoenix, to hide the true ownership of 1,000 acres of desert land outside 
Phoenix, according to federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
"This type of white-collar scheme -- using 'straw borrowers' -- is of 
particular concern because it is designed to conceal the true nature of the 
financial transactions involved," said U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh in a 
prepared statement from Washington. "In the process, federal regulators are 
deceived, the institution is defrauded and the taxpayers are left to foot the 
bill." 
</P>
<P>
The convoluted arrangement involving Garcia and a partnership called 
Westcontinental Mortgage &amp; Investment Corp. was the first of 10 
transactions regarding property in a planned development called Hidden Valley 
Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia is accused of obtaining a $30-million line of credit from Lincoln by 
"creating the materially false and misleading impression" that the borrowing 
was not related to the simultaneous purchase of the desert acreage. 
</P>
<P>
The Hidden Valley property was bought in 1987 by Westcon, a partnership with 
few assets created and run by a friend of Garcia to accommodate the 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
The information charges that, instead of being an arms-length transaction, the 
sale of the desert land for $14 million actually was an illegal "quid pro quo" 
for Garcia's line of credit. Westcon put $3.5 million down -- money regulators 
claim came from Lincoln through Garcia -- and borrowed the remaining amount 
from a Lincoln subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators, who had been pressing Lincoln to rid itself of risky holdings in 
undeveloped Arizona desert land, doubted both the values Keating put on the 
land and the arrangements he used to sell some of it. 
</P>
<P>
Westcon never repaid the $10.5-million loan it received from Lincoln for the 
balance of the purchase price. In a letter, the company asked that the property 
be returned to its rightful owner, suggesting that the partnership was a straw 
borrower. 
</P>
<P>
In civil lawsuits, regulators allege that Lincoln claimed "phantom profits" of 
$82 million from the 10 deals -- including $11 million on the Westcon deal -- 
and improperly paid American Continental $31 million for income tax on the 
deals. Lincoln, however, didn't owe any taxes, regulators said.

ODETICS TO MAKE ROBOTS FOR DATA SYSTEM

<P>
Odetics Inc. said Tuesday that it has won a $34-million contract to build a 
robot-controlled tape "library" for a huge supercomputer data storage system 
being developed by E-Systems Inc., a Dallas electronics company. 
</P>
<P>
Under a six-year contract, Odetics will make a robot system that will store and 
retrieve data within a giant storage system capable of holding the equivalent 
of a copy of Margaret Mitchell's "Gone With the Wind" for every person in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
The contract is a continuation of earlier work that Odetics did for E-Systems 
under a $6-million award. 
</P>
<P>
The most sophisticated version of E-Systems' storage system will store more 
than 10,000 terabytes of information. One terabyte equals 1 trillion bytes of 
data. 
</P>
<P>
E-Systems plans to market the system to government agencies and companies that 
operate large information databases. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas firm expects to market a small version of the system in 1991 and a 
more sophisticated one by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The system would have 1,000 times more storage capacity than current systems 
made by Storage Technology Corp., of Louisville, Colo., said Richard Petit, 
general manager of Odetics' commercial products division. 
</P>
<P>
Odetics Chairman Joel Slutzky said the company estimates the market for 
supercomputer storage systems will reach $3 billion by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Odetics' share of that overall market could be $100 million a year beginning in 
1991, Petit said. Odetics now employs 27 people on the project and expects to 
hire 10 more during the next year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The E-Systems project is based on technology used in the automated videotape 
storage systems that Odetics supplies to television stations. 
</P>
<P>
But while the machines that Odetics makes for the broadcast industry can store 
and retrieve 280 videotapes, the new system would access thousands of computer 
cassettes in a storage area the length of an 80-foot hallway. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the Odetics supercomputer system is a network of self-propelled or 
robotic arms that transfer cassettes from place to place at speeds up to 9 feet 
per second. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Klatman, spokesman for Storage Technology, said his company is looking 
into the technology. 
</P>
<P>
But the Dallas firm's system, he said, would appeal more to a small "fringe of 
scientific users who require massive amounts of data" rather than the average 
corporate customer. 
</P>
<P>
But Odetics' Petit said E-Systems already has lined up some government and 
commercial customers, including one large oil company. 
</P>
<P>
Other potential customers might include banks, insurance companies and major 
scientific and research institutions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Robots Serve Up Data For Supercomputers 
</P>
<P>
A team of self-propelled robots made by Odetics Inc. of Anaheim keep order in a 
library of up to135,000 computer-storage tape cassettes. Bar code scanners 
identify cassettes, which are then pl19694498291. Odetics' mobile robot 
retrieves tape cartridge from library rack and delivers it to cassette module. 
</P>
<P>

Hands-On Help: More people in Orange County try to start new ventures than 
entrepreneurs anywhere else, says Tiffany A. Haugen at UC Irvine's Graduate 
School of Management. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason is that venture capital firms and other professionals have 
flocked to the county and helped to build a foundation that finances and 
supports entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
But UCI has found that more is needed, and Haugen has come up with a program 
called Accelerate. The educational program provides hands-on help to new 
business executives who are trying to develop plans, finance their operations 
and expand from a start-up shop to companies with $50 million in sales.

<P>
The Berlin Wall has fallen. Glasnost reigns. Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
is a Nobel Peace Prize hero. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, many Americans regard the Cold War, as we have known it for more than 
four decades, as over. And with its demise, that ultimate nightmare -- a 
nuclear wipeout from a Soviet-U.S. showdown -- seems no longer a reality. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, argue disarmament activists such as Dr. Robert Wesley of Irvine. The 
nightmare, he says, has merely changed its shape, become subtler and more 
complex, more insidious. 
</P>
<P>
"This (end of nuclear threat) may be the perception but not the reality. You 
may have some treaties signed, (President) Bush and Gorbachev shaking hands and 
smiling, but the fact remains that the nuclear weaponry being retired is 
minuscule, while new and deadlier weapons are still being developed," said 
Wesley, a member of the Orange County chapter of Physicians for Social 
Responsibility (PSR), long a prominent organization in the anti-nuclear 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
And, added the 41-year-old cardiologist who is a member of the national PSR's 
house of delegates, "even if the threat of a Soviet-U.S. war now appears 
unlikely, you have the Iraqi-Gulf crisis as proof that conventional wars could 
escalate into nuclear confrontations." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Wesley and other PSR officials concede that this aura of nuclear 
peace has lulled many to drop out of the activist ranks of the anti-nuclear 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based Physicians for Social Responsibility, which is composed 
mostly of physicians but includes others in the health professions, is itself a 
dramatic example of membership drain. 
</P>
<P>
PSR membership nationally dropped from 55,000 in the mid-1980s -- when PSR and 
its parent body, International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, 
were at the height of their recognition -- to 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, in Los Angeles County, whose chapter is still one of PSR's 
largest, the decline was from 2,400 to 2,000. The Orange County chapter 
declined from 250 to 180 members. 
</P>
<P>
So Physicians for Social Responsibility, whose 125 chapters range in size from 
a handful of members in all of North Dakota to thousand-plus groups in the New 
York City, Boston, San Francisco and Seattle areas, is out to revive its 
membership rolls and broaden its appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, the Los Angeles chapter joined UCLA Extension and the Beyond War 
Foundation in sponsoring an environmental symposium, "Healing the Planet," at 
the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 8, at UC Irvine's University Club, the Orange County chapter will hold 
its first-ever awards banquet -- the recipient will be a longtime global peace 
advocate, media/sports mogul Ted Turner -- to woo new members, raise money and 
spread the word of its existence. 
</P>
<P>
And next spring, the Orange County chapter will co-sponsor a UCI conference on 
the environment, an issue that many PSR chapters have adopted as one on par 
with the dangers of nuclear weapons and the military syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
"We are no less concerned with nuclearism. But we are equally concerned with 
all forms of global destruction, including the slower devastation of our 
environment," said Dr. Arthur Strauss of Irvine, another longtime PSR member. 
</P>
<P>
More than ever, added the 38-year-old pediatrician, "the health, the very 
survival of society and this planet, are endangered. This is no time for 
organizations like ours to go out of business." 
</P>
<P>
The PSR has always had its ups and downs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, two years after the national organization was founded, it was among 
the peace groups that basked in a singular triumph -- the U.S.-Soviet signing 
of the Limited Test Ban Treaty that halted atmospheric testing. 
</P>
<P>
But after that milestone, PSR membership dropped until the late 1970s, when 
PSR, galvanized by a mercurial new leader, Helen Caldicott, regrouped and 
mounted new campaigns to stop the arms race, ban all nuclear testing and seek 
massive cuts in military spending. 
</P>
<P>
"People were scared again (in the early 1980s). We had the Three-Mile Island 
(nuclear power plant) accident. And our leaders were following an incredible 
premise: that a nuclear war was survivable," recalled Orange County chapter 
member Dr. Fred Galluccio, 38, a Newport Beach-based family-practice physician. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, that was tragic nonsense," he added. "No one would survive such a 
holocaust today." 
</P>
<P>
The success of PSR was instrumental in the forming of similar anti-nuclear 
"social responsibility" groups in other professional fields, such as those for 
educators and for architects. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1980, PSR became the U.S. affiliate of International Physicians for the 
Prevention of Nuclear War, the global group founded by American and Soviet 
physicians, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
To some PSR members, the successes of the 1980s did much to dispel any notions 
that the medical profession -- usually viewed as a highly conservative lot -- 
cannot also be deeply committed to social advocacy. 
</P>
<P>
It is a view that stems from images of doctors as more concerned with 
protecting their professional turf or financial status than taking activist 
roles in areas of social problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We know some citizens feel this way about doctors, but that's a bad rap," said 
Wesley, who maintains that PSR activities have more than countered that 
unflattering public perception. 
</P>
<P>
"(PSR) shows that doctors are concerned with ethical and moral issues. We have 
the same sense of social idealism," said Wesley, who took part in the civil 
rights and anti-Vietnam War movements of the 1960s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
"From a medical point of view, the destruction of our society is, after all, 
the ultimate epidemic," added Wesley, who is with the Veterans Affairs Medical 
Center in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Once, when the Orange County chapter ran an ad in an Irvine weekly newspaper 
publicizing its anti-nuclear and global peace stances and providing a clip-out 
coupon for requesting information, it did receive a few nasty remarks scribbled 
on some mailed coupons. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, like 'Go back to Russia' and that sort of thing," recalled Strauss, 
who is on the staff of Memorial Miller Children's Hospital in Long Beach. "But 
it was overall an ideological reaction, we believe, not specifically against 
doctors." 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Strauss added, the local PSR these days seems a rather obscure 
organization. "We're listed in the white pages for people seeking information. 
But most people who call us think we're some kind of physician-referral 
service." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, PSR members contend that their activist involvement has not brought 
them any significantly adverse reactions from patients. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if my patients know about my (social-issue) beliefs, it doesn't seem to 
present any problems. I mean, I'm pretty open about it and I haven't lost 
anyone that I know of," said Galluccio, who has a private practice based in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But then, officially, PSR activism does not include protest marches and sit-ins 
or other high-profile staples associated with the more militant. 
</P>
<P>
"Some members have done that on an individual basis, not as a chapter," 
explained Strauss, who was among those arrested for trespassing -- the charges 
were later dismissed -- during a 1986 protest at the Nevada test site near Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Official PSR demonstrations are aimed at being more scholarly, like the recent 
PSR gathering outside the White House. The group, which included Wesley, met to 
present a petition to President Bush urging avoidance of nuclear or chemical 
weapons in the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The mission of PSR, members say, is principally educational -- such as 
seminars, research reports, legislative testimony, international exchanges -- 
that rely on the expertise of PSR members. 
</P>
<P>
And the organization is expanding its programming into areas beyond nuclearism. 
</P>
<P>
Last year at UCI, the chapter co-sponsored a conference for high school 
students on the economic impacts in a post-Cold War world. The topic of next 
spring's campus conference, again for high school students, will be 
"Environmental Revitalization: An Issue in National and Global Security." 
</P>
<P>
As many PSR members see it, these other social concerns, which include such 
issues as health care, substance abuse, homelessness and the educational 
system, are more connected to the PSR's original concerns with nuclearism and 
defense spending than most realize. 
</P>
<P>
It is a matter of money. 
</P>
<P>
"On one hand, we still spend incredibly enormous sums on the whole 
military-defense system, even on something as doubtful as the B-2 Stealth 
(bomber), while these urgent social programs go begging for fiscal support," 
Strauss said. "It is so monumentally ludricrous." 
</P>
<P>
But PSR members say they are not about to abandon the cause that first brought 
them together. 
</P>
<P>
It is not just the unfinished business of seeking full bans on nuclear testing 
and dismantling of nuclear arsenals, but also protection from contamination and 
accidents from existing nuclear facilities. 
</P>
<P>
And it is also, they say, being the voice of reality during yet another lapse 
in the public perception of the nuclear threat. 
</P>
<P>
"People are once again going through a time of denial (about the threat)," said 
Galluccio, who took part in a PSR exchange trip in 1985 to several countries, 
including the Soviet Union and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
That fall, his PSR delegation visited Hiroshima, saw the memorial and museum 
there and met with survivors of the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't forget what you see, hear and feel. Even now, even with the city 
rebuilt, it is an absolutely horrendous and depressing experience to be there," 
Galluccio declared. 
</P>
<P>
And to those who believe that the nuclear threat has passed into history, with 
the end of the Cold War, Galluccio offered this: 
</P>
<P>
"Compared with the nuclear weapons we possess today, the bomb that was dropped 
on Hiroshima, 45 years ago, was only a matchstick."

THE RAND MCNALLY STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Travelers looking for "best bets" books, street maps and other guides to their 
destinations now have a place in Orange County to stop before they go. 
</P>
<P>
"We carry the world," said Guita Mahmoudi, assistant manager of the new Rand 
McNally store in South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
The atlas publisher's new outlet is one of just nine in the country and the 
first in a mall. Its other stores are located in the financial districts of San 
Francisco, New York, Chicago (which has two stores), Philadelphia, Cleveland, 
Washington and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mahmoudi, Rand McNally chose South Coast Plaza specifically 
"because it was a good mall to be in." 
</P>
<P>
The guidebooks and atlases that have made Rand McNally a household name are 
available, of course, as well as books listing hotel and restaurant 
recommendations and describing the history of numerous regions. 
</P>
<P>
"We have about 20 books on each country . . . and 2,500-plus maps," Mahmoudi 
said. "We have 60 different maps of California cities alone." 
</P>
<P>
Regional topographical maps are also available, some of which focus on 
communities such as Laguna Hills or Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
"We have access to almost everything," Mahmoudi said. "If we don't carry it, we 
will almost certainly be able to find it for you." 
</P>
<P>
Another section of the store includes educational toys for children. 
</P>
<P>
"The world is becoming so small, and we hear over and over again about how 
geography just isn't being taught in school," she said. "People who want their 
children to learn these things must teach them at home."

STATEWIDE BAN TO BE SOUGHT ON WOOD SHINGLE ROOFING; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY: ASSEMBLYMAN ROOS VOWS TO SEEK ACTION ON THE FLAMMABLE MATERIAL. FIRE 
OFFICIALS BLAME IT FOR MUCH OF THIS YEAR'S DESTRUCTION.

<P>
A key California lawmaker vowed Tuesday to seek a statewide ban on flammable 
wood roofs after hearing fire officials testify in Glendale about the 
devastating losses that occurred this year during the state's worst brush fire 
season. 
</P>
<P>
So far during 1990, brush fires have destroyed a record 864 structures, 
including more than 600 in Santa Barbara, Hal Walt, director of the California 
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, told the Joint Assembly/Senate 
Committee on Fire, Police, Emergency and Disaster Services. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials blame much of the destruction on wood shingle roofs. 
</P>
<P>
"In my 29-year career, shake shingle roofs, without a doubt, have contributed 
more than any other cause" to the rapid spread of fire, said Riverside County 
Fire Chief Glen Newman. 
</P>
<P>
"I appreciate the consistency of comment," said Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Mike 
Roos (D-Los Angeles), the committee's acting chairman. "There seems to be no 
wavering. There will be an attempt by one of us on this committee to do 
something about that next year." 
</P>
<P>
Two state senators who serve on the committee and were present at the meeting 
-- Alfred Alquist (D-San Jose) and Robert Presley (D-Riverside) -- expressed no 
opinion about the effort to ban wood roofs. 
</P>
<P>
Roos organized the hearing to determine how state lawmakers could help 
firefighters in the wake of the disastrous fire season. In Southern California 
alone, he said, brush fires caused three deaths, injured 53 people and 
blackened more than 22,000 acres this year. "The final tally of property damage 
may be over $300 million," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held in Glendale, where 64 houses were damaged or destroyed 
June 27 in a fast-moving brush fire. About half of the houses had wood shingle 
roofs, Glendale fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The wood roof industry has lobbied against banning the material, claiming it 
has been unjustly targeted by politicians and firefighters. They have also 
claimed wood roofs can be treated effectively with fire-retardant chemicals. No 
representatives from the industry attended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Some cities, including Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, Glendale and now Santa 
Barbara, prohibit shake roofs on new homes or as replacement roofs. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale Fire Chief John Montenero recently called for a law that would force 
homeowners to replace existing wood roofs. But a majority of City Council 
members said they would not impose such a large expense on residents. At 
Tuesday's hearing, Montenero urged state legislators to develop a low-interest 
loan program to help homeowners pay for wood roof replacement. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Barbara and Glendale fires were ignited by arsonists who remain at 
large, authorities said. State Fire Marshal James McMullen called for expanded 
statewide arson investigation and prevention programs, funded by a surcharge on 
insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, however, Roos said the surcharge idea "kind of leaves me 
cold" because high insurance costs have triggered widespread complaints among 
Californians. 
</P>
<P>
Roos said he did plan to follow up on a suggestion by fire officials that the 
National Guard be activated more quickly to assist when a catastrophic fire 
occurs. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the hearing, Rob Sharkey, president of the Glenmore Canyon 
Homeowners Assn., urged the committee to investigate the actions of the 
Glendale Fire Department in handling the June 27 blaze. In a report released 
last week, the department said it left Glenmore Canyon, in which more than a 
dozen houses were destroyed, unprotected for more than two hours while halting 
the fire's spread on another front. 
</P>
<P>
But the legislators said such a probe was outside their jurisdiction and urged 
the association to present their concerns to Glendale city officials.

GOVERNOR ASKED TO ACT ON SCHABARUM'S STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich has asked Gov. George Deukmejian 
to determine if retiring Supervisor Pete Schabarum has violated requirements 
that he live in the district he serves, and if so, to appoint Sarah Flores to 
his seat. 
</P>
<P>
A Deukmejian spokesman said the governor's office will review a county 
counsel's opinion that the governor can remove Schabarum if he determines the 
supervisor no longer resides in his district. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum refused on Tuesday to answer any questions about his residency, 
saying he does not want to divert attention from the term limit initiative he 
is backing on Tuesday's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the week for that," Schabarum said. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum recently moved out of his San Gabriel Valley district and now divides 
most of his time between a condominium in downtown Los Angeles and a house in 
the desert community of Indian Wells. 
</P>
<P>
Although the condominium is within the boundaries of the new 1st District as 
recently redrawn by federal Judge David Kenyon, Schabarum's residency is still 
in question because the redistricting issue is now before a higher court. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon ruled in a Voting Rights Act lawsuit earlier this year that the county 
discriminated against Latinos in 1981 in drawing up the current supervisorial 
districts. That ruling, along with the redrawn 1st District, was put on hold by 
the county's appeal. An appellate court decision is expected any day. 
</P>
<P>
The 61-year-old supervisor was planning to retire when his term expires Dec. 3 
but his stay on the board was extended indefinitely pending the appeals court 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich and Supervisor Deane Dana, who no longer get along with fellow 
Republican Schabarum, have been pushing for Flores' appointment or election in 
hopes of upsetting the voting rights lawsuit and preserving conservative 
control of the board. 
</P>
<P>
If appointed, Flores -- a Latina Republican and former deputy to Schabarum -- 
would enjoy the advantages of incumbency in an election and could ultimately 
disprove claims that the supervisors denied Latinos representation on the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
Flores was to face Superior Court Judge Gregory O'Brien in the November 
election, but the that race, also was indefinitely postponed pending a final 
ruling on the court case. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich, a former state GOP chairman, said Tuesday that he spoke privately 
with Deukmejian at a recent gubernatorial fund-raiser about appointing Flores 
to Schabarum's seat. "He was looking forward to receiving the opinion," said 
Antonovich of the county counsel's ruling that spelled out Deukmejian's 
authority in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"We have received the opinion, but as to what we will do and when, it is up in 
the air," said Deukmejian spokesman Bob Gore. 
</P>
<P>
Sal Russo, Deukmejian's former deputy chief of staff and now a political 
consultant in Sacramento, said he believes the governor will leave the matter 
to the federal judge presiding over the redistricting case. 
</P>
<P>
"His tendency would be, this is in the hands of a federal judge and to leave it 
there until the legal issues are resolved rather than acting precipitously," 
Russo said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Fajardo, an attorney for the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund, a plaintiff in the redistricting lawsuit, said, "As a 
practical matter, I don't see anything happening" to remove Schabarum. 
</P>
<P>
He said that any effort to force Schabarum out probably would end up in court 
and not be decided until after the redistricting ruling. 
</P>
<P>
However, Fajardo said, "We are prepared to take whatever legal action is 
necessary to preserve an open seat election in the 1st District. . . . One of 
the goals of the district court is to keep an open seat so everybody would have 
an equal chance of running for that office." 
</P>
<P>
In his legal opinion, County Counsel DeWitt Clinton did not offer a statement 
on whether Schabarum has violated residency requirements. 
</P>
<P>
A Schabarum spokesman recently said the supervisor is registered to vote at his 
son's house in the existing 1st District. 
</P>
<P>
"The courts have held that when the incumbent of a local office ceases to be a 
resident of the district for which he was elected . . . the office becomes 
vacant automatically," Clinton said in his opinion. He added that a supervisor 
cannot re-establish residency by moving back into the district. 
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton said, "the supervisor may continue to sit as a de facto member 
of the board until he resigns, is removed or is replaced, and prior to any such 
action his votes and any resulting actions taken by the board are valid."

ACTIVIST TO LEAD HOUSING DEPT.;

<P>
CITY HALL: THE MAYOR NAMES GARY SQUIER, A LONGTIME ADVOCATE OF MORE LOW-INCOME 
HOUSING, TO RUN THE NEW AGENCY. OBSERVERS SAY BRADLEY IS SHAKING UP THE 
BUREAUCRACY IN RESPONSE TO A DEEPENING CRISIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley on Tuesday named Gary Squier, a longtime advocate for the 
poor and for reform of the city's affordable-housing programs, to run the 
city's new 244-person Housing Preservation and Production Department. 
</P>
<P>
Squier, 39, who began his career in the mid-1970s as a VISTA volunteer on Skid 
Row, has been a private housing consultant and developer as well as acting 
director of the city Housing Authority. He was previously city housing 
coordinator under Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, at a press conference in front of an uninhabitable brick building that 
once housed 100 families, gave a plug to the city housing bond measure, 
Proposition K, and a state housing bond measure, Proposition 145, before 
calling Squier "an ideal choice." 
</P>
<P>
Squier has been praised by many developers, bankers, advocates for the poor and 
neighborhood revitalization groups as an expert strategist who can bring 
together disparate sectors of the city to attack the housing crisis. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, his appointment is of interest for the activist political 
message Bradley is sending, said several City Hall observers. 
</P>
<P>
"That's fantastic!" cried UCLA Associate Prof. Alan Heskin when told of the 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
"A political appointment was a great early fear of many people, and there's no 
question that instead what we are getting is a tremendously qualified, 
exceptional person," said Heskin, who is head of the urban planning program at 
UCLA and a member of the interviewing team that scored Squier highest among six 
finalists. 
</P>
<P>
Squier said his department will control a $50-million annual budget to build 
and rehabilitate low-income housing. The housing department also will review 
the housing efforts of all other city departments, including the Community 
Redevelopment Agency. That agency's budget has become the target of 
intensifying criticism from City Council members who complain that it is so 
complex they cannot tell what they are paying for. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be acting in an advise-and-consent role to that agency," Squier said. 
"Both of us are looking at better ways to get things done." 
</P>
<P>
Squier will join a fellow activist, Charles Elsesser, a former Legal Aid 
Foundation attorney who was named this month as chairman of the city's newly 
formed Housing Commission, a citizens panel that oversees the housing 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Elsesser, who is also an aide to state Sen. President Pro Tem David A. Roberti 
(D-Los Angeles), battled the city in the late 1980s as a Legal Aid lawyer, 
arguing that longtime city policies had diminished low-cost housing in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Squier and Elsesser met 15 years ago while working on behalf of the poor on 
Skid Row, and their appointments represent what many say is an increasingly 
determined effort by Bradley to shake up the city's housing bureaucracy and 
respond to a deepening housing crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's push to create low-cost housing began in 1988 with the formation of 
the Blue Ribbon Committee on Affordable Housing. The group recommended, among 
other things, raising large sums to build affordable housing by charging a fee 
to big commercial developers. 
</P>
<P>
A slow response by the City Council to those recommendations prompted some Blue 
Ribbon Committee members to criticize Bradley several months ago for not 
lobbying council members hard enough. Today, however, 15 of the group's 16 
original recommendations are being implemented, including the developer fee. 
</P>
<P>
Two other key recommendations -- the creation of a housing department and a 
Housing Commission -- were implemented this fall and are considered by many to 
be the most extensive bureaucratic reforms in City Hall in a decade. Before 
that, housing efforts were overseen by 11 different divisions within city 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Squier said passage next week by voters of Proposition K would boost his 
department's budget by 40%. However, he said, "Even with that, we have to get 
other local sources of funds because no one source can make up for federal 
housing cuts of the past decade." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from funding, he said, the issue in the 1990s will be to change city 
policies that work at cross purposes to discourage housing construction. 
</P>
<P>
Squier cited the failure by planners to create high-density housing zones along 
the new Blue Line, saying that such a transportation corridor, if planned in 
today's climate, "would be an obvious choice for low and middle-income 
(apartment units)." 
</P>
<P>
According to City Housing Coordinator Michael Bodaken -- another 1990 mayoral 
appointment from the activist ranks -- Bradley selected Squier after the city 
Personnel Department chose 12 candidates from 36 applicants nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
During a four-month search, a four-member committee, including Heskin, narrowed 
the finalists to six and forwarded those names to Bradley, Bodaken said. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor was looking for administrative experience, vision and 
problem-solving," said Bodaken, a former Legal Aid attorney. "Nobody -- not the 
department or the mayor or the council -- wanted a political appointment." 
</P>
<P>
Heskin said scores given to the candidates by the four-member committee "are 
public record, and Gary Squier got 95 out of 100. The next candidate, a really 
terrific choice from New York, got 91, but Gary had a clear edge for his 
knowledge not only of housing but of City Hall."

ELECTIONS SANTA PAULA CITY COUNCIL; 
</P>
<P>
SMALL-TOWN CIVILITY MARKS RACE FOR 3 SEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Paula's City Council election Tuesday will feature seven candidates with 
similar platforms vying for three seats, including two vacated by incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
All candidates share the vision of making Santa Paula a tourist center by 
giving its downtown a face lift and strengthening its retail and light 
industrial sectors to create more jobs and increase the city's tax base. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, all the candidates want to preserve the city's small-town 
feel by protecting its agriculture and maintaining its greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
And they all say they want more recreational opportunities for the city's 
youth, more affordable housing for first-time buyers and a mobile home rent 
control law to help senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, the Santa Paula election amounts to nothing more than a 
popularity contest and a reaffirmation that Santa Paula is headed in the right 
direction -- and most candidates say as much. 
</P>
<P>
"The funny thing about elections in a small town is that the candidates are all 
friends, and there's nothing they can say that the others can't -- except that 
they have more experience, are more attuned to what the city is doing," 
candidate Wayne Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
But while the hopefuls go out of their way to be polite and supportive of each 
other, the race has been far from dull. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, non-candidates from the business community have subjected 16-year 
incumbent John Melton to a type of stinging criticism that is rarely seen in 
small-town elections. 
</P>
<P>
"Our city needs new ideas, energy and vision, not a four-term incumbent!" said 
a series of advertisements that ran in the local newspaper recently. 
</P>
<P>
"I just feel some people have stayed in power for too long and lost touch with 
their constituents," said Howard Bolton, former president and current board 
member of the Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Bolton, who also heads the newly formed Committee for Creative Options, is 
married to Mayor Kay Wilson, who, along with incumbent Carl Barringer, will not 
seek reelection. Wilson has had several public disagreements with Melton at 
council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, the chamber on Oct. 17 took the unprecedented step of endorsing a 
two-term limit for City Council members, even though there is no such ballot 
initiative before the voters. The chamber's action -- timed to coincide with 
the only candidates' debate during the race -- amounted to a thinly veiled 
no-confidence vote against Melton. 
</P>
<P>
And while the challengers have refrained from attacking the incumbent, all six 
said at the candidates' forum that they support a two-term limit. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years of John Melton is enough. Bad News does not improve with age," 
reads a sign atop an old pickup truck on 10th Street near City Hall. The sign 
belongs to Ray Gonzales, an auto mechanic who has been fighting the City 
Council since 1983, when his social club's permission to operate a beer garden 
at the annual Citrus Festival was revoked. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Gonzales has used signs to accuse the council of being racist, 
corrupt and dictatorial -- but never had Gonzales mentioned Melton by name. In 
the past, most of Gonzales' attacks were aimed at the Kiwanis Club, which runs 
the Citrus Festival, and at Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
After the council passed an ordinance prohibiting signs on motor vehicles, 
Gonzales sued, and a state appellate court ruled that Gonzales was entitled to 
display his signs, effectively striking down the city's ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales says the current council, which has only one Latino member, has not 
been responsive to the needs of the Latino community, which is close to 
two-thirds of Santa Paula's population of 24,500. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't fight in Vietnam to come back and be treated as a second-class 
citizen," Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
His campaign has struck a chord with some members of the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican-American Chamber of Commerce has balked at taking an official 
position on the Gonzales controversy, but some members say Gonzales has a 
legitimate gripe. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sympathetic with Ray, but we don't want to get involved in his dispute 
with the city," said Vic Salas, the chamber's first president and a current 
director. Salas said he will support the two Latino candidates, Bob Borrego and 
Jesse Ornelas, because the city needs more input from Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
"Al Urias is the only Hispanic on the council right now, and it's hard to make 
the system change without several sympathetic voices to fight it," Salas said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales' signs -- an obvious obstacle in Santa Paula's efforts to become a 
tourist haven -- have turned out to be the most divisive issue in the race. 
</P>
<P>
In response to attempts by the city to settle the dispute, Gonzales said he 
would take down the signs for $10,000, and Ornelas said the city should pay. 
"The city could have eliminated the problem from the start by simply writing a 
letter of apology" for siding with the Kiwanis Club in the Citrus Festival 
dispute, Ornelas said. 
</P>
<P>
Another candidate, Co Engelhart, said, "If Gonzales has spent so much time and 
effort fighting the city, he must be very hurt. I don't see why a new council 
can't sit down with him and reach a reasonable compromise." 
</P>
<P>
Melton said the city is doing its best to reach a compromise. Candidates 
Margaret Ely and Borrego say the issue should be resolved in court. 
</P>
<P>
The other two candidates, Johnson and Flo Zakrajshek, said they don't know 
enough about the issue to venture an opinion. 
</P>
<P>
The criticism has hurt Melton, who by the Sept. 30 filing period had raised 
less than $1,000 for his reelection campaign. Ornelas' and Johnson's war chests 
-- at last count the two largest in the race -- are more than twice as big as 
Melton's. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Melton, 60, a former corporate business manager, has chosen not to 
fight back. Instead, he dwells on familiar themes such as protecting the city's 
greenbelt agreements with Fillmore and Ventura and creating more jobs to retain 
more tax dollars in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Like Melton, current planning commissioners Johnson and Borrego have emphasized 
their experience as public servants, and each has made it the central theme of 
his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 50, former chairman of the Housing Authority, said remapping the 1976 
General Plan, creating low-income housing and attracting fancy boutiques and 
antique shops downtown are his priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Borrego, 63, a legislative aide to state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), 
said the main contributions that he has to offer to the council, other than his 
longtime involvement with the community, are the regional connections he has 
established in county government and the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to working for Hart, Borrego has served as an administrative 
assistant to former state Sen. Omer Rains and County Supervisor John K. Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most talked about challenger is Ornelas, 39, the son-in-law of 
Urias, whose seat is not up for reelection. Ornelas' decision to run has 
aroused more curiosity than criticism, and as far as Ornelas is concerned, it's 
a non-issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I married Cristina, not her father," he said. "I'm not looking for any member 
of the council to take me under his wing." 
</P>
<P>
Ornelas, a housing officer at Cabrillo Development Co., which specializes in 
low- and moderate-income housing, said his top priority is creating a 25% quota 
for affordable housing in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Ely, 44, a legal assistant, said her main concern is slowing development. "If 
we are going to build up from wall to wall, we might as well live in the San 
Fernando Valley," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Zakrajshek, 60, bills herself as the "common sense" candidate and says she has 
no biases going into the race. "It's best to listen to people, analyze in your 
mind what they say, and come up with the best decision," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Engelhart, 53, is former president of the city's school district and public 
library. As a Dutch immigrant who arrived in Santa Paula virtually broke, 
Engelhart said he sympathizes with the plight of the low-income senior citizens 
and Mexican immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the value of pennies," he said. "I plan to listen to every single 
person that needs to be listened to, and I'll treat everybody the same."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 MORE SUSPECTS JAILED IN KILLING OF SEAMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two more suspected gang members were arrested Tuesday, bringing to four the 
number of suspects jailed in the shooting death of a Navy seaman who challenged 
graffiti-writing gang members, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Albert Jacinto, 20, and a 16-year-old boy whose name was withheld, 
were booked on suspicion of murder at the Carson sheriff's station about 11:30 
a.m. Tuesday, Deputy Rafael Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
Their hometowns were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Real Sabio Tojot, 19, and Ronald Caasi Caampued, 18, both of Carson, were 
arrested Monday on suspicion of murder and also held without bail. A 
.38-caliber pistol believed to be the murder weapon was confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Alfred Kuhia Jr., 21, of Buena Park was a seaman aboard the USS 
Fort Fisher based in San Diego. He and two friends saw about a dozen gang 
members painting slogans on a wall in Carson Friday. When Kuhia told them to 
stop, one gang member shot him.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MURDER CHARGE FILED IN NURSE'S STABBING 
DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A murder charge that carries a possible death sentence was filed Tuesday 
against a construction worker accused of fatally stabbing an emergency-room 
nurse in her Beverlywood home. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Francisco Guerra, 31, was awaiting arraignment in West Los Angeles 
Municipal Court. The district attorney's office charged him with a single 
murder count plus a special-circumstance allegation -- lying in wait -- that 
would qualify him for a possible death sentence if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Guerra fatally stabbed Kathleen Powell, a nurse at the Beverly 
Hills Medical Center, in her house last Thursday. Guerra, who was doing 
renovation work on the house next to Powell's, was arrested Friday.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOBILE HOME RENT CONTROL EXTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HULSE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the urging of more than 100 mobile home owners in attendance, the County 
Board of Supervisors voted to extend a rent-control ordinance Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, which limits rent increases for spaces to 5% a year, was due to 
expire Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Mobile home residents, most of them elderly, feared that they would lose rent 
control if the ordinance expired. The revised ordinance has no expiration date. 
</P>
<P>
Mural Torrance, representing the Mobile Home Owners Alliance, submitted a 
petition with 747 names urging the supervisors to keep the rent-control 
ordinance on the books. 
</P>
<P>
However, he also complained about a provision that the supervisors inserted in 
the ordinance last December that benefits mobile home park owners. 
</P>
<P>
The provision, which stemmed from a federal court decision, allows park owners 
to raise the rent on spaces to any level they wish when a mobile home is sold. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance said the provision, called vacancy decontrol, has had a chilling 
effect on mobile home sales. He said that in one park, rent for a space went 
from $311 to $528 a month after the home was sold. 
</P>
<P>
"They lose interest rapidly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
David Evans, representing the Western Mobile Home Assn., said his group of park 
owners opposed any move by the supervisors to eliminate the vacancy decontrol 
provision. 
</P>
<P>
But the supervisors said they would reconsider the provision after January when 
two new people take their seats on the board. They said they may remove it or 
put a cap on rent increases that park owners can charge after a home is sold. 
</P>
<P>
The rent-control ordinance was adopted in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
It applies to 1,555 spaces in 24 parks in the unincorporated area of the 
county. JANE HULSE

HELICOPTER FORCED TO LAND ON HIGHWAY

<P>
An Oxnard helicopter pilot was forced to land on the Pacific Coast Highway 
north of Ventura on Tuesday after a fuel system problem caused his chopper's 
engine to begin sputtering, a California Highway Patrol spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Giacoma Valenti nor the unidentified passenger in his Hiller helicopter 
were injured in the 2:40 p.m. emergency landing near Emma Wood State Beach, 
Officer Jim Utter said. 
</P>
<P>
Valenti had taken off from Santa Paula for a brief flight up the coast when the 
engine problem occurred. Utter said Valenti brought the craft down on the 
northbound lane of the highway, causing traffic delays for about an hour while 
a mechanic made preliminary repairs. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot then taxied the helicopter to a nearby clearing, where the repairs 
were completed, and flew the craft home an hour later, police said. CHRISTOPHER

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PIRU; 
</P>
<P>
70% WATER SERVICE RATE HIKE PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET BERGAMO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 70% increase in domestic water rates has been proposed for Piru by Warring 
Water Co., the unincorporated community's water purveyor since 1926. If 
approved by the state Public Utilities Commission, the new rates will be the 
first increase in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
At a public hearing in Piru on Tuesday, Gary Pace, a Fillmore resident who is 
negotiating to buy half of the family-owned company, tried to justify the 
increase by citing the effects of inflation on operating expenses, maintenance 
costs and taxes. Pace said the company has operated with a deficit for the last 
five years and has lost $33,000 during the first nine months of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The company has needed to raise rates since 1985, Manager Frances Warring 
Talbot said. "But I was trying to sell my share and I was advised against 
raising rates at that time." 
</P>
<P>
A Warring family nephew, Michael Giddings, remains half-owner of the company 
but lives out of state and has not been directly involved in managing the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
Talbot, 76, is retiring after 26 years in the company. She said that state 
regulations and the sale of a farm irrigation portion of the company prolonged 
the transfer of company responsibilities to Pace and delayed the rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
Basic services charges for most residents will double from $4 to $8 monthly if 
the PUC approves the increase. Pace outlined a new rate schedule to residents, 
including an increase of 22 cents per 100 cubic feet of water. The first 300 
cubic feet of water will no longer be included free with the basic monthly fee. 
All water will be subject to the new charge of 85 cents per 100 cubic feet, 
Pace said. One hundred cubic feet is 748 gallons, Pace said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the size of the increase shocked some residents, Daniel Paige, a 
senior utilities engineer with the PUC, said that given the length of time 
since the last rate hike, the big jump in fees should not be a complete 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing Tuesday, some residents expressed concern that the increase 
would hurt people living on fixed incomes, and there were complaints about poor 
maintenance of the system in recent years. JANET BERGAMO

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-TEACHER GETS PROBATION IN ABUSE OF 5 
STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former special education teacher convicted of verbally and physically abusing 
five seriously handicapped students at a San Pedro school was sentenced this 
week to two years' probation and ordered to undergo counseling. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro Municipal Court Judge Lois Anderson Smaltz also ordered Juanita 
Barnett, 59, to perform 200 hours of community service and barred her from 
working with children under age 13. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett was convicted in August on five counts of willful cruelty toward a 
child. A jury found that she had threatened children in her class at Willenberg 
Special Education Center and struck them with her hands, a hairbrush and a 
jigsaw puzzle, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Juana Webman. 
</P>
<P>
Smaltz said overwhelming support from the community and Barnett's 26-year 
record of service made her conclude that the abuse was aberrant behavior by a 
"a lady who cares very much about children."

MAN ARRESTED AFTER HIT-AND-RUN MELEE INJURES 4, SHUTS DOWN FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An undercover sheriff's deputy, a trucker and a 6-year-old boy were struck by a 
speeding car and another officer was bitten by a dog in a bizarre hit-and-run 
melee that closed the westbound Pomona Freeway in the City of Industry for more 
than three hours Tuesday morning, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were standing along the right shoulder of the freeway near the 
Azusa Avenue exit, where the deputy's unmarked van, a flatbed trailer and a 
passenger car had collided in a minor rear-end accident, according to the 
California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 8:10 a.m., a car that CHP officials said was driven by Thomas 
Marshall Penick, 42, of Los Angeles, came down the shoulder at about 60 m.p.h., 
hit the three victims and sped off. 
</P>
<P>
The undercover narcotics detective, whose name was not released, was listed in 
stable condition with internal injuries in the intensive care unit of Queen of 
the Valley Hospital in West Covina, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The truck driver, identified as David L. Butler, 42, of Long Beach, was 
hospitalized with minor injuries. And the boy, who was in the passenger car, 
was treated at the scene for scrapes and released. 
</P>
<P>
In all, there were five undercover deputies in the van. Authorities said the 
officers were on duty, but would not reveal their mission. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes after the hit-and-run collision, a sheriff's patrol car arrived at the 
scene. One of the undercover deputies hopped into the car, which caught up with 
the suspect's 1985 Chevrolet Sprint about three miles away on the center 
divider. As the deputy moved to arrest Penick, a black Labrador retriever 
jumped from the car and bit the officer on the arm, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy, who also was not identified, was treated at a nearby clinic and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
All westbound lanes of the freeway were closed at Hacienda Boulevard near the 
City of Industry until about 11:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Penick -- who was driving on a suspended license, according to the Department 
of Motor Vehicles -- had his jaw broken during a struggle with the arresting 
officers, the CHP said. He was booked in the jail ward of County-USC Medical 
Center for felony hit-and-run, reckless driving and resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they have not determined why the Chevrolet was being driven on 
the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
The dog remained at large. 
</P>
<P>
"Luckily, this sort of thing doesn't happen that often," said Officer Dave 
Boyland, a CHP spokesman.

USE OF COUNTY WORKERS ON CAMPAIGN ALLEGED; 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSITION C: A PROBE HAS BEEN ORDERED OVER CHARGES THAT TRANSIT OFFICIALS 
USED ON-DUTY EMPLOYEES TO PROMOTE THE BALLOT MEASURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD B. TAYLOR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich called Tuesday for an investigation into an 
allegation that the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission used on-duty 
county employees to promote Proposition C, the half-cent sales tax measure on 
next Tuesday's ballot that would finance mass transit projects. 
</P>
<P>
The county investigation was ordered after a commission employee complained 
that he and other staffers were being pressured to work on a phone bank, 
campaigning for the county tax measure that would raise $400 million a year. If 
true, the accusations could be a violation of election laws and county policy, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was asked to engage in this campaign activity during regular business hours 
and was told to conceal it by not reporting it on my time sheet," wrote Robert 
B. Mooney, who works for the Rail Construction Corp., a subsidiary of the 
Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Mooney produced a memo from his immediate supervisor that directed him to an 
office where the phone bank was located. The memo said, in part, "You will be 
working on the Prop C phone banks" and warned, "Do not put this on your time 
sheet." 
</P>
<P>
Mooney complained in letters to Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner and Supervisors 
Antonovich and Pete Schabarum. A spokesman for the district attorney said 
Tuesday that the matter will be examined to see if a criminal investigation is 
warranted. 
</P>
<P>
During the Board of Supervisors meeting Tuesday, Antonovich and Schabarum 
called for an investigation by the chief administrative officer to determine if 
the commission had violated county policy against ordering public employees to 
perform political work. 
</P>
<P>
Commission officials denied any wrongdoing and said they did not order or 
coerce staff to get involved in the campaign. The commission put the transit 
measure on the ballot and has launched a strong effort to gain support for the 
half-cent tax. 
</P>
<P>
"It was all aboveboard," said Neil Peterson, commission executive director. He 
said the staff was asked to volunteer time, and the 10 people who did take a 
few hours off to make the campaign calls used office space and phones provided 
by TransCal, a private consulting firm that oversees the commission's rail 
construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
Mooney's two immediate supervisors denied that they tried to force him to do 
phone work. 
</P>
<P>
Robin McCarthy, manager of the Rail Construction Corp.'s public affairs 
department, said that she asked Mooney if he was interested in working the 
phones. "He indicated he was willing to participate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy said she turned the matter over to a subordinate, who wrote the memo 
telling Mooney where and when to report for phone duty in the TransCal offices. 
She said Mooney was warned not to list the work on his time card because the 
commission wanted to ensure that he understood he would be campaigning on his 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened here was a misunderstanding," Peterson said. Mooney felt he was 
being coerced, but his immediate supervisor was under the impression he had 
volunteered, Peterson said, adding that any attempt to force an employee to do 
such campaign work would be "absolutely inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson ordered Mooney's immediate superior, John Higgins, to apologize for 
any misunderstanding and to send a memo to all commission employees making it 
clear that they were not required to do campaign work. 
</P>
<P>
The phone bank was a small office with two or three volunteers on the 
telephones at any one time, said Bevan Dufty, cq, the commission staff member 
coordinating the Proposition C campaign efforts. He said the volunteers phoned 
individuals who had supported previous transit measures and asked for their 
backing and financial support. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. James Hickey said that requiring a public employee to work 
on a political campaign is considered a misuse of public funds and is a felony. 
</P>
<P>
"We will evaluate to see if an investigation will be opened," Hickey concluded.

DON'T DESTROY DENNISON PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dennison Park is a beautiful rustic park designed for family gatherings and 
camping, for people to be in touch with nature. Although recreational vehicle 
parks do generate more money for the county, you can't pitch a tent on asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
To turn Dennison Park into an RV park -- a parking lot -- would be a crime 
against historic California parks. Most campsites have 200- to 300-year-old 
trees or large pines, which would need to be cut back or cut down for RV sites. 
This is in direct conflict with Ojai's policy and the city of Ojai's ordinance 
not to cut down oak trees. The county would also have to bulldoze most sites to 
make them level for the larger recreational vehicles, and the roads would have 
to be widened. In other words, the county would be destroying Dennison Park. 
</P>
<P>
We're running out of parks for the family -- with kids -- to camp in tents and 
be with nature. 
</P>
<P>
Our county supervisors need to know how we feel.

IS GALLEGLY PREPARED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Janice Gallegly's letter (Oct. 26), there has been an empty 
chair at our dinner table as well. My husband, Richard Freiman, has been 
campaigning full time for the office of U. S. representative since May. 
</P>
<P>
We both feel that the issues of freedom of choice, protection of our 
environment, and maintaining the integrity of Social Security, Medicare and 
other senior citizen programs are that important. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Elton Gallegly has refused to meet my husband in a debate even though 
Richard first challenged him to a debate as far back as June. KADY-TV tried to 
make it as easy as possible for the incumbent to debate by offering to telecast 
him via satellite from Washington. The incumbent refused, claiming that it 
would take him too long to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
How can he be able to vote on the issues if he's not prepared enough to discuss 
them?

MEASURE A NOT GROWTH MANAGEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Measure A sales tax for road widening and road extensions merely solidifies 
the legacy that "traffic congestion will expand to fill available space." 
Measure A is not growth management. 
</P>
<P>
It is an open-ended, road widening/road extension "wish list" fund; it does not 
mandate specific improvements. It also lacks creative, long-range, 
environmentally sound solutions in addressing the transportation of goods and 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Were Ventura County residents caught in a shell game when they voted June 5 for 
Proposition 111, which will increase the gasoline tax by 9 cents a gallon? 
Isn't it interesting that the same road-building proponents of Proposition 111 
didn't tell the citizens that Measure A's additional tax for roads was being 
planned for submittal to the voter. In less than 30 days after voter approval 
of Proposition 111, this additional tax measure was approved for placement on 
the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly, there are more pressing needs than having my tax dollars used to grid 
Ventura County with roadway cement.

Ventura County supervisorial candidate Bill Davis announced Tuesday that he 
will authorize release of his service record as a Culver City police officer to 
satisfy questions raised by opponent Vicky Howard. 
</P>
<P>
Howard, who serves on the Simi Valley City Council with Davis, has criticized 
her opponent for not allowing his police personnel file to be released. 
</P>
<P>
Davis first refused to authorize release of his police record, saying "there 
are things there that I don't think are anybody's business." 
</P>
<P>
But Davis said Tuesday that he changed his mind because he wanted to put to 
rest any doubts that he was, in fact, a police officer at one time. 
</P>
<P>
Davis has said he served as a Culver City police officer for seven months more 
than 40 years ago. He said he resigned after witnessing the death of a child 
who had been hit by a car. CARLOS V. LOZANO

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deficit Reduction 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 228 to 200, the House approved the conference report on budget 
legislation (HR 5835) aimed at slowing deficit growth by about $490 billion 
over five years. Democrats voted 181 for and 74 against, and Republicans 47 for 
and 126 against. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters said the measure would improve but not cure the U.S. deficit 
problem. For example, red ink this fiscal year is projected to top $200 billion 
even after the bill trims it by $40 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The revenue side of HR 5835 is estimated at about $189 billion. Upper-income 
taxpayers will supply most of the tax yield as a result of curbs on their 
deductions and personal exemptions. Most other Americans will be touched by 
higher taxes on gasoline, alcoholic beverages, cigarettes and airline tickets, 
an expansion of the wage base for Medicare payroll taxes and other revenue 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
A defense slowdown of about $185 billion over five years is the bill's major 
spending restraint. Medicare curbs are estimated at $44 billion, about $10 
billion of which will hit beneficiaries. Spending growth is curbed by $12 
billion for farm subsidies, $7.6 billion for civil servant retirement benefits 
and $3.7 billion for veterans' benefits, among other restraints. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to join the bipartisan leadership and President Bush in support 
of the deficit-reduction bill.

SHERMAN OAKS FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The headline Oct. 6 should have been: "All of Sherman Oaks seeks 2-story height 
limits," not, "Yaroslavsky to Seek 2-Story Height Limit." 
</P>
<P>
Sherman Oaks, to more people than possibly several Sherman Oaks Homeowner Assn. 
members, is not just the blocks between Columbus Avenue and Beverly Glen 
Boulevard along Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The character of Sherman Oaks is what brought it to its present ambience. The 
character of Sherman Oaks and all other areas is the product of blending all 
groups, all concepts of aesthetics and architecture, all of the day-to-day 
changing views of those who travel through, to and within, especially those who 
walk, work, shop and live here. 
</P>
<P>
Zev, how quickly and eagerly you continuously limit the rights and options of 
one section of the community -- how forthrightly you impose upon a community 
the future monotony of architecture without the pleasing aesthetics of 
variation and texture. You tell me: What is the character of Sherman Oaks and 
what do the people of Sherman Oaks believe the character of their community is. 
Poll us -- then let's go from there. 
</P>
<P>
A community's character like its people should be changing, vibrant, alive and 
different -- yet the same. There should be room for variations of a theme. 
</P>
<P>
Zev, relax, listen to the old Zev who fought for self-expression of people not 
for restriction after restriction. 
</P>

COUNTY REDUCES BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To offset soaring health-care costs, the County Board of Supervisors reduced 
insurance benefits Tuesday for county employees. 
</P>
<P>
But the cuts were not as drastic as had been anticipated by some employees, who 
mounted a letter-writing campaign urging the board to retain the current level 
of benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the increase will mean that some employees will pay up to an 
additional $29.21 a month for health insurance. Their costs would jump from 
$53.84 to $83.05 a month -- more than a 50% increase. 
</P>
<P>
The rates vary according to the county's five insurance plans. For 2,800 of the 
county's 6,000 employees, the rate adjustment will mean no increase. In 
response to employee complaints, the supervisors agreed to subsidize one of the 
five available health insurance plans so members of Public Employees Assn. 
could subscribe at no cost. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors also eliminated vision care benefits. But they agreed to 
provide a way for employees to subscribe on their own, and they offered to 
employ an optometrist for free eye examinations. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Komers, county director of personnel, said health insurance for the 
county's 6,000 employees is costing the county $22 million a year -- up from 
$2.8 million in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"If we continue, it will consume our entire budget," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Komers said that throughout the health-care industry, medical costs are 
increasing almost 20% a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We must collect enough money to pay out claims that are coming in at a higher 
rate every month," he said.

A former special education teacher convicted of verbally and physically abusing 
five seriously handicapped students at a San Pedro school was sentenced this 
week to two years' probation and ordered to undergo counseling. San Pedro 
Municipal Court Judge Lois Anderson Smaltz also ordered Juanita Barnett, 59, to 
perform 200 hours of community service and barred her from working with 
children under age 13. Barnett was convicted in August on five counts of 
willful cruelty toward a child.

COUNTY / IN BRIEF: CATALINA ISLAND; 
</P>
<P>
INQUIRY DROPPED IN CRUISE SHIP SINKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a four-month criminal investigation, the Environmental Protection Agency 
has concluded it cannot prove that a salvage company deliberately scuttled the 
former cruise ship Princess Louise miles short of its intended resting place 
off Catalina Island. But EPA spokeswoman Lois Grunwald said the agency is still 
considering possible civil fines against Trinav Shipping Ltd. for allowing the 
2,300-ton vessel to sink too close to an ocean dump site in San Pedro Channel. 
</P>
<P>
The site is used for disposal of dredge material from local harbors and is 
significant to the EPA, Grunwald said, because of ocean floor tests that may 
now be hampered by the ship. The Princess Louise, for years a popular floating 
restaurant, sank in 900 feet of water on June 30 en route to Catalina. Willem 
Boelman, president of Trinav, has maintained that he had no choice but to 
scuttle the ship short of its destination because it was taking on water and 
posed a risk to his salvage crew.

HOLLYWOOD STRIKES UP THE BAND; 
</P>
<P>
FILM STUDIOS ARE AGAIN MAKING OVERTURES TO THE BROADWAY MUSICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA J. EASTON and DAVID J. FOX, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's barely enough room for potential investors to squeeze into the 
auditions for the planned Broadway production of "The Secret Garden": Hollywood 
has arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past two weeks, such film producers as Scott Rudin, Dawn Steel and 
Sherry Lansing, plus executives from Disney, Columbia/Tri-Star, 20th Century 
Fox, the Geffen Film Co. and Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment have 
poured into Manhattan's 890 Studios to view the show-in-the-rough, based on the 
children's fantasy novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett. 
</P>
<P>
"I was quite stunned by the hype," says Marty Bauer, one of the talent agents 
involved in selling the film rights to the production. "We were hoping to keep 
this low-key until it went to Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
All that attention is peculiar enough for a show that won't go to Broadway 
until April. But Hollywood's surge of interest in "The Secret Garden" -- 
adapted for the stage by Marsha Norman, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1983 for 
her play " 'night, Mother" -- is notable for another reason: It's a musical. 
</P>
<P>
Considered one of the riskiest genres in film today, the musical has suddenly 
become as popular in Hollywood as the car fax. "A lot of people are interested 
in this whole genre of movies that has disappeared," says producer and former 
record mogul David Geffen, an investor in the upcoming Broadway production of 
"Miss Saigon" who is also developing "Dreamgirls" for the screen with director 
Frank Oz. Adds producer Rudin: "It's something that you can't turn on the TV 
and see. It's still the domain of theaters and movies." 
</P>
<P>
David Hoberman, president of Disney's Touchstone Pictures, says simply: "It's 
time again." His company is developing a number of musical projects and plans a 
production of "Newsies," a musical about a newspaper strike to be directed by 
"Dirty Dancing" choreographer Kenny Ortega. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's other movie arm, Hollywood Pictures, also has a variety of musicals in 
the works. "We firmly believe that the musical genre is viable in today's movie 
marketplace," says company president Ricardo Mestres. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Pictures is expected to secure the rights to "Evita" -- once a 
bankruptcy court sorts through the legal tangles surrounding the current owner, 
Weintraub Entertainment Group -- with Madonna starring as the ambitious wife of 
former Argentine leader Juan Peron. TV's "Moonlighting" creator, Glen Gordon 
Caron, is rumored to be the leading candidate as director, and the production's 
original producer, Robert Stigwood, is expected to produce the film version of 
the Andrew Lloyd Webber-Tim Rice musical. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Pictures is also developing a remake of "Gold Diggers of 1933," the 
Busby Berkeley spectacle. And Steel, who has a production deal with Disney, is 
the lead bidder on "The Secret Garden," which also was a 1989 CBS "Hallmark 
Hall of Fame" special. 
</P>
<P>
But Disney isn't the only movie company intent on re-creating the glory days of 
the Hollywood musical. Studio executives, producers and directors all over town 
are turning an eye to the genre. Their interest coincides with the mixed 
box-office results of last summer's big-budget action pictures -- combined with 
the surprise success of cheaper romantic comedies like Disney's "Pretty Woman" 
and Paramount's "Ghost." Many industry observers believe that Hollywood's 
interest in musicals is one outgrowth of a renewed determination to produce 
family fare that doesn't involve car chases or heavy munitions. 
</P>
<P>
Among the musicals now in the works: 
</P>
<P>
* "Miss Saigon" producer Cameron Mackintosh is talking to Steven Spielberg 
about directing a film version of the musical about a love affair between a GI 
and a Vietnamese girl during the fall of Saigon. The Claude-Michel 
Schonberg/Alain Boubil musical opened in London last year to wide acclaim and 
is scheduled to open in New York on April 11. It already has accumulated $24 
million in advance ticket sales, the largest pre-opening receipts in Broadway 
history. 
</P>
<P>
* Nine years after the London opening of "Cats," Spielberg and Lloyd Webber 
plan to adapt the show, which was based on the poems of T.S. Eliot, as an 
animated feature film for Universal Pictures. The deal was announced in June, 
but none of the parties are talking production details or timetables yet. 
</P>
<P>
* Four years after "Phantom of the Opera" opened in London, Lloyd Webber is 
finalizing details for the movie version, to be directed by Joel Schumacher for 
Warner Bros., and starring original cast members Michael Crawford and Sarah 
Brightman, Lloyd Webber's estranged wife. Production of the film has been 
delayed from fall until next summer; that will prevent the movie from cutting 
into the business of four North American stage productions that continue to 
sell nearly $3 million worth of tickets each week. 
</P>
<P>
* Tri-Star still plans to go forward with a film adaptation of "Les 
Miserables," another international hit musical produced by Mackintosh and 
written by the same team responsible for "Miss Saigon." "The hope is that we'd 
go forward in 1991," said Mackintosh's executive producer, Nick Allott. He 
added that a director has not been signed. 
</P>
<P>
* Bette Midler and James Caan star in "For the Boys," the story of two USO 
entertainers who travel overseas during World War II and the Korean War. Mark 
Rydell directs the 20th Century Fox film, which is to begin production in the 
coming weeks. Midler also plans to star in "Lenya," a drama with music based on 
the life of singer Lotte Lenya. Tri-Star Pictures will distribute, but no 
timetable has been set. 
</P>
<P>
* Producer-director Rob Reiner -- together with screenwriter William Goldman 
and Broadway composer Stephen Sondheim -- is working on an original musical for 
his Castle Rock Entertainment company that probably won't go into production 
until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
* Producer-director James L. Brooks is also penning an original musical. The 
only detail he will divulge is that it's a comedy with singing and dancing. 
</P>
<P>
For all of these filmmakers, bringing a musical to the screen in the 1990s is a 
daunting task. "It's a humbling experience," sighs Brooks, who is 30 pages into 
his screenplay. "It's extraordinary how many more problems there are if you 
care about making the picture real." 
</P>
<P>
The screenwriter has to craft a story structure in which it is both natural and 
non-disruptive for the actors to break into song. "The question always is: Can 
you make it work?," says Geffen. "It's hard to integrate music into a story 
without stopping it." 
</P>
<P>
The music itself is also a stumbling block. Filmmakers note that popular music 
today is less concerned with telling a story than it once was. "Popular music 
and show music used to be close cousins," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
And Broadway -- traditionally Hollywood's main source of musical material and 
writing talent -- isn't generating as many hit shows as it once did. The result 
is that fewer writers and composers have an opportunity to develop the craft of 
writing songs for dramatic situations. The people who created many of 
Hollywood's most memorable musicals -- such as George and Ira Gershwin, Irving 
Berlin, Cole Porter and Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II -- had their 
roots in musical theater, said screenwriter-producer Ernest Lehman, who adapted 
such stage shows as "West Side Story" and "The Sound of Music" to the screen. 
</P>
<P>
In today's arena, the arrival of Lloyd Webber continues that tradition. 
Similarly, composer Alan Menken and lyricist Howard Ashman, who scored Disney's 
animated hit "The Little Mermaid" directly for the screen, also have a theater 
background as the creators of the 1982 musical version of "Little Shop of 
Horrors," which was filmed in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
While there is a rich history of successful movie musicals, their recent record 
at the box office has been a checkered one: "Fame" in 1980, 'Victoria" and 
"Annie" in 1982, "Flashdance" in 1983, "Footloose" in 1984, "Little Shop of 
Horrors" and last year's "The Little Mermaid" all fared well at the box office. 
But such productions as the 1981 "Pennies From Heaven," the 1985 "A Chorus 
Line" and last year's "Sing" and "Bert Rigby, You're a Fool" were outright 
bombs. 
</P>
<P>
As with most genres, the popularity of musicals has been cyclical. In the 
mid-'60s, moviegoers flocked to such musicals as "My Fair Lady," "Funny Girl," 
"The Sound of Music," and "Mary Poppins." But what followed was a string of 
expensive flops, produced by and starring some of Hollywood's biggest names. 
Among them: "Camelot," with Vanessa Redgrave and Richard Harris; "Doctor 
Doolittle," with Rex Harrison; "Star," with Julie Andrews; "Paint Your Wagon," 
starring Clint Eastwood; "Finian's Rainbow," which was Fred Astaire's last 
musical; "Sweet Charity," with Shirley MacLaine; "Mame," with Lucille Ball; and 
"The Wiz," with Diana Ross. 
</P>
<P>
No musical has been nominated for a best-picture Oscar since "All That Jazz" in 
1979. Before that, the last two musicals nominated for best picture were 
"Cabaret" in 1972 and "Fiddler on the Roof" in 1971. The last musical to win a 
best-picture Oscar was "Oliver!" in 1968. 
</P>

"You can make comedies that flop and you can make action- adventure pictures 
that flop, and people will say that the public just didn't want to see that 
particular comedy or adventure film," said Craig Zadan, a co-producer of 
"Footloose" and the author of a biography on Broadway composer-lyricist Stephen 
Sondheim. "But as far as I know, musicals are the only genre that, when they 
flop, people say that the audience doesn't want to see those kinds of movies 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Pictures' Mestres doesn't believe that musicals as a genre are 
cursed. Rather, he says, audiences haven't been given quality productions. "I'm 
not sure that there have been recent musicals that embody the style and quality 
that characterizes the most successful ones. If 'Grease' were released today 
(it would be a hit)." 
</P>
<P>
Zadan predicts that the crop of Lloyd Webber musicals will test the public's 
appetite for more traditional musicals. "If they are successful, you'll see a 
wildly aggressive rush to make musicals. But if they flop, it will be like what 
happened after 'Hello, Dolly!' and 'Star.' There won't be any musicals for 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Zadan, who is a co-producer of the upcoming "Lenya," said that the kinds of 
musicals in the works now generally are not written in the older style, "where 
people burst out into song." 
</P>
<P>
What passes for musicals now are actually dramas with music, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not selling them as musicals," Zadan said. "We're sort of backing into 
them and saying, 'This really isn't a musical. It's a drama that has songs.' "

LAST PICTURE SHOW IN LITTLE TOKYO; 
</P>
<P>
FILM: AN ERA ENDS FOR THE COUNTRY'S ONLY REMAINING JAPANESE-LANGUAGE MOVIE 
HOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Little Tokyo Cinemas in Yaohan Plaza in downtown Los Angeles will close its 
doors for the last time tonight, leaving the nation without a Japanese-language 
movie house. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the war years of the '40s and the year between the closing of the 
Kokusai in 1986 and the opening of the Little Tokyo in June, 1987, 
Japanese-language theaters -- as many as four at one time -- have been 
operating in Los Angeles for 80 years. Ironically, at a time when Japanese 
companies are investing heavily in the American film industry and the 
Japanese-speaking community is growing, the last of those theaters is going out 
of business. 
</P>
<P>
There's talk of a restaurant -- a Chinese restaurant -- going in where the 
Little Tokyo Cinemas are, but the theaters are not closing for lack of 
interest. The decline of Japanese-language theaters is much more complicated 
than that and traces all the way back to the ways movies are made and 
distributed in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, the major Japanese film companies have never been able to see the 
wisdom of joining together to show only their best product at a single, 
conveniently located theater. An enterprising manager at the old Toho La Brea 
wanted to do that in the early '60s, making it the "Showplace of Japanese 
Cinema," and besides product from the prestigious Toho studio, he was able to 
pick up only the occasional lurid low-budget movie from the lesser ranking 
Nikkatsu. 
</P>
<P>
The inroads of television on film production were slow but sure in Japan, and 
the Japanese motion picture industry has been in a downward spiral for years. 
Consequently, the majors have been making fewer films, and many have been 
modest programmers of appeal primarily to the dwindling older Japanese-American 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the generally more venturesome Japanese independent 
productions such as Juzo Itami's "Tampopo" and his two "Taxing Women" films 
have increasingly ended up at art theaters in a mix with other foreign and 
offbeat films. The venerable Shochiku Co., which opened the Little Tokyo 
Cinemas under a management contract, was the last Japanese major to try to 
supply a local theater with predominantly its own product. Shochiku pulled out 
June 1. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, veteran exhibitor Moto Yokoyama, former owner-manager of the 
Kokusai, and Terry Boyle, also an experienced theater manager, have been 
running the Little Tokyo Cinemas for the Yaohan Plaza. The Plaza's general 
manager, Yoshiya Watanabe, has not returned calls regarding the closing of the 
theaters. 
</P>
<P>
Yokoyama and Boyle have been with the Little Tokyo since its opening, Yokoyama 
as assistant manager and Boyle as chief projectionist, publicist and assistant 
booker. They lament the closing of the Little Tokyo Cinemas -- business, they 
believe, has picked up since they've been free of the commitment to show 
Shochiku product. Yokoyama would like to find another theater to show Japanese 
films while Boyle hopes to relocate somewhere on the Westside and with a 
different policy. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe there is a strong market for a first-class repertory theater in Los 
Angeles -- a great theater, showing great foreign and American classics at fair 
prices and with other innovative policies that will attract a large and loyal 
following," said Boyle recently. "To support this, I point to the success 
enjoyed by the Little Tokyo with classic Japanese films in our Cinema 2. The 
recent Kurosawa retrospective and the near 10-hour 'Human Condition' often 
played to packed houses. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important to add that over 80% for the Japanese classics has been 
Caucasian. When you factor in the large number of people who would like to see 
these films but don't want to come downtown to see them you can forecast 
significant grosses for a good Westside location." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Japanese-speaking movie fans will have the same very sparse 
menu of Japanese-language films as the rest of us, a handful of award winners 
and high-profile movies geared toward sophisticated or international audiences. 
For the ordinary or more adventurous moviegoer, one more cultural link will be 
cut.

Sheriff verdict -- A headline on a Sept. 29 story about a verdict in a case 
involving Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates mischaracterized the jury's 
findings. The headline said in part that Gates "acted with 'reckless disregard' 
for the Constitution in favoring friends." In fact, jurors made no specific 
reference in their findings to any favoritism toward Gates' friends.

OVERTURNED CRANE PUTS VENTURA FWY. IN A VISE

An overturned crane closed eastbound lanes of the Ventura Freeway this morning, 
trapping commuters in gridlocked traffic and sending thousands of cars flooding 
onto surface streets. 
</P>
<P>
The operator of the crane suffered minor cuts and bruises in the 4:50 a.m. 
accident, which occurred as the crane was moving a five-ton concrete barrier 
into place at the interchange with the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
No one else was injured, but thousands of morning commuters found themselves in 
a virtual parking lot as eastbound traffic was backed up to Tampa Avenue, more 
than five miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic on the San Diego Freeway was also slowed by the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mess," Los Angeles police Officer Clarence Dean said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Normal traffic flow was restored about 9 a.m., California Highway Patrol 
Officer Jayne Suits said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jim McAllister, Caltrans' resident engineer for the ongoing 
Ventura Freeway Improvement Project, crews were replacing guardrails on the 
interchange. One eastbound lane of the Ventura Freeway and several transition 
roads were already closed for the work between midnight and 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the accident, the crane was replacing 20-foot temporary concrete 
barriers. Crews had already replaced 15 to 20 of the barriers and were 
scheduled to reopen the freeway lanes and transition roads as soon as the final 
barrier was in place. 
</P>
<P>
McAllister said the crane, which was in a closed fast lane, tipped and rolled 
onto its side. Weighed down by the concrete barrier, the arm of the crane fell 
onto the transition road from the southbound San Diego Freeway to the eastbound 
Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
All eastbound lanes of the Ventura Freeway were closed between 8:25 a.m. and 
8:40 a.m. as crews righted the crane and moved it out of traffic lanes. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid congestion on both freeways, thousands of commuters spilled onto 
surface streets.

An explosion ripped through a branch of the Security Pacific Bank today, 
triggering a fire that destroyed the building. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials were on the scene this morning trying to determine the cause of 
the 1 a.m. blast, which they said may have resulted from a bomb or a gas main. 
</P>
<P>
"It was definitely an explosion," said acting Capt. Joel Brick. "It was heard 
by numerous neighbors. Parts of the building are in the front of the street. 
The building was . . . destroyed by fire and a good part of the front of the 
building was blown off, that's what it looks like."

No injuries were reported, and an estimate of damages wasn't immediately

SAT EXAM, UNDER FIRE, TO GET MAJOR OVERHAUL

College Board trustees today announced the most drastic changes ever in the 
Scholastic Aptitude Test amid criticism that the exam is biased against women 
and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
The revisions to the nation's most widely used college entrance exam are 
designed in part to reduce students' reliance on test coaches, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The changes include restoration of a written essay section, math problems that 
require students to calculate their own answers rather than select from 
multiple choices and increased emphasis on critical reading. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees also voted today to place a greater emphasis on reading 
comprehension, allow the use of calculators and increase the 2 1/2-hour test's 
duration by 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Donald M. Stewart, announcing the changes at the board's annual 
business meeting in Boston, rebuffed suggestions the changes were made because 
of charges of cultural and gender bias. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing could be further from the truth," Stewart said. "The SAT has been in 
almost continual evolution. It has never been set in concrete." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the revisions, recommended by a panel appointed by the board, will be 
phased in by 1991, while most will be introduced in the spring of 1994, Stewart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Educational Testing Service of Princeton, N.J., administers the exam, while 
the College Board sponsors it. 
</P>
<P>
The SAT is taken by about 1 million college-bound students every year. It was 
first given to 8,000 students in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
The exam currently consists of two multiple-choice sections that test verbal 
and math skills. Each section is worth 800 points, for a perfect score of 
1,600. 
</P>
<P>
The College Board began field trials of possible SAT revisions three years ago. 
In 1988, the board created a committee of educators to evaluate the trials and 
determine what changes should be incorporated.

The Supreme Court has refused to order the continued federal funding of a 
family planning agency that provides abortion services in Third World 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
The court, over one dissenting vote, rejected an emergency plea from the 
Planned Parenthood Federation of America, which said it faced a cutoff today of 
assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development. 
</P>
<P>
The court's action was taken Monday, with only Justice John Paul Stevens voting 
to grant the emergency request. 
</P>
<P>
Planned Parenthood had asked Justice Thurgood Marshall to block the funding 
cutoff until a formal appeal could be filed. Marshall referred the request to 
the full court. 
</P>
<P>
The high court's action does not preclude the possibility the justices will 
agree to review the dispute when Planned Parenthood's formal appeal reaches it.

Scientists have pinpointed a rare, genetic flaw that makes people unusually 
sensitive to sunlight and predisposes them to skin cancer, it was reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
A Japanese team headed by Kiyoji Tanaka at Osaka University said it has 
discovered and made copies of a gene that when defective causes the most common 
type of a disease called xeroderma pigmentosum. 
</P>
<P>
About one in 250,000 people suffer from xeroderma pigmentosum, an inherited 
disease in which skin cells lack the normal ability to repair the damage the 
sun's ultraviolet light inflicts on genetic material. 
</P>
<P>
People with xeroderma pigmentosum must avoid exposure to sunlight. If they fail 
to do so, they run a high risk of developing skin cancer and potentially 
blinding growths on the eyelids and cornea.

2ND HINDU EFFORT TO STORM MOSQUE FAILS;

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of Hindu fundamentalists failed in a new attempt today to storm an 
ancient shrine claimed by Muslims, and at least 31 more people died in violence 
sparked by the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
A government minister resigned to protest Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap 
Singh's attempts to block construction of a Hindu temple on the disputed site, 
deepening the crisis in his beleaguered coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Armed paramilitary troops blocked about 5,000 Hindus from attempting to 
re-enter the mosque in Ayodhya, which has been the center of a decades-old 
dispute between India's Hindu majority and Muslim minority. 
</P>
<P>
Hindu fundamentalists broke through police cordons Tuesday and chipped away 
bricks and bits of plaster from the one-story mosque, which they want to 
replace with a temple. 
</P>
<P>
At least five Hindus were killed and 20 injured when police opened fire to 
throw back the rioters. One of the injured died of his wounds today. 
</P>
<P>
Press Trust of India said at least 30 other people were killed in street 
battles between Hindus and Muslims in four widely separated cities. 
</P>
<P>
At least 170 people have been killed in the last eight days, and Singh's 
11-month-old government has been pushed to the verge of collapse. The Hindu 
fundamentalist Bharatiya Janata Party withdrew support from the governing 
coalition last month to protest government policy on the temple project. 
</P>
<P>
The desertion left Singh without a majority in Parliament, but he has said he 
will win a vote of confidence scheduled for Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Singh's attempts to ride out the religious and political crisis received 
another setback today when the deputy minister for sports, Bhakta Charan Das, 
resigned to protest the police action at Ayodhya. 
</P>
<P>
Das, a Hindu, accused Singh in his resignation letter of "lack of 
foresightedness" in tackling the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute also triggered violence in neighboring Bangladesh, an Islamic 
nation, where Muslim mobs attacked temples and Hindu shops and homes after 
hearing of the situation in Ayodhya. Authorities clamped curfews on the capital 
Dhaka and the port city of Chittagong to curb rioting. 
</P>
<P>
In Ayodhya, volunteers of the fundamentalist World Hindu Council said they 
would make another attempt to storm the mosque Thursday.

The Drug Enforcement Administration says it is investigating whether one of its 
undercover couriers may have unknowingly carried the bomb that blew up Pan Am 
Flight 103. 
</P>
<P>
The December, 1988, bombing, which killed 270 people aboard the plane and in 
the village of Lockerbie, Scotland, has been attributed by law enforcement 
authorities to a pro-Iranian terrorist group. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the terrorist group put plastic explosive in a tape recorder 
in baggage that was shipped from Frankfurt, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
NBC News, which first reported the new DEA investigation Tuesday night, said it 
had learned that Pan Am's flights from Frankfurt had been used in a 
Cyprus-based undercover operation to fly informants and suitcases of heroin 
from the Middle East to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Nazir Khalid Jafaar, 20, of Detroit was killed in the bombing. The network said 
part of the drug agency review was to determine whether he had been enlisted in 
the drug operation and whether he had been tricked into carrying the bomb. 
</P>
<P>
The drug agency and German authorities had arranged for Pan Am's baggage 
operation in Frankfurt to be used to put suitcases of heroin on planes, 
apparently without the usual security checks, NBC News said. It cited an 
unidentified "airline source." 
</P>
<P>
In a statement late Tuesday, the DEA said it was aware of "allegations made to 
the media" that an agency operation was involved in the bombing.

Despite repeated government efforts to close loopholes, some wealthy Americans 
are still able to scrape together enough deductions to avoid paying any U.S. 
income tax, the Internal Revenue Service said today. 
</P>
<P>
Of 557,848 couples and individuals who reported income of $200,000 or more on 
returns filed in 1988, 472 -- with total income of $211 million -- paid no 
income tax. 
</P>
<P>
Two of them, both unidentified, even reported receiving unemployment 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
Of the high-income people who paid taxes, about 9,300 paid less than 5%. 
Another 17,082 reduced their liability to less than 10% -- about the same as 
that of the average $35,000-a-year family. 
</P>
<P>
In its annual report on the tax liabilities of high-income people, the IRS said 
two-thirds of those with income of $200,000 and up reported capital gains -- 
profits from the sale of investments -- that averaged $284,814. By comparison, 
salaries averaged $264,331.

Thelma Bellows wants her 10 McMillion dollars back. 
</P>
<P>
Bellows claims McDonald's handed her a raw deal when it announced her as the 
winner of a $10-million prize only to take it back hours later when the 
restaurant chain learned her daughter worked under the Golden Arches. 
</P>
<P>
Rules in the "McMillions" contest prohibit any prizes going to immediate family 
members of employees of McDonald's, NBC-TV or their franchises. 
</P>
<P>
A lawsuit filed by Bellows seeks $10 million in damages against McDonald's 
Corp., NBC-TV and a local McDonald's franchise. 
</P>
<P>
According to the suit, Bellows and her husband, Charles, went into a McDonald's 
restaurant in Auburn, near Bay City, on Oct. 11, purchased a meal and got the 
McMillions ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Their married daughter, Charlene Saunders, was working in the restaurant's 
drive-up window at the time but did not wait on them and did not give them the 
ticket, the suit states. 
</P>
<P>
When the couple learned from an NBC broadcast that they had the winning 
numbers, they received instructions from a McDonald's operator and drove to 
Detroit to claim their prize. 
</P>
<P>
According to the suit, a McDonald's official first told the couple that their 
daughter's job was no problem but later the same day he was reversed by 
higher-ups at the company and the prize was withdrawn.

GM REPORTS $2-BILLION LOSS IN THIRD QUARTER; 
</P>
<P>
AUTOS: A 'BIG BANG' RESTRUCTURING TO MAKE THE COMPANY MORE PROFITABLE IS 
APPLAUDED BY ANALYSTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
General Motors Corp. today reported a $2-billion loss for the third quarter, 
including a onetime charge of $2.1 billion for closing four assembly plants and 
related expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring move was applauded by industry analysts, who said it was the 
needed "big bang" to make the world's biggest auto maker more profitable. 
</P>
<P>
They had expected the charge to total anywhere from $700 million to $2.5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
The loss amounts to $3.54 per common share. GM had earned $516.9 million, or 72 
cents a share, in the year-earlier July-September quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Without the charge, GM's earnings for the latest period stood at $109 million, 
down 78.9% from earnings a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
GM's third-quarter revenue rose 6.9% to $30.8 billion from $28.8 billion last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The $2.1-billion charge includes costs associated with the formal shutting down 
of four assembly plants that were idled during the last three years. Those car 
plants are near Kansas City, Mo.; Framingham, Mass.; Pontiac, Mich., and 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the charge also contemplates the closing or consolidating of 
other plants and warehouses during the next three years. The company previously 
had announced that it planned to idle truck assembly plants in Scarborough, 
Canada; Lordstown, Ohio, and Pontiac, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
"The restructuring is a major element in GM's long-term strategic plan to 
improve the competitiveness and profitability of its North American 
operations," GM Chairman Robert Stempel said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Including the charge, GM said it lost $368.7 million, or $1.20 a share, in the 
first nine months of the year, compared to a profit of $3.52 billion, or $5.32 
a share, in the first nine months of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Revenues for the January-September period were $94.8 billion this year, down 
0.8% from $95.6 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street analysts said it was inevitable that GM would write off the 
facilities after it reached a new labor agreement with the United Auto Workers 
in September. They said they saw the closure decision as an example of the 
"housecleaning" GM needs to do to cut costs and improve its competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Shearson Lehman Bros.' Joseph Phillippi, who attended an analysts' meeting in 
New York with GM officials, said the charge was big enough to turn the auto 
maker around. "It's enough," he said. "You've got a long-term positive and a 
short-term negative." 
</P>
<P>
He called the restructuring a major initiative that Wall Street had long been 
pushing for. "This is the big bang that we have been arguing for," he said.

Stock prices declined slightly today, turning downward in the late stages of a 
drifting session as traders kept a close watch on oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 5.69 points to 2,442.33. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines on the New York Stock Exchange, 
with 744 up, 736 down and 472 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 156.06 million shares, against 153.45 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index edged up .09 to 166.17. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said stocks drew some tentative support from a drop in oil prices as 
the session began. By midafternoon, however, oil had recovered its early 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
In the economic news, the Commerce Department reported that new factory orders 
rose 0.1% in September. Excluding oil, however, the total showed a 1.1% 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday the government reported a stronger-than-expected gain in the gross 
national product, at a 1.8% annual rate after adjustment for inflation, in the 
third quarter of the year. 
</P>
<P>
But brokers said that failed to convince most market participants that the 
business outlook had improved to any significant extent. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices rose slightly in sluggish trading early today as traders awaited 
the Treasury announcement of next week's quarterly funding.

For the third year in a row, the Japanese were the world's top savers last 
year, salting away nearly four times as much money as Americans, a survey 
released today showed. Switzerland, Belgium, Austria and the Netherlands were 
next on the annual, dollar-denominated list published by the International 
Savings Banks Institute. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1989, the average Japanese had placed the equivalent of $40,119 
in savings and term deposits, the survey said. In Japanese money, the figure 
was up 11% from 1988 to about 5.7 million yen. The dollar total dropped about 
2%, mostly because the yen weakened against the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
The United States ranked 14th, with per capita savings of $10,822, up 4% from 
1988. The United States ranked eighth in last year's survey and seventh in 
1987. Many countries' figures, however, were boosted by the weakened dollar.

Willie Wilson, a one-time batting champion and Kansas City Royals outfielder 
for 13 seasons, will not be offered a contract for next season, the club 
announced today. 
</P>

Wilson, 35, who filed for free agency last week, is the third veteran to be cut

The club notified Royals second-baseman Frank White, 40, and catcher Bob Boone,

Wilson was supplanted as the everyday center fielder last season but played in 
115 games and hit .290 and led the Royals in stolen bases with 24. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was the Royals' first selection in the 1974 June free agent draft and 
compiled a .290 career batting average with 1,968 hits and 612 stolen bases. He 
won the American League batting title with a .332 average in 1982 and led the 
majors with a career-high 83 stolen bases in 1979.

A mistrial was declared today during the 14th day of jury deliberations in the 
trial of a sports agent accused of hiring two men to kill an ex-business 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
The Alameda County Superior Court panel reported it was deadlocked 9-3 to 
convict Michael Blatt of murder and conspiracy to commit murder. 
</P>
<P>
That left Judge Frank Kim no choice but to declare a mistrial, because jurors 
must reach unanimous verdicts for convictions in criminal cases under 
California law. 
</P>
<P>
Blatt, a developer in Stockton and briefly acting general manager of the 
Seattle Seahawks, was accused of hiring two former football players from the 
University of the Pacific to kill Laurence J. Carnegie. 
</P>
<P>
He was shot with an arrow from a crossbow near Stockton on Feb. 28, 1989, then 
strangled. Carnegie's body was dumped in rural Sonoma County. 
</P>
<P>
The two men Blatt was accused of hiring, James Mackey and Carl C. Hancock, 
admitted killing Carnegie. They were guaranteed reduced sentences for 
cooperating with Blatt's prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
"We went through a very conscientious decision process, and we were unable to 
reach agreement," said jury foreman Bob Peppler.

The Mike Tyson assault case went to the jury today after the fighter's attorney 
accused the woman who sued of concocting the allegations as a way to get rich 
quick. 
</P>
<P>
Her lawyer, however, urged jurors in closing arguments to believe her version 
of events because she had the "courage and guts" to take on the former world 
heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Miller, a 26-year-old computer operator from Queens, claims that Tyson 
grabbed her buttocks and breasts, cursed at her and threatened to punch her 
after she refused his advances at a Manhattan dance club Dec. 10, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who testified during the three-day trial, acknowledges that he was at 
Bentley's Disco that night but denies knowing or ever touching Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Miller is seeking up to $3.5 million in civil damages for assault and battery.

It already has been marked in Paris -- where President Francois Mitterrand 
named him a commander of the Legion of Honor -- and in San Francisco, Chicago, 
New York and Israel. Amsterdam and London are next. 
</P>
<P>
While some men are soldier-statesmen, Stern is an artist-statesman. He toured 
the Soviet Union in 1956, before official bilateral cultural exchanges existed. 
An Academy Award-winning film, "From Mao to Mozart: Isaac Stern in China," 
recorded his 1979 visit to the Shanghai Conservatory. 
</P>
<P>
With his wife, Vera, whom he met in Israel in 1951, Stern founded the 
America-Israel Cultural Foundation. He was also an original member of the U.S. 
National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
In 1960 Stern led the campaign to save Carnegie Hall, one of this nation's most 
famous landmarks, from the wrecking ball. In the 1980s he helped raise $60 
million for renovations. 
</P>
<P>
"Stern is first and foremost a great artist, but he also has a very developed 
sense of social responsibility," said James Wolfensohn, chairman of Carnegie 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The standards Stern has adhered to through his long career have sustained, even 
enhanced, his passion for violin playing. 
</P>
<P>
"I adore it," he said in a recent interview. "I get more pleasure out of music 
than I ever did." 
</P>
<P>
The musicianship that evokes that pleasure is much admired by Stern's 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"Isaac is quite an extraordinary musician," violinist Itzhak Perlman said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was never part of any particular school of violin playing. He was his own 
school. As a player, he's an extreme individualist and yet, because his 
interpretations are always thought out, they seem logical. There's an eloquent 
simplicity to his music-making that makes it seem just right." 
</P>
<P>
Stern is known in the music world for his generosity to talented, younger 
musicians. They play for him. He offers suggestions. He becomes their 
advocates. 
</P>
<P>
Stern calls working with younger colleagues the most pleasurable aspect of his 
musical life. 
</P>
<P>
When Stern plays chamber music concerts with young musicians, "he insists the 
fees be split equally among all the performers, no matter how junior," Yo Yo Ma 
recently wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Stern said the life of a musician has changed unalterably during the course of 
his career. Speed of travel means that no corner of the globe is unreachable. 
</P>
<P>
What has stayed constant, Stern said, is the attention that must be paid to 
musical problems, to rethinking musical interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
"Music is the essential ingredient of a civilized life," he said. "It has 
nothing to do with the glitter of the occasional gala. You need it as you need 
bread."

ACTRESS PONDERING ROLE OF MOTHERHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VERNON SCOTT, UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ordinarily, you don't meet young women who look like Belinda Bauer and who are 
not actresses. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is beauty, a singularly marketable commodity for the screen. 
</P>
<P>
An Australian-born brunette, Bauer's gifts were evident to filmgoers in her 
small role in "Flashdance" several years ago and her co-starring role in this 
year's "Robocop II." 
</P>
<P>
She has completed a starring role in "Servants of Twilight," a thriller. 
</P>
<P>
So far, true stardom has eluded Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
In an industry where beauty may be only skin deep, it also is suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Still, unlike some women similarly endowed, Bauer is not impressed with her 
appearance. She is striving to develop acting skills, wise enough to know 
beauty fades; talent endures. 
</P>
<P>
During an interview, she was preoccupied with discussing her role as a single 
mother whose life is jeopardized in "Servants of Twilight," the film version of 
Dean R. Koontz's novel. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Bauer's scenes are with 8-year-old Jarrett Lennon Kaufman, who plays a 
6-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
"Working with a child opened up a whole new world to me," Belinda said. "I'd 
never played a mother. 
</P>
<P>
"There were days when I told myself I would never have a child. But I did tap 
into a maternal experience I didn't know I had. 
</P>
<P>
"I got in touch with my desire to nurture and protect a little creature, a 
little person. It would be an incredible thing to feel that love. 
</P>
<P>
"Jarrett and I became friends. His mother was at the studio every day, and I 
found myself feeling a bit competitive for his affection and attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I had very different ideas on how I would raise the child if he were mine. I 
didn't agree with his mother's choices. I was quite opinionated and told her I 
would do things differently. 
</P>
<P>
"She told me, quite rightly, that she was Jarrett's mother and that my comments 
were unappreciated. I learned a lesson, and we got along all right. I would 
have been less strict with him than his mother. 
</P>
<P>
"No offspring of mine would ever be a child actor. That's tricky because 
children do appear in movies, and someone has to play them. But I think it's 
hard on a kid. 
</P>
<P>
"Jarrett is a good actor and an intelligent kid. He didn't run wild too much 
and when he got tired he could be stubborn. It takes a little more time to work 
with a child, but he was very professional. 
</P>
<P>
"My experience makes me think it would be fascinating to have a son and a 
daughter, for totally different reasons. I would understand a little girl, and 
with a boy I would perhaps learn more about the male of the species. 
</P>
<P>
"At the moment I haven't a thought about who the father might be."
