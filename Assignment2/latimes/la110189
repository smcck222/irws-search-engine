Hungary's Parliament voted to hold a national referendum on when and how to 
elect someone to fill the new post of president. The lawmakers voted to hold 
the referendum Nov. 26, the date that had tentatively been chosen for a popular 
vote to select a president under an agreement signed by the ruling Socialist 
Party and most of the major opposition groups. Two opposition groups had 
opposed that agreement, however, and collected more than 200,000 signatures 
calling for a referendum on the method and timing of such elections. The groups 
want the president chosen by Parliament after the general elections, which are 
to be held by next June. If Hungarians vote in favor of electing a president 
before the parliamentary elections, the presidential balloting would be 
conducted Jan. 7.

A Palestinian was blown up in his boat off Lebanon and three sailors aboard an 
Israeli gunboat were slightly injured in what Jerusalem described as a suicide 
attack. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in Beirut claimed 
responsibility for the attack. It said the boat was on its way to carry out "a 
special mission" and claimed that the Israeli gunboat was sunk. Israeli 
military sources, however, said the gunboat, patrolling off Lebanon, asked the 
fishing boat to identify itself. Instead, the boat sailed toward the Israeli 
warship, then blew up, the Israelis said.

A federal drug agent watching a television program about unsolved crimes 
recognized an escaped murderer from a Florida prison as a man he arrested in 
San Diego on cocaine charges, authorities said. The agent called the television 
program's toll-free number and told a Florida Department of Law Enforcement 
officer that he had arrested fugitive Emilio Bravo under the alias Ernesto Cruz 
Gonzalez. Fingerprint checks confirmed that Cruz, who was arrested Sept. 22 in 
a federal sting operation, actually was one of Florida's most wanted fugitives, 
a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman said in San Diego. Bravo, 31, 
was in custody at the Metropolitan Correction Center in downtown San Diego on 
charges of conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to sell.

Voter Revolt says it has submitted 842,119 signatures in an attempt to qualify 
its multibillion-dollar property tax "split roll' initiative for the 1990 
statewide election ballot. Under the measure, business and residential 
properties would be placed on separate, or "split," tax rolls and the levy on 
businesses more than doubled, from 1% to 2.2%. County officials will verify the 
petitions to determine if there are the required 595,485 valid registered 
voters' signatures to earn the proposal a spot on the June ballot. Voter Revolt 
is the group that sponsored the 1988 insurance rate measure, Proposition 103. 
Business groups have long opposed efforts to tax their property at higher rates 
and have already begun organizing an opposition campaign.

Barbara Pater got more than she bargained for when she went to the Sonoma 
County Jail to visit accused mass murderer Ramon Salcido over the weekend. 
Pater, 28, who visits Salcido regularly, ended up as an inmate when she was 
arrested on a warrant issued for a misdemeanor hit-and-run offense. Sheriff's 
Sgt. Norman Hardin said Pater was booked after the warrant was served in the 
lobby of the jail in Santa Rosa. She was later released on $1,000 bail. Pater, 
who has said she wants to marry Salcido, has a record of fraud convictions and 
was involved in a minor traffic accident in mid-August when she was driving the 
1979 sedan Salcido used in his alleged April 14 murder rampage. Salcido is 
accused of killing his wife, two daughters, his mother-in-law, her two 
daughters and a co-worker.

ISRAELIS DROP EFFORTS TO CRUSH ARAB TAX REVOLT 
</P>

BEIT SAHUR, Israeli-Occupied West Bank 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israeli troops and tax officials withdrew from Beit Sahur on Tuesday, ending a 
near-siege that failed to crush a tax revolt. For six weeks, they had 
restricted access to Beit Sahur and confiscated household and industrial goods 
from defiant residents. 
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal ended one of the most unusual episodes of the Arab uprising. 
Beit Sahur, a middle-class community of 12,000 people at the edge of Bethlehem, 
was the first and only town in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to protest 
the occupation by resisting every form of Israeli taxation. 
</P>
<P>
The protest enraged Israeli officials, and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin vowed 
to "teach them a lesson." Israeli authorities forbade outsiders to enter, 
intercepted supplies of food, cut telephone lines, arrested dozens of tax 
resisters and, most recently, threatened to freeze the bank accounts of all 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Still, almost no one paid, despite raids on homes day and night and heated 
debate within the community about whether it would not be better to work out 
some sort of deal with the authorities. Complaints from church officials in 
Jerusalem and from Pope John Paul II in Rome -- Beit Sahur is largely Christian 
-- were mounting as the confrontation dragged on. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, as troops swept aside stone and sand roadblocks, residents 
celebrated by chanting, "Israelis, out!" and singing the Palestinian anthem, 
"My Homeland, My Homeland." 
</P>
<P>
Privately, residents were cautious, aware that the blockade could be restored 
at any time. 
</P>
<P>
"I am happy," said Raji Qumsiyeh, an upholsterer who lost his living room and 
dining room furniture and his television set to the tax men. "But the soldiers 
could come back in two days or two weeks. We don't know." 
</P>
<P>
The troops maintained a large encampment in fields next to the site where 
Christians believe angels announced the birth of Christ. As they pulled out 
Tuesday, a military communique announced that "tax collection and law and order 
will continue . . . in the future as planned." 
</P>
<P>
Army officials sought to put the best face on the decision to withdraw. They 
said that $1.5 million worth of goods had been taken from more than 300 
families, and they expressed satisfaction that no other town had taken up Beit 
Sahur's cry of "no taxation without representation." 
</P>
<P>
Brig. Gen. Shaike Erez, military governor of the West Bank, told Israel Radio 
that he was "convinced the tax rebellion is broken." 
</P>
<P>
The dispute put Israel in an awkward position. The troops were not dealing with 
people throwing stones or gasoline bombs but with people who folded their arms 
in passive resistance. And closing the town to outsiders recalled uncomfortable 
images of the repression of Jews in Europe. During the tax raids, soldiers 
tried to bar reporters, members of the Parliament and clergymen from entering 
the town. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli critics of the situation saw it not as a question of tax collection but 
of authority. 
</P>
<P>
"The nature of what happened was a contest over who is the sovereign in Beit 
Sahur," commented Dedi Zucker, a leftist member of Parliament. "It hasn't been 
proved that Israel is the real sovereign in Beit Sahur." 
</P>
<P>
In the more than 22 months of the uprising against Israeli rule, Palestinians 
have reduced their tax payments by an estimated 50% or more. Last spring, the 
government curtailed health benefits and sought to justify the measure on 
grounds that the Palestinians were withholding taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Although Beit Sahur became something of a symbol abroad, it is not at all clear 
that its example will be followed by others. As a matter of rebel policy, many 
towns in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have decided that some taxes should be 
paid in order to keep the struggling economy afloat. 
</P>
<P>
In Nablus, considered the most militant of West Bank towns, factory owners and 
farmers are encouraged to pay taxes to keep up employment and exports. 
Exporters cannot send goods abroad without the permission of the Israeli 
government. 
</P>
<P>
In Bethlehem, many merchants pay taxes to keep the town open to tourists. 
</P>
<P>
In Beit Sahur, there was a deep division, along generational lines, over the 
wisdom of holding out. Mayor Hanna Atrash tried to negotiate a truce with the 
military authorities so that residents would have time to reconsider. But young 
activists held out for a total strike. They burned the car of a resident who 
went to pay his taxes in an effort to keep soldiers from confiscating goods 
from his pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
Activists in Gaza and Nablus were heard to grumble about the attention received 
by the town for losing television sets and stereo equipment while elsewhere, 
the toll of dead mounted daily at the hands of Israeli soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Other places are caught up in intra-Arab violence, with Palestinian militants 
killing suspected collaborators. On Tuesday in the Khan Yunis refugee camp in 
Gaza, masked youths hacked to death a nurse who worked at a local hospital. She 
was accused of giving the names of wounded activists to Israeli agents. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, five masked attackers stabbed a nurse to death at the same hospital. 
They painted slogans on a wall accusing the victim of collaborating with 
Israeli security forces. 
</P>
<P>
More than 125 Palestinians have been killed by other Palestinians since the 
uprising began. Israeli soldiers have killed about 600 Arabs.

BUSH, GORBACHEV WILL MEET AT SEA FOR INFORMAL TALKS; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: THE MEDITERRANEAN MEETING DEC.2-3 IS EXPECTED TO CLEAR THE WAY FOR 
AN ARMS SUMMIT IN 1990.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will meet aboard U.S. 
and Soviet naval ships in the Mediterranean on Dec. 2 and 3 for an 
unstructured, informal conference intended to pave the way for next year's arms 
control summit. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, announced simultaneously on Tuesday by Bush at the White House and 
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in Moscow, will be the first 
between the two presidents since Bush took office last January. 
</P>
<P>
It will offer the two leaders "a chance to put our feet up and talk," Bush 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze, while also saying the session will be relaxed, added that it 
should "contribute to broadening the changes taking place in the 
Soviet-American relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Occurring at a time of dramatic ferment in the once-monolithic Soviet Bloc of 
Eastern Europe, the shipboard sessions are likely to focus on the pressure for 
economic and political reforms in the Soviet Union and Eastern and Central 
Europe, as well as on the continuing turmoil in Central America and 
Afghanistan, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
However, with Bush and Gorbachev planning to meet in a formal summit conference 
in late spring or early summer next year, the White House saw little chance 
that arms control would be given a central role next month. Rather, by focusing 
on other matters, the two leaders will free up the agenda for their next 
meeting, which will deal with weapons reductions, particularly long-range 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The warships have not yet been chosen, nor has a decision been made on whether 
they will be cruising in international waters or tied up in port for the 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Cracked one Pentagon official: "I'm trying to get the Love Boat into the 
Mediterranean." 
</P>
<P>
More likely, officials said, are two similar cruisers, stationed perhaps off 
Naples, the home port of the U.S. 6th Fleet, or, one official said, near Spain. 
Gorbachev is scheduled to be in Rome, making the first visit of a Soviet leader 
to the Vatican, just before he meets Bush. 
</P>
<P>
A high-visibility superpower conference offers unique political opportunities 
for both Bush, who has been criticized for failing to respond to dramatic 
changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and for Gorbachev, who has been 
juggling to meet consumer demands while fending off critics of his twin reform 
programs, glasnost and perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
Bush can demonstrate a willingness to engage in superpower politics and can 
encourage and assist the long-sought shifts in the Soviet Union. Gorbachev can 
return home with a show of acceptance from the United States and, possibly, a 
renewed commitment to arms control that could eventually help him divert 
precious rubles from military to domestic spending. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you have a President (of the United States) meeting with a president 
of the Soviet Union, as a catalyst to an arms control summit, it's a plus," 
said one Administration official. "The American people like to see it. There's 
no downside to it. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time there's dialogue, it puts people in a good frame of mind," the 
official said. "There's a feel-good thing about it. This has a rolling effect. 
It's not just a media event here or in the Soviet Union. It has an 
international feel to it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Soviets Impatient 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, officials were growing impatient with the delays in resuming arms 
control negotiations after Bush took office, said Stephen Cohen, director of 
Russian studies and professor of politics at Princeton University. "They'd 
begun to refer to the Administration as 'the long pause,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
A renewal of the superpower dialogue will allow Gorbachev to "prove once again 
to his people that he can bring a recalcitrant American President to a 
meeting," said Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said: "Our talks will be informal in character, designed to allow us to 
become better acquainted with one another and to deepen our respective 
understanding of each other's views. Neither President Gorbachev nor I 
anticipate that substantial decisions or agreements will emerge." 
</P>
<P>
Bush played down the prospects for measurable progress, telling reporters at a 
White House news conference: "There's not going to be an agenda or meeting 
(that) could be seen to fail or succeed on whether we make agreements" on U.S. 
aid for the struggling Soviet economy. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not what this meeting is about. . . . There's nothing off the table, 
nothing on it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
What if Gorbachev springs a new arms control proposal on him? 
</P>
<P>
"He's free to bring anything he wants," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
"The meeting is not being set up to achieve agreements. I would hope we'd see 
eye to eye on certain things when we get through, and maybe more narrowly 
define, more precisely define, what differences we have," Bush said. He added: 
</P>
<P>
"We'll simply sit down, and I'll give (him) my views on the changes that are 
taking place in Eastern Europe, and certainly I'm most interested in getting 
his." 
</P>
<P>
The President took pains to portray the meeting in less-than-dramatic terms, 
insisting that it would not be a summit conference. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to make that point over and over again," he said. " 'Summits' take on 
a definition, an expectation of grand design and grand agreements, and that's 
not what this is." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Secret Talks 
</P>
<P>
In late August, as initial, secret U.S.-Soviet discussions of a meeting were 
under way, senior U.S. officials argued that barring an unforeseen 
international agreement of some sort, the time was not right for Bush and 
Gorbachev to meet. They said a conference without concrete results could be 
read as a failure. But, they acknowledged, the failure of the two leaders to 
meet over the course of an entire year would also bring risks. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Bush has been anxious to establish a personal relationship 
with Gorbachev, even though he and his aides said for months that they did not 
want a meeting just for the sake of getting acquainted. He last met Gorbachev 
on Dec. 7, 1988, when the Soviet leader visited New York to address the U.N. 
General Assembly. Bush was then President-elect and Ronald Reagan was 
President. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you what changed my mind -- it was consultation with our allies, the 
rapidity of change in Eastern Europe, the emergence of democracies in this 
hemisphere, and this concept that I just didn't want to, in this time of 
dynamic change, miss something, something that I might get better firsthand 
from Mr. Gorbachev," Bush said of the shift in his approach. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to have two gigantic ships pass in the night because of failed 
communication," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to senior Administration officials, the genesis of the meeting was in 
the President's visit in July to Poland and Hungary, when officials there 
encouraged him to meet Gorbachev and express his support for the reforms in 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
On July 19, Bush penned a note to Gorbachev, proposing an informal meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev replied "immediately and enthusiastically . . . (that) this was a 
good idea," Bush said. The formal Soviet response reached Washington in early 
August, setting off an exchange of letters between the two leaders and 
discussions by their senior aides of possible dates, places and informal agenda 
items. A final agreement came in early October. 
</P>
<P>
Several officials said it was Bush's idea that the leaders meet on ships in the 
Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
A non-summit-at-sea can be accomplished "without too much fanfare. . . . 
There's a relatively few number of people," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
KEY ISSUES IN CURRENT U.S.-SOVIET RELATIONS 
</P>
<P>
 President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev will have a lot to talk 
about when they meet in December. The 10 months since they last met have been 
filled with "dynamic change" in Eastern Europe, Central America and the Soviet 
Union itself, as Bush noted. Here are some of the likely topics: 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Economy 
</P>
<P>
What are Gorbachev's plans for coping with his nation's severe economic 
problems? His ability to deal with increasing consumer demands and sagging 
industrial production is seen as central to his political survival. But whether 
Washington should help bail him out is a major policy debate. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Europe 
</P>
<P>
Bush hopes to determine how much Gorbachev will be encouraging reform 
throughout the region or whether he will swing toward those trying to put on 
the brakes. Bush also is trying to clarify at what point active U.S. support 
for democratic changes would produce a Soviet backlash. Washington has approved 
aid to reform-minded Poland and Hungary but not to hard-line East Germany, 
which is racked by nearly daily pro-democracy demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Arms Control 
</P>
<P>
Bush said there will be no detailed talks on this issue. But the leaders are 
expected to review conventional forces and long-range missiles. Those issues 
will be the focus of next year's formal superpower summit in Washington. The 
Warsaw Pact, led by the Soviets, has made new proposals on verifying cuts in 
conventional arms in Europe. Gorbachev last week offered to pull nuclear-armed 
submarines from the Baltic Sea in a step toward a "nuclear-free" Europe; at 
right are some of the affected nations. 
</P>
<P>
Central America and Afghanistan 
</P>
<P>
The United States has complained repeatedly about East Bloc arms shipments to 
Nicaragua and the transfer of weapons from there to El Salvador's leftist

to become a peace broker in the region. In Afghanistan, the Soviets have been 
protesting U.S. military aid for the Muslim rebels attempting to overthrow the 
pro-Soviet government.

Federal officials said Tuesday that they will need to borrow an additional $50 
billion to $100 billion to dispose of crippled savings and loan associations, 
far more than the $50 billion approved by Congress in August. 
</P>
<P>
The funds will be needed as working capital by the Resolution Trust Corp., the 
agency dismantling crippled S&amp;Ls, to provide cash to pay off depositors at 
hundreds of defunct institutions. Officials said they need more money because a 
greater number of failing S&amp;Ls will require government action, and it is 
not known how much money can be recovered by selling those institutions' 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
The estimate offered Tuesday goes far beyond anything expected by members of 
Congress when they passed the landmark legislation rescuing the federal 
insurance fund that guarantees S&amp;L deposits of up to $100,000. Federal 
officials subsequently had said more money would be needed, but no one had 
suggested a figure as high as $100 billion until now. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L bailout law permitted the Resolution Trust Corp. to borrow funds by 
using seized assets of S&amp;Ls as collateral, but the huge size of projected 
borrowings surprised and irritated members of Congress at Tuesday's hearing 
before a House Ways and Means oversight subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
L. William Seidman, Resolution Trust Corp. chairman, said that his agency will 
need to borrow between $50 billion and $100 billion, a broad range reflecting 
the uncertain recovery value of S&amp;L real estate assets. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman disclosed also that officials have identified 223 additional troubled 
S&amp;Ls, with assets of $164 billion, as likely candidates for federal 
takeover in the next three years. The agency already has seized 283 
institutions with $112 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
After closing some institutions and selling the healthy mortgages and assets to 
other S&amp;Ls, the trust corporation will inherit 200,000 pieces of property, 
including condominiums, single-family homes, office buildings, shopping 
centers, raw land and assorted other real estate foreclosed on when loans went 
bad. 
</P>
<P>
The agency needs huge sums of cash in the short term to close S&amp;Ls and pay 
off depositors, and it will not recover money until the sale of foreclosed 
properties months or years later. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman's statements met with immediate skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
"You say to the American people you need $50 billion to $100 billion, but you 
do not have a plan" to raise the money, said Rep. J. J. Pickle (D-Tex.), 
chairman of the oversight subcommittee. "You leave yourself a lot of running 
room," Pickle told Seidman. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of plans; we haven't decided which one we will use," Seidman 
replied. 
</P>
<P>
The cheapest way to raise working capital would be direct borrowing by the 
Resolution Trust Corp. from the Treasury, Seidman said in response to 
questions. But another witness, Assistant Treasury Secretary David W. Mullins 
Jr., opposed this route, saying it would increase the federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman said federal officials are considering creation of a "resolution bank." 
It might package the foreclosed assets of the S&amp;Ls and market them as 
securities to raise money. Or the bank could issue "junk bonds" with high 
interest rates, with S&amp;L assets as collateral for the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
A skeptical Pickle said Congress does not "want to see unlimited borrowing to 
commit the full faith and credit of the federal government." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Pete Stark (D-Oakland) said: "Nobody has the information (about the value 
of foreclosed assets.) Nobody knows what it's worth." He told Seidman: "You 
want a blank check to put a federal guarantee behind those assets. That's 
absolutely irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
Stark, Pickle and other members of Congress are promoting legislation to forbid 
unauthorized borrowing by new agencies such as the Resolution Trust Corp. Stark 
took his seat as a subcommittee member at the start of Tuesday's hearing, then 
stepped down to the witness table to speak for his bill. If the corporation 
needs billions of dollars in working capital, he said, "the Administration 
should document this need, propose a plan to raise this capital and present the 
plan to Congress for specific legislative approval." 
</P>
<P>
To permit "this massive level of unfettered federal borrowing without prior 
congressional approval would be irresponsible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman said after the hearing that borrowing by the Resolution Trust Corp. "is 
simply an issue some members hadn't focused on." He said the agency could not 
provide a more precise estimate than $50 billion to $100 billion because "we're 
talking about institutions we haven't received yet. We haven't been into them 
yet; we don't know what the assets are." 
</P>
<P>
The Oversight Board, which sets policy for the trust corporation, issued a 
preliminary draft Tuesday of its strategic plan, inviting public comment on the 
best ways to dispose of crippled S&amp;Ls. The agency should sell S&amp;L 
assets with minimal "impact on local real estate and financial markets" and 
should emphasize the "availability and affordability of residential property 
for low- and moderate-income individuals," the board said in its 77-page plan. 
</P>
<P>
The board invited public comments for 30 days and said the final plan will be 
submitted to Congress by Dec. 31. Board members include Treasury Secretary 
Nicholas F. Brady, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp and 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.

PRESSURE OF EVENTS FORCED SEA CHANGE IN BUSH POLICY 
</P>

President Bush's announcement that he will meet informally with Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev next month marks a sea change in his response to 
the historic upheavals sweeping the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe: After 
repeatedly rejecting pressure to embrace Gorbachev and his reforms, Bush is now 
doing exactly that. 
</P>
<P>
And the change springs less from an altered view of Gorbachev and the Soviet 
Bloc than from the irresistible pressure of onrushing events. 
</P>
<P>
Bush entered the White House proclaiming a need for "caution and prudence," 
determined to slow down the rapid pace of U.S.-Soviet rapprochement begun by 
President Ronald Reagan. He recoiled from any suggestion of an early meeting 
with Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
But within months, he found himself facing a tide of pressure to respond to the 
startling changes in the Soviet Bloc. There were increasing demands both at 
home and from U.S. allies in Western Europe for a more imaginative policy. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, Bush began to bend. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one time when I felt that such a meeting wouldn't be productive," 
the President acknowledged in his news conference on Tuesday. " . . . What 
changed my mind on it was consultation with our allies; the rapidity of change 
in Eastern Europe; the emergence of democracies in this hemisphere, and this 
concept that I just didn't want to, in this time of dynamic change, miss 
something -- something that I might get better firsthand from Mr. Gorbachev." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's Administration is still divided over Gorbachev's chances of ultimate 
success, with most senior officials privately pessimistic about how far the 
Soviet reform program known as perestroika is likely to go. But after months of 
internal debate, aides say, they have largely agreed that the United States has 
no choice but to meet the Soviet leader and take a direct role in supporting 
reform in the Communist Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a case of looking and seeing profound change taking place," a senior 
Administration official said. "It's important not to be seen as sitting back 
and watching that take place." 
</P>
<P>
"We've known all along what we wanted to do, in general terms," he said. "But a 
lot of things have happened" since Bush took office in January. 
</P>
<P>
Among those changes, officials pointed out: 
</P>
<P>
* Accelerated political reform in the Soviet Union, along with a deepening 
economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
* The election of a non-Communist government in Poland, led by the Solidarity 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
* The decision by Hungary's ruling Communist Party to turn the country into a 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
* Gorbachev's role in urging more reform on his Soviet Bloc allies, including 
hard-line East Germany and Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev has passed several tests with flying colors, most importantly in 
Eastern Europe, where the Cold War began," said Dmitri Simes, a Sovietologist 
at Washington's Brookings Institution. "His actions have demonstrated that his 
declarations of 'new thinking' in Soviet policy are real. . . . The 
Administration recognizes that. This (Bush-Gorbachev) meeting will establish 
the U.S. commitment to change in the Soviet Union. It is a way for the 
Administration to show faith in Gorbachev." 
</P>
<P>
It is also a way for the Administration to score "a very easy foreign policy 
success," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the political payoff for Bush's move was immediate. Both Democrats and 
Republicans in Congress applauded his announcement, and this included some who 
have spent months criticizing Bush as "timid" in his approach to the changes in 
the Soviet Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
"I commend the President for this step," said Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.), one of the most persistent critics. "I think it will be 
useful." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the meeting had changed his judgment of Bush, however, Mitchell 
added: "No, the mere fact they are meeting doesn't deal with the substance of 
policies." 
</P>
<P>
But other analysts -- and some Administration officials, speaking on condition 
that they not be identified -- said there has been a series of significant 
shifts in Bush's policy. 
</P>
<P>
When Bush entered the White House, he demanded that Gorbachev prove that his 
new approach to Soviet foreign policy was genuine, calling repeatedly for 
"actions as well as words." And some officials, like Deputy National Security 
Adviser Robert M. Gates, warned that it was dangerous to change U.S. policy in 
response to Gorbachev's reforms because the Soviet leader might soon fail. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Bush aides have been convinced, as one said, "that Gorbachev is 
real." In Eastern Europe especially, he said, the Soviets' commitment to reform 
has surprised American policy-makers: "They have demonstrated a tolerance level 
that exceeded our expectations." 
</P>
<P>
The second issue was more problematic: Should Bush stick to his cautious 
position because of concerns that Gorbachev's reforms may fail? That question 
divided the President's advisers -- but not his Western European allies, the 
Eastern European reformers or a growing body of U.S. critics, all of whom 
argued for a greater American role in aiding reform in the Soviet Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
As the pressure to act increased, Bush and his advisers agreed on a new 
posture: a still-cautious, but more active, search for what Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III called "points of mutual advantage" with the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be (a) great blunder to ignore the possibility that perestroika might 
go much further and to retreat instead into a suspicious stance of 
disengagement that would never put perestroika's promise to the test," Baker 
said in a major speech on Soviet policy last month. 
</P>
<P>
"Any uncertainty about the fate of reform in the Soviet Union . . . is all the 
more reason, not less, for us to seize the present opportunity," he argued. 
</P>
<P>
That was "a crucial change," said Arnold Horelick of the RAND Corp. in Santa 
Monica. "Bush's new look started in the spring, largely under pressure from the 
allies. It was pushed by changes in the Soviet Union and accelerated by events 
in Eastern Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Baker's speech "ended the argument" that instability in the Soviet Union should 
lead to more caution in Washington, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another major factor, Administration officials said, was the increasing need 
for high-level U.S.-Soviet talks over the future of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Bush and Baker rejected suggestions for such a discussion because it 
might appear to legitimize Soviet involvement in determining the political 
limits in Poland and Hungary. But as it has become clear that the Soviets 
"don't have a formula for Eastern Europe," one official said, it became more 
desirable for the two sides "to discuss their concerns directly." 
</P>
<P>
"There's a need for mutual reassurance," Horelick noted. "Bush can reassure 
Gorbachev that he has no intention of seeking unilateral advantage (in the 
instability in Eastern Europe), and Gorbachev can reassure Bush of his 
new-found tolerance." 
</P>
<P>
There was one more factor in the Administration's changing view, officials 
said: the frustration of George Bush himself, a man who likes to pick up the 
telephone and talk to the heads of other governments. 
</P>
<P>
"He does put a high store in personal diplomacy," a senior official said. "He 
clearly felt . . . that it was too long a time for him to wait to meet 
Gorbachev as president."

The White House helped 500 local schoolchildren celebrate Halloween on Tuesday, 
and along with the treats the youngsters got an admonition from President Bush 
to beware of something truly scary -- illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and his wife, Barbara, emerged through the mouth of a 15-foot 
jack-o-lantern erected over the staid diplomatic entrance of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the White House collected pledge cards from the children 
forswearing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"You know they say that there's a ghost in this old house, and the most famous 
one is Abraham Lincoln," Bush told the children. 
</P>
<P>
"Barbara and I haven't seen the ghost of Abraham Lincoln walking the halls, but 
this is our first Halloween in the White House, so maybe we'll see him 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
The President added: "Halloween is a time for ghosts and goblins, for haunted 
houses and scary stories." But there is one "scary story that isn't 
make-believe. You know what I'm talking about . . . illegal drugs and how they 
hurt people, how they hurt families, hurt kids, some of them just like you."

FIRE RAMPANT IN DETROIT FOR DEVIL'S NIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
ARSON: DESPITE A CRACKDOWN, HUNDREDS OF HOMES AND ABANDONED BUILDINGS ARE 
TORCHED.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Firefighters got some relief Tuesday night when an outbreak of arson declined, 
a day after a massive anti-crime effort by an estimated 30,000 firefighters, 
police officers and volunteers failed to prevent hundreds of houses and 
abandoned buildings from being set ablaze throughout Detroit during the annual 
Devil's Night arson spree. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-one juveniles were arrested for ignoring a curfew Tuesday, the last night 
in the three-day arson outbreak that left at least 10 families homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Every year on the night before Halloween, Detroit's poorest neighborhoods gird 
for arson attacks. This year's seem to have been particularly bad, despite an 
outpouring of citizen involvement in an effort to stamp out the practice. 
</P>
<P>
Although official figures weren't available Tuesday, it appeared that roughly 
twice as many fires were set as during the same time period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Unofficial estimates placed the total for both Sunday and Monday at 460; by 
contrast, Detroit officials said that in 1988 the city counted 229 fires in a 
three-day period from Oct. 29 through Oct. 31. Few fires were reported Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
In a normal 24-hour period, the Detroit Fire Department responds to about 65 
fires, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Berg, a spokesman for Mayor Coleman Young, said the fire count "may be a 
bit more" than in 1988 but that city officials were still sifting through 
reports to develop an official count. 
</P>
<P>
The fires raged in spite of a 6 p.m. curfew for juveniles. The 51 arrests 
Tuesday brought the three-day arrest total to 385, Detroit police officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Devil's Night arson first became a major problem for Detroit in 1983, when 650 
fires were reported, as vacant buildings throughout the city were torched. 
After the 1984 Devil's Night, when the arson spree peaked at 810 fires, city 
officials mounted a massive campaign to curb the destruction in subsequent 
years. It had been largely successful in reducing the arson each year, until 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
The troubling increase in Devil's Night arson occurs in the midst of a mayoral 
election campaign in Detroit that pits Young, a 16-year incumbent seeking an 
unprecedented fifth term, against Tom Barrow, a politically inexperienced 
businessman and nephew of boxing great Joe Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Barrow, who won the right to challenge Young by defeating several better-known 
candidates in a September primary, was quick to criticize the mayor's handling 
of the arson crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Barrow charged that the rise in Devil's Night fires represented a "failure of 
leadership" by Young. He added that Young is a "weak role model for Detroit's 
youth, who have challenged his leadership of the streets by setting Devil's 
Night fires and defying the curfew." 
</P>
<P>
But the arson spree is unlikely to change the outcome of next Tuesday's 
election, which Young is widely expected to win. 
</P>
<P>
Most political analysts here believed that the only serious challenge to Young 
could have come from Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), who entered the race at 
the last minute, ran a poorly organized campaign and then turned in an 
embarrassing third-place finish in the September primary.

Specialists have linked a terrorist bomb that destroyed a French airliner in 
Africa, killing 171 people, to a Palestinian group allied with the pro-Iranian, 
Lebanese-based organization called Hezbollah, the French newspaper Figaro said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Working with fragments of a suitcase found in the wreckage of the airliner that 
exploded over the desert in Niger on Sept. 19, specialists in Paris' central 
police laboratory found similarities to a terrorist bomb that exploded at a 
Paris department store almost five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The February, 1985, attack at the department store resulted in the arrest of 
Habib Maammar, a Tunisian member of a group directed by the Palestinian bomb 
maker Abu Ibrahim. He is now said to be working for the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, 
or Party of God. 
</P>
<P>
The police prefect in Paris, Pierre Verbrugghe, refused to comment on the 
newspaper report. 
</P>
<P>
The purported connection is important for American authorities investigating 
the December, 1988, terrorist bombing of a Pan American World Airways jetliner 
over Lockerbie, Scotland. There are parallels between the two. 
</P>
<P>
Many experts believe that Abu Ibrahim, who is also known as Hussein Humari, is 
in retirement in Baghdad and no longer affiliated with any terrorist 
organization. They say the bombs involved in these incidents were likely 
fabricated by one of several people taught by Abu Ibrahim. 
</P>
<P>
Thus the most that can be said of the French investigators' work is that it 
excludes several groups, notably the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command, which use different bomb-making techniques. 
</P>
<P>
An informed source said Tuesday that "the French have made a very important 
forensic discovery that clearly points away from some groups, but whether it 
points to someone is uncertain." 
</P>
<P>
This, he said, leaves open the possibility that the attacks have been 
contracted for by one of several groups, including pro-Iranian, pro-Libyan and 
pro-Syrian organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Figaro said the police technicians have determined that the bomb that destroyed 
the French airliner was placed in a small Samsonite suitcase lined with thin 
strips of a plastic explosive called penthrite. When Habib Maammar was arrested 
in connection with the Paris bombing, police found a similarly treated 
briefcase at the home of his girlfriend in the French city of Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
Maammar, who is to go on trial in December, has allegedly told a French 
magistrate that on visits to the Middle East, he sometimes received briefcases 
from Abu Ibrahim. 
</P>
<P>
According to police sources, the bomb that destroyed the French airliner was 
detonated by a quartz alarm clock or wristwatch set to go off four or five 
hours after the suitcase was loaded in Brazzaville, Congo, and before a stop in 
Chad on the way to Paris. 
</P>
<P>
French sources say the Hezbollah movement is firmly established in several 
French-speaking African countries with sizable Lebanese populations.

Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, in a meeting Tuesday with former President 
Richard M. Nixon, accused the United States of deep involvement in last 
spring's pro-democracy protest in Beijing, the official New China News Agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Deng insisted that it is up to the United States, not China, to take the first 
steps toward restoring more friendly relations. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly speaking, the United States was involved too deeply in the turmoil and 
counterrevolutionary rebellion which occurred in Beijing not long ago," Deng 
reportedly told Nixon in a 95-minute meeting at the Great Hall of the People. 
"China was the real victim, and it is unjust to reprove China for it. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that China and the United States will solve as soon as possible the 
problems in their relations and will create a sound basis on which to promote 
future ties. However, it is up to the United States to take the initiative." 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear whether Deng's words were intended primarily for 
domestic consumption or whether they might mark a further deterioration in 
Sino-U.S. relations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Envoys Harassed 
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, there has been a marked increase in harassment of U.S. 
diplomats in Beijing. A few paramilitary policemen armed with semiautomatic 
weapons have stood guard outside the main U.S. Embassy compound and Ambassador 
James R. Lilley's residence all summer and fall. In one of the compounds, the 
United States is providing refuge to China's most prominent dissident, the 
astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Since late last week, the guard has been increased by a dozen or more 
additional Chinese, some in uniform and some in civilian clothes, who stand 
near the entrances and cast unfriendly looks at visitors. 
</P>
<P>
An unidentified U.S. diplomat told the Associated Press that twice in the past 
week, paramilitary guards have pointed automatic weapons at children of U.S. 
diplomats and pulled the trigger. In neither case was the gun loaded. 
</P>
<P>
In seven other recent incidents, tires have been slashed on the cars of U.S. 
diplomats, and the headlights turned on so as to discharge the batteries, the 
diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
The embassy has protested verbally to the Chinese government three times since 
late last week. 
</P>
<P>
Since mid-June, Chinese media have used edited videotapes and misleading 
publications to portray the massacre on the night of last June 3-4 as a 
response to -- rather than the cause of -- the rioting that took place in 
Beijing the following day. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of students and other 
people were killed when the army shot its way into Beijing in the pre-dawn 
hours of June 4 to retake control of Tian An Men Square from student 
demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon, in his comments to Deng, warned the 85-year-old leader that in the 17 
years since his 1972 visit to Beijing, "there has never been a more difficult 
crisis" in relations between the United States and China. He warned Deng that 
many Americans with long records of friendship are turning against his 
government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Friends Concerned 
</P>
<P>
"This time the concerns developed not from those who are foes of China but from 
those who are friends of China," Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
Something must be done, he said, to "repair the damage that has been done to 
the respect in the United States among China's friends for some of China's 
leaders." 
</P>
<P>
Deng appeared to dismiss such concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"We can never forget state sovereignty and national honor," he was quoted as 
saying, "nor can we do away with national self-respect. China will not allow 
any country to interfere in its internal affairs." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon met later in the day with Jiang Zemin, who in late June replaced Zhao 
Ziyang as general secretary of the Communist Party. The news agency said Jiang 
"reassured Nixon that the opened door of China will not be closed again." 
</P>
<P>
"We will not just pay lip service to upholding reform and the open policy," 
Jiang said, "but we will also take down-to-earth steps, including the 
implementation of certain major projects and the improvement of relevant laws 
and regulations." 
</P>
<P>
Although martial law remains in effect in Beijing, steps are being taken to 
make it less visible, partly in an attempt to encourage foreigners to return. 
Armed soldiers who had stood guard at major intersections and highway 
overpasses for more than four months have now been withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
In a special military ceremony held shortly before midnight Tuesday, the 
helmeted soldiers who guarded Tian An Men Square with rifles were replaced by 
less intimidating paramilitary officers, who wear cloth hats and carry only 
pistols.

SULLIVAN WON'T RULE ON FETAL TISSUE RESEARCH BAN 
</P>

Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan has declined to rule on 
whether to extend the government's controversial ban on fetal-tissue research, 
an unexpected action that places responsibility for the decision with a lower 
official known to favor continuing the ban, health officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Federal scientists have been prohibited from using fetal tissue in research for 
more than a year, since Ronald Reagan Administration officials rejected use of 
tissue transplanted from aborted fetuses as inappropriate for medical research. 
</P>
<P>
Since the initial ban, the issue -- emotionally intertwined with attitudes 
about abortion itself -- has become one of the most politically divisive in 
modern medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists say fetal-tissue research holds great promise for treating several 
now-incurable diseases. Because fetal tissue grows so quickly and adapts to new 
environments much more easily than adult tissue, researchers see potential for 
it in research on AIDS, Parkinson's disease and several other areas. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists employed by the National Institutes of Health are now prohibited 
from using the tissue in their research, one of the few examples in modern 
times of a political prohibition on scientific research that most experts 
consider important. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, after intense debate, a special advisory committee to the NIH 
concluded that "without taking a position on the morality of abortion in 
general," using tissue from aborted fetuses was "acceptable" and recommended 
that it be allowed to resume. 
</P>
<P>
"With the safeguards the NIH panel recommended to us, there was no reason not 
to permit the tissue to be used in research," said Robert E. Windom, former 
assistant secretary for health, who imposed the moratorium in 1988 and 
established the special panel that recommended lifting it. "We realized nobody 
was going to get pregnant for the purpose of selling their tissue or giving it 
away." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan's long-awaited decision was imminent. While many researchers expected 
him to continue the ban, virtually all assumed he would make the ruling 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Responsibility for enforcing the moratorium now rests with James O. Mason, 
assistant secretary for health. An opponent of abortion, he had recommended to 
Sullivan that the ban continue, Administration officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
Mason declined to comment Tuesday on the decision, and Sullivan was not 
available, press spokesmen for the Public Health Service said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's terribly sad," said Kenneth Ryan, chairman of the obstetrics and 
gynecology department at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard 
Medical School, who was on the panel appointed by Windom last year. "If I or 
some other scientist cries out about it, people say we are just being 
self-serving. But it is clearly the direction they wanted to go." 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that the agency has become paralyzed by fear of the abortion 
issue," said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House 
subcommittee on health and the environment, which has jurisdiction over the 
Public Health Service. "By doing nothing at all, Dr. Sullivan is trying to 
offend no one. But he has offended everyone with his hesitancy and lack of 
dedication."

SPECIAL SENATE PANEL APPOINTED TO INVESTIGATE SCANDALS AT HUD

<P>
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee named a special panel Tuesday to 
investigate the multibillion-dollar scandals at the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development, just as a House probe is winding down. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.) was named chairman of the new Special Investigations 
Subcommittee by Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), chairman of the banking 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Graham said no decision had been made on whether the panel would seek testimony 
from former HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr., who has refused to testify 
before a House investigative panel on constitutional grounds of 
self-incrimination, or three of his former aides who also have refused to 
testify. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to make sure our housing program doesn't get sacked again," Graham 
said. "Working with our colleagues in the House, we'll establish causes for the 
breakdown at HUD and propose corrective legislation." 
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the House subcommittee, Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), said 
last week after Pierce's second refusal to testify that his panel was about to 
wrap up the hearings it began last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Graham said Lantos "has been very generous in his offer to assist us" in 
pursuing the investigation and finding legislative remedies for the influence 
peddling, fraud and mismanagement that HUD Secretary Jack Kemp has acknowledged 
he found at the department. 
</P>
<P>
Graham presided over a hearing by the full banking committee on the HUD 
scandal, in which two former Reagan White House officials denied that they had 
exerted any influence on behalf of specific projects seeking HUD grants. 
</P>
<P>
A third witness, William M. Diefenderfer III, deputy director of the Office of 
Management and Budget, acknowledged that "a massive failure of collective 
oversight responsibilities, which includes OMB," was responsible for the HUD 
scandals.

FDA DELAYS RED DYE NO. 3 RULING

The Food and Drug Administration, waiting for direction from Congress, on 
Tuesday extended its deadline for deciding whether to ban Red Dye No. 3 in 
foods, drugs and cosmetics on the grounds that it causes cancer. 
</P>
<P>
This extension pushes the deadline to Jan. 29, 1990. It had been today. There 
have been dozens of previous extensions in the 19-year-old controversy. 
</P>
<P>
The agency had been prepared to ban the dye when the House voted in July to 
require further studies before deciding on a ban. But, last month, House and 
Senate negotiators deadlocked over the issue and decided to give the FDA 
conflicting advice. 
</P>
<P>
House conferees stood fast on their wish to see more studies, while Senate 
conferees agreed that the FDA should follow existing law in deciding whether 
the dye should be banned. Both positions were included in an appropriations 
bill, which is still being hashed out in a conference committee.

FDA PLANS TO CURB FOOD HEALTH CLAIMS; 
</P>
<P>
REGULATION: CRITICS SAY NO RULES EXIST TO STOP MISLEADING MESSAGES ON CEREAL 
AND MARGARINE LABELS. A 1987 POLICY CHANGE IS BLAMED.

<P>
Food and Drug Administration officials admitted Tuesday that efforts to 
regulate health benefit claims on food labels by manufacturers have been 
deficient. 
</P>
<P>
FDA Commissioner Frank Young, testifying at a House Government Operations 
subcommittee, said that, in order to combat the proliferation of deceptive and 
misleading packaging, "small and immediate fixes" were needed on a 1987 policy 
change that enabled food manufacturers to make disease-prevention claims on 
food labels. 
</P>
<P>
The change in policy occurred after lawmakers and industry executives had 
agreed that food manufacturers should include some health information on their 
packages to help promote healthful diets, but there has been little agreement 
about what claims are scientifically sound enough to be displayed on packages. 
</P>
<P>
Young said the FDA has identified five areas where claims might be appropriate. 
These would deal with the links between calcium and osteoporosis, sodium and 
high blood pressure, fats and heart disease, fats and cancer and fiber and 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
During the last two years, numerous products, including breakfast cereals, 
margarine and even doughnuts, have published claims that their contents are 
able to reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer and other illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the FDA contend that, after the policy change, the agency bypassed 
normal procedures and allowed companies to make health claims immediately, 
rather than after establishing new rules. New rules have not been approved yet 
by the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a fiber war worse than the cold war on our hands," Young said, 
referring to the number of foods containing fiber that claim to reduce the risk 
of cancer or lower cholesterol levels. "There is a need to more systematically 
and cautiously develop truthful, non-misleading health messages that consumers 
can understand and rely upon . . . . We have a new strategy that we are going 
to pursue relentlessly." 
</P>
<P>
Young, however, refused to give details of that strategy, saying it has not 
been completed. 
</P>
<P>
The comments came after committee members and other witnesses blasted the FDA, 
chastising the agency for abandoning its authority over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The policy change "has seriously weakened the FDA's ability to challenge even 
what the agency itself believes are deceptive claims," said Rep. Ted Weiss 
(D-N.Y.), chairman of the human resources and intergovernmental relations 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
"I strongly suggest public health is being harmed by that policy (of 
inaction)," Weiss added. "The proliferation of health claims . . . is 
destroying the credibility of the food label." 
</P>
<P>
Drugs are not allowed on the market until manufacturers submit data to the FDA 
proving they are safe and effective. But, under current law, food makers do not 
have to present any research findings to back up health claims made for their 
products. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have is a de facto policy of non-enforcement," said Robert Abrams, 
attorney general for the state of New York. "It sent a powerful signal to 
industry that health claims were now acceptable to federal regulators, and it 
unleashed a flood of misleading assertions." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Abrams said, a Federal Trade Commission relaxation of false 
advertising laws placed a heavy burden on states to take protective action of 
their own against the claims -- claims that FDA officials concede have not been 
required to meet the same standard of scientific proof required for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce A. Silverglade, director of legal affairs for the Center for Science in 
the Public Interest, said the lack of government clearance of health claims is 
a return to the "arcane days of consumer beware." 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to see a return to hucksterism," Silverglade said. "The food label 
is simply an inappropriate place to give complex nutritional information and 
health advice. There's no one in government looking out for the consumer." 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses and committee members urged a return to the health-claim ban and said 
new legislation may not be capable of defining acceptable claims.

THE MEDITERRANEAN SUMMIT; 
</P>
<P>
LAST SUMMIT AT SEA LED TO ATLANTIC CHARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last time an American President met at sea with a world-renowned foreign 
leader was in August, 1941, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt conferred with 
British Prime Minister Winston Churchill aboard a British warship in Placenta 
Bay, Newfoundland, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting, which ended Aug. 12, was held during Britain's darkest 
hours in World War II. It also came four months before the United States 
entered the conflict, but the discussions left little doubt that America would 
soon be involved. 
</P>
<P>
The shipboard conference's most notable achievement was a joint proclamation 
setting down "certain common principles" of Britain and the United States in 
what became known as the Atlantic Charter. Among its eight points were an 
affirmation of the right to self-determination, a vow that the United States 
and Britain would seek no new territory or territorial changes without the 
consent of the people involved, rejection of the use of force to settle 
conflicts, free trade and joint economic development. 
</P>
<P>
The charter's main impact was as a morale-booster for democratic nations at a 
time of pessimism and discouragement. Endorsed by other democratic states, it 
became one of the building blocks in the creation of the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Roosevelt and Churchill had brought their senior military advisers to the 
shipboard conference. And although the United States was still formally 
neutral, the meeting gave the British and American staffs an opportunity to 
meet and develop contacts that would become useful after the United States 
entered the war.

<P>
DIPLOMACY: GORBACHEV APPARENTLY HAS HIGHER HOPES THAN BUSH FOR THE RESULTS OF 
THE CONFERENCE.

<P>
Although the meeting of Soviet and American presidents in the Mediterranean 
will be informal and its agenda open, the Soviet Union nevertheless expects 
significant progress on arms control and other difficult issues, Foreign 
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze indicated Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet hope, Shevardnadze implied in announcing plans for the meeting, is 
that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Bush will reach agreement on 
formulas to resolve the major questions remaining in negotiations on new arms 
control treaties, which could then be signed next year. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the shipboard meeting as "a major political development," 
Shevardnadze said that while the two presidents plan to hold a broad, 
open-ended dialogue, they will focus on agreements to be concluded at their 
subsequent meeting in May or June. 
</P>
<P>
"This meeting should be regarded as the most important stage in preparing the 
negotiations that will take place in the United States during the official 
state visit there of Mikhail Gorbachev," Shevardnadze told a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
"But we do not exclude that the leaders will give certain instructions to their 
foreign ministers and other representatives of our countries so that after this 
dialogue there will be practical preparations for the Washington summit." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boost for Gorbachev 
</P>
<P>
This suggested to Western diplomats that Moscow, as has become customary under 
Gorbachev, is setting its sights higher for the Mediterranean meeting than 
Washington is, probably in the hope that this will give the talks greater 
dynamism and provide the Soviet president with a bit of political leverage. 
</P>
<P>
Since the negotiation of the first strategic arms treaties in the early 1970s, 
Moscow and Washington have often used summit meetings to reach agreement on 
broad approaches and occasionally on the resolution of knotty questions in 
order to move the negotiations forward. The usual device is "agreed 
instructions," a term used Tuesday by Shevardnadze. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's wait and see," the Soviet foreign minister said when pressed for 
Moscow's agenda for the December meeting. "The main thing is that the meeting 
is to take place." 
</P>
<P>
Moscow has said repeatedly that it would like to see a preliminary agreement 
next year on reducing strategic arms by 50%, though serious questions remain 
open. It also wants agreement on reducing conventional forces in Europe and on 
outlawing chemical arms, and on protocols that will permit ratification of 
treaties limiting nuclear tests. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze spoke with evident satisfaction, for Moscow had been attempting 
for months to engage the Bush Administration in a deeper dialogue but found 
itself repeatedly put off, first during a "strategic review" and then by 
evident reluctance of key presidential advisers to commit the United States to 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow had repeatedly tried to force the pace. Gorbachev went to New York last 
December to address the United Nations, putting forward new arms reduction 
proposals then and several times since, with the goal of engaging the Bush 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze, meeting in mid-September with Bush and Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III, had offered a series of concessions to clear several of the 
remaining obstacles to the strategic arms reduction treaty, and both sides 
emerged from those sessions in Washington and Jackson Hole, Wyo., almost 
rhapsodic about the improved state of relations. 
</P>
<P>
As Gorbachev has continued his meetings with other world leaders the need grew 
more apparent to officials here for a Soviet-American summit conference. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Invited Himself' 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, Gorbachev simply invited himself to the United Nations, and 
President Reagan and President-elect Bush came up from Washington," a Soviet 
foreign affairs specialist commented after Tuesday's announcement. "But he 
can't do that every year." 
</P>
<P>
Although Bush said in Washington that the meeting was originally his idea and 
had been accepted by Gorbachev, Soviet officials began searching last summer 
for a way to bring the two leaders together, believing that a personal 
relationship would likely develop to strengthen ties between them. 
</P>
<P>
A key consideration for Moscow, Soviet officials said, was the need to allay 
the concern of many in the Bush Administration, notably Secretary of Defense 
Dick Cheney and Robert M. Gates, the President's assistant national security 
adviser, on the strength of Gorbachev's domestic position and the durability of 
his reform program. 
</P>
<P>
"Skeptics are telling Bush that Gorbachev will fail and so why deal with him, 
why negotiate anything?" a Soviet foreign policy official commented. "This has 
slowed the negotiations considerably. The prospect of no summit until next 
summer would have been unacceptable to us without the understanding that there 
would be the pre-summit meeting now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Insight on Tactics 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze, questioned about the announcement, provided limited insight into 
Soviet tactics. 
</P>
<P>
"Both sides found it useful and, I would even say, necessary at this time to 
hold such an informal, interim summit," he said. They expected, he said, that 
the talks would foster "further development and deepening of the positive 
changes in Soviet-American relations, which have had a positive effect on the 
world political climate." 
</P>
<P>
For some here, Shevardnadze's comments recalled the meeting -- also billed as a 
"pre-summit" -- between then President Ronald Reagan and Gorbachev three years 
ago in Iceland. That session, hurriedly prepared but intended to produce 
breakthroughs on arms control, collapsed with U.S. and Soviet negotiators at 
loggerheads over a complex package of interlocking measures. 
</P>
<P>
To keep the meeting in December informal and allow the two presidents and their 
advisers to get to know one another better, Shevardnadze said, neither side has 
"set a goal of reaching any agreements on any specific issues," although the 
whole range of Soviet and U.S. interests will probably be discussed.

<P>
The decision of President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to 
hold their first working meeting aboard warships at sea will immediately create 
a memorable and symbolic backdrop for the historic event. 
</P>
<P>
The settings will dramatize the growing military-to-military contacts between 
the two superpowers and the two nations' decreasing military and political 
rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
The summit-at-sea provides the leaders with the desired security, privacy and 
intimacy. But it also poses a host of logistical problems unlike those of 
previous onshore summits, from the choice of ships to the possibility of rough 
water and seasickness. 
</P>
<P>
Washington and Moscow have agreed to send roughly equivalent cruisers from 
their navies for the meetings, but the specific ships have not been named. The 
United States and the Soviet Union both maintain substantial fleets in the 
Mediterranean, including cruisers, destroyers, frigates and submarines. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Navy also continually stations an aircraft carrier in the region, but 
the Soviets have no equivalent ship. 
</P>
<P>
The obvious U.S. choice is the cruiser Belknap, flagship of the U.S. 6th Fleet, 
which is permanently based at Gaeta, Italy. As the fleet's flagship, it has 
quarters fit for a senior naval commander, including a wood-paneled conference 
room and elegant wardrooms and staterooms. 
</P>
<P>
But the Administration may be reluctant to use the Belknap, since its name is 
associated with a Nov. 22, 1975, incident in which the cruiser collided with 
the carrier John F. Kennedy off Sicily, killing eight American sailors and 
injuring 46. 
</P>
<P>
Navy spokesman Lt. Bruce Cole said that three U.S. cruisers would be on station 
in the Mediterranean in time for the Dec. 2-3 summit: the Aegis-class cruiser 
Yorktown and the guided-missile cruisers Wainwright and Harry E. Yarnell. 
</P>
<P>
Each is about 550 feet long, displacing 7,000 to 9,000 tons. The Soviet navy 
has several equivalent classes of warships, including the new Kara-class 
cruisers. 
</P>
<P>
Also still to be decided is whether the discussions will take place while the 
ships are under way or at anchor. 
</P>
<P>
Landing a helicopter on a moving warship is a tricky business, even in good 
weather, naval experts say. And boarding from a smaller launch can also be 
harrowing in high winds and heavy seas, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Retired Adm. Gene LaRoque of the pacifist Center for Defense Information 
suggested that the meeting likely will take place in a neutral port, such as 
the island of Malta, or as the ships are lashed together in international 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
There is scant historical precedent for a shipboard summit. The last time an 
American President met a foreign leader aboard a warship was during World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
President Franklin D. Roosevelt met British Prime Minister Winston Churchill 
aboard the British battleship Prince of Wales off the coast of Newfoundland in 
August, 1941.

Latvians of conscription age are refusing to do their military service, the 
official Tass news agency reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
It said the recruits in the Latvian republic are invoking a clause in the 1949 
Geneva Convention barring service in an occupying army. They are filling in 
special printed slips invoking the convention and refusing to serve. 
</P>
<P>
Tass implied that the forms distort the Geneva Convention. It did not say who 
is supplying them to the recruits.

The dominant Christian Democrats held their own in Rome's city council 
elections, seen as a test for Italy's national coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a corruption scandal that tainted the party's outgoing mayor, final 
results of the two-day elections ending Monday gave the Christian Democrats 
nearly 32% of the vote, slightly less than in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The council is likely to be ruled by the same outgoing coalition, in which the

The bodies of two more people have been pulled from the wreckage of the 
double-decked Nimitz Freeway, which collapsed during the rush hour in the 
devastating Oct. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Their discovery raised the total of motorists killed on the freeway to 41. The 
total of known dead in the magnitude 7.1 temblor reached 65. 
</P>
<P>
The two victims reported by the Alameda County Sheriff's Department on Tuesday 
were Joyce Ann Mabry, 31, of Berkeley, and James Flores, 39, of Rohnert Park. 
Both were killed as their cars were crushed when the upper deck fell down. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Sgt. Jim Knudsen said, "Now we are checking the vehicles for personal 
belongings. We have no reason to believe there are any more bodies." 
</P>
<P>
The body of Mabry, the mother of a 3-year-old boy, was found about 7 p.m. 
Monday, Knudsen said. About 7 a.m. Tuesday, searchers found the body of Flores, 
the father of a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to those killed under the collapsed freeway section, 12 bodies have 
been recovered in San Francisco, six in Santa Cruz County, five in Santa Clara 
County and one in Monterey County. 
</P>
<P>
The state Office of Emergency Services said that, in addition to the dead, 
3,089 people were injured in the temblor and 13,224 lost the use of their 
homes.

A pair of locked handcuffs, a bell and a lit candle sat on a small round table 
covered with a red cloth in the Parlour of Prestidigitation at the Magic Castle 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
It was Halloween, the traditional time for attempting to summon forth the 
spirit of magician Harry Houdini, who died Oct. 31, 1926. 
</P>
<P>
The locked handcuffs -- formerly Houdini's -- would open and the bell would 
ring if he made his presence felt in the castle, an 81-year-old Victorian haunt 
for sleight-of-hand artists in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Spiritualist Leo Kostka, flanked by magician Bill Larsen and Houdini historian 
Sidney Radner, stared at the candle in the darkened room and raised his arms. 
</P>
<P>
With Houdini's favorite music, "Pomp and Circumstance," playing softly in the 
background, Kostka intoned: 
</P>
<P>
"Cross the veil, Houdini. Be with us." 
</P>
<P>
The handcuffs did not open; the bell remained mute. 
</P>
<P>
After a few moments of silence, Radner concluded: "You didn't bring him back." 
</P>
<P>
"You can't have everything," Kostka replied. 
</P>
<P>
One person who would not have been surprised was Houdini, himself. 
</P>
<P>
As Radner confided before the seance: 
</P>
<P>
"Houdini didn't believe in mediums." 
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, the Long Beach Unified School District sent out a notice 
advising that students avoid wearing Natas clothing, because the name "spelled 
backward is Satan." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the company then phoned The Times and angrily said that Natas 
has nothing to do with Satan, adding: "He's Lithuanian! That's his name!" 
</P>
<P>
Natas Kaupas is a 21-year-old professional skateboarder who has appeared in 
commercials and videos and is part owner of a company that sells clothes and 
skateboards. 
</P>
<P>
The company scoffed at the district's assertion in the advisory that "many 
children involved in Satanic gangs wear Natas attire." 
</P>
<P>
"What Satanic gangs?" the spokesman asked. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing protests from the company, the district has reversed its stand. 
</P>
<P>
"The person who used to be in my position put Natas on the list," said Joe 
Pistoia, a district administrative assistant. "He apparently thought he had 
come up with information from police in San Diego. We checked and found we 
didn't have any examples (of Satanic gangs) here." 
</P>
<P>
School dress codes were also called into question last week during Red Ribbon 
Week, a national drug awareness program for students. Ironically, some schools 
with the worst drug problems were nervous about participating, because of fears 
that students who wore red ribbons would be accused of sporting gang colors. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District sent out a notice recommending that an 
alternative "neutral color be used if warranted." 
</P>
<P>
The district also made available red-white-and-blue ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
That problem aside, Johanna Goldberg, coordinator of the district's Drug Free 
Schools Program, termed Red Ribbon Week a "tremendous success." 
</P>
<P>
In honor of Halloween, KNX radio's Bill Keene gave weather reports for spots 
ranging from Bell Goblins and Woodland Chills to such distant precincts as 
Rancho Spookamonga and West Munster. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, he omitted Hacienda Frights, Hellflower, Aghoula, Ghosta Mesa, Elvira 
Monte and, of course, South Elvira Monte.

AN INVITING OPPORTUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Opportunity invites us to . . . move beyond containment, beyond the Cold War, 
to a new strategic relationship based on a sound political footing," Secretary 
of State James A. Baker III told a San Francisco audience about a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, President Bush disclosed that he has accepted opportunity's 
invitation by proposing a summit meeting in December with Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The proposal was endorsed "promptly" last July. They will 
meet for a day on a Soviet navy ship somewhere in the Mediterranean and a day 
on an American ship, in the kind of isolation and informality where they can -- 
as Bush put it -- "put our feet up" and talk. 
</P>
<P>
These are not the best of times for either Bush or Gorbachev. That alone would 
explain their ready agreement to spend two days sizing each other up and 
comparing notes about the kind of future that is being produced by incredible 
changes in the Soviet Union and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
If the meeting works, both men could come away with a better sense of where 
change presents the greatest risk and how each might act to limit the danger of 
change getting out of control. Gorbachev is following no master plan for change 
but is dealing day by day with strikes, food shortages and the clamor among his 
country's diverse ethnic groups for more autonomy. The situation is almost a 
recipe for loss of control. And it is true that after 40 years of racing to arm 
against each other, it is too early for either superpower to turn to trust 
alone as a guide to the other's intentions. 
</P>
<P>
But the plan to spend two days at sea and away from the telephones should give 
Bush and Gorbachev the time and opportunity to spell out to one another what 
sorts of sudden moves they could not tolerate. They could move toward something 
like a political relationship if they did nothing else but describe the kinds 
of actions that each considered would violate their national interests and 
agreed to try to avoid such actions. And if the meeting did not work, the 
negotiations in Vienna on conventional arms reductions and in Geneva on nuclear 
arms cuts still would go on, and Bush and Gorbachev could try again later. 
</P>
<P>
The pressures on Bush for a reduction of military forces are not nearly as 
strong as they are on Gorbachev, but they exist. The U.S. government is so 
broke that it will have to borrow the money it sends to the San Francisco Bay 
Area for earthquake relief; the Pentagon still wants more new weapons systems 
than it can afford. What's more, an era of government by politics, of politics 
and for politics has sapped Washington of the strength to deal with domestic 
problems and hampers the shaping of foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
Still, these are not the worst of times for the two superpower leaders. 
Afghanistan remains a battleground because Moscow and Washington refuse to stop 
arming their proxies, but with Soviet troops gone, neither is directly 
involved. There is no sign of dramatic breakthroughs in arms control talks, but 
talks go on. Europe seems determined to redefine itself and discover ways to 
extend its peace. And Baker may turn out to be right. It could happen on the 
Mediterranean that the two leaders will find there is an opportunity for a new 
relationship on a sound political footing.

'ISRAEL DIVIDED ONCE AGAIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The answer to "Israel Divided" may rest with Israel's president, Chaim Herzog. 
Mainline American Jewish organizations should press him to intervene in 
bringing about the necessary peace negotiations. The longer they are delayed by 
Shamir's tactics, not only will Israel suffer, but support for the Jewish state 
will be fragmentized. 
</P>
<P>
Herzog's views, made public in the Oct. 1 Opinion piece by Tad Szulc, were that 
the situation had reached a point where he (Herzog) had to " 'step over the 
line' of presidential prerogatives to protect the national interests." And as 
Szulc notes, Israel's president has the background, temperament and public 
trust to bring the peace process -- which Herzog insists is "irreversible" -- 
into being. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, at a subsequent meeting at which the Los Angeles Israeli consul general 
was the speaker, his response to a question as to the powers of the Israeli 
president, in light of Szulc's article, was surprising. 
</P>
<P>
He had read the article, but questioned its authenticity as he had yet to see 
an "official" transcript, and from his personal knowledge of Chaim Herzog, he 
doubted the president would inject himself into the current Israeli political 
stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
The Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, while staying clear 
of Israel's "politics," however, can inject itself. Peace and American 
interests in the region are issues that are the agenda of all its constituents 
and their respective memberships. It remains central to Israel's future as a 
nation and link to Jewish life in the United States and elsewhere.

'ISRAEL DIVIDED ONCE AGAIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In your editorial you put the blame on Jerusalem for the immobility in the 
peace negotiation. Your superficial judgment ignores the most important 
contributing factor to the present unacceptable situation, i.e., the shameful 
role of the U.S. Congress combined with the consistent timidity, duplicity and 
lack of character in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem has no incentive or logical reason to get into any meaningful 
negotiation which could and should lead to a bilateral compliance with U.N. 
Resolution 242. Even the token territorial concession by the Labor Party is no 
more than a public relation scam. The Israelis know very well that death, taxes 
and the eternal U.S. aid to Israel are the only unchangeable facts of life. 
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem-controlled U.S. Congress acts as an agent for Israeli interests. 
If Jerusalem serves notice on Congress there is not even talk about 
Gramm-Rudman, no consideration for the needs of our homeless, our sick and 
destitute people, our uneducated younger generation without hope. The billions 
have to be and always will be ready for the dreamers of Greater Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Even more appalling is the fact that President Bush and Secretary of State 
James Baker are fully aware of this humiliating situation and still are 
continuing to perpetuate the hoax of a no-hope Arab-Israeli negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
Stop the unrestricted flow of our money to the Israeli government and we might 
see some action in the right direction.

OCEAN POLLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am a surfer from the South Bay. Recently, while I was sitting in the lineup 
at Torrance Beach I began to smell an obnoxious odor. It had rained the night 
before, but I thought nothing of it. I soon forgot about the smell because the 
conditions were good. I saw that there were better conditions farther down the 
beach, so I walked down to check it out. While walking the smell grew stronger. 
I neared a concrete drainpipe and saw it spewing out garbage and raw sewage 
into the ocean. I looked farther out and saw my unknowing friends surfing. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was sludge gushing out, but plastic cups, bags and cans were also 
floating around. I walked back down the beach toward my car and I almost 
tripped over three dead rats that had washed up. That whole day I never even 
saw a sign posted giving warning. When I got to the public shower I felt like I 
could not clean myself enough.

Let us compare our two most recent commanders in chief. Ronald Reagan clearly 
proved his superiority in his magnificent victory in Grenada, while George Bush 
clearly demonstrated his inferiority in his dismal failure in Panama. Long live 
Ronnie, one of our most brilliant tacticians.

QUAKE COLUMNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Opinion section of The Times (Oct. 22) is one which I will save because of 
the articles beginning on the front page. That wonderful reprint of Jack 
London's "San Francisco, 1906," from Collier's Weekly, May 5, 1906, established 
the precedent revealed in the following articles: that the spirit of the people 
has not changed in 83 years. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Gold's actions and reactions in and to the quake were heart-warming and 
impressive; and I loved the "kindly former wife" who had taken the trouble to 
come by and leave a note on his door -- that all the children were safe and 
accounted for. I hope she comes by again. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, thanks for a fine set of articles. I shall read them again when I 
need a lifting up.

THE BOTTOM TEN: LSU TIGERS NEARLY LOST NO. 1 SPOT

The Colleges 
</P>
<P>
Losing State University kept a tenacious hold on No. 1, but the Paper Tigers 
were nearly dethroned by last weekend's opponent, No. 2 Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
The Volunteers went into the game against once-victorious LSU as a two-point 
underdog, one of the biggest insults ever dealt a 5-1 team. What's worse, they 
managed only a 45-39 win. The NCAA has since asked accountants from Price 
Waterhouse to review Tennessee's claim of having won five games. 
</P>
<P>
Ranked No. 3 this week are AP's voters, who failed to rank Hawaii (6-2) in the 
Top 25, despite the school's 56-14 win over BYU (6-2). Here's the punchline: 
BYU is No. 23. "Maybe I shouldn't have pulled the first team when we were 
ahead, 56-7," said Hawaii Coach Bob Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the Top Ten Thug rankings, Miami regained No. 1 from Notre Dame. 
The visiting Hurricanes attempted unsuccessfully to block Florida State mascot 
Chief Osceola from galloping onto the field before the game to thrust his 
flaming spear into the Seminoles' logo. The chief made it on an end run.

CHEAP SHOT OF THE WEEK (outside the Bottom Ten): ABC commentator Dick Vermeil 
(an ex-UCLA coach) asserting that the Bruins' poor season is due to a coaching 
staff that "assumed" that winning had become "automatic." (How sad to see 
Bruins turning on each other.) 
</P>
<P>
LOU HOLTZ RESIGNATION WATCH: None this week. Well-behaved Irish players blocked 
no stadium tunnels this week and were penalized just 50 yards. 
</P>
<P>
COMEDOWN OF THE WEEK (by 46 points): BYU, a four-point favorite over Hawaii, 
lost by 42. 
</P>
<P>
QUOTEBOOK: Noting that Fitchburg (Mass.) State Coach Dave Secino is also the 
town tailor, reader Bob Brigham figures that Secino inspired the Falcons to end 
their 34-game losing streak against Southeastern Massachusetts by telling his 
players beforehand: "Men, those guys put their pants on one leg at a time -- I 
know." 
</P>
<P>
The Pros 
</P>
<P>
Owning a real, semi-live pro football team is certainly proving exciting for 
Dallas' Jerry Jones. 
</P>
<P>
His Cowboys, who were dragged off into the sunset by their opponents for an 
eighth straight time, now seem certain to become the first NFL team to finish 
0-16. Old-timers no doubt will claim that NFL legends like the 1925 Columbus 
Panhandles (0-9) or the 1928 Dayton Triangles (0-7) could have pulled off that 
feat, but Dallas has the advantage of the longer schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jones has been hit with a demand for ticket refunds for Cowboy fans 
from Robert Goodwin, an unappreciative local attorney, who is threatening to 
sue the team under the state's deceptive trade act. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more deceptive trades, of course, was the shipping of Herschel 
Walker to Minnesota. Dallas' chief running back is now a guy they picked up on 
waivers from Kansas City. Meanwhile, rookie quarterback Steve Walsh's play 
Sunday inspired chants of "We Want Babe!" a reference to Babe Laufenberg, 
third-string quarterback emeritus. 
</P>
<P>
THE RANKINGS 
</P>
<P>
(Due to fact that all NFL teams besides Dallas are 4-4, this week's spotlight 
falls on the league's all-time, one-season losers):

FISH REPORT: TROUT ARE PLENTIFUL IN SIERRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Eastern Sierra trout season closed Tuesday, but the lower Owens River and 
Pleasant Valley Reservoir will remain open year-round, and trout limits are not 
hard to come by, according to Dave Smith of Culvers Sporting Goods in Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
One reason is that the 10-fish limit has been reduced to five. Smith said 
anglers can expect to catch mostly rainbows between eight and 15 inches, and 
some larger browns in Pleasant Valley Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE MEAD -- Striped bass biting primarily in lower basin. Live shad at 25-60 
feet best bet. Top-water action slow. Largemouth bass and catfish slow. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE HAVASU -- Striped bass action best from 30-40 feet using anchovies and 
deep-running lures off points. Largemouth bass slow, pressure high because of 
recent and future tournaments. Spinner baits and plastic worms working best. 
Catfish biting at 20-40 feet on most baits. 
</P>
<P>
BULLHEAD CITY -- Some limits of trout caught on river, but strong winds making 
for tough fishing. Berkley Power Bait and blue Mepps lures working best. 
Catfish averaging five pounds biting primarily on river. Anchovies best bet. 
</P>
<P>
SALTON SEA -- Orangemouth corvina fair, best in early mornings at State Park 
jetty and North shore area. Inconsistent afternoon bite at Red Hill. Sargo 
biting throughout sea. Nightcrawlers and corn best bet. Tilapia small but 
active, biting best in late afternoon at Salt Creek and Corvina Beach. Channel 
catfish bite fair in All-American Canal. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CACHUMA -- Catfish providing best action, averaging 8-10 pounds, biting 
primarily at Johnson Bay area at 45-50 feet. Mackerel best bet. More than 4,000 
trout stocked recently, the result of private and Department of Fish and Game 
plants. Small spinners working best in mornings; most trout baits working 
during day. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CASITAS -- Several limits of trout, coming mostly from northeast end. 
Spinners and cheese baits good for fish to five pounds. Catfish excellent, 
several limits. George Collier, Oxnard, 10 trout, 80 pounds. Deer Slope and 
east shore of main island suggested areas. Largemouth bass slow. 
</P>
<P>
PYRAMID LAKE -- Striped bass picking up, averaging between 15 and 20 pounds and 
biting primarily in marina and near dam. Trout stocked Monday, bite fair to 
good. Catfish good, best at dam and island. Bluegill excellent, 15-fish 
stringers common. Crappie fair. Jose Munoz, Los Angeles, two-pound crappie, 
caught in marina. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CASTAIC -- Largemouth bass fair, best in upper lake at 30-60 feet. Gabriel 
Halcovich, Granada Hills, nine-pound bass, caught from shore in lower lake. 
Catfish slow, biting primarily in upper lake. Trout bite good, biting in both 
lakes. Power Bait best bet. 
</P>
<P>
IRVINE LAKE -- Trout opener last weekend apparently a successful one, several 
limits reported. biting best along west shore. Power Bait and inflated 
nightcrawlers best baits. Suzie Martin, Lakewood, 7 1/2-pound trout. Anthony 
and Mike Nuzmen, Orange, 10 trout, 11 1/4 pounds. Catfish slowing down, best 
outside Santiago Flats. Rudy Benton, Orange, 11-pound catfish. Largemouth bass 
and crappie slow. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE SKINNER -- Largemouth bass picking up, fair throughout lake. Plastic worms 
and grubs working best. Tom Sullivan, Orange, 8 3/4-pound bass. Steve Pezman, 
Encinitas, two bass, 6 3/4 pounds. Eric Noel, El Cajon, five-pound one-ounce 
bass. Catfish biting throughout lake. Mackerel and shrimp. Trout picking up.

53 MARLIN LANDED IN CONTEST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Plying the waters off Cabo San Lucas last week were 109 sportfishing boats, 
each carrying anglers who were hoping to catch the largest black or blue marlin 
they could find. 
</P>
<P>
They came from around this country and Canada to participate in Bisbee's ninth 
annual Black and Blue Marlin tournament, which has developed into one of the 
biggest spectacles on the southern Baja Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
The townspeople were there in force, more than 400 gathering on the beach each 
day, according to Wayne Bisbee of Bisbee's Sportfishing Headquarters on Balboa 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
Francois Chevrier of Laguna Niguel set the pace on the first day when he landed 
a 465-pound blue marlin, which would end up the event's biggest fish. 
</P>
<P>
Chevrier's fishing partner, Loren Deniger, made it tougher on the competition 
when he caught a 345-pounder to seal first place -- and a prize of $79,950 -- 
for the four aboard the Dorado III in the team category. David Ordway took 
individual honors with two blue marlin totaling 480 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the three-day tournament ended Saturday, 52 blue marlin and one 
black marlin had been brought to the scales. Since the rules stated that anyone 
keeping fish under 200 pounds would be penalized, more than 70 marlin were 
released, Bisbee said. 
</P>
<P>
More than $20,000 was raised for Camino del Estrella elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
"All the fish except two, I think, went to the orphanages and retirement 
homes," Bisbee said. "The Department of Welfare was there and was trucking the 
fish away as fast as we could bring them up the beach." 
</P>
<P>
Said Darrell Primrose of Tortuga Sportfishing: "It's the biggest deal of the 
year. The mayor and everybody comes down." 
</P>
<P>
Blue marlin remain active, and wahoo are starting to appear more frequently off 
Cabo San Lucas, but the 90-degree water temperature appears to have slowed the 
striped marlin bite, according to Primrose. The most productive area has been 
the Gordo Banks, where yellowfin tuna and dorado are also being caught. 
</P>
<P>
Farther north, in the East Cape region of the Baja Peninsula, the marlin bite 
is being described as "slower than normal" because of an abundance of giant 
squid, many weighing more than 30 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The squid have been hitting iron lures, however, and have made for an 
interesting change of pace. 
</P>
<P>
One blue marlin that apparently hadn't had its fill of squid hit two trolled 
marlin lures over the weekend and was fought by La Mirada's Fred Cotrell and 
Don Robertson, who after 1 1/4 hours landed a 561-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, dorado fishing doesn't seem to be affected by the squid, and 
Castaneda said light-tackle fishermen "are catching all the dorado they want." 
Most boats are averaging about eight a day, between 15 and 45 pounds. 
</P>

BECKER WINS IN OPENING ROUND AT PARIS

<TEXT>
<P>
Boris Becker, the reigning Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion, returned to 
tournament play after an injury layoff and easily defeated qualifier Milan 
Sjreber of Czechoslovakia, 6-3, 6-3, Tuesday in the first round of the Paris 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his quick victory, Becker says his comeback was something he had not 
taken for granted. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised at the way I played. I thought I was going to be worse," 
Becker said. "It wasn't that easy because Sjreber has a good serve and volley." 
</P>
<P>
In other action, France's Yannick Noah downed Thomas Muster of Austria, 7-5, 
3-6, 6-4; Miloslav Mecir of Czechoslovakia defeated Spain's Emilio Sanchez, 
6-2, 6-2; fourth-seeded Brad Gilbert edged Petr Korda of Czechoslovakia, 3-6, 
7-6 (7-3), 6-4, and qualifier Ronald Agenor of Haiti outlasted Paolo Cane of 
Italy, 7-6 (7-2), 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Mayotte, at least a semifinalist in the three previous Paris indoor events, 
lost in the first round to Jakob Hlasek of Switzerland, 2-6, 6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Martina Navratilova solved the powerful serve of Brenda Schultz to 
win, 6-1, 6-1, in the first round of the Virginia Slims tournament at 
Worcester, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
No. 2 Gabriela Sabatini and No. 5 Pam Shriver also were victors in the second 
day of opening-round competition. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver struggled but came from behind to beat Mary Lou Daniels, 3-6, 6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Down 0-40 in the final set at 4-3, Shriver rallied to win that game and then 
held serve to win the match. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini used a slashing baseline game to defeat Cammy McGregor, 6-1, 6-1, as 
the Argentine kept her American opponent off balance throughout the match. 
</P>
<P>
Seventh-seeded Helen Kelesi of Canadaalso advanced, coming from behind to 
defeat Beverly Bowes, 2-6, 6-2, 6-2.

VALENTI TELLS EUROPEANS TO CAN TV QUOTA LAW; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: MPAA CHAIRMAN CALLS THE BARRIERS "DANGEROUS" AND ISSUES A WARNING ON THE 
LONG-TERM EFFECTS TO U.S. PRODUCERS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Valenti, chairman of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, on Tuesday urged 
the European Community to scrap a recently enacted law imposing non-binding 
quotas on imported films and TV programs and called on Europeans to compete in 
an open, global market. 
</P>
<P>
"It sends a dark signal to those outside," Valenti said of the quota plan. "In 
a world growing smaller each day . . . trade barriers are as old-fashioned and 
as dangerous as armed conflict." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the foreign ministers of the community's 12 member states approved 
a law limiting imported television programming to no more than 50% of all 
transmissions "where practicable." News, sports, commercials and teletext 
services were not included. 
</P>
<P>
The quotas, part of a broader law establishing common television standards for 
EC member states as they prepare to dismantle internal frontiers, have been 
strenuously opposed by the U.S. government. The Bush Administration has pledged 
to press its case that the quotas violate international trade agreements. 
</P>
<P>
Valenti, in an interview after his speech, said he also plans to look into the 
possibility that the EC legislation violates the free-speech provision of the 
European Convention on Human Rights. Article 10 of the convention amounts to a 
First Amendment for the member nations. 
</P>
<P>
In his half-hour speech to a gathering of American and European business 
executives here in the city that is home to the EC Executive Commission, 
Valenti referred to the EC law on quotas as "baloney," "a needless crutch" and 
"a terrorizing contradiction for a group of countries in the process of 
eliminating internal trade restrictions." 
</P>
<P>
"It's wrong," he said, "and every professional craftsman in the world knows 
it's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The term where practicable was inserted in the law, following a prolonged 
dispute, by member nations that advocate freer trade. France was the most 
ardent supporter of a minority effort to enact tougher, binding quotas. 
</P>
<P>
Any further watering down of the less stringent limits is regarded as highly 
unlikely by political analysts here. 
</P>
<P>
The looser wording, coupled with the fact that the programming being imported 
into the EC countries is running well under the 50% limit, means that the new 
law will have little immediate impact on the American film and television 
industry. Valenti admitted this in a question-and-answer session. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the sharp tenor of Valenti's remarks, EC officials said that other 
executives in the American film industry were far less concerned about the 
recent EC action. 
</P>
<P>
Holde L'Hoest, who heads EC efforts to forge closer ties between film and 
television industries of member states, quoted Michael Solomon, president of 
Warner Bros. International Television Distribution; Bruce Gordon, president of 
Paramount's international television division, and Patrick Cox, general manager 
of NBC Europe, as indicating that the EC quotas were less serious than they 
appear. 
</P>
<P>
Valenti, however, said the provisions present a long-term danger. 
</P>
<P>
"I worry about the future," he said. "When restrictions go on, they never come 
off, and they are usually a floor, not a ceiling. Quotas are like a fungus. 
They never go away. They grow, they slowly get worse, and some day they are 
going to hurt." 
</P>
<P>
There seems to be remarkably little enthusiasm for quotas among a broad 
cross-section of European television executives and film artists, who note that 
within the next five years they will be able to produce only a seventh of the 
continent's estimated requirement of 16,000 hours of programming. 
</P>
<P>
The quotas appear to have been pushed principally by governments eager to be 
seen as protecting their cultural heritage. 
</P>
<P>
Although European industry leaders express doubt about the cultural effect of 
imported U.S. television, they tend to prefer efforts to foster closer internal 
EC cooperation to improve their competitiveness internationally. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Valenti applauded such moves. 
</P>
<P>
"Develop the factors that will allow each producer to conquer the whole of the 
European market," he said, "and then the rest of the cinema and TV world." 
</P>
<P>
He urged Europeans to expand their film schools, to extend a $2.2-million EC 
fund supporting scriptwriters and "build a new generation of film and TV stars, 
actors, actresses, whose names and faces light up screens everywhere on this 
earth." 
</P>
<P>
Valenti said vibrant national and regional film industries have created a 
public interest that benefits all film makers.

they could get worse.

STALLONE FILM CAUGHT IN SONY-WARNER BATTLE; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: GUBER-PETERS AND WARNER BROS. COURT FILINGS PUT A SPOTLIGHT ON THE 
TROUBLED "TANGO AND CASH," AN ACTION FILM THAT IS RACING THE CLOCK TO MAKE ITS 
DEC. 15 RELEASE. 
</P>

<P>
Until a few days ago, "Tango and Cash" was a forgotten element in the legal 
battle between Sony and Warner Bros. over the rights to Hollywood's hottest 
production company,Guber-Peters Entertainment. Now, by declaring in court 
papers that they were taken off the movie by Warner two days before Sony asked 
them to run Columbia Pictures, producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters have pushed 
"Tango and Cash" into the foreground. 
</P>
<P>
What is on view is a Sylvester Stallone-Kurt Russell action movie that sources 
say has been plagued by constant script revisions, poor scheduling, a change of 
directors and other production problems that may be pushing the film's budget 
beyond $50 million. And the film, the only one that the producers of "Batman" 
and "Rain Man" currently have in production, is being rushed toward a Dec. 15 
release date that a studio executive said is "almost inconceivable" to make. 
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum filed last week in Los Angeles Superior Court, Guber-Peters 
also claimed that Warner had replaced them on the project and, over Peters' 
objections, "advanced the release date of the film by many months." 
</P>
<P>
In a reply memorandum filed with the same court Monday, Warner production chief 
Mark Canton called Guber and Peters "my best friends" and reiterated what he 
had told The Times last week -- that he is in daily contact with the producers 
on matters related to the production of "Tango and Cash." 
</P>
<P>
Canton also declared in his memo that film editor Stuart Baird had been hired 
to supervise the post-production phase of "Tango and Cash" before Sony offered 
to buy both Columbia Pictures and Guber-Peters, and make the duo co-chairmen of 
the studio. Warner has refused to release Guber and Peters from the five-year 
contract they signed in May. 
</P>
<P>
"Tango and Cash," a story conceived by Peters about two incompatible cops 
forced into an alliance, went into production in June, changed directors in 
late August and finished two weeks of reshooting just 12 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
The film finally wrapped Oct. 20, eight weeks before its scheduled opening in 
1,600 theaters across the United States. ("Tango and Cash" trailers began 
screening Oct. 21 in theaters showing the action movies "Next of Kin" and 
"Black Rain.") 
</P>
<P>
Canton acknowledged that it will be a tight squeeze to get the film -- "now 
more than 50% done" -- ready for Christmas. "But 'Batman' was a great training 
ground for all of us," he said, noting that that Guber-Peters production was 
also the subject of reports of a troubled set. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Guber-Peters said that the producers would not comment 
because of the litigation. 
</P>
<P>
When the highly regarded Soviet-born director Andrei Konchalovsky ("Runaway 
Train") was replaced by Albert Magnoli, who manages rock singer Prince and 
directed Prince's hit film "Purple Rain" for Warner, the reason for the change 
was given as "creative differences." Warner has consistently denied that there 
are further problems with the film. In fact, Canton says he sees "Tango and 
Cash" becoming the kind of hit that generates sequels. 
</P>
<P>
Others are less sanguine. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the worst-organized, most poorly prepared film I've ever been on in 
my life," said a veteran member of the "Tango and Cash" crew, who spoke on the 
condition that he not be identified. "From the first day we started, no one 
knew what the hell anyone was doing." 
</P>
<P>
Versions differ as to why Konchalovsky decided to leave the project after 
nearly three months of filming. 
</P>
<P>
Though there have been frequent director changes on previous Stallone films 
("Rocky II," "Nighthawks," "Rhinestone" and "Rambo III"), Canton and sources on 
the "Tango" set insisted that the actor had nothing to do with Konchalovsky's 
departure. 
</P>
<P>
"Sylvester Stallone had no involvement in (Konchalovsky's) decision whatsoever 
-- zero," said Canton. Added a source close to the project, "He was just a 
working actor in this one." 
</P>
<P>
Stallone declined to be interviewed for this story but sent a letter to The 
Times that proclaimed in glowing terms his support for Konchalovsky and the 
overall production. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most fun I've ever had on a movie," Stallone's statement read in 
part. "I'll be sorry when this film is over." 
</P>
<P>
Sources on the set said Konchalovsky was pushed out by Guber-Peters because he 
was so far behind schedule that it would have been impossible to deliver the 
film for the Christmas deadline that the producers say was pushed up and that 
the studio says was always there. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, soon after completing principal photography in September, replacement 
director Magnoli called everyone back to the set for two more weeks of shooting 
that sources say was necessitated by his decision to create an entirely new 
opening sequence. 
</P>
<P>
Konchalovsky has refused to discuss his departure from "Tango and Cash." 
Creative differences is often the industry euphemism for a director's firing, 
but both Konchalovsky's agent, Martin Baum, and Warner maintain that the 
decision was mutual. Baum said Konchalovsky had been asked to accelerate the 
production schedule and that he could not live with the script changes and lost 
scenes that the speeded-up pace would have required. 
</P>
<P>
"We hadn't quite nailed down -- from a creative standpoint -- some of the 
'beats' we wanted in the third act," Canton said, adding that "as this (movie) 
got evolving," it became "too overwhelming for Andrei." 
</P>
<P>
Production sources said that Konchalovsky had been given impossible scheduling 
demands and was then made the "scapegoat" when he fell behind. 
</P>
<P>
"He found himself in over his head," said a crew member. "There were scenes 
scheduled for three days that were so complicated they should have been 
scheduled for six or seven days. They were trying to do a 22-week movie in 11 
weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Production manager and co-producer Larry Franco would not comment, referring 
inquiries to Warner. 
</P>
<P>
In May, Stallone had talked hopefully about the then-pending "Tango and Cash," 
saying the film was "kind of like a 'Lethal Weap" 
</P>
<P>
"I think moviegoers will be surprised with what we're doing with our 
characters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The story has Stallone playing against type. His character, Tango, is refined 
and articulate and wears three-piece Armani suits, glasses and a short, sleek 
haircut. Kurt Russell's Cash is the opposite -- a slob with rumpled clothes and 
longish hair. Their friction intensifies when Tango thinks that Cash has slept 
with his sister. 
</P>
<P>
The film, which was originally known as "Setup," was based on an idea of 
Peters' and written by Randy Feldman ("Hell Night"), who was working on other 
projects with Guber-Peters. 
</P>
<P>
Stallone did not enter the picture until after Feldman was hired. By that time, 
said Canton, the studio had "abated" plans for a sequel to Stallone's 1985 
film, "Cobra." "But we wanted to work with Sylvester again. We thought of him 
immediately (for "Tango and Cash")," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet-born Konchalovsky, best known as a director of psychological 
character studies ("Shy People"), wasn't an obvious choice for the action 
drama. But his one American hit -- "Runaway Train" -- inspired Warner 
executives to tap him for "Tango and Cash," and Guber-Peters approved. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Runaway Train' was exciting, as well as a performance piece," said Canton, 
who acknowledged that the studio envisioned a similar product from 
Konchalovsky. (The film earned actors Jon Voight and Eric Roberts Academy Award 
nominations.) 
</P>
<P>
But if Konchalovsky was an odd choice, so was Magnoli, a graduate primarily of 
the MTV school. Besides "Purple Rain," which he directed for Warner, he has 
done just one other feature -- the 1986 "American Anthem," which was panned by 
critics and ignored by moviegoers. Most recently, he directed the "Batman" 
video that starred Prince. 
</P>
<P>
"But you should know that the 'Batman' video was an acclaimed video," said 
Canton, who called Magnoli "a stand-up guy who was available" to step in and 
direct. 
</P>
<P>
Canton never had any doubt about Magnoli's ability to complete "Tango and 
Cash," a transition made smoother, he said, by the fact that "Purple Rain's" 
cameraman Donald L. Thorin was also on "Tango." 
</P>
<P>
In November, during "Tango and Cash" post-production, Stallone will once again 
be back in the ring filming "Rocky V." 
</P>
<P>
Konchalovsky is scouting locations for his next movie, "Inner Circle," which 
will star Thomas Hulce ("Amadeus"), and is also slated to direct a Placido 
Domingo opera in Los Angeles next year, according to agent Martin Baum, "so his 
career is fine, just fine." 
</P>
<P>
That career will even include additional projects with Warner, said Canton. "We 
have every intention of working with him again. We will maintain a professional 
relationship and a courtesy with Andrei." Does this mean Canton has no regrets 
about what transpired? "I wouldn't want to go through it again," he admitted. 
</P>
<P>
"Having done 'Batman' with Guber-Peters . . . this to me is a piece of cake."

tortured, morally divided soul depicted in Roland Joffe's new film "Fat Man and 
Little Boy"? Or was he a man intently focused on succeeding, having made peace 
with his role at the helm of the top-secret $2-billion Manhattan Project at Los 
Alamos, N.M.? 
</P>
<P>
In his film debut, actor Dwight Schultz portrays Oppenheimer as a brilliant but 
weak man whose ambition overshadowed his inner doubts about the morality of 
building an atomic bomb. Oppenheimer, says director Joffe, "is Hamlet as 
Shakespeare would have written him if he was alive now." This Oppenheimer is 
readily manipulated by the gruff military man in charge of the Manhattan 
Project, Gen. Leslie R. Groves, played by Paul Newman. 
</P>
<P>
But Schultz's portrayal has drawn criticism from other quarters. Richard 
Rhodes, author of "The Making of the Atomic Bomb," which won the 1987 National 
Book Award, calls this depiction "an ignorant distortion of the man. . . . The 
Oppenheimer of wartime was not a divided human being. He was not Hamlet-like. 
He was focused and centered on making this thing happen." 
</P>
<P>
Critics too are divided on Schultz's performance. When the film opened last 
month, The Times' Sheila Benson, for example, wrote that Schultz managed to 
create "a believably complicated figure." But Newsweek's David Ansen wrote that 
"neither Schultz nor the script gets inside the man's edgy, haunted soul." 
</P>
<P>
Schultz became a contender for the part of Oppenheimer when Joffe -- determined 
to cast an unknown -- asked his casting director to round up all the actors on 
American stages who were currently portraying Valmont in "Les Liaisons 
Dangereuses," a character notorious for manipulating and objectifying human 
beings. He found Schultz in a production at the Williamstown (Mass.) Theater 
Festival. Schultz may be not be a familiar face in Hollywood circles, but 
millions of TV viewers know him as the zany "Howling Mad" Murdock on NBC's 
former series "The A-Team." His stint on the "The A-Team" -- from 1983 to 1987, 
when the series was canceled -- followed a long career on stage, but Schultz 
had never appeared in a feature film. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at Paramount were reticent about hiring someone without name 
recognition with movie audiences. But Joffe persisted. "He has a volatile, 
interesting mind," Joffe says of Schultz. 
</P>
<P>
Schultz, ironically, also had an affinity for physics. In fact, he says, it was 
Heinz Pagels' "The Cosmic Code" -- an attempt to explain quantum physics to the 
layman -- that added important new perspective to his life. 
</P>
<P>
The transformation came in 1982, at age 35, when Schultz was struggling, 
sleeping on couches and barely scraping out a living as an actor. He was close 
to giving up on show business. Pagels' book taught Schultz to look at the world 
in more relative terms -- and not to take himself, or his profession, so 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"For example," Schultz says one afternoon as he picks up a copy of Pagels' book 
from a coffee table, "in the micro world of particles, when scientists view 
photons, if they want to view photons as a wave, it's a wave. If they want to 
look at it as a particle, they behave as particles. . . . There was a lot of 
philosophical discussion about this: Is it what I want it to be at the moment?" 
</P>
<P>
Schultz applied these philosophical meanderings to his own life. "When someone 
props you up and another tears you down, it's not a question of wrong or 
right," he says. "And for you to try to beat yourself on the breast and say 
you're a terrible person -- or say that you're a wonderful person because 
everyone loves you -- is probably going a little too far." 
</P>
<P>
His acting career up until then had been a struggle. He graduated from Towson 
State University in Maryland and formed a touring company, the Baltimore 
Theater Ensemble, with a couple of friends. Later he appeared in regional 
productions before landing roles in Off-Broadway productions. 
</P>
<P>
He made his Broadway debut in "The Water Engine," which began at Joseph Papp's 
Public Theatre before being transferred to the Plymouth. He also starred on 
Broadway in "Night and Day" with Maggie Smith and "The Crucifer of Blood." He 
played opposite Charlton Heston when the production moved to L.A.'s Ahmanson 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
But in between stage work, Schultz struggled to make ends meet with odd jobs. 
The financial hardship came to an end when Schultz swallowed his stage actor's 
pride and auditioned for "The A-Team." Again, Pagels' book taught him the value 
of not taking himself so seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the way you want to see it," Schultz says of TV shows like "The A-Team." 
"If you want to see it as the epitome of art, it will be. If you want to see it 
as the height of exploitation and degradation, it will be. Neither of them is 
true. The truth is you're simply scratching out a living: I'm a song-and-dance 
man. That's the truth and there's a relaxation that comes with that." After 
reading Pagels' book, physics became a minor passion for Schultz. 
</P>
<P>
Joffe looked at nearly 30 other actors before hiring Schultz to play 
Oppenheimer. As Schultz recalls, he was cast the day before production began 
and was forced to leave his daughter's 1-year birthday party to fly to Durango, 
Mexico, where shooting was about to begin. There he continued discussions with 
Joffe and Newman about how to portray Oppenheimer. "Being the typical actor," 
Schultz says, "I wanted to be very accurate (in the depiction of Oppenheimer). 
When I told Roland this, he just rolled his eyes." 
</P>
<P>
The reason for Joffe's reaction is that Oppenheimer spoke in a "clipped, 
affected voice that at times was graceful but at other times had a tendency to 
explode," Schultz says, doing his best Oppenheimer impersonation. "His voice 
also had a Mr. Rogers quality to it." Joffe didn't want Schultz to impersonate 
Oppenheimer's affected, often arrogant manner. "In a film about J. Robert 
Oppenheimer, you could," says Schultz. "But in this film, we wanted to make him 
more accessible, more of a human being faced with a dilemma rather than a man 
who spent his life putting himself above other people." 
</P>
<P>
Says Joffe: "I wanted our Oppenheimer to be as true as possible to the inner 
Oppenheimer. We wanted to get at the inner truth, to feel the real tensions 
inside these people (at Los Alamos). In public, Oppenheimer was a dominant, 
powerful scientist. But he was also a vulnerable, weak man." 
</P>
<P>
But Rhodes rejects the notion, forwarded in Joffe's film, that Groves played 
the devil to Oppenheimer's Faust. After the war, Rhodes says, more moral doubts 
did creep into Oppenheimer's thinking. For example, Rhodes notes, two years 
after American military planes dropped the code-named "Fat Man" and "Little 
Boy" bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Oppenheimer said to President Truman: 
"Mr. Truman, I have blood on my hands." During and after the war, the 
government viewed Oppenheimer as a security risk for his leftist views. 
</P>
<P>
Schultz calls "Fat Man and Little Boy" "an impression of reality, not reality. 
The attempt to make this human dilemma accessible was paramount, and anything 
that detracted from it had to be chipped away."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: THE TELEVISION SEASON THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I hate to be an old "I told you so," but . . . I told you so. 
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming bulk of the fall season's new series are not only nerds 
creatively, but also failures in the ratings. Earliest casualties to date are 
"The People Next Door" on CBS and "The Nutt House" on NBC, and other 
cancellations seem imminent. 
</P>
<P>
The only new series approaching hit status is ABC's "Chicken Soup," but even it 
may be endangered for not holding enough of the audience of its powerful 
lead-in, "Roseanne." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, the networks. When will they learn? 
</P>
<P>
Time after time I share my ideas with them, and time after time they blindly 
ignore my genius. Well, this is it. I've said that before, but this time I mean 
it. Unequivocally. No more chances. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, here are my own proposals for guaranteed hits: 
</P>
<P>
"Alien Yiddish Comics?" Heavy social drama. A spaceship carrying 300,000 aliens 
from another galaxy lands on Earth. The aliens attempt to assimilate into human 
society, but there are problems because they all look and talk like Jackie 
Mason. 
</P>
<P>
"Saturday Night With Connie Chungs." In-depth news. The emphasis is on 
simulations, with a different actress playing Connie Chung each week and a 
"900" number flashed on the screen to allow viewers to vote for their favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"PrimeTime Tape With Nobody You Know." In-depth news. This is the new 
journalism, a trailblazing show on the edge that leaves behind the staleness of 
live TV for the danger and excitement of videotape, hosted by rare TV 
journalists who have not been featured in People magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"RoboCops." Reality/live action/cinema verite. Camera crews closely follow 
squads of cyborg police, capturing the action and intense personal drama as 
they annihilate an entire city and themselves in pursuit of drug dealers and 
users. 
</P>
<P>
"Living Dulls." Comedy. Four really dull young models live with a really dull 
woman who owns a modeling agency. Together they do really dull things. A very 
relaxing show. 
</P>
<P>
"Rod 'n' Red." Police/action. The unlikely pairing of two detectives results in 
riveting drama that's not for the fainthearted. Rod is totally off the wall and 
loves roaring around town in his souped-up hot rod. Red is just the opposite, 
doing everything by the book. Unfortunately for Rod, Red's book is The 
Communist Manifesto. That's where they clash, producing dialogue that's 
electrifying. 
</P>
<P>
Rod: "The price of spark plugs is getting out of hand, man." 
</P>
<P>
Red: "See here, Rod, property in its present form is based on the antagonism of 
capital and wage-labor. Let us examine both sides of this antagonism." 
</P>
<P>
"Dif'rent Notes: The Adventures of Bing Cosby." Comedy. A white family adopts a 
pipe-smoking, tiny black crooner who constantly irritates them by singing 
Christmas carols. 
</P>
<P>
"Me." Interview. Each week Barbara Walters is interviewed by a different 
celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
"What If ...?" News. Fascinating docudrama-style simulations of speculations on 
the impact of wildly improbable likelihoods. The premiere episode ("Bread 
Against Bullets") has Israeli troops occupying the Left Bank in Paris, thereby 
incurring the wrath of the residents, who dramatically resist by hurling their 
breakfast baguettes at the heavily armed soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
"Doogie Quixote, W.K." Comedy/drama. Idealistic Doogie Quixote juggles two 
lives. To his fellow 8-year-olds and oafish best friend, Sancho Panza, he's 
just one of the guys. To those who encounter him roaming the countryside on his 
bicycle and challenging windmills and flocks of sheep, however, he's Doogie 
Quixote, Wandering Knight. After suffering the insults of other wandering 
knights four times his age, he ultimately wins their trust. A fine tribute to 
the Cervantes classic. 
</P>
<P>
"Just the 36 of Us." Comedy. A widower with four children marries a divorcee 
with five children. She dies, making him a single parent with nine kids. After 
marrying a widow with 10 children, he dies, leaving her with 19 kids to look 
after. She marries and moves in with a single man who lives with his parents, 
grandparents and five sisters, one of whom adopts six unruly orphans. Then the 
high jinks begin. 
</P>
<P>
"Phantom of the Soap Operas." Horror. Still bitterly resentful of being taken 
off the air, a deranged and hideously contorted Blake Carrington of ABC's 
defunct "Dynasty" haunts CBS, methodically murdering the characters of 
"Dallas," "Falcon Crest" and "Knots Landing." 
</P>
<P>
"Rescue 30 Share." Reality. Go behind the scenes of the television industry for 
re-creations of actual attempts of networks to courageously rescue shows from 
cancellation. Sample: "Maybe if we change the title, no one will notice it's 
the same show." 
</P>
<P>
"Wise Goy." Drama/intrigue. An undercover Gentile infiltrates the Jewish 
Defense League. 
</P>
<P>
"Capitol Game." Drama/adventure. A dynamic young congressman also finds time to 
play quarterback for the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything But Roseanne." Comedy. A young couple meet and are attracted to each 
other despite having absolutely nothing in common. Nothing, that is, except 
their mutual dislike of a certain TV series. Their friends and family try every 
hilarious scheme imaginable to change their minds, but it's no use. This 
stubborn pair will watch just about anything on television, anything but 
"Roseanne." 
</P>
<P>
"The Tammy Faye Movie Package." Light drama. Tammy Faye Bakker puts the past 
behind her, affirming her acting talents in a series of TV movies about a naive 
country girl: "Tammy Faye and the Bachelor," "Tammy Faye and the Doctor," 
"Tammy Faye and the Millionaire" and "Tammy Faye Tell Me True." For a change of 
pace, there's also "Tammantula," with Tammy Fay playing a huge spider that 
sings hymns as it devours the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
"The Zsa Zsa Package." Zsa Zsa Gabor rebounds from her troubles, displaying her 
versatility in an array of exciting projects. The Zsa Zsa hot line: She calls 
you. The Zsa Zsa talk show: "No Guests Needed." The Zsa Zsa game show: "What's 
My Age?" The true cornerstones of the package, however, are the dramatic 
projects. The adventure film: "Zsa Zsa Dawn," where a company of British 
soldiers in 19th-Century Africa is ambushed and wiped out by hordes of Zsa 
Zsas. The horror film: "Zsacula," in which Zsa Zsa sucks not only the blood 
from her victims, but also the intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
As a companion, finally, there is the Zsa Zsa Jokebook. Sample: How much is one 
Zsa plus one Zsa? Two Zsas too many.

Kathleen Sullivan believes her days "are numbered" as co-anchor of "CBS This 
Morning" if the show's ratings don't improve. The CBS program is now third 
among network morning shows. Sullivan made her comments on a "Donahue" show 
(seen here Tuesday) that paired her with her opposition, Joan Lunden of ABC's 
"Good Morning America" and Jane Pauley, who is leaving NBC's "Today" at the end 
of this year. "I can't lie about that -- I know the ax is right there," 
Sullivan said. ALEENE MacMINN

GOLDEN YEARS TURN LEADEN IN 'EIGHTIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First came "The Gin Game." Then came "On Golden Pond." Then television got into 
the act with "The Golden Girls." Anyway you slice it, age has been having its 
15 minutes of celebrity throughout the '80s. With any luck, "The Eighties," a 
new play by Tom Cole that opened Monday at the Westwood Playhouse, may be 
signaling the last of those 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"The Eighties" is not about the decade that is drawing to a close, but about 
being in one's 80s -- and it is about as different a view of that landscape as 
it is possible to have from Malcolm Cowley's delicate and inspired book of 
reflections on the subject, "The View From 80." 
</P>
<P>
Granted: To each his own view. But Cole's is depressingly counterfeit. It is 
that of a younger man with limited vision who will write anything for a laugh. 
And it isn't even good dramaturgy. 
</P>
<P>
"The Eighties" offers a day in the life of a long-married octogenarian couple 
from breakfast through lunch, through supper, through midnight snack -- an 
endlessly repetitious cycle of tasks and talk stretching from nowhere to 
nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
The play is, in fact, one and the same ongoing conversation transformed in only 
minor ways by the hour of the day or the nature of the meal at hand. Or not. 
Since food -- present, absent or potentially available -- is the central 
preoccupation here, the play aptly takes place in a kitchen: a gleaming, 
upscale and inviting condo kitchen designed and lit by Kent Dorsey. But since 
Cole depicts his couple as virtually incapable of significant consecutive 
thought, you wonder briefly how these two bumblers manage to keep it so 
spotless. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly, because it is soon apparent that, aside from being full of cliches, 
this play is also full of holes. Cole never provides any genuine information 
about these two except the merest suggestion that they were once apparently 
quite well educated (they spout Latin and know their classical music) and that 
they have four intimidating children who now live elsewhere and call on 
Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
Unconvincingly, the couple's current state of disrepair (more symptomatic of 
108 than 80) would seem to have engulfed the better part of their minds. 
</P>
<P>
The breakfast scene is funny, largely because it is first. She (Audra Lindley) 
complains about slowing down or slowing up (a good 10 minutes is devoted to 
deciding which) while He (James Whitmore) tries to ignore her ramblings and 
read the paper. But after we've heard about all that -- and about the 
difficulty of chopping vegetables -- morning, noon and night, the subject, to 
put it charitably, grows tiresome. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the preoccupation with lunch turns into a preoccupation with sex 
and how best to use the salad topping during the afternoon nap, it's more than 
the cream that's turned sour. 
</P>
<P>
It's not a matter of prudishness, but the sudden recognition that this play 
doesn't have an authentic bone in its body. People in their 80s are not 
automatically deprived of intelligence, dignity or real feelings -- including 
those governing love and sex. What's wrong here is that Cole has nothing to say 
about being 80 that is not derisive or cartoonish. His view is restricted to 
demeaning cliches and a predictable litany of physical ailments catalogued by a 
pair of diminishing minds. If "The Eighties" starts with a bang, it ends with a 
wince. 
</P>
<P>
The actors cannot be blamed for this demoralizing state of affairs, although 
Whitmore overdoes the staggering around as though he were 110 and about to 
expire. Lindley is much more restrained and precise -- and comical -- and even 
manages to distract us now and then from the fact that this is a thoroughly 
minor comedy in the grip of terminal shallowness. 
</P>
<P>
Director Lamont Johnson, who has done some excellent work in other situations, 
might have tempered Whitmore's excesses and insisted on lopping off a good 30 
minutes from this round-robin play. It would not have cured its ills (most 
notably the fact that there is no emotional or other development), but it would 
at least have shortened our misery -- a misery not shared by the traditionally 
enthusiastic and unreliable opening night audience.

A song by award-winning black American singer Tracy Chapman praising jailed 
black leader Nelson Mandela has been banned from South African state radio and 
television. The South African Broadcasting Corp. said Tuesday that "Freedom 
Now" and another song, "Material World," were "undesirable for broadcasting." 
It did not elaborate. The songs may still be played by independent stations.

BIZET AND PROKOFIEV BY MONTREAL SYMPHONY

<P>
On Monday night, things went better for the Montreal Symphony, playing its 
second Music Center concert just 24 hours after making its debut in the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
The accomplishments of the orchestra, which seemed so virtuosic in Hollywood 
Bowl appearances this year and in 1987, have been called into question with 
these two downtown concerts (the ensemble was also scheduled to play Tuesday 
night in Orange County). On Monday, the Montrealers gave a performance more in 
line with the standards they met at the Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The slenderness of the Montreal sound and the transparency of the performances 
Charles Dutoit -- music director of the orchestra for the last dozen years -- 
elicits from it are admirable in themselves, but they may not necessarily 
create sonic lushness or overwhelming musical experiences. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, on Monday, in Alexina Louie's "The Ringing Earth," Bizet's Symphony in 
C and a suite from Prokofiev's ballet score, "Romeo and Juliet," there was not 
a lot of plush sound or mighty noise-making. Still, the orchestra from Quebec 
played handsomely, and with first-rate instrumentalism, superior balances and 
remarkable solo contributions. 
</P>
<P>
And Dutoit's pointed readings of the "Romeo" excerpts, as well as of Bizet's 
youthful symphonic essay, reminded us what a probing musical mind he possesses 
and how rare such a mind is. 
</P>
<P>
Though sometimes more expansive than would be most viable at a danced 
performance, the "Romeo" pieces made all their points compellingly, with utmost 
instrumental articulation and dramatic sweep. At the end, the smallish audience 
gave conductor Dutoit the compliment of a long silence before applause. 
</P>
<P>
The Bizet work remains its irresistible self, nearly 135 years after its 
creation. Dutoit &amp; Co. stressed its inner contrasts, the real weight in its 
Adagio, the natural, but not-too-light buoyancy in the outer movements. It 
became a gem, newly polished. 
</P>
<P>
Louie's post-impressionistic "Ringing Earth" is a brief, minimalist-materials 
overture which invokes bells and descending major scales innocuously. It starts 
nowhere and goes nowhere, but does so in a short time. It was here forgotten 
before it was over.

'CLASS OF 1990': TEENS IN TROUBLE AT ART THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The high school seniors in "The Class of 1990" are in big trouble at the Los 
Angeles Art Theatre. Don Gibble's series of monologues puts them through 
pregnancy, drug overdoses, physical and emotional abuse and psychosis. 
</P>
<P>
Take Tony, played by Gibble. He tells us his father cheated with a secretary; 
she wouldn't accept his ending the affair (shades of "Fatal Attraction") so she 
shot Dad and Mom and herself -- in front of Tony. 
</P>
<P>
He took to drugs and alcohol, joined a gang and ended up in the hospital. A 
nurse took him home with her and turned his life around. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old playwright wants to convey a sense of the pressures teens face 
growing up today. But overkill, and a lack of any real connection between the 
characters, gives the monologues the coloration of overwrought student 
auditions. 
</P>
<P>
The one exception is a sensitive portrait of a pregnant, scared teen-ager 
(Kelly Stone), pathetically desperate to give her baby the love and 
understanding she was denied by her own parents. The mostly teen cast is fine; 
Gibble needs to simplify, connect and deliver his worthy messages with 
emotional truth, not emotional excess. LYNNE HEFFLEY At 11305 Magnolia Blvd., 
North Hollywood, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m., indefinitely. Tickets:

SPECIAL ON GARBAGE CRISIS OFFERS NO EASY SOLUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Out of the Dumps," the latest episode of the KCET series "By the Year 2000," 
airing at 7:30 tonight on Channel 28, takes a quick look at Los Angeles' 
garbage crisis. And, while adding nothing new to the discussion, it is a timely 
reminder that this growing problem will not go away on its own. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County is throwing away 50,000 tons of garbage a day, enough to 
fill the Queen Mary -- a rate that will soon exhaust the county's capacity to 
handle its daily waste. 
</P>
<P>
In the program's opening segment, we see trucks being turned away at the Puente 
Hills landfill -- the largest garbage dump in the county and the second-largest 
in the nation -- at noon each day as the landfill reaches its daily quota. 
These trucks leave, looking for other places to drop their noxious cargo. 
</P>
<P>
The bureaucrats' solution: Enlarge existing landfills and open new ones. The 
problem: Nobody wants one in his back yard. Incineration? Another 
not-in-my-back-yard solution. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of the Dumps" explores the alternatives, offering an in-studio discussion 
with a doctor, city attorney and president of a waste-disposal company and a 
separate interview with Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joy Picus. However, in a 
choppy attempt to be thorough, producer Steve Talley has come up with a show 
that has the look and feel of an extended nightly news segment. MARTIN

ENGINEERS TO CARVE TUNNEL OUT OF COWLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Engineers are preparing to punch a $13-million, 6,300-foot-long tunnel through 
Cowles Mountain in Mission Trails Park, the highest peak in San Diego, as part 
of a 60-mile water pipeline project for the County Water Authority. 
</P>
<P>
The tunnel is a sensitive element in the overall $530-million project to serve 
county growth by building a water delivery system that starts at Lake Skinner 
in Riverside County and ends at Lower Otay Reservoir east of Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and lovers of Cowles Mountain, popular with hikers and 
distinctive for the white "S" shaped into its side by college students decades 
ago, are generally grateful that officials chose to bore a 10.6-foot-diameter 
tunnel rather than chomping across the mountain's western face with a trench. 
</P>
<P>
John Zona and his Dalmatian, named Captain January, stood on a craggy hilltop 
early Monday and watched a helicopter gingerly drop a drill rig and other 
equipment as engineers began exploring how and where to chew a tunnel through 
granite. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a wonderful idea they're going underground rather than over the 
top," Zona said. A trench "would take away all the privacy and commercialize 
the mountain a bit," he said. Zona is a retired civilian employee for the Army 
who has lived in the Cowles Mountain area since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
With a walking stick in one hand and Captain January's leash in the other, Zona 
often finds peace on the mountain. "Since I've been here, I estimate I go up 
there 200 times a year. I know every inch of that mountain," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to bore a tunnel was made after water authority officials met with 
the community and became convinced that alternatives were unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
With a tunnel, "you don't have a scar, and we were concerned about falling 
rocks" during grading, said Mike Stift, a senior civil engineer with the water 
authority. "Basically, we're tunneling through the whole mountain. To do a 
pipeline from North County to South County is a pretty ambitious project." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and community groups appear satisfied with the tunnel option, 
which is supported by the Mission Trails Regional Park Task Force, the Mission 
Trails Regional Park Citizens Advisory Committee, the San Carlos Area Council 
and the Navajo Community Planning Group. The San Diego chapter of the Sierra 
Club has taken no position on the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the best alternative environmentally," said Lou Ann Holmes, an aide 
to San Diego Deputy Mayor Judy McCarty, whose district includes the park. 
</P>
<P>
To design the tunnel, water authority engineers will explore by first drilling 
five core holes to depths of 75 to 185 feet, afterward capping the holes. 
Actual boring will begin in early 1992 and take a year to complete. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Stadler, a spokesman for the water authority, said neither the drilling 
nor the tunneling will interfere with recreation on the mountain. However, some 
residents in neighborhoods in the pipeline path leading to the mountain have 
told water officials at hearings that they are concerned about their streets 
being temporarily dug up for the pipe. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been real vocal about making the disruption as little as possible," 
said Stadler, adding that a final pipeline route through neighborhoods hasn't 
been selected. 
</P>
<P>
The tunnel is part of an 8-mile segment of pipeline that will cross parts of 
San Diego, La Mesa and Lemon Grove. A water authority report acknowledges the 
potential inconvenience, saying that pipeline construction "will be extremely 
difficult and disruptive to the neighborhoods in which it will finally be 
located." 
</P>
<P>
However, the water authority, which provides 90% of the county's water by 
supplying six cities, 17 special districts, the county and Camp Pendleton, 
believes the 60-mile pipeline is critical to serving the county and meeting 
growth demands. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the authority's pipes were laid in the 1940s and occasionally operate 
at peak capacity during warm months, forcing some agencies to rely on their 
stored water. By upgrading the existing water delivery system, it can receive 
water from Southern California's mammoth Metropolitan Water District and 
prepare for growth. 
</P>
<P>
Stift said the county population was about 2 million in 1985 and is projected 
to reach 2.3 million next year and slightly more than 3 million by the year 
2010. The overall project will be completed by 1996 and is funded by bond sales 
and a special assessment per parcel that was authorized by the state 
Legislature.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE / ANTHONY PERRY: INTIMATE HISTORY OF AN ARTFUL LIFE WON'T BE 
ON DISPLAY AT THIS MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alice Goldfarb Marquis does not think of herself as a muckraker. 
</P>
<P>
She's a historian, a visiting scholar at UC San Diego, a former newspaper 
publisher who earned a midlife doctorate and dedicated herself to serious 
research. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago she decided to chronicle the life and artistic times of the late 
Alfred H. Barr Jr., the reserved but iron-willed connoisseur who bestrode the 
art world from 1927 to 1969 as founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
The result was "Alfred H. Barr Jr.: Missionary for the Modern." The New York 
Times called it a "superlative job" of capturing Barr's personality and the 
savagery of art world in-fighting. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction at MOMA has been cool. The book will not be included in the 
museum's Christmas catalogue, nor will it be sold in the bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
Marquis says she had been assured that MOMA was interested. A MOMA spokeswoman 
said the museum never carries biographies, although she declined to explain. 
</P>
<P>
Marquis suspects the museum lions are annoyed because the book discusses Barr's 
coolness, his asexual manner, and his fondness for catering to the whims of 
rich patrons. She also includes heretofore hush-hush financial information. 
</P>
<P>
The museum stonewalled her efforts to obtain purchase figures for individual 
art works. Luckily, much of Barr's private correspondence is being catalogued 
by the Smithsonian Institution and thus is open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting information out of the museum about money is about as easy as getting 
inside the Stealth fighter," said Marquis. "Museums love to tell the public how 
poor they are and how they need support, but they're reluctant to talk real 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Marquis, 59, once published weekly newspapers in the South Bay. Since joining 
academe, she has published her doctoral thesis on Marcel Duchamp and a book on 
the 1930s, "Hopes and Ashes." 
</P>
<P>
"I remember growing up in New York, spending hours at the museum and thinking 
what a wonderful man Alfred Barr must be," she said. "It bugs me that the 
people who now run the museum have decided that I should be the target of 
censorship." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FBI Agent Stays Off Silberman's Case 
</P>
<P>
Retired FBI agent William F. Roemer Jr., one-time head of the bureau's 
organized crime unit in Chicago, says he turned down an offer to help the 
defense in the Dick Silberman money-laundering trial. 
</P>
<P>
In his recently published book, "Roemer: Man Against the Mob," Roemer says he 
was asked for help by Silberman's attorney, James Brosnahan, but declined 
because he has a policy against working on the opposite side of his former FBI 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Roemer said he had never heard of Silberman but is well-acquainted with the 
record of co-defendant Chris Petti. "I remember Chris when he was a minor 
burglar in Chicago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He won't comment on the merits of the case, but he predicted that Brosnahan's 
expected challenge to the "roving" wiretap law that was used against Silberman 
will fail. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that, although the law is new, the process is not. The FBI bugged 
seven public telephones in Tucson to get information to convict mobster Joe 
Bonanno, Roemer said. 
</P>
<P>
"The statute may be new, but the whole idea of tapping public phones has been 
tested and upheld in court," Roemer said.

COUNCIL TORN BETWEEN HIGH-RISES; 
</P>
<P>
CITY HALL: POSSIBLE CONFLICT OF INTEREST PREVENTS ABBE WOLFSHEIMER FROM CASTING 
TIE-BREAKING VOTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the nine-member San Diego City Council were writing a book, it might be 
called "A Tale of Two High-Rises." Only trouble is, the council keeps adding 
chapters but can't agree on an ending. 
</P>
<P>
Four members favor the Huntington, a 36-story, $91-million luxury condominium 
project proposed by the Koll Co. and Davidson Communities Inc. for the 
southwest corner of Broadway and State Street, a prime piece of city-owned land 
surrounded by the towers of downtown's resurgence. 
</P>
<P>
Four others prefer Huntington's competitor, a 30-story, $44-million high-rent 
apartment building called simply 900 State Street and proposed by A. J. Lirot 
of El Dorado Asset Management and his partner, Trammell Crow Co. 
</P>
<P>
Try as it might for the past few months, the City Council has been unable to 
reach a majority decision. The council failed again Tuesday, deadlocking 4 to 4 
on separate votes for each project. On the side of the Huntington were Ron 
Roberts, Gloria McColl, Bruce Henderson and Ed Struiksma. Backing 900 State 
Street were Mayor Maureen O'Connor, Bob Filner, Wes Pratt and Judy McCarty. 
</P>
<P>
Another vote is scheduled in three weeks, when, according to the mayor, 
Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer will be available to cast the tie-breaking vote. 
</P>
<P>
But Wolfsheimer's chief aide says the councilwoman has no intention of voting. 
Wolfsheimer, who owns a Marina Park condominium near the contested property, 
believes that such a vote might constitute a conflict-of-interest violation of 
the state Political Reform Act. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't depend on her. This has to be resolved by negotiations among the 
eight of them," said Wolfsheimer's aide, Joanne Johnson. She added that an 
outside legal opinion may not be available until December or January. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said Wolfsheimer is unsatisfied with the conflict-of-interest analysis 
provided by City Atty. John Witt and the financial analysis provided by City 
Manager John Lockwood, who concluded that, by voting for one of the high-rises, 
the councilwoman would not sufficiently increase the value of her condominium 
to create a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council's discussion after the tie vote indicated that they assumed 
Wolfsheimer was close to receiving an opinion from a private attorney. But 
Johnson said Wolfsheimer has not hired an attorney and has no plans to do so. 
Instead, she said, the councilwoman will probably rely on advice from the state 
Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfsheimer left council chambers during the high-rise debate, her absence 
particularly noticeable because, unlike her colleagues, she was dressed for 
Halloween in a "Hairy Sterling" outfit consisting of a judge's robe on which 
knives, forks and spoons were taped. Her head was covered with a cotton-white 
fright wig. 
</P>
<P>
The council again discussed the merits of the proposed buildings -- from height 
and design to street-level accommodations -- and the city's potential financial 
windfall. 
</P>
<P>
"What you have are two very good projects," said City Architect Mike Stepner, 
telling the council: "It's a judgment call." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney James Milch, representing the developers of the $130-million, 30-story 
Emerald Shapery Center under construction across Broadway from the high-rise 
site, described the 470-foot-tall Huntington as massive and bulky, calling it a 
"monolithic wall" that would block Emerald Shapery's southern views. He called 
on the council to approve 900 State Street, a more slender and shorter edifice 
at 400 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said that, if the deadlock continues, the city should "go back to 
square one." 
</P>
<P>
Such a prospect is disquieting to Pam Hamilton, head of Centre City Development 
Corp., the agency in charge of downtown redevelopment that reviewed the 
projects before recommending the Huntington. However, the agency's board also 
told the council that, if the Huntington was rejected, it approves of 900 State 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said after the council meeting that she hopes the council will realize 
that going with its second choice is better than starting the bidding process 
again.

SUSPENDED OFFICER SAYS POLICE USED SITTER AS SPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suspended Los Angeles police officer claimed Tuesday in court that the Police 
Department violated her rights when it used her former baby-sitter to secretly 
search her West Hills home during an investigation of the officer's alleged 
sexual misconduct with a 17-year-old student. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Oborn, 33, a four-year veteran who has been on suspension without pay 
for nearly two years, is suing the Police Department and her former 
baby-sitter, Allyson Di Conti, 23, for $10 million, charging that her rights 
against unlawful search and seizure were violated. 
</P>
<P>
During his opening argument in U. S. District Court, Oborn's lawyer, Stephen 
Yagman, said the police Internal Affairs Division used Di Conti as its "agent" 
during their March, 1987, investigation of allegations that Oborn had sexual 
relations with a German youth who had stayed in her 
</P>
<P>
home a year earlier as a foreign-exchange student. 
</P>
<P>
Oborn, an unmarried mother of four who was assigned to a Parker Center vice 
unit at the time of the investigation, married the student, Andre Rossky, when 
he was 19 years old, Yagman said. Oborn has denied having a sexual relationship 
with Rossky while he was a juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
Yagman said evidence in the case proves that Di Conti acted under "color of 
law," or as a police officer, when she helped gather evidence against Oborn. He 
told the six-member jury that Di Conti wore a secret recording device and took 
letters, a cassette tape and other property belonging to Oborn during a March 
27, 1987, visit to Oborn's Blythe Street home. 
</P>
<P>
"Allyson Di Conti was working as an agent of the Internal Affairs Division," 
Yagman said. "They were conducting a covert operation" and illegally searched 
the home. 
</P>
<P>
However, Di Conti's attorney, Shirley Warren, said Di Conti was a civilian 
informant who volunteered to help the police because she believed the 
relationship between Oborn and Rossky was emotionally harmful to Oborn's 
children. Warren said Di Conti was invited into the home on March 27, 1987, and 
took Oborn's property even though Internal Affairs officers told her not to 
take anything. 
</P>
<P>
Di Conti, the trial's first witness, testified she contacted police after she 
saw Oborn and Rossky engaged in a sexual act in a friend's garage. She said she 
later agreed to wear a recording device, but officers told her not to take any 
property from the house. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told . . . to get her to talk," Di Conti said. "I wasn't told to take 
anything out of the house." 
</P>
<P>
The trial before U. S. District Judge Jesse W. Curtis Jr. is scheduled to 
continue today.

SANTA CLARITA COUNCIL REFUSES TO REGULATE MOBILE HOME RENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council, turning down a request from residents of mobile 
home parks, has declined to enact an ordinance that would have placed a limit 
on rents at 22 parks in the city. 
</P>
<P>
But council members warned the owners of mobile home parks that they might 
consider such an ordinance in the future if rents begin to skyrocket. "They 
start jacking up rents, I'll be willing to come down real hard," Councilman 
Carl Boyer III said Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the council will organize a meeting between residents and owners of 
mobile home parks to discuss what residents say are exorbitant rent increases 
at many parks. Council members said they would rather see the residents and 
owners work out the problem themselves with some city assistance. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clarita Mobile Home Owners Area Council had asked the council to 
adopt an ordinance, patterned after a measure in Oceanside in San Diego County, 
that would have outlawed annual rent increases above 8%. Under the proposal, 
mobile home park owners could receive permission for larger increases under 
special circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Don Wilder, president of the mobile home group, said the ordinance would allow 
park owners a fair return on their investment while protecting park tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Wilder said there are 22 mobile home parks with 2,200 spaces in Santa Clarita. 
More than 7,500 people live in the parks, he said, paying rents ranging from 
$300 to $473 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, rents have risen dramatically, Wilder said. Some 
mobile home park owners raise rents 15% a year, he said. Most park residents 
are senior citizens on fixed incomes, and many fear they will be forced out of 
their homes by rising rents, Wilder said. 
</P>
<P>
"Their desire for affordable living has been jeopardized," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The council said it needs detailed information on rents at mobile home parks 
before it can act on an ordinance. But council members agreed that many park 
residents are having trouble paying their monthly rent. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is not getting any better," Councilwoman Jo Anne Darcy said. "It's 
getting to an unbearable point." 
</P>
<P>
Boyer said the council receives more mail complaining about rents at mobile 
home parks than any other issue. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Dennis Koontz suggested that the city write to each park owner and 
request that they hold off raising rents until city officials can investigate 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll tell you to take a walk," Darcy replied.

COUNCIL REJECTS PLACING TRAILERS FOR HOMELESS ON CHURCH LAND 
</P>

Trailers for homeless families will not be allowed on the grounds of a 
Sepulveda church, the Los Angeles City Council ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Sepulveda Unitarian-Universality Society applied more than a year ago to 
have two city-owned mobile homes moved onto church property near Haskell Avenue 
and Plummer Street. The trailers are part of a city program to provide 
temporary housing for homeless families. 
</P>
<P>
The vote Tuesday was 8 to 5 in support of an appeal by church neighbors seeking 
to overturn an earlier decision by the Board of Zoning Appeals in favor of the 
plan. Opposing the appeal were council members Ruth Galanter, Nate Holden, Zev 
Yaroslavsky, Ernani Bernardi and Joel Wachs. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the council came within one vote of barring the trailers -- 7 to 
4 -- but eight votes were needed to make a majority. 
</P>
<P>
No public hearing was held Tuesday, but neighbors have said the area is too far 
from jobs and services the homeless need and have expressed fears about safety. 
</P>
<P>
Church representatives said those fears were ill-founded. They said that two 
major bus routes run near the site and that under the city-sponsored program, 
services are provided directly to the trailer residents. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents the area in which the church is located, 
sided with the neighbors after they agreed to consider allowing permanent 
housing for the homeless or low-income housing on church property. 
</P>
<P>
Church officials have said they have no money to establish permanent housing, 
but Bernson asked city staff members to investigate what grant or loan programs 
might be applicable. 
</P>
<P>
The city homeless trailer program began more than two years ago when Mayor Tom 
Bradley initiated the purchase of 102 mobile homes from a Utah construction 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, only 61 trailers have been placed, most of them on public land such 
as housing projects.

COUNCIL OKS $150,000 FOR NORTH-SOUTH LIGHT-RAIL STUDY; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: A PROPOSED ROUTE ALONG SAN FERNANDO ROAD FROM SYLMAR TO 
DOWNTOWN IS THE THIRD TO BE STUDIED FOR THE VALLEY. 
</P>

<P>
The Los Angeles City Council agreed Tuesday to spend $150,000 to study a third 
commuter rail route through the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The route would run north-south along San Fernando Road from Sylmar to downtown 
Los Angeles. The environmental impact of two proposed east-west routes for a 
commuter train is being reviewed by the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The number of public transit riders along the proposed San Fernando Road 
corridor exceeds the number who use public transit along the two routes being 
studied by the county. But the county commission has already rejected the San 
Fernando Road corridor as a possible commuter rail route. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners maintain that an east-west line connecting Warner Center with 
downtown should be of higher priority than a north-south route because it would 
relieve Ventura Freeway congestion. 
</P>
<P>
The council first considered spending $150,000 in Proposition A transit funds 
to have the county commission study the San Fernando Road route in October, 
1988. Councilman Michael Woo proposed paying for the study to keep the 
north-south route in the running with the other two routes. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Nate Holden held up the proposal in the council Transportation 
Committee. Holden, who chairs that committee, is a staunch advocate of the San 
Fernando Road route, but maintains that the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission should pay for the study. 
</P>
<P>
The study is expected to cost about $200,000. The Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors voted last year to pay $50,000 of the study's cost. 
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, the council voted unanimously to establish a Rail Priority Task 
Force of city staff members, which will keep track of proposed rail projects 
and report on them to the council. 
</P>
<P>
The light-rail commuter trains and Metro Rail subway are being considered as a 
means of mass transit for the Valley. The estimated costs of building the two 
options range from $750 million for a light-rail route to about $3 billion for 
the subway.

KLVANA DIDN'T REALIZE HIS SHORTCOMINGS WERE DEADLY, DEFENSE ARGUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
An attorney for Dr. Milos Klvana told a jury Tuesday that the Valencia 
obstetrician is at worst guilty of manslaughter in a case in which he faces 
nine counts of second-degree murder in the deaths of eight infants and a fetus 
that he treated at his clinics instead of at hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Richard A. Leonard, in his closing arguments before a Los 
Angeles Superior Court jury, conceded that Klvana was a terrible practitioner 
of high-risk medicine but did not know his shortcomings were deadly -- 
knowledge that is a legal prerequisite for Klvana to be found guilty of murder. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to stand up here and tell you Dr. Klvana is Dr. Marcus Welby," 
Leonard said. "But he's not a murderer." 
</P>
<P>
Klvana, 49, is charged with nine counts of second-degree murder in the deaths 
of eight infants and a fetus between 1982 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution has alleged that Klvana caused the nine deaths by mismanaging 
high-risk pregnancies in which complications arose during delivery. In each 
case, Klvana failed to recommend hospital treatment when it became necessary, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Brian R. Kelberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the nine deaths resulted from Klvana's misuse of Pitocin, a 
labor-inducing drug that expert witnesses have testified should only be used in 
hospitals equipped with proper monitoring devices. Klvana's clinics in Valencia 
and Temple City lacked such equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Klvana is being prosecuted under the same legal theory as that used to obtain 
second-degree murder convictions against drunk drivers who cause fatal traffic 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Under that theory, known as implied malice, a defendant can be convicted of 
murder if the prosecution proves that the defendant knew his actions could 
cause someone's death. 
</P>
<P>
Kelberg has maintained during the six-month trial that the 
Czechoslovakian-trained doctor's failed obstetrics residency at a New York City 
hospital and a subsequent residency in anesthesiology at Loma Linda University 
Medical Center -- during which he was blamed for the 1976 death of a healthy 
patient -- made Klvana aware that he was incapable of handling risky medical 
situations. Kelberg said the deaths of the babies for which he is being tried 
further alerted him to his inadequacies. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Leonard acknowledged that Klvana was negligent in the nine deaths. 
But he suggested that Klvana's negligence was at worst manslaughter in five of 
the nine deaths. He said that others also were to blame for the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard suggested that in several deaths the infants' parents were partly 
negligent because they did not rush their babies to the hospital when they 
turned blue or had trouble breathing. He also attacked the credibility of two 
mothers whose babies died, alleging that one had participated in insurance 
fraud and another had undergone seven abortions. 
</P>
<P>
He attacked doctors at Loma Linda for not reporting to medical authorities 
Klvana's poor record of treating patients. He also noted that the state Board 
of Medical Quality Assurance reviewed several of Klvana's cases but took no 
action against his license. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the murder charges, Klvana is charged with more than 40 other 
felonies, including insurance fraud, grand theft, perjury and conspiracy. 
Leonard said those felony charges were added to the case to "dirty up" Klvana 
and to make it easier for the jury to view him as a murderer. 
</P>
<P>
In the prosecution's rebuttal argument Tuesday, Kelberg said that Leonard's 
pejorative characterizations of some of the parents were irrelevant. He noted 
that Judge Judith C. Chirlin had instructed the jury not to consider the acts 
of any others in determining whether Klvana had been criminally negligent. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to Leonard's point that doctors at Loma Linda and elsewhere should 
have reported Klvana's poor record, Kelberg said Loma Linda doctors had tried 
to steer Klvana away from high-risk medicine. He added that state medical board 
investigators "deserve lambasting" but alleged that Klvana's lies to 
investigators made it difficult for them to reach a proper conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
During Kelberg's rebuttal, Klvana jumped to his feet and said, "I want to 
testify, this man is crazy." While a bailiff forcibly escorted him from the 
courtroom, Klvana's wife, Svata, stood up in the spectators' area and denounced 
Kelberg. Chirlin ordered her to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Klvana, who earlier had waived his right to testify, made a similar outburst 
last Thursday, and Chirlin instructed the jury to ignore it. 
</P>
<P>
Jury deliberations are expected to begin today. A single count of second-degree 
murder carries a penalty of 15 years to life in prison.

STUDY ORDERED ON CINEMA PROJECT; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: COUNCILWOMAN SAYS TRAFFIC FROM VAN NUYS COMPLEX WOULD SPILL INTO 
NEIGHBORHOOD. 
</P>

<P>
The Los Angeles City Council has ordered developer Ira Smedra, embroiled in a 
dispute over development of a Studio City carwash site, to prepare an 
environmental impact report for a Van Nuys project opposed by nearby residents. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted unanimously Tuesday to require Smedra to prepare the report 
for a cinema complex that he wants to build in the 16300 block of Sherman Way 
in western Van Nuys. In August, the council ordered Smedra to study the 
environmental impact of a mini-mall that he wants to build on land occupied by 
a now-closed Studio City carwash, gas station and restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joy Picus, who represents the Van Nuys area where Smedra wants to 
build an eight-screen cinema, restaurant and commercial center, said traffic 
from the development would spill into surrounding neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Picus was particularly critical of Smedra's plan for handling parking at the 
complex, which she said would discourage theatergoers from using the parking 
lot. The plan allows parked cars to block others in when the lot gets full. The 
drivers would leave their keys with attendants to permit the double-parked cars 
to be moved. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that young people going to the theaters will not use that valet 
parking," said Picus, who said her concerns were prompted by complaints from 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
But Smedra said in an interview that Picus misunderstood his parking plan. He 
said that if the 663-space lot were to fill up, late arrivals would leave their 
keys with attendants and pick them up again when they leave the show. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the thing to do these days, the politically popular thing," said Smedra, 
referring to the council's decision to require him to prepare an environmental 
impact report. "Unfortunately some council members don't want to work with 
developers." 
</P>
<P>
Smedra has filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court to overturn the 
council's August demand that he present an environmental impact report for the 
project at the Studio City site. He said he will consider filing another suit 
to reverse Tuesday's council decision. 
</P>
<P>
He said environmental impact reports are "very costly, very time-consuming." 
</P>
<P>
The Studio City suit, filed Oct. 13, contends that Smedra followed all city 
rules and met all city staff requirements in proposing and planning his 
mini-mall. 
</P>
<P>
Picus said she decided to bring the Van Nuys project directly to the council 
Tuesday, rather than waiting for it to be brought to the council through the 
normal committee process, because she had been told that the Building and 
Safety Department intended to allow it go forward without an environmental 
impact report. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the report, Smedra would have had to meet certain other conditions. 
Most of those conditions would have involved providing additional parking and 
widening streets, Picus and Smedra said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Building and Safety Department knowledgeable about Smedra's 
project could not be reached for comment Tuesday.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOUSE FIRE CAUSES $350,000 IN DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fire that burned for more than 90 minutes Tuesday caused $350,000 in damage 
to a house in Thousand Oaks, the Ventura County Fire Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze in the 1300 block of Lamont Avenue may have been started by an 
improperly vented dryer, dispatcher Vicki Crabtree said. No injuries from the 
fire were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters thought that the blaze was under control about 40 minutes after it 
started about 2:40 p.m., but flames had spread undetected to the attic, 
Crabtree said. A second alarm was reported, and the fire was finally contained 
at 4:12 p.m., she said.

HOTEL BEING RENOVATED FOR SENIORS BURNS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
More than 150 firefighters battled a four-alarm blaze that lighted the pre-dawn 
sky in downtown San Diego Tuesday and destroyed the unoccupied New Palace 
Hotel, the Fire Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The fire prompted the evacuation of 43 residents of a nearby building. 
</P>
<P>
The New Palace was being renovated for senior housing. It is owned by the San 
Diego Kind Corp., a nonprofit organization headed by Mavourneen O'Connor, twin 
sister of Mayor Maureen O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters responding to a call at the 400 block of Elm Street at 1:55 a.m. 
found the three-story structure engulfed in flames, San Diego Fire Department 
spokesman Larry Stewart said. The fire ripped through the 100-room structure, 
leaving a wobbly concrete shell that was deemed unsafe Tuesday afternoon and 
scheduled for demolition. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of damage requires complete demolition, and we'll take a little bit 
apart at a time to see what happened," said Jeff Carle, captain of the Metro 
Arson Strike Team. It might take several days to determine the cause of the 
fire, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Surveying the damage from atop a fire engine's ladder suspended over the 
smoldering structure, Carle said the interior of the charred building would be 
off limits -- even to fire investigators -- until a demolition crew removes 
unstable debris. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is going in until I know this thing is not going to come down on my 
head," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Upon arriving, firefighters evacuated eight transients from the burning 
structure. The transients were unhurt, but two firefighters were injured 
battling the blaze. They were treated at area hospitals and released. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters also evacuated neighboring Central Manor, a board-and-care home, 
and hosed its roof. Although it is only a few feet from the hotel, Central 
Manor was undamaged, Stewart said, and residents were permitted to return 
Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was contained within three hours. 
</P>
<P>
Mavourneen O'Connor, reached by phone Tuesday afternoon, said the fire posed a 
serious setback to the renovation. 
</P>
<P>
The project, partly funded by the state Department of Housing, was targeted for 
completion in September, 1990, O'Connor said. She was unable to estimate when 
work would resume on the senior center or when it will be completed. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, grateful that most of the hotel's tapestries and furniture had been 
removed for refurbishing, said she is determined to complete the project. 
</P>
<P>
"We're certainly going to give it an Irish try," she said.

POLICE PUSH TO TAKE BACK STREETS FROM DRUG SELLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
From her Harbor City apartment, Alice can see for miles. Her view includes the 
Vincent Thomas Bridge in San Pedro and the twinkling lights of the Unocal 
Refinery in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
Closer to home, the sights are far less appealing -- graffiti on the sidewalk; 
drug dealers in the street, flagging down cars and passing out crack cocaine 
like candy; gang shootings; children, some as young as 8, handcuffed and carted 
off in police cruisers. 
</P>
<P>
But Alice doesn't want to talk about what she sees. Nor does she, like most who 
live near the intersection of 252nd Street and Marigold Avenue, want to give 
her last name. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you," she said. "I live by myself. I have to think of my life." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department's Harbor Division says the corner of 252nd 
and Marigold, and the blocks that surround it, make up the busiest -- and most 
dangerous -- drug-dealing area in the Harbor Division, and one of the busiest 
in the city. Since the beginning of the year, 205 narcotics arrests have been 
made at 252nd and Marigold alone. A recent sting operation in the neighborhood, 
in which police posed as drug dealers and buyers, netted 54 arrests in four 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a cesspool," said Capt. Joseph De Ladurantey, the division's commanding 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
So last week, the police tried to turn the tide. For four nights, half a dozen 
officers barricaded a four-block area and stopped every car that came into the 
neighborhood -- not to make arrests but to give residents like Alice some 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not here to take people to jail," said Don Linfield, the officer in 
charge of the operation. "We're here as a suppression effort. We're just making 
our presence known, to let these people (gangs and drug dealers) know they 
don't own the streets anymore." 
</P>
<P>
The blockade was the first step in what De Ladurantey said will be a 
months-long effort to restore order to the community, "to take back the 
sidewalks and the streets and give them back" to law-abiding residents. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledges that it will not be an easy task. The dealers have a tight hold 
on the Marigold Avenue neighborhood -- so tight, police say, that dealers have 
ordered residents to lock their dogs indoors at night so they can skip through 
the back yards and alleys to avoid getting caught. And the fearful residents 
have complied. 
</P>
<P>
One resident, who gave his name only as Nelson, said drug dealers used to hide 
their guns under his car and threatened to burn his house down if he or his 
family gave them any trouble. Gunfire, he said, is common 
</P>
<P>
"You hear gunshots; it's like being on a farm, you hear chickens," he said. 
</P>
<P>
De Ladurantey expects it to take months of intermittent police crackdowns for 
residents to feel comfortable enough to walk outside at night. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood blockade was similar to a recent crackdown in the Pico-Union 
area of Los Angeles, although tiny in comparison. 
</P>
<P>
In the Pico-Union blockade, up to 160 officers barricaded a square-mile area. 
They posted 20 barriers with large signs reading "Narcotics Enforcement Zone, 
Residents Only." Some residents reported that drug dealing declined in the area 
but picked up in outlying blocks. 
</P>
<P>
In the Harbor City crackdown, police used sawhorse barriers and yellow police 
tape -- but no signs -- to block off the junctions of 252nd and Normandie 
Avenue and 252nd and Petroleum Avenue.

PADRES FIRE NEW PITCH TO DAVIS 
</P>

The Padres, in hopes that reliever Mark Davis forgets all about this free-agent 
business, offered him a new contract proposal Tuesday, one which they believe 
will convince him to remain in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
While awaiting their answer, the Padres went ahead Tuesday and contacted Arn 
Tellem, the agent for free-agent pitcher Mark Langston, informing him that they 
will pursue the left-handed starter. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very interested in him," said Chicago attorney Fred Lane, who will 
conduct the negotiations for the Padres, "and I think they're very interested 
in us." 
</P>
<P>
Lane, who along with La Jolla attorney Beth Benes is conducting the Davis 
negotiations for the Padres, said however that the Padres' first priority in 
the free-agent market continues to be Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a left-hander who saved a Padre-record 44 games in 1989 and was selected 
as The Sporting News' National League pitcher of the year, filed for free 
agency Monday night. But before Davis' agent, Alan Hendricks, even had a chance 
to test the marketplace, the Padres had a new contract proposal awaiting 
Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"We had already made them a fabulous offer, but we made them even a more 
fabulous offer after we learned that they filed for free agency," Lane said. 
"We wanted to give Mark something to think about. 
</P>
<P>
"We want Mark to know that we're very sincere, and how much the Padres want 
him. He knows that from our words. And now he knows that from our numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Lane refused to reveal the Padres' offer, saying, "I don't want to educate my 
competition," but it is believed that it is a three-year guaranteed contract 
for at least $7 million with possibly an option for a fourth year. 
</P>
<P>
Davis was unaware of the Padres' new offer Tuesday. Hendricks, his agent, was 
undergoing foot surgery, Davis said, but he's expected to speak with him today 
and discuss the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming back to San Diego is still my first choice," Davis said. "Just because 
I filed for free agency doesn't mean that I'm not even thinking about San 
Diego, that's far from my intention. I just want to protect myself." 
</P>
<P>
Davis would not disclose how much it will take for the Padres to keep him, but 
said that he's seeking a four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
"A contract for more than three years is something I'd definitely like," Davis 
said. "I know they're not common, but it's something I think a team and a 
player could work out." 
</P>
<P>
Said Lane: "We can probably work out anything, but we don't want to do 
something nuts. I'm certain everything will work out. We're going to get him; 
we're going to get him. 
</P>
<P>
"This offer is something that'll be so attractive to him that he'll have to 
take it now." 
</P>
<P>
And if Davis and Hendricks continue to explore the possibilities of the 
free-agent market? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, in that case," Lane said, "I'll just hope he's not interested in the 
teams that are interested in him." 
</P>
<P>
While in the marketing mood Tuesday, the Padres officially launched their claim 
in the Langston sweepstakes. They are considered to be among Langston's top 
three choices, along with the Dodgers and Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
It's unknown just how much it will cost to lure Langston to the Padres, but 
it's almost certain that he will become the highest-paid pitcher in baseball, 
exceeding $3 million a year. The Padres, and every other team with the 
exception of the Montreal Expos, are not allowed to negotiate with Langston or 
discuss monetary terms until after Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
If the Padres are successful in acquiring Langston, 12-9, 2.39 ERA, they would 
enter the 1990 season with perhaps the strongest pitching rotation in the 
National League: Bruce Hurst, Ed Whitson, Eric Show, Andy Benes and Langston. 
It also would enable them to package one or two pitchers along with a catcher 
to obtain a starting center fielder. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres also could be in the market for other free agents, such as 
outfielder Hubie Brooks and first baseman Keith Hernandez, but have yet to 
decide if they'll pursue any others besides Langston. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have to sit down, get a list together, and discuss just who fits our 
needs," said Tony Siegle, Padre vice president, player personnel. "It's quite 
obvious we can't sign everybody." 
</P>
<P>
In reality, they'd be ecstatic just to sign a certain pair of left-handers.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: NEW BASEBALL STADIUM TO BE BUILT AT SDSU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 1,500 seat stadium will be built at San Diego State's Charlie Smith Field 
with funds coming from an anonymous benefactor, Aztec baseball Coach Jim Dietz 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,500 seats would replace the aluminum bleachers that seat 1,000. Plans are 
to add two 500-seat wings down the right and left-field lines and increase the 
right-field seating to 1,000 to some day give Smith Field a capacity of 3,500. 
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with the donation, SDSU will host a fundraiser at Smith Field on 
Nov. 11 at 3 p.m. The model of the project will be unveiled at that time. 
</P>
<P>
Dietz and Athletic Director Fred Miller said that the donation is not 
particularly tied to the turnout at the fundraiser, but that the donor does 
want to determine if there is interest in SDSU's baseball program. 
</P>
<P>
Previous plans for Smith Field had called for aluminum seating with backs to 
replace the bleacher-style seats currently in place and to eventually add new 
concession stands, a clubhouse and press box. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said it was premature to release any dollar figures regarding the 
donation and the eventual build-out plans for Smith Field. 
</P>
<P>
"We really do need to find out where we stand (in the community)," Dietz said. 
"Which we will on Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Dietz said that ESPN was prepared to televise an Aztec game during the upcoming 
season but later told him that the facilities were substandard and they would 
instead televise the Aztecs playing at Fresno State. He also noted that SDSU's 
bids to host the Western Athletic Conference tournament and NCAA regionals have 
been turned down because of the school's poor facilities. 
</P>
<P>
CHARGERS 
</P>
<P>
Chargers Coach Dan Henning said he has decided who will start at quarterback 
for Sunday's game against the Philadelphia Eagles, but that he won't make an 
announcement until he meets with the players today. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll tell the quarterback's (today)," Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
Henning was then asked if he had made the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Pretty much," Henning said. "But that means if I tell you, then I have to call 
all of them to tell them. I have pretty much an idea of who it will be. When 
they come in (today), we'll tell them how to practice and who to prepare to 
start the game." 
</P>
<P>
AZTECS 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State running back Darrin Wagner missed his second day of practice 
because of illness but he might return to workouts today, Coach Al Luginbill 
said. Reserve linebacker Thane Fisher could return for Saturday night's game 
against New Mexico after missing last Saturday's game because of a broken hand. 
</P>
<P>
VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma Nazarene College was dropped from the District 3 NAIA Tournament 
after losing its first match to Biola, 9-15, 15-12, 15-13, 15-7. Lynett 
Campbell and Janelle Dutton each had 17 kills for Point Loma (14-9). Biola 
improved to 20-12. 
</P>
<P>
Jenifer Dodson had nine kills as UC San Diego defeated Cal State Los Angeles, 
15-4, 13-15, 15-3, 15-4. The Lady Tritons improved to 18-12.

THE HIGH SCHOOLS: MURPHY TAKES HEART IN VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Simi Valley High's losing streak in football is over -- and none too soon for 
Dave Murphy, the embattled coach of the team. 
</P>
<P>
Over the course of 17 losses in a row, Murphy had attempted to remain upbeat 
while his critics wondered aloud how much longer he could retain his post. 
</P>
<P>
And of course, there were the snide remarks and jokes from the periphery. All 
that, he could handle. 
</P>
<P>
"You put things in perspective," he said. "You definitely look at yourself in 
the mirror and ask yourself, 'Are you doing what's right?' And the answer was 
always, 'Yes, you're doing it right.' " 
</P>
<P>
It was after a game earlier this season when Murphy began to feel the most 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
He had arrived home to his family after another loss, when his 4-year-old 
daughter observed, "Boy, you guys never win. When are we gonna win, Dad?" 
</P>
<P>
"That kinda hurt," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy is well aware that one victory in 18 attempts does not turn a program 
around, even if it happens to be a 21-3 decision over Royal, Simi Valley's 
cross-town rival. 
</P>
<P>
But it's a small step. One for which Murphy is grateful. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me, over the past two years there have been many trying times," he 
said. "It was a great test, and thank God it's over. 
</P>
<P>
"We're on a winning streak." 
</P>
<P>
Add Simi Valley: One would have expected that, as the losing streak grew, so 
too would Murphy's imagination. Triple reverses, flea-flickers, hook and 
laterals -- all kinds of unorthodox plays in an endeavor to win a ballgame. 
</P>
<P>
However, when the Pioneers won their first game since 1987, it was with only 
six different offensive plays. 
</P>
<P>
All six were out of the triple option, and all six with Eric Hale at 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Hale replaced Aaron Fisher, who moved from quarterback to running back and 
gained 137 yards in 26 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Hale, who entered the game as the Marmonte League's leading rusher, passed only 
twice but ran for three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, so basic was the Simi Valley offense that, of the team's first 11 
offensive plays of the fourth quarter, nine were the same: Hale on the triple 
option to the left side of the field. 
</P>
<P>
"We were going to run the option until they stopped us," Murphy said. "Hale 
graded out at 80% on reading the triple option. Our kids really executed, 
played really well." 
</P>
<P>
Bottomed out: As a result of the loss, Royal is 0-4 in the league (2-6 
overall), a game behind Camarillo and Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-3 streak-breaker came eight days after the Highlanders had given 
undefeated Thousand Oaks all it could handle before losing, 28-21. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Coach Gene Uebelhardt, however, was gracious in defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"The better team won," he said. "They came out and stuck it to us." 
</P>
<P>
Of his own team, he was a tad less gracious. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they played below expectations of their coaches and their fans," 
Uebelhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
Injury report: Chris Foster is back. So is Cory Bowen. But Dale Soliz is out 
and so is Brian Sturges, both likely for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Foster, Thousand Oaks' starting fullback and defensive tackle, injured his knee 
against Camarillo but will play Friday against Warren, as will Bowen, a 
sophomore who saw substantial time at running back before spraining his ankle 
against Royal. 
</P>
<P>
Soliz, a starter at offensive tackle, stretched ligaments in his knee Friday 
against Westlake and will be in a cast for four weeks. He will be replaced by 
Matt Buchanan and Neil O'Connell. Sturges, a starting linebacker and part-time 
fullback, chipped a bone in his elbow in the Royal game and underwent surgery 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Restraining order: Chaminade tailback Colin Havert, the second-leading rusher 
in the Valley with 1,146 yards and 21 touchdowns, sustained a slight shoulder 
separation in practice last week and did not play Saturday in the Eagles' 17-7 
victory over Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Rich Lawson said Monday that Havert would be out for the next two weeks 
and would be questionable for the Eagles' first playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
Then, he changed his mind. "Nah," he said. "He'll play that first playoff game 
unless the doctor says no." 
</P>
<P>
Havert could barely stand sitting out one game. In the fourth quarter Saturday 
with the score tied, 7-7, he freed his arm from its sling and began to gingerly 
windmill it as if to signal his availability to Lawson. 
</P>
<P>
The coach knew better and ignored the gesture. "I know the kid's a competitor 
and he wants to get in there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Underclass gas: San Fernando tailback LaKarlos Townsend rushed for 167 yards 
and two touchdowns in only five carries in a 27-7 win over Taft last week. 
Townsend, reportedly the fastest player on the team, is only a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
Did Taft get a good look at San Fernando's speed of the future? Well, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
"What we saw was a lot of the Taft defense," Taft Coach Tom Stevenson said. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that everyone can expect to see more of Townsend in the backfield; he 
also plays in the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't really know the offense until not too long ago," San Fernando Coach 
Tom Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
And San Fernando losing its first three games by lopsided scores didn't help 
the cause of the young running back either. 
</P>
<P>
West Valley woes: Who's best in the West? Perhaps nobody, according to one 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the first week of West Valley League play Friday, only Cleveland (3-3, 
2-2) has its head -- more like the tip of its nose -- above water, record-wise. 
</P>
<P>
Taft, El Camino Real and Canoga Park all enter league play with 1-3 marks after 
four Northwest Valley Conference games. 
</P>
<P>
In the City Section 4-A Division, three teams from each league advance to the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't matter who's good in our league," Taft Coach Tom Stevenson said. 
"It's who's bad." 
</P>
<P>
Want ads: San Fernando baseball Coach Steve Marden is seeking varsity and 
junior varsity teams from the same school to participate in San Fernando's 
six-team preseason tournament Feb. 21, 22, 27 and March 1. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills, Poly, Grant and Franklin already have committed to play in the 
round-robin event. 
</P>
<P>
Psyched up: For two weeks before the Royal High girls' volleyball team played 
Thousand Oaks, Highlander players read sports psychology material borrowed from 
the Cal State Northridge women's team, ranked seventh in the NCAA Division II. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed to establish that we could beat them," Royal Coach Bob Ferguson 
said. "I think there was some doubt." 
</P>
<P>
Royal, which had lost to Thousand Oaks six consecutive times, fell behind, 
14-6, in the first game but never never lost confidence and came back to upset 
previously undefeated Thousand Oaks, 19-17, 15-11, 15-7.

JAPANESE FIRM TO BUY GEN-PROBE FOR $110.6 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In yet another Japanese move into the U.S. biotechnology industry, Gen-Probe, a 
San Diego company selling medical diagnostic products, has agreed to be 
acquired by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. of Tokyo for $110.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Gen-Probe deal illustrates that Japanese are aggressively pursuing a goal 
of biotechnology dominance, analysts said Tuesday. The deal also exemplifies 
how small U.S. biotechnology firms are having increasing difficulty raising 
capital to finance product development, a condition that is pushing them into 
the arms of the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese companies have made marketing, research and equity investment 
agreements with 250 or more of the 1,100 U.S. biotechnology firms, said G. 
Steven Burrill, head of Ernst &amp; Young's biotechnology consulting operation 
in San Francisco. But Chugai is proposing 
</P>
<P>
what would be only the second Japanese acquisition of a publicly owned U.S. 
biotech company, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, publicly owned Lyphomed of Rosemont, Ill., was acquired by 
Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical in a two-stage deal worth more than $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan has set worldwide dominance of biotechnology by the year 2000 as a 
national priority," Burrill said. "When Japan has set a priority in a given 
industry, be it autos, steel, consumer electronics or semiconductors, they have 
gotten their act together and come out major winners. Given their experience, 
there is no reason to think they won't be as successful in biotech as in other 
fields." 
</P>
<P>
Gen-Probe officials admitted Tuesday that, before accepting the Chugai offer, 
it found itself at a "strategic crossroads" with cash running low. As of Sept. 
30, shareholder equity had been reduced to $8.2 million after losses totaling 
$29.5 million since its 1983 founding. 
</P>
<P>
Although the company had enough cash to fund operations through next year, 
Gen-Probe was considering raising $5 million to $7 million in a private equity 
placement before deciding on the Chugai buyout, president Thomas Bologna said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But the Chugai buyout was decided on because of the dilutive effect of a 
private placement and the security of the Chugai alliance, Gen-Probe co-founder 
and director Howard Birndorf said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Gen-Probe reported a loss of $4.2 million 
on revenue of $7.2 million, contrasted with a loss of $6.9 million on revenue 
of $3.9 million for the same three quarters last year. Product sales increased 
over that period to $3.6 million, from $2 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Chugai will tender $6.25 for each of Gen-Probe's 17.7 million fully diluted 
shares, Gen-Probe officials said. The offer is twice the $3.13 per share price 
of Gen-Probe shares in over-the-counter trading Monday, before the deal was 
made public. The stock closed Tuesday at $6, up $2.88. The offer is less than 
the $7 a share investors paid in Gen-Probe's October, 1987, initial public 
stock offering, but analysts generally were enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a great deal for shareholders," said Peter Drake of Vector 
Securities, an investment banking firm in Deerfield, Ill. "The offer is a 
substantial premium over the current stock price, which is quite different from 
other acquisitions we have seen lately in the biotech industry." 
</P>
<P>
Recent deals, including Genzyme's acquisition of Integrated Genetics and Xoma's 
buyout of Ingene, have been done at or below the companies' stock market value, 
Drake said. 
</P>
<P>
That reflects the difficulty that unprofitable biotechnology firms have had 
raising capital since the October, 1987, stock market crash, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1983, Gen-Probe sells medical diagnostic products that involve the 
binding of pieces of synthetic genetic material to genes of viruses, bacteria, 
other human pathogens and cancer cells in human blood. The resulting hybrids 
are then made to emit light or radioactivity for detection in hospital 
laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
Gen-Probe has received Food and Drug Administration approval for eight DNA 
probe products, more than any other genetic probe company, Gen-Probe treasurer 
Howard Sampson said. The best-selling kits are those that test for venereal 
diseases, including chlamydia and gonorrhea. 
</P>
<P>
Gen-Probe's diagnostic technology is highly sensitive and advanced but the 
company's product sales have increased more slowly than hoped, said Sarah 
Gordon, a biotechnology analyst with the Hambrecht &amp; Quist investment 
banking firm in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's first products -- kits for Legionnaires' disease and pneumonia -- 
met market resistance because they involved radioactive materials and thus 
required special handling. The company has since shifted product development 
toward non-radioactive "chemiluminescent" hybrids that emit light when tests 
are positive. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Chugai and Gen-Probe signed a joint research and marketing deal in 
which Chugai paid $15 million to fund Gen-Probe's research for 10 diagnostic 
products, including tests for two types of cancer and eight viruses, including 
AIDS. In return, Chugai received Asian marketing rights to the products 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
The deal illustrates how Japanese investors prefer a long "mating dance" before 
jumping into a major investment, Burrill said. 
</P>
<P>
Chugai booked a profit of $60 million on sales of $991 million last year. In 
addition to the Gen-Probe deal, the company also has made strategic alliances 
with Upjohn and Genetics Institute recently.

MIKE DOWNEY: CLIPPER FAN: A TRUE TEST OF LOYALTY

Maybe the time has come for more of us to be as true-blue to the Clippers as is 
Kay Grall, who has followed them through thin and thin. 
</P>
<P>
If hoop lovers everywhere would give the same sort of unconditional support to 
the NBA's most down-and-out organization that Kay Grall gives the Clippers, who 
knows how many games they might win? 
</P>
<P>
(Put down your hand. That was a rhetorical question.) 
</P>
<P>
Another NBA season begins Friday night for the banged-up gang bossed by Don 
Sterling and coached by Don Casey that probably could use some godfatherly 
assistance from Don Corleone. 
</P>
<P>
And when the Clipper opener against the Houston Rockets gets started at the 
Sports Arena, you can expect Kay Grall to be right there at courtside, rooting 
for them as avidly as if they were the Lakers or Detroit Pistons or, you know, 
somebody good. 
</P>
<P>
She is ready to take her position for the opening tip. Even the answering 
machine at Kay Grall's home pronounces her to be "winding down from baseball 
and gearing up for basketball," with no mention of any feelings about football. 
</P>
<P>
Kay Grall is the best fan of pro basketball's worst team -- Europe and NBA 
expansion excluded. 
</P>
<P>
A promotional contest recently sought out and selected, with help from the 
teams themselves, the most faithful followers of every sports franchise in the 
immediate area, unearthing such characters as the British guy who flies all the 
way to California to watch the Raiders play football, and the Orange County 
dude who loved the Rams so much that he shaved his hair into the design of a 
Ram helmet, horns and all. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers went for a well-off executive from a Hollywood record company who 
has stuck by their side, even when their side went from $12 a pop to $350 a 
pop. 
</P>
<P>
But the clear-cut choice as queen of Clipperdom was Kay Grall of Reseda, an 
executive secretary for a bank and a mother of two children, who has been 
following the team ever since it set foot in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
She wanted a team she could get close to, and not some team that would stick 
her somewhere up in the second balcony with nothing but nosebleeds and 
binoculars. 
</P>
<P>
And close to the Clippers is exactly where Kay Grall got, baking cookies or her 
special pumpkin bread for the players, and even knitting a blue sweater for 
former North Carolina star Joe Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
"I only miss one or two games, a season," Grall said, "I get kidded about it at 
work but I'll have the last laugh someday. You have to stand by your team. You 
have to have some guts." 
</P>
<P>
"She's like a fraternity mother," Casey said. "The guys get a kick out of 
seeing her and talking to her. She's their new house mother." 
</P>
<P>
Casey, of course, can use all the help he can get. The poor man had the makings 
of a pretty fair basketball team until 1989 first-round draft choice Danny 
Ferry defected to Italy, 1988 first-round choice Danny Manning got injured and 
1985 first-round draft choice Benoit Benjamin decided to steer clear of the 
Clippers until he got his money's worth. 
</P>
<P>
Things like this can make a Clipper coach the loneliest man since the Maytag 
repairman. 
</P>
<P>
Casey, though, seems to be holding up pretty well. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to give up drinking beers and shooters a long time ago," Casey said 
Tuesday, laughing. "Now my wife is kidding me that I can chase other women 
three times a season if I absolutely have to." 
</P>
<P>
Coaching the Clippers can sometimes drive a guy to drink, or whatever. On the 
other hand, as a coach, there is a certain kick out of taking young clay and 
molding it, which very few NBA coaches get to do. Usually their players already 
are fully developed and unwilling to listen. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been interesting so far," Casey said. "You can do a lot of things, but 
you can't fight Father Time. Most of these guys are just so young. They just 
don't have the experience yet. We've had some very explosive, exciting moments 
during the preseason, and some downright sluggish, terrible moments. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's their resiliency that keeps me buoyant. See, I'm a seasoned coach, 
but I'm not a seasoned, NBA, long-time, late-in-the-game predicament coach. I'm 
still learning on the job a little myself. So, I'm not going to put all the 
onus on the players whenever things go wrong." 
</P>
<P>
About losing Ferry, Manning, et al, Casey recalls the excellent job done by Pat 
Riley and the Lakers during last season's NBA finals, when the entire starting 
backcourt was lost. Take away one key guy, you still have a chance. Take away 
two, it becomes next to impossible. Take away more, forget it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still not sure when Benjamin's going to get straightened out, so it's 
possible, with Manning still hurt and Ferry not around, that we theoretically 
could be missing our entire front line," Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
He is counting on a few new things, to go along with returnees such as Charles 
Smith and Ken Norman who are eager and able. The Clippers are heavily into 
conditioning these days. They have hired their own strength people, their own 
exercise people, their own diet people. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no quick fixes," Casey said. "But coaching the Clippers, every day 
is another challenge." 
</P>
<P>
A little fan support would help. So, come on. Make sure there's more than one.

KORBUT IS BACK ON THE BEAM; 
</P>
<P>
GYMNASTICS: SHE RAISED A SON AND RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SOVIET SYSTEM, BUT 
SHE'S STILL TOURING AT 34. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It all seemed so simple for Olga Korbut in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Only 17, Korbut caught gymnastics judges off balance at the Olympic Games in 
Munich with a combination of peril and pigtails. She won individual gold medals 
in the floor exercise and balance beam, and helped the Soviet Union to a gold 
in the team competition. 
</P>
<P>
But after fading at the 1976 Games and her retirement a year later, Korbut 
settled down with her family in Minsk. 
</P>
<P>
And she found life without gymnastics wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
She recently criticized the Soviet Union, saying that the government treated 
her like a beggar after she retired and refused to allow her to capitalize on 
her success. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't hide certain facts," said Korbut, who trains young gymnasts in Minsk. 
"But it's difficult to explain. It's almost like I didn't accomplish enough. I 
felt like I wasn't needed anymore. It's the scariest thing for an athlete to go 
through, in any country." 
</P>
<P>
Although the pigtails and Olympic cheers are gone, Korbut's love for gymnastics 
is not. At 34, she still trains and will be part of an eight-city U.S. 
exhibition tour, along with Mary Lou Retton and 18 other gymnasts. The tour, 
her first in the U.S. since 1976, will be at the Forum on Nov. 12. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be an ambassador of good will as well as an ambassador of 
gymnastics," she said though an interpreter. "I hope this role will increase as 
time goes by." 
</P>
<P>
Korbut said she was frustrated when the Soviets would not allow her to travel 
after retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect to be fussed over, but they could have invited me to the 
national championships or sent me on tour abroad with the national team," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Korbut said the impending tour is one of several things she has wanted to do 
since retiring. 
</P>
<P>
She also wants to open a gymnastics school in the United States, possibly in 
Southern California. She said she would live in Minsk, and periodically travel 
to the States to work with the school. 
</P>
<P>
"They're realistic, yet very initial plans," Korbut said. "I hope at the end of 
the tour I will be able to make some decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Korbut also plans to write a book about her post-Olympic years. Her first book, 
entitled "There Once Lived a Girl," was "dedicated to the little girl in me." 
</P>
<P>
"The second book will expose the other side of the medal, me as a mature 
person," she said. "During my childhood I was introduced and exposed to this 
sport. Then, all of a sudden, it was gone. I had to start over again. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something every athlete has gone through. There might be a need for a 
support group for former athletes. Not so much for financial help, but 
professional training, to help them get into coaching or something else." 
</P>
<P>
Korbut's setbacks started at the 1976 Olympics. She helped the Soviets to a 
team gold, but placed fifth in the all-around and was overshadowed by Nadia 
Comaneci of Romania. 
</P>
<P>
Her teammates and coaches, many jealous of her success in Munich, criticized 
her. Two former friends and gymnasts stole her trophies, medals and souvenirs 
from the family home on her wedding day. 
</P>
<P>
Korbut said it was her husband, Soviet rock star Leonid Bortkevich, and son 
Richard, 10, who helped her through her her post-Olympic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"Leonid made it much smoother," she said. "When I had to cry, he was there. 
There have been a lot of tears for Olga. It was a really rough time, but it 
gladdens my heart to know he was there." 
</P>
<P>
With her problems behind her, Korbut said she is excited about returning to the 
United States. She first toured the United States in 1973, performing to 
sold-out houses and even getting a red carpet welcome at the White House from 
then-President Richard Nixon. She was back again after the 1976 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The new tour has inspired her to continue training. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't been very easy for me (to keep training)," Korbut said. "It would 
have been much easier to say no and quit. But I truly love performing, and I 
want to show everyone that life, and this sport, is beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
"My performance certainly will remind people of my past ones. But I'm better, 
more mature, than I was." 
</P>
<P>
Korbut said she's looking forward to touring with Retton, who won the Olympic 
all-around gold in 1984. She has met Retton briefly, but has never performed 
with her. 
</P>
<P>
"I see in (Retton) a girl who envied my gymnastics style, but in a good way," 
Korbut said. "I hope that in 17 years, she will be remembered in the same way I 
am now."

WORLD SERIES DRAWS RECORD LOW RATINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The Bay Area World Series was a flop on television, as ratings plunged to their 
lowest levels in at least 21 years, and maybe ever. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland's four-game sweep of the San Francisco Giants on ABC averaged a 16.4 
rating, according statistics released Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research. 
</P>
<P>
A 16.4 rating means that the Series was being watched by 16.4% of the nation's 
93 million-plus television households. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen, which has been keeping ratings since 1950, said it was the lowest 
numbers since at least 1968, but that it would take additional research to 
determine if the ratings were the lowest ever. 
</P>
<P>
Game 4 Saturday night was the lowest-rated prime-time World Series game ever, 
getting a 14.7 rating and a 28 share. It was outdrawn by three programs on NBC: 
"Golden Girls," "Empty Nest" and "Hunter." 
</P>
<P>
This year's rating was 28.4% less than the 22.9 rating of the 1984 World Series 
between the Detroit Tigers and the San Diego Padres. The Bay Area Series got a 
29 share, meaning that fewer than three of 10 sets on at the time had baseball 
tuned in.That's 25.6% less than the previous 21-year-low low of 29, set last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Before this year, the lowest-rated prime-time game was in 1987, when Game 1 
between the St. Louis Cardinals and Minnesota Twins got a 19.2 rating. 
</P>
<P>
Game 1 this year got a 16.2 rating and a 30 share. It improved to a 17.4 rating 
and a 28 share for Game 2 and, after a 10-day delay caused by an earthquake, a 
17.5 rating and a 32 share for Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Swanson, the president of ABC Sports, refused to discuss the ratings, 
ABC spokesman Mark Mandel said. The network just completed its six-year, $575 
million contract with baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"It shouldn't surprise anyone," Barry Kaplan, a television industry analyst at 
Goldman Sachs &amp; Co, said of the ratings. "Nobody expected it to be a 
barn-burner being from two cities in the same area and neither New York or Los 
Angeles involved. On top of which, it was lopsided competitively and top of 
which, it was interrupted by an earthquake. I would have been shocked if it 
wasn't the lowest-rated in a long time."

UCLA RESERVE IS CHARGED WITH TWO COUNTS OF BATTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stacey Elliott, a reserve defensive tackle on the UCLA football team, was 
booked Tuesday on two counts of battery, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County 
Sherriff's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Campus police told the Daily Bruin that Elliott, 21, allegedly grabbed the 
buttocks of two women in separate on-campus incidents last summer. 
</P>
<P>
According to the campus newspaper, athletic department officials apparently 
advised Elliott to turn himself over to the police, who obtained a warrant for 
his arrest on the misdemeanor charges. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, who was released after posting $6,000 bail, allegedly grabbed the UCLA 
students as he walked past them during daylight hours. The incidents did not 
appear to be premeditated, police told the Daily Bruin. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott was scheduled to appear today in Division 90 in West Los Angeles 
Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Charges were filed Oct. 11, police said, and Elliott was later named as a 
suspect in the case after the victims, who were not named, identified him in a 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged incidents took place last July 31 and Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, a 6-foot-1 1/2, 252-pound junior, was an All-Southern Section 
defensive end at Long Beach Poly High. He has played only sparingly this 
season, making seven tackles, and has missed several games because of a bruised 
thigh. 
</P>
<P>
Pending a decision by the dean of students, who would decide if disciplinary 
action should be taken, Elliott will continue to play for the Bruins, a 
spokesman for the athletic department said.

The ruling virtually assured that the Formula One driving title will go to 
Frenchman Alain Prost. Senna would have had to win both the Japanese race last

CALTIP GETTING A CALL AS PROGRAM THAT'S WORKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Department of Fish and Game has a program to curtail poaching: 
CalTIP. 
</P>
<P>
Since its inception in 1981, CalTIP (Turn In Poachers) has distributed 
individual rewards, up to $1,000 and totaling $83,400, to 359 anonymous 
informants whose information led to arrests. 
</P>
<P>
A person with information about the illegal taking of fish or game may call 
(800) 952-5400 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. seven days a week or, at other times, 
contact a local sheriff and ask to be put in touch with a DFG warden. 
</P>
<P>
No caller need give his name. He will be assigned a code number for future 
identification and will be offered a reward if an arrest is made.

GEORGIA PACIFIC BIDS $3 BILLION FOR GREAT NORTHERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Georgia Pacific Corp. on Tuesday launched a $3.18-billion bid for Great 
Northern Nekoosa Corp., a buyout proposal that analysts said might trigger a 
bidding contest for Great Northern and lead to consolidation in the forest 
products industry. 
</P>
<P>
The bid was something of a shocker because, in one analyst's words, there had 
until now been an "unwritten rule" against such unsolicited offers. The 
acquisition would bolster Georgia Pacific's position in the paper and cardboard 
market and make it the world's largest forest products company. 
</P>
<P>
The $58-a-share cash tender offer verified rumors that Atlanta-based Georgia 
Pacific would mount a takeover bid for Great Northern, a Norwalk, Conn., paper 
products company. Georgia Pacific said the offer is 50% higher than the price 
of a Great Northern share before last Thursday, when the value of the firm's 
stock began to rise with acquisition rumors. 
</P>
<P>
Great Northern closed at $62.875 a share on Tuesday, up $20.125 on the New York 
Stock Exchange, where it was the most actively traded issue. 
</P>
<P>
The buyout proposal was outlined in a letter on Tuesday from Georgia Pacific 
Chairman T. Marshall Hahn Jr. to William R. Laidig, chairman of Great Northern. 
Hahn, in the letter, also requested a meeting to negotiate aspects of the 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike many of today's transactions driven by financial engineering," the 
letter said, "the merger of our two companies represents an excellent strategic 
fit based on industrial logic. In addition . . . this combination will result 
in a stronger and more competitive forest products company." 
</P>
<P>
Laidig issued a statement calling the bid "uninvited," but did not respond 
directly to the acquisition proposal. Instead, Laidig -- noting that the 
company's directors have a legal responsibility to consider the offer -- said 
Great Northern's board would meet in "due course." Georgia Pacific made the 
tender offer, generally considered a hostile acquisition method, because the 
firm's advisers consider it to be the surest way to acquire Great Northern, 
said Gail Smith, a spokeswoman for the forest products giant. Smith said 
Georgia Pacific -- a firm that traditionally sells more lumber products than 
paper products -- wants to acquire Great Northern to expand its paper and 
cardboard production. 
</P>
<P>
Great Northern has no effective anti-takeover defenses, but the firm might find 
a more friendly suitor, some industry observers said. Mark Kurland, an analyst 
at Mabon, Nugent &amp; Co. in New York, said two other major forest products 
firms -- Weyerhauser and International Paper -- are among the companies that 
may vie for Great Northern. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a bidding war," Kurland declared. 
</P>
<P>
Kurland said the bid for Great Northern will trigger other buyouts and major 
consolidation in the forest products industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Things will be going the way of the copper industry," he said. "Instead of 10 
or 12, we'll end up with five or six." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Schneider, an analyst at the Chicago-based Duff &amp; Phelps, also 
expects more consolidation in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"This bid is important because there was an unwritten rule against unsolicited 
takeovers in this industry," Schneider said. "I thought there would be 
consolidation in this industry and this (takeover bid) will give it more 
impetus." 
</P>
<P>
Schneider said Georgia Pacific -- now second to International Paper in forest 
products sales -- would become the largest firm in the industry by acquiring 
Great Northern, No. 9 in sales. 
</P>
<P>
By acquiring Great Northern, Georgia Pacific would be able to pursue plans to 
boost its sales abroad, said Julie Bryan, an analyst at the New York offices of 
S. G. Warburg &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
"Georgia Pacific believes it can become more competitive on a worldwide basis," 
Bryan said. "By increasing capacity, they can lower their costs. Will that lead 
to higher exports? We'll see." 
</P>
<P>
Bryan said Georgia Pacific may raise its offer to top counteroffers; but any 
boost would be slight -- not significant -- she said. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Pacific said it was offering to buy 100% of Great Northern's shares. 
Georgia Pacific would pay $3.18 billion for the stock, would assume $1.8 
billion in Great Northern debt and pay fees associated with legal work and 
financing -- bringing the total to about $4.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Pacific said Bank of America has pledged to provide $1.25 billion of 
the financing. Bank of America will also arrange other financial backing, 
Georgia Pacific said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Yataro Iwasaki was a man with an eye for real estate. In 1890, the founder of 
the Mitsubishi Zaibatsu -- a large industrial combine that later spawned a 
loose family of 41 companies with combined annual revenue approaching $200 
billion -- bought a tract of swampy land adjacent to the Imperial Palace. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Iwasaki's little corner of Tokyo is potentially the most valuable turf 
in the world. It lies beneath the concrete bedrock of the premier business 
districts of Marunouchi and Otemachi. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a century after the entrepreneur bought his 87 acres from the central 
government, most of the land is still in the hands of his corporate heirs and 
its value has skyrocketed so high during the postwar real estate boom that 
nobody seems to know exactly how much it is worth. The book value is $5 
billion, but analysts say that figure is so low that it is meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
Now the foremost landlord to Japan Inc. is about to become America's most 
conspicuous property owner. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Estate Co., formed out of the real estate division of Iwasaki's 
Mitsubishi conglomerate in 1937, announced in Tokyo and New York on Monday that 
it plans to acquire a 51% stake in the Rockefeller Group, the real estate 
investment arm of the Rockefeller family trusts. 
</P>
<P>
The $846-million investment would give Mitsubishi Estate at least nominal 
controlling interest in Rockefeller Center, which includes Depression-era Art 
Deco landmarks in Midtown Manhattan such as Radio City Music Hall and the RCA 
Building. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi's financial gambit may stir up unpleasant emotions in those who are 
concerned about the flood of Japanese and other foreign investments in the 
United States, but these critics might have a hard time arguing that the 
Mitsubishi-Rockefeller deal represents any kind of clash of cultural values. 
</P>
<P>
In a curious way, Iwasaki and his Mitsubishi men have a lot in common with John 
D. Rockefeller, founder of the Standard Oil trust, and the scions of his 
all-American zaibatsu. 
</P>
<P>
So apparent was this affinity that Raymond F. Pettit, senior vice president and 
chief financial officer for the Rockefeller Group, told reporters in Tokyo that 
Mitsubishi was chosen over nine other Japanese and foreign suitors because of a 
certain "chemistry" at the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
In Mitsubishi Estate, the stewards of the Rockefeller legacy saw the kind of 
stolid and conservative investor that would make a long-term commitment to "the 
quality, the traditions and the values associated with the Rockefeller family," 
William G. Bowen, chairman of the Rockefeller Trust Committee, said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Iwasaki, like the original Rockefeller, had a relatively humble start -- for a 
samurai. The son of a minor feudal clan on the island of Shikoku, he struck out 
in business in 1870 with a shipping and mail courier service plying the coastal 
waters between Tokyo and Osaka. He would later win government concessions for 
mail routes to the United States and China, and would merge with his bitter 
rival. 
</P>
<P>
Japan in the late 19th Century had only recently emerged from nearly three 
centuries of feudal isolation and was engaged in an intense national effort to 
build military might and catch up with the industrialized West. A handful of 
capitalists such as Iwasaki played major roles in their country's rapid 
development by taking over state-owned industries and forming huge industrial 
and financial conglomerates, the zaibatsu. 
</P>
<P>
By 1890, the year Iwasaki made his farsighted real estate purchase in Tokyo, 
Mitsubishi had diversified into finance, mining, shipbuilding and heavy 
machinery. The company grew into one of three major zaibatsu, along with Mitsui 
and Sumitomo, and was tightly held by the Iwasaki clan until the 1920s, when 
public shares were first issued. 
</P>
<P>
The subsidiary Mitsubishi Heavy Industries would later build the Zero fighter 
planes that tormented U.S. fleets in the Pacific during World War II and would 
launch the world's largest battleship, the Musashi. Like the rest of corporate 
Japan, Mitsubishi was an integral part of the war machine. 
</P>
<P>
"We must perform our duty with a clear-cut resolve to serve, above all things, 
the interests of the state," Koyota Iwasaki, a descendant of the founder who 
became president of the trust company controlling the zaibatsu, told a 
gathering of top Mitsubishi executives two days after the Dec. 7, 1941, attack 
on Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Where the stories of the Iwasakis and their fellow zaibatsu families differ 
from those of the Rockefellers or the Carnegies is that it took three or four 
decades for the concept of anti-monopolistic regulation to reach the Japanese 
islands, and only then at the insistence of postwar U.S. occupation 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court broke up Rockefeller's Standard Oil Co. in 1911. The 
American-inspired dissolution of the Japanese monopolies after the war was only 
half completed, however, when they were allowed to reassemble as loosely 
structured industrial groups, now known as keiretsu. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi's case is typical of how the zaibatsu have survived. Gone are family 
control and the trust company that was once at the top of the pyramid. But 
Mitsubishi Corp., the general trading subsidiary, reassembled itself 
immediately after the American occupation ended in 1947 and now "coordinates" 
the activities of the group. The heads of the 41 companies in the group meet 
monthly to map out strategies in what is euphemistically called a presidents' 
club. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries also reunited after a breakup to reestablish itself 
as Japan's leading defense contractor. Most notably, it is the company that 
will take the lead in developing the fighter jet of the next generation, the 
FSX, subject of much controversy earlier this year. American critics nearly 
scuttled a U.S.-Japan development program, warning that Mitsubishi Heavy would 
use U.S. military technology to gain international dominance in the commercial 
aerospace industry (a charge that Mitsubishi denied). 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Estate, like the other companies in the group, is operated 
independently yet remains 20.9% owned by Mitsubishi Group affiliates -- 
demonstrating the classic pattern of cross-shareholdings and interlocking 
directorates that U.S. officials say can generate the kind of clannish business 
relationships that become "structural impediments" to free trade. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi companies have not been singled out in ongoing trade negotiations, 
but serious question might be raised as to whether an American company could 
ever make an investment in Japan comparable to Mitsubishi Estate's proposed 
stake in the Rockefeller Group. As such, the deal is likely to match Sony 
Corp.'s $3.4-billion bid for Columbia Pictures as a symbol of imbalance in 
economic relations between the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
The Rockefeller venture will not be Mitsubishi Estate's first move into the 
U.S. market, but it is its most obvious. The company developed a 102-acre 
residential tract in Jupiter, Fla., 16 years ago, but now refuses to disclose 
financial details. It joined partnerships constructing an office building in 
Portland, Ore., in the early 1980s, and is involved in a 1,000-acre resort 
project in Palm Desert. 
</P>
<P>
The company's only major undertaking to date has been its investment, with two 
other partners, in the 777 Tower building at Citicorp Plaza in Los Angeles, a 
$500-million project that will have 3 million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Back home, Mitsubishi Estate has a reputation among industry analysts as a 
conservative and cumbersome giant that has missed many opportunities in 
overseas real estate while its rivals were acting more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The security represented by the company's holdings in the Marunouchi and 
Otemachi districts, where it owns 32 major buildings and still has title to 
about 50 acres, perhaps accounts for the complacency. Add 39 office buildings 
in other parts of Tokyo and elsewhere in Japan, for a total of 25 million 
square feet of office space, and Mitsubishi stands out as Japan's largest 
commercial landlord. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, rental income makes it by far the country's most profitable real estate 
concern. It takes in about $269 million a year in after-tax profit on more than 
$2 billion in gross revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The company is also beginning to assert itself with high-profile development 
projects, such as the 75-story Landmark Tower it plans to start building soon 
at the Minato Mirai complex in Yokohama. It will be Japan's tallest building. 
</P>
<P>
Yet real estate analysts say the company faces some tough bureaucratic 
wrangling before it can capitalize on its so-called latent assets in the 
Marunouchi and Otemachi business districts. Mitsubishi has been unable to 
persuade Tokyo metropolitan authorities to revise density limits for the area, 
so the eight- to 10-story office blocks now lining the streets may represent 
the maximum development for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
The core of the city, meanwhile, may move west to the urban hub of Shinjuku, 
where a cluster of skyscrapers stands and city authorities envision erecting a 
new financial district on landfill islands in Tokyo Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Iwasaki's 99-year-old investment in Tokyo real estate is hardly losing 
value. Results of recent surveys suggest that the cost of commercial land is 
leveling off, but not even the most pessimistic analyst predicts a crash. At 
last reckoning earlier this year, the National Land Agency calculated the 
market price of land in the Marunouchi district as holding firm at more than 
$22,000 a square foot, a rate that might make the Empire State Building seem 
cheap -- if it were for sale. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Through its acquisition of 51% of Rockefeller Group stock, Mitsubishi Estate 
Co. will assume a 14.5% controlling interest in New York City's Rockefeller 
Center. Most of the buildings within the 22-acre complex are involved in the 
deal.

USX Corp.: The steel, energy and diversified businesses company reported 
third-quarter profit of $175 million, down 23% from 1988 earnings, which 
included $71 million from the positive outcome of a federal tax issue. Sales 
totaled $4.4 billion, down 5%. The Pittsburgh firm attributed the results in 
part to lower refined product margins at Marathon Oil Co., the disposition of a 
number of units in its diversified businesses segment and the reduction of 
financial obligations by $1.6 billion since year-end 1988.

Reebok Unveils $170 Shoe: At a New York City basketball court, Reebok unveiled 
its new $170 inflatable basketball shoe called the Pump and said it planned to 
spend an unusually large $15 million to advertise it. The high-topped shoes 
have an orange button on the tongue that can be pressed to pump air into a 
specially designed plastic bladder, forming a readily adjusted cushion around 
the ankle, heel and instep. Reebok's main competitor, Nike Inc., said it is 
already shipping similar shoes called Nike Air Pressure to retailers. Nike's 
model costs $175.

MANUFACTURERS OPTIMISTIC ON TRADE, EXPANSION; 
</P>
<P>
SURVEY: CHIEF EXECUTIVES SAY THEY EXPECT TO HOLD THEIR OWN ON EXPORTS AND SEE 
LITTLE CHANCE OF A RECESSION BEFORE 1991. 
</P>

Disagreeing with economic predictions of rising trade deficits and a declining 
economy, U.S. manufacturers expect to at least hold their own in sales abroad 
next year and see little chance of a recession before 1991, the National Assn. 
of Manufacturers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The conventional wisdom, which seems to change every month, says trade 
improvement has stalled," said NAM President Jerry J. Jasinowski. "But we see a 
$15-billion improvement in net exports next year." 
</P>
<P>
A recent poll of 53 industrial chief executives -- a cross section of 
manufacturing companies represented by the industry group -- showed that only 
2% expected lower exports for their firms in 1990 than in 1989. Fifty-six 
percent expect their exports to remain the same same, and 42% see higher 
exports. Early this year, a similar poll showed 44% expected higher exports for 
their firms in 1989, while 54% expected to sell about the same as in 1988, a 
year of sweeping trade improvement. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 61% of the participants, who were polled Oct. 25, say they 
believe that the 8-year-old expansion can survive into 1991 "or later." Only 
21% are battening down for what they expect will be a recession early next 
year, with the remaining 18% expecting contraction in the second half of the 
year. Last February, more than half expected a 1990 recession, and only 36% 
thought the expansion could run on into 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The NAM poll results have been fairly optimistic for several years and also 
unusually prescient compared to more jaundiced academic and market economists. 
In presenting the results, Jasinowski praised the "realism" of manufacturing 
executives, whose responses are based more on their own bottom-line assessments 
of their companies. 
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed that executives remain worried about the federal deficit 
and the expansion of debt in the private sector. But they are more concerned 
with developing new products and improving the training of their labor force 
than with actions that government might take. 
</P>
<P>
Reduction of the federal budget deficit stood only third on the wish list, 
while at the bottom of the list were calls for government export incentives, a 
devalued dollar and other nostrums familiar on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"The government is too slow to respond to the changing dynamics of 
international competition," Jasinowski said. "The government can't even keep up 
with the conventional wisdom, let alone keep up with a company like Motorola 
developing new cellular telephone technology." 
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to what they hear from economist gurus, the manufacturers are asking 
for exchange rate stability, not central bank intervention to drive down the 
dollar to make it more competitive," Jasinowski explained. "They don't think 
governments can manipulate exchange rates to the extent that some economists 
think they can." 
</P>
<P>
In the poll, 49% agreed that central banks should aim for stability, not a 
cheaper or a stronger dollar. Only 16% want the dollar to be pushed down to 
lower a trade deficit which showed signs of ballooning again in the third 
quarter. Measured in GNP terms, net exports deteriorated at an annual rate of 
$22 billion (1982 dollars) in the third quarter, after several years of 
improvement. In 1989 dollars, trade is on track, with a projected deficit of 
some $110 billion this year, compared to $118.5 billion in 1988 and $152.1 
billion in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Several economists, such as Harvard's Martin Feldstein, MIT's Paul Krugman and 
former Carter Administration official C. Fred Bergsten, for years have called 
for a weaker dollar, while even the Bush Administration Treasury has begun to 
despair of trade improvement after this year. But the manufacturers, Jasinowski 
said, are confident that orders from Western Europe, in particular, will hold 
up next year and help net exports by as much as $15 billion in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"Market growth there has been fabulous, and if their economies keep growing, 
that should continue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturers would be happy to see the Federal Reserve Board lower 
interest rates, Jasinowski said, but not to the point where inflation would 
return. "They were all badly burned the last time inflation got out of 
control," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, 60% of those polled, faced with a choice between easy money and 
inflation, compared to a more restrictive policy and continued vigilance 
against inflation, chose the latter, "even if it means a restrictive policy 
that leads to higher interest rates." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the "realists" of the corporate world are also skeptical of a Wall 
Street where traders driven by highly leveraged debt financing and 
computer-driven arbitrage programs can kill 190 points from the Dow Jones 
industrial average in a couple of hours. 
</P>
<P>
"They think the markets today have almost nothing to do with the real economy," 
Jasinowski observed. The participants blamed the Friday the 13th market scare 
primarily on program trading, takeover speculation and junk bonds. At the 
bottom of the list was a concern that stocks are fundamentally overvalued or 
that a corporate profits squeeze will drastically slow the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the NAM participants seem confident that the cost push that has led 
many market economists to predict lower profits can be contained this year. An 
unexpected 61% of the poll participants said they expect pressures for higher 
wages to dry up by year-end. Thirty-five percent expect moderate employment 
cost increases. 
</P>
<P>
Against that background, plans for 1990 investment are similar to 1989 plans 
projected last February: About a third say they plan no increase in capital 
investment, while 29% say they will expand investment by "substantially more 
than 5%." Twenty-one percent plan to expand by about 5%.

LOOKING AHEAD: PAPER SHORTAGE MAY STALL FAX BOOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY H. WILLARD, TIMOTHY H. WILLARD is managing editor of the Futurist, a 
publication of the World Future Society, based in Bethesda, Md. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Problem-solving innovations often create the potential for a host of problems. 
Take the fax machine, which greatly speeds up written and graphic 
communications. The number of fax machines in offices, homes and even cars has 
grown rapidly in the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
But faxes may not flow so freely in the future. Shortages of the thermal-coated 
paper used by fax machines are likely to occur in the early 1990s, according to 
a report by International Resource Development Inc. of New Canaan, Conn. And, 
as the use of plain paper by faxes increases over the next decade, the demand 
for toner will skyrocket -- as will the price. 
</P>
<P>
Certain types of faxes may flow more freely than others, which will tie up the 
machines. "Fax flirting" is a likely phenomenon of the 1990s. There is already 
at least one fax machine-based dating service whose members can send each other 
photos and even handwritten love notes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hunch Playing as a Job Skill 
</P>
<P>
Futurists have a hunch that companies will encourage workers to use their 
intuition more. In fact, researchers have found that highly intuitive 
individuals are better at finding new ways of solving problems and often have a 
good sense of what new products will or won't work. 
</P>
<P>
Futurist and management consultant Weston Agor, a professor at the University 
of Texas at El Paso, believes that many businesses in the future will actually 
set up programs to help employees develop their intuitive talents. For example, 
"intuition clubs" will show how intuition can be put to work on the job and 
actually improve workers' job satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ever-Fashionable Cash 
</P>
<P>
The "cashless society," that future world with no paper money or coins, is a 
myth and likely to remain so -- at least according to one financial expert. 
</P>
<P>
Although many futurists and economists predict that cash transactions are 
likely to be almost extinct by the middle of the 21st Century, Peter Harrop, 
who has studied the way people pay for purchases, notes that if we were headed 
toward a cashless society, the number of bank notes and coins per person would 
already be dropping. 
</P>
<P>
But that does not seem to be happening anywhere, even when low-value coins 
aren't counted. In reality, the number of monetary transactions that each 
person makes is growing rapidly -- as much as 5% to 10% a year in many 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the arrival of the much heralded "debit card" and the increased use 
of credit cards and checks, there will be many occasions in which cash is most 
appropriate. And don't discount the power of human habit. Many people will 
simply be reluctant to deal with anything but cash for small, informal 
transactions, such as paying a neighborhood child to mow the lawn or buying an 
ice cream cone from a street vendor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
International Tele-Commuting"Electronic immigrants" using advanced 
communications and computer technologies may tele-commute to jobs in the United 
States in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications expert Joseph Pelton of the University of Colorado, Boulder, 
says workers from faraway -- and cheaper -- labor markets such as Barbados, the 
Philippines, India and China will be recruited and trained to provide a range 
of services. Among them will be programming, word processing and telephone 
sales -- all tasks that can be performed at a remote distance from the 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
This electronic import and export of services "could become the top 
international trade issue of the 21st Century," Pelton warns, as well as a 
source of great labor conflict in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Another potential impact: As more and more workers travel electronically to 
jobs in wealthier nations, those developing nations may turn into 
"tele-colonies" whose politics and finances are dictated by overseas interests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Making Leisure More Efficient 
</P>
<P>
"Bundled" leisure activities may be the trend of the future. 
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey by Decision Research Corp., busy people -- 
particularly baby boomers -- often feel that they have more money than time. 
These busy people will increasingly purchase packages of goods and services, 
cutting down on the time that they spend deciding which leisure services to 
buy. 
</P>
<P>
For example, they may do business with a firm that will deliver to their door 
not only a gourmet meal but also videocassettes and a bottle of wine. Or they 
may choose a travel agent who books every aspect of a vacation -- hotel rooms, 
restaurant reservations, even suggested activities such as an afternoon of 
bicycling. 
</P>
<P>
And people are likely to feel even more pressed for time in the future. 
Decision Research notes that 46% of the people questioned said they had less 
leisure time now than a few years ago.

JAPANESE TO BUY SAN DIEGO BIOTECH FIRM 
</P>

<P>
In yet another Japanese move into the U.S. biotechnology industry, Gen-Probe, a 
San Diego company selling medical diagnostic products, has agreed to be 
acquired by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. of Tokyo for $110.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Gen-Probe deal illustrates that the Japanese are aggressively pursuing a 
goal of biotechnology dominance. The deal also exemplifies how small U.S. 
biotechnology firms are having increasing difficulty raising capital to finance 
product development, a condition that is pushing them into the arms of the 
Japanese, analysts said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese companies have made marketing, research and equity investment 
agreements with 250 or more of the 1,100 U.S. biotechnology firms, said G. 
Steven Burrill, head of Ernst &amp; Young's biotechnology consulting operation 
in San Francisco. But Chugai is proposing what would be only the second 
Japanese acquisition a publicly owned U.S. biotech firm, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, publicly owned Lyphomed of Rosemont, Ill., was acquired by 
Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical in a two-stage deal worth more than $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan has set worldwide dominance of biotechnology by the year 2000 as a 
national priority," Burrill said. "When Japan has set a priority in a given 
industry -- be it autos, steel, consumer electronics or semiconductors -- they 
have gotten their act together and come out major winners." 
</P>
<P>
Gen-Probe officials admitted Tuesday that, before accepting the Chugai offer, 
the company found itself at a "strategic crossroads" with cash running low. As 
of Sept. 30, shareholders' equity had been reduced to $8.2 million after losses 
totaling $29.5 million since its 1983 founding. 
</P>
<P>
Gen-Probe was considering raising $5 million to $7 million in a private equity 
placement before deciding on the Chugai buyout, President Thomas Bologna said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Gen-Probe reported a loss of $4.2 million 
on revenue of $7.2 million, contrasted with a loss of $6.9 million on revenue 
of $3.9 million for the same three quarters last year. Product sales increased 
to $3.6 million from $2 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Chugai will tender $6.25 for each of Gen-Probe's 17.7 million fully diluted 
shares, Gen-Probe officials said. The offer is more than twice the 
$3.125-per-share price of Gen-Probe shares in over-the-counter trading Monday, 
before the deal was made public. The stock closed Tuesday at $6, up $2.875. The 
offer is less than the $7 a share that investors paid in Gen-Probe's October, 
1987, initial public stock offering, but analysts generally were enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a great deal for shareholders," said Peter Drake of Vector 
Securities, an investment banking firm in Deerfield, Ill. Recent deals, 
including Genzyme's acquisition of Integrated Genetics and Xoma's buyout of 
Ingene, have been done at or below the companies' stock market value, Drake 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1983, Gen-Probe sells medical diagnostic products that involve the 
binding of pieces of synthetic genetic material to genes of viruses, bacteria, 
other human pathogens and cancer cells in human blood. The resulting hybrids 
are then made to emit light or radioactivity for detection in hospital 
laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
Gen-Probe has received Food and Drug Administration approval for eight DNA 
probe products, more than any other genetic probe company, Gen-Probe treasurer 
Howard Sampson said. The best-selling kits are those that test for venereal 
diseases, including chlamydia and gonorrhea. 
</P>
<P>
Gen-Probe's product sales have increased more slowly than hoped. The firm's 
first products -- kits for Legionnaires' disease and pneumonia -- met market 
resistance because they involved radioactive materials and thus required 
special handling. The company has since shifted new product development toward 
non-radioactive "chemiluminescent" hybrids that emit light when tests are 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Chugai and Gen-Probe signed a joint research and marketing deal in 
which Chugai paid $15 million to fund Gen-Probe's research for 10 diagnostic 
products.

BRITAIN BOWS OUT OF JAGUAR PICTURE; 
</P>
<P>
OPEN FOR BIDS: THE GOVERNMENT'S DEPARTURE LEAVES THE LUXURY MOTOR CAR MAKER 
VULNERABLE TO TAKEOVER EFFORTS BY BOTH FORD AND GENERAL MOTORS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The British government said Tuesday that it would drop its "golden share" in 
luxury car maker Jaguar PLC, opening the door to a potential bidding war 
between two U.S. automotive giants, Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The government's stake was reserved as part of Jaguar's privatization in 1984 
to prevent a hostile takeover. But Trade and Industry Secretary Nicholas Ridley 
said the government was prepared to waive it to get rid of uncertainty over the 
firm's future. 
</P>
<P>
"The restrictions on share holdings entrenched by the government's special 
share are now clearly causing uncertainties," Ridley told Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The share allowed Ridley to veto any takeover bid or any change in Jaguar's 
articles of association, which until the end of 1990 had forbidden any single 
stake in the company larger than 15%. 
</P>
<P>
"I am clear that it is in the best interests of Jaguar's management, 
shareholders and work force for the company's future to be assured and the 
present climate of uncertainty resolved as quickly as possible," Ridley said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The move drew criticism from opposition Labor Party trade spokesman Bryan 
Gould. "The golden share is a charade. This is a black day for . . . the 
British car industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The Jaguar badge will simply be placed on cars designed and engineered 
elsewhere," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Keith White, a union official, said the news of the government's decision 
caused despair at Jaguar's assembly plant in Coventry, England. "They are 
throwing us to the wolves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Ford and General Motors have been stalking the Jaguar's prestigious "Big 
Cat" emblem. The maker of sporty luxury cars has been looking for a benefactor 
since its profits slumped from currency fluctuations and poor sales in the 
United States, and in recent weeks, GM and Ford have been building stakes in 
Jaguar with a view to gaining a foothold in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But as Britain's last big independent car company, Jaguar has insisted in its 
talks with GM and Ford that it retain some form of control in any linkup. 
</P>
<P>
Ford, which has said it would acquire the troubled auto maker if allowed to do 
so, said Friday that it has raised its Jaguar holding to 13.2%. 
</P>
<P>
GM has also received U.S. government clearance to acquire a stake in Jaguar, 
but it has not disclosed whether it owns any shares. 
</P>
<P>
In Detroit, GM spokesman Jack Harned said: "We will now consider all our 
options and explore matters further in light of these important new 
developments." 
</P>
<P>
He would not say exactly what those options are, but GM has been negotiating 
with Jaguar over production ventures and the purchase of a minority stake. 
</P>
<P>
A Ford spokesman said the company had no comment on Ridley's statement. 
</P>
<P>
The British announcement was not expected at Jaguar. "We were not consulted 
about the matter in advance and were surprised about the action taken," a 
Jaguar spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Jaguar had intended to put any plans about the firm to its shareholders, the 
spokeswoman said. She would not comment further. 
</P>
<P>
Jaguar shares on the U.S. over-the-counter market rose $1.625, to $13.50, in 
heavy afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
In London, Jaguar shares had risen to $11.79 (7.46 pounds) Tuesday, from around 
$6.30 (4 pounds) in mid-September, on speculation of a bid for the company.

BOEING, JAPANESE IN TALKS TO DEVELOP JET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Boeing Co. said Tuesday that it is talking with a consortium of major Japanese 
manufacturers about the possibility of developing a new commercial airliner 
known as the 767X. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft, which would have 300 to 350 seats, would be Boeing's 
second-largest plane. Its biggest, the 747-400, seats about 400 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Coming amid the trade tensions between the United States and Japan and the 
growing concerns about the erosion of America's technological edge, the 
proposed deal might renew debate in Congress over U.S. compliance in 
transferring key technology to the nation's chief economic competitor. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to raise the flag and sound a scare, but any time there is some sort of 
transfer, it would help Japan," said Charles McKee, an aviation analyst at 
Avmark Asia Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
He said Japan would likely seek high-tech transfers from Boeing in the area of 
avionics, or navigation and radio gear. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Schleh, a spokesman for Boeing, emphasized that the parties have 
been discussing the project for some time and have not reached even a 
preliminary agreement on how to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing definitive," Schleh said, "It's simply a matter of exploring 
possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
Schleh noted that the companies that Boeing is talking to -- Mitsubishi Heavy 
Industries Ltd., Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. 
-- are already working with Boeing on its 767 aircraft project. Schleh 
acknowledged, however, that the Japanese firms could have anywhere from simply 
a subcontracting role to possibly a partnership interest in the new venture. A 
partnership would be the closest tie yet between Boeing and Japanese 
manufacturers. However, it is not definite that any Japanese companies would 
contribute if Boeing decides to build the plane. 
</P>
<P>
The new 767X, if built, would compete with McDonald Douglas's MD11 plane and 
the Airbus A330 and A340 planes, which fill a niche in the "medium long-haul" 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing has about $3.1 billion in cash available. To begin a new airplane 
program about $2 billion is needed, industry analysts said.

QUAKE TAX SEEN AS THREAT TO MEASURE M VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With less than a week before the election, proponents of Orange County's 
Measure M sales tax for transportation may be facing a new opponent: the 
proposed earthquake tax. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Measure M's backers fear that a special legislative session convening 
in Sacramento on Thursday to discuss a sales tax increase for Northern 
California earthquake relief could harm the transportation plan's chances at 
the polls on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very concerned that it will hurt M's chances," said Assemblyman Gil 
Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), a supporter of the measure. "I pleaded with the 
governor when I went up to San Francisco to delay the special legislative 
meeting until after the . . . vote." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the Legislature does not immediately approve a one-year, quarter-cent 
sales tax increase statewide that Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative 
leaders have requested, the specter of Sacramento politicians discussing tax 
increases on the eve of the election could be damaging enough, Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you call a special session, people will interpret that as that you're going 
to raise taxes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While Deukmejian's is the most immediate proposal to boost taxes, there are 
others that loom in the distance that could also cloud voters' minds. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors hopes to put another half-cent per dollar sales tax 
proposal -- this one to pay for a new jail and courtrooms -- on the June, 1990, 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Also on that ballot will be a proposed statewide nine-cent increase in the 
gasoline tax to fund highway construction. 
</P>
<P>
And last week, Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy announced that he would seek voter 
approval to place yet another half-cent sales tax increase on the November, 
1990, ballot to pay for anti-drug programs and additional law enforcement and 
prisons. 
</P>
<P>
For Orange County, all those proposals could add up to an increase in the sales 
tax of 1 3/4 cents per dollar -- although the earthquake relief tax would 
expire on Dec. 31, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a 1 1/2-cent increase would mean an additional $180 on the purchase of a 
$12,000 automobile. 
</P>
<P>
"Damn near everyone has an idea about how to raise taxes," Ferguson said. "I 
can see (voters) sitting down at the dinner table and saying 'Hey, I'm already 
paying about 47 cents out of every dollar to the government.' They're liable to 
say no to everything." 
</P>
<P>
But Bruce Nestande, a former county supervisor and chairman of the Measure M 
campaign committee, said lumping the tax proposals together is a serious 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"You always have people with proposals to raise money for various kinds of 
things," Nestande said. "You take them one at a time . . . focus on one issue, 
and vote it up or down." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's electorate, Nestande said, is intelligent enough not to be 
confused by the special legislative session or any of the other proposals in 
the news recently. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe they can distinguish that we had a tragedy in Northern California . 
. . and you try to do what you can in a humanitarian way," Nestande said. "This 
(Measure M) is an Orange County vote. We have made that point over and over and 
over again to anyone who is listening." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson said he does not like the idea of a sales tax increase for quake 
relief regardless of the timing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very seriously concerned about voting for any broad increase" in taxes for 
earthquake aid, Ferguson said. "The federal and state governments . . . are 
already paying" for some relief efforts. "All of those people (had) the 
opportunity to buy earthquake insurance. Half have it. What are they going to 
think if government bails out the other half?" 
</P>
<P>
"State government is not a charity." 
</P>
<P>
Alan Hoffenblum, campaign manager for Measure M, said the timing of the special 
session could have been better, but he was not as worried as Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
"We're concerned that there will be some confusion," Hoffenblum said. "But we 
think it will sort itself out by next Tuesday." Voters "are going to get a lot 
of mail between now and Election Day." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffenblum said it is too late to prepare any last-minute mailers explaining to 
voters the difference between the special one-year earthquake relief tax 
requested by Deukmejian and the Orange County tax increase that would raise 
$3.1 billion over 20 years, all of which would go for transportation projects 
within the county. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Hoffenblum said, "One does not relate to the other. . . . Hopefully, 
by Tuesday, those who've made up their minds that it (Measure M) is a good plan 
won't change their mind because of a fourth-of-a-cent sales tax." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Yudelson, central county chair of the Measure M opposition, said that 
while the earthquake relief tax is "something everyone can support," it might 
focus voters' attention on the string of tax increase proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope it will wake up a few people who weren't planning on voting," Yudelson 
said. "People are going to have to think: 'What do we really need this money 
for? We have to make some choices here.' " 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Transportation Commission member Dana Reed, a strong supporter of 
Measure M, said he hopes voters do exactly that. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike these other proposals, which are just that, this is a real program," 
Reed said, "and 100% of the money stays in Orange County."

<P>
"Hey partner, what's your name?" Battalion Chief Charles A. Nicola whispered. 
</P>
<P>
"Buck" was the faint reply. 
</P>
<P>
The voice was that of Buck Helm, 57, a dock supervisor who was trapped under a 
collapsed part of the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland for 90 hours after the 
devastating Oct. 17 temblor that rocked the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
That first word to the Orange County firefighter marked the beginning of a 
dramatic and emotional rescue that was one of the few bright spots amid the 
death and devastation in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
"Where do you hurt?" Nicola asked the man. 
</P>
<P>
"I hurt all over," Helm replied. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to get you out of here," Nicola promised. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday honored the five-member 
county Fire Department's heavy rescue team, which aided in Helm's rescue. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving commendations, the firefighters -- Nicola of Corona, Buster 
DuBrock of Naples in Los Angeles County, Dan Mackay of Yorba Linda, Steve 
Shomber of Alta Loma in San Bernardino County and Jim Aldrich of Buena Park -- 
gave the most detailed account so far of their rescue. 
</P>
<P>
They told of snaking their way through a dark, dusty crawlway left when the top 
lanes of the double-decked Nimitz -- Interstate 880 -- fell on the traffic 
below. They called for a hydraulic prying device and other tools to cut Helm 
from his squashed Chevy Sprint, placed him on a backboard and moved him to 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
Helm, who had commuted from the docks to his home in Weaverville on weekends, 
was reported in serious but stable condition Tuesday in Oakland's Highland 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
When the Orange County team first got word of a possible survivor, Nicola said 
the members thought it might be another false alarm. There had been a series of 
such reports, but all had proved false. After spending several days removing 
bodies from the rubble, firefighters were becoming less hopeful of finding 
someone alive. 
</P>
<P>
Nicola said his adrenaline surged when he reached the car, which was no more 
than 30 inches high, and saw Helm's head just above the window. He used a 
penlight to peer into the crushed auto. 
</P>
<P>
"The dashboard was pretty much intact, and the steering wheel was down on his 
lap, but there was some play in it," Nicola said. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him to take a deep breath, and he did. It hurt him, but he was able to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
When Helm moved his legs, Nicola said he began to think there was a good chance 
that the dockworker would make it. 
</P>
<P>
Mackay, the rescue team engineer who operates the hydraulic jaws, was quickly 
called. Mackay said it took about an hour working in a 30-inch-by-36-inch space 
to free Helm. All told, there were about seven firefighters and paramedics 
working in the confined area. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until Helm slid from his concrete trap that the emotion rolled over 
his rescuers, Mackay said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I really took time to dwell on it," he said. "I really had 
tunnel vision. My assignment was to go in and extricate him. It really did not 
hit home until we slid him out. 
</P>
<P>
"Then the crowd just went wild. It was incredible. It was then that I realized 
what had happened." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Fire Chief Larry J. Holms called his men "masters of the 
understatement." He compared the area they were working in during the rescue to 
the space under a line of folding chairs. 
</P>
<P>
But the men themselves downplayed their role. 
</P>
<P>
"We were really just a small part of it," Nicola said. "It really honors 
everybody who was involved. . . . We couldn't have done it without all the team 
effort." 
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 career and volunteer firefighters work at 45 county stations 
serving unincorporated areas of the county and some cities that contract for 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The department's heavy rescue team is one of three such units in the state; all 
three responded to the quake disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Besides that team and equipment, the county also sent 29 mental health workers 
and 15 building officials to the affected areas. 
</P>
<P>
The Bay Area temblor was not a first for members of the Orange County team. 
Nicola and Shomber, a captain, were part of a group dispatched to Mexico City 
after the Mexican earthquakes of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In Mexico City, Nicola said, rescuers worked in places even more confined than 
on the Nimitz Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The firefighters who ventured into the narrow opening to extricate Helm said 
Tuesday that they did not think about what would happen if another major 
earthquake occurred while they worked, even though there were several smaller 
aftershocks while the rescue was under way. 
</P>
<P>
"We hoped we would bring someone out alive, and it came true," Aldrich said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fantastic," said Buster DuBrock after receiving his commendation. "I'm 
going to use my favorite word -- awesome!"

TEACHER VOTE SET ON PACT IN SCHOOL STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Spurred by mounting parental pressure, striking teachers and the Beverly Hills 
Unified School District reached a tentative settlement Tuesday afternoon, with 
teachers scheduled to vote on the agreement early today. 
</P>
<P>
Terms for ending the 12-day-old strike, the district's first, were not to be 
disclosed until they were presented to teachers this morning, but Judy 
McIntire, president of the teachers union, said the two-year agreement entailed 
"movement on both sides" from their earlier positions on salaries and benefits. 
The agreement included a pledge by parents to contribute $600,000 to sweeten 
the settlement, according to a parent close to the talks. 
</P>
<P>
Other parents said the one-time contribution by parents this year would be 
replaced in the second year by funds from a parcel tax -- if passed by city 
voters next June -- that would be permanently built into the salary schedule. 
</P>
<P>
School Supt. Robert French said teachers could be back on the job as early as 
this afternoon, depending on how quickly substitutes can remove their 
belongings. He said the district is working on a plan to keep the two groups 
from having to face each other after the highly emotional strike. 
</P>
<P>
"We are recommending the tentative agreement to you," McIntire told members 
after the settlement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers who are members of the union, the Beverly Hills Education Assn., will 
vote by secret ballot on the tentative agreement at 7 a.m. at the Beverly 
Hilton Hotel, McIntire said. 
</P>
<P>
Union leaders had wanted the nearly 300 teachers, counselors and librarians who 
struck the district Oct. 16 to vote on the settlement proposal Tuesday night 
and go back to work in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
But several teachers said they had made plans to take their children trick or 
treating, or celebrate a colleague's birthday, so the vote was postponed. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, teachers made what they hoped would be their final push, 
picketing Board of Education members' homes and marching up and down Beverly 
Drive after a mid-day rally. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel wonderful, relieved and at the same time excited. I welcome the 
teachers back," said school board President Dana Tomarken, who embraced 
McIntire upon word of the tentative settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Latin and French teacher Betty Nichols said, "If this is something the 
bargaining team recommends, it's probably the best bargain that can be gotten." 
</P>
<P>
Students also welcomed the news. Jason Tevelowitz, who headed up student 
support of the teachers and boycotted classes, said he wanted to go back to 
school but hoped "teachers don't rush into anything that's not satisfying." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement came amid growing frustration from parents, some of whom were 
scrambling to hire tutors and search for private schools for their children. 
Parents took an active role in the resolution of the strike, offering ideas, 
participating in negotiations and raising money to help pay for the raises the 
teachers demanded. 
</P>
<P>
"The parents were the key to this," said Albert Gersten, a parent and a leader 
of Children First, a community group formed to raise money after the district 
said it could not afford to meet the union's initial demand for 18% pay raises 
over two years. The district said it could afford only 11%. Since the strike 
began, parents have raised more than $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real big night . . . . We feel we have done our best to bring our 
teachers back with dignity, and we're real proud of all the parents who are 
involved in supplementing the (district's) offer," Gersten said. 
</P>
<P>
He said parents' groups have pledged to make available the $600,000 as quickly 
as possible and will distribute it to teachers "as soon as it is raised." In 
addition, Gersten said, the teachers union, Board of Education and parents will 
work to get the tax on each parcel of land in the city passed in the spring to 
bring more money to district coffers. 
</P>
<P>
City voters narrowly rejected a similar tax in March, 1987, when 60% approved 
it, short of the two-thirds vote required. 
</P>
<P>
Since the effects of declining enrollment and the 1978 initiative cutting 
property taxes began to be felt in full several years ago, the district has 
struggled to keep up its renowed academic programs. 
</P>
<P>
This year's $28.3-million budget, with a reserve fund of $1.3 million, included 
$4.6 million from the city of Beverly Hills, plus monies from a private 
foundation formed to raise funds for the district and from sales of sportswear 
with the famous high school's logo. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills teachers currently earn between $21,604 and $48,270 a year. 
Average salary is $42,659, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Many teachers in the 4,700-student district said they have been spending their 
own money for equipment and supplemental materials for years, despite the 
city's reputation for affluence. 
</P>
<P>
Parents who can afford to opened their checkbooks, but many are not wealthy, 
some residents said. 
</P>
<P>
As the strike entered its third week and attendance at the district's four 
kindergarten-through-eighth grade schools and the high school averaged around 
60%, parents on both sides were increasingly agitated by the impasse. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth, with all we've been doing, the ones who are going to 
pay the biggest price in this whole thing are the children," said Eileen Traub, 
who tutored her first- and fourth-graders to keep up with school work. 
</P>
<P>
College-bound students were especially anxious. One parent was reported to have 
called Harvard and UCLA to request they waive their deadlines for applicants' 
recommendations from teachers, and advanced placement students were scrambling 
for tutors. 
</P>
<P>
"There is only so much time in the school year, only so much time to make this 
up," said one parent.

DANK AND DANGEROUS: 'TUNNEL HANDS' DIG IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They call themselves "tunnel hands." They admit, with pride, that they're a 
totally different breed. 
</P>
<P>
They work underground -- in the case of Los Angeles' new Metro Rail subway 
system, about 60 to 80 feet below the surface -- down where the only light is a 
harsh, artificial glare filtered though a gritty fog of misting water, leaking 
hydraulic fluid and rock dust. 
</P>
<P>
These are the workers who actually dig the tunnels. It's noisy, smelly, 
punishing work -- the kind that involves lifting, pulling, prying and levering 
hour upon hour, day upon day in spaces often so confined that only one man can 
change positions at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a safety record on this job that is enviable, there is danger 
everywhere -- from falling rock, from flammable gasses and from 
shoulder-to-shoulder proximity to the immense and powerful machinery being used 
to gouge out the twin tunnels that will form the initial, 4.4-mile segment of 
the subway system between Union Station and MacArthur Park. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, in fact, two tunnel hands were hurt when a cable snapped between a 
construction locomotive and a heavy piece of equipment being dragged down one 
of the tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all of these men admit that they hated the work at first -- vowing that 
they would make their money, then get out. But somehow, while watching "the 
ones who aren't crazy" slip away after a few weeks, they stayed on through the 
years, going wherever the jobs happened to take them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the money that draws us," said Mel Rose, the 45-year-old tunnel 
superintendent on the half-mile stretch of subway that will run beneath Hill 
Street from the Civic Center to Pershing Square. "Then there's the challenge. 
And the danger. I like the danger too." 
</P>
<P>
Rose was just 19 years old -- his major league dreams shattered after his 
pitching arm went dead during a stint with a Triple-A baseball team in the 
Detroit Tigers organization -- when some mining jobs opened up on the Oroville 
Dam project in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
"They offered $3.27 an hour," he recalled a few days ago. "That was big money 
back then. So I got in the tunnel business." 
</P>
<P>
Marion Eastern, a miner in his 50s, said the pay -- now $20 an hour or more -- 
can look awfully good when, as he was, you're fresh out of the service, short 
on training, short on education and short on cash. 
</P>
<P>
"I went underground because that's the job that somebody offered," Eastern 
said, pausing briefly between a variety of tasks that included shoveling up 
muck, laying rails, loading train cars and heaving massive tunnel-shoring 
timbers into place. 
</P>
<P>
"I started in '61," he said. "I'm still at it." 
</P>
<P>
The challenge facing Rose, Eastern and the other members of the tunneling crew 
is to get the job done on time and to get it done right. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of things can go wrong, and over the months many of them have. But 
unlike some teams on some other segments of the subway, Rose's men were 
virtually on schedule last week. One of their twin tunnels was done, with less 
than six feet to go on the other. 
</P>
<P>
That means -- with the exception of one of the two tunnels between the Civic 
Center and the subway's eastern terminus at the railroad station -- all the 
major digging on the initial phase of the system is done or largely completed. 
</P>
<P>
Rose had chosen Tony Anderson, a lean, 30-year-old miner from Utah, to run the 
excavating machine that would tunnel the last five feet or so, right up to the 
steel and wood shoring for the Metro Rail station under construction beside the 
underground parking garage at Pershing Square. 
</P>
<P>
A cylindrical cutting tube, slightly larger than the 22-foot diameter of the 
completed tunnel, had been shoved forward on its hydraulic jacks for the last 
time, slicing like a giant cookie cutter about four feet through the earth. The 
tube, in addition to cutting the tunnel, serves as a protective shield in which 
the miners can work. 
</P>
<P>
The cutting work completed, Anderson climbed into a tiny seat alongside a 
hydraulically powered backhoe mounted inside the tube. Using the backhoe, which 
is fitted with a large, flat spade, Anderson scraped up the dirt that had been 
sliced free by the forward edge of the tube. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson shoveled the loosened soil onto a conveyor belt on the tunnel's floor. 
The belt carried the dirt back though the tunnel to a string of waiting train 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
It was slow, painstaking work that required a deft touch to avoid the station's 
shoring. Under Rose's watchful eye, Anderson gave a perfect performance. 
</P>
<P>
"He's worked out pretty well," Rose said with a smug grin. "You know, I gave 
him a break, hired him off another job and put him here. He's a good hand." 
</P>
<P>
The crew clambered down to the tunnel face to pose for a couple of photographs. 
A few large clumps of dirt tumbled down, reminders of the danger that is always 
lurking. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody seemed very worried then, and they weren't deterred by the accident a 
few days later that promised to lay up two crew members for a week or more. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, as Rose had suggested earlier, the element of danger seems to attract 
people like him. He reminisced fondly about several of his closer calls. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in Colorado once, in a molybdenum mine," he said. "The (tunnel) caved in 
right behind us, and we were trapped. We had water and air, but no food or 
light. We had to just sit there and wait for them to come and get us. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We could hear them coming, so I wasn't scared. But it took them two days to 
get us out." 
</P>
<P>
There was another time, though, when he was working near the top of a vertical 
shaft that he was plenty scared. 
</P>
<P>
"This door caught me and almost knocked me off," he said. "I almost fell 3,700 
feet, all the way to the bottom, but I caught this strap and hung on. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I was making $580 a day on that job, but that did it. I quit." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Rose admitted that it wasn't long before he was back on the job 
again, drawn by the money and another kind of excitement. 
</P>
<P>
"This is damned hard work and it breaks a lot of people," he said. "But I've 
kept at it, working my way slowly up, and now I'm the tunnel superintendent 
with about 80 people working for me. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in a position these days where I can help the young ones . . . people like 
Anderson . . . get a start. If a man's willing to work, I can teach him the 
business. . . . I guess that's what I really like the best."

FAMILY HEALTH CLINICS PREPARE TO CUT SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County family planning operators are preparing to drastically reduce and 
possibly eliminate services in coming months as a result of state funding cuts, 
leaving thousands of poor women with inadequate health care, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Several clinics have cut back hours and trimmed staffs. Soon they will begin 
charging patients for services that used to be free. 
</P>
<P>
At many clinics, women must now wait at least four weeks to get an appointment. 
Those waits are likely to increase, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
County health providers fear the long-term impact will be an increase of 
unwanted pregnancies and, for many poor women, insufficient medical care. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a perfect example of those who can afford it getting private medical care 
and the poor going without," said William Plumb, director of the Laguna Beach 
Community Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Health officials said that more than 55,000 Orange County women received 
services at 12 state-subsidized clinics last year. The officials estimate that 
25,000 women served by the four county and eight privately run clinics could be 
affected in some way by the funding cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Plumb said that many poor women rely on family planning services for basic 
care. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether it is for contraceptives or Pap smears, these services are often a 
first line of defense against cervical cancer and other diseases," Plumb said. 
"Poor women will be without that kind of checkup, and when they finally do 
discover their illness, it will be too late." 
</P>
<P>
As she waited for an appointment at the county's Santa Ana clinic Tuesday, Sara 
Cortez, a 31-year-old Santa Ana mother of four who recently began using the 
clinic, said she has few other options. 
</P>
<P>
Cortez said her husband's construction job does not provide health insurance, 
so she had been paying a private physician to care for her children, ages 10, 
9, 8 and 5. She sought out the Santa Ana clinic when the family could no longer 
afford the private care. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be very detrimental to me and my friends if services here were cut," 
she said. "Because of our income, we are limited in possibilities. We could not 
afford to pay again." 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Beach clinic, which provides a complete range of medical services, 
lost 75% of its state family planning subsidy -- from $44,000 last year to 
$11,000 this year, Plumb said. 
</P>
<P>
Remaining funds will run out by mid-December, and the clinic will begin 
charging all patients for services. If patient fees do not cover costs, family 
planning services might be eliminated, Plumb said. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Earlabaugh, director of the Huntington Beach Community Clinic, said her 
facility faces a similar crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic lost $200,000 in state funding this year, nearly one-third of its 
total budget. Several positions have been eliminated and others reduced to 
part-time in an attempt to reduce expenses, Earlabaugh said. The clinic has 
reduced its operating hours from 35 to 28 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult for a small, free-standing agency to sustain a loss like 
that," she said. "We expect our money to last through November, and then we 
will ask patients to pay for services. But we won't know the full impact of our 
situation until that money is used up." 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian in July cut the state family planning budget nearly 
two-thirds, from $36.2 million to $12.1 million a year, despite entreaties from 
state and local family planning providers. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian asserted that the rising rate of teen-age pregnancy in the state 
showed that the programs are not working and suggested that services would 
remain readily available. 
</P>
<P>
Other state-subsidized clinics affected by funding cuts are the privately run 
Orange County Center for Health and the Coalition Concerned With Adolescent 
Pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
"When every agency is forced to eliminate so much, you can't get (services) 
easily elsewhere," said Barbara Jackson, public affairs coordinator for Planned 
Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said Planned Parenthood clinics have had to absorb at least 500 
patients who were left without services after the Anaheim Counseling Center was 
closed in July. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim center served up to 10,000 women and closed amid anticipation of 
reduced state funding, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said women must now wait three or four weeks for an appointment at the 
county's four Planned Parenthood clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Martha Bahena, a 19-year-old Santa Ana mother of a 2-year-old daughter, said 
such waits will mean more pregnancies for teens. 
</P>
<P>
"If girls don't get birth control, they will get pregnant," said Bahena while 
waiting Tuesday to make an appointment at the county's Santa Ana clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Family planning services at the four county-run comprehensive health clinics 
have not been cut or scaled back yet, but officials said such cuts are likely. 
</P>
<P>
The lost state funding represents nearly 30% -- or about $412,000 -- of this 
year's family planning budget, said Leonard Foster, deputy director of the 
county's maternal and child care services. 
</P>
<P>
Foster said the agency has been able to draw revenue from other health care 
activities to continue the previous level of family planning services. 
</P>
<P>
And he said county officials still hope that the Legislature will restore some 
or all of the family planning funds, despite an unsuccessful effort to move 
lawmakers in that direction and the recent Bay Area earthquake, which will 
place even greater demands on the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
"Until the Legislature completes its work, we are unwilling to make the drastic 
reduction in services that would be required," Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
If funds are not restored, county officials will consider a number of ways to 
scale back services but probably will not close clinics, Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been with the county for 20 years, and this is the worst time I've 
seen," said Julia Arriaza, a nursing supervisor at the Santa Ana clinic. "It is 
very scary. We all see the need of our clientele, and we can't hide. They are 
going to be knocking at our doors."

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RULING SETS STAGE FOR TRIAL OF REDISTRICT 
SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge Tuesday rejected Los Angeles County's request to throw out a 
lawsuit accusing the Board of Supervisors of drawing its districts in a way to 
prevent the election of a Latino to the five-member board. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon's ruling sets the stage for a Nov. 21 trial 
on the federal lawsuit seeking to require the supervisors to create a 
Latino-majority district. The lawsuit alleges that the supervisors split the 
the county's 2 million Latinos among three districts, thereby weakening their 
political power in violation of the U.S. Voting Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the county's claim that it cannot be forced to redistrict before 
1991 unless the 1981 redistricting plan was found to be illegal, Kenyon said 
that the intent of the voting rights law "would be obviated if a violation 
could not be rectified for the entire 10-year period." 
</P>
<P>
County Counsel De Witt Clinton said Tuesday the county will argue at trial that 
a district with a majority of Latino voters cannot be created, using 1980 U.S. 
Census figures. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the U.S. Justice Department, the American Civil Liberties Union 
and the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund have contended that the county 
could create a Latino majority district east and southeast of downtown Los 
Angeles under current population estimates.

BROTHER MICHAEL'S MISSION TO CARRY ON

<P>
Officers of Brother Michael's Christian Mission announced Tuesday that they 
will continue to feed the poor, carrying on the work of Michael Dwaileebe, the 
self-styled missionary who died last week at age 80. 
</P>
<P>
For 30 years, Dwaileebe spent six days a week gathering and distributing food 
for the needy. Most recently he was doling out beans, rice and eggs to about 
150 people every morning at South Coast Christian Church in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Since his death of a heart attack, volunteers have carried on a scaled-down 
version of his "one-man show," accepting donations and serving about 50 people 
a day, said Bob Ewing, church pastor. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope by Thanksgiving to have it back near where we were before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dwaileebe, a "born-again" Christian who called himself Brother Michael, 
solicited a special holiday food collection every year, Ewing said. 
</P>
<P>
The church will serve a Thanksgiving dinner for the needy from noon to 3 p.m. 
on Nov. 23, he said. LYNN SMITH

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRUSTEES' PANEL ENDORSES 5% FEE HIKE AT CAL 
STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cost of an education at California State University would increase about 5% 
next year under a proposal approved Tuesday by a trustee's committee. 
</P>
<P>
Fees for the academic year would be $744, or $36 more, for a full-time student 
and $426, or $18 more, for a part-time student at the 20 campuses in the Cal 
State System, if the plan, approved by committee members meeting in Long Beach, 
survives review by the Legislature and governor. Those figures do not include 
costs for room, board, parking or books. 
</P>
<P>
The fee increase was part of a $1.89 billion 1990-'91 operating budget request 
from the finance committee of the Cal State Board of Trustees. That budget, 
which would be 15.2% higher than this year's, is expected to win approval from 
the full board today . In addition, the trustees will ask the state government 
for $214 million for building projects and at least $38 million more for pay 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
The 360,000 students in the Cal State System saw their fees increase 3.6% this 
year. An unexpected surplus in the state budget led to a rollback from what was 
supposed to be a much-protested 10% jump this fall.

CAR DEALER'S DINER TO CHANGE CLIENTELE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lee West, the besieged purveyor of exotic cars and mainstream hamburgers at his 
auto dealership, will keep the Jaguar Diner open to his employees after the 
Newport Beach City Council ordered him to close the cafe to the public. 
</P>
<P>
"He will operate the diner for employees," West's lawyer, Richard Dear, said 
Tuesday. "We will try to get the paper work together to move forward to meet 
all city conditions for a full-scale restaurant. We want to be a good citizen. 
His livelihood is there." 
</P>
<P>
Late Monday night, the City Council listened to protests by West's opponents 
for more than an hour and voted to close the diner at Newport Imports on West 
Coast Highway until West could show that he meets all land-use requirements. 
</P>
<P>
West's diner was brought to the council's attention by Dr. Jan Vandersloot of 
Newport Beach, who had appealed the Planning Commission's approval of the 
Jaguar Diner more than six weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Vandersloot, who did not expect to prevail, wanted the restaurant closed 
because city-required studies and West's own research to assess the cafe's 
impact on traffic were inadequate. He contended that West also put the cart 
before the horse by building the cafe first and getting city approval second. 
</P>
<P>
When West submitted plans for a new dealership two years ago, the city approved 
it along with a cafeteria for his employees. Shortly thereafter, West said he 
changed his mind about the cafeteria and installed a diner for customers. 
</P>
<P>
Word soon leaked out, and the city said no go, citing a lack of parking and 
increased traffic around the dealership. Nevertheless, West opened the diner 
without proper permits in May. The city sued but never pursued the case. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, West commissioned his own traffic study, which turned out to be 
favorable to his side. He said he also bought property next door to the 
dealership to make room for parking -- all of which has brought him into 
compliance with the Municipal Code. 
</P>
<P>
Dear said Tuesday that West had received permission from the city to operate 
his cafe for employees when the dealership opened. Now, he said, it is just a 
matter of showing the council that West has bought property next door to 
Newport Imports to provide the required parking. 
</P>
<P>
But, Dear said, no one has been assigned to check for employees at the door of 
the diner. 
</P>
<P>
"If a customer came in and said, 'Can I get a cup of coffee?,' I don't know 
what would happen." DAN WEIKEL

VENTILATION SYSTEM EXTINGUISHES BLAZE

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County fire officials credited a properly working ventilation system at 
an Irvine manufacturing plant for the rapid control of a fire early Tuesday 
that broke out in equipment to control air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Hazardous-materials specialists were called to Holt Integrated Circuits on 
Jeronimo Road in Irvine because the company uses acids and other potent 
chemicals. The fire was confined and put out after it broke out about 4:30 a.m. 
without endangering the chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Garner, vice president of the company, said the fire was confined to a 
device on the roof that screens out manufacturing gases before they are 
released into the atmosphere. He said the hazardous chemicals are stored in a 
different part of the building.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ILL JUROR PROMPTS DELAY IN MCMARTIN 
PRE-SCHOOL TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The long McMartin Pre-School molestation trial hit another snag Tuesday when a 
juror's eye problem postponed the prosecution's final day of closing arguments 
until today. 
</P>
<P>
Barring further delays and after lengthy instructions from Los Angeles Superior 
Court Judge William Pounders, the case is expected to go to the jury on 
Thursday, after 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62, are charged with 65 
counts of molestation and conspiracy involving 11 youngsters who attended their 
family-run nursery school in Manhattan Beach. Both are free on bail. 
</P>
<P>
Each side was allotted 6 1/2 days for final arguments, in an effort to speed up 
the proceedings and avoid a mistrial. The case has lasted six years and cost 
county taxpayers more than $15 million. The jury, which once had six 
alternates, is down to its final 12 members, due to health and job problems. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Lael Rubin, who has said she will finish her remarks today, 
a half day before her deadline, has the last word because the burden of proof 
is on the prosecution.

VASQUEZ TO SPEAK ON TRAFFIC, DEVELOPMENT

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez will discuss traffic, development issues and 
construction of a water pipeline through South Orange County at a homeowners' 
meeting tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"Traffic is probably one of the No. 1 concerns of people in this area, and this 
will give them an opportunity to talk about it with Supervisor Vasquez," said 
Roger Thomas, a board member of the Lake Forest Drive Assn., which is 
sponsoring the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The association represents about 200 homes in Sterling Heights. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a pipeline that will route water into Mission Viejo will be up for 
discussion. Residents of the area are concerned that the pipeline, which will 
be built starting Jan. 9, could add to South County's congested traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting will begin at 7 p.m. and will be held in the multipurpose room of 
Serrano Intermediate School, 24642 Jeronimo Road, El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
An open forum will follow Vasquez's remarks, Thomas said.

'RENT-A-JUDGES' MIGHT HARM COURT SYSTEM, LAWYERS SAY ; 
</P>
<P>
JUDICIARY: BAR OFFICIALS WARN OF A TREND THAT COULD LEAD TO A 'PRIVATE JUSTICE 
SYSTEM' FOR THE WEALTHY AND PLACE AN ADDED STRAIN ON THE PUBLIC LEGAL 
STRUCTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED ROHRLICH, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leaders of state and national lawyers' groups warned in Los Angeles on Tuesday 
that increased use of private "rent-a-judges" to settle disputes may be leading 
to a two-tiered system of justice -- one for the rich and one for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Raven, president of the American Bar Assn. last year, told a committee 
investigating rent-a-judges that he fears the evolution of "a private justice 
system for those who can afford it, and an even more crippled system for the 
poor and those charged with crimes." 
</P>
<P>
Rent-a-judges are retired judges who are usually hired by businesses or wealthy 
individuals to preside over the settlement of their disputes. Those who cannot 
afford their fees must wait as long as five years for their civil disputes to 
come to trial in some busy urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
Raven said courts in the nation's urban areas are already overburdened and have 
had to cut back drastically on the number of civil jury trials to accommodate 
soaring numbers of criminal cases involving drugs. Criminal cases have 
constitutional priority over civil cases. 
</P>
<P>
Raven told the committee, appointed by California Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas, 
that he expects the situation to worsen. 
</P>
<P>
"As we begin to put more and more resources into the criminal justice system, 
which we must do, the civil system will be overwhelmed in two or three years," 
Raven told the committee at a public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Rothenberg, president of the State Bar of California, echoed Raven's 
remarks, saying the civil justice system in California is already overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg said he feared that increased use of private judges by the 
well-to-do will lessen political pressures to provide more resources for public 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
Private judges hire themselves out at fees that often reach $250 an hour or 
more for mediation or binding arbitration. In addition, with the approval of 
sitting judges, private judges can conduct trials or referee certain pretrial 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
More and more litigants are hiring private judges to resolve commercial and 
family disputes, legal experts say. But because much of the work takes place in 
private, no public agency knows exactly how much of it goes on. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts who fear the phenomenon of private judging warn that it poses a 
threat of "brain drain" to the public court system. These experts say they are 
concerned that talented judges will be tempted to retire early by the prospect 
of making more money under cushier working conditions. 
</P>
<P>
But John C. Woolley, president of the California Judges Assn. and a Superior 
Court judge in Orange County, disputed that theory. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed to a statistical study by the National Center for State Courts that 
showed the pace of judges' retirements holding steady throughout the 1980s. 
Woolley said he does not see private judging as "a fearsome force that will do 
in the public system." 
</P>
<P>
John K. Trotter, a retired California Court of Appeal judge who heads the 
largest rent-a-judge operation in California, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Trotter, whose firm, Judicial Arbitration &amp; Mediation Services, has 91 
judges handling about 7,000 cases this year, said he could not understand why 
retired judges were being singled out for scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
He said there is nothing new about resolving disputes outside court, noting 
that the 63-year-old American Arbitration Assn. handles 50,000 cases a year, 
that the securities industry routinely uses arbitration in its disputes, and 
that mediation and arbitration are widely used by school districts, labor 
unions and medical providers. 
</P>
<P>
"If all of these other forms of private, consensual, paid-for dispute 
resolution processes do not demean the courts, it is difficult to assume the 
existence of private judging will," Trotter said.

<P>
JURY ASKED TO PROBE BID TO OUST COOPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY ENG

<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Daniel H. Young on Tuesday called for a grand jury investigation of an 
attempt to oust City Atty. Edward J. Cooper, claiming that three council 
members involved have conflicts of interest because of past or current 
litigation with the city. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the district attorney's office, Young said council member 
Richards L. Norton voted to place Cooper on 60-day administrative leave despite 
a lawsuit he had filed against Santa Ana and a countersuit the city had filed 
against his company, Norton-Western Enterprise. The case is pending. 
</P>
<P>
Young also included a memo by Cooper outlining possible conflicts of interest 
of council members John Acosta and Miguel A. Pulido, both of whom have been 
involved in litigation with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Cooper filed a complaint against Acosta for a zoning violation. And 
in 1984, Pulido's family sued the city when the family's muffler shop was 
threatened by redevelopment. The attempt to oust Cooper has broken the uneasy 
truce between two factions of the council that often engage in bickering. In 
the middle is Cooper, 50, who has been the city's attorney for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
Norton responded Tuesday by saying that he welcomed an investigation but called 
the mayor's actions "political, childish and vengeful." 
</P>
<P>
"My personal attorney has advised me that there is no conflict of interest," 
Norton said. "The city attorney has not brought up the issue of conflict of 
interest. Only the mayor has. It's Ed Cooper's duty to advise council members 
if there is a conflict of interest. On this point, he said nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Four council members -- Acosta, Pulido, Norton and Ron May -- voted in private 
session on Oct. 17 to put Cooper on a 60-day leave of absence. Young and 
council members Daniel E. Griset and Patricia A. McGuigan stormed out in 
protest. The four who oppose Cooper have refused in interviews to say why they 
tried the action. 
</P>
<P>
In a press release, Norton has said: "My vote to approve the administrative 
review of the city attorney's office was based solely on setting to rest, once 
and for all, the allegations and innuendoes that have been made in recent 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"They have never indicated any allegation or innuendo against me," said Cooper, 
who has steadfastly refused to leave his post, contending that five votes were 
needed to put him on leave. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper places most of the blame on Norton and Acosta. 
</P>
<P>
In a May memo to Acosta, included in the request for a grand jury 
investigation, Cooper wrote: "It has been no secret to me that you have desired 
to terminate my employment with the city since I was forced to file a 
misdemeanor criminal complaint against you for a zoning violation. One of my 
former subordinates related last year that you told him, at the Santiago Club, 
you were going to 'have my job."' 
</P>
<P>
The attempted ouster of Cooper could jeopardize projects such as the Santa Ana 
sports arena, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
"Developers have to know that the council is united and working together. This 
kind of action sends a signal that four of them don't know what they are 
doing," Young added. 
</P>
<P>
That's "nonsense," countered Norton. "Cooper is not the only attorney in the 
whole city government." LILY ENG

<P>
GROWTH MANAGEMENT PUT INTO GENERAL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although this small city of 12,500 people is built almost to capacity, concern 
about exploding growth in neighboring cities prompted the City Council this 
week to approve a growth management plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Although we can't base our own plans and development on what goes on in these 
towns, we need to monitor what they are doing," Mayor pro Tem Robert P. 
Wahlstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
There are few undeveloped areas within the borders of Los Alamitos. However, 
there has been a profusion of new developments in cities such as Cypress, 
Garden Grove and Long Beach, which border Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic has already increased on Katella Avenue and Los Alamitos Boulevard 
because of the new developments, Councilwoman Alice Jempsa said. 
</P>
<P>
"As we have seen with Cypress Downs (a new development in Cypress on its border 
with Los Alamitos), we must work in conjunction with our neighbors to have a 
say in something that impacts our traffic so much," Jempsa said. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted to add a growth management element to the city's General 
Plan. Council members also approved other changes to the plan, including 
rezoning a block in the Old Town West neighborhood for residences instead of 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a plumbing business's employee parking lot, all of the existing 
buildings in the rezoned block -- bounded by Chestnut, Florista and Catalina 
streets and an alley -- are residential. KATHIE BOZANICH

HARRIET GETS HIGH GRADES AS SCHOOL'S GHOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 58 children who live on isolated ranches and homes scattered around the 
mountain community of Gorman celebrated Halloween by showing up for class 
Tuesday dressed as monsters, ballerinas, pirates and devils. 
</P>
<P>
Their costumes represented nearly everything, in fact, except ghosts. 
</P>
<P>
Kids in Gorman do not have to pretend to be ghosts. That is because they say 
their school is haunted by a real one. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard it, and I've seen it," sixth-grader Matt Hogan explained earnestly. 
"I saw it just a few weeks ago. It was a girl in a blue dress, and it was was 
standing on the school stage next to Ted Sandoval, a kid in my class." 
</P>
<P>
The apparition disappeared when 11-year-old Matt ran from the auditorium to 
summon teacher-principal Wesley Thomas. Ted, 13, never saw the ghost. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas has never seen it, either. But he said he has heard it rattling through 
the 51-year-old schoolhouse that sits next to the Golden State Freeway about 65 
miles north of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard strange sounds. Doors closing, things knocking into other things, 
when nobody else is around," said Thomas, who has taught at the small school 
for three years. "The community up here believes the ghost is here. Some of the 
things that happen here are awfully strange." 
</P>
<P>
Teacher Joanne Yolton-Pouder, who has 19 kindergartners and first- and 
second-graders in her classroom, said she was skeptical about stories of the 
Gorman Ghost when she first signed on as a faculty member two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"But a couple of Thursdays ago when I came to work, my classroom door was 
locked shut," she said. "I had been the last one to leave the night before. And 
we don't have keys for the old locks. 
</P>
<P>
"And then I was sitting at my desk and looked up at the bulletin board where I 
had drawn a tree and pinned up 19 little paper apples, one for each of my kids. 
I counted them and there were 20 apples up there. When I went over to look, I 
found the extra one. It had the name 'Harriet' on it." 
</P>
<P>
"Harriet" is the legendary name of a girl who was purportedly run over and 
killed by a tractor in the 1920s near the present site of the school. Some 
Gorman residents contend that the child was buried beneath what is now the 
school auditorium. They claim it is Harriet that haunts the school -- in a 
friendly sort of way. 
</P>
<P>
Seventh-grader Lisa Graham, 12, said she and friend Stacey Hoosier, 13, spent 
more than an hour stacking books in the school's book closet last year when the 
ghost struck. 
</P>
<P>
"We closed the closet door and locked it. But a few minutes later we got the 
key and went back in to get a book and found that everything was dumped on the 
floor," Lisa said. "Books were scattered everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Stacey, who is an eighth-grader, said her late aunt -- who worked for years as 
the Gorman School office manager -- had a personal encounter with the ghost 10 
years ago. It was a female voice, and it urged Marie Ralphs not to leave the 
schoolhouse that evening. 
</P>
<P>
"My aunt ignored the voice and walked out and slipped and fell and broke her 
arm and right hip. She'd never believed in the ghost until then," Stacey said. 
</P>
<P>
Although some students dismiss the ghost stories, others at the school said 
they have had their own close encounters of the weird kind. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard footsteps on the stage and doors slam," said Mary Jane Fuller, 
school maintenance supervisor for six years. "Three weeks ago, I was sure 
somebody was standing behind me, but when I turned around to say something, 
nobody was there. 
</P>
<P>
"We had one employee who encountered the ghost as she walked out the front 
door. It scared her so she never came back." 
</P>
<P>
Judy Conant, who teaches grades 3, 4 and 5, said a heavy interior hallway door 
"opened 90 degrees and stayed open" when she approached it a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard it knock on the bathroom walls," said seventh-grader Alvin 
Anderson, 12. Alvin was dressed up as a gorilla as he munched yellow and black 
cupcakes at the school Halloween party. 
</P>
<P>
Alvin said he planned to pass up trick-or-treating in the isolated canyon south 
of Gorman, where he lives on a ranch and his closest neighbors live in the next 
valley over. 
</P>
<P>
"You knock on people's doors up here dressed like this, and they'd probably get 
a shotgun and go KERPLOW at you," he explained.

ACLU SUES IN 46-YEAR FIGHT TO CLEAR SAILOR'S NAME; 
</P>
<P>
BENEFITS: SON CARRIES ON BATTLE FOR HIS LATE FATHER WHO WAS DENIED VETERAN'S 
COMPENSATION AFTER A WWII RACIAL INCIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California filed suit Tuesday in 
U.S. Claims Court to force the U.S. government to pay lost veteran's benefits 
to the heirs of a sailor who was wrongfully given an undesirable discharge from 
the service during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The suit seeks to end the 46-year-old battle to clear Thomas Flanagan's name 
and compensate Flanagan's heirs for his wrongful discharge from the Navy, which 
accused him of being a ringleader of black sailors involved in a 1942 race riot 
in Vallejo, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a national injustice that has festered like an open wound for too long," 
said Gary Williams, one of two attorneys handling the suit for the ACLU. "I'm 
happy that the case is about to be rectified, but I'm sad that Mr. Flanagan 
passed away before he could be vindicated." 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan, who died last year at 64, did manage to persuade the Navy in 1979 to 
change his discharge status to honorable, but until recently, that was his only 
redress. The Los Angeles resident had lost large amounts of money in back 
military pay and veteran's benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"He was bitter, very bitter," Williams said. "In the end, he was angry that he 
did not get relief. He said, 'I joined . . . to fight the enemy, but now I find 
the enemy was really within.' " 
</P>
<P>
Last year, President Reagan signed special legislation sponsored by Rep. Mervyn 
M. Dymally (D-Compton) and Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) giving Flanagan's 
heirs the right to bypass the statute of limitations and sue for his lost 
benefits. The ACLU's suit was filed on behalf of Flanagan's 16-year-old son, 
Thomas, who lives with relatives in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan's troubles began on Dec. 27, 1942, when he was a 19-year-old sailor at 
the Naval Ammunition Depot at Mare Island, Calif. While on liberty near 
Vallejo, he said he saw white Marines and shore patrolmen firing into an angry 
crowd of black sailors. He reported the incident to his commanding officer and 
asked what could be done about it. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, Flanagan was accused of inciting the melee and put on a train out 
of town. His undesirable discharge was based on the accusation that he had 
"promoted ill feelings and racial prejudice and that he had been a ringleader 
in stirring up trouble and discontent among blacks," according to court 
records. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to costing him his veteran's benefits, the taint of the undesirable 
discharge, Flanagan had said, made it difficult for him to return to his job as 
a steelworker. 
</P>
<P>
As Flanagan told The Times in an interview three years ago, "I'm still not 
free. All these years of washing dishes -- I could have been somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said Flanagan's case is symptomatic of a problem that existed for many 
black World War II and Korean veterans. 
</P>
<P>
"Many blacks have been disciplined or discharged because of their race without 
any hope or sense of remedy," he said. "It is not enough to change the 
discharge to honorable and say everything is OK. You have to do more to 
compensate those who have been seriously wronged by the system." 
</P>
<P>
Under the legislation approved by Congress, Flanagan's heirs will be allowed to 
seek compensation only for loss of veteran's benefits, not the loss of a 
career, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU has asked experts to determine how much the lost benefits amount to in 
today's dollars. Danna L. Cook, who is working on the case with Williams, said, 
"The government could settle out of court and end it very quickly, or it could 
take years if they decide to fight it." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said Thomas Flanagan "wants to see his father's memory vindicated, and 
this is the way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
"It is one of the things his father talked about a lot, especially toward the 
end of his life," he said.

LOG CABIN DREAM NOW A NIGHTMARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA MASCARO and GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Leo Black found a great deal on some logs a couple years ago, he bought 
them and set his heart on building a log cabin in a bucolic setting on the 
Central California coast. 
</P>
<P>
But after the real estate deal fell through and the logs sat idle in his 
driveway, he found himself mired in less-than-tranquil circumstances, facing 
angry neighbors and a pending court order to get rid of his logs. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not much I can do about it," said Black, who placed advertisements to 
sell the logs in local newspapers Tuesday morning. "If I can't sell them in 14 
days, I'm just going to cut them up and try to sell them for firewood." 
</P>
<P>
About 2 1/2 years ago Black, a 20-year resident of Cypress, bought the lumber 
from a shipping company in Wilmington, paying $3,500 for the log cabin kit. He 
says the kit included everything needed to build a log cabin, except for the 
roof, windows and door. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he was trying to buy property near Lake Santa Margarita near 
San Luis Obispo. It seemed a perfect match, with the land almost bought and the 
cabin kit in hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I could put it together myself, that's my business," said Black, an electrical 
contractor employed by De Maria Electric in Wilmington. "I can do it with my 
hands. It's no problem." 
</P>
<P>
But when the property sale fell through, problems mounted. 
</P>
<P>
For six months, Black ignored orders from the city of Cypress to remove the 
logs from his driveway, where they had been declared a public nuisance. On 
Monday, he appealed to the City Council to allow him to keep the 12-foot logs 
until January, when he said he would be able to move them. 
</P>
<P>
That motion was denied. Now, he has 14 days to remove the logs or face a court 
order allowing the city to remove them and send the bill to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't afford to pay the city, there's no telling what they'll charge me," 
said Black, 34. "I'm a single parent with three kids; I can't afford to take 
time off and haul them up north." 
</P>
<P>
According to the city Planning Department, the logs violate the public nuisance 
ordinance of the city code. 
</P>
<P>
So now, Black says, he has no choice but to sell the logs and hope to break 
even while he laments the way his neighbors and the city have handled the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
Eight complaint letters have been sent to the city since April; however, none 
of the neighbors involved could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the worst thing about it was there was this big sign in the yard, 
'Public Nuisance,' " Black said. "I felt really degraded." 
</P>
<P>
Black considers himself a good citizen. 
</P>
<P>
He coaches boys' soccer for a city team every weekday and helps neighbors with 
their electrical problems when they need him. For the past 10 years he has 
lived in his one-story house on the cul-de-sac of New Mexico Lane, and for 
seven years before that, he lived directly across the street. He maintains his 
garden and trims his lawn just as neighbors do, he said, and has never 
complained when another neighbor's front yard was not up to par. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems kind of strange," he said of his neighbors' complaints. "I thought we 
were friends." 
</P>
<P>
He said he is trying not to mourn too heavily the loss of his dream of a log 
cabin in the country. Originally from Utah, Black called himself "kind of a 
country boy at heart" who knows that someday he will be "someplace where 
there's mountains and it snows." LISA MASCARO and GREG HERNANDEZ

7,110-ACRE HOUSING PROJECT ENDORSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A plan to build homes on 7,110 acres east of Orange received the unanimous 
endorsement of the city Planning Commission on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
When the development is complete, it is expected to contain up to 12,350 homes, 
businesses, schools and parks. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, by a 4-0 vote, recommended that the City Council approve the 
East Orange General Plan, a joint proposal of the Irvine Co., which owns the 
property, and the city. Commissioner Randy Bosch abstained. 
</P>
<P>
Before approving the plan, commissioners made several changes, including 
increasing the minimum lot size to 6,000 square feet and the minimum driveway 
length to 20 feet, city planner Jere Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, commissioners said that they want a four-lane street, Jamboree 
Road, to run north from Santiago Canyon Road to the Riverside Freeway before 
any occupancy occurs in the development. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is tentatively scheduled to consider the plan at its Nov. 21 
meeting.

UPS' 757 PASSES AIRPORT NOISE TEST

United Parcel Service successfully flew a Boeing 757 out of John Wayne Airport 
Tuesday -- without violating noise-abatement standards. The cargo carrier is 
seeking permission from Orange County officials to begin cargo flights to 
Kansas City when the new, $50-million John Wayne passenger terminal opens in 
April, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Midway Airline passed the noise tests with a McDonnell Douglas 
MD-87. Under the airport's proposed new flight allocations for April, Midway 
would be entitled to one flight each day to Chicago.

Meanwhile, Federal Express, which has led the fight by air cargo carriers for 
access to John Wayne, plans to test a Boeing 727 on Friday in hopes of getting 
permission to originate a nonstop flight to Memphis, Tenn., in April. 
</P>
<P>
So far no cargo carriers have been allocated flights because of Orange County 
officials' longstanding opposition to air cargo operations at the 
space-squeezed, noise-sensitive airport with a runway that ends near a Newport 
Beach residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Express has threatened to sue the county if it cannot gain access to 
John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials have been skeptical about the 727's ability to meet the 
county's strict aircraft noise standards and have argued that both UPS and 
Federal Express have demanded ground facilities for which there is no room. 
</P>
<P>
The airport's flight allocations will be up for review at a public hearing to 
be held by the County Airport Commission at 7 p.m. Nov. 8 in the County Hall of 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
American Airlines has lobbied strongly to retain its current flight allocations 
in the face of stiff competition from other air carriers who want a bigger 
share of the Orange County market. American recently sent thousands of letters 
to members of its frequent flier program urging them to write or call the Board 
of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard that this tactic isn't going over too well with county government," 
said airport spokeswoman Kathie Rutherford. 
</P>
<P>
American Airlines officials could not be reached for comment late Tuesday.

MARINOVICH HAS PASSING MARKS; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: THE WAY THE USC QUARTERBACK IS THROWING, HE IS ON TARGET TO 
BREAK MANY OF THE SCHOOL'S RECORDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After USC quarterback Todd Marinovich threw four touchdown passes against Ohio 
State, his uncle, Craig Fertig, a Trojan quarterback in the 1960s, came up to 
him grinning. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you tied my record," said Fertig, who once threw four touchdown passes 
against Cal. "But you didn't break it." 
</P>
<P>
Shot back Marinovich: "I've got time." 
</P>
<P>
Does he ever. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich broke another of his uncle's marks last Saturday against Stanford 
when he completed his 152nd pass of the season. That moved Marinovich past 
Fertig into 12th place on the all-time Trojan list. Among others, he has 
already surpassed Vince Evans and Jim Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
And Marinovich has played only eight games. 
</P>
<P>
With 3 1/2 seasons left, he seems a good bet, barring injury, to break every 
passing mark at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, that's hardly like breaking rushing records at USC. For a long 
time, the pages in the Trojan playbook devoted to the forward pass came labeled 
with one of those signs found on fire extinguishers: To be used in emergency 
only. 
</P>
<P>
But Marinovich, following the path blazed by his predecessor, Rodney Peete, is 
changing all that. 
</P>
<P>
Quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Only two months ago, he was still No. 2 on the depth chart, behind Pat O'Hara. 
A knee injury suffered by O'Hara in a scrimmage 11 days before the season 
opener changed that. 
</P>
<P>
But Coach Larry Smith, understandably not yet a believer, kept Marinovich 
largely under wraps on opening day against Illinois, limiting him to 27 passes 
and nothing long until the final two desperation throws of a losing effort. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, just five games later, Smith turned Marinovich loose in the home of 
the defending national champion, allowing him to throw 55 times against Notre 
Dame. That number broke the school record by 10. Marinovich also set a school 
record that day for completions with 33. 
</P>
<P>
"The remarkable thing to me is that they told me before the Notre Dame game 
that they were relying on him to win that game," said Pat Haden, a former star 
quarterback for USC and now a broadcaster who worked the Trojan-Irish game. 
"They have incredible confidence in him." 
</P>
<P>
So does Haden. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that if he keeps going the way he has, he will be the quarterback that 
all other quarterbacks at SC are measured by," Haden said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Haden admits that he, too, is surprised at just how fast Marinovich has 
come on. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody had high expectations for him," Haden said. "I knew him as a kid. I 
heard about him for a long time. I had never seen him (play) in person until 
Notre Dame, but I came away impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"He has remarkable composure. There may be 100 guys walking the streets of Los 
Angeles who are tall and can throw the ball as accurately. But what separates 
him is the mental toughness and the composure. I don't think it's something you 
can learn. It's innate. Nothing seems to faze him." 
</P>
<P>
Was Haden anywhere near as confident halfway through his first season? 
</P>
<P>
"I had great confidence," he said. "But then, I wasn't asked to carry the team. 
We had a great defense. I handed off to great backs. And I threw the ball 15 
times. Twenty-two times if I was having a great game. He throws that many by 
halftime." 
</P>
<P>
Sid Gillman has been watching football for nearly 60 years in various 
capacities and he can't remember seeing a quarterback excel so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised by what he has done, really surprised," Gillman said from his 
home in San Diego. "I don't know anyone who has come on the way he has. But 
that's what happens if a guy has got some talent. Especially if he is well 
coached. And there's no question Larry Smith is a hell of a coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen much of (Marinovich), but I've seen enough to know I'm really 
impressed. He has a real good, strong arm. And a hell of a lot of poise. He's 
going to be something with his ability and size." 
</P>
<P>
Gillman figures that Marinovich's 6-foot-4, 210-pound body makes him an ideal 
quarterback for the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
"They are looking for guys who have size now," Gillman said. "A 190-pounder is 
not going to make it. Defensive linemen lay on guys like that and they are out 
for the year. A quarterback has to lift weights, come out of the weight room 
like an offensive lineman." 
</P>
<P>
If Marinovich has a liability, it is his habit of throwing interceptions. He 
threw three crucial ones against Notre Dame and then came back last week and 
threw two that killed drives against Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, he has thrown a dozen touchdown passes and eight interceptions. He is 
just 148 yards short of being the eighth Trojan to throw for 2,000 yards in a 
season. His completion rate, 62.1%, puts him ahead of Bernie Kosar's NCAA 
record for a freshman at Miami -- 61.5% -- and ties the USC record, set by Paul 
McDonald in 1979 and tied by Peete last season. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich's development, fostered by his father, Marv, a star lineman at USC, 
has been much-chronicled. That the work is paying off doesn't surprise Marv. 
</P>
<P>
"You would figure that a dad would have inflated expectations, but I knew Todd 
had those capabilities," Marv said. "To do it at Notre Dame is another thing. I 
had to see that. 
</P>
<P>
"But from week to week, he has gone to the next level because of his focus. He 
is never satisfied. A lot of guys would figure they have arrived and they don't 
have to do anything else." 
</P>
<P>
After a game, it is Marv to whom Todd still turns for advice. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to know what I think," Marv said. "I think I'm pretty tough on him. 
We talk about mechanics and concentration. He'll ask me, 'What did you think 
about this play?' It's kind of fun. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done this since he played youth football. Other kids would give it a 
rest. We carried it on at the dinner table." 
</P>
<P>
Is Todd playing for his dad? 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing that he is doing it for somebody else is just not so," the 
senior Marinovich said. "You can't make someone work as hard as Todd has worked 
for someone else. He is doing it for himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just enjoying watching him play. I would have been pleased with just his 
high school accomplishments. All this is unbelievable for a dad." 
</P>
<P>
Two things in particular impress Haden about Marinovich, his ability to handle 
the rush and his ability to run. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of guys, when they get rushed, take their eyes off what's going on 
downfield," Haden said. "Todd moves his feet, but keeps his eyes downfield and 
avoids the rush. Look at how many passes he completes to the fullback and the 
tight end. Those guys are usually not the primary receivers, so the fact that 
he's completing passes to those guys tells you he's doing a good job reading 
defenses. 
</P>
<P>
"The other thing is, I was shocked how well he ran against Notre Dame. He 
showed very good foot speed. I'll bet you he can do the 40 in 4.8." 
</P>
<P>
So how good can Marinovich be? 
</P>
<P>
"The big thing is, he has to keep some perspective about his life and all this 
exposure," Haden said. "He seems to have a pretty good head about himself, but 
the real challenge is if he can work as hard over the next three years as he 
has over the last 10. If he does, he'll be a candidate for All-American and the 
Heisman Trophy in a couple of years and he'll be the best quarterback USC ever 
had." 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
As promised, Notre Dame has sent a letter from the team apologizing for its 
role in the pregame brawl between the two squads 10 days ago. Coach Larry Smith 
sent a return letter to Notre Dame from the USC players, supporting "the 
philosophy that there is no place for this action in the game of football" and 
looking forward to the continuation of the long rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
THE RIVALRY CONTINUES 
</P>
<P>
BRET JOHNSON 
</P>
<P>
Rebounding from a sub-par performance against Oregon State, the El Toro grad 
seemingly had things well in hand as he led UCLA to a 21-0 first quarter lead. 
But, things went downhill from there with one interception leading to a 
Washington score and another in the end zone blunting a Bruin drive. He 
completed 18 of 27 passes for 217 yards. One of his completions went for a 
touchdown.

A FEW GOOD WOMEN ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE OF A MALE-DOMINATED FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
As the only female officiating high school football games in Orange County this 
year, Minochka Taylor often has run into stiff opposition on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course I got flack, always," said Taylor, 22, who studied sports medicine 
and played flag football at Pepperdine University. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor remembers a coach who wanted her to make a call that she felt wasn't 
warranted. 
</P>
<P>
"The coach started yelling. He started cussing and acting a fool," she said. "I 
think if a man said it was incidental it would have been left at that, but the 
coach, he handled it very unprofessionally." 
</P>
<P>
The coach's lack of respect for authority, a message he passed on to his 
players, soured her on officiating, Taylor said. Enough so that she is mulling 
over whether she will return to officiate a second season. 
</P>
<P>
Her absence would further diminish the already tiny contingent of women 
officiating high school sports in Orange County. Taylor is the only woman among 
the 214 members of the Orange County Football Officials Assn. Of the 165 
officials working high school soccer games in the county, only seven are women. 
And only 12 women belong to the 260-member Orange County Basketball Officials 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers are just a bit better in volleyball. Only 16 of the 39 Orange 
County members of the Southern California Volleyball Officials Assn. are women. 
</P>
<P>
The low number of women officiating girls' basketball puzzles Darlene May, the 
first woman to officiate women's international basketball, which she did at the 
1984 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
May participated in several sports in high school and college, and has become 
the winningest women's Division II basketball coach in the nation at Cal Poly 
Pomona. She says there is a natural pool from which to draw female officials -- 
former players. 
</P>
<P>
"The money is there," May said. "I don't see any reason why women don't get 
involved. I think about all the basketball teams and all the female athletes 
out there, and I think there is a good pool to choose from and it is a logical 
pool to go to." 
</P>
<P>
Sue Lemaire of Walnut, the first woman's international volleyball official, 
says former players are not going to be interested in officiating certain 
sports because of the treatment officials receive from the coaches and 
spectators. 
</P>
<P>
"Women do not stay in things where they get yelled at and degraded," Lemaire 
said. "And isn't that the role of the spectator right now? It's everybody 
against the officials." 
</P>
<P>
More high school girls participate in basketball than in volleyball, yet 
volleyball attracts more officials than basketball because of its decorum, 
Lemaire said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the rules (in volleyball) still address sportsmanship, and teams and 
players are penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct." Lemaire said. "We don't 
have to put up with a lot of the garbage. (Officiating volleyball) doesn't 
involve any additional physical conditioning like basketball, where you are 
running up and down the court." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Thomas Tutko, a sports psychologist at San Jose State, says societal 
messages have discouraged women from participating in sports in the past. And 
those messages are even stronger for officiating. 
</P>
<P>
"Sport, for the most part, is a macho world," Tutko said. "If you have a woman 
in charge, and that is what an official is, in charge, that it is very 
difficult for a male to accept. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . More often than not the desire to officiate grows out of someone having 
an enjoyable athletic experience, and if women are limited with their 
experience, that wouldn't be something that they would want to consider. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have women's football teams, do we? How . . . are you going to be an 
official in football when we have no women's football teams? Let's look at Pop 
Warner and Little League baseball. We have all kinds of leagues for boys, but 
it is limited for women. From the very beginning women are limited." 
</P>
<P>
So limited that they filter themselves out of the officiating pool, Tutko said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the vast majority of women would somehow feel, just on a personal 
level, officiating would not be their territory," he said. "You almost have to 
buck the system to participate, to play. . . . You've really got to love it." 
</P>
<P>
That is why Timarie Sullivan officiates. Sullivan, the athletic director, 
basketball and softball coach at Connelly High School in Anaheim, was a 
three-sport athlete in high school and played community college basketball. She 
started officiating during college to make extra money. 
</P>
<P>
"As it progressed, I really enjoyed the thrill and the competition," Sullivan 
said. "At this point it's really not for the money because I took a couple of 
years off and I am now starting back because I really missed it." 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Ulmer, who played basketball at Cal Poly Pomona and is in her second year 
officiating, says some women are intimidated by officiating. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously it is a male-dominated employment and I think a lot of women are 
intimidated by that," Ulmer said. "But a woman who is confident in herself and 
really knows the game will not be intimidated and men will not try to 
intimidate her." 
</P>
<P>
Those who officiate, women and men, are not the sort who are intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a special type of person who is willing to be an official," 
Tutko said. "I don't think a weak, subservient or dependent person would want 
to be an official, male or female. It takes guts to be an official."

RED FLAG RAISED AS REFEREE RANKS DROP; 
</P>
<P>
OFFICIALS: FINDING ENOUGH QUALIFIED PEOPLE IS EVER-INCREASING PROBLEM AT EVENTS 
THROUGHOUT ORANGE COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Joe Samuel, who lives in semi-retirement in San Juan Capistrano, sits in the 
front row as an instructor lectures in the auditorium of Cerro Villa Junior 
High School in Villa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel is one of about 50 aspiring referees attending the opening meeting of 
the Orange County Basketball Officials Assn. in preparation for the coming 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Ross, athletic director at Santa Ana, passes out materials and welcomes 
the group. The turnout is higher than expected, and that's good news at a time 
when the number of officials in every sport has dwindled over the past five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel, 51, who played basketball in high school and college and recently 
started officiating grade-school games, is beginning the required course that 
will lead to assignments for freshman and sophomore basketball games throughout 
Orange County starting next month. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at the group of rookies and it's encouraging," said Greg Willard, a 
member of the organization for 14 years. "But the telltale sign will be how 
many of those guys are still here in five years." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, there were 30 aspiring referees in the rookie class, but only 14 
returned to work this season. The turnover rate is a major concern among the 
group's longtime members. 
</P>
<P>
Some fear the lack of qualified officials is beginning to have an impact on 
competitions. They remember when two or three officials worked some events, and 
point to the same games and matches now being officiated by one person. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that we just don't have enough referees to do a good job in 
the county's high schools," said Speedy Castillo, Orange County's assigner for 
football. 
</P>
<P>
One of the problems in recruiting officials can be traced to the pressure of 
performing in a hostile environment, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"Officials are authority figures, and there tends to be a measure of resentment 
toward authority figures . . .," said John Keating, a basketball referee and 
physical education teacher at Los Amigos. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, who has officiated for 25 years, has seen a gradual attitude change 
toward officials in the past 10 years, and it bothers him. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids are more smarter, more aware of what's going on, and they question 
everything," Keating said. "Most of the coaches are fair, honest guys. The 
majority of the kids are great to work with. But it's unfortunate that a small 
few are driving some referees out of the business." 
</P>
<P>
The hassles are discouraging, but the hours are sometimes worse. Aspiring 
officials sometimes face a probationary period of three to five years 
officiating on the freshman and sophomore levels before graduating to varsity 
games. 
</P>
<P>
At one time, Ross said, about 80% of the pool of officials were teachers, who 
were able to work in the afternoons, when freshman and junior varsity games are 
often played. 
</P>
<P>
But Ross says teachers no longer make up the majority of officials, and 
scheduling is now a problem. "Those who have other jobs are having problems 
getting off at 3 o'clock to referee a game," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
Money also is an issue. A varsity official in most sports is paid $10-$12 an 
hour. That's a good part-time job for a college student, but most veteran 
referees say they are not officiating for the money. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great college job," Willard said. " It's unfortunate that we don't have 
more young referees. I realize that a lot of young guys get discouraged, but 
officiating is like anything else. You have to really put in the time if you 
want to advance." 
</P>
<P>
Violence is yet another issue. According to Melvin Narol, a legal columnist of 
Referee, the trade magazine for the 10,000-member National Assn. of Sports 
Officials, there are at least 100 publicized cases a year of officials being 
assaulted during youth games. 
</P>
<P>
The confrontations range from pushing and shoving to serious assault. A 
football player at Palmdale High recently assaulted a referee during a game 
against Saugus that resulted in a forfeiture and the player's suspension from 
athletic competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been close to that type of situation in my 25 years of 
officiating," Keating said. "But I have to admit the possibility of an incident 
like that is in the back of my mind more than ever before." 
</P>
<P>
There are issues in particular sports that affect the supply of officials. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the pool of officials for baseball games has diminished to the 
point that Southern Section administrators are calling the numbers a "crisis 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
A typical baseball game is played in about 2 1/2 hours. A girls' softball game 
often ends an hour earlier, yet the difference in pay for the two sports is $5. 
Many qualified people are electing to officiate softball games. 
</P>
<P>
Recruiting officials who specialize in sports such as water polo and volleyball 
also is a problem, partly because many former players who stay involved in the 
game choose to go into coaching. As a result, volleyball coaches have often 
used other players as line judges for a match. The responsibility can 
potentially become too much for a student. 
</P>
<P>
"I notice a lot of coaches are using their varsity players in the games (as 
line judges)," said Charlie Brande, volleyball coach at Corona del Mar. "You 
need someone with maturity." 
</P>
<P>
Making the transition from player or coach is not always so easy as it would 
seem. Steve Donahue, 30, a rookie referee from Washington now living in Seal 
Beach, found he had a lot to learn when he became a football official. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue played football at Washington State and later became an assistant coach 
under John Hangartner at Kennedy. He thought he knew the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I played the game, but I never knew the rules until I took the time, sat down 
and read the rule book," he said. "The biggest misconception coaches have, 
especially on the freshman and sophomore levels, is that they know the game. I 
would say that 75% of them don't know the rules, but that doesn't stop them 
from yelling at a referee when they think they're right." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the problems and pressures, some people are still drawn to officiating. 
</P>
<P>
Willard, 30, is the pride of the Orange County officials' organization. Last 
year, he became the second-youngest official in the National Basketball Assn. 
He remains an active high school football official in the fall. 
</P>

Two weeks ago, Willard worked the Pacifica-Garden Grove game in front of 600 
fans at Bolsa Grande High. That's a far cry from the 17,505 who pack the Forum 
when he officiates a Laker game. But for Willard, the prep game was just 
another day at the office.

"It's still officiating, no matter what level you're working on, no matter what 
the competition might be," he said.

"You're going to have good nights and you're going to have bad nights. You have 
to be patient. Eventually, you'll make your mark."

Anger got John Moore involved in officiating. 
</P>
<P>
It was 1970 and Moore, still a senior at Cal State Los Angeles, was coaching 
junior varsity basketball at Loyola High School. During a game, he got into an 
argument with a referee about a player-control foul. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to know why they were getting to shoot free throws on that call," 
Moore said. "I was getting on him pretty good. He finally turned around and 
said, 'Learn the rules.' " 
</P>
<P>
Moore, convinced that he was right, checked his rule book after the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy was right," Moore said. "He wasn't too diplomatic in the way he 
handled it, but he was right. I was really mad at myself." 
</P>
<P>
So mad, in fact, that Moore began attending officials' meetings to get better 
acquainted with the rules. One thing led to another and Moore became a 
certified official. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years after the incident, Moore put what he learned to practical use. 
After resigning as Laguna Hills' basketball coach in 1985, he began officiating 
games regularly. 
</P>
<P>
But Moore is in the minority. Some coaches remain active in athletics after 
their coaching days, but few opt for officiating. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame," said Terry Munson of Rancho Alamitos, who is still officiating 
water polo 12 years after resigning as the Vaqueros' coach. "There is a 
shortage of officials in all sports, especially young officials. There are a 
lot of ex-coaches around. They should give something back to their sports." 
</P>
<P>
Munson, who was an All-American goalkeeper at Cal State Long Beach in 1972, 
coached water polo at Rancho Alamitos from 1974-77. After resigning, he became 
a certified official. 
</P>
<P>
Even after taking over the Vaquero basketball program in 1986, Munson remained 
active as a water polo official. He resigned as basketball coach last spring to 
spend more time with his family, but has continued to officiate. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't want to leave the sport," Munson said. "And it really doesn't 
take up that much time. The season begins in September and the (high school) 
championship games are around Thanksgiving. That's two months' work and, after 
that, maybe two or three meetings. I have the rest of the time to spend with my 
family." 
</P>
<P>
Munson is in demand as an official and usually works the Southern Section 
championship games. He still knows many of the coaches, and he says that makes 
it easier to officiate games. Which isn't to say there aren't some chaotic 
moments. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Munson was working the 4-A championship game between Newport Harbor 
and Corona del Mar. Because of the game's importance and the rivalry between 
the schools, the stands were packed. "They even had people sitting on the edge 
of the pool," Munson said. "The game went into sudden-death overtime and all of 
a sudden I notice there's one too many people in the pool. I'm trying to figure 
out what team he plays for and then realized someone had been pushed into the 
pool. It took some time to restore order." 
</P>
<P>
Moore was tired of the daily grind after 15 years of coaching at Loyola, 
Cathedral, La Mirada, Pius X and Laguna Hills, but still loved the game. 
</P>
<P>
Moore officiated when he was a junior varsity coach, working mostly sophomore 
and freshmen games, but quit once he became a varsity coach because he felt 
there might be a conflict of interest. But after resigning, Moore became 
involved again because it was a chance to be a part of the sport he loved 
without the headaches that come from coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"Coaching just wasn't fun anymore," Moore said. "Rather than struggle with it 
or fake it, I got out. As a referee, I've been able to stay in the game, but I 
don't go home at night gnashing my teeth because some kid beat me at the buzzer 
with a 25-footer." 
</P>
<P>
As a former coach, Moore said he is more sympathetic toward coaches. He'll 
listen to their complaints -- to a point. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some that should probably learn the rules a little better," he said. 
"But I would never tell them that."

Hawaiian Connection: Honolulu is 3,000 miles to the west but there is still a 
strong business link with Orange County (among other things, local companies 
such as Ocean Pacific and Quiksilver make half the Hawaiian shirts that are 
sold to tourists over there). 
</P>
<P>
And it is getting stronger, as witnessed by these two transportation industry 
items: 
</P>
<P>
* An investment group led by Newport Beach attorney J. Thomas Talbot is moving 
merrily along with its plans to acquire control of HAL Inc., the Honolulu 
holding company for Hawaiian Airlines and the West Maui Airport. Talbot said 
the recent tumult on Wall Street, sparked in part by the collapse of financing 
arrangements for the $6.7-billion United Airlines buyout, won't affect his 
group's more modest $22-million to $43-million bid for between 51% and 100% of 
HAL. 
</P>
<P>
* A Santa Ana firm, Dave Systems Inc., is one of seven companies bidding for 
contracts to operate Honolulu's municipal bus system. The current operator, MTL 
Inc., also is among the applicants, as are three Hawaiian tour companies -- 
Gray Line Hawaii, Rainbow Tours Inc. and Robert's Hawaii Inc. -- and two more 
mainland firms, ATE Management and Service Co. Inc. of Cincinnati and Transit 
Marketing/Laidlaw Transit Inc. of Concord in Northern California. Dave Systems 
operates several municipal bus systems and dial-a-ride programs in California.

SALES OF NEW DETACHED HOMES DROP; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: IN A TWO-TIERED MARKET, CONDOMINIUMS ARE MOVING FASTER IN SOUTH COUNTY 
THAN THEY DID LAST YEAR, WHILE HIGH-PRICED HOMES COMPETE FOR A DWINDLING NUMBER 
OF BUYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Are sales of new homes really slowing down in Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
That depends, according to a new survey released Tuesday, which shows 
condominium sales are actually up this year over last. It is sales of detached 
houses -- most of them very big and very expensive -- that are in the doldrums 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Consider these figures from the Costa Mesa consulting firm Market Profiles: 
More than 3,600 condos and other types of attached housing had been sold 
through the first nine months of 1989 in the southern half of Orange County, 
where most new homes are built. That's up 300 sales, or 9.1%, from last year's 
3,300. 
</P>
<P>
Detached houses, though, are another story. Builders sold only 3,100 new houses 
in the area south of the Costa Mesa Freeway through the first nine months of 
the year, compared to 4,000 last year. That's a 22.5% decline. Almost a third 
of the houses sold this year were priced at more than $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
The market for used houses has also slowed, several other real estate surveys 
have recently indicated. And that means that people who once sold their 
existing homes and used the equity to buy a new house are no longer able to do 
so as easily. Yet land is so scarce and expensive in the county that many 
builders can't turn a profit without charging astronomical prices for the 
houses they build. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, many buyers who might not have considered a condominium a few 
years ago now find it is all they can afford in Orange County, said Kelly 
McDermott of Market Profiles, accounting for the rise in condo sales. 
</P>
<P>
All this has finally begun to affect housing prices. 
</P>
<P>
Market Profiles reported Tuesday that the average price of a new home in the 
county fell for the first time in nearly a year during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
For condominiums it was only a slight drop: The third-quarter price fell only 
0.4% from the second quarter, a drop of $837 to an average of $193,089. For 
houses the drop was a little steeper: 1.7%, or $6,769, to $381,787. 
</P>
<P>
And because of the slower sales, inventories of homes rose during the quarter 
by 350 units, or nearly one-third. That meant there were nearly 1,500 unsold 
units during the third quarter, most of them detached houses. 
</P>
<P>
Market Profiles said this year should be considered more a period of market 
correction than the first sign of a drastic decline. Last year was an 
extraordinarily busy year for home sales, fueled by factors including buyer 
fears that slow-growth initiatives would choke off the supply of new housing. 
</P>
<P>
Yet what's less well known, said McDermott, is that 1987 was actually a 
stronger sales year than 1988 for new homes. Homes just sold at a steadier pace 
in 1987 compared to 1988, when buyers snapped up every house that came on the 
market almost within hours, and it "seemed as if the market was much hotter 
than it was," said McDermott. 
</P>
<P>
The figures: Through the third quarter of 1987, 8,300 units were sold, compared 
to 7,400 in 1988. This year it's 6,700. 
</P>
<P>
"So 1988 suffers in comparison with 1987, and 1989 suffers in comparison with 
both years," said McDermott. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, however, was a much better year for sales of detached houses. But 
the condo sales coming on strong this year are another sign that the market is 
going through a broad change, according to Market Profiles. 
</P>
<P>
What's ahead for the next year or so? 
</P>
<P>
A little stronger sales than this year, said Market Profiles, for several 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The huge price increases of last year -- when the price of a house went up 26% 
between the end of 1987 and the end of 1988 -- should slow. And there will 
still be a lot of young, affluent couples with growing families in the market 
for big houses, McDermott said, who may be tempted to buy because prices won't 
have risen as much. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, builders will probably construct less expensive condos for 
first-time home buyers in response to a perceived demand for that type of 
housing. There are no condos inexpensive enough for the first-time buyer being 
built now, McDermott said. 
</P>
<P>
"Builders are going to have to pay a lot more attention to quality and to the 
type of home the public wants," said McDermott. "Last year you could (price) up 
anything and it would sell. 
</P>
<P>
"Next year," McDermott said, "the sales people are really going to have to sell 
those homes rather than just being available to take orders."

NEW STEARN FIRM TO BUILD IN ALISO VIEJO, CHINO HILLS 
</P>

<P>
Harvey Stearn, former president of Mission Viejo Co.'s California division, 
said Tuesday that his recently formed company will build its first housing 
projects in Aliso Viejo and Chino Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The new company, called Pacific Gateway Homes, is owned by Stearn and Ken 
Field, formerly chairman of Bramalea Ltd., the Canadian developer and home 
builder that has extensive operations in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The firm will build relatively inexpensive attached townhouses in Mission Viejo 
Co.'s Aliso Viejo community and moderately priced houses in Chino Hills, the 
planned community in San Bernardino County, Stearn said. 
</P>
<P>
Stearn resigned from Mission Viejo Co., the giant landowner and developer of 
the city of Mission Viejo, in July to start Pacific Gateway. He had been 
president of Mission Viejo Co.'s California division since 1987. That year, 
Mission Viejo Co. phased out its home-building division and concentrated on 
selling land to other developers. That, according to Stearn, was a big factor 
in his decision to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Stearn said Tuesday that his company will build 275 townhouses in Aliso Viejo 
to sell for between $165,000 and $190,000, which is relatively inexpensive new 
housing for Orange County, one of the highest-priced markets for new homes in 
the nation. The market for more expensive, detached houses, however, has grown 
cold this year, a development that Stearn said he anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
"We also decided to go for the less expensive houses because that end of the 
market is much deeper and there's not as much competition," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
In Chino Hills, the company plans to build 113 single-family homes that will 
sell for $230,000 to $260,000, Stearn said. 
</P>
<P>
Stearn, 51, joined Mission Viejo Co. in 1969, the same year that tobacco giant 
Philip Morris Cos. Inc. bought a majority interest in the company. Stearn 
started as director of public affairs. The company's land supply in Orange 
County is dwindling, and sources said it is looking outside the county now for 
more land to develop. 
</P>
<P>
When Stearn left Mission Viejo Co., he took Vice President Horace Hogan II and 
seven other Mission Viejo Co. employees with him. They would have left the 
company eventually anyway, Stearn said, since the company phased out its 
home-building operations. Hogan is now executive vice president of operations 
for the new company. Stearn is president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
Field, a resident of Toronto, was chairman of Bramalea before selling his 
interest in the publicly traded company in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Gateway Development Corp., the holding company that Stearn founded to 
own the home-building company, may also develop commercial real estate as well, 
Stearn said. 
</P>
<P>
Field, who met Stearn about four years ago when Bramalea was buying land from 
the Mission Viejo Co., is only an investor in Pacific Gateway and will not take 
an active role in management, Stearn said.

<P>
Milton B. Hollander, a Connecticut investor who owns 49% of the stock of 
Newport Electronics Inc., has ousted the precision instrument maker's top 
management and assumed the positions of chairman and chief executive, the 
company announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
At a special shareholder meeting Friday, Hollander ousted the entire board of 
directors of the Newport Beach company and replaced them with his own 
handpicked directors. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the board changes last week, the company made no mention of any 
other management changes. But on Tuesday, the company announced that Hollander 
has replaced Barret B. Weekes as the company's chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Wakeman has been named president and chief operating officer of U.S. 
operations for Newport. Weekes formerly held the title of president. Wakeman is 
vice president at a Stamford, Conn., engineering company owned by Hollander. 
</P>
<P>
James R. Lees, a former Newport vice president in charge of European sales, was 
promoted to the position of executive vice president and chief operating 
officer for European operations.

Arthur B. Crozier, a Boston attorney, was named corporate secretary, replacing 
John Virtue. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Lewis, a spokesman for Hollander, said Weekes and Virtue have left the 
company. Weekes, Virtue and former vice president Norman Gray were bumped from 
the board Friday, along with outside directors Robert H. Davis and George 
Pratt. 
</P>
<P>
"With the change in control, (Hollander) is putting in place his own team," 
Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Hollander launched his bid for control of Newport Electronics in July, nearly 
four months after Newport had agreed to be acquired by Sensor Control, a 
Silicon Valley company. 
</P>
<P>
Hollander, who then owned 13% of Newport's common stock, offered $9.50 a share 
for enough stock to raise his stake in the company to 48% 
</P>
<P>
After Newport's board rebuffed Hollander's offer, he increased the price to $11 
a share, or $4.3 million. Both Weekes and Gray announced that they would sell 
their combined 24.6% stake to Hollander, paving the way for the Connecticut 
investor to complete his bid for control of the firm.

IRVINE, L.A. REAL ESTATE BROKERAGES SETTLE SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Irvine commercial real estate brokerage settled a lawsuit Tuesday with a Los 
Angeles rival that had accused the Irvine firm of improperly raiding brokers 
and listings. 
</P>
<P>
Scher-Voit Commercial Brokerage Co., an upstart Irvine firm, was sued for $1 
million by Daum Commercial Industrial Real Estate in Los Angeles late last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The suit had been closely followed by local brokers, who said the settlement 
was generally favorable to Daum. 
</P>
<P>
Both companies said they had agreed not to disclose details of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute started a year ago, when about two dozen brokers and other 
employees walked out of Daum's Anaheim office one night and showed up for work 
at Scher-Voit's new Anaheim office the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Raiding other brokerages for employees is merely considered bad form in the 
brokerage industry. 
</P>
<P>
But when Daum filed suit in Orange County Superior Court shortly afterward, it 
also accused former employees of taking listings of commercial buildings for 
sale and lease. Since then, more employees have defected. Daum alleged those 
employees had breached their contracts and also accused Scher-Voit of unfair 
business practices. Daum in its suit called it a "conspiracy" to carry out a 
"systematic, wide-ranging overnight raid." 
</P>
<P>
Scher-Voit denied it had aggressively recruited the employees. After the suit 
was filed it stopped marketing the disputed listings, lawyers in the case had 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But the defections hit Daum at a particularly bad time. Daum's parent, 
Southmark Corp. of Dallas, had hit the skids in the ailing Texas real estate 
market. Southmark filed for bankruptcy in July. Johnstown American -- the 
Southmark subsidiary that owned Daum -- filed for bankruptcy even earlier this 
year, shortly after Southmark had divested its interest in Johnstown American. 
</P>
<P>
Because of Southmark's problems, which were readily apparent by 1988, Daum was 
widely rumored last year to be on the block. In fact, the October raid cost 
Daum so much in lost revenue that it effectively killed a plan by employees to 
buy the brokerage, Daum's chairman said last year. 
</P>
<P>
This year Daum dropped "Johnstown American" from its name to distance it from 
the troubled company. 
</P>
<P>
It was the turmoil at Daum last year that convinced the defecting brokers to 
leave, Scher-Voit President Lawrence M. Scher said last year. Those brokers 
feared a loss of business, because clients tend to shun a brokerage they 
perceive to be troubled, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Scher also admitted he was paying some of the new brokers a higher "split," 
or share of commissions, than Daum had paid. Those commissions from leasing 
office and industrial buildings can often run into the hundreds of thousands of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Daum insiders say that despite the damage from the defections and the 
subsequent publicity, the brokerage has held on to many of its clients. 
</P>
<P>
It was natural that the defecting brokers would go to Scher-Voit because many 
of them had already worked for Scher in an Orange County brokerage that he sold 
to Daum in 1984 for $4.4 million. The same year Daum was gobbled up by 
Johnstown American of Atlanta, a property management firm that was in turn 
acquired by Southmark. Daum is one of Los Angeles' oldest brokerages, starting 
as a broker of industrial buildings in 1904. 
</P>
<P>
By 1987, Scher had got back into the brokerage business, starting Scher-Voit 
with Robert D. Voit, the developer of the enormous Warner Center project in 
Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was watched closely by the local industry for clues as to what is 
legally permissible when a broker leaves one brokerage for another. Many of the 
brokerage managers familiar with the case said they disapproved of Scher-Voit's 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, however, the suit was settled quietly and in secret sometime earlier 
this month. The two companies issued a statement Tuesday that said, in part, 
they hoped the settlement would "result in a new era of cooperation between the 
two brokerage houses in all geographic markets in which the companies compete." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Local real estate brokers have followed the suit against Scher-Voit in the hope 
that a court ruling would provide firm guidelines governing the hiring of 
brokers from rival firms. Because the suit was settled out of court, and the 
details of the settlement are secret, the issue of what is and isn't legally 
permissible remains undecided.

Varco International Inc.: The Orange-based oil-drilling equipment company 
recorded net income of $408,000 for the third quarter, a 5% decline from the 
$430,000 posted for the 1988 third quarter. Revenue rose 42%, to $21.8 million 
from $15.3 million. For the first nine months of 1989, net income declined 36%, 
to $1.3 million from $2 million for the comparable 1988 period. Revenue 
increased 34%, to $65.3 million from $48.8 million. The company said the 
revenue increase was attributable primarily to the acquisition of Baker Hughes 
Inc.'s BJ Machinery division at the end of September, 1988. "Our financial 
results reflect a continuing weakness in the level of drilling activity," said 
W.B. Reinhold, chairman of Varco.

COUNTY ASKS FOR FURTHER OPINIONS ON AIRPORT ARTS PLANS; 
</P>
<P>
PUBLIC ART: SUPERVISORS GET A TASK FORCE'S RECOMMENDATIONS ON A PROGRAM FOR THE 
NEW JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT TERMINAL, THEN ASK FOR A STAFF ANALYSIS.

Will the John Wayne Airport soon transport travelers with art and culture as 
well as with aircraft? 
</P>
<P>
That question -- posed via an arts task force's recommendations for everything 
at the new terminal from a permanent art collection to a series of live 
performances -- came closer to being resolved Tuesday when the Orange County 
Board of Supervisors received the recommendations and immediately turned to 
airport officials for input. 
</P>
<P>
The board, without adopting or rejecting the recommendations, instructed the 
airport staff to analyze the recommendations and return them with comments or 
recommendations of their own to the Airport Commission and the board by Dec. 12 
for a final vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very pleased" with the task force's report, said Supervisor Thomas F. 
Riley, whose district includes the airport, but, he added, "we should consider 
the administrative and fiscal impact of the recommendations" before adopting 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"Arts activities are always a measure of a community's vitality," Harvey 
Stearn, chairman of the 12-member John Wayne Airport Arts Task Force, told the 
board. "An arts program at the John Wayne Airport would be a very visible 
measure of vitality in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
The arts program would feature four exhibits a year, performing arts events, 
and the acquisition of two artworks annually, according to task force 
recommendations made after surveys of airport patrons reportedly showed a 
widespread desire for such a program. 
</P>
<P>
At present, the art displayed at the airport consists of a bronze statue of 
John Wayne and several illustrations of the actor. 
</P>
<P>
A permanent director and a five-member arts commission (appointed by 
supervisors) would run the program, and professional curators would be hired 
for each exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
The first exhibit, pegged to the terminal's opening day, would be of work by 
Orange County artists. The terminal is scheduled to open April 1. 
</P>
<P>
Because the program would begin in the middle of a fiscal year, the task force 
recommendations call for an initial partial-year budget of $70,000 that would 
provide for the acquisition of one artwork and money for two exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
The money would come from the airport "enterprise fund" generated by fees 
charged to airlines and other airport users. County officials estimate that the 
fund will total $28.3 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
A full-year budget of $250,000 for future years has been suggested -- but not 
formally recommended -- in a "sample" spending plan. According to that plan, 
the enterprise fund would supply $200,000 and private donations for art 
purchases would account for the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Task force member Courtney Wiercioch, executive assistant to Riley, said the 
board will probably most want advice from airport staff on: 
</P>
<P>
* Whether money from the enterprise fund would be available for the program; 
</P>
<P>
* Whether it should indeed be spent on art, and 
</P>
<P>
* Whether the five-member airport art commission would be properly accountable 
to airport officials and supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Airport Manager Janice Mittermeier has said that the arts program, if 
it is financed by the enterprise fund, could cause a slight increase in airport 
user fees. On Monday, however, Mittermeier said it would be premature to 
speculate on the size of an increase when "we don't even know for sure what the 
budget would be." 
</P>
<P>
As for accountability, she said, "Certainly there will be a review process in 
place so we make sure . . . we are getting value for our dollar." The task 
force recommendations, she noted, stipulate that all activities and 
expenditures proposed by the airport arts commission will be subject to board 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the task force is a responsible group and the Board of Supervisors is 
a responsible group, and no one is going to expend funds that are not 
justified," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the local arts community are paying close attention to the progress of 
the proposals for the airport program. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Desmarais, director of the Laguna Art Museum and chairman of the 
Committee for an Orange County Arts Council, a new ad hoc group working to 
establish a countywide arts service organization, was one of four committee 
members at the meeting Tuesday. Desmarais praised the board for its "commitment 
to the arts." 
</P>
<P>
Other arts officials agreed Tuesday that the airport arts program would not 
preclude or conflict with county support, financial or otherwise, for a new 
arts council. Many in the local arts community have expressed hopes that the 
county would support such a council in some fashion. 
</P>
<P>
The chief purpose of such a council would be "to provide services to arts 
organizations and present a case for the arts" throughout the county, and it 
therefore would "serve an entirely different function" from the airport arts 
program, said Stearn, who is also a member of the California Arts Council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
A final vote to approve or reject recommendations for an arts program at John 
Wayne Airport will be made Dec. 12 by the Orange County Board of Supervisors.

DAY-CARE DILEMMA; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILIES: PENDING U.S. DAY-CARE BILL MAY AID NEEDIEST AMERICANS. BUT ONLY 
LIMITED HELP IS ON THE HORIZON FOR PROFESSIONALS WITH FAMILIES.

<TEXT>
<P>
At 7:30 each weekday morning, Paramount Pictures employees -- actors, 
executives, electricians -- drop their preschool children off at the day-care 
center on the studio lot. 
</P>
<P>
At the downtown office of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., a major accounting firm, 
accountants and other employees have access to free on-site child care between 
9 a.m. and 4 p.m. Saturdays during tax season, roughly from Jan. 21 to April 
15. 
</P>
<P>
At Methodist Hospital in Arcadia, children of nurses and other staff start 
arriving at 7 a.m. daily at the hospital's nursery school where toys, snacks, 
formula -- everything except diapers -- are provided, along with supervised 
care until 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
At the large downtown law firm of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &amp; Walker, 
lawyers and employees with a child-care crisis may -- in emergencies -- use a 
nearby day-care center, where the firm reserves two slots year-round. 
</P>
<P>
Is this the dawn of the age of corporate day care? Not yet. Of the nation's 
44,000 major employers, surveys show, only about 3,000 offer employees any help 
with child care. 
</P>
<P>
But there are signs of change. The American Society for Personnel 
Administration, in a 1988 survey, found that 55% of its member companies were 
thinking about, had or were planning some kind of child care. 
</P>
<P>
The need is hardly debatable -- 65% of all mothers now work outside the home 
and 50% of all new mothers enter or re-enter the work force before their 
child's first birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Congress is considering child-care proposals, all of which would expand the 
federal role in providing assistance, directly or through tax credits. At the 
same time, the private sector is moving slowly, often reluctantly, to help. 
</P>
<P>
But while proposed federal legislation will provide some relief for low-income 
families who need it most, professional women and dual-career professional 
couples will benefit little. 
</P>
<P>
And day-care programs rarely are among the perks offered to lure high-level 
employees such as lawyers, accountants and television and film executives. 
</P>
<P>
While it can be argued that they can afford to find their own help, their long, 
unpredictable hours, together with the scarcity of quality care-providers and 
high turnover, add up to a chronic child-care crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"Money does not buy you out of (child-care) problems," says Ellen Galinsky, 
co-president of the Families and Work Institute, a New York-based nonprofit 
clearinghouse for information and policy research. An institute report last 
month found that half of all workers who need it have a hard time finding child 
care, and, Galinsky says, "often they're making tenuous patchwork arrangements 
that fall apart. 
</P>
<P>
"That affects their marriages, that affects their feelings of competence as 
parents, that affects whether they show up at work and on time. The money 
certainly helps you buy a better quality of child care . . . but it doesn't buy 
you freedom from stress." 
</P>
<P>
If the corporate sector has been slow to respond, workers must share the blame, 
says Judith Auerbach, director of the institute for the Study of Women and Men 
at USC and author of "In the Business of Child Care: Employer Initiatives and 
Working Women." 
</P>
<P>
As she sees it, "One of the biggest obstacles is that employers perceive a lack 
of demand from employees because they don't speak up. That's true on all 
levels. Women are still very hesitant to say 'I have special needs.' And men 
are just not asking for it." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Reisman, executive director of the national Child Care Action Campaign, 
says, "We've got polls to show that men are increasingly saying that they 
experience a conflict between the demands of their families and work demands." 
Still, "it's just now beginning to be an issue that can be discussed at the 
high levels of corporations." 
</P>
<P>
She cites three reasons: The reluctance of men to take time off for family 
matters (they disguise it as sick leave or vacation); the fact that "the number 
of women in higher paid jobs who don't have children is fairly high", and that 
women who have VIP jobs "got there by not bringing these issues into the 
workplace." 
</P>
<P>
Galinsky agrees, noting that in high corporate circles, "family issues are your 
private concern and competent people manage them." And if they can't, others 
are waiting to take their place. 
</P>
<P>
A recent survey of 22,000 women lawyers by the Committee on Women in the Law, 
State Bar of California, found that, of respondents without children, 42% are 
postponing motherhood and 27% do not plan to have children; most cited demands 
of a legal career, with 57% saying they thought that taking maternity leave 
would hurt their chances for promotion; 89% of respondents said employers 
provided no child-care assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Says Fran Kendel, president of the Women Lawyers' Assn. of Los Angeles: "Law 
firms have been slow to recognize this whole idea of parenting and the 
profession. The law for many years was a male bastion." 
</P>
<P>
Today, women are almost half of the entering law school students, she notes, 
adding, "I think this (child care) will become a very strong recruitment tool. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
But Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &amp; Walker -- one of the few, if not the only, 
Los Angeles law firm with any kind of day-care program -- reports that only a 
dozen or so of its 300 employees has used emergency day care in the year it has 
been available. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it would be a lot more," says Clark Carlson, human resources 
director. The firm-subsidized program is for children ages 2-5 and is open to 
all full-time employees; they pay a one-time fee of $12.50 and may use the 
facility twice a month. 
</P>
<P>
For high-income employees, daily day care at or near the workplace may not be 
an idea whose time has come, especially in cities like Los Angeles, where, says 
lawyer Audre Engleman, "You don't want to schlep a kid half an hour in the car 
to a day-care center." 
</P>
<P>
Auerbach agrees, "Most of those women, culturally and professionally, prefer a 
private arrangement. They probably figure that's what their salaries ought to 
be going for. If that's the case, then it's probably never going to come up at 
work." 
</P>
<P>
Nor, she points out, are they apt to benefit even if Congress passes a bill 
that permits a credit for documented child-care expenses. Auerbach notes that 
many child-care providers in Los Angeles are foreigners here illegally or 
students on expired visas; their salaries are paid sub rosa. 
</P>
<P>
Gail Pezzimenti of Child Care Inc. in New York, the nation's largest nonprofit 
child-care resource and referral agency, concurs that the shortage of trained 
child-care workers affects everybody, "no matter how much money you have. In 
New York City, some people are paying as much as $500 a week." 
</P>
<P>
But she sees cause for optimism, in that employers are beginning to see day 
care -- which may be for elders as well as children -- as a money-saving 
benefit, in terms of freeing employees from worry and for retention: "We like 
to think a parent would think twice about leaving a company if the employer had 
provided some sort of child-care support." 
</P>
<P>
"Kiddie-care battles" may soon replace salary wars among America's big law 
firms, says Rita Henley Jensen, a National Law Journal reporter whose recent 
survey found that only seven of the nation's 250 largest law firms listed child 
care among perks such as $75,000 starting salaries, health spas, free parking 
and signing bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
The law profession has company. In Los Angeles, the world's entertainment 
capital, Paramount alone among studios provides on-site day care, although 
other majors are exploring or developing plans, either singly or as part of a 
consortium. 
</P>
<P>
The October issue of "Working Mother" magazine, in its annual listing of the 60 
"Best Companies for Working Mothers," used criteria that included support for 
child care. None of the firms chosen has its home-base in Los Angeles, though 
G. T. Water Products in Moorpark and Ventura-based Lost Arrow Corp. (Patagonia) 
made the list. 
</P>
<P>
When it is in their self-interests, Auerbach says, firms will come around; it 
will happen first in companies with a high ratio of female employees, 
especially young ones. Among these are health care, insurance, banking and real 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
How are things working out with Los Angeles employers who do offer day care? 
</P>
<P>
Methodist Hospital in Arcadia is a pioneer, having opened its nursery and 
preschool in 1958. Says Lee Walling, director for 10 years: "It's amazing how 
many people have said, 'If it weren't for this nursery school, I don't know if 
I could stay.' Nurses tell us right up front, 'I came here because you have 
it.' That's difficult to evaluate in dollars and cents." 
</P>
<P>
The facility, licensed for 128, takes children from six weeks of age until they 
enter kindergarten. Peak demand is for the 57 places reserved for the 
2-and-under group, which includes babies breast-fed during mothers' work 
breaks. 
</P>
<P>
Although the center is for children of all 1,200 employees on a wait-list 
basis, doctors' children are allotted 5% of the places on the theory, Walling 
says, that "doctors can afford to find and pay for child care." 
</P>
<P>
The hospital partially subsidizes the center and all parents pay the same -- 
$2.30 an hour for infants and toddlers, $1.80 an hour for preschoolers, 
including food. 
</P>
<P>
Walling is a past president of the National Assn. for Hospital Affiliated Child 
Care Programs, whose 350 members include eight other hospitals in the Los 
Angeles area with on-site centers. Hospitals have been in the forefront of the 
movement, with 800 U.S. hospitals operating on-site centers. In an era of nurse 
shortages, this is a competitive edge. 
</P>
<P>
But demographics will dictate an acceleration of employer-aided day care, says 
Engleman, who chairs the status of women lawyers committee for the Women 
Lawyers' Assn. of Los Angeles: "I see a dramatic change coming in the next 10 
years" as a dropping birth rate shrinks the high-level labor pool and there's 
"even more of a competition for (top) students." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the best and brightest will be women, and, she says, they will demand a 
better life style for their families. Their husbands also will take a bigger 
role in child-rearing. 
</P>
<P>
Engleman, a partner at Rogers and Wells, says young women coming out of law 
school today usually do not ask interviewers about balancing careers with 
marriage and motherhood. And if they do? "If the person was absolutely smashing 
. . . that would be overlooked. Almost everything would be overlooked," she 
says. But that person's commitment could be suspect, and that is "a death knell 
for your whole career." 
</P>
<P>
Engleman, who graduated from law school in 1971, has never married, explaining, 
"The life style is a total commitment." 
</P>
<P>
Felice N. Schwartz, president of Catalyst, a New York-based group advising 
corporations on women's careers (and author of the theory now called the "Mommy 
Track"), has cited a study showing that 54% of married women working full-time 
consider child care their responsibility, compared to only 2% of the men. With 
a diminishing skilled-labor force, she has said, firms will be compelled to 
reduce family-related stresses on these women. 
</P>
<P>
But is day care economically viable? 
</P>
<P>
At Wilmer, Cutler &amp; Pickering, a large Washington firm, lawyer Jane 
Sherburne, mother of three, initiated a subsidized, seven-day-a-week in-house 
emergency child-care center for all employees three years ago, a first for a 
law firm. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, she says, "we figured that lawyers used our program for about 1,400 
hours and the program pays for itself after about 350 . . . hours. It pays for 
itself several times over, which, frankly, was one of the reasons it was 
received so favorably." 
</P>
<P>
The Families and Work Institute surveyed the Fortune 500 companies last fall 
and found that pharmaceutical firms were most progressive in implementing 
supportive family policies. Also getting good marks: chemical companies, the 
computer industry and banking. 
</P>
<P>
Lagging behind, Galinsky says, were "predominantly male-oriented" industries, 
including forest products and automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
There is growing interest in the consortium idea, in which a number of 
companies cooperate in establishing a care center. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, a not-for-profit company called Child and Family Services has a 
development contract with the Goldwyn Foundation to build a facility in West 
Los Angeles for 75 children of employees of a consortium that includes HBO, 
Creative Artists, Act III and ABC Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
The company developed an on-site center for Union Bank in Monterey Park and is 
developing with Great Western Bank plans for an on-site center in Northridge. 
It has a development contract with Columbia Pictures and Warner Brothers for an 
on-site facility at Burbank Studios for 100 children and is talking with 20th 
Century Fox and MCA-Universal. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount, the pacesetter, opened its 7:30 a.m.-to-7 p.m. on-site center in 
October, 1986. Partially subsidized, it is available to all employees for a 
sliding-scale weekly fee averaging $347 a month for preschoolers and $434 a 
month for infants. There is space for 42 children and a waiting list of 80 to 
90. 
</P>
<P>
"At least a third" of the parent-clients are fathers, says director Ruth 
Mankin. Carpenters' children and actors' children play side by side. "We have 
people making $20,000 a year up to million-dollar producers," says Mankin. 
</P>
<P>
At Lorimar Studios in Culver City, Mary-Catherine Harold, a "Knot's Landing" 
producer, and her actor husband, Kevin McBride, found their own way of dealing 
with the day-care dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
For the first year of daughter Caitlin's life, Harold brought her every day to 
the studio, where the family's nanny met them. The nanny took charge but, 
Harold says, "I had the security of being with her, seeing that she was taken 
care of properly." 
</P>
<P>
Now, at 19 months, Caitlin needs room to run and the nanny cares for her at the 
couple's home in Santa Monica. But 2 1/2 days a week, Caitlin still comes to 
the studio. 
</P>
<P>
Harold is expecting again in January, a girl to be called Molly, and will 
repeat the arrangement, with the blessings of Lorimar, and by hiring a second 
nanny. 
</P>
<P>
"It was wonderful to have the baby here," she says. "She was like a 
tranquilizer to everyone. As soon as you saw that little face, you forgot you 
were behind schedule on the set or a script was late." 
</P>
<P>
Now 38, Harold had been in the business 18 years, considered herself "a career 
woman" and was hesitant about motherhood, afraid she would have to sacrifice 
what she had achieved to raise a family. But, she says, "I had a strong desire 
to have children, so I just made it work." She acknowledges she got the kind of 
help few working women get. 
</P>
<P>
At Arthur Andersen, the company-paid, on-site day care for downtown during tax 
and audit seasons is part of "a commitment by the firm to try to balance a 
healthy work and family environment," says benefits administrator Jeri 
Underwood. Other family-friendly perks include a plan allowing employees to put 
up to $4,800 in a dependent-care account every January and to charge against it 
on a before-tax basis. 
</P>
<P>
Partner Kim Floyd says the firm has explored having an on-site day-care center 
for years but "it appears that our people are so widely dispersed . . . that we 
really don't have a large enough base of personnel who come downtown to one 
location every day to support it." 
</P>
<P>
That is a common dilemma in the sprawling Southland, where parents may live 50 
or more miles from where they work and may prefer to have their child care 
close to home, especially for school-aged youngsters. But finding, and keeping, 
competent help is a continuing nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
Auerbach suggests that employers need financial incentives to encourage them to 
"take on more of the supply role, or the funding role, or both." 
</P>
<P>
Andersen's Floyd agrees and adds, "Both men and women are looking at the type 
of life style they want. . . . We in business are all learning that we need to 
provide more flexibility."

<P>
John F. Kennedy Jr. has failed his first attempt at passing the state bar 
examination, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old son of the slain President failed the test in July when about 
7,000 people took the exam, according to unidentified sources quoted by New 
York Newsday. 
</P>
<P>
About 70% passed, the New York Law Journal said. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, 31, was notified in May that 
she passed the exam in February, on her first try. But cousin Robert F. Kennedy 
Jr. failed the bar exam in 1983 the first time he took it. He passed it later 
and was admitted to the New York bar in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
John Jr. is an assistant district attorney in the office of Manhattan Dist. 
Atty. Robert Morgenthau, earning $30,000 a year. Under office policy, he can 
take the exam twice more before being asked to resign if he fails to pass.

A 17-year-old boy was struck in the arm and chest by bullets during a 
gang-related drive-by shooting at Delano Park in Van Nuys, Los Angeles police 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, whose name police declined to release, was walking with three 
friends on a sidewalk near the corner of Erwin Street and Noble Avenue when the 
shooting occurred about 8 p.m. Tuesday, Detective Ernie Guzman said. The youth 
was in stable condition at Valley Presbyterian Hospital, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A car with at least two people in it slowed as it drove by the four teen-agers. 
Guzman said the driver shouted the name of a gang and a passenger in the back 
seat fired a gun at least twice at the four youths, striking the victim.

A Torrance school bus driver using his hands for sign language to quiet 
rambunctious hearing-impaired student passengers lost control of the bus and 
crashed today, slightly injuring the seven students, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was trying to advise them to sit down in sign language, which required the 
use of both hands," said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Donald Vine. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, whose name was not immediately available, "wasn't really paying 
attention and crashed into three parked cars," said Sheriff's Deputy Rick 
McClung. At least two of the cars were demolished, and the bus caught fire. The 
bus was southbound on Vermont Avenue, about 15 miles south of Los Angeles, when 
the accident occurred shortly before 8 a.m.

FUNDING BAN ON FETAL TISSUE STUDIES EXTENDED

Calling it a "moral issue," a top federal health official said today he intends 
to extend indefinitely the current ban on federal funding for research using 
fetal tissue from induced abortions. 
</P>
<P>
James O. Mason, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and 
Human Services, said he has the authority to make a decision on the ban and 
"the moratorium should be continued indefinitely." Health and Human Services 
Secretary Louis W. Sullivan unexpectedly declined Tuesday to make the decision 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Permitting federal funding for such research, Mason said, "would be 
unacceptable federal policy." 
</P>
<P>
Conservative supporters of the Bush Administration had promised a firestorm of 
protest if the Administration lifted the ban. 
</P>
<P>
Mason's predecessor as assistant secretary for health, Robert Windom, last year 
forbade use of government funds to finance such research and established a 
special advisory committee on whether it should continue. 
</P>
<P>
Later last year, the committee recommended the ban be lifted. 
</P>
<P>
Mason told reporters he will write a letter to the National Institutes of 
Health within 10 days informing it of his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a moral issue," he said. "I'm concerned that in sponsoring fetal 
tissue transplantation there will be a clear perception that the government is 
encouraging or promoting abortion." 
</P>
<P>
Many scientists believe Parkinson's disease and other conditions could be 
treated by transplanting fetal tissue into patients. 
</P>
<P>
Allowing federal funding for fetal tissue transplants from induced abortions 
would create a demand for aborted fetuses, which would increase the number of 
abortions, Mason said.

Next month's summit at sea between President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev will take place on U.S. and Soviet warships in waters off Malta, the 
White House announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The site designation was said by White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater 
to have been made "in accordance with an agreement with Maltese authorities." 
</P>
<P>
Original speculation about the summit site had centered on the waters off 
Italy, since Gorbachev will conclude a visit there on Dec. 1. However, 
Fitzwater issued a midday announcement pinpointing the waters off Malta as the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
Malta is an independent republic in the central Mediterranean consisting of 
five islands, two of them uninhabited. It lies 58 miles south of Sicily, 220 
miles north of Libya and 180 miles east of Tunisia.

The House approved today a spending increase of almost $3.2 billion for the war 
against drugs, $900 million more than sought by President Bush when he launched 
a campaign almost two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Spend we will do -- this is no paltry, penny-pinching response," Rep. Silvio 
O. Conte (R-Mass.) said as the House approved the measure on a voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
The funds, attached to a money bill for transportation programs, represent the 
major congressional input into the war on drugs this year. The overall bill, 
also approved by voice vote, contains a ban on smoking on virtually all 
domestic airline flights. 
</P>
<P>
The bill must be acted upon by the Senate before the measure goes to the 
President.

ABORTION FOE PICKED AS SURGEON GENERAL; 
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON: PRESIDENT BUSH HAS NOMINATED DR. ANTONIA NOVELLO FOR THE POST 
VACATED BY THE OUTSPOKEN C. EVERETT KOOP.

President Bush today announced his selection of Dr. Antonia Novello, an 
abortion opponent who is deputy director of the government's National Institute 
of Child Health, to be surgeon general. She would be the first woman to hold 
the post. 
</P>
<P>
If confirmed by the Senate, she would succeed C. Everett Koop, the outspoken 
pediatric surgeon who became perhaps the best known figure in American medicine 
for his outspoken opposition to smoking and his support for using condoms to 
prevent the spread of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Koop stepped down in September after seven years as the nation's chief public 
health officer. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Puerto Rico, Novello, 45, is a pediatric kidney specialist. 
</P>
<P>
She graduated from the University of Puerto Rico and in 1970 from the 
university's medical school in the top 5% of her class. 
</P>
<P>
Novello joined the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in 
April, 1986. She is its deputy director as well as coordinator for AIDS 
research. 
</P>
<P>
She has headed a national task force investigating the problems of children 
with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-abortion groups had closely monitored the process of filling the surgeon 
general's post. 
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Novello shares Bush's 
anti-abortion views -- opposition to abortions except to protect the life of 
the mother or in cases of rape or incest and opposition to federal funding of 
abortions for poor women except when the mother's life is in danger. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who comes into a policy-making position is asked if they can support 
our policy," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Novello was one of a number of women recommended for the job by President 
Bush's personal physician, Burton J. Lee III, who said he withdrew himself from 
consideration for the job because of his pro-choice views on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Others considered for the nation's top health officer were ruled out or ruled 
themselves out because of different views on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Novello worked for Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) in 1982-83, when he was 
chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. 
</P>
<P>
She is married to a psychiatrist, Dr. Joe Novello, who hosted a talk show on a 
Washington radio station offering advice for troubled adolescents. Her 
brother-in-law is Don Novello, the comedian better known as "Father Guido 
Sarducci."

President Bush today announced a series of trade initiatives, including a 
commitment to help negotiate a new international coffee agreement, to aid 
drug-producing Andean nations in their battle to curb narcotics trafficking.

<P>
"I believe that through increased trade we can make a contribution to the 
creation of economic alternatives to drug trafficking," he said in a written 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said his package of initiatives would promote more trade between the 
United States and its Latin neighbors, explore the possibility of expanding 
textiles trade and build on international political consensus to negotiate a 
new international coffee agreement.

Sales of U.S. Savings Bonds were suspended indefinitely today because of 
failure to enact legislation raising the federal debt limit, the Treasury 
Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Without new legislation to increase the debt limit, the government lacks 
authority to issue any new debt obligations," a Treasury statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Without the legislation, the government's borrowing authority at midnight 
dropped from $2.87 trillion to $2.80 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
The House has voted to raise the debt ceiling to $3.1 trillion for the current 
fiscal year, but Senate legislation has been blocked by a squabble over whether 
to cut the capital gains tax.

R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. has mailed smokers videotapes to get its message on

The nation's second-largest cigarette maker says the 78-second videotape 
commercial about its low-tar Now cigarette is targeted at smokers of Carlton, 
made by American Brands. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds says the videotapes do not violate Congress' intent when it banned 
cigarette commercials. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not forcing anyone to watch it. If someone is not interested, they could 
simply throw it away," said Reynolds spokeswoman Maura Payne.

Payne would not say how many tapes were involved in the August mailing or how 
much the effort cost.

Defending champion Boris Becker has accepted a wild-card berth in the Stockholm 
Open tennis tournament starting next week, the event's organizers said today. 
Becker, the Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion, returned to action in this week's 
Paris Open after a long layoff because of a knee injury suffered in the U.S. 
Open. "Boris needs match training for the Masters and the Davis Cup final. 
That's the main reason why he is coming," tournament director Johan Flink said. 
The Stockholm Open, which will be held in the 16,000-seat Globe Arena after 20 
years in the Royal Tennis Hall, has attracted a strong field headed by Ivan 
Lendl, the world's top-ranked player.

Burt, 30, who has a history of back problems, retired under pressure from the

Mats Wilander was not as fortunate. His slide from the top continued, and he 
was eliminated by Alberto Mancini of Argentina 7-6 (10-8), 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded McEnroe played erratically. He jumped to a 5-1 lead over Svensson 
in the first set, then struggled with his serve before taking it 6-3. He had 
four aces but also five double faults. 
</P>
<P>
"That's been the most disappointing part of my game throughout the year," 
McEnroe said. "Sometimes I get in a groove and then other games I miss quite a 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
Mancini and Wilander played a baseline game on an indoor surface. In the first 
set the only difference after more than 62 minutes of play was in the 
tiebreaker when Mancini took two consecutive points after 8-8. He passed 
Wilander on a service return, then had a serve-and-volley that ended the set in 
the Argentine's favor. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a chance in the tiebreak," Wilander said. "When I started winning I 
began to play a more defensive game. I did expect to play better than I did. 
But when you keep on losing that's not encouraging. But that's the way it 
goes." 
</P>
<P>
Mancini had beaten Wilander twice this season, including a wipeout in the Monte 
Carlo Open semifinal which Mancini won by beating Boris Becker in the final. 
Wilander, who ended up 1988 as the world's No. 1 player, has seen his ranking 
drop to No. 13, after being as low as No. 16. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't been motivated the last few weeks. I really wanted to win today and 
I am disappointed about losing this match," Wilander said. "It's sort of like 
one step forward and two steps back,"

Los Angeles police today were looking for a convicted burglar in the beating 
death of a woman found in her Van Nuys apartment. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Emily Krevi, 34, was found by her brother about 7:30 p.m. Tuesday 
in the apartment in the 6900 block of Sepulveda Boulevard, Detective Jim 
Vojtecky said. The brother checked the apartment after Krevi's neighbors became 
concerned when newspapers piled up at her apartment door over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Vojtecky said that Krevi was apparently beaten to death a few days earlier and 
that there were signs of a struggle in the apartment. He said evidence and 
statements from residents in Krevi's building led investigators to begin 
looking for Donald Max Kuehn, 29, who lived in an apartment building next door. 
</P>
<P>
Vojtecky said investigators will seek a warrant Thursday charging Kuehn with 
murder.
