SHARING BLAME OF 'MORAL MUTANTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to the recent article in the Los Angeles Times about Michael 
Josephson and his Institute for the Advancement of Ethics, Josephson sees a 
very bleak future due to the lack of morals young people have today ("Did We 
Rear a Bunch of Moral Mutants?" Oct. 11). 
</P>
<P>
I am within the age group targeted by Josephson. 
</P>
<P>
I consider myself to have very high morals. 
</P>
<P>
Although I cannot dispute Josephson's statistics, I will argue with where he 
places the blame. To put the blame on parents, teachers and employers isn't 
fair. While it is true that our environment does influence our behavior, the 
ultimate decision to do something morally wrong rests with the individual. 
</P>
<P>
At a very young age, we are taught right from wrong. After our parents have 
taught us the basics, it is up to us as individuals to act accordingly. There 
is only so much parents and teachers can do to help shape individuals so that 
they are acceptable in society. 
</P>
<P>
Credit should be given to persons in this generation with high morals and 
ethics. There are some of us trying to straighten up what previous generations 
have done to the level of ethics.

Gary Abrams' "Moral Mutants" article on Michael Josephson's ethics research was 
shocking and sad. 
</P>
<P>
Young American adults have learned selfishness from their parents, public 
officials and business leaders. It's a sad commentary on the quality of 
American life and the prospects for the future. My hope is that the shocking 
truth of low and declining morals and ethical standards will be a catalyst for 
change, but I'm not optimistic.

Garry Abrams cited statistics that showed today's youth more concerned with 
materialistic things. How is this immoral? In light of the ever-increasing 
struggle for existence and cost of living, it is to be expected. Today's youth 
see the homeless and destitute and decide that they do not want to end up 
there. 
</P>
<P>
It is not wrong to want a standard of living that requires a concern for 
materialism. Some may argue that it is selfish. It is not. One must help 
himself before he is capable of helping others. 
</P>
<P>
Abrams then cited evidence that indicated 18- to 30-year-olds place little 
value in such core moral values as civic duty and honesty. 
</P>
<P>
It was not my generation that fled to Canada to avoid the Vietnam draft. Where 
was their sense of civic duty and moral obligation to this country? 
</P>
<P>
Which generation has created a savings and loan scandal so great it has cost 
taxpayers billions of dollars? 
</P>
<P>
It is not OK to cheat. Why do I have college instructors who will let a student 
do their work over when caught plagiarizing? 
</P>
<P>
The 18- to 30-year-olds are not the moral mutants: It is the entire country. If 
this situation is to be rectified, everyone must contribute.

I doubt whether there is a future for my caring, productive, honest, 
14-year-old son. According to Josephson, he is destined to become a "greedy, 
corrupt, selfish, dishonest" person (not unlike many politicians and attorneys 
who inhabit the planet already). 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me that Josephson has not discovered anything new. In each 
generation there are those who try to get by on the accomplishments of others 
and those who have the ethical fiber to rely on themselves to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
In merely laying the waste at the feet of "parents, teachers and employers," 
Josephson leaves the real issue in the dust. The real problem lies with what is 
learned about American history. If Josephson's 18-30 generation is engaged in 
sexual misconduct and displaying criminal behavior patterns, it is partly due 
to the examples set by people like Gary Hart and Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
Josephson can now disappear behind the walls of his foundation. He has had his 
15 minutes of fame.

Art on the Tube: New York painter Marilyn Minter has taken to the airwaves to 
advertise her artworks with MTV-style commercials seen on late-night shows like 
"Late Night With David Letterman" and "Nightline" and "The Arsenio Hall Show." 
</P>
<P>
The ads, seen in the New York area only, are hawking her "100 Food Porn" 
exhibit at a Manhattan gallery which opened Thursday. The paintings sell for 
$3,500 each. And the cost of producing and airing six television ads is 
$16,500. Minter says the price tag is less than a splashy ad in an art 
magazine. CLAUDIA PUIG

Empress Brooke?: Brooke Shields stirred up the Japanese media recently when she 
dropped in on an old friend, Crown Prince Naruhito. Shields was in the country 
last week to mark the 100th anniversary of the Harry Winston jewelry store and 
the future emperor invited her to stop by the Imperial Palace. 
</P>
<P>
The two first met five years ago at Princeton University while Shields was an 
undergraduate and Naruhito visited the campus on his way back from his alma 
mater Oxford University. The bachelor prince was the object of press attention 
earlier this year when his younger brother, Prince Aya, got married before him 
and Shields' visit stirred up the reporters again. One newspaper resurrected a 
photo of Naruhito's college dorm room with a poster of Shields prominent on the 
wall. CLAUDIA PUIG

Has Hammer finally had it? After nearly half a year at the top of the Billboard 
magazine pop album chart, M.C. Hammer's "Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em" slipped 
to No. 2. The Hammer killer? Rapper Vanilla Ice, whose album "To the Extreme" 
went to the max -- No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
But Hammer's single "Pray" is No. 2 and appears destined to rise one more rung. 
That single may be strong enough to lift Hammer's album back to No. 1. Paul 
Simon's latest, "Rhythm of the Saints," shot up to No. 11 in just two weeks. 
Mariah Carey's "Love Takes Time" is the new No. 1 pop single. 
</P>
<P>
* Led Zeppelin's retrospective, "Led Zeppelin," must be one of the most 
expensive albums ever to reach the Top 40 -- debuting at No. 40. It's selling 
in tape format at $55; around $65 for the CD set.

No Turner for President: Cable television magnate Ted Turner appreciates his 
freedom too much to go into politics. "I think I can make a greater 
contribution in global communications than I could with a political career in 
one country," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be free. Politics, particularly in this country . . . is just one 
big series of compromises." Turner spoke Tuesday to businessmen in Marietta, 
Ohio, and said he fears the federal budget problems could trigger the worst 
depression in the nation' history. "I would sure hope that the leadership of 
this country would stand up and say, 'We are mad as hell. We're just not going 
to take it anymore. We are just not going to let our futures go down the 
drain,' " he said. CLAUDIA PUIG

'LIGHT' LEANS HEAVILY ON SHALLOW SATIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shirley MacLaine plays a sexy grandma in "Waiting for the Light" (selected 
theaters) -- actually, a sexy grand-aunt -- and it's a mark of the movie's 
confused attack that it keeps waving her at the audience like a piquant flag. 
</P>
<P>
Slinking through the movie's make-believe all-American small town, she's the 
snake in the grass: perusing trashy paperbacks and tabloids, decked out in 
hooker's shades, rainbow-colored tart's clothes, and bodices cut so low that 
her bosom threatens to pop out at the camera. 
</P>
<P>
The affect isn't distasteful -- MacLaine is still a cinematic eyeful -- but 
it's definitely exploitative. In her brilliant, touching "Postcards From the 
Edge" turn as the show-biz mom, she wasn't afraid to look dazzling in one 
scene, faded in another. Here, as salty old Aunt Zena -- house eccentric of an 
urban brood that inherits a small-town diner and becomes involved in a phony 
religious miracle -- she is apparently expected to be dazzling and grotesque 
all at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
The movie tries to have it both ways too: tart one moment, gooey the next. It's 
both fairy tale and satire: a rib-nudging fable about a kid's prank, instigated 
by Zena, that convinces the credulous townsfolk that angels are visiting their 
community. The deception snowballs. Dewy-eyed pilgrims descend on Buckley in 
polite hordes, candles are lit in the now-sacred grove, the diner's business 
booms, cynical newsmen snoop, and even world history gets into the act. The 
whole escalating charade occurs during the Cuban missile crisis, which allows a 
dubious "dove of peace" angle to get dragged in. 
</P>
<P>
This idea isn't very original. It suggests movies like "Nothing Sacred" and 
Billy Wilder's newspaper hoax drama "Ace in the Hole" -- and, most of all, it 
suggests the episode in Fellini's "La Dolce Vita" where provincial children 
faked a sighting of the Virgin Mary and turned their village into a kind of 
Carnival of Lourdes. 
</P>
<P>
But Fellini and Wilder were scornful of the frauds they portrayed. Here, 
writer-director Christopher Monger seems to be spoofing small-town American 
religious fervor and, not so subtly, playing up to it. At first, Aunt Zena and 
the kids are portrayed as cutely sadistic pranksters and con artists set loose 
in the provinces, with hapless, nose-crinkling mom Teri Garr as their 
exasperated boss. Gradually Monger all but spray-paints love and good will all 
over his creaky fable. The satire, which tended to limp along anyway -- Monger 
has Frank Capra's intentions, but not his pacing -- is gutted. Its beneficent 
replacement is unconvincing. 
</P>
<P>
Monger, a Welshman, has little sense of what American small towns and 
townspeople are like. His Buckley, Wash., seems to have sprung full-blown from 
a movie never-never land where one-liners sprout up like plastic tulips, dreams 
come true in dollops of sticky sunshine and the citizenry act like moonstruck 
boobs. 
</P>
<P>
But, despite the erratic writing and clunky direction, there are some visual 
and musical coups: MacLaine's amusingly blowzy routines, the credit montage 
over "Jesus Hits Like an Atom Bomb," numerous felicities in Gabriel Beristain's 
("Caravaggio") cinematography and an incongruously fine score by Michael Storey 
("Another Country"). It's all for naught. "Waiting for the Light" (rated PG, 
despite innuendo) ends up as high-concept comedy with a cracked veneer of 
sincerity. Craftily, it tries to spoof the Almighty, while also bringing him in 
as a partner on the job.

'GATE': A ROUNDELAY IN VERSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not often that we run into verse plays written much beyond the 18th 
Century. So a play in verse based on a modern novel in verse that deals with 
the lives of five people and a cat in contemporary San Francisco is a genuine 
oddity. 
</P>
<P>
Vikram Seth's 1986 novel, "The Golden Gate," is even more remarkable an exploit 
for having been composed in strict sonnet form, with its 14-line schematic 
rhyme. This is complex enough without the further problems of condensing it 
into a play. But director-adapter Stephen Sachs has created a piece of high 
melodrama out of "The Golden Gate" at the Fountain Theatre that dances all over 
the original manuscript and, in its sleek final form, remains faithful to it in 
style and content. 
</P>
<P>
This is good and bad news, because form here supersedes content, which has the 
soapy ordinariness of a latter-day "Aspects of Love," David Garnett's 1955 
novel which served as the basis for the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. 
Relationships among friends and lovers break apart and come together like DNA 
molecules engaged in a wistful gavotte. 
</P>
<P>
To read Seth's novel is to roam through a talented curiosity. But giving it 
flesh in a theater weighs it down with opacity, which may explain why 
Charlemagne, the cat, imagined but not seen, is the most vivid of the 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
This is no reflection on the actors, the adaptation or Sachs' fluid direction, 
which goes for a swirling sense of time and place minimally anchored by Ken 
Booth's mostly golden lighting and Sachs' inventive design: assorted blocks on 
a ramp (bridge?) representing the San Francisco skyline or used as furniture 
and set against an incandescent back wall. 
</P>
<P>
Handsome young executive John (Larry Poindexter), in search of love and 
fulfillment, is helped out by his friend Janet (Emily Kuroda), a sculptor who 
nurses a secret love for him and places an ad for him in the personals column. 
</P>
<P>
This introduces John to Liz (Jacqueline Schultz), a willowy attorney, owner of 
the ferocious Charlemagne. Liz and John fall in love; Charlemagne and John 
despise each other on sight. 
</P>
<P>
The rancor breaks up the affair. Liz gravitates toward Phil (Dan Sturdivant), a 
radical friend of John's, abandoned by his wife, whose sexual orientations are 
sufficiently ambidextrous to have also swept up Liz's sexually uncertain 
brother Ed (Tom Sullivan). 
</P>
<P>
This "As the Verse Turns" is crowned by a tragic ending. Much of it works, some 
of it doesn't. The rhymed speech is awkward, despite actors who know how to 
handle it. Poindexter's John exudes yuppie charm and Kuroda has real backbone 
as in-the-wings Janet. 
</P>
<P>
Sturdivant is more problematic. His Phil has an abrasive edge that makes it 
hard to see why he would hold brother and sister in thrall. Sullivan's Ed may 
be weak and confused enough by religious upbringing, but why would Liz, who 
resisted temperament in John, accept it so complacently in Phil? 
</P>
<P>
How much one embraces "The Golden Gate" in the end will depend on one's 
appetite for its peculiarities. The play, like the novel, is an intriguing 
aberration. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5060 Fountain Ave., Hollywood, Thursdays through Sundays, 8 p.m., with 
Sunday matinees at 3. Ends Nov. 25. $15; (213) 663-1525.

BENITEZ: ELOQUENT FLAMENCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Slumped across a table on stage at El Camino College on Wednesday, Maria 
Benitez and four other members of her Spanish Dance Company beat an intense, 
steady rhythm on its surface. 
</P>
<P>
Three guitarists nearby restricted their playing solely to percussive 
accompaniment and soon the snapping fingers, stamping feet and forceful 
chanting of the seated dancers added complexity to the ostinato without 
diminishing its primal force. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the chant led to song (dominated by the soulful Manolo Segura), the 
guitarists turned melodic (and, alas, overamplified), while the dancers moved 
from their chairs to center stage. 
</P>
<P>
Answering the hand-claps of the stocky, feline Angel Atienza and the elegantly 
proportioned but bland Alfonso Simo, Benitez unleashed flurries of eloquent 
flamenco heelwork, her long arms sweeping rapidly through space -- her style 
lighter and without the tension of her extended, superb "Solea" earlier in the 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
While Benitez changed from her red dress to a sleek pants outfit, the suite 
passed to tiny, mercurial Susanna di Palma and the men, evolving from unison 
line dances to flamboyant solos for the women and, later, brief dances for 
nearly everyone -- including Segura and two of the guitarists. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkable for its sense of atmosphere and its unpredictable interaction 
between dancers, this hourlong "Flamencos de la 'Trinia' " (choreographed by 
Mario Maya) set the seal on a performance already praiseworthy for skill and 
intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
Benitez remains a superb soloist -- feral, sensual, virtuosic, commanding. But 
now the company's mixture of classic and offbeat repertory helps make its 
program exceptional as a whole. LEWIS SEGAL

STEWART AT VERTIGO: WHO IS THIS GUY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the "other" half of Eurythmics, Dave Stewart would qualify for one of those 
you-don't-know-me American Express ads. Now he has got his music-business 
version of a gold card: his own solo album and his own band, the Spiritual 
Cowboys, which played at Vertigo on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But even after hearing the record and seeing the show, the question remains: 
Who is this guy? Wednesday we learned about his heroes (mostly John Lennon, 
with some Bowie and Ray Davies and, more on the album than in concert, Leonard 
Cohen). We learned that he is a team player (he gladly shared the spotlight 
with members of the six-piece band). We learned about his odd fashion sense 
(his modified Mephistopheles beard wasn't just for Halloween). We learned about 
his attention to detail and craft (but we already knew that from Eurythmics). 
</P>
<P>
We also learned that despite his personal flashiness and bold track record when 
partnered with Annie Lennox, Stewart has a surprising penchant for restraint. 
Whether rock, ballad, soul or demi-funk, he and band tended to pull up short of 
really letting loose. It's not totally inappropriate; there is a sweetly 
understated passion to Stewart's best songs, notably the wistful "Soul Years" 
and "This Little Town" (the latter evoking Lennon's "Walls and Bridges" and 
Davies' "Waterloo Sunset"). 
</P>
<P>
Much better, and much more revealing, though, were some sound-check warm-up 
numbers heard from outside the club before the doors opened. The band roared 
through Free's "All Right Now," Bowie's "Rebel Rebel," the Stones' "It's All 
Over Now" and Lennon's "Instant Karma" with a fire that was missing from the 
show. Maybe there's just more to learn about Stewart the fan than Stewart the 
artist.STEVE HOCHMAN

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: THE CLEAN, LIGHT FLAVOR OF ITALIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE OCHOA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Italianization of Los Angeles continues unabated. The newest contender: Il 
Mito in Studio City. Like most standard-issue L.A. Italian spots these days, Il 
Mito has an architecturally interesting design, trendy waiters and food with 
clean, light flavors. 
</P>
<P>
One hefty exception: The veal T-bone, cooked with garlic and rosemary, is huge, 
a sizzling 3-D meat replica of the state of Montana. 
</P>
<P>
There are grilled-fish specials, a terrific lentil soup for $3, lots of pastas 
and salads (a "Venetian" Caesar salad is made with radicchio), some meat dishes 
and, for good measure, a chicken dish called Pollo Libertino: free-range 
chicken! 
</P>
<P>
Chef and co-owner Michael Fekr trained with Locanda Veneta's Antonio Tommasi. 
He has also cooked at Chianti Cucina and Sostanza, among other places. Fekr's 
credentials show in the food. But then, it has to be good: Right across the 
street is La Loggia, considered by many to be the best Italian spot in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Il Mito, 11801 Ventura Blvd., Studio City, (818) 762-1818. Dinner for two, 
food only, $18 to $50.

MANDALAY: EVERYTHING'S SUGAR AND SPICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ho Sai Gai, possibly the most decrepit Cantonese restaurant in California, once 
occupied this site. What a change. As Mandalay, the room has developed a lot of 
style: Banner-like drawings of Vietnamese maidens hang from the walls, banana 
trees are spotted around the room, the chair backs are in the shape of the 
letter M, for Mandalay, of course. 
</P>
<P>
It has an air that faintly suggests some low-profile, savagely exclusive 
nightclub. The waitresses in their sophisticated black dresses look like 
cocktail waitresses -- or perhaps like the salty Vietnamese girl in the movie 
"Diva" who was always wrapped up in cellophane like a sharp-tongued lollipop. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, despite the nightclubby air, the mirror-backed bar only serves sweet 
nonalcoholic drinks. And, it turns out, not sophistication but sweetness is 
what the menu is about. 
</P>
<P>
Mandalay calls itself a Vietnamese French restaurant, but the French quality is 
a little elusive, apart from the good coffee and the French pastries that real 
Vietnamese restaurants always have. Actually, Mandalay tends to run out of its 
pastries by dinner time, so I'm taking the pastries on faith. 
</P>
<P>
Artichoke a la Mandalay does seem tropicalized French, with its two sauces, a 
thin lime mayonnaise and a sweet-and-sour garlic lime sauce. Legumes a la 
Mandalay are steamed vegetables -- carrots, broccoli, red cabbage and asparagus 
-- with the same lime mayonnaise for dipping purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, this is basically Southeast Asian. For instance, most things come 
with fish sauce, fried garlic and pureed red pepper, rather hot and better than 
the usual Vietnamese bottled pepper puree. Much of it is very good. 
</P>
<P>
The cha gio, for instance, is Vietnamese egg rolls with a light vegetarian 
filling of cabbage, sprouts and mushrooms. Goi guan, which is pork, shrimp and 
rice noodles wrapped up in a Vietnamese ricepaper tortilla and sliced into 
chop-stickable sections, has a fresher, more elegant flavor than you find at 
many a restaurant in Orange County's Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
But sweetness is all at Mandalay. The appetizer satays, called brochettes on 
the menu, are beef or chicken with an exotic sauce of apricot, plum and toasted 
garlic. The hot-and-sour soup is actually hot, sweet and sour. Among the 
entrees is an abbreviated version of the Vietnamese meal of beef served in 
seven separate courses; here it's down to three satays, one wrapped in grape 
leaves, one marinated in lemon grass, one made with ground beef. They have 
exotic marinades . . . and a sweet chutney flavor somewhere on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Poulet d'ail, which is easy to like, is chicken sauteed in a garlicky and 
sweetish tomato sauce, and curry de poulet has the mellow, mapley flavor of a 
Chinese or Japanese curry sauce which might drive a lover of real Indian 
curries to distraction. Ca chim, made with the fish called pomfret, has a 
similar, rather sweet sauce. Somehow it comes as no surprise that the "garlic, 
onion, lemon grass, soy" sauce on the barbecue pork chops tastes of honey. 
</P>
<P>
It's fitting that the chao tom is so good: pureed shrimp barbecued on skewers 
made out of sugar cane. You can eat shrimp off these sugar cane skewers as if 
it were corn on the cob, or scrape the shrimp paste off in the Vietnamese 
manner and mix it up with fresh herbs to roll up in lettuce as a sort of taco. 
There's a sweet bean sauce on the side for dipping, and of course you can 
always chew the sugar cane too. 
</P>
<P>
If you have a taste for sweet food, this will all be fun. But not everything 
works. In banh hoi tom nuong the sauteed shrimp come on rather soggy rice 
vermicelli, and the catfish filet with coconut milk, mushrooms, vermicelli and 
jicama sometimes has the ammoniac flavor of catfish that's been away from the 
river a little too long. 
</P>
<P>
The desserts include a decent flan (also a coffee-flavored flan) and a dish of 
bananas fried in Vietnamese rice paper like a banana chimichanga. Maybe they 
wouldn't be sweet enough for you after the entrees. But of course, maybe there 
will actually be some of those elusive French pastries left from lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandalay Vietnamese French Restaurant, 611 N. La Brea Ave., Hollywood, (213) 
933-0717. Lunch 11:30 a.m.-3:30 p.m. Monday-Friday, dinner 6-11:30 p.m.

WILL THE REAL LEONARDO PLEASE STAND UP?; 
</P>
<P>
'THE CRAFT OF THE FORGER' AT POMONA COLLEGE IS DRAWN MAINLY FROM THE HOLDINGS 
OF A GULLIBLE COLLECTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Which twin is the phony? 
</P>
<P>
That is one question posed by "Artful Deception: The Craft of the Forger." Just 
opened at Pomona College's Montgomery Art Gallery (to Dec. 2), it's one of 
those unusual exhibitions that attracts specialists and regular folks. 
</P>
<P>
Fakes and forgeries fascinate everybody. They appeal to a basic, childlike urge 
to fool people. Bogus art is particularly compelling because art is hallowed as 
the very shrine of originality and authenticity. A delicious illicit kick comes 
from seeing some skillful dodger make suckers of the pious guardians of the 
temple. According to popular lore, all those critics, connoisseurs, scholars 
and collectors are a bunch of pompous poseurs anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is drawn mainly from the holdings of Baltimore's Walters Art 
Gallery. Opened in 1934, its founding patron was Henry Walters, a collector 
whose mistakes cost him about $100,000. He never tried to sweep this under the 
rug, and once told the New York Times that a museum of fakes should be 
established for the education of the public. This show is a belated echo of 
that wish. 
</P>
<P>
A didactic section begins with a copy of Leonardo Da Vinci's revered "Mona 
Lisa." It was not intended to fool anybody and a good thing, too, as it is 
transparently unconvincing. Rather, it reflects a once-widespread practice 
among wealthy folks, who had copies of great masterpieces decorating the 
mansion to show off their superior taste. 
</P>
<P>
A gallery of works from the Claremont Colleges' collections makes the point 
that not all artistic look-alikes are fraudulently intended. Here are student 
copies done for instruction, harmless impersonations made in homage to a master 
and reproductions so convincing that they are valued as fine examples of the 
printer's art. 
</P>
<P>
But enough of that. We want real fakes, not fake fakes. 
</P>
<P>
Some examples are so bad they couldn't fool you with the lights out. A scene of 
a fallen deer supposedly by Gustave Courbet looks like somebody put it through 
a mangle. A so-called J.M.W. Turner "View of the Grand Canal" looks OK across 
the room but up close turns to melting whipped cream. How could Walters have 
been such a twit? 
</P>
<P>
Well, nobody is easier to fool than somebody blinded by desire. If you want 
something badly enough you will find it. This is a genuine Rolex watch which I 
was lucky enough to buy in an alley for 40 bucks. The guy was very nervous but 
the watch is real. 
</P>
<P>
It's also easy to fool people with an object that appeals to their established 
taste. A "Late Medieval" stained-glass panel is a perfect joke. It makes no 
attempt to hide the modern techniques behind its glaring glass and the subject 
is drawn from a Hans Holbein portrait done in the 16th Century. The thing got 
by because it was made by a Victorian forger for Victorian taste. 
</P>
<P>
Most fakes give themselves away by a combination of mechanical deadness and 
expressive sweetness. They operate like con men. Nobody is really taken in 
unless they want to be. Anybody who is fails to come away with a terrible sense 
of self-betrayal and stupidity. Living a lie is only fun until the sun comes 
up. 
</P>
<P>
There are those rare counterfeiters skillful enough to vamp the experts. A "St. 
George Slaying the Dragon" was once ascribed to an unknown Pietro Carpaccio by 
the renowned Bernard Berenson. It doesn't look so great today but there are 
works that do, like a gold ground Italian painting by master forger Icilio 
Frederico Joni. He was finally unmasked because, like a real artist, he had 
personal characteristics that got into all his fakes, such as long elegant 
noses and a weakness for elaborate halos always produced with the same stamping 
tools. 
</P>
<P>
Other artistically adept forgers made silly mistakes. There is a superb little 
ivory miniature long accepted as a Gothic devotional plaque until a scholar 
smelled a rat. It depicts a lowly saint seated in a position of authority over 
the apostles Peter and Paul. No medieval monk would have committed such heresy. 
</P>
<P>
A French turn-of-the-century imitator known, oddly, as "The Spanish Forger" did 
stunning pastiches of late medieval manuscript pages. Crafty enough to use 
authentic vellum pages with calligraphic text, he was also dumb enough not to 
match the illustration to the story. Eventually somebody noticed. Other common 
forger's gaffes include making mismatched meldings of differing styles like an 
"Italo-Byzantine" monumental Crucifixion where Christ is Byzantine to the waist 
and then goes Romanesque. Looks like a Volkswagen with tail fins. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the circle of forgery involves foolishness on the part of maker and 
seller alike. 
</P>
<P>
The most entertaining and slightly intimidating section of the exhibition is 
"Now YOU Be the Judge." It invites visitors to compare half a dozen sets of 
similar objects, one genuine, one bogus, and decide which is right. 
</P>
<P>
I got five correct and it was relatively easy. Basically, originals have 
vitality and assurance. That knowledge guides the eye to the real halves of 
pairs of Egyptian heads, water colors given to Gavarini and two Gothic 
devotional scenes in ivory. The rest are tougher because they are closer to 
crafts objects, which have a built-in mechanical edge. A pair of supposed 
Chinese "Famille rose" ceramics yields the imitation when you notice that one 
is a trifle grosser and its pictured scenes use Westernized perspective. The 
real half of paired "Renaissance" pendants wins by sheer exquisiteness of 
workmanship. 
</P>
<P>
I missed the call on a pair of Sevres-style ormolu clocks, but a gallery 
representative says everybody does. If I were a forger, I'd stick to the 
decorative arts, where it seems to be possible for a copy to be aesthetically 
superior to the original. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the real lesson of the section is that it's much harder to be fooled if 
an uncertain work is compared to a known original. 
</P>
<P>
"Artful Deception" is a fascinating show on its own hook, but may also 
represent a dark cultural phenomenon. Last summer, the British Museum did a 
similar, much grander show and people flocked to it. Stories of fakes are much 
in the press. We live in a time of blatant doubt of authenticity. Are our 
politicians corrupt? Is our economy sound? Do the media tell us the truth? 
</P>
<P>
The interest sparked by such an exhibition gets beyond itself. It comes to be 
about a society that wants to look deception in the eye so it can see reality 
again.

KEVIN KLINE'S 'HAMLET' PLAGUED BY STUFFINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No one makes Shakespeare boring on purpose, not even the BBC, which has done it 
a lot. Good American actors, less bound up by tradition, have often brought 
fresher, brasher takes to their Shakespeare. The freshness only fails them when 
they begin to take the material or themselves too seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The point is rudely brought home in the Kevin Kline "Hamlet" that airs tonight 
(9 on Channels 15 and 24; 9:30 on Channel 28) on "Great Performances." There is 
irony in the program's name, because Kline's performance as the neurotic prince 
wants to be great. It works at being great. It seems to believe in its 
greatness. But it's not great. Only predictable. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the reasons for the disappointment are easy to identify. First, the 
setting and camera angles. Kline, who with Kirk Browning also directed this 
"Hamlet," which he first staged last May at New York's Public Theatre, keeps 
the action on a visually dull theater stage. His shots are overdesigned in 
self-important ways. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Pakledinaz's mix of costumes (roughly Edwardian to modern) is never more 
than pedestrian. Osric's foppishness, at the capable but powerless hands of Leo 
Burmester, is reduced to an actor waving a derby a bit more extravagantly than 
he normally might. 
</P>
<P>
More perniciously, Kline's Hamlet takes his cue from any one of the celebrated 
British ones, most notably John Gielgud's, and delivers not a single surprise. 
It is clear, well spoken, plodding and blank. The words feel pre-digested, the 
poses struck for effect. 
</P>
<P>
If Kline's performance seems more a cloning than a creation, Josef Sommer's 
Polonius is merely recycled. We've heard the same droning tones before. This 
studied imitation of art infects much of the company, including Michael 
Cumpsty's smug Laertes and Brian Murray's earnest Claudius. 
</P>
<P>
Miraculously, Diane Venora's Ophelia escapes this contagion of stuffiness. She 
delivers a plain but glowing girl, whose descent into madness is as moving as 
it is unvarnished. She almost makes it worth wading through the rest of the 
play to get to her harrowing, uncompromising mad scenes. 
</P>
<P>
But not quite. This blunted "Hamlet" goes through its motions with too few 
genuine emotions. It is facade without foundation. Except for a vigorous 
exchange between Hamlet and a tormented Dana Ivey as Gertrude in the closet 
scene, there's not much chemistry, anguish or passion anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"My words fly up, my thoughts remain below," says the guilty Claudius at 
prayer. "Words without thoughts never to heaven go." Or to anyplace else. A 
warning this production should have heeded. 
</P>
<P>
By coincidence, Bravo is presenting Laurence Olivier's Academy Award-winning 
1948 "Hamlet" tonight at 8 and 12:30 a.m. For those who have access to the 
cable channel, it should make an interesting contrast. 
</P>
<P>
(The PBS "Hamlet" also airs Saturday at 9 p.m. on KOCE Channel 50.)

DEATH PENALTY IS UPHELD FOR CHILD'S KILLER; 
</P>
<P>
RULING: THE STATE SUPREME COURT, IN A 7-0 VOTE, REJECTS A BID BY THEODORE 
FRANCIS FRANK FOR A NEW TRIAL IN THE TORTURE-SLAYING OF A 2-YEAR-OLD VENTURA 
COUNTY GIRL IN 1978.

<P>
The California Supreme Court, ruling in one of the most notorious capital cases 
in state history, on Thursday upheld the death sentence of Theodore Francis 
Frank for the torture-murder of a 2-year-old Ventura County girl in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
A previous death sentence for Frank had been overturned by the high court in 
1985 in a controversial decision that was cited in the successful campaign to 
defeat Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird in the November, 1986, election. 
</P>
<P>
Frank, 55, was convicted and sentenced to die for the slaying of Amy Sue Seitz 
of Camarillo six weeks after he had been released from Atascadero State 
Hospital. Frank had a 20-year history of child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence indicated that the girl had been kidnaped from her baby-sitter's 
residence, bound hand and foot, forced to drink beer, and then raped, tortured 
and mutilated with locking pliers before she was strangled. 
</P>
<P>
The court, in an unanimous opinion by Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, rejected 
Frank's bid for a new trial on grounds that the judge at the penalty retrial 
improperly heard pleas for a death sentence from the victim's grandmother, a 
leader in the campaign against Bird. 
</P>
<P>
The justices also rejected Frank's argument that the jury should not have been 
allowed to see photographs of the victim's battered body. The court said there 
was no reasonable possibility that the photographs affected the jury's verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas quoted one of the prosecutors in the Frank case, former Ventura County 
Dist. Atty. Thomas J. Hutchins, now a Municipal Court judge, who after 
displaying the photographs told the jury during penalty phase deliberations: 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to be angry; you don't have to be emotional; I think all you 
have to do is reflect on the purpose of the death penalty, on its function, on 
its justice." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's decision was welcomed by State Deputy Atty. Gen. Jeffrey J. Koch. 
</P>
<P>
"Theodore Frank is an absolute monster," he said. "This is a case where the 
punishment surely fits the crime." Koch said Frank still may raise 
time-consuming appeals in the federal courts -- and that it could still be a 
long time before Frank goes to the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
State Deputy Public Defender Kent Barkhurst said Frank would seek a rehearing 
before the state high court, and if that fails, appeal to the U.S. Supreme 
Court. Barkhurst expressed hope that the notoriety of the case would not 
influence the courts, but added: 
</P>
<P>
"This was a high-profile case and the tenor of the times sometimes has an 
effect on the courts in general." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County officials involved in the Frank case expressed jubilation 
Thursday at the Supreme Court's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had much interest in watching an execution, but I want to be there 
when Frank is executed," Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
"This man deserved to die for what he did to this little girl," Bradbury said. 
"Can you think of the terror that a little girl goes through in a situation 
like this?" 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury said he had expected the Supreme Court to uphold Frank's death 
penalty, but said the 7-0 decision came as a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Justices Stanley Mosk and Allen E. Broussard have often opposed the death 
penalty in previous cases, and Bradbury said their attitude during oral 
arguments led him to believe that they would do the same for Frank. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury recalled telling the first prosecutor who handled Frank's case 12 
years ago to carry a picture of Amy Sue Seitz's mutilated body with him at all 
times. 
</P>
<P>
The original prosecutor, Irving Prager, said Thursday that the horrors of 
Seitz's death burned him out and drove him to quit the Ventura County district 
attorney's office for a teaching position soon after the trial ended. 
</P>
<P>
"The case did a lot to everybody who had anything to do with it. It was one of 
those crime-of-the-century things," said Prager, now assistant dean of the La 
Verne University School of Law. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're a prosecutor and an adult person gets shot, killed, believe it or 
not, it's something you really get used to," Prager said. "You feel sorry for 
the victim of course, but you don't feel, 'Oh my God, how horrible.' But as 
much as we can become accustomed to that, when we have the murder of a 2 
1/2-year-old girl, it shocks the most hardened person." 
</P>
<P>
Prager said he spent the entire year after Frank's first conviction working 
with the victim's grandmother, Patricia A. Linebaugh, on legislation to toughen 
child molestation laws and lobbying to get it passed. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature eventually used the laws to abolish the Mentally Disturbed Sex 
Offender program that had released Frank from Atascadero State Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Cases such as this justify the death penalty, Prager said. "We all talk a lot 
about whether it's right or wrong to kill Theodore Frank, but we put aside 
what's even more important -- the killing of Amy Sue Seitz," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Remembering who the victim is, how badly the victim was treated, is something 
that's very important, I think. Not so we just simply get angry and say, 'Kill 
the son of a bitch,' but more so we understand what it's all about, and what 
it's all about is the victims who were so horribly killed." 
</P>
<P>
Former Superior Court Judge Byron McMillan, who presided over Frank's initial 
trial in Orange County after a change of venue in 1980, also expressed 
satisfaction on hearing of the high court's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"That's nice," he said. "That old soft-touch theory -- 'We can shrink these 
guys, just give us all your molesters, we'll heal them and turn 'em loose 
again' -- it was proven very, very wrong. It's a real sad thing that Teddy was 
running around. He never should have been." 
</P>
<P>
Frank was initially convicted and sentenced to death in 1980 in Orange County 
after the case was transferred there from Ventura County. Five years later, the 
state Supreme Court upheld Frank's conviction -- over Bird's lone dissent -- 
but voted 4 to 2 to reverse the death sentence. The justices found that police 
had improperly seized a diary that later was cited to jurors in the 
prosecution's demand for a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
The writings, made by Frank when he was hospitalized years before the murder, 
included a passage that said: "I want to give pain to these little children. I 
want to molest them. I want to be sadistic. I want to harm them." 
</P>
<P>
Two years later a penalty retrial was held -- this time without evidence from 
the diary -- and a jury again returned a verdict of death. Linebaugh, the 
victim's grandmother, appeared at the sentencing hearing to urge another 
Superior Court judge, John J. Ryan, to uphold the verdict and impose death, 
rather than the alternative of life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, saying he was basing his ruling solely on the evidence presented to the 
jury, acknowledged that Frank's turn to religion and transformation into a 
model inmate at San Quentin State Prison weighed in his favor. But the judge 
held that the brutal circumstances of the crime still required a sentence of 
death.

CAL LUTHERAN EAGERLY AWAITS VISIT BY BUSH; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: STUDENTS ARE SNAPPING UP TICKETS TO SEE THE PRESIDENT. BUT THE GOP 
RALLY FOR GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE PETE WILSON HAS BARELY CAUSED A STIR.

<P>
President Bush's political support may be faltering elsewhere, but at 
California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks, students are more than anxious 
to read his lips. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers with the university's Republican Student Speakers Bureau handed out 
tickets Thursday that will allow fellow students to see Bush and Republican 
gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson at a 9 a.m. rally Saturday at the campus 
gym. Some students snapped up three or four. 
</P>
<P>
"People are just astounded by Cal Lutheran being picked in the first place," 
said senior Anne Louise Koefoed as she handed out tickets. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the appearance was planned as a rally for Wilson failed to 
impress some students. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Jennifer Martinez said the rally was assigned by a political science 
professor as homework. She had no plans to take notes on Wilson's speech. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm coming for George Bush, basically," Martinez said. "I'm from out of state, 
so I don't know about the candidates for governor." 
</P>
<P>
Others took four or five tickets to hand out to friends who might be visiting. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people are interested in just seeing Bush," said Alexandra Kateraas, a 
sophomore from Norway. "They're not interested in seeing Wilson." 
</P>
<P>
Outside the university, in restaurants and businesses, people are abuzz with 
talk of Bush's visit, said Steve Rubenstein, president of the Conejo Valley 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
City residents have not been as excited since former President Ronald Reagan 
used to pick up steaks at a meat market on Thousand Oaks Boulevard on his way 
to Santa Barbara, Rubenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fervor, the presence of an advance team from the White House and 
the Secret Service has disrupted life for some Cal Lutheran students used to 
the quiet of the pastoral campus. 
</P>
<P>
Physical education classes at the gym were canceled Thursday and the gym itself 
was off-limits to all but workers preparing the facility for the visit from 
Bush and other GOP politicians. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Bush and Wilson, Gov. George Deukmejian is scheduled to attend 
the rally, said Dennis Gillette, university vice president for institutional 
advancement. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 people will be permitted inside the gym, but more than 2,000 are 
expected to flood the campus, Gillette said. A football field across the street 
from the university gym is being readied for an overflow crowd, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even campus volunteerism is up. About 100 students -- some not even Republicans 
-- volunteered to make signs, pass out tickets and escort and drive 
presidential staff, said Eric Peterson, president of the Republican Student 
Speakers Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
With interest high among both students and the public, "I suggested 7 a.m. for 
them to start showing up," he said. "We'd run short on tickets before we run 
out of students who want to see the President." 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are available from local Republican Party officials. 
</P>
<P>
One avid Republican student, who asked not to be identified, said she was 
worried that too many people would crowd her out. She plans to drag a sleeping 
bag to a nearby field during the night to wait for the President. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to camp out on the field beforehand," she said. "The worst they can 
do is send me back to my dorm room." 
</P>
<P>
Another student, who also asked not to be identified, threatened to play a 
prank and change a sign at Buth Memorial Park -- named after history professor 
Wilfred Buth -- to Bush Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine? That would really surprise the President," he said.

CONSUL PROTESTS INS RAIDS OUTSIDE OFFICE; 
</P>
<P>
OXNARD: THE DEPARTMENT SAYS IT HAS HONORED AN AGREEMENT WITH MEXICAN OFFICIALS 
TO KEEP AGENTS OUT OF SIGHT, BUT A NEARBY TRANSPORTATION CENTER IS A PROBLEM. 
</P>

Mexican officials said Thursday they plan to lodge a formal protest through 
their embassy in Washington if the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service 
continues to arrest Mexican citizens outside their consulate at Oxnard's main 
bus station. 
</P>
<P>
INS officials responded that the consulate's location next to a freight train 
yard at the Oxnard Transportation Center, 201 E. 4th St., makes it difficult 
for immigration agents to carry out their duties out of sight of consular 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
Zoila Arroyo de Rodriguez, Mexico's consul in Oxnard, complained that after 
staying away 10 months, the INS conducted two sweeps this week in parking lots 
outside the transportation center. 
</P>
<P>
She maintained that the sweeps violated the spirit of a verbal agreement with 
the INS in January. But INS officials said they have kept their word and 
refrained from arresting people at the main entrance to the transportation 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Since the agreement Jan. 10, Rodriguez said, agents had stayed out of sight 
until 10 a.m. Sunday. At that time, she said, she looked out the window of her 
office and saw an INS truck parked in the transportation building's parking lot 
and saw immigration agents chasing people along the nearby railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
INS agents returned at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether at the door or just outside, that's a small detail," she said. "How am 
I supposed to conduct my business if the people who come to visit me are being 
hauled away?" 
</P>
<P>
But INS officials said they never told Rodriguez that they would stop checking 
the bus station and the freight yard. Such checks are an integral part of their 
duties nationwide, an INS spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Illegal aliens tend to use buses and freight trains to move around. . . .," 
Alan Dwelley, assistant chief patrol agent, said in a telephone interview from 
San Francisco. Dwelley's Livermore patrol section includes Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"We've bent over backward to accommodate the Mexican consulate and honor our 
agreement, but we can't totally shut down our operations in the bus station and 
the freight yard," Dwelley said. 
</P>
<P>
The INS might not have conducted sweeps near the transportation center since 
January, but it has not forfeited its right to do so, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez acknowledged that the INS has a right to interrogate suspects near 
the bus station -- if it can distinguish them from people visiting the consular 
offices and if the questioning does not interfere with consular business. 
</P>
<P>
At peak times, the line into the second-floor consular offices winds down a 
flight of stairs and out the front door of the transportation center. 
</P>
<P>
"While the INS has every right to arrest persons, we don't think it is correct 
to conduct these arrests in the proximity of our consulate," said Jose Angel 
Pescador, general consul of Mexico in Los Angeles. Pescador oversees the Oxnard 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
"If the situation repeats itself," Pescador said, "we will lodge a formal 
protest before the U.S. government through our embassy in Washington, D.C." 
</P>
<P>
But to show its good intentions, Pescador said, the Mexican government will 
begin searching for new offices away from the transportation building. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials are not the only ones complaining about the INS raids. Ticket 
agents at the bus station have also protested. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Border Patrol drives by, everybody scatters and it's hurting 
business," said Jack E. McCory, the center's Greyhound Lines agent. "They 
started coming when the Mexican consulate moved in here three years ago. They 
make random sweeps for no reason in particular, and my customers are being 
harassed." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, McCory said, he witnessed an INS sweep in which four 
suspects were arrested. "They just pulled up in the driveway . . . and had a 
field day," he said of the agents. 
</P>
<P>
Rosa Gascoigne, Aztec Travel Service representative, said the raids at the bus 
station have hurt business and discriminate against Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
"They are supposed to be the Border Patrol, and this is not the border," she 
said. "If they had received a complaint or had some other reason to be here, 
that would be an entirely different situation." 
</P>
<P>
But Dwelley denied that the INS targets people because of their physical 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
The INS selects suspects for interrogation "based on the way they react to the 
presence of the officer," he said. "Some people start acting very nervous. 
That's usually an indication that they may be illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel we have been very lenient in agreeing to stay away from the consulate 
itself," Dwelley said. "I'm not sure what else we can do beyond that."

ELECTIONS OXNARD HARBOR DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
3 CHALLENGERS SEEK TO OUST INCUMBENTS FROM COMMISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER PUMMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In reading over the last year's minutes of the Oxnard Harbor District 
Commission, candidate Faith Cosby said she discovered evidence of an unusual 
single-mindedness among its members. 
</P>
<P>
On every vote recorded in the last 12 months, there was absolute unanimity 
among the five commissioners who govern the Port of Hueneme and have been 
weighing a $90-million port modernization project, Cosby said. 
</P>
<P>
Cosby, 51, an Oxnard real estate broker, charged that the commission is a 
"rubber-stamp" for the port's executive director, Anthony Taormina. "There's 
been not one dissenting vote on anything in the last year," Cosby said. 
</P>
<P>
In seeking to unseat three incumbents Tuesday, Cosby and fellow challengers 
Raymond E. Fosse and William E. Bradley are raising voices of dissent. 
</P>
<P>
But since the district's formation in 1937, voters have never rejected an 
incumbent harbor commissioner, according to Ventura County records. 
Commissioner Stanley J. Daily, who is seeking reelection, said the incumbents' 
success shows that voters have been satisfied with the commission's performance 
since its inception. 
</P>
<P>
"The record of the harbor district and the running of the harbor district has 
been exemplary and the incumbents, based on that, have not only won but won 
handily," said Daily, a 13-year commissioner and former Camarillo mayor who is 
also running for the Camarillo City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Fosse, a 52-year-old ship's pilot at the U.S. Naval Station at Port Hueneme, 
said incumbents are returned to office because the harbor district elections 
generate little attention. Nearly half the county's registered voters are 
entitled to cast ballots in the contest, but few are interested in the port, 
even though it pours an estimated $200 million into the county's economy each 
year, said Fosse, who has lined up endorsements from several labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
Daily and Commissioners Edward J. Millan and Steve W. Stocks -- the other 
incumbents seeking to retain their seats -- said the major campaign issue is 
whether the district's boundaries should be shrunk, as advocated by the Local 
Agency Formation Commission of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The district now includes Camarillo, parts of Thousand Oaks and unincorporated 
areas of Ventura County, as well as Port Hueneme and Oxnard. LAFCO, which voted 
to condense the boundaries to Oxnard and Port Hueneme, was sued by the 
district, Daily and Millan, who as Camarillo residents claimed that their right 
to serve as commissioners had been violated. 
</P>
<P>
Millan, 59, the port's general manager for 16 years before retiring and winning 
election to the commission in 1986, said residents in the disenfranchised area 
should be allowed to vote on breaking from the district. His position is shared 
by Stocks, 65, of Oxnard. Stocks, a trustee of the Oxnard Union High School 
District and former principal and assistant superintendent in that district, 
was appointed to a vacant commission seat earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
As for unanimity, Daily said commissioners were united in all votes in the last 
year not because they are lackeys of the port administration, as his opponents 
claim, but because their two-member committees resolved potential conflicts in 
meetings with port staff before the commissioners voted in public sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"Many problems are ironed out before things are brought to the board with a 
recommendation," said Daily, whose dual candidacy was questioned as a conflict 
of interest and later sanctioned in an informal legal opinion from a county 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The challengers insist that the issue is the commission itself and the "old-boy 
network" that has resulted in three former administrators and schoolteachers 
from the Oxnard high school district serving on the board, including Daily and 
Stocks, who were appointed on the recommendations of present or past 
commissioners with whom they worked in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
"When they come into the public meetings, they have pretty much made up their 
minds," said Bradley, 65, a retired insurance executive from Oxnard.

BORDER PATROL AGENT KILLS KNIFE-WIELDING MAN

A U.S. Border Patrol agent shot and killed an unidentified Latino man early 
Thursday after the victim threatened the agent with a knife near the 
U.S.-Mexico border, San Diego police said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at 9:45 a.m., police said, about a half-mile north of the 
border, near the intersection of Dairy Mart Road and Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
The county medical examiner's office said the dead man was Latino and about 20 
years old. The area is heavily traveled by illegal migrants headed north. It 
was not known, however, if the dead man was a migrant. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third shooting in 1990 by Border Patrol officers in San Diego, 
authorities said. The previous two shootings resulted in the death of one man 
and the wounding of two other persons. 
</P>
<P>
During 1990, San Diego police officers have shot 23 suspects, killing nine and 
wounding 14, according to police statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's incident involved two Border Patrol agents who were patrolling an 
area known as the Old River Channel, according to San Diego police Lt. Dan 
Berglund, who released details of the shooting during a news conference at 
police headquarters. Police refused to provide the names of the Border Patrol 
agents involved in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
A man wearing dark blue work pants, a light blue work shirt and a gray sweater 
apparently saw the agents and began running from them, Berglund said. The 
agents followed the man into the brush. 
</P>
<P>
One of the agents saw the man fall, Berglund said. When the agent approached, 
Berglund said, the man jumped up, brandishing a 5-inch knife. The agent stepped 
back and fired one shot which hit the man in the head. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police are investigating the shooting because it occurred within the 
city limits. Berglund said the FBI is also investigating because the shooting 
involved an assault on a federal officer. 
</P>
<P>
Border Patrol authorities had no comment Thursday on the shooting. A decision 
will likely be made Friday as to whether the agent will remain on his normal 
duty or will be reassigned to other tasks, patrol spokesman Ted Swofford said.

EX-EMPLOYEE FILES SEX HARASSMENT SUIT

<P>
A former secretary for the Oxnard Water Department has filed a $100,000 civil 
rights lawsuit against her supervisor and the city, alleging that he sexually 
harassed her on the job between January, 1988, and May, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Jo Ann Gauthier filed the suit Wednesday against James Blackford and the city 
of Oxnard in Ventura County Superior Court, alleging that he touched her 
sexually and made sexual comments to her while the two worked together. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that Blackford on several occasions walked behind Gauthier's 
chair and rubbed his crotch against her while using the telephone. It also 
alleges that Blackford once whispered to Gauthier that he wanted to tear off 
her skirt and that he asked her to come home with him and "compare notes" while 
his wife was away. 
</P>
<P>
The suit accuses Blackford of violating federal sexual harassment laws and 
alleges that Gauthier was forced to quit her job to avoid his advances. 
</P>
<P>
Blackford denied the allegations Thursday, saying Gauthier "was never harassed. 
I thought she was treated as any other employee. I tried to make it as nice 
working conditions as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Court records show that the city of Oxnard and the California Department of 
Housing and Fair Employment investigated Gauthier's charges, but dismissed them 
for lack of evidence. MACK REED

DUFFY TO HAVE SECRET FUND AUDITED; 
</P>
<P>
SHERIFF: DISTRICT ATTORNEY SAYS COURT MAY HAVE TO RESOLVE WHO SHOULD CONTROL 
MONEY SEIZED IN DRUG RAIDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
San Diego County Sheriff John Duffy, under scrutiny for establishing a secret 
bank account to deposit drug funds, said Thursday that he is ordering an audit 
of the account, which he will make public. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy, prohibited by the Board of Supervisors since June from spending money 
seized in drug raids, refused to deposit more than $300,000 worth of drug funds 
into the county treasury. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Duffy set up his own account, from which he made various payments, 
such as sharing drug proceeds with the district attorney's office and cities 
that participated in drug busts. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office is reviewing the matter but has not yet decided 
whether to begin a formal investigation, according to spokesman Steve Casey. 
</P>
<P>
Casey said Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller believes the matter may well be settled in 
the courts because the law is not clear as to who should control the drug 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether an investigation is warranted or not, it is the district attorney's 
opinion that this matter won't be settled until it gets into court, either 
having the board sue the sheriff or the sheriff sue the board," Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
County auditors Wednesday asked the district attorney's office to investigate 
Duffy's actions. Because the district attorney received some of the drug money, 
auditors suggested that perhaps the state attorney general should get involved. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the attorney general said he had not heard of the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Glenn Revell, Duffy's spokesman, said the sheriff determined "several 
weeks ago" that his secret account needed an audit. Revell said Duffy asked the 
U.S. Department of Justice to perform the audit, but the federal agency 
suggested to Duffy that he hire an independent, outside auditor and pay the 
auditor with drug proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
Revell said Duffy set up the account after asking asking Associate Deputy Atty. 
Gen. Barry Stern if such an account was consistent with federal guidelines 
governing drug monies. Stern assured him that it was, Revell said.

OFFICERS JOIN BENEFIT BIKE TREK TO MEXICO

<P>
Nine Simi Valley police officers have volunteered to participate in the first 
"Ride for Life" relay bike-a-thon this weekend, which includes a 420-mile trek 
to Mexico and back. 
</P>
<P>
All proceeds go to the Life-Savers Foundation of America, a nationwide computer 
service that helps match potential bone-marrow donors with people suffering 
from leukemia and other blood diseases, organizer Richard A. McCoy said. 
</P>
<P>
The Life-Savers Foundation is based in Covina. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy, a Simi Valley businessman, said he got the idea for the bike-a-thon 
after reading a newspaper article about the plight of 12-year-old Camarillo 
resident Amanda Chandler, who has leukemia. Amanda's family has been unable to 
find a suitable donor for a bone-marrow transplant. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy said he was moved by the story and wanted to help Amanda and others like 
her. "It's a way of giving back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The two-day bicycle ride, which is being sponsored by the Simi Valley Police 
Officers Assn., will begin at 5 a.m. Saturday at Sycamore Plaza shopping 
center. 
</P>
<P>
The Life-Savers Foundation will set up a booth at the shopping center from noon 
until 3 p.m. to take blood samples of potential bone-marrow donors. McCoy said 
each blood test costs the foundation $75 and the purpose of the bike-a-thon is 
to raise money to pay for these and other tests. 
</P>
<P>
The police officers association is taking pledges for each mile an officer 
peddles. The officers will take turns riding, but each of the nine is expected 
to peddle about 46 miles. They hope to return to Simi Valley by noon Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The officers are Joe Brimberry, Bill Daniels, Gary Howell, Joe Loneiro, Bill 
Lappin, Stephanie Shannon, John Sameron, Rick Reinhart and Butch Hale. CARLOS

DEPUTIES ARREST 7 ON DRUG CHARGES

<P>
Narcotics detectives seized $43,000 worth of marijuana and arrested two 
suspected drug dealers at a Thousand Oaks house Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Undercover officers then arranged for customers calling the house to meet them 
there, sold them marijuana and arrested five of them, Ventura County Sheriff's 
Sgt. Gary Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to be a little innovative," Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Blackburn, 26, was being held in Ventura County Jail on suspicion of 
possession of marijuana for sale, suspicion of possession of dangerous drugs 
and suspicion of possession of stolen property. Bail was set at $10,000, a jail 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Turley, 18, was arrested on suspicion of possession of marijuana for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation started a week ago when a source told sheriff's deputies that 
Blackburn was a drug dealer, Pentis said. Deputies drove by Blackburn's house 
in the 1700 block of Aleppo Court and saw four marijuana plants growing on the 
front porch behind a fence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
They obtained a search warrant and served it at 9 p.m. Wednesday, discovering 
about five pounds of marijuana, 10 hits of LSD, 18 tablets of the prescription 
painkiller Demerol, $2,000 in cash and a stolen pistol, Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
The house also contained 257 tablets of Dilaudid, a prescription drug that acts 
like heroin. Deputies believe that Blackburn was dealing Dilaudid, which sells 
on the street for about $20 a tablet, Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
After Blackburn and Turley were arrested, deputies started searching the house. 
The phone began ringing, and undercover detectives answered about 15 calls from 
people wanting to buy marijuana, Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
The detectives told the buyers to come to the house. When the callers arrived, 
an undercover detective posed as a drug dealer, received the cash and gave the 
buyers the drug. A team of detectives then arrested the buyers on suspicion of 
possession of marijuana as they left the property. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested were Lawrence Stulpin, 23, Bryon Murray, 19, Darren McNeil, 19, and 
Steven Koenig, 20, all of Thousand Oaks, and James Diehl, 20, of Newbury Park. 
All were released on their own recognizance except for Koenig, who was wanted 
on an outstanding warrant, Pentis said. He was being held in the Ventura County 
Jail on $10,000 bail, a jail spokesman said. CAROL WATSON

<P>
Friends of a man whose feet were severed in a train accident in Simi Valley are 
establishing a $10,000 medical fund to buy artificial limbs. 
</P>
<P>
Don Swanson, a friend of accident victim Steven Frye Jr., said the 
23-year-old's medical insurance does not cover the cost of special limbs that 
would allow Frye to continue athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Frye has been recovering from injuries he suffered Sept. 4 when he was struck 
by a Southern Pacific Railroad train while bicycling in the Santa Susana tunnel 
near Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Before the accident, Frye worked in the accounting department of Farmers 
Insurance and is planning to return after his recovery, Susie Frye, his 
stepmother, said. 
</P>
<P>
Frye has already undergone extensive surgery and faces more, Swanson said. 
Organizers have raised about $4,500 for the purchase of two flexible artificial 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
Friends will hold a benefit golf tournament Nov. 19 at Sunset Hills Country 
Club in Thousand Oaks. Organizers are asking for $300 donations to participate 
in the tournament and luncheon. Donors who do not intend to golf can donate 
$225, with all the money going to the family. PSYCHE PASCUAL

SMIDGEN OF RAIN DAMPENS ROADS, CAUSES ACCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY RATHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bit of rain -- only 0.01 of an inch in most areas -- played havoc on the 
highways Thursday morning, causing many fender-bender accidents and two deaths, 
the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
Among the more serious incidents were a fatal accident on Miramar Road near 
Clayton Drive involving an overturned tanker and another involving a pedestrian 
on southbound Interstate 5 near Palomar Airport Road. Most, though, were 
chain-reaction type accidents, including four crashes in the Washington Street 
area of California 163 and several bang-ups on southbound I-5 near downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the rain fell between 4 and 8 a.m. Thursday, with Cuyamaca receiving 
.79 of an inch. Many areas received only 0.01 of an inch, while 0.02 of an inch 
was measured at Lindbergh Field and 0.05 of an inch in Julian and Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
It appears that is all the rain San Diego will get for a while, National 
Weather Service forecaster Wilbur Shigehara said. A building high-pressure 
system will keep the skies clear and daytime temperatures mild, with brisk 
nights through election day, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
"Nights are going to turn cold, so people should bundle up at night," Shigehara 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lows inland are expected to fall to the 30s or 40s overnight, so those in the 
El Cajon, Escondido and Rancho Bernardo areas should not be surprised to find a 
touch of frost Saturday or Sunday morning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The high-pressure system, which is blanketing the West, is bringing with it 
high winds and high tides. Winds from the Northwest may gust up to 25 m.p.h., 
and up to 35 m.p.h. in the mountains, but will weaken throughout the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Large high tides may cause some minor overflow but no structural damage, 
Shigehara said. High tide will be 7.5 feet at 8:37 a.m. Saturday and 9:16 a.m. 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"People need to realize that it may be a little dangerous out there, so be 
cautious," he said. "The waves can really fool you, so don't take chances." 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures at the beaches this weekend are expected to be 64 to 68 degrees 
through Saturday, up to 68 to 73 on Sunday. The coastal strip daytime highs 
will range from 65 to 70 today, Shigehara said, increasing a few degrees this 
weekend while dropping nightly to 45 to 55. Highs inland are expected to hover 
in the 70s through Sunday, falling to 35 to 45 nightly. 
</P>
<P>
The forecast calls for mountain areas to be 45 to 50 today, possibly increasing 
to the low 60s by Sunday. Nighttime temperatures could bottom out at 24 to 34 
degrees. The deserts will have highs of 78 to 83 degrees and up to 88 by 
Sunday. Temperatures will fall to 45 to 55 by nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
The surf is 5 to 6 feet at 10-second intervals, and the water temperature is 66 
degrees.

ESCONDIDO AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAMMER OUT AGREEMENT ON FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city and school districts of Escondido, overcoming the last hurdles in a 
bitter battle over redevelopment funds, will vote on a proposed agreement 
within two weeks, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We have met to clarify the last two major issues, and the agreement will be 
sent to our respective boards in final draft within two weeks," said Jim Lund 
of the Escondido Union school board after a meeting attended by two members 
from each of the two school boards and the city councils. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, whose precise wording has yet to be hammered out by attorneys, 
ends a four-year battle, including a lawsuit filed by the schools last May 
against the city. 
</P>
<P>
In dispute has been when the elementary and high school districts will begin 
receiving their share of the tax-sharing redevelopment agency funds, projected 
to be $1.4 billion over the 45-year life of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
School officials had claimed that they were due over $1.6 million in revenues 
from the agency, but city officials disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Jerry Harmon said the settlement includes $3 million to be divided among 
Escondido Union, Escondido Union High and the county schools in lieu of office 
space that they were entitled to in a yet-to-be-built regional office building. 
</P>
<P>
The Community Development Commission, the arm of the city that administers the 
redevelopment program, also will delay repayment of a $15-million loan from the 
city, instead funneling those funds to the schools as early as 1991, Harmon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The schools would be receiving money long before the year 2000, which 
initially would have been the time frame if the city had demanded that it be 
paid back first," Harmon said. 
</P>
<P>
The last sticking point dealt with property-development taxes, an issue that 
the board and council members agreed in principle to separate from the 
discussion of redevelopment funds, Harmon said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working in harmony in meeting the needs of the community as opposed to 
battling each other," said John Laing, a member of the Escondido Union board. 
</P>
<P>
Laing declined to specify when the agreement would go to a vote of his board, 
saying that detailed wording of the agreement has yet to be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not committed to a time frame as much as we are to getting an accurate 
document," Laing said. 
</P>
<P>
It was misunderstanding of the precise wording of the redevelopment plan that 
first led to the conflict between the schools and the city. 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment agency, which was created in 1985, froze assessed property 
values and property taxes within a district, and as the city developed, 
property tax revenues that exceeded the frozen level went to the city-run 
redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
The school districts are entitled to nearly two-thirds of the revenues that go 
to the redevelopment agency, after certain conditions have been met. 
</P>
<P>
The school districts had claimed that those conditions -- which include funding 
for the building of the new City Hall and the city's proposed cultural arts 
center -- had been met, but city officials disagreed.

PARKING FEE FOR PADRES' GAMES MAY REACH $4; 
</P>
<P>
SPORTS: CITY COUNCIL STILL MUST APPROVE THE STADIUM AUTHORITY BOARD'S VOTE TO 
RAISE THE PARKING FEE FROM $3. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Padres asked for and received Thursday from the Stadium Authority 
Board a 33% price increase in parking fees, from $3 to $4 per car. 
</P>
<P>
Although the board voted 5 to 3 for the increase, with one member absent, it 
must be approved by the City Council before it is imposed at the start of the 
Padres' next season, in April. Council approval is expected Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Padres' president Dick Freeman, who appeared at the meeting to argue the club's 
case, said its current parking fees are among the lowest in major-league 
baseball. Twenty-two of 26 teams charge $4 a car, Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
Former city councilman and now state Assembly candidate Mike Gotch voted 
against the increase, both in committee and in the full session. Gotch said he 
opposed the measure primarily for the economic burden it places on fans at a 
time of impending recession. 
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, if there is to be an increase, I feel the revenues should flow back 
to the stadium," Gotch said. "It would give the fan a laundry list of capital 
improvements that he or she could see they had helped pay for, such as new 
seating and lighting" designed to enhance fan safety. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman said the increases are necessary to allow the Padres to remain 
competitive with other major-league franchises -- paying high-priced salaries 
and signing free-agent talent, for example. The money also would be used to 
build up its minor league and scouting programs, an effort that new owner Tom 
Werner and new general manager Joe McIlvaine have undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
As it stands, the council will be asked to approve the increase, and, in a 
separate request, to return any surplus money to the stadium fund at the end of 
the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Under the existing arrangement with the Padres, the city receives the first 
$1.5 million of the parking money, minus operating costs paid to its licensed 
contractor, Ace Parking. Beyond that, the Padres and the stadium split the 
money "50-50," stadium manager Bill Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Gotch said that, largely because of last year's concert by the British rock 
group The Who, the stadium made a profit of about $200,000. The City Council 
then returned half of that money to the stadium for capital improvements. 
</P>
<P>
After a 1990 season that fell below the expectations of many -- the team was 
picked to win the National League West but finished in a tie for fourth place 
with a won-lost record of 75-87 -- the Padres recently raised ticket prices by 
$1.50. The team's price range is now $11 and $9.50 for reserved seats and $5 
for general admission. 
</P>
<P>
So a family of four wishing to attend a game in 1991 could pay as much as $48 
-- not counting refreshments and souvenirs -- for four reserved seats and 
parking. Gotch said such an increase is "unjustifiable" unless stadium 
improvements are made as a kind of reward. 
</P>
<P>
Padres' president Freeman argued that, even with the increases, the Padres will 
remain among the lowest in the major leagues in overall costs of attending a 
baseball game. He said a survey conducted last year revealed the team to be the 
third-lowest in the major leagues "for what it costs the fan to attend a game." 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope the average fan would understand that we did not raise ticket 
prices after our best years in 1984 (when the team went to the World Series) 
and 1989 (when it finished second to San Francisco)," Freeman said. "We've only 
raised ticket prices twice in the last five years, and we haven't raised 
parking in the last three to four years." 
</P>
<P>
Stadium manager Wilson said the proposed increase has no bearing on parking for 
other stadium events.

CANDIDATES FOR TREASURER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whether Kathleen Brown is more qualified than incumbent Tom Hayes for the job 
of state treasurer is anybody's guess, but The Times' rationale is questionable 
("For State Treasurer: Brown," editorial, Oct. 23). 
</P>
<P>
You admit that Hayes has proven to be "cautious and careful," certainly a 
necessity during these difficult economic times. 
</P>
<P>
You guess that Brown might be the same, but you endorse her simply because you 
believe her campaign rhetoric about how she plans to sandbag corporations into 
remaining in California by using the state's pension fund as a whip with 
respect to buying or retaining their stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, in your words, "sees the job in technical terms." So do I. Ms. Brown, in 
the main, is a professional politician who sees the job in political terms the 
same as her brother, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., would see it. 
</P>
<P>
The treasurer's job is too important to be used as a political springboard with 
grandstand plays. Let Ms. Brown run for a purely political job where she can't 
exploit control of the state's funds to help her up the political ladder.

Many cities have strict ordinances restricting the use of signs on public and

Yet the same elected public officials who write these laws disregard them at

These signs are terrible. Local law enforcement should fine each election

PLANNING IN LOS ANGELES: INSIDE JOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a city that looks as thrown together as many parts of Los Angeles do, the 
very notion that there is any serious municipal planning here might strike some 
as amusing. What's even funnier now is that the Los Angeles City Council and 
the mayor are actually suggesting, with straight faces, that they want a new 
"strong, independent" director of the city Planning Department. 
</P>
<P>
Of course the council and the mayor have always said they wanted an 
independent, decisive planning leader. Until, that is, a major developer would 
come along waving blueprints for a new office building and promises of new 
jobs, more traffic and lots more campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Of course council members have always wanted a director who applied fair and 
equal policies across the board. Until, that is, a vocal group of homeowners 
would argue that the same type of multiunit building that was approved in a 
residential area on the south side of town would be incompatible with the 
residential area on their side of town. Then the council member representing 
those angry homeowners would demand that the Planning Department make 
exceptions to defer to the wishes of the elected official. Of course the 
Planning Department always did. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with a decades-long legacy of the city's plan-on-demand policy, the 
council suddenly wants a strong department. "But everybody wants to be able to 
tell it what to do in their district," admits one council member. 
</P>
<P>
Now we see. This isn't supposed to be funny. Just a joke.

HAPPY HOLIDAY FROM BAGHDAD; 
</P>
<P>
IRAQ CONTINUES TO INSIST THAT ALL IS WELL WITH ALL THE HOSTAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iraqi officials profess indignation over reports that the hostages they seized 
after invading Kuwait are being mistreated. Information Minister Latif Jassim 
notes, "We are Arabs, Arab Muslims . . . Our guests are very important to us," 
as if merely invoking a tradition of hospitality is proof that it is being 
honored. Recently freed French hostages, now safely back home, tell a far 
grimmer story. They report that Western detainees, especially American and 
British, are in many cases being subjected to consistent and sadistic physical 
and psychological abuse. Some are said to be near the breaking point. 
</P>
<P>
An official in Baghdad says his country is prepared to allow the families of 
the hostages to visit them over the Christmas and New Year's holiday. For those 
suddenly cut off by Iraq's aggression from contact with loved ones, the 
putative offer holds out the hope of joyful reunions. Others, less emotionally 
involved, will look on it as yet another cynical ploy to try to manipulate 
public opinion in the West and portray Saddam Hussein's murderous regime as 
benign, humane, caring -- the exact opposites of what its record in fact shows 
it to be. 
</P>
<P>
Note first of all that the Iraqi spokesman who raised the prospect of family 
visits insisted on anonymity. There are thus no fingerprints on this supposed 
invitation, nothing whatever to tie it to government policy. As things stand 
now, it is a retractable, ignorable, deniable proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Note, too, that the holidays are still nearly two months away. That's a long 
time for the hostages, for their families, for the development of events. 
Naturally, the separated family members who now think they may be able to see 
their loved ones can be expected to exert all the pressures they can to 
forestall any actions that might jeopardize their chances of going to Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
The condition of the hostages, to say nothing of their fate, is assuming ever 
greater importance, political as well as emotional. President Bush -- whether 
he was speaking offhandedly or calculatedly -- warns that his patience is near 
an end. Iraqi officials respond that Bush is looking for a pretext to take 
military action. A pretext is a false reason for doing something. But there's 
nothing artificial about Bush's reminder that one of his responsibilities is to 
protect the lives of Americans abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq continues to insist that all is well with all the hostages. Prove it. The 
Red Cross stands ready to inquire into their safety, to determine whether they 
are being fed, sheltered and medicated. There is evidence that some are not, 
that they are instead forced to live in squalid, even life-threatening 
circumstances. Iraq denies this, although Wednesday it said it would be 
releasing four sick and elderly Americans. But the only sure way to really 
learn the facts is to permit objective international observers to see for 
themselves.

MASSACHUSETTS: THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR IS BETWEEN A BULLY AND A COLD PATRICIAN. 
UGH.

<TEXT>
<P>
I'm in a political location known as a quandary, located precisely halfway 
between a rock and a hard place. The rock is John Silber. The hard place is 
Bill Weld. The problem is whom to vote for as governor of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's race here has bewildered outsiders who think of Massachusetts as 
the land of the liberal, the miracle and the Michael. Two angry years after 
Dukakis and the economy went down the chute, the choice for his successor will 
be either a Reagan Democrat or a Bush Republican. 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, there is John Silber, the president of Boston University, a 
man whose style of interpersonal relationship is winning through intimidation. 
But Silber's a man with some attractive ideas, especially about early 
education. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, there is William Weld, the affable patrician-in-training who 
worked in Reagan's Justice Department until he resigned in protest. Weld exudes 
the politics of the well-fed, favoring a tax-cut proposal on the ballot that 
threatens a lethal blow to the state's services. 
</P>
<P>
This race may be an entry in the era of post-character politics. For a time, 
the reassuring notion was bandied about that if you knew the person you could 
judge the policies. But here we look into the mirror and ask: What do you do 
when good people are in favor of bad things and bad people are in favor of good 
things, and when it's hard to tell them apart? 
</P>
<P>
Each time an undecided voter swallows hard, determines to go with Weld's 
temperament and hope for the best, he makes them choke. How do you vote for a 
guy who talks about the AK-47 assault weapon as if it's sporting equipment at 
the Myopia Hunt Club? Just when another undecided voter figures that she can 
pull the Silber lever without sending a lethal electric shock through her 
veins, he raises the voltage. Last week, Silber's comments on blacks and 
Cambodians were topped by the charge that children were "neglected" and 
"abused" by working women "who have thought that a third-rate-day care center 
was just as good as a first-rate home." 
</P>
<P>
Having explored the terrain of undecided turf, inch by inch, only one angle 
holds any promise of decision: Vote against the man with a lifetime of 
contentious bullying in his curriculum vitae. Stop John Silber before he gets 
on the yellow brick road of national politics. 
</P>
<P>
John Silber's scorn for others, his disinterest in listening and what it 
implies -- an occasional change of mind -- makes him unfit. So does the message 
that the victory of this ambitious man would send nationally: The politics of 
anger are winning.

WHERE'S THE BEEF ? IT'S WITH US;

<P>
TERM LIMITS: WE ELECT THE BUMS, THEN SEEK SOME WAY TO KEEP OURSELVES FROM DOING 
SO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD B. TUROVSKY, Ronald B. Turovsky is a lawyer in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Propositions 131 and 140, both of which impose limits on the number of terms 
elected officials may hold office, will almost certainly be approved, perhaps 
overwhelmingly. Experts keep telling us that the popularity of term limits 
represents the frustration of the people with politicians -- that people have 
just plain had it with incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
Experts are giving too much credit to voters. Let's recognize term limits for 
what they are -- the people protecting themselves from themselves. Term limits 
indicate voter frustration with voters who do not care about politics and don't 
pay attention. Our flirtation and fascination with limits will improve nothing. 
When the dust settles, the problems now present in politics will remain. 
</P>
<P>
In other systems, it would be possible to view a movement toward term limits as 
a sign of voter disgust with officials. Let's say that we had lived for years 
under a system where our officials took office based upon birth and could stay 
in office as long as they thought it was fun. Indeed, other systems presume 
that these rulers, above the fray of electoral politics, will best know what is 
good for us and will act with our interests in mind. After a while, we might 
find that officials need to be accountable to serve us best. A movement toward 
limits might fairly reflect discontent. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, we do get to vote. Our system presumes that public officials will be 
more effective if they are accountable. If we think an elected official has 
become a problem, lacks a sense of accountability, has become arrogant or is 
ineffective, we get to throw him or her out. If we think people should not be 
in office after two terms, we may reject them after two terms. 
</P>
<P>
But we do not do any of this. Rather, we continue to elect without hesitation 
whoever has "incumbent" as his or her ballot designation. We presume that the 
challenger is a fringe lunatic. We complain about incumbents, and then we vote 
for our incumbent. Willie Brown and David Roberti, like all other members of 
the Legislature, are reelected to office freely and knowingly. 
</P>
<P>
It is argued that the problem is the way the districts are designed. Incumbents 
cannot lose. Reapportionment is the answer. This also misses the point. No 
matter how the districts are created, these "demons" must receive a majority 
vote of a large population mass. And don't forget -- the recent efforts at 
reapportionment reform were soundly rejected by voters. 
</P>
<P>
Term limits are the political equivalent of the "cement diet" in which the jaws 
are glued shut. To vote for a term limit is to say "I need help; I can't 
control myself; if not stopped I will do something crazy -- perhaps even vote 
for Willie Brown." 
</P>
<P>
Term limits may make you feel good. They may make you feel that you are taking 
radical steps to settle a score with those bums in Sacramento. But they are 
your bums. You keep electing them. No one forces you to do that. The problem is 
not Willie Brown or David Roberti or incumbents. If you have a beef, it is 
properly with yourself.

CALIFORNIA COMMENTARY; 
</P>
<P>
'EARMARKING' BUDGET INTO CONCRETE; 
</P>
<P>
AN ONSLAUGHT OF INITIATIVES WOULD TAX FOR SPECIAL INTERESTS AT THE EXPENSE OF 
THE GENERAL FUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Joel Fox, Joel Fox is president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tax-cutting revolution began in California in 1978 with an initiative, 
Proposition 13, that has held down property tax rates for most of the state's 
homeowners. But this year's state ballot initiatives will test a tax-raising 
concept that could undermine the gains of the tax revolt. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, voters will face three initiatives (Propositions 129, 133 and 134) 
that represent a major effort to impose new taxes using a technique known as 
"earmarking." These ballot measures require that each new tax be designated for 
a specific purpose. 
</P>
<P>
By dedicating these taxes to worthy causes such as fighting crime and drugs or 
funding medical trauma centers, the tax-raisers believe they have found a way 
to persuade voters to boost government revenues. A further inducement is that 
in most cases only part of the population will be subject to the tax because 
only certain products, services or groups are targeted. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, voters are told they will be funding a worthy cause by raising 
someone else's taxes. A recent Los Angeles Times Poll found that self-described 
non-drinkers, about half of the electorate, solidly favored the earmarked 
alcohol tax, Proposition 134, while self-described drinkers opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
The initiatives are sponsored by politicians who use them as platforms to run 
for office, and by people with an interest in the services provided by the new 
funds. The tax on alcohol, for instance, would be earmarked for rehabilitation 
and trauma centers. Not surprisingly, the largest donors to the campaign for 
this measure are the emergency room doctors who would directly benefit from the 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
A second measure, Proposition 129, written by Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp 
during his unsuccessful campaign for governor, would dedicate revenue raised by 
closing so-called corporate tax loopholes to the war against crime and drugs. 
However, these "loopholes" were closed by the Legislature in July to balance 
the state budget. If the initiative passes and rededicates the revenue, a hole 
will be created in the state budget that can be filled only by new tax revenue, 
adding to the state's predicted budget deficit. A legislative budget committee 
also notes that Proposition 134, mandates more spending that it pays for, 
adding to the deficit problem. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there is a sales tax, Proposition 133, also designated to fight the 
drug war and sponsored by Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, who is running for reelection. 
This tax is supposedly "temporary," established for only four years under the 
unlikely assumption the drug war will last about as long as World War II. The 
reality is that after four years many drug enforcement officers will have been 
hired and new programs set in motion. Certainly, the voters will be asked to 
continue this tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of earmarked taxation argue it makes the taxing process more 
accountable to the people. But is this accountability? Once revenue is 
designated for a certain service the money will flow to that service whether it 
is too much to do the job or too little, and without regard to whether the job 
is being done well. The California general fund budget is already tied into 
knots by earmarking. 
</P>
<P>
While the people should have a say on how much more of their money goes to 
government, our representatives are elected to manage the funds and prioritize 
the spending.

A POWERFUL EXPORT BOOM CAN TAKE ROOT IN AMERICA; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: A DROPPING DOLLAR IS NO PANACEA. BUT IT GIVES U.S. PRODUCERS AN EDGE 
AND SUGGESTS A BRIGHT ECONOMIC FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. SAMUELSON, Robert J. Samuelson writes about economic issues from 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you talk to Richard Studer, you'll get a good picture of the economy's 
dispiriting present -- and also its brighter future. Studer runs an Ohio 
company that produces plastics-making machinery. Business is down, and the 
company has laid off 100 of its 800 workers. The bright spot is exports. 
they're up and represent about 15% of orders. There's the future: The U.S. 
economy should soon emerge as a powerful export machine. 
</P>
<P>
Remember the chatter about us becoming a nation of hamburger flippers? The idea 
was always outlandish, but now the economy is moving in the opposite direction. 
It's shifting from growth led by the service sector to growth led by rising 
exports. Service industries that overexpanded in the 1980s -- real estate, 
banking and retailing -- are retrenching, while the dropping dollar should spur 
exports. The change is one reason why the economy is teetering on the edge of a 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news is that the service slump is overwhelming export expansion. In the 
past year, the economy has grown a meager 1.1%. That hasn't been fast enough to 
prevent rising joblessness. The unemployment rate in September was 5.7%, up 
from 5.3% a year earlier. Many economists expect a recession. The good news is 
that any recession may be cushioned by the effects of a lower dollar. Since 
1985 -- when it reached its recent high -- the dollar has declined roughly 50% 
against other major currencies. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the impact on Studer's machinery. Among them are extruders, which can 
make everything from plastic pipes to drinking straws. The least expensive 
extruder costs $25,000. With today's exchange rate of about 1.5 deutsche marks 
to the dollar, that machine costs 37,500 DM in Germany (plus transportation). 
But in 1985, the exchange rate was nearly 3.4 DM to the dollar. A $25,000 
machine then cost roughly 85,000 DM. 
</P>
<P>
Wham! the dollar's depreciation makes U.S. manufactured goods enormously 
competitive. The export boom has already begun. Between 1985 and 1989, exports 
jumped from $219 billion to $364 billion. But the boom has stalled in 1990, 
because the dollar's exchange rate rose somewhat last year. The dollar's recent 
decline reverses that trend and restores the price competitiveness of U.S. 
exports. The trade deficit, now running at about $100 billion annually, should 
drop. In a poll, the National Assn. of Manufacturers found that 52% of 
executives expect higher exports in 1991; only 10% expect lower. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of welcoming a weaker currency may seem subversive. A cheaper dollar 
isn't all sweetness. Traveling abroad is costlier for Americans, while visiting 
theUnited States is less expensive for foreigners. More fundamentally, the 
decline in our trade deficit will increasingly force us to live within our 
means. 
</P>
<P>
What happens to the economy is anyone's guess. The outcome of the Persian Gulf 
crisis could quickly change things for better or worse. What's less murky is 
the connection between the health of the U.S. economy and foreign economies. 
The severity of any U.S. recession will depend heavily on what happens in 
Europe and Asia. Slumps overseas that cut demand for our exports would compound 
the damage, as would a spasm of foreign protectionism. 
</P>
<P>
A dropping dollar is not an economic panacea. It merely gives U.S. producers a 
price edge in international markets. But price isn't everything. There's also 
product quality and reliability, aggressive salesmanship and good service. In 
the 1990s, American industry will have an opportunity to create its own 
brighter future. Whether the opportunity is seized or squandered depends on the 
country's Richard Studers.

3 MORE MEXFLIES FOUND IN WAKE OF ERADICATION EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just days after state and county agriculture authorities ended a five-month 
Mexican fruit fly eradication program in El Cajon last month, three more 
Mexflies were trapped in separate locations around San Diego County, officials 
have confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
The finds, which range from Chula Vista to Hillcrest, are too far apart to 
indicate infestation, said Bill Routhier, an area manager for the state 
Department of Food and Agriculture who oversaw the El Cajon eradication 
program. But he said the finds should serve as a reminder, particularly to 
people who travel into Mexico, that quarantines are serious business. 
</P>
<P>
"We would strongly encourage people to protect their quality of life," he said. 
"Fifty-five million people cross the border each year, and it's very, very hard 
to know what they've got in their pockets. If (people) want to avoid future 
treatments, they should not smuggle." 
</P>
<P>
State officials have increased their trapping around the three finds, as well 
as around one other find in San Diego in early October. When added to the three 
Mexflies found in El Cajon and one found near Balboa Park in late April and 
early May, these flies bring the county's annual total to eight. 
</P>
<P>
An infestation was declared last spring in El Cajon after one male Mexfly and 
two egg-bearing females were found within a quarter-mile area. To combat the 
spread of the pest, the state ordered San Diego county's first-ever spraying of 
the pesticide malathion, a three-dose program that ended in June. 
</P>
<P>
State officials believe they have traced the recently-trapped Mexflies to a 
large shipment of infested mangoes, part of which was intercepted in Tijuana. 
Routhier said 8 tons were confiscated after Mexican consumers complained of 
finding worms in their fruit. But, before the fruit was found, 4 tons had 
already been distributed to markets in Tijuana, Tecate and other Mexican 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
Routhier said the Mexican government has since halted all mango shipments 
coming from Baja California Sur, where the infested batch originated. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to eat mangoes in Tijuana, eat them in Tijuana," Routhier warned, 
"but don't bring them back."

PROTECTING OUR GREATEST RESOURCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM DUCHENE, Tom Duchene is a youth sports activist and chairman of the 
Huntington Beach Committee for Parks and Youth Sports/Yes on D. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like every other citizen in Huntington Beach, the protection of our precious 
beaches and coastline is of paramount importance to me for the beauty and 
serenity it provides to our community. 
</P>
<P>
When the youth sports community wrote and submitted Measure D to the Huntington 
Beach City Council we had just that protection in mind. But we were also trying 
to protect an even greater resource -- our children. 
</P>
<P>
Measure D is one of two ballot issues concerning the beaches and parks that 
will come before Huntington Beach voters Tuesday. Measure C would require a 
public vote and majority approval on the lease, sale, transfer or exchange of 
city-owned beach and park land. Measure D would also require the public vote, 
but only if the land was being sold. 
</P>
<P>
True, Measure C will provide a voter mandate to approve building much needed 
visitor-serving amenities on a blighted parking lot at the base of our pier, 
services that have been approved by the State Coastal Commission and passed 
unanimously by our own Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
That might work in a small town, but is it any way to run a city of 200,000? 
More important, however, are the programs, the facilities and the people, 
especially children, that Measure C will harm. 
</P>
<P>
Various legal opinions not withstanding on both sides of the issue (and the key 
word here is "opinion"), Measure C will require that a full-blown and expensive 
political campaign be waged in Huntington Beach every time we want to build for 
our children a sports facility, a Boys' and Girls Club or even a Youth Shelter 
on any city-owned park land. That would be true even if no public money is 
spent. Quite clearly, these obstacles will freeze our kids out of the process 
by either delaying or ending the hope of these much-needed facilities ever 
being built. 
</P>
<P>
In these times of rampant drug use (yes, even here in Huntington Beach!) and 
ever-increasing gang activity, is this the message we want to give to our kids? 
I don't think so. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach is rightly proud of its nine miles of pristine coastline and 
its city park system that boasts the highest acreage per capita of any 
community in Orange County. Measure D will help ensure that not one grain of 
beach sand or one blade of existing park grass will be disturbed by any 
project, including the Youth Sports Facility. But most importantly, it will 
guarantee that our greatest resource, our own children, will be protected by us 
all. 
</P>
<P>
Like our representative form of government, Measure D may not be perfect, but I 
believe it is the best option to prevent our parks and beaches from being sold 
by our council to anyone. And most significantly, it allows for the planning, 
building and completion of projects that the entire community agrees will serve 
those with the weakest voice in our political system -- our kids. I think the 
voters of Huntington Beach will agree on Nov. 6 by rejecting Measure C and 
voting Yes on Measure D.

WILLIAMS TACKLING HIS POSITION CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You don't want to get Lee Williams upset. Two years ago, the Charger defensive 
end went on a rampage against the Seattle Seahawks and put quarterback David 
Krieg out for six weeks with a separated shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
His idea of a fun Sunday, he has said, "is to eventually break the 
quarterback's face." 
</P>
<P>
When he took exception to the way contract talks were going this past summer, 
rather than dismantle training camp, he opted to walk out. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, however, continue to tease the volcano. They made a position 
change: They shoved him to defensive tackle to make room for pretty boy Burt 
Grossman at defensive end. 
</P>
<P>
As Grossman said, "If I'm Lee Williams, I'd fight it. You don't think Joe 
Montana would want to be moved from quarterback to wide receiver, do you? 
That's sort of the way it is. Both Montana and Williams are at the top in their 
positions, and now they're playing Lee out of position." 
</P>
<P>
Williams went to the Pro Bowl the past two seasons as the AFC's starting 
defensive end. He led the AFC in sacks last season with 14. No one has piled up 
more sacks in the AFC in the past five years than Williams. 
</P>
<P>
But now Grossman is at defensive end, Williams is lost inside, and Grossman is 
tied for the lead in the AFC with eight sacks. Grossman is prepping for Pro 
Bowl interviews in Honolulu, while Williams has been asked to fall on a grenade 
for the good of the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel for him," linebacker Leslie O'Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
If Grossman or O'Neal finish the season tops in sacks for the Chargers, and if 
Williams doesn't attract Pro Bowl attention, Williams figures he will lose more 
than $100,000 in incentives. 
</P>
<P>
And so you expect mad. A real mad Lee Williams, but instead you get the Welcome 
Wagon. Lee (Pollyanna) Williams. Is this an audition to replace Mister Rogers? 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I've been angry to the point where I almost wanted to explode," Williams 
said. "I have felt like I was sacrificed, but it was just a move that had to be 
made for the betterment of the team." 
</P>
<P>
You expect Mr. T, and you get Mr. Congeniality. 
</P>
<P>
"My preference is to play defensive end, and it's a point I've made and a point 
that's been heard," he said. "But right now it's a point that's not relative 
because it's more important to put the best athletes on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, the Chargers' best athlete, has: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The current longest starting streak on the team at 84 games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Played in all 92 games that he has been with the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only six sacks to go to become the team's all-time leader. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Missed only one practice in seven seasons. "I went through warm-ups, so it 
shouldn't be classified as a miss," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But now he's been asked to sacrifice. And although he eventually may earn a 
contract extension and raise for service to the company, who pays the doctor 
bills? 
</P>
<P>
"Playing inside is a real grind," he said. "You get the hell beat out of you. 
It's just flat out brutal. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm probably up about 300% in visits to the training room. I don't think 
there's a day that goes by that it's not one thing or another. No doubt about 
it, it shortens your career." 
</P>
<P>
Is there any other choice? 
</P>
<P>
"Where would you put Burt?" O'Neal said. "Regardless, somebody gets screwed. 
You going to move me? Somebody is going to get messed up when you have a lot of 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"That's great when you can stockpile a position, but eventually there's going 
to be unrest and someone is going to be unhappy, so you end up getting rid of 
somebody down the road." 
</P>
<P>
Blame it on Grossman. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got drafted they overstocked," he said. "But they picked me, I didn't 
pick them. I'm not at fault, but that situation I think is at fault. They only 
need two and they got three. The logical choice to go inside is the biggest 
one, and that's Lee." 
</P>
<P>
But as a defensive end, Williams was one of the game's standouts. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can handle him one on one," said tackle Broderick Thompson, who has to 
contend with Williams in practice. "He's proven that year after year. 
</P>
<P>
"Defensive linemen get their notoriety through sacks. And when he looks up and 
down the list and sees the people who are leading, and knowing they aren't 
better than him, that has to frustrate him." 
</P>
<P>
You want frustration: Williams had 4 1/2 sacks when this week began, but upon 
NFL review, it was determined he was credited with a half sack that should have 
gone to linebacker Henry Rolling. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get to be a Pro Bowl player, you start to attract more attention from 
offensive people," defensive coordinator Ron Lynn said. "People make specific 
plans to make sure Lee Williams doesn't get as many sacks as he had a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"When that happens and a guy doesn't see the big picture, he has a tendency to 
get frustrated. Even if he does see the big picture, he has a tendency to get 
frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
When the Chargers played Cincinnati earlier this season, the Bengals had a 
tight end or running back block Grossman. They placed a guard in front of 
Williams and then had a 300-pound tackle on call to double-team him. 
</P>
<P>
"I was totally neutralized," he said. "But you can't find a tight end or a back 
that's going to be able to block Burt. I think he hit the quarterback 10 times 
in that game." 
</P>
<P>
Grossman also had two sacks in that contest, and unless you have a thing about 
watching pileups, you'd have never known Williams was on the field. 
</P>
<P>
Moving Williams inside to tackle has negated his speed. If he puts an evasive 
move on one blocker, "there's another to hit you in the ribs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot like Secretariat," Williams said. "Take Secretariat and hitch him 
up to a beer truck and have him compete against a Clydesdale, and the 
Clydesdale is going to beat him because you're in the Clydesdale's element. 
</P>
<P>
"Now you take them and run them a mile and a quarter, and you got total 
domination. When you're on the outside as a defensive end, you've got room to 
work. Generally, if you make the first good move, you can go and make something 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
That would be Grossman's present assignment. Williams' draws go nowhere in the 
trenches, and Grossman appears headed to the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't start that crud now," Williams said, and he was not smiling. "I haven't 
conceded defeat by a longshot." 
</P>
<P>
Grossman, though, has eight sacks, has made the cover of Sports Illustrated, 
and was interviewed nationally by ESPN's Roy Firestone. There are 10 players in 
the AFC, including O'Neal with 5 1/2, who have five or more sacks. 
</P>
<P>
"What are you trying to say?" Williams said with a look reserved as a rule just 
for quarterbacks. "He's got my job in the Pro Bowl? What about O'Neal? 
</P>
<P>
"We'll see. I think that's a chapter that hasn't yet been written."

SOCKERS' QUINN IS SWEET ON HIS DUAL ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN GEIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not as though Socker midfielder Brian Quinn has to make a career decision 
any time soon. At 30, he is considered one of the top soccer players in the 
country, yet this year he is making a transition toward a non-playing career. 
</P>
<P>
Besides his role as Coach Ron Newman's top playmaker on the field, Quinn is now 
Newman's assistant coach off it. 
</P>
<P>
But Quinn has been spending all of his time in the latter role. The midfielder 
has been slowed by a right groin strain that has kept him out of all four games 
this year. It will keep him out of the team's home opener against the St. Louis 
Storm at 7:30 tonight at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting is nothing new to Quinn. He had to do just that for parts of the past 
four seasons because of various injuries. 
</P>
<P>
So with his body telling him it's not getting any younger, Quinn has begun to 
adjust. He does not want to leave the game like a few of his former teammates 
who kept going into their mid-30s only to be forced out with little dignity. 
</P>
<P>
"It happens to all soccer players," Quinn said. "They realize that when they 
stop playing, they can't go back, so we let someone else make the decision for 
us. I think we all feel we can play one more year -- that we'll be young 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
"When my time comes, I hope to realize it right then, that there's no 
back-biting or animosity between the parties. And the best way to do that is to 
go on to something else. I'd love to stay with the Sockers organization." 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, Quinn already is gaining respect for his coaching ability 
through his playing skills. 
</P>
<P>
"During the first few weeks of training camp, I just tried to stay with Brian 
Quinn everywhere on the field," rookie David Banks recalled. "I wanted to watch 
what he does, even off the ball. He's definitely one of the best players in the 
league. The things he does are unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Fellow rookie Eddie Henderson has also found himself spectating when Quinn is 
on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"Just watching him play, you can learn so many little things that you wouldn't 
even think of doing," Henderson said. "Going to indoor (soccer from outdoor 
soccer) is a much more difficult transition than most people think. A lot of 
times you get stuck along the boards between two defenders. That happened to 
Brian one day and I thought, 'OK, how's he going to get out of this?' Then he 
flipped the ball up about shoulder high, the two guys collided, he turned, 
chested it down and volleyed it into the net." 
</P>
<P>
Although Banks referred to him as "one of the best players in the league," 
there are those, such as Newman, who find no need to qualify their statements. 
They say Quinn is the best. 
</P>
<P>
But in the regular season, Quinn often goes unnoticed. He is the blue-collar 
guy, a proletariat who scurries around doing the dirty work and then dishes off 
so others can capitalize. 
</P>
<P>
Thus his name is not among last year's regular-season leaders in scoring, goals 
or assists. 
</P>
<P>
But as much as he does behind the scenes in the regular season to orchestrate 
the Sockers' attack, he often steps up his intensity and assumes a different 
identity in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
A look at last year's playoff statistics, and Quinn is everywhere. He topped 
the list of scoring leaders with 26 points, nine more than teammate Paul 
Wright's second-place total of 17. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn was also No. 1 in assists with 17, eight more than No. 2 Billy Ronson of 
Baltimore with nine. 
</P>
<P>
His nine goals were the second-most in last year's playoffs. Only teammate Waad 
Hirmez and Kansas City's Dale Mitchell (each with 10) had more. 
</P>
<P>
After his scoring explosion helped the Sockers to their eighth championship in 
nine years, Quinn was voted most valuable player, becoming only the second 
person to win that award twice. He also won it after the 1986 playoffs (in 
which the Sockers defeated the Minnesota Strikers in seven games). Steve Zungul 
is the other two-time recipient. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his contributions to the team, President Ron Cady called Quinn into 
his office, patted him on the back and told him what a good job he did. Cady 
also said the team needed to cut his pay because the league reduced each team's 
salary cap from $770,000 to $630,000. 
</P>
<P>
How could the Sockers adequately compensate Quinn and not have the money count 
toward the salary cap? That's when the assistant coach ploy was devised, but 
Quinn insisted that it be more than a ploy. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to take a coaching position just to be a figurehead," he said at 
the time. "I would like to be involved." 
</P>
<P>
As the season enters its third weekend, Quinn still is searching for his niche. 
</P>
<P>
"Ron has his way of doing things," Quinn said when asked about his role, "and I 
have to find what I can do without interfering with what he does." 
</P>
<P>
Which could take some time. As Quinn pointed out, he's pretty much a rookie at 
this coaching thing. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't go from being a player to being a coach in one day," he said. "You 
don't go to college one day and graduate." 
</P>
<P>
Quinn talks of his new role as though it is a small part of his duality with 
the club. But the young players tell a different story. When they have a 
question about tactics or strategy, they often go to Quinn, rather than Newman 
or Erich Geyer, another assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I often go up to him because we can speak more freely with Brian," Banks said. 
"I feel I can trust him. He's not going to shout you down -- he gives you 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Added Henderson: "He keeps your confidence up, but he doesn't build something 
that's not there. If you do something wrong, he'll say so, and as a rookie, 
you're going to make a lot of mistakes. The other guys will look down at you 
and say, 'Come on.' But Quinny just says, 'This is how you do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
That the new players are more comfortable talking with Quinn is not necessarily 
a knock on Newman and Geyer. 
</P>
<P>
"The younger players feel more confident talking to him than to Ron just 
because he's still a player," second-year forward Rod Castro said. "He 
understands players' feelings and what's going on in their minds." 
</P>
<P>
Castro said Quinn occasionally directs players through practices, a task of 
which Quinn at first was wary. 
</P>
<P>
"It could have been difficult," Quinn said, "but I feel a lot of the players 
have been really supportive of me. I ask them to do something and they do it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Castro: "For me, I have no problem with it because I respect (Quinn) as a 
player and as a person. If he can, he is always going to give 100%, so it's 
easy to respect him. Of all the players, he was the perfect candidate for this 
position because he has always done whatever it takes to win." 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers on Thursday filled their final two developmental spots by signing 
two local products, Martin Donnelly, Jr., who played at St. Augustine and 
Kearny High, and Joe Giacalone, who played at Mission Bay High. Both had been 
training with the Sockers since camp opened Sept. 10. . . . Donnelly is the son 
of former Socker Martin Donnelly, who played for the team from 1980-84. Martin 
Jr. is the first son of a former MSL player to enter the league. . . . 
Giacalone played collegiately with Socker midfielder Thien Nguyen at UC San 
Diego.

<P>
WESTLAKE TO SHOW OFF ITS SHOWTIME OFFENSE; THOUSAND OAKS COUNTERS WITH ITS 
BRUTISH BRAND

<P>
Two teams with styles as different as the lambada and the waltz will step out 
at 7:30 tonight at Thousand Oaks High in a football game for the Marmonte 
League lead. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake, the area's top-ranked team, is sleek, cerebral and sassy. A creative 
young coach and a wealth of skill-position players have made the Warriors the 
nouveau riche of football in the Conejo Valley, headed for the playoffs for the 
second year in a row after last qualifying in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks, the No. 1 team in last season's final Times Valley poll, is 
predictable and proud of it. The Lancers are old money, a safe bet to make the 
playoffs, where they are 8-5 in yearly visits since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake (8-0, 5-0 in league play) turns a game into a show, employing 
entertaining sleight of hand and playfully asking, "Guess what's behind door 
No. 1?" 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks (6-1-1, 4-0-1) lowers its head and bashes down the door. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake's offense runs the gamut of gimmicks, including a double forward pass 
and a formation that places every lineman far to one side of the center. On 
another play, the kick holder appears to have forgotten the tee. He dashes to 
the sideline to retrieve it. The ball is snapped and he becomes a pass 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Can something new be expected tonight? "Of course, always," Jim Benkert, 
Westlake's second-year coach, said gleefully. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks, on the other hand, ran a simple reverse against Royal last week 
and second-guessers came out of the woodwork. The play resulted in a fumble and 
enabled Royal to kick a last-second field goal and forge a 26-26 tie. 
</P>
<P>
"Our offensive coaches have been doing a tremendous job for several years and I 
have the highest respect for their decisions," Bob Richards, Thousand Oaks' 
eighth-year coach, said stoically in response to the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
The teams' wildly divergent approaches also are apparent in their preparation 
for this game; Westlake went theatrical while Thousand Oaks tried to conduct 
business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WESTLAKE'S AGENDA 
</P>
<P>
Monday: Read gut-wrenching letters from 32 former Westlake players who 
expressed their deepest regret at having been soundly beaten by Thousand Oaks 
in 1989 (25-0) and '88 (24-6). Watching this year's Warriors gain revenge would 
enable them to pick up the pieces and go on with their lives, they write. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday: Cover tackling dummy with Thousand Oaks jersey. Proceed to repeatedly 
maul said dummy. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday: Break out limited edition T-shirts emblazoned with a motivational 
slogan designed for this game. "We are emphasizing Thousand Oaks, that makes 
this game special," Benkert said. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday: Light drills, heavy on the gusto. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THOUSAND OAKS' AGENDA: 
</P>
<P>
Monday: Anything associated with Westlake is conspicuously absent. A banner 
hanging in the locker room simply states: "A championship: Who wants it?" 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday: No Westlake jerseys in view. In fact, no tackling dummies are in view 
-- all Lancer hitting drills are live. However, a selected quote by a Westlake 
player from a recent newspaper article is taped to some lockers. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday: Rob Elliot, the Lancers' line coach, breaks out a few choice songs, 
including "Bad to the Bone." No mention of Westlake or Warriors in the lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday: Polishing plays with a gleam in their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"All we are doing is preparing for a championship game in November," Richards 
said. "Emotion will carry you part of the first quarter. Then it comes down to 
the personal confidence of the players. Both teams will have (adversity) during 
the course of the game. How they respond to that adversity will determine the 
outcome." 
</P>
<P>
The closest Westlake came to adversity last week in a 56-6 win over Simi Valley 
was the holder forgetting to take the field on an extra-point try with Westlake 
ahead, 36-0. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors' reaction? They stood on the sideline and laughed, coaches and 
players alike. Greater intensity will be required tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"We've turned it up a notch," said Arash Mobayen, a Westlake starter at 
fullback and linebacker. "We're working harder than before." 
</P>
<P>
Westlake might be coming off a laugher, but Thousand Oaks believes its finish 
last week was a crying shame. The Lancers blew a 26-13 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a little letdown in the second half, we just broke down," said Bryce 
Elliot, a two-way lineman and Rob Elliot's son. "I think it was partly because 
we were looking forward to Westlake." 
</P>
<P>
A Lancer actually uttering the "W" word? It was inevitable. In fact, a note 
plastered on a locker-room soda machine says something to the effect of, "You 
think Royal's postgame celebration was something? Wait until you see Westlake's 
if they win." 
</P>
<P>
Familiarity also adds to the intrigue. Many Westlake players live in adjoining 
Thousand Oaks and the players have had plenty of opportunities to cross paths. 
</P>
<P>
"We all know each other, we just had to go to different schools," Westlake 
lineman James Gillespie said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the acquaintances are friendly, like that of Westlake two-way starter 
Dave Monheim and Thousand Oaks quarterback Scott Peterson, who starred together 
on youth basketball teams. 
</P>
<P>
Others are less so. Defensive lineman Dave Acosta, Thousand Oaks' leading 
tackler, made a special request of Elliot, his position coach. "Dave wants to 
line up across from (Jim) McCrossan," Elliot said. "I told Dave I think we can 
work that out." 
</P>
<P>
Acosta and McCrossan belonged to the same gym in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
"I know Acosta, we're not friends," McCrossan said. "At the gym there were 
verbal confrontations. Just about the schools, nothing personal. Just 
disagreements." 
</P>
<P>
About all these teams agree on is that tonight has not come soon enough. 
</P>

BISHOP AMAT SORTS OUT ANGELUS RACE 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bishop Amat High School gave some clarity to the Angelus League football race 
Thursday and left Mater Dei grasping for some sort of consistency. The Lancers 
overwhelmed a listless Monarch offense for a 21-7 victory in front of 7,000 at 
Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The victory leaves Bishop Amat (7-1, 3-0 in league) in sole possession of first 
place with one game remaining. The Lancers need only to defeat Loyola next week 
to win their ninth consecutive league title. 
</P>
<P>
And the Lancers can thank Jason Patterson for their lofty position. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson, a senior defensive end/fullback, dominated the Monarchs' offense and 
ran over their defense. 
</P>
<P>
With two minutes left, the Monarchs faced a fourth-and-two situation at the 
Bishop Amat 13. Quarterback Billy Blanton attempted a bootleg but was brought 
down from behind for a one-yard loss by Patterson, giving the Lancers the ball 
and the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Patterson is an animal," Bishop Amat Coach Mark Paredes said. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs already knew that. Patterson had four sacks and teamed with 
defensive end Peter Gomez for two more. In all, Blanton was sacked seven times 
for losses totaling 37 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked all week on stopping their defensive ends from crashing," Mater Dei 
Coach Bruce Rollinson said. "They (Bishop Amat) didn't do anything that we 
didn't expect." 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs' problems weren't limited to their passing game. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei (4-5, 1-1) has become more and more dependent on running back Derek 
Sparks. However, he was held to less than 100 yards for the third consecutive 
week. He gained 78 yards in 22 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei had 189 total yards. The Monarchs have scored only 21 points in the 
last three games. 
</P>
<P>
Things may not get much better, either. The Monarchs lost wide receiver Leland 
Sparks, who was taken to the hospital with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson set up the Lancers first touchdown by recovering a Sparks fumble at 
the seven. Three plays later, quarterback Zach Zertuche threw a one-yard 
touchdown pass to Eoghan Gallagher in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Patterson's performance wasn't limited to defense. He also had 115 yards 
rushing in 19 carries. He gained 22 yards on the Lancers' second touchdown 
drive, which ended in a four-yard run by Jess Holguin. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, Zertuche threw a flat pass to Scott Fields, who spun 
away from one defender and went 15 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense did the best job they could do," Rollinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The offense? 
</P>
<P>
Well, Mater Dei avoided the shutout when Blanton threw an 11-yard touchdown 
pass to David Gonzalez with three minutes left.

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though they mounted most of their serious drives only in the second quarter, 
Edison High School held on to defeat Ocean View, 23-17, Thursday night in front 
of 3,400 at Huntington Beach High. 
</P>
<P>
Edison (8-1, 6-0 in the Sunset League), got three touchdown passes by senior 
quarterback Josh Gingrich and scored 20 points in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View dropped to 4-2-1, 2-2-1. The Seahawks' hopes for a playoff berth 
rest, in part, on the outcome of their game against Huntington Beach next 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to beat Huntington," Ocean View Coach Howard Isom said. Edison has 
completed its league season. 
</P>
<P>
Edison got another strong performance from Gingrich, who completed 18 of 25 
passes for 268 yards. He entered the game with 1,643 yards passing and 12 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot, 190-pound quarterback got Edison's offense rolling during the 
Chargers' second possession of the second quarter, when he connected with wide 
receiver Mike Cunningham on a 51-yard pass play with 7 minutes 3 seconds 
remaining in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Six minutes later, Gingrich, rolling out to his right and under heavy pursuit 
by at least two Ocean View defenders, teamed with Cunningham on a 10-yard pass 
play for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich and the Chargers then gained possession at their 20-yard line with 
1:04 left before the half and drove 80 yards for another score. 
</P>
<P>
The key plays in the drive were a 40-yard reception by wide receiver Ryan 
Blanchard, who tipped the ball away from two defenders to make the catch, and a 
24-yard run by junior tailback Travis Balding that moved the ball to the Ocean 
View 16. From there, Gingrich hit junior tight end Rod Lippincott on a crossing 
pattern for a 20-3 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View, which had opened the scoring on a 42-yard field goal by Ron 
Lightner on its first possession of the game, cut the Edison lead to 20-10 in 
the third quarter on a 75-yard run by quarterback Randy Karliner. 
</P>
<P>
After Lightner's field goal in the fourth quarter, Ocean View scored its final 
points on a four-yard run by fullback Matt Barry with 49 seconds left.

CONNORS THROWS FOR 5 TOUCHDOWNS IN HART'S 56-0 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Hart High's chances for a Foothill League title may have been seriously 
weakened by last week's loss to Schurr, but the game was long forgotten 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Hart regrouped and trounced San Gabriel, 56-0, in a Foothill League game at 
Keppel High. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to start over," said quarterback Ryan Connors, who completed 12 of 
16 passes for 261 yards and five touchdowns despite playing only 1 1/2 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"We are out of the Foothill League title (picture) and now we just have to put 
that behind us and look ahead toward CIF (playoffs)." 
</P>
<P>
Hart improved to 6-3, 3-1 in league play. San Gabriel is 0-9, 0-4. 
</P>
<P>
Connors, who passed for more than 200 yards for the fifth consecutive game and 
the sixth time this season to bring his season total to 1,773 yards, threw for 
194 yards and three touchdowns in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Brady Vilensky tied his school record with eight point-after kicks. Eight Hart 
receivers caught passes. Brian Bernier caught three for 98 yards and two 
touchdowns. Doug Distaso caught two touchdown passes for 46 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to play games after coming back from a big loss," Hart Coach Mike 
Herrington said about last week's 42-35 defeat. "You wonder what it's going to 
be like and if you're going to be able to execute." 
</P>
<P>
That was not a problem Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Hart led, 42-0, at halftime and did not punt in the game. The Indians rolled up 
291 yards in the first half and 430 in the game. San Gabriel was limited to 
zero net yardage in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Connors connected with Bernier on a 29-yard scoring pass to put the Indians 
ahead, 7-0, 1 minute 19 seconds into the game. 
</P>
<P>
San Gabriel punter Leo Figueroa bobbled the snap on the Matadors' ensuing 
series and Hart's Jami Wolocko recovered at the San Gabriel 19. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Blanchard hauled in a 19-yard pass from Connors to put Hart ahead, 14-0, 
with 8:33 remaining in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 3 1/2 minutes later, Connors hit Distaso on a 44-yard touchdown pass 
to increase the margin to 21-0. 
</P>
<P>
Hart added three touchdowns in the second quarter. Connors connected with 
Bernier on a nine-yard scoring pass and Distaso caught a 55-yard touchdown pass 
to give Hart a 35-0 lead.

EL DORADO FINALLY GETS A LEAGUE VICTORY

El Dorado High School's football players finally got a league victory to go 
with their bumps and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado's 28-10 victory over visiting Katella Thursday night at Valencia High 
was the school's first in an Empire League game in two years. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been doing the same things all year," El Dorado Coach Rick Jones said. 
"But we've been doing it at a new intensity level lately." 
</P>
<P>
To make the playoffs, El Dorado (2-7, 1-3 in league) must beat Los Alamitos 
next week and Cypress and Katella (2-7, 2-2) must both lose. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado sophomore Bryan Warner rushed for 171 yards and two touchdowns in 28 
carries, and also scored on a 65-yard pass play from Jason Bluth. 
</P>
<P>
Bluth threw for 202 yards and two touchdowns, completing nine of 13 passes. A 
senior, Bluth was the quarterback on last year's 0-10 Hawk team. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a long time coming," Bluth said. "We worked hard and it finally paid 
off." 
</P>
<P>
Bluth's confidence has been building each game. 
</P>
<P>
"When you talk about evolution, Darwin has nothing on Jason," Jones said. "He 
is developing into a great leader and an outstanding quarterback." STUART

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK;

<P>
TURNOVERS: EL CAMINO REAL TURNING POINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Camino Real High's offense apparently prefers the easy route to the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
Long drives? The Conquistadores get enough of those on the bus ride to the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
In their four Northwest Valley Conference victories, the Conquistadores (5-1, 
4-0 in league play) have converted one or more defensive or special-teams 
takeaways into decisive points. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it has happened with blinding quickness. Just ask Cleveland, San 
Fernando and Reseda, because when opportunity knocks, the Conquistadores kick 
down the door. 
</P>
<P>
* In its 10-0 victory over Cleveland in a conference opener, El Camino Real 
turned a fumbled punt return and a muffed kickoff return into 10 second-quarter 
points -- all in a span of less than 10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
* In El Camino Real's 14-13 upset of San Fernando, linebacker Adam Guzzo 
returned a third-quarter fumble 76 yards to set up the go-ahead touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Said San Fernando Coach Tom Hernandez: "We were driving, going in to put the 
game away and all of a sudden, it's, 'Hey, wait a minute.' " El Camino Real 
then recovered a fourth-quarter Tiger fumble and embarked on a 13-play drive to 
run out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
* In its 20-0 upset of Kennedy, El Camino Real converted a first-quarter fumble 
into a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
* In last week's 14-7 victory over Reseda, the Conquistadores converted a pair 
of fourth-quarter Regent fumbles into touchdowns. Trailing, 7-0, El Camino Real 
tied the score three plays after nose guard Herbert Cosey recovered a fumble at 
the Reseda 19-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
When Reseda fumbled the ensuing kickoff, Justin Marine recovered to set up the 
go-ahead touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the last few games, they've done a great job of converting turnovers into 
points," Reseda Coach Joel Schaeffer said. "That's what it takes to win close 
games." 
</P>
<P>
Changes: Speedy Rodney Williams should see more time at quarterback for 
Palmdale when the Falcons play host to Quartz Hill tonight. Williams earned the 
starting job in August but was shifted to wide receiver in favor of Jay Mapson 
early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
Williams broke runs of 16 and 18 yards after he took over at quarterback for 
Mapson in the second half of last week's game against Canyon. Mapson completed 
six of 17 passes for 45 yards and threw three interceptions. Williams caught 
four passes for 33 yards. 
</P>
<P>
If Palmdale (3-5, 2-1) defeats Quartz Hill (6-2, 3-0), the Falcons will keep 
alive hopes for a co-championship. 
</P>
<P>
Hard-nosed: Fillmore's Tory Cabral figures to be a key cog for the Flashes when 
they take on Santa Paula next week in a game between Ventura County rivals that 
will decide the Frontier League championship. 
</P>
<P>
Cognizant of Cabral's importance to Fillmore -- he has rushed for 978 yards and 
has scored 104 points in double duty as a kicker -- Fillmore Coach Curtis 
Garner said that Cabral, who sat out last week's win over Nordhoff because of a 
sprained ankle, will play against Calabasas after receiving clearance from his 
doctor Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want him rusty for that Santa Paula game," Garner said. "That would 
mean a two-week layoff and I don't want that. A layoff is not gonna do him any 
good. It's all right for one week, but two weeks is gonna hurt (him)." 
</P>
<P>
The 77-year rivalry is the oldest in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Seven is enough: After losing its first seven games and committing four 
turnovers in its first five possessions Saturday, Bell-Jeff defeated St. 
Genevieve, 14-13, for its first victory. The teams combined for 10 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Bell-Jeff's Richard Samkow returned a shanked opening kickoff 45 yards for a 
touchdown and the Guards recovered the ensuing onside kickoff before the 
onslaught of miscues. 
</P>
<P>
Bell-Jeff is 1-1 in San Fernando Valley League play with two games remaining 
and still has a shot at a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we got a few breaks," said Bell-Jeff Coach Doug Woodlief, whose team 
has only 23 players and was outscored, 195-48, in its first seven outings. "I'm 
just glad we scored. It's been a weird season. We play pretty well and then we 
start to make mistakes and give up the big play." 
</P>
<P>
Water boy: Harvard water polo Coach Rich Corso does not like to use his ace 
goalkeeper Antonio Gomez when the Saracens play in a shallow-end pool because 
he feels it affects Gomez's timing and fosters bad habits. 
</P>
<P>
In a match against Crespi at Woodcrest Park earlier this season, Corso 
recruited Andre Carlo, a 6-foot-4 volleyball and basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
"I just asked around school for a big guy and found him in the weight room," 
Corso said. "To play shallow-end goalie, you don't need to know how to swim; 
all you need to know is how to catch the ball and throw it." 
</P>
<P>
When Harvard played at La Salle last week, Carlo was practicing with the 
basketball team and could not make the match. Corso asked Marc Broidy, the team 
manager, to play shallow-end goalie instead. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time I ever saw him in the water with the ball," Corso said. 
"He wasn't too enthusiastic at first, but the whole team started shouting his 
name on the bus and he decided to try it." 
</P>
<P>
Broidy played the first quarter in Harvard's 29-4 win. The senior recorded two 
saves and two assists and allowed only one goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been coming to practice for so long that I felt like I knew what to do," 
said Broidy, in his fourth season as manager. 
</P>
<P>
Said Corso: "He had a couple of nice saves and did a real nice job. He had a 
good time and our defense did a good job of not letting them get a shot at him 
too often." 
</P>
<P>
Lampkin still out: Birmingham first-string quarterback Vince Lampkin, who 
suffered a sprained left ankle in a game two weeks ago, has not returned to 
practice. Lampkin sat out the Braves' 48-0 loss to Sylmar last week. He has 
been going through whirlpool treatments and other therapy. 
</P>
<P>
On-target quarterback: Crespi quarterback Cody Smith completed 15 of 22 passes 
for 194 yards and two touchdowns to pace the Celts' 21-10 victory over Alemany 
on Friday. Smith, who has thrown just one interception, has not had a pass 
picked off since the second quarter of the Celts' third game against Hart. 
Smith has gone 22 quarters without an interception. 
</P>
<P>
Prolific author: Deena Drossin of Agoura is rewriting most of the cross-country 
record books in the area. She has broken two course records set by former 
Newbury Park standout Melissa Sutton and was on pace to eclipse another Sutton 
mark until she ran off course. 
</P>

Cornerback Gill Byrd said there was no reason for him to be listed on the 
team's weekly injury report as questionable with a groin pull. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's an ankle," Byrd said after suffering a sprain in Thursday's practice. 
"I don't know how bad it is, but it's real sore now." 
</P>
<P>
Byrd finished Thursday's practice, but after standing on the sideline while the 
offense went through its drills, he said it started aching and becoming harder 
to walk on. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how severe it is," Byrd said. "I think it's going to be a 
day-to-day thing. We run practice on the turf (today), so that's not going to 
help it any, so we'll just have to wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
Byrd leads the AFC with five interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers have not listed starting right offensive tackle Broderick Thompson 
on their injury report, although he has been unable to practice this week 
because of an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
"He should be on there, definitely should be on there," Coach Dan Henning said. 
"He's questionable. I think the likelihood is pretty good (he'll be playing 
Sunday)." 
</P>
<P>
Tackle Joel Patten took Thompson's place on the right side in practice 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Safeties Vencie Glenn (hamstring) and Martin Bayless (calf) also are listed as 
questionable, but both practiced without difficulty Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Billy Ray Smith, although acknowledging that his replacement, Henry 
Rolling, has been playing well in his absence, said he's ready to compete again 
for playing time. 
</P>
<P>
"Years with the team may do you a little bit of good, but in the end they are 
going to go with the guy who can get the job done," Smith said. "It's all up to 
the coaches." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he was in on about 25% of the plays in practice Thursday. "It feels 
fine," Smith said. "I'm not running out there going 'stomach, stomach, 
stomach.' If it doesn't bother me I really don't think about it." T.J. SIMERS

Leon Landry scored two touchdowns in Savanna High School's 21-10 victory over 
Western Thursday at Western High. 
</P>
<P>
Landry scored on a 70-yard run on the game's second play from scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
He also scored from the one-yard line with six seconds left in the third 
quarter to ensure the victory for Savanna (5-2-2, 2-1-1 in league). Landry also 
gained 117 of Savanna's 275 rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
The loss virtually eliminates Western (4-3-2, 1-2-1) from post-season play. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna dominated the first half and took a 14-0 lead on Brook Bell's two-yard 
run with 5 minutes 31 seconds left in the first quarter. The Rebels held 
Western to 32 yards rushing in nine carries and 71 yards passing in the first 
half. Gilbert Brito was intercepted three times in the first half, twice by 
Hien Nguyen. 
</P>
<P>
Brito scored Western's only touchdown on a nine-yard run in the final 1:46 of 
the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of the third quarter, Western returned the kick to the Savanna 46, 
then Brito ran the ball to the Savanna 12 on first down. Shane Foss fumbled the 
ball at the three on the next play and Savanna's Marty Garcia recovered the 
ball at the 10 to stop the drive. BOB BORSUM

UCSD MEN'S SOCCER TEAM HANGS TOUGH TO WIN 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a bully of a match, so it only seemed appropriate that the two biggest 
players on the field teamed to decide it: UC San Diego 1, Cal State San 
Bernardino 0. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly 100 scoreless minutes in a tough overtime match, UCSD's Chris 
Romey headed in a corner kick from Chris Hanssen to give UCSD (16-2-1) a 
victory in the men's NCAA Division III first-round playoff match before 1,000 
in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not supposed to even take (the corner kicks)," said Hanssen, a 6-foot-2, 
190-pound junior. "Jarret Stevenson normally takes them, but he was out the 
game so I went ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Hanssen described the play as a "pile-up," so he just "whacked it." Romey, a 
6-3, 205-pound sophomore, managed to find an opening and banged it in for his 
fourth goal of the year. Hanssen's assist was his seventh, which leads the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD advanced to the second round at 1 p.m. Sunday at home against against St. 
Thomas (Minn.), a 1-0 winner over Macalester. St. Thomas is 15-1-2. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was particularly gratifying for Hanssen because he attended San 
Gorgonio High with eight San Bernardino players. 
</P>
<P>
"They're good at what they do," San Bernardino Coach Carlos Juarez said. 
"They're good at those crosses. We won 80% of the balls in the air today. 
Unfortunately, we let that one through." 
</P>
<P>
UCSD, which has won one national championship, has finished second once and 
third once in eight consecutive trips to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino (14-6) was making only its second playoff appearance. The 
Coyotes finished third in 1987 after defeating UCSD in a first-round match on 
penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's match appeared headed in that direction, too. Both teams had few 
legitimate opportunities as most of the action took place between the penalty 
boxes, and often it resulted in one or more players sprawled on the turf. Four 
yellow cards and 56 fouls were assessed during the 120-minute match. 
</P>
<P>
"Very tough. They ruffled our feathers a little bit," UCSD Coach Derek 
Armstrong said. "But that's good-time soccer. That's what the playoffs are all 
about." 
</P>
<P>
Said Romey, who entered the game as a substitute, "They're the most physical 
team we played all year." 
</P>
<P>
Juarez and Coyote midfielder Anthony Rossi had similar statements about UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected that kind of game," Rossi said. "That's the way UCSD plays. 
They're big and they're strong."

Hart 56, San Gabriel 0 -- Hart bounced back at San Gabriel after last week's 
upset loss to Schurr, which cost it the Foothill League title.

Hart, which led, 42-0, at halftime, improved to 6-3 overall and 2-1 in league

Thomas held the record with 369 yards.

<P>
Muir (6-3, 3-1) struck quickly against Hoover (2-6, 0-4) and never let up.

Thomas opened the game by completing 13 consecutive passes. When the streak

CORONA DEL MAR GIRLS UPSET TUSTIN

The Corona del Mar High School girls' cross-country team upset heavily favored 
Tustin Thursday at Irvine Regional Park to finish first in the Sea View League 
final, gaining a share of the league title with the Tillers. Saddleback took 
the boys' title outright. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings, who came into the finals in fourth place in league, had five 
girls finish in the top 15 for 54 points. Woodbridge was second with 63 points 
and Tustin, previously undefeated and ranked fourth in the Southern Section 
Division II, finished third at 64. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Kirsten McFarland finished in third place in a time of 18 minutes 8 
seconds over the three-mile course to lead Corona del Mar. Freshman Alicia 
Boice was ninth (18:37), Heather Bray 13th (19:02), Mollie Flint 14th (19:07) 
and Kristen Shryock 15th (19:08). 
</P>
<P>
Tom Cheese, in his fourth year as the Corona del Mar girls' coach, said his 
team was ready to run well, but he didn't expect them to win. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised by the final outcome," said Cheese, whose Sea Kings are ranked 
fourth in Division III and finished third at the Division II state meet last 
season. "I thought we had a decent shot at getting second, but I didn't get my 
hopes up to win." 
</P>
<P>
Cheese said Corona del Mar's victory was due more to the team's overall 
improvement than to any one or two runners doing well. 
</P>
<P>
"There were not any big surprises, it was just a matter of everyone running 
well," he said. "I was really stunned to see five of them come in that quick." 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge's Kay Nekota won the girls' race in 16:58, out-sprinting 
University's Tanja Brix over the last 50 yards. Nekota, a 13-year-old freshman 
who was pushed by Brix throughout the race, raised her fist in a victory salute 
and let out a little yell as she passed the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really not that demonstrative," Nekota said. "But I never thought I would 
break 17 (minutes) this year." 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback, ranked No. 2 in Division I, easily won its second consecutive boys' 
title with 21 points. Corona del Mar was second (71) and Woodbridge third (75). 
Saddleback's Eddie Salinas won in 14:59, but he was nearly upset by Corona del 
Mar's Mike Marumoto, who finished second in 15:10. 
</P>
<P>
Mel Silva, the Saddleback boys' coach, said he was disappointed with his team's 
performance at the Mt. San Antonio College Invitational Oct. 20, when the 
Roadrunners finished third in the sweepstakes race behind Madera and Hart. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a team meeting after the race," Silva said, "and we talked about 
whether we were going to get serious and do well or we were going to slack off. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I have a little thorn to get out of my side when we get to the Southern 
Section (preliminaries) because the last time we ran the course (at Mt. San 
Antonio), we didn't perform well."

TITANS RING IN 58 CENTS WORTH OF CALLS BY VOLLEYBALL PLAYERS

<P>
It won't exactly balance the budget, but Cal State Fullerton's athletic 
department received an unexpected 58 cents this week when two Titan volleyball 
players were ordered to reimburse the cost of toll calls made from Coach Jim 
Huffman's office last year. 
</P>
<P>
Leanne Grotke, Fullerton associate athletic director, said the two calls, made 
by junior Angela Lightfoot (48 cents to Long Beach) and senior Anne Witkowski 
(10 cents to Lakewood), were among eight improper calls discovered during an 
athletic department inquiry into the volleyball program this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The calls, which amounted to $1.16, were among several minor NCAA rule 
violations uncovered in the program. Grotke said that Lightfoot and Witkowski 
were the only present Titan players affected by the phone violations. 
</P>
<P>
The department is still in the process of preparing a report that will be sent 
to a Big West Conference compliance committee this month. Fullerton Athletic 
Director Ed Carroll said the violations could result in a private or informal 
reprimand from the conference. MIKE DiGIOVANNA

Garden Grove League -- Linh Le of Los Amigos became the first league runner to 
break the 15-minute mark on the three-mile course at Mile Square Park in 
Fountain Valley, but Santiago's boys and girls swept to league titles. 
</P>
<P>
Le took the lead 200 yards into the race and finished in 14:50, breaking his 
league mark of 15:06 set two weeks ago in a dual meet against Bolsa Grande on 
the same course.

<P>
Santiago won the team championship with 32 points, placing five runners among 
the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I wouldn't do that well with the wind (9 m.p.h.), but it was a 
breeze," Le said. "This was my last race here, and I wanted to set the league 
record. All the people that came out here were my motivation." 
</P>
<P>
Santiago's girls' team had six finishers among the top 10 and easily won the

MGM Grand Inc.: The casino and airline conglomerate reported a $10.1-million 
third-quarter loss, contrasted with net income of $900,000 in the same period 
last year. Revenue for the period was $38.9 million, about the same as in the 
third quarter of 1989. The Culver City-based firm cited a reduced casino win 
percentage, increased airline fuel prices and advertising, and other costs 
related to the August introduction of DC-8 two-class service between Los 
Angeles and New York.

CUSTODY FIGHT BLAMED AS WOMAN KILLS DAUGHTER, 3, THEN HERSELF

A woman who feared that her estranged husband would gain custody of their 
3-year-old daughter shot and killed the girl and then herself Wednesday as they 
rode in a friend's camper in Panorama City, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Josephina Rios, 29, died about 10:15 p.m., four hours after she fired a single 
round into the head of her daughter, Samantha, and then shot herself in the 
head, Sgt. Joe Braza said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators found a one-page note apparently written by Rios saying that she 
was despondent over the prospect of her husband gaining custody of their 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Mike Houchen said Rios feared that her husband, Antonio Rios, would 
disappear with the child. The couple, who lived in Anaheim, had been separated 
for about a year and were going through a divorce. "The mother left a suicide 
note indicating this was best for the child and herself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Richard Iddings said the handwritten note also asked for forgiveness from 
God and her family. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the shooting, Rios and her daughter were riding in the back of a 
camper driven by Pasquale Buzzelli. Buzzelli told police that he was driving 
the two to his Panorama City house from East Los Angeles, where Rios was 
staying with members of her family. 
</P>
<P>
Rios and her daughter chose to ride in the back of the camper so they could 
sleep before a Halloween party at a local park, Lt. Richard Iddings said. 
</P>
<P>
As he passed Branford Park, Buzzelli said, he heard two sharp reports, seconds 
apart. He continued driving the few miles to his residence, however, because he 
thought the noises were backfires or Halloween revelers. 
</P>
<P>
But when he arrived home, Buzzelli found Rios and her daughter wounded. Rios 
apparently used a handgun that was kept in one of the camper's cabinets. 
Buzzelli had shown her how to use the gun the week before, Iddings said. 
</P>
<P>
Buzzelli shut the door and drove to Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program in 
Panorama City. Samantha was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital. Her 
mother died about four hours later.

POLICE BARRED FROM WORK AT BINGO PARLORS; 
</P>
<P>
IDENTITY INC.: THE ACTION COMES A WEEK AFTER AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION OF 
OFFICERS ACTING AS SECURITY GUARDS AT THE CITY'S LARGEST SUCH OPERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department has revoked permits allowing its officers to 
work as off-duty security officers in 75 bingo parlors as a result of 
allegations that the officers knew about financial improprieties at the city's 
largest bingo operation. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chief Mark A. Kroeker ordered officers who work at bingo parlors to turn 
in their permits Thursday, a week after the department began an Internal 
Affairs investigation into allegations against officers working at Identity 
Inc., a Woodland Hills charity. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been brought to the attention of the department that, in many cases, 
this type of employment involves an inherent and blatant conflict of interest 
for Los Angeles police officers, and, therefore, should be prohibited," Kroeker 
said in an internal memo circulated to division commanders. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Social Service Department, which regulates bingo operations, has 
long advocated barring police officers from working at the parlors. Officials 
said the appearance of impropriety can arise when the department investigates 
parlors where officers are working. Cmdr. William Booth said the order, which 
was issued at the direction of Chief Daryl Gates, will affect officers who work 
at any of the 75 licensed bingo halls in the city. The number of officers 
affected was not known, but bingo operators generally use from one to seven 
security guards. In addition to hiring off-duty police officers for about $15 
an hour, many of the bingo operations use private security firms or retired 
police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Kroeker, commanding officer of the Personnel and Training Bureau, wrote that 
officers may reapply for permits once they are revoked, but such requests "will 
be evaluated on a case-by-case basis." 
</P>
<P>
Identity, which serves the disabled, operates the largest bingo game in the 
city, and has grossed about $29.4 million since February, 1982. About 80% of 
that money was returned to players in prize money. 
</P>
<P>
The Social Service Department is seeking to revoke Identity's bingo license 
because of charges that workers who helped run the games were paid from $100 to 
$300 a session. State law requires that workers for charitable bingo games be 
unpaid volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Two former Identity bingo workers who testified last month that they received 
the illegal payments also said they believed that off-duty police officers who 
worked as security guards were aware of the improprieties. The former workers 
also told The Times that wives of the officers played for free or were among 
the paid volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations prompted the Internal Affairs investigation, which is 
continuing, police said. A parallel criminal investigation also is under way by 
the vice unit into accusations by former Identity workers that some bingo 
proceeds went unreported. 
</P>
<P>
Edith Ryan, founder and president of Identity, has denied any wrongdoing by the 
charity. Monday, Ron Ponzi and Kenneth Hurwitz, two officers who work at 
Identity, testified at a hearing that they never saw or heard any workers 
talking about being paid. 
</P>
<P>
City investigators later revealed that during an Aug. 19 search of Identity's 
bingo hall on De Soto Avenue, detectives found a torn check for $65 written by 
Hurwitz's wife in a trash can. Investigators said the fact that her check was 
thrown out could indicate she played bingo for free. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan told The Times that she often allows guests to play for free because it is 
not illegal. City bingo regulators said the practice is not specifically 
outlawed but could be construed as unfair and a misuse of charitable funds. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the Police Department tried to discourage officers from working at the 
Identity bingo games, but an investigation failed to find any wrongdoing and 
the officers were permitted to continue the work.

BOLAND AND ALLERT FIGHT AGAIN OVER ANTI-CRIME TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clashing again over who is the steelier crime fighter, Assembly candidates 
Paula Boland and Irene Allert squabbled Thursday about which of them first 
called for an end to early prison releases for repeat sex offenders. 
</P>
<P>
Boland, a Republican, said at a press conference that if she is elected she 
plans to introduce a bill prohibiting the early release of twice-convicted 
rapists and other sex offenders who accumulate credits for good behavior in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
Considered the front-runner in the GOP-dominated 38th Assembly District, Boland 
said she has already written legislation to introduce on her first day in 
Sacramento and that "this idea came from me." 
</P>
<P>
But Allert, a Democrat, said in a telephone interview that although she has not 
actually drafted a bill, she backs elimination of early releases and has 
discussed her support for such legislation in her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not original at all," she said of Boland's proposed bill. "It's something 
that I've talked about." 
</P>
<P>
She also noted that Boland opposes Proposition 133 on Tuesday's ballot, which 
contains a provision that would bar early release of those convicted of a 
variety of violent crimes, including rape and sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute marked the second time in less than two weeks that the candidates 
have argued over who has the better anti-crime credentials to represent the 
generally conservative 38th District. The seat is open due to the impending 
retirement of GOP Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette (R-Northridge). 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Northridge rape-counseling center, Boland said, "Incredibly, in 
this state a rapist" convicted a second time "is not called a 'repeat rapist' 
and therefore is given 'good time' off until he strikes for the third time. I'm 
outraged that our law books still contain this kind of insanity." 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged that she has no statistics on how many convicted sex offenders 
have been released early, but said she knows the rate is high from reading news 
stories and talking with police and sex-crime victims. 
</P>
<P>
Boland charged that her opponent was lying and waging "a campaign of deceit" in 
claiming that she was the first to propose keeping sex offenders in prison 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
But Allert said she has often discussed the early release problem and other 
ways to toughen anti-rape laws during her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Allert also said that unlike Boland, she supports Proposition 133, which would 
raise state sales taxes by a quarter-cent for four years to raise money for 
drug enforcement and prevention programs. The initiative also would prohibit 
early release of those convicted twice of murder, manslaughter, rape and sexual 
assault. Allert said even first-time offenders should serve their full 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Boland countered that taxpayers want tougher anti-crime laws without higher 
taxes. Asked if her bill wouldn't cost the state more in prison costs, Boland 
said the state ultimately would save money by not having to arrest and 
prosecute convicts more than once. 
</P>
<P>
Allert also criticized Boland for allying herself with the author of a 
successful June anti-crime ballot initiative that Allert said jeopardized 
abortion rights in California. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative, Proposition 115, mandates that state courts follow federal 
rulings in determining criminal procedural rights. It was written by state Sen. 
Edward R. Royce (R-Anaheim), who attended Boland's press conference and said he 
would co-sponsor her bill in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Allert said critics, including Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, while praising 
other aspects of the initiative, said it would effectively eliminate the right 
to privacy clause in the state Constitution, thereby jeopardizing abortion 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp is sponsoring a measure on Tuesday's ballot, Proposition 129, which 
would clarify the ambiguous language in the law and would protect a woman's 
right to have an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Allert, who favors abortion rights, said Royce's appearance with Boland showed 
her "insensitivity to the choice issue." Boland opposes abortion except in 
cases of rape, incest or medical complications that threaten a mother's life.

2 RACES SLAPPED WITH SURPRISES AS CAMPAIGNS HIT HOME STRETCH; 
</P>
<P>
INGLEWOOD: ONE OF FOUR CHALLENGERS BOWS OUT OF THE RACE TO UNSEAT MAYOR 
VINCENT. HE BACKS VIRGLE BENSON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
And then there were three. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign to unseat Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent lost one of its four 
challengers this week when long-shot candidate Carl McGill announced he will 
withdraw to throw his support behind former Councilman Virgle Benson. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Vincent and Benson, that leaves as active candidates two-term 
Councilman Anthony Scardenzan and John Murphy, a political neophyte with no 
campaign fund who early on had said he is in the race only to help define the 
campaign debate. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent's three remaining challengers say they have no illusions about winning 
next week's campaign outright against the well-funded and formidable Vincent 
organization. Each wants to be the survivor who faces the two-term mayor in a 
runoff election. If enough votes are drawn from Vincent to keep him under the 
50% mark, the top two vote-getters will meet head-to-head to see who will serve 
as the city's part-time mayor for the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
With less than a week until Election Day, veterans of Inglewood's fractious 
politics say the campaign has been remarkably low-key. Vincent has yet to 
appear with his challengers at organized debates, and campaign literature 
contains few outright attacks on Vincent. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent says he takes his opposition seriously but fully expects to return to 
office. Although Vincent reported $87,264 in his campaign fund as of Oct. 20 -- 
more than double his four challengers combined -- he continues to solicit 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent, 56, a county probation officer, has drawn fire throughout the campaign 
for avoiding the other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"Vincent is staying away from candidates forums so he won't have to face hard 
questions from the people in the community," Benson said. "He thinks he doesn't 
have to meet with the citizens because he can afford to send out slick campaign 
brochures." 
</P>
<P>
Benson, 48, who has emerged as the most vociferous Vincent critic, said his job 
as a real estate appraiser and his experience representing District 4 on the 
council from 1983 to 1988 would enable him to boost commercial development in 
Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
Benson criticizes Vincent for not setting the proper example during his two 
terms as mayor. He cites the fines Vincent has paid to settle allegations by 
the state attorney general's office and the Fair Political Practices Commission 
that he misused more than $20,000 in campaign funds. The agencies alleged he 
spent campaign funds on personal expenses during his first term and failed to 
report donations to other Inglewood political campaigns in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent downplays the fines as technical violations of complicated financing 
laws. In his campaign, Vincent has touted the "All America City" award 
Inglewood won last year from the National Civic League for its fights against 
drugs and crime. He contends that Inglewood has prospered since he became the 
city's first black mayor in 1981 and that residents have a better image of 
their city. 
</P>
<P>
He does not attend the candidate forums, Vincent said, because he is running on 
his record and it is there for the voters to see. 
</P>
<P>
Also running on his record as a city official for the past decade is 
Scardenzan, 61, a tool-and-die maker who is serving his third term on the 
council. Scardenzan is critical of Vincent for what he calls a lack of 
integrity and leadership. He nonetheless criticized as mudslinging a Benson 
campaign brochure featuring newspaper stories on Vincent's fines. 
</P>
<P>
Scardenzan, who began his political career in 1974 as a member of the council's 
advisory board, set up Inglewood's sister city relationship with his hometown 
of Pedavena, Italy, in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Scardenzan said he has shown during his nine years on the council that he works 
for all segments of the community. He said he is proud of his early support of 
the police tax passed by voters in 1988 to hire 20 more police officers. He was 
reelected last year to a four-year term representing District 2 on the council. 
</P>
<P>
Scardenzan agrees with Vincent that there have been improvements in the city, 
but he disputes that the mayor should claim credit. "Any program or project the 
city entered into is approved by the full council, not just the mayor," 
Scardenzan said. 
</P>
<P>
October was not a lucrative fund-raising month for Scardenzan, who increased 
his total campaign chest just $825 during the first 20 days of the month to a 
total of $29,636. He raised an additional $1,000 on Oct. 24 after the reporting 
period closed. Well behind Scardenzan in fund-raising is Benson, who doubled 
his campaign fund to $11,075 during October. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, who filed a form saying he had raised less than $1,000, is in his first 
campaign for public office. Murphy, 33, an engineering technician at Hughes 
Aircraft Corp., has lived in Inglewood for nine years. He has no campaign 
organization and has limited his campaigning to candidate forums, where he has 
challenged the effectiveness of the current political leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said his chances of winning are slim, but running for mayor has allowed 
him to make sure that the candidates discuss issues that are important to the 
average resident. Murphy received applause at several campaign forums when he 
insisted on discussing problems such as prostitution, street violence and the 
lack of major department stores or hotels in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
McGill's name will appear on the ballot despite his intention announced 
Wednesday to support Benson. McGill, who has known Benson for about 15 years, 
said the former councilman has demonstrated that he is community-minded and is 
popular enough to challenge Vincent. 
</P>
<P>
McGill, a 31-year-old Los Angeles police officer, ran an unsuccessful campaign 
last year to replace the late Assemblyman Curtis Tucker in a special election. 
He has won acclaim for his anti-gang work in the community. He was a "Person of 
the Week" on "ABC World News Tonight" in 1988 and was profiled in Newsweek 
magazine in 1989 as one of California's top five "problem solvers." 
</P>
<P>
Calling Inglewood a "big city with a small-town mentality," McGill said the 
city needs new leadership and must attack the gang problem by committing more 
money for both law enforcement and prevention programs.

GRANDSON SENTENCED IN MAN'S LONG-UNSOLVED MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An aspiring actor was sentenced Thursday to the maximum term of 27 years to 
life in prison for the 1983 killing of his grandfather during a botched 
burglary of the victim's North Hollywood home. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Superior Court Judge Howard J. Schwab said Noel P. Scott, 29, of 
Woodland Hills deserved the maximum sentence because the defendant "breached a 
relationship of trust with his grandfather." 
</P>
<P>
Scott took several deep breaths and appeared to be on the verge of crying as 
Schwab handed down the sentence. Outside the courtroom later on, Scott's 
mother, Debra Scott, angrily told Deputy Dist. Atty. Sidney D. Trapp Jr., "I 
hope you never sleep again." 
</P>
<P>
The sentencing followed an unusual hearing requested by defense lawyer Rowan K. 
Klein, who charged that trial lawyer Sherwin C. Edelberg had mishandled Scott's 
defense. Schwab denied Klein's request for a new trial even though Edelberg 
acknowledged on the witness stand Thursday that he had failed to call witnesses 
who might have bolstered Scott's alibi that he was at a Beverly Hills 
restaurant when the murder occurred. Edelberg also did not introduce evidence 
about the criminal record of a key prosecution witness, Charles Berkowitz, a 
friend of Scott's. 
</P>
<P>
Schwab said he was upset that Edelberg had not reviewed Berkowitz's criminal 
record but still declined to grant a new trial. Klein said he would appeal the 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
A jury in May found Scott guilty of murdering 70-year-old Louis Fox after he 
entered his grandfather's bedroom early on Oct. 16, 1983, and attempted to 
steal his Rolex watch and a ring. Fox was shot three times in the head. 
</P>
<P>
The murder remained unsolved until Berkowitz informed police in 1988 that Scott 
had told him about the killing a few days after it happened. But Berkowitz 
later told jurors that he had lied about part of the confession to get 
favorable treatment after his arrest on a burglary charge. 
</P>
<P>
Scott was nevertheless convicted on a wealth of circumstantial evidence, 
including the prosecution's claim that the grandson was one of only a handful 
of people who would not have been attacked by Fox's German shepherd guard dog, 
"Dante," upon entering Fox's bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
Other evidence brought out that Scott had boasted to his girlfriend before the 
murder that he would soon inherit his grandfather's house and other belongings.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ROBBERS WOUND 2 MEN IN APARTMENT HOLDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police were searching Thursday for two men suspected of shooting two people 
during a robbery at a Reseda apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
The two shooting victims were hospitalized -- one in satisfactory condition, 
the in other serious condition -- after the 2:30 p.m. shooting at an apartment 
in the 8000 block of Reseda Boulevard, Los Angeles Police Lt. George Rock said. 
</P>
<P>
Rock said two men entered the apartment carrying handguns and demanded money 
from the victims, whose names were not released. When the two refused and tried 
to escape, the robbers fired as many as four shots. Each of the two victims was 
hit once, Rock said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunmen fled. No motive had been established for the attack.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 4 OFFICERS INTERRUPT MEAL TO REVIVE MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four Los Angeles police officers on a dinner break rescued an 86-year-old man 
who lapsed into unconsciousness after choking on a piece of meat at a Van Nuys 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Fisch of Van Nuys was treated and released from Medical Center of North 
Hollywood Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"These gentlemen really did save his life," said Fisch's wife, Beatrice. "I'm 
sure if we would have waited until the paramedics came he would not have 
lived." 
</P>
<P>
Officers Victor Colello, Victor Masi, Richard Luskleet and Robert Leahy were 
eating dinner at the Chris' &amp; Pitt's of Van Nuys restaurant when a 
restaurant employee ran up and told them of the emergency. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in the back room eating dinner and the waiter informed us that there 
was a man that was choking," Colello said. "He didn't have a pulse and he 
wasn't breathing." Colello performed the Heimlich Maneuver on Fisch, dislodging 
the piece of meat from his throat. 
</P>
<P>
Leahy, with Colello assisting, performed CPR on the man. "He was breathing and 
conscious by the time the paramedics came," Colello said of Fisch. 
</P>
<P>
The officers are all assigned to a San Fernando Valley gangs unit.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: KERN COUNTY DROPS ANIMAL CRUELTY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kern County prosecutors on Thursday declined to file animal cruelty charges 
against a former San Fernando Valley woman who faces trial in Los Angeles on 
charges that she duped pet owners into giving away dogs and cats that were 
later sold to medical laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
Kern County Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Jagels said authorities believed Barbara Ann Ruggiero, 27, ran a similar 
enterprise in Bakersfield but decided not to file charges because she already 
faces six years in prison, the maximum sentence allowed under state law for 
nonviolent felonies, if convicted in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero, whose trial is scheduled to begin Nov. 13 in San Fernando Superior 
Court, faces two misdemeanor and 13 felony counts of theft and conspiracy. Even 
if convicted in Bakersfield on similar charges, Ruggiero could not receive 
additional prison time because it would exceed the state sentencing limit, 
Jagels said. 
</P>
<P>
Animal control officers from Kern and Los Angeles counties on Monday raided a 
kennel Ruggiero operated in Bakersfield called the Puppy Pavilion and 
confiscated 80 dogs, which will remain in protective custody. Officers said the 
animals were held in substandard conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Jagels said Kern County prosecutors reserve the right to file charges against 
Ruggiero if she is acquitted in Los Angeles.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two teen-agers received minor injuries and two others were arrested after 
allegedly firing a BB gun at a group of youngsters trick-or-treating in Santa 
Clarita Park, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
A 15-year-old Saugus boy and a 17-year-old Encino youth were arrested on 
suspicion of assault and weapons possession, Sheriff's Lt. William Bengtson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The youths, whose names were not released because they are juveniles, were 
turned over to their parents. 
</P>
<P>
Officers were patrolling in the 27000 block of Sycamore Creek Drive at 8:20 
p.m. when they were flagged down by a teen-ager who said two youths had fired 
at the group, Bengtson said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers found a gray BMW carrying the two suspects and confiscated a 
pellet rifle, a BB gun and a set of nunchakus, a martial-arts weapon. 
</P>
<P>
A 15-year-old girl suffered a welt on her hip and a 13-year-old boy was hit on 
the shoulder.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS; 
</P>
<P>
JOHNNY ROCKETS LAUNCHES TASTY TRIP BACK TO THE '50S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Can a dribble of hot hamburger grease thaw a frozen stream of memories? 
</P>
<P>
You bet. A party of four recently took simultaneous bites of the big, greasy, 
glorious burgers griddle-fried at La Jolla's new Johnny Rockets, snatched paper 
napkins from a dispenser to wipe their chins, sighed and exclaimed -- in 
perfect unison, no less -- "It tastes like high school!" 
</P>
<P>
Two members of the group attended high school in Bakersfield in the 1950s; the 
third and fourth were both '60s grads from the Midwest. But, despite the 
differences in ages and regions, each member felt that taking a bite of these 
burgers was like reading a stack of yearbooks and recalling all the live action 
that went into those photos. 
</P>
<P>
For a hamburger to be endowed with such mnemonic power is impressive. But there 
it was, the meat crusted to hold in all those juices, the topping an evocative 
mix of lettuce, tomato, mustard, pickles, mayonnaise, pickle relish and chopped 
onion. Almost every drive-in and burger joint in America served a product just 
like this until the tidal wave of franchised fast-food joints swept real 
drive-ins and burger joints from the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Rockets is itself a franchise operation, though a small one; besides 
several other outlets in California, there are Johnny Rockets in Chicago, 
Atlanta and Tokyo. Locally, the La Jolla location is joined by a place in Del 
Mar, with plans for a third in Pacific Beach. 
</P>
<P>
If Johnny Rockets is staging a burger revival, it is doing so in the largely 
palatable guise of a 1950s malt shop. The La Jolla Rockets, tucked away at the 
rear of Wall Street Plaza, announces itself with a low rumble of rock 'n' roll 
and a massive neon sign that bears not only the restaurant's name but also the 
legend "The Original Hamburger." 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Rockets' burger is not the original, in truth, but it at least tastes 
like the '50s incarnation. (Theories abound as to where this rather obvious 
sandwich began, with some credence given to the claims of Louis' Lunch, a 
counter not far from the Yale campus in New Haven.) 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Rockets' setting is ideal. Although the thirty-something-and-up crowd 
probably will prefer the umbrella-shaded tables in the court in front of Johnny 
Rockets, the restaurant's interior is a faithful and not too kitschy 
re-creation of a period malt shop, or a study in white tile, linoleum and 
aluminum. None of the cheesy smarminess of the would-be '50s-style diners 
around town has rubbed off on this place. There are but two booths (one is 
labeled the "double-date booth"). The rest of the seating is at the counter, 
which not only offers a full view of the action progressing on the sheet-metal 
grill, but is studded with nickel-snatching music selectors tied into the 
restaurant's jukebox. 
</P>
<P>
To a large degree, it is the jukebox that makes the courtyard seating so 
attractive because the tables are farther from the speakers. But, although the 
volume is sometimes too high, the tunes are on target: Customers play a lot of 
Sam Cooke and also lean toward "Peggy Sue," "The Rambler," "Mack the Knife" and 
even, in weak moments, "You Ain't Nothin' but a Hound Dog." Just don't look for 
anything from the 1960s on the jukebox menu. 
</P>
<P>
"You get into a gray area with the '60s," said proprietor Charlie Yao, who 
makes all the musical decisions here. "The '60s aren't really rock 'n' roll." 
</P>
<P>
The menu, served through the day, is simplicity itself. It recites merely a few 
hamburger variations: chili; french fries (for an extra $1.30 you can have the 
fries drowned in chili, if you wish); malts, shakes, floats and flavored Cokes, 
and a sextet of sandwiches. This last category ranges from an extraordinarily 
prosaic Swiss cheese with lettuce to a rather more enticing grilled cheese, to 
tuna salad, egg salad, grilled chicken breast (how unforgivingly 1990s it seems 
in this setting!) and a rather lovely bacon, lettuce and tomato. That's it, 
except for the apple and cherry pies, which are catered by an outside supplier. 
</P>
<P>
The burger mentioned above, which arrives wrapped in supposedly grease-proof 
paper (don't bet on it) for easier eating, is dubbed "The Original." The 12 
(the menu makes no mention of 1 through 11) embellishes this with a slice of 
Tillamook Cheddar cheese and a drizzle of the restaurant's trademarked "red red 
sauce," a spicy seasoner. Other variations can be achieved by adding an extra 
patty, or grilled onions, or a fried egg (this garnish is in fact quite popular 
in France), or chili, or, most deliciously, slices of just-fried bacon. 
</P>
<P>
Everything is cooked to order. The french fries are just french fries, but they 
are good and hot -- and capable of producing stifled howls of mirth when the 
waiter, as if he were a sardonic sommelier, seriocomically pours a little 
ketchup on each diner's paper plate. The BLT, served on whole wheat toast, is 
delicious for the simple fact of its freshness; the toast and bacon are hot and 
crisp, the lettuce and tomato cold and crisp. This is, in its way, an elegant 
juxtaposition. 
</P>
<P>
French fries usually arrive in advance of the burgers and sandwiches, as if 
they were some sort of appetizer. Malts and shakes, on the other hand, can be 
drunk with the meal or treated as dessert. They certainly fill the latter role 
quite well because the ratio of ice cream to milk is such that these only can 
be consumed efficiently with a spoon. Depending upon one's age, these are or 
are not large enough to share.

FORESTER SISTERS KEEP SINGING SAME SWEET SONG;

The Forester Sisters don't give two hoots about being hip. Instead of jumping 
on the "new traditionalist" bandwagon that's the rage in country music circles, 
they're singing the same mushy stuff they always have, with the same sweet, 
melt-in-your mouth vocal harmonies of such celebrated "sister" singing groups 
of the past like the Andrews Sisters and the McGuire Sisters. 
</P>
<P>
And, when they were asked by the Nashville Network to do a cable television 
series, projecting a sexy, slinky image was the farthest thing from their 
minds. Instead, they'll be hosting a cooking show, which is scheduled to launch 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be on the air every day, and we'll be cooking recipes from all 
across the United States," said Kathy Forester, 35, the oldest of the four 
sisters -- the others are June, 33, Kim, 30, and Christy, 28. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to tie it in with post cards from each area. I know it might sound 
strange, but we really do cook and enjoy doing that. It's something we've been 
doing all our lives, even before we started singing." 
</P>
<P>
An image that would get you nowhere in rock 'n' roll appears to be tailor-made 
for country music. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, the Forester Sisters, who will appear Sunday night at Leo's Little 
Bit O' Country in San Marcos, have topped the national country singles charts 
more than a dozen times. In 1986, the Academy of Country Music named them the 
"Top Vocal Group" of the year. 
</P>
<P>
And yet straight country is only a small part of a diverse repertoire that runs 
the gamut from lush pop to Western swing and even gospel. 
</P>
<P>
"I reckon that when you have four girls involved who all grew up listening to 
different things, it's definitely going to have an influence on you," Kathy 
Forester said. "We've always enjoyed the harmonies of the Andrew Sisters and 
the McGuire Sisters, and some of us like to listen to pop and even jazz. 
</P>
<P>
"And you can't listen to as much of it as we listened to and not be influenced. 
I think country radio just has a thing for families, which we are, and harmony 
singing, which we do." 
</P>
<P>
The Forester Sisters were born, raised, and still live on Lookout Mountain, 
Ga., about 20 miles outside Chattanooga, Tenn. They grew up surrounded by 
music, but had to be goaded into singing by their mom, Kathy Forester recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very musical community, and we grew up thinking everywhere was like 
that, where most families have instruments of some sort in their homes and 
everybody could sing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"And, being kids, we wanted to do different things; we never wanted to sing. 
Our mother is the one who got us into it -- when we got home from school, she'd 
tell us, 'You've got to sing Sunday morning in church, so you better get 
something ready.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Only after we went away to college and found out this was not the norm -- that 
not every place was so musical -- did we realize how fortunate we had been. And 
that's when we started singing again -- this time, because we wanted to, not 
because we had to." 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, after Kathy and June had graduated from college and become 
teachers, Kim and Christy interrupted their own college educations so the four 
could make an all-out effort to sing professionally. 
</P>
<P>
"We had been trying to do two things at once -- music and our careers, our 
educations -- and neither one was getting enough attention," Kathy Forester 
recalled. "So we decided to actively pursue the music business for two years 
and then, if we didn't make any headway, forget it and go on with our lives." 
</P>
<P>
With a backup band, the four sisters began playing clubs and music festivals 
around the South. 
</P>
<P>
"We just started learning and singing things we liked, the Flying Burrito 
Brothers, the Eagles, Emmylou Harris, and, at one club we were singing in, we 
began to draw an audience," Forester said. 
</P>
<P>
"In December of 1983 we went into Muscle Shoals and recorded a demonstration 
tape. Somehow, it got into the hands of the people at Warners Brothers Records; 
they liked it, called us, we auditioned for them, and they signed us -- just 
like that. 
</P>
<P>
"And it's funny, because within a year of our decision to take music seriously, 
we had a contract, which is very rare in this business." 
</P>
<P>
Success came quickly for the Forester Sisters. Their first single, "That's What 
You Do When You're in Love," was released in late 1984 and promptly rocketed 
into the Top 10 of the national country charts. 
</P>
<P>
The sisters were surprised, Kathy Forester recalled -- and so was their record 
company. 
</P>
<P>
"The people at the label told us that our first song would probably go into the 
60s and then fall out, because that's what most new records do," she said. "So 
it went into the 60s, and we were waiting for it to drop, but instead, it went 
into the 50s, then the 40s, and on up until it finally hit No. 10 -- and they 
were as shocked as we were." 
</P>
<P>
The hits kept coming: "I Fell In Love Again Last Night," "Just In Case," 
"Mama's Never Seen Those Eyes," "(I'd Choose) You Again," and "Too Much Is Not 
Enough" -- the latter, a collaboration with the Bellamy Brothers -- are among 
the biggest.

Under the credits of Charles Burnett's pungent and richly comic drama, "To 
Sleep With Anger" (at the Park Theater in San Diego), Gideon, the patriarch of 
his family, sits heavily on a chair, an old photograph of his mother behind 
him, a bowl of fruit on the table beside him. Suddenly tongues of flame envelop 
the fruit. As he gazes at us, twiddling his thumbs, more flames seem to lick 
out from Gideon's vest and from the soles of his shoes. With these magical 
images, Burnett warns us: His story may have a conventional setting but don't 
be deceived. 
</P>
<P>
With his third feature, Burnett turns storyteller, reaching into myths and 
superstitions, suggesting that Danny Glover's Harry Mention is something more 
than an insinuating old friend come to visit, that he may be a demon or the 
soul of the sharecropper South . . . or an old friend come to visit. 
</P>
<P>
His boyhood friends are Gideon (Paul Butler) and his wife Suzie (Mary Alice), 
who may at first glance look like one of television's idealized black 
middle-class families, well down the ladder from Bill Cosby's well-off doctor, 
up a bit from Sanford and Son's junk dealers. Don't expect comic one-liners 
here, though; writer-director Burnett's family is rooted and real and so is his 
intimate knowledge of their South-Central Los Angeles community. What he adds 
is a story-teller's flair, a poet's ear for speech and the almost mystical 
vision that infused his first two features, "Killer of Sheep" and "My Brother's 
Wedding." 
</P>
<P>
Gideon, who's been almost every kind of laborer, is now retired; soft-spoken 
Suzie, who has the tensile strength of steel, gives natural childbirth classes 
out of their house. Unexpectedly, her traditional skills of midwifery are in 
demand again with young, hip couples, black and white. In this solid, 
family-worn two-story house they have raised two sons, Junior and Babe Brother, 
now both married. Gideon's vegetable garden and his chickens are out back; from 
next door come the sounds of the 7-year-old's trumpet practice. The noise 
suggests that Wynton Marsalis can rest easy for a while, but even this racket 
carries with it a sense of continuity and acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
The sons and their wives are different from each other as chalk and cheese. 
Bearded Junior (Carl Lumbly) and his pregnant wife Pat (Vonetta McGee), who 
works for the city's poor and homeless, are as warm and closely knit as their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
Weakling second son Babe Brother (Richard Brooks), a loan officer, and his 
realtor-wife Linda (Sheryl Lee Ralph) are quintessential buppies, to whom 
Gideon and Suzie's ways are hopelessly old-fashioned. Linda declines even to 
come inside her in-laws' house, since no one will be talking about anything 
that interests her. It doesn't keep them, however, from parking their little 
boy Sonny with his grandparents constantly, so that these young parents can be 
with friends more to their liking. 
</P>
<P>
All this is disrupted the day the smiling, perspiring Harry Mention appears at 
the family door on his way, he says, to Oakland. Originally from the Old South, 
he's steeped in Old Country courtliness -- and superstitions. Inadvertently, 
young Sonny keeps Harry at bay by touching his feet with a broom, an act with 
dire consequences to the deeply superstitious. 
</P>
<P>
Instantly welcomed, Harry takes over like kudzu. The family sees only one side; 
we see Harry going through their photographs, their drawers, their sugar bowl 
when they're at church. Humbly, he prefers a pallet on the floor to the bed 
they offer; soon his long-winded cronies have the run of the house. In spite of 
his Spartan ways, his talk about knowing his place, his tainted praise for 
everyone's achievements, Harry seems to be the master of mischief. In his wake, 
the already-fragile family splinters dangerously. 
</P>
<P>
The first person to see through him completely is the devoutly "born-again" 
Hattie (Ethyl Ayler), a beauty whom he knew in her wilder days. Harry takes 
malevolent pleasure in reminding her of those days, suggesting how easily -- 
and how pleasurably -- she could slip back into them. 
</P>
<P>
Although mystery is part of Harry's aura, we're never quite sure of his powers, 
or even if he has any. It makes us worry when weaklings like Babe Brother fall 
in with him; on the other hand, it gives a delicious sense of comeuppance to 
the scene in which the serene Suzie speaks her mind to him. If Harry is a 
mythic force, he's a strangely vulnerable one. 
</P>
<P>
Glover gets straight down into the soul of Harry with a generous, brilliantly 
detailed performance, never over by so much as one broom straw. It's his best 
character since "Places in the Heart" and one that gives him far more to play; 
as he casts light on every corner of Harry's soul, Glover creates gradations 
from obsequiousness to lordliness to mocking insinuation. 
</P>
<P>
He is joined by a ferociously good cast, and although all of them are 
wonderful, Paul Butler, Mary Alice and the forthright Ethyl Ayler seem to stand 
out. 
</P>
<P>
When he is putting small, perfect touches on seemingly minor characters like 
Hattie or Harry's bandy-legged, feisty cronies, like Okra Tate, Burnett's 
writing is rich and briskly unexpected. It becomes shockingly hilarious in the 
movie's final scenes, as the brisk wind of farce blows through the film, 
scouring away all demons. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Burnett has been Los Angeles' open secret since 1977 with "Killer of 
Sheep," his hauntingly empathetic black-and-white study of a slaughter-house 
worker. The film was among 25 titles selected last week for protection as film 
treasures in the Library of Congress. In the interim, Burnett has painstakingly 
crafted his unique portraits of the immediate world around him; writing, 
directing, sometimes photographing them himself ("sex, lies, and videotape's" 
Walt Lloyd was his splendid cameraman here). 
</P>
<P>
"To Sleep With Anger" (rated PG) is Burnett's first film with all-professional 
actors, his first color feature and his first film to receive major 
distribution. Among its other virtues, it seems to reaffirm William Faulkner's 
soft-spoken sentiment that one's own ground can be the richest, most 
inexhaustible soil possible.

ENGAGING FALK PROVIDES LIFT FOR A WEARYING 'TUNE IN TOMORROW' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Movies about the fine line between reality and fantasy are usually arty, 
self-conscious horrors. "Tune In Tomorrow . . ." isn't in that category. Its 
faults are of a reverse sort; it makes so little of the mystery of the 
reality-fantasy interchange that it comes across like a great big rambunctious 
cartoon. Fantasy knocks reality out of the box. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the 1977 Mario Vargas Llosa novel "Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter," 
the film is about what happens when a dotty, inspired radio writer named Pedro 
Carmichael (Peter Falk) is hired by WXBU, "the Voice of New Orleans," to spark 
its low-rated soap-opera. This he does, and, in the process, sparks the lives 
of his co-workers -- specifically the 21-year-old Martin (Keanu Reeves), an 
aspiring radio writer who is in love with Julia (Barbara Hershey), his 
35-year-old, twice-divorced aunt by marriage. 
</P>
<P>
The film's scenario whittles down Vargas Llosa's narrative, in which real-life 
chapters alternated with Pedro's soapsuds fantasies. The film settles on one of 
Pedro's plot lines: a complicated story compounding adultery, incest, mistaken 
identity -- the works. (Such well-known faces as Henry Gibson, John 
Larroquette, Dan Hedaya, Hope Lange, Elizabeth McGovern and Peter Gallagher 
turn up in this story line.) 
</P>
<P>
The film's not-too-subtle conceit is that the romantic entanglements of Martin 
and Julia inspire Pedro's perfervid imagination; he sets up liaisons between 
them and then, employing various disguises ranging from charwoman to rabbi, 
eavesdrops on their dialogue, which then ends up in his radio drama, 
influencing the couple's real-life affair. 
</P>
<P>
For Pedro, writing isn't just a job, it's a mission. When he directs the actors 
in the radio studio, he whips them into a frenzy to match his own. "I want your 
souls to enter the microphones," he says, and he means it literally. Pedro may 
appear to be a hack, but, in the film's terms, he is also the soul of creation. 
His soaps are low-grade but they're entertaining as hell; they fulfill the 
first requirement of any story -- we want to know what happens next. 
</P>
<P>
And Pedro goes a step further; he uses his dramas as a way of making reality 
happen. At one time or another all writers probably feel like they're playing 
God. Pedro actively courts godliness. He's the writer as cosmic matchmaker. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro's antics are more entertaining than the soap opera that we see, or even 
Julia and Martin's budding romance. The soap sequences are lively camp but 
they're overblown; even though the film (throughout San Diego County) is set in 
1951, the scenes have the floridness of some of the more batty episodes of 
"Dallas" or "Dynasty." A more straightforward approach to these sequences might 
have worked better. Jon Amiel, who directed from a script by William Boyd, 
doesn't seem to recognize that soaps already contain a built-in component of 
self-satire. He overdoes what was overdone to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
Keanu Reeves has some problems with his New Orleans accent, but he has a 
breezy, engaging presence and a winning, hangdog lyricism whenever his 
love-struck Martin is moping about the beloved Julia. Barbara Hershey makes his 
love for her believable. Although born in New Orleans, she's currently a New 
York refugee, and we can see how her brittle, citified ways might stir him up. 
</P>
<P>
Julia's tough-gal cynicism is pretty transparent, though, and Martin spots her 
frailty. It's what finally wins her over to him. Hershey is one of those 
comparatively few performers whose talents have deepened with age. Julia isn't 
a major role, but Hershey attacks it as if it were. This is the same actress 
who was so extraordinary in "A World Apart" and, on television, "A Killing in a 
Small Town." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Falk has a small field day as Pedro. Even though his scenes are scaled to 
be funnier than they actually are, he sashays into his multiple roles with 
glee. But Amiel doesn't encourage him to bring out the nightmarish quality in 
the changeovers, the way, in "Lolita," Kubrick and Peter Sellers collaborated 
to bring out the creepiness in Nabokov's Clare Quilty. (That's still probably 
the greatest multiple-personality performance ever.) The film is so resolutely 
jokey that Falk never has a chance to demonstrate the scary potential in 
Pedro's cosmic matchmaking. 
</P>
<P>
Vargas Llosa's novel, which was set in Lima, Peru, and based on his own early, 
scandalous marriage to his aunt, had a denser, more mysterious texture. "Tune 
In Tomorrow . . ." (rated PG-13) is a gagster's movie, and, like most gag 
fests, you sit back and sort out the good skits from the bad. You learn to 
settle for less. 
</P>

PATHE CLOSES LONG-DELAYED MGM/UA DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON and MICHAEL CIEPLY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hollywood's historic film studio MGM/UA Communications Co. was acquired 
Thursday by Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti in a patchwork deal valued at 
$1.36 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The terms of the oft-delayed buyout were not revealed, but Parretti's Pathe 
Communications Corp. reportedly put the deal together with a complex package of 
loans and advances. The new company, the third major Hollywood studio to be 
controlled by foreign interests, will be named MGM-Pathe Communications Co. 
</P>
<P>
"Ha! . . . Bravo for him," said company spokeswoman Arlene Cattani of 
Parretti's success in completing the deal that skeptics had contended would 
never be done. MGM/UA marked the deal, eight months in the making and the 
subject of several lawsuits, by delivering a live, 400-pound lion to Parretti's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
The buyout puts a wrap on the 21-year reign of MGM/UA majority shareholder Kirk 
Kerkorian, who had tried to sell the studio for two years. Kerkorian made $996 
million from the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving MGM/UA "saddens me a lot," Kerkorian told The Times shortly before the 
deal closed. He acknowledged that the company was in a weak competitive 
position against bigger media conglomerates such as Sony Corp. and its Columbia 
Pictures subsidiary. "You've got to be in hardware today, you've got to be in 
satellites, you've got to be in manufacturing home videocassettes and in 
theaters. That's what it's all about these days," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Parretti, whose conquest was set back several times by false starts and funding 
problems, assumes the title of co-chairman and chief executive at MGM-Pathe. 
His longtime business partner, Florio Fiorini, will serve as co-chairman. 
Rounding out the troika is former Cannon Group boss Yorum Globus, who will be 
president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
Parretti said, in a prepared statement, that he will develop the kind of 
product that has made the MGM name "legendary for generations." But MGM is 
hardly the titan of old. 
</P>
<P>
The company, best known for the roaring "Leo the Lion" logo that precedes its 
films, has captured only 1.4% of the domestic box office so far this year and 
has already been largely dismantled by Kerkorian, who sold the Culver City 
studio lot and the MGM film library. MGM produced such classics as "Gone With 
the Wind," "The Wizard of Oz" and, in the Kerkorian years, had occasional hits 
such as "Rain Man" and "Moonstruck." 
</P>
<P>
An MGM/UA spokeswoman said the logo would continue to be used exclusively by 
the company, adding that the logo will have no connection to the stylized lion 
logo used by Kerkorian's MGM Grand airline and hotel company. 
</P>
<P>
Pathe is expected to divulge its financing to the Securities and Exchange 
Commission by next week. So far, the company has said only that it will receive 
about $700 million of the purchase price from the sale of its assets to MGM/UA, 
which in turn has raised at least part of the money by selling long-term rights 
to the MGM/UA and Pathe film libraries. 
</P>
<P>
Turner Broadcasting System Inc. and Time Warner Inc. agreed to pay more than 
$325 million for certain rights over a period of more than 10 years. But it 
remained unclear who provided the balance of the $700 million or whether any 
banks assisted in the financing. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills-based Pathe has said that the balance of the funds came from 
transactions with European investors, which reportedly include Pathe 
affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Logsdon, an analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities in Los Angeles, said 
the MGM/UA acquisition "breaks all the records for investment banking 
ingenuity." Logsdon said it's highly likely that further MGM/UA assets will be 
sold to pay any debt that Parretti might have incurred. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly there's a financial mandate for de-leveraging, especially with these 
guys," Logsdon said. "Some assets have got to be sold and some movies have got 
to work. They could sell the TV division. It's not doing poorly at all. So 
they've got some latitude." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the instability caused by years of asset sales, MGM/UA has retained a 
presence in network television. It has four series on the networks, including 
"thirtysomething" and "The Young Riders," and is scheduled to reprise "Dark 
Shadows" for NBC early next year. MGM/UA also is developing a series for CBS 
based on the studio's "Pink Panther" movies. 
</P>
<P>
David Gerber, chairman of MGM/UA Television Productions Inc., said he was glad 
the sale was finally over. The corporate turmoil has taken its toll, he said, 
adding that "over the years, we've lost talent and had a hard time convincing 
the agents to work with us." 
</P>
<P>
Gerber said Parretti and MGM/UA Chief Executive Jeffrey Barbakow told him in 
recent meetings that the television division would not be sold. Parretti, said 
Gerber, "talked with a global understanding of where broadcasting has to go." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say MGM/UA's chances of remaining solvent may largely depend on the 
performance of the 11-picture film schedule that Pathe has developed. One top 
financial analyst, who asked that his name not be used, said MGM/UA will be 
even more pressured than other studios to come up with box-office winners. "If 
those pictures do not attract box-office success, you'd be looking at a 
severely wounded or impaired company," the analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
Pathe also must contend with lawsuits filed by two top producers, Alberto 
Grimaldi ("Last Tango in Paris") and the producers of the James Bond films, who 
contend that their profit participations will be sharply curtailed under the 
buyout. In his suit, Grimaldi has claimed that Pathe had sold rights to MGM/UA 
films to an array of foreign buyers, and has borrowed as much as $650 million 
against the contracts from Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland. Pathe is contesting 
the lawsuit but hasn't commented on the specific claim. 
</P>
<P>
Under an earlier plan, Pathe had raised a substantial portion of its buyout 
financing through short-term loans and advances that it expected to retire by 
selling $300 million or more in new common stock. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't clear whether any such plans lay behind the current buyout, although a 
new share offering would be extremely difficult in a market that has battered 
the stock of even such solid entertainment companies as Paramount 
Communications Corp. and Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
The merger represents a marriage of two companies that have been struggling. 
For the nine months ended May 31, MGM/UA posted a $32-million net loss. Pathe 
made a $1.3-million profit for the last six months before an extraordinary 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
While Pathe brings such upcoming films as "Russia House" to the table, the 
combined companies will now have to come up with millions of dollars to cover 
the cost of marketing those films, as well as a bare minimum of $100 million to 
produce even a modest slate of big studio-quality movies over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Pathe representatives have said they expect to have ample funding to produce 
and market films, largely from existing bank credit lines. But they haven't 
detailed future film plans. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Ladd Jr., a 52-year-old film veteran and Pathe's current film chief, will 
head movie-making operations for the combined companies. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Berger, who has headed MGM/UA's film operation since Ladd quit in a 
falling out with Kerkorian two years ago, said he wasn't sure if he would 
remain with the company. "Laddie's said they'd like to find a place for me. But 
I don't know," Berger said in a telephone interview after the merger was 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
Berger said he expected staff cuts of 100 employees in MGM/UA's home video unit 
and other cuts in the film production staff. But he said the marketing and 
distribution departments might actually expand to handle the dozen or so films 
Pathe has produced and now expects to release through MGM/UA. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very sad for a lot of people. They're not going to have jobs. . . . 
The business is contracting," Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
In the last several years, the film industry has seen Tri-Star Pictures and 
Columbia Pictures combined into Sony's Columbia Pictures Entertainment, and the 
collapse of independent movie companies such as the Lorimar Telepictures film 
unit and Weintraub Entertainment Group. 
</P>
<P>
Pathe was formed in 1989 when various European companies controlled by Parretti 
and Fiorini took control of what was then known as Cannon Group. Cannon had 
long produced low-budget films and made a largely unsuccessful attempt to 
produce big-star vehicles under its top executives, Globus and Menachem Golan. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA's sale has been contemplated for years. The Australian-based Qintex 
Group agreed to buy the studio for $1.5 billion last year. The deal fell apart, 
however, when Qintex was un able to secure financing. Qintex was subsequently 
forced to file for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Turner Broadcasting System purchased MGM/UA for $1.5 billion in 1986 but 
immediately sold back most of the company to Kerkorian, keeping the MGM film 
library for use on his cable television services. 
</P>
<P>
Kerkorian declined to say what he plans to do with his share of the proceeds 
from the sale, though it is widely assumed that he will use it to build his 
planned Las Vegas casino and theme park. "Whatever it is, we have to wait and 
see," he said.

WAR FOES: A MATTER OF FAMILY; 
</P>
<P>
UNLIKE DURING THE VIETNAM WAR, ANTI-WAR ACTIVISTS ARE NOW LIKELY TO COME FROM 
MAIN STREET. THE FATHER OF A MARINE IN THE GULF IS THEIR FOLK HERO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the Vietnam War, Bill White flew 136 reconnaissance missions -- just a 
few more than his father-in-law had in World War II. And when his own son and 
daughter also enlisted, White became the proud patriarch of a third-generation 
Air Force family. 
</P>
<P>
But last month, after his children were sent to the Middle East as part of the 
U.S. deployment in the Persian Gulf, White became an unlikely anti-war 
activist. Over the past few weeks, the Texas attorney has taken a 
front-and-center position in the nation's reawakening anti-war movement -- 
coaxing friends to help oppose any U.S. offensive against Iraq and coming to 
Washington to buttonhole congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
"Vietnam was a meaningless war -- it got us nothing, and I don't want to see 
the same thing happen again," says White, who is now a county prosecutor in San 
Antonio. "I don't want my kids -- or anybody else's -- to come back in a box." 
</P>
<P>
In vocally opposing any U.S. offensive against Iraq, White has given the 
anti-war movement a little-noticed, but distinctly different face from the 
peace movement of old. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, many of the visages in the still-fledgling anti-war movement are 
familiar: Ramsey Clark, the anti-war attorney general of the Lyndon B. Johnson 
Administration; Daniel Ellsberg, the Nixon-era activist who leaked the Pentagon 
Papers during the Vietnam War, and Ron Kovic, the Vietnam hero-turned-activist 
who wrote the autobiographical "Born on the Fourth of July." 
</P>
<P>
But the makeup of today's crop of anti-war activists is different: Unlike the 
Vietnam War era, there are relatively few college students in the group -- 
partly because there no longer is any military draft, and they are not as 
threatened by today's call-up. Instead, they have been replaced by several 
thousand family members of military personnel who are stationed in the Persian 
Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a really new, different element -- the military families are raising 
doubts because almost nobody else is," says Ira Shorr, program director of 
SANE/FREEZE, a peace group that got its start in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, with polls showing President Bush enjoying widespread public 
support for his Persian Gulf deployment policies, the impact of these new 
anti-war activists has been relatively modest so far. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the incipient grass-roots anti-war groups have been holding teach-ins 
at college campuses across the country, but the response has been less than 
spectacular. "There's been some interest, but not much," concedes Jim Driscoll, 
head of Operation Real Security, a Tempe, Ariz.-based anti-war organization. 
</P>
<P>
But advocates insist their numbers -- and influence -- are beginning to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Every Saturday since late August, several dozen demonstrators have been holding 
silent vigils in front of the White House -- much to the puzzlement of passing 
tourists. And just outside the Westover Air Force Base in Chicopee, Mass., the 
main staging area in New England for cargo flights to Saudi Arabia, 
demonstrators have been staging rallies that the base commander has called 
"weekly outbursts of lawlessness." 
</P>
<P>
In late September, representatives of more than 130 grass-roots groups met at 
New York's Riverside Church, a bastion of anti-war activity in the 1960s and 
early '70s, and formed a coalition to coordinate the nationwide Oct. 20 
demonstrations, which drew several thousand people to rallies in more than a 
dozen cities around the country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appeal to Congress 
</P>
<P>
What people such as White are demanding is a peaceful resolution to the current 
standoff. They say they don't want their loved ones to die in what they 
characterize as an undeclared war for cheap gasoline. And they are calling for 
Congress to hold a special session after the election to examine U.S. policies 
in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"Now is the time to have an open debate and see where our objectives are," 
White asserts. "Let's support the troops, but question the policy." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most visible of the new protesters has been Alex Molnar, a 
University of Wisconsin professor with a 21-year-old son in the Marine Corps. 
Molnar was vacationing with his wife, Barbara, when Iraq invaded Kuwait. A few 
days later, an express letter arrived saying their son had been ordered to 
Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Moved by the anger that welled inside him as their son prepared to join the 
deployment, Molnar wrote a letter to the President, which eventually was 
published as an Op-Ed column in the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
"The Reagan-Bush Administration rolled into Washington talking about the magic 
of a 'free market' in oil," the letter said. "You diluted gas mileage 
requirements for cars and dismantled federal energy policy. And now you have 
ordered my son to the Middle East. For what? Cheap gas?" Molnar wrote. "If, as 
I expect, you eventually order American soldiers to attack Iraq, then it is God 
who will have to forgive you," he concluded. "I will not." 
</P>
<P>
The impact was stunning, turning Molnar into a leader of the anti-war movement 
virtually overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a helluva piece, and Alex became an instant folk hero," says Maurice 
Paprin, president of the Fund for New Priorities, an organization that opposes 
U.S. action in the gulf. The fund immediately began distributing Molnar's 
column all over the country and made it the centerpiece of more than $50,000 
worth of national newspaper advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
Within weeks, the ads had brought in enough money to finance the opening of a 
storefront headquarters for the new Military Families Support Network, made up 
of relatives of service personnel stationed in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
And Molnar himself has received thousands of letters and hundreds of telephone 
calls -- forcing him to buy two additional phone lines, an answering service, a 
fax machine and a personal computer. The callers, writers and volunteers are 
"as red-white-and-blue as you can get," Molnar says. "This is Main Street 
America," he exults. 
</P>
<P>
Molnar describes the situation as "very different" from Vietnam War protests. 
</P>
<P>
"We support and love the troops," he says. "Let nobody claim we don't. They'd 
better not dare." 
</P>
<P>
As might be expected, the military families have been quickly embraced by more 
veteran peace activists, and groups such as SANE/FREEZE, based in Washington, 
and the New York-based Fund for New Priorities in America, who say they are 
heartened by the new movement, small as it may be now. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Oct. 20 demonstrators were many Vietnam War veterans, including Ron 
Kovic, who spoke in Los Angeles. "These are people who see this as kind of 
re-living their nightmares -- but this time for their little brothers or sons," 
said Larry Korb, a former assistant secretary of defense for manpower from 
1981-85. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the movement has drawn support from a hodgepodge of other activist 
groups, including some environmental groups -- which see the Middle East crisis 
as a rare opportunity to preach the gospel of conservation and renewable energy 
sources -- and civil rights organizations, which are demanding that the 
government spend less on the military and more for housing, education and other 
domestic needs. 
</P>
<P>
Ellsberg, for one, is unconcerned by the limited response to the anti-war 
effort so far. "The turnouts are much larger than at a comparable stage in the 
Vietnam War," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The wheelchair-bound Kovic agrees. "People are moving much more quickly on this 
than in the '60s. It comes from a deep understanding of what war is," he says. 
"I feel very close to our soldiers there. I know what they are going through, 
what it means to be homesick, to be in a dangerous situation, to wonder whether 
you're going to come home alive -- and to wonder whether or not you should be 
there." 
</P>
<P>
But some who have watched the reaction of Vietnam veterans to the situation in 
the Persian Gulf say it's clear that the U.S. deployment there has reopened 
some deep psychological scars from the Southeast Asian war -- the mixed and 
often conflicting emotions that have stayed with Vietnam-era GIs through the 
1970s and 1980s. Shad Meshad, head of the Los Angeles-based Vietnam Veterans' 
Aid Foundation, says some seem almost wistful about Operation Desert Shield, 
allowing that they might like to go fight in a military action that this time 
has broad support at home. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard the whole gamut of responses -- from demanding a total pullout to 
wanting to get back into a war that people will feel good about," he says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Families Form Core 
</P>
<P>
Still, the strongest component of the new peace movement is the relatives of 
soldiers now stationed in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a stake in this more than the average citizen," explains Judy 
Davenport, 39, a Goose Creek, S.C., woman whose husband is on a U.S. warship in 
the Persian Gulf area. "We want people to support the troops -- no matter what. 
But we also want a pledge from the President that this will not turn into an 
offensive action." 
</P>
<P>
As might be expected, having the military families protesting the deployment 
has not always gone without criticism. Detractors of the anti-war demonstrators 
readily remind them that, unlike the case during the Vietnam era, their loved 
ones freely volunteered for military service. Even if they joined the military 
to acquire job skills, as today's recruiting posters promise, surely they knew 
they could be called upon to go to war. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough thing to say, but that's the bottom line," says Robert E. 
Wallace, a former Vietnam veteran who now is national senior vice 
commander-in-chief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. 
</P>
<P>
But Molnar is undeterred by such arguments. "Yes, most of them did enlist to 
acquire job skills and other opportunities," he concedes. "But so what? So 
their lives are worth nothing? So they can be sent anywhere for any cause?" 
</P>
<P>
"The people who are going to protect the troops this time are the families," 
Molnar asserts. 
</P>
<P>
And the Fund for New Priorities' Paprin contends that the participation of the 
military families makes the anti-war message even stronger. "This is a very 
different element," he says. "It's not just a protest or peace movement coming 
from an ideological base. It's a new source of energy." 
</P>
<P>
To some protesters, such as Texas' Bill White, the solution is to force Bush to 
obtain approval from Congress before launching any serious offensive. "It took 
a declaration of war to send John Kennedy and George Bush to the Pacific," he 
says, "and it should take another one to send our children to the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
White describes his gradual conversion since the United States responded to the 
Iraqi invasion: "When Desert Shield began, I was not opposed to it -- I'm as 
offended by what Saddam Hussein did as anyone," he says. "But it's now a horse 
of a different color. It's turning out to be offensive in character. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's think this thing through. Now is the time to get the approval of the 
people. Sooner or later, people will be heard. You can ask them now or you can 
ask them later." 
</P>
<P>
Role Still Unclear 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, it's unclear just how far the new anti-war movement will get -- 
or even whether it will take off as a major force in debate over U.S. policy in 
the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of Protestant and Roman Catholic leaders, including the 
presiding bishop of President Bush's Episcopalian denomination, have questioned 
whether the continuing military buildup is wise. 
</P>
<P>
And Bill White and his fellow war protesters are certain that their cause will 
gain a broader base of adherents as the United States edges closer to war. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the anti-Vietnam War movement of a generation ago, White says, today's 
protesters wholeheartedly support the 210,000 GIs in the gulf. "Then, we 
started out approving the policy and wound up condemning our troops. Let's not 
let that happen again," he asserts.

PROPOSITION WITH MOST VOTES WOULD NULLIFY RIVAL ONE; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTIONS: THE STATE SUPREME COURT RULING PERMITS EXCEPTIONS WHEN CONFLICTS ARE 
MINOR. IT MAY AFFECT SEVEN MEASURES ON TUESDAY'S BALLOT.

<TEXT>
<P>
In a far-reaching ruling that could affect several initiatives on Tuesday's 
election ballot, the state Supreme Court said Thursday that when voters approve 
fundamentally conflicting measures, no part of the one receiving fewer votes 
may take effect. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling set important new guidelines that could resolve conflicts arising 
from the growing trend of competing ballot measures. The state Constitution 
says that when provisions of voter-approved initiatives conflict, those of the 
measure receiving the higher vote take precedence. But left unresolved was 
whether any parts of a measure with fewer votes could be salvaged as 
reconcilable with a measure with more votes. 
</P>
<P>
The justices held that when two such initiatives were presented to voters as 
"all-or-nothing" alternatives -- or create a "comprehensive regulatory scheme" 
on the same subject -- only the provisions of the measure that won more votes 
can be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
The decision could affect as many as seven initiatives on Tuesday's ballot that 
could be considered in overall conflict, meaning that any of the measures 
passed with fewer votes would be invalidated. 
</P>
<P>
But the court also said that two conflicting propositions could survive if the 
conflicts were only "minor." The measure with fewer votes would take effect 
without the conflicting provision. 
</P>
<P>
Some legal experts said the ruling leaves it unclear what would happen if 
voters approve propositions that clash on one significant issue, but also 
contain major provisions that are not in conflict. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Propositions 131 and 140 on Tuesday's ballot conflict because they 
would impose different term limits for office holders. But Proposition 131 also 
calls for public campaign financing while Proposition 140 would limit the 
Legislature's operating budget and eliminate its retirement system. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's action came in a 5-2 decision in which the court struck down 
voter-approved limits on legislative campaign contributions and a ban on 
off-year fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
The court invalidated the remaining portions of Proposition 68, a campaign 
finance initiative passed in the June, 1988, election with 53% of the vote. 
Because a rival measure, Proposition 73, won 58% of the vote, only its 
provisions could be enforced, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the contribution limits of Proposition 73 have been declared 
unconstitutional by a federal district judge. 
</P>
<P>
When the Supreme Court decision becomes final in 30 days, California will be 
left without any limits on campaign contributions -- even though voters passed 
two such measures two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's action by the state Supreme Court, combined with the earlier decision 
striking down Proposition 73's contribution limits, returns California politics 
to the law of the jungle," said Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, the leading sponsor of Proposition 131, urged voters to approve 
that measure, which would reinstate Proposition 68's provisions enacting 
contribution limits and public financing of campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
The state high court, in a majority opinion by Justice David N. Eagleson, 
refused to try to salvage parts of Proposition 68 that might still be 
reconciled with Proposition 73, the measure that received more votes. 
</P>
<P>
"Were the court to do so, the result might be a regulatory scheme created 
without any basis for ascertaining whether the electorate understood or 
intended the result," Eagleson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Dissenters Justice Joyce L. Kennard and Justice Allen E. Broussard criticized 
the majority for its "all-or-nothing" approach to the issue. In order to uphold 
the will of the voters, the court should examine the two measures, provision by 
provision, and reconcile them "to the greatest possible extent," Kennard wrote. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of propositions on Tuesday's ballot have conflicting sections, but 
some also contain language making it clear what provisions would remain in 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Proposition 126, an industry-sponsored measure that would impose a 
moderate increase on alcohol taxes, specifically seeks to wipe out Proposition 
134, which would raise alcohol taxes by a larger amount. 
</P>
<P>
And both initiatives affecting the state's logging practices -- the 
environmentalist-backed Proposition 130 and the timber industry-sponsored 
Proposition 138 -- say each would cancel out the other if it got more votes. 
</P>
<P>
Two sections of Proposition 128, the sweeping environmental measure called "Big 
Green" by supporters, also are targeted by other initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
If Proposition 138 receives more votes, it would invalidate Proposition 128's 
redwood preservation provisions. And Proposition 135, a pesticide regulation 
initiative sponsored by farmers, would negate the pesticide provisions of Big 
Green. But both of the counter-initiatives specifically state that they would 
not invalidate the remainder of Proposition 128. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp and other backers of Proposition 131 contend that most of their 
measure would take effect even if Proposition 140, with its conflicting term 
limits for elected officials, receives more votes. 
</P>
<P>
"The two initiatives conflict on only one point, and they have not been 
promoted to voters as all-or-nothing, alternative regulatory schemes," Van de 
Kamp told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum, the sponsor of Proposition 140, 
said the decision striking down Proposition 68 was "all the more reason for one 
or both of these (propositions) to be approved." 
</P>
<P>
Both Propositions 68 and 73 sought to impose broad changes in campaign fund 
raising -- setting limits on contributions, barring transfers of funds among 
candidates and restricting honorariums and gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 68, applying only to state legislative candidates, was backed by 
the League of Women Voters, Common Cause and Van de Kamp. Proposition 73, 
covering all candidates for state and local office, was sponsored by state Sen. 
Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier) -- who subsequently resigned and is serving a 6 
1/2-year prison term on federal corruption charges -- Sen. Quentin L. Kopp 
(I-San Francisco) and Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-Fullerton). 
</P>
<P>
Under the state Constitution, any conflicts in voter-approved initiatives are 
resolved in favor of the one that draws more votes. In this instance, some 
provisions were in clear conflict: Proposition 68, for example, allowed 
voluntary public funding for campaigns -- but Proposition 73 barred it. But 
backers of Proposition 68 contended that there were other parts of the measure 
that did not conflict with its rival and thus could take effect. 
</P>
<P>
The state Fair Political Practices Commission ruled that overall, the two 
measures were substantially conflicting and declared that only Proposition 73 
could take effect. 
</P>
<P>
But in August, 1989, a state Court of Appeal in Los Angeles compared the 
measures provision-by-provision and said that Proposition 68 contained some 
features that were "not in irreconcilable conflict" with Proposition 73 and 
could survive. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a separate case, U.S. District Judge Lawrence K. Karlton of 
Sacramento last September struck down the contribution limits and other 
portions of Proposition 73 as a violation of free speech rights. The ruling 
opened the way for local and statewide office-seekers -- such as gubernatorial 
candidates Pete Wilson and Dianne Feinstein -- to receive unlimited amounts of 
money in the campaign. But the judge reinstated the limits on contributions to 
legislative races while the ruling was appealed. 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's ruling, the high court refused to engage in what it called 
"judicial legislation" by trying to salvage parts of Proposition 68. There was 
no way to prove that because the voters approved both, they wanted both to take 
effect to the maximum extent possible, Eagleson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The court said that its ruling would not apply when "one or more minor 
provisions" of an initiative conflict with a measure that gets more votes. 
</P>
<P>
Eagleson's 40-page majority opinion was joined by Chief Justice Malcolm M. 
Lucas, Justice Edward A. Panelli and Appellate Justice Arleigh Woods, sitting 
temporarily by assignment. Justice Stanley Mosk concurred in the ruling 
striking down Proposition 68's provisions and warned that piecing together 
parts of two rival measures could create a "Frankenstein's monster whose 
existence the voters never contemplated."

CHARITY REACHES FOR STARS -- CRITICS SAY IT FALLS SHORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
Soon after AIDS patient Ryan White won his poignant battle to remain in public 
school in Indiana, a group called Athletes and Entertainers for Kids signed on 
as his national fund-raising arm. 
</P>
<P>
Together they became a potent force on the Hollywood charity circuit. 
</P>
<P>
The entertainment community turned out in droves in 1988 for a glitzy benefit 
at the Century Plaza Hotel headlined by pop star Elton John, with tickets going 
for as much as $2,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
In the following year, Athletes and Entertainers put on an equally spectacular 
fund-raiser honoring Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The tribute to the retiring 
basketball legend was broadcast on national television. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, former President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan attended an Academy Awards 
night party to benefit the charity. It also was White's last public appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Seven months since his death, White's name still appears on Athletes and 
Entertainers' fund-raising appeals, and his mother, Jeanne White, remains among 
its biggest boosters. But now the organization's achievements as well as its 
fiscal management are being called into question. 
</P>
<P>
John, who was at White's bedside during his final hours, has severed his ties 
to Athletes and Entertainers because a $25,000 donation he made to the charity 
for use by the White family was never turned over to them. 
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two camps soured even further last week when Athletes and 
Entertainers named John a recipient of its first annual Ryan White Memorial 
Award, without his advance knowledge. John's management said the singer does 
not want the award and will not attend the presentation ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
John is not the only one who has sought to distance himself from the charity. 
Two of the largest hospitals that specialize in treating youngsters, Los 
Angeles County-USC Medical Center and Childrens Hospital in Hollywood, have 
significantly curbed their dealings with Athletes and Entertainers, reportedly 
because of unkept promises by the charity. 
</P>
<P>
Athletes and Entertainers was also barred from raising funds in the city of Los 
Angeles for two months this year for failing to file required financial 
disclosure reports. The state attorney general's registry of charitable trusts 
cited the group in May for the same failure. 
</P>
<P>
Elise Kim, the group's founder and executive director, conceded in a recent 
interview that the charity has been guilty of some sloppy bookkeeping, but 
denied anything improper has occurred and said efforts are under way to improve 
the charity's management with the help of the Nissan Motor Corp. of America. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't done anything wrong," she said. "We take an incredible amount of 
pride in this charity and the things we are doing." 
</P>
<P>
Mathematical inconsistencies and apparent errors make it impossible to fully 
decipher Athletes and Entertainers' finances. The charity reported raising 
$465,426 in fiscal 1988-89, the last time it gave a financial accounting to 
authorities. After losses from two major events were subtracted, the group 
reportedly was left with $393,000 in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
About $108,000 went for charitable purposes, according to Athletes and 
Entertainers. Another $117,000 was used for expenses, and the remaining 
$167,000 was held in reserve. The bulk of that money, $115,000, is stored in a 
short-term certificate of deposit, the charity said. 
</P>
<P>
On the basis of that accounting, 28% of its revenue went to program services in 
fiscal 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a very poor showing," said Robert D. Burns, general manager of the city 
social service department. Burns said the low percentage of funds dedicated for 
charity and the high percentage held in reserve indicates "irresponsible 
management." 
</P>
<P>
One of Kim's supporters, Salvatore J. Iannucci, an executive recruiting 
specialist who has served as an adviser to Athletes and Entertainers since its 
inception in 1986, said the group is at most guilty of ineptitude. 
</P>
<P>
"Elise may have taken on more than she could handle," Iannucci said. "But her 
intentions are noble and she now realizes she is in over her head." 
</P>
<P>
But critics in social service agencies and within the philanthropic community 
contend that Athletes and Entertainers, for all its high profile fund-raising 
activity and access to the rich and famous, has surprisingly few achievements 
to its credit. 
</P>
<P>
While it once pledged to raise $500,000 to $1 million a year to fund day-care 
and live-in centers for patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome and 
their families, it has actually pursued a far more modest agenda of children's 
parties, educational seminars, career days and hospital visits. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Drucker, head of a social service agency called the Los Angeles Youth 
Program, which runs a summer camp for low-income and handicapped children, a 
volunteer support program for chronically ill children and their families and a 
medical transportation service, said groups such as Athletes and Entertainers 
"trivialize" the problems facing sick children. 
</P>
<P>
"These children's needs are so enormous and so real, in terms of everyday life, 
that to focus only on going to parties, meeting celebrities and big elaborate 
outings detracts from public knowledge of what the real needs are," she said. 
"Among them are very mundane things. . . . People need help with housing, 
getting their children to medical appointments, getting help with caring for a 
sick child. These splashier efforts really should be down on the list of 
priorities." 
</P>
<P>
Others accuse Athletes and Entertainers of turning away appeals for substantive 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Terry De Crescenzo of the Gay and Lesbian Adolescent Social Services, the 
state's only licensed counseling center for children with AIDS, said Athletes 
and Entertainers has repeatedly rejected her funding requests without 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
Another social worker, who asked that her name not be used, said Athletes and 
Entertainers once sent out a questionnaire asking what her group needed. "All 
we asked for were some crayons and things," she said. "Athletes and 
Entertainers never responded." 
</P>
<P>
Kim, who receives $30,000 a year for her work on behalf of the charity, said 
the organization doesn't give out funds or other goods because it is solely a 
service organization. She said the group's good deeds often go unrecognized. 
"Basically, what we do is, when a need comes up, we address it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The charity contends that 10,000 children a month benefit from its services. In 
a typical month it claims to reach 1,000 youngsters through special events and 
outings, 1,000 through hospital visits, 1,200 through gang prevention and 
stay-in-school lectures and another 6,800 through seminars on AIDS and drug 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Recent events have included a career day and carnival attended by about 1,000 
children, a day at the circus for 300 youngsters, a USC football game attended 
by 100 children and a miniature golf tournament for another 100. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Tucker of the Sickle Cell Disease Research Foundation said the 
organization's clown parties and other social events have been extremely well 
received by his children. 
</P>
<P>
Vicki Brunn of UC Irvine's Child Life Program also gives its programs high 
marks. "They've done a lot for us and we love them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Athletes and Entertainers has also been among the Southern California Gas Co.'s 
favored charities. Company officials promoted the group's events in the 
business community and made donations of $10,000 per year in 1988 and 1989. 
Dick Friend, a company spokesman, said the donation was cut back to $4,000 this 
year as the gas company's "focus" changed. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its other problems, Athletes and Entertainers has always been 
successful at attracting supporters. People close to the organization give Kim 
high marks for enthusiasm and her ability to rally people. It is her management 
skills that are questionable, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"Something always seemed to go wrong," said one former associate, who asked not 
to be named. "I used to tell Elise, 'You can't just have parties. You have to 
write some checks.' " 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, Kim broke down in tears several times as she spoke about 
the organization, which she started in 1986. Kim, then a USC sports department 
spokeswoman, had arranged for USC basketball superstar Cheryl Miller to visit a 
child dying of leukemia. She said she was so moved by the experience that she 
decided to devote herself to sick children full time. 
</P>
<P>
The charity's original name -- Athletes for Kids -- was a reflection of Kim's 
strong ties to the sports community. In the early years, her mother provided 
most of the group's funding, Kim said. The charity's main function was 
arranging hospital visits by sports figures. In one early interview, Kim said 
the group was established to provide "moral support" to seriously ill children. 
</P>
<P>
The organization gained a larger purpose and a leg up on the thousands of other 
area agencies that compete for charity dollars in 1987, when it befriended 
White, a hemophiliac who had contracted the AIDS virus through a blood 
transfusion. 
</P>
<P>
Elton John had also taken up White's cause after reading about his plight, and 
in 1988 he agreed to perform at a Century Plaza Hotel benefit that served as 
the group's first foray into big-time fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
The gala, called "For the Love of Children," was widely heralded as one of the 
biggest social happenings of the year. Actors Marlee Matlin and Charlie Sheen 
signed on as co-hosts and John, coming off a two-year performing hiatus, played 
for nearly an hour to a packed crowd of people who danced on their chairs. 
</P>
<P>
Athletes and Entertainers had predicted that the event would raise as much as 
$1.6 million, with part of the money to go toward establishing a pediatric AIDS 
clinic at County-USC Medical Center. Plans for the AIDS clinic were touted in 
the program that evening, and two County-USC representatives were called up to 
the dais to detail their ambitious goals. 
</P>
<P>
But in the end there was disappointment. The take was only $283,000, according 
to documents filed by the charity with state officials. After expenses, the 
group reported that it had actually lost $20,000 on the evening. (There are 
some contradictions in various financial statements. In its report to the city, 
for instance, Athletes and Entertainers did not report a loss on the event.) 
</P>
<P>
Kim blamed the shortfall on poor ticket sales, noting that some 500 tickets 
were eventually given away. Others say the charity erred by putting the party 
together itself, rather than turning the event over to a professional benefit 
organizer. 
</P>
<P>
County-USC, which expected to receive some $50,000 from the proceeds, was told 
that it would only be getting $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital subsequently cut most of its ties to the charity. Athletes and 
Entertainers may sponsor events on the hospital grounds, but County-USC no 
longer provides child patients for outside events staged by the charity. 
(Athletes and Entertainers frequently invites sick children from various 
hospitals to its fund-raisers, parties and other events.) 
</P>
<P>
A similar policy exists at Childrens Hospital. The hospital declined to explain 
why, but one person close to the situation said Athletes and Entertainers was 
deemed "unreliable" after failing to honor certain commitments. 
</P>
<P>
Athletes and Entertainers, meanwhile, remained active on the champagne and 
caviar fund-raising circuit. A 1989 retirement gala honoring Abdul-Jabbar aired 
on national network television and enjoyed considerable star support. Yet the 
financial take again was disappointing. The benefit grossed $231,000 and 
sustained a net loss of $60,000, according to reporting documents submitted by 
Athletes and Entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
One startling item in the expenditure report shows that the charity used about 
$78,000 -- a third of its take from the Abdul-Jabbar event -- on travel and 
meetings. Kim said the money actually went to pay for food, though the item has 
never been corrected on reporting forms. 
</P>
<P>
The charity's fortunes took another dive in March of this year, when it 
sponsored an Academy Awards night benefit. The event drew former President and 
Mrs. Reagan and grossed a reported $40,000, but suffered from a series of 
mishaps that further damaged the charity's credibility and resulted in 
widespread acrimony. 
</P>
<P>
Planned to take place under a tent on a deserted estate in Beverly Hills, it 
was forced into a hotel ballroom at the last minute because organizers lacked 
the proper permits. People who attended the gala said several of the advertised 
celebrities failed to make appearances. Fire marshals subsequently shut the 
party down at about 11 p.m. because of severe overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
Kim said Athletes and Entertainers had nothing to do with organizing the 
benefit, which was put on by Berle/Bass productions. 
</P>
<P>
Co-owner Michael Bass said Kim was at least partially responsible for the 
event's problems. He said Athletes and Entertainers failed to follow through on 
its commitments to book certain entertainment and print a program, among other 
things. 
</P>
<P>
Bass said Milton Berle, one of the main supporters of the event in large part 
because of the participation of his son, Bill, was angry at the charity. 
"Milton was fuming," he said. "They were completely irresponsible. It was not a 
happy occasion." 
</P>
<P>
The event would mark White's last public appearance. Soon afterward he was 
hospitalized, and John flew to Indiana for a bedside vigil. It was after 
White's funeral that John's representatives learned a $25,000 donation which 
the singer had made to the Whites, through Athletes and Entertainers, had not 
been received. 
</P>
<P>
"We found out that it hadn't gone into the White account," said Connie Hillman, 
the singer's co-manager, who spoke at length about the charity with John's 
knowledge. "Jeanne White (Ryan's mother) knew nothing of the fund." 
</P>
<P>
Hillman said she asked Kim about the missing money and was told that the funds 
had accidentally gone into a general account. Seeking to appease John, Kim 
pledged that $25,000 from the next fund-raiser would go to the Whites, Hillman 
said. In an interview, Kim confirmed the account, but held that John's staff 
overreacted to the missing funds. "It's no big deal," she said. 
</P>
<P>
John declined to be interviewed for this story. But Hillman said that the 
singer feels he was mistreated by Athletes and Entertainers. "For a long time 
this was his pet charity," Hillman said. "With an artist like Elton John, you 
just kind of believe that the money is going where it's supposed to. Maybe we 
should have been more vigilant." 
</P>
<P>
John, who has had no involvement with Athletes and Entertainers since White's 
death, was reportedly shocked when the charity announced last week that he 
would be a recipient, along with fellow pop star Michael Jackson, of its new 
Ryan White Memorial Award during a ceremony at Tiffany &amp; Co. in Beverly 
Hills. A spokeswoman said John wants no further involvement with the charity. 
</P>
<P>
Athletes and Entertainers said it was one of White's dying wishes that John be 
so honored. 
</P>
<P>
The singer established two independently managed funds for the White family in 
the wake of White's death. He also joined the board of the Pediatric AIDS 
Foundation, an AIDS organization whose records indicate it donates 95% of its 
revenues to charitable causes. 
</P>
<P>
People active in fund raising say Pediatric AIDS Foundation has eclipsed 
Athletes and Entertainers as the most prominent and most effective local 
organization fighting for children with AIDS. Its last benefit, a star-studded 
gala called "A Time for Heroes," raised $950,000. Among the celebrity 
participants was John, who operated a bowling booth. 
</P>
<P>
Jeanne White, who has been courted by Pediatric AIDS, remains loyal to Athletes 
and Entertainers, largely because of its longstanding ties to her son. She 
recently attended a ceremony marking the opening of its new offices. She said 
she and John have agreed to disagree about the charity. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not received the ($25,000), but I know I'll get it," she said in an 
interview. "They're not trying to keep it from me. If they were I'd be upset 
about it, too." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Gilmore, Kim's ex-husband who remains the charity's finance director, 
pointed out that Athletes and Entertainers has been a steady supporter of the 
White family. Some $60,000 has been donated to the Whites through the group's 
Ryan White Trust Fund, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the group's money is largely channeled into two other accounts: the 
Ryan White National Fund, which goes to pay for AIDS seminars and other 
educational activities, and the Hospital and Community Services Fund, which 
pays for hospital visits and social events. 
</P>
<P>
Kim said Athletes and Entertainers intends to move toward more traditional 
development activities in the near future. Aiding in the transition is Nissan: 
The Japanese automotive giant, seeking a higher profile in the community, 
recently took Athletes and Entertainers under its wing, providing office space 
in its Carson headquarters and someone to help handle the charity's finances. 
</P>
<P>
After four years in operation, Athletes and Entertainers is just now conducting 
its first internal audit. A consultant has also been called in to advise the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
With Nissan's help, Athletes and Entertainers will reassess its goals, Kim 
said. It may even tone down its highflying image. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing of fund raising is a little bit of a turnoff to me," said Kim, 
who still keeps a picture of a smiling White on her desk.

Trains, planes and Arlomobiles: In a final, frenetic effort to attract voters, 
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein will chug through the 
Central Valley this weekend by train while Republican Pete Wilson counters by 
air. Republican state attorney general candidate Dan Lungren also has taken to 
the air, accompanied by Gov. George Deukmejian. Then there is the "Arlomobile," 
a 26-foot recreational vehicle in which Lungren's Democratic foe, Arlo Smith, 
plans to tour the Southland Saturday and Sunday. Last weekend, Smith, 
accompanied by state law enforcement and abortion rights leaders, visited 10 
Northern and Central California communities in the van. He is hoping that the 
trip was not a bad omen. The Arlomobile broke down just outside San Luis 
Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign shredder: The campaign for state insurance commissioner between 
Republican Wes Bannister and Democrat John Garamendi has been uncustomarily 
well-mannered. Garamendi has aimed his invective at outgoing Republican 
commissioner Roxani Gillespie, claiming this week that he found Gillespie with 
what amounts to a smoking pistol: a document showing her Insurance Department 
used a shredder to destroy thousands of investigatory files. Gillespie 
acknowledged the shredding but said it was routine to rid the department of old 
cases where no major infraction was found. Garamendi, however, said the files 
might point to misconduct. Gillespie has appealed a court order to process 
30,000 complaints that a judge found she had ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Take from the rich: The timber industry has made a big deal out of the fact 
that wealthy investment manager Harold Arbit has contributed $5.1 million of 
his own money to Proposition 130, the environmentalist measure to halt 
clear-cutting of ancient redwoods. That didn't stop Harry A. Merlo, chairman 
and president of Louisiana-Pacific Corp., from sending a letter to Arbit's 
company, Concord Capital Management, seeking at least $10,000 to defeat the 
initiative and win passage of the industry's countermeasure, Proposition 138. 
Louisiana-Pacific itself is no slouch: It has given $1.6 million so far to the 
timber industry campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Star burnout: If their boycott of "Murder, She Wrote" is any indication, the 
supporters of Proposition 140 better start worrying about the fate of their 
ballot measure, which would limit terms of state officeholders. The 
initiative's backers last week called for a nationwide boycott of the CBS drama 
after the show's star, actress Angela Lansbury, appeared in a commercial 
opposing the measure. The show had ranked 26th in this season's Nielsen 
ratings. Last week, it improved to sixth place, seen in 5 million more homes.

WILSON: HE PLAYS IT SAFE, AVOIDING NEW ISSUES OR POLITICAL RISKS THAT FEINSTEIN

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republican Sen. Pete Wilson plodded methodically Thursday toward the 
governorship he expects to win Tuesday, playing a safe end game devoid of new 
issues or political risks. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, except for his Oct. 7 endorsement of legislative term limits, Wilson's 
campaign is ending with the very same policy positions with which it began five 
months ago: Tough on crime, for choice on abortion, cautious on taxes and 
fiscal management, pro-environment and for better education. Most of that 
platform was outlined well before the general election campaign began. Wilson's 
course has been consistent ever since. 
</P>
<P>
In these waning days of the campaign, former San Francisco Mayor Dianne 
Feinstein is struggling to find some weakness in the Wilson defense, any issue 
to exploit. The Wilson campaign is determined not to give her the slightest 
opening. 
</P>
<P>
In an address Thursday to the Commonwealth Club on Feinstein's home ground, 
Wilson delivered a speech that was a virtual duplicate of all those he has 
given since June. Even the jokes were the same. 
</P>
<P>
The only significant change has been his endorsement during their one and only 
debate Oct. 7 of Proposition 140, the initiative to limit officeholder terms, 
sponsored by Republican Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum. 
</P>
<P>
Even then, Wilson's decision was not a big surprise. He had been hinting at it 
for days. Two things changed his mind, he said: The failure of a ballot measure 
in the June primary to take reapportionment of legislative districts out of the 
Legislature's hands, and a federal judge's decision to remove campaign spending 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
With those two actions, Wilson said, the only way to achieve change in the 
Legislature's entrenched membership was through term limits. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, meanwhile, adopted a number of policy positions that were designed 
to demonstrate to voters that she is the candidate who will get California 
"moving again" after more than 20 years of governors who were stingy with 
budgets and reluctant to experiment with new programs. Some of Feinstein's 
policy decisions brought her the support of interest groups that now endorse 
her candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
She got the backing of the California Teachers' Assn., and declared that she 
would not tamper with the education spending mandates of Proposition 98 of 
1988, which is part of the CTA gospel. 
</P>
<P>
She endorsed Proposition 128, the "Big Green" environmental initiative 
sponsored by a coalition of conservation groups and won the support of the 
Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and Feinstein have battled neck and neck in the public opinion polls all 
summer long and into the fall. It seemed that nothing Feinstein could do would 
put her out front, despite the high hopes of supporters after her dramatic 
primary victory over Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp won her national attention. 
</P>
<P>
Now, late in the campaign, the issues seem to have swung in Wilson's direction. 
While Democrats may be reaping political capital by accusing President Bush of 
saving the wealthy from an income tax surcharge to help cut the federal 
deficit, Wilson boasts of voting against the budget package because of the 
gasoline and excise taxes that he claims would most hurt the average working 
man and woman. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Wilson also defended his vote against the proposed Civil Rights 
Act of 1990 as a matter of political integrity. In response to a question from 
a Commonwealth Club member, Wilson said, "I despise discrimination" of any 
sort. He added that "it would have been easy and expedient" to vote for the 
bill and not risk upsetting minority groups. "But I voted against this one, 
whatever it is called, because it was a quota bill." 
</P>
<P>
While Feinstein has tried to exploit his vote as anti-civil rights, Wilson is 
confident the issue works in his favor because opinion polls indicate a 
majority of Americans oppose quotas. 
</P>
<P>
While he is enthusiastically endorsing term limits to rid state government of 
entrenched interests, Wilson nevertheless makes constant use of his unbroken 
record of 24 years in office -- in the state Assembly, as mayor of San Diego 
and the last eight years as the junior U.S. senator from California. The 
apparent inconsistency does not seem to have shown up in the polls as a 
liability for Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
When asked Thursday how he would handle Democratic Speaker Willie Brown, Wilson 
noted that the two had served together in the Assembly years ago. Brown was 
first elected to the Legislature in 1964 and Wilson to the first of his three 
terms in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known him for years," Wilson said. "I think we'll get along just fine as 
long as he's willing to do the public business." 
</P>
<P>
Not being "beholden" to Brown -- as Wilson claimed that Feinstein is -- will 
allow him to be a strong governor, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no interest in being a weak governor," he said. "I am an activist, one 
who will enjoy the job and make change. This is why I am running. There are 
changes that this state needs that cannot be made from the Senate floor, nor 
can they be made by someone who is beholden to Willie Brown."

PRISON LIFE, PAROLE TOUCH HIGH LEVEL OF YOUNG BLACKS; 
</P>
<P>
SURVEY: THE 67,556 MALES IN THEIR 20S ARE IMPRISONED, ON PAROLE OR PROBATION, A 
STUDY REVEALS. ACTIVISTS ARE STUNNED BY THE FINDING.

<P>
One-third of African-American men in their 20s who reside in California are 
behind bars, on parole or on probation, according to a study released Thursday 
in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The figure, representing 67,556 men, exceeds by nearly five times the number of 
African-American men who attend four-year colleges in the state and is 10 
percentage points higher than the number of young black men nationwide who are 
in prison or otherwise under the control of the criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, 5.4% of white male Californians in their 20s are in the same 
situation. The figure for similar California Latino males is 9.4% 
</P>
<P>
Vincent Schiraldi of the Alexandria, Va.-based National Center on Institutions 
and Alternatives (NCIA) and co-author of the study said the higher figure for 
California's black men is a reflection of the state's greater propensity for 
get-tough-on-crime policies. Such policies have had a devastating effect on 
African-Americans, particularly black men, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A February study by the Sentencing Project, a Washington, D.C., organization 
intent on improving alternative sentencing programs, found nearly one in four 
blacks between the ages of 20 and 29 are under the control of the criminal 
justice system nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Lulann McGriff, the San Francisco-based chair of education for the National 
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People in California, said the report is 
alarming and has profound implications. 
</P>
<P>
"We are writing off an entire generation of black men," she said. "Any time you 
have 33% under the thumb of the criminal justice system something is inherently 
wrong with the system." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Ridley Thomas, director of the Los Angeles office of the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference, said the results show that California "is not 
the haven that many would like to think it is in respect to solving social 
ills." 
</P>
<P>
Schiraldi said the study was intentionally released five days before next 
week's election to influence voter attitudes against four prison bond measures 
that he said would provide $2.2 billion for the construction and operations of 
prisons and jails. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a feeding frenzy in California over building prisons," said 
Schiraldi, who operates NCIA's San Francisco office. "The corrections budget 
has (increased) in the last 10 years from $300 million in 1980 to over $3 
billion today." 
</P>
<P>
The NCIA is a nationwide nonprofit organization that has proposed alternative 
sentencing plans for 8,000 convicted criminals since it was founded in 1979 by 
a former director of Massachusetts' correction system. NCIA officials testify 
before government committees and provide courts and defense lawyers with 
possible sentencing alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
The study is a compilation of data culled from reports and surveys by several 
federal and state agencies, including the state Department of Corrections and 
the California Youth Authority, Schiraldi said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, who sponsored Proposition 133, one of 
the measures opposed by Schiraldi, also seemed shocked by the findings. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the measure would prohibit the early release of criminals 
convicted twice of murder, manslaughter, rape or a drug offense. 
</P>
<P>
"What you see is a system rushing to incarcerate people regardless of the fact 
that it is not making people any safer," he said. "The system affects black men 
more and so we allow it to continue."

SHERIFF DUFFY PUT DRUG MONEY IN SECRET ACCOUNT 
</P>

Sheriff John Duffy, prohibited since June from spending money seized in drug 
raids without county approval, failed to deposit more than $300,000 worth of 
drug funds into the county treasury and instead set up a separate, secret 
account. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office said Thursday that it will decide this week 
whether to investigate Duffy's use of the money, which may violate a county 
ordinance mandating the money be deposited into the county treasury and 
requiring the Board of Supervisors' approval before it is spent. 
</P>
<P>
However, because Duffy may have paid the district attorney's office a share of 
the money for its part in the drug seizure program, the state attorney 
general's office may be called in to avoid a conflict of interest, said William 
J. Kelly, the county's assistant auditor and controller. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy confirmed in an interview this week that he set up the separate account 
but refused to elaborate. Assistant Sheriff Jack Drown, who is running in 
Tuesday's election to replace Duffy, said his boss mentioned starting such an 
account, and that Drown warned against it. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been making mystifying decisions for 20 years," Drown said. "I'm not John 
Duffy's keeper." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Glenn Revell, a Sheriff's Department spokesman, said Duffy believes that 
the money is legally under the sheriff's control. 
</P>
<P>
"These are not county funds, these are federal funds, and it's our belief that 
we're accountable to the federal government for this money, not the Board of 
Supervisors," Revell said, adding that Duffy sought and received permission 
from the Justice Department to set up the separate account. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Brian Bilbray said he is astounded by such logic. 
</P>
<P>
"These are public funds!" he said. "You can't take checks and slip them into a 
different bank account. This is the United States, not South America. 
</P>
<P>
"For a man who has years of public service as an elected official, this is one 
hell of a terrible way to depart the scene," Bilbray said. "I don't think there 
was criminal intent here; I think it was plain stupidity." 
</P>
<P>
Revell said he does not know how much money has been gathered in the separate 
account or what it was spent for. The Times had not received its public records 
request for a breakdown of the drug-fund program as of Thursday. He also 
ignored repeated requests for telephone interviews, except to chide a Times 
reporter for repeatedly calling him. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attorney's office said the Sheriff's Department received $318,865 in 
drug seizure funds between July 1 and Sept. 30, a period when Duffy should have 
deposited the money with the county treasury. Overall, the department has 
received $3.1 million since the drug-fund program began in September, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
County attorneys and auditors already were investigating Duffy's use of nearly 
$70,000 in drug funds to pay an attorney in a civil lawsuit. Duffy paid the law 
firm of Martin J. Mayer to defend himself against lawsuits by six deputies who 
were disciplined by Duffy for their involvement in activities of the so-called 
"Rambo Squad" at County Jail in El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
The cases were settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
Auditors warned Duffy in June that he was wrong to spend drug money on his 
attorney. Asked to reimburse the drug fund account, Duffy refused. 
</P>
<P>
Auditor Kelly said that Duffy may be forced to refund the money if county 
attorneys rule that the payment was illegal. Federal guidelines established in 
1984 allowed law enforcement officials to keep money and property seized in 
drug arrests. Two years later, federal officials ruled that the money could be 
used "for law enforcement purposes only." 
</P>
<P>
Although the definition is broad, many police agencies prefer to use the money 
to fight drug offenders.

MEXICO'S SALINAS CITES GAINS IN ECONOMY AND CLAIMS POLITICAL REFORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his second annual "state of the nation" speech, President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari on Thursday portrayed a Mexican economy that is far healthier than when 
he took office two years ago, but he was roundly booed by opposition 
legislators when he claimed equal success in political reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas said the economy is growing, with lower debt payments and interest 
rates, a reduced budget deficit and a trimmed-down government. He conceded that 
inflation is higher than projected but asserted that real wages are rising -- 
another point that earned protests from the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"Today we can state that overall conditions for sustained growth are being 
consolidated," Salinas said in his two-hour speech. 
</P>
<P>
But one banner raised by lawmakers said, "Salinas Equals More Hunger and Misery 
in the Countryside." 
</P>
<P>
After six years of a negative or a stagnant economy, Salinas said, growth was 
3% in 1989 and will be more than 2% this year. Annual inflation, he said, will 
be "in the neighborhood" of 20% -- lower than the 30% that independent 
economists project but far better than the 160% when Salinas took office. The 
budget deficit will be 1% of the gross domestic product, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas received a standing ovation when he vowed to protect the nation's oil 
reserves in free-trade negotiations with the United States. The negotiations 
are to begin in the first half of next year, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"Negotiation of the type of agreement that we seek to reach with the United 
States will not entail any topic that is not strictly limited to the sphere of 
trade. . . . I want to confirm the fact that Mexico will maintain its ownership 
and complete dominion" over the reserves, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government has said it will not include the issue of oil production 
and exports in free-trade discussions, a point that the United States wants on 
the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas ran into trouble from opponents on the left and right when he asserted 
that the country now has a fair electoral law that guarantees no party a 
majority on the supreme electoral council. Although the right-of-center 
National Action Party voted for the new law in Congress, its leader, Luis H. 
Alvarez, said, "We still don't have an adequate instrument to guarantee 
democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Several Congress members and senators from the left-of-center Democratic 
Revolutionary Party asked, "What country is he talking about?" 
</P>
<P>
The new law, designed by the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, 
increases opposition vigilance over voting but essentially leaves the process 
in the hands of the PRI government. The president designates key members of the 
electoral council. 
</P>
<P>
When Salinas mentioned "transparent" elections, he was answered by chants of 
"Electoral fraud!" from both sides of the political spectrum. Opposition 
parties accuse the government of fraud in last week's elections in Coahuila 
state, as they have in most state elections since Salinas took office. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas reiterated his view of a world dividing into economic blocs and 
Mexico's need to keep pace with the changes; that, he said, is why he is 
streamlining the government, selling off commercial banks, deregulating 
industries and opening the country to foreign trade and investment. 
</P>
<P>
"In the economic sphere, we are witnessing the globalization of markets, 
financial interdependence and rising competition. . . . Those who do not adapt 
in time will let the opportunities offered by the new situation pass them by 
but will have to suffer its disadvantages," Salinas said. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, the point is that we must recognize the new rules of global 
competition, accelerate economic change at the domestic level and increase our 
participation in world markets." 
</P>
<P>
The president said the nation's foreign currency reserves are $8.4 billion -- a 
figure the government releases only twice a year. He contended that $5 billion 
in foreign investment has been approved since May, 1989, but independent 
economists say less has actually been coming in.

32 MORE KILLED IN INDIA OVER HINDU CAMPAIGN FOR TEMPLE

<P>
At least 32 more people were killed Thursday in religious strife across India 
over a militant Hindu campaign to build a temple where a mosque now stands, 
domestic news agencies said. 
</P>
<P>
"More blood may spill before there is peace," said Mulayam Singh Yadav, chief 
minister of Uttar Pradesh state, who has organized the defense of the mosque in 
the town of Ayodhya. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen people were killed Thursday in Uttar Pradesh and seven in Gujarat. 
They are two of the states most seriously affected by Hindu-Muslim riots that 
erupted after an abortive attempt Tuesday by Hindus to raze the mosque. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of towns across India -- an overwhelmingly Hindu land of 850 million 
people with a minority of 100 million Muslims -- were placed under curfew. 
</P>
<P>
"This is pure politics, not religion. Where there is a political problem, there 
can only be a political solution," Yadav, the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At least six people were killed Tuesday in Ayodhya, an ancient town of 50,000 
people and 3,000 temples, when militants tried to tear down a 16th-Century 
mosque that is reputed to stand on the birthplace of the Hindu god Ram, hero of 
the epic Ramayana. 
</P>
<P>
Hindus say the mosque was built in 1528 by Emperor Babur who first demolished a 
temple dedicated to Ram. Muslims say they will defend the mosque at any cost.

THATCHER AIDE QUITS IN EUROPE POLICY RIFT; 
</P>
<P>
BRITAIN: THE FORMER FOREIGN SECRETARY FAVORS A SINGLE EUROPEAN CURRENCY. BUT 
THE PRIME MINISTER DOES NOT.

<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey Howe resigned from the government Thursday after 
a rift with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher over Britain's commitment to 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
His resignation came five days after Howe suggested in a television interview 
that Thatcher would eventually drop her adamant opposition to a single European 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter of resignation, Howe said: "I am deeply anxious that the mood you 
have struck . . . will make it more difficult for Britain to hold and retain a 
position of influence in this vital debate (over Britain's role in Europe). 
</P>
<P>
" . . . I do not believe that I can any longer serve with honor as a member of 
your government." 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher responded that she did not believe their differences "are nearly so 
great as you suggest." 
</P>
<P>
She said she accepted his resignation "more in sorrow than in anger," according 
to the Press Assn., Britain's domestic news agency. 
</P>
<P>
"Thatcher has been bitten by the man she treated as a doormat -- and she 
deserves it," said Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a mortal blow to Mrs. Thatcher's government," said Paddy Ashdown, 
leader of the small, pro-European Liberal Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
Howe was the last Cabinet minister to have served continuously since Thatcher 
came to power in 1979, but he had appeared to be out of favor since he was 
replaced as foreign secretary last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Tall, rotund and soft-spoken, Howe seemed an unlikely participant in a 
controversy. Labor Party lawmaker Denis Healey once remarked that arguing with 
Howe was "like being savaged by a dead sheep." 
</P>
<P>
Because of his position on Europe, Howe was removed as foreign minister last 
year and shunted into the newly created post of deputy prime minister. He also 
held the titles of lord president of the council and leader of the House of 
Commons. 
</P>
<P>
His resignation as deputy prime minister followed yet another row over Europe. 
Last weekend, Thatcher found herself standing alone against 11 other European 
Community leaders on setting a timetable for adopting a single currency. 
</P>
<P>
In a television interview in London, Howe suggested that Thatcher might 
eventually change her mind. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had occasions like this before," he said. "I've attended a number of 
summit meetings with the prime minister on which, at this preliminary stage, 
we've found ourselves expressing a sharply different view, or apparently 
sharply different view." 
</P>
<P>
Howe, 63, was first elected to Parliament in 1964, was out of office from 1966 
to 1970 and has served continuously since then. 
</P>
<P>
He was appointed chancellor of the exchequer, the top treasury official, in 
Thatcher's first Cabinet. In 1983 he became foreign secretary and served until 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
His departure underlined the deep divisions within the Conservative Party, 
which trailed Labor by 16 percentage points in two newspaper polls published 
last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The appearance of disarray has been heightened by a series of Cabinet shuffles 
and resignations, beginning with Howe's removal as foreign secretary in July, 
1989.

PERU SEEKING ALTERNATIVES TO COCA CROP; 
</P>
<P>
DRUG CONTROL: THE POLICY FOLLOWS REJECTION OF $36 MILLION IN U.S. MILITARY AID. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After rejecting $36 million in U.S. military aid to fight drug traffic, Peru is 
shaping a complex new policy aimed at inducing farmers to stop growing coca 
leaves, the raw material for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Peru is the world's biggest producer of coca, and an estimated 1 million 
Peruvians depend on it for their livelihood. In outlining his new policy last 
week, President Alberto Fujimori warned that the forced eradication of coca, 
before farmers could develop profitable alternative crops, would risk civil 
war. 
</P>
<P>
The policy does not rule out military anti-drug aid in the future but places 
greater emphasis on a need for rural economic changes that could be difficult, 
slow and costly. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials here were disappointed when Fujimori turned down the $36 million 
in late September, two months after he took office, but they appear to have no 
major objections to his new policy. They privately express hope that he will 
accept an offer of $40 million in military anti-drug aid for fiscal 1991. 
</P>
<P>
A diplomatic source said the Peruvians "see a need for military assistance, but 
they see it in the context of a comprehensive program" and want more economic 
aid first. 
</P>
<P>
Fujimori's rejection of the aid also may have been a temporary concession to 
leftists who view U.S. military assistance as a threat to Peruvian sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
Washington is offering to train and equip Peruvian army troops for anti-drug 
operations in rural areas where armed traffickers and ultra-leftist Shining 
Path guerrillas are dominant. 
</P>
<P>
Fujimori's anti-drug policy paper said his administration wants to discuss 
military action in conjunction with possibilities for farmers to produce crops 
other than coca. 
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative to accompany the eradication of coca with substitution by 
other crops," the paper said. "Effective repression that left peasants without 
alternatives could easily unleash a civil war of unsuspected proportions." 
</P>
<P>
A cornerstone of the policy is to simplify complicated legal and bureaucratic 
procedures for giving peasant farmers title to the land they use. Because most 
coca farmers are squatters without land titles, they are unable to receive bank 
loans, sign contracts and form enterprises for planting, processing and 
marketing legal cash crops. 
</P>
<P>
The government has begun to establish a "rapid, simple, economical and 
reliable" new system for issuing and registering land titles, according to the 
policy paper. 
</P>
<P>
It said authorities will be better able to negotiate crop substitution 
agreements with farmers who have land titles. 
</P>
<P>
The policy also calls for deregulation measures making it easier for farmers to 
form cooperatives and business enterprises, to receive loans, to transport 
their produce and to export it to foreign markets. The paper admits that this 
is "an immense task that will require a substantial change in the Peruvian 
political system." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Peru will intensify efforts to combat drug traffic, the paper said.

Former National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski warned U.S. officials 
Thursday against starting a war with Iraq, saying it would lead to a protracted 
conflict, with victory possible only at great cost. 
</P>
<P>
"If we pursue a policy of liberation of Kuwait and of destroying Iraq, it would 
cost much blood," Brzezinski said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can say we can bomb them, and maybe that will crack their morale. . . . If 
their morale doesn't crack, fighting could last three to four weeks, maybe four 
to five months. Are we prepared to do this?" 
</P>
<P>
The comments by Brzezinski, who served under former President Jimmy Carter, 
were a significant departure from the silence that generally has engulfed the 
U.S. foreign policy Establishment in the aftermath of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of 
Kuwait.

The Bush Administration is exploring new moves in the Persian Gulf crisis in an 
effort to break the lengthening stalemate there without incurring the huge 
casualties of all-out war, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Already, White House officials are seeking United Nations approval for a 
resupply column that would attempt to pass through Iraqi military lines and 
relieve the besieged U.S. Embassy in Kuwait city. 
</P>
<P>
Other U.S. officials are considering ways to obtain a new U.N. resolution that 
would deny the use of Kuwaiti airspace to Iraqi aircraft and give the 
multinational force in the region authority to seize control of the skies above 
the tiny emirate. 
</P>
<P>
Government lawyers are also studying the feasibility of seizing Iraqi assets 
worldwide, including bank deposits, ships and embargoed cargo, and selling them 
to underwrite the cost of the huge gulf military operation and the eventual 
rebuilding of occupied Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The options are being pursued as a way to force Iraqi President Saddam Hussein 
out of his present waiting-game strategy, yet keep intact the multinational 
coalition arrayed against him. Many in the coalition are adamantly opposed to a 
quick move toward military action. 
</P>
<P>
But the new options under consideration all present a potential problem: They 
could provoke a military conflict, perhaps before the United States and its 
allies are fully ready to wage war. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. commanders in Saudi Arabia last week asked for as many as 100,000 
additional troops to augment the more than 210,000 U.S. servicemen and women 
already in the region, saying the new troops are needed because of the buildup 
of Iraqi forces in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Until the reinforcements arrive, which will take at least four weeks, military 
officials are particularly reluctant to see the United States or its allies 
take any steps that could trigger an Iraqi response demanding military 
retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush said at a news conference Thursday that he is hopeful that Iraq 
would comply with any U.N. resolution to permit the shipment of food and water 
to the U.S. diplomats and others in the Kuwait embassy. But he added, "The 
whole ploy by Saddam Hussein is to starve them out. And I think that's 
unconscionable." 
</P>
<P>
State Department officials said the embassy had supplies for three to four 
weeks at most. A White House source said that senior staff members were 
studying three means of resupplying the Kuwait mission: 
</P>
<P>
A landing in Kuwait by an unarmed ship under the U.S. or U.N. flag with 
provisions for the embassy, which sits on a corniche near the water. 
</P>
<P>
An overland convoy from Baghdad, also under U.N. auspices. 
</P>
<P>
A forcible entry by Marines on ships or helicopters, which is all but certain 
to spark at least a limited military engagement with the Iraqi troops who ring 
the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
The White House official stressed that no decision has been made to mount a 
resupply drive. 
</P>
<P>
The British and U.S. embassies are the only ones still operating in Kuwait. 
Since the British compound is near that of the United States, it would 
presumably benefit from any resupply effort. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials calculate that peaceful efforts to resupply American 
diplomats could prompt Iraq to take a hostile step while preserving the "moral 
high ground" for the United States, a U.S. official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Hussein has refrained from any such provocation, ordering his pilots 
and ship captains to avoid confrontation with U.S. and allied forces and 
refraining from any overt brutality against U.S. hostages. 
</P>
<P>
The political difficulty of a U.S. decision to take military action without 
provoking a hostile response, and Hussein's careful avoidance of such 
provocation, has led some officials in Saudi Arabia to suggest that the 
stalemate is likely to continue. 
</P>
<P>
Some Saudi officials predicted in recent interviews that Hussein will take 
overtly hostile action only when the sanctions bite deeper. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to think we could get the Iraqis to do something stupid if it came 
down to that," a Saudi official said this week. "But they've been very smart 
and are trying to make sure that we take the first step." 
</P>
<P>
Another proposal under consideration in Washington as a means of ratcheting up 
the pressure against Hussein is the possibility of asking the United Nations to 
declare Kuwaiti airspace off limits to Iraqi aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Such a resolution would presumably permit the use of limited force to back up 
the embargo, as the U.N. has allowed naval power to be used to enforce the 
blockade of Iraqi shipping. Any Iraqi aircraft attempting to take off from the 
three Kuwaiti airfields they have seized could be shot down under this 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is particularly appealing to Army officials, who are not 
enthusiastic about the initiation of a ground campaign against the 430,000 
Iraqi troops who are entrenched in fortified positions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very logical, compelling, doable," a senior Army officer said. 
</P>
<P>
He argued that such an action would limit the Iraqi air force's effectiveness 
by denying them training over the likely field of battle while reassuring 
allied nations that the United States is prepared to pursue military options 
short of all-out war. 
</P>
<P>
But, judging from the way Iraqi aircraft are now flying in Kuwait, Baghdad is 
unlikely to accept such limitations without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
While Iraqi fighter pilots have been careful not to stray outside Kuwait-Iraq 
airspace or otherwise provoke Americans, their midair tactics have made clear 
their determination to defend Iraqi airspace, according to Air Force commanders 
in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
A small group of reporters flying on an Air Force mission near the Iraqi border 
in north-central Saudi Arabia on Thursday observed a group of American F-15 
fighters breaking off from a midair refueling stop to confront what one 
official described as a "high-speed Iraqi run at the border." 
</P>
<P>
In what an Air Force spokesman accompanying the group described as part of a 
continuing war of nerves between the enemy pilots, an undisclosed number of 
Iraqi fighters headed toward the border, only to break away as the American 
combat air patrol scrambled to block against a possible incursion.

ALZHEIMER'S DEATH RATE CLIMBS TENFOLD; 
</P>

HEALTH: EXPERTS SAY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE DISEASE MAY BE RISING, 
BUT THE STATISTICAL CHANGE MORE LIKELY REFLECTS PHYSICIAN AWARENESS.

The reported death rate from Alzheimer's disease jumped tenfold between 1979 
and 1987, federal health officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
While the number of people contracting the disease may be rising, the 
statistical increase more likely reflects the fact that physicians are more 
aware of Alzheimer's and are diagnosing it more frequently, according to the 
Centers for Disease Control, which released the findings. 
</P>
<P>
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, irreversible neurological disorder of the 
elderly, marked by memory loss and severe disorientation. It currently afflicts 
an estimated 4 million Americans, according to the Alzheimer's Assn. 
</P>
<P>
From 1979 through 1987, Alzheimer's was listed as the underlying cause of death 
for 46,202 Americans, the CDC reported. The death rate from the disease 
increased from 0.4 per 100,000 people in 1979 to 4.2 per 100,000 people in 
1987, it said. 
</P>
<P>
For men, the annual rate increased from 0.5 to 4.6 per 100,000 people, the CDC 
said. For women, the rate rose from 0.3 to 3.9. 
</P>
<P>
In California, the number of reported deaths attributed to Alzheimer's rose 
from 109 in 1979 to 1,052 in 1987. The state's death rate increased from 0.5 
per 100,000 people in 1979 to 3.9 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's true that the numbers of people may have increased over time, but 
it's a little bit difficult to imagine that that would account for an almost 
tenfold increase," said Dr. Richard Sun, a medical epidemiologist with the CDC. 
"If there had been a true increase in incidence, I think our nursing homes 
would be overrun. If anything, I think heightened awareness (on the part of 
physicians) is the stronger factor." 
</P>
<P>
Stephen McConnell, vice president for public policy of the Alzheimer's Assn., a 
Washington-based organization, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Alzheimer's has been woefully under-reported in the past," he said. "We know a 
lot more about diagnosing the disease now than we did 10 years ago. Until 
recently, when a person contracted Alzheimer's and declined, the thing that 
finally brought it to an end was pneumonia or something else. That's what would 
appear on the death certificate -- and that's what got reported. Now physicians 
are making sure that Alzheimer's is on the death certificate." 
</P>
<P>
McConnell acknowledged, however, that the actual incidence of the disease could 
be rising as well. "People are living longer, and the elderly is the population 
with the highest incidence (of Alzheimer's)," he said. "So there will be more 
people dying of it." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "Whatever the statistics, we still think it is under-reported." 
</P>
<P>
The CDC's Sun said he believes "there are a lot of unknowns here," and that 
"further investigation is needed to help clarify what is going on." 
</P>
<P>
He said the CDC plans to begin a study in collaboration with the Wesley Woods 
Geriatric Hospital in Atlanta "to resolve some of the issues." 
</P>
<P>
The study will look at patients who had been hospitalized and who died -- 
either during or after hospitalization -- to determine what percentage had 
Alzheimer's and what percentage of those patients had Alzheimer's listed as the 
official cause of death. Likewise, the study will attempt to determine what 
percentage of patients might have had Alzheimer's incorrectly listed on their 
death certificates as the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
"Over time," Sun said, "we'll see if more people had it written on their death 
certificates in the true sense or mistakenly." 
</P>
<P>
The study could help reveal whether there is a heightened awareness among 
physicians, Sun said. "But it won't answer the question of whether Alzheimer's 
has actually increased in the population," he added.

FEINSTEIN LOSES $3,000 OF JEWELRY IN BURGLARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After railing against crime on her many stops along the campaign trail, 
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein has received a very 
personal reminder of the need for more law and order. 
</P>
<P>
While she was crisscrossing the state during the last several weeks, 
Feinstein's posh Century City rented condominium was burglarized, and about 
$3,000 of her finest jewelry was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
"They took only the best stuff," Feinstein said Thursday during a campaign stop 
in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein said the burglars apparently knew exactly what they were doing, 
taking the valuable articles and leaving behind genuine-looking pieces of 
costume jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
According to Los Angeles police reports, Feinstein said she lost a jade 
necklace, a multistrand ivory necklace, three gold chains, a pair of jade and 
gold loop earrings and a pair of jade and pearl earrings. 
</P>
<P>
The break-in in the 2100 block of Century Park Lane, just south of the Century 
City business area, was reported Tuesday by Feinstein's millionaire investor 
husband, Richard C. Blum, according to Detective Gary Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The burglar or burglars broke in by prying open a sliding glass door at the 
residence sometime between Oct. 24 at 10 a.m. and Oct. 27 at 10 p.m., according 
to a police report. Feinstein's name was not mentioned in the report. 
</P>
<P>
The burglary apparently was not noticed for several days because Blum thought 
the door was broken, and because the condominium had not been ransacked or 
damaged, said Fullerton, who heads the burglary unit in the Los Angeles Police 
Department's West Los Angeles Division. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein and Blum live in San Francisco, but rented the condominium early in 
the primary campaign to have a place to stay on their frequent trips to 
Southern California.

BRODERICK TESTIFIES SHE WAS HARASSED BY HER EX-HUSBAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Inconsistent but not shaken from her story, La Jolla socialite Elisabeth Anne 
(Betty) Broderick testified Thursday that she had reason to be aggrieved during 
a nasty breakup with her former husband, but conceded that her recall of 
details from their four-year divorce was hazy. 
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination in a third day on the witness stand at her 
double-murder trial, Betty Broderick said her ex-husband, attorney Daniel T. 
Broderick III, used his influence to harass her through contempt actions and to 
delay and manipulate their divorce proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
She said he and his second wife, Linda Kolkena Broderick, both of whom she is 
accused of murdering, told "horrid lies" about her, said she was crazy and 
contended that she pestered them and vandalized their property. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick, 42, said she had called the couple vulgar names -- out of 
frustration. She admitted to some vandalism, but said she was not responsible 
for all the things that had been damaged. And she said she "was crazy," because 
Daniel Broderick had made her feel that way -- like an "electrified crazy 
person." 
</P>
<P>
Because she was "operating under the most outrageous stress" imaginable during 
the divorce, she said, she had forgotten details and asked frequently Thursday 
for times, places and dates. When she remembered incidents, however, she 
remembered in elaborate detail, once even telling the prosecutor, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Kerry Wells, "No, you're all mixed up. You want me to help you?" 
</P>
<P>
Broderick is being tried on two counts of murder in the shooting deaths last 
Nov. 5 of her ex-husband and his second wife. If convicted, she could be 
sentenced to life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Broderick, who was 44, was a prominent medical malpractice attorney and 
a former president of the San Diego County Bar Assn. Linda Kolkena Broderick, 
who was 28, was his office assistant. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive day, portions of the trial were broadcast live on 
San Diego television station KNSD (Channel 39), which preempted regular 
programming four times Thursday to go live to the trial, a station spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick said she clearly remembered the court order that ended their divorce 
in 1989, four years after she and Daniel Broderick separated. The order, which 
awarded her $16,100 a month but gave custody of their four children to him, 
"shocked" her, she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said she had been "bludgeoned" and "gang-raped" by proceedings that 
occurred "in taped-up courtrooms." The lengthy trial, like the divorce file, 
had been sealed to the public, at Daniel Broderick's request, she said. The 
file had disappeared, she said. All along, she sought public scrutiny of the 
case, she said. If people "thought I was crazy or not, they had no way of 
finding out because there was no file," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick said there was no question that she left obscene messages on Daniel 
Broderick's home phone-answering machine in which she referred to him and to 
Linda Kolkena with sexually explicit epithets. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, she said she had left those messages in frustration at not 
being able to reach her four children at his house. She amended that Thursday, 
saying she also was prompted by frustration with her ex-husband and by hearing 
Kolkena's voice on the machine. 
</P>
<P>
She said: "He was attacking me, overpowering me. The only way I had to fight 
back was to call him names. Big deal." 
</P>
<P>
Kolkena, she contended, "hated me from the beginning. I never did anything to 
her." Under Wells' questioning, Betty Broderick did admit that she had called 
Kolkena a "bimbo," "stupid" and "classless." 
</P>
<P>
Broderick also denied threatening to kill her ex-husband and Kolkena about the 
time of their April, 1989, wedding, an allegation she called the "biggest of 
the black, horrid lies going around this town." 
</P>
<P>
She also said that her youngest child, Rhett, now 11, would "always ask me, 
'Would you kill Daddy?' I'd say, 'No.' He kept asking me, kept asking me, 'Are 
you going to kill Daddy?' I said, 'What are you talking about? Will you cut it 
out?' " 
</P>
<P>
Broderick is expected to complete her testimony today, San Diego Superior Court 
Judge Thomas Whelan said.

A federal grand jury on Thursday indicted a San Diego-based ship repair company 
and several of its officers on charges of violating federal environmental, tax 
and campaign contribution laws. 
</P>
<P>
The 32-count indictment charges David Bain, owner and chief executive officer 
of Pacific Ship Repair and Fabrication Inc., and nine others with conspiracy, 
embezzling assets from the company's employee profit-sharing plan, theft of a 
$1-million overpayment by the Navy, various income tax violations and making 
illegal campaign contributions to candidates for federal office. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Ship Repair and Fabrication was charged with violating the federal 
Clean Air Act in connection with the company's removal of asbestos from the 
Navy aircraft carrier Ranger. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation took 20 months and involved the U.S. attorney's office, FBI, 
Naval Investigative Service, the Internal Revenue Service, the San Diego 
Hazardous Waste Task Force and San Diego Air Pollution Control District. 
</P>
<P>
Those charged are expected to surrender to authorities within a week for 
arraignment, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Kendall M. Squires, the company's attorney, said Bain, who was unavailable for 
comment, will resign Nov. 6 to prepare his legal defense and protect the 
"successful business operations of the company." He refused further comment and 
said other principals of the company also would not comment on the pending 
litigation.

<P>
GARAMENDI ACCEPTS FUNDS FROM WIVES OF INSURERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democratic Insurance Commissioner candidate John Garamendi has said for months 
he will not take campaign contributions from insurance companies or their 
executives. But, Garamendi said Thursday, the rule does not extend to donations 
from the wives of insurance executives. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi acknowledged that following an Oct. 16 fund-raising event in Orange 
County, some wives of executives of the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. had 
sent him checks for $500 or $1,000. Unlike checks from avowed employees of 
various insurers, these checks would not be returned, Garamendi said. 
</P>
<P>
As far as he knows, the wives were acting on their own behalf and had their own 
interests, not linked to the insurance company for which their husbands worked, 
Garamendi said. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Debber, an aide to the Republican candidate for insurance commissioner, 
Wes Bannister, said, however, that he has been told by people who attended the 
fund-raiser at the Pacific Club in Newport Beach that both Garamendi and a 
staff member had suggested that the wives give as a way of getting around his 
no-insurer rule. Bannister has openly stated that he would take whatever 
insurer contributions his campaign can get. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi flatly denied he had made such a suggestion and refused to say where 
the staff member could be reached. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic candidate's comments came after an insurance industry 
representative who studied the contribution reports and is familiar with 
executives at Pacific Mutual told The Times that in the three days after the 
fund-raiser as many as 26 wives of Pacific Mutual employees gave Garamendi $500 
to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi and a spokesman for Pacific Mutual denied in separate interviews that 
the contributions came from 26 women. Both said they could not give a precise 
number. 
</P>
<P>
Among those listed as giving on Garamendi's contribution report were Marilyn 
Phyllis Sutton, wife of Pacific Mutual Chairman Thomas Sutton; Darlene A. 
Gerken, wife of Pacific Mutual President Walter Gerken, and Burdel Bubb, wife 
of retired Pacific Mutual Chairman Harry Bubb. Each of the three gave $1,000, 
the report shows. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Pacific Mutual, Bob Haskell, quoted Thomas Sutton as saying he 
saw only four other Pacific Mutual people at Garamendi's fund-raiser. Haskell 
said it was unfair "to lump in husbands with wives" in assessing such 
contributions, because "the implication is that these wives are not individuals 
in their own right." Garamendi agreed. He said the wives had "made their own 
decisions" and it was not a violation of the spirit of his personal rule 
against accepting insurers' contributions to accept their checks.

BARRY WORD: HE HAD 200 YARDS IN ONE GAME, BUT IS NO. 2 IN A ONE-BACK OFFENSE.

Nicknamed "the Last Word" at the University of Virginia, where he was voted the 
Atlantic Coast Conference football player of the year in 1985 after rushing for 
1,224 yards, it seemed that the NFL had heard the last of troubled running back 
Barry Word when he walked away from the New Orleans Saints two games into the 
1988 season. 
</P>
<P>
Word, who had spent 4 1/2 months in prison in 1986, after pleading guilty to 
cocaine distribution while at Virginia, said he needed time to rebuild his life 
before he could concentrate on football. 
</P>
<P>
By last fall, he was ready again for football. But football wasn't ready for 
him. He was waived by the Saints and sat out the season after failing in 
tryouts with the Dallas Cowboys and Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
But the Kansas City Chiefs have given the Last Word one last chance. 
</P>
<P>
"Kansas City is probably the only team that would have given me a fresh start," 
Word said. "Other teams had an opportunity to bite, but most of them passed for 
fear that I'd get back involved with drugs or I wasn't in the shape I needed to 
be in." 
</P>
<P>
Word was working as a salesman for a long-distance telephone company in Reston, 
Va., when the Chiefs sent him a plane ticket for a tryout last spring. 
</P>
<P>
"We did quite a bit of research on him," Coach Marty Schottenheimer said. "We 
flew him out and I visited with him for a couple of hours and my feeling was 
that we weren't taking a great risk because he's a very bright young man. I was 
not uncomfortable with the situation." 
</P>
<P>
Signed as a free agent in May, Word set a Chiefs' single-game rushing record by 
gaining 200 yards -- most of it in the last quarter -- in 18 carries in a 43-24 
victory over the Detroit Lions on Oct. 14. Word gained only 26 yards in the 
first half but was up to 73 after three quarters, then ran wild. In his big 
plays, he broke free for 53 yards and a touchdown, then added a 34-yard sweep. 
</P>
<P>
Has Word surpassed the Chiefs' expectations? 
</P>
<P>
"A little bit," quarterback Steve DeBerg said. "He hasn't played football in a 
couple of years, so he just continues to improve." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his record-setting game, Word remains the second back in the Chiefs' 
one-back offense, behind Christian Okoye, the 1989 NFL rushing leader. 
</P>
<P>
"Christian Okoye is a great football player, and I'm willing to accept the role 
I have," Word said. 
</P>
<P>
Raider nose guard Bob Golic dreads having to face the two big backs, Okoye at 6 
feet 1 and 260 pounds, Word at 6-2 and 240, in Sunday's game at Arrowhead 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
How will Golic try to stop Okoye and Word? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to bring friends with me," Golic said. "I'm not going to stop them 
by myself." 
</P>
<P>
This season's good fortune is hardly what Word might have expected a few years 
ago. Expelled from Virginia after he was charged with cocaine distribution, 
Word pleaded guilty and shortly exchanged his football uniform for a prison 
uniform of steel-toed shoes, denim jeans and a work shirt. 
</P>
<P>
A small-town boy from Halifax, Va., Word says he got involved in drugs because 
of peer pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to blame it on immaturity," he said. "In college I was a child. Now I'm 
a man. I'm 26." 
</P>
<P>
After serving 4 1/2 months of a sixth-month sentence at a minimum-security 
facility in Morgantown, W.Va., Word joined the Saints in 1987. They had 
selected Word in the third round of the 1986 draft. He played 12 non-strike 
games for the Saints in 1987, starting two of them and rushing for 133 yards 
and two touchdowns. He played two more games in 1988 before walking away from 
the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Why did he leave? 
</P>
<P>
"I'd been through a lot without a chance to sit back and understand everything 
that had happened," Word said. "I didn't perform the way I was capable of 
performing and I wasn't making myself happy. I thought I had to get away and 
not come back until I was able to give 100%. 
</P>
<P>
"I did it knowing that maybe no one would let me come back and play, but it was 
a chance I had to take. . . . I had to decide what was important to me." 
</P>
<P>
Word was nervous when he joined the Chiefs at a mini-camp last spring, dropping 
passes, but he settled down and later was impressive during training camp and 
the exhibition season, gaining a team-leading 90 yards during the exhibition 
season. 
</P>
<P>
He says the Chiefs have been supportive: "They treat me just like anyone else. 
And that's the way it's supposed to be because I am like anyone else. Coach 
Schottenheimer reminds me of what has happened in the past sometimes just to 
keep it on my mind. But he says it to me in a way where I know he's behind me. 
It's not like he's riding me all the time."

SENIOR GOLF: TOUR IS THRIVING AS IT MAKES STOP AT RANCHO PARK. IT DOESN'T EVEN 
HAVE TO HAVE ARNIE THESE DAYS, BUT HE'S HERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When the Senior PGA Tour first came to Los Angeles in 1985, it was already a 
surprising success. What had begun in 1980 as an excuse for some buddies to get 
together for fun and golf two or three times a year had grown into 27 events 
with $6 million in purses. 
</P>
<P>
But that was only the beginning. In its return to Los Angeles proper after an 
absence of four years, the tour for the 50-and-older professional golfers is 
now big business. 
</P>
<P>
Prize money has more than tripled and a "rookie," Lee Trevino, has already won 
more than $1 million. The country may be in a recession, but the senior tour is 
not. There is a waiting list of sponsors and cities eager to stage tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Although Trevino officially has earned $922,352, he has clinched the money 
title, which adds $130,000 to his total. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino will be trying to win his eighth tournament in the $500,000 Security 
Pacific Classic, a 54-hole event beginning today at Rancho Park. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament is one of the last events of a long season, but almost all the 
top players are here to challenge Trevino. Only Jack Nicklaus, who has found it 
difficult to admit that at 50 he can no longer beat the regular touring pros, 
and George Archer among the top 15 on the tour are absent. Nicklaus has played 
in only four senior events, two of which he won. Archer won last week at Rancho 
Murieta and took the week off. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has won seven tournaments, Trevino said he was surprised at how 
competitive it was in the seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys can play," he said. "You can't let up and you can't make mistakes. 
They'll eat you up." 
</P>
<P>
Not only has the senior tour become a bigger draw with the biggest names, it 
has become more competitive as well. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, when the first local senior event was held at MountainGate Country 
Club, the success depended upon whether Arnold Palmer played. He did not play 
that year and the tournament suffered. Few fans were there to see Peter Thomson 
win one of his record nine events. 
</P>
<P>
But today, Thomson is back in Australia building golf courses. At 61, he can no 
longer compete with the younger seniors. 
</P>
<P>
With Trevino, Gary Player, Chi Chi Rodriguez and other former stars of the 
regular tour, Palmer's presence is no longer a matter of life or death for a 
tournament. Even so, when he tees off today at 10:20 with Rives McBee and Gene 
Littler, he will have a huge gallery. 
</P>
<P>
There will be considerable interest in Palmer's play on the 480-yard ninth 
hole, a par-five. The hole, which is the 18th for those who play the tough city 
course normally, will live in infamy in Palmer lore. It was there, playing in 
the L.A. Open in 1961, that Palmer, trying to reach the green in two, hit four 
consecutive shots out of bounds. There is a plaque on the tee commemorating the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
And nobody lets him forget it. 
</P>
<P>
The driving range, where two of his errant shots landed, is adjacent to the 
hole and while he and Trevino were hitting practice shots Thursday, Trevino 
yelled, "Hey, Arnie, recognize that hole over there?" 
</P>
<P>
Although Rancho, which will be 6,307 yards long and a par 71 for the pros, had 
a fungus problem on the greens in the summer, the pros pronounced it in good 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
"This course isn't bad," Trevino said after shooting a 67 in practice. "For a 
course with small greens that has 400 rounds a day played on it, it's in 
magnificent shape. Better than I expected. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll have a great championship and I'm looking forward to it. 
</P>
<P>
"After seeing the purse money of nearly $20 million, I thought I had a chance 
to win $1 million. I need to do well in this tournament and in the last one in 
Puerto Rico and I'll make it." 
</P>
<P>
Senior Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Although it doesn't really mean much, Jack Nicklaus, by not playing in six 
events, loses his exempt status. By finishing in the top 76, however, he will 
be eligible for the TPC, which he won last summer. He will qualify for the 
other senior majors, too, since he will be allowed five sponsor exemptions. "I 
don't think he'll have any trouble getting an invitation," said Lee Trevino, 
laughing. "But I don't think he'll ever play more than four or five a year." 
</P>
<P>
Off practice rounds this week, it would appear that Orville Moody, who has not 
won since the Senior Open in June, 1989, is ready to strike. Moody, who has 
lacked consistency since fainting while hunting last winter, shot 64-63 in the 
pro-am. "If I play like I have the last two days, I can win it," Moody said 
after sinking a 25-foot putt for an eagle and finishing with a 63, the best 
warmup round, Thursday. Mike Hill and Charles Coody also seem ready to 
challenge Trevino. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Palmer has not played well since he won the Senior Skins Game in late 
January. He has not had a top-10 finish this year.

AFTER FILING FOR FREE AGENCY, DOWNING SAYS HE STILL PLANS TO SPEAK WITH RADER

<P>
Brian Downing filed for free agency Thursday, fearing that he might run afoul 
of the Sunday midnight filing deadline if he postponed filing until he was able 
to reach Angel Manager Doug Rader. 
</P>
<P>
But the 40-year-old designated hitter said he won't pursue a job with other 
teams until he can talk with Rader and determine whether there's even the 
smallest possibility that he might return to the Angels for a 14th season. 
</P>
<P>
Rader is expected back this weekend from a Latin American scouting trip. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom (Reich, Downing's agent) did it," Downing said. "He said we might as well 
just go ahead and file because we might have had a time problem if I don't talk 
to Doug Saturday. But I'm still not going to try and search around until I talk 
to Doug. This was really a clerical move. Step 1, that's all. Nothing else has 
changed." 
</P>
<P>
In other news, Angel reliever Greg Minton, who had announced his intention to 
retire, also filed for free agency. HELENE ELLIOTT

AS FATE WOULD HAVE IT, HE JUST KEEPS ON KICKING; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: USC'S QUIN RODRIGUEZ PRIDES HIMSELF ON CONSISTENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quin Rodriguez had no intention of playing football in high school. A little on 
the smallish side, he preferred soccer, which he had played for several years, 
and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
But his best friend, Eric Valliere, didn't want to walk home alone after 
practice, so he persuaded Rodriguez to try out. Still, "I didn't care for 
football too much," Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Eight years later, Valliere works in the circulation department at the Arizona 
Republic, and Rodriguez is playing the game he almost shunned -- and hoping, in 
fact, to play it on a professional level. 
</P>
<P>
USC's senior kicker, Rodriguez has been a regular for the Trojans almost from 
the day he arrived on campus 3 1/2 years ago, a skinny freshman from Mesa, 
Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
He owns the school record for conversion kicks with 129 and needs two field 
goals in USC's last five games, including a probable bowl appearance, to break 
Steve Jordan's school record of 51. Known for his consistency, if not an 
overpowering leg, Rodriguez is one of the most accurate kickers the Trojans 
have produced. 
</P>
<P>
This year Rodriguez has been successful on 12 of 15 attempts, including a 
48-yard kick against Arizona, the longest of his career. 
</P>
<P>
His 80% success rate leads the Pacific 10 Conference, but it's nothing 
extraordinary for Rodriguez. His career success rate of 74.6% includes one miss 
in 29 attempts from 30 yards or less. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of my consistency," Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
It rankles him, though, that when it is suggested some of the nation's best 
kickers play in the Pac-10, the first names mentioned are Jason Hanson of 
Washington State and Robbie Keen of California, both of whom have earned 
All-American recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez has never even made the all-conference team. 
</P>
<P>
"I get down sometimes," Rodriguez said of his lack of recognition. "There are a 
lot of good kickers, like Jason Hanson, who hit 50-yard field goals and 60-yard 
field goals, but I think it's overlooked that he misses the 30-yard field goals 
and the 40-yard field goals, just like everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, who kicked a 55-yard field goal in high school, has tried only one 
50-yard kick at USC -- two weeks ago against Arizona. With only 10 Trojans set 
and an 11th running onto the field, Rodriguez pulled a hurried kick wide. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, though, said he is capable of making longer kicks. A summer 
conditioning program prescribed by Robb Rogers, USC's strength and conditioning 
coach, added about 10 yards to his range. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I can hold up with anybody," Rodriguez said. "If I was up at 
Washington State, I could hit 65- (and) 68-yard field goals. The air is a lot 
different (there). When you come down to sea level and you're kicking against 
smog and dirt and the sea breeze, it's a lot different." 
</P>
<P>
He has tried 16 field goals of 40 yards or longer, making nine. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Smith is more of a field general," Rodriguez said. "He likes to play 
field position. That's the USC way to play football. We want to control the 
field, and if you try a 50-yard field goal, you give up a lot of field position 
if you miss it." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, though, has no complaints."I'd rather be what I am than a booming 
kicker who is (inconsistent)," he said. "I would rather be 12 of 15, with a 48 
long, and have the consistency." 
</P>
<P>
And why not? It has taken him from Dobson High School in Mesa, Ariz., where 10 
of his 26 field goals were game-winners, to three appearances in the Rose Bowl 
game. 
</P>
<P>
An all-state choice at Dobson, he didn't want to play in Arizona. He attracted 
USC's attention by sending press clippings to the Trojans' coaching staff. A 
scholarship offer followed, and Rodriguez has been USC's kicker ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, he has changed his mind about the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I really enjoy football," Rodriguez said. "Just getting a chance to kick (in 
the NFL) would be great."

CLIPPERS WILL WAIT A LITTLE LONGER FOR EDWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inexperience, the downside for most young NBA players, is probably the best 
thing Jay Edwards has going for him to remain a member of the Clippers, if in 
name only. 
</P>
<P>
"If he were a veteran player who had been in the league a couple years, I think 
at this point in time we probably would have released him," General Manager 
Elgin Baylor said. 
</P>
<P>
But since Edwards would have been starting his senior season at Indiana 
University had he not turned pro after his sophomore year, the Clippers will 
wait some more, realizing now, as when they made the guard the No. 33 pick in 
1989, that it's an investment. 
</P>
<P>
Baylor had counted on waiting only for Edwards to develop as a player. But in 
March, less than a year after being named the Big Ten player of the year, 
Edwards failed a league-mandated rookie drug test and has been on the suspended 
list ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, 21, who had also tested positive in a drug test while at Indiana, 
appeared in only four games last season as the second-youngest player in the 
NBA. He was further hampered by tendinitis in his knee that eventually required 
surgery. Tonight, as the Clippers open what should have been his second season, 
Edwards remains on the suspended list, his future more tenuous than ever. 
</P>
<P>
Any decision on his return will be made by Dr. David Lewis of the Adult 
Substance Abuse Program in Van Nuys, the league rehabilitation center. Edwards 
visits Lewis three times a week as an outpatient, works on strength and 
conditioning and continues therapy for the knee. And waits.

INTRASQUAD GAME CAN'T SHOWCASE TWO OF UCLA'S RECRUITS; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: INJURIES HAVE SIDELINED O'BANNON, ZIMMERMAN. TARVER HAS 16 POINTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA's annual intrasquad basketball game usually gives fans their first chance 
to see the Bruins' new players in action. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, a crowd of 4,788 in Pauley Pavilion watched two-thirds of 
UCLA's highly regarded recruiting class sit on the bench, Ed O'Bannon nursing 
his injured left knee, Rodney Zimmerman his injured right knee. The other top 
recruit, guard Shon Tarver, had 16 points, 10 rebounds and six assists for the 
Blue team, which lost, 106-98, to the White. 
</P>
<P>
O'Bannon is out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins aren't sure about Zimmerman, a 6-foot-9 center from Air Academy High 
in Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman's knee locked on him twice last month, initially during a drill on 
the first day of practice Oct. 15. He is scheduled to undergo arthroscopic 
surgery today at the UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins are hopeful that Zimmerman's injury is minor and that he will be 
able to return in time for their opener against UC Irvine Nov. 23 in the first 
round of the Great Alaska Shootout. 
</P>
<P>
It is feared by some close to the team, however, that Zimmerman's injury might 
be serious enough to keep him out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jim Harrick said that today's procedure, which will be performed by Dr. 
Gerald Finerman, will be exploratory in nature. 
</P>
<P>
"He just wants to see what's bothering the kid," Harrick said. "He anticipates 
there may be something torn." 
</P>
<P>
Even if no tear is found, Harrick said, Zimmerman will be given two weeks off. 
He has acute tendinitis in his knee. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a bad month," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
Forward Don MacLean had 39 points and 11 rebounds to lead the White team. 
Forward Tracy Murray led the Blue with 38 points and nine rebounds. . . . Guard 
Mitchell Butler scored 30 points for the White. . . Coach Jim Harrick will not 
use a high-post offense for the first time in his career. He has switched to a 
1-2-2 alignment. "I felt we had an abundance of wing players, rather than post 
players," Harrick said. "It just fits our personnel a little better." 
</P>
<P>
Even if Rodney Zimmerman is out of the lineup for an extended period, 7-foot-6 
Mike Lanier, a transfer from Hardin-Simmons, will probably be redshirted this 
season, Harrick said. Lanier, whose nose was broken early in the second half 
Thursday night, had three points and five rebounds in 20 minutes. . . . UCLA is 
carrying four walk-ons and may keep all of them, Harrick said.

RANKED AS TOP TWO, UCLA AND HAWAII TO PLAY SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal State Long Beach women's volleyball team is the defending national 
champion, but UCLA and Hawaii will be playing the key match during a four-team 
tournament this weekend at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA (21-1), the nation's top-ranked team, is playing host to the four-team Big 
West-Pacific 10 Conference challenge tonight and Saturday night, with matches 
beginning each night at 5 and 7. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge will culminate Saturday night with the matchup between UCLA and 
No. 2 Hawaii (19-3) in the 7 p.m. game. 
</P>
<P>
No. 13 Long Beach (18-7) took some luster off that match by upsetting Hawaii, 
15-5, 10-15, 8-15, 15-7, 15-9, Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's matches: USC (10-9) vs. Hawaii and UCLA vs. Long Beach. The Trojans 
and 49ers will open Saturday's competition.

EVANS IS A BIG HIT AT UCLA; 
</P>
<P>
VOLLEYBALL: SHE HAS HELPED FILL THE GAP CREATED WHEN ALL-AMERICAN ELAINE YOUNGS 
WAS SIDELINED.

Jenny Evans has had all kinds of brushes with greatness while playing 
volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
Take her high school career at Newport Harbor High in Newport Beach. The 
Sailors were 59-6 in her three seasons on the Newport Harbor varsity but never 
won a state championship. 
</P>
<P>
The success, and frustration, have continued at UCLA. The Bruins were a 
combined 64-4 the last two seasons and went into the NCAA semifinals ranked No. 
1 both times, and lost. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really tough, because no one can really pinpoint what went wrong in the 
(semifinal) games," Evans said. "I guess we felt comfortable (that) we were 
going into the finals the last two years." 
</P>
<P>
With the NCAA tournament a month away, Evans and the Bruins (21-1, 13-0 in the 
Pac-10) are hoping this time to hang onto their No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, we know what can happen once we get there," said Evans, a 5-foot-10 
outside hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so hard to believe we could do so well in the regular season, then lose 
when we got to the final four." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Andy Banachowski has tried to prepare the Bruins this season with a 
schedule he says is the second-toughest in the nation. They have played seven 
top-20 teams, losing only to Nebraska in their fourth match. 
</P>
<P>
Evans has played well in the Bruins' big matches. She had 24 kills in the loss 
to Nebraska and had a season-high 32 in a recent victory over fifth-ranked 
Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
"Matches like the one against Stanford are really going to help us when the 
NCAA tournament starts," Banachowski said. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, a junior, has been a big part of UCLA's success. She's second on the 
team in kills with 320, first in aces with 30, and second in digs with 300. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone notices her hitting right away," Banachowski said. "But she has 
improved her game in every area. She passes the ball well. Her serving has 
improved tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
When a knee injury sidelined All-American Elaine Youngs, the Bruins found a new 
all-around threat in Evans, who has always been adept at scoring big points 
with a big thump. 
</P>
<P>
Evans relishes the role, but is quick to add that the Bruins have a more 
balanced attack than previously. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we had one powerhouse (Youngs) controlling the game," she said. 
"This year, everyone has a role. It's hard to pick out just one person because 
everyone is contributing."

NEWSWIRE: JURY RULES NO DAMAGES BE PAID BY TYSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A jury Thursday ruled that former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson did not have 
to pay punitive damages for fondling a woman in a Manhattan disco. 
</P>
<P>
The jury of five women and one man deliberated less than an hour before 
deciding Tyson did not have to pay Sandra Miller additional damages. A day 
earlier, they ordered Tyson to pay $100 in compensatory damages for the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just happy they saw it as the truth," said Tyson, who denied the incident 
ever happened. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's lawyers sought $2.5 million for the incident they said occurred Dec. 
10, 1988.

<P>
1990: IT HAS BEEN A YEAR OF TEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The major part of the racing year has been framed by elderly women crying. 
</P>
<P>
In May, at Churchill Downs, Frances Genter, 92, cried as her 3-year-old colt, 
Unbridled, crossed the finish line, winning the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
And last Saturday, at Belmont Park, Jane du Pont Lunger, 76, cried in anguish 
when her 3-year-old filly, Go For Wand, snapped a foreleg in the stretch of the 
Breeders' Cup Distaff and was destroyed on the track. 
</P>
<P>
About two hours after that tragedy, Unbridled, not out of sight but virtually 
out of mind since his Derby victory, won the Breeders' Cup Classic against 
older horses, bouncing back into contention for horse of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Frances Genter, who recently broke a hip in a fall, and is suffering from high 
blood pressure, couldn't be at Belmont last Saturday. The Bloomington (Minn.) 
woman watched on television as Unbridled won, and then she had her family 
replay the race over and over on a VCR. 
</P>
<P>
There were no requests anywhere for replays of Go For Wand's last race, and 
reruns of the spill in the Breeders' Cup Sprint, which led to the deaths of two 
other horses, were not popular for the same reason. These are race tapes that 
should be kept in permanent storage, along with the video of Ruffian's 
breakdown in the match race against Foolish Pleasure at Belmont in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Frances Genter couldn't come to the phone Wednesday, but her husband, Earl 
Knudtson, talked about last Saturday in Bloomington. 
</P>
<P>
When Go For Wand went down about a sixteenth of a mile from home, Knudtson said 
that the accident reminded his wife of why she seldom races her horses more 
than two years. 
</P>
<P>
"She's always afraid they're going to get hurt, like Go For Wand was," Knudtson 
said. "She figures she's fortunate getting just two years of enjoyment out of a 
horse, and usually retires them after that. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember Smile (winner of the Breeders' Cup Sprint in 1986)? She went too far 
with him, trying to race him the following year (as a 5-year-old). Now she's 
always hesitant about running horses too long." 
</P>
<P>
Genter will make an exception, though, with Unbridled, who is scheduled to get 
a rest before he returns to the races as a 4-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
He is one of the few survivors of a punishing season for the top horses. Even 
before the multiple wipeout in the Breeders' Cup, racing had lost Sunday 
Silence, Easy Goer, Criminal Type, Golden Pheasant, Eastern Echo and Gorgeous 
through injuries. 
</P>
<P>
None will be back next year, nor will Safely Kept, In the Wings and Royal 
Academy, Breeders' Cup winners who are being retired. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, at least there was the prospect -- unrealized, it turned out -- of 
Sunday Silence and Easy Goer renewing their heated rivalry. Nothing is nearly 
so promising this time. The notable holdovers are Unbridled, Summer Squall, 
Housebuster and Bayakoa. 
</P>
<P>
The crop of 2-year-old colts has no one enthralled, and Meadow Star, the 
undefeated 2-year-old filly and a Triple Crown candidate, did not run on 
Breeders' Cup day like a horse who could handle colts at 1 1/4 miles. Meadow 
Star won her race, but only after Jose Santos had to whip the horse 22 times 
through the stretch to keep her interest. 
</P>
<P>
LeRoy Jolley, who trains Meadow Star, also trained Foolish Pleasure. After 
Ruffian died, Jolley harshly said: "This is not a game for anybody wearing 
short pants." 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years later, the day after Go For Wand's fatal injury, Jolly was more 
sentimental. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day, we (trainers) live with the thought that a horse might get hurt," 
he said. "And you hate the thought, but every time horses run, their lives are 
on the line." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Delahoussaye is riding two of the morning-line favorites at Santa Anita 
in Saturday's California Cup, the 5-2 Shirkee in the Mile and Pillaring, who is 
7-5 in the Juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
Other favorites in the seven races, which are worth $1 million, are Variety 
Road, who is 3-1 in the Classic; Sensational Star, even money in the Sprint; 
Paper Princess, 7-2 in the Distaff; Theresa's Pleasure, 7-2 in the Juvenile 
Fillies; and Meadow's Interco, 7-2 in the Starter Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Snow Chief, whose owner, Ben Rochelle, is sponsoring one of the races, will be 
in the Santa Anita walking ring before the Juvenile and will also make an 
appearance on the track. Snow Chief, champion 3-year-old colt in 1986, stands 
at stud at Valley Creek Farm in Valley Center, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Plenty of Grace, the 3-year-old Roberto filly who races for Darby Dan Farm, has 
arrived at Santa Anita to join an estimated 11 other fillies and mares for 
Sunday's $400,000 Yellow Ribbon. Plenty of Grace won the Queen Elizabeth 
Challenge Cup at Keeneland in her last start. . . . Rial and Eradicate, the 1-2 
finishers in the Oak Tree Invitational, are scheduled to run Monday, the 
closing day of the meeting, in the $200,000 Burke Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
The battle for the national money title among jockeys will be largely settled 
at Hollywood Park, with Jose Santos coming from New York to ride in California 
the last two months of the year. Gary Stevens is the leader, by about $500,000. 
Hollywood's 37-day meeting starts next Wednesday and runs through Dec. 24. . . 
. Corwyn Bay, who almost tripped over Mr. Nickerson in the Breeders' Cup 
Sprint, is back in California, with cuts on both hind legs. He'll be rested 
until the Santa Anita winter season opens on Dec. 26.

<TEXT>
<P>
Dare You To, runner-up in the American Pacing Classic final at Los Alamitos, 
has been established as the 2-1 second choice in the $273,458 Aged Horse Pace, 
one of eight Breeders Crown races tonight at Pompano Park in Pompano Beach, 
Fla. (5 p.m., PST, ESPN). 
</P>
<P>
Dare You To, a 5-year-old son of Abercrombie, finished a neck behind T K's 
Skipper in world-record time of 1:51 2/5 for an aged pacer on a 
five-eighths-mile track in the American Classic. 
</P>
<P>
T K's Skipper suffered a foreleg tendon injury two weeks ago and will miss the 
Breeders Crown. Dare You To won a race on the Pompano five-eighths oval on Oct. 
20 in 1:51 4/5, a track record, but finished fifth in a race there last 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Alflen of Redondo Beach owns Dare You To, who has earned $610,652. Jack 
Moiseyev will drive the horse from post No. 3. Topnotcher, the 9-5 favorite, 
will start from the outside post in the eight-horse field. STEVE SCHUELEIN

BRODERICK SAYS EX-HUSBAND ISOLATED HER FROM CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
Elisabeth Anne (Betty) Broderick, accused of killing her former husband and his 
second wife, testified Thursday she became increasingly frustrated by Daniel 
Broderick's attempts to isolate her from their children. 
</P>
<P>
During cross-examination in her double-murder trial, Broderick said that her 
ex-husband, an attorney, had installed an answering machine in his home that 
she said was used to intercept her calls to the four children. 
</P>
<P>
Her frustration at being unable to speak to the children, she said, drove her 
to leave obscene messages whenever she called and got the tape. 
</P>
<P>
"It was Dan putting the machine on to keep me from getting to the kids. That 
was intended to harass me," Broderick said. 
</P>
<P>
She said she became particularly agitated when the answering tape was in the 
voice of Linda Kolkena, the legal assistant Daniel Broderick later married. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick has pleaded innocent to the Nov. 5, 1989, killings of Daniel 
Broderick and Linda Kolkena Broderick. The couple were fatally shot in the 
bedroom of their Hillcrest home. 
</P>
<P>
During her third day on the stand, Broderick also testified that after their 
separation, Dan Broderick made every effort to stay away from her. 
</P>
<P>
"From the day he walked out, Mr. Broderick didn't want to have any contact with 
me," Broderick testified. 
</P>
<P>
When he dropped off their children at her home for visits, Broderick said, he 
would call from the car and ask that the children wait on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
She said calls she made in which she threatened Daniel with various legal 
actions became her only recourse in the couple's protracted divorce, which 
ended a 16-year marriage. 
</P>
<P>
"That was only a little cheap threat that I could throw at him," she said. "I 
had no leverage to make Dan settle with me." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Broderick testified that her husband had physically abused her. 
But during a terse cross-examination by Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry Wells, she 
balked when asked to name dates on which Daniel Broderick had hit her. 
</P>
<P>
Wells asked her specifically about her testimony that Daniel Broderick had once 
given her a black eye. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember," she said. "It wasn't that big a deal." 
</P>
<P>
Wells also asked Betty Broderick about a failed suicide attempt in November, 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick earlier said she had cut her wrists and taken several pills. She said 
Thursday that Daniel Broderick, a medical malpractice attorney who also 
graduated from medical school, had treated her wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Wells then asked to see Broderick's wrist to see if she had any scars. 
</P>
<P>
After examining her arms, Wells said she didn't see anything. Broderick's 
attorney protested Wells' statement, prompting the judge to suggest that 
Broderick let the jury see her arms. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors then stood as Broderick displayed her wrists to panel members. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have argued that Broderick killed the couple out of hate and 
revenge after a bitter divorce and custody battle. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick's attorney, Jack Earley, however, is trying to portray Daniel 
Broderick as a selfish, manipulative, abusive and alcoholic husband who hired 
Kolkena, then began having an affair with her while trying to persuade Betty 
Broderick that she was crazy and no longer appealing to him. 
</P>
<P>
The couple were divorced in 1986 and battled for the next three years over the 
custody of their two young sons, Danny and Rhett, 13 and 10 at the time of the 
slayings.

DRUG OVERDOSE LEAVES CHEYENNE BRANDO, 20, COMATOSE, SOURCE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Actor Marlon Brando's daughter, Cheyenne, 20, lay comatose in a Tahitian 
hospital late Thursday after overdosing on tranquilizers and antidepressant 
drugs, according to a source close to the family. 
</P>
<P>
"The next eight hours are critical," physicians at Mamao Hospital told Brando, 
according to the source. 
</P>
<P>
He booked the next flight to Papeete this morning, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
A physician at the hospital confirmed that Cheyenne Brando is a patient. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say anything (further) without the authorization of the family," he 
said. "She's hospitalized. That's all I can say." 
</P>
<P>
For months, the young woman has been the object of a tug-of-war between 
authorities in California, where she is a critical witness in the murder trial 
of her half-brother, Christian, and Tahiti, where she has been charged with 
complicity in the death of her lover, Dag Drollet. 
</P>
<P>
Drollet was shot to death by Christian Brando at the elder Brando's Mulholland 
Drive estate in May. Christian Brando has admitted the shooting but insists it 
was accidental, the result of a struggle over a gun after his pregnant sister 
told him Drollet had beaten her. 
</P>
<P>
Brando's trial is to begin Monday, although prosecutors have asked for a delay 
while they exhaust efforts to compel Cheyenne to return to Los Angeles. Without 
her testimony, prosecutors say their chances of proving the shooting was 
premeditated and, thus, murder are slim. 
</P>
<P>
Cheyenne Brando told police shortly after the shooting that it was not an 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a murder, in case you don't know," she said in a June interview. 
</P>
<P>
The young woman then took the next direct flight to Tahiti, where she gave 
birth to Drollet's son and was herself charged in the death of Drollet, a 
French citizen. 
</P>
<P>
The victim's father, Jacques Drollet, said in an interview from Tahiti last 
month that, since her return, Cheyenne has twice been hospitalized in a 
psychiatric facility for drug detoxification. 
</P>
<P>
"Now she's out having a good time," he reported three weeks ago. "She is 
roaming about in Papeete, the main town of Tahiti, where she has been seen 
shopping with her mother, Tarita, and her (newborn) son, Tookie. She is also 
going out to the beaches and the nightclubs with her new boyfriend, an Italian. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
But Marlon Brando has maintained that his daughter has suffered both physical 
and emotional problems since a near-fatal auto accident and Drollet's death. 
The last time he accompanied his son to court he broke down in tears when asked 
about her condition. 
</P>
<P>
The state Supreme Court on Thursday passed along to an appeals court the 
prosecution's request to delay the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors also have requested that the Santa Monica Superior Court judge 
hearing the case be ordered to rule on whether a formal request for help from 
French authorities in returning Cheyenne Brando to California should be issued. 
The high court also referred that matter to the appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
Jury selection will begin Monday, unless the appellate court acts today.

HOSPITAL DIVERTING SOME OF THE POOR; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: UCLA IS EXPECTED TO SEND ABOUT 1,000 MEDI-CAL PATIENTS A YEAR TO 
QUEEN OF ANGELS IN AN ECONOMY MOVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move prompted by the growing crisis in the state Medi-Cal system and by 
financial motives, UCLA Medical Center this week began diverting indigent 
patients from its emergency room to Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian 
Medical Center, officials at both hospitals said. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 Medi-Cal patients are expected to be transferred each year from 
UCLA, mostly by ambulance, to the Hollywood hospital. Only those patients who 
do not face "acute," or life-threatening situations, will be transferred, the 
hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, reached last week by the two hospitals, points to the increasing 
disparity in health services available to those who are privately insured and 
those who must rely on state-funded health insurance. Officials at the state 
Department of Health Services said that to their knowledge the agreement was 
the first of its kind in California. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Medical Center is considered one of the best hospitals in California. But 
Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center has come under fire in 
recent years for the quality of care it provides to its patients, 85% of whom 
are poor. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at UCLA Medical Center said the patient transfer is only one of a 
series of efforts designed to reduce the number of patients at UCLA with 
Medi-Cal insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years, the reimbursement level from Medi-Cal has deteriorated," said 
Mark Laret, associate director of Marketing and Planning for UCLA Medical 
Center. "It has not kept pace with our increasing costs." 
</P>
<P>
Other hospitals have similar complaints about the Medi-Cal system. In August, 
the California Assn. of Hospitals and Health Systems filed a lawsuit on behalf 
of California's 567 hospitals, contending that the state Medi-Cal program has 
illegally underpaid them by millions of dollars to treat indigent outpatients. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has consistently posted excess revenues -- in the 1989-90 fiscal year, the 
hospital made $24 million. But hospital administrators say a decline in 
Medi-Cal reimbursements is costing the hospital millions of dollars each year, 
threatening the prestigious research projects that have made it a "world-class" 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
"Our mission is to do research and to provide medical education and services to 
the community," Laret said. "We have provided service to people who cannot 
afford to pay in such large quantities that it has threatened the research that 
has made us world-renowned and the education of the future physicians of 
California." 
</P>
<P>
About 30% of the patients at UCLA Medical Center are Medi-Cal recipients, Laret 
said. The hospital would like to see the proportion of Medi-Cal recipients drop 
to about 22%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A recent article in the medical center's newsletter lists a series of proposed 
and already existing measures designed to reduce the number of Medi-Cal 
patients at the hospital. Some clinical departments at the hospital have begun 
to limit outpatient appointments to "control the numbers of new Medi-Cal 
patients who enter the UCLA system," the article says. 
</P>
<P>
While it is seeking to turn away Medi-Cal patients, the medical center also has 
launched a campaign designed to attract more privately insured patients. 
Newspaper ads -- which first began appearing in the Los Angeles Times Westside 
section this summer -- are promoting a new physician referral service. 
</P>
<P>
"Now all you have to do to get an appointment with a UCLA physician is pick up 
the phone," one advertisement reads, adding that physicians on the faculty of 
UCLA's School of Medicine have helped make UCLA "the No. 1 medical center in 
the West." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the hospital to which UCLA has begun sending some of its Medi-Cal 
patients was recently criticized for its poor conditions by the Joint 
Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the commission placed Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical 
Center on conditional accreditation, a classification reserved for hospitals 
with significant problems in meeting quality-of-care and safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital President Ron Dahlgren said Queen of Angels' agreement with UCLA could 
bring the hospital $630,000 in additional monthly revenue. The Hollywood 
hospital lost $11 million last year, Dahlgren said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Ringrose of the California Medical Assistance Commission, which negotiates 
contracts between hospitals and the state Medi-Cal program, said he felt the 
agreement was a practical way to address the widely different problems faced by 
the two hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
"UCLA is a highly specialized . . . teaching hospital; Hollywood Presbyterian 
is a primary-care community hospital," Ringrose said. "One hospital wants 
patients and the other . . . simply can't accommodate more Medi-Cal patients. 
(The agreement) is a win-win situation for both hospitals."

Jim Campbell received the kinds of honors Thursday that often go to public 
heroes who risk their lives to help others. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, a Lancaster carpenter, went to a luncheon, accepted several framed 
plaques and endured repeated handclasps with public officials -- all because he 
stopped on his way to work last Jan. 30 and aided three people trapped in an 
overturned car. 
</P>
<P>
What Jim Campbell did not expect for his brief heroism was a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell and Los Angeles Police Motorcycle Officer Loran Dale Turner -- awarded 
the department's highest honor for his actions that morning -- are being sued 
by one of the three crash victims, who was injured by a second car that veered 
into the overturned vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty calm about it now," Campbell said just before he was honored with 
nine other men by the Mid-Valley Community Police Council. "But when I first 
heard about it, I was real upset." 
</P>
<P>
According to the Police Department and the citizens' group that presented 
honors at the Sportsmen's Lodge in Van Nuys, Campbell, 31, and Turner, 42, are 
heroes for coming to the aid of Ricardo Garcia, his wife, Norma -- who was in 
labor -- and a cousin. 
</P>
<P>
As gasoline gushed from the overturned car, the two men carried Garcia's 
pregnant wife to safety and went to the aid of the cousin, who was struck by 
another vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
But in a lawsuit, filed Sept. 25 in Los Angeles County Superior Court, the 
cousin, Anzelma Sanchez-Sianez, 17, claimed that she was struck by the second 
car because of negligence. According to her lawyer, Paul Jay Bershin, 
Sanchez-Sianez alleges "that the police officer failed to put up a flare 
pattern to stop the vehicle" that hit the Garcias' overturned car. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages and also names Ricardo Garcia and 
the driver of the second car as defendants, claims that after helping 
Sanchez-Sianez out of the car, Campbell put her "in an unsafe place." She 
suffered a ruptured spleen, Bershin said. 
</P>
<P>
Turner, awarded the Police Department's Medal of Valor in September, declined 
to answer the specific allegations in the lawsuit against him. But he angrily 
defended Campbell, claiming that the civilian was simply reacting with grace 
under extreme pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"Had Jim Campbell not taken the actions he did that morning, there wouldn't be 
a 10-month-old girl and a mom and a dad alive today," Turner said. "I wish 
there were more Jim Campbells out there." 
</P>
<P>
Turner said that he would not have noticed the overturned car if Campbell had 
not already stopped to help. "I saw his car parked next to the center divider, 
and then I saw him jump over," Turner said. "If he hadn't been there, I would 
have kept on driving." 
</P>
<P>
Other cars passed by, but he stopped, Campbell said, because "it was the right 
thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
According to a police account, the car was northbound on the San Diego Freeway 
near Roscoe Boulevard in Van Nuys, on its way to a hospital, when it turned 
over in the fast lane of the freeway. Campbell parked his pickup truck on a 
"breakaway" lane on the southbound side of the freeway and by the time Turner 
made it to the divider, Campbell could hear the pregnant woman yelling: "My 
baby! My baby!" 
</P>
<P>
"Gas was pouring out of the car right by her head," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
The two men assisted the expectant mother and the teen-ager from the car, 
Turner said. Ricardo Garcia emerged from the vehicle on his own. Then the two 
men, unaware that the frightened woman was referring to her unborn child, began 
searching for an infant. Precious moments passed, both men said, before they 
realized that the woman was in labor. 
</P>
<P>
"I could see headlights coming -- high beams, low beams," Turner said. "I could 
see the next vehicle coming and I told (Campbell) to grab the lady's legs and 
we lifted her up onto the center median barrier." 
</P>
<P>
Turner and Campbell said that they turned back to help Sanchez-Sianez, but it 
was too late. 
</P>
<P>
"A (second) car crashed into the overturned car, there was a fireball and the 
second car veered hard left and took the teen-aged girl 180 feet down the 
freeway," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Turner, there was no time to even think about setting up flares. 
Even if there had been time, he said, the gallons of gasoline spilling out over 
the car and its occupants would have made using flares a fatal act. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole thing took maybe 80 seconds," Turner said. "There was no time to 
lay a flare pattern and you wouldn't want to do it with gasoline pouring out 
all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
Since the incident, Turner has turned to City Councilman Joel Wachs for help in 
devising state legislation that might protect good Samaritans from legal 
liability when they help others as Campbell did. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the least we can do to thank people like Jim Campbell," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Campbell sought a more private gesture. After the accident, he went to the 
hospital several times, he said, to check on Sanchez-Sianez's progress. 
</P>
<P>
"Last time I was there was on Valentine's Day," Campbell said. "I just wanted 
to see how she was doing. But I never heard from her."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN KILLS DAUGHTER, SELF OVER CUSTODY 
FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman who feared that her estranged husband would gain custody of their 
3-year-old daughter shot and killed the girl and then herself Wednesday as they 
rode in a friend's camper in Panorama City, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Josephina Rios, 29, died about 10:15 p.m., four hours after she fired a single 
round into the head of her daughter, Samantha, and then shot herself in the 
head, Sgt. Joe Braza said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators found a note apparently written by Rios saying she was despondent 
over the prospect of her husband gaining custody of Samantha. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Mike Houchen said Rios feared that her husband, Antonio Rios, would 
disappear with the child. 
</P>
<P>
The couple, who lived in Anaheim, had been separated for about a year and were 
divorcing. 
</P>
<P>
"The mother left a suicide note indicating this was best for the child and 
herself," Houchen said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEPUTY PAID FOR BOAT IN CASH, WITNESS 
TESTIFIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Testimony continued Thursday in the trial of seven Los Angeles County sheriff's 
deputies accused of money-skimming, with several witnesses saying one deputy 
spent at least $45,000 in cash on a boat, jewels and assorted cashier's checks 
during a 12-month period. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of a boat dealership testified that Deputy Ronald E. Daub purchased a 
$17,668 boat in July, 1988, and within eight days paid for it in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Two other witnesses testified that Daub bought more than $26,000 in cashier's 
checks between July 25, 1988, and July 10, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In the same time period, the owner of a Puente Hills jewelry store testified 
that Daub and his wife dealt primarily in cash when they bought jewelry, 
including a ruby and diamond necklace costing $11,389. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors are attempting to show how the defendants disposed of some of the 
$1.4 million they allegedly stole from drug dealers and money launderers. The 
prosecution is expected to rest its case today.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WORKER TRAPPED 2 HOURS BY CAVE-IN AT HOTEL 
SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 25-year-old construction worker suffered minor injuries Thursday after being 
trapped for more than two hours in a cave-in at a Glendale hotel construction 
site where a similar accident in August killed another worker. 
</P>
<P>
Two dozen firefighters and city crews worked carefully to free John Jehlik of 
Long Beach, who was trapped chest-deep in dirt at the bottom of a 15-foot-deep 
sinkhole on Glenoaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 10, Enrique Ayala, a 33-year-old drilling company foreman, was buried 
head-first in another cave-in. A series of trenches is being dug alongside the 
Verdugo Wash and filled with concrete to anchor an 18-story Red Lion hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Cal/OSHA concluded that no negligence was involved in Ayala's death, said 
spokesman Rick Rice. But after sending two investigators to the scene Thursday, 
the state ordered the site closed until officials meet today with companies 
working on the project, Rice said.

</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
One of the two prosecutors in the retrial of the McMartin Pre-School 
molestation case attended the nursery as a child, a fact the district 
attorney's office did not disclose until Thursday, three months after the case 
ended in a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Pam Ferrero attended the preschool for a brief time in the late 1950s, before 
chief McMartin defendant Raymond Buckey was born, said Sandi Gibbons, a 
spokeswoman for Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey's defense attorney, Danny Davis, said it was quite likely that some of 
the teachers and former teachers cross-examined by Ferrero at the retrial were 
her teachers at the Manhattan Beach nursery. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbons said her office had known before the retrial that Ferrero had attended 
the now-razed preschool, but felt that Ferrero's attendance there had no 
relevance to her role as co-prosecutor and therefore did not disclose it.

IMELDA MARCOS SEEKING DEAL TO RETURN HOME 
</P>

<P>
Making her first visit to Los Angeles since she was acquitted of fraud and 
racketeering charges in July, former Philippine First Lady Imelda Marcos said 
Thursday that she is seeking a settlement with the Philippine government that 
would allow her to return to her homeland. 
</P>
<P>
President Corazon Aquino's government has filed a civil suit in Los Angeles 
federal court, seeking to recover some of the estimated $5 billion the 
government claims was looted from its Treasury by the Marcos regime. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, talks are going on about this case, whether it should proceed or 
not," Marcos, 61, said before a speech Thursday evening to supporters in 
Carson. 
</P>
<P>
She said she had rejected earlier suggestions of a settlement because of the 
criminal charges pending against her. 
</P>
<P>
Her acquittal in New York federal court provided the vindication she said she 
needed before discussing a settlement. "Now that the verdict is in, that's good 
money. That's clean money," she told more than 600 loyalists at a rally at the 
Carson Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos and her late husband, Ferdinand E. Marcos, fled the Philippines in 1986 
after the government was toppled. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that the country is in dire need of funds, I offer to share whatever 
wealth or resources I have with the Filipino people," the former First Lady 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Philippine Consulate spokesman Roy Gorre said his government has 
not ruled out the possibility of a settlement.

DISCOVERY COULD LEAD TO MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY THERAPY; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: RESEARCHERS REPORT FINDING THE MECHANISM BY WHICH MUSCLE CELLS ARE 
DESTROYED IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Berkeley researchers for the first time have determined the mechanism by which 
muscle cells are destroyed in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a discovery that 
could lead to the development of new forms of drug therapy for the disorder. 
</P>
<P>
UC Berkeley biologist Richard Steinhardt and his colleagues report today in 
Science magazine that the destruction in both mouse and human cells is caused 
by a defect in cellular membranes that allows destructively high levels of 
calcium atoms to enter muscle cells and cause them to degenerate. 
</P>
<P>
In light of this finding, researchers at UC San Francisco and elsewhere are 
already planning clinical trials of drugs that might block entry of calcium 
into muscle cells in hopes that the drugs will prevent muscle degeneration. 
</P>
<P>
A family of drugs called calcium blockers is already used to treat heart 
disease and high blood pressure, and researchers hope that one of these or a 
similar drug might prove to be an effective therapy for muscular dystrophy as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"We're giving drug manufacturers a target for the development of new drugs for 
attacking muscular dystrophy, as well as a way to (measure) the effectiveness 
of a new drug," Steinhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
The new findings complement the recent discovery of the defective gene for 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy and provide insight into how the defective protein 
produced by the gene may damage muscle cells. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers have been attempting to replace the defective gene in the muscle 
cells of muscular dystrophy victims using a technique called myoblast transfer 
therapy, and today's new finding may provide an "exciting" alternate way to 
attack the devastating disease, according to Lawrence Stern, president of the 
Muscular Dystrophy Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Babies with muscular dystrophy appear normal at birth but develop a progressive 
weakening of the muscles that usually places them in a wheelchair by the age of 
11. There is no effective therapy for the disease, and most victims die in 
their late teens or early 20s when the muscles that operate the heart and lungs 
cease functioning. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers found the gene that causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy three years 
ago. The healthy gene is the blueprint for a protein, called dystrophin, that 
allows muscle cells to function properly. "Now the question is how does the 
lack of dystrophin result in this fatal disease?" Stern said. "That's where the 
large research thrust is." 
</P>
<P>
The Berkeley results indicate that dystrophin is somehow involved in regulation 
of the entry of charged calcium atoms into muscle cells through so-called 
calcium channels. 
</P>
<P>
These calcium ions are required for normal function of the muscle cells, but 
the defective dystrophin allows much higher levels of calcium to enter the 
cells, Steinhardt found. Those increased levels stimulate the activity of 
enzymes called proteases that break down proteins within the muscle cells. 
</P>
<P>
"The muscles are literally digesting themselves," Steinhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
Stern noted that similar calcium channels are present in heart and blood vessel 
tissues, but that they had never been found before in muscle cells. The 
channels' involvement in causing muscular dystrophy, he added, "gives us a 
theoretical and, perhaps soon, practical approach to a treatment. We need to 
find a drug that blocks this abnormal channel, and there are certain types of 
drugs that seem to be suited to this type of job." 
</P>
<P>
Steinhardt said he has not yet found any drugs that block the channel and 
prevent calcium from entering the cell. But UCSF neurophysiologist Jeffrey B. 
Lansman said he has tentatively identified at least one such drug, which he 
will not yet name, and that he and other researchers are planning clinical 
trials of it as soon as their research protocol is approved by their 
institutional bioethics review panels. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to give it in very small doses to patients that have already been 
observed for a long time so that we can see whether it will slow the 
progression of the disease," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, researchers elsewhere have been studying myoblast transfer as a 
potential therapy for muscular dystrophy. In this approach, healthy embryonic 
muscle cells from a relative are injected into the patient's muscle tissues. 
The genes in the healthy cells are inserted into the defective cells and 
stimulate the production of dystrophin. 
</P>
<P>
Neurologist Peter J. Law of the University of Tennessee reported earlier this 
week at a meeting of the Society for Neuroscience that injection of such cells 
into the big toes of three muscular dystrophy patients led to as much as an 80% 
increase in functioning of the muscles. Researchers now plan to try the 
technique on muscles that would be more useful to the patient, such as arm and 
finger muscles. 
</P>
<P>
Stern said that both myoblast transfer and the use of drugs look very 
promising, and that the two approaches could prove complementary. "We're going 
to support every approach that could lead to a treatment to the hilt."

GENE DEFECT FOUND IN FAMILY AFFLICTED BY ANEURYSMS; 
</P>
<P>
BLOOD VESSELS: SIMPLE SALIVA TEST DEVELOPED BY RESEARCHERS IDENTIFIES FIVE 
RELATIVES AT RISK OF DEVELOPING AILMENT. SURGERY CAN PREVENT FATAL BURSTING OF 
AORTA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A genetic defect that predisposes its bearer to aortic aneurysms -- 
blood-vessel swellings that can rupture fatally -- has been discovered in a 
family with a history of the disease, researchers reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers from Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia have developed a 
simple saliva test for the presence of the gene and have identified five 
members of the family who are at risk of developing aneurysms. 
</P>
<P>
Molecular biologist Darwin J. Prockop and his colleagues are now studying 
nearly 100 other families in hopes of finding similar defects before aneurysms 
develop, and they believe that within two years the test can be expanded to 
cover a large segment of the population. 
</P>
<P>
Aortic aneurysms kill more than 15,000 Americans annually and at least 2 
million people are thought to be at risk. Identifying susceptibility to the 
aneurysms will enable physicians to monitor those at risk so that the aneurysms 
can be surgically repaired before they burst. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very important discovery . . . a milestone in the understanding of this 
problem," said surgeon M. David Tilson of Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
Prockop and his colleagues discovered the gene in 37-year-old Michele Hegler, a 
former Air Force captain who is currently healthy but was referred to them 
because of a family history of aneurysms. Five of her relatives, including a 
15-year-old cousin and her 34-year-old mother, died suddenly from ruptured 
aneurysms in their aortas. The aorta is the largest artery in the body. 
</P>
<P>
The team quickly focused on a protein called collagen III. Collagen is the 
fibrous material that holds together skin, tendons and most other tissues in 
the body, and collagen III is the major form found in the aorta. "We also knew 
that a few rare diseases . . . were caused by mutations in collagen III and 
that many people with these diseases developed aortic aneurysms in addition to 
other symptoms," Prockop said. 
</P>
<P>
The gene that codes for collagen III contains 30,000 chemicals, called bases, 
arrayed in a specific sequence. The Philadelphia team reports in today's issue 
of the Journal of Clinical Investigation that one of those 30,000 bases in 
Hegler's gene had been mutated so that the collagen III it produced had a 
subtly altered shape. 
</P>
<P>
"Each collagen molecule is like a brick that sticks to other collagen molecules 
and forms long, tough fibers," Prockop said. "Because each collagen molecule 
sticks to other molecules on all sides, the structure must be almost perfect." 
The alteration in Hegler's collagen III "is enough to slightly change the shape 
of the molecule and interfere with its ability to adhere to other molecules 
properly." 
</P>
<P>
After years of pounding from the blood pressure of the heart, he added, the 
aorta wall can stretch and form a weak bubble that can very easily rupture, 
causing the patient to bleed to death. 
</P>
<P>
Study of preserved tissue samples from Hegler's deceased mother and aunt showed 
that their collagen III genes carried the same defect. 
</P>
<P>
After discovering the defective gene, the researchers developed a simple test 
for it that requires only a teaspoonful of saliva. They then tested 10 other 
members of the family and found that four of them -- Hegler's 15-year-old son, 
17-year-old daughter, brother, and aunt -- all carried the defective gene. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always concerned about my family's history of aneurysms because so many 
died," Hegler said. "I often wondered whether the same thing can happen to me. 
Now that I know, my family and I take precautions." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the susceptible family members will have ultrasound, 
echocardiogram, and CT scan exams yearly to detect aneurysms at an early stage. 
Once detected, the aneurysms can be surgically repaired at relatively low risk, 
Prockop said. In contrast, 90% of patients die when their aneurysms proceed to 
the stage where they burst. 
</P>
<P>
Her son has also stopped playing football and her daughter has given up 
gymnastics because the exertion increases the risk of an aneurysm forming. 
</P>
<P>
The Philadelphia team does not expect precisely the same genetic defect to be 
present in other families with a history of aneurysms. Previous studies on much 
rarer genetic disorders that are also caused by collagen III defects suggest 
that each family will have its own unique defect, said Gerard Tromp, another 
member of the Philadelphia team. 
</P>
<P>
But it is possible, he added, that a small group of genetic defects will 
account for most families, thereby making screening easier. Their saliva test 
is now being used by many other laboratories to determine if the same genetic 
defect is present in any other families, Tromp added, but they have not 
received any results yet. 
</P>
<P>
Even if a very large number of defects are eventually found, he added, the team 
is developing techniques that would enable each family's unique defect to be 
discovered in a very short time. He predicted that the tests could be in wide 
use within as little as two years.

ART OF FROZEN LAND COMES TO LIFE;

MUSEUM: THE TRAVELING U.S.-SOVIET EXHIBITION IS A VISUAL FEAST, THE STORY OF AN 
UNVISITED PAST.

Images of an isolated culture: 
</P>
<P>
Carved faces that fishermen fixed to their boats to bring luck. Hats of ivory 
and wood to lend strength to the hunter. A funeral coat of seal fur and 
tassels, meant to placate the dogs that guard the Land of the Dead. 
</P>
<P>
For thousands of years, the people of the North Pacific flourished in a frozen 
land. These Siberians, Aleuts and Eskimos were ignored by peoples that 
inhabited warmer climes to the south. 
</P>
<P>
When European explorers traveled north, beginning in the mid-1700s, they were 
astonished by the sophistication and beauty they found in large villages in the 
North Pacific. Researchers began to collect artifacts and piece together a 
history of this region. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't until recently that the two countries with the largest North 
Pacific collections -- the Soviet Union and United States -- agreed to share 
their knowledge. The result is "Crossroads of Continents," a traveling 
Smithsonian Institution exhibition now at the Gene Autry Western Heritage 
Museum in Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
More than 600 artifacts are displayed, including clothing and jewelry, tools 
and weapons, toys and ceremonial regalia. The art of the North Pacific is seen 
in the design and decoration of everyday items. The exhibit is a visual feast, 
the story of an unvisited past. 
</P>
<P>
"Scientists call the North Pacific the 'Mediterranean of the Arctic,' " said 
James H. Nottage, the Autry's chief curator. "It has a rich and complex 
culture." 
</P>
<P>
The culture is also quite foreign, with images of animal gods and shamanistic 
ritual. And because aging and delicate artifacts would be damaged by bright 
light, the exhibit space is eerily dark. 
</P>
<P>
You see a St. Lawrence Island warrior with his wing-like shield and armored 
skirt. You see the salmon-skin coat of the Nanai people, appliqued with figures 
drawn from Chinese mythology (a visual remnant of the time when, thousands of 
years ago, Asians walked to the New World across the temporarily dry Bering 
Strait). 
</P>
<P>
Preparations for "Crossroads" began in 1977, when anthropologists from the 
Smithsonian and the Soviet Academy of Sciences agreed to join forces on the 
project. They gathered artifacts from the Museum of Anthropology and 
Ethnography in Leningrad, the Smithsonian, the American Museum of Natural 
History in New York City and other museums in the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the items had never before been shown in North America. Some had 
remained in storage for hundreds of years, since the earliest explorations of 
the North Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists also collaborated on a summary film that portrays 20th-Century 
developments in Siberian and Alaskan cultures. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit opened at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C., and will move on to 
Anchorage, Ottawa and Leningrad. It has stopped over at the Autry as part of an 
ongoing relationship between the Smithsonian and the Griffith Park museum. 
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with the main exhibit, a "hands-on" exhibit has opened in an 
ancillary gallery. Children can touch and play with numerous replicas, 
including a Northwest Coast Indian long house and a large variety of bird and 
animal replicas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crossroads of Continents" continues through Feb. 24. The Gene Autry Western 
Heritage Museum is at 4700 Zoo Drive. Hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday 
through Sunday. Admission to this exhibit is $7.50, $6 for seniors and 
students, $4.50 for children under 13. For information call (213) 667-2000.

EILEEN LIZER IS A KNOW-IT-ALL AND SHE'S GOOD AT IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RIP RENSE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES Rense is a regular contributor to Valley 
Calendar.

<P>
Need a straitjacket? Want to know when the most recent sighting of the rare 
nurse shark occurred? The last time the Ikeya-Seki comet flew by? Looking for 
information about an obscure disease? A vintage rickshaw? An out-of-print book 
about Vietnam? 
</P>
<P>
Call Eileen Lizer. 
</P>
<P>
"A production company will call me up," Lizer said, "and say, 'Help! My project 
is due tomorrow, or in eight days, and I need to know what the weather was like 
in a little tiny town in northern China in the year 605 AD. In addition, I need 
to know who was in power at the time, and what kind of shoes that they wore!' 
Well, I find out." 
</P>
<P>
She really does too -- the more esoteric the request, the better. Some call her 
a "wizard of information" or a "findologist." Others -- like KABC Talk Radio 
institution Michael Jackson, for whom Lizer booked guests for seven years -- 
term her "extraordinary at what she does." Actress June Lockhart said Lizer is 
"somewhere between a researcher and a private eye." Susan Wilcox, personal 
assistant to John Ritter, said the woman tracks things down with a 
"single-mindedness that's unique." 
</P>
<P>
Clients like Alison Holt of Berkemer and Klein public relations, refer to her 
simply as "Rolodex Head." 
</P>
<P>
Lizer takes it as a compliment. 
</P>
<P>
"We call her that because she has so many phone numbers memorized," Holt said. 
"You'll say to her, 'Eileen, do you know this particular source?' And she'll 
know his direct number, home number and personal information, so you can call 
and say, 'Oh, I hear you just had a baby' and that sort of thing. I don't know 
anyone else who does just this. I mean, a lot of times researchers are in just 
one category -- like they only do sports or entertainment or whatever. Eileen 
can do anything." 
</P>
<P>
Public relations firms and movie production companies and just plain folks 
regularly call upon Lizer. 
</P>
<P>
It's true that Lizer routinely rattles off phone numbers from memory -- often 
supplying (with permission) a person's two separate home phones, two or three 
separate work numbers and the mobile phone. It isn't just that she has a 
photographic memory. She's utterly dedicated to her work. She revels in the 
challenge of it all -- or, as Lockhart put it, "she loves the chase." 
</P>
<P>
This effervescent, ebullient thirtysomething woman lights up at the prospect of 
answering any question. 
</P>
<P>
Lockhart, who first met Lizer while a guest on the Jackson program, explained: 
"I needed some research work done on a story that I was interested in for a 
movie about a turn-of-the-century murderess in Indiana -- a very colorful 
character who did away with lots of husbands. I was sort of stymied as to where 
to find it and got Eileen on the case, and she did it in five hours. Got the 
books, newspaper clippings about the trial -- everything. I mean, it was really 
just amazing. She just has this dogged determination, and she loves the chase! 
And I think with this kind of a profession, that's what you really need to 
have, somebody who just has to find the answer. Has to have it. To be fully 
satisfied, you know? She's a gem." 
</P>
<P>
It all started on the "Ken and Bob Company," the popular KABC morning radio 
program (now "Ken and Barkley Company") that Lizer helped produce. One day, 
co-host Ken Minyard decided to track down old girlfriends of the program's 
staff -- most of whom had not been seen or heard from since about 1940. Lizer 
found all eight in one week. 
</P>
<P>
"It was amazing how fast she did it," co-host Bob Arthur said. "And a little 
embarrassing too. It seemed she had a talent for this sort of work." 
</P>
<P>
"We got them on the air," Lizer said, "and Ken and Bob were so thrilled that, 
afterward, Ken came to me and said, 'Have you ever thought about doing this for 
a living?' " 
</P>
<P>
No, she hadn't. But the former welfare worker with an undergraduate degree in 
childhood education started thinking about it. And after leaving her career in 
radio in the late '80s, she started doing it. 
</P>
<P>
How does she do it? Is it as simple as making a couple of lucky phone calls? 
Not really. Lizer's years of booking guests on the Jackson show -- finding 
people who could speak authoritatively on issues of the day, at a moment's 
notice -- proved an invaluable course in research. Sure, other professional 
researchers effectively tap into computer data banks and library files -- but 
if stymied there, many often either give up or spend months in the search. 
Lizer's international network of contacts -- filed mostly in her head -- made 
while working in radio give her an immense backup system. 
</P>
<P>
Add to this the fact that she is a charismatic speaker -- strangers routinely 
find themselves comfortably revealing personal information -- and obscure 
information doesn't really seem to stand much of a chance of staying obscure. 
This is, after all, the woman who managed to come up with Soviet leader Mikhail 
Gorbachev's entire U.S. itinerary in about an hour as a favor to a public 
relations firm that had an idea for using Gorbachev in a promotion. (Is the 
Secret Service reading this?) 
</P>
<P>
Good finders, she insists, are hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, I do know that there are such things as information brokers," Lizer 
said. "That's what they call themselves. That's not what I call myself. They 
are all probably computer wizards -- with modems and this, that and the other 
-- and they charge from $60 to $100 per hour. I charge -- actually my rates 
just went up -- $50 an hour, plus expenses. I feel comfortable charging that 
because I'm fast. I can do things in four or five hours that it takes maybe 
days for somebody else to do." 
</P>
<P>
It's true. Consider the time she was asked by Time magazine (where she assisted 
the Los Angeles bureau) to perform the odd task of finding a housewife who used 
an overnight mail service more than 20 times in a year. She flipped through the 
old cerebral Rolodex and came up with Tracy Laffer, wife of economist Arthur 
Laffer. Then there was the time a movie studio needed five straitjackets. Lizer 
found that they are no longer manufactured; they've been replaced by 
"restraints." Still, she came up with all five between an obscure medical 
supply house and a costume company. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the time a kosher Chinese restaurant had her locate an antique 
rickshaw. There was the time she was asked by a Hollywood producer to come up 
with an out-of-print war history book published only in Germany. The producer's 
assistant gave up after seven months of searching. Lizer found the book in 
three hours. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't incompetent," she said. "It was obscure and hard to find and out 
of print, and they looked at all the foreign language bookstores here. I found 
it in the public library in a less well-used branch in the Pasadena area. I 
just started calling. One of my sources tipped me off and said that you'll find 
things in these smaller branches where you think nothing exists." 
</P>
<P>
There there was the time she was asked by a private investigator to find a 
hit-and-run driver. The private investigator had given up after weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him if he ever uses people who don't have a P.I. license, and he said, 
yes, as long as I don't do things that require a license. He said he'd give me 
$30 to find this person's address. And a half-hour later, I had the address. I 
went to the post office at the federal building in Westwood, asked a postal 
worker behind the counter to supply me with information under the Freedom of 
Information Act. I called the P.I. back and he was just blown away." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Lizer said, she does not aspire to be Philip Marlowe's gofer. Most of what 
she does is more lighthearted and off the cuff. John Ritter, for example, once 
commissioned Lizer to find out what she could about a rare disease called 
synesthesia. His assistant, Susan Wilcox, stalled out after a couple of phone 
calls that yielded nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"John read an article about it," Wilcox said. "It was about cross-connection of 
the senses, and it was called synesthesia. Usually, babies outgrow it, but a 
few grown-ups continue to experience it, like Rimsky-Korsakov. John was 
intrigued by it. I called the media lab at MIT, and they'd never heard of it. 
They gave me the title of a book that might explain it, and I went to a 
bookstore and looked that up, and there was nothing about synesthesia. So I 
called Eileen Lizer. And that evening she had two pages of computer printout -- 
including a list of the contacts that she had made -- I think about eight 
different professors at various branches of the University of California. Had 
the name of a book, author and resume of the subject matter. It was amazing." 
</P>
<P>
Lizer is more modest about her accomplishments. "Certainly there's no special 
genius involved. I'll tell you what it is -- I love doing it. I will not stop 
until I find it. It's as simple as that."

TV SOAP STARS' SALUTE TO BROADWAY BENEFITS SANTA SUSANA TROUPE

<P>
The Santa Susana Repertory Company had something of a topsy-turvy 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Embarking on its second year, the Simi Valley theater troupe found itself still 
without a home and looking for performing space on a production-to-production 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
Its artistic director, Lane Davies, left his role on the NBC daytime drama 
"Santa Barbara" and spent seven months traveling the world, so the company 
offered an abbreviated season of just two productions. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, it shouldn't surprise anyone that Santa Susana Repertory's year-end 
fund-raiser will lean toward the eclectic. "A Broadway Benefit" will feature 
more than a dozen soap-opera actors in an afternoon variety show that includes 
everything from Shakespeare to Cole Porter to Abbott and Costello. The show 
will be presented at Canoga Park High School. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a loose and fun show," said Davies, having returned to Los Angeles. 
"People will certainly get to see daytime stars in a light they've never seen 
them in before." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Runyeon, who plays Michael on "Santa Barbara," will play classical piano. 
Joe Marinelli and Todd McKee, also of "Santa Barbara," will perform the famous 
comedy skit "Who's on First?" Terry Lester, who took over Davies' role as Mason 
Capwell on "Santa Barbara" and is a veteran of "The Young and the Restless," 
and Wally Kurth, from "Days of Our Lives," will sing show tunes. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these people have done little or no singing," Davies said. "There will 
definitely be an improvisational feel to the day." 
</P>
<P>
The benefit will also include a silent auction of personal items from the 
actors and an autograph session. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Susana Repertory Company, which produced "Romeo and Juliet" earlier this 
year, will finish its season with "A Christmas Carol" at the Bellwood Shopping 
Center in Simi Valley beginning Nov. 30. The play will run weekends through 
Dec. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Broadway Benefit" is at 1 p.m. Saturday at Canoga Park High School, 6850 
Topanga Canyon Blvd. Tickets are $25. Call (805) 582-9000.

FIRST PERSON: HELLO, L.A. -- DO YOU MISS FEISTY OL' HERALD EX? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDY FURILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dear L.A., 
</P>
<P>
Everything OK down there? I really missed you at first, in the months after the 
death of the Herald Examiner where I was a reporter for the better part of 
eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Now I'm looking at you from a distance again, a Downey boy exiled to San 
Francisco, where I went to work for the Examiner when the Herald folded. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 1, 1989, when it was announced that the next day's Herald would be its 
last, I felt sad, but also relieved. Finally, I could get on with my life, no 
longer tied to the fate of the paper I loved. But I drank myself sick that 
night at the bar across the street from the Herald -- Corky's, which itself has 
since perished. No other place will ever match the fury and craziness of 
working there. 
</P>
<P>
What's it like being a one-newspaper town? Do you miss that spirit of newspaper 
competition that makes people get up in the morning and wonder just what is 
going on out there and who's finding it out? 
</P>
<P>
OK, the Herald wasn't the best newspaper in the country. I'm sure we overplayed 
some stories and took a pass on others we should have gone nuts about. Like 
Watermelon Bo, a ghetto kid who made millions dealing cocaine for the Cali drug 
cartel. I think I got a nosebleed the morning I read that story in the Los 
Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
So why didn't we have it in the Herald? Oh, easy answer. We didn't have a 
federal court reporter! We only had about 20 or 25 reporters at that time, 
covering a city of 3.4 million, so federal court got dropped occasionally, and 
sometimes we paid for it. 
</P>
<P>
I really loved it when I started working for the Herald. I had Herald in my 
blood, thanks to my dad, Bud Furillo, who put in 28 years there, the last 10 as 
sports editor. Even after moving over to The Times, I couldn't exorcise the 
Herald demon. Al Albergate, then the spokesman for the L.A. District Attorney's 
office, told me on my shift back to the Herald, "Congratulations on your 
bizarre move." 
</P>
<P>
What a ride once I got aboard the Herald back in July, 1981. What stories to 
cover! 
</P>
<P>
Holdout Raider juror talks after reporter's all-night vigil on doorstep. (That 
got me off the graveyard shift.) . . . Ex-Marine kills girlfriend, three kids; 
ex-Marine's brother-in-law pushes me down stairway. . . . Belushi dies, Herald 
blames LAPD. . . . Bloomingdale mistress Vicki Morgan slain. . . . Gang murder 
-- gang murder -- gang murder -- gang murder. 
</P>
<P>
You were one helluva news town, L.A., and in the Herald, you had a paper that 
delivered the news from an appropriately zany perspective. 
</P>
<P>
There's one story I'll always remember that said a lot about the Herald. We 
still had afternoon home delivery then, in 1981, and our morning headline that 
day was something to the effect that the Justice Department was declaring 
martial law to stop a crime wave sweeping the nation. 
</P>
<P>
That morning, on Santa Monica Boulevard in Century City, some punk kids filled 
up a fire extinguisher with water and hosed down a lady at an RTD bus stop. The 
bus came by and she got on, dripping wet. She told the driver and other 
passengers about what happened. Suddenly, the driver spotted the kids filling 
the extinguisher again in a gas station. He stopped, and everybody got off the 
bus and surrounded the kids and held them until the police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Big deal, I thought. But Ron Kaye, our morning city editor, went nuts about the 
story and made me chase it and find the lady and the bus driver and everybody 
else, which I did, not knowing exactly why. Our afternoon banner headline: "Bus 
Riders Turn Crime Fighters." 
</P>
<P>
I still didn't get it, until Kaye and another assistant city editor, Barbara 
Anderson, told me over beers that night just why the story was important. It 
had something to do with ordinary people doing extraordinary things, something 
about how to stay free in paranoid times. The Herald looked for those kinds of 
stories, made banner headlines out of them, while The Times -- focused on the 
weighty matters of the day -- turned them into Southland Briefs. 
</P>
<P>
We did our best and kept The Times honest, or at least we thought we did. But 
in fact, The Times sort of ignored us, unless it couldn't anymore, like on the 
Tom Bradley story. 
</P>
<P>
When the Herald died, other papers and wire services called us "feisty." I 
hated that. Feisty implies some little guy kicking a big guy in the shins. I 
like to think we landed a few on the jaw. 
</P>
<P>
But L.A., you let us die anyway, and maybe it was for the best. Just before the 
end, most of our best people had quit. We were only a shell of the paper that 
once had great writers and the best sports section. 
</P>
<P>
You might plead innocent and argue that our death was actually suicide by 
mismanagement. Maybe you would have a case. But it really doesn't matter if you 
get off on that technicality, because since the Herald died, a part of you 
died, and you're not the same anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Good luck, L.A.

PAPP REJECTS THE NEA AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
GRANTS: CONGRESS SOFTENS OBSCENITY STAND, BUT PRODUCER SAYS ARTISTS ARE STILL 
VULNERABLE. 
</P>

In what may signal a new kind of trouble for the National Endowment for the 
Arts, New York theater producer Joseph Papp said Thursday he will reject 
$323,000 in NEA grants despite action by Congress scrapping most content 
controls on endowment-funded work. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, CalArts in Valencia said that because of the recent 
congressional action, it would resubmit to its board for reconsideration a 
previously undisclosed decision -- reached Oct. 8 -- to reject $43,000 in NEA 
grants. 
</P>
<P>
CalArts officials said they would closely follow policy developments at the NEA 
in the near future and could still turn down the money. 
</P>
<P>
Papp scheduled a New York press conference to announce his latest NEA grant 
rejection. He said he planned to call NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer and 
inform him of the decision before he met with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Papp turned down $49,000 in NEA funding to the Festival Latino of his 
New York Shakespeare Festival, declaring that obscenity-control wording in the 
NEA's 1990 appropriation bill amounted to an unconstitutional incursion on 
artistic freedom of expression. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview early Thursday morning, Papp said he was taking the 
new action because supposedly content control-free NEA legislation passed just 
a week ago still leaves artists dangerously vulnerable to action by what could 
become a government "arts police." Papp's decision Thursday was the largest 
single rejection of NEA money since the controversy began last year. Since 
then, more than 30 grants totaling more than $750,000 have been turned down. 
</P>
<P>
Congress recently approved bills appropriating $180 million to the NEA this 
year and extending its life three more years. The new legislation removes last 
year's obscenity restriction, substituting a requirement that the endowment 
recoup funds if a grantee's work is found obscene by a criminal appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, however, also includes a provision some attorneys and even one 
of the bill's key congressional sponsors have branded as possibly 
unconstitutional. It requires the NEA to put regulations into effect to make 
certain grants will not support indecent work or art that shows disrespect for 
American values. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think that the NEA is going to sit quietly by and not scrupulously 
examine, re-examine, test, investigate every damned kind of application?" Papp 
said. Frohnmayer, he said, "is not going to want to be in the position where 
one of his grantees gets to the courts. What you are going to have here is a 
kind of an arts police setup. All of the buzzwords are there. Decency has 
replaced obscenity. Neither of them can really be interpreted. 
</P>
<P>
"They are going to have to find various ways to catch it before it gets out 
into the marketplace. They will mercilessly pursue those areas. The author will 
be at his typewriter, having just written, 'She walked in through the door and 
. . .' and an NEA investigator will come in and say, 'And what? You'd better 
figure it out by the end of the day.' " 
</P>
<P>
The turmoil that has beset the NEA for the last 18 months, Papp contended, has 
irreparably damaged the agency. "I knew that the NEA would never be the same 
and it cannot be the same. I will have no association with it." 
</P>
<P>
When Papp rejected his first NEA grant in April, he received an almost 
immediate private gift replacing it from television producer Mark Goodson. Papp 
said Thursday he is not sure how he will replace the recently rejected $323,000 
but that he was concerned that many corporate donors who have traditionally 
supported the arts may be concluding that arts grants are too sensitive and 
open to political assault to warrant continuation of corporate arts programs. 
</P>
<P>
CalArts President Steven D. Lavine, expressing a sentiment that appeared to be 
widespread in the arts community, said artists and arts institutions across the 
country will closely watch policy decisions made at the NEA over the next 
several days and weeks for signs that equilibrium is returning to the troubled 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
The positions by Papp and Lavine appeared to indicate that a mood of wariness 
-- not relief -- had settled over much of the arts community. While many arts 
leaders were relieved that Congress did away with the most restrictive content 
controls over the NEA, Lavine and other observers said the new NEA legislation 
includes provisions that could lead to radical restructuring of the NEA. 
</P>
<P>
"In the changed circumstances, we have to reconvene the executive committee" of 
the board, Lavine said. "There is obviously the potential (in the new laws 
governing the endowment) to improve the workings of the NEA," by streamlining 
procedures and ending controversial practices like the obscenity certification, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But there is equally the potential to distort those workings badly. I think 
the whole arts community is waiting to see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
Lavine and Papp said a meeting of the NEA's advisory National Council on the 
Arts scheduled to begin today offers an opportunity to assess policy directions 
at the agency. The arts council meeting had been scheduled long in advance, but 
took on new significance after the action by Congress to approve, without 
change, an NEA reauthorization bill most observers had presumed would be 
significantly altered. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which is to conclude Saturday afternoon, may consider whether the 
NEA will continue to require that grant recipients sign an anti-obscenity 
certification before receiving funds. 
</P>
<P>
While the $323,000 Papp turned back Thursday represents only a small part of 
his $14-million annual budget, such announcements have become an important 
aspect of symbolic protest against the NEA's political enemies, led by 
conservative politicians and religious groups. 
</P>
<P>
NEA 1990 appropriation legislation that expired at the end of September 
included a provision barring the endowment from supporting obscene work, 
especially projects that include sadomasochistic or homoerotic subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
With a flair that has characterized Papp's seven-month crusade against NEA 
content restrictions, the producer said he would take out a full-page 
advertisement in the New York Times today to further espouse his position. The 
ad, an advance copy of which was obtained by The Times, takes the form of a 
facetious memorandum to the NEA from "Agent A101," an NEA "cultural examiner" 
who reports to Frohnmayer on his investigation of indecent content in plays by 
Shakespeare, Bertolt Brecht and other dramatists to be presented this season at 
Papp's Public theater. 
</P>
<P>
The ad, which concludes, "The correspondence above is imaginary, but the threat 
of censorship is real," also solicits season subscriptions to Public Theater 
productions.

ROSEANNE, SERIOUSLY; 
</P>
<P>
LOVE-HATE RELATIONSHIP WITH TV VIEWERS FUELS ABC'S TOP COMEDIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roseanne Barr, serious and businesslike, settles into a couch in her suite in 
an elegant Westside hotel. It's temporary quarters while she and her husband, 
comedy writer Tom Arnold, wait to move into their new house nearby. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a good day. The national television ratings have come in, and 
Barr's ABC series, "Roseanne," ranks No. 3 among all shows for last week. More 
than 30 million people tuned in. 
</P>
<P>
Barr and Arnold, meanwhile, have just returned to the suite after buying a 
motorcycle. "We got one so I can drive her around," says Arnold. "We rode it 
around the block." Then he departs for most of the next hour, leaving Barr to 
speak for herself. 
</P>
<P>
In two explosive years on ABC, Barr has become an extraordinarily controversial 
show business phenomenon -- the most popular woman performer on TV and, at the 
same time, a public figure with a remarkable knack for getting into hot water. 
The image has worried ABC and her producers because of the high financial 
stakes involved in "Roseanne." 
</P>
<P>
Barr acknowledges the image problem and seems intent on doing something about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
In a wide-ranging interview with The Times, she gave her views on the backstage 
furor surrounding her show, the firings she demanded, Hollywood's snub of her 
at the Emmy Awards, her sometimes risque public behavior and the controversy 
provoked by her screeching rendition of the "Star-Spangled Banner" at a San 
Diego Padres baseball double-header. 
</P>
<P>
She also admitted to her now-legendary outbursts of temper when she felt things 
were going wrong during the production of her half-hour series: 
</P>
<P>
"I have a really long fuse. But once it's gone, everybody's outta there. And I 
have to learn to not do that." 
</P>
<P>
Barr says it is only since the arrival of ABC Entertainment President Bob Iger 
that she is back on working terms with the Carsey-Werner company, which 
produces "Roseanne." Tension had set in when the series' creator, Matt 
Williams, was fired because he and Barr could not agree on the direction of the 
show. Williams now is executive producer of Carol Burnett's NBC series, "Carol 
&amp; Company." 
</P>
<P>
Iger, says Barr, "really was for me, and he understood what I was doing. He 
helped me a lot. He was the first person that really listened to me and heard 
what I was saying and felt I was right -- about everything on the show. I am 
really grateful to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that things are cleared up as well as they're gonna be. I have a 
working relationship now with my producers, Carsey-Werner, which I didn't have 
since Matt was fired." 
</P>
<P>
Above all, Barr is proud of "Roseanne," a blue-collar comedy in which she plays 
a married, working mother. It gives her a weekly forum to continue her stand-up 
comedy thrust of looking at the world through a woman's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people get it -- what I'm saying and doing in the show. I don't think 
the press gets it," says Barr. "The people get that it's really anti-glamour. 
It's really anti-everything that the media tries to shove down our throats. 
It's not about all the traditional things that TV or entertainment is supposed 
to be about. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to fly in the face of all traditional expectations about television, 
women, gender, class. More than anything, I wanted it to be about the class 
system, class distinctions. And I wanted to explode the traditional media image 
of a woman. And family. And work. Everything that the show is hasn't been on TV 
before. 
</P>
<P>
"TV is kind of like a mirror that they hold up to our civilization, but it 
reflects the opposite of the truth. If it was close to the truth, we'd be able 
to swear and go around in our underwear, which I really think would be perfect 
TV." 
</P>
<P>
Barr, who offers a comedy concert tonight at the Universal Amphitheatre, knows 
that both she and "Roseanne" -- which is clearly an extension of herself -- 
divide people into pro and con camps. Why does she think she has that effect? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, because I think the show is two opposite things at once. Somebody called 
it savage and loving. I like that description. That's what human beings are. 
That's what I am. I wanted to show a three-dimensional woman on television, and 
three-dimensional people are at once savage and loving, and at once very 
intellectual and very base. So that's what's in my head. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people just see crude, and some people see the intelligence, and some 
people are really cool and see both of them." 
</P>
<P>
Barr's detractors might regard as crude her public baring of her now-famous 
tattoo, but she says of her impulsive act: "Who cares?" 
</P>
<P>
Why, she wants to know, is the showing of the tattoo "such a big deal"? But she 
does have misgivings about some of the intimate quotes about her personal life 
that have wound up in print: 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I just get carried away if I sit with somebody for too long. I'm a 
real open person anyway. But I've learned not to do four-hour interviews 
because that's what happens. You become friendly. Then you forget you're 
talking to everyone in the world and you think you're just talking to this one 
person." 
</P>
<P>
She says she was "very embarrassed" at some of the vivid personal revelations 
she gave People magazine. But she's nonplussed at the attention paid to her 
rather open displays of affection with Arnold in public, which has resulted in 
more colorful coverage: "I guess for a while I didn't think it would be picked 
up. I watch it more now, but I just never could believe that people cared." 
</P>
<P>
Barr's recent ratings on "Roseanne" -- which had slumped a bit -- prove that 
she has survived all the flack in pretty solid shape, but she says that those 
who put on the series "always had concern" about her image. 
</P>
<P>
"Like, after I showed my tattoo," she recalls, "they said it was going to hurt 
the show. After the People magazine thing, they said it was going to affect my 
ratings. The 'Star-Spangled Banner' isn't the first time that they all said 
that I was self-destructing or that the show was going to go down." 
</P>
<P>
Of last summer's uproar over the national anthem, when she spat on the ground 
and grabbed her crotch -- mimicking the actions of ballplayers -- she says: 
</P>
<P>
"I apologized for anyone being offended. When the President says your act 
sucks, that's pretty much taking a beating. But I know there's been fallout 
from it. I think most people that like me got what I did. But I know that 
people who didn't like me before really don't like me now." 
</P>
<P>
Barr is not popular with the Hollywood Establishment, either, and she knows it. 
Despite the enormous success of "Roseanne," for which she is principally 
responsible, she has yet to be nominated for an Emmy. Is she upset? 
</P>
<P>
"The first year it really bothered me. The first year it really hurt, because I 
didn't understand. But after that, I didn't care anymore because I found out 
that you nominate yourself and you have to pay a certain amount of money, and 
then it just seemed all phony. It seemed like just another infrastructure, 
self-congratulatory thing." 
</P>
<P>
(An Emmy Awards official says that entrants who submit their work to be 
considered for nominations must pay a small fee, although there is no charge 
for first-time candidates who are members of the Academy of Television Arts 
&amp; Sciences.) 
</P>
<P>
Barr says she understands that the awards are "for television and everything, 
but I kind of felt it was a compliment after the second year that I never got 
nominated. I mean, of course I'd rather have everybody like me, but I care more 
that the viewers like the show than I do about awards." 
</P>
<P>
Does Barr think the Emmy snubbing was personal? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah. The first year I do because there was also this controversy because I 
fired Matt. And I didn't do any interviews for like a year after Matt was 
fired. That was the thing that started me having bad feelings about the press 
because when I did speak, they would never give my side." 
</P>
<P>
Barr concedes that she was coming across like a heavy: "Yeah. And that really 
bothered me." But she says she was advised that "if I didn't say anything, it 
would die down. So I let it go a really long time, so that this image took on a 
life of its own. It became like an avalanche. And I wish I had stopped it 
sooner because when I did speak out about it, it was too late." 
</P>
<P>
But Williams wasn't the only person bounced by Barr. Jeff Harris soon was gone 
as executive producer. Others departed. Stories circulated of a nightmarish 
atmosphere behind the scenes on "Roseanne." Barr, however, maintains that 
everything stemmed from her not getting the best deal or protection in the 
first place: "Everything is that simple. I would keep getting lawyers and 
people that tried to get things better and better, and in fact nothing worked. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a lot of mistakes in people I trusted. But that's just the Hollywood 
story, and that's just what happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
But what about Barr's part in the scenario? Isn't she also pretty difficult? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I probably was difficult to work with, now looking back," she says. "I 
had a very tough time making myself clear because I didn't speak 
corporate-speak and I didn't speak show business. There's a whole language 
called show business. You don't talk that way in any other state in the union. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I was as especially clear as I could have been. It's like being 
a woman and an administrator -- I never had any background like that. I didn't 
know how, like I do now, to go in and say, 'This is what I want you to do.' I 
think that's common with women in business. I would go in there and try to get 
them to agree with me rather than tell them what I want to do. 
</P>
<P>
"I just let things build up and build up and build up until I'd blow. I think I 
took too much (stuff) for too long and then blew up. Now I realize that my 
responsibility is to not let that happen again. When you get screwed over -- 
and I got screwed over a lot -- you get maybe a little too paranoid. Now, I 
still will have blowups, but the people working on the show, and Bob Iger, 
they'll listen to me, so I don't get so frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to have people I trust that go, 'You're wrong here, you don't see it 
right,' instead of, 'Well, if you had any . . . talent. . . .' And I did deal 
with people who were talking to me that way." 
</P>
<P>
Will Hollywood and the rebel Barr ever find common ground? She's been free with 
her critical views of the town. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I'm a comedian," she says, adding in her trademark dry, flat delivery, 
"I'm not gonna go and get real grateful. It's part of my act. Of course I would 
say things like, 'Thanks for the money -- I hate the town.' " 
</P>
<P>
But does she mean it? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, in a way. But I've said that what disgusts me also attracts me here 
because I really do think it's cool that, considering what I came out of, I'm 
allowed to speak and work on projects that hopefully have something good to 
say. But I'm really a reclusive person. That's why I don't go to Hollywood 
things. It's not that I hate anybody. I feel a real difference between myself 
and other people. I just don't mix well." 
</P>
<P>
Barr says she's quite serious about her publicized desire to move her series to 
Minneapolis in several years -- and not, she adds, just to get away from the 
tabloid reporters with whom she has a running feud: 
</P>
<P>
"I just like it in Minneapolis. That's where I met Tom, and we have friends 
there. We're Midwestern people. It's a slower pace, a little less hectic. And I 
miss seasons. And I miss the Midwestern-type people. I get too tense here." 
</P>
<P>
Does that perhaps contribute to her blowups? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, maybe it does. I'm in a real high-pressure business, and all the 
pressure's on me. I don't suppose the pressures of that would be any less in 
Minnesota. But at least if I got in my car and wanted to go drive somewhere to 
blow it off, I wouldn't be going three miles an hour on the dead-stop freeway."

TAVERNIER AND NOIRET: SOLDIERS OF FORTUNE; 
</P>
<P>
FILM: DIRECTOR AND ACTOR JOIN FORCES IN 'LIFE AND NOTHING BUT' TO TRACE THE 
FATE OF 350,000 FRENCH TROOPS AFTER WORLD WAR I. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Life and Nothing But" has brought director Bertrand Tavernier and actor 
Philippe Noiret to the pinnacles of their careers, which are very high indeed. 
Tavernier's " 'Round Midnight," set in the Paris jazz scene, and Giuseppe 
Tornatore's "Cinema Paradiso," in which Noiret played the fatherly small-town 
projectionist, are not only their most recent films seen in America but also 
their biggest international successes. 
</P>
<P>
Now, they have teamed for the fifth time, with Noiret portraying a formidable 
but lonely officer obsessed with accounting for the 350,000 French soldiers 
missing in action at the end of World War I. "Life and Nothing But" is set 
primarily on the battlefield of Verdun in 1920 and involves an elegant woman 
(Sabine Azema) searching for her husband. The heart of the matter is the 
unexpected impact this man and woman have upon each other. 
</P>
<P>
"The film has been a great success everywhere it has played -- and that is my 
revenge, because it was so difficult to get financing," said Tavernier, during 
a recent visit to Los Angeles with Noiret to promote the film. "I've wanted to 
do this film since Philippe and I made 'Coup de Torchon.' We were making that 
film in this very small town in Senegal, and we met the president of their 
World War I veterans organization. 
</P>
<P>
"He was 82 or 83 at the time and told us incredible stories about that period. 
He stayed in Verdun and in the east of France one or two years after the war. 
He told us about the women who would come to the battlefield searching for 
their husbands or brothers or fathers or at least some token of them. This 
image stayed in my mind. Then one day I read in a book that in 1920 there were 
still 350,000 soldiers missing in action! That's the equivalent of the total 
number of men in the French army today! 
</P>
<P>
"How did they go about trying to find these missing persons? How did they find 
clues? What if a man was an amnesiac or a deserter? How did they choose the 
Unknown Soldier for burial at the Arc de Triomphe? When I learned that they 
took only three days to do this, it gave me and my writer Jean Cosmos a time 
period, a shape. From this we could build the film emotionally." 
</P>
<P>
Tavernier said that he and Cosmos saw it as more as a story about life than 
death, about the process of rediscovering peace and happiness. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it would be full of life, hope, energy," Tavernier said. "We made a 
list of characters. One of them, a minor character, was an officer in charge of 
the search for the dead. For me, he was the hero, someone obsessed, living in 
the world of death, fighting against the Establishment, trying to prevent 
people from forgetting. This character came out from the background and imposed 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
Tavernier said he saw the part as sort of an American Western hero, like John 
Wayne in "The Searchers," and that it was written with Noiret in mind, even 
though it was unlike anything the actor had done in more than 100 films. Noiret 
was game for the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"Bertrand brought all the drafts to me at my country home," said Noiret. "Of 
course, I said yes. 'When do you want to do it?' For me, it is first the 
script, then the character, and I was very, very happy to be working with 
Bertrand again. Also to have something with a bit of romance, passion. I will 
be 60 in a few months, maybe it's my last romantic part." 
</P>
<P>
It was Noiret who made it possible for Tavernier, a former publicist and 
historian, to become a film director. In the early '70s, Tavernier sent Noiret 
an adaptation of Georges Simenon's "The Clockmaker of St. Paul," which he had 
co-written with Jean Aurenche and Pierre Bost, and when Noiret agreed to star 
in it, Tavernier got his first directing job. The film was released in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
The two men have worked so often together since that they communicate almost by 
shorthand. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's say that I don't have to explain motivation for the character for 45 
minutes to Philippe before we can begin the scene," said Tavernier. "I don't 
know why directing actors has to be difficult. . . . We have fun, but that 
doesn't mean we don't work hard." 
</P>
<P>
"All discussion should be (conducted) long before the shooting," added Noiret. 
"So many crises on the set have less to do with filmmaking than with power. You 
feel no amour-propre, no shame with Bertrand. You can be free. He will tell you 
if you're not going in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want people to be afraid to look stupid, and I want the right to make 
mistakes," said Tavernier. "Everybody should get into the soul of the film." 
</P>
<P>
Since completing "Life and Nothing But" over a year ago, Tavernier has 
completed "Daddy Nostalgy," a family drama starring Dirk Bogarde and Jane 
Birkin and inspired by Tavernier's former in-laws. The busy Noiret has made 
three films, including a sequel to the hit police comedy "My New Partner," and 
will next reteam with Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore. 
</P>
<P>
Noiret will also co-star with countryman Gerard Depardieu in Claude Berri's 
adaptation of Marcel Ayme's "Uranus." As for now, Tavernier and Noiret, whose 
films together have all been marked by complexity and intense emotional impact, 
have no plans to work together again. "It's too soon," said Tavernier. "We need 
a break," added Noiret.

Tickets for a second Bruce Springsteen-Bonnie Raitt-Jackson Browne benefit 
concert at the Shrine Auditorium will go on sale Saturday under a "restricted" 
system that concert sponsors hope will make it harder for scalpers to get 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the 8 p.m. performance on Nov. 17 will benefit the 
Washington-based Christic Institute, an interfaith nonprofit center for law and 
public policy. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Campbell, director of Avocado Productions, said his office received 
complaints about ticket scalping last month when seating for the Nov. 16 date 
at the Shrine sold out in 45 minutes. At that time, tickets were sold at the 
Shrine box office, 80 Ticketron locations and also by phone. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the second concert -- priced at $25, $50 and $100 -- will go on 
sale at 9 a.m. Saturday exclusively at Tower Records' Ticketron outlets in 
Anaheim, Brea, El Toro, Hollywood, Lakewood, Northridge, Panorama City, 
Thousand Oaks, Torrance, West Covina and Westwood. A strict 4-ticket limit will 
be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
This time, no tickets will be available at the Shrine Auditorium box office and 
no phone orders will be taken. Priority number wristbands -- 200 per outlet -- 
will be distributed randomly at 8 a.m. No one will be allowed to line up at any 
Tower Ticketron location before 7 a.m. Extra security will be at all locations 
to monitor sales and to make sure that no favoritism is shown and that the 
tickets go to people in line, Campbell said. CHUCK PHILIPS

BARR TO STAR IN ABC MOVIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABC broadened its relationship with its highest-rated star Thursday, signing 
Roseanne Barr and her husband, Tom Arnold, to produce a TV movie, a special and 
a series for the network. 
</P>
<P>
She will star in the movie and special, but the series is not intended to 
feature her, the network said. All three will be produced by the couple's 
Barnold Productions. 
</P>
<P>
"Her success has contributed greatly to our success and we're delighted to 
extend that partnership to new creative areas in the future," ABC Entertainment 
President Robert Iger said.

Rohr plant in Texas -- A wire service story in the Business section on Tuesday 
erroneously reported that a new Rohr Industries plant in San Marcos, Tex., is a 
joint venture with General Electric. Actually, the plant is operated by a 
wholly owned Rohr Industries subsidiary. The plant's correct size is 168,000 
square feet, not 140,000 square feet, as reported by United Press

MANUFACTURING ACTIVITY EBBS TO AN 8-YEAR LOW; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: REPORTS THAT BUSINESS FAILURES ROSE SHARPLY AS CONSTRUCTION DECLINED 
ALSO FUEL FEARS THAT A RECESSION IS NEAR.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A series of economic statistics released Thursday reinforced fears that the 
nation may be heading into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
A monthly survey of manufacturing activity hit its lowest level since the 1982 
recession, housing and office construction posted its biggest decline in nearly 
nine years, the rate of business failures rose ominously and farm production 
costs surged. 
</P>
<P>
Taken together, the statistics provided fresh evidence that the nation is on 
the brink of recession. They tended to overshadow a report issued earlier in 
the week indicating that the economy expanded at a respectable rate during the 
third quarter of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
In one key indicator of a declining economy, the National Assn. of Purchasing 
Managers reported that its composite index of manufacturing activity fell to 
43.3% in October from 44.4% the previous month. October's reading was the 
lowest in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
The association, which surveys purchasing executives at 300 industrial 
companies every month, considers any reading below 50% an indication that the 
nation's goods-producing industries are contracting. 
</P>
<P>
The group's declining readings have been borne out by government employment 
statistics: Some 500,000 factory jobs have been lost since the 1980s expansion 
peaked in January, 1989. In September alone, manufacturing employment fell by 
65,000. 
</P>
<P>
The purchasers association said a secondary index measuring new orders for 
industrial production fell to 43.8% from 44.5%, while another index measuring 
production fell to 43.0% from 45.1%. Both secondary readings also were at their 
lowest levels since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said spending on new construction 
fell 2.8% in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $429 billion, 
the largest monthly decline since January, 1982. September's spending was 1.1% 
lower than a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The report confirmed previous indications that America's housing and office 
construction sector already is in a deep recession. Earlier this week, the 
department said sales of new single-family homes fell 6% in September. 
</P>
<P>
Private-sector construction spending fell to an annual rate of $319 billion in 
September from $326 billion in August. Government spending, which includes 
everything from schools and hospital construction to road and bridge repairs, 
fell to $109 billion from $115 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of business bankruptcies jumped 14.5% nationwide during 
the first nine months of 1990, with the largest increases in New England and 
Middle Atlantic states, according to a survey by Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, 43,836 American businesses failed through September, up from 38,296 
during the same period in 1989, the business information firm reported. Higher 
failure rates were reported in every industry group except mining. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest regional increase was posted in New England, where failures soared 
by 193%. In the Middle Atlantic region, failures increased 65%. The state 
posting the biggest gain in failures was Massachusetts, where bankruptcies more 
than tripled. 
</P>
<P>
Only two areas posted declining rates of business failures: the East North 
Central region and the Pacific region, which includes California. Dun &amp; 
Bradstreet attributed the improvements to demand for exports from those areas. 
</P>
<P>
In yet another early warning signal of more problems ahead, the Agriculture 
Department said farm production costs are surging, reflecting the explosion in 
oil prices caused by the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The department said overall agricultural production costs had risen 2.2% from 
August through October. That was the biggest three-month increase since 1982, 
when the nation was still suffering the inflationary aftermath of the oil 
shocks of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to soaring fuel prices, farmers were squeezed last month by lower 
prices for their production. In all, the agency said, prices for raw products 
from the nation's farms fell 0.7% from September to October. 
</P>
<P>
Government economists project, however, that consumer food prices will rise 5% 
to 7% for the year, compared to a 5.8% increase in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The new statistics follow Tuesday's Commerce Department report that the gross 
national product expanded at a 1.8% annual rate during the third quarter, 
compared to a glacial 0.4% growth rate last spring. 
</P>
<P>
The GNP report confounded expectations that the economy was contracting even 
before the full impact of the Persian Gulf crisis had been felt. Even so, most 
economists remain convinced that at least a mild recession is in store during 
the final quarter of the year.

A BATTLE TO KEEP HOTELS AT BAY

<P>
To build or not to build hotels on San Francisco's waterfront? 
</P>
<P>
That long-simmering issue, one of many facing the city's voters on Election 
Day, has provoked a storm of controversy for the beleaguered Port of San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The self-supporting agency, desperate for new sources of cash to fund freight 
shipping and fishing operations, has endorsed two projects with small hotels 
proposed for rundown piers south of Fisherman's Wharf. The San Francisco Port 
Commission, in fact, has vowed to allow no more than two hotels. 
</P>
<P>
But slow-growth activists fear that the port could change its mind and open the 
floodgates to a wave of tourist hotels that would destroy the flavor of the 
picturesque waterfront and put it off-limits to residents. 
</P>
<P>
They have sponsored an initiative on Tuesday's ballot that would prohibit all 
hotel development within 100 feet of the shoreline and require that the port 
complete a comprehensive land-use plan before further non-maritime development 
could proceed. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think the hotel construction would stop there," said Jack Morrison, a 
former supervisor and slow-growth proponent who helped kill Mayor Art Agnos' 
plan for a downtown ballpark. "The threat is there would be a string of hotels 
north and south of the Ferry Building (the landmark port headquarters building 
at the foot of Market Street)." 
</P>
<P>
At issue are two projects already approved by the port. One is a $70-million 
sailboat harbor, 170-room hotel, museum and conference facility for Piers 24 
and 26, near the base of the Bay Bridge, planned by Koll Co., a developer based 
in Newport Beach. The other is a $120-million cruise terminal, hotel and 
exhibition hall on Piers 30 and 32 that has Scandinavian backing and is aimed 
at beefing up San Francisco's flagging cruise ship business. 
</P>
<P>
The developers contend that they have been sensitive about keeping their 
projects in scale. At 40 feet high, a limit set by the port, both hotels would 
be shorter than existing buildings or bulkheads on the piers. Moreover, one 
member of the Scandinavian team said, the project's architectural firm is Utzon 
Associates of Denmark, designers of the Sydney Opera House. Hotels, both 
developers say, are key to making the projects feasible. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have to have another use that pays for construction of the cruise 
terminal," said Erik Norgaard, president of Scandinavia Center Inc., the group 
behind the cruise terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Port officials say the two projects would provide 1,300 jobs and revenue to 
help pay for improvements to the port's container-shipping facilities. One 
official added that the developments would save the port the cost of tearing 
out rotting piers at the sites. 
</P>
<P>
"To preempt them would be utter foolishness," said James Herman, president of 
the Port Commission and president of the International Longshoremen's and 
Warehousemen's Union. 
</P>
<P>
Both projects have the support of Mayor Art Agnos, who promised as a candidate 
to revitalize the port. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very much opposed to the ban," said Scott Shafer, the mayor's press 
secretary. "Although the intentions may have been noble, the (Proposition H 
backers) have written an initiative that will paralyze the port." 
</P>
<P>
Port Executive Director Michael Huerta contends that the demand for a new 
land-use plan could stymie other projects, such as an aquarium planned for Pier 
39, and freeze the flow of cash as the port is embarking on a $100-million 
overhaul aimed at making it more competitive with Oakland and other West Coast 
ports. The port is already restricted by three land-use plans that prohibit 
housing and office buildings on the waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison countered that a land-use plan could be completed in three to six 
months "if they really set their minds to it." He added that one way the port 
could increase revenues would be to renegotiate leases with existing 
restaurants and shops. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, many San Franciscans contend that they have been burned by past 
developments along the northern waterfront near Fisherman's Wharf. Touted 
originally as projects that would lure city residents, Pier 39, Ghirardelli 
Square and the Cannery cater primarily to tourists. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier efforts to put hotels on the waterfront have met with stiff resistance. 
</P>
<P>
A furor erupted in 1987 when Mayor Dianne Feinstein and port authorities pushed 
for a hotel at Pier 45 as a way to pay for fish-handling facilities. The port 
voted down the hotel idea. 
</P>
<P>
Despite limited funding, Morrison's group appears to be making headway. For 
weeks, volunteers have distributed leaflets door to door and handed out 
brochures at bus stops. 
</P>
<P>
A poll conducted for the San Francisco Chronicle in late October showed 
Proposition H leading among voters, 49% to 35%. 
</P>
<P>
Should it pass, Huerta, for one, is thinking ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're developing waterfronts," he said, "you have to be very patient. . . 
. The port has to look very seriously at writing that (two-hotel) limitation 
into law." 
</P>

CONSUMER AFFAIRS: HOME SECURITY NEEDN'T BE SO ALARMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By S.J. Diamond

<TEXT>
<P>
Looking crazed and vicious, the man is pictured breaking through a door. The 
message is it's a jungle out there, such creeps hit one in four homes, and 
maybe yours. The pitch: for $395, ADT Security Systems will help "keep him 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Residential security is the fastest-growing segment of a young industry. Eighty 
percent of operating security systems were installed in the 1980s, according to 
the Santa Monica-based Security Industry Assn. Residential work provided 
perhaps $2.5 billion of last year's $8.4-billion industry revenue, estimates 
STAT Resources, a Brookline, Mass., market research firm. 
</P>
<P>
Alarm systems are not the only -- or even the best -- defense against the 
jungle out there. But they sound good. 
</P>
<P>
Residential burglary is certainly a problem, whether one considers the 5 
million household burglaries reported annually or the National Crime Prevention 
Council's prediction that in a 20-year period, seven out of 10 households will 
be burglarized at least once. More take place in summer, and in the daytime. 
Many involve drug users, who are more hurried, less clever and less methodical 
than professional burglars. 
</P>
<P>
Someone was home in only one of eight household burglaries; in a third of 
those, the burglar got violent. And yes, homes without alarms are more likely 
to be hit. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, household alarm systems became more readily available and 
cheaper, thanks to new modular systems and sensors that can be produced and 
installed faster and easier. Small contractors jumped in; large national 
companies serving government and industry started residential divisions. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a field of variable sophistication and commitment. The nationals 
boast longevity and Fortune 500 customers. The locals advertise endorsements 
from stores, stars, or in one case (this in Los Angeles), both the police chief 
and a former burglar -- the one against his wishes, the other under who knows 
what arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Most offer a combination of on-site triggers and remote responses. Alarms may 
be set off by someone pushing a manual "panic" button or disturbing magnetic 
contacts on doors and windows ("perimeter" alarms), or moving across the field 
of some kind of sensor. The alarm sounds in the house, the neighborhood, the 
local police station or a monitoring station, where someone calls the police or 
dispatches a private guard. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, these alarms sound too often: The false alarm rate is 95%, 97%, 
even 98%. Some are tripped by forgetful residents. Some are set off by pets, or 
rattling windows, or airplanes passing overhead, or sun shining into the path 
of a sensor. Some are just poorly installed. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, "the assumption is that most of the alarms are false," says Robert 
McCrie, editor of Security Letter and assistant professor at John Jay College 
of Criminal Justice in New York. As a result, busy police stations no longer 
welcome direct hook-ups, many issue fines for repeat false alarms, and some are 
slow to respond even when a security company has checked that no one's home. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors are probably even more annoyed and unresponsive, and even owners seem 
to have a short fuse. One study found that half the residential systems 
installed are turned off after a month. 
</P>
<P>
Along with false alarms, the systems foster "a false sense of security," says 
Jean O'Neil, director of research and policy analysis at the National Crime 
Prevention Council in Washington. Homeowners may leave their house dark, 
surround it with high shrubbery, even open doors and windows. Some more readily 
leave children home alone, because "we have an alarm system." 
</P>
<P>
Consumers who don't buy alarm systems aren't necessarily at the mercy of thugs. 
Since almost any system can be circumvented by a true professional, given 
enough time, the goal is simply to "to make your residence a less attractive 
target," says O'Neil, for both amateurs and professionals. 
</P>
<P>
With that goal, there are many possibilities, starting with good locks, and 
their regular usage: in 20% to 50% of residential burglaries, the burglar 
enters through an unlocked door or window. Building and landscape design can 
prohibit unobserved entry. Lights and noise can suggest that someone is home 
(lamps on, radios playing) or discourage entry (dogs barking, outside 
floodlights). 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors who are home and watchful are the most help, whether they discourage 
entry or just report it, whether they see intruders or hear an alarm. In most 
communities, police will help set up "neighborhood watch" plans -- more 
consciousness-raising than organization, but effective. "We've seen them cut 
burglaries 20%, 30%, even 40%," says O'Neil. 
</P>
<P>
Alarms that ring elsewhere are most useful when homeowners are gone a lot or 
the home and contents are so attractive that thieves would take more chances. 
Also, there may be no neighbors -- either because the dwelling is isolated or 
the people are isolated, their neighbors all strangers. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, turning to alarms first, not last, may be a symptom of today's urban 
isolation. Security companies are only filling a gap, as they will when they 
add monitor features for latchkey children, and medical alert functions for 
elderly people living alone. But no one can expect to replace families, friends 
and neighbors without sounding false alarms.

2 FORMER MERRILL EXECUTIVES CITED FOR ALLEGED KICKBACKS

Two former Merrill Lynch executives were charged Thursday with taking kickbacks 
from contractors during construction in the mid-1980s of the brokerage firm's 
lavish headquarters in Manhattan's World Financial Center. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, Albert Young, 61, the official in charge of Merrill Lynch's move, 
allegedly received at least $140,000. The illegal payments from contractors 
were said to include cash delivered to him personally at the new building, 
payments to a shell company in the Bahamas and money for improvements on 
Young's country home in Pennsylvania. Contractors also allegedly provided him 
with regular use of a stretch limousine and chauffeur. 
</P>
<P>
Court documents charge that construction companies and suppliers were told that 
they had to pay kickbacks to get contracts on the project. The headquarters 
occupies much of a new high-rise building overlooking New York harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Young was named in a four-count criminal information filed in U.S. District 
Court in Manhattan. John Serino Jr., a former Merrill Lynch vice president, and 
Marvin Weiner, an alleged associate of Young's who didn't work for Merrill 
Lynch, each had a single felony charge filed against them. A federal prosecutor 
said all three waived indictment, which usually means the defendants plan to 
plead guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Spiro, a lawyer for Young, declined to comment on whether his client may 
plead guilty. But he noted that Young entered a not guilty plea before a 
federal magistrate. He said Young denies ever having been bribed in connection 
with his employment at Merrill Lynch. Serino's lawyer failed to return a call 
seeking comment Thursday. Weiner's lawyers refused to discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Murphy, a former New York City police commissioner who now is director 
of security for Merrill Lynch, said the firm first discovered irregularities 
when vendors and some Merrill Lynch employees complained to company officials. 
Murphy said the firm investigated and then notified the U.S. Attorney's Office. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said Young resigned from Merrill Lynch in 1988, shortly after receiving 
a subpoena from federal prosecutors. He said Serino lost his job with the firm 
in 1989 as part of companywide layoffs. Murphy said the firm didn't suspect at 
the time that Serino was part of the illegal scheme.

FDIC Rejects Bid for Continental Stake: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has 
rejected a $112-million bid by investors and management for the federal 
agency's 26% stake in Continental Bank Corp., the bank firm said. 
</P>
<P>
The FDIC acquired all of Chicago-based Continental when the bank failed in 1984 
and has slowly been selling it off. The 26% stake is its last chunk. FDIC 
spokesman Alan Whitney said the FDIC board voted 4-0 to reject the bid because 
it "was not in the best interests of the FDIC." He declined to say why.

UnionFed Unit Placed Under Restrictions: Federal thrift regulators ordered Los 
Angeles-based Union Federal Savings Bank to stop paying stock dividends and 
limited its loan-making ability until the institution comes up with an 
acceptable plan to raise more capital, officials said. The Office of Thrift 
Supervision imposed the restrictions on Union Federal, owned by Brea-based 
UnionFed Financial Corp., just two weeks after the parent company was forced to 
restate its yearly earnings to show an $18.1-million loss.

Ross Boosts Stake in Hotel Investors: New York investor Leonard M. Ross said he 
raised his stake in Los Angeles-based Hotel Investors Trust and Hotel Investors 
Corp. to 15.5%. Ross also said he will vote his shares at the hotel firm's Dec. 
20 annual meeting in favor of the proposed sale of its 27 hotels to Park Plaza, 
an affiliate of Japan's EIE International Corp. Ross made an earlier threat to 
solicit proxies to acquire representation on Hotel Investors board, but the 
plan has been put on hold because no date has been scheduled for the elections, 
according to an SEC filing.

Morgan Stanley to Trim Unit: Morgan Stanley said it was laying off about 6%, or 
50 professionals, of its 800-person investment banking division as rumors 
swirled on Wall Street of major cuts at another big firm. The division includes 
mergers and acquisitions, corporate finance, real estate and capital markets -- 
all areas that have been hit hard by the decline in the securities industry 
since the 1987 stock market crash.

A labor lawyer and adviser to striking unions of the Daily News offered 
Thursday to buy the newspaper, but he was rebuffed by its owners. 
</P>
<P>
Theodore Kheel told Tribune Co., the owner of the News, that he had lined up 
investors to help finance the purchase. He also said he could negotiate 
contracts with the unions and work out a joint operating agreement with the New 
York Post. Kheel refused to identify the investors or reveal his buying price. 
Eight of the newspaper's 10 unions struck the News on Oct. 25 over what they 
termed unfair labor practices. They were joined a day later by members of the 
Newspaper Guild.

MARKET BEAT: THE MIDEAST CRISIS MAY BE FADING AS FACTOR IN INVESTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Does Saddam matter anymore? 
</P>
<P>
As the Iraq-Kuwait crisis appears to be building to some kind of resolution -- 
military or peaceful -- more money managers are asking themselves whether they 
care either way. For many, the decision to move back into stocks and/or bonds 
now transcends whatever happens in the Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I think we're in a whole new period for the markets," says Joe 
Perrone, chief investment officer for the $24.5-billion Texas Teachers 
Retirement System in Austin. A resolution in the Mideast, he says, "would be a 
temporary deal, either way." Beyond that, "I look at the psychology of the 
markets, and I don't think there's any question that it's going to get worse." 
</P>
<P>
John DeGroot, portfolio management chief at U.S. Trust of California in Los 
Angeles, also is far less concerned about the Mideast. "I think the Iraq 
situation has been discounted in the market," whatever the outcome, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Only a month or so ago, many investors were clinging to the belief that all 
Wall Street needed was an end to the Iraq-Kuwait stalemate. Either war or peace 
would have sparked a rally, many believed -- because any resolution was better 
than continued uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
Now, more investors are looking deeper into the background of the economy and 
the markets, and they're finding much more to worry about beyond Saddam 
Hussein. Even though it can be argued that Iraq triggered the recession that 
appears to be overtaking the economy, many investors now admit that all the 
Mideast crisis did was expose the weaknesses that had long been underlying the 
stock and bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
"The bigger picture is that we're in a global liquidity crisis," says Martin 
Sass of M. D. Sass Investors in New York. "It's the reversal of the 
debt-creation frenzy of the 1980s." The Mideast crisis may be resolved in a 
week, he said, "but you don't resolve the liquidity crisis so quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, institutional investors' growing shift to these broader concerns 
is a strong hint that the bear market has much further to go, even if Saddam is 
overthrown soon. Elements of doubt have been planted in investors' heads -- 
worries about the value of long-term investments in the current world economic 
climate -- and those doubts will take time to erase. 
</P>
<P>
What's also interesting, however, is how many big investors seem sure that the 
stock market low isn't far off -- while history and the investors' own negative 
feelings suggest otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing many of his peers, Charles Brandes of Brandes Investment Management in 
San Diego says he would become "an out-and-out bull" if the Dow industrial 
index falls to between 2,000 and 2,200, from 2,454.95 now. 
</P>
<P>
At 2,200 or below, he says, there would be enough value in stocks to guarantee 
excellent profits over the long term. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Sass believes, the market "is probably within 10% to 15%" of what 
will be at least its initial bottom. Having by now cut his aggressive accounts 
to just 60% stocks and 40% cash, he says, "I'm not selling anymore. Rather, I'm 
figuring when I'll be buying into the market again." 
</P>
<P>
That reluctance to sell -- or to buy -- at current levels explains why the 
market has been mostly churning in recent weeks. Many investors want the market 
to go lower so they can buy, but they want someone else to drive it there. They 
feel as if they've sold enough already. 
</P>
<P>
But if the economy is in fact just entering a recession, history suggests that 
the ultimate bottom for stocks is well in the distance. A study by Shearson 
Lehman Bros. of the eight postwar recessions shows that market bottoms 
typically aren't reached until just three to five months before the end of a 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
So if the current recession were to last until next June, the market probably 
wouldn't reach its low until sometime between January and March. 
</P>
<P>
Could that low be a mere 2,000 to 2,200 on the Dow, as many big investors 
believe? Perhaps. But some experts worry that the negative psychology is 
building to a point that could prove the 2,000-bottom group much too 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
If the market is carried to 2,000, some say, the momentum at that point is 
likely to be strong enough to guarantee a fall to much lower depths. 
</P>
<P>
Perrone, of the Texas Teachers fund, now has just 41% of the fund's assets in 
stocks. But if the fund's trustees became convinced that the economy was 
sinking far deeper than most experts expect, the fund could sell all the way 
down to 35% stocks, he says. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't anticipate liquidating stocks to that degree, but he admits "I think 
it could happen. There's no question they (fund trustees) are worried." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of private money managers, terrified clients may ultimately force 
liquidation, even if the managers believe that stocks are too cheap to sell. 
After all, no hired money manager can balk when a client simply says, "Enough." 
</P>
<P>
And if the bad news continues on the economy, the banking system, the dollar 
and other fronts, there is little question that the list of get-me-out clients 
will grow. 
</P>
<P>
One portfolio manager remembers how on Oct. 19, 1987 -- the day of the crash -- 
he and other managers were at the mercy of clients, who had set up meetings 
with the managers and simply demanded "let's sell everything." 
</P>
<P>
Now, he says, "I think it's going to happen again, because they're starting to 
ask for those meetings again." 
</P>
<P>
WHEN WILL IT BE TIME TO BUY? 
</P>
<P>
Assuming the economy is in a recession, many investors are wondering when the 
stock market will begin looking ahead to a recovery. In the eight recessions 
since World War II, the market typically bottomed three to five months before 
the recovery began.

SMALL BUSINESS: FAMILY VALUES MEAN GOOD BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many manufacturers hide behind fancy advertising and glitzy packages, but two 
small companies with a combined history of 169 years face their customers every 
day by putting a family member's portrait on the label. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 100 years, the bespectacled face of Mrs. Stewart -- the company 
founder's mother-in-law -- has graced the label of Mrs. Stewart's Liquid 
Bluing, a laundry brightener now made by the Ken Norman family. 
</P>
<P>
And a portrait of a young Agnes Balian decorates the label of the ice cream and 
other frozen desserts produced by 62 year-old Balian Ice Cream Co. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Normans and the Balians make totally different things, both adhere 
to a formula for success. 
</P>
<P>
* They produce a limited number of products. 
</P>
<P>
* They put a family member in charge of the manufacturing process. 
</P>
<P>
* They apportion tasks to exploit each family member's experience and 
individual strengths. 
</P>
<P>
* They work long hours and support one another's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"At the core of successful family businesses are shared values about people, 
work and money," said David Bork, founder of the Bork Institute for Family 
Business in Aspen, Colo. "You've got to be a healthy family before you can 
become a healthy family business." 
</P>
<P>
Bork, who has counseled hundreds of family business owners over the last 20 
years, said: "If you don't respect your relatives, you shouldn't be in business 
with them." 
</P>
<P>
John Balian, son of Balian Ice Cream founder Jack Balian, believes the 
company's longevity is due to intense family involvement and focus on making 
the best ice cream possible. 
</P>
<P>
Balian Ice Cream has found a niche for its products, selling them mostly to 
school districts and grocery stores in Southern and Central California. During 
the summer, they ship truckloads of giant frozen pops to New York, but the rest 
of the year, they concentrate on serving hungry schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is better control over things when a family member oversees 
production," said John Balian, the production supervisor and "flavor man." 
</P>
<P>
Balian said his job is to see that the ice cream gets made right with a minimum 
of waste. 
</P>
<P>
"Every gallon we throw down the drain is money out of our pockets," said 
Balian, who recently won first place for his ice cream at the Los Angeles 
County Fair. 
</P>
<P>
Most days, he arrives at the plant around 4 a.m. A few hours later, the rest of 
the clan arrives. Uncles Alexander and George are responsible for selling the 
ice cream. Uncle Fred makes sure the equipment is running smoothly. Aunt Agnes 
supervises the office. Six cousins also work for the company. 
</P>
<P>
When Jack Balian died eight years ago, three of John's brothers left the 
business to work elsewhere. John stayed on to work with his aunt and uncles 
because making ice cream is something he loves and has been doing since he was 
14. 
</P>
<P>
"Following in my father's footsteps was really important to me," said Balian. 
"I feel making ice cream is a good, wholesome thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Halfway across the country, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, you can find Ken, Betty 
and Brad Norman mixing up a fresh batch of Mrs. Stewart's Liquid Bluing, which 
has been around since 1883. The nontoxic blue concoction was created by a 
peddler named Al Stewart who originally mixed it up in the basement of a store 
on Washington Avenue in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of grandmothers and great-grandmothers swear that bluing beats any 
other kind of laundry brightener. Unlike bleach or other chemicals, bluing 
makes laundry appear whiter and brighter by putting tiny, light-reflecting blue 
particles between fabric fibers. Loyal customers also swear a few drops is the 
best way to brighten swimming pools and whiten bunnies and poodles. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody else wants the bluing business because it's not that big," said Ken 
Norman, who sells about 750,000 bottles of Mrs. Stewart's a year. It retails 
for about $1.60 a bottle. "Bluing is used by the drop and one bottle will last 
for years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Norman began working for the Ford family in 1955, after the Fords bought the 
business from the Stewarts. Through the years, Norman acquired a bigger 
interest, until he bought it all in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Balians, the Normans divide up the work to suit their skills and 
interests. Ken Norman oversees production of the bluing. His wife Betty, a 
former teacher, runs the office. Son Bradley set up the computer system, which 
handles billing and accounting. 
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to do the work ourselves," said Ken Norman, who on production 
days, dons old pants and shoes dyed blue from many hours in the factory. 
Through the years, the Normans have introduced other products, including a cold 
water wash, but "we were bashing heads with Palmolive and just couldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
They do make one other product: a five-color dye kit for use by dermatologists, 
pathologists and researchers who work with human tissue. Together, the products 
bring in about $800,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mrs. Stewart died years ago, customers still send her about 1,000 
letters a month seeking advice on laundry and other domestic matters. Part of 
Betty Norman's job is answering those letters and sending back a 16-page "Home 
Washing Guide." 
</P>

ALL IN THE FAMILY Dennis Jaffe, author of "Working With the Ones You Love," 
(Conari Press, $19.95), has five tips for successfully bringing new family 
members into your business. Jaffe, co-founder of the HeartWork Group in San 
Francisco, counsels business owners around the country. 
</P>
<P>
* Set clear expectations about what the person will do. Don't assume anything. 
</P>
<P>
* Base salary on service to the business and make it comparable to other 
employees doing the same work. 
</P>
<P>
* If possible, heirs should be supervised by a non-family member who can become 
a mentor. 
</P>
<P>
* The new person should be responsible for certain area of the business and 
performance should be regularly reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
* Give siblings different areas of focus and rotate them into different areas 
so they can learn all aspects of the business.

LOTUS TO BUY ATLANTA TECH COMPANY FOR $65 MILLION

<P>
Lotus Development Corp., trying to fill a gap in its product line, announced 
Thursday that it would buy an Atlanta software firm for $65 million. 
</P>
<P>
Lotus said it signed a merger agreement with Samna Corp., which makes word 
processing products. Samna's software operates with the increasingly popular 
Windows graphical system made by Microsoft Corp., Lotus' main competitor. 
</P>
<P>
Windows makes it easier for computer users to operate personal computers made 
by International Business Machines Corp. and compatible models. 
</P>
<P>
If completed, the deal would mark the first acquisition by Lotus since a 
proposed $1.5-billion merger with Novell Inc., another software maker, fell 
apart at the last minute in May. 
</P>
<P>
Lotus officials said the $18.84-per-share buyout of Samna would represent an 
important step for the company, which saw earnings plunge by 63% in its most 
recent quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Lotus has been known more for its 1-2-3 business spreadsheet program. But 
Richard Eckel, a company spokesman, said word processing is the leading segment 
of the software industry, and Lotus has been largely absent from that area. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, customers have been shifting to software that operate with 
graphics, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Buying Samna will allow Lotus to take advantage of both those trends, Eckel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Samna will become the word processing division of Lotus, operating from 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Samna had sales of $10.3 million in the first nine months of 1990, compared to 
$11 million for all of 1989. But the company posted a $1.2-million loss over 
the first three quarters, largely due to its transition to the graphics-based 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Lotus had sales of $556 million in 1989. The Cambridge company said it would 
take a one-time charge of $40 million to $50 million against quarterly earnings 
when the transaction is completed. It hopes to complete the transaction by the 
end of the year.

As a 7-year-old trick-or-treater struck by a car clung to life Thursday, 
several Asian-American community leaders said more needs to be done to reach 
new immigrant parents who may be unfamiliar with the hazards of Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
Hoang Minh Le, 5, was killed Halloween night and his brother, Thanh Ming Le, 7, 
a first-grade pupil at the Hanson Elementary School in Anaheim, remained in 
critical condition Thursday on life support systems at UCI Medical Center in 
Orange, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The two were among a group of six children apparently trick-or-treating without 
adult supervision. Each brother was struck by a different car as they tried to 
cross busy Cerritos Avenue in the dark. Police believe the oldest child in the 
group was 9. 
</P>
<P>
Neither of the drivers was charged, and Orange County Sheriff's Department Lt. 
Richard J. Olson said the investigation had initially been hampered because the 
children and parents spoke little English. Olson said other police departments 
had dispatched Vietnamese-speaking officers to help. 
</P>
<P>
Several Vietnamese and Korean-American community leaders said that no concerted 
effort has been made to educate parents about the American holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Halloween is not celebrated in Asia, and though children instantly thrill to 
the occasion, their parents may not be aware of the traffic danger, food 
tampering and violence that have changed the way the holiday is observed in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Though nearly every school in Orange County discussed Halloween safety in 
English, and many did so in Spanish or had instructional aides helping out in 
other languages, school officials contacted Thursday in Santa Ana, Garden Grove 
and Stanton said no special efforts were made to reach Asian-language-speaking 
pupils. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not send bulletins home in Vietnamese," said Victoria 
Muhonen-Hernandez, principal of the Hansen Elementary School in Anaheim, where 
Thanh Ming Le attends first grade. 
</P>
<P>
"Honestly, we don't focus on the dangers," said Marianne Blank, executive 
director of St. Anselm's Immigrant and Refugee Community Center in Garden 
Grove. The center runs orientation programs and English classes for new 
arrivals, serving about 400 people a month. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel terrible when I think about it," Blank said. "It wouldn't take long at 
all to go over all these things. It wouldn't be hard at all to cover what you 
do and don't do on Halloween." 
</P>
<P>
Blank said she would immediately add a safety segment to her orientation 
program, specifically discussing Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
The Korea Central Daily newspaper, which sells about 15,000 copies in Orange 
County, did run an article a week ago warning parents to accompany their 
children trick-or-treating and scrutinize all goodies, said staff writer 
Jonathan Heo, who said he had heard of no Halloween-related problems in the 
Korean community. 
</P>
<P>
However, the major Vietnamese-language newspapers did not carry such warnings, 
said Yen Do, editor of the Nguoi Viet Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very negative thing to say, 'Don't trust your American neighbors,' " 
said Do, who said the paper has in past years carried only general explanations 
of the holiday. "That's a very good thing for Vietnamese families, to see their 
children receive cookies from their American neighbors. So we don't want to 
say, 'Stop!' 
</P>
<P>
"I think if the Vietnamese parents say something to their children on Halloween 
night, they just say watch the traffic or watch the dogs, but they don't warn 
their children about poisoned cookies and crazy people," Do added. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be a very productive suggestion that the ethnic newspapers 
give some articles . . . about safety for the children," said Eiwon Chough, a 
member of the Korean-American Assn. of Orange County Inc. "Some of the 
newcomers, they would not know what Halloween means. So they would not be aware 
of what's going on. . . . Also, fireworks on the 4th of July." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have Halloween in Vietnam -- that's why the kids here, they like it 
so much," said Mai Cong, chairman of the Vietnamese Community of Orange County 
Inc., another refugee service agency. "They really enjoy it, and they pressure 
their parents to take them out. They want to be like all the others, they want 
to have a good time." 
</P>
<P>
Families who have been in this country longer, however, have become cautious, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Several of my friends brought their children to the mall because it's safer," 
Cong said. 
</P>
<P>
Cong said her agency used to run an orientation program for new arrivals, but 
the program was discontinued because of budget cutbacks and a shift in 
priorities toward job training programs. Cong and Blank said immigrants of all 
nationalities continue to need far more help and information than they usually 
receive on matters ranging from housing to child supervision to crime 
prevention. 
</P>
<P>
"They think it's going to be safer here," Blank said. "But everything is bigger 
and more complicated and completely different and not safer here. . . . Life is 
complicated and it's hard to learn all the things you have to learn."

PLAYS FOR KIDS: Robert Redford has selected longtime South Coast Repertory 
staffer Jerry Patch to take charge of a new national children's theater program 
based at the Sundance Institute in Utah. . . . Patch will remain at SCR as a 
literary adviser but will help the institute recruit major writers for 
children's projects. "The tradition in Europe is that the best writers also 
write for children," Patch says. "The level of that literature is very high."

This year on Nov. 30, the park hosts the third private party thrown by AIDS

"About 90% are going to be gay, but that's not the point," says an AIDS Project

WILSON: HE PLAYS IT SAFE, AVOIDING NEW ISSUES OR POLITICAL RISKS THAT FEINSTEIN 
COULD USE TO HER ADVANTAGE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republican Sen. Pete Wilson plodded methodically Thursday toward the 
governorship he expects to win Tuesday, playing a safe end game devoid of new 
issues or political risks. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, except for his Oct. 7 endorsement of legislative term limits, Wilson's 
campaign is ending with the very same policy positions with which it began five 
months ago: Tough on crime, for choice on abortion, cautious on taxes and 
fiscal management, pro-environment and for better education. Most of that 
platform was outlined well before the general election campaign began. Wilson's 
course has been consistent ever since. 
</P>
<P>
In these waning days of the campaign, former San Francisco Mayor Dianne 
Feinstein is struggling to find some weakness in the Wilson defense, any issue 
to exploit. The Wilson campaign is determined not to give her the slightest 
opening. 
</P>
<P>
In an address Thursday to the Commonwealth Club on Feinstein's home ground, 
Wilson delivered a speech that was a virtual duplicate of all those he has 
given since June. Even the jokes were the same. 
</P>
<P>
In Anaheim later in the day, Wilson maintained his cautious style but continued 
his tough-on-crime stance, when he attended a reception sponsored by 150 crime 
victims who worked to pass Proposition 115, also known as Crime Victims Justice 
Reform Act, which was approved by voters in June. Wilson had served as honorary 
chairman of the committee that advocated the measure. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 people lined up inside the Stadium Club at the Anaheim Stadium and 
each presented the Republican gubernatorial candidate with a red rose to show 
appreciation for his contribution to the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, Orange County Dist. Atty. Mike Capizzi and other speakers said the new 
law speeds up the court process, protects crime victims from "unnecessary 
trauma" and saves taxpayers millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just the savings," Wilson told the gathering, "but what it is going 
to mean will be lives saved. We're going to finish the job. . . . We have to 
lengthen the sentences to keep dangerous people from decent people." 
</P>
<P>
The only significant change in the gubernatorial campaign has been Wilson's 
endorsement during the one and only debate Oct. 7 of Proposition 140, the 
initiative to limit officeholder terms, sponsored by Republican Los Angeles 
County Supervisor Pete Schabarum. 
</P>
<P>
Even then, Wilson's decision was not a big surprise. He had been hinting at it 
for days. Two things changed his mind, he said: The failure of a ballot measure 
in the June primary to take reapportionment of legislative districts out of the 
Legislature's hands, and a federal judge's decision to remove campaign spending 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
With those two actions, Wilson said, the only way to achieve change in the 
Legislature's entrenched membership was through term limits. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, meanwhile, adopted a number of policy positions that were designed 
to demonstrate to voters that she is the candidate who will get California 
"moving again" after more than 20 years of governors who were stingy with 
budgets and reluctant to experiment with new programs. Some of Feinstein's 
policy decisions brought her the support of interest groups that now endorse 
her candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
She got the backing of the California Teachers' Assn., and declared that she 
would not tamper with the education spending mandates of Proposition 98 of 
1988, which is part of the CTA gospel. 
</P>
<P>
She endorsed Proposition 128, the "Big Green" environmental initiative 
sponsored by a coalition of conservation groups and won the support of the 
Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and Feinstein have battled neck and neck in the public opinion polls all 
summer long and into the fall. It seemed that nothing Feinstein could do would 
put her out front, despite the high hopes of supporters after her dramatic 
primary victory over Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp won her national attention. 
</P>
<P>
Now, late in the campaign, the issues seem to have swung in Wilson's direction. 
While Democrats may be reaping political capital by accusing President Bush of 
saving the wealthy from an income tax surcharge to help cut the federal 
deficit, Wilson boasts of voting against the budget package because of the 
gasoline and excise taxes that he claims would most hurt the average working 
man and woman. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Wilson also defended his vote against the proposed Civil Rights 
Act of 1990 as a matter of political integrity. In response to a question from 
a Commonwealth Club member, Wilson said, "I despise discrimination" of any 
sort. He added that "it would have been easy and expedient" to vote for the 
bill and not risk upsetting minority groups. "But I voted against this one, 
whatever it is called, because it was a quota bill." 
</P>
<P>
While Feinstein has tried to exploit his vote as anti-civil rights, Wilson is 
confident the issue works in his favor because opinion polls indicate a 
majority of Americans oppose quotas. 
</P>
<P>
While he is enthusiastically endorsing term limits to rid state government of 
entrenched interests, Wilson nevertheless makes constant use of his unbroken 
record of 24 years in office -- in the state Assembly, as mayor of San Diego 
and the last eight years as the junior U.S. senator from California. The 
apparent inconsistency does not seem to have shown up in the polls as a 
liability for Wilson.

DEVELOPER GOES BACK TO FIRST PLAN

<P>
Faced with stiff opposition from residents and environmentalists, county 
supervisors voted last week to overrule the Planning Commission and send a 
revised South County development plan back for further review. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of 20 homes in the area near Modjeska Canyon will be allowed to 
proceed, but an amended plan submitted by the applicant, Khalil Zadeh, cannot 
be undertaken without a new environmental impact report, the board concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Zadeh said he cannot afford the time to complete such a report and therefore 
plans to begin work on his approved project. 
</P>
<P>
Under Zadeh's proposed amendment, the new project would have put 22 homes on 
about 46 acres. Unless he waits for the revised environmental review, however, 
Zadeh will be limited to building 20 homes on 42.5 acres. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot imagine what these people have put me through," Zadeh said, 
pointing to the residents and environmentalists opposed to the amended project. 
"I have a right to develop this property." 
</P>
<P>
The project drew stiff opposition from environmentalists, including the Rural 
Canyons Conservation Fund, which appealed the Planning Commission's approval of 
the 22-home proposal. The commission had voted to let the project proceed 
without a new environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
One resident, Dianne Carter, said she feared development of the project would 
cut off an important wildlife corridor would hurt the area's deer population. 
Other residents raised concerns about traffic, and Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez 
agreed that the project deserved an environmental review before proceeding. JIM

Both City Council incumbents have raised more than $20,000 in efforts to fight 
off challengers in Tuesday's election for council seats. 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn R. Hart, running against Jan Vandersloot for the District 3 seat on the 
council, recorded $21,878 in total contributions to her campaign since she 
announced she would run for office, according to her latest campaign financial 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Vandersloot has raised about $8,000, including a $2,000 loan. 
</P>
<P>
In the race for the District 1 seat, three-term incumbent Donald A. Strauss has 
collected just over $20,000, including a $5,000 loan. Strauss is being 
challenged by political newcomer John Hedges. 
</P>
<P>
The committee to elect John Hedges has recorded $4,800 in contributions, 
including a $1,200 loan. 
</P>
<P>
Notable for Hedges is the number of Newport Beach police officers who have 
donated to his campaign. During the October reporting period, 29 members of the 
Newport Beach Police Department gave money to the Hedges campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his campaign, and during public forums, Hedges, a former reserve 
police officer, has urged additional support to the police force, including 
using additional reserve officers to help bolster the department during the 
busy summer season. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Councilmen Phil Sansone nor Clarence J. Turner have filed campaign 
statements during the election. Both are unopposed and are not collecting 
contributions for the race. 
</P>
<P>
The city limits donations from individuals to $200, according to the city 
clerk's office. LAURA MICHAELIS

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: AMBURGEY LEADS IN FUND RAISING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orville Amburgey, who is seeking reelection to the City Council, leads fund 
raising among five candidates seeking two seats in Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
According to records filed with the city clerk's office, Amburgey has raised 
$46,527 so far, about $10,000 more than incumbent Mayor Peter F. Buffa. 
</P>
<P>
Buffa, who got a late start in campaigning this year, has raised $35,659. About 
half of that has been raised since Oct. 1. Buffa has also raised the most money 
-- more than $3,000 -- from political action committees. 
</P>
<P>
Challenger Arlene Schafer raised only $3,895 in the October reporting period, 
but has accumulated a total of $21,355 this year. Schafer, who is a former 
mayor, is seeking a third non-consecutive term on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Although Amburgey has raised the most money, he has spent only $8,290 in the 
same period on advertising, signs and fund-raisers. Both he and Buffa have 
hired professional consultants to help run their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"I will assure you that it all has a place to go," Amburgey said. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing in fund raising are challengers Jay Humphrey and Karen McGlinn. 
Humphrey has raised $5,707, while McGlinn has raised $2,908. MARY ANNE PEREZ

LUCKY NUMBERS FOR SCHOOL COMPUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Two days before the school year began, $80,000 worth of computer equipment sat 
in boxes at Canyon High School, ready to be installed. But the school district 
was hit by budget cuts, and officials feared that the equipment would have to 
be returned. 
</P>
<P>
Then the school won big at bingo. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to $64,000 in bingo game proceeds, within two weeks Canyon High will 
have its first video laser disc technology, and each ninth-grade English class 
will have computers. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are opposed to bingo in the schools but they don't understand 
the potential" of the game as a fund-raiser, game manager Sandy Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon High bingo began in 1988 and generated about $100,000 in its first year, 
Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of that money had been earmarked for a new weight room, but when Ryan 
heard that the technology program was in jeopardy, the funds were redirected. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon High began planning a technology development program in June to expand 
beyond the the word-processing functions available to students in the library. 
With the new equipment, said Principal Jack Fox, the class of 1994 "will be 
totally proficient in computers. They will look at a computer, and they will 
know what to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
The bingo earnings plus $15,000 in state lottery money will provide IBM Model 
30 computers for the advanced computer science and business classes, Apple IIe 
computers for freshman English, desktop publishing programs for the journalism 
and yearbook courses, reference and research programs for the library, and 
video laser disc technology for the science and math departments. MARY HELEN

<P>
A tour bus will leave City Hall at 8:30 a.m. Saturday for a free public tour of 
open spaces that have been targeted for purchase by the city. 
</P>
<P>
City officials will accompany the riders on the 46-passenger bus to view the 
properties, including orange groves in the northwest areas of town and the 
Kinoshita farm just off Del Obispo Street. 
</P>
<P>
The tour will also include a hilltop view of the city from the ridgelines near 
Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
City voters approved the purchase of these properties with the passage of a 
$21-million general obligation bond in April. This week, the council voted to 
buy the 56-acre Kinoshita farm for $9.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Tour participants will be doing some short hiking and should wear comfortable 
clothes. For more information, call (714) 493-5911. LEN HALL

FOOT PATROL OFFERS NEW PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA MASCARO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police Officer Harald Martin says a cop needs more than a sharp eye to function 
in the city's crime- and poverty-plagued Jeffrey-Lynne neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
A cop also needs empathy and patience, Martin says, to work in this urban 
ghetto nestled behind Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
"The Police Department can band-aid any problem," Martin said on a recent 
afternoon walk through the neighborhood. "Whereas if you change the 
neighborhood from the inside, you can correct it." 
</P>
<P>
Martin is something of a one-man show, patrolling on foot through the tiny, 
overcrowded neighborhood where just over 100 large apartment buildings are 
crammed onto four small streets and up to a dozen people can be found living in 
nearly any one-room apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Under a two-year state grant totaling $225,000, plus $32,500 from the city, 
Martin and code enforcement officer Roger Bennion have been hired to patrol the 
neighborhood full time. 
</P>
<P>
It is a neighborhood in which the aroma of home-style Latin cooking fills the 
air, bringing a cozy calm to the poor, dirty streets. 
</P>
<P>
Martin is a little bit of everything that it takes to work in this 
neighborhood: He's part social worker, part counselor, part code enforcer, part 
officer. In his book, a good cop isn't one who arrests every lawbreaker he 
sees, but one who can teach the minor offenders how to act lawfully. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a different approach," he said. "It isn't police work, because police 
work, in the long run, doesn't cut the mustard." 
</P>
<P>
Last October, a pilot six-month program combined the efforts of daily police 
foot patrols, code enforcement officers and community services personnel and 
succeeded in greatly reducing crime and improving the area. 
</P>
<P>
A community center was established in one of the apartment buildings, offering 
social services ranging from low-income cooking classes to recreation for the 
hundreds of children who have no yard to play in after school. 
</P>
<P>
But when the funding was gone and police patrols ended last April, many of the 
problems they had chased away returned. Gang graffiti again covered walls, 
bottle shards littered streets, and drug dealing resumed, as did fights and 
gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
But the six-month experiment had been so successful, while it lasted, that it 
became the model for the Community Action Policing Team, a similar citywide 
task force now in operation. It also won new funding to continue the officers' 
work in Jeffrey-Lynne. 
</P>
<P>
When Martin took a recent tour of about 20 of the apartment buildings, he found 
that just a few of the landlords had finished correcting such problems as 
corroded bathrooms, faulty plumbing and cockroach infestation. 
</P>
<P>
Residents like Angie Raudales, 17, a mother of two who has seen the 
neighborhood's transitions, are doubtful that Martin and Bennion can overcome 
the problems. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the idea of an officer on full-time patrol is reassuring, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll know the faces. He'll know what's going on. It worked in the beginning; 
maybe it will work again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
One recent afternoon, Martin came across a typical sight on the neighborhood 
streets: a group of men sitting outside in the shade enjoying a beer after 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"No cerveza aqui," Martin told them. They didn't budge much, but when he said 
that there would be about a $100 fine if they were cited, they scooped up their 
drinks and headed into an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said he realizes that men like these are hot and tired after a day's 
work and that they would rather drink beer outside than in a dingy, stuffy 
apartment cramped with other people who live there. So he doesn't cite them but 
warns them, remembering their faces in case there is a next time. 
</P>
<P>
That same afternoon, he found two young men drinking beer in an alley behind a 
shed known as a former drug hangout. Tiny papers that once held heroin and 
cut-off soda cans used for heating the drug still littered the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Martin asked the men if they were residents of the nearby apartment complex, 
and both said they were, even though their driver's licenses said otherwise. 
Although he didn't cite them for drinking beer in the alley, Martin took their 
names for his own record. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be the people who are going to have to do all the work," he 
said. "Once they see there are changes being made, I think I can get them to 
buy into the idea that they can make a difference too."LISA MASCARO

PETITIONERS WANT HELIPAD REMOVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tired of helicopter noise, Leisure World residents this week presented 
petitions to local, state and federal officials calling for Rockwell 
International to move its helicopter landing pad. 
</P>
<P>
More than 600 people signed the petition that asks Rockwell to relocate the 
helipad so it will not face apartments for seniors along Westminster Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The apartments were built in 1963 and a permit was issued for the helipad in 
1967, when officials estimated there would be about four flights daily. But as 
the Rockwell facility has grown over the years, the flight level has increased 
to about 10 daily, company officials estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Leisure World residents say helicopter noise levels exceed city standards. Tom 
Lyon, a Leisure World leader, said the helicopter noise level has reached 
almost 80 decibels. City noise standards call for 55 decibels, with higher 
levels acceptable depending on their duration, said city Planning Director Lee 
Whittenberg. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell has also surveyed helicopter noise, and preliminary findings show that 
the helipad does not exceed the city's noise limits, Rockwell spokeswoman B.J. 
Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
The company has considered moving the helipad to the other side of the 
facility, but noise there would affect existing homes and a proposed housing 
development, Snyder said. The Mola Development Corp. has been seeking approval 
to build 335 houses on the Hellman Ranch property that would border the 
Rockwell property. 
</P>
<P>
The city will not take action on the petitions until Rockwell's helicopter 
noise reports are received and studied, Whittenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
The Leisure World residents also petitioned the state Coastal Commission and 
the Federal Aviation Administration, saying the agencies circumvented state 
environmental regulations by not requiring an environmental study or holding a 
public hearing before approving the helipad. SHANNON SANDS

BREAK-IN GETS MORE OLICE ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Orange County gay rights activist whose home was ransacked and left 
spray-painted with anti-homosexual slogans said he believes the incident is now 
being investigated as a hate crime by Anaheim police. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff LeTourneau said he is convinced that police, rather than treating the 
incident as a "common break-in," have given the ransacking and vandalism added 
interest because two more detectives, who were accompanied by a police 
photographer, visited his home on Wednesday, one day after it was spray-painted 
and $10,000 worth of electronic equipment and jewelry were taken. 
</P>
<P>
Police Lt. Ray Welch could not confirm whether the department had changed its 
investigation from a "routine burglary." 
</P>
<P>
Welch, however, said that the investigation has been stepped up, and that 
police will begin canvassing LeTourneau's West Forest Lane neighborhood for 
further information. 
</P>
<P>
LeTourneau, founder and chairman of the Orange County Visibility League, one of 
the county's most vocal gay and lesbian rights groups, said he was overwhelmed 
by the amount of support he and his roommates have received from Anaheim 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the process of rebuilding what we have lost, but the good thing is 
that there has been an outpouring of support from people that we don't even 
know." 
</P>
<P>
LeTourneau said one person delivered a portable television to his house. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has received death threats in the past and threats that his house 
would be burned to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that whether the ransacking is part of a bigger picture or an 
isolated part, people are acting violently against gays and lesbians," he said.

DISPUTE PUTS A STOP TO ADDITIONAL MORNING TRAIN FOR IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Less than a week after Irvine got a third morning train to Los Angeles, Amtrak 
officials announced Thursday that the additional stop would be discontinued 
after Sunday because of a dispute with the freight firm that owns the rail 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. said the extra 
train stop in Irvine at 6:50 a.m. threatened to kick off "a domino effect" of 
scheduling problems for freight and passenger trains all along the rail 
corridor. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak officials said they were upset by Santa Fe's decision, but hoped the 
freight train firm would reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't think this new train was going to cause this sort of deal," said 
Arthur Lloyd, an Amtrak spokesman. "We're just sorry that the general public 
has been caught in the middle." 
</P>
<P>
Transportation officials in Orange County, meanwhile, suggested the move by 
Santa Fe had little to do with scheduling concerns. Instead, they argued, the 
firm is trying to gain leverage in negotiations with government officials in 
Orange, Los Angeles and San Diego counties trying to purchase the rail right of 
way and open it up to more commuter trains. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Transportation Commission officials noted that the extra train 
stop in Irvine hardly ruffled the delicate schedule of trains running along the 
line between San Diego and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A northbound Amtrak train from San Diego passes through the Irvine Station 
anyway and a stop there adds at most three minutes to the schedule, they said. 
Moreover, that delay can be absorbed because padding on the train's running 
time is already built into the schedule, OCTC officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The 6:50 a.m. train stop in Irvine was added Monday to two other existing 
morning stops. The other stops in Irvine Station at 6:15 a.m. and 7:58 a.m. 
will remain unchanged, Amtrak officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe officials argued in a letter distributed Friday to Amtrak passengers 
that the extra train stop in Irvine "jeopardizes our ability to provide on-time 
performance for not just that additional train, but all other trains in the 
corridor." 
</P>
<P>
They noted that agreements with Amtrak called for no new train stops at Irvine 
until work to lay down new tracks along the rail corridor is completed in 1991. 
Moreover, they said that Amtrak had failed to consult with Santa Fe about the 
change, which they said had been standard procedure in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"If Amtrak had come up to us and hammered out an agreement, it wouldn't have 
been any problem," Michael Martin, a Santa Fe spokesman, said in an interview 
Thursday. "But trying to get a fastball or slider by us while we're not looking 
is not in our opinion accepted business practice."

MEASURE M; 
</P>
<P>
TAX OPPONENT ACCUSES REED OF REAPING PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Launching a last volley before the Tuesday election, a leading opponent of the 
Measure M sales tax proposal made a personal attack Thursday on Dana Reed, 
chairman of the Orange County Transportation Commission and a leader of the 
Measure M campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Slow-growth activist Tom Rogers, chairman of Citizens Against Unfair Taxation, 
charged at a news conference that Reed's Costa Mesa law firm is improperly 
profiting from the Measure M campaign. He cited campaign finance disclosure 
forms that show Reed's law partner, Cary Davidson, has received $7,590 in fees 
from Citizens for Yes on Revised Measure M for serving as the campaign 
treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Rogers accused Reed of buying support for Measure M by doling out money 
from his abandoned supervisorial campaign to other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
But Reed said his law partner is acting as an individual and no money is coming 
through the firm. Also, Reed said the money given to candidates, including 
$1,000 donated to Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates, was his own and not leftover 
campaign funds. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's news conference was the most visible activity to date from opponents 
of Measure M. Except for a televised debate on KOCE-TV Channel 50, opponents 
have maintained a very low profile. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Measure M also maintained a very low profile until this week when 
mail began arriving at homes throughout the county, including some pieces from 
the Automobile Club of Southern California and some from local officials 
exhorting residents to vote for the ballot measure as an act of good 
citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by a majority of voters countywide, Measure M would increase the 
tax on retail sales from 6% to 6 1/2%. It would raise about $3.1 billion for 
transportation projects over a fixed, 20-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Rogers at the news conference were representatives of groups that 
oppose Measure M for a variety of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Placentia Mayor Norman Z. Eckenrode said his city and other towns in North 
Orange County would not reap benefits equal to the sales tax revenue that those 
cities would generate. 
</P>
<P>
Others who showed up included Westminster Councilwoman Joy L. Neugebauer, who 
is challenging incumbent supervisor Harriett M. Wieder; Norm Grossman, an 
environmentalist and candidate for Laguna Beach City Council, and Libertarian 
Party Chairman Jack Dean. 
</P>
<P>
Neugebauer contended that the growth controls in Measure M transfer decision 
making from local, elected officials to a panel of appointees, while Grossman 
argued that Measure M isn't strong enough on growth management. 
</P>
<P>
Dean argued simply that private enterprise should be allowed to solve the 
county's traffic mess without tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
All participants said OCTC should either be disbanded or its members subjected 
to a countywide election. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Reed and the issue of his law firm's role and Reed's campaign 
donations to candidates, Rogers said: "I think it's highly inappropriate. This 
is the height of arrogance." 
</P>
<P>
"I agree with Tom that this is improper," Reed responded, "and that's why I 
structured things this way -- precisely so it wouldn't be a problem. I derive 
no financial benefit whatsoever from the Measure M campaign. In fact, it's 
hurting the firm, because my partner could be spending his time on the firm's 
business and he's not." 
</P>
<P>
Reed provided The Times with copies of his campaign reports, which showed that 
he reported the donations to Gates and other candidates as personal 
contributions, and not those of his campaign committee. Reed said there was no 
mingling of his personal funds and campaign receipts. 
</P>
<P>
Reed said the disclosure format is easily misunderstood because it asks 
candidates to list their personal contributions in the same reporting package 
that requires disclosure of the campaign committee's receipts and expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
"No campaign money of mine went to any candidate," Reed said.

BOND MEASURE CALLED ESSENTIAL TO THE FUTURE OF HIGHER EDUCATION

The rock musicians and the guy in a gorilla suit had a higher purpose Thursday: 
to exhort the milling crowd of UC Irvine book-packers to safeguard the future 
of higher education with a vote for Proposition 143 next week. 
</P>
<P>
"What we need you to do is get out and vote, get your parents out to vote and 
get your friends out to vote for it," Student Vice President Gary Miles said of 
the $450-million bond measure for higher education on the Nov. 6 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"Your future and the future of California depends on it," added the 20-year-old 
political science major from Brooklyn, speaking to a crowd of more than 150 UCI 
students breezing through the student center on their lunch break. 
</P>
<P>
The student-sponsored rally, the flyers handed out by an anonymous man in a 
rented gorilla suit and the numerous mailers and articles appearing in student 
newspapers across Orange County serve to underscore growing fears on the 
state's public college and university campuses that Proposition 143 could fail. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the measure would provide nearly $87 million for construction and 
renovation projects at UCI, Cal State Fullerton and eight community colleges in 
Orange County. Cal State Long Beach, which is heavily attended by Orange County 
students, is slated for another $9.4 million in campus projects. 
</P>
<P>
The projects have been approved by the Legislature and the governor, but they 
will not be completed if voters fail to pass a bond measure to fund them. 
Proposition 143 is a companion to the $450-million ballot measure for higher 
education that voters approved in June. 
</P>
<P>
Educators across the state are increasingly worried that voters -- buffeted by 
higher taxes, higher gas prices and a declining economy -- will reject any 
money measure, even one that has no organized opposition. They also fear that 
in its trailing position on a lengthy ballot, Proposition 143 will get lost in 
the shuffle. 
</P>
<P>
"We're quite apprehensive," said UCI Chancellor Jack W. Peltason, who has sent 
informational letters about the measure to campus faculty and staff and UCI 
Medical Center employees. "There are so many measures on the ballot, and ours 
is way down there at the bottom. We're afraid . . . people might not focus on 
our needs." 
</P>
<P>
He is not alone in his efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton President Milton A. Gordon reminds virtually every group he 
speaks to these days that the very quality of education offered at his 
university hinges on passage of Proposition 143. "I am very concerned. . . . I 
have been speaking out in a variety of ways so that everybody understands what 
is at stake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
What the measure means for Cal State Fullerton is about $9.8 million, the bulk 
of it for renovation of its aging heating and cooling plant as well as 
equipment for a planned science laboratory annex. 
</P>
<P>
It would also provide $507,000 for architectural drawings and plans for a 
long-awaited expansion of the campus library. 
</P>
<P>
Without passage of the measure, Gordon said, the $22.4-million science 
laboratory annex, which is expected to break ground in December and open in the 
fall of 1993, could sit unfinished and empty. The measure would provide $3.1 
million to install laboratory equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"And we need the library expansion to make sure we keep the necessary supply of 
books and periodicals that our faculty and students need," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
UCI's stake in the ballot measure is far greater at $39.8 million. The single 
biggest item is $27 million for a new engineering facility, plus $3.8 million 
more to renovate and upgrade the existing overcrowded building. 
</P>
<P>
Much emphasis has been placed on soaring population growth in California, which 
is expected to send 57,000 more students to University of California campuses 
by the year 2005. But the need for the capital projects covered by Proposition 
143 is far more immediate than that, say academic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it will be important for the future," Fullerton's Gordon said of the 
ballot measure. "But the new science labs that will be under construction are 
needed now for the students we currently have. The library expansion is needed 
for the students we have now." 
</P>
<P>
UCI's chancellor concurred. 
</P>
<P>
"We have inadequate space to educate the students that are at our door now," 
Peltason said. "We can improvise classrooms, and we can improvise even with 
private funding (to support programs). But to do major next-century 
engineering, we need to do the kind of building that only the state can 
afford." 
</P>
<P>
Among community colleges, Orange Coast College has $31.5 million in capital 
projects hinging on the bond measure's passage. About $12 million would go for 
a new vocational technology center to help train the workers of the future. 
Another $17.7 million would be for land acquisition at the burgeoning campus, 
which claims to be the largest community college in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Voters regularly hear dueling commercials about several more controversial 
ballot measures. But so far, the only opposition to Proposition 143 comes in 
negative ballot arguments by three individuals who oppose all bond measures on 
principle. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no opposition to Proposition 143 that I'm aware of," Gordon said. 
"But we have to get the message out. We have to really emphasize that this is 
an educational bond and it is important to maintain the quality of education 
that California has always been known for."

CHALLENGER SAYS FRIZZELLE USING OFFICE FOR CAMPAIGN

<P>
Democratic Assembly candidate James Toledano charged Thursday that his 
opponent, incumbent Nolan Frizzelle (R-Fountain Valley), is violating state law 
by using his legislative office and staff members in his reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Frizzelle's staff aides, who are employees of the state Assembly, have 
represented the assemblyman at two recent candidates forums, and arrangements 
for Frizzelle's campaign appearances must be made through his district office 
in Fountain Valley, Toledano said. 
</P>
<P>
"My taxes and your taxes are paying for his campaign," said Toledano, standing 
outside Frizzelle's office on Newhope Street. "This is a case of an incumbent 
using his office as a personal perk." 
</P>
<P>
One of Frizzelle's staff members, Karen Walker, represented the assemblyman at 
an event sponsored by the California Nurses Assn. in Irvine earlier this month, 
but she said her appearance was not campaign-related. 
</P>
<P>
"As an elected official, you're asked to go to an event or send a 
representative," Walker said, mentioning ribbon-cuttings and dedications as 
examples of such events. "He was invited to meet with constituents as an 
elected official, not as a candidate." 
</P>
<P>
Toledano and other candidates, however, were invited to the same function. 
Frizzelle said Thursday that when the nurses group called his office and asked 
him to attend, they did not make it clear that other candidates would be there. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't billed as a campaign function, and we had no way of knowing who was 
going to attend," Frizzelle said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Frizzelle said, the event was held in the evening, so Walker was 
attending on her own time. 
</P>
<P>
Another Frizzelle aide, Jim Orr, represented Frizzelle at a candidates forum 
sponsored by Huntington Landmark, a gated seniors community in Huntington 
Beach. But Frizzelle said Orr took a vacation day and attended on his own time 
as a volunteer for Frizzelle. 
</P>
<P>
"That one was in the evening too, but Orr took the day off to make doubly 
sure," Frizzelle said. "We're very strict around here about the rules." 
</P>
<P>
A third staff member, Lyla Crawford, is working for Frizzelle's and other 
Republican campaigns at a local party office in Fountain Valley. She is a 
part-time Assembly employee, but Frizzelle said she has taken a month off from 
her job to work on the campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
State law forbids incumbents from using their government offices or employees 
-- while on state time -- to benefit their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Frizzelle said Toledano's charges were signs of a desperate candidate searching 
for an issue in the closing days of a lost race. "He hasn't mounted a campaign 
based on any issues," Frizzelle said.

El Modena High School rallied in the second half to defeat Foothill, 21-13, and 
clinch at least a tie for the Empire League football title Thursday night at El 
Modena High. 
</P>
<P>
The heavily favored Vanguards (6-3, 4-0 in league) trailed, 13-7, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
But El Modena's defense came on to shut down the Knights' offense, and running 
back Adam Garcia and quarterback Jose Prado keyed two third-quarter touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Reynolds, Pancho Oporeza, Andy Bourgelais and the rest of the Vanguards' 
defensive unit held Foothill to 13 yards total offense in the second half. 
Bourgelais led the way with three sacks. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia rushed for 173 yards and two touchdowns in 25 carries and accounted for 
nearly all of El Modena's offense in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
After stopping Foothill on the Knights' 15-yard line, El Modena took control 
following the punt on the Foothill 45. Four handoffs to Garcia later -- the 
last one for 29 yards and a touchdown -- the Vanguards tied the score at 13-13. 
An extra point put El Modena ahead, 14-13. 
</P>
<P>
The Vanguards later drove 55 yards for the final score. With Garcia starting to 
tire, Prado completed his first two passes of the game. The second one went 22 
yards to Jay Montano for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Saunders scored twice for Foothill (1-8, 0-4) on runs of two and one 
yards. TOM BIRSCHBACH

ACCOUNTING PARTNERS LIABLE IN LINCOLN CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge overseeing civil lawsuits relating to the failure of Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan ruled Thursday that the partners in three major accounting 
firms are individually responsible for any damage awards that investors may 
win. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Richard M. Bilby in Phoenix certified as class-action 
defendants the partners of Arthur Young &amp; Co., Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. 
and Touche, Ross &amp; Co. Only partners with the firms when they represented 
American Continental Corp. -- roughly from 1984 to April, 1989 -- are included. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Young and Touche Ross have since merged with separate firms and are now 
called Ernst &amp; Young and Deloitte &amp; Touche. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental, which owned Irvine-based Lincoln, went bankrupt in April, 
1989, and regulators seized the S&amp;L. Thousands of investors lost more than 
$250 million from American Continental's collapse, and the thrift's failure is 
expected to cost taxpayers more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Bilby's decision puts at risk the assets of nearly 4,000 individual partners at 
the three firms, giving plaintiffs -- many of whom lost their life savings in 
American Continental bonds -- another avenue to recoup their investments. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers contend that the ruling was unnecessary because partners always 
are liable for a partnership's debts, including any judgments. "I don't think 
it really changes a thing," said Stuart L. Kadison of Los Angeles, a lawyer for 
Arthur Andersen. "They still have to win a case against Arthur Andersen for 
liability." 
</P>
<P>
But the bondholders' attorney sought to make the partners defendants 
individually because the insurance coverage available to the three accounting 
firms would not cover all claims made in the cases. 
</P>
<P>
The accounting firms are among a host of defendants sued in 17 class actions 
consolidated in Bilby's court. The suits contend that American Continental's 
former chairman, Charles H. Keating Jr., with the help of other defendants and 
politicians, perpetrated a securities scheme that defrauded bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
Among that group are more than 17,000 small investors who bought nearly $200 
million in bonds through Lincoln's 29 Southern California branches.

BUILDERS EXPECT HOUSING SHORTAGE AFTER SLUMP ENDS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
They don't claim to know when the housing slump will end, but builders 
attending the biennial Barratt Business Round Table earlier this week in Irvine 
agree that when it does, it will go out with a bang. 
</P>
<P>
The end of the current economic slump and an increase in the demand for homes 
in Southern California's coastal counties will be accompanied by a tremendous 
housing shortage and yet another burst of price inflation, said Mark Frazier, 
president of Barratt America. 
</P>
<P>
Because homes already built aren't moving well in much of Orange and other 
coastal counties, builders have all but stopped putting up new homes, Frazier 
and other building industry insiders say. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, savings and loans no longer are able to make construction loans 
and most banks are no longer willing, so a principal source of financing has 
dried up. 
</P>
<P>
"So even if demand were back to normal, and we could get the (zoning) 
entitlements, we couldn't build enough" to restore a balance of supply and 
demand, Frazier said. Compiled by John O'Dell, Times staff writer

CELLULAR FIRM SET TO MARKET NEW PRODUCT

Universal Cellular Inc., a start-up cellular equipment manufacturer, plans to 
introduce a new product designed to compete with pocket-sized portable phone 
technology offered by several U.S. and Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
Universal Cellular said Thursday that it has awarded a $5-million advertising 
account to a Minneapolis ad agency, McElligott Wright Morrison White, which was 
founded recently by several former top executives at the Chiat/Day/Mojo agency 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Peter McCoy, vice president of marketing for Universal Cellular, said the 
company has also signed a joint-venture agreement with a "major" Japanese 
company to distribute the unidentified product outside North America. Motorola 
Inc., NEC Corp. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp. are the major manufacturers of 
pocket-size mobile phones. 
</P>
<P>
"We're ecstatic that MWMW has agreed to handle this account," McCoy said. "The 
amount shows that we're serious about the market." 
</P>
<P>
McCoy said the cellular product is a pocket-sized device "that is more than a 
phone." He said the company has been developing the proprietary cellular 
product for 18 months, but he declined to reveal more details about the 
product. 
</P>
<P>
Universal Cellular's chief executive is James Wohl, a cable television industry 
veteran and former president of West Hawaii Cable Vision Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tremendously exciting project for us," said Tony Wright, president 
of MWMW and an ad veteran who worked on the Energizer's popular Bunny 
advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Wright said the Universal portable phones would compete with products in the 
emerging personal communications network market, a cellular technology that 
would enable cordless office phones to be taken outside the office. 
</P>
<P>
Such pocket phones could allow workers to travel large distances, such as to 
and from home, and be in constant contact with a telephone. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim firm said the product will be sold internationally and displayed at 
an industry trade show in January in Las Vegas. The product's introduction date 
has not been set.

DOWNEY S&amp;L EXECUTIVE VP BOYLES RESIGNS

David L. Boyles, a banker hired by Downey Savings &amp; Loan to revamp its 
operations, unexpectedly quit as executive vice president and chief operating 
officer, officials of the thrift said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Boyles, who joined the institution only last February, told Downey officials 
that he would return to Seattle to manage a high-technology firm in which he 
has had a "substantial" ownership interest. 
</P>
<P>
He said in a letter Tuesday to Downey executives that his company was in "a 
critical growth phase" and that "now seems to be the right time to return to 
Seattle and help build the company." 
</P>
<P>
Jane Wolfe, a 15-year veteran at Downey, will take over as acting chief 
operating officer of the thrift, said Downey spokesman John Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
Boyles, a banker in Seattle before joining Bank of America in San Francisco, 
had been developing consumer lending programs and working on new marketing 
techniques, and much of that work will be continued, Dennis said. 
</P>
<P>
Boyles was the heir apparent to Downey's aging leadership and was expected to 
turn Downey into a bank-like operation. Maurice A. McAlister, Downey's 
president, had even said the thrift would likely be converted into a bank at 
some point. 
</P>
<P>
But Downey's healthy balance sheet and earnings, coupled with growing troubles 
in the banking industry, are causing directors to rethink their plans for 
wholesale changes at the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Downey, which has $4 billion in assets and 49 branches, earned $28.7 million in 
the first nine months of this year.

JOSEPH N. BELL: SON'S DEDICATION TO LIFE SURVIVES HIS IRREPARABLE LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two very dear Corona del Mar friends lost a 24-year-old son in a tragic 
accident last weekend. He was riding his bicycle near the UCLA campus, when he 
was struck from behind and hurtled into an oncoming car. 
</P>
<P>
His parents, our friends, were in Chicago on the second leg of a much-needed 
vacation that had taken them first to see the fall colors of New England. They 
received word of the accident in their hotel from the Chicago police in the 
middle of the night and made "the longest flight we'll ever know" back on the 
morning's first plane. 
</P>
<P>
They were given hope at first, and moved into a motel near the UCLA hospital 
where they were joined by their other two grown sons, one an Orange County 
businessman, the other a student in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The vigil was heartbreaking. For a few shining hours for this wonderfully close 
family, there seemed a chance of improvement. Then the massive head injuries 
required a second surgery from which the young man emerged with no hope of 
recovery. Joshua Lapin died the next day, surrounded by his family. 
</P>
<P>
His parents called us when they arrived from Chicago, reaching out as thank God 
we are able to do at such times. But we weren't there. My wife and I were 
attending a meeting in Palm Springs, and by the time we got the news, Joshua 
was gone. 
</P>
<P>
We rushed to the Lapin home and found the support system already in operation. 
Their two surviving sons were stout pillars of strength. Fellow worshipers from 
their temple were lining up at the back door with food and condolences. Their 
rabbi had been to visit and would be coming again. 
</P>
<P>
But even in the midst of such an outpouring of support, it was clear that dear 
friends who come without any of the built-in closeness of extended family or 
business or religious relationships fill a very special need, too. Friends come 
purely out of love; they carry no other baggage. 
</P>
<P>
But what can even close friends say at such a time? The loss is so profound, 
the pain so deep. The one thing that none of us ever expect to do is bury our 
own children. Nothing can prepare us for this, and the loss is inconsolable. 
</P>
<P>
Every human life is special, but this young man was extra special. Joshua was 
thoughtful and caring and sensitive and funny and smart and intense. Full of 
curiosity and zest for life. As his younger brother said during a magnificently 
affirmative funeral service, "He didn't just touch people; he grabbed them." 
</P>
<P>
At his father's 50th birthday party last year, Joshua took over the proceedings 
with a style so delightful and loving that none of us who were there will ever 
forget it. His light shone. It will continue to shine, but in the immediate 
shock of death, only the irreparable loss seems real. 
</P>
<P>
I'm writing this a few hours after the funeral. The service by Rabbi Mark 
Miller struck an exact -- and remarkably elusive -- chord that embraced 
spiritual sustenance, human yearning and grief, warm recollection and 
commitment to the continuum of life. Mourners gathered at the home afterward 
for food and drink and talk -- and to put into place the first girder in the 
bridge between the ceremonies of death and the rededication to life -- a 
painful, difficult passage. 
</P>
<P>
There will be quiet in their home soon -- as there is in mine now. The guests 
will go home, the talk will fade and the emptiness of grief will be faced in 
the first step of the healing process. I ache for my friends, and I know of no 
means beyond those so beautifully demonstrated today to ease their pain. I once 
thought I had such answers and offered them up glibly. I have no answers now. 
Only love. Unconditional love -- and whatever healing and solace it can bring. 
</P>
<P>
I'm pondering, too, what this week has said to me -- and what use I will make 
of it. Over and over in the strength of these bereaved people, I saw 
demonstrated the quite remarkable ability of the human psyche to draw on some 
deep resource to carry us through such experiences as this. The example is 
comforting. We will all be called on to tap it, although probably under less 
shattering circumstances than these. 
</P>
<P>
But the thought that kept recurring is the suddenness with which tragedy can 
strike. I don't know that we are ever fully prepared for the death of a loved 
one, even when age or illness conditions us. But there is no preparation for 
the sudden death of a loved one with much of life left to experience. And so we 
are plunged into an overpowering emptiness and a sense of the fragility of life 
that can be snuffed out at the most unfair and mundane moment. 
</P>
<P>
And also into this void comes the question: Why was this young life taken at 
this time and in this way? 
</P>
<P>
I had no trouble dealing with the "Why?" because it has become a meaningless 
question to me. Since I don't believe that God decreed this boy's death, the 
question is unanswerable -- and should therefore be dismissed. But the 
fragility of life gave me pause until I began to realize how dangerous and 
counterproductive a constant awareness of this can be. 
</P>
<P>
There are two ways to deal with this sense of fragility: to become cautious and 
careful in everything we do and refuse to go one-on-one with life; or to take 
life at its fullest, to challenge it head-on, to explore its crevices and 
recesses and -- most of all -- to enjoy the process without reservation. 
</P>
<P>
This is the way Joshua Lapin lived; this is his legacy. As Rabbi Miller said 
during the funeral service: "Joshua is probably debating with God right now -- 
and giving as good as he gets." 
</P>
<P>
So my deepest thanks to you, Joshua, for teaching me -- and so many others -- 
this lesson. And to your family members for the example they have set of the 
dignity and compassion and strength and love that is possible for humans to 
achieve. All of us who shared this week with you and your family will live more 
fully as a result. I think that will please you.

NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE: CENTRAL COSTA MESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE L. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When early residents of central Costa Mesa needed to shop, they couldn't just 
dash out to the corner store. Going to the marketplace was an all-day ordeal, 
requiring a trip into downtown Santa Ana by horse and buggy. But now this 
neighborhood is a shopper's mecca, and bargain-hunters from all over Southern 
California attend the Orange County Marketplace, an upscale weekend flea market 
that attracts 4.5 million customers every year. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood is also home to the 18,800-capacity Pacific Amphitheatre, one 
of the largest outdoor concert venues on the West Coast. In addition, the 
Orange County Fairgrounds are located here, adjacent to the amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
But the local attractions have drawbacks for residents of the nearby Mesa del 
Mar housing tract. Some homeowners complain about traffic generated by the swap 
meet and noise from the outdoor concerts. In 1987, Orange County Superior Court 
Judge Gary L. Taylor ordered noise-level restrictions at the amphitheater at 
the request of a homeowners group. Since then, residents have complained that 
the amphitheater has violated the order on several occasions. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone in Mesa del Mar is up in arms about the noise. Some consider 
the musical overspill a fringe benefit, since it's possible to enjoy a favorite 
performer without buying a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Central Costa Mesa began its transition from sparsely populated farmland into a 
bustling hub of activity during World War II, when the government hastily 
transformed 1,335 acres of land here into the Santa Ana Army Air Base. From 
1942 to 1944, more than 126,000 aviation cadets were classified here to receive 
further training as pilots, bombardiers or navigators after several weeks of 
testing.. Local residents were hired as civilian employees, generating jobs and 
income. Big-name performers such as Tommy Dorsey and Duke Ellington entertained 
troops here, and Jack Benny, Edgar Bergen and Bob Hope made live radio 
broadcasts from the base theater. 
</P>
<P>
The base stopped taking new recruits in 1944 and served as a rehabilitation 
center for wounded veterans until 1946. 
</P>
<P>
A portion of the grounds and many base structures were then transformed into 
Orange Coast College, the fairgrounds and the original Costa Mesa City Hall. 
Eventually the Mesa del Mar and College Park housing tracts, Southern 
California College, Costa Mesa High School, Davis Intermediate School and 
Charles TeWinkle Memorial Park appeared in place of the air base. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the original base structures have since been replaced, but several of 
the old buildings, like the Orange County Fairgrounds Administration Building, 
are still in use. A plaque and a memorial garden at the fairgrounds commemorate 
the role the base played in the area's development. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Mesa del Mar occasionally find pieces of the old air base parade 
grounds when digging in their yards. The neighborhood is a living monument to 
the process of turning swords into plowshares.

PENDRAGONS ESCAPE WITH 'BEST ILLUSIONISTS' AWARD; 
</P>
<P>
MAGIC: THE COUPLE ARE ELATED THAT JUDGES CHOSE THEM OVER DAVID COPPERFIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pendragons are more than familiar with David Copperfield. As magic's top 
gun, Copperfield is the guy who fills arenas, does TV specials and is known for 
splashy, sometimes schmaltzy and almost always amazing tricks. 
</P>
<P>
Other illusionists routinely face performing in his shadow, including the 
Pendragons. But Jonathan and Charlotte, the former UC Irvine students turned 
husband-and-wife magic team, found more of the spotlight recently when they 
were named Best Illusionists in the International Magic Awards -- over 
Copperfield and several other performers. 
</P>
<P>
"We beat him!" Jonathan Pendragon said during a telephone interview from Las 
Vegas, where the couple were performing at the Aladdin hotel and casino. "I was 
excited, it's kind of amazing -- sort of like David and Goliath or Jack and the 
Giant Killer. 
</P>
<P>
"David (Copperfield) is visual and spectacular, but I think (the judges) were 
more interested in tradition. We like to keep it more straight, less 
sensational. The contest reflected, I think, more of a purist attitude." 
</P>
<P>
The two-hour-long competition, with categories including entertainers of the 
year (won by Las Vegas regulars Siegfried and Roy), best close-up performer, 
comedy magician, escape artist and technical magician (Copperfield did win this 
one), is scheduled to air Monday at 8 p.m. on KTTV Channel 11. Winning 
routines, including the Pendragons' "Interlude" and "Metamorphosis," will be 
shown. 
</P>
<P>
Although reluctant to describe the illusions specifically, Pendragon said that 
Charlotte "appears to come through my chest" in "Interlude," while 
"Metamorphosis" involves "a rapid escape." 
</P>
<P>
Pendragon pointed out that both feats are typical of their approach, which 
involves a physical style utilizing his gymnastic and diving training (he's 
competed on the college level) and Charlotte's experience as a dancer, gymnast 
and body builder (she was runner-up in the 1982 Body Building Superbowl 
contest). 
</P>
<P>
They avoid the gaudy costumes ("We hate rhinestones," he said) and the more 
traditional tuxedo garb ("It's too restrictive for the way we perform") favored 
by most magicians. Instead, they rely on scant, monotone outfits that allow 
movement and emphasize their physiques. 
</P>
<P>
Agility and quickness are integral to the act, which features levitations, 
disappearances and escapes, a Pendragon trademark. He said they hold the record 
for an escape from a locked trunk popularized by Harry Houdini, who did it in 
seven seconds. Pendragon does it in three. 
</P>
<P>
"There's drama in that because everyone is usually amazed when we accomplish it 
so soon. We combine our physical presence with an acting presence to create a 
style that adds to the illusions. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, the rapidity is not purely for the sake of speed . . . a real 
magician would not stall; he would simply wave his hand and the magic would 
happen. As an actor, I try to make my magic look as real as possible." 
</P>
<P>
The Pendragons met in the late '70s while attending UCI, where Charlotte was 
studying dance, among other things, and Jonathan pursued drama. He was also 
performing solo in local and Los Angeles clubs as a magician, when not 
moonlighting as a Hollywood stuntman (he's doubled for Burgess Meredith and 
John Belushi, among others). Charlotte, too, was a double, having appeared on 
"Charlie's Angels" and "Quincy, M.E." They started dating, and eventually he 
asked her to take part in his act. 
</P>
<P>
At first, they offered the basics, using "manipulation and other standard 
tricks" but soon turned to a more physical style to set them apart. He also 
wanted to make Charlotte more than a pretty assistant and began building a 
routine around their equal partnership. 
</P>
<P>
They progressed rapidly. Although they haven't achieved the household fame of 
Copperfield and, before him, Doug Henning, the Pendragons are reasonably 
well-known among magic fans. Their work in Las Vegas, the acknowledged mecca 
for working magicians, the past few years and various appearances on television 
underscores that. 
</P>
<P>
In talking about magic, Pendragon is apt to get a little philosophical, 
referring to its "preternatural" beauty and ability to be "intellectually 
puzzling." Artistry and sound technique add up to good magic, which comes down 
to "telling a story and tapping into the kid in us." 
</P>
<P>
After a pause, he added that the best illusion "when performed expertly and 
with imagination can instill those lost feelings of youth and wonder that are 
rare and thrilling." 
</P>
<P>
 "The International Magic Awards," featuring the Pendragons, is scheduled to 
air Monday at 8 p.m. on KTTV Channel 11.

Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn., the Irvine-based thrift that became a symbol 
of the nation's savings-and-loan debacle, was officially put up for sale today 
by federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
Also listed is Imperial Federal Savings Assn. in San Diego, one of California's 
largest thrifts with $7.9 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
The Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency mopping up the thrift mess, 
listed Lincoln and Imperial among 18 savings and loans on which it is 
soliciting bids. Both thrifts have continued operating after being seized by 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
The failure in April, 1989, of Lincoln, formerly owned by a corporation 
controlled by Phoenix executive Charles H. Keating Jr., could cost taxpayers $2 
billion. That would make it one of the nation's costliest S&amp;L collapses.

Actor Marlon Brando's daughter was reported to be recovering from the 
drug-induced coma that sent her to a Tahitian hospital Thursday. Cheyenne 
Brando, 20, had overdosed on tranquilizers and antidepressant drugs, according 
to a family source, and her father was to have left Los Angeles this morning to 
join her. 
</P>
<P>
Brando's son, Christian, goes on trial here Monday in the murder of Cheyenne's 
Tahitian lover, Dag Drollet. 
</P>
<P>
As a key witness in the case, Cheyenne has been the object of a legal 
tug-of-war between prosecutors in California and in Tahiti, where she has been 
charged with complicity in Drollet's death. Drollet's father, Jacques, said 
today that he was told the young woman, who gave birth to Drollet's child in 
June, was out of her coma. He said he believed her act was the suicide attempt 
of a "perturbed" young woman.

Los Angeles police officers who stormed into a Granada Hills apartment where a 
man was believed to be firing a weapon found the 61-year-old resident dead of 
an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
A special weapons and tactics team entered the apartment in the 16800 block of 
Chatsworth Street about 11:15 p.m. Thursday, about three hours after neighbors 
reported hearing up to six shots from the unit, Detective Michael Brandt said. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt said the officers found Jerry Jordan, who lived in the apartment alone, 
dead of a gunshot wound. The death has been ruled a suicide but investigators 
have not determined why Jordan killed himself, Brandt said. 
</P>
<P>
During the incident, the neighborhood was cordoned off and apartments near 
Jordan's were evacuated, police said.

A fire that started this morning in the bar area of a closed Northridge 
nightclub caused an estimated $350,000 in damages, the Los Angeles Fire 
Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries during the fire that was reported at 3:45 a.m. at 
Fantasia West Nightclub in the 19000 block of Nordhoff Street, across the 
street from the Northridge Mall, Firefighter Pat Marek said. 
</P>
<P>
Marek said about 40 firefighters contained the blaze in half an hour. The cause 
of the fire is under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The flames were believed to have started behind or near a bar that served a 
raised seating area in the rear of the nightclub, Marek said. Much of the 
damage was confined to that area and a nearby storage area, he said.

THATCHER FOES GLOATING AFTER HOWE PULLS OUT

Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's opponents had a field day today after her 
deputy, Sir Geoffrey Howe, quit in protest of her resistance to Britain's 
integration into the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of having a leader who holds the party together . . . we have one who 
unfortunately allows the party to break up," said ex-Prime Minister Edward 
Heath, who was himself ousted by Thatcher as party leader in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Publicly, key aides in Thatcher's 22-member Cabinet rallied round, although 
they take a more conciliatory policy than the prime minister in the drive 
toward European union. 
</P>
<P>
Education Secretary John MacGregor was chosen today to replace Howe as leader 
of the House of Commons. It was not known whether anyone will assume Howe's 
additional title of deputy prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher, her government in disarray and looking increasingly embattled, was 
closeted at her 10 Downing Street office "working on a couple of speeches for 
next week," a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Howe stormed out of Thatcher's Cabinet late Thursday, vexed by Thatcher's 
implacable refusal to cede British sovereignty to the European Community, the 
12-nation trading bloc. 
</P>
<P>
He could no longer serve honorably in her government, he said, because of the 
strident tone in which she rejected an accord in Rome last weekend by the other 
EC leaders to work for a single European currency in the late 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Foes gloated that the "Iron Lady" might soon be on the way out. An election 
must be held by mid-1992 while some of her own Conservative legislators floated 
the idea of a party leadership poll this December.

MOSCOW CITY COUNCIL DEFIES BAN ON RED SQUARE PROTESTS

<P>
Moscow's radically minded City Council said today that it will defy Kremlin 
pressure to prevent anti-Communist protests during Red Square parades to mark 
Revolution Day next week. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said the council agreed in an emergency session Thursday night to 
allow two protest demonstrations next Wednesday, including a march past KGB 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The decision clashed with a decree issued earlier Thursday by parliamentary 
Speaker Anatoly Lukyanov, an ally of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, declaring 
counterdemonstrations "inexpedient." 
</P>
<P>
Lukyanov warned on television of the possibility of clashes disturbing 
celebrations of the 1917 revolution -- an event now seen by many Russians as a 
national tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow City Deputy Vladimir Bokser said the Soviet Parliament has no powers to 
enforce its will. 
</P>
<P>
"The only effect this will have is to anger people and bring thousands more 
onto the streets to protest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, eager to avoid humiliation for the beleaguered Communist Party and 
the armed forces' general staff, issued an unprecedented presidential decree 
last month ordering military parades to go ahead in the capitals of all the 
nation's constituent republics. 
</P>
<P>
But a constitutional commission recently robbed him of his right to ban 
unofficial demonstrations in central Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
In the southern republic of Azerbaijan, the military commandant, who rules 
under emergency orders, has called off his parade to avoid disturbances. But 
the military are resisting pressure to cancel in the restless, 
independence-seeking Baltic republics.

FRANCE HAS LAST LAUGH AS BRITONS SHUN INSULT DAY

<P>
Urged on by Britain's top-selling Sun newspaper but outnumbered by cameramen 
and pigeons, a handful of Britons gathered in Trafalgar Square today to bawl 
insults at the French. 
</P>
<P>
The tabloid Sun, with a circulation of 4 million, backs Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher against plans by Frenchman Jacques Delors, president of the European 
Commission, for a European currency to replace sterling. 
</P>
<P>
So it urged readers to turn toward France at midday and bellow: "Up yours, 
Delors!" and appointed as gathering place the square that commemorates the 
British victory over the French fleet at Cape Trafalgar in 1805. 
</P>
<P>
Just four members of the ruling Conservative Party and two young office workers 
turned up. 
</P>
<P>
Bemused tourists looked on and taxi drivers hooted approval as the group 
gesticulated, waved flags and sang "Rule Britannia." 
</P>
<P>
The solitary Frenchman present, journalist Eric Dior, was disappointed. "I 
expected something more grotesque," he said. 
</P>
<P>
French newspapers today countered the Sun's outburst with mostly good-natured 
mockery of their neighbors across the English Channel. 
</P>
<P>
"Roastbeefs, the Frogs Greet You," was the headline in Le Parisien. The French 
call the English "roastbeefs" because of their supposed fondness for overcooked 
meat. 
</P>
<P>
"We like you really . . . , " Le Parisien said of the English. " . . . It would 
be too cheeky to reproach you for your appalling food, for pinching our wines, 
our dishes, our chefs, our country cottages and our countryside. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be even easier to mock you for your rainy weather, the way you look 
as if you have just swallowed an umbrella, your women's buckteeth, your pubs 
closed on Sundays and in the evening.

The front of a store selling the strike-torn Daily News was hit by arsonists 
today and two delivery men were attacked, but the newspaper said it distributed 
more than a million papers overnight. 
</P>
<P>
The violence came after more than 13,000 union supporters rallied in front of 
the News building late Thursday, temporarily closing a block on 42nd Street. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of labor leaders and politicians urged the strikers to continue their 
fight. Cardinal John O'Connor sent a letter saying, "I do not believe that 
union members wanted to initiate the current strike." 
</P>
<P>
Police initially estimated the crowd at 5,000 but later changed their estimate 
to 13,000. They reported no arrests or injuries during the demonstration, but 
several scuffles erupted.

TOP ECONOMIC GAUGE DROPS FOR 2ND MONTH; 
</P>
<P>
FORECAST: THE INDEX OF LEADING INDICATORS WAS DOWN 0.8% IN SEPTEMBER. THREE 
CONSECUTIVE DECLINES USUALLY SIGNAL A RECESSION.

<TEXT>
<P>
The government's chief economic forecasting gauge dropped 0.8% in September, 
the government said today, for its second straight monthly drop. 
</P>
<P>
The September drop followed a 1.2% plunge in August, the steepest since a 1.4% 
fall a month after the October, 1987, stock market crash. The index was 
unchanged in July. 
</P>
<P>
Three consecutive declines in the Commerce Department's index of leading 
economic indicators are viewed as a fairly reliable -- although not infallible 
-- sign that a recession is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
There has not been a recession since World War II without the index turning 
down for at least three consecutive months. However, the index was negative for 
six months in 1984 and for five months in 1987-88 and, both times, the economy 
escaped a recession. 
</P>
<P>
Many economists who believe that the nation's economy is in a recession are now 
debating how long it will last and how severe it will be. 
</P>
<P>
Even those analysts who say the economy still can skirt a recession generally 
agree that the current quarter is in a contraction. A recession generally is 
defined as two straight quarters of negative growth. 
</P>
<P>
Nine of the forward-looking indicators pulled the index down in September. 
</P>
<P>
They were lower stock prices, a decrease in orders for consumer goods, an 
increase in weekly unemployment claims, a decline in building permits, a drop 
in an index measuring consumer confidence, a decrease in unfilled orders, a 
lower money supply, faster business delivery times and a decline in the price 
of raw materials. 
</P>
<P>
The only positive contributor was an increase in orders for new plants and 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
One indicator, the average workweek, was unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The various changes left the index at 143.3% of its 1982 base of 100 and down 
1.1% from its level a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts who contend that a recession will be avoided still express 
concern that the economy may have weakened during the current quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Boskin, chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, 
said, "We are concerned about a sluggish fourth quarter and the early part of 
1991." 
</P>
<P>
Stephen S. Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. of New York, 
believes that the economy will avoid a recession, although he projects a 
decline in growth during the current quarter.

A national index of help-wanted advertising weakened further in September, 
indicating the labor market slump shows no sign of easing, the index's authors 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, a private business research organization based in New 
York, said advertising volume was hit by rising layoffs and general 
unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
"The slumping labor market shows no sign of abating. Layoffs remain elevated, 
unemployment is slowly rising and want-ad volume continues to decline at a 
significant pace," said Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein. 
</P>
<P>
Advertising volume fell in seven regions and rose in only two. The Mountain and 
West South Central regions registered "modest" increases of 3.15% and 0.6%, 
respectively. The hardest hit was New England, with a 7.6% fall. It was 
followed by the Pacific, with a 6.9% decline, and West North Central, down 
5.7%.

UNEMPLOYMENT: ECONOMISTS SEE START OF WIDESPREAD JOB SCALEBACK AS THE ECONOMY

Citicorp, General Dynamics, Aetna and General Motors are only a few of the 
major employers that have announced layoffs in recent days. Many economists say 
it could be just the start of a widespread job scaleback as the economy stalls. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be more layoffs, the unemployment rate will rise, job market 
conditions will deteriorate for the next six months or longer," said Bruce 
Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had a recession for so long that people forget what happens," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some economists said service jobs may be hit hardest. That's due partly to the 
boom in the banking, finance, advertising and other service industries in the 
1980s that allowed these firms to grow fat. 
</P>
<P>
Finance and banking companies "were basically taking anyone who could walk 
through the door," said economist Robert Dye of the Wefa Group, an economic 
forecasting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
But in the face of increasingly grim economic forecasts and figures -- 
compounded by the economic shock from the Persian Gulf standoff -- these 
companies have been letting workers go in droves. Citicorp, for one, said it 
will eliminate 2,000 jobs by the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
"They grew too fast and this is the consequence of growing too fast, a shakeout 
if you will," said Kenneth Goldstein, an economist with the Conference Board. 
</P>
<P>
The slowdown among financial companies began with the Wall Street crash of 
October, 1987, but it has since intensified as small investors have grown more 
cautious and avoided the stock and bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
The crash, along with the end of the real estate boom and the spread of the 
savings-and-loan crisis, also hurt banks and insurers. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing companies have fared somewhat better because they learned from 
the last recession eight years ago to keep operations lean, economists said. 
But the recent economic sluggishness has prompted many of them to lay off 
workers as well. 
</P>
<P>
In perhaps the largest such cutback, General Motors Corp. said it will close 
four plants and idle others temporarily, affecting thousands of workers. 
Experts say GM is responding to excess car-making capacity as well as to the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
State and local government jobs also are facing cuts due to withering tax 
revenues. Reductions are planned by Massachusetts, Virginia and the city of 
Pittsburgh, among others. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE PINK SLIP ROLL 
</P>
<P>
A sampling of layoffs and other job reductions announced this week: 
</P>
<P>
Citicorp -- Nation's largest banking company plans to eliminate 2,000 jobs by 
the end of next year as it cuts back corporate finance activities. 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics Corp. -- Budget cuts and declining demand for its F-16 fighter 
jet will force the laying off of 700 to 1,000 employees in January. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Co. -- Jeans maker plans to lay off 800 workers as it closes three plants 
by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Marietta Astronautics Group -- Colorado-based firm eliminated 835 jobs 
this year and expects similar reductions next year. 
</P>
<P>
Bethlehem Steel Corp. -- Plans to lay off 450 employees from its Ebensburg, 
Pa., coal mine by Christmas because an abundance of coal on the market is 
driving prices down. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. -- Management shake-up designed to cut costs may result 
in the loss of several hundred jobs.

SENNA-PROST FEUD STILL BOILING AS AUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX NEARS

<TEXT>
<P>
The long-running feud between former Formula One racing teammates Ayrton Senna 
of Brazil and Alain Prost of France continues to boil as the two prepare for 
Sunday's season-ending Australian Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
The bitterness erupted full force after Senna and Prost collided on the first 
turn of the Japanese Grand Prix two weeks ago, knocking both men out of the 
race and clinching Senna's second world championship. 
</P>
<P>
Prost has accused Senna of initiating the collision to eliminate him from the 
championship battle. 
</P>
<P>
"He is bad for the sport," Prost said. "If it ever came to the point where I 
had to do the same things to win the championship, I would have to think about 
whether to stay in the sport. What has happened is bad for the sport, and it is 
a bad example for young people." 
</P>
<P>
Senna countered that Prost is a chronic complainer. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Prost does a good job in getting people to focus on other things," 
Senna said.

Five pitchers combined on a two-hitter and Takahiro Ikeyama of the Yakult 
Swallows hit a two-run double in the third inning today as a Japanese all-star 
team beat a major-league all-star team, 4-1, in the opener of an eight-game 
goodwill series. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Bonds of the Pittsburgh Pirates hit a bases-loaded single in the first 
off Hideo Nomo of the Kintetsu Buffaloes, the Japanese rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Nomo had walked the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese went ahead with a three-run third against Montreal's Oil Can Boyd. 
With runners on second and third and one out, Ikeyama doubled to left-center 
and scored on Tatsunori Hara's single. 
</P>
<P>
Akinobu Okada of the Hanshin Tigers added a sacrifice fly in the seventh off 
Seattle's Randy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Hiromi Makihara, the second of five pitchers, was the winner. He pitched two 
hitless innings. Masao Kida pitched the ninth for the save. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd, Johnson and Rob Dibble of Cincinnati combined on a four-hitter. Boyd 
struck out six and allowed three hits in five innings, while Johnson struck out 
four in two innings and Dibble struck out two in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Cecil Fielder, who returned to Japan as a hero after becoming the first major 
leaguer in 13 years to hit 50 homers, went 0 for 3, including two strikeouts. 
Fielder played for Hanshin in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Alomar Jr. of Cleveland was the only major-leaguer besides Bonds to get a 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
The second game of the series will be played Saturday, also at the Tokyo Dome. 
Chuck Finley of the Angels is scheduled to start against Masaki Saito of the 
Yomiuri Giants.

TOWEL FIRM SWAMPED BY NFL'S ROBE ORDER

A Wisconsin towel company is trying to fill the NFL's order for 2,100 
terry-cloth robes and wraps for players so that female reporters won't face any 
more locker room interference. 
</P>
<P>
But McArthur Towels workers learned that their one-size-fits-all wrap-arounds 
don't fit some of the hulking players. 
</P>
<P>
"The Green Bay Packers equipment manager called and said the terry wrappers we 
sent weren't large enough to fit five of their 300-pound players," said Greg 
McArthur, executive vice president of the family business. He said the company 
has been doing custom work for larger players. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been hectic," McArthur said. 
</P>
<P>
The mass order was prompted by locker room incidents involving women reporters 
covering the New England Patriots and Cincinnati Bengals, NFL spokesman Greg 
Aiello said. 
</P>
<P>
McArthur Towels, a 100-year-old company, is to provide $40,000 in robes and 
wrap-arounds, towels that can be secured around the waist with Velcro closures. 
Each of the NFL's teams is required to order 75 cover-ups of some sort. 
</P>
<P>
The first shipments have been sent out and are being worn in the locker rooms, 
NFL officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Aiello said players won't be required to wear towels or wraps while reporters 
are in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
McArthur Towels has been supplying NFL towels, robes and wraps for five years, 
but this is the first time the company has been ordered to ship supplies to 
every team at the same time. The robes and wraps are being produced in the team 
colors or in white, and include the team's logo. 
</P>
<P>
McArthur said it usually takes about 3 1/2 yards of fabric to make a 
standard-size, 24-by-54-inch wrap. He said the company is extending the 
waistline by eight inches for larger players.

<P>
Buffalo Sabres winger Rick Vaive is likely to miss the team's next two games 
because of a rough check administered by Boston's Bob Sweeney. 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney cross-checked Vaive head-first toward the corner boards with 1:47 
remaining in overtime during Wednesday night's game, which ended in a 3-3 tie. 
</P>
<P>
Vaive appeared to avoid more serious injury by rolling his head to the side a 
second before impact. 
</P>
<P>
After watching replays of the incident Thursday, Vaive said the NHL should 
strengthen its rules against back-side checking. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm lucky I didn't break my neck," Vaive said. "Something like that should be 
a 10- or a 20-game suspension, cut and dried and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney received a minor penalty for the check. Vaive said he was not accusing 
Sweeney of malicious intent to injure, but said a back-side check should result 
in suspension even if it was accidental.

Driver John Campbell will get his first look at Peace Corps tonight, and it 
could be from farther back than he is accustomed to. 
</P>
<P>
In her last start in the United States, Campbell was in Peace Corps' sulky when 
she won the Breeders Crown 3-year-old Filly Trot on Oct. 27, 1989, at Pompano 
Harness. In 1988, Campbell drove her to victory in the Breeders Crown 
2-year-old Filly Trot. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, Campbell will drive Free Token against Peace Corps in the Mare Trot, 
one of eight Breeders Crown races on the Pompano program. 
</P>
<P>
"If she's anything like last year, she'll be very tough to beat," Campbell said 
of Peace Corps, who is owned by Bjorn Pettersson of Sweden and who is driven 
and trained by Swede Stig Johansson. 
</P>
<P>
"She's just a great, great mare. She's got tremendous desire." 
</P>
<P>
Johansson bought the New Jersey-bred Peace Corps for a reported $1.6 million in 
January, 1989, and kept her in the United States where she became Trotter of 
the Year with a record of 16 wins and one second in 19 starts and earnings of 
$1,002,701. 
</P>
<P>
After her victory in the Breeders Crown 3-year-old Filly Trot, Peace Corps was 
taken to Sweden. In 12 starts this year in that country, Norway and France, she 
posted a record of eight wins and three seconds. 
</P>
<P>
In her first start abroad, Peace Corps came off a six-month layoff to finish 
second to the great Mack Lobell in Sweden's most prestigious race, the 
Elitlopp. 
</P>
<P>
In her last start, Oct. 13 at Sweden's Aby Racetrack, she beat Sorrento, the 
leading Soviet trotter. 
</P>
<P>
When she beat colts in the 1989 World Trotting Derby in a time of 1:52 4/5 on a 
one-mile track at DuQuoin, Ill., she became the second-fastest trotter in 
history, after Mack Lobell. 
</P>
<P>
While Peace Corps tries to become the third horse to win three Breeders' Crown 
races, Beach Towel will try to become the first harness racehorse to win $2 
million in a single year.

DASH FOR SPEED TO MAKE SEASON DEBUT AT LOS ALAMITOS

<P>
Two-time champion Dash for Speed will make her seasonal debut at the Horsemen's 
Quarter Horse Racing Assn. meet Saturday night at Los Alamitos when she opposes 
five rivals in the $25,000 added Charger Bar Handicap. The Charger Bar is for 
fillies and mares and will be contested at 350 yards as the ninth race on the 
12-race program. 
</P>
<P>
The Blane Schvaneveldt-trained Dash for Speed looks to be the odds-on choice in 
the Charger Bar. The 5-year-old mare has won 21 of 27 lifetime starts and 
boasts earnings of $1,093,441. Dash for Speed is 2-for-2 in 1990, winning the 
Anne Burnette Invitational and the Los Alamitos Championship Invitational this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Variety Road, which has come back from a nasty spill and two seasons at stud to 
continue a successful racing career, can boost his earnings above the 
$1-million mark Saturday when he heads the field in the $300,000 California Cup 
Classic at Santa Anita Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Classic will be run at 1 1/8 miles and be the richest event of the 
inaugural California Cup, a day of seven stakes for California-breds with 
purses totaling $1 million. First post time will be at noon, half an hour 
earlier than usual. 
</P>
<P>
Variety Road, a 7-year-old horse owned by Kjell Qvale of San Francisco, has won 
15 of 47 lifetime starts for earnings of $857,465 and would become the 12th 
Cal-bred to reach the $1-million milestone.

COURT JESTER OF ROCK TARGETS STARS FROM HENLEY TO ELVIS

<P>
The urge to kill Don Henley first hit Mojo Nixon as he watched the pony-tailed 
former Eagle accept a Grammy for "Record of the Year." 
</P>
<P>
The end of the innocence? How about the end of Don Henley? 
</P>
<P>
"The Grammys really put me over the top. I didn't want to watch, but my wife 
insisted," singer-songwriter Nixon recalled. "The whole thing just made me 
furious. . . . Don Henley and Phil Collins and now George Michael -- they want 
to be taken seriously." 
</P>
<P>
The same can't be said of Nixon, who was inspired to write "Don Henley Must 
Die" for his current album, "Otis." The song is a hysterical, screaming 
indictment of "big, bloated Henley-esque rock stars," Mojo said. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't talked to Don directly, but he should be honored. Maybe we could get 
together, have a couple of drinks, I don't know," said the 33-year-old Nixon 
about Henley, whose "The End of the Innocence" took one of the top honors at 
this year's Grammys. 
</P>
<P>
It's not the first time Mojo, the self-described court jester of rock 'n' roll, 
has taken aim at a well-known target. 
</P>
<P>
His last album included "Debbie Gibson Is Pregnant With My Two-Headed Love 
Child"; in "Elvis Is Everywhere," he branded Michael J. Fox "the anti-Elvis"; 
and he once suggested in song a drug-testing method for Nancy Reagan that is 
too tasteless to print in a family newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon said the surviving victims of his songs are generally good-natured. But a 
few Elvis fans became irate over his homage to the King, which credited Presley 
with creating Stonehenge, the pyramids and the Bermuda Triangle. 
</P>
<P>
"Elvis and his fans are a little nutty, but that's what makes it great," said 
Nixon, who last year set up a phone line for Elvis-spotters to call in their 
sightings. 
</P>
<P>
"We got 500 calls a day -- people with Elvis and Liberace at their house, 
worshipping Jackie's hair. People with Elvis out front mowing the lawn. It's 
great," Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon's experiences are not limited to music; he played the role of Jerry Lee 
Lewis' drummer in "Great Balls of Fire," an experience that allowed him to hang 
out with "The Killer." 
</P>
<P>
"With Jerry Lee alive, you can't make the movie you want to see, because Jerry 
Lee would kill you, and that wouldn't be good," Nixon explained. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry Lee was awfully good to me, but then I wasn't married to him." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there is Mojo's greatest fantasy: to become the target of the 
record-stickering movement, to write the lyrics that drive Florida Gov. Bob 
Martinez crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been striving for that," Nixon said. "I'm sending my records to Tipper 
Gore and this idiot down in Florida, but it doesn't seem to be working."

DEVOTION TO GERSHWIN PAYS OFF 
</P>

There are certain songs by George and Ira Gershwin that Michael Feinstein never 
ever gets tired of singing. 
</P>
<P>
Like "They Can't Take That Away From Me." 
</P>
<P>
Or "Someone to Watch Over Me." 
</P>
<P>
"That's a song, every time I do it, I feel a different sense of how I want to 
sing it," said the brash, boyish Feinstein. "There's never only one 
interpretation." 
</P>
<P>
In the last seven years or so, Feinstein has been singing a lot of Gershwin -- 
and Kern and Rodgers and Porter and Styne and all those other great Broadway 
and Hollywood composers he admires with the enthusiasm of a true believer. 
</P>
<P>
And his devotion has paid off. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, Feinstein has gone from tiny hotel clubs in Los Angeles to the 
fabled Algonquin in New York, from concert dates all across the country to 
various symphony orchestras and to Broadway three times in two years. 
</P>
<P>
The performing -- and pressure -- have been almost nonstop. 
</P>
<P>
"I do work a lot," the 34-year-old Feinstein said recently. "One thing that 
happens when you first achieve success is that you get jobs and think, 'Wow! 
Great! This is what I wanted my whole life!' You take everything." 
</P>
<P>
Seven records and hundreds of concerts later, he said it is time to slow down 
after being on the road for as much as seven months each year. 
</P>
<P>
"I got to a point where finally I had to say, 'No, I'm not going to do this.' 
It's hard to say no. I'm a real people pleaser. Now I'm really starting to say 
no because there has to be a balance in everything, particularly in work and 
play. And I'm going to take a good deal of time off next year." 
</P>
<P>
Besides his house in California, Feinstein now has a second home in Santa Fe, 
N.M., although he hasn't been there as often as he would like. 
</P>
<P>
"I have unblocked a lot of my life for 1991," he said. "I just need time to 
myself. People hire you because they think you're good or they love what you 
do. But you have to have time to be creative. You have to have time to lie on a 
beach and read. To do other things. I want to take time to learn how to use 
computers and synthesizers." 
</P>
<P>
Although he loves New York, Feinstein can't unwind in the Big Apple. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I've never lived here," he said. "But I meditate -- and exercise -- 
and that keeps me sane." 
</P>
<P>
What hasn't bothered him was the change from playing in front of 50 to 60 
people at places like the Algonquin to performing before 2,000 in a theater or 
even 17,000 in the Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was first booked into a large place, I was nervous," Feinstein said. "I 
didn't know whether I would adapt to a larger setting. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned that I could do the same thing on stage that I could do in the 
Algonquin -- relate to the people, tell stories. If I'm comfortable on stage 
and act like I'm in my living room, then the audience is going to be 
comfortable."

EARTHA KITT ASSAULT ALLEGED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A former wife of jazz great Miles Davis has filed a $100,000 lawsuit against 
Eartha Kitt, accusing the singer of assaulting her after a performance in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Kitt's New York-based agent declined immediate comment, saying she had not yet 
reviewed the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Frances Davis of Los Angeles claims in her lawsuit filed Tuesday that she and 
others were invited for cocktails with Kitt in her suite after the performer's 
July 26 show at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"As (Davis) was leaving the suite and approaching the elevator, (Kitt) grabbed 
plaintiff from behind (and) put her hands on plaintiff's face and throat," the 
suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
Davis "struggled to get away and fell on the floor, with (Kitt) falling on top 
of her," the complaint says. 
</P>
<P>
Davis claims that she injured her back and shoulder and also suffered a wrist 
injury. Her glasses were also broken, the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' attorney, Marvyn Gordon, said there were several people present when the 
62-year-old singer allegedly attacked Davis. He said he did not know what 
prompted the alleged incident. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to resolve the dispute out of court were unsuccessful, the attorney 
said.

MUSICIANS TO RALLY AT HOME OF NEGLECTED SAX INVENTOR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One thousand musicians will gather Sunday outside the boyhood home of a 
neglected inventor to "sob on the long cool winding" instrument that Adolphe 
Sax created 150 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The golden horn revolutionized 20th-Century music, but Sax never heard the 
long, lonely flights of Lester Young, Charlie Parker and John Coltrane. 
</P>
<P>
His life, however, played like a melancholy jazz solo. 
</P>
<P>
It was marred by nearly fatal accidents, the first at age 3 when he fell three 
floors and was left as dead. Surviving childhood, he then faced the envy of 
competitors who did all they could, even attempted murder, to destroy him and 
his invention. 
</P>
<P>
He went bankrupt three times and ruined his health trying to keep control of 
his invention, which French musician Eugene Bozza called "the most moving, the 
most heart-gripping, the most beautiful wind . . . instrument." 
</P>
<P>
The anniversary is being celebrated this weekend in Dinant, capped by a concert 
Sunday in front of Sax's home by 1,000 saxophone players from throughout 
Europe. Many of the saxophonists are trained in classical music, which did not 
fully accept the instrument until the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Sax was born in 1814 in a modest home on Dinant's Rue Neuve, eldest of the 11 
children of a successful maker of musical instruments. 
</P>
<P>
At 20, he became famous for designing a clarinet so superior to rivals that the 
conductor of the Paris Opera called all others "barbaric instruments." 
</P>
<P>
Disappointed by Belgium's lack of support of his skills, he went to Paris six 
years later, poor but hopeful that avant-garde musicians would take his work to 
glory. 
</P>
<P>
"Get your new instruments finished soon," French composer Ludovic Halevy had 
written him, "and come to help starving composers and the public who want 
something new." 
</P>
<P>
Halevy knew Sax was working on a revolutionary instrument. The Belgian had 
invented the saxophone in 1840 in Dinant, feeling immediately that it would 
change the musical world. But he was so scared it would be copied he hid behind 
a curtain when he first presented it in a competition in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
It was "a unique instrument at the edge of silence," said Hector Berlioz, the 
only one "expressing tenderness, restrained passion," according to Georges 
Bizet. 
</P>
<P>
Patented in 1846, he had to fight countless court battles to defend the 
paternity of his instrument. His workshop was set afire once, and one time an 
assailant fired a shot at a co-worker, believing it was Sax. 
</P>
<P>
Although he sold 20,000 saxophones in 17 years, he failed to get the wide 
recognition he dreamed about. He died in 1894, less than a quarter-century 
before jazz finally gave his instrument the triumph it deserved. 
</P>
<P>
Hot jazz, later refined into swing, bebop, free-form and fusion, swept from

<TEXT>

Jerrell Wardlaw, who sometimes picked up extra cash working part-time at his 
neighborhood 7-Eleven, walked into the store this week and made a purchase 
worth $30.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, the Lotto ticket held by the Livermore man was verified as the 
only one with all six of the numbers drawn Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The jackpot, which he'll collect in 20 yearly after-tax payments of $1.2 
million, is the biggest won by an individual in the California lottery game. 
</P>
<P>
Wardlaw, married with four children, said his spending plans include buying a 
motor home for a cross-country trip, making sure his children get good 
educations and building a new home in Livermore. 
</P>
<P>
After buying a pack of cigarettes Monday at the 4th Street 7-Eleven, Wardlaw 
had only a dollar left in his pocket, according to store owner Jud McDonnell. 
</P>
<P>
"Eh, give me a (Lotto) quick pick," Wardlaw said. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday morning, Wardlaw went to his job at an engine company in Santa Clara 
-- he was late because his truck broke down -- without knowing he held the 
winning ticket. A co-worker had heard that the winning ticket was sold in 
Livermore and jokingly asked if it was Wardlaw's. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Yeah, sure.' And then Jerry looked at his ticket and sure enough it 
was him," McDonnell related. 
</P>
<P>
The jackpot winner returned at once to Livermore and the 7-Eleven. McDonnell 
rented a 30-foot limousine that took the Wardlaws to Sacramento.

the seventh and Sunshine Machine in the eighth.
